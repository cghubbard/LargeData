The city of Denver and the wider Denver metropolitan area is home to many 
sports teams. The following table shows sports teams in the Denver metropolitan 
area that average more than 12,000 fans per game: Denver is one of 12 U.S. 
cities with teams from four major sports. The Denver Broncos of the National 
Football League have drawn crowds of over 70,000 since their AFL origins 
in the early 1960s at Mile High Stadium, and continue to draw fans today 
to their current home Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Broncos 
have sold out every home game (except for strike-replacement games) since 
1970. The Broncos are the current Super Bowl champions, winning Super Bowl 
L against the Carolina Panthers. In total, the Broncos have advanced to 
the Super Bowl eight times and won back-to-back titles in 1998 and 1999, 
and again in 2015. In the 1980s and 90s, one of the top priorities of former 
Mayor Federico Peña was bringing Major League Baseball to the city. In 
1993, the MLB awarded an expansion team to Denver and they were named the 
Colorado Rockies. Mile High Stadium was home to the Rockies from 1993 to 
1995 while Coors Field was under construction. They appeared in their first 
World Series in 2007 after winning the championship of the National League, 
where they were swept by the Boston Red Sox of the American League in four 
games. The Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) 
play at the Pepsi Center. The team was founded as the Denver Larks in 1967 
as a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA) but 
changed its name to the Denver Rockets before the first season. They changed 
its name to the Denver Nuggets in 1974. The team joined the NBA in 1976 
after the ABA-NBA merger. It has not made an appearance in an NBA Finals 
since joining the NBA. Denver is home to the Colorado Avalanche, a National 
Hockey League (NHL) team that relocated from Quebec City in 1995. They 
have won two Stanley Cups in 1996 and in 2001 while playing in Denver, 
and they also play at Pepsi Center. The Avalanche are scheduled to play 
the Detroit Red Wings in the first ever outdoor professional hockey game 
in Denver on Saturday, February 27 at Coors Field.[1] The Colorado Rapids 
of Major League Soccer play at Dick's Sporting Goods Park, a soccer-specific 
stadium in the Denver suburb of Commerce City. The Rapids were one of the 
ten founding teams of Major League Soccer that began play in 1996, and 
initially played at what was then known as Invesco Field at Mile High before 
moving into their current home in 2007. The Rapids won the MLS Cup in 2010. 
The Rapids' main rival is the Real Salt Lake, and the two teams play every 
year for the Rocky Mountain Cup. Dick's Sporting Goods Park has also hosted 
several international soccer matches, including U.S. national team qualifying 
matches for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Notes: Furniture Row Racing is 
a NASCAR team and fields the #78 Chevrolet SS for Martin Truex, Jr. The 
team is owned and sponsored by the U.S. furniture store chain Furniture 
Row, and is the only NASCAR team headquartered in Colorado. Notes: NFL(1970–present)
