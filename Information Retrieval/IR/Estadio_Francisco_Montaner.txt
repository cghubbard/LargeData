The Estadio Francisco ("Paquito") Montaner (English: Francisco ("Paquito") 
Montaner Stadium) is a multi-use stadium in Ponce, Puerto Rico. It is home 
to the Leones de Ponce team of the Puerto Rico Baseball League (LBPPR) 
and FC Leones of the Puerto Rico Soccer League (PRSL). The stadium has 
a capacity of 16,000 seats.[1] Construction of the stadium began in 1947 
and it opened on October 15, 1949.[2] Montaner has the distinction of being 
the first stadium in Puerto Rico that installed an artificial surface field.[3][4] 
The stadium lies next to the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium, where the Ponce 
Lions (basketball) hold their games. The Stadium was named to honor Francisco 
"Paquito" Montaner, one of the greatest Puerto Rican pitchers of all times.[5] 
While baseball had been practiced in the city prior to this, baseball in 
Ponce started in earnest upon the arrival of the Americans to the island 
after the Spanish American War of 1898. The first non-professional baseball 
leagues played at Campo Atlético Charles H. Terry. However, after the formation 
of the Liga de Béisbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Semiprofessional 
Baseball League) in 1938,[6] the sport had mature enough that it became 
necessary to plan on building a new stadium. This need was further exacerbated 
on 14 September 1941 when the League became a professional-level league.[7] 
Construction of the stadium began in 1947 and it opened two years later 
on October 15, 1949.[8] In addition to baseball, the stadium had other 
uses. In particular, it was also used for basketball games. These were 
played on a convertible basketball court that was stowed away when the 
basket games were over.[9] The PRPBL's regular playing season runs from 
November through January. From February to August, the venue is transformed 
into a track and field stadium, and also serves as a venue for other activities 
such as a host of the Mustang Auto Daredevils. It has also been used for 
intramural competitions and other academic sporting events. The track is 
completely covered during baseball season and then it is elevated via a 
hydraulic system for the track and field events. The stadium is also used 
for winter training by many United States Major Baseball League players.[10] 
Montaner has seen a total of 12 championships: four in BSN basketball (1952, 
1961, 1964 y 1965), one in Double A (AA) baseball in 1957, six in Professional 
Baseball (68-69, 69-70, 71-72, 81-82, 03-04 and 08-09), and one in football 
in 2007.[11] Montaner has also seen some great events in athletics. The 
Primeros Juegos Ponceños, the Frankie Colón Memorial, the Justas Intercolegiales 
(intercollegiate games), the Central American and Caribbean Games (“Ponce 
93”), and the Iberoamerican Games, all took place here. There have also 
been athletics competitions at the Masters category and, more recently, 
the famed Ponce Grand Prix.[12] For many years Montaner was the venue of 
the finals of the Guantes Dorados de Boxeo Aficionado (Amateur Boxing's 
Golden Gloves), national as well as U.S.-based Professional Wrestling billboards, 
bull runs, concerts by internationally renowned artists, as well as the 
site of various major religious conventions.[13] In February 1958, evangelist 
Billy Graham hosted a religious event at this stadium.[14] Through Montaner, 
Ponce has been able to see giants in the world of sports such as Francisco 
‘Pancho’ Coímbre, Felo Guilbe, Tomás ‘Planchardón’ Quiñones, Luis Rodríguez 
Olmo, ‘Canena’ Márquez, Carlos Bernier, José Guillermo ‘Pantalones’ Santiago, 
Luis ‘Tite’ Arroyo, Víctor Pellot, Roberto Clemente, Orlando ‘Peruchín’ 
Cepeda, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, José Rafael ‘Palillo’ 
Santiago, Steve Carlton, John Boozer, Otoniel Vélez Franceschi, Roberto 
Alomar, Santos Alomar, Sr., José ‘Cheo’ Cruz, Rickey Henderson, José ‘Pepe’ 
Mangual, Luis ‘Mambo’ De León, Joey Cora, Juan ‘Igor’ González, José Vidro, 
Iván Rodríguez, José Molina, Raúl Casanova, Javier López, and Javier Vázquez. 
Various “No Hit No Run” were played in this stadium, in particular the 
ones by ‘Pantalones’ Santiago, Hank Behrman, José Luis ‘Witito’ Martínez, 
and the rare “no hitter”, by Giancarlo Alvarado against the fearful Indios 
de Mayagüez.[15] When basketball games were also played here (since 1972 
they have been played at the Juan Pachín Vicéns Auditorium). Fans still 
remember the very first championship of the Leones de Ponce (baseball) 
in 1952, and the electrifying plays by Tomás ‘Guabina’ Gutiérrez, Antonio 
‘Toño’ Morales, “El Barco” Salvador Dijols, Ángel ‘Conejo’ García, César 
Bocachica, and Joe Hatton, and the maneuvers by the best Puerto Rican basketball 
player of all times Juan ‘Pachín’ Vicens, in particular, the night when 
he became the first player to reach the 5,000 points in Puerto Rican basketball.[16] 
Montaner also witnessed the speed of Juan "Papo" Franceschi, and the techniques 
of Arnaldo Bristol, Cuban Javier Sotomayor, Reinaldo ‘Pochy’ Oliver, Edgardo 
Guilbe, Emilio Navarro Jr., Félix Martínez, and Javier Culson.[17] Coordinates:
