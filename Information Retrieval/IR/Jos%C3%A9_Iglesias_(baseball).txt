José Antonio Iglesias Alemán (born January 5, 1990) is a Cuban professional 
baseball shortstop for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Boston Red Sox. With pitcher Noel Argüelles, 
Iglesias defected from the Cuban junior national team while in Canada.[1] 
Iglesias signed as an international amateur free agent with the Boston 
Red Sox in September 2009.[2] Prior to the 2011 season, Iglesias was the 
sole Red Sox prospect on the MLB.com annual list of top 50 baseball prospects, 
where he was ranked 42nd.[3] In March 2011, Iglesias was optioned to the 
Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. Iglesias was called up by the Red Sox and made 
his major league debut on May 8, 2011 as a defensive substitute for Jed 
Lowrie in the ninth inning of a 9–5 win over the Minnesota Twins. In the 
next game, he represented the game-winning run, scoring from first base 
on a Carl Crawford double in the 11th inning.[4] On May 11, 2011, Iglesias 
made his first MLB start due to Jed Lowrie being sick.[5] Iglesias started 
the 2012 season in Pawtucket. He was called up to Boston May 1 after an 
ailing back sidelined Kevin Youkilis,[6] but he did not appear in a game 
before being sent back down to Triple-A. Iglesias also appeared late in 
the 2012 season to back up Mike Aviles, and hit his first career home run 
during this stretch. Entering 2013, Iglesias was ranked as the 10th best 
prospect in the Red Sox organization,[7] and 96th on the MLB.com Top 100 
Prospects list.[8] He started the season in Boston, going 9-for-20 with 
two doubles and one RBI in six games, but was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket 
after Stephen Drew was activated on April 10. He was recalled by the Red 
Sox on May 24 when third baseman Will Middlebrooks was placed on the DL. 
Iglesias excelled while splitting time between shortstop and third base, 
remaining in the starting lineup even after Middlebrooks returned from 
the DL. Despite being known primarily for his defense, Iglesias batted 
.420 for a stretch of over 100 at-bats after being recalled, including 
an 18-game hitting streak that was broken on June 19 against the Tampa 
Bay Rays. For his efforts, he was named the American League Rookie of the 
Month for June. Iglesias started the 2013 season playing 63 games with 
a .330 batting average, a home run, and 19 RBIs while with Boston. On July 
30, Iglesias was traded to the Detroit Tigers in a three-team deal that 
sent Jake Peavy and Brayan Villarreal to the Boston Red Sox and Avisail 
García and Francellis Montas to the Chicago White Sox.[9] Iglesias chose 
jersey No. 1, making him the first Tigers player to wear it since Lou Whitaker 
retired in 1995.[10] Iglesias drove in a run with a single in his very 
first game as a Tiger, on August 2, helping Detroit to a 2–1 win over the 
White Sox.[11] The next night, he hit his first home run as a Tiger, a 
solo shot to left field in the fourth inning.[12] Following the 50-game 
suspension given to Tigers starting shortstop Jhonny Peralta on August 
5 for his connections to the South Florida Biogenesis clinic, Iglesias 
was named the Tigers new everyday shortstop.[13] For the rest of the 2013 
season with the Tigers, Iglesias batted .259 with 2 home runs, and 10 RBIs 
in 46 games. Overall in 2013, Iglesias hit .303 with 3 home runs and 29 
RBIs in 109 games combined with both the Red Sox and Tigers. On the field, 
he committed 6 errors in 357 chances. Regardless of his trade after the 
All-Star Break, Iglesias was part of the Tigers 25-man active roster for 
their postseason run. During the postseason, Iglesias batted .231 with 
an RBI. In Game 6 of the 2013 American League Championship Series, Iglesias 
was the final out of the series to strike out, resulting in the Tigers 
losing the series to the eventual World Series champ Boston Red Sox after 
6 games. Iglesias was named the 2013 Detroit Tigers/Detroit Sports Broadcasters 
Association Rookie of the Year. Iglesias finished second in the American 
League Rookie of the Year voting in 2013, being edged out by Wil Myers.[14] 
On January 8, Iglesias and the Tigers agreed to terms on a one-year contract 
worth $1.65 million. Although Iglesias is under team control through 2018, 
his 2014 salary had yet to be determined after the contract he signed with 
the Red Sox as an amateur free agent expired.[15] Iglesias missed the entire 
2014 season due to stress fractures in both of his shins.[16] On July 6, 
Iglesias was named as a reserve for the American League at the 2015 All-Star 
Game.[17] On September 5, it was announced that Iglesias suffered a non-displaced 
small fracture in his right middle finger at the PIP joint after being 
hit on the hand by a pitch, and the team announced he would be out for 
at least two weeks.[18] With the Tigers later falling out of the AL Central 
race, the team elected to not activate him from the DL for the remainder 
of the season. During the 2015 season, Iglesias posted a .300 batting average 
in 416 at-bats, with 17 doubles, two home runs and 23 RBIs. On January 
15, 2016, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Iglesias, agreeing on a one-year, 
$2.1 million contract.[19] Iglesias made one trip to the disabled list 
in 2016, after suffering a left hamstring strain in August,[20] but still 
reached career highs with 137 games, 467 at-bats and 26 doubles. He finished 
the season with a .255 batting average, 4 home runs and 32 RBI. Following 
the season, Iglesias was named a Gold Glove Award finalist for shortstop, 
along with Francisco Lindor and Andrelton Simmons. With just five errors 
in 574 chances, he posted an AL-best .991 fielding percentage. His 11.6
