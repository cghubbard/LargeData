The 2014 Detroit Tigers season was the team's 114th season. This was the 
team's first year under a mostly new coaching staff led by rookie Manager 
Brad Ausmus. On September 28, the last day of the regular season, the Tigers 
clinched the American League Central title with a 3–0 win over the Minnesota 
Twins. The Tigers finished one game ahead of the Kansas City Royals, with 
a 90–72 record. It was their fourth consecutive American League Central 
title. They became the first AL Central team to win four consecutive titles 
since the Cleveland Indians won five straight from 1995 to 1999, and the 
first Tigers team to ever make four consecutive postseason appearances.[1] 
Despite all of this, the Tigers' season ended on October 5 when they were 
swept by the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Division Series.[2] 
This snapped Detroit's streak of three consecutive American League Championship 
Series appearances. The Tigers sent three players to the 2014 All-Star 
Game. First baseman Miguel Cabrera was voted in as the starter at first 
base in the fan voting, while designated hitter Víctor Martínez and pitcher 
Max Scherzer were selected as reserves in the player voting.[66] Martínez 
did not participate in the All-Star game due to right side soreness, so 
his teammate, second baseman Ian Kinsler, took his place on the American 
League roster.[67] The Tigers had a chance to send a fourth player to the 
All-Star Game this season, as pitcher Rick Porcello was one of the five 
finalists for the AL in the All-Star Final Vote, but he was beaten out 
by Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox.[68] Scherzer became the winning 
pitcher of the game, the first Tiger to do so since Jim Bunning in 1957,[69] 
while Cabrera became the first Tiger to hit a home run in the All Star 
Game since Lou Whitaker did so in 1986.[70] Infielders Outfielders Coaches
