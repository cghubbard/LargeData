Jason Daniel Kendall (born June 26, 1974) is an American former professional 
baseball catcher who played in Major League Baseball from 1996 to 2010. 
He is the son of former catcher Fred Kendall, who played in the majors 
from 1969–1980. Kendall attended and played at Torrance High School in 
California, where he tied a national high school record by hitting safely 
in 43 straight games. He was drafted out of high school in the first round 
of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft (23rd overall pick) by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Kendall made his major league debut 1996. In his rookie year, 
he hit .300, made the National League All-Star Team, and was named NL rookie 
of the year by The Sporting News (he finished third in voting for the MLB 
Rookie of the Year award). He was also an All-Star in 1998 and 2000. In 
1999, he suffered a season-ending injury when he dislocated his ankle while 
running to first base in a July 4 game against Milwaukee after attempting 
to beat out a bunt.[1] On May 19, 2000, Kendall became the first Pirate 
to hit for the cycle in Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and Kris Benson 
pitched a three-hitter in a 13–1 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[2] 
On November 18, 2000, Kendall signed a six-year contract extension worth 
$60 million. The contract made him the second-highest-paid catcher at the 
time, behind Mike Piazza.[3] In 2002 and 2005, he led the majors in at-bats 
per strikeout (18.1 in 2002, 15.4 in 2005).[4] He also led the major leagues 
in 2005 in times reached base on an error (15).[5] From 2002 through 2004, 
Kendall led all major league catchers in games and innings behind the plate. 
He is the Pirates' all-time leader in games caught.[6] After the 2004 season, 
the Pirates traded Kendall and cash to the Oakland Athletics for Mark Redman, 
Arthur Rhodes and cash. During the 2005 season, Kendall struggled at the 
plate. His .321 slugging percentage was the worst (by 20 points) among 
all major league players who qualified for the batting title. His .271 
batting average was the second-lowest of his career. In the field, he allowed 
101 stolen bases, more than any other catcher in major league baseball. 
However, he did bat leadoff for Oakland, something that is very rare to 
see out of a baseball catcher. The 2006 season marked Kendall's first post-season 
appearance, as the Athletics clinched the 2006 American League Western 
Division championship on September 26. He recorded his first playoff hit 
in the second game of the American League Division Series off Minnesota's 
Boof Bonser. During a game against the Angels on May 2, 2006 Kendall was 
involved in another benches-clearing incident. John Lackey threw a pitch 
that started high and inside to Kendall, and then broke back towards the 
plate. Kendall stepped out of the batter's box and began yelling at Lackey, 
who told him to stop leaning over the plate with his elbow guard sticking 
out, trying to be hit by a pitch (as Kendall has been known to do throughout 
his career). Kendall then charged the mound and wrestled with the 6 ft 
4 in (1.93 m) Lackey. The two spun around as catcher Jeff Mathis fell behind 
Kendall who was then punched in the ribs by Lackey, and the two tumbled 
to the ground. On July 16, 2007, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs for 
fellow catcher Rob Bowen and minor league pitcher Jerry Blevins.[7] At 
the time of the trade, Kendall had the lowest on-base percentage (.261) 
and second lowest slugging percentage (.281) of any starter in major league 
baseball for 2007. In the field he allowed 111 stolen bases (131 attempts, 
20 caught), more than any other catcher in major league baseball. On November 
21, 2007, Kendall agreed to a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Brewers.[8] 
Kendall threw out roughly 40% of base stealers in 2008. Upon making his 
110th start of the 2008 season, Kendall fulfilled the option in his contract, 
securing himself a spot in the Brewers lineup in 2009. On May 18, 2009, 
Kendall recorded his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth full-time 
catcher to reach that milestone.[9] In 2009 he had the lowest slugging 
percentage of any starter in the major leagues, at .305.[10] During his 
two years with the Brewers his AVG, OBP, and SLG were .244, .329, and .315. 
On December 11, 2009, Kendall signed a two-year contract with the Kansas 
City Royals.[11] Kendall underwent season-ending surgery on September 3, 
2010, on his right shoulder after an MRI exam revealed extensive tearing 
in his rotator cuff.[12] He missed the entire 2011 season, because of this 
injury. He became a free agent after the 2011 season. Kendall signed with 
Kansas City on July 19, 2012 to a minor league contract.[13] He played 
in two games for the AA Northwest Arkansas Naturals before announcing his 
retirement on July 24.[14] He appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum 2016 election and earned two votes.[15] Kendall 
was known as a fundamentally sound catcher who was very good at blocking 
pitches and handling pitching staffs, despite a relatively weak throwing 
arm. At the plate, Kendall was known for his very open batting stance and 
was a contact hitter who tended to "crowd" the plate. He was known to not 
use batting gloves. He was known as fiercely competitive, and was involved 
in several bench-clearing brawls. Kendall was also hit by pitches frequently 
as a result of his batting stance; he was hit 254 times, which is fifth 
all-time. In addition to being a target for being hit by pitches, Kendall 
was also a stolen-base threat. His 189 stolen bases are second all-time 
in MLB history in the modern era to Roger Bresnahan for stolen bases by 
a player primarily playing catcher for his career. Kendall's plate discipline 
and rare speed at the catcher position also enabled him to be used as a 
leadoff hitter. Kendall started the game batting leadoff in 438 of his 
2,085 games played, including 119 of his 147 games in 2004 and 90 of his 
143 games in 2006 (leadoff is defined as starting the game as the first 
player to bat for his team and having at least two at-bats in the game). 
No other major-league catcher in the modern era of baseball has ever batted 
the majority of his team's games in the leadoff spot in any season[citation 
needed]. Kendall has written a book with Lee Judge: Throwback: A Big-League 
Catcher Tells How the Game Is Really Played, released in May 2014 by St.
