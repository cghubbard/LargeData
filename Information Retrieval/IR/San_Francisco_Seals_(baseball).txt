The San Francisco Seals were a minor league baseball team in San Francisco, 
California, that played in the Pacific Coast League from 1903 until 1957 
before transferring to Phoenix, Arizona. They were named for the abundant 
California sea lion and harbor seal populations in the Bay Area. Along 
with the Los Angeles Angels, Portland Beavers, Oakland Oaks, Sacramento 
Solons, and Seattle Indians, the Seals were charter members of the Pacific 
Coast League, which was founded in 1903. The team played their home games 
at Recreation Park at Harrison and 8th Streets until it was destroyed in 
the 1906 earthquake. The mild climate of the west coast allowed the PCL 
to play a much longer season than the major leagues and the other eastern 
professional baseball leagues. Seasons often ran 200 games or more, especially 
in the early years. In the 1905 season, the Seals set the all-time PCL 
record by playing 230 games (Pacific Coast Baseball League Record Book 
1903–1969, compiled by William J. Weiss, League Statistician; published 
by the PCL, 1969; p. 30). The Seals finished the 1906 season playing home 
games at Freeman's Park in Oakland. A new Recreation Park was constructed 
at 14th and Valencia Streets for the 1907 season. The Seals won their first 
PCL pennant in 1909, finishing 13 1⁄2 games over the runner-up Portland 
Beavers. They won flags also in 1915, 1917, 1922, 1923 and 1925. During 
the 1914 season, the Sacramento Solons were moved to San Francisco, where 
they finished out the season playing as the San Francisco Missions, representing 
the city's Mission District. The idea of a second team in San Francisco 
remained alive and, after the 1925 season, the Vernon Tigers were purchased 
by a group headed by San Francisco businessman Herbert Fleishhacker and 
moved to San Francisco and renamed the Mission Reds or simply the "Missions", 
again representing the Mission District as this team played their games 
five blocks from Mission San Francisco de Asís. From 1926 through 1930, 
they played their home games at Recreation Park, playing at home while 
the Seals were on the road. In 1918, financially strapped owner Henry Berry 
put the San Francisco Seals up for sale and Charles H. Strub, George Alfred 
(Alfie) Putnam and Charles H. Graham each acquired a one-third share in 
the team. In 1931, the Seals moved to their own park, Seals Stadium, an 
18,600-seat facility located at 16th and Bryant Streets. Seals Stadium 
was unusual in that it boasted three clubhouses: one for the visitors, 
one for the Seals, and one for the Missions, who moved there with the Seals 
and were the Seals' tenants from 1931 through 1937, after which the team 
moved back to Los Angeles to become the Hollywood Stars in 1938. There 
were three breweries on the adjoining northwest corners of Seals Stadium, 
which included Hamm's, Budweiser and Lucky Lager. The Seals celebrated 
their inaugural year in Seals Stadium by winning the PCL pennant in 1931. 
The following year, Seals outfielder Vince DiMaggio arranged a tryout for 
his younger brother Joe. In 1933, Joe DiMaggio hit safely in 61 straight 
games,[1] a harbinger of his 56-game hitting streak for the New York Yankees 
in 1941. The team won the pennant again in 1935. In 1945, a controlling 
interest in the team was purchased by businessman Paul Fagan, with the 
stated intention of bringing Major League Baseball to the west coast by 
having the Pacific Coast League becoming the nation's third major league. 
He spent thousands of dollars upgrading Seals Stadium to perceived major 
league standards. He hired former major league player Lefty O'Doul, a native 
San Franciscan and fan favorite, as manager. Though the Seals won the pennant 
in 1946, subsequent teams under Fagan's watch did not fare as well, typically 
finishing in the second division. Rival clubs did not buy into Fagan's 
major league ambitions. Rather, they established working agreements with 
major league teams, and fared better than did the independent Seals. Fagan 
gave up his aspirations and sold his interest in the Seals, who became 
an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. After their Bay Area rival, the Oakland 
Oaks, moved to Vancouver after the 1955 season, the Seals won their last 
PCL pennant in 1957, which proved to be their final season. During the 
1957 season, the New York Giants announced their move to San Francisco 
for the 1958 season, and the Seals were forced to relocate. The Seals moved 
to Phoenix, Arizona for the 1958 season. They became a minor league affiliate 
of the San Francisco Giants, and they were renamed the Phoenix Giants. 
The franchise then moved to Tacoma, Washington, where they played from 
1960 to 1965, returning to Phoenix for the 1966 season. The team remained 
in Phoenix until MLB expanded in 1998 with the Arizona Diamondbacks. This 
forced another move of the former Seals franchise. In a complicated deal 
the franchise became the Tucson Sidewinders, displacing the existing Tucson 
Toros, affiliated with the Diamondbacks. The Giants' affiliation was transferred 
to the displaced Tucson AAA franchise, which became today's Fresno Grizzlies. 
In 2009, the Tucson Sidewinders franchise moved to Reno, Nevada. They retained 
their affiliation with the Arizona Diamondbacks as the Reno Aces, and play 
their home games at Aces Ballpark. The Tucson Toros returned under the 
same ownership as the Sidewinders, but they are not affiliated with a major 
league club. The Sidewinders play their home games at Hi Corbett Field. 
The Giants played their home games at Seals Stadium in 1958 and 1959, moving 
to Candlestick Park in 1960. Seals Stadium was subsequently torn down to 
make way for a White Front store. When this chain of stores went out of 
business, the building stayed empty for some years. It was finally turned 
into a car dealership and later a Safeway grocery store. The legacy of 
the Seals lives on in the Giants' mascot Lou Seal, as well as in a statue 
of the Seals' cartoon mascot (c. 1947) at AT&T Park, and with a marker 
on the 16th & Bryant sidewalk placed where Seals Stadium home plate stood. 
The Seals were largely independent of major league farm systems except
