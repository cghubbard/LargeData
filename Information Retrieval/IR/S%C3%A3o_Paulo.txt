São Paulo (/ˌsaʊ ˈpaʊloʊ/; Portuguese pronunciation: [sɐ̃w ˈpawlu] ( listen); 
Saint Paul in English) is a municipality located in the southeast region 
of Brazil. The metropolis is an alpha global city—as listed by the GaWC—and 
is the most populous city in Brazil, the Americas, and the Southern Hemisphere. 
The municipality is also Earth's 12th largest city proper by population. 
The city is the capital of the homonymous state of São Paulo, Brazil's 
most populous and wealthiest state. It exerts strong international influence 
in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[2] The name of the city honors 
Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area of Greater São Paulo 
ranks as the most populous in Brazil, the 11th most populous on Earth, 
and largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. Having the largest economy 
by GDP in Latin America and Southern Hemisphere,[3] the city is home to 
the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Paulista Avenue is the economic core of São 
Paulo. The city has the 10th largest GDP in the world,[4] representing 
alone 10.7% of all Brazilian GDP[5] and 36% of the production of goods 
and services in the state of São Paulo, being home to 63% of established 
multinationals in Brazil,[6] and has been responsible for 28% of the national 
scientific production in 2005.[7] The metropolis is also home to several 
of the tallest buildings in Brazil, including the Mirante do Vale, Edifício 
Itália, Banespa, North Tower and many others. The city has cultural, economic 
and political influence both nationally and internationally. It is home 
to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, the 
Ibirapuera Park, Museum of Ipiranga, São Paulo Museum of Art, and the Museum 
of the Portuguese Language. The city holds events like the São Paulo Art 
Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, São Paulo Fashion Week and the ATP 
Brasil Open. São Paulo hosts the world's largest gay pride parade. It is 
headquarters of the Brazilian television networks Band, Gazeta, Record 
and SBT. São Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest 
Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods 
of Mercado, Bixiga, and Liberdade respectively. São Paulo is also home 
to the largest Jewish population in the country and one of the largest 
urban Jewish populations in the world.[8] In 2016, lived in the city native 
inhabitants from 196 different countries.[9] People from the city are known 
as paulistanos, while paulistas designates anyone from the state, including 
the paulistanos. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship 
and the aircraft carrier named after it, is Non ducor, duco, which translates 
as "I am not led, I lead."[10] The city, which is also colloquially known 
as Sampa or Terra da Garoa (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable 
weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, 
severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. According to a report from 2011, 
São Paulo was expected to have the third highest economic growth in the 
world between 2011 and 2025, after London and Mexico City.[11] São Paulo 
was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, 
the city hosted the IV Pan American Games and the São Paulo Indy 300. The 
Portuguese village of São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was marked by 
the founding of the Colégio de São Paulo de Piratininga on January 25, 
1554. The Jesuit college of twelve priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and 
José de Anchieta, and their structure was located on top of a steep hill 
between the rivers Anhangabaú and Tamanduateí.[12] They first had a small 
structure built of rammed earth, made by the Indian workers in their traditional 
style. The priests wanted to evangelize – teach (catechesis) the Indians 
who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. 
The site was separated from the coast by the Serra do Mar, called by the 
Indians Serra Paranapiacaba.[13] The name of the college was chosen as 
it was founded on the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle Paul 
of Tarsus. Father José de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the 
Society of Jesus:[13] The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College 
began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de Sá, Governor-General of Brazil, 
the Captaincy of São Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population 
of the Village of Santo André da Borda do Campo to the vicinity of the 
college. It was then named "College of St. Paul Piratininga". The new location 
was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the lowland do Carmo. 
It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was 
renamed Vila de São Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of São Vicente.[13] 
For the next two centuries, São Paulo developed as a poor and isolated 
village that survived largely through the mostly native population's cultivation 
of subsistence crops. For a long time, São Paulo was the only village in 
Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult to reach the area. Mem de 
Sá forbade colonists to use the "Path Piraiquê" (Piaçaguera today), because 
of frequent Indian raids along it.[13] On March 22, 1681, the Marquis de 
Cascais, the donee of the Captaincy of São Vicente, moved the capital to 
the village of St. Paul, designating it the "Head of the captaincy." The 
new capital was established on April 23, 1683, with public celebrations.[13] 
In the 17th century, São Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese 
colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because 
they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African 
slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the 
region of Minas Gerais, in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers 
to São Paulo. The Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas do Ouro was created 
on November 3, 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies 
of São Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.[13] Conveniently 
located in the country, up the steep Serra do Mar sea ridge when travelling 
from Santos, while also not too far from the coastline, São Paulo became 
a safe place to stay for tired travellers. The town became a centre for 
the bandeirantes, intrepid explorers who marched into unknown lands in 
search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to make slaves 
of. The bandeirantes, which could be translated as "flag-bearers" or "flag-followers", 
organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and 
the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the 
local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. 
The bandeirantes eventually became politically powerful as a group, and 
were considered responsible for the expulsion of the Jesuits from the city 
of São Paulo in 1640, after a series of conflicts between the Jesuits and 
the bandeirantes over the trade of Indian slaves.[13] On July 11, 1711, 
the town of São Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold 
was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiabá and Goiania. 
The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas 
Line.[13] When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, São Paulo shifted 
to growing sugar cane, which spread through the interior of the Captaincy. 
The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first 
modern highway between São Paulo and the coast was constructed and named 
the Walk of Lorraine.[13] Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor 
of the State of São Paulo, located in the city of São Paulo, is called 
the Palácio dos Bandeirantes (Palace of Bandeirantes), in the neighbourhood 
of Morumbi.[13] After Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1823, 
as declared by Dom Pedro I where the Monument of Ipiranga is located, he 
named São Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded 
at the Convent of São Francisco, these days a part of the University of 
São Paulo. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the 
city's growth, thanks to which the city became the Imperial City and Borough 
of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga.[13] The expansion of coffee production 
was a major factor in the growth of São Paulo, as it became the region's 
chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially 
in the Vale do Paraíba (Paraíba Valley) region in the East of the State 
of São Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, São Carlos 
and Ribeirão Preto.[13] From 1869 onwards, São Paulo was connected to the 
port of Santos by the Railroad Santos-Jundiaí, nicknamed The Lady. In the 
late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the 
state capital. São Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads 
from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major 
economic and population growth in the State of São Paulo.[13] In 1888, 
the "Golden Law" (Lei Áurea) was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial 
of Brazil, declaring abolished the slavery institution in Brazil. Slaves 
were the main source of labour in the coffee plantations until then. As 
a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards 
the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number 
of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many 
of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began 
to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to 
learn Portuguese.[13] By the time Brazil became a republic on November 
15, 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of São Paulo's economy. 
São Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with 
the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an 
alliance that became known as "coffee and milk", given that Minas Gerais 
was famous for its dairy produce.[13] Industrialization was the economic 
cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious 
families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories 
began to arise and São Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The 
cultural scene followed modernist and naturalist tendencies in fashion 
at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist 
artists are poets Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita 
Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret. 
The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was 
an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art.[13] São Paulo's 
main economic activities derive from the services industry—factories are 
since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, 
consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape 
in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Brás. Some cities around São Paulo, 
such as Diadema, São Bernardo do Campo, Santo André, and Cubatão are still 
heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from 
cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.[13] This "revolution" is considered 
by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's 
history. On July 9, 1932, the population of São Paulo town rose against 
a coup d'état by Getúlio Vargas to take the presidential office. The movement 
grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, 
unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also 
affected São Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the 
term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor 
of São Paulo Júlio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously 
overthrowing President Washington Luís, who was governor of São Paulo from 
1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.[13] The 
uprising commenced on July 9, 1932, after four protesting students were 
killed by federal government troops on May 23, 1932. On the wake of their 
deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each 
of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. 
A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.[13] 
In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. 
Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful 
states, (Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul), the politicians from São 
Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated 
into actual support, and the São Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on 
October 2, 1932. In total, there were 87 days of fighting (July 9 to October 
4, 1932—with the last two days after the surrender of São Paulo), with 
a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report 
up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of São Paulo suffered damage 
due to fighting.[13] There is an obelisk in front of Ibirapuera Park that 
serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The University 
of São Paulo's Law School also pays homage to the students that died during 
this period with plaques hung on its arcades.[13] São Paulo is located 
in Southeastern Brazil, in southeastern São Paulo State, approximately 
halfway between Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro. The city is located on a plateau 
located beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for "Sea Range" or "Coastal 
Range"), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, 
with an average elevation of around 799 metres (2,621 ft) above sea level, 
although being at a distance of only about 70 kilometres (43 mi) from the 
Atlantic Ocean. The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and 
the Imigrantes, (see "Transportation" below) that roll down the range, 
leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guarujá. Rolling 
terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of São Paulo except in its 
northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation 
and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically 
stable and no significant seismic activity has ever been recorded.[15] 
São Paulo is divided into 32 subprefectures, each one divided into several 
districts.[16] The city also has a radial division into nine zones for 
purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which don't fit into the administrative 
divisions. These zones are identified by colours in the street signs. Most 
of the economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area called 
"extended downtown" (Centro Expandido), composed by six subprefectures: 
Sé, Lapa, Pinheiros, Vila Mariana, Ipiranga and Mooca. The Subprefecture 
of Butantã, outside this area, hosts the main campus of the University 
of São Paulo and the headquarters of the Government of State of São Paulo. 
Other two subprefectures, Santo Amaro and Santana-Tucuruvi also host important 
touristic and economic facilities. The nonspecific term "Grande São Paulo" 
("Greater São Paulo") covers multiple definitions. The legally defined 
Região Metropolitana de São Paulo consists of 39 municipalities in total 
and a population of 21.1 million[17] inhabitants (as of the 2014 National 
Census[update]). The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo is known as the financial, 
economic and cultural center of Brazil. The largest municipalities are 
Guarulhos with a population of more than 1 million people, plus several 
municipalities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as São Bernardo 
do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo André (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. 
The ABC Region in the south of Grande São Paulo is an important location 
for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[18] Because 
São Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan 
area called Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo. Analogous to the 
BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the 
world, with 32 million inhabitants,[19] behind Tokyo, which includes 4 
contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and 3 microregions. The 
Tietê River and its tributary, the Pinheiros River, were once important 
sources of fresh water and leisure for São Paulo. However, heavy industrial 
effluents and wastewater discharges in the later 20th century caused the 
rivers to become heavily polluted. A substantial clean-up program for both 
rivers is underway, financed through a partnership between local government 
and international development banks such as the Japan Bank for International 
Cooperation. Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through 
the city, although water transportation becomes increasingly important 
on the Tietê river further downstream (near river Paraná), as the river 
is part of the River Plate basin.[20] No large natural lakes exist in the 
region, but the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs in the city's southern 
outskirts are used for power generation, water storage and leisure activities, 
such as sailing. The original flora consisted mainly of broadleaf evergreens. 
Non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall 
permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be 
cultivated, especially the ubiquitous eucalyptus.[21] In 2015, São Paulo 
experienced a major drought, which led several cities in the state to start 
a rationing system.[22] The city has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical 
climate (Cfa), according to the Köppen classification.[23] In summer (January 
through March), the mean low temperature is about 17 °C (63 °F) and the 
mean high temperatures is near 28 °C (82 °F). In winter, temperatures tend 
to range between 11 and 23 °C (52 and 73 °F). The recorded high was 37.8 °C 
(100.0 °F) on October 17, 2014[24] and the lowest −2 °C (28 °F) on August 
2, 1955 and on the same day −3.8 °C (25.2 °F) was recorded unofficially. 
Temperature averages are similar to those of Sydney and Los Angeles. The 
Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23°27' S, passes through north of São Paulo 
and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas 
of South America. Because of its elevation, however, São Paulo enjoys a 
temperate climate.[25] The city experiences four seasons. The winter is 
mild and sub-dry, and the summer is moderately warm and rainy. Fall and 
spring are transitional seasons. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further 
away from the center, in some winters throughout the city. Regions further 
away from the center and in cities in the metropolitan area, can reach 
temperatures next to 0 °C (32 °F), or even lower in the winter. Rainfall 
is abundant, annually averaging 1,454 millimetres (57.2 in).[27] It is 
especially common in the warmer months averaging 219 millimetres (8.6 in) 
and decreases in winter, averaging 47 millimetres (1.9 in). Neither São 
Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and 
tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the 
city experiences the phenomenon known as "veranico" or "verãozinho" ("little 
summer"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures 
well above 28 °C (82 °F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during 
summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. On 
such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20 °C (68 °F), accompanied 
by lows often below 15 °C (59 °F), however, summer can be extremely hot 
when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34 °C (93 °F), 
but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the 
temperature can feel like 39 °C (102 °F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. 
In the summer of 2012, São Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted 
for 2 weeks with highs going from 29 to 34 °C (84 to 93 °F) on the hottest 
days. Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, 
São Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[28] 
Due to the altitude of the city, there are few hot nights in São Paulo 
even in the summer months, with minimum temperatures rarely exceeding 21 °C 
(69 °F). In winter, however, the strong inflow of cold fronts accompanied 
by excessive cloudiness and polar air cause very low temperatures, even 
in the afternoon. Afternoons with maximum temperatures ranging between 
13 and 15 °C (55 and 59 °F) are common even during the fall and early spring. 
During the winter, there have been several recent records of cold afternoons, 
as on July 24, 2013 in which the maximum temperature was 8 °C (46 °F) and 
the wind chill hit 0 °C (32 °F) during all afternoon. São Paulo is known 
for its rapidly changing weather. Locals say that all four seasons can 
be experienced in one day. In the morning, when winds blow from the ocean, 
the weather can be cool or sometimes even cold. When the sun hits its peak, 
the weather can be extremely dry and hot. When the sun sets, the cold wind 
comes back bringing cool temperatures. This phenomenon happens usually 
in the winter. In 2013, São Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil 
and in South America.[38] According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 
11,244,369 people residing in the city of São Paulo.[39] The census found 
6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 
736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian 
people (0.2%).[40] In 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples 
and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of São Paulo was 52.6% female 
and 47.4% male.[40] São Paulo is considered the most multicultural city 
in Brazil. Since 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived 
in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one 
of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the ten million 
inhabitants of São Paulo, 60% (six million people) have full or partial 
Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any other 
Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.5 million inhabitants).[42] 
Even today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Bras and 
Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, 
the Italian and the dialects were spoken as much as the Portuguese in the 
city, which influenced the formation of the São Paulo dialect of today. 
Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day. The 
Portuguese community is also large, and it is estimated that three million 
paulistanos have some origin in Portugal. The Jewish colony is more than 
60,000 people in São Paulo and is concentrated mainly in Higienópolis and 
Bom Retiro. From the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth 
century, São Paulo also received German immigrants (in the current neighborhood 
of Santo Amaro), Spanish and Lithuanian (in the neighborhood Vila Zelina). 
A French observer, travelling to São Paulo at the time, noted that there 
was a division of the capitalist class, by nationality (...) Germans, French 
and Italians shared the dry goods sector with Brazilians. Foodstuffs was 
generally the province of either Portuguese or Brazilians, except for bakery 
and pastry which was the domain of the French and Germans. Shoes and tinware 
were mostly controlled by Italians. However, the larger metallurgical plants 
were in the hands of the English and the Americans. (...) Italians outnumbered 
Brazilians two to one in São Paulo.[44] Until 1920, 1,078,437 Italians 
entered in the State of São Paulo. Of the immigrants who arrived there 
between 1887 and 1902, 63.5% came from Italy. Between 1888 and 1919, 44.7% 
of the immigrants were Italians, 19.2% were Spaniards and 15.4% were Portuguese.[45] 
In 1920, nearly 80% of São Paulo city's population was composed of immigrants 
and their descendants and Italians made up over half of its male population.[45] 
At that time, the Governor of São Paulo said that "if the owner of each 
house in São Paulo display the flag of the country of origin on the roof, 
from above São Paulo would look like an Italian city". In 1900, a columnist 
who was absent from São Paulo for 20 years wrote "then São Paulo used to 
be a genuine Paulista city, today it is an Italian city."[45] Research 
conducted by the University of São Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic 
diversity: when asked if they are "descendants of foreign immigrants", 
81% of the students reported "yes". The main reported ancestries were: 
Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German 
(5.6%), Brazilian (4.3%), African (2.8%), Arab (2.4%) and Jewish (1.2%).[46] 
Since the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil 
into São Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained 
huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural 
areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated 
migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy 
areas of the city, in cortiços, in slums (favelas) of the metropolis, because 
they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants 
was found in the area of Sé/Brás (districts of Brás, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, 
Pari and Sé). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[47] [48] 
The main groups, considering all the metropolitan area, are: 6 million 
people of Italian descent,[49] 3 million people of Portuguese descent,[50] 
1.7 million people of African descent,[51] 1 million people of Arab descent,[52] 
665,000 people of Japanese descent,[52] 400,000 people of German descent,[52] 
250,000 people of French descent,[52] 150,000 people of Greek descent,[52] 
120,000 people of Chinese descent,[52] 120,000–300,000 Bolivian immigrants,[53] 
50,000 people of Korean descent,[54] and 40,000 Jews.[55] São Paulo is 
also receiving waves of immigration from Haiti and from many countries 
of Africa. Those immigrants are mainly concentrated in Praca da Sé, Glicério 
and Vale do Anhangabaú [central zone of the city]. Haitians are a group 
in the city. African immigrants are also a growing group in the city and 
metropolitan area. Changing demographics of the city of São Paulo Source: 
Planet Barsa Ltda.[56] Source: IBGE 2010.[57] The primary language is Portuguese. 
The general language from São Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern 
Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now São Vicente, São 
Paulo, and the upper Tietê River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken 
in São Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 
on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced 
through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The 
original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, 
and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, 
Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken 
in the metropolitan area of São Paulo reflects influences from those languages. 
The Italian influence in São Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods 
such as Bela Vista, Moóca, Brás and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese 
and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. 
The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs 
of Adoniran Barbosa, a Brazilian samba singer born to Italian parents who 
used to sing using the local accent.[58] Other languages spoken in the 
city are mainly among the Asian community: the Liberdade neighborhood is 
home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Although today most 
Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent 
in Japanese. Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to 
speak their ancestral languages.[59] In some areas it is still possible 
to find descendants of immigrants who speak German[60] (especially in the 
area of Brooklin paulista) and Russian or East European languages (especially 
in the area of Vila Zelina).[61] In the west zone of São Paulo, specially 
at Vila Anastácio and Lapa region, there is a Hungarian colony, with three 
churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible 
to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks. Since the beginning 
of the 20th century, São Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin 
America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports 
(from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy 
coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned São Paulo 
into Brazil's largest industrial hub. São Paulo's most recent mayors were: 
São Paulo is twinned with:[66][67] São Paulo has the following partner 
cities: São Paulo is considered the "financial capital of Brazil", as it 
is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks 
and financial institutions. São Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and 
the 10th largest in the world,[74] using Purchasing power parity.[75] According 
to data of IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion,[76] 
approximately US$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production 
of goods and services of the State of São Paulo.[77] According to PricewaterhouseCoopers 
average annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%.[78] São Paulo also 
has a large "informal" economy.[79] In 2005, the city of São Paulo collected 
R$90 billion in taxes and the city budget was R$15 billion. The city has 
1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.[80] As of 2014[update], São 
Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, 
PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year São Paulo's exported goods totaled 
$7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports. The top five commodities 
exported by São Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), 
sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).[81] The São Paulo Stock 
Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bond exchange. It 
is the largest stock exchange in Latin America, trading about R$6 billion 
(US$3.5 billion) every day.[82] São Paulo's economy is going through a 
deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, São 
Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary 
sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian 
cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[83] 63% of all the 
international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices 
in São Paulo. São Paulo has the largest concentration of German businesses 
worldwide[84] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[85] 
São Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking 
of Cities of the Future 2013/14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin 
American City of the Future 2013/14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the 
first city in the previous ranking. Santiago now ranks second, followed 
by Rio de Janeiro.[86] The per capita income for the city was R$32,493 
in 2008.[87] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living 
for expatriate employees, São Paulo is now among the ten most expensive 
cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead 
of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[88][89] The city of São Paulo 
is home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due 
to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology 
and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, 
mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the 
State of São Paulo (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – 
FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological 
research.[91] Luxury brands tend to concentrate their business in São Paulo. 
Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping 
malls as well as the Jardins district, which is more or less the Brazilian's 
Rodeo Drive version, attract most of the world's luxurious brands. Most 
of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade 
Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or 
Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district. They are home of brands such as Cartier, 
Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany 
& Co. Cidade Jardim was opened in São Paulo in 2008, it is a 45,000-square-metre 
(484,376-square-foot) mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, 
with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury 
brands such as Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera. Opened in 
2012, JK shopping mall has brought to Brazil brands that were not present 
in the country before such as Goyard, Tory Burch, Llc., Prada, and Miu 
Miu.[92] The Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest 
mall, opened in 1966.[93] The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the 
most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels. 
The New York Times once compared Oscar Freire Street to Rodeo Drive.[94] 
In Jardins there are luxury car dealers. One of the world's best restaurants 
as elected by The World's 50 Best Restaurants Award, D.O.M.,[95] is located 
there. Large hotel chains whose target audience is the corporate traveller 
are in the city. São Paulo is the home of the 75% of the main business 
fairs of the country. The city also promotes one of the most important 
fashion weeks in the world, São Paulo Fashion Week, established in 1996 
under the name Morumbi Fashion Brasil, is the largest and most important 
fashion event in Latin America.[96] Besides, the São Paulo Gay Pride Parade, 
held since 1997 on Paulista Avenue towards combating homophobia, is the 
event that attracts more tourists to the city.[97] In addition, São Paulo 
hosts the annual São Paulo Pancake Cook-Off in which chefs from across 
Brazil and the world participate in competitions based on the cooking of 
pancakes.[98] Cultural tourism also has relevance to the city, especially 
when taking into view the international events that take place in the metropolis, 
such as the São Paulo Art Biennial, that attracted almost 1 million people 
in 2004.[99] The city has a nightlife that is considered one of the best 
in the country. There are cinemas, theaters, museums and cultural centers. 
The Rua Oscar Freire was named one of the eight most luxurious streets 
in the world, according to the Mystery Shopping International,[100] and 
São Paulo the 25th "most expensive city" of the planet.[101] According 
to the International Congress & Convention Association, São Paulo ranks 
first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 
12th in the world, after the Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, 
Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon and Copenhague.[102] According 
to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, São Paulo was 
the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City 
and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 
billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region). In 2014, 
CNN ranked nightlife São Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind 
New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.[103] The cuisine of the region 
is a tourist attraction. The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.[104] 
During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism 
(Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of "World Gastronomy 
Capital" from a commission formed by representatives of 43 nations.[105] 
São Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban 
planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, 
Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, 
the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis 
through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[106] 
Urban growth in São Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning 
of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th 
Century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different 
social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; 
from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery 
social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central 
and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing 
in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought 
the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls 
and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the 
name of security.[107] Thus, São Paulo differs considerably from other 
Brazilian cities such as Belo Horizonte and Goiânia, whose initial expansion 
followed determinations by a plan, or a city like Brasília, whose master 
plan had been fully developed prior to construction.[108] The effectiveness 
of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. 
Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively 
for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working 
classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In São 
Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of "demolish 
and rebuild", including former Mayor Prestes Maia São Paulo's road plan 
(known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tietê 
River. The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought 
to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This 
plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate 
speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods . The 
plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace 
the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.[109] This contributed 
to the outwards expansion of São Paulo and the peripherization of poorer 
residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted 
mainly of self-built single-family houses.[107] In 1968 the Urban Development 
Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of São Paulo, under 
the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. 
It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master 
Plan.[110] That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated "Z1" areas (residential 
areas designed for elites) and "Z3" (a "mixed zone" lacking clear definitions 
about their characteristics). Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with 
minimal control and major speculation.[111] After the 1970s peripheral 
lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, 
driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers were now unable to 
purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a 
housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (cortiços) 
appeared.[112] These housing types were often located closer to the center 
of the city: favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously 
been utilized (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned 
buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back 
into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots that had not yet been 
occupied by urbanization—alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between 
bridges.[113] By 1993, 19.8% of São Paulo’s population lived in favelas, 
compared to 5.2% in 1980.[114] Today, 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, 
while this only represents 11% of the total population.[115] São Paulo 
has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical 
schools. More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly 
the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school. There 
are 578 universities in the state of São Paulo.[116] The universities and 
colleges include: São Paulo is the largest health care hub in Latin America. 
Among its hospitals are the Albert Einstein Israelites Hospital, ranked 
as the best in Latin America and the Hospital das Clínicas, the largest 
in the region. The private health care sector is very large and most of 
Brazil's best hospitals are located in the city. As of September 2009, 
the city of São Paulo had:[117] The municipal government operates public 
health facilities across the city's territory, with 770 primary health 
care units (UBS), ambulatory and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals. The 
Municipal Secretary of Health has 59,000 employees, including 8,000 physicians 
and 12,000 nurses. 6,000,000 citizens uses the facilities, which provide 
drugs at no cost and manage an extensive family health program (PSF – Programa 
de Saúde da Família). The Rede São Paulo Saudável (Healthy São Paulo Network) 
is a satellite-based digital TV corporate channel, developed by the Municipal 
Health Secretary of São Paulo, bringing programs focused on health promotion 
and health education, which may be watched by citizens seeking health care 
in its units in the city. The network consists of two studios and a system 
for transmission of closed digital video in high definition via satellite, 
with about 1,400 points of reception in all health care units of the municipality 
of São Paulo. Automobiles are the main means to get into the city. In March 
2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.[118] Heavy traffic 
is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common 
on its highways. The city is crossed by 10 major motorways: From the 1940s 
to the 1980s, many roads and buildings were built without major planning. 
Ex-governor Mário Covas sponsored a ring road that circles the city, called 
Rodoanel Mario Covas,[119] and is being built by DERSA.[120] São Paulo 
has two main airports, São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport (IATA: 
GRU) for international flights and Congonhas-São Paulo Airport (IATA: CGH) 
for domestic and regional flights. Another airport, the Campo de Marte 
Airport, serves light aircraft. The three airports together moved 42,617,779 
passengers in 2010, making São Paulo one of the top 20 busiest in the world, 
by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater São Paulo is 
also served by São José dos Campos Airport and Viracopos-Campinas International 
Airport. Congonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Belo 
Horizonte and Brasília. In the latest upgrade, eight boarding bridges were 
installed to provide more comfort to passengers by eliminating the need 
to walk in the open to their flights. The terminal area was expanded from 
37.3 thousand square metres (0.4 million square feet) to over 51 thousand 
square metres (0.55 million square feet). This expansion was to satisfy 
current demand rather than to raise capacity. Built in the 1930s, it was 
designed to handle 6 million passengers a year and was struggling to handle 
12 million instead.[121] São Paulo-Guarulhos International, also known 
as "Cumbica" is 25 km (16 mi) north-east of the city center, in the neighbouring 
city of Guarulhos. Every day nearly 100 thousand people pass through the 
airport, which connects Brazil to 28 countries around the world. 370 companies 
operate there, generating 53 thousand jobs. With capacity to serve 15 million 
passengers a year, in two terminals, the airport currently handles 32 million 
users. Construction of a third passenger terminal is pending, to raise 
yearly capacity to more than 60 million passengers. The project, in the 
financing phase, is part of the airport’s master plan and will get under 
way shortly. São Paulo International Airport is also the main air cargo 
hubs in Brazil. The roughly 100 flights a day carry everything from fruits 
grown in the São Francisco Valley to locally manufactured medicine. The 
airport's cargo terminal is South America's largest. In 2003, over 75 thousand 
metric tons of freight passed through the terminal.[123] Campo de Marte 
is located in Santana district, the northern zone of São Paulo. The airport 
handles small aircraft, including air taxi firms. Opened in 1935, Campo 
de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil. It has 
no scheduled service, but its terminal is equipped with a snack bar, restaurant 
and bank branch. This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police 
Air Tactical Unit, the State Military Police Radio Patrol Unit and the 
São Paulo Flying Club.[124] From this airport, passengers can take advantage 
of some one hundred remote helipads and heliports to bypass heavy road 
traffic.[125] Campo de Marte also hosts the Ventura Goodyear Blimp. The 
two major São Paulo railway stations are Luz and Julio Prestes in the Luz/Campos 
Eliseos region. Luz is the seat of the Santos-Jundiaí line which historically 
transported international immigrants from the Santos port to São Paulo 
and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of Campinas. Julio 
Prestes connected Southwest São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State to 
São Paulo. Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which 
they headed to the Atlantic ocean and overseas. Julio Prestes stopped transporting 
passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has limited 
suburban service. Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded 
by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into 
the São Paulo Hall. Luz Station was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil. 
It has an underground station and is still active with east and westbound 
suburban trains that link São Paulo to the Greater São Paulo region to 
the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in Jundiaí in the western 
part of the State. Luz Station is surrounded by important cultural institutions 
such as the Pinacoteca do Estado, The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes 
Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others. Although poorly maintained by heavy 
rail services, a high-speed railway service is proposed to link São Paulo 
and Rio de Janeiro.[126] The trains are projected to reach 280 kilometres 
per hour (170 mph), taking about 90 minutes. Another important project 
is the "Expresso Bandeirantes," a medium-speed rail service (about 160 km/h) 
from São Paulo to Campinas, which would reduce the journey time from 90 
minutes by car to about 50 minutes, linking São Paulo, Jundiaí, Campinas 
Airport and Campinas city center. This service is also to connect to the 
railway service between São Paulo city center and Guarulhos Airport. Work 
on an express railway service between São Paulo city center and Guarulhos 
International Airport were announced by the São Paulo state government 
in 2007.[127] São Paulo has three rapid transport systems: the underground 
rail system (called "metrô", short for "metropolitano"), with five lines; 
the suburban rail system, Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM), 
has six lines that serve many regions not reached by the underground system 
and even some other cities in the metropolitan region; and the CPTM network 
is longer than the underground rail system. The fast-lane bus system: there 
are many such bus lines in the city, called "Passa Rápido," which are street-level, 
placed on large avenues and connected with the underground or suburban 
train stations. The city has 379 kilometres (235 mi) of rail operated by 
three companies. The São Paulo Metro operates 69.0 km (42.9 mi) of underground 
railway systems (34.6 km (21.5 mi) fully underground)[129] locally known 
as the Metrô), with 5 lines in operation and 59 stations. Companhia Paulista 
de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM, or "Paulista Company of Metropolitan Trains") 
railway add 260.7 km (162.0 mi). The third company is Via4. The underground 
and railway lines carry some 7 million people on an average weekday. The 
projects would expand São Paulo's urban railway system from the current 
322 km (200 mi) to more than 500 km (310 mi), surpassing the London Underground.[130] 
São Paulo has no tram lines, although trams were common in the first half 
of the 20th century.[131] São Paulo's underground train system is overcrowded, 
but was certified by the NBR ISO 9001. It has five lines and links to the 
metropolitan train network. The São Paulo Metro hascreachedlast year[when?] 
reached the mark of 11.5 million passengers on mile of line, 15% higher 
than in 2008, when 10 million users were taken per mile. It is the largest 
concentration of people in a single transport system in the world, according 
to the company.[132] Bus transport (government and private) is composed 
of 17,000 buses (including about 290 trolley buses).[134] The traditional 
system of informal transport (dab vans) was later reorganized and legalized. 
São Paulo Tietê Bus Terminal is the second largest bus terminal in the 
world. It serves localities across the nation, with the exception of the 
states of Amazonas, Roraima and Amapá. Routes to 1,010 cities in five countries 
(Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay) are available. It connects 
to all regional airports and a ride sharing automobile service to Santos. 
The Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal is much smaller and is connected 
to the Palmeiras-Barra Funda metro and Palmeiras-Barra Funda CPTM stations. 
It serves the southwestern cities of Sorocaba, Itapetininga, Itu, Botucatu, 
Bauru, Marília, Jaú, Avaré, Piraju, Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo, Ipaussu, Chavantes 
and Ourinhos (on the border with Paraná State). It also serves São José 
do Rio Preto, Araçatuba and other small towns located on the northwest 
of São Paulo State. Buses to São Paulo coast are available at the Jabaquara 
metro station, which is the final southbound stop on Line 1 (Blue) of the 
São Paulo Metro. The Litoral bus terminal serves Praia Grande, Santos and 
São Vicente on the South Shore and Mongaguá, Bertioga and Guarujá on the 
North Shore. Buses to North Shore cities such as Maresia, Riviera de São 
Lourenço, Caraguatatuba, Ubatuba and Paraty, in Rio de Janeiro State must 
be taken at the Tietê Bus Terminal, at Portuguesa-Tietê metro station on 
Line 1 (Blue). On October 26, 2013, hundreds of people attacked the bus 
station in São Paulo, setting fire to a bus and destroying cash and ticket 
machines. At least six people were arrested in the protests.[135] São Paulo 
has the largest number of helicopters in the world. The second and third 
positions are of New York City and Tokyo. With 420 helicopters[136] in 
2012 and around 2,000 flights per day within the central area, the city 
is, according to The Guardian, turning into a "real life South-American 
episode of The Jetsons".[137] In 2016, the ride-sharing company Uber offered 
a helicopter service on a test basis for one month, using three existing 
operators in the city.[138] Helicopters enable businessmen and workers 
to sharply reduce time spent moving around and commuting. Some companies 
own their helicopters, others lease them and still others use helicopter 
taxi services. One suburban helicopter shuttle service, located about 15 
miles (24 km) from the center of the city in Tamboré, is operated totally 
by women, including its pilots. Adoniran Barbosa was a samba singer and 
composer who became successful during São Paulo's early radio era. Born 
in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa was known as the "composer to 
the masses", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of 
Bela Vista, also known as "Bexiga" and Brás, as well as those who lived 
in the city's many 'cortiços' or tenements. His songs drew from the life 
of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first 
big hit was "Saudosa Maloca" ("Shanty of Fond Memories" – 1951), wherein 
three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, 
which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 
Trem das Onze ("The 11 pm Train"), became one of the five best samba songs 
ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer 
because he has to catch the last train to the Jaçanã suburb, for his mother 
will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with 
a similar style is Paulo Vanzolini. Vanzolini is a PhD in Biology and a 
part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder 
scene in São Paulo called "Ronda". In the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock 
band called Os Mutantes became popular. Their success is related to that 
of other tropicalia musicians. The group were known as very paulistanos 
in their behaviour and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before 
lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to join another group called Tutti 
Frutti. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful 
abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, Tecnicolor, an album recorded in the early 
1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by Sean 
Lennon.[139] In the early 1980s, a band called Ultraje a Rigor (Elegant 
Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The 
lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society 
was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, 
perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended 
recession. Bands originating from this movement include Ira!, Titãs, Ratos 
de Porão and Inocentes. In the 1990s, drum and bass arose as another musical 
movement in São Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick 
and Fernanda Porto.[140] Many heavy metal bands also originated in São 
Paulo, such as Angra, Torture Squad, Korzus and Dr. Sin. Famous electro-pop 
band Cansei de Ser Sexy, or CSS (Portuguese for "tired of being sexy") 
also has its origins in the city. Many of the most important classical 
Brazilian living composers, such as Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and 
Edson Zampronha, were born and live in São Paulo. Local baritone Paulo 
Szot has won international acclaim and a Tony Award nomination for his 
performance in a 2008 revival of South Pacific. The São Paulo State Symphony 
is one of the world's outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning 
in 2012 is the noted American conductor Marin Alsop. In 1952, Heitor Villa-Lobos 
wrote his Symphony Number 10 ('Ameríndia') for the 400th anniversary of 
São Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city 
told through the eyes of its founder Jose de Anchieta.[141] São Paulo's 
opera houses are: São Paulo Municipal Theater, Theatro São Pedro and Alfa 
Theater, for the symphonic concerts there is the Sala São Paulo, the latter 
being the headquarters of OSESP, an orchestra. The city hosts several music 
halls. The main ones are: Citibank Hall, HSBC Music Hall, Olympia, Via 
Funchal, Villa Country, Kezebre Rock Bar, Arena Anhembi and Espaco das 
Américas. The Sambadrome hosts musical presentations as well. Other facilities 
include the new Praça das Artes, with the Municipal Conservatory of Music 
Chamber Hall and others venues, like, Cultura Artistica, Teatro Sérgio 
Cardoso with a venue for only dance performances and Herzog & DeMeron's 
Centro Cultural Luz, for Ballet, Opera, theater and concerts, with three 
huge halls. The auditorium of the Latin-American Cultural Center, The Mozarteum, 
holds concerts through the year. Festivals as the Virada Cultural "Cultural 
Overnight" happen once a year and holds hundreds of attractions spread 
throughout the city. São Paulo was home to the first Jesuit missionaries 
in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese 
crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed poetry 
and music for the catechism, creating the first written works from the 
area. The literary priests included Manuel da Nóbrega and José de Anchieta, 
living in or near the colony then called Piratininga. They also helped 
to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar. In 1922, the 
Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in São Paulo, began to achieve cultural 
independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as 
the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural independence 
came more gradually.[142] Brazilian elite culture was originally strongly 
tied to Portugal. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work 
that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former 
slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture. Subsequent 
infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of 
influences. Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical 
modernists. With the urban poems of "Paulicéia Desvairada" and "Carefree 
Paulistan land" (1922), Mário de Andrade established the movement in Brazil. 
His rhapsodic novel Macunaíma (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, 
represents the apex of modernism's nationalist prose through its creation 
of an offbeat native national hero. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, 
avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and 
provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition. Modernist 
artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch 
their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European 
culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, 
Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue 
and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving 
as if Brazilian culture did not matter.[143] Many historians believe that 
the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in São Paulo. The Portuguese 
Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta (1534–1597) wrote short plays that were 
performed and watched by the Tupi–Guarani natives. In the second half of 
the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. European 
ethnic groups began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities. 
The most important period for the art in São Paulo was the 1940s. São Paulo 
had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia, (Brazilian 
Theater of Comedy), along with others. During the 1960s, major theater 
productions in São Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro 
de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dramática (Drama 
Art School), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled 
with the play "Eles não usam black tie" by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri which 
was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature labor workers 
as protagonists.[144] After the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing 
on Brazilian history (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina 
supported the democratic resistance during the military dictatorship period, 
marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number 
of plays represented historic moments, notably "O Rei da Vela", "Galileu 
Galilei" (1968), "Na Sela das Cidades" (1969) and "Gracias Señor" (1972).[145] 
The district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of theaters, almost 
30 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other 
reasons. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, Bibi 
Ferreira, Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, 
Àgora, Cacilda Becker, Sérgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes. São 
Paulo is practically a museum in the open air, with neighborhoods and buildings 
of historical value. The city has museums and art galleries. Among the 
museums in the city are São Paulo Museum of Art (MASP), the Ipiranga Museum, 
the Museum of Sacred Art, the Museum of the Portuguese Language, the Pinacoteca 
do Estado de São Paulo, among other renowned institutions. It also houses 
one of the top five zoos in the world, the São Paulo Zoo.[146] Popularly 
known as "Ipiranga Museum", the first monument built to preserve the memory 
of the Independence of Brazil, opened on September 7, 1895, with the name 
of Museu de Ciências Naturais (Natural Science Museum). In 1919, it became 
a history museum. Reflecting the architectural influence of the Versailles 
Palace in France, the Ipiranga's collection, with approximately 100,000 
pieces, comprises works of art, furniture, clothing and appliances that 
belonged to those who took part in Brazilian history, such as explorers, 
rulers and freedom fighters. Its facilities house a library with 100,000 
books and the "Centro de Documentação Histórica," Historic Documentation 
Center, with 40,000 manuscripts. The Ema Gordon Klabin Cultural Foundation 
opened to the public in March 2007. Its headquarters is a 1920s mansion. 
It houses 1545 works, including paintings by Marc Chagall, Pompeo Batoni, 
Pierre Gobert and Frans Post, Brazilian modernists Tarsila do Amaral, Di 
Cavalcanti and Portinari, period furniture, decorative and archaeological 
pieces. Stretching over 78 thousand square metres (0.84 million square 
feet), Memorial da América Latina (Latin America's Memorial) was conceived 
to showcase Latin American countries and their roots and cultures. It is 
home to the headquarters of Parlamento Latino-Americano – Parlatino (Latin 
American Parliament). Designed by Oscar Niemeyer, Memorial has an exhibition 
pavilion with permanent exhibition of the continent's craftwork production; 
a library with books, newspapers, magazines, videos, films and records 
about the history of Latin America; and an 1,679-seat auditorium. Hospedaria 
do Imigrante (Immigrant's Hostel) was built in 1886 and opened in 1887. 
Immigrant's Hostel was built in Brás to welcome the immigrants who arrived 
in Brazil through the Port of Santos, quarantining those who were sick 
and helping new arrivals to find work in coffee plantations in Western, 
Northern and Southwestern São Paulo State and Northern Paraná State. From 
1882 to 1978, 2.5 million immigrants of more than 60 nationalities and 
ethnicities were guests there,[147] all of them duly registered in the 
museum's books and lists. The hostel hosted approximately 3,000 people 
on average, but occasionally reached 8,000. The hostel received the last 
immigrants in 1978.[148] In 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves 
the immigrants' documentation, memory and objects. Located in one of the 
few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former 
hostel. The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former São 
Paulo Railway. Two restored wagons inhabit the museum. One dates from 1914, 
while a second class passenger car dates from 1931. The museum records 
the names of all immigrants who were hosted there from 1888 to 1978.[149] 
Occupying an area of 700 square metres (7,535 square feet), the animals 
shown in the museum are samples of the country's tropical fauna and were 
prepared (embalmed) more than 50 years ago. The animals are grouped according 
to their classification: fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals 
and some invertebrates such as corals, crustaceans and mollusks. The library 
specializes in zoology. It has 73,850 works, of which 8,473 are books and 
2,364 are newspapers, in addition to theses and maps. MASP has one of world's 
most important collections of European art. The most important collections 
cover Italian and French painting schools. The museum was founded by Assis 
Chateaubriand and is directed by Pietro Maria Bardi. Its current headquarters, 
opened in 1968, were designed by Lina Bo Bardi. MASP organizes temporary 
exhibitions in special areas. Brazilian and international exhibitions of 
contemporary arts, photography, design and architecture take turn during 
the whole year.[150] The headquarters of the state government has a collection 
of works by Brazilian artists, such as Portinari, Aldo Bonadei, Djanira, 
Almeida Júnior, Victor Brecheret, Ernesto de Fiori and Aleijadinho. It 
also gathers colonial furniture, leather and silver artefacts and European 
tapestry. In eclectic style, its walls are covered with panels describing 
the history of São Paulo. Located next to the Luz metro station, the building 
was projected by architect Ramos de Azevedo in 1895. It was constructed 
to house an Arts Lyceum. In 1911, it became the Pinacoteca do Estado de 
São Paulo, where it currently hosts a number of art exhibitions. A major 
exhibition on the bronze statues of French sculptor Auguste Rodin took 
place in 2001. There is also a permanent exhibition on the "Resistance" 
movement that took place during military dictatorship in the Republican 
period, including a reconstructed prison cell where political prisoners 
were kept. Also called Oca do Ibirapuera, oca means thatched house in Native 
Brazilian Tupi-Guarani. A white, spaceship-like building sitting in the 
greens of Ibirapuera Park, Oca is an exhibition place with more than 10 thousand 
square metres (0.11 million square feet). Modern art, Native Brazilian 
art, and photographies are some of the topics of past thematic exhibitions.
