Emil Matthew Verban (his original Croatian name is Vrban; born August 27, 
1915 – June 8, 1989) was a second baseman in Major League Baseball who 
played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1944–1946), Philadelphia Phillies (1946–1948), 
Chicago Cubs (1948–1950) and Boston Braves (1950). Verban batted and threw 
right-handed. He was born in Lincoln, Illinois.[1][2] Verban was a second 
baseman noted primarily for his fielding with four National League teams 
from 1944 through 1950. Verban did not reach the major leagues until the 
age of 28, when he joined the St. Louis Cardinals. He distinguished himself 
in the 1944 World Series against the St. Louis Browns, batting .412 (7-for-17) 
and driving in the deciding run in Game Six as the Cardinals won, 4 games 
to 2. Browns owner Don Barnes had earned the ire of Verban after refusing 
his request for a better seat for his pregnant wife. After the final game 
of the series, Verban was quoted as saying, "Now you can sit behind the 
post, meathead", in reference to Barnes.[2] His most productive season 
came in 1945, when he hit .278 and posted career-highs in runs (59), hits 
(166), doubles (22), triples (8) and runs batted in (72), and led the National 
League in games played (155) and fielding percentage (.978).[1] Verban 
also played for the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Braves, 
and made three consecutive appearances in the All-Star Game (1945–47). 
In 1947, he became the first Phillies second baseman to start an All-Star 
game. A good contact hitter, from 1947-48 he led the league in at-bats 
per strikeouts (67.5 and 34.8).[1] In a seven-season career, Verban posted 
a .272 average with one home run and 241 RBI in 853 games.[1] In 1975, 
a group of Chicago Cubs fans based in Washington, D.C. formed the Emil 
Verban Society to honor him. Verban was picked as the epitome of a Cubs 
player, competent but obscure and typifying the work ethic. Verban initially 
believed he was being ridiculed, but his ill feeling disappeared several 
years later when he was flown to Washington to meet President Ronald Reagan, 
also a society member, at the White House.[2] Verban died in Quincy, Illinois,
