Passaic (/pəˈseɪ.ᵻk/ pə-SAY-ik[21] or local /pəˈseɪk/ pə-SAYK[22]) is a 
city in Passaic County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United 
States Census, the city had a total population of 69,781,[9][11][12] maintaining 
its status as the 15th largest municipality in New Jersey with an increase 
of 1,920 residents (+2.8%) from the 2000 Census population of 67,861,[10] 
which had in turn increased by 9,820 (+16.9%) from the 58,041 counted in 
the 1990 Census.[23] Passaic is the tenth most densely populated municipality 
in the entire United States with 22,000+ people per square mile. Located 
north of Newark on the Passaic River, it was first settled in 1678 by Dutch 
traders, as Acquackanonk Township. The city and river draw their name from 
the Lenape word "pahsayèk" which has been variously attributed to mean 
"valley" or "place where the land splits."[24][25][26][27] The city originated 
from a Dutch settlement on the Passaic River established in 1679 which 
was called Acquackanonk. Industrial growth began in the 19th century, as 
Passaic became a textile and metalworking center. Passaic was formed within 
Acquackanonk Township on March 10, 1869, and was incorporated as an independent 
village on March 21, 1871. Passaic was chartered as a city on April 2, 
1873.[28] The 1926 Passaic Textile Strike led by union organizer Albert 
Weisbord saw 36,000 mill workers leave their jobs to oppose wage cuts demanded 
by the textile industry. The workers successfully fought to keep their 
wages unchanged but did not receive recognition of their union by the mill 
owners.[29] Passaic has been called "The Birthplace of Television".[30] 
In 1931, experimental television station W2XCD began transmitting from 
DeForest Radio Corporation in Passaic. It has been called the first television 
station to transmit to the home, and was the first such station to broadcast 
a feature film. Allen B. DuMont, formerly DeForest's chief engineer, opened 
pioneering TV manufacturer DuMont Laboratories in Passaic in 1937, and 
started the DuMont Television Network, the world's first commercial television 
network, in 1946. The Okonite company began manufacturing electrical cable 
here in 1888, with early uses of the company's insulated wires including 
some of the earliest telegraph cables and the wiring for Thomas Edison's 
Pearl Street Station in Lower Manhattan.[31] In 1992, the voters of Passaic 
Township in Morris County voted to change the name of their municipality 
to Long Hill Township, to avoid confusion between the City of Passaic and 
the largely rural community 22 miles (35 km) away, as well as association 
with the more urban city.[32] Passaic is served by two newspapers, The 
Record and Herald News. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
city had a total area of 3.244 square miles (8.401 km2), including 3.146 
square miles (8.149 km2) of land and 0.098 square miles (0.253 km2) of 
water (3.01%).[1][2] Unincorporated communities, localities and place names 
located partially or completely within the city include Davis Bridge and 
Pleasant Plains.[33] Passaic's only land border is with neighboring Clifton, 
which borders Passaic to the north, south, and west. The Passaic River, 
which flows to the east of Passaic, provides the city with four additional 
borders across the water in Bergen County: East Rutherford, Garfield, Rutherford 
and Wallington.[34] Passaic and Wallington are connected by four bridges 
(Market Street Bridge, Eighth Street Bridge, Gregory Avenue Bridge, Main 
Avenue Bridge), while the city connects with Garfield at two bridges (Monroe 
Street Bridge, Passaic Street Bridge) and Rutherford at the Union Avenue 
Bridge, which is located on New Jersey Route 21. One cannot cross from 
Passaic into East Rutherford by vehicle, however, as there is no bridge 
connecting the two municipalities; Drivers wanting to cross from Passaic 
to East Rutherford must use either the Main Avenue Bridge, which is located 
near Wallington's border with East Rutherford, or the Union Avenue Bridge, 
where East Rutherford can be accessed via surface streets. Passaic is located 
10 miles (16 km) from New York City, and 12 miles (19 km) from Newark Airport. 
Passaic has several business districts: Main Avenue begins in Passaic Park 
and follows the curve of the river to downtown. Broadway runs east – west 
through the center of the city, ending at Main Avenue in downtown. Main 
Street has many shops, restaurants and businesses reflecting the city's 
Latino and Eastern European populations. The city is home to several architecturally 
notable churches, including St. John's Lutheran Church, First Presbyterian 
of Passaic, and St. John's Episcopal Church. Southwest Passaic (known as 
Passaic Park) is a residential and institutional center of Orthodox Judaism, 
with 25-30 minyanim on Shabbos, and 1,300 families, making it one of the 
state's fastest-growing Orthodox communities. Home to numerous yeshivas, 
schools and other institutions, there are also many kosher food and shopping 
establishments.[35] Passaic Park takes its name from Third Ward Park. This 
area is also noted for its large mansions and homes of various architectural 
styles, especially Victorian and Tudor. Several condominium and cooperative 
apartment complexes are also located here including: Carlton Tower (at 
22 stories, the city's tallest structure[36]), Presidential Towers, and 
Barry Gardens (which are all located within walking distance of each other 
near a stretch of Passaic Avenue between Lafayette Avenue and Green Court). 
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally 
mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, 
Passaic has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[37] 
Among the speakers of Polish in Passaic are many Gorals.[48] Passaic, with 
30+ synagogues and an Orthodox Jewish population of 15,000, has one of 
the largest Orthodox Jewish communities in New Jersey, along with the townships

system of municipal government, formally known as the Optional Municipal 
Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council (Plan B), enacted by direct petition 
as of July 1, 1973.[56] Under this form of government, the mayor is elected 
directly by the voters for a four-year term of office. Seven council Members 
serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with either three or four seats 
up for election in odd-numbered years. Elections are non-partisan, with 
all positions selected at-large in balloting held in May.[7] As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Passaic is Alex Blanco, whose term of office ends June 30, 
2017.[3] Blanco became the first Dominican-American elected as mayor in 
the United States when he won a special election in November 2008 to succeed 
acting mayor Gary Schaer, who, as City Council president automatically 
moved into this position upon the resignation by previous mayor Samuel 
Rivera, after Rivera pleaded guilty to corruption charges.[57] Blanco was 
elected to serve the remainder of Rivera's term, and was re-elected to 
a full term on May 12, 2009, with 53.1% of votes cast, defeating Passaic 
Board of Education member Vinny Capuana.[58] Members of the Passaic City 
Council are Council President Gary Schaer (term ends June 30, 2019), Jose

M. Munk (2019), Zaida Polanco (2019) and Daniel J. Schwartz (2017).[3][59][60][61][62] 
In addition to his role as council president, Schaer also holds a seat 
in the New Jersey General Assembly. This dual position, often called double 
dipping, is allowed under a grandfather clause in the state law enacted 
by the New Jersey Legislature and signed into law by Governor of New Jersey 
Jon Corzine in September 2007 that prevents dual-office-holding but allows 
those who had held both positions as of February 1, 2008, to retain both 
posts.[63] Corruption charges over the past decades have resulted in the 
federal convictions of two mayors, seven councilman and other public officials.[64][65]

2011 after he was charged with cocaine possession, following his arrest
