Orel Leonard Hershiser IV (born September 16, 1958) is an American former 
baseball pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 
1983 to 2000. He later became a broadcast color analyst and a professional 
poker player. After playing baseball in high school at Cherry Hill High 
School East and at Bowling Green State University, Hershiser was drafted 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1979. After several years in the minor leagues, 
he made his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1983. During his tenure 
with the team, Hershiser was a three-time All-Star. Hershiser's most successful 
season came in 1988, when he set a major league record by pitching 59 consecutive 
innings without allowing a run. He helped lead the Dodgers to a championship 
in the 1988 World Series, and was named the National League (NL) Championship 
Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) and the World Series MVP. That season, 
he won the NL Cy Young Award and an NL Gold Glove Award. He later pitched 
in two more World Series and earned the American League Championship Series 
MVP Award. After 12 seasons with the Dodgers, Hershisher spent time with 
the Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants, and New York Mets before returning 
to Los Angeles for his final season. After retirement as a player, he briefly 
worked as a coach and team executive for the Texas Rangers before serving 
as a color analyst for ESPN and then the Dodgers. Known for his slight 
frame and fierce competitive spirit, Hershiser was nicknamed "Bulldog" 
by former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, who managed Hershiser during his 
time with the Dodgers. Hershiser was born in Buffalo, New York, to Orel 
Leonard Hershiser III and his wife Mildred. The family moved to Detroit, 
Michigan, when he was six and to Toronto, Canada, when he was 12.[1] At 
age eight, Hershiser was the third-place finisher in a national hit, run, 
and throw competition.[2] Hershiser played in Little League Baseball until 
he was 12. His father was a coach and league administrator and his mother 
ran the snackbar.[3] During his family's time in Canada, he participated 
in ice hockey with the Don Mills Flyers in the Greater Toronto Hockey League.[4] 
His family moved again and he attended Cherry Hill High School East in 
Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He did not make the varsity team until his junior 
year as he spent his first year on the freshman team and his second year 
on the junior varsity.[5] He set the single-game strikeout record for his 
high school in 1976 when he retired 15 batsmen in a game against Deptford, 
a record that stood for 21 years. He also remains on the school's leader-boards 
in career winning percentage, strikeouts and earned run average (ERA).[6] 
He was an all-conference selection his senior year.[7] Hershiser received 
only a partial scholarship from Bowling Green State University. He barely 
played his freshman year and was academically ineligible as sophomore. 
He left school and hitchhiked home, where his parents convinced him to 
return to school. He enrolled in summer school to bring his grades up and 
worked at his father's paper company during the summer. He grew and gained 
15 pounds (6.8 kg) during that summer which added 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) 
to his fastball and led to him getting more playing time.[1] He made the 
all-Mid-American Conference All-Star team his junior year, during which 
he pitched a no-hitter against Kent State on May 4, 1979.[8] He won that 
game 2-0 despite only striking out two batters.[9] In his only full-time 
season with the baseball team, in 1979, he was 6-2 with a 2.26 ERA.[10] 
He was also a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.[4] One of his 
fraternity brothers played a joke on him on draft day, pretending to be 
a scout from the San Diego Padres calling to tell him he was drafted in 
the first round. After getting excited and starting to call his friends 
he realized it was a hoax.[11] Hershiser was selected by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the 17th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft. The 
original scouting report on him for the draft said that he had poor control, 
a weak fastball and threw the curveball incorrectly. It went on to state 
that he rattled easily and had questionable makeup.[12] The Dodgers assigned 
him to their Class A farm team in the Midwest League, the Clinton Dodgers. 
He started four games for Clinton in 1979, and appeared in 11 more out 
of the bullpen to finish with a 4–0 record with a 2.09 ERA.[13] Hershiser 
spent the next two seasons in AA with the San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas 
League. He worked primarily as a reliever at San Antonio. He was leading 
the league in saves at one point but then gave up 20 runs in seven innings 
on a road trip. He called this point the lowest of his career. He wanted 
to quit but the manager and pitching coach talked him out of it.[4] Hershiser 
was promoted to the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League 
in 1982. He was 9–6 with a 3.71 ERA in 47 games, with seven starts.[14] 
He was almost included in a trade with the Texas Rangers that season, but 
catcher Jim Sundberg wanted his contract re-written before agreeing to 
the deal and the Dodgers backed out of the transaction.[4] Hershiser won 
the Mulvey Award as the Dodgers top rookie in spring training in 1983 and 
expected to make the club but was sent back to Albuquerque where he was 
briefly reunited with pitching coach Rocky Giordani.[4] He was 10–8 with 
a 4.09 ERA for the Dukes in 1983 in 49 games, with 10 starts and 16 saves.[15] 
Hershiser was called up to the Dodgers for the first time on September 
1, 1983, and made his debut the same day, against the Montreal Expos. He 
came into the game in the seventh inning and retired all three batters 
he faced on two ground outs and a strikeout (of Tim Wallach). However, 
in his second inning of work he allowed a double and a single for a run 
and was promptly taken out of the game.[16] In eight appearances that month, 
he had an ERA of 3.38.[17] Hershisher played winter ball in the Dominican 
Republic after the season and worked with pitching coach Dave Wallace on 
his delivery. He was almost arrested when some fireworks his friends were 
setting off for a New Year's party hit a Dominican General's house, but 
Dodger coach Manny Mota intervened on his behalf.[4] Hershiser made the 
Dodgers Opening Day roster for the 1984 season as the last man in the bullpen 
and was mostly used as a long reliever early on. His first win was in a 
12-inning game against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 5.[18] After getting 
pounded in one game, Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda gave him such a verbal 
lashing that was so loud teammates took to calling it "sermon on the mound".[1] 
Lasorda told Hershiser that he was too timid on the mound, giving hitters 
too much respect. He gave him the nickname "Bulldog" so that he would have 
a tougher attitude in games.[19] Hershisher made his first start on May 
26 against the New York Mets because of an injury to Jerry Reuss. He pitched 
six innings and allowed only one run.[1] He became a full-fledged starter 
in the Dodger rotation in July and responded by pitching four complete 
game shutouts that month, which was good enough to tie for the most in 
the Majors that season (with Joaquín Andújar and teammate Alejandro Peña). 
He finished the season with a record of 11–8 and a 2.66 ERA in 45 games 
(20 starts).[20] In the 1985 season he led the National League (NL) in 
winning percentage, compiling a 19–3 record with a 2.03 ERA. The Dodgers 
won the NL West, and Hershiser finished third in Cy Young Award voting. 
He also saw his first post-season action, pitching in two games in the 
1985 National League Championship Series.[17] In the 1986 season, Hershiser 
went 14–14 with a 3.85 ERA. The next season he was selected to his first 
All-Star Game while compiling a 16–16 record with a 3.06 ERA.[17] Hershiser 
in 1988 led the league in wins (23), innings (267), shutouts (8) and complete 
games (15). He was third in ERA at 2.26.[17] He finished the season with 
a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched, breaking the mark of 
58 held by former Dodger Don Drysdale. The streak began on August 30, when 
he pitched four scoreless innings to conclude a game and the record was 
broken when he pitched 10 shutout innings, on 116 pitches, in the final 
game of the season.[21][22][23] He was selected to his second all-star 
game and was a unanimous selection for the National League Cy Young Award.[24] 
He also won the Gold Glove Award for the best fielding pitcher in the National 
League.[17] In the 1988 National League Championship Series between Hershiser's 
Dodgers and the New York Mets, Hershiser not only started Games 1 and 3, 
but recorded the final out in Game 4 in relief for a save. He then pitched 
a shutout in Game 7 and was selected as the NLCS MVP.[25] He then pitched 
a shutout in Game 2 of the World Series and allowed only two runs in a 
complete game in the clinching victory in Game 5, winning the World Series 
MVP Award.[26] Hershiser is the only player to receive the Cy Young Award, 
the Championship Series MVP Award, and the World Series MVP Award in the 
same season.[27] He later received both The Sporting News Pitcher of the 
Year[17] and Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportsman of the Year award[4] 
for his accomplishments in 1988. Hershiser signed a new $7.9 million three-year 
contract with the Dodgers prior to the 1989 season that was the richest 
three-year contract ever signed to that point.[28] That season, he made 
his third straight All-Star team and he had another good year with an ERA 
of 2.31 in 35 games.[17] However, the Dodgers weren't as good and he suffered 
from a lack of offensive support. He went 0–7 over one nine game stretch 
because the team only scored nine runs total in that period.[29] He had 
a 15–15 record that season but only evened it out because he pitched 11 
innings in the last game of the season and threw 169 pitches.[30] He was 
determined to stay in until his team took the lead, no matter what the 
manager wanted.[31] After just four starts in 1990, it was discovered that 
Hershiser had a torn labrum in the shoulder of his pitching arm. Dr. Frank 
Jobe performed shoulder reconstruction surgery on Hershiser on April 27, 
1990,[32] the first time the procedure had been performed on a major league 
player. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until May 29, 1991, a return that 
he called "a miracle."[33] Two games later, he picked up his 100th career 
win against the Chicago Cubs on June 9, 1991.[34] In 21 starts, he was 
7–2 with a 3.46 ERA.[17] He won his last six decisions and was selected 
as the UPI Comeback Player of the Year.[35] There were still questions 
about his recovery heading into 1992,[36] but he managed to pitch 33 games 
in both 1992 and 1993. His numbers were not what they were before the surgery, 
but he was still effective. He was 10–15 with a 3.67 ERA in 1992 and 12–14 
with a 3.59 ERA in 1993.[17] Notably in 1993, Hershiser hit .356 in 83 
plate appearances, earning a Silver Slugger Award.[17] In his final start 
of 1994, on August 7, Hershiser took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning 
before it was broken up.[37] The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended 
the season on August 11.[38] Hershiser was involved in the negotiations 
as part of the Major League Baseball Players Association[39] but the strike 
signaled the end of his time with the Dodgers and he became a free agent.[17] 
Hershiser signed a three-year contract with the Cleveland Indians on April 
8, 1995.[17][40] Indians General Manager John Hart said that the team was 
looking for a veteran with "character and competitiveness" to show the 
young players how to play the right way.[41] He went 16–6 with a 3.87 ERA 
in 26 starts for the Indians in 1995[17] to lead the young team to their 
first post-season appearance in 41 years.[40] Hershiser won the two games 
he pitched in the 1995 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against 
the Seattle Mariners and was selected as the ALCS MVP,[42] the first player 
to have won the LCS MVP Award in both leagues. He also pitched effectively 
in the 1995 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, though the Indians 
would lose the series in six games.[43][44] He pitched two more seasons 
for the Indians, and was 14–6 for the 1997 team, including pitching seven 
shutout innings in Game 3 of the 1997 ALCS.[40][45] In his final World 
Series appearance in 1997 he gave up 13 runs in 10 innings and lost 2 games 
to the Florida Marlins.[46] Though he pitched for the Indians for only 
three seasons, Hershiser became something of a folk hero in Cleveland. 
One memorable image from his tenure is of Hershiser screaming "Take that!" 
at the Braves dugout after starting a 1–3 double play late in game five 
of the 1995 World Series.[47] Hershiser signed a one-year $3.45 million 
contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 7, 1997. He made 34 
starts and was 11–10 with a 4.41 ERA in 1998.[17] The contract contained 
an option for 1999 but the Giants declined the option after the season. 
At the time they said they might come to terms on a new deal.[48] Instead 
he signed a minor league contract with the Indians on February 20, 1999.[49] 
The Indians released him during spring training and he signed with the 
New York Mets on March 25, 1999. Hershiser made 32 starts with the Mets 
and was 13–12 with a 4.58 ERA.[17] He served as a mentor to the young pitchers 
on the Mets staff and helped them make the playoffs by allowing just one 
run in 5 1/3 innings in a 2–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the last 
game of the season.[50] He pitched out of the bullpen in the playoffs as 
the Mets lost to the Braves in the 1999 National League Championship Series.[51] 
Hershiser signed a one-year contract to return to the Dodgers on December 
17, 1999.[17] He started the home opener on April 14, 2000 against the 
Reds and allowed only one run in six strong innings.[52] He struggled after 
that, allowed 36 runs on 42 hits, 14 walks and 11 hit batters. His 13.14 
ERA in 2000 is the worst ERA by any pitcher with 20 or more innings.[29] 
One day after allowing eight runs in 1 2/3 innings on June 26, he was released 
by the Dodgers.[53] Hershiser was not an overpowering pitcher, but he developed 
a variety of pitches and used his brain to out-think hitters.[54] Hershiser 
explained his pitch repertoire in 1989 as such: By 1999, he noted that 
his pitches were not as sharp, so he added a slider to the mix. He also 
emphasized locating his pitches in good spots: "You'll hear pitchers say, 
'I had great stuff and got shelled,' but you never hear them say, 'I had 
great location and got shelled.'"[56] Hershiser remained with the Dodgers 
briefly as a player-personnel consultant. He went to AAA Albuquerque and 
filed one report but there wasn't much for him to do so he left the position.[57] 
He was subsequently hired to work on broadcasts of the Little League World 
Series for ABC and ESPN in 2000–2001.[58] He also worked on Wednesday Night 
Baseball for ESPN during the 2001 season.[59] Hershiser left that position 
to join the Texas Rangers as a special assistant to General Manager John 
Hart in fall of 2001 and was named as the Rangers pitching coach on June 
22, 2002.[60] In October 2005 Hershiser was mentioned as a candidate to 
replace Jim Tracy as manager of the Dodgers, but the position went to Grady 
Little.[61] He was also mentioned as a possible replacement for Ken Macha 
of the Oakland Athletics; however, he was ultimately passed over for Bob 
Geren.[62] He left his position of Rangers pitching coach after the 2005 
season to become an Executive Director of the Rangers, reporting to Club 
President Jeff Cogen.[63] He didn't last long in that position as he quit 
on February 3, 2006.[64] On February 13, 2006, Hershiser rejoined ESPN 
as an analyst for Baseball Tonight, Sunday Night Baseball, and the Little 
League World Series.[65] Through a group which included fellow former Dodger 
Steve Garvey, Hershiser became involved in the bidding process for the 
Dodgers when the team was up for sale in 2011–2012.[66] His group did not 
make it past the first round of the bidding.[67] He chose to leave ESPN 
and re-join the Dodgers as a television analyst for their new regional 
sports network SportsNet LA in 2014.[68] Hershiser teams with Charley Steiner 
and Nomar Garciaparra to call Dodger road games not played in San Francisco 
when Vin Scully does not travel. Hershiser started playing poker competitively 
in 2006. After retirement from baseball he moved to Summerlin, Nevada and 
befriended a poker instructor. He became a regular at Red Rock's poker 
room in Summerlin, playing $2–$5 NLHE.[69] Hershiser signed with Poker 
Royalty to represent his poker career.[70] He was invited to participate 
in the 2008 NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship. Playing under the 
PokerStars banner, Hershiser stunned the poker world by making the quarterfinals, 
defeating 2006 event champion Ted Forrest, Allen Cunningham, and Freddy 
Deeb[71]—players who had won a total of 12 World Series of Poker bracelets 
heading into the event. Andy Bloch defeated him in the quarterfinals.[72] 
Hershiser has played in a number of events, including the 2008 World Series 
of Poker and the 2009 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure. Hershiser won $54,570 
on September 7, 2008 by taking ninth place in the $10,000 Pokerstars World 
Championship of Online Poker Event 5.[73] Hershiser also has made a tradition 
of giving an autographed baseball to the poker player who eliminates him.[74] 
Hershiser and his first wife, Jamie Byars, divorced in 2005.[75] They have 
two sons, Orel Leonard V (known as Quinton) and Jordan.[75] Hershiser married 
his second wife, Dana Deaver, a former literacy specialist, in December 
2010.[76] Jordan graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in 2007, where 
he earned all-conference honors in baseball and basketball, and played 
college baseball at the University of Southern California as a pitcher 
and first baseman. Despite his college career being hampered by injuries, 
Jordan was drafted by the Dodgers in the 34th round of the 2012 MLB draft.[77][78] 
Hershiser and Deaver currently reside in Las Vegas with Deaver's children, 
son Spencer and daughter Sloane.[79] Hershiser is an active Christian.[80][81] 
He was a guest star on an episode of the Christian children's video series 
The Adventures of McGee and Me in 1992 entitled Take Me Out of the Ball 
Game.[82] On an appearance on The Tonight Show after the 1988 World Series,
