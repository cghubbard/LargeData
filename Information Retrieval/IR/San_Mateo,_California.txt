San Mateo (/ˌsæn məˈteɪ.oʊ/ SAN mə-TAY-oh; Spanish for "Saint Matthew") 
is a city in San Mateo County, California, in the high-tech enclave of 
Silicon Valley in the San Francisco Bay Area. With a population of 97,207 
as of the 2010 census, it is one of the larger suburbs on the San Francisco 
Peninsula, located between Burlingame to the north, Foster City and San 
Francisco Bay to the east, Belmont to the south, and Highlands-Baywood 
Park and Hillsborough to the west. The 2015 population was estimated to 
be 103,536.[9][10] San Mateo was incorporated in 1894. By car, San Mateo 
is about thirty minutes from downtown San Jose and twenty-five minutes 
from downtown San Francisco. Documented by Spanish colonists as part of 
the Rancho de las Pulgas (literally "Ranch of the Fleas") and the Rancho 
San Mateo, the earliest history is held in the archives of Mission Dolores. 
In 1789 the Spanish missionaries had named a Native American village along 
Laurel Creek as Los Laureles or the Laurels (Mission Dolores, 1789). At 
the time of Mexican Independence there were 30 native Californians at San 
Mateo, most likely from the Salson tribelet[11] Captain Fredrick W. Beechey 
in 1827 traveling with the hills on their right, known in that part as 
the Sierra del Sur, began to approach the road, which passing over a small 
eminence, opened out upon "a wide country of meadow land, with clusters 
of fine oak free from underwood… It strongly resembled a nobleman's park: 
herds of cattle and horses were grazing upon the rich pasture, and numerous 
fallow‑deer, startled at the approach of strangers, bounded off to seek 
protection among the hills… This spot is named San Matheo, and belongs 
to the mission of San Francisco."[11] An 1835 sketch map of the Rancho 
refers to the creek as arroyo de los Laureles. In the 21st century, most 
of the laurels are gone, removed for development.[citation needed] In 1810 
Coyote Point was an early recorded feature of San Mateo. Beginning in the 
1850s, some wealthy San Franciscans began building summer or permanent 
homes in the milder mid-peninsula. While most of this early settlement 
occurred in adjacent Hillsborough and Burlingame, a number of historically 
important mansions and buildings were constructed in San Mateo.[citation 
needed] A.P. Giannini, founder of the Bank of Italy (which later became 
the Bank of America), lived here most of his life. His mansion, Seven Oaks, 
is listed in the National Register of Historic Places (No.99001181). Located 
at 20 El Cerrito Drive, it has been deteriorating as it has not been preserved 
or occupied for years.[citation needed] In 1858 Sun Water Station, a stage 
station of the Butterfield Overland Mail route, was established in San 
Mateo. It was located 9 miles south of Clarks Station in what is now San 
Bruno and 9 miles north of the next station at Redwood City.[12] The Howard 
Estate was built in 1859 on the hill accessed by Crystal Springs Road. 
The Parrott Estate was erected in 1860 in the same area, giving rise to 
two conflicting names for the hill, Howard Hill and Parrot Hill. After 
use of the automobile changed traffic patterns, neither historic name was 
commonly applied to that hill (Brown, 1975). The Borel Estate was developed 
near Borel Creek in 1874. It has been redeveloped since the late 20th century 
for use as modern offices and shops. The property is managed and owned 
by Borel Place Associates and the Borel Estate Company.[citation needed] 
Hayward Park, the 1880 American Queen Anne-style residence of Alvinza Hayward 
(often said to be "California's first millionaire" from his silver and 
banking fortunes), was built on an 800-acre (3.2 km2) estate in San Mateo 
which included a deer park and racetrack, roughly bounded by present-day 
El Camino Real (on the west), 9th Avenue (on the north), B Street (on the 
east) and 16th Avenue (on the south).[13] A smaller portion of the property 
and the mansion, was converted into The Peninsula Hotel in 1908, following 
Hayward's death in 1904. The Hotel burned down in a spectacular fire on 
25 June 1920.[14] In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrants came to 
San Mateo to work in the salt ponds and flower industry. Although Japanese-Americans 
only account for 2.2% of the population today, they continue to be a major 
cultural influence and a draw for the rest of the region.[15] The Eugene 
J. De Sabla Japanese Teahouse and Garden was established in 1894 at 70 
De Sabla Road, designed by Makoto Hagiwara, designer of the Japanese garden 
in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. He arranged for Japanese artisans 
to be brought to the United States primarily for its teahouse construction. 
The parcel was purchased in 1988 by San Francisco businessman Achille Paladini 
and wife Joan, who have restored it. The garden features hundreds of varieties 
of plants and several rare trees. A large koi pond surrounds an island. 
The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 
1992.[16] The best-known natural area is Coyote Point Park, a rock outcropped 
peninsula that juts out into the San Francisco Bay. The early Spanish navigators 
named it la punta de San Mateo.[17] Crews of American cargo ships carrying 
grain in the bay renamed it Big Coyote (BLM, 1853). Sailors had a penchant 
for naming promontories at the edge of San Francisco Bay after the coyote; 
across the bay in Fremont are the Coyote Hills, part of Coyote Hills Regional 
Park. By the 1890s the shore area was developed as a popular beach called 
San Mateo Beach. In 1842 the Spanish had named it playa de San Mateo. Today 
Coyote Point is home to CuriOdyssey, formerly known as the Coyote Point 
Museum, a major natural history museums and wildlife centers in the state. 
The Peninsula Humane Society is also situated at Coyote Point. The variety 
of natural habitats include mixed oak woodland, riparian zones, and bayland 
marshes. One endangered species, the California clapper rail, was sighted 
feeding on mudflats by the Third Avenue bridge in San Mateo.[18] The marsh 
areas are also likely habitat for the endangered Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse, 
which inhabit the middle and high zones of salt and brackish marshes, as 
well as for the endangered marsh plant, Point Reyes bird's beak. Sugarloaf 
Mountain, whose name has been documented in 1870, is a prominent landform 
between the forks of Laurel Creek (Brown, 1975). In the late 20th century, 
this mixed oak woodland and chaparral habitat was a site of controversy 
related to proposals to develop a portion of the mountain for residential 
use. It has been preserved for use as park and open space area, and is 
home to the endangered Mission Blue Butterfly. Sawyer Camp Trail, located 
on the western edge of San Mateo along the Crystal Springs Reservoir is 
another popular destination for joggers, walkers and bikers. This roughly 
6 mile trail begins in San Mateo and stretches north toward Hillsborough 
and San Bruno, parallel to the 280 freeway. San Mateo is located at 37°33′15″N 
122°18′47″W﻿ / ﻿37.55417°N 122.31306°W﻿ / 37.55417; -122.31306 (37.554286, 
−122.313044).[19] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city 
has a total area of 15.9 square miles (41 km2), of which, 12.1 square miles 
(31 km2) is land and 3.8 square miles (9.8 km2) (23.63%) is water. San 
Mateo has a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild, damp 
winters. The city is generally shielded from the Pacific Ocean by the Montara 
Mountain block of the Santa Cruz Mountains, but two gaps in the mountains 
(the San Bruno Gap, between Montara Mountain and San Bruno Mountain; and 
the Crystal Springs Gap, near where State Route 92 meets State Route 35, 
west of the College of San Mateo) can channel ocean weather, resulting 
in gusty afternoon winds that bring fog toward San Mateo in the late afternoon 
through early morning in the summer months.[20][21] The National Weather 
Service maintained a cooperative weather station in San Mateo until 1978; 
records for the period show that January, the coolest month, had an average 
maximum of 57.8 °F (14.3 °C) and an average minimum of 41.7 °F (5.4 °C), 
and September, the warmest month, had an average maximum of 78.0 °F (25.6 °C) 
and an average minimum of 54.2 °F (12.3 °C). The record maximum temperature 
was 109 °F (43 °C) on June 14, 1961, and the record minimum temperature 
was 25 °F (−4 °C) on January 5, 1949, and December 9, 1972. Annual precipitation 
averaged 18.77 inches (477 mm) of rainfall, falling on an average of 60 
days each year. The wettest year was 29.77 inches (756 mm) in 1973 and 
the driest year was 11.16 inches (283 mm) of rainfall in 1953. The most 
precipitation in one month was 12.59 inches (320 mm) of rainfall in December 
1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was 3.72 inches (94 mm) of 
rainfall on December 23, 1955.[22] Based on comparison with the existing 
NWS office at San Francisco International Airport, San Mateo is generally 
a few degrees warmer in summer than the airport and a few degrees cooler 
in winter, while annual precipitation is almost the same at the airport 
and in San Mateo.[23] In recent years, daily temperature reports for San 
Mateo from local weather observers have been published in the San Mateo 
Times and the San Francisco Chronicle. The 2010 United States Census[26]

In the California State Legislature, San Mateo is in the 13th Senate District, 
represented by Democrat Jerry Hill, and in the 22nd Assembly District, 
represented by Democrat Kevin Mullin.[29] In the United States House of 
Representatives, San Mateo is in California's 14th congressional district, 
represented by Democrat Jackie Speier.[30] In general, San Mateo's downtown 
core and neighborhoods east of El Camino Real are more populous and have 
a greater density than the neighborhoods to the west of El Camino Real, 
where there is a lower population density. San Mateo has one of the larger, 
well developed, more prominent suburban downtowns in the San Francisco 
Bay Area. It is located roughly between Tilton and 9th Avenues and Delaware 
Street and El Camino Real[31] The downtown core contains over 800 shops 
and restaurants, many of them in historic buildings from the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries.[32] A historically influential area for the Japanese-American 
community, the downtown is home to many Japanese restaurants and shops. 
A large, modern 12-screen movie theatre complex gives the downtown a major 
entertainment option. Central Park is considered to be San Mateo's signature 
park with tennis courts, picnic areas, playground, a baseball field, a 
recreation center, a miniature train, and a Japanese Tea Garden.[33] The 
Caltrain station is situated downtown. The downtown also contains many 
large and small multi-story office buildings, apartments, government buildings 
and Mills Medical Center, making the area a busy employment center day 
and night. Hillsdale Mall is the largest mall in San Mateo County, with 
over 100 stores in the mall itself, surrounded by many big box stores. 
The city of San Mateo has approved the construction of Cinépolis (luxury 
movie theater) and a bowling alley off El Camino Real. Sears is no longer 
in business and will be vacated for new businesses to occupy this space. 
It has its own Caltrain station across El Camino Real. Bay Meadows was 
a horseracing track near Hillsdale Mall which closed down in 2008.[34] 
It is currently being redeveloped into a large mixed used development which 
will include hundreds of new residential units, office space, retail space 
and acres of parks including a town square.[35] It is scheduled for completion 
in 2017.[36] It is a significant amount of new building given the city's 
and peninsula's limited space available for development. The economy of 
San Mateo would best be considered very diverse with jobs in the technology, 
health care, financial services, government, and retail trade fields being 
among the most numerous. Companies based in San Mateo include Franklin 
Templeton Investments, Roblox, Fisher Investments, SolarCity, Solstice, 
PlayStation, Marketo, GoPro and NetSuite. According to the City's 2015 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[37] the top employers in the city 
are: Residents are zoned for schools in the San Mateo Foster City School 
District and San Mateo Union High School District. Elementary schools comprise 
Preschool, K-5, Middle and Magnet schools. There are three public high 
schools: San Mateo, Aragon, and Hillsdale. There are also three private 
high schools: one all-male Catholic high school, Junípero Serra, one all-female 
Catholic high school, Notre Dame High School (Belmont, California), and 
the Nueva Upper School. There is the Carey School. The city is home to 
the College of San Mateo, a community college. The campus of over 10,000 
students is located on 153 acres in the western foothills of the city which 
offer a panoramic view of the San Francisco Bay.[38] Other universities 
in the area include Notre Dame de Namur University, a private Catholic 
university of 2,000 students in neighboring Belmont[39] and Stanford University 
located about 12 miles to the south. The San Mateo Union High School District 
also hosts an adult school behind the campus of San Mateo High School.[40] 
The City of San Mateo operates three libraries within the city. The Main 
Library, the Hillsdale Library, and the Marina Library are all part of 
the Peninsula Library System.[41] The Main Library located near Central 
Park in downtown opened in 2006 after residents passed a $30 million bond 
measure. Upon opening, the three story 93,000 square foot building earned 
numerous design awards and was LEED certified NC Gold. Windows from floor 
to ceiling provide abundant natural light inside. It is modeled after a 
retail bookstore and is technologically advanced.[42] San Mateo maintains 
more than 15 parks throughout of the city. Central Park is considered to 
be the main one and hosts many community park functions that serve downtown 
residents. It has a Japanese tea garden, a rose garden, and a mini train.[43] 
Beresford Park is another large park that offers bocce ball and a skate 
plaza. Martin Luther King Jr Park and Joinville Park offer swimming pools 
while Ryder Park boasts a water play structure. Parkside Aquatic Park located 
on the San Francisco Bay has beach swimming and volleyball. Many of these 
parks have picnic areas with grills, children's play areas, basketball 
and tennis courts, and baseball diamonds.[44] Coyote Point Park is near 
the border with Burlingame and on the San Francisco Bay. It is a 670-acre 
regional county park known for its ideal location for windsurfing and sailing. 
It is also home to CuriOdyssey: a hands-on science museum and small native 
animal zoo.[45] San Mateo is considered to be near the center of the San 
Francisco Bay Area about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose, the 
region's two largest cities. It is served by three major freeways including 
U.S. Route 101, Interstate 280, and State Route 92. State Route 92 east 
of San Mateo traverses the San Francisco Bay as the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge 
to the city of Hayward on its eastern shore. SamTrans provides local bus 
service within the city of San Mateo as well as the entire county of San 
Mateo.,[46] AC Transit provides transbay bus service via the San Mateo 
Bridge to Alameda County.[47] Caltrain provides commuter rail service on 
the San Francisco Peninsula between San Francisco and San Jose. Caltrain 
operates three stations within the city of San Mateo with the Hillsdale 
Station, Hayward Park Station, and the San Mateo Station in downtown. There 
are 41 northbound and 41 southbound trains with a stop in the city each 
weekday and 18 trains in both directions on weekends. Extra trains are 
run to accommodate extra passengers when the San Francisco Giants play.[48] 
See public transportation in San Mateo County for more details. San Mateo 
is located near three major airports including San Francisco International 
Airport seven miles to the north. Oakland International Airport and San 
Jose Mineta International Airport are also within a half an hour drive. 
San Carlos Airport is a general aviation airport located about six miles 
to the south. Hospitals in San Mateo include San Mateo Medical Center, 
an acute care facility.[49] Cemeteries include Skylawn Memorial Park and 
St. John's Cemetery. The San Mateo Performing Arts Center, located on San 
Mateo High School, is one of the largest theatres on the peninsula outside 
of San Francisco. The College of San Mateo is also located here and is 
home to radio station KCSM. The city is also home to the Bridgepointe and 
Hillsdale shopping centers. Bay Meadows horse-racing track was torn down 
in 2008. The Japanese Tea Garden and San Mateo Arboretum in Central Park, 
San Mateo, CA Central Park are of interest. U.S. Route 101, Interstate 
280, and State Route 92 pass through San Mateo. One of its sister cities 
is Toyonaka, Japan, for which the Japanese Tea Garden at Central Park was 
created to commemorate.[50] San Mateo has two sister cities, as designated
