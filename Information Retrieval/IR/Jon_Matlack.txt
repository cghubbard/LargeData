Jonathan Trumpbour Matlack (born January 19, 1950) is an American former 
Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He was the fourth overall pick 
by the New York Mets in the 1967 Major League Baseball draft. Matlack also 
pitched for the Texas Rangers. Matlack compiled 1,023 strikeouts and a 
3.03 earned run average as one of the "Big Three" pitchers the New York 
Mets were built around in the 1970s, along with Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. 
Unfortunately, the Mets were also a light hitting team at the time,[1] 
and his 82–81 record is not nearly indicative of how well he pitched for 
the club. Matlack's best minor league season was 1968, when he went 13–6 
with a 2.76 ERA for the Raleigh-Durham Mets of the Carolina League. During 
his fifth season in the Mets' farm system, Matlack debuted with the Mets 
in the second game of a July 11, 1971 double header with the Cincinnati 
Reds. He pitched seven innings, and left the game with a 3–2 lead, however, 
Tug McGraw and Tom Seaver were unable to close the game.[2] For the season, 
Matlack went 0–3 with a 4.14 ERA in seven appearances (six starts). His 
finest pitching performance was his last, when he gave up just one run 
in eight innings of work against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[3] Matlack made 
the team out of spring training 1972, and got off to a 6–0 start with a 
1.95 ERA in the first two months of the season. He ended the season with 
a 15–10 record and 2.32 ERA to win the National League Rookie of the Year 
award. On September 30, he gave up Roberto Clemente's 3000th, and final, 
career hit.[4] On May 8, 1973, a vicious line drive off the bat of Marty 
Perez of the Atlanta Braves struck Jon's head so hard that the ball rebounded 
into the dugout. Matlack suffered a hairline fracture of his skull, but 
recovered quickly enough to return and pitch six shutout innings at Pittsburgh 
on May 19. He ended up winning 14 games for the National League champion 
Mets. Matlack's record dipped to 14–16 in 1973, however, he was 5–1 from 
August 18 on, helping the Mets capture the National League East crown. 
Perhaps his most memorable moment with the Mets occurred on October 7, 
1973 when he held the "Big Red Machine" to just two hits in game two of 
the 1973 National League Championship Series. Both hits were by reserve 
outfielder Andy Kosco.[5] He was equally impressive in the 1973 World Series, 
giving up just three hits in six innings in game one of the World Series, 
however, the Oakland A's scored two runs on a Félix Millán error in the 
third, and held on for the 2–1 victory.[6] He won game four, giving up 
just one run in eight innings.[7] However, he lost the seventh and decisive 
game of the series 5-2; in the third inning of that game, he gave up two-run 
home runs to both Bert Campaneris and Reggie Jackson—the only two home 
runs Oakland would hit the entire Series.[8] His fast ball wasn't working 
on account of pitching on only 3 days rest. Matlack was an All-Star for 
the Mets for the next three seasons, sharing MVP honors in the 1975 game 
with Bill Madlock.[9] In 1976, Matlack went 17–10 with a 2.95 and a league 
leading six shutouts to finish sixth in N.L. Cy Young Award balloting. 
In 1977, Matlack's record dipped to 7–15 with a 4.21 earned run average 
(he had entered the season with a career ERA of 2.88) for a Mets team that 
lost 98 games and finished last in the N.L. East. Following the season, 
Matlack was included in an unusual four team off-season trade that sent 
him to the Texas Rangers. The Rangers sent Adrian Devine, Tommy Boggs, 
and Eddie Miller to the Atlanta Braves, a player to be named later and 
Tom Grieve to the Mets and Bert Blyleven to the Pittsburgh Pirates. The 
Mets received Willie Montañez from the Braves, and sent John Milner to 
the Pirates. The Pirates sent Al Oliver and Nelson Norman to the Rangers. 
The Rangers later sent Ken Henderson (March 15, 1978) to the Mets to complete 
the trade. Matlack went 15-13 with a 2.27 ERA (second to Ron Guidry) and 
earned his first career save his first season in Texas, however elbow surgery 
limited him to just thirteen starts in 1979. He rebounded to make 34 starts 
in 1980, one of which was on August 19, when he held George Brett, who 
was batting over .400, hitless, ending his thirty-game hitting streak.[10] 
Matlack retired following the 1983 season. After four years away from the 
game, he was hired as pitching coach for the San Diego Padres' Arizona 
League affiliate. He also coached in the Chicago White Sox organization 
before he was hired as the Detroit Tigers' major league pitching coach 
in 1996. He is currently the minor-league pitching coordinator for the 
Houston Astros.[11] John Matlack is now the pitching coach for the Glens
