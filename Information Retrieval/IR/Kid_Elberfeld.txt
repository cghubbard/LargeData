As player As manager Norman Arthur "Kid" Elberfeld (April 13, 1875 – January 
13, 1944) was a professional baseball player. Elberfeld played shortstop 
in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Phillies (1898), Cincinnati 
Reds (1899), Detroit Tigers (1901–1903), New York Highlanders (1903–1909), 
Washington Senators (1910–1911), and Brooklyn Robins (1914). Elberfled 
also managed the New York Highlanders for the last half of the 1908 season. 
Elberfeld was given the nickname "The Tabasco Kid"[1] because of his fiery 
temper. He was known for his ferocious verbal, and sometimes physical, 
assaults on umpires. On one occasion, while in the minors, Elberfeld threw 
a lump of mud into the umpire's open mouth.[2] Later in his career, Elberfeld 
assaulted umpire Silk O'Loughlin and had to be forcibly removed by police; 
Elberfeld was suspended for just 8 games.[3] Although records were not 
kept, it was said that Elberfeld was thrown out of more games than any 
other player of his era. Elberfeld broke into organized baseball in 1892 
in Clarkson, Tennessee.[4] He was so highly regarded as a prospect that 
a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies recommended signing him over another 
shortstop prospect, Honus Wagner(A Hall of Famer).[5] Elberfeld played 
only 14 games for the Phillies in 1898 before being sent to the Detroit 
Tigers, then a minor league team in the Western Conference. A year later, 
Elberfeld was purchased from Detroit by the Cincinnati Reds.[6] Elberfeld 
lasted only 41 games in Cincinnati. Prior to the 1900 season, the Reds 
sent Elberfeld back to Detroit, then still part of the Western League. 
Elberfeld remained with Detroit when they joined the newly formed American 
League in 1901. He was the Tigers' starting shortstop during their first 
two seasons as a Major League team. In the team's debut, on April 25, 1901, 
the Tigers committed 7 errors, including 3 by Elberfeld. Later in the season, 
Elberfeld had 12 assists in a game on September 2, 1901.[3] Elberfeld went 
on to bat .308 (with 76 RBIs and a .397 On Base Percentage) in the Tigers' 
inaugural season, becoming the Tigers' first team batting leader and its 
first .300 hitter. In 1902, Elberfeld's batting average dropped to .260, 
but he started the 1903 season on a hitting tear. In June 1903, with Elberfeld 
hitting .341 for the Tigers, he was traded to the New York Highlanders 
for Herman Long and Ernie Courtney. Despite his hot hitting, Elberfeld 
had fallen out of favor in Detroit after being suspended for abusing an 
umpire. Tiger manager Ed Barrow accused Elberfeld of deliberately throwing 
games to get himself traded.[3] Elbefeld was with the Highlanders from 
1903 to 1909. During that time, he broke the .300 mark only once, batting 
.306 in 1906. Nevertheless, he was considered an integral part of the Highlanders 
teams, contributing in many small ways. For example, on May 20, 1907, Elberfeld 
stole home twice in the same game, the first American League player to 
accomplish that feat. In late June 1908, New York manager Clark Griffith 
resigned, and Elberfeld took over as the manager. The Highlanders finished 
the 1908 season, Elberfeld's only season as a Major League manager, in 
last place having gone 27–71 (a .276 winning percentage) under Elberfeld.[6] 
In December 1909, Elberfeld was sold to the Washington Senators for $5,000. 
He played two seasons for the Senators before being released. He signed 
with Montgomery in the Southern League where he befriended a young Casey 
Stengel. According to Stengel biographer, Maury Allen, in his 1979 book, 
"'You Could Look It Up: The Life of Casey Stengel'", Elberfeld was generous 
with his time and his wisdom. The grizzled veteran and the 22-year-old 
youngster sat together on trains, roomed together in hotels, dined together 
in restaurants, shared thoughts on the bench, and talked for hours about 
baseball. On September 15, 1912, Stengel was called up to Brooklyn. Elberfeld 
threw a farewell party for Stengel, ordering him to buy a new suit ("You 
gotta dress like a big leaguer before they believe you are one", Elberfeld 
said) for $22.00, and a new suitcase for $17.50. After a long night of 
drinking, Elberfeld walked with Stengel to the train station, and advised 
Stengel: "Keep your ears open and your mouth shut up there." While good 
advice for most players, Stengel didn't follow it and became known as much 
for his mouth as his baseball talent. Elberfeld returned briefly to the 
Major Leagues in 1914, where he played with the Brooklyn Robins. Aside 
from his temper, Elberfeld became known as one of the best shortstops in 
the early years of the 20th Century. He was known as a tough competitor 
who challenged baserunners to slash him out of their way. They sometimes 
did precisely that. On May 1, 1908, Elberfeld was severely spiked in the 
foot by Bob Ganley‚ essentially ending his season. Elberfeld batted only 
56 times in 1908. During Ty Cobb's rookie season, he had a basepath meeting 
with the Tabasco Kid. Cobb slid head first into second base, only to have 
Elberfeld dig his knee into the back of Cobb's neck, grinding his face 
in the dirt. According to a Cobb biographer, that was the last time Cobb 
slid headfirst into a base.[7] Shortly before his death, Elberfeld was 
quoted as saying "Ty found out my feet were harder than his head. Then 
he started coming in spikes first. I had to protect myself."[5] Elberfeld's 
legs were badly scarred from years of highly flying spikes, and he reportedly 
poured raw whisky into spike wounds to cauterize them.[8] Further showing 
his toughness as a ballplayer, Elberfeld was not afraid of being hit by 
a pitch. He led the American League in being hit by a pitch in 1903 and 
1911 and was among the league leaders in the category nine times. In 1911, 
he was hit by a pitch 25 times, setting an American League record that 
was not broken until 1986 when Don Baylor was hit by a pitch 35 times. 
In his career, Elberfeld was hit by a pitch 165 times – 13th most in the 
history of Major League Baseball. Despite 458 errors at the shortstop position, 
Elberfeld had great range in his early years. In 1901, Elberfeld made 332 
putouts and had a range factor rating of 6.14 – 87 points higher than the 
league average for shortstops. He also had a career best 459 assists at 
shortstop the following season with the Tigers. He once collected 12 assists 
in a single game in 1901. As injuries and age slowed him down, Elberfeld's 
range was more limited later in his career. Elberfeld remained active in 
major and minor league baseball for 30 years. From 1915 to 1917, Elberfeld 
managed the Chattanooga Lookouts, then went on to the Little Rock Travelers, 
where he managed for several years, winning a pennant in 1920.[4] While 
managing the Travelers, Elberfed met a 14-year-old Travis Jackson. Elberfeld 
observed Jackson in an impromtu work out, and later signed Jackson to his 
first professional contract.[9][10] Early in his baseball career, Elberfeld 
bought an apple orchard on Signal Mountain, near Chattanooga. Elberfeld 
built his home and raised a family of five daughters and a son on Signal 
Mountain. His daughters formed a basketball team that played as "The Elberfeld 
Girls" and appeared on many Southern programs for several years. Elberfeld
