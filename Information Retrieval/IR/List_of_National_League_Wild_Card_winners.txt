The wild card was established for Major League Baseball's playoffs in 1994 
with the intention of helping the best teams that did not win their division 
to still have a chance to win the World Series. The restructuring of both 
the National and American Leagues from two divisions each to three made 
it necessary to either give one team a bye in the first round of playoffs, 
or create the wild card for the best second-place team. In addition, the 
wild card guaranteed that the team with the second best record in each 
league would qualify for the playoffs, even if they were in the same division 
with the team having the best record. Beginning in 2012, a second wild 
card team was added to each league. The two wild card teams in each league

teams went on to win the World Series (Miami, as Florida in 1997 and 2003, 
St. Louis in 2011, and San Francisco in 2014). Four teams won the NL pennant 
but lost the World Series (NY Mets in 2000, San Francisco in 2002, Houston 
in 2005, Colorado in 2007). Four other teams won the division series but
