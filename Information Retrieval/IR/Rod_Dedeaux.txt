Raoul Martial "Rod" Dedeaux (February 17, 1914 – January 5, 2006) was an 
American college baseball coach who compiled what is widely recognized 
as among the greatest records of any coach in the sport's amateur history.[1][2][3][4][5] 
Dedeaux was the head baseball coach at the University of Southern California 
(USC) in Los Angeles for 45 seasons, and retired at age 72 in 1986.[5][6] 
His teams won 11 national titles (College World Series), including a record 
five straight (1970–1974),[7][8] and 28 conference championships.[4] Dedeaux 
was named Coach of the Year six times by the Collegiate Baseball Coaches 
Association and was inducted into its Hall of Fame in 1970. He was named 
"Coach of the Century" by Collegiate Baseball magazine,[9] and was one 
of the ten initial inductees to the College Baseball Hall of Fame.[10] 
Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Dedeaux moved to Los Angeles and graduated 
from Hollywood High School in 1932.[11] He played baseball at the University 
of Southern California for three seasons. Dedeaux then played professional 
baseball briefly in 1935, appearing in two games as a shortstop for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers late in the season. The following year while playing for 
Dayton in the Mid-Atlantic League, he cracked a vertebra while swinging 
in cold weather, and his playing career ended.[11] He then turned to coaching 
in the semi-pro and amateur ranks.[1][9][12] Dedeaux invested $500 to start 
a trucking firm, Dart (Dedeaux Automotive Repair and Transit) Enterprises, 
which he built into a successful regional business.[3][13] When his college 
coach, Sam Barry, entered the U.S. Navy during World War II,[14] he recommended 
Dedeaux to take over the team in 1942 for the war's duration. Upon Barry's 
return in 1946, they served as co-coaches, with Dedeaux running the team 
each year until Barry finished the basketball season.[15][16] USC won its 
first national title in 1948, over Yale, captained by first baseman George 
H. W. Bush. The finals were held at Hyames Field in Kalamazoo, Michigan, 
settled by a 9–2 win in the third and deciding game.[17][18] Following 
Barry's death in September 1950,[19] Dedeaux became the sole coach and 
proceeded to build on the early success to establish the strongest program 
in collegiate baseball. Prior to his retirement in June 1986, Dedeaux's 
teams won ten additional College World Series titles in Omaha, including 
five consecutively (1970–74), the sixth in seven years. No other coach 
won more than three titles until 1997. At USC, Dedeaux coached dozens of 
future major leaguers, including Ron Fairly, Don Buford, Tom Seaver, Dave 
Kingman, Roy Smalley, Fred Lynn, Mark McGwire, and Randy Johnson.[1][9][20] 
Throughout his USC career, he accepted a nominal salary of $1 per year, 
as his trucking business supplied a substantial income.[11] He turned down 
numerous offers of major league coaching positions, including invitations 
from Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda to join his staff, always 
rejecting them due to his preference for the college game and his desire 
to remain close to his family. He retired as the winningest coach in college 
baseball history and with a record of 1,332–571–11 (.699),[21] and for 
the rest of his life remained an honored annual presence at the College 
World Series in Omaha. At to the 1999 edition, the 50th played in Omaha, 
he was given a key to the city by the mayor and a one-minute standing ovation 
by the fans at Rosenblatt Stadium.[22] He was inducted into the American 
Baseball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1970, and in 1999 was named 
the Coach of the Century by Collegiate Baseball magazine.[15] USC played 
its home games at Bovard Field through 1973,[23] and Dedeaux became known 
as "The Houdini of Bovard" for the come-from-behind home-field wins by 
the Trojans. A new baseball field named Dedeaux Field opened in 1974, named 
in honor of the active head coach.[24] Dedeaux was the head coach of the 
United States Olympic team in 1964 (Tokyo) and 1984 (Los Angeles),[25] 
both times as a demonstration sport.[26] Baseball was elevated to full 
medal status in 1992, but only through 2008.[27] Dedeaux also served as 
the baseball coach and consultant for actors and ballplayers on the 1989 
film Field of Dreams. While Dedeaux was critical of the "phoniness that 
was in baseball movies", which he acquired working as an extra in the 1948 
film The Babe Ruth Story, he accepted the task after reading the original 
novel Shoeless Joe, and brought Buford along to help him coach the cast.[28][29] 
Phil Alden Robinson, who directed the film, said the following about Dedeaux:[30] 
Dedeaux was married to the former Helen L. Jones (1915–2007) for 66 years, 
and they had four children. Dedeaux died in early 2006 at age 91 at Glendale 
Adventist Medical Center in Glendale,[5] of complications from a stroke 
five weeks earlier.[27][31] Six months later on July 4, he was one of ten 
in the first class inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame.[10][32][33] 
Dedeaux was also inducted in the inaugural class of the Omaha College Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 2013, and a statue of him was unveiled at Dedeaux Field 
on the USC campus in 2014. Dedeaux and his wife Helen are buried in Los
