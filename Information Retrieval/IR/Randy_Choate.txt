Randol Doyle "Randy" Choate (born September 5, 1975) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. The New York Yankees selected him 
in the 1997 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft from Florida State University. 
Choate made his MLB debut for the Yankees in 2000 and he has also pitched 
for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Tampa Bay Rays, Florida/Miami Marlins, Los 
Angeles Dodgers, and St. Louis Cardinals. He won the 2000 World Series 
with the Yankees, beating the New York Mets. As a left-handed relief pitcher, 
Choate appears mainly in matchups against left-handed hitters, who, through 
2013, batted .197 against him in his career. His pitching style features 
a sidearm-delivery style that hides the ball effectively from left-handed 
hitters, while only marginally so against right-handed hitters. His repertoire 
features almost exclusively a sinking fastball and slider combination. 
Choate was born in San Antonio, Texas. He attended Churchill High School 
in San Antonio,[1] and was a letterman in baseball. He then attended Florida 
State University, where he was a third team College All-American in 1996 
and a second team College All-American and Atlantic Coast Conference All-Star 
in 1997. Choate was drafted by the New York Yankees in the fifth round 
of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft and made his professional debut 
with the Class-A Oneonta Yankees later that season. He split 1998 between 
the Greensboro Bats and the Tampa Yankees and spent all of 1999 with Tampa 
before being promoted to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers in 2000. Choate 
made his Major League debut on July 1, 2000, as a member of the New York 
Yankees, retiring the only batter he faced in a 6–1 win over the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field. In his 22 games for the Yankees that 
year, Choate had a record of 0–1 with a 4.76 ERA, and was a part of the 
World Series-winning club. After a career best 3–1 record with 3.35 ERA 
in 2001, he was less effective in 2002 and 2003, playing in just 23 games 
with a 6.23 ERA. He also spent considerable time in the minors with Columbus. 
The Yankees traded Choate to the Montreal Expos with Nick Johnson and Juan 
Rivera for Javier Vázquez on December 16, 2003. The following March 27, 
the Expos then traded him to the Arizona Diamondbacks for pitcher John 
Patterson. Choate appeared in 74 games for the Diamondbacks, the most number 
of games by a left-handed pitcher in Diamondbacks history and the fourth-highest 
by any pitcher in franchise history. He also achieved a 2–4 record with 
a 4.62 ERA. In 2005 and 2006, Choate played in 90 games. However, he played 
a vast majority of the 2006 season with Arizona's Triple-A affiliate, the 
Tucson Sidewinders, playing a key role in the bullpen, by helping them 
win the Pacific Coast League championship. Choate later signed a minor 
league contract with the Minnesota Twins on January 9, 2007, but chose 
to become a free agent on March 24 after being reassigned to a minor league 
camp three days earlier. He signed a minor league contract to return to 
the Diamondbacks in April 2007, and was assigned to Tucson. The Diamondbacks 
purchased his contract from Tucson on June 26, 2007,[2] but he made only 
two appearances before he was designated for assignment on June 28.[3] 
On November 14, 2007, the Milwaukee Brewers signed him to a one-year contract. 
During spring training 2008, Choate broke a bone in his left hand.[4] In 
mid-June, he began his rehab assignment in the minors. He pitched for the 
first time in the 2008 season for the High-A Brevard County Manatees. He 
was next moved up to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. On July 10, Choate 
was sent outright to the minors. He became a free agent at the end of the 
season. Choate signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays on 
January 6, 2009. He earned his first career save on May 29, 2009, against 
the Minnesota Twins. In 2010, Choate led the American League in appearances 
with 85 while pitching a total of 44 2⁄3 innings. In two seasons with the 
Rays, he was 5–3 with a 3.89 ERA in 146 games. In a span of 97 consecutive 
appearances from September 10, 2010, to June 12, 2012, Choate allowed one 
or zero hits each time. On December 15, 2010, Choate agreed to a two-year, 
$2.5 million deal with the Florida Marlins. He was 1–1 with a 2.16 ERA 
in 98 games over the next season and a half with the Marlins. Choate was 
traded along with Hanley Ramírez to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 25, 
2012, in exchange for Nathan Eovaldi and minor league pitcher Scott McGough.[5] 
With the Dodgers, he appeared in 36 games and had a 4.05 ERA in 13 1⁄3 
innings. His combined totals for the season with the Marlins and Dodgers 
included 80 appearances, leading MLB, and 38 1⁄3 IP, making him the only 
player in MLB history with at least 80 appearances and less than 40 IP 
in a season.[6] On December 7, 2012, Choate signed a three-year, $7.5 million 
contract with the St. Louis Cardinals.[7] On May 20, 2015, he drew a walk 
as a hitter for the first time in his career against the New York Mets.[8] 
He earned his first save with the club in a 1–0 victory over the Atlanta 
Braves on July 25, 2015, getting A. J. Pierzynski to ground into a game-ending 
double play.[9] He became a free agent again when his contract expired 
after the 2015 season.[10] On March 11, 2016, Choate signed a minor league 
contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.[11] He was released on March 29.[12] 
On June 12, 2016, Choate signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. In 24 games for the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers, he had a 5.56 ERA. 
He was released on September 1, 2016. Featuring a sidearm-delivery style 
with a repertoire of almost exclusively sinking fastballs and sliders, 
one of Choate's strengths is inducing ground balls from left-handed hitters 
with runners on base, especially for double plays. In 2011, Choate's sinker 
induced a ground ball rate of 71.4%. His slider has broad side-to-side 
movement, inducing a 19.5% swing-and-miss rate. In 2011 and 2012, he produced 
11.31 and 8.84 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9) rates, respectively, 
despite his fastball speeds average just 86 miles per hour (138 km/h) to
