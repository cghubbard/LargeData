In association football, replays were often used to decide the winner in 
a knock-out tournament when the previous match ended in a tie, especially 
in finals. In 1970, FIFA (the worldwide governing body of the sport) and 
IFAB (the international rules committee for the sport) allowed penalty 
shoot-outs to be held if a match ended in a tie. The penalty shootout made 
its appearance immediately thereafter. The first instance of a shootout 
replacing a replay (rather than lots) was the final of the 1976 European 
championship. The shootout's first use at the World Cup took place in the 
1982 semi-finals. Replays are now only used in the early rounds of the 
English FA Cup tournament, as well as rounds up until the semi-finals in 
the Scottish Cup. In boxing, rematches (referred to as "rematch" and not 
"replay") have produced some historically significant moments in the sport.
