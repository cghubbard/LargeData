The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system owned by the City of 
New York and leased to the New York City Transit Authority,[12] a subsidiary 
agency of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority.[13] Opened 
in 1904, the New York City Subway is one of the world's oldest public transit 
systems, one of the world's most used metro systems, and the metro system 
with the most stations and the most trackage.[14] It offers service 24 
hours per day and every day of the year.[15] The New York City Subway is 
the largest rapid transit system in the world by number of stations, with 
469 stations in operation[15] (422, if stations connected by transfers 
are counted as single stations).[1] Stations are located throughout the 
boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The Staten Island 
Railway is not officially considered part of the subway, as it lacks a 
rail link with the subway system, so passengers traveling to another borough 
take a ferry or bus.[15] The Port Authority Trans-Hudson[16] and the AirTrain 
JFK,[17] in Manhattan and Queens respectively, accept the subway's MetroCard 
but are not part of the subway;[18] thus, free transfers are not allowed. 
The system is also one of the world's longest. Overall, the system contains 
233 miles (375 km) of routes,[6][8] translating into 660 miles (1,060 km) 
of revenue track;[8][9] and a total of 846 miles (1,362 km) including non-revenue 
trackage.[8] By annual ridership, the New York City Subway is the busiest 
rapid transit rail system in the United States and in the Western world, 
as well as the seventh busiest rapid transit rail system in the world; 
the metro (subway) systems in Beijing, Seoul, Shanghai, Moscow, Tokyo, 
and Guangzhou record a higher annual ridership.[19] In 2015, the subway 
delivered over 1.76 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.7 million 
daily rides on weekdays and a combined 5.9 million rides each weekend (3.3 
million on Saturdays; 2.7 million on Sundays).[1] Ridership continues to 
increase, and on September 23, 2014, more than 6.1 million people rode 
the subway system, establishing the highest single-day ridership since 
ridership was regularly monitored in 1985.[20][note 7] All services pass 
through Manhattan except for the G train, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, 
and the Rockaway Park Shuttle. Large portions of the subway outside Manhattan 
are elevated, on embankments, or in open cuts, and a few stretches of track 
run at ground level. In total, 40% of track is not underground despite 
the "subway" moniker.[21] Many lines and stations have both express and 
local services. These lines have three or four tracks. Normally, the outer 
two are used for local trains, while the inner one or two are used for 
express trains. Stations served by express trains are typically major transfer 
points or destinations.[15] Alfred Ely Beach built the first demonstration 
for an underground transit system in New York City in 1869 and opened it 
in February 1870.[22][23] His Beach Pneumatic Transit only extended 312 
feet (95 m) under Broadway in Lower Manhattan operating from Warren Street 
to Murray Street[24] and exhibited his idea for a subway propelled by pneumatic 
tube technology. The tunnel was never extended for political and financial 
reasons, although extensions had been planned to take the tunnel southward 
to The Battery and northwards towards the Harlem River.[25] In 1912, workers 
excavating for the present-day BMT Broadway Line dug into the old Beach 
tunnel; today, no part of this line remains as the tunnel was completely 
within the limits of the present day City Hall Station under Broadway.[26][27][28][29] 
The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped demonstrate the benefits of an underground 
transportation system.[30] A plan for the construction of the subway was 
approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900.[31] The first underground 
line of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the 
opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT 
Ninth Avenue Line.[32][33][34] The fare was $0.05[35] and on the first 
day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers.[36] The oldest structure 
still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in 
Brooklyn[37][38][39][40][41] and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line.[42] 
The oldest right-of-way, which is part of the BMT West End Line near Coney 
Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, 
Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.[43][44][45] By the time the first subway 
opened, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, 
the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit 
Corporation (BMT)) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The 
city built most of the lines and leased them to the companies.[46] The 
first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) 
opened in 1932;[47] this system was intended to compete with the private 
systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down, but stayed 
within the core of the City due to its small startup capital.[12] This 
required it to be run 'at cost', necessitating fares up to double the five-cent 
fare popular at the time.[48] In 1940, the city bought the two private 
systems. Some elevated lines ceased service immediately while others closed 
soon after.[49] Integration was slow, but several connections were built 
between the IND and BMT;[50][51][52] these now operate as one division 
called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, sharper curves, and stations 
are too small and therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT 
remains its own division, the A Division.[53] However, many passenger transfers 
between stations of all three former companies have been created, allowing 
the entire network to be treated as a single unit.[54] The New York City 
Transit Authority (NYCTA), a public authority presided by New York City, 
was created in 1953 to take over subway, bus, and streetcar operations 
from the city, and placed under control of the state-level Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority in 1968.[54][55] Organized in 1934 by transit 
workers of the BRT, IRT, and IND,[56] the Transport Workers Union of America 
Local 100 remains the largest and most influential local of the labor unions.[57] 
Since the union's founding, there have been three union strikes over contract 
disputes with the MTA:[58] 12 days in 1966,[59][60] 11 days in 1980,[61] 
and three days in 2005.[62][63] By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City 
Subway was at an all-time low.[64][65] Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, 
and graffiti and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway 
was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems 
were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in 
the 1980s,[66][67] make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, 
as well as order 1,775 new subway cars.[68] By the early 1990s, conditions 
had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during 
those 20 years are still being fixed today.[65] Entering the 21st century, 
progress continued despite several disasters. The September 11 attacks 
resulted in service disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan, 
particularly the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which ran directly underneath 
the World Trade Center.[69] Sections of the tunnel, as well as the Cortlandt 
Street station, which was directly underneath the Twin Towers, were severely 
damaged. Rebuilding required the suspension of service on that line south 
of Chambers Street. Ten other nearby stations were closed for cleanup. 
By March 2002, seven of those stations had reopened. The rest (except for 
Cortlandt Street on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)[70] reopened 
on September 15, 2002, along with service south of Chambers Street.[70][71] 
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc, flooding several underwater tunnels 
and other facilities near New York Harbor. The immediate damage was fixed 
within six months but long-term resiliency and rehabilitation projects 
continue.[72] When the IRT subway debuted in 1904,[32][33] the typical 
tunnel construction method was cut-and-cover.[73][74] The street was torn 
up to dig the tunnel below before being rebuilt from above.[73][74] Traffic 
on the street above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street.[75] 
Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.[76] 
Contractors in this type of construction faced many obstacles, both natural 
and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations, and ground water, 
which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas 
mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways 
had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings 
often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning 
to ensure stability.[77] This method worked well for digging soft dirt 
and gravel near the street surface.[73] However, tunnelling shields were 
required for deeper sections, such as the Harlem and East River tunnels, 
which used cast-iron tubes. Segments between 33rd and 42nd streets under 
Park Avenue, 116th Street and 120th Street under Broadway, and 145th Street 
and Dyckman Street (Fort George) under Broadway and Saint Nicholas Avenue 
as well as the tunnel from 96th Street to Central Park North–110th Street 
& Lenox Avenue, used either rock or concrete-lined tunnels.[73][74] About 
40% of the subway system runs on surface or elevated tracks, including 
steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, 
open cuts and surface routes.[78] All of these construction methods are 
completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most 
crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. 
The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service 
are the 142nd Street junction[79] and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose 
tracks both intersect at the same level.[80][81] The 7,700 workers who 
built the original subway lines were mostly immigrants living in Manhattan.[31][82] 
More recent projects use tunnel boring machines, which increase the cost. 
They minimize disruption at street level and avoid already existing utilities.[83] 
Examples of such projects include the extension of the IRT Flushing Line[84][85][86][87] 
and the IND Second Avenue Line.[88][89][90][91] Since the opening of the 
original New York City Subway line in 1904,[32][33] various official and 
planning agencies have proposed numerous extensions to the subway system. 
One of the more expansive proposals was the "IND Second System", part of 
a plan to construct new subway lines in addition to taking over existing 
subway lines and railroad rights-of-way. The most grandiose IND Second 
Subway plan, conceived in 1929, was to be part of the city-operated IND, 
and was to comprise almost 1⁄3 of the current subway system.[92][93] By 
1939, with unification planned, all three systems were included within 
the plan, which was ultimately never carried out.[94][95] Many different 
plans were proposed over the years of the subway's existence, but expansion 
of the subway system mostly stopped during World War II.[96] Though most 
of the routes proposed over the decades have never seen construction, discussion 
remains strong to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway 
capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the Second 
Avenue Subway. Plans for new lines date back to the early 1910s, and expansion 
plans have been proposed during many years of the system's existence.[92][97] 
After the IND Sixth Avenue Line was completed in 1940,[98] the city went 
into great debt, and only 29 new stations have been added to the system 
since. Five stations were on the abandoned New York, Westchester and Boston 
Railway-operated IRT Dyre Avenue Line,[99] fourteen stations were on the 
abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line),[100] 
six were on the Archer Avenue Lines[101] and 63rd Street Lines[102] (built 
as part of a 1968 plan), two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were 
part of the Chrystie Street Connection,[103][104] the Harlem–148th Street 
terminal,[105] and the 7 Subway Extension to the west side of Manhattan.[106][note 
8] Many rapid transit systems run relatively static routings, so that a 
train "line" is more or less synonymous with a train "route". In New York 
City, however, routings change often because of changes in the availability 
of connections or the setup of service patterns. Within the nomenclature 
of the subway, the "line" describes the physical railroad track or series 
of tracks that a train "route" uses on its way from one terminal to another. 
"Routes" (also called "services") are distinguished by a letter or a number 
and "Lines" have names. They are also designations for trains, as exemplified 
in the Billy Strayhorn song "Take the "A" Train".[15] There are 25 train 
services in the subway system, including three short shuttles. Each route 
has a color and a local or express designation representing the Manhattan 
trunk line of the particular service. The color lime green is exclusively 
assigned to the Crosstown Line route, which operates entirely outside Manhattan, 
while the shuttles are all assigned dark slate gray.[111][112] The lines 
and services are not referred to by color (e.g., Blue Line or Green Line) 
by native New Yorkers or by most New York City residents, but out-of-towners 
and tourists often refer to the subway lines by color.[15][113][114] The 
1, 6, 7, C, G, L, M, R, and W trains are fully local and make all stops. 
The 2, 3, 4, 5, <6>, <7>, A, B, D, E, F, N and Q trains have portions of 
express and local service. The J train normally operates local, but during 
rush hours it is joined by the Z train in the peak direction; both the 
J and Z run local, express or skip-stop on different parts of their shared 
route. The letter S is used for three shuttle services: Franklin Avenue 
Shuttle, Rockaway Park Shuttle, and 42nd Street Shuttle.[112][115] Though 
the subway system operates on a 24-hour basis,[15] during late night hours 
some of the designated routes do not run, run as a shorter route (often 
referred to as the 'shuttle train' version of its full-length counterpart) 
or run with a different stopping pattern. These are usually indicated by 
smaller, secondary route signage on station platforms.[112][116] Because 
there is no nightly system shutdown for maintenance, tracks and stations 
must be maintained while the system is operating. This work sometimes necessitates 
service changes during midday, overnight hours, and weekends.[117][118] 
See also FASTRACK below. When parts of lines are temporarily shut down 
for construction purposes, the transit authority can substitute free shuttle 
buses (using MTA Regional Bus Operations bus fleet) to replace the routes 
that would normally run on these lines.[119] The transit authority announces 
planned service changes through its website,[120] via placards that are 
posted on station and interior subway-car walls,[121] and through its Twitter 
page.[122] Current official transit maps of the New York City Subway are 
based on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically 
accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the 
smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major 
city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on 
June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller.[115][123] 
Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while 
being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically 
inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo 
Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern 
classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical 
elements.[124][125] A late night-only version of the map was introduced 
on January 30, 2012.[126] On September 16, 2011, the MTA introduced a Vignelli-style 
interactive subway map, "The Weekender",[127] to its website;[128] as the 
title suggests,[129] the online map provides information about any planned 
work, from late Friday night to early Monday morning.[130][131] Several 
privately produced schematics are available online or in printed form, 
such as those by Hagstrom Map.[132] Additionally, the New York City subway 
map has served as the subject of artistic endeavors. Late night subway

The NYC Subway map as a theme of art Out of the 469 stations, 467 are served 
24 hours a day.[note 9] Underground stations in the New York City Subway 
are typically accessed by staircases going down from street level. Many 
of these staircases are painted in a common shade of green, with slight 
or significant variations in design.[133] Other stations have unique entrances 
reflective of their location or date of construction. Several station entrance 
stairs, for example, are built into adjacent buildings.[133] Nearly all 
station entrances feature color-coded globe or square lamps signifying 
their status as an entrance.[134] Out of all the stations on the New York 
City Subway, This means that 61% of the stations are below the surface 
(59% being fully underground and about 2% with most of the station below 
the surface). 39% of stations are above the surface or overground.[135] 
Many stations in the subway system have mezzanines.[136] Mezzanines allow 
for passengers to enter from multiple locations at an intersection and 
proceed to the correct platform without having to cross the street before 
entering. Inside mezzanines are fare control areas, where passengers physically 
pay their fare to enter the subway system.[74][136][137] In many older 
stations, the fare control area is at platform level with no mezzanine 
crossovers.[74][138] Many elevated stations also have platform-level fare 
control with no common station house between directions of service.[42] 
Upon entering a station, passengers may use station booths (formerly known 
as token booths)[139] or vending machines to buy their fare, which is currently 
stored in a MetroCard. Each station has at least one booth, typically located 
at the busiest entrance.[140] After swiping the card at a turnstile, customers 
enter the fare-controlled area of the station and continue to the platforms.[15] 
Inside fare control are "Off-Hours Waiting Areas", which consist of benches 
and are identified by a yellow sign.[15][141][142] A typical subway station 
has waiting platforms ranging from 480 to 600 feet (150 to 180 m) long, 
though some IND platforms may be as long as 660 to 745 feet (201 to 227 m) 
long.[48][143] Platforms of former commuter rail stations, such as those 
on the IND Rockaway Line, are even longer. Due to the large number of transit 
lines, one platform or set of platforms often serve more than one service. 
Passengers need to look at the overhead signs at the platform entrance 
steps and over each track to see which trains stop there and when, and 
at the arriving train to see which one it is.[15] There are a number of 
common platform configurations: Since the majority of the system was built 
before 1990, the year the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into 
effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be handicapped-accessible.[144] 
Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to 
comply with the ADA. (Most grade-level stations required little modification 
to meet ADA standards.) In addition, the MTA identified "key stations", 
high-traffic and/or geographically important stations, which must conform 
to the ADA when they are extensively renovated. As of March 2016, there 
are 103 currently accessible stations; many of them have AutoGate access.[15][145] 
Under the current MTA plans, the number of ADA accessible stations will 
go up to 144 by 2020.[146] The MTA has been sued by a disability rights 
group for not including an elevator during the $21,000,000 renovation of 
the Middletown Road subway station in the Bronx. Only 19% of all of the 
subway system's stations are fully accessible to people with disabilities.[147] 
As of December 2015, the New York City Subway has 6,407 cars on the roster.[148][149] 
A typical New York City Subway train consists of 8 to 11 cars, although 
shuttles can have as few as two, and the train can range from 150 to 600 
feet (46 to 183 m) in length.[150] The system maintains two separate fleets 
of cars, one for the A Division routes and another for the B Division routes.[151] 
All B Division equipment is about 10 feet (3.05 m) wide and either 60 feet 
6 inches (18.44 m) or 75 feet (22.86 m) long, whereas A Division equipment 
is approximately 8 feet 9 inches (2.67 m) wide and 51 feet 4 inches (15.65 m) 
long.[152] A portion of the 60-foot B Division fleet is used for operation 
in the BMT Eastern Division, where 75-foot (22.86 m) long cars are not 
permitted.[153][154] Cars purchased by the City of New York since the inception 
of the IND and the other divisions beginning in 1948 are identified by 
the letter "R" followed by a number; e.g.: R32.[151] This number is the 
contract number under which the cars were purchased.[155] Cars with nearby 
contract numbers (e.g.: R1 through R9, or R26 through R29, or R143 through 
R160B) may be relatively identical, despite being purchased under different 
contracts and possibly built by different manufacturers.[156] Since 1999, 
the R142, R142A, R143, R160, and R188 cars have been placed into service.[157][158] 
These cars are collectively known as New Technology Trains (NTTs) due to 
modern innovations such as LED and LCD route signs and information screens, 
as well as recorded train announcements and the ability to facilitate Communication-Based 
Train Control (CBTC).[159][160] Live conductor announcements can still 
be made. On March 24, 2012, the MTA announced that it ordered 300 R179 
subway cars from Bombardier.[161] The total price of the contract is US$599 
million, with the first test train of ten cars arriving in June 2016, due 
to ongoing delivery problems.[162][163] Riders pay a single fare to enter 
the subway system and may transfer between trains at no extra cost until 
they exit via station turnstiles; the fare is a flat rate regardless of 
how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their MetroCard 
upon entering the subway system, but not a second time upon leaving.[164] 
As of April 2016[update], nearly all fares are paid by MetroCard;[165] 
the base fare is $2.75 when purchased in the form of a reusable "pay per 
ride" MetroCard,[164] with the last fare increase occurring on March 22, 
2015.[166] Single-use cards may be purchased for $3.00, and 7-day and 30-day 
unlimited ride cards can lower the effective per-ride fare significantly.[167] 
Reduced fares are available for the elderly and people with disabilities.[15][168] 
Currency collected throughout the system is handled by the Money room. 
In November 1993,[169] the subway system introduced a fare system called 
the MetroCard, which allows riders to use cards that store the value equal 
to the amount paid to a station booth clerk or vending machine.[170] The 
MetroCard was enhanced in 1997 to allow passengers to make free transfers 
between subways and buses within two hours; several MetroCard-only transfers 
between subway stations were added in 2001.[171][172] With the addition 
of unlimited-ride MetroCards in 1998 (for 7-day and 30-day periods,[173] 
later 1-day "Fun Pass" and 14-day periods, both of which have been discontinued),[174] 
the New York City Transit system was the last major transit system in the 
United States with the exception of BART in San Francisco to introduce 
passes for unlimited bus and rapid transit travel.[175] In January 2014, 
the MTA stated that it wants to implement a contactless fare system to 
replace the MetroCard by 2019.[176][177][178] In January 2012,[179][180] 
the MTA introduced a new maintenance program, FASTRACK, to speed up repair 
work. This program involves a more drastic approach than previous construction, 
and completely shuts down a major portion of a line for overnight work 
on four consecutive weeknights from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.[181] According to 
the MTA, this new program proved much more efficient and quicker than regular 
service changes, especially because it happened at night and not the weekend, 
when most transit closures had occurred before.[182] In 2012 the program 
only closed lines in Midtown and Lower Manhattan,[183][184][185][186][note 
10] while in 2013 it expanded to other corridors requiring minimal shuttle 
buses[187][note 11] and in 2014 to even more locations.[188] There were 
corridors scheduled for 2014 during 24 weeks of the year,[note 12] and 
in 2015 there were 12 corridors scheduled during 22 weeks.[189] In 2016, 
there are 13 corridors scheduled during 21 weeks.[190] In 2003, the MTA 
signed a $160 million contract with Siemens Transportation Systems to install 
digital real-time message boards (officially Public Address Customer Information 
Screens, or PA/CIS[191]) at 158 of its IRT stations to display the number 
of minutes until the arrival of the next trains.[192] Payments to the company 
were stopped in May 2006 following many technical problems and delays[193] 
and MTA started to look for alternative suppliers and technologies.[192] 
In January 2007 Siemens announced that the issues had been resolved and 
that screens would start appearing at 158 stations by the end of the year.[194] 
In 2008, the system-wide roll-out was pushed back again, to 2011, with 
the MTA citing technical problems.[195][196] An in-house simpler system 
developed by MTA for the L train was operational by early 2009[192][197] 
and the first three displays of the larger Siemens system became operational 
at stations on the IRT Pelham Line (6 <6> trains) in the Bronx in December 
2009.[198] Siemens signs were in operation in 110 A Division stations by 
March 2011[199][200][201][202][203][204] and in 153 IRT mainline and 24 
Canarsie Line stations by late 2011.[191] Simpler countdown clocks, which 
only announce the track on which the train is arriving and the number of 
stops the train is from the station, are used at 40 stations. This includes 
thirteen stations on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, nineteen stations on 
the IND Eighth Avenue Line,[191] three stations on the BMT Broadway Line, 
and five stations on the BMT Astoria Line;[205] however, the clocks on 
the Broadway and Astoria Lines are not in use as of 2016[update].[191] 
The announcements are voiced by radio traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast[206] 
and Carolyn Hopkins.[207] In 2012, real-time station information for the 
1 through 6 trains and the 42nd Street Shuttle was made available, through 
MTA's 'Subway Time' mobile app and as open data, to third party developers 
via a API.[208] In early 2014, data for the L train were also given to 
developers.[209] Displays at 22 IRT Flushing Line and the 5 IRT Dyre Avenue 
Line stations are not expected to be operational until the late 2010s, 
with the delay being attributed to upgrades to upgrading the signal system 
with CBTC for the IRT Flushing Line stations and to signal modernizations 
for IRT Dyre Avenue Line stations.[210] Displays at 267 B Division stations 
will be installed as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.[211] Upon the 
October 2015 approval of funding for the 2015–2019 capital program, full 
installation of the countdown clocks was deferred to beyond 2020, with 
323 out of 472 stations[note 13] having countdown clocks by then.[212] 
This was attributed to the rate of installation of wi-fi and 3G systems 
in subway stations, which, among other things, makes countdown clocks viable.[213] 
The B, D, and N were expected to get countdown clocks in 2016; the B and 
D would get the PA/CIS along their shared IND Concourse Line stations, 
the D along the BMT West End Line, and the N along the BMT Sea Beach Line.[213][214] 
Meanwhile, the IRT Flushing Line (7 <7>) was to get the clocks in 2018, 
a delay from an earlier announced date of 2016.[213] In August 2016, a 
90-day testing period began for updated countdown clocks on eight BMT Broadway 
Line stations on the N Q R W services. The clocks feature new LCD screens 
as opposed to the old LED screens. The countdown clocks can show the date 
and time, current weather, next trains, advertisements, other media, and 
service changes, unlike the current countdown clocks, which can only show 
the date and time and the next train arrivals. The LCD clocks also use 
data from the Bluetooth receivers in the stations, which connect with Bluetooth 
receivers installed on the first and last cars of every train. If the test 
is successful, then the remaining 269 B Division stations will receive 
the new LCD countdown clocks.[215] The MTA was able to speed up the test 
by using Bluetooth receivers and existing wireless in stations. As opposed 
to the countdown clocks on the numbered lines, the system calculates when 
the trains will pull into their next stop based on when trains enter and 
leave the stations.[216] The countdown clocks for the rest of the B Division 
will be installed as part of the Integrated Service Information and Management – 
B Division (ISIM-B) project, which will upgrade signal towers and connect 
track circuits to a central database.[217] The MTA signed a deal with MasterCard 
in the first few months of 2006 to test out a new RFID card payment scheme.[218] 
Customers had to sign up at a special MasterCard website and use a MasterCard 
PayPass credit or debit card/tag to participate. Participating stations 
included IRT Lexington Avenue Line (4 5 6 <6> trains) from the Third Avenue–138th 
Street and 138th Street–Grand Concourse stations in the Bronx to Borough 
Hall in Brooklyn, as well as the Court Square–23rd Street in Queens for 
the E M 7 <7> trains.[219] Originally scheduled to end in December 2006, 
the trial was extended into 2007 due to "overwhelming positive response".[220] 
In light of the success of the first PayPass pilot project in 2006, another 
trial was started by the MTA. This one started on June 1, 2010, and ended 
on November 30, 2010. The first two months started with the customer just 
using the MasterCard PayPass debit or credit card.[221][222][223][224] 
However, this trial was the debut of having a rider use the VISA PayWave 
debit or credit card to enter the system, which started on August 1, 2010.[225] 
For six months, a rider could use either a MasterCard Paypass or VISA PayWave 
credit/debit card to pay for a fare on an expanded list of subway and bus 
routes.[226][227][note 14] The MTA set up another technology pilot project 
for the New York City Subway called "Help Point" on April 5, 2011. Help 
Point is a new digital-audio communications system for use in case of an 
emergency or to obtain subway information for travel directions.[228] The 
top button is labeled red for emergencies and connects to the Rail Control 
Center. The bottom button is labeled green and connects to a MTA station 
agent for any inquiries. All units are equipped with a microphone and speaker,[229] 
and can optionally be installed with a camera.[230] Also, the test units 
were equipped for the hearing impaired (under ADA compliance).[231] The 
two subway stations that were part of this trial were on the IRT Lexington 
Avenue Line. They were the 23rd Street and the Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall 
stations. The Help Points at the Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall station were 
wireless, while those at the 23rd Street station ones were hard-wired, 
to test which type of transmission is best for the subway.[232][233] After 
the Help Point test was successfully completed, the MTA started to install 
Help Points in all 469 subway stations to replace the existing Customer 
Assistance Intercom (CAI) units.[232] The help points were to be installed 
in 139 stations by 2014, and the remaining 333 stations would have Help 
Points by the end of 2019.[234] On September 19, 2011, the MTA set up another 
pilot project, an online, interactive touchscreen computer program called 
"On The Go! Travel Station" (OTG). It lists any planned work or service 
changes occurring on the subway as well as information to help travelers 
find landmarks or locales near the stations with an OTG outlet, with advertisements 
as well. The first station to test this new technology was Bowling Green 
on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line.[235] Other stations scheduled to participate 
in this program were Penn Station (with the LIRR), Grand Central Terminal 
(with Metro-North), Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and Jackson 
Heights–Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street–Broadway in Queens.[176][236] New 
and existing On the Go! kiosks were to receive an interface overhaul as 
a result of the MTA's partnership with Control Group, a technology and 
design consultancy firm. Control Group were adding route lookups, countdown 
to train arrivals, and service alerts. Between 47 and 90 interactive wayfinding 
kiosks were scheduled to be deployed in 2013.[237] As of January 2016[update], 
there are 155 kiosks at 31 stations.[238] New York City Subway began to 
provide underground cellular phone with voice and data service, and free 
Wi-Fi to passengers in 2011 at six stations. The new network was installed 
and owned by Transit Wireless as part of company's $200 million investment. 
The company expanded the services to 30 more stations in 2013[239][240] 
and signed an agreement with all 4 major wireless network operators (Verizon 
Wireless, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile) to allow their cellular phone customers 
to use its network. The MTA and Transit Wireless are splitting the fees 
received from those wireless carriers for the usage of the network.[241] 
The Wi-Fi service, which operates using antennae,[242] is operated by Boingo 
Wireless.[243] Transit Wireless expects to provide service to the remaining 
241 underground stations by 2017, including the three deep-level subway 
stations under construction. The next 40 key stations (11 in midtown Manhattan 
and 29 in Queens) have antennas that were in service by March 2014.[176][244] 
The wireless for these 40 underground stations were completed by October 
2014. Phase 3 of the project was completed in March 2015 and added service 
to the Flushing-Main St station in Queens, as well as stations in Lower 
Manhattan, West Harlem and Washington Heights.[245] Phase 4 of the project 
covered twenty underground stations in the Bronx and seventeen in Upper 
Manhattan; this phase, completed in November 2015, provided service to 
major stations such as Lexington Avenue–53rd Street, Lexington Avenue–59th 
Street, 149th Street–Grand Concourse, and 125th Street.[246] Phases 6 and 
7 of the Transit Wireless network build-out will connect the 90 remaining 
Brooklyn and Manhattan underground stations in 2017, about one year ahead 
of schedule.[245] In June 2016, the MTA began installing Wi-Fi in subway 
cars as well. Wireless service was installed on four R160 subway cars assigned 
to the Jamaica Yard, then tested along the all-underground E route; in-car 
Wi-Fi was expanded to 20 R160s on the E route by September.[247] However, 
this pilot program was not advertised to passengers. In addition, the wireless 
service was not working all the time; one passenger described the signal 
on board the trains as spotty, and only really available on the platforms.[248] 
At the time, the MTA was not planning to retrofit subway tunnels with wireless 
service.[248] Still, this in-car Wi-Fi pilot program is part of the wider 
program to install Wi-Fi in underground stations and onboard newer MTA 
buses.[247][249] Future subway cars, like the R211, will also include Wi-Fi 
upon their delivery.[250][251][252] Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, 
thirty-one stations in all five boroughs will undergo a complete overhaul 
and would be entirely closed for up to 6 months at a time, according to 
Governor Andrew Cuomo. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, charging 
stations, improved signage, subway countdown clocks, service alerts, neighborhood 
maps, new art, and improved station lighting.[253][254][255][256][note 
15] The stations would also include glass barriers near fare control areas 
(rather than the current metal fences that separate the paid and unpaid 
areas of the station), as well as new tiled floors that are easy to clean.[256] 
Minor component work, such as station signage, tiling, and lighting, would 
also be performed at over 170 other stations as part of the plan.[253] 
The MTA would also begin designing a new contactless fare payment system 
to replace the MetroCard.[258] In addition, at least 1,025 R211 subway 
cars are expected to be ordered under the plan. The R211s would include 
58-inch (150 cm) wide doors, wider than the current MTA standard of 50 
inches (130 cm), thereby projected to reduce station dwell time by 32%. 
The new cars will have Wi-Fi installed (see above), USB chargers, digital 
advertisements, digital customer information displays, illuminated door 
opening alerts, and security cameras,[250][255][256] unlike the current 
New Technology Trains, which lack these features.[259] Some lines, like 
the IND Eighth Avenue Line, would get communications-based train control 
as part of a larger plan to automate the system.[260] These measures are 
all projected to help reduce overcrowding on the subway, which is prevalent.[255][256] 
Crime, train accidents, suicides and threats of terrorism all impact the 
subway system. The system currently uses Automatic Block Signaling with 
fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops in order to provide safe 
train operation across the whole system.[261] The New York City Subway 
system has, for the most part, used block signalling since its 1904 opening,[32][33] 
and many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s 
and 1960s. These signals work by preventing trains from entering a "block" 
occupied by another train. Typically, the blocks are 1,000 feet (300 m) 
long.[262] If no train is in the block, the signal will light up as green. 
When a train enters the block, the signal turns red, marking the block 
as occupied. The train's maximum speed will depend on how many blocks are 
open in front of it. However, the signals do not register a train's speed, 
nor where in the block the train is located.[263][264] Subway trains are 
stopped mechanically at all signals showing "stop" aspects by automatic 
train stops located alongside the tracks; all cars are equipped with tripcocks. 
Although this is a simple principle of train stops, that wayside trippers 
must not be moved to trip ("stop") position until it is guaranteed that 
the train has fully passed the signal with all its cars.[262][265] Today, 
the majority of all subway delays are caused by signal problems. Whenever 
a track circuit stops working, all of the signals which are affected by 
it turn red, as it is uncertain whether there is a train in that section, 
and the system properly reverts to a safe state.[262] In the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, the MTA began automating the subway by Communication-Based 
Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block 
signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie 
Line, on which the L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing because it 
is a self-contained line that does not operate in conjunction with other 
lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009.[266] Due to an unexpected 
ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service 
from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability 
of the block system.[267] The total cost of the project was $340 million.[262] 
After the success of the BMT Canarsie Line automation, the IRT Flushing 
Line, carrying the 7 <7> trains, was next chosen to be outfitted with CBTC.[268] 
The proposed plan is estimated to cost US $1.4 billion.[269] Eventually, 
the MTA has plans to automate a much larger portion, using One Person Train 
Operation (OPTO) in conjunction with CBTC. At the current pace of installation, 
it would take 175 years for CBTC to be installed at a cost of $20 billion.[262] 
The Flushing line operated at almost 30 trains an hour using the signal 
system installed when the line was built, but after CBTC is installed, 
it is possible that an additional two trains per hour could be operated.[270] 
The New York City Subway uses a system known as Automatic Train Supervision 
(ATS) for dispatching and train routing on the A Division[271] (the Flushing 
line, and the trains used on the 7 <7> services, do not have ATS.)[271] 
ATS allows dispatchers in the Operations Control Center (OCC) to see where 
trains are in real time, and whether each individual train is running early 
or late.[271] Dispatchers can hold trains for connections, re-route trains, 
or short-turn trains to provide better service when a disruption causes 
delays.[271] Despite the signal system, there have been at least 64 major 
train accidents since 1918, when a train bound for South Ferry smashed 
into two trains halted near Jackson Avenue on the IRT White Plains Road 
Line in the Bronx.[272] Several accidents resulted when the train operator 
ran through red signals and rear-ended the subway train in front of it; 
this resulted from the signaling practice of "keying by", which allowed 
train operators to bypass red signals. The deadliest accident, the Malbone 
Street Wreck, occurred on November 1, 1918 beneath the intersection of 
Flatbush Avenue, Ocean Avenue, and Malbone Street (the latter of which 
is now Empire Boulevard) near the Prospect Park station of the then-BRT 
Brighton Line in Brooklyn, killing 93 people.[273] As a result of accidents, 
such as the 1995 Williamsburg Bridge crash, timer signals were installed. 
These signals have resulted in reduced speeds across the system. Accidents 
such as derailments are also due to broken equipment, such as the rails 
and the train itself.[272] A portion of subway-related deaths in New York 
consists of suicides committed by jumping in front of an oncoming train. 
Between 1990 and 2003, 343 subway-related suicides have been registered 
out of a citywide total of 7,394 (4.6%) and subway-related suicides increased 
by 30%, despite a decline in overall suicide numbers.[274] Due to increase 
in people hit by trains in 2013,[275] in late 2013 and early 2014 the MTA 
started a test program at one undisclosed station, with four systems and 
strategies to eliminate the number of people hit by trains. Closed-circuit 
television cameras, a web of laser beams stretched across the tracks, radio 
frequencies transmitted across the tracks, and thermal imaging cameras 
focused on the station's tracks were set to be installed at that station.[176] 
At the unidentified station, which is rumored to be Rector Street, tests 
have gone so well at the testing site that these track protection systems 
will be installed systemwide as part of the 2015–2019 capital program.[276] 
The MTA also expressed interest in starting a pilot program to install 
platform edge doors.[277] Several planned stations in the New York City 
Subway may possibly feature platform screen doors, possibly including future 
stations such as those part of the Second Avenue Subway.[278] Currently, 
the MTA is planning a test program to install screen doors at a subway 
station on the BMT Canarsie Line. As part of the 2010–2014 capital program, 
the station was going to be Sixth Avenue, but it is uncertain whether or 
not that this will be the station chosen.[279] Following a series of incidents 
during one week in November 2016, in which 3 people were injured or killed 
after being pushed into tracks, the MTA started to consider installing 
platform edge doors for the 42nd Street Shuttle.[280] Crime rates have 
shown variations over time, with a drop starting in the 1990s and continuing 
today.[281] In order to fight crime, various approaches have been used 
over the years, including an "If You See Something, Say Something" campaign[282] 
and, starting in 2016, banning people who commit a crime in the subway 
system from entering the system for a certain length of time.[283] In the 
1960s, for example, mayor Robert Wagner ordered an increase in the New 
York City Transit Police force from 1,219 to 3,100 officers. During the 
hours at which crimes most frequently occurred (between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.), 
the officers went on patrol in all stations and trains. In response, crime 
rates decreased, as extensively reported by the press.[284] In July 1985, 
however, the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City published a study 
showing riders abandoning the subway, fearing the frequent robberies and 
generally bad circumstances.[285] To counter these developments, policy 
that was rooted in the late 1980s and early 1990s was implemented.[286][287] 
In line with this Fixing Broken Windows philosophy, the New York City Transit 
Authority (NYCTA) began a five-year program to eradicate graffiti from 
subway trains in 1984.[288] In 1993, Mayor Rudy Giuliani took office and 
with Police Commissioner Howard Safir, the strategy was more widely deployed 
in New York under the rubrics of "zero tolerance" and "quality of life". 
Crime rates in the subway and city dropped.[289] Giuliani's campaign credited 
the success to the zero tolerance policy.[290] The extent to which his 
policies deserve the credit is disputed.[291] New York City Police Department 
Commissioner William J. Bratton and author of Fixing Broken Windows, George 
L. Kelling, however, stated the police played an "important, even central, 
role" in the declining crime rates.[285] The trend continued and Giuliani's 
successor, Michael Bloomberg, stated in a November 2004 press release: 
"Today, the subway system is safer than it has been at any time since we 
started tabulating subway crime statistics nearly 40 years ago."[292] After 
the September 11, 2001, attacks, the MTA exercised extreme caution regarding 
anyone taking photographs or recording video inside the system and proposed 
banning all photography and recording in a meeting around June 2004.[293] 
However, due to strong response from both the public and from civil rights 
groups, the rule of conduct was dropped. In November 2004, the MTA again 
put this rule up for approval, but was again denied,[294] though many police 
officers and transit workers still confront or harass people taking photographs 
or video.[295] However, on April 3, 2009, the NYPD issued a directive to 
officers stating that it is legal to take pictures within the subway system 
so long as it is not accompanied with suspicious activity.[296] Currently, 
the MTA Rules of Conduct, Restricted Areas and Activities section states 
that anyone may take pictures or record video, provided that they do not 
use any of three tools: lights, reflectors, or tripods. These three tools 
are permitted only by members of the press who have identification issued 
by the NYPD.[297] On July 22, 2005, in response to bombings in London, 
the New York City Transit Police introduced a new policy of randomly searching 
passengers' bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no 
form of racial profiling would be conducted when these searches actually 
took place. The NYPD has come under fire from some groups that claim purely 
random searches without any form of threat assessment would be ineffectual. 
Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the NYCLU, stated, "This NYPD bag 
search policy is unprecedented, unlawful and ineffective. It is essential 
that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation. 
But our very real concerns about terrorism do not justify the NYPD subjecting 
millions of innocent people to suspicionless searches in a way that does 
not identify any person seeking to engage in terrorist activity and is 
unlikely to have any meaningful deterrent effect on terrorist activity."[298] 
The searches were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit in MacWade v. Kelly.[299] On April 11, 2008, MTA received 
a Ferrara Fire Apparatus Hazardous Materials Response Truck, which went 
into service three days later. It will be used in the case of a chemical 
or bioterrorist attack.[300] Najibullah Zazi and others were arrested in 
September 2009 and pleaded guilty in 2010 to being part of an al-Qaeda 
plan to undertake suicide bombings on the New York City subway system.[301][302] 
The MTA faced a budget deficit of US$1.2 billion in 2009.[303] This resulted 
in fare increases (three times from 2008 to 2010)[304] and service reductions 
(including the elimination of two part-time subway services, the V and 
W). Several other routes were modified as a result of the deficit. The 
N was made a full-time local in Manhattan (in contrast to being a weekend 
local/weekday express before 2010), while the Q was extended nine stations 
north to Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard on weekdays, both to cover the discontinued 
W. The M was combined with the V, routing it over the Chrystie Street Connection, 
IND Sixth Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills–71st 
Avenue on weekdays instead of via the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT West 
End Line to Bay Parkway. The G was truncated to Court Square full-time. 
Construction headways on eleven routes were lengthened, and off-peak service 
on seven routes were lengthened.[305] Several subway lines have reached 
their operational limits in terms of train frequency and passengers, according 
to data released by the Transit Authority. As of June 2007[update], all 
of the A Division services except the 42nd Street Shuttle, as well as the 
E and L trains were beyond capacity, as well as portions of the N train.[306][307] 
In April 2013, New York magazine reported that the system was more crowded 
than it had been in the previous 66 years.[308] The subway reached a daily 
ridership of 6 million for 29 days in 2014, and was expected to record 
a similar ridership level for 55 days in 2015; by comparison, in 2013, 
daily ridership never reached 6 million.[309] In particular, the express 
tracks of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line are 
noted for operating at full capacity during peak hours.[306][310] The Long 
Island Rail Road East Side Access project is expected to bring many more 
commuters to the Lexington Avenue Line when it opens around the year 2022, 
further overwhelming its capacity.[311][312][313] By early 2016, delays 
as a result of overcrowding were up to more than 20,000 every month, four 
times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase 
of assaults because of tense commutes. With less platform space, more passengers 
are forced to be on the edge of the platform resulting in the increased 
possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that 
the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the Airtrain 
JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent 
hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are 
being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity 
of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.[314] The Second 
Avenue Subway, which will have communications-based train control (CBTC), 
will relieve pressure on the Lexington Avenue Line (4 5 6 <6> trains) when 
the Second Avenue Subway's first segment begins operating in December 2016[315] 
by shifting an estimated 225,000 passengers,[316] and CBTC installation 
on the Flushing Line is expected to increase the rate of trains per hour 
on the 7 <7> trains, but little relief will come to other crowded lines 
until later. The L train, which is overcrowded during rush hours, already 
has CBTC operation.[317] The installation of CBTC has reduced the L's running 
time by 3%.[316] Even with CBTC, there are limits on the potential increased 
service. For L service to be increased further, a power upgrade as well 
as additional space for the L to turn around at its Manhattan terminus, 
Eighth Avenue are needed.[118] The MTA is also seeking to implement CBTC 
on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. CBTC is to be installed on this line 
in five phases, with phase one (50th Street/8th Avenue and 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller 
Center to Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike) being included in the 2010–2014 capital 
budget. The $205.8 million contract for the installment of phase one was 
awarded in 2015 to Siemens and Thales. Planning for phase one started in 
2015, with major engineering work to follow in 2017.[310][318] The total 
cost for the entire Queens Boulevard Line is estimated at over $900 million.[319] 
Funding for CBTC on the IND Eighth Avenue Line is also provided in the 
2015–2019 capital project.[320] The MTA projects that 355 miles of track 
will receive CBTC signals by 2029, including most of the IND, as well as 
the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line.[321] The MTA also 
is planning to install CBTC equipment on the IND Crosstown Line, the BMT 
Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line before 2025.[322] As part 
of the installation of CBTC, the whole fleet of subway cars needs to be 
remodeled or replaced.[316] Due to an increase of ridership, the MTA has 
tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, 
specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not 
likely keep up with the growth of subway ridership.[314][323][324] Some 
lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, but there 
are too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.[118] 
As part of the R211 subway car order, the MTA is planning to test a train 
of 10 open-gangway experimental prototype cars, which could increase capacity 
by up to 10% by utilizing the space, that in previous models was the unused 
space between cars.[325][326][327] The MTA also hopes to test other, smaller 
ideas on some services. The F, 6, and 7 trains are expected to get 100 
more "station platform controllers" to manage the flow of passengers on 
and off crowded trains for maximum ridership during rush hours, for a total 
of 129 such employees; these workers would also answer passengers' questions 
about subway directions, rather than having conductors answering them and 
thus delaying the trains.[328][329] Subway guards, the predecessors to 
the platform controllers, were used during the Great Depression and World 
War II.[314] Shortened "next stop" announcements on trains are being tested 
on the 2 and 5 trains. "Step aside" signs on the platforms, reminding boarding 
passengers to let departing passengers off the train first, are being tested 
at Grand Central–42nd Street, 51st Street, and 86th Street on the Lexington 
Avenue Line.[330] Cameras would also be installed so the MTA could observe 
passenger overcrowding.[316][331][332][333] In systems like the London 
Underground, stations just simply get closed off when they are overcrowded, 
such as the busy Oxford Circus tube station, which had to close more than 
100 times in a year. Currently, that type of restriction is not necessary 
just yet, according to MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz.[314] Service on the subway 
system is occasionally disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor 
ones.[334] Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified 
third rail to be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 million gallons 
of water when it is not raining.[335] Since 1992, $357 million has been 
used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked 
to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.[336] Despite these improvements, 
the transit system continues to experience flooding problems. On August 
8, 2007, after more than 3 inches (76 mm) of rain fell within an hour, 
the subway system flooded, causing almost every subway service to either 
be disabled or seriously disrupted, effectively halting the morning rush.[337][338] 
This was the third incident in 2007 in which rain disrupted service. The 
system was disrupted on this occasion because the pumps and drainage system 
can handle only a rainfall rate of 1.75 inches (44 mm) per hour; the incident's 
severity was aggravated by the scant warning as to the severity of the 
storm.[335][339]:10 In addition, as part of a $130 million and an estimated 
18-month project, the MTA began installing new subway grates in September 
2008 in an attempt to prevent rain from overflowing into the subway system. 
The metallic structures, designed with the help of architectural firms 
and meant as a piece of public art, are placed atop existing grates but 
with a 3-to-4-inch (76 to 102 mm) sleeve to prevent debris and rain from 
flooding the subway. The racks will at first be installed in the three 
most flood-prone areas as determined by hydrologists: Jamaica, Tribeca, 
and the Upper West Side. Each neighborhood is scheduled to have its own 
distinct design, some featuring a wave-like deck which increases in height 
and features seating (Jamaica), others with a flatter deck that includes 
seating and a bike rack.[340][341][342] In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy 
caused a lot of damage to New York City, and many subway tunnels were inundated 
with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after 
the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, 
some infrastructure needed years to repair. A year after the storm, MTA 
spokesperson Kevin Ortiz said, "This was unprecedented in terms of the 
amount of damage that we were seeing throughout the system."[343][344] 
The storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway 
lines, and several subway yards, as well as completely destroying a portion 
of the IND Rockaway Line and much of the South Ferry terminal station. 
Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines, as well 
as several long-term closures on the Greenpoint Tunnel, Montague Street 
Tunnel, Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station, with a long-term closure 
planned for the 14th Street Tunnel; some reconstruction is expected to 
last until at least 2020.[345] Flooding at 125th Street after a water main

Announcement about the temporary H shuttle after Hurricane Sandy On August 
27, 2011, due to the approach of Hurricane Irene, the MTA suspended subway 
service at noon in anticipation of heavy flooding on tracks and in tunnels. 
It was the first weather-caused shutdown in the history of the system.[346] 
Service was restored by August 29.[347][348] On October 29, 2012, another 
full closure was ordered before the arrival of Hurricane Sandy.[344] All 
services on the subway, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North were 
gradually shut down that day at 7:00 P.M., to protect passengers, employees 
and equipment from the coming storm.[349] The storm caused serious damage 
to the system, especially the IND Rockaway Line, which had many sections 
between Howard Beach–JFK Airport and Hammels Wye on the Rockaway Peninsula 
heavily damaged, leaving it essentially isolated from the rest of the system.[350][351] 
This required the NYCTA to truck in 20 R32 subway cars to the line to provide 
some interim service (temporarily designated the H).[352][353][354] Also, 
several of the system's tunnels under the East River were flooded by the 
storm surge.[355] South Ferry suffered serious water damage and did not 
reopen until April 4, 2013 by restoring service to the older loop-configured 
station that had been replaced in 2009;[356][357] the stub-end terminal 
tracks remain out of service pending extensive repairs and the new island-platformed 
station is not expected to reopen until 2017.[358][359][360][361] On January 
26, 2015, another full closure was ordered by New York Governor Andrew 
Cuomo due to the January 2015 nor'easter, which was originally projected 
to leave New York City with 20 to 30 inches (51 to 76 cm) of snow.[362] 
The next day, the subway system was partially reopened.[363][364] A number 
of New York City residents criticized Cuomo's decision to shut down the 
subway system for the first time ever due to snow. The nor'easter dropped 
much less snow in the city than originally expected, totaling only 9.8 
inches (25 cm) in Central Park.[365][366] On January 23, 2016, a partial 
subway closure was ordered due to the January 2016 United States blizzard, 
wherein all aboveground stations were closed; the underground lines remained 
open during the blizzard.[367][368] Most of the subway resumed service 
the next day, with some lingering delays due to an average of 26 inches 
(66 cm) of snow in the area.[369] Litter accumulation is a perennial problem 
in the subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, 
as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved 
since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning 
staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the 
subway system.[370][371] The New York City Subway system is infested with 
rats.[372] Rats are sometimes seen on platforms,[373] and are commonly 
seen foraging through garbage thrown onto the tracks. They are believed 
to pose a health hazard, and on rare instances have been known to bite 
humans.[374] Subway stations notorious for rat infestation include Chambers 
Street, Jay Street–MetroTech, West Fourth Street, Spring Street and 145th 
Street.[375] Decades of efforts to eradicate or simply thin the rat population 
in the system have been unsuccessful. In March 2009, the Transit Authority 
announced a series of changes to its vermin control strategy, including 
new poison formulas and experimental trap designs.[376] In October 2011, 
the MTA announced a new initiative to clean 25 subway stations, along with 
their garbage rooms, of rat infestations.[377] Also in October 2011, the 
MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the 
subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative 
is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main 
Street stations.[378] As of March 2016, stations along the BMT Jamaica 
Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and various other stations had their garbage 
cans removed due to the success of the program.[379] There are also vacuum 
trains that are designed to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective 
and often broken.[379] A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City 
Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country based on the 
number of viable bacteria cells.[380] In August 2016, the MTA announced 
that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan 
that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in 
the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train 
delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. Starting 
on September 12, 2016, the MTA will launch an intensive two-week, system-wide 
cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable 
track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. 
Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 
2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.[381] Typical 
subway car exterior in the late 1970s Measures against rats Program for 
removing garbage bins from stations Rolling stock on the New York City 
Subway produces high levels of noise that exceed guidelines set by the 
World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[382] 
In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise 
levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94 dB on platforms.[382] 
Daily exposure to noise at such levels for as little as 30 minutes can 
lead to hearing loss.[382] Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100 dB.[382] 
Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 
1.5 minutes.[382] A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of 
Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4 dB) than 
on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4 dB), 
Metro-North (75.1 dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9 dB).[383] 
Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95 dB is 10 times 
more intense than at 85 dB and 100 times more intense than at 75 dB, and 
so forth.[383] In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1 dB.[383] 
Currently, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, is working to reduce 
the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise, the MTA is investing 
in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and 
neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, 
reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change 
that is going to be made is in the design of stations. Current stations 
were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer 
stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral 
wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With 
less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more 
clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the 
platform, angled so that announcements could be heard by the riders. Some 
of these changes will be in place on the soon-opening Second Avenue Subway.[384] 
The New York City Board of Transportation, and its successor, MTA New York 
City Transit, has had numerous events that promote increased ridership 
of their transit system. From 1941 to 1976, the Board of Transportation/New 
York City Transit Authority sponsored the "Miss Subways" publicity campaign.[385] 
In the musical On the Town, the character Miss Turnstiles is based on the 
Miss Subways campaign.[386][387] The campaign was resurrected in 2004, 
for one year, as "Ms. Subways". It was part of the 100th anniversary celebrations. 
The monthly campaign, which included the winners' photos and biographical 
blurbs on placards in subway cards, featured such winners as Mona Freeman 
and prominent New York City restaurateur Ellen Goodman. The winner of this 
contest was Caroline Sanchez-Bernat, an actress from Morningside Heights.[388] 
Subway Series is a term applied to any series of baseball games between 
New York City teams, as opposing teams can travel to compete merely by 
using the subway system. Subway Series is a term long used in New York, 
going back to series between the Brooklyn Dodgers or New York Giants and 
the New York Yankees in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, the term is used to 
describe the rivalry between the Yankees and the New York Mets. During 
the 2000 World Series, cars on the 4 train (which stopped at Yankee Stadium) 
were painted with Yankee colors, while cars on the 7 train (which stopped 
at Shea Stadium) had Mets colors.[389] The term could also be applied to 
the rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets of the National 
Basketball Association, or the New York Rangers and the New York Islanders 
of the National Hockey League ever since the Nets and the Islanders moved 
to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[390][391] Since 2003, the MTA has operated 
a Holiday Train on Sundays in November and December, from the first Sunday 
after Thanksgiving to the Sunday before Christmas Day.[392] This train 
was made of cars from the R1 through R9 series. The route made all stops 
between Second Avenue in Manhattan and Queens Plaza in Queens via the IND 
Sixth Avenue Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. In 2011, the train 
operated on Saturdays instead of Sundays.[393] The contract, car numbers 
(and year built) used were Arnines, specifically R1 100 (1930), R1 381 
(1931), R4 401 (1932), R4 484 (1932) – Bulls Eye lighting and a test P.A. 
system added in 1946, R6-3 1000 (1935), R6-1 1300 (1937), R7A 1575 (1938) 
– rebuilt in 1947 as a prototype for the R10 subway car, and R9 1802 (1940).[394]
