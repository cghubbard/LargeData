Juan D'Vaughn Pierre (born August 14, 1977) is an American former professional 
baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2000–2013 
for the Colorado Rockies, Florida/Miami Marlins, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies. Known for his speed, 
he stole 614 bases in his career, the 18th most in MLB history at the time 
of his retirement. He now works at MLB Network as an on air analyst. Pierre, 
who was named after Dominican Hall of Fame pitcher Juan Marichal, went 
to high school at Alexandria Senior High School in Alexandria, Louisiana. 
Prior to his professional career, he played at Galveston College and the 
University of South Alabama, where he was 1998 Sun Belt Conference Player 
of the Year. Pierre began his professional career with the Portland Rockies 
of the Northwest League, after being selected by Colorado in the 13th round 
of the 1998 MLB draft. He won the league batting and stolen base titles 
in his first professional season with 38, and was a fan favorite even at 
that level. Pierre moved on to the Asheville Tourists the following year, 
again batting well over .300, and began 2000 with the Carolina Mudcats 
before finishing the year in Colorado. Pierre made his major league debut 
on August 7, 2000, as a pinch runner for the Rockies against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. He made his first start in center field the following day and 
got his first hit in the first inning off José Silva. On November 16, 2002, 
Pierre was traded along with Mike Hampton and cash to the Florida Marlins 
for Charles Johnson, Preston Wilson, Vic Darensbourg, and Pablo Ozuna. 
In the 2003 regular season, Pierre posted a .305 batting average, led the 
NL in games played (162), at bats (668), stolen bases (65), and sacrifice 
hits (15), and led the majors with the lowest strikeout percentage (5.2%),[1] 
During the post-season, he was a major contributor to the Marlins' 2003 
World Series championship. He batted .333 in the World Series and .301 
overall in his first playoff experience. In 2004, he led the National League 
in at-bats (for the second year in a row) with 678; hits (221); triples 
(12); games played (162); bunt hits (24);[2] infield hits (38);[2] (5.2%).[1] 
In addition, he was the only major league player to play every inning of 
each of his team's games. In 2005, Pierre led the National League in games 
played (162), and had the third-lowest strikeout percentage in baseball 
(6.9%).[3] On December 7, 2005, the Marlins traded Pierre to the Chicago 
Cubs, receiving pitchers Sergio Mitre, Ricky Nolasco, and Renyel Pinto 
in exchange. The deal was motivated by the Marlins' need to cut payroll 
after finding itself unable to secure a new stadium deal in South Florida. 
In 2006, while batting .292, Pierre led the NL with 204 hits, winning his 
second hit title, and in at-bats (699), games played (162), bunt hits (21), 
infield hits (30),[4] and in lowest strikeout percentage (5.4%).[5] He 
also tied for the major league lead in times reached base on an error (13),[6] 
and played perfect defensive baseball, earning a fielding percentage of 
1.000. However, he also led the major leagues in outs made (532), the second-highest 
out total for a player since 1982. On November 22, 2006, Pierre signed 
a $44 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[7] In 2007, Pierre 
led the majors in bunt hits (19). He also led the NL in games played (162) 
for the 5th straight year, and singles (164) for the second straight year, 
led the league in sacrifice hits (20), and had the lowest strikeout percentage 
in the NL (5.5%),.[8] He was 2nd in the NL in stolen bases (64), 3rd in 
at bats (668) and plate appearances (729), 4th in hits (196), and 9th in 
triples (8). Going into 2008, the Dodgers signed Andruw Jones to a two-year 
contract to play center field. Because of this, Pierre shifted to left 
field. After a trip to the DL in July, Pierre was moved into a platoon 
in center field with the struggling Jones. When the Dodgers traded for 
Manny Ramirez, Pierre moved to the bench and saw limited action, primarily 
as a pinch runner the rest of the season. Manager Joe Torre said of Pierre 
on MLB.com. "I've delivered bad news to him two years in a row -- first 
with Andruw Jones, then when Manny came on board. He's more understanding 
about being a backup. He's been a pro through this whole thing." After 
nearly 2 years without hitting a home run, Pierre hit a ball into the right 
field seats at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on September 15, 2008. It was Pierre's 
first traditional fly ball home run since August 28, 2006, also in Pittsburgh. 
Prior to the 2009 season started, the Dodgers gave Pierre and his agent 
permission to talk to other teams in hopes of working out a trade, since 
Ramirez's re-signing with the Dodgers pushed Pierre to the backup role 
in left field. When Manny Ramirez received a 50-game suspension, Pierre 
once more became the Dodgers' regular left fielder. During Ramirez's suspension, 
Pierre delivered a stellar performance that drew praise from fans and critics 
alike. However, once Ramirez returned, he resumed his previous role of 
a backup player. In recognition of his hard work, Dodgers fans gave him 
a standing ovation on July 16, the same game where Ramirez had his first 
home game since returning from suspension.[9] On December 15, 2009, Pierre 
was traded to the Chicago White Sox for two minor league pitching prospects 
to be named later (Jon Link and John Ely).[10] Pierre led Major League 
Baseball with 68 stolen bases, the second-most in a single season in franchise 
history after only Rudy Law's 77 in 1983.[11][12] On August 3, 2010, he 
hit his first and only home run of 2010 off of Rick Porcello. On August 
5, 2010, he stole his 500th career base against the Detroit Tigers. In 
2011, Pierre led the major leagues in sacrifice hits (19) and at bats per 
strikeout (15.6), and was caught stealing a major-league-leading 17 times 
(while stealing 27 bases).[13][14] On defense, he tied for the major league 
lead in errors by a left fielder, with 7.[15] On January 27, 2012 he signed 
a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.[16] The Phillies 
purchased his contract on March 29, and he was subsequently added to their 
Opening Day roster. He hit a three run home run on June 23. On June 28 
he got his 500th career RBI. In 130 games, 98 starting in left field, Pierre 
hit .307/.351/.371 with 6 triples and 37 stolen bases. On November 17, 
2012, Pierre signed a one-year, $1.6 million deal with the Miami Marlins.[17] 
He played the 2013 season with Miami and became a free agent at the end 
of the season. He had hoped to sign with another team and was often mentioned 
in press reports about teams requiring depth in the outfield to cover for 
injured or under performing players.[18] However, he went unsigned for 
the entire season and announced his retirement from professional baseball
