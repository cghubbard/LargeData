The Arizona Diamondbacks (often shortened as the D-Backs), an American 
professional baseball team based in Phoenix, Arizona, were formed in 1998, 
based at Bank One Ballpark. This followed five years of preparation under 
the leadership of Jerry Colangelo. The Diamondbacks won the World Series 
championship in 2001, becoming the fastest expansion team in the Major 
Leagues to win a championship, doing so in only the fourth season since 
inception in 1998. Financial difficulties were then encountered and the 
home field was renamed to Chase Field in 2005, as a result of Bank One 
Corporation's merger with JPMorgan Chase & Co. After a lean period the 
team won the National League West division in 2011. Between 1940 and 1990, 
Phoenix jumped from the 99th largest city in the nation to the 9th largest 
(it is currently the 6th largest). As such, it was frequently mentioned 
as a possible location for either a new or relocated MLB franchise. Baseball 
had a rich tradition in Arizona long before talk of bringing a big-league 
team even started. The state has been a frequent spring training site since 
1946. With a large number of people relocating to the state from the Midwest 
and the Northeast, as well as from California, many teams (most notably 
the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers) have normally had large followings 
in Arizona. The first serious attempt to land an expansion team for the 
Phoenix area was mounted by Elyse Doherty and Martin Stone, owner of the 
Phoenix Firebirds, the city's triple-A minor league baseball team and the 
top affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. In the late 1980s Stone approached 
St. Louis (football) Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill about sharing a proposed 
70,000 seat domed stadium in Phoenix. It was taken for granted that a domed 
stadium was a must for a major-league team to be a viable venture in the 
Phoenix area. Phoenix is by far the hottest major city in North America; 
the average high temperature during baseball's regular season is 99.1 °F 
(37.3 °C), and game-time temperatures well above 100 °F (38 °C) are very 
common during the summer. Bidwill, with plans already in the works to leave 
St. Louis, opted instead to sign a long term lease with Arizona State University 
to use its Sun Devil Stadium as the home of his soon-to-be Arizona-based 
NFL franchise. Since baseball-only stadiums were not seen as fiscally viable 
during that era, this effectively ended Stone's bid. In the fall of 1993, 
Jerry Colangelo, majority owner of the Phoenix Suns, the area's NBA franchise, 
announced he was assembling an ownership group, "Arizona Baseball, Inc.", 
to apply for a Major League Baseball expansion team. This was after a great 
deal of lobbying by the Maricopa County Sports Authority, a local group 
formed to preserve Cactus League spring training in Arizona and eventually 
secure a Major League franchise for the state. Colangelo's group was so 
certain that they would be awarded a franchise that they held a name-the-team 
contest for it; they took out a full-page ad in the sports section of the 
February 13, 1995 edition of the state's leading newspaper, the Arizona 
Republic. First prize was a pair of lifetime season tickets awarded to 
the person who submitted the winning entry. The winning choice was "Diamondbacks", 
after the Western diamondback, a rattlesnake native to the region known 
for injecting a large amount of venom when it strikes. Colangelo's bid 
received strong support from one of his friends, Chicago White Sox and 
Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and media reports say that then-acting 
Commissioner of Baseball and Milwaukee Brewers founder Bud Selig was also 
a strong supporter of Colangelo's bid.[1] Plans were also made for a new 
retractable-roof ballpark, Bank One Ballpark, nicknamed the BOB, (renamed 
in 2005 to Chase Field) to be built in an industrial/warehouse district 
on the southeast edge of downtown Phoenix, one block from the Suns' America 
West Arena (now US Airways Center). On March 9, 1995, Colangelo's group 
was awarded a franchise to begin play for the 1998 season. A $130 million 
franchise fee was paid to Major League Baseball. The Tampa Bay Area was 
also granted a franchise, the Devil Rays (to be based in St. Petersburg), 
at the same time. Arizona had originally been intended to join Tampa Bay 
in the American League. However, five American League teams had threatened 
to block the league assignments because of concerns that they would have 
additional games out of their time zone, causing early starts that would 
decrease revenue and TV ratings. Thus, on January 16, 1997, the Diamondbacks 
were officially voted into the National League while their expansion counterparts 
in Tampa Bay were voted into the American League.[2] MLB reserved the right 
to unilaterally move either the Diamondbacks or Devil Rays to another league 
within the first five years of existence. After the 2001 season, with the 
possibility of the Twins and Expos being eliminated, it was possible the 
Diamondbacks would move to the American League. However, MLB's franchise 
contraction plans never materialized.[3][4] According to the original press 
release from Colangelo's group (which remained posted on the team website 
during the first few seasons) the chosen team colors were Arizona turquoise, 
copper, black and purple. "... Turquoise was chosen because the greenish-blue 
stone is indigenous to Arizona, copper because Arizona is one the nation's 
top copper-producing states and purple because it has become a favorite 
color for Arizona sports fans, thanks to the success of the National Basketball 
Association's Phoenix Suns."[5] In the earliest days, the Diamondbacks 
operated basically as a subsidiary of the Suns; several executives and 
managers with the Suns and America West Arena were brought over to the 
Diamondbacks in similar roles.[6] From the beginning, Colangelo wanted 
to market the Diamondbacks to a statewide fan base and not limit fan appeal 
to Phoenix and its suburbs. Colangelo decided to call the team the "Arizona 
Diamondbacks" rather than the "Phoenix Diamondbacks". Although every Major 
League Baseball team does cultivate fans from outside its immediate metropolitan 
area, and even though the greater Phoenix area has 2/3 of the statewide 
population, there are long-standing historic rivalries between Phoenix 
and Arizona's other cities, such as Tucson, which at times diminish statewide 
appeal and enthusiasm for a Phoenix-based team. A series of team-sponsored 
fan motorcoach trips from Tucson to Bank One Ballpark were inaugurated 
for the opening season and are still in operation to this day (it is now 
known as the "Diamond Express"). The Diamondbacks are also known for the 
"Hometown Tour", held in January, where selected players, management and 
broadcasters make public appearances, hold autograph signings, etc., in 
various locations around Phoenix and Tucson, as well as many small and 
mid-sized towns in other areas of Arizona. Despite their early efforts 
to appeal to the entire state, in 2009 the Diamondbacks moved their Triple-A 
Pacific Coast League farm team, the Tucson Sidewinders, to Reno, where 
they are now known as the Aces. In 2011, they also moved their spring training 
base from Tucson to a new stadium near the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale. 
Two years before their first opening day, Colangelo hired Buck Showalter, 
the American League Manager of the Year in 1994 with the New York Yankees. 
Their lower level Minor League Baseball teams began play in 1996; the expansion 
draft was held in November 1997. The Diamondbacks' first major league game 
was played against the Colorado Rockies on March 31, 1998, at Bank One 
Ballpark before a standing-room only crowd of 50,179. Tickets had gone 
on sale on January 10 and sold out before lunch. The Rockies won, 9–2, 
with Andy Benes on the mound for the Diamondbacks, and Travis Lee being 
the first Diamondbacks player to get a hit (a single in his first MLB at 
bat), then became the first Diamondback to score, homer and drive in a 
run in his second MLB plate appearance. In their first five seasons of 
existence, the Diamondbacks won three division titles (1999, 2001, 2002) 
a National League pennant (2001) and a World Series championship (2001). 
In 1999, Arizona won 100 games in only its second season to win the NL 
West title. They lost to the New York Mets in four games in the NLDS. Colangelo 
fired Showalter after a relatively disappointing 2000 season, and replaced 
him with Bob Brenly, the former Giants catcher and coach, who had up to 
that point been working as a color analyst on Diamondbacks television broadcasts. 
In 2001, the team was led by two of the most dominant pitchers in all of 
baseball: Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling. Arizona had postseason victories 
over the St. Louis Cardinals (3–2 in the NLDS) and the Atlanta Braves (4–1 
in the NLCS) to advance to the World Series where, in the wake of the September 
11 terrorist attacks in New York City, they beat the three-time reigning 
champions, the New York Yankees, 4 to 3, to become the youngest expansion 
franchise to win the World Series (in just their fourth season of play). 
The previous mark was held by the Florida Marlins. This was the first time 
since 1991 that the home team won all seven games of a World Series, and 
the Diamondbacks were the first National League team to do so. An estimated 
orderly crowd of over 300,000 celebrated at the Diamondbacks victory parade, 
held at Bank One Ballpark and the surrounding downtown Phoenix streets 
on November 7, 2001. This was the first major professional sports championship 
for the state of Arizona and the first for a team (in the four major North 
American professional sports leagues) owned or controlled by Colangelo, 
whose basketball Phoenix Suns made it to the NBA Finals in 1976 and 1993 
but lost both times. The team finished the 2002 season with a 98-64 record 
and won the NL West Division Title, but were swept out in the NLDS by the 
St. Louis Cardinals. Randy Johnson was awarded with his fourth consecutive 
Cy Young Award as well the Major League Baseball Triple Crown. Arizona 
ended the 2003 season with an 84-78 record, in 3rd place in the NL West. 
Both Johnson and Schilling had suffered injuries during the season and 
Schilling was traded in the off season to the Boston Red Sox where he contributed 
to that team's 2004 World Series victory. By the 2004 season the Diamondbacks 
had dropped to a dismal 51–111 record, the worst in Major League Baseball 
and one of the 10 worst records in the modern era, despite Johnson pitching 
a perfect game on May 18 of that season. Brenly was fired partway through 
the season and was replaced on an interim basis by third base coach Al 
Pedrique. By this time Colangelo and the other partners were embroiled 
in a dispute over the financial health and direction of the Diamondbacks 
(and notably including over $150 million in deferred compensation to many 
players who were key members of the 2001 World Series winning team and 
others). Colangelo's willingness to go into debt and acquire players through 
free agency had led to one of the quickest free falls in major sports history. 
He was forced to resign his managing general partner post in the late summer 
of 2004. In a 2004 interview with columnist Hal Bodley of USA TODAY, Colangelo 
defended his actions: I understand where some people felt I wasn't doing 
it appropriately. The only analogy I can use is that Tampa Bay (the other 
'98 expansion team) went one direction and where did they end up? (Six 
last-place finishes and low attendance) ... We went another direction to 
establish a fan base because our investment was much larger than Tampa 
Bay's. And we put so much money into our own stadium ($130 million). After 
the first year and the decrease in season tickets, I was convinced we had 
to build a fan base ... We bought three division titles, a World Series 
and established a fan base ... ...I believe what we did will last a long, 
long time ... Right or wrong, a number of teams today are in the $50 million 
payroll range and competitive – Oakland, Minnesota, Texas are examples. 
Our goal was to get returns from our farm system. We built into our cash-flow 
that we would be paying out the deferments and that our payroll could drop 
to $50 million for a few years ... A few things hurt us ... The economy 
was bad, and I was hoping for more national money (from baseball's central 
fund) coming in.[7] Colangelo sold his interest in the General Partnership 
of the Diamondbacks to a group of investors who were all involved as partners 
in the founding of the team in 1995. The investors include equal partners 
Ken Kendrick, Mike Chipman, and Jeffrey Royer. Jeff Moorad, a former sports 
agent, joined the partnership, and was named the team's CEO; becoming its 
primary public face. Ken Kendrick became the managing general partner. 
Following the 2004 season, the Diamondbacks hired Wally Backman to be the 
team's manager. Backman was formerly manager of the Class A California 
League Lancaster JetHawks, one of the Diamondbacks' minor-league affiliates. 
In a turn of events that proved to be a minor embarrassment for the reorganized 
ownership group, Backman was almost immediately fired after management 
learned, after the fact, of legal troubles and improprieties in Backman's 
past. Former Seattle Mariners manager and Diamondbacks bench coach Bob 
Melvin became the new manager after only a ten-day tenure for Backman. 
Following the Backman incident, the Diamondbacks spent heavily on free 
agents in order to re-build. The club signed 3B Troy Glaus, P Russ Ortiz, 
SS Royce Clayton, and 2B Craig Counsell, among others. They then entered 
into a three-way deal with the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers: 
Randy Johnson was sent to the New York Yankees, for Javier Vázquez, Brad 
Halsey, and Dioner Navarro who was then dealt to the Dodgers for Shawn 
Green. Finally, they traded Casey Fossum to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for 
José Cruz, Jr. The Diamondbacks were considered by some to be the favorite 
to win the division after spending on the aforementioned free agents; however, 
injuries hurt the team's chances of reaching its expected potential. The 
Diamondbacks, led by Melvin, finished the 2005 season with a record of 
77 wins and 85 losses. Though a losing season, this was a 26-game improvement 
over 2004, and sufficient for second place in a woefully weak NL West, 
five games behind the San Diego Padres. In October 2005 the Diamondbacks 
hired 35-year-old Josh Byrnes, assistant general manager of the Boston 
Red Sox, to replace the outgoing Joe Garagiola, Jr. as Diamondbacks General 
Manager. Garagiola took a position in Major League Baseball's main offices 
in New York City. In a weak NL West division, the Diamondbacks failed to 
improve on their 2005 performance, finishing fourth with a slightly worse 
record than the year before. The season did include two excellent individual 
performances, however. 2B Orlando Hudson became the recipient of his second 
career Gold Glove Award, as announced on November 3 becoming only the sixth 
infielder in major league history to win a Gold Glove award in both the 
American and National Leagues. On November 14, it was announced that RHP 
Brandon Webb was the recipient of the Cy Young Award for the National League. 
Webb, a specialist in throwing the sinkerball, received 15 of 32 first-place 
votes in balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Webb 
went 16–8 with a 3.10 ERA and in the 2006 season was named to his first 
All-Star team. Several significant trades were made during the off season. 
The Diamondbacks and Brewers made a trade on November 25, 2006. Johnny 
Estrada, Greg Aquino, and Claudio Vargas were dealt to the Milwaukee Brewers 
for Doug Davis, Dana Eveland, and Dave Krynzel.[8] On Sunday January 7, 
it was announced that Randy Johnson would return to the Diamondbacks on 
a two-year contract, pending a physical. He was obtained from the Yankees 
in exchange for Luis Vizcaíno, Ross Ohlendorf, Alberto González and Steven 
Jackson, with the Yankees paying $2 million of Johnson's $26 million salary. 
The Diamondbacks and Florida Marlins made a deal March 26 to acquire RHP 
Yusmeiro Petit in exchange for Jorge Julio and cash. The Diamondbacks announced 
in early September 2006 that their uniforms, which remained largely unchanged 
since the team's first season, would be completely redesigned for the 2007 
season.[9] Details were supposed to be kept from the public until after 
the 2006 postseason as per MLB rules, but the Diamondback page from the 
2007 MLB Official Style Guide was somehow leaked around September 25, and 
local media broadcast printed the new design for all to see. Of great surprise 
to many fans was a brand new color scheme; apparently the original colors 
used by the franchise since Major League Baseball awarded it to Jerry Colangelo's 
ownership group in 1995 were to be discontinued. While some fans applauded 
the redesign, most of the reaction to the new color scheme, which included 
the changing of the historical purple and traditional Arizonan colors of 
copper and turquoise to a reddish color known as "Sedona Red" similar to 
those of the Coyotes and Cardinals color schemes, was pointedly negative.[10][11][12] 
The official unveiling of the uniforms came at a charity event on November 
8 in nearby Scottsdale, where several of the players modeled the uniforms 
on a runway, and posed for publicity photos. The distinctive "A" design 
remained unchanged save for the colors. The stylized snake-like "D" logo, 
also used since the early days for the road uniforms, was slightly redesigned 
and a completely new shoulder patch introduced. The lettering on the jerseys 
was completely redesigned. "Sedona Red" became the dominant color scheme 
used throughout Chase Field and in all marketing and promotional materials 
for the Diamondback ballclub. Not only did the Diamondbacks uniforms change, 
but many faces of the organization changed as well. Fan favorite and Diamondbacks 
stalwart Luis Gonzalez did not return as the left fielder for the Diamondbacks. 
The most popular player in franchise history, "Gonzo" signed a one-year 
contract worth just under $7 million on December 7 to play for the rival 
Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2007 season. Craig Counsell, Miguel Batista 
and Jay Bell, also signed with other teams, as did Thom Brennaman, the 
original Diamondbacks play-by-play man. In the 2007 regular season, the 
Diamondbacks enjoyed success with a young team including Brandon Webb, 
Conor Jackson, Stephen Drew, Carlos Quentin, Chad Tracy, Chris Young, Miguel 
Montero, Mark Reynolds (called up from Double-A in May) and Justin Upton 
(called up from Double-A in August). Despite being outscored over the season, 
the Diamondbacks posted the best record in the NL with 90 wins and 72 losses. 
Their unorthodox style led to the team adopting an unofficial motto coined 
by 1st baseman Tony Clark; "Anybody, Anytime." [13] On September 28, the 
Diamondbacks defeated the Colorado Rockies to secure a position in the 
2007 playoffs. After the Padres' defeat at the hands of the Milwaukee Brewers 
on September 29, the Diamondbacks secured both the NL West title and home 
field advantage throughout the NL playoffs. After taking the first two 
games at home against the Cubs, in the National League Division Series, 
they took the series to Wrigley Field, where they completed their sweep, 
earning their first berth in the National League Championship Series since 
2001. In the NLCS, they faced the Colorado Rockies again. The Rockies had 
been on an incredible winning pace since the All Star break, and they swept 
the Diamondbacks in four games. Overall, the 2007 season was a great success. 
On December 3, 2007 the Diamondbacks traded Carlos Quentin, who had failed 
to perform to expectation, to the Chicago White Sox for first base prospect 
Chris Carter. On December 14, in a blockbuster trade, the Diamondbacks 
acquired starting RHP Dan Haren from the Oakland Athletics for six players: 
LHP Brett Anderson, LHP Dana Eveland and LHP Greg Smith; the above-mentioned 
just-acquired infielder Chris Carter; and outfielders Aaron Cunningham 
and Carlos González. The team also traded relief pitcher José Valverde, 
who led the major leagues in saves in 2007 with 47, to the Houston Astros 
for reliever Chad Qualls, RHP Juan Gutiérrez and IF/OF Chris Burke. Haren 
was 15–9 with a 3.07 ERA for Oakland in 2007. On August 5, 2008 Dan Haren 
signed a four-year, $44.75 million deal with the Diamondbacks worth a guaranteed 
$41.25 million through 2012 and including a $15.5 million club option for 
2013 with a $3.5 million buyout.[14] After winning the opening game of 
the season on March 31 on the road against the Cincinnati Reds, the Diamondbacks 
found themselves with the best record in Major League Baseball, 20–8, by 
the start of May. At that time, they also led the NL West by 6.5 games. 
Despite the strong start, the team played poorly in May and June and entered 
the All Star break at 47–48, still leading the NL West. Orlando Hudson 
underwent season-ending surgery on his left wrist August 9 in the wake 
of a collision with catcher Brian McCann of the Atlanta Braves. Hudson 
was due to become a free agent at the end of the season and would not be 
re-signed. LF Eric Byrnes was on the 60-day disabled list from late June, 
with a torn left hamstring, and was out for the remainder of the season. 
On August 11, 2008, Dallas Buck, RHP Micah Owings, and C Wilkin Castillo 
were traded to the Reds (in last place in the NL Central at the time) in 
exchange for OF Adam Dunn. Dunn, who was tied for the major league lead 
with 32 home runs, was expected to provide a significant boost to an offense 
that has struggled to score runs for most of the season. Dunn seemed quite 
positive about being traded to a ball club in first place in its division 
in August.[15] The move was seen by some fans[16] as a belated attempt 
by the D'Backs to counter the trade by their division rival, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, for Boston Red Sox power-hitting OF Manny Ramirez on July 31 and 
also to compensate for the injuries to Hudson and Byrnes, generally considered 
two of the more "power-hitting" Diamondbacks on a team which has relied 
heavily on pitching and defense in recent years. A free agent at the end 
of the season, on February 11, 2009, Dunn agreed to a two-year $20 million 
contract with the Washington Nationals. On August 31, the Diamondbacks 
acquired former World Series MVP David Eckstein to fill the hole at second 
base which was opened after Orlando Hudson was placed on the disabled list. 
Eckstein was traded from the Toronto Blue Jays for Minor League pitcher 
Chad Beck.[17] Despite the acquisitions, the team failed to improve and 
finished with a record of 82–80, in second place behind the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. On May 8, after going 12–17 in 29 games, the Diamondbacks released 
manager Bob Melvin and hired A. J. Hinch.[18] The season ended with the 
Diamondbacks in last place and a record of 70 wins and 92 losses. The Diamondbacks' 
tough year was blamed on a struggling offense, and an inadequate pitching 
staff which had a collective ERA of 4.18. The Diamondbacks ended the 2010 
season with a 65–97 record. This poor performance was blamed on an extremely 
weak bullpen, which finished with a collective 5.47 ERA, and a lack of 
offense which was punctuated by the team setting the single season strikeout 
record.[19] and ending the season with 1,529.[20] On July 1, general manager 
Josh Byrnes and manager A. J. Hinch were fired and replaced on an interim 
basis by Jerry Dipoto and Kirk Gibson respectively.[21] (Gibson was later 
named the manager on a permanent basis, but Dipoto was replaced by Kevin 
Towers) In a season projected by many to be a last place finish, the Arizona 
Diamondbacks bucked expectations maintaining playoff contention at the 
All Star break with a 49-43 record, only 3 games behind the 1st place San 
Francisco Giants. The Diamondbacks' success has been credited to the approach 
of manager Kirk Gibson as well as strong starting pitching behind Ian Kennedy, 
Daniel Hudson, Joe Saunders, and rookie Josh Collmenter as well as a much 
improved bullpen led by closer J. J. Putz. The franchise opened Salt River 
Fields at Talking Stick, their new Spring training home in Scottsdale to 
rave reviews. The D-backs share the complex with the Colorado Rockies. 
The Diamondbacks' ballpark, Chase Field played host to the 2011 All-Star 
game on July 12. This was highlighted by the first use of the designated 
hitter rule in a National League ballpark. Toward the end of the trade 
deadline on July 31, 2011, the Diamondbacks acquired Washington Nationals 
right-handed pitcher Jason Marquis to strengthen their starting rotation, 
in exchange for Minor League shortstop Zach Walters.[22] The day after, 
in a move to boost their bullpen strength, consistency and depth, the Diamondbacks 
acquired reliever Brad Ziegler from the Oakland Athletics in exchange for 
first baseman Brandon Allen and reliever Jordan Norberto. On August 23, 
the Diamondbacks traded struggling second baseman Kelly Johnson to the 
Toronto Blue Jays for second baseman Aaron Hill and shortstop John McDonald.[23] 
The Diamondbacks surged after the All Star Break, posting a 45-25 record. 
On September 23, the Diamondbacks defeated the San Francisco Giants 3-1 
to clinch the National League West division title. They ended the season 
with a 94-68 record, a 29-game reversal over the prior year's performance. 
The Arizona Diamondbacks faced the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2011 National 
League Division Series, but lost 3-2 in the decisive game 5 in 10 innings. 
The Diamondbacks 2012 season wasn't as good as the one previously. The 
team ended in third place behind the 1st place San Francisco Giants and 
the 2nd place Los Angeles Dodgers. They did however surpass the 4th place 
San Diego Padres and the last place Colorado Rockies. The team did not 
have as much from team stars such as Ian Kennedy, Chris Young, Justin Upton, 
Stephen Drew, successor Daniel Hudson. Hudson had season-ending Tommy John 
surgery, and Drew was traded to the Oakland As for a couple of minor leaguers. 
On October 21, the D-backs traded Star Chris Young to the As for a shortstop 
and used his salary and a minor league reliever to acquire closer Heath 
Bell from the Miami Marlins. The season did introduce new stars such as 
Wade Miley and Chris Johnson. Wade Miley was a rookie who led the team 
in wins and strike outs. He also broke the franchise record for most wins 
by a rookie. Chris Johnson was acquired in a trade with the Houston Astros. 
He hit 5 home runs including a grand slam in his first 10 games. Also, 
at the trade deadline, the D-backs tried to complete a "monster" trade 
with the Chicago Cubs that would include at the time, the league leader 
in E.R.A, Ryan Dempster. They didn't get the trade in time and lost Dempster 
to the Texas Rangers. Aaron Hill Aaron Hill was a lesser known second baseman 
that the D-backs received from the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Kelly 
Johnson a few years before. In July 2012, Aaron Hill made history by becoming 
the first player to hit two cycles in one year during the modern era. He 
was the fourth to do so all time, joining the ranks of John Reilly, Babe 
Herman, and Tip O'Neill . He was also the fastest to do so, accomplishing
