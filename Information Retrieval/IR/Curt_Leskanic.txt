Curtis John Leskanic (/lɛsˈkænᵻk/; born April 2, 1968) is an American former 
Major League Baseball relief pitcher. During a 12-year baseball career, 
he pitched from 1993–2004 for the Colorado Rockies, Milwaukee Brewers, 
Kansas City Royals and Boston Red Sox. He is currently a professional scout 
for the Red Sox. Leskanic was drafted in the eighth round of the 1989 baseball 
amateur entry draft by the Cleveland Indians, but was traded in 1992 to 
the Minnesota Twins with Oscar Munoz for Paul Sorrento. Later that same 
year, he was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 1992 Expansion Draft. 
In 1993, he made his major league debut with the Rockies. In 2004, during 
the Kansas City Royals disastrous 58–104 season he was released on June 
18. On June 22, he was picked up by the Boston Red Sox and then made three 
appearances during the 2004 ALCS against the New York Yankees and was credited 
with the Game 4 win. His one and a third innings of shutout baseball during 
Game 4 were the last he would ever throw; he retired following the 2004 
season. He did make a return to Fenway Park for Opening Day 2005; there 
he received his World Series ring, as well as a large ovation. For Opening 
Day 2008, he got to carry out the World Series trophy.[1] There is some 
uncertainty as to Leskanic's actual age. He graduated from Steel Valley 
High School in Munhall, PA in 1985 and enrolled at Allegheny County Community 
College during the fall of that year. In 1986 he transferred to LSU, and 
was drafted after his junior year. Leskanic may have omitted his time at 
ACCC on his professional resume. Many believe his actual birth date to 
be in either late 1966 or early 1967 making him older than actually reported; 
a common practice for right handed pitchers in Major League Baseball. Leskanic 
was a little league coach in Florida and a scouting consultant for Boston 
before joining the Red Sox professional scouting staff for the 2008 season. 
Leskanic has a son, Brandon, and two daughters, Chloe and Chandler.[2] 
His cousin Katrina Leskanich is the lead singer of the music group Katrina 
and the Waves, best known for the hit single "Walking on Sunshine."[3] 
In September 2011, Leskanic was arrested and charged with driving under
