Aníbal Alejandro Sánchez, Jr. (Spanish: [aˈniβal ˈsantʃes]; born February 
27, 1984) is a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher for the Detroit 
Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Sánchez is listed as 6 feet tall 
and 180 pounds. Sánchez has previously pitched for the Miami Marlins. On 
September 6, 2006, in his 13th career Major League start, Sánchez pitched 
a no-hitter against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Sánchez was signed by the 
Boston Red Sox as an international free agent in 2001. After playing in 
the Venezuelan Summer League for two seasons, Sánchez suffered an elbow 
injury that required surgery to move his elbow ligament, causing him to 
miss the entire 2003 season. In the following year, he returned to the 
mound, this time making his debut on American soil with the short-season 
Single-A Lowell Spinners. In 15 starts, Sánchez posted a 3–4 record with 
a 1.77 earned run average (ERA), and by the end of the year was widely 
considered one of Boston's top pitching prospects. After the 2004 season, 
Baseball America named Sánchez Boston's fifth-best prospect, behind shortstop 
Hanley Ramírez, outfielder Brandon Moss, and pitchers Jonathan Papelbon 
and Jon Lester.[1] By 2006, Ramírez, Papelbon, and Lester had all played 
in the majors; Moss was selected as the Portland Sea Dogs most valuable 
player in 2006.[2] 2005 saw the young prospect starting the season off 
in Wilmington, Boston's High-A ball affiliate. After posting a 6–1 record 
with a 2.40 ERA, receiving a selection for the All-Star Futures Game, and 
making the Carolina League All-Star team, he was promoted to the Double-A 
Portland Sea Dogs. Sánchez got off to a hot start there, but tired toward 
the end of the season, creating some concern about his durability. Still, 
Sánchez put up a 3.45 ERA over 11 starts in his first year in Double-A; 
at 21 years old, he was still one of the youngest players in his league. 
At the end of the season, Boston traded Sánchez along with Hanley Ramírez, 
Jesús Delgado, and Harvey García to the Florida Marlins, in the same transaction 
that brought Josh Beckett, Guillermo Mota, and Mike Lowell to the Red Sox. 
In addition to Beckett and Lowell, the Marlins traded several of their 
other star players after the 2005 season, including Carlos Delgado, Juan 
Pierre, Paul Lo Duca, and Luis Castillo, for mainly minor-league prospects. 
Baseball America ranked Sánchez third in the Marlins system (after Jeremy 
Hermida and Ramirez) and 40th overall in the major leagues at the start 
of the 2006 season.[3][4] The Marlins started six rookies in their Opening 
Day lineup in 2006,[5] but elected to have Sánchez return to Class AA to 
start the season with the Carolina Mudcats. Sánchez made his first 15 starts 
in 2006 with Mudcats, for whom he posted a 3–6 record with a 3.15 ERA. 
While with Carolina, he pitched two complete games, one of which was a 
seven-hit shutout.[6][7] On June 25, he was called up to the majors to 
start the second half of a doubleheader in Yankee Stadium against the Yankees. 
Sánchez's major league debut was a strong one, as he allowed seven hits 
and no runs in 5 2⁄3 innings against the Yankees. He then turned the game 
over to his bullpen, which blanked the Yankees the rest of the way, shutting 
out the Yankees for the first time all year, 5–0. Sánchez became just the 
second visiting starter in the past decade to win his big-league debut 
at Yankee Stadium (fellow Venezuelan Gustavo Chacín of the Toronto Blue 
Jays, who beat the Yankees in September 2004, is the other). On July 14, 
the 22-year-old Sánchez started against and defeated Houston Astros pitcher 
Roger Clemens, who made his MLB debut when Sánchez was just three months 
old. On September 6, 2006, Sánchez threw a no-hitter for the Florida Marlins. 
In a 2–0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks, Sánchez went nine innings at 
home to record the feat. He walked four batters and struck out six, throwing 
103 pitches. The Marlins, who used 21 rookies during the 2006 season, started 
six in Sánchez's no-hitter, setting the record for most rookies to play 
for the winning team in a no-hitter.[8] Sánchez's no-hitter against Arizona 
ended the longest no-hitter drought in Major League Baseball history; there 
had been 6,364 consecutive major-league games without a no-hitter since 
Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004. The previous record was a 
4,015-game streak without a no-hitter, which lasted from September 30, 
1984, to September 19, 1986. On the same night that Sánchez recorded a 
no-hitter, Johnson nearly pitched another one, taking a no-hitter into 
the seventh inning for the New York Yankees against the Kansas City Royals.[9] 
Sánchez became the 19th rookie pitcher since 1900 to pitch a no-hitter, 
and the first since Bud Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals no-hit the San 
Diego Padres on September 3, 2001.[9] His no-hitter was also the fourth 
no-hitter in Marlins history, after Al Leiter, Kevin Brown, and A. J. Burnett. 
Sánchez became the second Venezuelan pitcher to pitch a no-hitter in the 
major leagues, joining Wilson Álvarez, who pitched a no-hitter with the 
Chicago White Sox against the Baltimore Orioles on August 11, 1991.[8] 
On September 27, Sánchez earned his tenth win against the Cincinnati Reds, 
joining teammates Josh Johnson, Scott Olsen, and Ricky Nolasco in the first 
set of four rookie teammates in MLB history to record ten or more wins 
in their rookie seasons. Marlins left-hander Dontrelle Willis had a record 
of 12–12, so with Sánchez's tenth win, the Marlins had their first set 
of five pitchers with ten or more wins in franchise history.[9] He finished 
his first season with the Marlins with a record of 10–3 and an ERA of 2.83 
in 18 major-league games (17 starts). Before their game against the Philadelphia 
Phillies on September 30, the Marlins presented Sánchez with the pitching 
rubber and home plate used in his no-hitter. The Miami-Dade County Office 
of the Mayor and Board of County Commissioners officially named September 
30, 2006, Aníbal Sánchez Day.[10] Sánchez suffered shoulder problems during 
spring training[11] but still started 2007 with the Marlins, going 2–1 
with a 4.80 ERA in six starts. When reliever Jorge Julio returned to the 
team from the disabled list on May 4, the Marlins demoted Sánchez to Class 
AAA Albuquerque, citing his struggles with control.[12] On June 21, it 
was reported that his season was over after having Dr. James Andrews perform 
surgery to repair a tear in his labrum.[13] On July 31, 2008, Sánchez pitched 
his first Major League game in almost 15 months against the Colorado Rockies. 
He had a solid outing and pitched 5⅔ innings while giving up two runs on 
six hits and striking out four. The Marlins went on to win that game 12–2, 
with Sánchez collecting his first win of the season.[14] Another shortened 
season limited Sánchez to 16 starts in 2009, but he saw improvements in 
his stats, finishing with a 3.87 ERA and his lowest WHIP and opponent's 
batting average since his rookie year. 2010 saw Sánchez finally get through 
a whole season, as he was the only Marlins' starter to stay in the starting 
rotation for the entire season. He set a career high in wins with 13, with 
a still-declining ERA of 3.55 and 195 innings pitched. On April 22, he 
took another no-hitter into the ninth inning against the Colorado Rockies 
before giving up a hit to Dexter Fowler. Sánchez finished the game for 
his fourth career complete game. Three starts later, Sánchez again took 
a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the Washington Nationals before 
losing it. Sánchez would also throw another complete game on May 26 against 
the San Francisco Giants, a 1–0 win that gave Sánchez his third career 
shutout. Sánchez would throw a one-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
his fourth career shutout and second of the season, in early September. 
After starting the season 6–2, a lack of run support and injuries from 
the rest of the team led resulted in a 2–7 finish to the season.[15] Anibal 
made 19 starts for the Miami Marlins in 2012, compiling a 5–7 record with 
a 3.94 ERA. On July 23, 2012, Sánchez was traded to the Detroit Tigers 
along with Omar Infante for Jacob Turner, Rob Brantly, Brian Flynn and 
a draft pick.[16] In 12 starts for the Tigers, he went 4–6 with a 3.74 
ERA. The Tigers won the AL Central division, giving Sánchez a chance to 
play in the first postseason of his career. In the 2012 ALDS against the 
Oakland Athletics, Sánchez started and lost Game 3 despite giving up two 
runs in 6 1⁄3 innings, as the Tigers offense did not score in the game. 
In Game 2 of the 2012 ALCS, Sánchez shut out the New York Yankees on three 
hits over seven innings, and earned the win in a 3–0 game. In Game 3 of 
the 2012 World Series, Sánchez struck out eight over seven innings, but 
took the loss in the Tigers 2–0 defeat to the San Francisco Giants. Overall, 
he went 1–2 in the 2012 postseason with a 1.77 ERA. On December 14, 2012, 
Sánchez agreed to a five-year, $80 million contract to remain with the 
Tigers.[17] The deal includes $75 million in salary for five years, plus 
a team option in the sixth year for an additional $16 million, making the 
total value of the contract worth a potential $91 million. If the Tigers 
do not exercise the option, they will owe Sánchez a $5 million buyout fee.[18] 
Sánchez made his 2013 regular season debut on April 3, as the starting 
pitcher in the Tigers' second game of the season.[19] On April 26, during 
a 10–0 victory at Comerica Park against the Atlanta Braves, Sánchez set 
a Detroit Tigers franchise record with 17 strikeouts, breaking the previous 
team record of 16 set in 1972 by Mickey Lolich. Amazingly, Sánchez set 
the record in only 8 innings pitched, as he was removed from the game prior 
to the ninth inning after throwing 121 pitches.[20] On May 24, Sánchez 
made a bid for his second career no-hitter. He did not allow a hit for 
8⅓ innings against the Minnesota Twins, before finally surrendering a single 
to Joe Mauer. He finished the game to earn a shutout in the Tigers 6–0 
win.[21] On September 11, Sánchez won his 14th game of the 2013 campaign 
in a 1–0 defeat of the Chicago White Sox to establish a new career high 
for wins in a season.[22] He finished the regular season with a 14–8 record, 
while fanning 202 batters in 182 innings pitched. His 2.57 ERA led all 
American League starters. He also allowed the fewest home runs per nine 
innings in the AL (0.4). In Game 1 of the American League Championship 
Series on October 12, Sánchez struck out four Boston Red Sox batters in 
the first inning, due to a wild pitch on one of the strikeouts. He became 
just the second player in Major League history to accomplish this feat 
in the postseason, following Orval Overall in the 1908 World Series.[23] 
Sánchez went on to pitch six no-hit innings with 12 strikeouts and six 
walks. He was lifted prior to the seventh inning due to throwing 116 pitches, 
but earned the win in a 1–0 Tigers victory. He was not as sharp in Game 
5 of the series, surrendering nine hits and four runs (three earned) in 
six innings, as the Tigers lost 4–3.[24] Sánchez entered 2014 as the Tigers' 
#3 starter. On April 26, he was placed on the disabled list due to a laceration 
on his right middle finger.[25] He returned successfully to the rotation 
with a win over the Boston Red Sox on May 18.[26] On June 30, Sánchez struck 
out Alberto Callaspo of the Oakland Athletics for his 1,000th career strikeout.[27][28] 
Sánchez left an August 8 game against the Toronto Blue Jays with discomfort 
in his side. The injury was later diagnosed as a strained pectoral muscle, 
sending Sánchez to the disabled list for the second time this season.[29] 
Sánchez began 2015 as the Tigers' #2 starter, due to the offseason loss 
of Max Scherzer and an injury to Justin Verlander. He had a rough start 
to the 2015 season, surrendering 13 home runs through his first 12 starts 
(after giving up just four homers in 22 games during the 2014 season). 
He showed signs of turning the season around in June, allowing zero runs 
in back-to-back starts against the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds. In 
the latter game on June 15, Sánchez threw a two-hit shutout in a 6–0 Tigers 
win. It was the seventh shutout of his career, and his first complete game 
since May 24, 2013. Sánchez allowed no walks, struck out seven, and faced 
just one batter over the minimum.[30] On August 20, Sánchez was placed 
on the disabled list with inflammation in his right rotator cuff. He would 
not return for the remainder of 2015. Prior to being placed on the DL, 
he posted a 10–10 record, with a 4.99 ERA in 25 starts, with only one quality 
start over his last 10 starts. He surrendered a career-high 29 home runs, 
which also led the American League despite his shortened season.[31] After 
compiling a 3–6 record and a 6.67 ERA in his first 11 starts, Sánchez was 
demoted to the Tiger bullpen following a May 31 start against the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim.[32] Sanchez returned to the starting rotation on July 
5 in Cleveland against the Cleveland Indians throwing 4.1 innings and earning 
the loss. Sánchez throws five pitches, giving him a variety of weapons 
to use against right-handed and left-handed hitters. He throws a four-seam 
fastball in the 92–96 MPH range, a two-seam sinker with similar velocity, 
a slider in the mid-80s, a changeup with strong tailing action in the 84–88 
MPH range, and an occasional curveball in the mid- to upper-70s[33] Teammates 
Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander have both claimed in interviews that 
Sánchez actually throws two different changeups: the standard one in the 
84–88 mph range, and a slower one in the low to mid-70s that they call 
the "butterfly pitch". Anibal is known for keeping hitters off-balance 
with his willingness to throw any pitch at any time in the count. Baseball 
writer Mike Axisa stated in 2013, "Rotation mates Max Scherzer and Justin
