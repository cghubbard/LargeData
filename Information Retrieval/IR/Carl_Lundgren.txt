Carl Leonard "Lundy" Lundgren (February 16, 1880 – August 21, 1934) was 
an American baseball and football player and coach. Lundgren played football 
and baseball for the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign and played 
eight seasons of Major League Baseball as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. 
In eight years with the Cubs, he compiled a record of 91 wins and 55 losses. 
His best season was 1907 when he won 18 games, pitched 207 innings without 
allowing a home run, threw seven shutouts, and gave up only 27 earned runs 
in 28 games. His 1.17 earned run average was the second lowest in the Major 
Leagues, and his average of 5.652 hits allowed per nine innings was the 
lowest in the Major Leagues. Control problems held him back from greater 
renown. The Atlanta Constitution in 1913 summarized Lundgren's strengths 
and weaknesses: "He had everything including speed to burn green hickory 
and an assortment of curves that would keep a criptograph specialist figuring 
all night but he was wild as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate 
the plate with a field glass."[1] After retiring as a player, Lundgren 
became a coach. He was the head baseball coach and assistant football coach 
at the University of Michigan from 1914 to 1921. He was the head baseball 
coach and assistant athletic director at the University of Illinois from 
1921 until his death in 1934. Lundgren's baseball teams at Michigan and 
Illinois won eight Big Ten Conference baseball championships, a total exceeded 
by only three other coaches in Big Ten history. Lundgren was born in Marengo, 
Illinois in 1880. His father, Pehr Hjalmar Lundgren, was born in Östergötland, 
Sweden, emigrated to the United States in 1868 and worked as a house painter, 
contractor and interior decorator.[2] His mother, Delilah (Renwick) Lundgren, 
was born on a farm outside Marengo.[2][3] His father purchased a farm north 
of Marengo, where the family lived until 1900.[2] Lundgren graduated from 
Marengo High School in 1898.[4] He was the oldest of four children, having 
a younger brother, Franz Emil, and two younger sisters, Eva and Alma.[2] 
Lundgren enrolled at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign in 1898, 
studied civil engineering, and graduated in 1902.[2][5] As a senior, he 
published a paper titled, "Comparative strength of gravel and broken-stone 
concretes".[6] While at Illinois, he played at the halfback and fullback 
positions for the Illini football team for three years. He was also a pitcher 
for the Illini baseball team from 1899 to 1902 and was the team captain 
in 1902.[3][7] The Chicago Cubs saw Lundgren pitch in an exhibition game 
between the Illinois college team and the Cubs. The Cubs gave Lundgren 
a tryout, and he made his Major League debut for the Cubs on June 19, 1902, 
shortly after completing his studies at the University of Illinois. One 
sports writer noted that "the Cubs had a new pitcher, and the world lost 
a civil engineer."[7] In his rookie season, Lundgren pitched 17 complete 
games (in 18 appearances) and had an earned run average of 1.97.[8] Lundgren 
pitched for the Cubs from 1902 to 1909 and compiled a 91–55 (.623) record 
and career earned run average of 2.42. During his best years, from 1904 
to 1907, he compiled a record of 65–27. The Cubs won three straight pennants 
in 1906, 1907, and 1908 and World Series championships in 1907 and 1908. 
During the 1906 and 1907 seasons, Lundgren compiled records of 17–6 and 
18–7.[8] In 1907, Lundgren pitched 207 innings without allowing a home 
run, threw seven shutouts, and gave up only 27 earned runs in 28 games.[8] 
His 1.17 earned run average was the second lowest in the Major Leagues 
(trailing teammate Jack Pfiester who had a 1.15 ERA), and his average of 
5.652 hits allowed per nine innings was the lowest in the Major Leagues.[9][10] 
However, he did not pitch in any of the Cubs' World Series games. His earned 
run average jumped from 1.17 in 1907 to 4.22 in 1908. He appeared in only 
two games for the Cubs in 1909, pitching his last Major League game on 
April 23.[8] At the end of April 1909, the Cubs placed Lundgren on waivers 
for a price of $1.50.[11] Lundgren's biggest weakness as a pitcher was 
lack of control. Even in 1907, his best year, Lundgren averaged 4.0 walks 
per nine innings pitched. In 1909, he averaged 8.3 walks per nine innings 
before being released. A profile of Lundgren published in 1913 by The Atlanta 
Constitution discussed his strengths and weaknesses: "He had everything 
including speed to burn green hickory and an assortment of curves that 
would keep a criptograph specialist figuring all night but he was wild 
as a March hare in a cyclone and couldn't locate the plate with a field 
glass. ... He had a strange hold on the art of steering the ball away from 
the plate that would make Wild Willie Donovan and Cy Seymour look like 
a brace of pikers who had been touched for their meal tickets."[1] Lundgren 
was called "the best cold-weather pitcher in the profession" by the Reach 
Baseball Guide.[3] He developed a reputation for pitching well in the spring 
and fall, but not faring as well during the hot summer months.[12] While 
pitching for the Cubs, he worked in the off-season as a draftsman from 
1902 to 1904 and as a dairy farmer after 1904.[5] In the summer of 1909, 
Lundgren appealed from a decision by the Cubs management to deny him a 
share of the team's $10,000 World Series bonus for 1908. In June 1909, 
he won what was described as "a moral victory" when a non-binding decision 
was entered, declaring the exclusion of Lundgren to be unjust.[13] After 
his Major League Baseball career ended in April 1909, Lundgren played minor 
league baseball for several years. In the spring of 1909, several teams 
expressed interest in Lundgren. Bill Armour, manager of the Toledo, Ohio 
team, reportedly lost interest because of Lundgren's reputation as a cold-weather 
pitcher: "Armour, however, discovered that Lundgren is a good man in the 
spring and fall, but during the hot months, when his services would be 
most in demand, he is unable to stand the strain."[12] The Cubs sold Lundgren 
to Brooklyn, and Brooklyn farmed him out to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 
the Eastern League for the 1909 season.[12][14] However, he was suspended 
in June 1909 by Toronto manager Joe Kelley. A newspaper account on the 
suspension noted: "Lundgren is not in shape for a hard game, and the Toronto 
Club does not intend to pay him a big salary to get into shape when he's 
not half trying."[15] In August 1909, he was reported to be "pitching independent 
ball around Chicago."[16] During the 1910 season, he played for the Hartford 
Senators in the Connecticut State League compiling a record of 6–3. At 
the end of the 1910 season, The Hartford Courant wrote: "Lundgren was regarded 
as the ablest pitcher in this league last season and he outclassed the 
other boxmen."[17] Lungren also played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1910, 
compiling a 1–4 record.[18] In November 1910, he was sold to Topeka in 
the Western League.[17] In 1911, he played for the Troy Trojans in the 
New York State League, compiling a 13–12 record in 31 games. He ended his 
playing career in 1912 with the Hartford Senators, compiling record of 
6–3 in 16 games.[18] In what appears to have been Lundgren's last professional 
baseball game, he pitched a shutout against the Bridgeport Orators on September 
10, 1912.[19] There were newspaper reports in June 1913 indicating that 
Lundgren had a tryout with the Mobile team in the Southern League and that 
he had signed with the Atlanta Crackers or the Charleston Sea Gulls, but 
no record has been found of his playing for those teams.[1][20] In March 
1912, Lundgren was hired to assist Boileryard Clarke in coaching the pitchers 
at Princeton University in 1912.[21][22] After a short stint with Princeton, 
Lundgren returned to the field as a player with Hartford in June 1912.[23] 
In January 1913, the University of Iowa expressed interest in hiring Lundgren 
as its baseball coach, but it appears that the deal fell through after 
the Iowa Board of Athletics was asked to meet his salary demands.[24] In 
February 1913, he was also interviewed, but not hired, for the position 
of manager of a baseball team in Keokuk, Iowa.[25][26][27] In August 1913, 
he was hired by the University of Michigan to succeed Branch Rickey as 
the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines baseball team.[28][29] He was 
the baseball coach at Michigan from 1914 through 1920, compiling a record 
of 93–43–6.[30] Lundgren developed several Major League players at Michigan, 
including George Sisler, who became one of baseball's greatest players.[7][22] 
He was also an assistant football coach at Michigan under the legendary 
football coach, Fielding H. Yost. In his final three years at Michigan 
(1918–1920), Lundgren's baseball teams won consecutive Big Ten Conference 
championships with records of 9–1, 9–0 and 9–1 in conference play.[31] 
While coaching at Michigan, Lundgren worked in the off-season as a traveling 
salesman.[2] In June 1920, Lundgren left Michigan to become the baseball 
coach at his alma mater, the University of Illinois.[32][33] He was Illinois' 
baseball coach for 14 years until his death in 1934. His Illini teams won 
Big Ten championships in 5 of Lundgren's 14 years as coach and tied for 
another.[22] Lundgren also served as the assistant athletic director at 
Illinois under George Huff.[22] Lundgren's Michigan and Illinois baseball 
teams won eight Big Ten Conference baseball championships.[22][31] Only 
three coaches have won more Big Ten baseball championships—George Huff 
of Illinois, Dick Siebert of Minnesota, and John Anderson of Minnesota. 
Lundgren married S. Maude Cohoon in September 1904.[5] He died in August
