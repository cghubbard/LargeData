Burt Carlton Hooton (born February 7, 1950), nicknamed "Happy", is an American 
former right-handed starting pitcher and former coach in Major League Baseball. 
He won 151 games over a 15-year career, mostly with the Chicago Cubs and 
Los Angeles Dodgers. Hooton's career began auspiciously with a no-hitter 
in his fourth major league game for the Cubs, but he gained perhaps his 
widest recognition for his several playoff performances with the Dodgers. 
His only All-Star appearance was in 1981, when he also was named the NLCS 
Most Valuable Player on the way to helping the Dodgers to a World Series 
championship with four postseason wins in five appearances. He is currently 
the pitching coach of the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the Class-A affiliate of 
the San Diego Padres. Hooton attended Richard King High School in Corpus 
Christi, Texas, leading the Mustangs to a 4A State Championship in the 
school's second year of operation in 1967. Hooton graduated from King in 
1968. Hooton attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he had a 
College Hall of Fame career, was a three-time All-American from 1969–71 
and set several school and conference records. He also made the Southwest 
All-Conference team three times and was the team MVP in 1971. He posted 
a 35-3 record including two no-hitters within weeks of each other in 1971, 
one of which was a perfect game for 8 innings of a scheduled 7 inning game. 
He played in the NCAA Tournament all three years, making it to the College 
World Series in 1969 and 1970. In 1969, the Longhorns came in 4th and Hooten 
made the All-Tournament team, and in 1970, the Longhorns came in 3rd. The 
Longhorns won conference championships all three years he was on the team. 
Pitching for the Boulder Collegians in the summer of 1969, Burt started 
and won the 64th Midnight Sun Game, which was hosted by the Alaska Goldpanners 
of Fairbanks. He was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1981. 
In 1998 he was admitted to the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame and in 2008 
to the College Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2009, his number (#20) was retired 
by the Longhorns. Bold means active After college, Hooton was selected 
by the Cubs with the second pick of the 1971 amateur draft. He made his 
major league debut with the team on June 17 of that year, but appeared 
in only three games before the end of the season, striking out 15 batters 
in one of them. He was the third player to go straight to the Major Leagues 
after being drafted without spending a day in the minors. He began 1972 
in outstanding fashion, pitching a 4-0 no-hitter against the Philadelphia 
Phillies at Wrigley Field on April 16, the second day of the strike-delayed 
season. But he was unable to win consistently as the team's fortunes declined 
in the early 1970s, and he was traded to Los Angeles in May 1975 after 
compiling a 34-44 record with a steadily increasing earned run average. 
The Dodgers were headed in the opposite direction from the Cubs, and Hooton 
was 18-7 with a 2.82 ERA over the remainder of the year, winning his last 
12 decisions for a team record. After a disappointing 1976 season, he used 
his strong knuckle curve to become a valuable member of the pennant-winning 
teams of the next two years, leading the staff with 153 strikeouts in 1977 
and with 19 wins and a 2.71 ERA in 1978. He finished second to Gaylord 
Perry in the 1978 Cy Young Award voting. Hooton started Game 3 of the 1977 
NLCS against the Phillies, but was pulled after issuing three consecutive 
bases-loaded walks in the second inning; the Dodgers came back to win 6-5. 
In the World Series against the New York Yankees, he pitched a 6-1 victory 
in Game 2, allowing only five singles and retiring 14 of the last 15 hitters 
to tie the Series at one game each. But in Game 6, he left in the fourth 
inning with the Dodgers behind 4-3 after giving up a 2-run home run to 
Reggie Jackson – Jackson's first of three in the game, all on the first 
pitch. The Yankees won 8-4, taking the Series in six games. The 1978 playoffs 
were rematches; in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Phillies, Hooton left 
after allowing three runs in the fifth inning, although the Dodgers still 
led 7-4 and went on to win the game. In the Series rematch with the Yankees 
he won Game 2, leaving in the seventh inning with a 4-2 lead as Los Angeles 
held on for a 4-3 win to take a 2-0 Series edge. But Game 5 was another 
crushing defeat as Hooton was yanked after allowing four runs in the third 
inning for a 4-2 Yankee lead, with New York romping to a 12-2 blowout and 
their third straight win. The Yankees won again two days later for their 
second consecutive title. After solid but unspectacular years in 1979 and 
1980, Hooton enjoyed an 11-6 campaign in the strike-shortened 1981 season, 
posting a career-best 2.28 ERA and being named to his only All-Star team. 
He began the playoffs with a win against the Houston Astros in Game 3 of 
the Division Series, allowing only three hits, including an Art Howe solo 
homer, through seven innings. After the Dodgers won the series in five 
games, they went on to face the Montreal Expos in the NLCS; Hooton won 
Game 1, allowing only six hits before leaving in the eighth inning with 
a 2-0 lead. Returning in Game 4 with the Dodgers behind two games to one, 
he allowed only five hits and one unearned run before leaving in the eighth 
inning with a 3-1 lead; the Dodgers went on to a 7-1 win, and won Game 
5 to advance to the World Series, again meeting the Yankees. Hooton was 
named the NLCS MVP for his two wins and perfect 0.00 ERA. He started Game 
2 of the World Series, but took a tough loss after leaving the game in 
the seventh inning, behind 1-0 on an unearned run; the Yankees went on 
to win 3-0 behind the pitching of his former Dodger teammate Tommy John. 
But he came back with another strong outing in Game 6, leaving with an 
8-1 lead in the sixth inning as the Dodgers won 9-2, taking their first 
World Series title since 1965. Because of his unassuming nature, broadcaster 
Vin Scully said that to celebrate, Hooton would probably go out and "paint 
the town beige."[1] Hooton remained with the Dodgers for three more years, 
but with a combined record of just 16-21; he spent most of 1984 in the 
bullpen. Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda nicknamed him "Happy" because Hooton 
rarely smiled. Hooton played his last season in 1985 for the Texas Rangers 
after signing with them as a free agent, going 5-8. Hooton returned to 
the University of Texas to earn his degree in journalism and then began 
a career as a pitching coach. He first worked in the Dodgers organization 
in 1988 with the Class A Salem (Oregon) Dodgers. He moved up to the pitching 
coach of the Double-A San Antonio Missions from 1990–1994 and then in 1995–96 
with the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes. He returned to the University of Texas 
again, as the pitching coach from 1997–1999. In 2000 started the season 
as the pitching coach at Double-A Round Rock, a Houston Astros affiliate, 
before being named pitching coach of the major league club midway through 
the season where he stayed until mid-season 2004 when manager Jimy Williams 
was fired. Nonetheless, one of the pitchers he coached, fellow Longhorn 
Roger Clemens, won the Cy Young Award that season. In 2005 he returned 
to Round Rock as pitching coach until 2010, when the team moved to Oklahoma 
City, where he worked in the same position through the end of the 2012 
season. In 2013, he was hired as the pitching coach for the Fort Wayne
