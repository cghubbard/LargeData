WPIX The 1965 New York Yankees season was the 63rd season for the Yankees 
in New York and their 65th overall. The team finished with a record of 
77â€“85, finishing 25 games behind the Minnesota Twins. New York was managed 
by Johnny Keane. This season marked the beginning of a transition for the 
Yankees before a resurgence in the mid 1970s. This was the first season 
since 1925 that they failed to finish either above the .500 mark or in 
the first division.[1] They would bottom out in 1966, their first time 
doing so since 1912. Bobby Murcer made his major league debut on September

off Senators pitcher Jim Duckworth.[7] On October 3, Tony Kubek hit a home
