As player As manager Edward Mayo "Catfish"[1] Smith (January 17, 1915 – 
November 24, 1977) was an American baseball player, manager, and scout. 
He had a 38-year career in professional baseball from 1933 to 1971. He 
is also the namesake of the "Mayo Smith Society", the Detroit Tigers international 
fan club that awards the "King Tiger Award" each year. Smith served as 
the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies (1955–1958), Cincinnati Reds (1959), 
and Detroit Tigers (1967–1970), compiling a managerial record of 662–612 
(.520). He received The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award in 1968 
after the Tigers won the American League pennant by 12 games with a record 
of 103–59 (.636) and defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1968 World 
Series. ESPN has ranked Smith's decision to move Mickey Stanley to shortstop 
for the 1968 World Series as the third "gutsiest call" in sports history. 
Smith also played professional baseball for 18 seasons from 1933 to 1950, 
including one season of Major League Baseball with the Philadelphia Athletics 
in 1945. He spent his most productive years in the International League 
playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs (1937–1939) and Buffalo Bisons (1940–1944) 
and in the Pacific Coast League with the Portland Beavers (1946–1948). 
Smith also spent 13 years in the New York Yankees organization as a minor 
league manager from 1949 to 1954 and as a "super scout" and "trouble shooter" 
from 1959 to 1966. Smith was born in January 1915 at New London, Missouri, 
a small town located 10 miles south of Hannibal and 100 miles northwest 
of St. Louis.[2] He was the only child of George Frederick Smith and Eval 
Smith. His middle name, "Mayo", was reportedly bestowed by his grandmother, 
who had been a patient at the Mayo Clinic and "liked the name."[3] In 1920, 
the family lived in Saverton Township, Ralls County, Missouri, where George 
Frederick was a farmer.[4][5] In 1926, at age 11, Smith moved with his 
family to Lake Worth in Palm Beach County, Florida.[6][7] In Florida, Smith's 
father was employed as a butcher or "meat cutter" in a meat market, and 
his mother was employed as a sales lady in a "dry goods" store.[4][8] Smith 
attended Lake Worth High School where he was the captain of the football 
and basketball teams and the class president in his sophomore and senior 
years. He graduated from high school in 1932 and was selected as the "outstanding 
boy student" in Palm Beach County.[9] Because Smith's high school did not 
have a baseball team, he played as a third baseman for a semi-pro Elks 
team in the Palm Beach County League.[10] According to another source, 
Smith was a member of the Carl Vogel Post 47, Junior Legion All-Stars in 
1929.[1] In any event, Smith was forced to stop playing semi-pro baseball 
after school officials threatened to expel him if he continued.[10] Smith 
was also an outstanding golfer and billiards player, playing professional 
billiards at age 16. He played in several exhibitions against Ralph Greenleaf 
and William Hoppe, the billiards champions of the 1920s and 1930s.[11] 
During his youth, he reportedly picked up extra cash as a pool hustler.[12] 
While playing professional baseball in Buffalo in the 1940s, a local radio 
broadcaster challenged Smith to a game of billiards. On his first turn, 
Smith "broke up the rack and ran 28 points."[11] In 1933, at age 18, Smith 
signed with the Double-A Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League.[1][13] 
He was discovered by Toronto manager Dan Howley, who spent his winters 
in Palm Beach. Howley assigned Sam Rice, a veteran outfielder and future 
Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, to train Smith as an outfielder. Smith 
recalled, "After that, I was more an outfielder than third baseman."[14] 
Smith managed only three hits in 29 at bats for Toronto during the 1933 
season.[2] In 1934, Smith was assigned to the Class B Wilmington Pirates 
of the Piedmont League. He played the entire 1934 season for Wilmington, 
though he was called up by the Maple Leafs in September 1934.[2][15] In 
1935, Smith appeared briefly with the Maple Leafs, having two hits in 11 
at bats. He spent most of the 1935 season with Wilmington. He compiled 
a .315 batting average with 102 total bases in 254 at bats at Wilmington,[2] 
but his 1935 season was cut short by illness.[16] In February 1936, Smith 
reported to the Maple Leafs' training camp in Haines City, Florida, making 
his fourth attempt to win a full-time berth with the team.[16] He did not 
make the roster and was sent back to the Piedmont League for the 1936 season. 
The Wilmington Pirates had moved to Durham, North Carolina, and Smith thus 
spent the 1936 season with the Durham Bulls, batting .217 in 66 games.[2] 
In the spring of 1937, at age 22, Smith finally earned a full-time spot 
on the Maple Leafs' roster.[17] He became one of the team's starting outfielders 
and performed well until injuring his leg. At the end of the 1937 season, 
The Sporting News praised his performance: "The outfield, one of the best 
in the league last season, needs little improvement. Mayo Smith came along 
in great style and should be ready for a fine season in 1938. He was hitting 
the ball and making great defensive plays when, unfortunately, a leg injury 
took him out of the line-up for several weeks."[18] He continued as a starting 
outfielder for the Maple Leafs in 1938 and 1939. In 1939, he played on 
a Maple Leafs team that included future Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, 
Heinie Manush and Tony Lazzeri. Smith compiled a .286 batting average in 
1939, 45 points higher than Manush and 59 points higher than Lazzeri.[19] 
During the 1939 season, Smith also had 196 total bases in 148 games and 
a career-high 385 putouts and 13 assists.[2] In July 1939, The Sporting 
News described Smith as "the most improved player of the season" and reported 
that his "defensive work is nothing short of sensational."[20] In December 
1939, Smith was traded by the Maple Leafs to the Buffalo Bisons, the Detroit 
Tigers farm team in the International League, in exchange for outfielder 
Johnnie Tyler.[13][21] Buffalo manager Steve O'Neill later called the trade 
"the best deal I made in my three years in Buffalo and one of the best 
of my career."[11] Smith played five seasons, principally as a center fielder, 
with the Bisons from 1940 to 1944.[2] In 1998, 54 years after he concluded 
his playing career with the Bisons, Smith was posthumously inducted into 
the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame.[22] Promptly upon joining the Bisons, 
Smith impressed observers with his defensive play. In April 1940, during 
a Florida exhibition game against the Detroit Tigers, Smith made a catch 
that Buffalo sports writer Cy Kritzer later called the greatest catch he 
had ever seen, including "The Catch" made by Willie Mays in 1954. With 
the bases loaded in the ninth inning, Hank Greenberg hit the ball better 
than 475 feet into dead center. According to Kritzer, "Smith turned his 
back to home plate and dashed straight for the fence. No one gave him a 
chance to catch the ball. But in the last stride, he leaped and the ball 
stuck in the web."[11] Bucky Harris, who managed Smith in Buffalo, later 
said, "My idea of a perfect game would be to have the opposition hit 27 
balls into center field . . . with Mayo Smith out there."[23] In 1941, 
Smith hit a walk-off, three-run home run with two out in the bottom of 
the tenth inning. The Bisons' business manager John Stiglmeier leaped over 
the rail from his box and ran onto the field to slap Smith on the back 
when he completed his home-run trot. Smith noted that the slap "actually 
knocked the wind clean plumb out of me."[24] On March 25, 1942, 600 residents 
of Smith's home town of Lake Worth, Florida celebrated "Mayo Smith Day." 
The Bisons played a spring training game in Lake Worth that day. In a 2-1 
loss to the Columbus Red Birds, Smith drove in the Bisons' only run with 
a single in the eighth inning.[25] Smith went on to have one of his most 
successful seasons in 1942. He appeared in a career-high 154 games, hit 
11 home runs, and compiled a .279 batting average and a .386 on-base percentage. 
Playing principally in center field, he also had 384 putouts and 13 assists.[2] 
After playing in every game for the Bisons in 1942, Smith suffered an injury 
at the end of spring training in 1943.[26] Smith returned to the line-up 
and appeared in 136 games in the outfield.[2] However, he suffered sustained 
trouble with the arches in his feet throughout the 1943 season, leading 
some to speculate that he was "washed up."[27] Smith attributed the trouble 
to a job working 12 hours a day on cement floors in a war plant during 
the 1942–43 off-season. After the 1943 season, Smith tried to stay off 
his feet as much as possible and soaked his feet each night in solutions 
prepared by the Buffalo trainer.[28] His wife, Louise, told a reporter, 
"Mayo eats all his meals with his feet in a tub of water."[11] In 1944, 
Smith rebounded from his injuries and had his best season in professional 
baseball. In May and June 1944, he had separate streaks in which he reached 
base in 14 and 13 consecutive plate appearances. The latter streak included 
nine consecutive hits.[27] Smith also won praise in 1944 for his baseball 
intelligence and as a player who "never made a mistake or missed a signal."[28] 
In August 1944, Syracuse manager Jewel Ens said: "Smith is the miracle 
man of the 1944 season. . . . He's the best hit-and-run man in the league. 
He's a great hustler and a fine all-around player, and you can say one 
more thing, he's a credit to the game."[28] At the end of the 1944 season, 
Smith had compiled a career-high .340 batting average (.495 on-base percentage), 
won the International League batting title,[29] led the league with 149 
walks, and compiled 232 total bases, 42 extra base hits and 12 stolen bases 
in 150 games.[2][30] He was unanimously selected to the International League 
All-Star team and finished second behind Howard Moss in voting for the 
International League Most Valuable Player award.[31] On November 1, 1944, 
following his breakout season with the Bisons, Smith was selected by Connie 
Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics in the Rule 5 draft.[29] However, Smith's 
opportunity to play in the big leagues was delayed by illness.[32] In February 
1945, Smith contracted rheumatic fever and was taken to Buffalo General 
Hospital by ambulance. He was hospitalized for three weeks and lost 20 
pounds as the ailment settled into his arms and shoulders. In March 1945, 
The Sporting News reported that Smith would remain "flat on his back" for 
six more weeks and that he had given up hope of playing baseball in 1945. 
Smith said that he intended to return to his home in Florida as soon as 
he was well enough to walk.[33] Smith was advised by doctors to remain 
out of baseball in 1945,[34] but by the end of May 1945, he began working 
out with the Bisons.[35] He joined the Athletics in mid-June and made his 
Major League Baseball debut at age 30 on June 24, 1945. He appeared in 
73 games with the 1945 Philadelphia Athletics and became the team's starting 
left fielder for the last part of the season. The 1945 Athletics finished 
in last place in the American League and compiled a 52–98 (.347) record. 
Smith compiled a .212 batting average and a .333 on-base percentage.[36] 
In December 1945, the Athletics traded Smith and Steve Gerkin to the Triple 
A Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League in exchange for Wandel B. 
"Lefty" Mossor.[30][37][38] Smith played for the Beavers for three years 
from 1946 to 1948.[2] In 1946, Smith led the Beavers in putouts by an outfielder 
with 298 in 122 games. Although his batting average was .249, his propensity 
to draw walks boosted his on-base percentage to .341.[39] In 1947, Smith 
hit .311 and drew 79 walks for a .418 on-base percentage. He also had 30 
doubles and five home runs and again led the team in putouts by an outfielder 
with 272 in 128 games.[40] On August 5, 1947, Smith hit an inside-the-park 
home run in the 11th inning to give the Beavers a victory over the Oakland 
Oaks.[41] In May 1948, Smith was still living in the Portland area when 
his family was caught in the Vanport Flood. After a dike collapsed, Vanport 
City, Oregon was deluged. Smith lost his automobile and personal belongings 
as his home was covered under 15 to 18 feet of water. His wife and six-year-old 
daughter narrowly escaped from the floodwaters by climbing to the roofs 
of four different buildings before being rescued.[42] For six years from 
1949 to 1954, Smith served as a manager, and in some cases player-manager, 
in the farm system of the New York Yankees. He served as a player-manager 
of the Class C Amsterdam Rugmakers of the Canadian–American League from 
1949 to 1950.[2] In his first month with the Rugmakers, Smith hit six home 
runs, including three that sailed over the 310-foot right field fence at 
Amsterdam's Mohawk Mills Park during a double-header against Three Rivers.[43] 
He totalled a career-high 19 home runs in 1949,[36] also adding 116 RBIs 
in 119 games. His Amsterdam teams finished in fifth and fourth place in 
the Canadian–American League.[44] In December 1950, he was promoted to 
Class B as the manager of the Norfolk Tars of the Piedmont League.[45] 
Smith served as the Tars manager in 1951 and 1952 and led the team to Piedmont 
League pennants both years. His 1952 Norfolk team compiled a 96–36 (.727) 
record.[2][46] Noting that the 1952 team included Bill Skowron, Bill Virdon, 
Johnny Kucks and Gus Triandos, Smith later recalled: "Manage a team like 
that? Shucks, I could go fishing."[47] In December 1952, based on the strength 
of his performance in Norfolk, the Yankees promoted Smith to the Double-A 
Birmingham Barons of the Southern Association.[48] He was the Barons' manager 
from 1953 to 1954.[2] In October 1954, at age 39, Smith was named manager 
of the Philadelphia Phillies, replacing Terry Moore.[49][50] Phillies general 
manager Roy Hamey made the announcement and introduced Smith at a press 
conference in the Warwick Hotel. The Sporting News described the reaction 
to the Phillies' hiring of an unknown minor league manager: "[Hamey] grabbed 
a microphone which was convenient and said, 'This is Mayo Smith, the new 
manager of the Phillies.' ... For at least one minute there was an embarrassing 
silence. Still no one knew who he was. To say that the gathering was surprised 
was the greatest understatement of the year. Fifty men were speechless. 
They had more or less expected a new manager, a Lefty O'Doul, a Lou Boudreau 
or a Skeeter Newsome. But Mayo Smith ... who is he?"[51] Despite the "loud 
guffaws" among the Philadelphia press,[52] Yankees manager Casey Stengel 
endorsed the hiring of Smith, saying: "Mayo will make good. He is one of 
the coming young managers in baseball. I watched him closely in my advance 
camps, and he was the one manager in the Yankee chain who asked questions, 
who wanted to know why I liked things done this way and not that way. He 
never intimated that he knew all the answers. He kept notes, and he learned."[52] 
Red Smith described the relatively unknown Smith at the time: "He is tall 
and rangy, with graying brown hair and young, pleasant features smoothly 
tanned. There are crinkly lines of laughter around his blue eyes."[53] 
After winning the National League pennant in 1950 (the year of the "Whiz 
Kids"), the Phillies had dropped into the middle of the National League, 
compiling a losing record in 1954. Smith became the team's fourth manager 
in three years. In Smith's first year with the Phillies, the team started 
poorly, dropping to 11 games below .500. The team rallied in the second 
half of the season and finished in fourth place with a 77–77 record, including 
23 wins by pitcher Robin Roberts. At the end of the season, Smith received 
30 of 99 votes by the Baseball Writers' Association of America as the 1955 
National League Manager of the Year; he finished in second place behind 
Walter Alston.[54] The Phillies slipped to 71–83 in 1956 with Richie Ashburn 
being the only regular player to bat over .289.[55] After six consecutive 
20-win seasons, Robin Roberts led the National League with 19 losses in 
1956.[56] In September 1956, and despite the losing record, the Phillies 
showed their confidence in Smith by signing him to a one-year contract 
extension through the 1957 season.[57] In 1957, the Phillies returned to 
77–77 despite pitcher Robin Roberts having a losing record of 10–22. Pitcher 
Jack Sanford, named Rookie of the Year in 1957, saved the Phillies from 
falling below .500 with his record of 19–8. In 1958, the team slipped below 
.500 with a record of 39–45 in late July. On July 22, 1958, Smith was fired 
and replaced by Eddie Sawyer.[58][59] After Smith was fired, the 1958 Phillies 
dropped to last place under Sawyer. The Phillies finished in last place 
in the National League for four consecutive years from 1958 to 1961. In 
Smith's 3-1/2 years with the Phillies, he compiled a 264–281 record (.484).[2] 
In the three-and-a-half years after he was fired, the Phillies fell to 
200–332 (.376).[60] In August 1958, shortly after Smith was fired by the 
Phillies, unconfirmed reports were published indicating that a deal was 
in the works for the Cincinnati Reds to hire Smith as their manager. Jimmy 
Dykes had been named interim manager after Birdie Tebbetts resigned the 
post.[61] At the end of September, Smith signed a one-year contract to 
take over as manager for the 1959 season. Cincinnati general manager Gabe 
Paul announced: "We believe that in [43-year-old] Mayo Smith we have a 
young, progressive, middle-of-the-road manager who will help formulate 
the kind of baseball organization that will result in success for our club."[62] 
In The Cincinnati Post, Pat Harmon expressed skepticism: "[T]he naming 
of Smith caused no ripple of excitement in the city. Here is a man who 
had a fourth and two fifths and was dropped by the Phillies."[63] Smith 
took over a Reds team that finished the 1958 season in fourth place with 
a 76–78 record. The team featured future Hall of Famers Vada Pinson and 
Frank Robinson, but lacked a pitcher who would win more than 13 games in 
1959. After a good start, the Reds fell to seventh place with a 35–45 record 
at the All-Star break.[64] On July 8, 1959, Smith was fired and replaced 
by Fred Hutchinson, who became the Reds' fourth manager in less than a 
year.[65][66][67] Cincinnati sports writer Earl Lawson wrote that the change 
was driven by the belief that the team required tougher leadership. Lawson 
wrote: "Perhaps it's fitting to say that Smith is an example of Leo Durocher's 
oft-repeated statement, 'Nice guys finish last.' Ball players 'liked' Smith 
and were quick to admit this, but whether they respected his judgment is 
questionable. 'Chewing-out' players was foreign to his personality."[68] 
Smith felt he was never given a chance in Cincinnati and spoke out against 
demands for instant success. He said, "It was humiliating. I hardly had 
a chance to get acquainted with the players."[69] During the 1950s, Smith 
also had several business interests. In 1958, he developed a $600,000-plus, 
state-of-the-art "bowling palace" on the Dixie Highway in Palm Beach County, 
Florida. The facility was equipped with automatic pin-setters, air conditioning, 
a nursery for bowlers with young children, and pro shop. Smith secured 
investments from other Major League Baseball managers and players, including 
Fred Hutchinson and Hank Sauer, and the facility was called Major League 
Lanes.[70] By the end of 1959, Smith also had successful business interests 
in Florida real estate, West Virginia oil, and a bowling alley chain in 
the Carolinas.[71] In September 1959, Smith, at age 44, Smith returned 
to the New York Yankees as "a field executive with duties as a major and 
minor league scout."[71] Despite his business interests, Smith explained 
the attraction of returning to baseball: "It's simply that baseball gets 
in your blood and you can't get it out. Like being a compulsive gambler 
or something along those lines. You know when you become a manager, that 
you're going to be fired sooner or later, no matter how good a job you 
feel you are doing. From the moment you sign the contract you're as disposable 
as a wounded pirate. The only two guys who ever beat the rap were Connie 
Mack and Clark Griffith. That's because they owned the club."[72] At the 
end of the 1960 season, Casey Stengel retired as the Yankees' manager, 
and Smith was rumored to be a candidate to replace Stengel. Ralph Houk 
was chosen instead.[73][74] In 1961, Smith was described as "a combination 
master scout and trouble shooter" for the Yankees.[75] He remained a scout 
in the Yankees organization until 1966.[76] During his years as a scout 
for the Yankees, Smith "toured the press rooms and the better watering 
spots" across the major leagues, "avail[ed] himself of free food and drinks 
in press rooms,"[77] developed a reputation as "a warm friendly man", and 
was sometimes referred to as "America's Guest."[78] Prior to the 1964 World 
Series, Smith was assigned to scout the St. Louis Cardinals. He reported 
that Tim McCarver hit every ball to left field. Smith later recalled that, 
after Game 2 of the World Series, as McCarver pulled every ball to right 
field, Yogi Berra came to him and said, "You sure you were watching McCarver 
hit or were you somewhere else?"[79] During the 1966 season, the manager 
of the Detroit Tigers, Chuck Dressen, suffered a heart attack and eventually 
died in mid-August. After Dressen's heart attack, the Tigers named Bob 
Swift as manager. Swift was diagnosed with lung cancer and died two months 
after Dressen. As the team searched for a new manager, both Al López and 
Bill Rigney turned down the position. On October 3, 1966, the Tigers' general 
manager Jim Campbell signed Mayo Smith to a two-year contract at an annual 
salary of $40,000.[76][80] As had been the case in Philadelphia and St. 
Louis, the hiring of relatively unknown Smith was not met with enthusiasm 
in the Detroit press.[80] Joe Falls of the Detroit Free Press called him 
a "noboby" who fit Jim Campbell's image of the "elderly, experienced, devoted" 
manager.[81] Jerry Green of The Detroit News later wrote: "Sportswriters 
covering the team at the time regarded Smith as a bland man without imagination."[82] 
Within several days after being hired, Smith put together a new coaching 
staff, includingTony Cuccinello as third base coach, Johnny Sain as pitching 
coach, Hal Naragon as the bull-pen coach, and Wally Moses as first-base 
coach.[83] Smith took over a talented team that had not played up to expectations, 
finishing third, fourth or fifth for five consecutive years.[84] At his 
first press conference in Detroit, Smith identified pitching as the problem 
that most required attention and the outfield (featuring Al Kaline, Willie 
Horton, Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley, and Gates Brown) as the greatest 
strength.[80] His first major initiative was a realignment of the infield. 
He announced in the fall of 1966 that he intended to shore up the team 
defensively by moving Dick McAuliffe from shortstop to second base and 
having Ray Oyler take over as shortstop.[14][85] Smith's decision was met 
with "some public sneering."[86] Dick McAuliffe had been the Tigers starting 
shortstop since 1962 and had been selected as an All-Star in 1965 and 1966.[87] 
And while Oyler was considered an excellent defensive shortstop,[88] he 
had hit below .200 in both 1965 and 1966.[89] The 1967 Tigers got off to 
a quick start, compiling 26-14 record in the first 40 games.[90] Catcher 
Bill Freehan began the season with a hot bat, saw his batting average climb 
by 50 points in 1967 over 1966, increased his RBI total from 46 to 74, 
and finished third in the voting for the 1967 American League Most Valuable 
Player.[91] Freehan credited Smith and Wally Moses for improving his offensive 
performance.[92] The 1967 season proved to be a roller-coaster ride, as 
the team lost 10 of 12 games from June 7 to 19, won seven in a row from 
July 2 to 9, and then lost six in a row.[90] As the team endured successive 
hot and cold periods, Smith developed a reputation for "keeping his cool" 
and not "chewing out" his players. Smith resisted juggling his line-up, 
noting that he saw his role as building confidence and that he did not 
want to over-manage the team.[93] In September, the Tigers were caught 
in a four-way pennant race with the Red Sox, Twins, and White Sox. The 
Tigers won 17 of the last 27 games and finished the season with a 91–71 
(.562) record—one game behind the Red Sox, losing the pennant on the last 
day of the season.[90] The following year, the 1968 Detroit Tigers won 
the American League pennant by 12 games with a record of 103–59 (.636).[94] 
Smith was credited with mentoring pitcher Denny McLain during the 1968 
season. McLain, who became the first pitcher since 1934 to win 30 games, 
went 31-6 with a 1.96 ERA, won the Cy Young Award and the American League 
Most Valuable Player Award.[95] Asked about McLain's sometimes odd statements, 
Smith was protective, noting, "This is a 24-year-old boy reaching for Utopia. 
. . . You can't take the brashness away from him, and you wouldn't want 
to."[96] The 1968 season was not free from controversy. After being pulled 
from a game in August, pitcher Joe Sparma told a reporter that he felt 
"humiliated" and made "rather harsh comments" about Smith.[97] When asked 
Smith for a response, Smith said he "didn't want to get into a spitting 
contest with a skunk."[98] Smith refused to start Sparma for several weeks 
afterward. When Sparma finally got another start on September 17, 1968, 
he pitched a one-run complete game against the Yankees to clinch the pennant.[99] 
The Sparma-Smith feud continued, and Sparma pitched only 1/3 of an inning 
in the 1968 World Series.[100] Another August controversy arose after Dick 
McAuliffe charged the mound and knocked down Chicago White Sox pitcher 
Tommy John.[101] American League president Joe Cronin initially imposed 
a $250 fine on McAuliffe, but subsequently modified the sanction to include 
a five-day penalty. Smith was convinced that Cronin had been swayed by 
the White Sox, exchanged angry words with Cronin in a phone call, and publicly 
called Cronin "a weak man" who had been caught in "a big lie."[102] When 
the Tigers won the World Series, Cronin sought to patch up his relationship 
with Smith, but Smith declined, saying, "I don't get over things like this 
right away."[102] The biggest setback of the season was the loss of future 
Baseball Hall of Fame inductee and right fielder Al Kaline to an injury. 
Kaline broke his arm after being hit by a pitch in late May and missed 
nearly three months of the season. When he returned in August, Smith was 
faced with a problem in getting him back into the lineup. Left fielder 
Willie Horton finished the 1968 season second in the American League with 
36 home runs and a .543 slugging percentage. Center-fielder Mickey Stanley 
led all American League outfielders with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage 
and was on his way to a second consecutive Gold Glove Award. Jim Northrup, 
who had taken over Kaline's spot in right field, finished the 1968 season 
third in the league with 90 RBIs and hit five grand slams during the season. 
Smith played Kaline at first base for 22 games, but the team already had 
Norm Cash as its regular first baseman. Concerned about his team's offense 
as the team prepared for the World Series, Smith moved Stanley to shortstop 
for the last nine games of the regular season. Stanley replaced Ray Oyler, 
who was an excellent fielder but hit only .135 for the season.[103][104][105] 
The Tigers won the pennant and faced the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1968 
World Series. Behind the pitching of Bob Gibson, the Cardinals took a 3-to-1 
edge in the first four games. The Tigers won the final three games to capture 
the World Series.[106] Smith's strategic moves in the World Series drew 
praise even from those who had previously been critics.[102][105] Smith's 
most dramatic strategic call was his decision to continue playing center-fielder 
Mickey Stanley at shortstop, for all seven games of the World Series. Even 
Smith's closest friends questioned the move, and critics gravely opined 
that he was weakening the Tigers at two positions, given Stanley's Gold 
Glove season in center field.[102] While Stanley made two errors, neither 
led to a Cardinal run, and his play at shortstop was generally solid. More 
importantly, the move allowed Smith to keep both Jim Northrup and Al Kaline 
in the line-up, and each had key hits to fuel the Tigers' comeback against 
the Cardinals. Kaline had a .379 batting average in the World Series with 
two home runs, eight RBIs, and the game-winning hit in Game 5. Northrup 
also belted two home runs (including a grand slam in Game 6), hit a two-run 
triple in Game 7, and totalled eight RBIs.[106] The Boston Globe later 
called Smith's move of Stanley to shortstop for the World Series "the gutsiest 
move in history."[107] ESPN has ranked Smith's decision to move Stanley 
to shortstop as the third "gutsiest call" in sports history.[108] Smith 
also drew praise for his adjustments to the pitching rotation in the World 
Series. Watson Spoelstra wrote: "Mayo's managing against the Cardinals 
couldn't have been better."[109] With the Cardinals leading the series 
3–1, the Tigers trailed 3–2 in the seventh inning of Game 5. In the bottom 
of the seventh inning, Smith opted to allow starting pitcher Mickey Lolich 
to bat, despite the Tigers need to put a runner on base. Lolich got a base 
hit to start a two-run rally, scored the tying run, struck out Roger Maris 
and picked off Lou Brock in the ninth inning, and pitched his second complete-game 
victory of the series.[110] In Game 6, Smith surprised observers by calling 
on Denny McLain to start on two days rest, and despite poor performances 
in Games 1 and 4. The Tigers gave McLain a 12–0 lead with a 10-run third 
inning, and McLain pitched a complete game, allowing only one run.[111] 
In Game 7, Smith called on Lolich to pitch on two days rest. Matched against 
Bob Gibson, Lolich pitched his third complete game, allowing only one run, 
and led the team to a 4–1 victory.[112] At the end of the 1968 season, 
Smith received The Sporting News Manager of the Year Award, receiving 17 
of 19 votes.[78][102] The Sporting News noted that the key players on the 
1968 Tigers "had been around for several years, when the Tigers were going 
nowhere. The man whose arrival coincided with a Tiger awakening is Mayo 
Smith. . . . Mayo is making it tough for people who claim the manager isn't 
important."[96] Smith also received a two-year contract extension with 
a $15,000 raise to $55,000 a season.[109] Smith's fan mail was so voluminous 
after the Tigers won the World Series that it took five people two full 
days to put things in order.[113] In 1969, the Tigers compiled a 90–72 
(.556) record but finished in second place – 19 games behind the 1969 Baltimore 
Orioles. The team relied on power as four players (Cash, Kaline, Horton 
and Northrup) hit move than 20 home runs, but lacked speed and finished 
last in the American League with only 35 stolen bases. Denny McLain won 
24 games, and Mickey Lolich won 19 while striking out 271 batters.[114] 
With the second-place finish, Smith's teams had finished in first or second 
place for three consecutive years. No Detroit manager had accomplished 
that feat since Steve O'Neill from 1945 to 1947.[84] In 1970, the Tigers 
fell to 79–83 (.488) in a season marked by the suspension of Denny McLain 
for his association with bookmakers and the publication of Bill Freehan's 
behind-the-scenes book on the 1969 team.[115][116] The Tigers were in third 
place, seven games behind Baltimore, at the end of June,[117] but collapsed 
in the second half of the season, finishing 29 games behind the Orioles.[118] 
McLain won only three games in 1970, and Mickey Lolich led the American 
League with 19 losses and a 14–19 record. The team's power-hitting lineup 
also lost its punch, as no player hit more than 17 home runs.[118] The 
team also compiled the lowest batting average in the American League at 
.238.[119] As the 1970 Tigers headed for their first losing season since 
1963 and their worst record since 1960, Smith came under increasing criticism 
from fans and the press. Immediately after the season, on October 2, 1970, 
the Tigers fired Smith and replaced him with Billy Martin.[120] Before 
leaving Detroit, Smith called the city a great sports town in his farewell 
news conference, but he privately lashed out at the fans in a conversation 
with reporters: "They wouldn't know a baseball player from a Japanese aviator. 
The fans in Detroit are ignorant. They'd rather see you leave a tired pitcher 
in and get beat with a complete game than bring in a fresh one that might 
win it for you."[121] In all or parts of nine seasons as a manager, Smith 
compiled an overall record of 662–612 (.520). After spending most of the 
1971 season at his home in Florida, Smith was hired by Charley Finley as 
a special scout for the Oakland Athletics during the last month of the 
1971 season.[122] He was assigned to cover the Baltimore Orioles in preparation 
for the 1971 American League Championship Series.[123][124] On September 
2, 1971, The Baltimore Sun reported on Smith's espionage assignment: "Super 
Spy Sets Sights on Birds."[125] Despite Smith's scouting report, the Orioles 
swept the A's in three games as Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar and Jim Palmer 
held the A's to seven runs in three games.[126] In March 1940, Smith married 
Louise Pauline Otto in a ceremony held at the Our Savior Lutheran Church 
in Lake Worth, Florida. Both were graduates of Lake City High School.[127] 
They had a daughter, Judith Ann, and a son, Fred M. Smith. During the off-season 
and in retirement, Smith and his wife continued to live in Lake Worth.[32][128] 
In November 1977, Smith suffered a massive stroke while dining with his 
family at a restaurant in Lake Worth. He did not regain consciousness and 
died at age 62 at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach.[129] In 
1983, the "Mayo Smith Society" was formed in Smith's memory.[130][131] 
It continues to operate as the international fan club for Tigers fans, 
sponsoring an annual spring training trip, an annual gathering in Detroit, 
making charitable contributions, and publishing the "Tigers Stripes" and 
"E-Mayo Flash" newsletters.[132] Society co-founder Dale Petroskey (later 
president of the Baseball Hall of Fame) told The New York Times in 2006 
that "Smith inspired the club's name because he was 'a somewhat forgettable 
figure in Tiger history' who shocked baseball in 1968 by moving center 
fielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop for the Series. 'What an amazingly 
bold roll of the dice . . . Mayo gambled big time, and he won."[133] Since 
2004, the Mayo Smith Society has given its annual "King Tiger Award" to 
a Detroit Tigers player for on-field and off-field contributions.[132]
