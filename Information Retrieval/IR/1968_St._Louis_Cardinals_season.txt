The 1968 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 87th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 77th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
97–65 during the season, winning their second consecutive NL pennant, this 
time by nine games over the San Francisco Giants. They lost in 7 games 
to the Detroit Tigers in the 1968 World Series. The Cardinals would not 
return to postseason until 1982. Following the season, Major League Baseball 
announced plans to split both the National and American Leagues into East 
and West divisions starting with the 1969 season in order to accommodate 
the inclusion of two new franchises to each league. The Cardinals were 
assigned to the new National League East division. Originally, the Cardinals 
were placed in the National League West division. However, the New York 
Mets, wanting to compensate for the loss of home games against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, desired three extra games against 
the Cardinals, the two-time defending NL champions. The Cardinals were 
thus moved to the National League East division along with the Chicago 
Cubs, who wished to maintain their long-standing rivalry with the Cardinals. 
The Atlanta Braves and Cincinnati Reds were correspondingly shifted to 
the National League West despite both being east of St. Louis and Chicago, 
a configuration maintained until 1993. Pitcher Bob Gibson won both the 
MVP Award and the Cy Young Award this year, with a 1.12 ERA, 22 wins, and 
268 strikeouts. From June 2 to July 30, Gibson allowed only two earned 
runs in ninety-two innings pitched.[3] For the season, opposing batters 
only had a batting average of .184, and an on-base percentage of .233 against 
Gibson. Gibson also won a Gold Glove this year, as did shortstop Dal Maxvill 
and outfielder Curt Flood. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos =

previous year, they faced a tougher American League opponent in the Detroit 
Tigers, who had also won their pennant easily, behind the 31-win season 
of Denny McLain. Even though both Gibson and McLain were league MVPs that 
season, another Tigers starter, Mickey Lolich, stole the show, becoming 
the last pitcher to date to win three complete games in a single Series. 
Gibson excelled again in this World Series, winning Games 1 and 4. He had 
17 strikeouts in Game 1 and totaled 35 strikeouts in the Series, both still 
World Series records. The Cardinals advanced to a 3–1 series lead, but 
the Tigers completed an improbable comeback by winning the final three 
games of the series to claim the championship, 4 games to 3. It was St. 
Louis' last Series appearance until 1982, and their last Series before 
MLB adopted its divisional format. AL Detroit Tigers (4) vs. NL St. Louis
