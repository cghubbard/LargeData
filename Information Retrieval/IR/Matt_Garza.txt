Matthew Scott "Matt" Garza (born November 26, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He made his MLB debut in 2006 with the Minnesota Twins, and has also played 
in MLB for the Tampa Bay Rays, Chicago Cubs and Texas Rangers. With the 
Rays, Garza was named the American League Championship Series Most Valuable 
Player in 2008, and threw a no-hitter on July 26, 2010. Born in Selma, 
California south of Fresno. Garza attended Washington Union High School 
in Easton,California where he starred in baseball and football. Garza continued 
with baseball at Fresno State.[1] After struggling his first two years 
at Fresno State, Garza excelled in his junior season, averaging 10 strikeouts 
per nine innings pitched.[2] Garza was the 25th pick in the first round 
of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, drafted by the Minnesota Twins.[3] 
Entering 2006, Garza was ranked as the Minnesota Twins seventh-best prospect 
by Baseball America.[4] He gained attention for rising through the ranks 
of the Twins' minor league system, starting the season at Single-A Fort 
Myers and ending at the major league level, pitching with the Double-A 
New Britain Rock Cats and the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings in between. 
Garza was a combined 14–4 at the three minor league levels in 2006, with 
a 1.99 ERA and 154 strikeouts in 135 ⅔ innings. He earned All-Star berths 
in the Single-A Florida State League and Double-A Eastern League. Backed 
by those numbers, Garza earned the USA Today Minor League Player of the 
Year Award for 2006, the second consecutive year in which a Twin won the 
award (in 2005, Garza's teammate Francisco Liriano was the winner).[5] 
On August 8, Minnesota purchased Garza's contract, promoting him to the 
majors to replace the injured Liriano.[6] Garza is one of a small number 
of players to advance through the minors and reach the major league level 
in a single season. On August 11, his major league debut, Garza allowed 
seven earned runs in 2 ⅔ innings to the Toronto Blue Jays.[7] Garza earned 
his first win on August 23 against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing just 
one unearned run in six innings.[8] Entering 2007, Garza was rated as the 
top prospect in the Twins organization[9] and the 21st-best prospect in 
Major League Baseball[10] by Baseball America. Garza did not make the Twins 
rotation out of spring training, being assigned to Rochester instead. He 
was recalled to the Minnesota Twins on June 28 after being passed by other 
Twins pitching prospects such as Kevin Slowey and Scott Baker due to disagreements 
with the club over his pitch selection.[11] He was selected to the 2007 
All-Star Futures Game in San Francisco, but did not get to participate 
due to his call up to the major league club.[12] On July 6, in a game against 
the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field, Garza became the first Twins 
pitcher to bat in an American League game since Allan Anderson in 1989. 
Garza was put in the eight-spot when catcher Mike Redmond left the game 
after his head was cut by Jim Thome's bat on a backswing. Joe Mauer, the 
designated hitter for the game, replaced Redmond as the catcher, forcing 
Garza into the lineup. On July 29, Garza recorded a career-high 11 strikeouts 
in six innings against the Cleveland Indians. After the 2007 season, the 
Twins traded Garza along with Jason Bartlett and Eduardo Morlan to the 
Tampa Bay Rays for Delmon Young, Jason Pridie, and Brendan Harris. Garza 
had a successful season with the Rays, going 11–9 while posting a 3.70 
ERA. He also earned MVP honors for the ALCS in which he helped the Rays 
beat the Boston Red Sox by posting a 1.38 ERA in two starts, and earning 
the decisive victory in game 7 of the ALCS. On June 26, he carried a perfect 
game through 6.0 innings against the Florida Marlins before giving up a 
leadoff home run in the seventh inning to Hanley Ramírez. That proved his 
only blemish as he won the complete game with 10 strikeouts and one walk. 
As of the end of July 2009, opposing batters were hitting .222 against 
him, which was the second-lowest batting average in the league; he was 
just behind Edwin Jackson (.216), and was followed by Jarrod Washburn (.224) 
and Scott Feldman (.228; .217 as a starter).[13] In 2009 he had the lowest 
range factor of all starting major league pitchers (0.93).[14] Garza threw 
a no-hitter on July 26, 2010 at home against the Detroit Tigers, becoming 
the fifth pitcher that season to throw a no-hitter. It was also the first 
no-hitter thrown by a Tampa Bay Rays pitcher in the team's history.[15] 
He faced the minimum 27 batters as the lone base runner, Brennan Boesch, 
who drew a 1-out second inning walk, was erased on a double play hit by 
Ryan Raburn in the next at-bat. Garza threw 120 pitches, 80 for strikes, 
and tallied six strikeouts.[16] 101 of his pitches were fastballs[17] On 
January 7, 2011, Garza was traded from the Rays to the Chicago Cubs as 
part of an eight-player deal. The Cubs sent outfielder Sam Fuld, and prospects 
Chris Archer, Hak-Ju Lee, Brandon Guyer, and Robinson Chirinos to the Rays 
for Garza, outfielder Fernando Perez and minor league left-handed pitcher 
Zac Rosscup.[18][19] In spring training, Garza led all pitchers in the 
major leagues in earned runs given up, with 25, in 21.2 innings.[20] Garza 
finished the season with a 10–10 record and a 3.32 ERA.[21] The Cubs traded 
Garza to the Texas Rangers on July 22, 2013, in exchange for Mike Olt, 
Justin Grimm, C. J. Edwards, and Neil Ramirez.[22] While with the Rangers, 
Garza had an ERA of 4.38. After the 2013 season, the Milwaukee Brewers 
reportedly agreed to sign Garza to what was initially reported as a four-year, 
$52 million contract. On January 26, 2014 the Brewers announced that the 
signing was official. The deal is reportedly guaranteed for $50 million 
over the course of four years, with each season having an additional $1 
million in performance bonuses. There is also a performance/appearance 
based vesting option for a fifth year, worth $13 million, making the total 
contract worth as much as 5 years and $67 million.[23] With the contract, 
Garza became the most expensive free agent that the Brewers have ever signed, 
surpassing Jeff Suppan's four year, $42 million contract signed prior to 
the 2007 season. During the 2015 season, it was announced that Garza would 
be shut down for the rest of the season due to poor performance and the 
club wanting to look at younger starters. Garza reacted badly to the idea 
and did not pitch in any of the team′s final 28 games. .[24] Garza finished 
his 2016 season with a 4.51 ERA.[25] Garza throws a 2-seam fastball that 
varies from 90–94 mph, as well as a 4-seam fastball that varies from 93–96 mph 
that can, on occasion, reach 98. His arsenal also includes a big, breaking 
curveball that he throws for 72–77 mph, a hard, tight slider in the mid-high 
80s, and an occasional changeup he uses to fool hitters, especially lefties. 
His slider is considered his best strikeout pitch, and he is capable of 
throwing it for strikes late in the count to keep batters off balance.[26] 
Rays' pitching coach Jim Hickey has commented that Garza has "the best 
stuff on the staff".[27] Garza is married to his high school sweetheart; 
together they have four children. Garza is of Mexican descent. As someone 
who has had to deal with teen pregnancy, Garza was invited to sit on a 
panel for The Candie's Foundation in New York City about combating teen 
pregnancy with Hayden Panettiere and Bristol Palin on May 6, 2009.[28]
