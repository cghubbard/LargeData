As coach As manager John Thomas Krol (July 5, 1936 – May 30, 1994) was 
an American coach and manager in Major League Baseball. Primarily a second 
baseman and shortstop, the right-handed hitting and throwing Krol never 
reached the Major Leagues during his playing career (1954–66). The native 
of Chicago, Illinois, spent most of that period in the St. Louis Cardinals 
farm system, and became a playing manager in 1966 with the Rock Hill, South 
Carolina, franchise of the Class A Western Carolinas League. By 1972, however, 
he was managing at the Triple-A level in the St. Louis system, and he received 
his Major League baptism as a Cardinals coach in 1977. He served on the 
Redbirds' staff through 1980 and twice served as interim manager (in 1978 
and 1980), winning one game and losing two. Krol then joined the San Diego 
Padres as a Major League coach (1981–86) (serving on Dick Williams' staff 
in 1984 when the 1984 Padres won the National League pennant) and minor 
league manager (1987–90). Krol returned to the Cardinals as manager of 
the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds in 1992–93. Over his 17-year minor league 
managerial career, he won 1,160 games and lost 1,139 (.503) and won three 
championships. He died at age 57 from cancer in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
The Padres created the Jack Krol Award, which annually honors the club's
