Milton Scott May (born August 1, 1950) is an American former professional 
baseball player and coach. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball 
from 1970 to 1984 for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Houston Astros, Detroit Tigers, 
Chicago White Sox, and San Francisco Giants.[1] May drove in the one millionth 
run in Major League Baseball history on May 4, 1975, with a three-run home 
run.[2] Milt was signed as an infielder in the 11th round of the 1968 Major 
League Baseball draft by the Pirates, who then converted him into a catcher.[3] 
He was a good handler of pitchers and a left-handed line drive hitter who 
rarely swung at a bad pitch, but also was reputedly the slowest runner 
in the majors for much of his career.[4] At age 21, May was a member of 
the Pirates team that won the 1971 World Series.[1] In the seventh inning 
of Game Four of that series, his pinch-hit single drove in Bob Robertson 
with the winning run in a 4-3 Pirate victory.[5] Tragedy struck the Pirates 
in late 1972, when outfielder Roberto Clemente died in a plane crash. May 
was slated to replace Clemente in the Pirates' lineup in 1973, with catcher 
Manny Sanguillén moving to right field.[6] However the experiment ended 
by July when it was determined that Sanguillén could not adjust to playing 
in the outfield and May was back on the Pirates' bench.[7] After the 1973 
season, May was traded to the Houston Astros for Jerry Reuss.[3] He became 
the Astros starting catcher, replacing veteran Johnny Edwards.[8] He led 
National League catchers with a .993 fielding percentage in 1974.[9] May 
led all National League catchers in 1975 with 70 assists and 47 baserunners 
caught stealing.[1] He was also charged with 18 passed balls in 1975 for 
the Astros, who had knuckleballer Joe Niekro on their staff.[7] On May 
4, 1975, May drove in Bob Watson for Major League Baseball's one millionth 
run.[2] May was then traded to Detroit, where he played six games in 1976, 
before a broken ankle sidelined him for the season. He recovered in 1977 
to record 12 double plays and 0 passed balls.[1] In 1978, May platooned 
with an up-and-coming Lance Parrish. By 1979, Parrish had taken over as 
the regular Tigers catcher, and May was traded to the Chicago White Sox. 
After only one year in Chicago, he then signed with the San Francisco Giants 
as a free agent.[3] On June 13, 1980, during a 3-1 win over the New York 
Mets‚ May hit the 9000th home run in the history of the Giants franchise. 
John Montgomery Ward hit home run #1 in 1883‚ and the 8‚000th was hit by 
Bobby Bonds on September 4‚ 1971. In 1981, he batted .310 -which was the 
highest mark ever for a Giants catcher.[citation needed] In August 1983, 
the Giants traded him back to the Pirates for catcher Steve Nicosia.[3] 
May retired as a player after the 1984 season.[1] In a fifteen-year major 
league career, May played in 1,192 games, accumulating 971 hits in 3,693 
at bats for a .263 career batting average along with 77 home runs and 443 
runs batted in.[1] He ended his career with a .986 fielding percentage.[1] 
May became a coach for the Pirates in 1987, serving under manager Jim Leyland.[10] 
He was major-league hitting coach for ten seasons in Pittsburgh (1987–96) 
and two with the Florida Marlins (1997–98).[2] He spend the first half 
of the 1999 season with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and was later named a 
pitching coach for the Colorado Rockies.[2] May was a scout for the Rockies 
in 2000, then spent the 2001 season as a Pirates minor-league hitting coordinator."[2] 
He is the son of baseball third baseman Pinky May and the brother-in-law 
of pitcher Pat Osburn.[1] May was a shortstop at St. Petersburg High School.[2] 
He lives in Bradenton, Florida with his wife, Brenda.[2] He has two children:
