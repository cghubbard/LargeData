The China Baseball League (Chinese: 中国棒球联赛, CBL) is a professional baseball 
league under the administration of Chinese Baseball Association, founded 
in 2002. The league suspended operations in 2012 due to financial troubles 
after the 2011 season, but returned in 2014.[1] Stadiums have standard 
dimensions of 98m, 122m, 98m. Teams also participate in five-game tournaments 
throughout the year such as the National Baseball Championships, the National 
Youth Baseball Championships and the Cross-Straits Baseball Tournament. 
The original four teams were the Beijing Tigers, Tianjin Lions, Shanghai 
Eagles and Guangzhou Lightning. The Hope Stars and Dragons joined them 
in 2005. The Hope Stars were an under-21 team of promising players from 
around the country. Henan Elephants entered CBL as an expansion team in 
2009. The first season ran from April 26 to May 25, 2002 with a one-game 
championship. In the 2004 season, the defending champion Beijing Tigers 
once again defeated the Tianjin Lions in the best-of-five finals. They 
came back from an 0-2 deficit to win the series 3 games to 2. The opening 
day of the 2005 season was April 1, 2005. The regular season ended on June 
26. In the 2005 best-of-five championship series, the Beijing Tigers swept 
the Tianjin Lions, three games to none, giving the Tigers their third straight 
title. (The 2005 championship series was abbreviated to three games due 
to SARS.) In 2014 the CBL returned with a six-game regular season with 
four teams - the Tigers and Pegasus in the North Division and the Leopards 
and Lions in the South Division. In the finals the Tigers defeated the 
Lions in the best-of-three finals two games to one. hotStar United began 
sponsoring the CBL in 2014. The 2015 regular season featured six teams 
from Division 1 playing 15 games each. Division 2 teams played six games 
each. The Jiangsu Pegasus swept the Beijing Tigers two games to none to 
win their first-ever championship. In 2007, the CBL began a support relationship 
with Nippon Professional Baseball, Japan's baseball league. The agreement 
allows the Japanese clubs to send coaches and players to China and Chinese 
players to train at the Japanese facilities. All teams will have a Japanese 
team as a partner. Beijing will pair with the Yomiuri Giants, Sichuan with 
the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, Shanghai with the Hanshin Tigers, Jiangsu with 
the Chiba Lotte Marines and Guangdong with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. Tianjin 
will continue its existing relationship with the Yokohama BayStars which
