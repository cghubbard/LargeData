As player As coach George Warren "Barney" Schultz (August 15, 1926 â€“ September 
6, 2015) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He was 
a knuckleball pitcher in the Major Leagues for all or parts of seven seasons 
between 1955 and 1965 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Detroit Tigers, and 
Chicago Cubs. In October 1966 he was briefly reactivated by the Cardinals 
so that he could receive a Major League pension. He was signed by the Philadelphia 
Phillies in 1944 after playing at Burlington City High School.[1] Throughout 
much of his career, Schultz lived in Beverly with his wife and children, 
working in the off season as a carpenter and haberdasher.[2] Schultz was 
strictly a relief pitcher, appearing in 227 games overall without any starts. 
He was an early specialist in the knuckleball. He had two good years with 
the Cubs, then was traded to the Cardinals where he had his best season, 
1964, with 14 saves (a significant quantity in those days) and a 1.64 earned 
run average. Probably his most visible moment was in Game 3 of the 1964 
World Series, in which he gave up a game-winning home run to Mickey Mantle 
in the nationally-televised Saturday game. However, he had been credited 
with a save in Game 1, and the Cardinals ultimately won the Series in seven 
games. Cardinals' utility catcher Bob Uecker was sometimes called upon 
to catch when Schultz was brought in to pitch. It was from that experience 
that he drew some of his material when joking about the difficulties of 
catching the knuckler. In between, Schultz played winter ball in Venezuela 
for the Gavilanes de Maracaibo club of the Western Professional Baseball 
League, where he won seven consecutive strikeout titles from 1954 through 
1960.[3] After his playing career ended, Schultz was the Cardinals' roving 
minor league pitching instructor from 1967 to 1970 and Major League pitching 
coach from 1971 to 1975. He was a member of the Chicago Cubs' coaching 
staff in 1977. Schultz was a resident of Edgewater Park Township, New Jersey, 
where his home was filled with memorabilia of his baseball career.[4] Schultz 
is a member of the South Jersey Baseball Hall of Fame.[5] He died on September
