Crosby Kennett High School.[5] Locke is the all-time leader in wins for 
Kennett High School.[6] Locke is nicknamed "The Redstone Rocket".[1][7] 
In June 2006, The Conway Daily Sun sports editor Lloyd Jones established 
the nickname because of Locke's fastball, the name of his hometown (Redstone, 
New Hampshire, a neighborhood within the town of Conway, New Hampshire), 
and in reference to America's first man in space, Alan Shepard of Derry, 
New Hampshire, whose Freedom 7 flight was launched by a Redstone rocket.[8][9] 
Locke was the first selection in the second round in the 2006 Major League 
Baseball draft by the Atlanta Braves.[10] Locke was assigned to the Gulf 
Coast Braves (Rookie League) upon signing with the organization on June 
18, 2006.[11] In June 2007 the Atlanta Braves assigned Locke to the Danville 
Braves in the Advanced Rookie Appalachian League.[11] In November 2007, 
Baseball America ranked Locke #8 on their Atlanta Braves Top 10 Prospects 
list.[12] Locke played for the Rome Braves in 2008. In December 2008, Baseball 
America ranked Locke #7 on their Atlanta Braves Top 10 Prospects list.[13] 
Locke started the 2009 season with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans. On June 3, 
2009, the Braves traded Locke to the Pittsburgh Pirates along with Charlie 
Morton and Gorkys Hernández in exchange for Nate McLouth.[14][15] When 
Locke was acquired, the Pirates assigned him to their Class A Advanced 
affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats. In 2010, the Pirates took control of 
the Sarasota Reds and moved the team to Bradenton, where the club was renamed 
the Bradenton Marauders. Locke was assigned to the new team and was the 
starting pitcher in the team's second-ever game, against the Fort Myers 
Miracle on April 9, 2010.[16] On July 14, 2010, Locke was promoted to the 
Pirates' Double A team, the Altoona Curve.[17] In January 2011, Baseball 
America ranked Locke #8 on their Pittsburgh Pirates Top 10 Prospects list.[18] 
In 2011, Locke pitched for Altoona and the Indianapolis Indians before 
being called up to the majors in September 2011. He made his MLB debut 
on September 10, 2011 against the Florida Marlins which resulted in a loss. 
He pitched a total of 4 games in 2011 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and went 
0–3 with an ERA of 6.48 and 5 strikeouts. In November 2011, Baseball America 
ranked Locke #10 on their Pittsburgh Pirates Top 10 Prospects list.[19] 
Locke recorded his first career win on October 1, 2012, giving up one run 
in six innings against the Atlanta Braves. In 2013 he was selected as an 
All-Star by San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy. Locke did not pitch 
in the game due to back stiffness. Despite making the 2013 All-Star team, 
Locke was demoted to the Pirates' Double-A affiliate Altoona Curve on August 
28. Locke had a 2.15 ERA in his first 18 starts, but then had an 8.10 ERA 
over his next eight. Locke was also left off the NLDS roster. Jeff Locke 
was promoted from Altoona in a spot start on June 8, 2014 after Gerrit 
Cole was placed on the disabled list.[20] After being recalled for the 
2nd stint of the season Locke showed success, carrying a 2.13 ERA over 
his last seven starts before the 2014 All-Star Break, including a very 
dominant performance against his mentor, A. J. Burnett, where he picked 
up his second win of the season. Prior to 2009, Locke used an over-the-head 
pitching delivery. Upon his trade to the Pirates, pitching coach Wally 
Whitehurst recommended that Locke change his pitching style to incorporate 
a turn toward first base. which would aid deceptiveness. Locke returned 
to the overhead delivery during spring training in 2016, because he had
