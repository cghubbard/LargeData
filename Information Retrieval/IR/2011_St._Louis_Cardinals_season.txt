The St. Louis Cardinals' 2011 season was the team's 130th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri, its 120th season in the National League, and its sixth 
season at Busch Stadium III. The Cardinals began their season at home against 
the San Diego Padres on March 31, following an 86–76 (.531) record and 
second-place finish in the NL Central in 2010. The team returned to postseason 
play in 2011 as the Wild Card team, after finishing second in the NL Central 
to the Milwaukee Brewers by six games. The Cardinals beat the Philadelphia 
Phillies in five games in the Division Series[1] and the Milwaukee Brewers 
in six games in the National League Championship Series. They defeated 
the Texas Rangers in the 2011 World Series in seven games. Cardinals co-owner, 
team treasurer, and member of the board of directors Andrew N. "Drew" Baur 
died suddenly at his home at 66, in Gulf Stream, Florida on February 20, 
2011.[2][3] On Oct 18, 2010, manager Tony La Russa decided to return for 
his 16th season with the Cardinals after agreeing to terms for a new one-year 
contract, and a mutual option for a second year. Bullpen coach Marty Mason 
was not retained, but all the other coaches returned with extended contracts.[4] 
On November 2, 2010, the team named a bullpen coach to replace Mason: Derek 
Lilliquist, the team's pitching coordinator for the last three seasons. 
Also announced that day: Greg Hauck was promoted to head athletic trainer, 
while longtime head trainer Barry Weinberg assumed duties as assistant 
athletic trainer.[5] On Oct 6, 2010, the Cardinals picked up the $16 million 
option on Albert Pujols.[6] On November 30, 2010, the Cardinals traded 
pitcher Blake Hawksworth for middle-infielder Ryan Theriot in a trade with 
Dodgers. They also signed free agent left-handed relief pitcher Brian Tallet.[7] 
On December 12 the Cardinals cleared a space for Theriot at shortstop by 
trading incumbent shortstop Brendan Ryan to the Seattle Mariners for Class-A 
prospect Maikel Cleto.[8] On December 4, 2010, the Cardinals signed 34-year-old 
free agent Lance Berkman (formerly with the Houston Astros and then Yankees 
in 2010) to a 1-year, $8 million deal.[9] Berkman, who was slated to play 
right field regularly for the first time since 2004, had slumped to a .248 
average in 2010[10] and had hit particularly poorly after his midseason 
trade to the New York Yankees. As a Cardinal in 2011, he hit 31 home runs 
and was named NL Comeback Player of the Year.[11] On December 14, 2010, 
the Cardinals signed free agent catcher Gerald Laird to a one-year contract.[12] 
On January 15, 2011, Albert Pujols, through his agent Dan Lozano, told 
the Cardinals that the date to report to Spring training (Feb. 18) was 
the deadline to reach a deal on a new contract.[13] Negotiations failed 
to produce a deal, and on February 16 Pujols suspended negotiations, citing 
an unwillingness to be distracted during the season, including Spring training. 
Pujols received $16 million in 2011 and $111 million over his previous 
eight seasons. Pujols had asked for a 10-year deal, worth up to $300 million, 
averaging $30 million per year.[14] On January 21, 2011, the Cardinals 
signed free agent backup infielder Nick Punto to a one-year contract for 
$750,000.[15] In a surprise announcement on February 4, the Cardinals signed 
former Cardinal Jim Edmonds (2000–07) to a minor-league contract, and an 
invitation to Spring training as a non-roster invitee. He hit 241 home 
runs (4th in rank) as a Cardinal in his eight years, made three All-Star 
teams (2000, 2003, 2005), and won six Gold Gloves (2000–05). He needed 
seven home runs to reach 400.[16][17] On February 18, Edmonds announced 
his retirement from baseball, citing the risk of permanent damage in his 
comeback from Achilles tendon surgery.[18] On October 6, 2010, the Cardinals 
picked up the option on LH relief specialist Trever Miller after he vested 
his option with his 45th appearance in 2010 (57 G), and finished the season 
healthy.[6] On November 16, 2010, the Cardinals signed free agent pitcher 
Jake Westbrook to a two-year deal through 2012 for $16.5 million, with 
a mutual option for 2013, and a full no-trade clause. The Cardinals had 
acquired Westbrook in a 2010 trade that sent Ryan Ludwick to the Padres.[19] 
On Jan 15, 2011, the Cardinals agreed to a one-year contract with reliever 
Kyle McClellan in avoiding arbitration. Salary was not announced.[20] The 
Cardinals suffered a severe setback at the beginning of spring training. 
On Feb 24, 2011, it was confirmed that ace pitcher Adam Wainwright needed 
Tommy John surgery on his right elbow after experiencing discomfort in 
throwing batting practice on February 21. It meant missing, at a minimum, 
the entirety of the 2011 season.[21] Wainwright was coming off a 2010 season 
in which he won a career-high 20 games, made the All-Star game, and finished 
second in National League Cy Young Award voting. The Feb 28 surgery on 
Wainwright in St. Louis was described as 'successful.'[22] Starting in 
2010, the Cardinals started a campaign to award longtime hero Stan Musial 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The initiative was nicknamed Stand for 
Stan. On February 15, 2011, the program came to fruition, as President 
Barack Obama awarded Musial the medal.[23][24] The Cardinals released their 
2011 Spring training schedule on December 3, 2010.[25]St. Louis Cardinals 
Spring Training Schedule The scheduled exhibition game on March 29, vs. 
their AA-level Springfield Cardinals team, was canceled the day before 
because bad weather was expected.[26] The Cardinals opened 2011 with a 
loss at home against the San Diego Padres on March 31, after leading 3–2 
with two outs in the 9th inning. Matt Holliday hit what looked to be the 
game-winning home run in the bottom of the 8th, but closer Ryan Franklin 
gave up a game-tying home run in that 9th inning, sending the game to extra 
innings. The Padres scored twice in the 11th to win 5–3.[27] It was a sign 
of things to come for Franklin in 2011. That evening, Holliday complained 
of pains, leading to an emergency appendectomy the next day.[28] After 
missing only seven games while recuperating from surgery, Holliday returned 
to the lineup on April 10, singling and drawing two walks in a 6–1 victory 
over the Giants.[29] Lance Berkman received the NL Player of the Week award 
on April 18, batting .417 (10-for-24), leading the majors with six HRs, 
12 RBIs, and 1.167 Slugging percentage, and also having two multi-homer 
games.[30] Matt Holliday (.408) and Lance Berkman (.393) were 1–3 respectively 
in the NL batting lead after the first month of the season ended, April 
30. Holliday also led the NL in OBP (.511), and Berkman led the NL in both 
slugging (.753) and OPS (1.207). The Cardinals recovered from a 2–6 start 
to finish in first place (16–11) by two games over the Reds at the end 
of April, and the entire team was also No. 1 in sweeping all three NL hitting 
percentages at .295/.362/.451, having a .812 OPS and also leading in hits 
(281), runs (144) total bases (429), and also struck out the fewest times 
(168). All those base runners led to them also leading in grounding into 
the most double plays (36), with Albert Pujols (.245/.305/.453, .758 OPS) 
owning the NL lead with nine. The Cardinals rose to first place in the 
standings despite major problems in the bullpen. Closer Ryan Franklin blew 
four of his first five save opportunities and the Cardinals lost all four 
of those games. Franklin never got another save opportunity after blowing 
a save against the Dodgers on April 17, and finished the month with a 10.12 
ERA.[31] Mitchell Boggs got the call as closer[32] and recorded three saves 
before blowing another save (leading to another Cardinals blown-save loss) 
against Houston on April 26.[33] Left-handed reliever Trever Miller was 
hit for an .899 OPS by opposition batters in April.[34] Third baseman David 
Freese suffered a broken bone in his left hand on May 1 from being hit 
by a pitch.[35] Freese did not return until the end of June. The Cardinals 
continued to search for an effective closer in May.[36] Rookie Eduardo 
Sanchez filled the role for a while in early May,[37] then Fernando Salas 
took the job and recorded seven saves in seven chances in the second half 
of the month.[38] Jaime García flirted with history on May 6, pitching 
7 1⁄3 innings of perfect baseball against the Milwaukee Brewers at home, 
bidding for the first perfect game in Cardinals' history, and the first 
no-hitter since Bud Smith on September 3, 2001.[39] He ended with a 2-hit, 
complete-game shutout (his 2nd of 2011), after losing his perfect bid with 
a walk and a hit in the 8th inning. He later gave up a double in the 9th, 
the only runner to reach second base. He walked one and struck out eight, 
and a double-play in the eighth helped preserve his shutout, the third 
of his career. The Cardinals were a strong 17–12 in May and finished the 
month 2 1⁄2 games ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central[40] 
despite numerous injuries to key players. Albert Pujols struggled through 
a most uncharacteristic slump at the start of the season, going a career-worst 
105 at-bats without a home run[41] and finishing May with an unusually 
low .755 OPS for the first two months.[42] Tony La Russa, suffering from 
a severe case of shingles, missed six games, with bench coach Joe Pettini 
serving as acting manager.[43] Albert Pujols broke out of his season-long 
slump in style, hitting five home runs in the week that ended June 5 and 
winning NL Player of the Week honors.[44] Tony La Russa managed his 5,000th 
major league game (2,676–2,320–4   0.536) on June 10, but the milestone 
was marred by a shutout loss at Milwaukee. He joins Connie Mack as the 
only manager or coach in American sports history to reach 5,000 games.[45][46] 
On June 19, Albert Pujols hurt his wrist when an opposing player ran into 
him when Pujols was taking an errant throw from second baseman Peter Kozma. 
A subsequent MRI on June 20, showed a small fracture in the left wrist-forearm. 
Pujols estimated time on the DL was expected to be from four to six weeks, 
and after Wainwright and Pujols both going down and Holliday missing significant 
time, it became obvious that 2011 was going to be a rough year, maybe even 
a lost cause. Pujols had played in all 73 games before the injury.[47][48] 
Pujols's injury was 14th time the Cardinals used the disabled list that 
season for 12 different players, already more than they used all of the 
previous year. He joined Wainwright, Freese, Nick Punto, Allen Craig, Gerald 
Laird, Bryan Augenstein and Eduardo Sanchez on the DL.[49] Left-handed 
reliever Raúl Valdés was promoted from AAA Memphis on June 23. Valdes became 
the third lefty in the struggling bullpen, joining struggling southpaws 
Trever Miller and Brian Talletin the bullpen.[50] Disabled players David 
Freese (3b) and Nick Punto (Inf.), both out for over a month, were activated 
on June 27, providing relief for the injury-riddled team. Freese last played 
on May 1, and Punto on May 17.[51] Both players made instant impacts in 
their first game returning when they helped beat the Baltimore Orioles 
at Camden Yards in their first interleague game there.[52] Late in June 
the Cardinals cleared two ineffective relief pitchers from the roster. 
Miguel Batista, who had given up 27 hits and 19 walks in only 29 innings, 
was let go on June 22.[53] Former closer Ryan Franklin was given his unconditional 
release on June 29. He was 1–4 with an 8.46 ERA. Opponents battered him 
for a .367 average, plus 44 hits and nine home runs over 21 games, in only 
27 2⁄3 innings. He walked 7 and struck out 17, with a 1.84 WHIP[54] Right-handed 
pitcher Brandon Dickson's contract was called up to fill the roster spot 
vacated by Franklin's release.[55] After 81 games on June 29, the half-way 
point of the season, the team was 43–38 (.531) only 1 game behind the Milwaukee 
Brewers at 44–37 (.543). The Cardinals played very poorly for much of June, 
going 3–12 from June 10 to 26. At some time around the end of June, manager 
Tony La Russa decided to retire at the end of the season. He kept that 
decision secret from the team.[56] After an initial estimate of Albert 
Pujols out for 4-to-6 weeks projecting an August 1 return, a reevaluation 
follow-up from a CT scan on July 1 showed faster recovery than originally 
thought, raising the possibility of a return by July 15, right after the 
All-Star break.[57][58][59] However, Pujols surprised everyone by recovering 
very rapidly, and he was activated on July 5, after the minimum 15-days 
on the DL. Lefty reliever Brian Tallet was placed on the DL to make room 
for Pujols.[60] The team made a major trade on July 27, a four-for-four 
swap, dealing disgruntled Colby Rasmus (hitting only .246), left-handed 
relievers Trever Miller and Brian Tallet, and starter P. J. Walters to 
the Toronto Blue Jays. In return, the team received right-hand starter 
Edwin Jackson, left-hand specialist Marc Rzepczynski, right-hand reliever 
Octavio Dotel, and outfielder Corey Patterson. The team will also receive 
either three players to be named later, or cash. Jackson was traded earlier 
the day from the Chicago White Sox to the Blue Jays.[61] Rasmus had previously 
asked to be traded away from the Cardinals,[62] and at the time of the 
trade he was mired in a severe slump that saw him hitting .194 since May 
12.[63] Jon Jay, who had been getting more playing time as Rasmus struggled,[64] 
became the everyday center fielder. Kyle McClellan, promoted to the starting 
rotation to fill the gap caused by the loss of Adam Wainwright, returned 
to the bullpen.[65] Pujols got his 2,000th career hit on July 29, at Busch 
Stadium against the Cubs in the eighth inning with an RBI double. He became 
the fifth Cardinal to get to 2,000 hits, joining Stan Musial (3,630), Lou 
Brock (2,713), Rogers Hornsby (2,110), and Enos Slaughter (2,064). He got 
it in his 1,650th game, the 12th quickest. Musial got his in 1,507 games.[66] 
The team made another trade on July 31, just before the non-waiver deadline, 
acquiring shortstop Rafael Furcal from the Los Angeles Dodgers in return 
for an AA-outfielder Alex Castellanos.[67][68] Furcal displaced offseason 
acquisition Ryan Theriot, who committed 17 errors at shortstop for the 
Cardinals in 2011.[69] On Aug 11 the Cardinals signed free agent lefty 
specialist pitcher Arthur Rhodes, previously released by the Texas Rangers.[70] 
The Rhodes acquisition completed a radical in-season makeover of the Cardinal 
bullpen. The only Cardinal relievers in the bullpen on Opening Day who 
were still on the team at the end of the season were Mitchell Boggs and 
Jason Motte. Departures included Miguel Batista and Ryan Franklin (released), 
Bryan Augenstein (disabled and later sent to the minors) and lefty specialists 
Trever Miller and Brian Tallet (traded to Toronto). Additions over the 
course of the season included Rhodes, Marc Rzepcynski and Octavio Dotel 
(acquired from Toronto in the Rasmus trade), Kyle McClellan (sent back 
to the bullpen after the Cardinals traded for Edwin Jackson), and Lance 
Lynn and Fernando Salas (called up from the minor leagues). At the beginning 
of the month the Cardinals were 2 1⁄2 games behind the Brewers in the standings.[71] 
However, they lost two of three to Milwaukee on the road Aug. 1–3, then 
did the same at home on Aug. 9–11, giving the Brewers a four-game lead 
in the NL Central.[72] The team continued to stumble as the Brewers continued 
to win. Newly acquired shortstop Furcal hit only .240 for the month.[73] 
The Cardinals went 2–4 on a six-game road trip to Pittsburgh and Chicago, 
then came home and were swept in three games by a bad Dodger team. After 
close of business on August 24, the day the Dodgers completed their sweep, 
St. Louis had fallen ten games behind Milwaukee in the NL Central standings 
and 10 1⁄2 games behind the Atlanta Braves (and in third place) in the 
NL Wild Card standings. Manager Tony La Russa said on the struggles: "I 
guarantee that the team you have seen the past few weeks is not the team 
we have, and I believe you will start to see our team tomorrow."[74] Chris 
Carpenter and other veterans called for a closed, player-only team meeting, 
which was held the day after the Dodgers series ended.[75] St. Louis' odds 
of making the playoffs stood at 1.3%.[76] The sweep by Los Angeles dropped 
the Cardinals to 67–63. They ended the month on a positive note, taking 
three of four from the Pirates and sweeping the Brewers in Milwaukee Aug 
30 – September 1, improving their chances of making the playoffs to 4.3%.[77] 
The Cardinals set a new NL record of grounding into their 167th (and later, 
168th) double-play on September 26, breaking the record set by the 1958 
St. Louis Cardinals.[78] They finished the season with 169, five short 
of the all-time MLB record set by the 1990 Boston Red Sox.[79] After dropping 
two of three to the Reds the Cardinals played their last series of the 
season against Milwaukee September 5–7. St. Louis took two out of three 
and thus won five of its last six games against the Brewers, but Milwaukee 
still held a lead of 8 1⁄2 games. The Cardinals got as close as 4 1⁄2 games 
behind the Brewers later in September but Milwaukee played too well to 
be caught, clinching the Central Division title on September 23.[80] The 
same was not true of the wild-card leading Atlanta Braves. 10 1⁄2 games 
ahead of the Cardinals on August 24, Atlanta went only 6–7 over its next 
13 games before coming to St. Louis on September 9 to play a three-game 
series that would prove to be critical. In the first game, Atlanta led 
3–1 going into the bottom of the ninth inning, but a Schumaker single and 
walks to Furcal and Theriot set up a two-run, two-out Albert Pujols single 
to tie the game. The Cardinals won on a sacrifice fly by Nick Punto in 
the bottom of the 10th.[81] On September 10 St. Louis won by the same 4–3 
score when Michael Bourn flied out to right with the tying run on third.[82] 
On the 11th Yadier Molina hit a three-run double and the Cardinals won 
6–3 to complete the sweep. The sweep cut the gap in the wild-card race 
to 4 1⁄2 games, but St. Louis had only 16 games left to play[83] and its 
playoff chances were still only 7.7%.[84] The Cardinals followed up their 
sweep of Atlanta by going on the road to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and 
taking two of three from the Pirates and three of four from the NL-leading 
(and eventually 102-game-winner) Phillies. On the 14th Yadier Molina hit 
a two-run double and the Cardinals beat Pittsburgh 3–2 behind 6.2 strong 
innings from Edwin Jackson.[85] On the 16th an error by right fielder Corey 
Patterson allowed the Phillies to tie the game 2–2 in the bottom of the 
ninth, but the Cardinals scored on RBI hits from rookie Adron Chambers 
and Tyler Greene in the 11th and hung on to win 4–2.[86] On the 19th the 
Cardinals escaped with a 4–3 victory over the Phillies when Octavio Dotel 
got Hunter Pence to ground out in the bottom of the ninth with the tying 
run on base.[87] The Braves went 3–4 over this same stretch of games, losing 
to the Marlins on September 19 when Omar Infante hit a game-winning two-run 
homer in the bottom of the ninth inning.[88] The gap in the wild-card standings 
had decreased to 2.5 games but with only nine games left the Cardinals' 
playoff chances were still only 17.7%.[89] The Cardinals then won two of 
three at home against the Mets, but suffered a bitterly disappointing loss 
in the third game of that series, when Rafael Furcal let a ball roll through 
his legs in the top of the 9th, triggering a six-run Met rally that won 
the game 8–6.[90] Furcal was so upset by his error that he was talking 
about retirement before having a personal meeting with LaRussa.[91] The 
Braves led by two games with six games left and the Cardinals' playoff 
chances were 24.4%.[92] The Cardinals won two of three against the Cubs, 
winning 2–1 on September 24 via a bases-loaded walk and wild pitch by Carlos 
Mármol and recent callup Adron Chambers sprinted home with the winning 
run.[93] while the Braves lost two of three to the Nationals. Atlanta had 
a one-game lead with three games left.[94] The last series of the year 
for the Cardinals was against the terrible Houston Astros, and Atlanta's 
was against the powerful Philadelphia Phillies. And since the Redbirds 
were only one game out of the wild card, the last series was very key. 
The Cards were playing the worst team in the majors, and the Phillies were 
the best. The race and Boston and Tampa Bay's in the American League began 
stirring up attention around the country. The Cardinals lost in extra innings 
to Astros (who finished the year at 56–106) on the 26th on a walk-off squeeze 
bunt by Angel Sanchez, but Atlanta lost to the Phillies. On the 27th St. 
Louis overcame a bad start by Jake Westbrook and a 5–0 deficit, scoring 
five in the fourth and four more in the seventh and winning 13–6. The winning 
runs came via a two-run triple from Ryan Theriot.[95] Atlanta lost to Philadelphia 
again, and with one game left in the season the Cardinals and Braves were 
tied for the wild card. In the season finale, the Cardinals had little 
trouble with the Astros, winning 8–0 behind a complete game two-hit shutout 
from Carpenter.[96] The game ended about 9:25 PM CST. This was the first 
of two key clinchers Carpenter pitched in late 2011. The Braves started 
later. With their final regular-season game freshly on the books, Cardinals 
players and fans anxiously watched the still-ongoing Braves-Phillies match 
in Atlanta that was now in extra innings. They were two outs away from 
forcing a tie-breaker game, but a Chase Utley sacrifice fly tied the game 
3–3 in the top of the ninth. In the bottom of the 12th, the Braves stranded 
the winning run on third base. Finally, in the top of the 13th Hunter Pence 
hit an RBI infield single, and in the bottom of the inning Freddie Freeman 
of the Braves hit into a double play to lose the ballgame and eliminate 
Atlanta.[97] By edging Atlanta to clinch the Wild Card on the final day 
of the regular season, the 2011 Cardinals completed the largest comeback 
in history after 130 games,[98][99][100] (and collapses in Atlanta's point 
of view). They went 23–9 over their final 32 games to erase a 10.5 game 
deficit. They went 18–8 in the month of September while the Braves went 
9–18 for September to open the door. Since the Braves play in a different 
division, the two teams played fewer games against each other, also lowering 
the odds that the Cardinals had to catch up with the Braves in the Wild 
Card race.[101] St. Louis finished 90–72 and advanced to the postseason 
to face the NL East champion Philadelphia Phillies, heavily favored to 
move on. B. J. Rains ranked the Cardinals' Top 11 games of 2011, with the 
winner the September 24, 2–1 ninth-inning comeback win against the Cubs.[102] 
The team qualified for the Wild Card on the final day of the regular season 
and played the Philadelphia Phillies for the first time in postseason, 
in the NL Division Series best of five, starting the first two games at 
Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Game 1 of the NLDS ended an 11–6 Philadelphia 
victory. After Roy Halladay struggled in the first, allowing a three-run 
homer to Lance Berkman, he settled down, at one point retiring twenty-one 
Cardinal hitters in a row. After Game 1, Chris Carpenter, starting on three-day's 
rest for the first time in his career, allowed the Phillies to take a quick 
4–0 lead in Game 2. And with Cliff Lee on the mound for the Phils, the 
game seemed out of reach. "You can count on one finger the number of times 
you'll come back from four runs down against Cliff Lee", Lance Berkman 
said. That's exactly what the Cardinals did, and took a 5–4 lead after 
an RBI single by Albert Pujols. The series was tied at one game apiece. 
"That win was huge for us", Tony La Russa said. "Realistically, us winning 
three in a row was not really possible." The famous Rally Squirrel (aka, 
'Busch Squirrel'), made his first appearance in Game 3 on October 4, and 
then again appeared in Game 4 on October 5, running across Home Plate at 
Busch Stadium in front of Skip Schumaker who was batting. The pitch was 
called a ball, and Roy Oswalt protested that it should not have counted. 
Nothing he did changed the umpire's mind though. Schumaker later flew out 
to left. The team was ahead at the time, 3–2, and held on for the 5–3 victory. 
The Rally Squirrel was instantly adopted by the fans as the postseason 
mascot, and thousands of rally squirrel T-shirts were sold. His Twitter 
account started, and by October 6 it had over 11,000 followers; by October 
20, it had over 27,500 followers. The October 7, Game 5 winner-take-all 
in the NLDS pitted Cardinals' ace Chris Carpenter vs. Roy Halladay, his 
best friend off-the-field for the Phillies, at Citizens Bank Park.[103] 
Carpenter threw an outstanding 3-hit shutout over Halladay and the Phillies 
to win the NLDS, 1–0.[1] The last out was made by St. Louisian Ryan Howard, 
who chopped a grounder to Nick Punto at second. Punto saw Howard on the 
ground by home plate, having torn his achilles. He then lobbed the ball 
to Albert Pujols, who caught it to send the Cardinals to the NLCS for the 
first time since 2006. The Milwaukee Brewers took the first game of the 
NLCS 9–6, but the Cardinals rebounded to take the next two games. The teams 
split the next two, and on Sunday, October 16, the Cardinals beat the Milwaukee 
Brewers in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series, for their 
18th NL Pennant, and became the only team to play in three of the last 
ten World Series. The final out was recorded when Jason Motte struck out 
the Brewers' Mark Kotsay on high heat.[104] David Freese was named NLCS 
MVP.[105][106] Allen Craig was the hero in Game 1 of the World Series, 
singling off Alexi Ogando to break a 2–2 tie. The Cards managed to win. 
The next day, Craig was almost the hero again when he singled off Ogando 
for the second straight night. The Rangers came back to win, 2–1, though, 
for Jason Motte's only blown save of the postseason. The next game, Albert 
Pujols went 5-for-6 with three home runs to put him in company with Babe 
Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players to hit three homers in a World 
Series game. Pujols also set a record with 14 total bases, hits in four 
consecutive innings, and tied a Series record with five hits, total bases, 
RBIs, and runs scored in one game.[107] But after the Rangers won the next 
two games, the Cardinals fell behind in the Series 3–2. The Cardinals, 
facing the Texas Rangers in the World Series, pulled-off one of the greatest 
comeback game wins in World Series history, with an amazing Game 6, winning 
10–9 in 11 innings after twice being one strike away from elimination. 
David Freese hit a two-out, two-strike, ninth-inning triple, to tie the 
game after trailing 7–5 in the ninth inning. Berkman followed with an RBI 
single in the 10th to tie the game again. Later, with the score tied 9–9, 
Freese hit a lead-off walk-off home run to dead centerfield in the 11th, 
off Mark Lowe at 11:39 pm CDT.[108] Lance Berkman had previously tied the 
game in the 10th with a single with 2 outs and 2 strikes, scoring Jon Jay. 
The win meant that the World Series would go to a seventh game for the 
first time since 2002. Of the last 13 Major League teams that won Game 
6 at home to force a Game 7 in the postseason, 12 went on to win Game 7.[109] 
The Rangers led 4 different times in the game, including with two outs 
and two strikes in both the ninth and the 10th, but the Cardinals refused 
to die.[110] Freese's game-winning home run was only the fifth in World 
Series Game 6 history (1960-Pit., 1975-Bos., 1991-Min., 1993-Tor).[111] 
The Cardinals set two records in their Game 6 win: the first team to come 
back twice from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings, and the first 
team to score in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th innings.[112] On October 
28, the Cardinals finished off their amazing, end-of-season run, starting 
after the Aug 24 game when they were 10 1⁄2 games behind for the NL Central 
Division lead. They defeated the Texas Rangers 4 games to 3, with a 6–2 
win in Game 7 of the World Series at their Busch Stadium home in front 
of 47,399 fans. It was the 36th time a team won the World Series in a Game 
7 (or Game 8).[113] The final out was made when David Murphy flew out to 
left field to give the Cardinals their eleventh world championship. David 
Freese, a graduate of Lafayette High School in St. Louis, won the MVP award 
for both the NLCS, and then for the World Series, as well as the Babe Ruth 
Award. He knocked in a record 21 RBIs in his post-season. Chris Carpenter 
set a franchise record for most wins (four) in a single postseason. Carpenter, 
9–2 overall in his Cardinals postseason career, ran his home postseason 
mark to 7–0 with a 2.15 ERA. Tony La Russa became only the ninth manager 
in major-league history to win at least three World Series.[114] On October 
31, three days after winning the World Series, manager Tony La Russa announced 
his retirement. He finished his managerial career after 33 seasons, third 
in all-time managerial wins and second all-time in post season wins.[115] 
November 3 marked the first time in the playing history of Albert Pujols 
that he would become a free agent. He officially became a free agent as 
of 12:01 Eastern.[116] On November 13, the Cardinals announced former Cardinals' 
catcher Mike Matheny as their new manager with a news conference on November 
14.[117] Although Dave Duncan did not officially retire, he took an extended 
leave of absence to tend to his ailing wife and his assistant Derek Lilliquist 
was nominated as his substitute. On November 16, MLB announced that La 
Russa came in third in voting for NL Manager of the Year. Kirk Gibson (of 
the Arizona Diamondbacks) in his first season won, and Ron Roenicke (of 
the Milwaukee Brewers) came in second.[118] Berkman's resurgence led him 
to a seventh-place MVP finish, and the National League Comeback Player 
of the Year award. On December 16, 2011, the Cardinals won the Organization 
of the Year award from Baseball America for the first time. Baseball America 
has given this award since 1982.[119] Source: mlb.com MLB Standings The 
Cardinals, and all 30 teams, had their schedules released by Major League 
Baseball on September 14, 2010. The Cardinals' opening is at home against 
the San Diego Padres on March 31.[121] Regular Season Schedule (calendar 
style) Regular Season Schedule (sortable text) All game times are in Central 
Time Zone. 86–70 St. Louis Cardinals won the series, 3–2. St. Louis Cardinals 
won the series, 4–2. St. Louis Cardinals won the series, 4–3. 2011 World 
Series (4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.) over Texas Rangers (A.L.) The 
overall average national Nielsen rating for the seven games was 10.0, with 
Fox's 14.7 rating for Game 7 being the network's highest for a World Series 
telecast since Game 4 of the 2004 World Series.[149] Game 6 on Oct 27, 
averaged 21.1 million viewers with a 12.7 rating and a 21 share. Through 
six games, the 2011 World Series on FOX is averaging a 9.3/15 in household 
rating/share, with 15.3 million viewers, +11% in rating over last year 
(8.4/14, 14.3 million) and 2008 (8.4/14, 13.6 million). Both were five 
game series. The current 9.3/15 average for the 2011 World Series would 
rank as the sixth highest-rated show (live+same day) in primetime, a ranking 
that was likely to improve with the inclusion of a rare Game 7. Game 6 
opened with an 8.5 at 8:00 PM EDT and grew steadily throughout the night 
averaging 11.7 from 9:00–9:30 PM EDT; 12.9 from 10:00–10:30 PM EDT; and 
13.2 from 11:00–11–30 PM EDT. The broadcast peaked with a 15.0 HH rating 
and 25.2 million viewers from midnight-12:30 AM EDT. From 8:00 to 11:00 
PM EDT, Game 6 averaged an 11.8 HH rating, with 19.4 million viewers. From 
11:00 PM EDT to its conclusion, the game averaged a 14.3 HH rating, with 
23.9 million viewers, +21% in rating and +23% in viewership compared to 
Primetime. Post mid-night, the game averaged a 14.8 rating and 24.9 million 
viewers, +25% in rating and +28% in average audience. St. Louis led all 
local markets for Game 6 with a 49.4/70, peaking at a 57.0/75 from 10:30–11:00 
PM EDT, with the final quarter-hour averaging a 53.1/82. Dallas averaged 
a World Series-high 47.1/67, while peaking at 55.7/81 from 11:15–11:30
