Martin E. Appel (born August 7, 1948), is an American public relations 
and sports management executive, television executive producer, and author.[1] 
Appel's career has included sports public relations (including as Public 
Relations Director for the New York Yankees), sports management, and serving 
as a television executive producer. He has written 20 books, including 
Pinstripe Empire: The New York Yankees from Before the Babe to After the 
Boss, published in 2012. Appel was born in Brooklyn, New York, and is Jewish.[1][2][3] 
His parents were Irving and Celia Appel.[4] He graduated from State University 
of New York at Oneonta in 1970.[5][6][7] He obtained a degree in political 
science and journalism.[6][8] Appel began his career in baseball while 
a student, after writing to then-New York Yankees public relations chief 
Bob Fishel.[6][9] Appel began his tenure with the Yankees in 1968 at age 
19, handling fan mail for Mickey Mantle.[10][11] In 1970, he became at 
21 the Yankees Assistant Public Relations Director.[12][13][13] He was 
named Public Relations Director of the team in 1973 by Yankee owner George 
Steinbrenner, becoming at 23 the youngest PR Director in Major League Baseball 
history, and remained in that position for four years.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] 
After resigning in early 1977, and starting a sports management company, 
Appel handled public relations for the New York Apples of World Team Tennis, 
a team featuring Billie Jean King and Vitas Gerulaitis.[6][21] When the 
league folded, he joined the staff of Major League Baseball Commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn.[13] While serving as VP for Public Relations for New York City 
television station WPIX, he won an Emmy Award as the executive producer 
of Yankee telecasts, a position he held for 11 years until 1992.[1][12][13][16][17][20] 
He also produced pre-season football telecasts for the New York Giants 
and New York Jets.[13] In addition, Appel worked for the Atlanta Committee 
for the Olympic Games, The Topps Company, and assisted in handling public 
relations for the Israel national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball 
Classic – Qualifier 1.[1][10][13][22] He is president of Marty Appel Public 
Relations, a New York-based public relations firm specializing in sports 
that he established in 1998.[1][13][16] The PR agency includes as its clients 
largely ones in the world of sports, but it also has clients in publishing, 
education, consumer products, medicine, and not-for-profit.[23] Appel has 
written 20 books, including a biography of baseball player King Kelly, 
and children's biographies of Yankees Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio.[16][24] 
He ghost-wrote auto-biographical books for umpire Eric Gregg, TV and radio 
talk show host Larry King, baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, baseball executive 
Lee MacPhail, and baseball players Thurman Munson (Thurman Munson: An Autobiography; 
"It was Thurman’s book; he was free to leave out whatever he wanted," said 
Appel) and Tom Seaver, and wrote a biography of Munson (Munson: The Life 
and Death of a Yankee Captain) published in 2009, which was a New York 
Times bestseller.[17][20][25] His Now Pitching for the Yankees (2002) was 
ESPN's best New York baseball book of the year.[20] Appel's Pinstripe Empire: 
The New York Yankees from Before the Babe to After the Boss, published 
in 2012, was the first narrative history of the team since Frank Graham's 
1943 book, The New York Yankees: An Informal History.[10] Former Yankee 
and author Jim Bouton described the book, in The New York Times, as: "good 
writing ... an insider’s history enlivened by a rich store of carefully 
researched anecdotes, most of which I’d never heard before ... a marvelous 
book to take on vacation."[11] Appel also wrote a children's version, Pinstripe 
Pride.[24] He served as Editor-at-Large for the National Baseball Hall 
of Fame and Museum's quarterly magazine, and helped write the text on the 
plaques of Hall of Fame inductees.[26] He has contributed to publications 
including Sports Collectors Digest, Yankees Magazine, and Encyclopedia 
Americana.[27] Appel served a member of the Board of Directors for the 
Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center, is a member of the Board of Trustees 
of the New York Sports Museum and Hall of Fame, and was a member of the 
Advisory Council to the Israel Baseball League.[10][22] In 2008, Appel 
was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.[13] In 2015, 
the Larchmont Historical Society inducted former Larchmonter Appel into 
Larchmont Luminaries.[24][28] Appel is married to Lourdes Appel, whom he 
married in June 2009, with the service being performed by Larchmont, New 
York, Mayor Liz Feld with Rabbi Jeff Sirkman participating.[6][16][17] 
He has two children from a prior marriage, Brian and Deborah.[1][17][29] 
He lived in Larchmont for 20 years, and also lived in Monsey, New York, 
in Riverdale, New York, and in Manhattan.[24][30][31] Ruttman, Larry (2013).
