On May 18, 2004, Randy Johnson, who was a pitcher for the Major League 
Baseball (MLB) Arizona Diamondbacks, pitched a perfect game against the 
Atlanta Braves. The game took place at Turner Field in Atlanta in front 
of a crowd of 23,381 people.[1] Johnson, who was 40 at the time, was the 
oldest pitcher in MLB history to throw a perfect game, surpassing Cy Young 
who was 37 when he threw his perfect game in 1904.[2] The perfect game 
was the 17th in baseball history, the predecessor being David Cone in 1999 
and the seventh in National League history, the predecessor being Dennis 
Martinez in 1991.[3] Going into the game, Johnson had a win-loss record 
of 3–4 with a 2.83 earned run average (ERA) in eight games.[4] On April 
16, 2004, Johnson pitched a complete game shutout against the San Diego 
Padres.[4] The game started at 7:36 p.m. in front of 23,381 people at Turner 
Field in Atlanta.[1] Johnson's catcher for the game was Robby Hammock,[5] 
who was playing his second season in the Majors. Johnson later praised 
Hammock stating, "I only shook [Hammock] off two or three times...He called 
a great game. The thing is he was probably the most excited guy in the 
clubhouse, and I'm happy for that. He's come a long way."[5] The last batter 
of the game was pinch-hitter Eddie Pérez, who was struck out on a 98 miles 
per hour (158 km/h) fastball.[6] Johnson struck out 13 batters in the game, 
the third-highest strikeout count in a MLB perfect game behind Sandy Koufax's 
14 Ks in 1965 and Matt Cain's 14 Ks in 2012.[6] The perfect game was Johnson's 
second no-hitter, the first in 1990 on the Seattle Mariners.[7] Johnson's 
perfect game was the first in the MLB since David Cone on July 18, 1999 
for the New York Yankees,[8] and the first in the National League since 
Dennis Martínez of the Montreal Expos on July 28, 1991.[8] Johnson, who 
was 40 at the time, surpassed Cy Young as the oldest pitcher to throw a 
perfect game in MLB history.[2] Young, who achieved the feat in 1904, was 
37 at the time.[2] -Johnny Estrada's first at-bat in the second inning 
was the longest of the night, requiring 10 pitches before striking out 
swinging on the 11th pitch. It was the only Braves at-bat that reached 
three balls in the count. -Veteran Chipper Jones struck out all three times. 
-Andruw Jones and Mark DeRosa were the only Braves batters without a strikeout. 
-The play that came closest to a hit was Mike Hampton's second at-bat in 
the sixth inning when a chop ground ball dribbling left of the second base 
bag resulted in Alex Cintrón performing a do-or-die running grab and throw 
to the first baseman, Shea Hillenbrand for the out. Robby Hammock, the 
catcher of Johnson's perfect game: Robin Yount, the bench coach of the 
Diamondbacks at the time: Luis Gonzalez, left fielder for the Diamondbacks 
at the time: Bob Brenly, Diamondbacks manager at the time: Italics denotes post-season perfect game
