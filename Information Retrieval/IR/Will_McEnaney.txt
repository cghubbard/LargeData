William Henry McEnaney (February 14, 1952 in Springfield, Ohio) is a former 
professional baseball player. He was a left-handed pitcher over parts of 
six seasons in Major League Baseball (1974–79) with the Cincinnati Reds, 
Montreal Expos, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals. McEnaney was 
one of five children of William and Eleanor (Grieb) McEnaney[1] and attended 
Springfield North High School in Springfield, Ohio. He was drafted by the 
Reds in the eighth round of the 1970 amateur draft.[2] He made his Major 
League debut at age 22 on July 3, 1974 in relief of starter Clay Carroll 
in a 4–1 Reds loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at Riverfront Stadium. McEnaney's 
first-ever inning was a 1–2–3 one as he induced popouts from Tommy John, 
Davey Lopes and Bill Buckner, and for the game he pitched two scoreless 
innings.[3] In his rookie season, he pitched 24 games, with a 2–1 record 
and a 4.44 earned run average. McEnaney was a key member of the bullpen 
of the 1975 and 1976 World Series champions Big Red Machine. In 1975, he 
posted a 5–2 record with a 2.47 ERA and 15 saves in 70 pitching appearances, 
but he is best known for his performance in the Series, in which he pitched 
five games (6.2 innings) in relief with a 2.70 ERA and one save,[4] moreover 
for his exploits in the deciding Game 7. Entering in the bottom of the 
ninth inning, with the Reds clinging to a 4–3 lead over the Boston Red 
Sox, McEnaney got Juan Beníquez to fly out followed by a Bob Montgomery 
groundout. He then sealed the World Series title and became part of an 
iconic Reds moment as he induced Carl Yastrzemski to hit a flyball to centerfield, 
which was grabbed by César Gerónimo, followed by McEnaney's teammates swarming 
him and celebrating around the pitcher's mound.[5][6] In 1976 he fell to 
2–6 with a 4.85 ERA in 55 games. But he again excelled in the World Series, 
pitching 4.2 scoreless innings in two games and earning two saves.[7] And, 
just as in the previous World Series, he closed out the series with a 1–2–3 
ninth inning, only this time it was for a four-game sweep over the New 
York Yankees.[8] In December 1976 he was traded to the Expos, for whom 
in 1977 he pitched 69 games with a 3–5 record and a 3.95 ERA. He was then 
traded to the Pirates shortly before the 1978 season and pitched only six 
games with a 10.38 ERA. Released by the Pirates, he played for the Cardinals 
in 1979. In that season he pitched in 25 games with an 0–3 record and a 
fine 2.95 ERA, but it was his final season in the majors as the Cardinals 
released him just prior to the 1980 season.[9] For his Major League career 
he compiled 12–17 record with a 3.76 earned run average and 148 strikeouts 
in 269 appearances, all as a relief pitcher. Besides, McEnaney played in 
Mexico with the Águilas de Mexicali and the Plataneros de Tabasco, as well 
as for the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball 
Association. In 1980, while pitching for Mexicali, McEnaney hurled a 1–0 
no-hitter against the Algodoneros de Guasave.[10] McEnaney lives in Florida 
with his second wife, Cindy, and they have two grown sons. He also has 
a daughter from his first marriage. (Lynne Magaw Married 11/10/1973 at

banker, had a painting business, later a bathtub refinishing business for 
12 years and was most recently a salesman at Dick's Sporting Goods while 
working evenings as the scoreboard operator for the Miami Marlins minor
