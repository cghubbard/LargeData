The Washington Nationals are a professional baseball team that has been 
based in Washington, D.C. since 2005. The Nationals are a member of both 
the Major League Baseball's (MLB) National League Eastern Division and 
the National League (NL) itself. Since the 2008 season, the Nationals have 
played in Nationals Park; from 2005 through 2007, the team played in Robert 
F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. The Nationals are the successors to the Montreal 
Expos, who played in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from their inception as 
an expansion team in 1969 through 2004, with the majority of that time 
(1977–2004) spent in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The following takes into 
account both teams, as all Montreal records were carried with the franchise 
when it moved to Washington. The following table describes the Expos′ (1969–2004) 
and Nationals′ (2005–2016) combined regular-season won–lost record by decade.
