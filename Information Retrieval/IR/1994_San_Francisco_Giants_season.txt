The 1994 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 112th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 37th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 35th at Candlestick Park. 
After winning 103 games in 1993, the Giants record dropped to 55-60 in 
a strike-shortened season. This was also the season in which Matt Williams 
hit a career high 43 home runs through 115 games by the time the strike 
hit, on pace to finish with 61; had the season continued, Williams may 
have had a chance to break Roger Maris's then-single season record of 61 
home runs set in 1961. By Friday, August 12, the Giants had compiled a 
55-60 record through 115 games. They had scored 504 runs (4.38 per game) 
and allowed 500 runs (4.35 per game).[3] The Giants were struggling offensively 
prior to the Strike, at 28th in batting average (.249), doubles (159) and 
overall hits (963).[4] Their pitchers also struggled, combining to finish 
28th in complete games, with just 2.[4] The following were notable Giants 
draft picks from the MLB Amateur Draft held on June 2, 1994. Infielders
