Clayton Edward Kershaw (born March 19, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
A left-handed starting pitcher, Kershaw has played in the major leagues 
since 2008, and his career earned run average (ERA) and walks and hits 
per innings pitched average (WHIP) are the lowest among starters in the 
live-ball era with a minimum of 1,000 innings pitched.[1] Kershaw has a 
career hits allowed per nine innings pitched average of 6.64—the second-lowest 
in MLB history—along with three Cy Young Awards and the 2014 National League 
Most Valuable Player Award.[2][3][4] Kershaw was drafted seventh overall 
in the 2006 MLB draft. He worked his way through the Dodgers' farm system 
in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he 
debuted in 2008, he was the youngest player in MLB, a title he held for 
one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National 
League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either 
of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter 
on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed 
strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has 
often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax.[5][6][7] He became 
the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years 
when he did so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.[8] Off the field, Kershaw 
is an active participant in volunteer work. He and his wife, Ellen, launched 
"Kershaw's Challenge" and wrote the book Arise to raise money to build 
an orphanage in Zambia. He has been honored with the Roberto Clemente Award 
and the Branch Rickey Award for his humanitarian work. Kershaw was born 
in Dallas, Texas on March 19, 1988. His parents divorced when he was 10, 
and he was raised by his mother.[9] He played in youth sports leagues as 
a child, including Little League Baseball.[10][11] Kershaw attended nearby 
Highland Park High School, where he played baseball and was also the center 
for quarterback Matthew Stafford on the football varsity.[12] After a growth 
spurt and further development of his pitches, he established himself as 
an elite high school prospect in 2006[12] when he posted a 13–0 record 
with an earned run average (ERA) of 0.77, and recorded 139 strikeouts in 
64 innings pitched. In a playoff game against Northwest High School of 
Justin, Texas, Kershaw pitched an all-strikeout perfect game. He struck 
out all 15 batters he faced in the game, which was shortened because of 
the mercy rule.[13] He also pitched for USA Baseball's Junior National 
Team in the Pan Am Championship.[12] Kershaw was selected by USA Today 
as "High School Baseball Player of the Year", and was also the Gatorade 
National Player of the Year for baseball.[14] Entering the 2006 Major League 
Baseball (MLB) draft, Kershaw was considered the top high-school pitcher 
available.[15][16] The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Kershaw with the seventh 
overall pick in the draft.[17] He had committed to Texas A&M University, 
but turned down the scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers,[12][18] 
with a bonus estimated at $2.3 million. The bonus was the largest to any 
Dodgers draft pick at the time, and was eventually topped by Zach Lee in 
the 2010 draft.[19] Kershaw began his career with the Gulf Coast League 
(GCL) Dodgers. He pitched in 37 innings in which he struck out 54 batters 
(walking only 5), while compiling a record of 2–0 with a 1.95 ERA.[20] 
He featured a fastball that topped out at 96 miles per hour (154 km/h)[21] 
and he was rated as the top prospect in the GCL,[22] and the Dodgers' second 
best prospect by Baseball America behind third baseman Andy LaRoche.[23] 
Kershaw was promoted to the Great Lakes Loons in 2007, where he recorded 
a record of 7–5 with a 2.77 ERA.[24] He was selected to play on the East 
Team in the Midwest League All-Star Game[25] and on the USA team in the 
All-Star Futures Game.[26] On August 6, he was promoted to the Double-A 
Jacksonville Suns in the Southern League,[27] where he produced a 1–2 record 
and 3.65 ERA in five starts[28] and was selected as the top prospect in 
the Dodgers organization heading into the 2008 season.[29] During spring 
training in a game against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention 
for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at 
the end looped into the strike zone and struck him out looking.[30] Kershaw 
was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 1⁄3 innings pitched 
in his first stint of the year with the Suns.[31] He was then called up 
to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 
2.[32] Kershaw pitched 18 innings during his second trip to Jacksonville 
(two starts and one seven inning relief appearance), winning two games. 
During this stretch, he allowed only two runs earned runs, lowering his 
ERA to 1.91. He was recalled on July 22.[33] On May 24, 2008, the Dodgers 
bought Kershaw's minor-league contract, and he was added to the active 
roster.[34] Sportswriter Tony Jackson called Kershaw's debut the most anticipated 
start by a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo's major league debut during 
the 1995 season.[35] He made his debut on May 25, starting against the 
St. Louis Cardinals. He struck out the first batter he faced, Skip Schumaker, 
the first of seven strikeouts in the game, in which he pitched six innings 
and allowed two runs.[36] When he debuted, Kershaw was the youngest player 
in MLB, a title he held for one full year.[37] Kershaw won his first major 
league game against the Washington Nationals on July 27, 2008. He pitched 
six-plus shutout innings, allowing four hits, a walk, and he struck out 
five.[38][39] Kershaw finished his rookie season 5–5, with a 4.26 ERA in 
22 games (21 starts).[40] He also pitched two innings out of the bullpen 
for the Dodgers in the 2008 National League Championship Series (NLCS) 
against the Philadelphia Phillies.[41] On April 15, 2009, Kershaw pitched 
seven innings, striking out 13 batters while allowing only one hit (a solo 
home run) against the rival San Francisco Giants. He was the youngest Dodger 
to ever strikeout 13 or more batters in a game since Sandy Koufax did it 
in the 1955 season.[42] On May 17, 2009, Kershaw did not allow a hit against 
the Florida Marlins through 7 innings, then gave up a lead-off double to 
Florida's Cody Ross.[43] In 2009, despite an 8–8 record, he led the major 
leagues in opposing batting average (.200), opposing slugging percentage 
(.282), and hits per nine innings (6.26). He also posted an ERA of 2.79 
and 185 strikeouts. Kershaw also walked 91 batters, which was second most 
in the National League (NL).[44] Kershaw made his playoff starting debut 
against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2009 National League Division Series 
(NLDS). He went 6 2⁄3 innings, striking out 4, walking 1, and ended up 
getting a no-decision (the Dodgers went on to win the game in the 9th inning).[45] 
At 21 years old, he started the opener of the 2009 NLCS against the Philadelphia 
Phillies and was the third youngest pitcher to ever start a playoff series 
opener, behind only Fernando Valenzuela in the 1981 NLDS and Rick Ankiel 
in the 2000 NLDS.[46] Kershaw started the 2010 season by posting a 3.07 
ERA in April, but did so by walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, 
he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger 
Stadium, throwing just 57 pitches in 1 1⁄3 innings, while retiring only 
four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly 
upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, "I didn't 
give our team any kind of chance. It's just not a good feeling to let your 
teammates down, let everybody down. It stings, it hurts. I've got to figure 
things out."[47] Kershaw rebounded his next start by pitching an 8 inning 
two-hitter and out-dueling the then undefeated Ubaldo Jiménez.[48] He credited 
his control of the slider being the major turning point for him.[49] Later 
in the season, he was suspended for five games after hitting Aaron Rowand 
of the Giants with a pitch in a game on July 20. The incident occurred 
after both teams were given a warning following Giants ace Tim Lincecum 
hitting Matt Kemp earlier in the game.[50] He threw his first career complete 
game shutout on September 14, 2010 also against San Francisco and finished 
the season with a record of 13–10 and a 2.91 ERA in 32 starts, pitching 
204 1⁄3 innings and recording 212 strikeouts.[51] After finishing the 2010 
season strong, the Dodgers named Kershaw as the Opening Day Starter for 
the 2011 season.[52] On May 29, he pitched the second complete-game shutout 
of his career, striking out 10 while winning a two-hitter against the Florida 
Marlins, 8–0; he also had two singles and an RBI, scoring twice in the 
game.[53] He produced his third career shutout on June 20, a two-hit, 11-strikeout 
effort against the Detroit Tigers. Kershaw became the first Dodgers starter 
to strike out the side in the 9th inning since Sandy Koufax's perfect game.[54] 
In his next start, on June 26, Kershaw pitched another complete game (against 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). He became the first Dodger starter 
to have back-to-back complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 
season and the first Dodger to have double-digit strikeouts in consecutive 
starts since Chan-Ho Park in the 2000 season. He was awarded the National 
League Player of the Week award for the week of June 20–26 as a result 
of those two starts.[55] Midway through June, Kershaw had amassed 32 career 
victories, a 3.15 ERA and 593 career strikeouts in 568.2 innings. According 
to the Elias Sports Bureau, Kershaw was the first 23-year-old pitcher to 
have that many victories, an ERA that low and an average of more than one 
strikeout per inning since ERA became an official statistic in 1910.[56] 
Kershaw was selected to the National League team for the 2011 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game, his first All-Star selection.[57] In the month 
of July, Kershaw was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA and NL-leading 45 strikeouts, 
earning him the National League Pitcher of the Month Award.[58] On August 
23, he struck out Matt Holliday of the St. Louis Cardinals for his 200th 
strikeout of the season and became the 10th Dodger pitcher to record back-to-back 
200 strikeout seasons and the first since Chan-Ho Park did it in the 2001 
season.[59] Kershaw finished the 2011 season by leading the NL with 21 
wins, 248 strikeouts and a 2.28 ERA, winning the NL pitching Triple Crown, 
the first Triple Crown winner since Jake Peavy of the 2007 San Diego Padres 
and the first Dodger since Sandy Koufax won it in the 1966 season.[60] 
Justin Verlander of the Detroit Tigers won the American League Triple Crown 
the same season, marking the first major-league season since 1924 to feature 
Triple Crown-winning pitchers in both leagues. Kershaw's 21 wins were the 
most by a Dodger pitcher since Orel Hershiser won 23 during the 1988 season. 
His ERA was the lowest by a Dodger since Hershiser's 2.03 in the 1985 season, 
his strikeouts were the most by a Dodger since Koufax's 317 in 1966 and 
his 233 1⁄3 innings pitched were the most since Chan Ho Park pitched 234 
in 2001.[60] Since 1965 when Koufax did it, Peavy and Kershaw are only 
two pitchers in the National League have led the league in wins, strikeouts, 
ERA, and WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched).[60] Kershaw also became 
just the second lefthander to have a 240-plus strikeouts in a season before 
the age of 24, joining Vida Blue.[60] After the season, Kershaw was awarded 
the Warren Spahn Award as the best left-handed pitcher in 2011,[61] the 
Players Choice Award for Most Outstanding National League pitcher,[62] 
the Gold Glove Award as the top fielding pitcher in the NL [63] and the 
Sporting News (TSN) National League Pitcher of the Year. He was additionally 
selected as the starting pitcher for the TSN NL All-Star Team.[64] On November 
17, he was honored with the National League Cy Young Award, making him 
the youngest Cy Young winner since Dwight Gooden of the 1985 New York Mets. 
He was the 8th Dodger pitcher to win the award, the first since Éric Gagné 
in the 2003 season.[65] On February 7, 2012, Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed 
on a two-year, $19 million contract. The contract was the second highest 
for a player in his first year of arbitration (after Tim Lincecum's $23 
million 2-year contract in 2010).[66] Kershaw was the Dodgers' Opening 
Day starter for the second year in a row, where he pitched three innings 
of shutout ball against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park before being 
removed from the game due to flu-like symptoms.[67] On April 27, he was 
able to last through eight innings for his second win of the season against 
the Washington Nationals. The win was also his 12th straight home win, 
tying him with Ed Roebuck (June 1960 – August 1962) and Orel Hershiser 
(September 1984 – October 1985) for the longest home winning streak since 
the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles.[68] Kershaw won the National League's 
Player of the Week Award for the week of May 14–20 after he made two starts 
during that week and pitched 16 scoreless innings, including his fourth 
career shutout.[69] Kershaw was selected to appear in the 2012 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game, the second straight year he made the team.[70] 
On August 11, he went over 200 innings on the season, becoming the 12th 
Los Angeles Dodger pitcher with three or more seasons of 200 or more innings, 
and the first since Hershiser did it five times from 1985 to 1989.[71] 
Kershaw also became just the fifth Dodger pitcher with three straight 200 
strikeout seasons.[72] Kershaw finished 2012 with a 14–9 record, a 2.53 
ERA (leading the league), 229 strikeouts, and 227 2⁄3 innings pitched, 
coming second in both categories. He became the first pitcher to lead the 
league in ERA in consecutive seasons since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2001–02. 
This was also marked his fourth year in a row with a sub-3.00 ERA, making 
him the first to do this since Randy Johnson from 1999–2002.[73] He finished 
second for the NL Cy Young behind R. A. Dickey, receiving two first place 
votes.[74] Kershaw made his third straight opening day start for the Dodgers 
in the 2013 season, the first Dodger starter to do so since Derek Lowe 
(2005–2007). In that opening day start he pitched a complete game, four 
hit, shutout over the Giants and also hit his first career home run. He 
was the first pitcher to throw a shutout and hit a home run on opening 
day since Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians did so against the Chicago 
White Sox on April 14, 1953.[75] Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout 
on April 17, 2013, when he struck out Yonder Alonso of the Padres. He was 
the second youngest Dodger to reach that mark, behind only Fernando Valenzuela.[76] 
On May 14, Kershaw passed the 1,000 inning mark for his career. His ERA 
of 2.70 at the time was the fifth best of the live-ball era at the 1,000 
inning mark and the best career mark. He also threw 130 pitches that day, 
the most of his career and the most by a Dodger pitcher since Odalis Pérez 
in the 2003 season.[77] Kershaw was selected to the 2013 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, his third straight selection.[78] In July, he compiled a 
4–1 record and 1.34 ERA in six starts and was awarded his second National 
League Pitcher of the Month Award.[79] On September 2, Kershaw picked up 
his 200th strikeout of 2013, joining Hall of Famers Sandy Koufax and Don 
Drysdale as the only starters in Dodgers history with at least 4 consecutive 
seasons of more than 200 strikeouts.[80] Kershaw finished the season with 
a 16-9 record, 236 innings pitched (a career high), and a Major League 
best 1.83 ERA and 0.92 WHIP.[81] He was the third player in history to 
lead the Majors in ERA three years in a row, joining Greg Maddux (1993–95) 
and Lefty Grove (1929–31). His ERA was the first sub-2.00 ERA since Roger 
Clemens did it in the 2005 season and the lowest overall since Pedro Martínez 
in the 2000 season. He was only the third Dodger pitcher to have an ERA 
under 3.00 in five consecutive seasons (Koufax and Nap Rucker).[82] Kershaw 
struck out 12 batters in seven innings in the first game of the 2013 National 
League Division Series. That was the third most strikeouts by a Dodger 
pitcher in the playoffs, behind only Koufax (15 in the 1963 World Series) 
and Carl Erskine (14 in the 1953 World Series). His six straight strikeouts 
in the game tied a MLB postseason record set by Tim Belcher in the second 
game of the 1988 World Series. He picked up his first career postseason 
victory in that game.[83] Kershaw won the Warren Spahn Award for 2013, 
the second time he had won the award, which honors the best left-handed 
pitcher in the Major Leagues.[84] He was also selected to the Sporting 
News NL All-Star team, the fourth Dodger pitcher to be named to the team 
twice (after Koufax, Valenzuela and Don Newcombe).[85] On November 13, 
he won the NL Cy Young Award for the second time in three seasons. He became 
just the sixth pitcher in history to finish in the top two in voting three 
seasons in a row.[86] After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers agreed 
on a seven-year, $215 million, contract extension. The deal was the richest 
in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract 
signed by Justin Verlander the previous year.[87] The average annual value 
of $30.7 million was also the largest ever for a baseball player, beating 
the $28 million Roger Clemens received in 2007 and the 10-year, $275 million 
contract that Alex Rodriguez signed that same year.[88] Kershaw made his 
fourth straight opening day start for the Dodgers in 2014, only the fourth 
Dodger ever to do so. This season the game was played at the Sydney Cricket 
Ground in Australia.[89] Before his second start, Kershaw felt some pain 
in his back and was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his 
career.[90] He did not rejoin the Dodgers until early May.[91] On June 
18, he pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies and 
struck out a career-high 15 batters. The only batter to reach base was 
due to an error in the top of the seventh inning, costing Kershaw a perfect 
game. He is the only pitcher in MLB history with 15 strikeouts in a game 
while allowing no hits and no walks.[92][93] Kershaw was 6-0 with an 0.82 
ERA in June and was awarded with his third career Pitcher of the Month 
award.[94] He was selected to the National League squad at the 2014 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game, his fourth straight selection. He was the 
sixth Dodger pitcher, and the first since Fernando Valenzuela to make the 
All-Star team four years in a row.[95] Kershaw had a 41 inning scoreless 
inning streak that ended in the top of the sixth inning on July 10 when, 
with two outs, Chase Headley homered to left field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's 
streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning 
streak in MLB history.[96] He won the pitcher of the month award again 
in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win 
it two months in a row. He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 
strikeouts and only 10 walks.[97] He picked up his 200th strikeout of the 
season on September 2, the fifth year in a row he had reached that number, 
trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters.[98] 
He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 
200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson 
and Sam McDowell are the others).[99] Kershaw finished the season 21–3 
with a 1.77 ERA in 27 starts. He led the National League in numerous categories 
once again, such as ERA, ERA+, Wins, Win %, WHIP, IP/GS, SO/9, Strikeout-to-walk 
ratio, complete games, FIP, and Wins Above Replacement for both pitchers 
and all NL players. He also finished third in strikeouts despite missing 
most of the first month of the season.[44] He was the first pitcher in 
history to win four consecutive ERA titles.[100] Many experts called his 
2014 season one of the best pitching seasons in recent memory.[99][101][102] 
However, in his first start of the playoffs, in Game 1 of the Division 
Series against the Cardinals, Kershaw became the first pitcher in history 
to strike out 10 while allowing eight runs. He had cruised through the 
first six innings while allowing only two hits (both solo homers) and surrendered 
six runs in the seventh. He did tie Koufax for the only Dodgers pitchers 
with multiple double digit strikeout games in the playoffs. He was also 
the first pitcher in history to give up at least seven runs in back-to-back 
postseason starts (his previous one was Game 6 of the 2013 National League 
Championship Series).[103] Pitching on short rest in Game 4, he would again 
be dominant, but again would take the loss after giving up a 3-run home 
run to Matt Adams in the 7th inning. It was the first home run Kershaw 
had allowed in his career to a left-handed batter off his curveball.[104] 
Kershaw was honored after the season with player of the year awards from 
both The Sporting News[105] and Baseball America.[106] He won three awards 
at the Players Choice Awards including Outstanding NL Pitcher, Player of 
the Year and the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award.[107] He also won 
his third (and second straight) Warren Spahn Award.[108] On November 12, 
he was awarded his third Cy Young Award in four seasons (a unanimous vote).[109] 
The following day, he was elected as the NL MVP, the first National League 
pitcher to win the award since Bob Gibson in 1968 and the first Dodgers 
player to win the award since Kirk Gibson in 1988.[110] Kershaw made his 
fifth straight opening day start in 2015, the first Dodgers pitcher to 
do so since Hall of Famer Don Sutton started seven in a row from 1972 through 
1978.[111] He recorded his 1,500th career strikeout on May 10 when he fanned 
Drew Stubbs of the Colorado Rockies.[112] Kershaw picked up his 100th career 
win on May 15 against the Rockies. He became the 22nd pitcher in franchise 
history and the second youngest active pitcher to reach that mark.[113] 
Kershaw won his sixth career NL player of the week award for the week of 
June 1–7, 2015, when he allowed only two runs on 10 baserunners in 15 innings 
while striking out 18 in two starts that week.[114] Kershaw did not make 
the initial NL roster for the 2015 All-Star Game, though he was included 
on the Final Vote ballot, which he lost to Cardinals pitcher Carlos Martinez. 
However, he was added to the roster to replace Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer, 
who was unavailable due to pitching the Sunday before the game. It became 
his fifth straight all-star selection, joining Sandy Koufax and Fernando 
Valenzuela as the only Dodgers pitchers to accomplish that feat.[115] Kershaw 
struck out a season high 14 batters in eight shutout innings on July 18 
against the Washington Nationals. He became the first Dodgers starter with 
back-to-back games of at least 13 strikeouts since Chan Ho Park in 2000 
and the first Dodgers pitcher with back-to-back games of double-digit strikeouts 
and no walks since Dazzy Vance in 1930.[116] He shared the NL player of 
the week honors with his teammate Zack Greinke for the week of July 13–19[117] 
and won NL pitcher of the month for July.[118] Kershaw picked up his 200th 
strikeout of the season on August 12, tying Hideo Nomo's 1995 season for 
the fastest to that mark in Dodgers history at 156 innings. This was the 
sixth straight 200 strikeout season for Kershaw, tying Sandy Koufax for 
the most in Dodgers franchise history.[119] On October 4, Kershaw became 
the 11th player in Major League history to strike out 300 batters in a 
season, the first player since Randy Johnson did it in 2002.[120] He finished 
the season with a 16–7 record, a 2.13 ERA, and 301 strikeouts in 232 2⁄3 
innings.[44] In Game One of the 2015 National League Division Series, Kershaw 
struck out 11 in 6 2⁄3 innings but allowed three runs for his fifth straight 
postseason loss. He and New York Mets starter Jacob deGrom were the first 
pair of starters to each throw at least 11 strikeouts in the same postseason 
game in MLB history.[121] He rebounded in game four, earning the win on 
three days' rest by allowing one run and three hits against eight strikeouts 
in seven innings on October 13.[122] Kershaw finished third in the National 
League Cy Young Award voting, behind Jake Arrieta and teammate Zack Greinke.[123] 
In mid-December 2015, Kershaw participated in an expedition to Cuba composed 
of MLB officials and players, including former Dodgers manager Joe Torre. 
It was the first visit by MLB since 1999, and one anticipated as an important 
step to help normalize relations with the United States that had begun 
to ease earlier in the year.[124][125] Kershaw made his sixth straight 
opening day start in 2016 as the Dodgers won 15–0. It also marked the first 
time the Dodgers had won six straight opening day games, all of which he 
started.[126] On May 12 against the New York Mets, he struck out 13 while 
pitching a three-hit complete game shutout. He set an MLB record with six 
consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts and no more than one walk 
and a club record with six consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts.[127] 
He picked up his 100th strikeout on May 29, while only walking five batters 
within that period. That was the lowest walk total for a pitcher reaching 
100 strikeouts in the modern era, beating Cliff Lee who had seven walks 
in the 2010 season.[128] On June 30, 2016, Kershaw was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list due to back pain. He received an MRI, which revealed that 
there was a mild herniated disc in the back, and received an epidural injection 
to treat the pain.[129] He was named to the 2016 All-Star team but was 
unable to pitch in the game due to his injury.[130] On July 20, the Dodgers 
shut down Kershaw for an indefinite period of time. He continued to feel 
discomfort in his back after a simulated game.[131] On August 3, Kershaw 
was transferred to the 60-day disabled list.[132] He rejoined the Dodger 
rotation on September 9.[133] He started 21 games in 2016, with a 12–4 
record and 1.69 ERA. He also struck out 172 batters with only 11 walks.[44] 
Kershaw started games one and four of the 2016 National League Division 
Series and picked up the save in the clinching game five. It was his first 
professional save since he was with the Gulf Coast Dodgers in his first 
minor league season in 2006.[134] He next pitched seven shutout innings, 
allowing only two hits, in the second game of the 2016 National League 
Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs.[135] He struggled in game 
six, allowing five runs in five innings to pick up the loss as the Dodgers 
were eliminated from post-season contention.[136] Kershaw's pitching style 
relies on deception. He keeps the ball hidden so that it is hard for the 
batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all 
of his pitches. Out of the windup, Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically 
with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion 
was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a "kickstand 
move" drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle.[137] 
Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the 
base runner at first base to get a read on him.[138] He has stated many 
times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher 
growing up, Roger Clemens.[139] Kershaw's repertoire includes a four-seam 
fastball that sits anywhere from 92 miles per hour (148 km/h) to 95 miles 
per hour (153 km/h) and tops out at 98 miles per hour (158 km/h) with late 
movement, a slider at 84 miles per hour (135 km/h)–87 miles per hour (140 km/h), 
a 12–6 curveball between 72 miles per hour (116 km/h)–76 miles per hour 
(122 km/h), and a seldom thrown changeup (under 3%).[140] As of late in 
the 2015 season, he is believed to be experimenting with the use of a cutter.[141] 
He is also known for having one of the better pickoff moves to first base 
and is considered one of the better fielding pitchers in the game.[142][143] 
According to many teammates, Kershaw is a noted perfectionist.[144] A.J. 
Ellis describes his preparation and perfectionism during bullpens before 
each start: Three fastballs when I'm standing up. I sit, and three fastballs 
down the middle. Then three fastballs either side. Three changeups away. 
Fastball inside. Three curveballs to the middle. Fastball inside. Three 
sliders to the middle. Then he goes to the stretch position. Two fastballs 
inside, two fastballs away, two changeups, one fastball inside, two curveballs, 
one fastball inside, two sliders. Back to the windup, and one fastball 
inside, one fastball away. Thirty-four pitches in all. Notes: Through 2015 
season. Per Baseball-Reference.com. Kershaw grew up in Dallas, Texas and 
attended school with quarterback Matthew Stafford [10] and fellow pitchers 
Jordan Walden [156] and Shawn Tolleson.[157] One of his favorite players 
growing up was former Texas Rangers first baseman Will Clark, and the main 
reason he wears number 22 is to honor Clark.[158] He is the great-nephew 
of astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto.[159] Kershaw's mother, 
born Marianne Tombaugh,[160] is the daughter of Clyde Tombaugh's younger 
brother.[161] His father, Christopher George Kershaw, was a musician and 
won a Clio Award for his work. The elder Kershaw remarried after his divorce 
from Marianne and died in 2013.[162] On December 4, 2010, Kershaw married 
his girlfriend of seven years, Ellen Melson.[163][164] On January 23, 2015, 
Ellen gave birth to the couple's first child, daughter Cali Ann.[165] He 
is a Methodist with strong religious faith.[166][167] Kershaw made a cameo 
appearance in "Prince", a Season 3 episode of New Girl which originally 
aired following FOX's telecast of Super Bowl XLVIII.[168] Prior to the 
2011 season, Kershaw visited Zambia with his wife as part of a Christian 
mission organized by Dallas-based Arise Africa. After the trip, Kershaw 
announced his dream of building an orphanage in Lusaka, Zambia, which he 
called "Hope's Home" after 11-year-old Hope, an HIV-positive child Kershaw 
met while in Zambia. To accomplish his goal, Kershaw pledged a donation 
of $100 per strikeout recorded in 2011. With Kershaw's career high of 248 
strikeouts thrown during the 2011 season, he donated $492,300 toward his 
$70,000 goal. When Kershaw won the 2011 Players Choice Award, he donated 
$260,000 to Hope's Home. He and his wife returned to Zambia in 2012.[169] 
Kershaw donated $100 for every strikeout in the 2012 season to Kershaw's 
Challenge, calling that season's incarnation of the project "Strike Out 
To Serve." Seventy percent of the money raised in 2012 went to Arise Africa, 
with 10 percent each going to the Peacock Foundation in Los Angeles, Mercy 
Street in Dallas, and I Am Second.[170] In 2014, Kershaw continued to support 
the children of Zambia, with partnership with CURE International, raising 
funds to pay for 170 children's surgeries and new medical equipment for 
CURE hospital in Lusaka.[171] Kershaw has continued his partnership with 
CURE International in 2015, setting a goal of funding 100 surgeries for 
CURE's hospital in the Dominican Republic.[172] In addition to Hope's Home 
and Kershaw's Challenge, he has also helped with other programs in Los 
Angeles, such as helping Habitat for Humanity demolish and rehabilitate 
a house in Lynwood, California.[173] He is also a supporter of the Peacock 
Foundation, which provides animal-assisted interventions and activities 
for at risk youth by partnering with mental health practitioners, public 
service agencies and community organizations.[174] Kershaw and his wife, 
Ellen, co-authored a book named Arise: Live Out Your Faith and Dreams on 
Whatever Field You Find Yourself about their Christian faith and their 
humanitarian efforts. The book was released on January 10, 2012 through 
Regal Press.[169] Kershaw is a celebrity endorser for Wilson Sporting Goods
