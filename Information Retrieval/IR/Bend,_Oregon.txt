Bend is a city in, and the county seat of Deschutes County, Oregon, United 
States.[8] It is the principal city of the Bend, Oregon Metropolitan Statistical 
Area. Bend is Central Oregon's largest city, and despite its modest size, 
is the de facto metropolis of the region, owing to the low population density 
of that area. Bend recorded a population of 76,693 at the time of the 2010 
US Census,[9] up from 52,029 at the 2000 census. The estimated population 
of the city as of 2013 is 81,236.[3] Bend's metro population was estimated 
at 165,954 as of July 1, 2013. The Bend MSA is the fifth largest metropolitan 
area in Oregon. Bend is located on the eastern edge of the Cascade Range 
along the Deschutes River. Here the Ponderosa Pine forest transitions into 
the high desert, characterized by arid land, junipers, sagebrush, and bitter-brush. 
Originally a crossing point on the river, settlement began in the early 
1900s. Bend was incorporated as a city in 1905. Economically, it started 
as a logging town but is now identified as a gateway for many outdoor sports, 
including mountain biking, fishing, hiking, camping, rock climbing, white-water 
rafting, skiing, paragliding and golf. In 2015, Men's Journal ranked Bend 
as one of The 10 Best Places to Live Now.[10] The name Bend was derived 
from "Farewell Bend", the designation used by early pioneers to refer to 
the location along the Deschutes River where the town was eventually platted, 
one of the few fordable points along the river. For at least 12,000 years, 
until the winter of 1824, the Bend area was known only to Native Americans 
who hunted and fished there. That year, members of a fur trapping party 
led by Peter Skene Ogden visited the area. John C. Frémont, John Strong 
Newberry, and other Army survey parties came next. Then pioneers heading 
farther west passed through the area and forded the Deschutes River at 
Farewell Bend. Constructed in May 1901, the Pilot Butte Development Company's 
little plant was the first commercial sawmill in Bend. The original location 
was at the rear of the Pilot Butte Inn of later years. Steidl and Reed 
also set up a small mill in Bend in 1903. This was on the Deschutes River 
just below the Pioneer Park area. The mill was operated by water power.[11] 
A small community developed around the area, and in 1904, a city was incorporated 
by a general vote of the community's 300 residents. On January 4, 1905, 
the city held its first official meeting as an incorporated municipality, 
appointing A. H. Goodwillie as the first mayor. The settlement was originally 
called "Farewell Bend", which was later shortened to "Bend" by the U.S. 
Postal Service. In 1910, Mirror Pond was created by the construction of 
the Bend Water, Light & Power Company dam on the Deschutes River in Bend. 
The dam provided the city with its initial source of electricity. The dam 
has been owned by Pacific Power since 1926 and still produces electricity 
that supplies approximately 200 Bend households.[12] In 1916, Deschutes 
County, Oregon was formed from the western half of Crook County and Bend 
was designated as the county seat.[13] In 1929, Bend amended the charter 
and adopted the council-manager form of government. Bend sits on the boundary 
of the Eastern Cascades Slopes and Foothills, a Level III ecoregion designated 
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the U.S. 
states of Oregon, Washington, and California, and the Deschutes River Valley, 
a Level IV ecoregion within the Blue Mountains Level III ecoregion.[14] 
The Deschutes River runs though Bend, where it is dammed to form Mirror 
Pond.[12] Bend's elevation is 3,623 feet (1,104 m).[15] According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 33.27 square 
miles (86.17 km2), of which, 33.01 square miles (85.50 km2) is land and 
0.26 square miles (0.67 km2) is water.[1] Inside the city limits is Pilot 
Butte State Scenic Viewpoint, an old cinder cone. Bend is one of three 
cities in the continental U.S. (with Portland, Oregon and Jackson, Mississippi) 
to have an extinct volcano within its city limits.[16] It is reached by 
U.S. Route 20. A lesser known characteristic of Bend, the Horse Lava Tube 
System enters and borders the eastern edge of the city.[17][18] Just south 
of Bend is Newberry National Volcanic Monument on U.S. Route 97. Bend's 
climate is typical of the high desert with cool nights and sunny days, 
classified as semi-arid (Köppen BSk). Annual precipitation averages 11.2 in 
(280 mm), with an annual average snowfall of 23.8 inches (60.5 cm).[19] 
The winter season in Bend provides a mean temperature of 31.1 °F (−0.5 °C) 
in December.[19] Nighttime temperatures are not much lower than daytime 
highs during the winter. According to the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, 
annually, the lowest nighttime temperature is typically −5 °F (−21 °C) 
to −10 °F (−23 °C).[20] Central Oregon summers are marked by their very 
large diurnal temperature ranges, with a July daily average of 64.5 °F 
(18.1 °C), and an average diurnal temperature variation approaching 35 °F 
(19 °C).[19] Hard frosts are not unheard of during the summer months. Autumn 
usually brings warm, dry days and cooler nights, and Bend is known for 
its annual Indian summer. Bend's growing season is short; according to 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Resources Conservation Service, 
in half of the years between 1971 and 2000, the USDA weather station in 
Bend recorded the last below-freezing temperatures after July 3 and the 
first below-freezing temperatures before August 31.[21] Based on 1981–2010 
normals, the average window for freezing temperatures is September 13 through 
June 19. Max 90 or more Bend is the larger principal city of the Bend-Prineville 
CSA, a Combined Statistical Area that includes the Bend metropolitan area 
(Deschutes County) and the Prineville micropolitan area (Crook County),[25][26][27] 
which had a combined estimated population of 216,310 by the United States

Tourism is one of Bend's largest sectors. The Mount Bachelor ski resort 
brings in tourists from all over Oregon, Washington, and California. The 
nearby Cascade Lakes are also a large draw for tourists. Recreational activities 
include downhill and cross country skiing, hiking, biking, rafting, golfing, 
camping, fishing, picnicking, rock climbing, and general sightseeing. Transient 
room tax revenues through the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 equaled 
$2,221,610.[28] The transient room tax is used in partnership with Visit 
Bend and the Bend Economic Development Advisory Board to convert visitors 
to Bend into residents and business owners.[29] In 2011, Visit Bend reported 
that families are the largest demographic that visit Bend (35%), while 
couples with no children make up the second largest portion (24%) of visitors 
to the city [30] During the same year, tourism generated $570 million and 
employed 16% of the city's workforce.[30] Bend is also home to the Deschutes 
Brewery, the 6th largest craft brewery in the nation and the largest of 
over a dozen microbreweries in the city.[31] Each year the city hosts many 
events celebrating its brewing culture including: The Bend Oktoberfest, 
The Little Woody Barrel Aged Brew and Whiskey Fest, Bend Brewfest, and 
Central Oregon Beer Week. Beer aficionados can also visit many of the breweries 
along the Bend Ale Trail. Since 2004, Bend has also hosted the one of the 
top indie film festivals in the nation The Bend Film Festival.[32] In 2005, 
Bend's economic profile comprised five industry categories: tourism (7,772 
jobs); healthcare and social services (6,062 jobs); professional, scientific 
and technical services (1,893 jobs); wood products manufacturing (1,798 
jobs); and recreation and transportation equipment (1,065 jobs). Much of 
Bend's rapid growth in recent years is also due to its attraction as a 
retirement destination. The rapid population growth has fostered organizations 
such as Central Oregon Landwatch and Oregon Solutions.[33] As of 2014, 
the top 20 private regional (Deschutes, Jefferson, and Crook counties) 
employers[34] were: According to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, in 2005 construction and real estate accounted for 
17.3 percent of all jobs in the Bend metropolitan statistical area (MSA), 
which constitutes all of Deschutes County.[35] This figure is about 70 percent 
more than the proportion of construction and real estate jobs in the Oregon 
and national economies.[36] However, construction activity in Bend appears 
to be slowing - the number of building permit applications received by 
the Bend City Building Division fell from 826 in August 2006 to 533 in 
August 2007, a 35 percent decrease.[37] A large influx of new residents 
drawn by Bend's lifestyle amenities, along with the low interest rates 
and easy lending that fostered a national housing boom in 2001−05, resulted 
in increased activity in Bend's construction and real estate sectors and 
have caused the rate of home price appreciation in Bend to grow substantially 
during that period.[citation needed] Median home prices in the Bend MSA 
increased by over 80% in the 2001−05 period.[38] In June 2006, Money magazine 
named the Bend MSA the fifth most overpriced real estate market in the 
United States.[39] By September 2006, the Bend metro area ranked second 
in the list of most overpriced housing markets, and in June 2007 it was 
named the most overpriced housing market in America.[40][41] The 2008−09 
housing downturn had a strong effect on Bend's housing and economic situation. 
According to the Seattle Times,[42] single-family home prices dropped more 
than 40 percent from a peak of $396,000 in May 2007 to $221,000 in March 
2009. Additional signs of the housing downturn include an April 2009 Deschutes 
county unemployment rate of 12.6 percent and in a tri-county area of Deschutes, 
Crook and Jefferson counties a 66 percent rise in homelessness from 2006 
to 2,237.[42] In May 2010 the Federal Housing and Finance Agency released 
a report in which Bend had the largest price drop in the country, 23 percent, 
from first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010.[43] Bend is home 
to the Bend Elks of the West Coast Collegiate Baseball League. The Elks 
play at historic Vince Genna Stadium. Bend is also the home of the Central 
Oregon Hotshots of the International Basketball League. The Central Oregon 
Steelheaders, continually one of the top teams in the NW conference of 
the Premier Arena Soccer League (PASL), play at the Central Oregon Indoor 
Sports Center in Bend. Bend is the home of the professional cross-country 
ski team XC Oregon, which competes in races locally, regionally, nationally 
and internationally.[44] Bend recently has had success in landing major 
sporting events such as the 2008 and 2009 USA Winter Triathlon National 
Championships, the 2008 and 2009 XTERRA Trail Running National Championships, 
and the 2009 and 2010 United States National Cyclo-cross Championships 
as well as the 2009 and 2010 USA Cycling Elite Road National Championships. 
A popular spot for cycling, Bend has over 300 miles (480 km) of mountain 
bike trails and is the home to the Cascade Cycling Classic, the nation's 
longest running stage race for road bicycle racing. Bend was recently named 
the top mountain bike city in Mountain Bike Action magazine. Bend features 
the Bend Roughriders RFC, a men's division 3 Rugby Football Club.[45] Bend's 
Lava City Roller Dolls became a member of the Women's Flat Track Derby 
Association in April, 2009.[46] Bend's Pole Pedal Paddle is one of the 
Pacific Northwest's premier athletic events. It is a relay race held each 
spring with six legs that include alpine skiing/snowboarding, cross-country 
skiing, biking, running, canoeing/kayaking and sprinting. Bend is also 
home to the Deschutes County Rocks Boxing Team, a USA Boxing Program ran 
by Level III USA Boxing Coach Richard Miller who is also the Golden Gloves 
& Silver Gloves President. February of each year Coach Miller Hosts the 
Oregon State Golden Gloves Boxing Championship at Eagle Crest resort a 
two-day event that highlights the best Olympic bound boxers in the Northwest 
while bringing hundreds of Boxing fans to the area. The Program is non 
profit and raises money for youth in the community.[citation needed] Running 
is also a popular sport in Bend. Bend is home to the Cascade Lakes Relay, 
Bend Beer Chase, Haulin' Aspen Trail Marathon, XTERRA Trail Running National 
Championships, and the Pilot Butte Challenge. The Cascade Lakes Relay is 
the largest sporting event in Central Oregon with over 3000 participants 
each year. One of the largest running clubs in Bend is CORK (central Oregon 
running klub). In 2006 Bend was named the best trail running city by Outside 
magazine,[47] because of 51 miles (82 km) of in-town trails.[48] Runners 
also enjoy parks such as Shevlin, Tumalo Falls, and Deschutes river trail. 
The Bend area is served by Bend–La Pine School District. There are four 
high schools (Bend, Marshall, Mountain View, and Summit), five middle schools, 
(Cascade, High Desert, Pilot Butte, Pacific Crest and Sky View), 12 elementary 
schools, and four magnet schools and one charter school, Bend International 
School. There are several private schools within the area as well, including 
Cascades Academy of Central Oregon, Seven Peaks, Waldorf School of Bend, 
St. Francis of Assisi, Morning Star Christian, and Trinity Lutheran School. 
Central Oregon Community College (COCC) and the OSU-Cascades Campus of 
Oregon State University (OSU) serve the community with both two- and four-year 
programs. The nearest commercial airport is Roberts Field (RDM) in Redmond, 
18 miles (29 km) north. Horizon Airlines, SkyWest Airlines and American 
Airlines (flying as United Express, Delta Connection and American Eagle) 
provide direct service to Portland, Seattle, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco. 
The U.S. Forest Service operates an air base and training center for firefighting, 
and Butler Aircraft, a fixed-base operator, flies DC-4 aircraft for firefighting 
efforts. Bend Municipal Airport (KBDN) is located 5 miles (8.0 km) northeast 
of the city and serves general aviation. Several significant general aviation 
companies are based at Bend Airport, including Precise Flight, which develops 
oxygen systems, speed brakes, landing lights and other modifications for 
general aviation aircraft, and Epic Aircraft. The Bend Hawthorne Transit 
Center is a hub for the Cascades East Transit center with connections to 
intercity bus services including the HighDesert Point, Eastern Point, and 
the Central Oregon Breeze.[50][51] Bend was previously the only metropolitan 
area west of the Mississippi River without a public bus system. A measure 
that would have created a transit district was on the November 2004 ballot, 
but was defeated 53 to 41 percent. As of August 2006, however, funding 
was acquired and the B.A.T. (Bend Area Transit) bus service began on a 
limited basis. Buses have been running since September 27, 2006.[52] During 
the Summer of 2007, not a single bus purchased was in operation (though 
several were due to weak A/C systems) and litigation was underway.[53] 
Bend lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 20 and U.S. Route 97. The latter 
runs on an expressway alignment through the city known as the Bend Parkway; 
a business route for US 97 runs along 3rd Street. The city is also served 
by the Century Drive Highway No. 372 which provides access to Mount Bachelor. 
A BNSF mainline runs north-south through the city; there are numerous spurs 
off of the mainline which serve industrial rail customers. The closest 
Amtrak service is in the town of Chemult, approximately 65 miles (105 km) 
to the south; this station is served by the Coast Starlight route. Bend
