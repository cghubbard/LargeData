Wade Anthony Boggs (born June 15, 1958) is an American former professional 
baseball third baseman. He spent his 18-year baseball career primarily 
with the Boston Red Sox, but also played for the New York Yankees, with 
whom he won the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, and the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays, with whom he reached 3,000 hits. His hitting in the 1980s 
and 1990s made him a perennial contender for American League batting titles. 
He is 33rd on the list of career leaders for batting average among Major 
League Baseball players with a minimum of 1000 plate appearances. Boggs 
was elected to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 2005. With 12 straight All-Star appearances, Boggs is third only 
to Brooks Robinson and George Brett in number of consecutive appearances 
as a third baseman. In 1997, he ranked number 95 on the Sporting News list 
of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[1] and was a nominee for the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team. Boggs, a 1976 graduate of Plant High 
School in Tampa, Florida,[2] currently resides in the Tampa Palms neighborhood 
of Tampa. Born in Omaha, Nebraska,[3] the youngest of three sons of Sue 
and Winfield K. Boggs, Wade had a regimented military upbringing. Winfield 
and Sue met in 1946 at a military base in Georgia. Winfield served with 
the Marines in World War II and flew for the Air Force in the Korean War 
while Sue piloted mail planes in World War II.[4][5] The Boggs family lived 
in several different places (including Puerto Rico and Savannah, Georgia) 
before settling in Tampa, Florida when Wade was 11 years old.[4][5] He 
attended Plant High School in Tampa, where he played baseball and was an 
All-State football player as a senior. Boggs played quarterback until senior 
year when he switched positions to avoid injury and thereby protect his 
baseball career. His success as a left-footed placekicker and punter earned 
him a scholarship offer from the University of South Carolina.[4] He graduated 
from Plant High School in 1976 and was selected by the Boston Red Sox in 
the seventh round of the 1976 MLB draft on the advice of veteran scout 
George Digby. He signed with the club for $7,500.[4] Sue Boggs was killed 
in a car accident during the 1986 season when a cement truck being driven 
by a prisoner on work detail ran a red light and struck her car.[5] Boggs 
played in the longest game in professional baseball history as a member 
of the Pawtucket Red Sox in 1981 against Cal Ripken, Jr. and the Rochester 
Red Wings. "The Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings, two teams from 
the Triple-A International League, played the longest game in professional 
baseball history. It lasted for 33 innings over eight hours and 25 minutes. 
32 innings were played from 18 to 19 April 1981 at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, 
Rhode Island."[6] During his last year in the minor leagues with Pawtucket, 
he led the league with a .335 batting-average, 167 hits, and 41 doubles.[7] 
A left-handed hitter, Boggs won five batting titles starting in 1983. He 
also batted .349 in his rookie year which would have won the batting title, 
but was 121 plate appearances short of the required minimum of 502. From 
1982 to 1988, Boggs hit below .349 only once, hitting .325 in 1984. From 
1983 to 1989, Boggs rattled off seven consecutive seasons in which he collected 
200 or more hits, an American League record for consecutive 200-hit seasons 
that was later matched and surpassed by Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki. Boggs 
also had six seasons with 200 or more hits, 100+ runs and 40+ doubles. 
Although he would not win another batting title after 1988 (his batting 
title that year broke Bill Madlock's Major League record of four by a third 
baseman), he regularly appeared among the league leaders in hitting. In 
1985, Boggs had 72 multi-hit games, a club record. In 1986, Boggs made 
it to the World Series with the Red Sox, but they lost to the New York 
Mets in seven games. He holds the record for batting average at Fenway 
Park, at .369. In 1992, Boggs slumped to .259 – one of only three times 
in his career that he failed to reach .300 – and at the end of the season 
he left the Red Sox, with whom he had spent his entire career to that point. 
He was heavily pursued by two teams: the Los Angeles Dodgers and the arch-rival 
of the Red Sox, the New York Yankees – he chose the Yankees when they added 
the third year to the contract that the Dodgers would not offer. Boggs 
went on to be awarded three straight all-star appearances, had four straight 
.300-plus seasons, and even collected two Gold Glove Awards for his defense. 
In 1996, Boggs helped the Yankees win their first World Series title in 
18 years, which became his only world title. In the series' fourth game, 
which saw the Yankees rally from six runs down to win, Boggs was called 
on to pinch hit in the tenth inning and using the batting eye he was known 
for throughout his career, he coaxed a bases-loaded walk out of Steve Avery 
which gave the Yankees the lead in a game they went on to win 8–6.[8] After 
the Yankees won the series in game 6, Boggs memorably celebrated by jumping 
on the back of an NYPD horse, touring the field with his index finger in 
the air – despite his self-professed fear of horses.[9][10] Boggs signed 
with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the final two seasons of his career. 
He hit the first home run in Devil Rays history, in the 6th inning of the 
inaugural game on March 31, 1998. On August 7, 1999, he collected his 3,000th 
hit with a home run. Despite his reputation as a singles hitter with limited 
power, he is one of only three players whose 3,000th hit was a home run,[11] 
followed by Derek Jeter on July 9, 2011 and Alex Rodriguez on June 19, 
2015. Boggs retired in 1999 after sustaining a knee injury, leaving with 
a career batting average of .328 and 3,010 hits. Two yellow seats among 
the rest of the Tropicana's blue seats mark where both historic balls landed 
in right field, each with a small metal plate noting it as the area that 
the ball landed. His career paralleled that of Tony Gwynn, who also debuted 
(in the National League) in 1982. Boggs and Gwynn were the premier contact 
hitters of their era. They both won multiple batting titles—Boggs's five 
and Gwynn's eight—and each won four straight to join Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, 
and Rod Carew as the only players to do so. Gwynn and Boggs each hit over 
.350 in four straight seasons, the only players to do so since 1931. They 
joined Lou Brock and Rod Carew as the only players whose careers ended 
after World War II who finished with 3,000 hits and fewer than 160 home 
runs.[12][13] Boggs recorded one inning pitching at the Major League level. 
His main pitch was a knuckleball, which he used 16 times (along with one 
fastball) in one shutout inning for the Yankees against the Anaheim Angels 
in a 1997 game.[14] On December 21, 2015, the Red Sox announced that they 
would retire Boggs's number (26).[15] The ceremony was held on May 26, 
2016.[16] Boggs occasionally appears in the Yankees' annual Old-Timers' 
Day, a celebration of past Yankees in which the players play a multi-inning 
game of baseball at Yankee Stadium.[17] His own style included mental preparedness 
techniques, which consisted in visualizing four at-bats each evening before 
a game and imagining himself successfully getting four hits. As of June 
8, 1986, over the course of the previous 162 games (equivalent to a full 
season, though across two seasons) Boggs was hitting .400, with 254 hits 
in 635 at-bats.[18] In 1987, Boggs – who was up for a new contract following 
the season – hit 24 home runs, the most in any year of his career. The 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays retired his #12 On April 7, 2000. It is the only number 
to have been issued only once by the Rays.[19] The Boston Red Sox inducted 
Boggs into the team's Hall of Fame in 2004[20] and his number 26 was retired 
during a pre-game ceremony on May 26, 2016.[21] Boggs was known for his 
superstitions. He ate chicken before every game (Jim Rice once called Boggs 
"chicken man"), woke up at the same time every day, took exactly 117 ground 
balls in pre-game practice, took batting practice at 5:17 pm, and ran sprints 
at 7:17 pm, to increase his chances of "going 7-for-7".[clarification needed][11][22] 
His route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home 
dugout. He drew the Hebrew word "Chai", meaning "life", in the batter's 
box before each at-bat, though he is not Jewish.[23] He asked Fenway Park 
public address announcer Sherm Feller not to say his uniform number when 
he introduced him because Boggs once broke out of a slump on a day when 
Feller forgot to announce his number.[24] Boggs garnered non-baseball related 
media attention in 1989 for his four-year extramarital affair with Margo 
Adams, a California mortgage broker. After Boggs ended the relationship 
in 1988, Adams filed a $12 million lawsuit for emotional distress and breach 
of oral contract. She argued that Boggs had verbally agreed to compensate 
her for lost income and services performed while accompanying Boggs on 
road trips.[26] Boggs' reputation was further sullied when Adams agreed 
to an interview with Penthouse magazine in which she discussed intimate 
details of her time with Boggs.[27] While acknowledging the affair, Boggs 
went on the offensive in order to combat the wave of negative press, denying 
many of the claims made by Adams. Boggs' rebuttal included an appearance 
on the ABC program 20/20 in which he presented his side of the story to 
Barbara Walters.[28] In February 1989, an appeals court threw out $11.5 
million of the initial lawsuit, ruling that Adams could not seek compensation 
for emotional distress.[29] The remaining demand for $500,000 was settled 
out of court later that year for an undisclosed amount.[30] Before his 
retirement, Boggs was plagued by newspaper reports that the expansion Devil 
Rays gave him financial compensation in return for selecting a Devil Rays 
cap for his plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame, though he has denied that 
any such condition was part of his contract.[31] In light of those reports 
(and other rumors that teams were offering number retirement, money, or 
organizational jobs in exchange for the cap designation) the Hall decided 
in 2001 to change its practice of deferring to players' wishes regarding 
cap logo selection, and reinforced the Hall's authority to determine with 
which cap the player would be depicted. Boggs is wearing a Boston cap on 
his plaque. Boggs' mother died in June 1986 due to a car accident in Tampa 
while he was with the Red Sox.[32] Shortly after her death, Boggs and his 
father bought a fish camp on U.S. 301 just south of Hawthorne, Florida, 
that they named Finway; his father operated it until shortly before he 
died.[33] Wade and his wife Debbie have two children, Brett and Meagann.[34] 
Wade Boggs was named one of the Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by Men's 
Fitness.[35] As a baseball player, Boggs made an appearance for the professional 
wrestling promotion World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1988. He appeared 
in a vignette with wrestler Mr. Perfect (Curt Hennig) in which Perfect 
played baseball. The two remained good friends afterward and 19 years later 
in 2007, Boggs inducted the late Perfect into the WWE Hall of Fame. In 
the DVD The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect, Boggs related how Hennig saved 
his life, carrying Boggs to help after he had severely cut his leg climbing 
over a broken barbed wire fence during a hunting trip.[36] Boggs was one 
of the baseball players featured in the classic The Simpsons episode "Homer 
at the Bat", in which he was recruited as a ringer by Mr. Burns for the 
Power Plant's softball team, only to later be knocked out in a bar fight 
(over whether Lord Palmerston or Pitt the Elder was the United Kingdom's 
greatest Prime Minister) by Barney Gumble. Boggs appeared as himself in 
the episode "Bar Wars" of Cheers, in which he was sent to the bar as an 
apology by a rival bar. He was accosted by the regulars who thought he 
was a fake. David Levine revealed in 2009 that Boggs had promised to trade 
Adams' panties for Kirstie Alley's.[37] In Seinfeld's "The Chaperone", 
George convinces the Yankees to switch to cotton uniforms, assuring manager 
Buck Showalter that the Bombers would be "five degrees cooler than the 
other team." Wade Boggs was quoted as saying: 'What a fabric! Finally we 
can breathe.'[38] In 2011, he also appeared in the Psych episode "Dead 
Man's Curveball". In 2015, Boggs guest starred in the Season 10 premiere 
of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia where characters in the show tried 
to drink over 70 beers while flying across country: allegedly emulating 
a feat Boggs once accomplished during his career.[39] Boggs denied that 
the number of beers was 64, and he reportedly told Charlie Day that he 
drank 107 beers in a day.[40] Former Red Sox pitcher Oil Can Boyd was on 
a book tour to promote his new autobiography and was on the Dennis and 
Callahan show on WEEI-FM, when he claimed that Boggs was a bigot and would 
call him the n-word every day to his face in the clubhouse.[41] Boggs vehemently 
disputed the claims, asserting "Absolutely, positively, 100 million percent, 
I am not a racist. I am not a bigot."[41] Referring to Boyd, who has admitted 
to frequently using cocaine and marijuana, Boggs noted, "You have a delusional 
drug addict who let not only his family down, but his team, the city of 
Boston, Red Sox Nation when it counted most. Now he wants the good people 
of Boston to go out and spend money on this garbage to support his habit.
