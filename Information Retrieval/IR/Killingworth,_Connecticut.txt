Eastern Killingworth is a town in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United 
States. The town's name can easily be confused with another Connecticut 
town, Killingly; or a Vermont ski area, Killington. The population was 
6,018 at the 2000 census. Killingworth was established from the area called 
Hammonasset, taken from the local Native American tribe of the same name. 
The area originally incorporated the town of Clinton, which were separated 
along ecclesiastical borders.[2][3] Part of New London County prior to 
May 1785, Killingworth was then included in the newly formed Middlesex 
County, where it remains today. It was named after Kenilworth, England 
in honor of one of the first settlers, Edward Griswold.[3] Kenilworth's 
name was more similar to "Killingworth" during the American colonial period, 
and over time the pronunciation and spelling drifted towards the modern 
one.[2] Coincidentally, there is a town and village in England called Killingworth 
and Killingworth Village in the county of Tyne and Wear, which do not seem 
to have any connection with Killingworth, Connecticut. In the late 17th 
century, Killingworth became the birthplace of what would eventually become 
Yale University. The Rev. Abraham Pierson, the college's first president, 
taught some of the first classes in his Killingworth home - which is actually 
in present-day Clinton, Connecticut. However, in 1701, the college's first 
official home was constructed in Old Saybrook on the peninsula known as 
Saybrook Point. Eventually the school was moved to its present-day home 
in New Haven.[4] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town 
has an area of 35.8 square miles (93 km2). Of this total, 35.3 square miles 
(91 km2) is dry land and 0.5 square miles (1.3 km2) – or 1.34% – is water-covered. 
Killingworth also contains Chatfield Hollow State Park. As of the census[7] 
of 2000, there were 6,018 people, 2,196 households, and 1,765 families 
residing in the town. The population density was 170.3 people per square

64.6 per square mile (24.9/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 97.54% 
White, 0.42% African American, 0.07% Native American, 0.83% Asian, 0.25% 
from other races, and 0.90% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 1.18% of the population. There were 2,196 households out 
of which 38.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 73.8% 
were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 19.6% were non-families. 16.1% of all households

Males had a median income of $61,650 versus $38,289 for females. The per

the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens 
and 1.4% of those over 64. Killingworth is governed by a Board of Selectmen, 
currently headed by First Selectman, Democrat Cathy Iino, with Fred Dudek 
and Louis Annino Jr also on the board.[9] Students attending school in 
Killingworth are a part of Connecticut's Regional School District #17, 
which consists of Haddam and its villages of Haddam Neck (located on the 
eastern bank of the Connecticut River) and Higganum. The high school is 
called Haddam-Killingworth High School (often abbreviated as simply "HK"), 
and is located in Higganum. The school's sports teams are called the 'Cougars'. 
A new middle-school, named Haddam Killingworth Middle School or "HKMS", 
built in 2006 in Killingworth, houses grades 5 through 8. The Estuary Transit 
District provides public transportation throughout Killingworth and the 
surrounding towns through its 9 Town Transit Service. Services include 
connections to the Old Saybrook Train Station, served by Amtrak and Shoreline 
East railroads. The town was the subject of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 
poem "The Birds of Killingworth" published in Tales of a Wayside Inn. 1999:
