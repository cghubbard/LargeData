Sergio Francisco Romo (born March 4, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played for the San Francisco 
Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Giants 
in 2008. As a closer for the Giants, he recorded three saves during the 
2012 World Series, helping the Giants win the title.[1] During the playoffs, 
he had saves in the clinching games of the NL Division Series and the World 
Series. Romo was born in Brawley, California to Mexican parents.[2] His 
grandfather and father both played baseball; his grandfather was a member 
of the Mexico City Diablos Rojos. Frank, Sergio's father, built a pitching 
mound in the backyard and taught Romo how to throw.[3] He graduated from 
Brawley Union High School in 2001,[3] having played shortstop and third 
base on the baseball team.[4] With no scholarship offers from four-year 
colleges,[5] Romo nearly signed enlistment papers to follow his father 
in the U.S. Navy, but opted to play baseball at junior college instead.[6] 
Romo first went to Orange Coast College before transferring to Arizona 
Western College. Romo was named to the All-Region I second team of the 
Arizona Community College Athletic Conference in 2002 and 2003. In 159 
innings, Romo earned a 16-4 overall record with a 2.79 earned run average 
(ERA).[7] For his junior and senior years, Romo played NCAA Division II 
baseball at two colleges: the University of North Alabama (2004) and Mesa 
State College (2005).[8] He was named First-Team All-Gulf South Conference 
in 2004 while playing for North Alabama and was 10-3 with a 3.69 ERA in 
97.1 innings.[8] In his senior year with Mesa State, he was the Rocky Mountain 
Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year.[9] In 2009, the RMAC named Romo 
"All-Time Top Pitcher."[10] Romo was drafted by the Giants in the 28th 
round (852nd overall) of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft.[11] He began 
his professional career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A 
short season Northwest League. Used as a starter, he had a 7–1 record and 
a 2.75 ERA in 68 2⁄3 innings. His seven wins led the Northwest League, 
while his 65 strikeouts ranked ninth.[12] The following year, Romo was 
assigned to the Augusta GreenJackets of the Single-A South Atlantic League. 
In 31 games (10 starts) he had a 10–2 record, a 2.53 ERA, 95 strikeouts, 
and four saves in 103 1⁄3 innings. He made 41 relief appearances for the 
San Jose Giants of the Single-A advanced California League in 2007, compiling 
a 6–2 record, a 1.36 ERA, 106 strikeouts, and nine saves in 66 1⁄3 innings 
of work.[13] Romo's 14.38 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched was the fourth-best 
mark in the minors, and milb.com named Romo the Class A Advanced Relief 
Pitcher of the Year.[14] Aided by his contributions, San Jose won the California 
League championship.[15] Romo began the 2008 season with the Double-A Connecticut 
Defenders of the Eastern League. Used as the closer, he had 11 saves in 
27 games, although his ERA was 4.00.[13] Romo had his contract purchased 
by the San Francisco Giants on June 24, 2008, when Vinnie Chulk was designated 
for assignment.[16] He made his big league debut on June 26, 2008, in a 
4–1 loss to the Cleveland Indians, striking out two in an inning pitched.[17] 
Romo posted a 2.35 ERA in his first 15 games but was designated for assignment 
on August 6, because the Giants were adding up two relief pitchers. Romo 
was on trade waivers at the time and thus could not be optioned to the 
minors.[18] He was eventually sent to the minors, but was recalled on August 
16, when Jonathan Sánchez was placed on the disabled list. Romo replaced 
Matt Palmer in the bullpen as Palmer took Sánchez's rotation spot.[19] 
During the 2008 season, Romo dominated left-handed hitters, which is unusual 
for a right-handed pitcher.[20] In 29 games as a rookie, Romo had a 3–1 
record, a 2.12 ERA, 33 strikeouts, and eight walks in 34 innings.[14] He 
played winter baseball with the Águilas de Mexicali of the Mexican Pacific 
League. In nine relief appearances, Romo made six of seven attempted saves 
and posted a 2.89 ERA.[21] Romo started the 2009 season on the disabled 
list with a right elbow sprain, and was activated on May 30, 2009. From 
June 5 through June 20, he threw 7 2⁄3 scoreless innings, allowing just 
two hits. He picked up wins on both June 19 and 20, against the Texas Rangers.[14] 
He completed his first major league save on July 7 against the Florida 
Marlins. He got the last two outs of the game, both of which were via the 
strikeout.[22] Romo had a 2.31 ERA through July 11, but in four games between 
July 11 and 20, he gave up seven runs in two innings, raising his ERA to 
6.59. He then had a 2.21 ERA in his final 27 games, which brought his ERA 
down to 3.97 at the end of the year. In 45 games, he had a 5–2 record, 
41 strikeouts, and 11 walks in 34 innings. He was one of eight NL relievers 
to allow one or fewer home runs. Romo also stranded 92.9% of inherited 
runners, second in the NL to Juan Rincón's 95%.[14] Romo got off to a tough 
start to the 2010 season, posting a 4.50 ERA through his first 14 games 
and losing three of them. Starting May 9, he posted a 1.50 ERA in his final 
54 games of the year. In mid-June, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy removed 
the struggling Guillermo Mota from the setup role and replaced him with 
Romo, who held it for the rest of the regular season.[23][24] Romo gained 
notoriety for being one of the team's "Beards", along with LHP Jeremy Affeldt 
and closer Brian Wilson.[25] In 68 games (second to Wilson on the Giants), 
Romo had a 5–3 record, a 2.18 ERA, 70 strikeouts, and 14 walks in 62 innings. 
This year, he held right-handed batters to a .185 average. His 5.00 strikeout-to-walk 
ratio ranked sixth among NL relievers, and his 2.18 ERA ranked 10th.[14] 
In Game 2 of the National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta 
Braves, Romo gave up two hits without recording an out; both runners scored 
as the Giants went on to blow a three-run lead and lose 5–4 in 11 innings.[26] 
Romo replaced Sánchez in the eighth inning of Game 3 and allowed a go-ahead 
two-run home run to Eric Hinske but was charged with the win as the Giants 
rallied in the ninth to win 3–2.[27] The Giants won the series in four 
games.[28] In Game 4 of the NL Championship Series (NLCS) against the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Romo gave up an RBI double to Jayson Werth and was charged with 
a blown save, but the Giants won 6–5.[29] He held the Phillies scoreless 
in his other two outings of the series (losses in Games 2 and 5), and the 
Giants won the series in six games.[30][31] Romo made one appearance in 
the World Series against the Texas Rangers, throwing 2⁄3 of a scoreless 
eighth inning in the Giants' 11–7 victory.[32] Romo earned his first World 
Series ring as the Giants won the series in five games to win their first 
title since 1954.[33] In 2011, Romo became the fifth reliever in MLB history 
to throw nine or more consecutive perfect innings, retiring thirty straight 
batters in 10 innings over a span of fourteen games from July 4 through 
August 6.[14] From August 16 through August 28, he was on the disabled 
list with right elbow inflammation.[34][35] From June 30 through September 
23, he had the longest scoreless streak of his career, throwing 21 2⁄3 
scorless innings. Romo appeared in 65 games in 2011; his stat line for 
the year was: 3–1 record, 1.50 ERA, 70 strikeouts, five walks, 13.1 K/9, 
and .9 BB/9 in 48 innings. His ERA was the third-lowest among NL relievers, 
and his strikeout-to-walk ratio of 14:1 was the best in MLB and the best 
ever since Dennis Eckersley's 18.25:1 ratio in 1990. He stranded 81.8% 
of runners (fifth in the NL) and trailed only Kris Medlen in strike percentage 
(71%) among NL pitchers with at least 20 innings pitched.[14] Romo performed 
very well to begin the 2012 season and did not allow an earned run until 
May 17, 2012. After Brian Wilson underwent Tommy John surgery in April, 
Santiago Casilla was given the closer role. Casilla blew five out of ten 
saves entering August, however; Bochy announced on August 7 that the Giants 
would use a "bullpen by committee" strategy, with Romo Javier López, and 
Jeremy Affeldt pitching the final two innings of close games, depending 
on which hitters they would be facing.[36] Romo and López received most 
of the save opportunities; Affeldt only had one save after that point.[37][38][39] 
From then through the end of the season, Romo converted nine out of nine 
save opportunities and posted a 1.33 ERA.[38] Romo appeared in 69 games 
of the 2012 season, earning 14 saves with a 1.79 ERA, which was fourth 
among NL relievers and trailed only Craig Kimbrel (1.01), Aroldis Chapman 
(1.51) and Eric O'Flaherty (1.73).[14] The Giants won the NL West; in the 
NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds, Romo appeared in three games, winning 
Game 2 and saving Game 5. He pitched in all four of the Giants' wins in 
the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals but did not get a single save 
opportunity. However, in the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, he 
made three appearances and recorded the save in each of them.[30] He pitched 
the final inning of the deciding Game 4 and struck out three straight, 
including Miguel Cabrera for the last out and the Giants' win.[40] In the 
Series, Romo pitched three perfect innings and had five strikeouts.[14] 
In February 2013, Romo and the Giants agreed to a two-year, $9 million 
contract.[41] Romo began the 2013 season as the Giants' closer. He had 
10 saves in April, second in Giants' history for the month to Rod Beck 
(11).[14] On July 14, he was added to the NL All Star Game roster after 
Jeff Locke and Jordan Zimmermann made starts on Sunday and became ineligible 
to pitch. It was the first All-Star selection of his career.[42] However, 
Romo was not used in the All-Star Game.[43] In August, Romo converted all 
nine of his save opportunities.[14] Romo finished the 2013 season with 
a 2.54 earned run average and 38 saves in 43 chances, appearing in 65 games. 
He had a career-high five wins but also a career-high eight losses.[14] 
His 38 saves made him the sixth Giant to achieve 30 saves in a season and 
tied him for third in the league with Chapman, behind Kimbrel's 50 and 
Rafael Soriano's 43.[14][44] Romo began the 2014 season well, with a 1.65 
ERA and 12 saves through May 9. However, Romo struggled after that, recording 
five blown saves and a 9.00 ERA from May 9 to June 30. Romo was removed 
from the closer role on that date, with the Giants announcing their intention 
to go to a closer-by-committee.[45] Used as the eighth inning setup man 
for the remainder of the season, Romo appeared 30 times after July 1 and 
had a 2.10 ERA over 25 2⁄3 innings with 32 strikeouts and 5 walks.[46] 
He finished the year 6–4 with a 3.72 ERA, 59 strikeouts in 58 innings, 
and 12 walks over 64 games. In save opportunities, he was 23 for 28.[14] 
In the 2014 NLDS against the Washington Nationals, Romo pitched three scoreless 
innings over three games.[30] He took the loss in Game 2 of the NLCS against 
the Cardinals after allowing a game-ending home run to Kolten Wong.[47] 
He recovered to earn the win in Game 3 by retiring Matt Holliday as the 
Giants won in extra innings.[48] In the 2014 World Series, Romo appeared 
in two games, pitching 2 1⁄3 innings with 4 strikeouts and no runs allowed, 
earning his third World Series championship with the Giants.[49] On December 
22, 2014, Romo and the Giants finalized a two-year contract worth $15 million.[50][51] 
On August 30 at AT&T Park against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Romo came into 
his five-hundredth career game, becoming the fifth Giants pitcher in franchise 
history to appear in at least five hundred games. With a low-three quarters 
delivery Romo features three pitches: a slider that sits 75-79 mph which 
he uses against right handed batters, a two seam fastball sitting 88-90, 
and a change up which he uses against left handed hitters, sitting 80-83. 
Romo possesses the ability to analyze and correct his own mistakes, which 
he has done since his rookie season. After one game in 2008, Romo, while 
watching video, noted he had been leaning over more than usual in the game. 
He said, "I felt like I was overcorrecting just a little bit", and worried 
that this affected his pitch command.[20] Through 2013, Romo led all post-integration 
MLB pitchers in lowest career FIP with a minimum of 250 innings pitched. 
His career 2.24 ERA was second only to Mariano Rivera.[52] Sergio had his 
first child, a boy, Rilen Serge Romo, in January 2006, followed by his 
second son, Rex Ryder Romo, in September 2011. Brown, Daniel (September 
26, 2014). "Giants' Sergio Romo inspired a teen girl to keep fighting."
