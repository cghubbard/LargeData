Thomas Joseph Thevenow (September 6, 1903 in Madison, Indiana – July 29, 
1957 in Madison, Indiana) was a professional baseball player who played 
shortstop in the Major Leagues from 1924 to 1938. He played for the [St. 
Louis Cardinals]], Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati 
Reds, and Boston Bees during his career. Thevenow epitomized the good-fielding 
/ weak-hitting shortstops that prevailed in the era, ending his career 
with a fielding percentage of .947, but a batting average of .248 while 
hitting only two home runs in his 15-year career. He hit two home runs 
in 1926, both inside-the-park home runs, and then never hit another home 
run in his next 12 seasons, setting a major league record of 3,347 consecutive 
at bats without a home run.[1][2] Thevenow was acquired by the Cardinals 
on September 3, 1924, when he was purchased from the Syracuse Stars of 
the Class AA International League, where he played 140 games that season.[3][4] 
He played 23 games for the Cardinals that season, debuting on September 
4 and finishing the season with a batting average of .202. He played 50 
games with St. Louis in 1925, concluding the season with a .269 average, 
in addition to 112 games played for Syracuse.[3][4] During the 1926 season, 
Thevenow hit the first home run of his major league career on September 
17 off Reds pitcher Jack Knight, an inside-the-park homer that was part 
of 10–1 win over the fading Cincinnati Reds, who would lose seven of their 
last nine games down the stretch. Five days later, Thevenow would hit another 
inside-the-park home run, the second and final regular season home run 
of his career, as the Cardinals beat the Brooklyn Dodgers by a score of 
15–7, putting the Cardinals 2½ games ahead of the Reds for first place 
in the National League.[5] Over the rest of the 1926 season and the next 
12 years of his major league career, Thevenow would not hit another home 
run (his final 3,347 at-bats), the most consecutive at bats without a home 
run in major league history.[6] He finished the 1926 season with a .256 
batting average and came in fourth in balloting for that season's National 
League Most Valuable Player, an award won by teammate Bob O'Farrell.[3] 
The Cardinals won the NL pennant and faced the New York Yankees in the 
1926 World Series. In the second game of the series, Thevenow hit a ball 
to right field off Yankee pitcher Sad Sam Jones which Babe Ruth could not 
corral as he ran towards the ball at full speed, while Thevenow rounded 
the bases and scored ahead of Ruth's throw to the plate, with the official 
scorer ruling it an inside-the-park home run. Thevenow would go on to get 
10 hits in 24 at-bats for a .417 batting average, leading the Cardinals 
to win the series in seven games.[6] Thevenow's hitting dropped below the 
Mendoza Line in 1927, with an average of .194 in 59 games. He picked it 
up a bit in 1928, ending the season having played 69 games and finishing 
with a .205 batting average. Following the season, the Cardinals traded 
him to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for shortstop Heinie Sand 
and $10,000.[3] Thevenow died at age 53 on July 29, 1957, due to a cerebral 
hemorrhage. He had operated a grocery store in his hometown of Madison,
