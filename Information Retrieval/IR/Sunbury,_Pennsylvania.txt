Sunbury /ˈsʌnbɛri/ is a city in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, United 
States. It is on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, just downstream 
of the confluence of its main and west branches. It dates to the early 
18th century and is the county seat of Northumberland County.[2] Thomas 
Edison features in the town's history, and the historic Edison Hotel was 
renamed in his honor. Other historic sites include the Beck House, Northumberland 
County Courthouse, and Sunbury Historic District, all listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places.[3] Sunbury is the principal city in the Sunbury, 
PA Micropolitan Statistical Area and one of three principal cities in the 
Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area. Sunbury's population 
was 9,905 at the 2010 census. The first human settlement of Sunbury was 
probably Shawnee migrants.[4] A large population of Delaware Indians was 
also forcibly resettled there in the early 18th century after they lost 
rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canasatego of the Six Nations, 
enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor 
of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the 
Susquehanna River, one of which was present-day Sunbury.[4] From 1727 to 
1756, Sunbury was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements 
in Pennsylvania.[4] At that time, it was known as Shamokin, not to be confused 
with the present-day city of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, which is located to 
the east. In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the 
city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and 
on an island, as well. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, 
half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.[5] In 1754, 
much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations 
to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold 
and was reserved by the Six Nations, "to settle such of our Nations as 
shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in 
our Alliance."[6] According to Weslager, "the Pennsylvania authorities 
had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from 
the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as 
Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other 
Indians who might be placed there--constituted a buffer against Connecticut."[6] 
The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware 
Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part 
of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin 
in 1755 left them without provisions.[7] However, the Delaware Indians 
at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the 
Gnadenhutten massacre in 1755.[8] Pennsylvania Fort Augusta was built in 
1756 at Shamokin. Read more about early history of Sunbury in Shamokin 
(village). On March 21, 1772, Northumberland County was incorporated and 
subdivided.[9] The settlement of Shamokin was renamed Sunbury that same 
year, and the present-day city of Sunbury identifies 1772 as the date of 
its establishment.[10] It was named after Sunbury-on-Thames, a town in 
the Surrey borough of Spelthorne, England, just outside Greater London. 
Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart and of Salieri, lived in Sunbury 
for some years after his arrival in America. Thomas Edison installed the 
first successful three-wire electric lighting system in July 1883 at what 
was then known as the City Hotel. At the city's 150th anniversary celebration 
in 1922, it was renamed the Edison Hotel.[11] Sunbury is at 40°51′50″N 
76°47′21″W﻿ / ﻿40.86389°N 76.78917°W﻿ / 40.86389; -76.78917 (40.863894, 
-76.789174).[12] It is located at the point where the west and north branches 
of the Susquehanna converge.[10] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2), of which 
2.1 square miles (5.4 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) 
of it (1.40%) is covered by water. Sunbury is the largest principal city

class. Pennsylvania third-class cities are municipalities with a population 
of at least 10,000 (at one time), but fewer than 80,000 residents. The 
city operates under a commission form of government, with a mayor and four 
councilmen. The mayor is a member and serves as president of the council. 
All third-class cities are governed by the Third Class City Code. Each 
councilman and mayor is in charge of one of the city’s major departments. 
The current mayor is David Persing. These officials and the controller 
and treasurer are elected at-large for four-year terms. Appointments of 
all other city officers and employees are made by the council. The current 
members of city council are James Eister, Richard Reichner, Dale Henry, 
and Beth Kremer. The goals of these members are to enact legislation for 
the ethical operation of the city government, to assist in the planning 
of the city's revitalization and future, and to maintain discussions with 
the city administration and residents to ensure a smooth and efficient 
government to govern.[18] The police department is without a chief of police. 
Only assistant chief Miller and a handful of officers. The Sunbury Municipal 
Authority manages the following services for residents, businesses, and 
industries of the Sunbury and parts of Upper Augusta: drinking water, wastewater, 
flood control, recycling (for a fee), and the Municipal Transfer Station 
for large rubbish. Residents may bring their trash there for disposal for 
a per-bag or by-weight fee. In July 2007, the city council voted to begin 
a program aimed at dealing with blighted properties. Initially, the program 
will address seven properties. The properties will be demolished at the 
taxpayer's expense and put to public use.[19] The city is in the 108th 
District Pennsylvania House of Representatives and the 27th district of 
the Pennsylvania Senate in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. With regard

on three years of Pennsylvania System of Student Assessment test scores.[22] 
The Shikellamy School Board set the budget at $34.62 million for 2007-2008. 
The board levies taxes to support its programs. These include 62.5 mills 
real estate tax in 2007.[23] Per capita taxes are $5 per resident. An earned 
income tax of one-half of 1 percent of income yields a revenue of approximately 
$1.8 million. Additionally, the real estate transfer tax of one-half percent 
(Nothumberland borough, Point Township, Rockefeller Township) and one percent 
(Snydertown borough) is levied on real estate transfers.[24] Voters rejected 
a tax referendum in May 2007 which would have increased local earned income 
tax by 0.5% to reduce property taxes for homeowners and farmers by $176.[25]

The Northumberland County Historical Society maintains the Charlotte Darrah 
Walter Genealogical Library. It contains material on local history along 
with thousands of records of early families from Northumberland County 
and surrounding counties. Access to records is on a fee basis. The permanent 
exhibits deal with the site in prehistoric times, at the time of the Moravian 
Mission and blacksmith shop, and Fort Augusta during the French and Indian 
War and later under the Americans, during the Revolutionary War.[29] The 
local newspaper is The Daily Item. There are a variety of local radio stations, 
including the all news/sports channel WKOK 1070 kHz AM, the Big Country 
Radio Network (WLGL 92.3 FM, WQBG 100.5 FM, and WWBE 98.3 FM) and WFYY 
Y106.5 FM and 94.1 WQKX. In the episode titled "Nixon vs. Kennedy" in first 
season of the AMC cable drama Mad Men a train supposedly carrying the unrecognizable 
body of Pvt. Dick Whitman, who was killed in the Korean War, arrives in 
Sunbury. The escort officer with the casket is said to be Lt. Don Draper, 
and the casket is met by Dick Whitman's adoptive mother, his half brother, 
Adam and his mother's second husband. In fact, the person killed in Korea 
was Don Draper, and Dick Whitman has switched identities with Draper. Though 
Dick Whitman posing as Draper attempts to hide, Adam Whitman sees him, 
recognizes him, and chases the train as it leaves the station.[35] The 
extensive Sunbury Riverfront Park Project is in the planning and implementation 
stages in Sunbury. An extensive floodwall protection system was designed 
and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers in 1951. Additional height 
was added to the wall in 2003. The system has provided protection from 
15 major flood events over the past 50 years.[36] In 1972, flood waters 
from Hurricane Agnes crested at 35.8 feet (10.9 m) at Sunbury, two feet 
higher than the crest in 1936. The wall held back the water and residents 
showed their gratitude in messages they wrote on the wall.[37] Hurricane 
Agnes in late June 1972 was blamed for 10 deaths in Lancaster County, eight 
in Dauphin County, five in York County and four in both Northumberland 
and Luzerne counties, according to the Susquehanna River Basin Commission.[38] 
Additionally, a multimillion-dollar fish ladder is being built across the 
river in Shamokin Dam to mitigate the impediment of the shad migration 
up the Susquehanna River caused by the annual inflation of the Adam T. 
Bower Fabri Dam.[39] The Adam T. Bower Memorial Dam, an inflatable fabric-tube 
dam barrage impounding the Susquehanna River, creates the 3,000 acres (12 km2) 
Augusta Lake for recreation. It is inflated in May and deflated in the 
fall. The new waterfront development in Sunbury will provide a marina with 
transient boat docks, walking trails, gardens, an amphitheater and a new 
accessible fishing pier. Three acres of land will be added to the river 
side of the flood wall. The city offers baseball fields, a skating park, 
tennis courts, playgrounds, a community pool and a small park that is next 
to the county courthouse, in the downtown area.[40] A vacant building in 
the Shikellamy State Park along the river is under consideration for redevelopment 
as an environmental research and education center. Designed in the 1960s, 
the facility was originally the Basse Beck Environmental Center. It has 
been empty for several years. The city and state struggle economically, 
part of America's "Rust Belt". A Brookings Institution publication has 
cited reasons including a lack of inter-municipal coordination and cooperation, 
a changing employment base and a dearth of jobs paying a living wage, out-migration 
of young people, an aging population, the need for workforce development, 
and an inequitable local tax structure.[41] The Greater Susquehanna Valley 
United Way in 2006 commissioned a study regarding what matters most in 
area communities. They found that some major concerns were alcohol and 
drug use among all age groups and its effects on the community, the dependency 
on social services and assistance across generations, and a lack of public 
transportation.[42] It is the intention of the organization to focus spending 
on these issues. The Susquehanna Industrial Development Corporation (SIDCO) 
received $173,500 in planning grant funding (2005) to support the redevelopment 
of the Wilhold Manufacturing facility in Sunbury. The BOS funding paid 
for a market study, phase II environmental study, wetland review, traffic 
impact study and title survey. The site, an 11.6-acre (47,000 m2) former 
rail yard and plastic manufacturing plant, is to be developed into four, 
2-acre (8,100 m2) shovel-ready sites. It was suggested that the redevelopment 
of this facility will result in the creation of 120 jobs.[43] The site 
was purchased by Moran Industries, based in Watsontown, for $200,000.[44] 
Moran is using the space for food grade storage. Weis Markets has its corporate
