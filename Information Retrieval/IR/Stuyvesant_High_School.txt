Stuyvesant High School /ˈstaɪvəsənt/, commonly referred to as Stuy /ˈstaɪ/[a] 
or Stuyvesant, is one of nine specialized high schools in New York City, 
United States. Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these 
schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. Stuyvesant 
is a college preparatory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM) focused liberal arts high school. Admission to Stuyvesant involves 
passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. Each November, about 
27,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 2 1⁄2-hour exam, and roughly 950 
students, or 3.5% of applicants, are accepted to Stuyvesant each year.[8] 
Stuyvesant High School is named after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch 
governor of New Netherland before the colony was transferred to England 
in 1664.[9][10] The school was established in 1904 as a manual training 
school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved 
from its original location at 225 East 23rd Street to a building designed 
by C. B. J. Snyder at 345 East 15th Street. The building, built in 1905 
for $1.5 million, housed the Stuyvesant campus for the next 85 years.[9] 
The school became renowned for excellence in math and science, and enrollment 
continued to grow so that by 1919, admission began to be restricted based 
on scholastic achievement.[11] Stuyvesant went on a double session plan 
in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students, with some students 
attending in the morning and others in the afternoon and early evening. 
All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until 
1956.[11][12] The school implemented a system of entrance examinations 
starting in 1934. The examination program was later expanded to include 
the newly founded Bronx High School of Science, and was developed with 
the assistance of Columbia University.[13] During the 1950s, the building 
underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries 
and cafeterias.[13] In 1956, a team of six students designed and began 
construction of a cyclotron, and a low-power test of the device succeeded 
six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked 
out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.[14][15] Prior to 
1969, Stuyvesant did not accept female students. That year, 14 girls were 
admitted to Stuyvesant and 12 enrolled at the start of September, marking 
the school's first co-educational year.[9] By 2002, female enrollment had 
grown to 42%.[16] New York State Legislature passed the Hecht-Calandra 
act in 1972, designating Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, and 
The High School of Music & Art (now Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of 
Music & Art and Performing Arts) as specialized high schools of New York 
City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission 
to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science and Stuyvesant High School.[17] The exam, 
named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested students 
in math and verbal abilities for students entering all of New York City's 
specialized high schools, except for students applying for entry to LaGuardia 
High School, who are accepted by audition rather than examination.[17] 
The school building, meanwhile, deteriorated over the years. Although Stuyvesant 
was a top-notch school even through the 1970s and 1980s, when New York 
City public schools in general were marked by violence and low grades among 
their students, Stuyvesant's school building was in a broken-down state. 
A New York Times report stated that the building had "held out into old 
age with minimal maintenance and benign neglect until its peeling paint, 
creaking floorboards and antiquated laboratories became an embarrassment." 
The five-story building could not cater adequately to the several thousand 
students, leading the New York City Board of Education to secure an agreement 
with the Battery Park City Authority for a new building to be built in 
Battery Park City, near lower Manhattan's Financial District .[9] The 15th 
Street building remains in use as of 2012[update], as "Old Stuyvesant Campus", 
and houses three schools: the Institute for Collaborative Education, the 
High School for Health Professions and Human Services, and P.S. 226. During 
the 2003–4 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of 
its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a procession 
from the 15th Street building to the Chambers Street one; a meeting of 
the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, 
Science and Technology; an all-class reunion; and visits and speeches from 
notable alumni. In recent years, keynote graduation speakers have included 
Attorney General Eric Holder (2001),[18] former President Bill Clinton 
(2002),[19] United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan (2004),[20] Late 
Night comedian Conan O'Brien (2006),[21] and the founder of Humans of New 
York, Brandon Stanton (2015). Construction on the new ten-floor, $150 million 
building located in Lower Manhattan began in 1989. The new building was 
designed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners. When it opened in 1992, the building 
was New York City's first new high school building in ten years and, at 
the time, was the costliest high school building ever built in the city.[9] 
The new building is 0.5 miles (0.80 km) from the site of the World Trade 
Center, which was destroyed on September 11, 2001. The school was evacuated 
during the attack. Although the smoke cloud coming from the World Trade 
Center engulfed the building at one point, there was no structural damage 
to the building, and there were no reports of physical injuries. Less than 
an hour after the collapse of the second WTC tower, concern over a bomb 
threat at the school prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area, as 
reported live by NBC news reporter Pat Dawson on the Today show.[22] When 
classes resumed on September 21, 2001, students were moved to Brooklyn 
Technical High School while the Stuyvesant building served as a base of 
operations for rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion 
at Brooklyn Tech, and required the students to attend in two shifts, with 
the Stuyvesant students attending the evening shift. Normal classes resumed 
three weeks later on October 9. Because Stuyvesant was so close to the 
World Trade Center site, there were concerns of asbestos exposure. The 
US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and 
conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant 
High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment.[23] 
Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory 
problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School 
of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other 
isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, 
who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed 
with cancer.[24] While there have been other cases linked to the same dust 
cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant,[25] 
there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected 
the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in 
the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, 
and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance 
as a result.[24] Nine alumni were killed in the World Trade Center attack.[26] 
Another alumnus, Richard Ben-Veniste '60 , was on the 9/11 Commission. 
On October 2, 2001, the school paper, The Spectator, under Editor in Chief 
Jeff Orlowski and Faculty Advisor Holly Ojalvo, created a special 24-page 
full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections and stories. 
On November 20, 2001, the magazine was distributed for free in 830,000 
copies of The New York Times to the entire New York Greater Metropolitan 
Area.[27] In the months after the attacks, Annie Thoms (1993), an English 
teacher at Stuyvesant and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that 
the students take accounts of staff and students' reactions during and 
after September 11, 2001 and turn them into a series of monologues. Thoms 
then published these monologues as With Their Eyes: September 11—The View 
from a High School at Ground Zero. Stuyvesant has a total enrollment of 
over 3,000 students,[28] and is open to residents of New York City entering 
either ninth or tenth grade. Enrollment is based solely on performance 
on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT).[29] The list of 
schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include all of New York's specialized 
high schools except LaGuardia High School, where entry is by audition rather 
than examination. The test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant 
has consistently been higher than that needed for admission to the other 
schools using the test.[30] Admission is currently based on an individual's 
score on the examination and his or her pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant 
among the other specialized schools. Each year, about 26,000 of New York 
City's eighth-graders sit for the test.[31] Ninth and rising tenth graders 
are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, though far fewer students 
are admitted this way.[32] The test covers math (word problems and computation) 
and verbal (reading comprehension, logical reasoning, unscrambling paragraphs) 
skills. According to Article 12 of New York education law, "Admissions 
to the Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School, and Brooklyn 
Technical High School shall be solely and exclusively by taking a competitive, 
objective, and scholastic achievement examination, which shall be open 
to each and every child in the city of New York."[33] The current admission 
policy is available from the NYC Department of Education.[30] According 
to the Department of Education, Stuyvesant accepts students solely based 
on their performance on the SHSAT, although former Mayor John Lindsay and 
community activist group ACORN have argued that the exam may be biased 
against African and Hispanic Americans.[34] A major cheating scandal on 
another standardized test, which eventually implicated seventy students, 
emerged in late June 2012. According to the Department of Education, a 
student used a smartphone to send text messages to other students during 
a state Regents examination.[35] Some students involved were suspended 
as a result.[36] The ring leader, Nayeem Ahsan, was said to be the source 
of the cheating.[37] This scandal would lead to the retirement of the Principal 
Stanley Teitel.[37] The paucity of Black and Hispanic students at Stuyvesant 
has often been an issue for some city administrators. As of the 2014-15 
school year, Asian students made up 73% of the school's population; White 
students, 20%; Latinos, 3%; Blacks, 1%; and unknown/other, 7%.[38][39] 
In 1971, Mayor John Lindsay argued that the test was culturally biased 
against black and Hispanic students and sought to implement an affirmative 
action program.[17] However, protests by parents forced the plan to be 
scrapped and led to the passage of the Hecht-Calandra Act, which preserved 
admissions by examination only.[40] A small number of students judged to 
be economically disadvantaged and who come within a few points of the cut-off 
score were given an extra chance to pass the test.[41] Community activist 
group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) published 
two reports in 1996, titled Secret Apartheid and Secret Apartheid II. In 
these reports, ACORN called the SHSAT "permanently suspect" and a "product 
of an institutional racism", and claimed that black and Hispanic students 
did not have access to proper test preparation materials.[34] Along with 
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, they began an initiative for more diversity 
in the city's gifted and specialized schools, in particular demanding that 
since only a few districts send the majority of Stuyvesant's and Bronx 
Science's students, that the SHSAT be suspended altogether "until the Board 
of Education can show that the students of each middle school in the system 
have had access to curricula and instruction that would prepare them for 
this test regardless of their color or economic status." Jesse Shapiro, 
Stuyvesant valedictorian, and Alan Van Dyke and Micah C. Lasher, then sophomores, 
published several editorials in response, and change was averted.[15][42] 
A number of students take preparatory courses offered by private companies 
such as The Princeton Review and Kaplan, in order to perform better on 
the SHSAT, often leaving those unable to afford such classes at a disadvantage. 
To bridge this gap and boost minority admissions, the Board of Education 
started the Math Science Institute in 1995,[43] a free program to prepare 
students for the admissions test.[44] Students attend preparatory classes 
through the program, now known as the Specialized High School Institute, 
at several schools around the city from the summer after 6th grade until 
the 8th grade exam. Despite these free programs, the black and Hispanic 
enrollment continue to decline.[45] The new 10-story building opened in 
1992. It housed 2,700 students and 103 faculty members initially. With 
five gymnasiums, an enormous swimming pool, modern computers, 12 science 
labs, multiple escalators, spacious studios, and Hudson River views, the 
school building was considered a paragon at the time of its opening.[9] 
In 1997, the eastern end of the mathematics floor was dedicated to Dr. 
Richard Rothenberg, the math-department chairman who had died from a sudden 
heart attack earlier that year. Sculptor Madeleine Segall-Marx was commissioned 
to create the Rothenberg Memorial in his honor. She created a mathematics 
wall entitled "Celebration", consisting of 50 wooden boxes — one for each 
year of his life — behind a glass wall, featuring mathematical concepts 
and reflections on Rothenberg.[46] In 2006, Robert Ira Lewy '60 made a 
gift worth $1,000,000 to found the Dr. Robert Ira Lewy M.D. Multimedia 
Center.[47] and donated his personal library in 2007.[48] The school's 
library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.[49] 
In late 2010, the school library merged with the New York Public Library 
(NYPL) network in a four-year pilot program, in which all students of the 
school received a student library card that can check books out of the 
school library or any other public library in the NYPL system.[50] In early 
2011, Stuyvesant conducted a pilot program in conjunction with Amazon.com, 
IBM, the City University of New York, and the New York City Department 
of Education. One hundred freshmen from the class of 2014, as well as three 
teachers, were given electronic textbooks on Kindle DXs instead of traditional 
paper textbooks. The students received textbooks for Geometry, Biology, 
and World History and shared the same teachers for each of those subjects. 
While many universities have experimented with ebooks, Stuyvesant was the 
first high school to do so. Stanley Teitel, the principal at the time, 
told the Spectator he hoped to expand the program school-wide if the pilot 
program proved successful, but the program was discontinued at the end 
of the 2011 spring term after a focus group was conducted five months after 
the start of the program. The group revealed that many students found the 
Kindles difficult to study from because of the small screen and the lag 
while flipping pages; the teachers also complained saying the textbooks 
provided were below Stuyvesant's level of study.[51] The New York City 
Department of Education reports that public per student spending at Stuyvesant 
is slightly lower than the city average.[16] Stuyvesant also receives private 
contributions.[52] Shortly after the new building was completed, the $10 
million Tribeca Bridge was built to allow students to enter the building 
without having to cross the busy West Street. The new school building was 
designed to be fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
and is listed as such by the New York City Department of Education. As 
a result, the building is one of the 5 additional sites of P721M, a school 
for older (aged 15–21) students with multiple disabilities.[53] During 
construction, the Battery Park City Authority (in conjunction with the 
Percent for Art Program of the City of New York, the Department of Cultural 
Affairs and the New York City Board of Education) commissioned Mnemonics, 
an artwork by public artists Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel. Four hundred 
hollow glass blocks were dispersed randomly from the basement to the tenth 
floor of the new Stuyvesant High School building. Each block contains relics 
providing evidence of geographical, natural, cultural and social worlds, 
from antiquity to the present time. The blocks are set into the hallway 
walls and scattered throughout the building. Each block is inscribed with 
a brief description of its contents or context. The items displayed include 
a section of the Great Wall of China, fragments of the Mayan pyramids, 
leaves from the sacred Bo tree, water from the Nile and Ganges Rivers, 
a Revolutionary War button, pieces of the 15th Street Stuyvesant building, 
a report card of a student who studied in the old building, and fragments 
of monuments from around the world, various chemical compounds, and memorabilia 
from each of the 88 years' history of the 15th Street building. As an ongoing 
work, empty blocks were installed, to be filled with items chosen by the 
88 graduating classes following its installation, up through 2080.[54] 
The installation received the Award for Excellence in Design from the Art 
Commission of the City of New York.[55] Stuyvesant students undertake a 
college preparatory curriculum that includes four years of English, history, 
and laboratory-based sciences, of which biology, chemistry, and physics 
are required. In addition, students take four years of mathematics, changed 
from three beginning with the class of 2015.[56] Students also take three 
years of a single foreign language; a semester each of introductory art, 
music, health, and technical drawing; two semesters of computer science 
(changed from one for the class of 2015); and two lab-based technology 
courses.[56] Several exemptions from technology education exist for seniors.[57][58] 
Stuyvesant offers students a broad selection of elective courses. Some 
of the more unusual offerings include astronomy, New York City history, 
Women's Voices, and the mathematics of financial markets.[59] Most students 
complete the New York City Regents courses by junior year and take calculus 
during their senior year. However, the school offers math courses through 
differential equations for the more advanced students. A year of technical 
drawing used to be required; students learned how to draft by hand in its 
first semester and how to draft using a computer (CAD) in the second. Now, 
students take a one-semester technical drawing class (a compacted version 
of the former drafting course), and a semester of introductory computer 
science, which introduces NetLogo and Racket. For the class of 2015, the 
one-semester computer science course was replaced with a two-semester course.[56] 
Students can choose from 55 Advanced Placement courses[60] to earn college 
credits; a few are thus able to start college as sophomores. Such courses 
include an AP English course focusing on literature and media in the realm 
of physics and mechanics. Computer science enthusiasts can take three additional 
computer programming courses after the completion of Advanced Placement 
computer science: systems level programming, computer graphics, and software 
development. There is also a one-year computer networking class which can 
earn students Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification.[61] 
Stuyvesant's foreign language offerings include Mandarin Chinese, French, 
German, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Japanese, and Spanish. The school's Muslim 
Student Association raised funds to support courses in Arabic, which began 
in 2005.[62] Stuyvesant's Biology and Geo-science department offers courses 
in molecular biology (a course sequence composed of a molecular science 
class in the Fall and a molecular genetics class in the Spring), human 
physiology, medical ethics, medical and veterinary diagnosis, human disease, 
anthropology and sociobiology, vertebrate zoology, laboratory techniques, 
medical human genetics, botany, the molecular basis of cancer, nutrition 
science, and psychology. The Chemistry and Physics department offers organic 
chemistry, physical chemistry, astronomy, engineering mechanics, and electronics.[59] 
Although Stuyvesant is primarily known for its math and science focus, 
the school also has a comprehensive humanities program, offering students 
courses in British and classical literature, Shakespearean literature, 
science fiction, philosophy, existentialism, debate, acting, journalism, 
creative writing, and poetry. The history core requires two years of global 
history (or one year of global followed by one year of European history), 
one year of American history, as well as a semester each of economics and 
government. Humanities electives include American foreign policy, civil 
and criminal law, prejudice and persecution, race, ethnicity and gender 
issues, small business management, and Wall Street. Stuyvesant entered 
into an agreement with City College of New York in 2004, in which the college 
funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but 
taught by Stuyvesant teachers. Some of these courses include physical chemistry, 
linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history.[63][64] 
Before the 2005 revision of the SAT, Stuyvesant graduates had an average 
score of 1408 out of 1600 (685 verbal, 723 math).[16] In 2010, the average 
score on the SAT for Stuyvesant students was 2087 out of 2400, or 674, 
735, and 678 on the Reading, Math and Writing sections, respectively.[65] 
The class of 2013 had an average SAT score of 2096.[6] Stuyvesant also 
was the high school with the highest number of Advanced Placement exams 
taken, and also the highest number of students reaching the mastery level.[66] 
Stuyvesant is noted for its academic programs, having produced many notable 
alumni including four Nobel laureates.[67][68] U.S. News & World Report 
ranked it as one of the best high schools nationwide in their 2012 list 
of America's best "Gold-Medal" public high schools[69] and fifth best in 
its 2012 list of STEM schools. According to a September 2002 high school 
ranking by Worth magazine, 3.67% of Stuyvesant students went on to attend 
Harvard, Princeton, and Yale Universities, ranking it as the 9th top public 
high school in the United States and 120th among all schools, public or 
private.[70] In December 2007, The Wall Street Journal studied the freshman 
classes at eight selective colleges (Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Williams 
College, Pomona College, Swarthmore College, U. Chicago, and Johns Hopkins), 
and reported that Stuyvesant sent 67, or 9.9% of its 674 seniors, to them.[71] 
Stuyvesant, along with other similar schools, has regularly been excluded 
from Newsweek's annual list of the Top 100 Public High Schools. The May 
8, 2008 issue states the reason as being, "because so many of their students 
score well above average on the SAT and ACT."[72][73] U.S. News & World 
Report, however, included Stuyvesant on its list of "Best High Schools" 
published in December 2009, ranking 31st.[74] In its 2010 progress report, 
the New York City Department of Education assigned it the highest possible 
grade of "A".[75] Stuyvesant fields 32 varsity teams,[76] including a swimming 
team, as well as golf, bowling, volleyball, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, 
wrestling, fencing, baseball/softball, handball, tennis, track/cross country,[77] 
cricket, football,[76] and starting in Spring 2008, lacrosse teams.[76] 
In addition, Stuyvesant club teams include boys' varsity and junior varsity, 
and girls' varsity Ultimate teams. The boys' Ultimate team, the Stuyvesant 
Sticky Fingers, won the UPA New York State Championships in 2002, 2009, 
2010, 2014, and 2015. The girls' Ultimate team, Sticky Fingers, won the 
UPA Junior National tournament in 1998.[78] In 2016, both the boys and 
girls Ping Pong teams won the city championship. In September 2007 the 
Stuyvesant football team was given a home field at Pier 40, located north 
of the school at Houston Street and West Street. In 2008, the baseball 
team was granted use of the pier after construction and delivery of an 
artificial turf pitching mound that met PSAL specifications.[79] Stuyvesant 
does not, however, have its own track or tennis court, although the new 
building does have a pool.[80] Unlike most American high schools, most 
sports teams at Stuyvesant are individually known by different names. Only 
the football, cheerleading, badminton, girls ping pong, baseball, girls 
handball, girls bowling, and boys' lacrosse teams retain the traditional 
Pegleg moniker; other teams have their own unique names, such as the Runnin' 
Rebels (boys' basketball), Vixens (girls' volleyball), Lemurs (boys' gymnastics), 
Phoenix (girls' basketball), Renegades (girls' softball), Felines (girls' 
gymnastics), Birdies (girls' golf), Eagles (boys' golf), Hookers (boys' 
bowling), Huskies (girls' lacrosse), Penguins (girls' swimming), Pirates 
(boys' swimming), Centaurs (boys' soccer), Mimbas (girls' soccer), Dragons 
(boys' handball), Smokin' Aces (boys' tennis), Sticky Fingers (boys' and 
girls' Ultimate), Lobsters (girls' tennis), Vipers (girls' fencing), Flying 
Dutchmen (hockey), Greyducks (track), Tigers (cricket) and Spartans (wrestling 
and roller hockey).[76] The Stuyvesant chapter of ARISTA, the National 
Honor Society, was founded in 1910. It is an organization dedicated to 
upholding the four pillars of Character, Scholarship, Leadership, and Service. 
ARISTA is highly selective. Once selected, ARISTA's members are asked to 
complete a service requirement of 10 credits per month and to uphold all 
the pillars for which this organization stands. The ARISTA Executive Council 
consists of the President, Vice President, Vice President of Events and 
Services, Vice President of Tutoring, and Vice President of Communications. 
The ARISTA office is located in the Student Government Room, behind the 
Senior Bar. ARISTA provides a number of important and useful programs to 
the community, the school, and the student body. ARISTA's Tutoring Service 
includes many programs both inside and outside of school and online. First 
of these programs is the Peer Tutoring Service, sponsored by the Tutoring 
Committee and directed by the Vice President of Tutoring. Peer tutoring 
allows any student who is having trouble in any subject to get help. Also, 
The Tutoring Committee sponsors numerous Peer Study Workshops throughout 
the year. New this year is tutoring online. ARISTA's Events and Service 
Committee, headed by the Vice President of Events and Services, offer many 
volunteer opportunities both in school and out of school. Their activities 
include but are not limited to: monitoring for department offices, ushering 
for school theater productions, volunteering at parent teacher conferences, 
working at Soup Kitchens, tutoring at local elementary schools, participating 
in various walks (such as the MS Walk and the AIDS Walk), and volunteering 
at Stuyvesant's Open House Events. The student body of Stuyvesant is represented 
by the Stuyvesant Student Union,[28] a group of elected and appointed students 
who serve the student body in two important areas:[81] improving student 
life by promoting and managing extracurricular activities (clubs and publications), 
and by organizing out-of-school activity such as city excursions or fund-raisers; 
and providing a voice to the student body in all discussion of school policy 
with the administration. Stuyvesant offers clubs, publications, teams and 
other opportunities under a system similar to that of many colleges. It 
hosts over 200 clubs ranging from The Thinkers (philosophy) club, to the 
Photography Club.[82] The sheer number of clubs at the school is due to 
Stuyvesant's relatively free policy of "student rule". Most clubs are entirely 
student run, requiring only a Faculty Advisor to maintain their existence. 
One example of this policy is the Stuyvesant Model UN club, which is one 
of the largest clubs in the school. The club attends as many as 6 Model 
UN Conferences each year, held at various colleges across the Northeast. 
The club also hosts StuyMUNC, an annual conference organized and run almost 
entirely by the students.[83] Stuyvesant also has a Junior State of America 
program (a political debate club). The Stuyvesant Theater Community puts 
on three student-run productions a year (a fall musical, a winter drama, 
and a spring comedy) as well as a one-act festival and several smaller 
studio productions.[84] Key Club International's branch at Stuyvesant was 
founded in 1990. With over 350 members, it is one of the largest clubs 
in the school. The Spectator is Stuyvesant's official in-school newspaper, 
which is published biweekly and is independent from the school. It contains 
twelve sections: news, features, op-ed, arts & entertainment, sports, photography, 
art, layout, copy, business, humor, and web. There are over 250 total staff 
members who help with publication. At the beginning of the fall and spring 
terms, there are recruitments, but interested students may join at any 
time.[85] The Spectator, founded in 1915, is one of Stuyvesant's oldest 
publications.[86] It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake, 
Columbia University's Columbia Daily Spectator, and has been recognized 
by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism's Columbia Scholastic 
Press Association.[87] The Voice was founded in the 1973–4 academic year 
as an independent publication only loosely sanctioned by school officials.[86] 
It had the appearance of a magazine and gained a large readership. The 
Voice attracted a considerable amount of controversy and a First Amendment 
lawsuit, after which the administration forced it to go off-campus and 
to turn commercial in 1975–6.[86] In the beginning of the 1975–6 academic 
year, The Voice decided to publish the results of a confidential random 
survey measuring the "sexual attitudes, preferences, knowledge and experience" 
of the students.[88] The administration refused to permit The Voice to 
distribute the questionnaire, and the Board of Education refused to intervene, 
believing that "irreparable psychological damage" would be occasioned on 
some of the students receiving it.[88] The editor-in-chief of The Voice, 
Jeff Trachtman,[89] brought a First Amendment challenge to this decision 
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York 
in front of Judge Constance Baker Motley.[88] Judge Motley, relying on 
the relatively recent Supreme Court precedent Tinker v. Des Moines Independent 
Community School District (holding that "undifferentiated fear or apprehension 
of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression"),[90] 
ordered the Board of Education to come up with an arrangement permitting 
the distribution of the survey to the juniors and seniors. However, Judge 
Motley's ruling was overturned on appeal to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit.[91] Judge J. Edward Lumbard, joined by 
Judge Murray Gurfein and over an impassioned dissent by Judge Walter R. 
Mansfield, held that the distribution of the questionnaires was properly 
disallowed by the administration as there was "a substantial basis for 
defendants' belief that distribution of the questionnaire would result 
in significant emotional harm to a number of students throughout the Stuyvesant 
population."[91] The Supreme Court denied certiorari review.[92] Stuyvesant's 
academic teams include its nationally recognized Speech and Debate team, 
Science Olympiad, Quiz Bowl, chess, and math, which regularly compete successfully 
at major regional (New York State Mathematics League), national (American 
Regions Mathematics League), and international (International Mathematical 
Olympiad) tournaments, and whose members fill up a considerable percentage 
of the New York City Math Team.[93] A FIRST Robotics team, StuyPulse, first 
competed in 2001, and has since grown and won many regional competitions, 
most recently the New York Regional in 2016, as well as winning the Curie 
Division at the 2016 FIRST Robotics Championship in St. Louis. Stuyvesant 
also has a Model United Nations team, a Junior State of America chapter, 
and a Model Congress team which competes at regional colleges. The Model 
United Nations team hosts StuyMUNC, an annual conference which takes place 
at Stuyvesant.[94] The annual theater competition known as SING! pits seniors, 
juniors, and "soph-frosh" (freshmen and sophomores working together) against 
each other in a contest to put on the best performance. Started in 1947 
at Midwood High School in Brooklyn,[95][96] SING! is a tradition at many 
New York City high schools.[97] At Stuyvesant, SING! started as a small 
event in 1973[98] and has grown to a huge school-wide event—in 2005, nearly 
1,000 students participated. The entire production is written, directed, 
produced, and funded by students.[98] Their involvement ranges from being 
members of the production's casts, choruses, or costume and tech crews 
to Irish dance, Step, Bollywood, Hip-Hop, Swing, Ballet, Jazz or Latin 
dance groups. SING! begins in late January to February and culminates in 
final performances on three nights in March/April.[98] Scoring is done 
on each night's performances and the winner is determined by the overall 
total.[98] Stuyvesant has contributed to the education of several Nobel 
laureates, winners of the Fields Medal and the Wolf Prize, and other accomplished 
alumni. In recent years, it has had the second highest number of National 
Merit Scholarship semi-finalists, behind Thomas Jefferson High School for 
Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia.[99] Over the past nine 
years (2002–2010), Stuyvesant has produced 103 semi-finalists and 13 finalists 
on the Intel Science Talent Search, the second most of any secondary school 
in the United States.[100] For most of the 20th century, the student body 
at Stuyvesant was heavily Jewish. A significant influx of Asian students 
began in the 1970s. For the 2013 academic year, the student body was 72.31% 
Asian and 21.44% Caucasian, 1.03% African American, 2.34% Hispanic and 
3% unknown/other.[4] Notable scientists among Stuyvesant alumni include 
mathematician Paul Cohen (1950),[101] string theorist Brian Greene (1980),[102] 
physicist Lisa Randall (1980),[103] and genomic researcher Eric Lander 
(1974).[104] Other prominent alumni include civil rights leader Robert 
Parris Moses,[105] entertainers such as Thelonious Monk (1935),[106] and 
actors Lucy Liu (1986),[107] Tim Robbins (1976),[108] and James Cagney 
(1918),[109] comedian Paul Reiser (1973),[110] sports anchor Mike Greenberg 
(1985), and NBA basketball player and game fixer and bookmaker Jack Molinas 
(1949).[111] In business, government and politics, former United States 
Attorney General Eric Holder (1969) is a Stuyvesant alumnus,[112] as are 
Senior Advisor to President Obama David Axelrod (1972),[113] former adviser 
to President Clinton Dick Morris (1964),[114] and founder of 5W Public 
Relations Ronn Torossian (1992).[115] Pulitzer Prize-winning author Frank 
McCourt taught English at Stuyvesant before the publication of his memoirs 
Angela's Ashes, 'Tis, and Teacher Man. Teacher Man's third section, titled 
Coming Alive in Room 205, concerns McCourt's time at Stuyvesant, and mentions 
a number of students and faculty.[116] New York City Council member Eva 
Moskowitz (1982) graduated from the school,[117] as did the creator of 
the BitTorrent protocol, Bram Cohen (1993).[118] Four Nobel laureates are
