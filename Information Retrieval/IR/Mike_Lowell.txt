Michael "Mike" Averett Lowell (born February 24, 1974) is an American former 
Major League Baseball third baseman. During a 13-year career, Lowell played 
for the New York Yankees (1998), Florida Marlins (1999–2005), and the Boston 
Red Sox (2006–2010). With the Red Sox, he was named MVP of the 2007 World 
Series for batting .400 with 1 HR, 4 RBI, 6 runs scored and a stolen base 
in a four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies. Lowell was born in Puerto 
Rico to Carl and Beatriz Lowell on February 24, 1974. His parents were 
born in Cuba, and are of Irish and Spanish ancestry. His family relocated 
to Miami, Florida when Lowell was four years old. He has always identified 
himself as a Cuban. He attended elementary school at Epiphany Catholic 
School in South Miami, Florida. As a high school sophomore at Christopher 
Columbus High School, he was chosen to play for the varsity baseball team, 
but did not get playing time, so he transferred to Coral Gables High School 
for his junior year.[1][2] In 1992, Lowell graduated from Coral Gables 
Senior High School in Coral Gables, Florida, where he had a 4.0 GPA and 
was a star player on the baseball team. There, he met future wife Bertica, 
a member of the school's nationally recognized Gablettes dance team, of 
which she became coach years later. They have one daughter, Alexis Ileana 
Lowell, and one son named Anthony.[3] Lowell's autobiography, Deep Drive: 
A Long Journey to Finding the Champion Within, was published on May 6, 
2008.[4] On February 19, 1999, Lowell was diagnosed with testicular cancer, 
causing him to miss nearly two months of the 1999 season while he underwent 
treatment for the disease. However, he later recovered and went on to play 
baseball professionally.[5][6] The Lowell family currently resides in Pinecrest, 
Florida. Lowell was awarded an athletic scholarship to attend Florida International 
University (FIU) to play college baseball for the FIU Panthers baseball 
team. In 1993 he played in the Valley Baseball League a collegiate summer 
baseball league in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia for the Waynesboro 
Generals In the summer of 1994, he played for the Chatham A's in the Cape 
Cod Baseball League. Lowell graduated from FIU in 1997 with a Bachelor's 
Degree in Finance. A three-time All Conference player with the Panthers, 
his uniform number 15 was retired. Lowell was drafted by the New York Yankees 
in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft, and eventually made his MLB debut 
with the New York Yankees during the 1998 season. Lowell was drafted by 
the New York Yankees in the 20th round of the 1995 Major League Baseball 
draft. He made his MLB debut as a September call-up for the Yankees in 
1998, singling in his first at-bat[7] and playing eight games in the season. 
During the postseason, Lowell did not make any appearances but still received 
his first career World Series ring regardless that he debuted late in the 
season for the Yankees as the team won the 1998 World Series against the 
San Diego Padres in just 4 games. Lowell was traded to the Florida Marlins 
on February 1, 1999 for Mark Johnson and Ed Yarnall. While waiting for 
spring training, he discovered that he had testicular cancer and underwent 
surgery on February 21 returning to the lineup on May 29. He finished his 
season with a .253 BA, 12 home runs, and 47 RBI. Lowell had successful 
years in Florida and established himself as one of the elite third baseman 
in the league. In 2001, he finished with 18 home runs and 100 RBI. Lowell 
was on pace to have a great season in 2003, but in late August, he suffered 
a broken hand when he was hit by a pitch by the Montreal Expos' Héctor 
Almonte, forcing him to miss 32 games, but managed to finish the season 
with 32 home runs and 105 RBI. He was replaced by Miguel Cabrera. Lowell 
got his second career World Series ring after the Marlins won the 2003 
World Series against the Yankees in 6 games. In 2004, he hit a career high 
at the time .293 with 27 home runs and 85 RBI. Despite a disappointing 
2005 season in which he hit .236 with only 8 homers and a .298 on-base 
percentage, Lowell earned his first Gold Glove Award. Lowell also finished 
third in doubles in the league, totaling 47 doubles in the 2005 season. 
The Marlins traded him to Boston in a deal that was officially completed 
on November 21, 2005, in which the Red Sox received Lowell, Josh Beckett 
and Guillermo Mota in exchange for Hanley Ramírez, Aníbal Sánchez, Jesús 
Delgado and Harvey García. Although the Boston Red Sox took on Lowell and 
his contract largely because the Marlins would not trade pitcher Josh Beckett 
without relieving themselves of Lowell's salary, Lowell fared better than 
expected as a member of the 2006 Red Sox, for a time leading the league 
in doubles and providing solid defense at third base. Lowell finished with 
20 HR and 80 RBI, and he was tied with Eric Chavez for the best fielding 
percentage at his position. The 2007 season turned out to be one of Lowell's 
best, in which he set career bests in hits, RBI, batting average, OPS, 
and played a key role in helping the Red Sox win their second World Series 
in four years. One of the early highlights of the season came on April 
22 when Lowell was one of the four Red Sox players to hit consecutive home 
runs against the Yankees. During the first half, Lowell hit .300 and led 
the team with 14 home runs (tied with David Ortiz) and 63 RBI. This performance 
helped earn him a spot on the 2007 American League All-Star Team as a reserve 
player voted in on the player's ballot. As the Red Sox held onto its lead 
in the American League East division, Lowell continued to carry the team 
by hitting .350 during the second half. His season total of 120 RBI was 
not only a personal best but a franchise record for a Red Sox third baseman, 
beating Butch Hobson's total of 112 in 1977. Lowell also finished with 
a .324 batting average, 21 home runs and 191 hits, another career high. 
During the 2007 World Series, Lowell hit .400 with 1 HR, 4 RBI, 6 runs 
scored and a stolen base in the four-game sweep against the Colorado Rockies. 
Lowell got his second(third) World Series ring and was named the World 
Series MVP. He also became the second Puerto Rican player to be named the 
MVP of a World Series (the first one being Roberto Clemente). Lowell along 
with fellow ex-Marlin Josh Beckett became the first duo to each get a World 
Series MVP by winning a World Series with one team in the American League 
and the other in the National League. Following the season, Lowell placed 
fifth in the American League Most Valuable Player voting. Although he filed 
for free agency, Lowell returned to the Red Sox after signing a three-year 
contract worth $37.5M. Lowell had trouble with a torn hip labrum that required 
surgery between the 2008 and 2009 seasons. As a result, he spent several 
stints on the disabled list. The injury caused him to miss most of the 
2008 playoffs, including the ALCS when the Red Sox lost to the Tampa Bay 
Rays. It also kept him from representing Puerto Rico in the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic.[8] He did return to action with the Red Sox in 2009, 
though he saw reduced playing time at third base in order to keep him healthy 
and in playing condition. After the Red Sox acquired Victor Martinez in 
a midseason trade with the Cleveland Indians, Lowell's playing time was 
reduced, casting his future with the team into doubt.[9] After the season, 
it was speculated that the Red Sox would attempt to trade Lowell.[10] Following 
the 2009 season, the Red Sox and Texas Rangers agreed to a deal that would 
send Lowell to Texas for catcher Max Ramírez. However, the deal was called 
off by the Rangers when they discovered that Lowell required surgery on 
his right thumb.[11] Lowell underwent a successful surgery on December 
30.[12] He remained with the Red Sox and joined the team for Spring training 
following rehabilitation on his surgically repaired thumb.[13] On April 
10, 2010, Lowell announced that he would most likely retire after the 2010 
season. In the 2010 season, he played as a backup infielder at first and 
third base and as a pinch hitter. On August 3, after coming back from nearly 
2 months on the disabled list, Lowell stepped into the batters box to a 
standing ovation at Fenway Park and hit a 2-run home run on the first pitch.[14] 
On October 2, 2010 the Boston Red Sox honored Lowell with an on-field ceremony 
as he would go on to retire after the 2010 Major League Baseball season 
was complete.[15] Lowell works as an analyst on the MLB Network, appearing 
on "MLB Tonight." He appeared on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall
