The East Region was a region that competed in the Little League World Series 
between 1957 and 2000 until it was split into the Mid-Atlantic and New 
England regions in 2001. The East Region was inaugurated in 1957 when the 
LLWS first gave out Series berths to Regional winners.[1] The Region initially 
consisted of teams from New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Jersey, 
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and eastern 
Canada. Canada was given its own berth the following year. Puerto Rico 
briefly competed in the East Region from 1963 through 1967 before moving 
to the Latin American region. Delaware and Maryland moved to the East Region 
in 1968; Washington D.C. was given its own spot in the region in 1998. 
Little League Baseball expanded the LLWS to sixteen teams for the 2001 
Little League World Series. The East Region was split into the Mid-Atlantic 
region – Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington 
D.C. – and the New England region – Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, 
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont. The following table indicates the 
East Region champion and its LLWS performance in each year between 1957
