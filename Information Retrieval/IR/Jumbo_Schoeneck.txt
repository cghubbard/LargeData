Lewis N. "Jumbo" Schoeneck (March 3, 1862 – January 20, 1930) was a Major 
League Baseball first baseman. He played for the Chicago Browns/Pittsburgh 
Stogies (1884) and the Baltimore Monumentals (1884), both of the Union 
Association, and for the National League Indianapolis Hoosiers (1888-1889). 
He received the nickname "Jumbo" because he was 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and 
weighed 223 pounds. Schoeneck was an average fielder and a good hitter 
during his major league career. His best season was 1884 when he finished 
in the league top ten in several offensive categories, including hits (131), 
batting average (.308), on-base percentage (.320), and slugging percentage 
(.387). Schoeneck's inflated statistics in 1884 are at least partly due 
to the weak competition of the Union Association, as compared to all of 
the other major leagues. In his three major league seasons (170 games), 
Schoeneck was 186-for-657 (.283) with 79 runs scored. He pitched in two 
games for the 1888 Hoosiers and finished both, for a total of 4.1 innings, 
and allowed no earned runs. Schoeneck died in his hometown of Chicago at 
the age of 67, and was buried at Mount Emblem Cemetery in Elmhurst, Illinois.
