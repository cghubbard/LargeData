David Alan Robertson (born April 9, 1985) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously 
played in MLB for the New York Yankees from 2008 through 2014. Robertson 
played college baseball for the Alabama Crimson Tide, and made his MLB 
debut with the Yankees in 2008. Robertson was named an MLB All-Star in 
2011. After Mariano Rivera retired, Robertson served as the Yankees' closer 
in 2014. He signed with the White Sox as a free agent after the 2014 season. 
Robertson was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and played his first three years 
at Central-Tuscaloosa High School. He was a 2-year starter for the Falcons 
at shortstop and pitcher. He helped lead his team to back-to-back area 
titles, as well as back-to-back 6A State Playoff appearances. After his 
junior year, Central High School was split into three smaller high schools, 
and Robertson attended Paul W. Bryant High School. He led the Stampede 
to an area title and the Class 5A State Playoffs in the school's first 
year of existence. Robertson played college baseball at the University 
of Alabama. As a freshman in 2005, Robertson appeared in a team-high 32 
games with three games started. He compiled a 7–5 record with 8 saves and 
a 2.92 earned run average (ERA). He led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) 
by limiting hitters to a .183 batting average. He was named Freshman All-SEC 
and Freshman All-American by Baseball America.[1] In his sophomore season, 
Robertson helped lead the Crimson Tide to their 25th SEC Championship. 
He appeared in 29 games, compiling a 4–4 record with a 3.02 ERA. He led 
the SEC with 10 saves. Due to Robertson being 21 at the time of the 2006 
draft, he was a draft-eligible sophomore and was drafted in the 17th round 
by the New York Yankees. He played summer league in Cape Cod and was named 
Most Valuable Player of the Cape Cod League playoffs.[2] Robertson was 
drafted by the New York Yankees in the 17th round of the 2006 Major League 
Baseball Draft. In 2007, pitching for three minor league teams, he was 
8–3 with 4 saves and a 0.96 ERA in 84 1⁄3 innings, allowing 45 hits while 
striking out 114 batters. In 2008, pitching for two minor league teams, 
he was 4–0 with 3 saves and a 1.68 ERA in 53 2⁄3 innings, allowing 28 hits 
while striking out 77. On June 28, 2008, the Yankees called him up from 
the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Triple-A International League.[3] 
On August 28, 2008, the Yankees optioned him back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
with an earned run average of 6.31. He was recalled back to the majors 
on September 13.[4][5] He appeared in 25 Major League games in 2008 going 
4–0 with a 5.34 ERA. After starting the 2009 regular season in Triple-A, 
Robertson was recalled to the majors on April 16, 2009, to replace Xavier 
Nady, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The next day he was optioned 
back to Triple-A to open a roster spot for Juan Miranda. On May 25, 2009, 
he was again recalled to the majors to replace reliever Brian Bruney.[6] 
Robertson finished the season with a 3.30 ERA and 13.0 strikeouts per 9 
innings in 43 2⁄3 innings.[7] In the 2009 playoffs, Robertson entered two 
games in high-pressure situations with multiple runners on base, once in 
the ALDS and once in the ALCS, and managing to escape the inning without 
letting any runs score.[8] Robertson received the win in both games. The 
Yankees would go on to win the World Series over the Philadelphia Phillies, 
which was the first championship in Robertson's career. Robertson finished 
the 2010 season with a 3.82 ERA and 10.4 strikeouts per 9 innings in 61 1⁄3 
innings.[7] In Game 6 of the 2010 ALCS against the Texas Rangers, Robertson 
relieved Phil Hughes in the 5th inning and surrendered a two-run home run 
to Nelson Cruz which gave the Rangers a 5–1 lead; the Rangers would win 
the game 6–1 to take the AL pennant.[9] The Yankees entered the 2011 season 
with the additions of Pedro Feliciano and Rafael Soriano. Robertson lost 
out to Joba Chamberlain to be the 7th inning specialist who manager Joe 
Girardi wanted to bridge to Soriano and closer Mariano Rivera.[citation 
needed] Injuries to Feliciano, Soriano and Chamberlain put Robertson in 
the 8th inning setup role, where he achieved 55 strikeouts half way through 
the season. Robertson was named to the 2011 American League All-Star roster 
replacing David Price for his first All-Star appearance.[10] He finished 
the season with 100 strikeouts, becoming the first Yankee reliever since 
Rivera (in 1996) to record 100 strikeouts in a single season.[11][12] Robertson 
finished his breakout season leading the league in ERA (1.08) and holds 
(34), along with a 13.5 strikeouts per 9 innings ratio (2nd in the AL), 
and an MLB-leading adjusted ERA+ of 410.[7] He received exactly one point 
in the voting for both the AL Cy Young Award (the only non-starter or non-closer 
with a vote) and AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award (the only reliever 
with a vote). Robertson also won the This Year in Baseball Setup Man of 
the Year Award. In January 2012, the Yankees and Robertson agreed on a 
1-year non-guaranteed contract worth $1.6 million, plus another $25,000 
in incentives. When Rivera went down with a season-ending injury in May 
2012, Girardi announced that Robertson and Soriano would share the duties 
of closing games for the remainder of the season.[13] Robertson himself 
would be placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 15 after a he strained 
a muscle in his rib cage, twelve days after Rivera's season-ending ACL 
injury. He returned to action on June 15,[14] but after several appearances 
became the setup man for Soriano. Robertson finished the 2012 season 2–7 
with a 2.67 ERA and 2 saves in 65 games. In 2013, Robertson served as the 
8th inning specialist (setup man) behind Rivera. He appeared in 70 games 
during 2013 going 5–1 with 3 saves and a 2.04 ERA. Rivera retired after 
the 2013 season. During spring training in 2014, Robertson was named the 
Yankees' closer.[15] On April 7, 2014, Robertson was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list due to a groin strain. Robertson had a successful season 
in 2014 as he compiled a 3.08 ERA and was successful on 39 out of 44 save 
attempts. He showed the Yankees he could be a good replacement for Rivera. 
On November 10 Robertson officially declined the Yankees' $15.3-million 
qualifying offer for the 2015 season, making him a free agent.[16][17] 
After the 2014 season, Robertson became a free agent. He subsequently agreed 
to a four-year, $46 million contract with the Chicago White Sox.[18] With 
an overhand delivery, Robertson throws a four-seam fastball typically at 
92–93 mph (occasionally reaches 95–96 mph). Robertson's main off-speed 
pitch is a curveball in the low 80s. Infrequently, he throws a circle changeup 
to left-handed hitters in the mid-high 80s.[19] Although Robertson's fastball 
speed is not unusually high, his long stride toward home plate during his 
delivery appears to "add" 2 mph to his fastball by shortening the ball's 
time in flight.[20] His fastball also has a "natural cut" to it, making 
it appear as if he is throwing a cut fastball.[21] Robertson has always 
had a high walk rate (about 1 every 2-3 innings over his career), but this 
is mitigated by an outstanding strikeout rate; Robertson has averaged at 
least one strikeout per inning in every year of his career so far. His 
high strikeout rate has proved useful in critical late-inning situations 
— in 2011, Robertson struck out 14 of the 19 hitters he faced with the 
bases loaded and allowed only one hit.[22] His tendency to invite trouble 
by walking batters, only to escape it by getting strikeouts, earned him 
the nickname "Houdini." His brother, Connor, formerly played for the Oakland 
Athletics and the Arizona Diamondbacks.[23][24][25] Robertson married Erin 
Cronin in January 2009.[26][27] They had their first child, a boy named 
Luke Joseph Robertson, on August 27, 2012.[28] Robertson and his wife started 
a charitable foundation called "High Socks for Hope" to help the victims 
of Robertson's hometown of Tuscaloosa, Alabama deal with the tornado strikes 
in 2011. Robertson agreed to donate $100 for every strikeout he recorded 
in the season.[29][30] For his work, Robertson was nominated for the 2011
