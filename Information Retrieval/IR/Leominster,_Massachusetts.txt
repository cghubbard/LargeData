Leominster (/ˈlɛmənstər/ LEM-ən-stər) is a city in Worcester County, Massachusetts, 
United States. It is the second-largest city in Worcester County, with 
a population of 40,759 at the 2010 census. Leominster is located north 
of Worcester and west of Boston. Both Route 2 and Route 12 pass through 
Leominster. Interstate 190, Route 13, and Route 117 all have starting/ending 
points in Leominster. Leominster is bounded by Fitchburg and Lunenburg 
to the north, Lancaster to the east, Sterling and Princeton to the south, 
and Westminster to the west. Probably taking the name from Leominster, 
Herefordshire, England. The region was originally inhabited by various 
divisions of the Pennacook or Nipmuc Native Americans, who lived along 
the Nashua River. The river provided fertile soil for the cultivation of 
corn, beans, squash and tobacco.[1] European settlers began arriving in 
the mid-17th century and in 1653, the area of Leominster was first founded 
as part of the town of Lancaster.[2] The European settlers and native people 
lived peacefully for a number of years, until the start of King Philip's 
War in 1675.[1][2] The violent war between the native Indians and early 
settlers killed hundreds of people and drove off the inhabitants from the 
area.[1][2] After the war, Lancaster remained virtually deserted until 
a new land grant was offered to residents in 1701.[1][2] To prevent further 
conflict with the native Indians, the settlers negotiated with Chief Sholan 
of the Nashaway tribe for the land.[2] It would be the only parcel of land 
to be legally purchased in Central Massachusetts.[2] By 1737, the area 
of Leominster had gained enough residents to be incorporated as a separate 
town. The town of Leominster was officially incorporated on July 4, 1740.[1][2] 
Around the time of the Civil War, Leominster was a major contributor in 
the Underground Railroad. The Emory Stearn Schoolhouse and the John Drake 
home, led anti-slavery campaigns and helped house fugitive slaves.[3] In 
Leominster’s early existence, the town was primarily a small farming community, 
but towards the beginning of the 19th century, the economy quickly shifted 
into manufacturing.[1] The town became a regional transportation hub around 
1800, with the opening of the Fifth Massachusetts Turnpike and the connections 
of the Union Turnpike and Cambridge and Concord Turnpikes in 1808.[4] However, 
manufacturing in Leominster was truly made possible by the opening of the 
Fitchburg Railroad that ran through North Leominster and into Boston, and 
the Fitchburg and Worcester Railroad that ran through the center of town.[4] 
By the 1850s, paper mills, piano makers, and comb manufacturers had established 
factories along the Monoosnoc Brook and Nashua River.[1][2] While the earliest 
settlers in Leominster were primarily of British ancestry, many immigrants 
soon gathered to work in Leominster’s expanding factories.[1] The first 
group of immigrants was primarily Irish, followed by the French and the 
Italians into the early 20th century.[1] These new waves of immigrants 
caused the population to surge from just 2,069 in 1840 to 19,744 by 1920.[5] 
In 1915, Leominster was officially chartered as a city.[6] While many different 
industries established themselves in Leominster, it was the comb industry 
that particularly flourished.[7] Construction of combs was a time-consuming 
and painstaking process, involving preparation of the natural materials 
such as animal horn, roughing out of a basic form, and finally, individual 
cutting of the teeth.[8] By 1853, there were already 146 employees working 
in 24 different comb factories across the town.[2] By the mid-1800s, however, 
availability of the natural materials used to make combs, such as animal 
horns and hooves, was diminishing rapidly, and an alternative material 
was needed.[7] The solution would come in a new material called celluloid 
invented in 1868.[7] The new plastic would revolutionize the comb industry 
and give Leominster the nickname the “Comb City.” [7] The versatility of 
celluloid would also give manufactures the opportunity to expand to many 
different products outside of combs.[7] The largest plastic manufacturer 
in the city was the Viscoloid Company founded by Bernard Wendell Doyle 
in 1901.[7] In 1914, the Viscoloid Company pioneered making toys out of 
pyroxylin plastic, and by 1923 the company was the largest employer in 
Leominster.[7] Viscoloid would be sold to The DuPont Company in 1925, and 
renamed the Dupont Viscoloid Company. The second invention to revolutionize 
plastic production in Leominster was the development of modern injection 
molding.[7] Samuel Foster, a Leominster resident of German ancestry, first 
worked for the Viscoloid Company, then established his own business, Foster 
Grant. In 1931, Foster visited Jack Goodman's New York factory and learned 
about an injection molding machine,[8] invented in Germany in the early 
1920s.[7] Foster ordered several of the new machines, and had them secretly 
shipped via Worcester to his Foster Grant manufacturing factory in Leominster, 
where his mechanics focused on getting them to work and modifying them.[8] 
Molding technology made it possible for Foster Grant to make not only combs, 
but a wide variety of other articles, including plastic sunglasses, selling 
20 million pair in 1937.[8] The new technology would pay great dividends 
for the plastic industry in the city and the country.[7] Soon the city 
would be coined the “Pioneer Plastics City” for its important history in 
the plastics industry.[7] Leominster was also the home of Tupperware, founded 
in 1938 by Earl Tupper. His "wonderbowl," with its airtight "burping" seal 
became popular after Brownie Wise convinced him to demonstrate and sell 
Tupperware at home parties.[9][10] Leominster also boasted large manufactures 
Standard Tool Company, Selig Manufacturing Co. Inc, C.E. Buckley, Inc. 
(manufacturer of religious articles) and the Whitney Carriage Company, 
which was once the largest manufacturer of baby carriages in the world.[7] 
In 1956, the plastic pink flamingo lawn-ornament was invented in Leominster 
for Union Products. The famous lawn-ornament was designed by Don Featherstone, 
and was modelled after pictures of flamingos in National Geographic.[7][11] 
Although the Great Depression slowed the plastic industry in Leominster, 
it was not until the late 20th century that there was a full-scale decline 
in plastic manufacturing. Following the national trend, manufactures were 
moving out of the cities to cheaper alternatives across the country and 
overseas.[7] Despite the changing landscape, the population of Leominster 
would continually rise into the 21st century, surpassing her twin city 
of Fitchburg in 2000 as the second largest city in Worcester County. The 
Latino communities of Leominster also saw huge growth towards the later 
half of the 20th century.[12] In recent decades, Route 2 and the building 
of I-190 have further altered the city into a more commercial and suburban 
landscape.[7] The construction of the Twin City Plaza, Mall at Whitney 
Field and other shopping centers have all contributed to significant commercial 
growth in the city and have made Leominster one of Central Massachusetts’ 
largest retail destination. Inexpensive land cost has also made the city 
an attractive living destination for commuters to both Worcester and Boston.[7] 
Nevertheless, Leominster still preserves some of its manufacturing heritage 
and many plastic manufactures retain establishment in the city.[7] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 29.8 square 
miles (77 km2), of which 28.9 square miles (75 km2) is land and 0.9 square 
miles (2.3 km2), or 2.96%, is water. Leominster is primarily located on 
a plateau above the Nashua River.[1] The river runs through the eastern 
proportion of the city and then cuts through the northern part of the city 
as it meanders towards Fitchburg.[13] Northern and Western Leominster have 
a more rugged terrain defined by scattered hills.[14] The most prominent 
hills are both the North and South Monoosnoc Hills in the western part 
of the city. The South Monoosnoc Hill is the highest point in the town 
at 1,020 feet.[14] In the 19th century, the south hill was quarried for 
granite used in home foundations.[14] West of the two hills lies the No 
town Reservoir and Leominster State Forest. To the east, lies the Monoosnoc 
Brook which winds through the center of town and was an important power 
source for early manufacturers.[14] The city is divided into several small 
"villages" such as French Hill, a large hill covered in planned blocks 
of "triple decker" apartment houses located from 1st Street to 12th Street. 
It is called French Hill because this is where the large immigrant French 
population took root. In the early 20th century, on Lincoln Terrace, immigrating 
Italian families began to arrive in the area and built a semi-closed society 
which existed for many years. The French population built a new church 
and moved closer to it. Other areas include Morse Hollow, North Leominster, 
Rice Hill, the Flats, the Bowery, the West Side, and the Car Barn area, 
located along the Fitchburg border, so-called because the Fitchburg & Leominster 
Railway trolley cars were stored and maintained in this area. It now has 
buses. A granite marker showing the birthplace of Johnny Appleseed can 
be found on Johnny Appleseed Lane. As of the census[26] of 2000, there

Leominster has a long cultural history including various theatres, performance 
groups, exhibits and entertainment events. The Leominster Colonial Band, 
founded by Italian immigrants in 1910, has presented a free summer concerts 
series since the 1930s. Their annual Christmas concert, begun in 1990, 
is a favorite city tradition. Since 1973, the Thayer Symphony Orchestra 
has been performing in Central Massachusetts.[29][30] Composed of orchestra 
professional, community volunteers, and student musicians, Thayer Symphony 
Orchestra’s popularity forced them to move to the Straos Dukakus Performing
