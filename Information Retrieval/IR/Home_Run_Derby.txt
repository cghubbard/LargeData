The Home Run Derby is an annual home run hitting contest in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) customarily held the day before the MLB All-Star Game, which 
places the contest on a Monday in July. Since the inaugural derby in 1985, 
the event has seen several rule changes, evolving from a short outs-based 
competition, to multiple rounds, and eventually a bracket-style timed event. 
It is currently sponsored by T-Mobile, a wireless cellphone company. The 
event has grown significantly from its roots in the 1980s, when it was 
not televised. Prior to 1991, the Home Run Derby was structured as a two-inning 
event with each player receiving five outs per inning, allowing for the 
possibility of ties. It is now one of the most-watched events broadcast 
on ESPN.[1][2][3] In 2000, a "match play"-style format was instituted for 
the second round. The player with the most home runs in the first round 
faced the player with the least among the four qualifying players, as did 
the players with the second- and third-most totals. The contestant who 
won each matchup advanced to the finals. This format was discontinued after 
the 2003 competition. The field of players selected currently consists 
of four American League players and four National League players. The first 
Derby in 1985 featured five from each league, and the 1986 and 1987 events 
featured three and two players from each league, respectively. In 1996, 
the field was again expanded to ten players, five from each league (though 
in 1997, the AL had six contestants to the NL's four). In 2000, the field 
reverted to the current four-player-per-league format. The only exception 
was 2005, when Major League Baseball changed the selection criteria with 
eight players representing their home countries rather than their respective 
leagues. The change was believed to be in promotion of the inaugural World 
Baseball Classic, played in March 2006.[citation needed] In 2006, the selection 
of four players from each league resumed. In 2011, the format was revised 
so that team captains selected the individual sides.[citation needed] Some 
notable performances in the Derby include Bobby Abreu in 2005, who won 
the Derby with a then-record 41 homers, including a then-record 24 in the 
first round. The first-round record was broken in 2008 by Josh Hamilton, 
who hit 28 home runs. Though Hamilton's performance was notable for the 
length of his home runs,[citation needed] he ultimately lost to Justin 
Morneau in a brief final round. The overall record was broken in 2016 by 
Giancarlo Stanton, who finished with a total of 61 home runs, defeating 
Todd Frazier in the final round. Only two participants, Yoenis Céspedes 
and Giancarlo Stanton, have won the Home Run Derby without being selected 
to the All-Star game itself.[4] The format has varied since the Home Run 
Derby started in 1985. In the early years of the Home Run Derby, 4-10 players 
from both the AL and NL were selected to participate. Each player was given 
2 "innings" to hit as many home runs as possible before reaching 5 outs. 
For the derby, an out is defined as any swing that is not a home run. The 
winner of the contest was the player with the most total home runs in the 
two innings. Beginning in 1991, the format changed to a 3-round contest. 
From 1991–2006, 8-10 players were selected and hit as many home runs as 
possible before reaching 10 outs in each round. The tally reset for each 
round, with the top four advancing to the second round, and the top two 
advancing to the final. In honor of the World Baseball Classic, the 2005 
contest featured eight players from different countries. The format remained 
the same. The format changed slightly in 2006. Instead of the tally resetting 
for each round, it was only reset before the final round. Therefore, the 
players with the four highest totals after Round 1 advanced to Round 2, 
and the players with the two highest sum of Round 1 and 2 advanced to the 
finals. The Home Run Derby format was changed significantly in 2014, as 
MLB sought to speed-up the contest and increase the drama. In the new bracket 
format, 5 players from each league faced the other players in their league 
in Round 1, with each players having 7 "outs." The player in each league 
with the highest Round 1 total received a second-round bye, and the players 
with the second- and third-highest Round 1 totals from each league faced 
off. The Round 2 winner from each league faced the Round 1 winner, and 
the Round 3 winner crowned the league winner. The final featured the winner 
of each league. Each round stands alone, with the score reset for each 
round.[5] Ties in any round are broken by a 3-swing swing-off. If the players 
remain tied, the players engage in a sudden-death swing-off until one player 
homers.[6] The format was changed once again in 2015. The most significant 
change was the elimination of "outs", which was replaced by a time limit. 
Eight players are seeded based on their season home run totals and are 
given 5 minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. The winner of each 
head-to-head matchup advances, until a final winner is determined. If a 
tie occurs in any match-up, a 90-second swing-off decides the winner. If 
a tie still occurs, each player swings at 3 pitches; thereafter, sudden-death 
pitches until a winner is determined. Further, a player can get "bonus 
time" in the last minute of each round. During that time, the clock stops 
for each home run, and doesn't restart until a swing does not result in 
a home run. Additional bonus time could be earned for distance. Players 
who hit at least two home runs measuring at least 420 feet (130 m) are 
given an extra minute of bonus time. An additional 30 seconds of bonus 
time is granted if at least one home run measures over 475 feet (145 m).[7] 
Weather concerns in 2015 lead to a reduction in time from 5 minutes per 
round to 4 minutes. The clock was not stopped in the final minute, and 
bonus was only granted for hitting 2 home runs of greater than 425 feet.[8] 
The format was tweaked slightly in 2016. The four-minute round length returned, 
while the minute of bonus time was changed to 30 seconds and required two 
home runs of 440 feet (130 m) or longer. The additional time was removed, 
while the swing-off (which was not required) was reduced to 1 minute.[9] 
Each batter is allowed one time-out during each round, and two time-outs 
in the final round. From 2005–2013, a gold ball has been used once a player 
reaches nine outs (in 2014 when the T-Mobile Ball came into play, six; 
since 2015, during the final minute). If a batter hit a home run using 
the golden ball, Century 21 Real Estate and Major League Baseball would 
donate $21,000 (a reference to the "21" in "Century 21") per home run to 
charity (MLB donated to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Century 
21 donated to Easter Seals). In both 2005 and 2006, $294,000 was raised 
for the charities, equaling fourteen golden ball home runs per year. State 
Farm continued this in 2007 as they designated $17,000 per home run (one 
dollar for each of State Farm's agencies), to the Boys and Girls Clubs 
of America. In the 2007 event, fifteen golden balls were hit for a donation 
of $255,000, and ten ($170,000) were hit in the 2008 event. For 2009, State 
Farm added $5,000 for all non-Gold Ball homers, and $517,000 was collected. 
For 2010, the non-Gold Ball homer was reduced to $3,000 per home run and 
a total of $453,000 was collected. Since 2014 any homer hit off a T-Mobile 
Ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile and MLB, to 
the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. The derby was first nationally televised 
by ESPN in 1993 on a same-day delayed basis,[10] with the first live telecast 
in 1998. Although two hours were initially devoted to the telecast, it 
hasn't been uncommon for the program to run over schedule. The 2006 through 
2008 events, for example, lasted nearly three hours. Since 2009, three 
hours are devoted to the event. Chris Berman has gained notoriety for his 
annual hosting duties on ESPN, including his catchphrase, "Back back back…Gone!". 
Berman starts this phrase when the ball is hit, and does not say "Gone!" 
until the ball lands. The 2008 Derby was the year's most highly rated basic 
cable program.[11] Because of the game's TV popularity, invited players 
have felt pressure to participate. Notably, Ken Griffey Jr. initially quietly 
declined to take part in 1998, partly due to ESPN scheduling the Mariners 
in their late Sunday game the night before. After a discussion with ESPN's 
Joe Morgan and another with Hall of Famer Frank Robinson, Griffey changed 
his mind, and then won the Derby at Coors Field.[12] In Spanish the event 
is televised on Spanish language network ESPN Deportes.[13] ESPN Radio 
also carries the event annually.[14] Note: these numbers exclude swingoffs.
