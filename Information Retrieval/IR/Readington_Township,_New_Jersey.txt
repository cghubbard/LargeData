Readington Township is a township located in the easternmost portion of 
Hunterdon County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States 
Census, the township's population was 16,126,[9][10][11] reflecting an 
increase of 323 (+2.0%) from the 15,803 counted in the 2000 Census, which 
had in turn increased by 2,403 (+17.9%) from the 13,400 counted in the 
1990 Census.[21] Nationwide, Readington Township ranked 87th in 2000 among

II, "Reading" Township was formed on July 15, 1730, from portions of Amwell 
Township. It was the first new township created after Hunterdon became 
a county. The township was incorporated as Readingtown Township, one of 
New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships, on February 21, 1798. Portions 
of the township were annexed by Tewksbury Township in 1832 and 1861.[22] 
The township was named for John Reading, the first native-born governor 
of the British Province of New Jersey.[23][24] Covering more than 48 square 
miles (120 km2), it is the largest township in the county, covering almost 
11% of the county's area.[25] Over 8,000 acres (32 km2) of land have been 
preserved. Readington Township is bounded on the north by the Lamington 
River and Rockaway Creek; to the east by Somerset County, which existed 
as the boundary between East and West Jersey from 1688–1695;[26] to the 
south, the South Branch of the Raritan River; and to the west by the old 
West Jersey Society's line which crosses the Cushetunk Mountains. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 48.039 
square miles (124.421 km2), including 47.736 square miles (123.636 km2) 
of land and 0.303 square miles (0.784 km2) of water (0.63%).[1][2] Whitehouse 
Station (2010 Census population of 2,089[27]) is an unincorporated community 
and census-designated place (CDP) located within Readington Township.[28] 
The township borders Clinton Township, Raritan Township and Tewksbury Township 
in Hunterdon County; and Branchburg and Hillsborough Township in Somerset 
County.[29] Cushetunk Mountain is a ring-shaped mountain located in Clinton 
Township. Once an active volcano, the diabase mountain was formed 160 million 
years ago. The Lenape called the mountain "Cushetunk" meaning "place of 
hogs".[30] In the 1960s, the valley was filled with water to create Round 
Valley Reservoir, at 180 feet (55 m) in depth the second-deepest in the 
state.[31] Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located

in the town; the mill provided troops with food during the Revolutionary 
War. Readington Township is governed under the Township form of government.
