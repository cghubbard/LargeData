The Cincinnati Reds' 2006 season was a season in American baseball. It 
involved the Reds making a bid to win the NL Central division, although 
just falling short, finishing in third place. The Reds had a final record 
of 80–82 and were managed by Jerry Narron. In the offseason before the 
season started, the Reds changed their ownership and their general manager. 
One key pickup was pitcher Bronson Arroyo. The Reds finished in third place 
in the NL Central division, just 3½ games behind the division winner and 
eventual World Series champion, the St. Louis Cardinals. The Reds also 
finished 2 games behind the second place team, the Houston Astros. They 
finished five games ahead of the fourth place team, the Milwaukee Brewers. 
They finished thirteen games ahead of the fifth place team, the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, and fourteen games ahead of the sixth place team, the Chicago 
Cubs. Aaron Harang led the team in wins with 16, and National League All-Star 
Bronson Arroyo was second with 14.[1] The Reds finished in 12th out of 
16 teams in the National League in attendance.[1] Scott Hatteberg led the 
team in batting average and on-base percentage, with .289 and .389, respectively. 
Adam Dunn led the team in slugging percentage, games played, at bats, plate 
appearances, runs, total bases, home runs, runs batted in, walks, intentional 
walks, strikeouts, extra-base hits, and times on base. Edwin Encarnación 
led the team in doubles (with 33) and hit by pitch (13 times). Ryan Freel 
had more stolen bases and times caught stealing than anyone else on the 
team, with 37 and 11, respectively.[1] Infielders Outfielders Other batters
