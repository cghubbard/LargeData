Nippon Professional Baseball (2005–present) The Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles 
(東北楽天ゴールデンイーグルス, Tōhoku Rakuten Gōruden Īgurusu?) is a baseball team based 
in Sendai, in Miyagi Prefecture, which plays in the Japanese Nippon Professional 
Baseball Pacific League since 2005. They were Japan Series champions in 
2013 after defeating the Yomiuri Giants. The team was created to fill the 
void left by the merger of the Orix BlueWave and the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, 
after the 2004 season due to financial difficulties, leaving the Pacific 
League with five teams, causing the biggest crisis in the traditional two-league 
structure in NPB and finally caused the historical-first baseball player 
strike in Japan. The team is owned by the Internet shopping company Rakuten.[1] 
The team's manager was Katsuya Nomura, the oldest manager in NPB history, 
but he was replaced after the 2009 season by Marty Brown, the former manager 
of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. Brown was in turn replaced by Senichi Hoshino 
after a last place finish in 2010. Masataka Nashida has been the team's 
manager since 2016. The team's stadium was heavily damaged by floods during 
the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11.[2] Pitchers Catchers
