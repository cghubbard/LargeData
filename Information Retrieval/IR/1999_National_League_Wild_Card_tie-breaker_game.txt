The 1999 National League wild-card tie-breaker game was a one-game extension 
to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1999 regular season, played between the 
New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds to determine the winner of the National 
League (NL) wild card. It was played at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, on 
October 4, 1999. The Mets won the game 5–0, with starting pitcher Al Leiter 
pitching a two-hit shutout. As a result, the Mets qualified for the postseason 
and the Reds did not. The game was necessary after both teams finished 
the season with identical win–loss records of 96–66. Some described the 
Mets as collapsing late in the season while the race between the Reds and 
their division rival Houston Astros was close enough to create the possibility 
of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip late in the season which, 
by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, 
the Mets advanced to NL Division Series (NLDS) where they defeated the 
Arizona Diamondbacks, three-games-to-one. They then advanced to the NL 
Championship Series (NLCS) but were defeated by the Atlanta Braves in six 
games, bringing an end to the Mets' season. In baseball statistics, the 
tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game by both teams, with 
all events in the game added to regular season statistics. Neither the 
Mets nor the Reds had made the playoffs the previous season. The Mets finished 
the 1998 season with an 88–74 record, while the Reds finished below .500 
at 77–85.[1] The Mets had been tied with the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco 
Giants in the 1998 wild-card race as late in the season as September 25 
at 88–72.[2] However, the Mets did not win another game that year and finished 
their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who tied at 89–73.[1] 
The Cubs and Giants played a tie-breaker in 1998, with the Cubs ultimately 
winning the wild card.[1] Sports writers said the Mets "blew" their lead 
and "collapse[d]", later comparing their 1998 season to the Mets' troubles 
late in the 1999 season.[3][4] Rickey Henderson and Robin Ventura joined 
the Mets prior to the 1999 season and spent the year as their starting 
left fielder and third baseman.[5][6][7] The Reds added right fielder Michael 
Tucker, center fielder Mike Cameron, and starting pitchers Denny Neagle 
and Steve Avery during the offseason.[8][9][10][11][12] The Mets spent 
34 days of the 1999 season leading the Eastern Division, but following 
a seven-game losing streak from September 21–28 along with an eight-game 
winning streak by their division rival Atlanta Braves from September 19–28 
the Braves took a commanding 8-game lead in the division that they did 
not relinquish.[13][14] Meanwhile, the Reds and Houston Astros were locked 
in a tight race for the Central division. The Astros led the division for 
much of the season, but did not lead by more than three games after August 
1 except for one day.[15][16] Ultimately, the Astros won the division with 
a 97–65 record, one game ahead of the 96–66 Reds.[15][16] The Astros won 
their 97th game on the final day of the season.[15] If Houston had not 
won that game the Astros, Reds, and Mets would have instead been locked 
in a three-way tie. Bob Costas suggested that MLB was lucky to avoid this 
situation as he believed they had "no reasonable tiebreaker" to deal with 
it.[17] Had this three-way tie arisen the Mets would have won the wild 
card while the Astros and Reds would have played a tie-breaker for the 
Central division title.[18] The Mets' losing streak late in the season 
led Jayson Stark to label them a "sinking ship" in a column on September 
30.[19] However, the Mets broke this streak with a win over dominant pitcher 
Greg Maddux and then, following a loss, swept three games from the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[13][19] The sweep included a walk-off win in the final game of 
the series. The Mets and Pirates were tied 1–1 in the bottom of the ninth 
inning when Pirates closer Brad Clontz threw a wild pitch which allowed 
Melvin Mora to score and win the game 2–1, tying the Reds' 96–66 record.[20] 
The New York Daily News described this late-season performance as an "agonizing 
roller coaster ride" for Mets fans.[21] With the Mets and Reds holding 
the best non-division winning records in the league[22] a tie-breaker was 
necessary to determine the wild-card winner. Bob Costas said at the time 
he did not like the wild-card system as he believed it "diminishes the 
drama and authenticity of a pennant race", although he approved of the 
playoff teams in 1999.[17] Tim McCarver disagreed, arguing that the late-season 
race between the Mets, Astros, and Reds showed the excitement a wild card 
can add to the season.[17] A coin flip conducted earlier that September 
set the Reds' home park of Cinergy Field as the location for the tie-breaker 
game.[23] Box score for Monday October 4, 1999–7:05 p.m. (ET) at Cinergy 
Field in Cincinnati The Mets took a quick 2–0 lead with a single by Rickey 
Henderson to open the game followed immediately by a home run by Edgardo 
Alfonzo. They added to this lead in the third as Alfonzo drew a walk and 
then John Olerud hit a double which advanced Alfonzo to third base. Reds 
starter Steve Parris intentionally walked Mike Piazza to load the bases 
and was relieved by Denny Neagle. However, Neagle then walked Robin Ventura 
to score Alfonzo and extend the lead to 3–0. Neagle remained in the game 
and yielded a home run to Henderson to lead off the fifth inning for the 
Mets' fourth run. Neagle then loaded the bases with two outs with walks 
to Piazza and Ventura followed by a Darryl Hamilton single, but escaped 
the inning without further scoring. The Reds pinch hit for Neagle in the 
bottom of the fifth, and Danny Graves entered for them to pitch the sixth 
inning. Graves walked Rey Ordóñez to leadoff the inning, Mets starter Al 
Leiter sacrifice bunted Ordóñez to second, and following an out he scored 
on a double by Alfonzo. Graves remained in the game until Mark Lewis pinch 
hit for him in the eighth and Dennys Reyes relieved him in the ninth. Graves 
and Reyes held the score steady after the sixth but the Reds' offense did 
not score against Al Leiter and the Mets won the game, and with it the 
Wild Card, 5–0. Al Leiter pitched a complete game shutout, scattering two 
hits and four walks across the nine inning start. This was Leiter's first 
complete game of the season.[4] Pokey Reese was the only Reds player to 
reach scoring position for the entire game, doubling to lead off the bottom 
of the ninth inning and then advancing to third on a ground out. The Bergen 
Record labeled Leiter the Mets' "flag bearer", coming through in games 
such as this when the team needed him most.[4] For example, Leiter had 
also defeated Greg Maddux in his previous start on September 29 to snap 
the Mets' seven-game losing streak.[24] Leiter's earned run average in 
the second half of the 1999 season was 1.22 runs lower than in the first.[25] 
Leiter's start earned an 86 game score, which tied for the 14th best total 
in the National League that season.[26] New York's win clinched the team's 
fifth postseason berth in franchise history, their first since losing in 
the 1988 National League Championship Series.[27] The playoff berth made 
the Mets the second team in MLB history to make the playoffs after being 
two games back of the leader with three games left to play in the season.[28] 
The Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS in four games.[29] 
This win advanced the Mets to the NLCS where they were defeated by the 
Atlanta Braves in six games.[30] After the defeat, Mets General Manager 
Steve Phillips summed up the harrowing weeks the team had been through 
saying that "we had destiny in our own hands, we lost destiny, we got it 
back in our own hands...We didn't choke. We didn't fold. We won."[31] The 
Mets performance in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with 
the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League 
Championship Series broadcast since 1993.[32] Overall the NLCS averaged 
10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. 
Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued this was a good sign for the future 
of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers 
during their time in the postseason.[32] Bierbaum believed that baseball 
needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to 
draw new audiences and grow viewership.[32] In baseball statistics tie-breakers 
count as regular season games, with all events in them added to regular 
season statistics. For example, Mike Piazza grounded into his 27th double 
play of the season in the 9th inning, adding to his league-leading total.[33] 
Similarly, Leiter's performance advanced his position on several 1999 statistical 
leaderboards including shutouts and walks issued.[34] Reese, Ventura, and 
Ordóñez won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for the season while Piazza and 
Alfonzo won Silver Sluggers.[35] Robin Ventura also finished sixth in Most 
Valuable Player voting, with Chipper Jones taking the award.[6] The New 
York Yankees also made the playoffs in 1999, eventually advancing to the 
1999 World Series where they defeated the Atlanta Braves.[36] Prior to 
the Mets' elimination Mike Lupica noted the possibility of a "Subway Series", 
a term for a World Series played between two New York-based teams.[3] The 
1956 World Series between the Yankees and then-Brooklyn Dodgers was the 
last such Series. Yankees pitcher David Cone told Lupica "I want a Subway 
Series, for selfish reasons. I want to play in one."[3] Although the Mets 
failed to make the Series in 1999 the two met the following year in the 
2000 World Series where the Yankees won in five games.[37] After their 
2000 World Series appearance the Mets did not make the playoffs again until 
2006, where they lost in that NLCS in seven games.[27] Meanwhile, the Reds 
did not place in the top two of their division until returning to the playoffs 
in 2010.[38] Jack McKeon managed the Reds from 1998–2000 and was fired 
after the 2000 season when the team finished 10 games back of the division
