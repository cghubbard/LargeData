Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (often abbreviated Turner Broadcasting, 
TBS, Inc. or simply Turner) is an American media conglomerate and division 
of Time Warner, managing the collection of cable networks and properties 
initiated or acquired by Robert Edward "Ted" Turner III starting during 
the 1970s. TBS, Inc. merged with Time Warner on October 10, 1996, and now 
operates as a semi-autonomous unit of Time Warner. The company's current 
assets include CNN, HLN, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Boomerang, 
TruTV, and HIT Entertainment. The current chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting 
is John K. Martin.[3] The Turner properties are located in both the CNN 
Center in Downtown Atlanta[4] and the Turner Broadcasting campus off Techwood 
Drive in Midtown Atlanta, which also houses Turner Studios.[5] Across Interstate 
75/85 from the Techwood campus is the original home of Turner's WTBS superstation 
(now separated into the TBS cable network and Peachtree TV), which today 
houses Adult Swim and Williams Street Productions. In 1970, Ted Turner, 
then owner of a successful Atlanta-based outdoor advertising company, purchased 
WJRJ-Atlanta, Channel 17, a small, struggling Ultra High Frequency station, 
and renamed it WTCG, for parent company Turner Communications Group. By 
careful programming acquisitions, Turner guided the station to success. 
During December 1976, WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, transmitting 
via satellite to cable systems. On December 17, 1976 at 1:00PM, WTCG Channel 
17's signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems in Grand 
Island, Nebraska; Newport News, Virginia; Troy, Alabama; and Newton, Kansas. 
All four cable systems started receiving the 1948 Dana Andrews - Cesar 
Romero film Deep Waters already in progress. The movie had started 30 minutes 
earlier. WTCG went from being a little television station to a major TV 
network that every one of the 24,000 households outside of the 675,000 
in Atlanta was receiving coast-to-coast. WTCG became a so-called Superstation 
and created a precedent of today's basic cable television. HBO had gone 
to satellite transmissions to distribute its signal nationally in 1975, 
but that was a service cable subscribers were made to pay extra to receive. 
Ted Turner's innovation signaled the start of the basic cable revolution. 
In 1979, the company changed its name to Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. 
(TBS, Inc.) and the call letters of its main entertainment channel to WTBS. 
On June 1, 1980, CNN was launched at 17:00 EST becoming the first 24-hour 
news cable channel. The husband and wife team of Dave Walker and Lois Hart 
news anchored the first newscast, Burt Reinhardt the then executive vice 
president of CNN, hired most of CNN's first 200 employees & 25-member staff 
including Bernard Shaw, the network's first news anchor. In 1981, Turner 
Broadcasting System acquired Brut Productions from Faberge Inc.[6] In 1984, 
Turner initiated Cable Music Channel, his competition for WASEC's MTV. 
The channel was short-lived, but helped influence the original format of 
VH1. In 1986, after a failed attempt to acquire CBS, Turner purchased the 
film studio MGM/UA Entertainment Co. from Kirk Kerkorian for $1.5 billion. 
Following the acquisition, Turner had an enormous debt and sold parts of 
the acquisition. MGM/UA Entertainment was sold back to Kirk Kerkorian. 
The MGM/UA Studio lot in Culver City was sold to Lorimar/Telepictures. 
Turner kept MGM's pre-May 1986 and pre-merger film and TV library, which 
included nearly all of MGM's material made before the merger, and a small 
portion of United Artists' film and TV properties which included few UA 
pictures, the TV series Gilligan's Island (as well as its animated spin-offs), 
the U.S. and Canadian distribution rights to the RKO Radio Pictures library, 
and the pre-1950[7][8][9] Warner Bros. library and the Fleischer Studios/Famous 
Studios Popeye cartoons that both were once the property of Associated 
Artists Productions, which merged with United Artists Television in 1958. 
Turner Entertainment Co. was founded on August 4, 1986. On October 3, 1988, 
the company launched Turner Network Television (TNT). Turner expanded its 
presence in movie production and distribution, first with the 1991 purchase 
of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio.[10] On December 22, 1993, Turner 
acquired Castle Rock Entertainment. Turner purchased New Line Cinema a 
month later.[11][12][13] Turner launched Cartoon Network on October 1, 
1992, followed by Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on April 14, 1994. On October 
10, 1996, Turner merged with Time Warner, a company formed in 1989 by the 
merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. Through this merger, Warner 
Bros. had regained the rights to its pre-1950 library, while Turner gained 
access to the company's post-1950 library and other properties. In 2003, 
Philip I. Kent succeeded Jamie Kellner as chairman. Operational duties 
for The WB were transferred by Time Warner from Warner Bros. to Turner 
Broadcasting during 2001, while Kellner was chairman, but were returned 
to Warner Bros. in 2003 with the departure of Kellner. On February 23, 
2006, the company agreed to sell the regional entertainment channel Turner 
South to Fox Entertainment Group. Fox assumed control of the channel on 
May 1, and on October 13 relaunched it as SportSouth - coincidentally, 
the former name of Fox Sports South when Turner owned this channel in partnership 
with Liberty Media between 1990 and 1996. In May 2006 Time Warner, which 
had owned 50% of Court TV since 1998, purchased the remaining 50% from 
Liberty Media and began running the channel as part of Turner Broadcasting. 
The channel was relaunched as TruTV on January 1, 2008. Also in May 2006, 
Ted Turner attended his last meeting as a board member of Time Warner and 
officially parted with the company. On October 5, 2007, Turner Broadcasting 
System completed the acquisition of Claxson Interactive Pay Television 
Networks in Latin America.[14][unreliable source?] On August 26, 2010 Turner 
Broadcasting took full control of Chilevisión, a TV channel owned by Chile's 
President Sebastián Piñera.[15] On September 8, 2011 Turner Broadcasting 
System acquired LazyTown Entertainment, the producer of the TV series LazyTown.[16] 
On January 1, 2014, John K. Martin succeeded Phil Kent as chairman and 
CEO of Turner Broadcasting.[17] On August 26, 2014, it was reported that 
Turner Broadcasting was preparing to fire 550 people before an NBA rights 
deal.[18] It was further reported in October 2014 that the company planned 
to reduce its workforce by 10% (1,475 people) through layoffs across a 
wide set of units including corporate positions.[19] On August 14, 2015, 
it was announced that Turner Broadcasting had acquired a majority stake 
in iStreamPlanet, a Las Vegas-based video streaming services company, in 
an effort to bolster its over-the-top programming and shift its core technology 
infrastructure to the cloud. iStreamPlanet is a direct competitor of Major 
League Baseball Advanced Media. The deal was reported to be in the neighborhood 
of $200 million.[20] News Movies & Entertainment Terrestrial Broadcasting
