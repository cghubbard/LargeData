As player As manager As coach John Joseph Amalfitano (born January 23, 
1934) is a former utility infielder, manager and coach in Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He played a combined ten seasons with the New York/San 
Francisco Giants (1954–55; 1960–61; 1963), Houston Colt .45s (1962) and 
Chicago Cubs (1964–67), and managed the Cubs from 1979–81. Amalfitano is 
perhaps best known as the Los Angeles Dodgers' third-base coach for sixteen 
years (1983–98), which included the 1988 World Series championship. He 
is currently a special assistant for player development for the San Francisco 
Giants, primarily working in its farm system. A native of San Pedro, California, 
Amalfitano attended Saint Anthony High School in Long Beach, California, 
Loyola University of Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California. 
Because he signed a "bonus contract" when he became a professional player 
in 1954, Amalfitano spent the first two years of his pro career sitting 
on the bench of the New York Giants under the terms of the rule then in 
force. But after four years in the minor leagues, he returned to the National 
League in 1960 and played through the middle of 1967 for the Giants, Houston 
Colt .45s and Chicago Cubs. Amalfitano, a right-handed hitter and thrower, 
stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). In 
642 MLB games played, he batted .244 in 1,715 at bats with 418 hits and 
nine home runs. After playing his final game on June 27, 1967, Amalfitano 
became a coach for the Cubs, serving under his first-ever manager, Leo 
Durocher. He moved back to the Giants as a coach in 1972, then to the San 
Diego Padres from 1976–77, before rejoining the Cubs as a member of Herman 
Franks' staff in 1978–79. Amalfitano served as Chicago's interim manager 
after Franks' resignation in September 1979, compiling a record of 2–5 
to finish the season. That autumn, the Cubs appointed Preston Gómez manager, 
with Amalfitano retained as a coach. But when Chicago started the 1980 
campaign poorly under Gómez, winning only 38 of its first 90 games, he 
was fired July 25 and Amalfitano was named his permanent successor. The 
Cubs won only 26 games, losing 46, to remain in the basement of the National 
League East Division, but Amalfitano was allowed to return for 1981. During 
that strike-shortened, split-season campaign, his team won a total of 38 
games, losing 65, finishing last and next-to-last with the worst overall 
record in the division. At season's end, he was fired during a general 
housecleaning of the Chicago front office. Amalfitano's career record as 
a manager, over all or parts of three seasons with the Cubs, was 66–116 
(.363). However, he remained active in baseball, returning to coaching 
with the Cincinnati Reds (1982) and then spending 16 seasons as the third 
base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1983–98). He then was a consultant 
with the Dodgers' baseball operations department and worked with minor 
league infielders in his original organization, the Giants, before assuming 
his current position with them. His primary role has been to instruct the 
Giants' minor leaguers on baseball fundamentals, especially bunting.[1]
