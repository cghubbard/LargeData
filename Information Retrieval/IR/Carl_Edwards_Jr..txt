Carl Fleming Edwards Jr. (born September 3, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
was formerly known as "C.J." in the minor leagues, where he also earned 
the nickname "The String Bean Slinger" for his skinny physique.[1] Edwards 
was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 48th round of the 2011 Major League 
Baseball Draft out of Mid-Carolina High School in Prosperity, South Carolina.[2] 
Edwards initially committed to play college baseball for the Charleston 
Southern Buccaneers, where he would join a high school teammate and friend. 
However, when that friend died in a car accident, Edwards decided instead 
to pursue professional baseball.[3] He spent his first professional season 
with the Arizona League Rangers and Spokane Indians. He finished the year 
5–3 with a 1.48 earned run average (ERA) and 85 strikeouts over 67 innings 
pitched. He started the 2013 season with the Hickory Crawdads, going 8–2 
with a 1.83 ERA and 122 strikeouts over 93 1⁄3 innings. On July 22, 2013, 
Edwards along with Mike Olt, Justin Grimm, and a player to be named later 
(Neil Ramirez) were traded to the Chicago Cubs for Matt Garza.[4] He was 
sent to the Daytona Cubs, where he had a 1.96 ERA and 33 strikeouts over 
23 innings. After the season he was named the MiLB Pitcher of the Year.[5] 
Prior to the 2014 season, he was ranked by Baseball America as the 28th 
best prospect in baseball.[6] On November 20, 2014, Edwards was added to 
the Cubs 40-man roster, in order to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft. 
On September 7, 2015, Edwards made his Major League debut for the Cubs 
against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium.[7] On September 1, 2016, 
Edwards recorded his first Major League save against the San Francisco 
Giants.[8] Edwards finished the 2016 season with a 3.75 ERA in 35 innings 
pitched.[9] On October 25, 2016, Carl Edwards Jr. along with teammates 
Addison Russell, Dexter Fowler, and Jason Heyward became the first African-Americans 
to play for the Cubs in a World Series game.[10][a] On October 28, 2016, 
he struck out the side in relief duty in the top of the 6th inning vs. 
the Cleveland Indians in game 3 of the World Series at Wrigley Field and 
became the first African-American to pitch for the Cubs in a World Series
