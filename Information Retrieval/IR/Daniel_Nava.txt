Daniel James Nava (born February 22, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball left fielder for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He previously played for the Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim, and Tampa Bay Rays. Nava is only the fourth player in MLB history 
to hit a grand slam in his first major league at bat and the second to 
do it on the first pitch. He throws left-handed and is a switch hitter. 
He wore number 60 to start his career, but had to switch to 66 after being 
demoted, as the Red Sox got a pitcher, Scott Schoeneweis who took 60. He 
later switched to 29, and when he was claimed by Tampa Bay off waivers, 
he chose 7. Nava was born in Redwood City, California. He played baseball 
at St. Francis High School in Mountain View, California[1] and received 
his Psychology degree from Santa Clara University. He was 4 ft 8 in (1.42 m) 
and 70 pounds (32 kg) in his freshman year in high school and grew to 5 ft 
5 in (1.65 m) and 150 pounds (68 kg) by his senior year.[2] After an opportunity 
to walk-on to the Santa Clara University baseball team, he failed to make 
the team as a player and became the team equipment manager.[3] He left 
Santa Clara after two years because he could no longer afford the tuition.[3] 
He then enrolled in the College of San Mateo (junior college).[4] He tried 
out for the baseball team on the encouragement of an old friend he happened 
to run into at a gym.[3] While at the College of San Mateo, he became a 
Junior College All-American. Later Santa Clara wanted him back[5] and eventually 
offered him a full scholarship.[6] He hit .395 with an on-base percentage 
of .494 in his lone season with the Broncos, both tops in the West Coast 
Conference, and earned first-team All-WCC honors. He stole 15 bases without 
being caught, and he had more walks (31) than strikeouts (29).[3] When 
Nava graduated from college, he went undrafted and signed with the Chico 
Outlaws of the Golden Baseball League. The Outlaws cut him after a tryout, 
only to bring him back a year later to fill a void.[3] In 2007 Nava hit 
12 home runs for the Outlaws, with a .371 batting average and a 1.100 OPS.[7] 
Nava was named the number one independent league prospect by Baseball America 
in 2007.[7] Red Sox assistant director of pro scouting, Jared Porter, recommended 
the Sox sign Nava from the Chico Outlaws in 2007.[8] The Red Sox paid the 
Outlaws $1 for the rights to Nava, with an agreement that the Outlaws would 
receive an additional $1,499 if the Red Sox kept Nava after spring training.[9] 
In 2008, Nava played for high Single-A Lancaster and hit .341 with 10 home 
runs and 59 RBI in 85 games. His on-base plus slugging percentage was .948.[10] 
In 2009, he hit .339 at high Single-A Salem before being called up to Double-A 
Portland, where he batted .364 with four home runs and a 25-to-12 walk-to-strikeout 
ratio. His OPS was .991.[11] In 2010, Nava spent two months in AAA.[12] 
At that time he was quoted as saying, "I know I have the talent and the 
ability, and I can keep playing at the next level," he said. "If I didn't 
think I could, I would have been like, ‘You know what? There’s no point.’ 
… I definitely thought I could perform and perform well. That’s why I kept 
on going. Quitting’s just not much of an option for me."[3] Nava made his 
Major League debut with the Boston Red Sox on June 12, 2010 at Fenway Park 
as the starting left fielder against the Philadelphia Phillies. He was 
called up to help with the team's outfield situation, with Jacoby Ellsbury 
and Jeremy Hermida on the disabled list and Josh Reddick optioned to the 
minor leagues for more playing time. Taking the advice of Red Sox radio 
broadcaster Joe Castiglione, who before the game told him to swing as hard 
as he could on the first pitch because "that's the only first pitch in 
the majors you'll ever see," Nava did swing at the first pitch he saw and 
hit a grand slam off Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton into the Red Sox bullpen. 
Nava is only the fourth player to have hit a grand slam in his first at-bat, 
joining Bill Duggleby in 1898, Jeremy Hermida in 2005 and Kevin Kouzmanoff 
in 2006. Nava is only the second player, after Kouzmanoff, to do so on 
the first pitch of his Major League career,[13] and the first player in 
Major League Baseball history to achieve a grand slam on his first-ever 
MLB career at-bat while in interleague play. His second at-bat, an inning 
later, was also with the bases loaded, but he struck out, losing the opportunity 
to become the only player to hit a grand slam in his first two at bats. 
He is the tenth player in Red Sox history to hit a home run in his first 
plate appearance with the club, the last being Darnell McDonald on April 
20, 2010 against the Texas Rangers.[4] Creighton Gubanich is the only other 
player in Red Sox history to hit a grand slam for his first big league 
hit; however, it was not in Gubanich's first Major League at-bat. Bill 
LeFebvre is the only other player in Red Sox history to hit a home run 
on the first pitch thrown to him in the big leagues, doing so June 10, 
1938. Due to his outstanding debut, Nava continued to start for the Red 
Sox. On June 17, he had his first three-hit game, two of those hits being 
doubles, against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Nava reached base safely in 
his first 13 MLB games. Nava was sent back to Triple-A Pawtucket on July 
22, 2010 to make room for Hermida, who came off the DL.[14] He was recalled 
to Boston on August 2, 2010 to replace Mike Cameron, who was placed on 
the DL,[15] then optioned two days later to make room for Ellsbury. On 
August 17, 2010 he was again recalled after Ellsbury re-injured his ribs. 
Nava was designated for assignment and removed from the Red Sox' 40-man 
roster on May 20, 2011.[16] He passed through waivers unclaimed and was 
out-righted back to the Pawtucket Red Sox.[17] Nava was not invited to 
major league training camp in 2012, but was recalled to the major league 
in May of that year, due to the absences of Jacoby Ellsbury and Carl Crawford.[18] 
Nava's debut grand slam was the only major league home run to his credit 
in his first 188 at bats, until May 14, 2012, when he hit a two-run home 
run for the Red Sox at Fenway Park against the Seattle Mariners.[18] In 
88 games played in 2012, Nava batted .243 with 6 home runs and 33 RBI. 
Nava hit a three-run home run which proved to be the winning margin on 
April 20, the first Red Sox home game after the Boston Marathon bombings 
earlier that week.[19] On July 29, 2013, Nava fell victim to a controversial 
call at home plate in which he was ruled out by umpire Jerry Meals, who 
later admitted that the call was incorrect.[20] Nava platooned with Jonny 
Gomes in left field throughout the Red Sox' championship season of 2013, 
posting career highs in games played and all offensive categories. He placed 
eighth in the American League in batting average (.303) and fifth (.385) 
in on-base percentage.[21] With the Red Sox finishing 97-65, the team won 
the AL East and eventually the 2013 World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Despite winning the World Series the previous season, Nava’s batted only 
.136 with 2 homers and 3 RBI in the first 17 games in 2014. He was demoted 
to Triple-A Pawtucket on April 23, 2014. He was recalled on May 27, 2014 
after Shane Victorino went on the disabled list. Nava still failed to improve 
and was again demoted to Triple-A on June 1, 2014. He was again recalled 
on June 2, 2014. On September 14, 2014, Nava hit his second career grand 
slam off of Kansas City Royals pitcher Aaron Crow. On July 30, 2015, Nava 
was designated for assignment after struggling throughout the season with 
injuries and inconsistency at the plate.[22] Nava was claimed off waivers 
by the Tampa Bay Rays on August 5. He made his debut with the Rays two 
days later, facing the New York Mets and starting in right field. Batting 
7th, he went 0 for 2, before being lifted for a pinch hitter. After the 
season he was designated for assignment. Nava signed a one-year deal with 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on December 16, 2015.[23] After spring 
training ended, Nava ended up on the 15-day DL. He was activated towards 
the end of the month of May. After struggling offensively and in a platoon 
role, the Angels designated him for assignment in July. He would finish 
his tenure with the Angels hitting .235 with 1 home run in 45 games. On 
August 29, 2016, the Angels traded Nava to the Royals for a player to be 
named later.[24] Nava's father, Don, is a fitness instructor and a coach.[25] 
Nava got married in the early offseason of 2012. He and his wife, Rachel, 
have one daughter. From 2008 to 2010, he left a ticket at every minor league
