After winning 91 games the previous two seasons, the 1964 Minnesota Twins 
slumped to 79â€“83, a disappointing tie for sixth with the Cleveland Indians 
in the American League, 20 games behind the AL champion New York Yankees. 
On May 2, in Kansas City, Missouri, Tony Oliva, Bob Allison, Jimmie Hall 
and Harmon Killebrew hit consecutive 11th-inning home runs, to tie a major 
league record first set by the Milwaukee Braves in 1961 and duplicated 
by the Cleveland Indians in 1963. The Twins finished the year with 221 
homers, their second-best total ever. On July 15, new Twin Mudcat Grant 
allowed thirteen singles and a walk in facing the Washington Senators. 
None would score, and Grant gets a shutout, 6-0. Five Twins made the All-Star 
Game: first baseman Bob Allison, outfielders Harmon Killebrew, Jimmie Hall 
and Tony Oliva and pitcher Camilo Pascual. Tony Oliva became the first 
black player in the history of the American League to win the AL Rookie 
of the Year award.[2] He led the major leagues in hits (217), extra base 
hits and total bases. He led the American League in batting average (.323), 
runs scored (109) and doubles. Six Twins hit 20 or more home runs: Harmon 
Killebrew (49 HR, 111 RBI), Tony Oliva (32 HR, 96 RBI, 109 runs), Bob Allison 
(32 HR, 86 RBI), Jimmie Hall (25 HR, 75 RBI), Don Mincher (23 HR, 56 RBI), 
and Zoilo Versalles (20 HR, 94 runs). Jim Kaat led the Twins with 17 wins 
and won his third Gold Glove; Camilo Pascual again led the Twins in strikeouts 
with 213.[3] 1,207,514 fans attended Twins games, the third highest total 
in the American League. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Infielders
