Fredbird is the official mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals major league 
baseball team. He is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team's uniform. 
Fredbird can always be found entertaining young children during baseball 
games at Busch Stadium. His name is derived from "Redbird", a synonym for 
the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves. Fredbird was introduced 
in April 6, 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain 
younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his 
dancing, habit of "beaking" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts 
into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by "Team Fredbird", 
a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt 
toss and occasionally in other duties. He can also be seen rallying the 
crowd regularly during pregame on-field ceremonies, and, occasionally, 
he finds time to sit behind (or on top of) the dugout to get the crowd 
going. After every Cardinal home victory, Fredbird takes a flag with the 
team's logo onto the field and waves it around. He is one of baseball's 
best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in 
the St. Louis area. Fredbird can also be seen on television once a week,
