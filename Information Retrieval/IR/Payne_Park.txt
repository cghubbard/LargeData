stood from 1924 to 1990 and to the public park in the same location which 
replaced it, in Sarasota, Florida. Payne Park, the original stadium for 
the city of Sarasota, was built on a portion of 60 acres (240,000 m2) of 
land donated by Calvin Payne and his wife, Martha.[2] Payne Park today 
refers to the 29-acre (120,000 m2) public park – the location of the ballpark 
– used for recreational and high school sporting events. The ballpark was 
erected in 1924 and was a long time spring training and minor league site 
for baseball clubs such as the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and the 
New York Giants. The park ceased its association with professional baseball 
in 1989 with the construction of Ed Smith Stadium and the ballpark was 
demolished. Until 1963, the ballpark's dimensions were 375 feet (114 m) 
down the foul-lines and 500 feet (150 m) to center-field.[3] The ballpark 
was refurbished on multiple occasions. Prior to Spring Training 1951, the 
City of Sarasota added 600 permanent bleachers increasing capacity to just 
over 4,000. The size of the press-box was doubled as well.[4] The White 
Sox moved their spring training games from Tampa to Sarasota in 1960. Prior 
to spring training 1963, The City of Sarasota changed the ballpark's dimensions 
to 352 feet (107 m) down the foul-lines and 415 feet (126 m) to center 
field to match the White Sox' Comiskey Park dimensions.[5] The Chicago 
White Sox and Texas Rangers played the last major league spring training 
game at Payne Park on March 30, 1988. The City of Sarasota reopened the 
former ballpark-site as Payne Park on October 6, 2007 as a 29-acre (120,000 m2) 
public park space. The public park was built at a cost of $8.8 million, 
funded by a county-wide penny surtax.[6] It features Public Skateboard 
Park, Frisbee Golf Course, tracks for walking and riding bikes, lakes and 
a Cafe serving lunches and refreshments. In 2012 the city opened the "circus 
Playground, featuring a small waterpark Public Restrooms on site Coordinates:
