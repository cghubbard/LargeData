The Cuban X-Giants were an African-American professional baseball team 
that played from 1896 to 1906. Originally most of the players were former 
Cuban Giants, or ex-Giants. Like the Cuban Giants, the original players 
were not Cuban (though the team would later sign Cuban players). Edward 
B. Lamar Jr. served as business manager for the team. In 1897 the X-Giants 
beat the Cuban Giants in a series 2 games to 1. With Frank Grant joining 
in 1898 the club continued to establish themselves as the new powerhouse 
in the east. Grant and White left in 1900 and Bill Monroe joined at second 
base; both the Giants and X-Giants claimed to be the champions, a situation 
that was duplicated a year later. In 1903 the club boasted Rube Foster 
on the mound and a middle infield of Charlie Grant and Home Run Johnson. 
They played in the integrated Tri-State Independent League and then took 
5 of 7 games from the Philadelphia Giants for the title as top black team 
in the east. Foster won 4 games in the series and also was 6 for 17 at 
the plate. For the 1904 season the Philadelphia Giants signed away Grant 
and Foster, and later beat the X-Giants in a championship series 2 games 
to 1, as Foster won two games against his old teammates. (Grant and Foster 
replaced Frank Grant and Harry Buckner as regulars.) In 1905 the X-Giants 
took one of two games from the National League's Brooklyn, outscoring them 
7–2 in the first game and losing 2–1 in the second.[1] In 1906, the X-Giants 
signed John Henry Lloyd for his first season in professional baseball, 
and the team joined the International League of Independent Professional 
Base Ball Clubs. In late 1906, the Cuban X-Giants became a founding member 
of the National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States
