Lapta (Russian: лапта́) is a Russian bat and ball game first known to be 
played in the 14th century.[1] Mentions of lapta have been found in medieval 
manuscripts, and balls and bats were found in the 14th-century layers during 
excavations in Novgorod. It is similar to cricket, brännboll, Rounders, 
baseball, oină, it:Tsan (Italy) and pesäpallo. The game is played outside 
on a field the size of half a football pitch[2] 20 x 25 sazhens (140 feet 
(43 m) x 175 feet (53 m)). There are 5 people on the field from the defending 
team, as well as pitcher/server.[2] This pitcher server stands near the 
batter of the opposing team and hits a ball in the direction of the batter.[2] 
The team that bats contains six people.[2] Each hitter gets 2 chances to 
hit the ball over a 10m line.[2] If they succeed at that, the runners can 
go to an endline at the other end of the pitch.[2] If a player manages 
to run between the two endpoints, they get 2 points.[2] A game lasts an 
hour, split into two equal halves.[2] The edges of the field were marked 
with parallel lines, called salo. The goal of the game is to hit the ball, 
served by a player of the opposite team, with the bat and send the ball 
as far as possible, then run across the field to the kon line, and if possible 
to run back to the gorod line. The running player should try to avoid being 
hit with the ball, which is thrown by the opposing team members. For successful 
runs, the team earns points. A team wins by either getting more points 
during the scheduled time or by having all its players complete runs. A 
description of lapta is given by Aleksandr Kuprin: This folk game is one 
of the most interesting and useful games. Lapta requires resourcefulness, 
deep breathing, faithfulness to your group, attention, dexterity, fast 
running, good aiming and marksmanship, strong striking hands, and firm 
eternal confidence that you cannot be defeated. The lazy and cowardly have 
no place in this game. According to Russian magazines Little Light and 
Izvestia, baseball was developed from lapta by 18th century Russian Americans.[3][4]
