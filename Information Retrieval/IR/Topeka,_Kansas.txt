Topeka (/toʊˈpiːkə/;[9][10] Kansa: Tó Pee Kuh) is the capital city of the 
U.S. state of Kansas and the seat of Shawnee County.[2] It is situated 
along the Kansas River in the central part of Shawnee County, located in 
northeast Kansas, in the Central United States. As of the 2010 census, 
the city population was 127,473.[11] The Topeka Metropolitan Statistical 
Area, which includes Shawnee, Jackson, Jefferson, Osage, and Wabaunsee 
counties, had a population of 233,870 in the 2010 census. The name Topeka 
is a Kansa-Osage sentence that means "place where we dug potatoes",[12] 
or "a good place to dig potatoes".[13] As a placename, Topeka was first 
recorded in 1826 as the Kansa name for what is now called the Kansas River. 
Topeka's founders chose the name in 1855 because it "was novel, of Indian 
origin and euphonious of sound."[14][15] The mixed-blood Kansa Native American, 
Joseph James, called Jojim, is credited with suggesting the name of Topeka.[16] 
The city, laid out in 1854, was one of the Free-State towns founded by 
Eastern antislavery men immediately after the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska 
Bill. In 1857, Topeka was chartered as a city. The city is well known for 
the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 
which overturned Plessy vs. Ferguson and declared racial segregation in 
public schools to be unconstitutional.[17] Three ships of the U.S. Navy 
have been named USS Topeka after the city. For many millennia, the Great 
Plains of North America were inhabited by Native Americans. From the 16th 
century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large 
parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France 
secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. In 
1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 
7,500 square miles. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was 
acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square 
mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In the 1840s, wagon trains 
made their way west from Independence, Missouri, on a journey of 2,000 
miles (3,000 km), following what would come to be known as the Oregon Trail. 
About 60 miles (97 km) west of Kansas City, Missouri, three half Kansas 
Indian sisters married to the French-Canadian Pappan brothers established 
a ferry service allowing travelers to cross the Kansas River at what is 
now Topeka.[18] During the 1840s and into the 1850s, travelers could reliably 
find a way across the river, but little else was in the area. In the early 
1850s, traffic along the Oregon Trail was supplemented by trade on a new 
military road stretching from Fort Leavenworth through Topeka to the newly 
established Fort Riley. In 1854, after completion of the first cabin, nine 
men established the Topeka Town Association. Included among them was Cyrus 
K. Holliday, an "idea man" who would become mayor of Topeka and founder 
of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Soon, steamboats were regularly 
docking at the Topeka landing, depositing meat, lumber, and flour and returning 
eastward with potatoes, corn, and wheat. By the late 1860s, Topeka had 
become a commercial hub providing many Victorian era comforts. After a 
decade of abolitionist and pro-slavery conflict that gave the territory 
the nickname Bleeding Kansas, Kansas was admitted to the Union in 1861 
as the 34th state. Topeka was finally chosen as the capital, with Dr. Charles 
Robinson as the first governor. In 1862, Cyrus K. Holliday donated a tract 
of land to the state for the construction of a state capitol. Construction 
of the Kansas State Capitol began in 1866. It would take 37 years to build 
the capitol, first the east wing, and then the west wing, and finally the 
central building, using Kansas limestone. In fall 1864 a stockade fort, 
later named Fort Simple, was built in the intersection of 6th and Kansas 
Avenues to protect Topeka, should Confederate forces then in Missouri decide 
to attack the city. It was abandoned by April 1865 and demolished in April 
1867. State officers first used the state capitol in 1869, moving from 
Constitution Hall, what is now 427-429 S. Kansas Avenue. Besides being 
used as the Kansas statehouse from 1863 to 1869, Constitution Hall is the 
site where anti-slavery settlers convened in 1855 to write the first of 
four state constitutions, making it the "Free State Capitol." The National 
Park Service recognizes Constitution Hall - Topeka as headquarters in the 
operation of the Lane Trail to Freedom on the Underground Railroad, the 
chief slave escape passage and free trade road. Although the drought of 
1860 and the ensuing period of the Civil War slowed the growth of Topeka 
and the state, Topeka kept pace with the revival and period of growth that 
Kansas enjoyed from the close of the war in 1865 until 1870. In the 1870s, 
many former slaves known as Exodusters, settled on the east side of Lincoln 
Street between Munson and Twelfth Streets. The area was known as Tennessee 
Town because so many of them were from that state. The first African American 
Kindergarten west of the Mississippi was organized in Tennessee Town by 
Dr. Charles Sheldon, pastor of the Central Congregational Church in 1893.[19] 
Lincoln College, now Washburn University, was established in 1865 in Topeka 
by a charter issued by the State of Kansas and the General Association 
of Congregational Ministers and Churches of Kansas. In 1869, the railway 
started moving westward from Topeka, where general offices and machine 
shops of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad system were established 
in 1878. During the late 1880s, Topeka passed through a boom period that 
ended in disaster. There was vast speculation on town lots. The 1889 bubble 
burst and many investors were ruined. Topeka, however, doubled in population 
during the period and was able to weather the depressions of the 1890s. 
Early in the 20th Century, another kind of boom, this time the automobile 
industry, took off, and numerous pioneering companies appeared and disappeared. 
Topeka was not left out. The Smith Automobile Company was founded there 
in 1902, lasting until 1912. Home to the first African-American kindergarten 
west of the Mississippi River, Topeka became the home of Oliver Brown, 
the named plaintiff in Brown v. Board of Education which was the case responsible 
for eliminating the standard of "separate but equal", and requiring racial 
integration in American public schools. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported 
Topeka's population as 91.8% white and 7.7% black.[20] At the time the 
suit was filed, only the elementary schools were segregated in Topeka, 
and Topeka High School had been fully integrated since its inception in 
1871. Furthermore, Topeka High School was the only public high school in 
the city of Topeka. Other rural high schools existed at that time, such 
as Washburn Rural High School—created in 1918—and Seaman High School—created 
in 1920. Highland Park High School became part of the Topeka school system 
in 1959 along with the opening of Topeka West High School in 1961. A Catholic 
high school —Assumption High School, later renamed Capitol Catholic High 
School, then in 1939 again renamed, to Hayden High School after its founder, 
Father Francis Hayden — also served the city beginning in 1911.[21] Monroe 
Elementary, a segregated school that figured in the historic Brown v. Board 
of Education decision, through the efforts of The Brown Foundation working 
with the Kansas Congressional delegation place in the early 1990s, is now 
Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. The Brown Foundation 
is largely responsible for the content of the interpretive exhibits at 
the Historic Site. The National Historic Site was opened by President George 
W. Bush on May 17, 2004. Topeka has struggled with the burden of racial 
discrimination even after Brown. New lawsuits attempted unsuccessfully 
to force suburban school districts that ring the city to participate in 
racial integration with the inner city district. In the late 1980s a group 
of citizens calling themselves the Task Force to Overcome Racism in Topeka 
formed to address the problem in a more organized way. On June 8, 1966, 
Topeka was struck by an F5 rated tornado, according to the Fujita scale. 
It started on the southwest side of town, moving northeast, passing over 
a local landmark named Burnett's Mound. According to a local Indian legend, 
this mound was thought to protect the city from tornadoes if left undisturbed. 
A few years prior to the tornado strike saw development near the mound 
including a water tank constructed near the top of the mound against the 
warnings of local Native Americans. The tornado went on to rip through 
the city, hitting the downtown area and Washburn University. Total dollar 
cost was put at $100 million making it, at the time, one of the most costly 
tornadoes in American history. Even to this day, with inflation factored 
in, the Topeka tornado stands as one of the most costly on record. It also 
helped bring to prominence future CBS and A&E broadcaster Bill Kurtis, 
who became well known for his televised admonition to "take cover, for 
God's sake, take cover" on WIBW-TV during the tornado. (The city is home 
of a National Weather Service Forecast Office that serves 23 counties in 
north-central, northeast, and east-central Kansas). Topeka recovered from 
the 1966 tornado and has sustained steady economic growth. Washburn University, 
which lost several historic buildings from the tornado, received financial 
support from the community and alumni to rebuild many school facilities. 
Today, university facilities offer more than one million square feet of 
modern academic and support space. In 1974, Forbes Air Force Base closed 
and more than 10,000 people left Topeka, influencing the city's growth 
patterns for years to come. During the 1980s, Topeka citizens voted to 
build a new airport and convention center and to change the form of city 
government. West Ridge Mall opened in 1988, replacing the White Lakes Mall 
which opened in 1964. In 1989 Topeka became a motorsports mecca with the 
opening of Heartland Park Topeka. The Topeka Performing Arts Center opened 
in 1991. In the early 1990s the city experienced business growth with Reser's 
Fine Foods locating in Topeka and expansions for Santa Fe and Hill's Pet 
Nutrition. During the 1990s voters approved bond issues for public school 
improvements including magnet schools, technology, air conditioning, classrooms, 
and a sports complex. Voters also approved a quarter-cent sales tax for 
a new Law Enforcement Center, and in 1996 approved an extension of the 
sales tax for the East Topeka Interchange connecting the Oakland Expressway, 
K-4, I-70, and the Kansas Turnpike. During the 1990s Shawnee county voters 
approved tax measures to expand the Topeka and Shawnee County Public Library. 
The Kansas Legislature and Governor also approved legislation to replace 
the majority of the property tax supporting Washburn University with a 
countywide sales tax. In 2000 the citizens again voted to extend the quarter-cent 
sales tax, this time for the economic development of Topeka and Shawnee 
County. In August, 2004, Shawnee County citizens voted to repeal the 2000 
quarter-cent sales tax and replace it with a 12- year half-cent sales tax 
designated for economic development, roads, and bridges. Each year the 
sales tax funds provide $5 million designated for business development 
job creation incentives, and $9 million for roads and bridges. Planning 
is under way to continue to redevelop areas along the Kansas River, which 
runs west to east through Topeka. In the Kansas River Corridor through 
the center of town, Downtown Topeka has experienced apartment and condominium 
loft development, and façade and streetscape improvements. On the other 
side of the river, Historic North Topeka has benefited from a major streetscape 
project and the renovated Great Overland Station, regarded as the finest 
representation of classic railroad architecture in Kansas. The Great Overland 
Station is directly across the river from the State Capitol, which is undergoing 
an eight-year, $283 million renovation. On March 1, 2010, Topeka Mayor 
Bill Bunten issued a proclamation calling for Topeka to be known for the 
month of March as "Google, Kansas, the capital city of fiber optics."[22] 
The name change came from Ryan Gigous, who wanted to "re-brand" the city 
with a simple gesture.[23] This was to help "support continuing efforts 
to bring Google's fiber experiment" to Topeka, though it was not a legal 
name change. Lawyers advised the city council and mayor against an official 
name change.[24] Google jokingly announced that it would change its name 
to Topeka to "honor that moving gesture" on April 1, 2010 (April Fools 
Day) and changed its home page to say Topeka.[25] In its official blog, 
Google announced that this change thus affected all of its services as 
well as its culture, e.g. "Googlers" to "Topekans", "Project Virgle" to 
"Project Vireka", and proper usage of "Topeka" as an adjective and not 
a verb, to avoid the trademark becoming genericized.[26] Topeka is located 
at 39°03′N 95°41′W﻿ / ﻿39.050°N 95.683°W﻿ / 39.050; -95.683,[2] in north 
east Kansas at the intersection of I-70 and U.S. Highway 75. It is the 
origin of I-335 which is a portion of the Kansas Turnpike running from 
Topeka to Emporia, Kansas. Topeka is also located on U.S. Highway 24 (about 
50 miles east of Manhattan, Kansas) and U.S. Highway 40 (about 30 miles 
west of Lawrence, Kansas). U.S.-40 is coincident with I-70 west from Topeka. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 61.47 square miles (159.21 km2), of which, 60.17 square miles (155.84 km2) 
is land and 1.30 square miles (3.37 km2) is water.[5] In 2007, Forbes Magazine 
named Topeka as one of the leading U.S. cities in terms of having the greatest 
variations in temperature, precipitation, and wind.[27] Topeka lies in 
the transition between a humid continental (Köppen climate classification 
Dfa) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with hot, somewhat humid 
summers and cool to cold, fairly dry winters, and is located in USDA Plant 
Hardiness Zone 6.[28] Over the course of a year, the monthly daily average 
temperature ranges from 29.7 °F (−1.3 °C) in January to 79.0 °F (26.1 °C) 
in July. The maximum temperature reaches 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 41.5 
days per year and reaches 100 °F (38 °C) an average of 3.5 days per year. 
The minimum temperature falls below 0 °F (−18 °C) an average of 4 nights 
per year, and there are 21 days per year that stay below freezing.[29] 
The average window for freezing temperatures is October 15 through April 
17.[29] The area receives nearly 36.5 inches (930 mm) of precipitation 
during an average year, with the largest share being received in May and 
June—the April through June period averages 33 days of measurable precipitation. 
Generally, the spring and summer months have the most rainfall, with autumn 
and winter being fairly dry. During a typical year the total amount of 
precipitation may be anywhere from 25 to 47 inches (64 to 119 cm). Much 
of the rainfall is delivered by thunderstorms. These can be severe, producing 
frequent lightning, large hail, and sometimes tornadoes. There are an average 
of 100 days of measurable precipitation per year. Winter snowfall is light, 
as is the case in most of the state, as a result of the dry, sunny weather 
patterns that dominate Kansas winters, which do not allow for sufficient 
moisture for significant snowfall. Winter snowfall averages almost 17.8 in 
(45 cm). Measurable (≥0.1 in or 0.25 cm) snowfall occurs an average of 
12.9 days per year, with at least one inch (2.5 cm) of snow being received 
on five of those days. Snow depth of at least an inch occurs an average 
of 20 days per year.[29] As of the census[6] of 2010, there were 127,473 
people, 53,943 households, and 30,707 families residing in the city. The 
population density was 2,118.5 inhabitants per square mile (818.0/km2). 
There were 59,582 housing units at an average density of 990.2 per square

African American, 1.4% Native American, 1.3% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 
4.7% from other races, and 4.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino 
of any race were 13.4% of the population. Non-Hispanic Whites were 69.7% 
of the population in 2010,[20] down from 86.3% in 1970.[20] There were 
53,943 households of which 29.5% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 37.9% were married couples living together, 14.2% had a female

The per capita income for the city was $19,555. About 8.5% of families 
and 12.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 16.7% 
of those under age 18 and 8.2% of those age 65 or over. Being the state's 
capital city, Topeka's largest employer is the State of Kansas—employing 
about 8,400 people,[35] or 69% of the city's government workers. Altogether, 
government workers make up one out of every five employed persons in the 
city.[36] The educational, health and social services industry makes up 
the largest proportion of the working population (22.4%[36]). The four 
school districts employ nearly 4,700 people, and Washburn University employs 
about 1,650.[35] Three of the largest employers are Stormont-Vail HealthCare 
(with about 3,100 employees), St. Francis Health Center (1,800), and Colmery-O'Neil 
VA Hospital (900).[35] The retail trade employs more than a tenth of the 
working population (11.5%[36]) with Wal-Mart and Dillons having the greater 
share. Nearly another tenth is employed in manufacturing (9.0%[36]). Top 
manufacturers include Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Payless ShoeSource, 
Hill's Pet Nutrition, Frito-Lay, and Jostens Printing and Publishing. Jostens 
announced plans in May 2012 to move production from its Topeka facility 
to Clarksville, Tennessee, affecting approximately 372 employee positions. 
Southwest Publishing & Mailing Corporation, a smaller employer, has its 
headquarters in Topeka. Other industries are finance, insurance, real estate, 
and rental and leasing (7.8%); professional, scientific, management, administrative, 
and waste management services (7.6%); arts, entertainment, recreation, 
accommodation and food services (7.2%); construction (6.0%); transportation 
and warehousing, and utilities (5.8%); and wholesale trade (3.2%).[36] 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas is the largest insurance employer, 
with about 1,800 employees.[35] BNSF Railway is the largest transportation 
employer, with about 1,100.[35] Westar Energy employs nearly 800.[35] About 
a tenth of the working population is employed in public administration 
(9.9%[36]). Other major companies based in Topeka include: Topeka is sometimes 
cited as the home of Pentecostalism as it was the site of Charles Fox Parham's 
Bethel Bible College, where glossolalia was first claimed as the evidence 
of a spiritual experience referred to as the baptism of the Holy Spirit 
in 1901. It is also the home of Reverend Charles Sheldon, author of In 
His Steps, and was the site where the famous question "What would Jesus 
do?" originated in a sermon of Sheldon's at Central Congregational Church. 
The First Presbyterian Church in Topeka is one of the very few churches 
in the U.S. to have its sanctuary completely decorated with Tiffany stained 
glass (another is St. Luke's United Methodist in Dubuque, Iowa). The other 
is the Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Cumberland, Maryland. There is a large 
Roman Catholic population, and the city is home to nine Roman Catholic 
parishes, five of which feature elementary schools. Grace Cathedral of 
the Episcopal Diocese of Kansas is a large Gothic Revival structure located 
in the city. Topeka also has a claim in the history of the Baha'i Faith 
in Kansas. Not only does the city have the oldest continuous Baha'i community 
in Kansas (beginning in 1906), but that community has roots to the first 
Baha'i community in Kansas, in Enterprise, Kansas in 1897. This was the 
second Baha'i community in the western hemisphere. Topeka is home of the 
Westboro Baptist Church, a hate group according to the Southern Poverty 
Law Center.[38] The church has garnered world-wide media attention for 
picketing the funerals of U.S. servicemen and women for what church members 
claim as "necessary to combat the fight for equality for gays and lesbians." 
They have sometimes successfully raised lawsuits against the city of Topeka. 
CW Porubsky's Deli & Tavern's chili "has been a lure to north Topeka since 
(...) 1951".[39][40][41] The restaurant has been called "a landmark as 
significant as the state Capitol" for many Kansans.[42] In 2009 a documentary 
short film, Transcendent Deli, was made about the restaurant, focussing 
on its chili and pickles.[42] In 2014 Travel + Leisure named it one of 
America's Best Chilis.[43] Topeka is the home of a daily newspaper, the 
Topeka Capital-Journal, and a bi-weekly newspaper, The Topeka Metro News. 
The following radio stations are licensed to Topeka: AM FM Additionally, 
most of the Kansas City stations provide at least grade B coverage of Topeka. 
KANU-FM in Lawrence (in the Kansas City market) serves as Topeka's NPR 
member station as well. The following television stations are licensed 
to Topeka: The Chief Executive Officer of the City of Topeka is City Manager 
Jim Colson.[4] The City Manager is responsible to the City Council of Topeka. 
The City Council consists of the Mayor and nine members elected from separate 
districts within the city. The city council members select the Deputy Mayor 
from amongst themselves who chairs the Committee of the Whole and represents 
the City of Topeka at official functions when the Mayor is unavailable. 
The city manager guides the council through the meetings and does not have 
the ability to vote.[48] Although Topeka experienced problems with crime 
in the 1990s, the city's crime rates have improved in the past decade. 
The city is now breaking trends when it comes to violent crime, so much 
so that it has gained the interest of researchers from Michigan State University. 
Topeka set a record in 1993 with 24 homicides. The city broke that record 
the next year in 1994 with 28. Since 2000, most cities with a population 
greater than 100,000 have seen an increase in violent crimes. Topeka's 
crime rates are decreasing. Researchers credit good communication between 
law enforcement agencies, informed media outlets, and strong community 
involvement for Topeka's success. Topeka was one of four cities, along 
with Chicago, Tampa, and El Monte, California, to be studied. Overall, 
crime in Topeka was down nearly 18 percent in the first half of 2008, compared 
with the same period of 2007. Topeka police reported a 6.4 percent drop 
in crime from 2007 to 2008, including significant reductions in business 
robberies and aggravated assaults and batteries, as well as thefts.[49] 
On October 11, 2011, the Topeka city council agreed to repeal the ordinance 
banning domestic violence in an effort to force the Shawnee County District 
Attorney to prosecute the cases.[50] Shawnee County District Attorney Chad 
Taylor said that the DA "would no longer prosecute misdemeanors committed 
in Topeka, including domestic battery, because his office could no longer 
do so after county commissioners cut his budget by 10 percent."[50] The 
next day, Taylor said that his office would "commence the review and filing 
of misdemeanors decriminalized by the City of Topeka."[51] The same day 
it was announced that 17% of the employees in the District Attorney's office 
would be laid off.[52] Topeka is served by four public school districts 
including: Topeka is also home to several private and parochial schools 
such as Topeka Collegiate and Cair Paravel-Latin School. There are also 
elementary and junior high schools supported by other Christian denominations. 
Hayden High School, a Catholic high school is also located in Topeka, as 
well as Cornerstone Family Schools, a non-denominational Christian organization 
that offers junior and senior high school athletics to home school families 
in the northeast Kansas area. Cornerstone's mascot is "the Saints". Topeka 
has several colleges, universities and technical schools including Washburn 
University, Friends University, Washburn Institute of Technology (Formerly 
Kaw Area Technical School), and the Baker University School of Nursing. 
The now defunct College of the Sisters of Bethany and Bethel Bible College 
both once called Topeka their home. Topeka has two major hospitals, Stormont-Vail 
and St. Francis Hospital. Both are located in central Topeka. Topeka is 
also home to the Colmery-O'Neil VA Medical Clinic. I-70, I-470, and I-335 
all go through the City of Topeka. I-335 is part of the Kansas Turnpike 
where it passes through Topeka. Other major highways include: US-24, US-40, 
US-75, and K-4. Major roads within the city include NW/SW Topeka Blvd. 
SW Wanamaker Road. N/S Kansas Ave. SW/SE 29th St. SE/SW 21st St. SE California 
Ave. SW Gage Blvd. and SW Fairlawn Rd. Topeka Regional Airport (FOE) formerly 
known as Forbes Field is located in south Topeka in Pauline, Kansas. Forbes 
Field also serves as an Air National Guard base, home of the highly decorated 
190th Air Refueling Wing. Manhattan Regional Airport (MHK) located in Manhattan, 
Kansas is the next closest commercial airport; Kansas City International 
Airport (MCI) in Kansas City is the closest major airport. Philip Billard 
Municipal Airport (TOP) is located in the Oakland area of Topeka Passenger 
rail service provided by Amtrak stops at the Topeka Station. Current service 
is via the Chicago-to-Los Angeles Southwest Chief during the early morning 
hours and makes intermediate stops at Lawrence and Kansas City. The Kansas 
Department of Transportation has asked Amtrak to study additional service, 
including daytime service to Oklahoma City.[53] Freight service is provided 
by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and Union Pacific Railroad 
as well as several short line railroads throughout the state. Greyhound 
Lines provides bus service westward towards Denver, Colorado, eastward 
to Kansas City, Missouri, southwest to Wichita, Kansas.[54] Local transit
