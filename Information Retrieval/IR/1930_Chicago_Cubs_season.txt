The 1930 Chicago Cubs season was the 59th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 55th in the National League and the 15th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished second in the National League with a record of 90â€“64. In the peak 
year of the lively ball era, the Cubs scored 998 runs, third most in the 
majors. Future Hall of Famers Kiki Cuyler, Gabby Hartnett, and Hack Wilson 
led the offense. Hack Wilson set a major league record for most RBIs in 
one season with 191.[1] Wilson's 1930 season was considered one of the 
best ever by a hitter. In addition to hitting 56 home runs, leading the 
league with 105 walks, and boasting a batting average of .356, he drove 
in 191 runs, a mark that remains one of the most untouchable MLB records. 
(For years, record books gave the total as 190, until research in 1999 
showed that an RBI credited by an official scorer to Charlie Grimm actually 
belonged to Wilson.) He recorded that total without hitting a grand slam.
