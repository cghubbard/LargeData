The New York Black Yankees were a professional Negro league baseball team 
based in New York City, Paterson, NJ, and Rochester, NY which played in 
the Negro National League from 1936 to 1948.[1] The Black Yankees played 
in Paterson, New Jersey from 1933-1937 and then from 1939-1945. The 1938 
season saw the Black Yankees trying their fate at New York's Triborough 
Stadium. Paterson's strong fan support returned the Black Yankees to Paterson's 
Hinchliffe Stadium. The team was founded in Harlem as the Harlem Black 
Bombers in 1931 by financier James "Soldier Boy" Semler and dancer Bill 
"Bojangles" Robinson. The team's left fielder Fats Jenkins was chosen by 
fans to play in the East team for the first East-West All-Star Game in 
1933. A succession of other players were sent to the big game in 1937–1942, 
1947 and 1948.[2] The team's schedule could be punishing. In the 1930s 
they played two doubleheaders 350 miles apart on successive days. They 
left Pittsburgh after the first two games at about 10:00 PM to cross the 
Allegheny Mountains for South Orange, New Jersey. One of the two cars broke 
down so nine of the 16 players crowded into the other car to ensure that 
play would start on time. They arrived just twenty minutes behind the scheduled 
start time. They were given five minutes to warm up. The other seven players 
arrived a few minutes later so they were able to lunch and sleep before 
taking two of their exhausted team mates to play the second game. Despite 
their fatigue, the team won both games.[3] In September 1933, the New York 
Black Yankees played the Philadelphia Stars for the Colored Championship 
of the Nation at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, New Jersey. They lost 
the championship, but not their momentum, opening the following season 
with an eight-game winning streak at Hinchliffe Stadium. The streak-ending 
ninth game with the Pittsburgh Crawfords came on July 28, 1934, a face-off 
that saw Hall-of-Famers Josh Gibson, Judy Johnson, James “Cool Papa” Bell, 
and Oscar Charleston all play in regular-season tilt. Rain ended the game 
after 7 1/2 innings, but not before Crawfords’ star Gibson and Yankee Bob 
Clark had both hit powerful home runs, Gibson’s contributing to his League 
championship home run record for that year. On July 13, 1935, Elmer McDuffy 
pitched an 8-0 no-hitter at Hinchliffe Stadium against the House of David. 
According to the Paterson Evening News, it was “the first time such a feat 
had ever been turned in by the Negro club in this territory.” The team 
played its last season, 1948, in Rochester, New York using Red Wing Stadium, 
home of the International League Rochester Red Wings, as their home park. 
After an opening day doubleheader sweep of the Newark Eagles on May 25, 
1948, the team did not fare well and finished the last Negro National League
