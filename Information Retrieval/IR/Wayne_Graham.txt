Wayne Leon Graham (born April 6, 1936) is a former major-league baseball 
player and the head coach of the Rice Owls baseball team in Houston, Texas. 
He has coached one College World Series championship team and five NJCAA 
World Series champions. Graham was born in Yoakum, Texas. His father, Earl 
moved the family to Houston to get a job.[1] Wayne was the batboy for the 
1945 semipro Finger Furniture baseball team coached by his father.[2] Graham 
attended Reagan High School in Houston and played college baseball at the 
University of Texas,[3] where he played two seasons under coach Bibb Falk. 
Graham was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent 
in 1957.[4] He played eleven years as a professional with the Philadelphia 
Phillies and New York Mets organizations, including brief major-league 
stints in 1963 and 1964. He was named Texas minor league player of the 
year in 1962 after hitting .311 for Dallas-Fort Worth. Graham was called 
up to the Phillies in 1963 and played in 10 games under manager Gene Mauch. 
One year later, Graham appeared in twenty games for the Mets under legendary 
Casey Stengel. When his playing career ended, Graham returned to the University 
of Texas to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education in 
1970, and he later added a Master's Degree in education at the University 
of Houston in 1973. His coaching career began at Scarborough High School 
in Houston. Graham coached for nine seasons at Scarborough and one year 
at Spring Branch High School before moving on to coach junior college baseball 
at San Jacinto College in Houston. Beginning in 1981, Graham turned San 
Jacinto into the nation's most dominant JUCO baseball team. After regular 
conference titles in Graham's first few seasons, the Gators became a dominant 
force in 1984 when they began a run of seven consecutive 50-win seasons 
and berths in the NJCAA World Series in Grand Junction, Colorado. After 
losing in the 1984 championship game, San Jacinto won three consecutive 
titles from 1985–87. After falling short again in 1988, the Gators went 
back-to-back in 1989–90. Those five national titles in six years eventually 
led to Graham being named Junior College Coach of the Century by Collegiate 
Baseball. In his 11 seasons at San Jacinto, Graham posted a 675-113 record 
(.857 win percentage), earned five national coach of the year awards and 
produced countless professional players, most notably Roger Clemens and 
Andy Pettitte. Graham took over at Rice in 1992. He inherited a program 
that had tallied only seven winning seasons in 78 years of Southwest Conference 
play, and had only finished above fourth place once. As at San Jac, he 
turned the program into a national powerhouse. A program that had never 
before qualified for the NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament has made 21 
consecutive tournament appearances (1995–2015) and 20 consecutive regular-season 
or tournament conference championships (1996–2015) in three different conferences 
(Southwest Conference, Western Athletic Conference, Conference USA). Rice 
has also been to the College World Series seven times (1997, 1999, 2002, 
2003, 2006, 2007, 2008). Graham's crowning achievement was the 2003 College 
World Series, in which Rice won its first national championship in any 
sport in its 91-year history. Not one to rest on his laurels, Graham quipped 
during a post-game interview, "We want to do it again." One year later, 
Graham once again presided over history, as three Rice pitchers were drafted 
in the first eight picks of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft, the only 
time three teammates have ever been selected in the first round. Graham's 
Rice teams have produced first-round picks Jose Cruz, Jr. (1995), Matt 
Anderson (1997), Lance Berkman (1997), Bubba Crosby (1998), Kenny Baugh 
(2001), Jon Skaggs (2001), David Aardsma (2003), Philip Humber (2004), 
Jeff Niemann (2004), Wade Townsend (2004, 2005), Joe Savery (2007) and 
Anthony Rendon (2011). Eight of those players have been pitchers, and Graham 
is known for developing players that went undrafted out of high school, 
such as Niemann and Townsend. Graham was also largely responsible for Rice's 
on-campus baseball stadium, Reckling Park, being built in 2000. The facility 
seats more than 5,000 fans and is one of the finest in the country. Now 
in his 80s, Graham is one of the most quotable coaches in baseball. On 
April 16, 2016, Graham won his 1,100th Division I game (3-2, over Western 
Kentucky ). He has more than 1,600 wins as a collegiate head coach.[5] 
He has never had a losing season in 38 years as a high school or college 
coach. Below is a table of Graham's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball
