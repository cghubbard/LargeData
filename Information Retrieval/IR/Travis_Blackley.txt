Travis Jarrod Blackley (born 4 November 1982) is an Australian professional 
baseball pitcher for the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League. 
Previously, he has pitched for the Kia Tigers of the Korea Baseball Organization 
and for several Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. Blackley was signed 
by the Seattle Mariners as an undrafted free agent on 29 October 2000. 
He began his professional career with the Single-A Everett AquaSox in 2001. 
He had a 6–1 record with a 3.32 ERA in 14 starts. He also had 90 strikeouts 
in 78⅔ innings and held opponents to a .211 batting average. He pitched 
for the Single-A San Bernardino Stampede in 2002, going 5–9 and 3.49 in 
21 games, starting all but one. He had 152 strikeouts in 121.1 innings, 
second among all Mariner minor leaguers. He was promoted to the Double-A 
San Antonio Missions in 2003, the most impressive of his minor league career. 
He led the Texas League with 17 wins; was second in ERA (2.61), fourth 
in strikeouts (144) and fourth in innings pitched (162.1). His 17 wins 
were the most by a Texas League pitcher since Jeff Reardon of the Jackson 
Mets in 1978. He pitched in the Texas League postseason All-Star game and 
was named to the World squad in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game at U.S. 
Cellular Field on 15 July. The Mariners also named him their minor league 
pitcher of the year. In 2004, Baseball America designated him as #63 out 
of the top 100 minor league prospects, the third best prospect in the Mariners' 
system behind pitchers Félix Hernández and Clint Nageotte and their top 
left-handed prospect. He began the season with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers. 
The Mariners, after trading Freddy García to the Chicago White Sox, needed 
another starter and purchased Blackley's contract on 1 July 2004. He made 
his major league debut on that same day against the Texas Rangers and beat 
them, allowing 4 runs on 6 hits in 5⅔ innings. He became just the sixth 
Mariner pitcher in the team's history to start and win his major league 
debut. After spending a month with the major league club going only 1–3 
with a 10.04 ERA in 6 starts, Blackley was optioned back to Triple-A Tacoma 
on 1 August 2004. He had an 8–6 record with a 3.83 ERA in 19 games (18 
starts) with Tacoma in 2004 before ending the season on the disabled list 
with left shoulder tendinitis. He missed the entire 2005 season recovering 
from left shoulder surgery. In March 2006, Blackley was slated to play 
in the World Baseball Classic with team Australia but was scratched to 
continue rehabbing his shoulder. He spent most of 2006 with Double-A San 
Antonio. After going 8–11 and 4.06 in 25 starts in Double-A, he was promoted 
back to Triple-A Tacoma at the end of August where he made 2 starts going 
1–1 and 4.09. On 1 April 2007, after spring training, he was traded to 
the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Jason Ellison and was immediately 
optioned to Triple-A Fresno, pitching the entire season in the minor leagues 
with the Grizzlies. He went 10–8 with a 4.66 ERA in 28 starts. He was recalled 
on 21 September, and on 23 September made his first major league start 
since 31 July 2004 against the Cincinnati Reds. He won his Giant debut, 
giving up two runs in the first inning and three hits in five innings, 
walking four and striking out five. After being outrighted off the San 
Francisco roster on 6 December 2007, Blackley was selected by the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the major league portion of the Rule 5 draft. Philadelphia 
put him on waivers towards the end of 2008 spring training. The Giants 
did not reclaim him, and the Phillies outrighted him to Triple-A Lehigh 
Valley. He became a free agent at the end of the season. On 19 December 
2008, he signed a major league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[1] 
On 1 April 2009, the D'backs outrighted him to Triple-A Reno.[2] Blackley 
began the 2010 season with the New York Mets' AAA affiliate Buffalo Bisons, 
but the Mets released him on 2 May. On 13 May 2010, he signed with the 
Oakland Athletics who assigned him to their Triple-A affiliate, the Sacramento 
River Cats. Travis then made the 35-man roster of the Melbourne Aces for 
the inaugural Australian Baseball League season. On 2 December 2010, he 
was activated onto the 22-man roster and made his debut for the Aces on 
5 December starting against the Sydney Blue Sox and pitching a rain-shortened 
one-hit shutout. He had previously played for the Victoria Aces in the 
Australian semiprofessional Claxton Shield. He ended up with the KIA Tigers 
in the Korea Baseball Organization in 2011. In 25 appearances, he had a 
record of 7 wins and 5 losses with an ERA of 3.48. On 16 February 2012, 
he signed a minor-league contract with the San Francisco Giants with an 
invitation to spring training.[3] On 1 May, the Giants purchased his contract 
and called him up from Triple-A Fresno. He pitched 4 games in relief for 
the Giants before being designated for assignment on 13 May. Two days later, 
on 15 May 2012, the Oakland Athletics claimed him off waivers and signed 
him. He made his first appearance for the A's on 18 May in relief against 
the Giants. On 28 May, he started his first game for the team, against 
the Twins, and was added to the starting rotation. He finished with a 6-4 
record and a 3.86 ERA for the season with the A's. On 4 April 2013, the 
Oakland Athletics traded Blackley to the Houston Astros for outfielder 
Jake Goebbert. He was designated for assignment on 9 August 2013. On 14 
August 2013, the Houston Astros traded Blackley to the Texas Rangers for 
a player to be named later. Ironically, Blackley's first appearance with 
the Rangers was against the Astros on 20 August 2013. Blackley started 
and pitched 4 innings, allowing 2 runs, as the Rangers won 4-2. Blackley 
signed with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in December 2013.[4] On January 
12, 2015, Blackley signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco 
Giants. On April 25, 2015, Blackley announced that he had signed a minor 
league deal with the Miami Marlins.[5] Blackley signed with the Brisbane 
Bandits of the Australian Baseball League for the 2015 season. On April 
19, 2016, Blackley signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball 
League. Blackley was first selected for Australia in the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic, but did not play due to an ongoing shoulder injury (as cited above). 
He debuted for Australia in the 2007 Baseball World Cup and went 0–1 and 
1.64 ERA for the tournament, his only loss coming against the Japan national 
baseball team when Tadashi Settsu threw a shutout against Australia in 
the quarter-final, with Australia finishing 5th. He again pitched for Australia 
in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, earning a no-decision against Cuba 
and a 1.59 ERA for the tournament. He played for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo 
of the Mexican Pacific League in 2009 to 2011 Blackley is divorced from
