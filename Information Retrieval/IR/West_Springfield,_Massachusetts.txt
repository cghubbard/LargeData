West Springfield is a city[3] in Hampden County, Massachusetts, United 
States. It is part of the Springfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical 
Area. The population was 28,391 at the 2010 census. The city is also known 
as "West Side", in reference to the fact that it is on the western side 
of the Connecticut River from Springfield, a fact which played a major 
part in the town's early history. In paraphrase, from the official town 
history book... The area that became known as West Springfield was settled 
in 1635. The settlers fled to higher ground on the east side of the river 
and founded Springfield in the aftermath of the great hurricane of 1635. 
West Springfield was good farm land, so some families did stay on the west 
side. Other than the trade in beaver skins, economic activity in early 
colonial Springfield consisted largely of subsistence farming and animal 
husbandry, with barter being the preferred medium of exchange for neighbors' 
crops, and locally produced goods. Gristmills and saw mills were also present 
in the early settlement.[4] Because the Connecticut River was too wide 
to be bridged at the time, crossings had to be made by boat. The Hay Place 
was created between the current town common and East School Street,[5] 
for people who farmed or mowed on land grants on the west side to leave 
their crops while they awaited transport back to the eastern side. By the 
1650s some English settlers had begun living full-time on the western side 
of the river, probably near what is now Riverdale Road, across from the 
Chicopee River.[6] Early in that decade, Springfield had made a provision 
that any able-bodied man (and his work animals) could be required to work 
up to six eight-hour days on local roads (the barter economy equivalent 
of an infrastructure tax). In 1666, the west side residents complained 
about having to work on east side roads while their own were not well taken 
care of. After considerable dispute, it was determined that the men of 
the settlement would tend the roads on their own sides of the river.[7] 
In many ways, the distinction between the church and the state in the early 
New England town form of government was fuzzy, though religious and secular 
meetings were held separately and generally led by different people. For 
the early settlers of Springfield, attendance at both town meetings and 
weekly Congregational church services (often both held in the town "meeting 
house") in the early settlement were mandatory, and this was enforced by 
fines.[8] For several decades, West Side residents requested accommodation 
from the town in the form of a free ferry service, but were refused by 
town meeting and even by arbitrators from Northampton and Hadley.[8] In 
March 1683, Reice Bedortha, his son John, John's wife Lydia, and their 
newborn Mercy, were drowned on the Connecticut on their way to church when 
their boat capsized.[9] The west side residents renewed their complaints 
and began to demand their own church meeting house. On 29 May 1697, the 
Massachusetts General Court finally approved a separate parish and meeting 
house for the approximately 200 residents.[10] West side parishes were 
also created for Agawam (1696), Feeding Hills (1800),[11] and Holyoke ("North 
Parish" or "Ireland Parish" named for early Irish settlers John and Mary 
Riley; created at some point before 1831). The Massachusetts Bay Colony 
passed a law in 1647 requiring the construction of a public school in any 
town with 50 or more families. In 1706 after two years of petitioning, 
west side residents were granted funds for the construction of a school 
(though west side students might have been home-schooled before that time).[12] 
In 1707, the west side parish was delegated from Springfield town meeting 
the right to grant land in its territory.[12] Given the continuing need 
to cross the Connecticut River to attend town meetings, and east-west tension 
over resource allocation, the west side residents petitioned the Massachusetts 
General Court to be incorporated as a separate town in 1756. After a particularly 
contentious town meeting in 1773 which bounced between meeting houses on 
opposite shores and nearly resulted in a year-long government shutdown, 
proposals for partition were eventually sent from both sides to the colonial 
legislature. On 23 February 1774, West Springfield was incorporated as 
a separate town, with territory including what is now Agawam and most of 
Holyoke.[13] Another dispute was immediately created when the charter of 
the town prevented it from taxing the property of Springfield residents 
within its boundaries. This law was later changed to apply only until such 
property was sold, but the last such parcel did not become taxable by West 
Springfield until the 1860s.[14] West Springfield minutemen participated 
in the American Revolutionary War beginning on April 20, 1775, the day 
after the Battles of Lexington and Concord.[15] In 1777, a major contingent 
of Hessian and British troops were captured at the Battle of Saratoga and 
transported to Boston (for possible deportation or imprisonment). While 
encamped in West Springfield, some of the German mercenaries stayed and 
married into the local population.[16] Economic conditions after the Revolution 
led to Shays' Rebellion in Springfield and West Springfield in 1786-87. 
Technological advancements allowed the first bridge to be built across 
the Connecticut River in 1805. It was a toll bridge built on stone pilings; 
the roadway heaved up and down as it passed over six arch-shaped spans. 
This bridge was damaged by spring floods in 1814, and after a partial collapse 
under heavy traffic, was demolished. In 1816, a replacement bridge opened 
at Bridge Street. It was destroyed in 1818 by spring ice, despite a valiant 
attempt to keep it from being washed downstream by tying it to a tree. 
(The cable snapped.) A third bridge built on the same foundations, was 
in use for over 100 years, and known as the "Old Toll Bridge", though tolls 
were removed in 1873.[17] The modern Memorial Bridge was opened in 1922; 
it underwent a major overhaul in the 1990s. The first North End Bridge 
opened 1887 with a sturdy metal box-shaped truss (the upper part of the 
box being suspended above the roadway. In 1923, the tar-sealed wooden decking 
caught fire, which was made worse by the gas mains the bridge carried. 
The replacement bridge at this location is still in use.[18] A wooden toll 
bridge was built to Chicopee from Riverdale (at the base of Wayside Avenue 
- formerly Bridge Street - and Ashley Avenue) in 1847, but burned down 
in 1903.[19] Several crossings of the Westfield River were built in the 
19th century, but most were destroyed by floods. Several highway bridges 
were also constructed in the late 20th century. The warnings of the Agawam 
Indians proved true[clarification needed] in 1647, 1767, 1801, 1804, and 
1818. Civil War-era dikes held back high water in the Agawam River in 1878, 
but heavy rain flooded the town again in 1927. Both heavy rains and a large 
snowmelt brought an even more massive flood in 1936, with 8,000 people 
were displaced in the town of 17,000. The area's bridges survived; the 
railroad bridge being weighed down by a fully loaded freight train intentionally 
parked across it. The New England Hurricane of 1938 flooded crops along 
Riverdale Road and severely damaged the Exposition grounds, causing the 
fair to close for the season. It also opened a hole in the dike at Mosley 
Avenue, which was repaired before the rain waters could once again flood 
the lower section of town.[20] Yet another major flood struck in 1955, 
knocking out the town's drinking water facilities in Southwick and destroying 
Bear Hole Dam, Piper Reservoir, and Memorial Pool (all of which were rebuilt).[21] 
Winter weather has also caused significant damage at times during West 
Springfield's history. The Great Blizzard of 1888 dropped over 5 feet (1.5 m) 
of snow, with 20-foot (6.1 m) drifts.[22] There have also been more recent 
blizzards in 1978 and 1996. On June 1, 2011, a tornado touched down in 
West Springfield, crossed the Connecticut River, and then devastated the 
City of Springfield, Massachusetts. The 2011 Springfield Tornado devastated 
densely populated parts of West Springfield, causing two fatalities in 
the city - including a mother who died while shielding her 15-year-old 
daughter.[23] U.S. President Barack Obama declared the area surrounding 
West Springfield and Springfield a federal disaster area.[24] On October 
29, 2011, a snow storm dumped more than ten inches of wet snow on the town 
and the surrounding area. Snow clung to trees which still had most of their 
leaves. The result was the falling of trees and limbs on homes, vehicles, 
powerlines and roadways. It took more than one week for some homes to have 
power restored. Agriculture continued to dominate the local economy when 
market gardening started in the 1830s, concentrating in the Riverdale Road 
area. These crops were intended to be sent to market for cash, rather than 
to be used by the farming family for themselves or to barter for other 
crops. Growing population and improved transportation links increased the 
size of the potential market; by 1860, West Springfield was using greenhouses 
and exporting fresh crops to Boston. Agriculture remained an important 
part of the West Springfield economy for many decades, but land development 
and economic changes led to a decline, and by the 1940s, it was a minor 
activity in the town.[25] The Eastern States Exposition started in 1917 
as a reaction against the slow decline of New England agriculture. The 
annual fall fair is by far West Springfield's largest tourist attraction 
and one of the largest fairs in the country. The exposition grounds host 
many events on a year-round basis. The first Morgan Horse was bred in West 
Springfield in 1789-90.[26] Light manufacturing began to grow in the 19th 
century, including tanned hides, horse carriages, gunpowder, ceramics, 
industrial pipes, hats, and boats.[27] When the Industrial Revolution reached 
Western Massachusetts in the 19th century, the region's many fast-moving 
rivers resulted in a mill town boom. Early textile and paper mills were 
staffed by Irish famine immigrants who nearly doubled their population 
in the town between 1840 and 1860. Paper manufacturing became a major regional 
industry, including within the town limits included (mostly clustered on 
the Agawam River) the Southworth Paper Company (1839), the Agawam Paper 
Company (1859), the Agawam Canal Company, the Springfield Glazed Paper 
Company (1882), the Worthy Paper Company (1892), the Mittineague Paper 
Company (1892, later known as the Strathmore Paper Company and acquired 
by International Paper[28]) The Western Railroad opened for freight and 
passenger service in 1841, connecting West Springfield to Worcester, Boston, 
the Berkshires, and upstate New York. It would become the Boston and Albany 
Railroad in 1870. Travel time from Boston to Albany was considerably reduced 
from the over 40 hours it took by stagecoach in the 1820s.[29] The covered 
wooden railroad bridge across the Connecticut which opened in 1841, was 
replaced by the current double-track steel truss railroad bridge in 1874.[30] 
West Springfield became a major transportation hub, and the railroad became 
one of the largest employers in the town for many decades. Repair shops 
were also built in West Springfield in 1896,[31] and at the peak of operations, 
there were two major rail yards - one in Mittineague, and one near the 
present-day Memorial Avenue. The original horsecar trolley, operated by 
the Springfield Street Railway, opened in 1877 from Main Street in Springfield 
to Elm and Park Streets, via Main Street and the old toll bridge at Bridge 
Street. It was later extended via Westfield Street to (Upper) Church Street. 
Electrification was completed in 1892-3, and the river crossing was moved 
to the original North End Bridge. Over the years, extensions were made 
to the Holyoke Street Railway (via Riverdale Road, 1895), Tatham (1896) 
the Woronoco Street Railway (in Westfield, 1899), the Connecticut border 
via Riverside Park (now Six Flags New England) in Agawam (1900), Feeding 
Hills (1902), and eventually the Suffield Street Railway in Connecticut 
(making the Hartford-West Side Line possible, 1905).[32] The destruction 
of the old North End Bridge in 1923 saw relocation of the trolley crossing 
to the modern Memorial Bridge. But trolley passenger service was cut starting 
in 1924 and by 1936, completely eliminated. Present-day local and intercity 
mass transit is provided by Pioneer Valley Transit Authority bus routes, 
Amtrak, and private bus carriers. Peter Pan Bus Lines is headquartered 
in Springfield. Conversion from steam to diesel locomotives shut down the 
West Springfield repair shop in 1956.[33] With the rise of the automobile, 
the West Springfield (Mittineague) passenger railroad station closed in 
1957.[34] Amtrak service is still available to Springfield, and the central 
rail yard is still in active use for freight by CSX, the present-day successor 
of this part of the Boston & Albany. Rural Free Delivery started delivering 
postal mail to residents' homes in the late 19th or early 20th century. 
A major power plant for the Western Massachusetts Electric Company (now 
a subsidiary of Northeast Utilities) went online in West Springfield in 
1949.[35] Even more substantial canal and mill development took place in 
the "North Parish" or "Ireland Parish" of West Springfield, which was favorably 
located near Hadley Falls. The parish was incorporated as the independent 
town of Holyoke, Massachusetts in 1850. The area mainly south of the Westfield 
River, including the parishes of Agawam and Feeding Hills, was incorporated 
as the independent town of Agawam, Massachusetts in 1855. U.S. Route 5 
(currently, also known as Riverdale Road) was modified to bypass the downtowns 
of Springfield and West Springfield as new segments were constructed on 
the West Springfield and Agawam waterfronts in 1938, 1941–42, and 1952-53. 
This resulted in some land takings and cutting off certain neighborhoods 
from the river, but north-south travel was speeded, and the dike system 
was reinforced to prevent the flooding of these neighborhoods. The approaches 
to the North End and Memorial Bridges were modified to accommodate the 
new traffic patterns. The Massachusetts Turnpike was constructed from 1955 
to 1957. Interstate 91 was constructed over a dozen years, from 1958 to 
1970, following considerable controversy over whether it should be placed 
in West Springfield, as originally planned, or in Springfield, as that 
city's planners wished.[36] The original plan for Interstate 91 - detailed 
in the 1953 Master Highway Plan for the Springfield, Massachusetts, Metropolitan 
Area - called for Interstate 91 to occupy an enlarged U.S. Route 5 in West 
Springfield - the route which had, historically, been used to reach West 
Springfield and Springfield from both the north and the south. Between 
1953 and 1958, Riverdale Road was widened in places, added on to, and numerous 
businesses were closed and moved back, or to other parts of West Springfield 
to make way for Interstate 91, which was planned to connect with Springfield 
via numerous bridges.[37] The original plan for I-91 would have likely 
benefitted West Springfield, which already had U.S. 5 passing through, 
causing travelers to patronize many of West Springfield's businesses[citation 
needed]. In 1958, however, Springfield's city planners - seemingly without 
regard for West Springfield's economy, or foresight for their own city's 
economy - campaigned vociferously for Interstate 91 to occupy Springfield's 
riverfront. Their reasoning at the time was that Springfield, being a more 
populous city than West Springfield, should have a major highway routed 
through it. Indeed, Springfield's 1958 city planners advocated that the 
construction of I-91 on Springfield's riverfront would catalyze economic 
growth comparable to that experienced during the great railroad expansion 
of the mid-19th century.[38] Although West Springfield had a right and 
legal claim to Interstate 91, Massachusetts highway officials relented 
to Springfield's intense pressure when confronted with a technicality: 
a short, existing section of US 5 through West Springfield that was built 
in 1952-53 failed to meet Interstate design standards. Thus the plans for 
I-91 in West Springfield were shelved, and moved to the east bank of the 
river in Springfield, where an elevated highway was designed (as opposed 
to the planned ground-grade highway in West Springfield.) After Interstate 
91 was constructed in Springfield, that city did not experience anything 
like the prosperity boom predicted by its city planners in 1958. I-91's 
construction in Springfield coincided with the beginning of that city's 
four decades of decline. Unlike West Springfield's U.S. 5, Springfield's 
I-91 was constructed in an area where there had never been highway traffic 
or businesses that catered to such traffic. Due to I-91's proximity to 
both Springfield's densely built downtown and the city's riverfront, there 
has never been enough space in Springfield to build more than a few of 
these businesses. Thus Springfield never received the economic benefit 
that it expected from I-91 - and which, according to recent academic assessments 
by the UMass School of Urban Design, West Springfield would have.[39] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 17.5 square 
miles (45.4 km²), of which 16.8 square miles (43.4 km²) is land and 0.8 square 
mile (2.0 km²) (4.50%) is water. It is on the west side of the Connecticut 
River, across from Springfield, and on the north side of the Westfield 
River, above Agawam. West Springfield is bordered on the west by linear 
cliffs of volcanic trap rock known as East Mountain. They are part of the 
Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from 
Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. Both are traversed by the 
110-mile (180 km) Metacomet-Monadnock Trail. West Springfield is located 
27 miles (43 km) away from Hartford, 90 miles (140 km) away from Boston, 
85 miles (137 km) from Albany, 48 miles (77 km) away from Pittsfield and 
134 miles (216 km) from New York City. Other major geographical features 
include: Numbered routes passing through the town include: There are no 
airports in West Springfield, the nearest airport with commercial passenger 
flights is Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, 
though there are other military and general aviation airports in the area. 
As for transportation, several bus lines on the Pioneer Valley Transit 
Authority bus system service West Springfield from routes crossing over 
from Springfield: As of the census[54] of 2010, there were 28,391 people, 
11,757 households, and 7,117 families residing in the city. The population 
density was 1,665.7 people per square mile (643.1/km²). There were 12,259 
housing units at an average density of 731.9 per square mile (282.6/km²). 
The racial makeup of the city was 90.68% White, 3.30% African American, 
0.22% Native American, 1.97% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 2.94% from 
other races, and 2.10% from two or more races. 5.75% of the population 
were Hispanic or Latino of any race. There were 11,823 households out of 
which 27.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.7% were 
married couples living together, 11.4% had a female householder with no 
husband present, and 39.8% were non-families. 34.0% of all households were 
made up of individuals and 11.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family 
size was 3.02. In the city the population was spread out with 23.4% under 
the age of 18, 7.8% from 18 to 24, 29.6% from 25 to 44, 23.2% from 45 to 
64, and 15.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 
years. For every 100 females there were 95.2 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 91.2 males. The median income for a household 
in the city was $40,266, and the median income for a family was $50,282. 
Males had a median income of $38,082 versus $28,079 for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $20,982. About 8.7% of families and 11.9% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.0% of those 
under age 18 and 7.3% of those age 65 or over. West Springfield was originally 
governed by an open town meeting, and then a representative town meeting 
starting in 1922.[56] The town meetings were presided over by the town 
moderator. The city is now governed by a mayor and town council starting 
on April 1, 2000. West Springfield is one of fourteen Massachusetts municipalities 
that have applied for, and been granted, city forms of government but wish 
to retain "The town of” in their official names.[57] The first mayor who 
held office was Edward Gibson, who stayed in office for five consecutive 
terms. Greg Neffinger, was elected mayor on November 8, 2011, but lost 
his bid for re-election in a 2 to 1 landslide to Edward C Sullivan on November 
5, 2013. West Springfield has its own school district, police department, 
fire department, library, department of public works, health department, 
and department of parks and recreation. West Springfield Fire Department 
was created in 1883[58] and current has 11 apparatus serving out of one 
fire hall. The school district has controlled by an independent school 
committee since 1827[59] and maintains a central high school, middle school, 
and a number of elementary schools. The first town funds budgeted for police 
enforcement were in 1877; the force has gradually become professionalized, 
motorized, and equipped with and dedicated offices and jail facilities.[60] 
Semi-public "subscription" libraries operated from 1775–1807 and 1810-1840. 
The current collection began in 1854, but was later made free to the public. 
The West Springfield Public Library was established in 1864.[61][62] It 
moved from the town hall to a dedicated building in 1915, constructed with 
a donation from Andrew Carnegie. An addition was opened in 1959.[63] In 
fiscal year 2008, the city of West Springfield spent 0.91% ($765,760) of 
its budget on its public library—some $27 per person.[64] West Springfield 
has many schools. Nine of them are public schools, while the rest are private 
schools. The schools are run by the city's school system (West Springfield 
Public Schools). The West Springfield High School teaches Grades 9-12. 
The West Springfield Middle School teaches Grades 6-8. Four of the Elementary 
Schools teach 1st through 5th grade, while Coburn Elementary teaches Kindergarten 
and Grades 1-5, John Ashley School teaches Pre-School and Kindergarten. 
The town's school athletic teams are called the "Terriers" Other schools 
include: Coburn Elementary School was built in 1923/4 as West Springfield 
Junior High School and added to in 1928/9, operating as a grade 7-8 junior 
high school. Cowing School was opened as the town's first stand-alone high 
school in 1915, and when the new high school on Piper Rd. opened in 1956 
it became Cowing Junior High School, serving grades 7-8 as well. As West 
Springfield moved to the middle-school format, Coburn and Cowing assumed 
their current functions. Three elementary schools - John Ashley, Memorial, 
and Tatham - were opened in 1952 to accommodate the post-war baby boom. 
Additionally, John R. Fausey School was built in 1960 and added to in 1962. 
West Springfield High School was moved from the Cowing building in 1956 
to Piper Road. A significant addition opened in 1966. A new West Springfield 
High School building is under construction to the north of the existing 
building and is scheduled to open in February 2014. After the construction 
of the first high school on Piper Road, Cowing School was originally slated 
for demolition, but the new high school had been under-built for the surging 
student population, and 9th graders were moved to Cowing from 1960 until 
the high school addition opened in 1966. From 1966 to 1981, Cowing School 
served as a junior high school. With the passage of the Proposition 2-1/2 
referendum in 1980, the school budget was tightened, priorities were reexamined, 
and numerous schools were closed or consolidated in the fall of 1981. Before 
the opening of West Springfield Middle School in 1998, the town struggled 
with increased enrollment. West Springfield Middle School opened in 1998 
for grades 6-8. West Springfield is considered to be part of the Springfield-Hartford 
Knowledge Corridor. With easy access to the north-south Interstate 91, 
east-west Massachusetts Turnpike, and various freight railroads, West Springfield 
is sometimes called the "crossroads of New England". The Riverdale Road 
corridor is a major regional shopping center, with a number of "big box" 
retail stores and car dealerships. The Eastern States Exposition is a major 
seasonal employer. There are only a few parks in the city: There are two 
shopping malls in West Springfield: There is only one local newspaper, 
the weekly (every Thursday) town newspaper West Springfield Record was 
founded in 1953 with circulation about 5500. All other print media are 
regional papers such as the Springfield Republican. There is no local television 
or radio stations, the closest is in Springfield. The ABC (USA) TV series 
"Complete Savages" (2004-05) was set in West Springfield. Common references
