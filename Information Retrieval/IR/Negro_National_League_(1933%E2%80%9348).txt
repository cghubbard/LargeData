The second Negro National League was one of the several Negro leagues created 
during the time organized baseball was segregated. The second Negro National 
League was established in 1933, two years after the first Negro National 
League (NNL) had disbanded.[1] The second NNL lasted until 1948, the year 
after Major League Baseball integrated, after which its surviving teams 
merged into the Negro American League.[2] †The Brooklyn Eagles and Newark 
Dodgers merged to form the Newark Eagles in 1936. From 1937 and 1938, 1940, 
and 1942 through 1946, the team in first place at the end of the season 
was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule 
(and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many 
more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed 
championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with 
the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) 
was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most 
victories. The "games behind" method of recording standings was uncommon 
in most black leagues. † – Pennant was decided via a split-season schedule 
with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the 
second half of the season. * – Pennant was decided via a 2-round play-off 
between the top four teams. ‡ – Pennant winner went on to play in the Negro 
World Series. From 1925 through 1928, and again in 1930, the NNL split 
the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner 
of the second half for the league Pennant. As mentioned above, disputes 
also occurred in the split season finishes. For the duration of the league, 
a Negro World Series took place seven times, from 1942 through 1948. The 
NNL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro American League.
