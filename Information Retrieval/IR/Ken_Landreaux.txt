Kenneth Francis Landreaux (born December 22, 1954 in Los Angeles, California) 
is a former center fielder in Major League Baseball. After graduating from 
Dominguez High School in Compton, California, Landreaux was drafted by 
the Houston Astros in the 8th round, but chose to attend Arizona State 
University. While at Arizona State, he played in the 1975 and 1976 College 
World Series on teams that included future major leaguers Floyd Bannister, 
Chris Bando, and Bob Horner. He was then selected by the California Angels 
in the first round of the 1976 amateur draft. In 1979, the promising young 
Landreaux was traded with 3 other players by the Angels to the Minnesota 
Twins for Rod Carew. In his Major League debut with the California Angels 
(September 11, 1977, against the Chicago White Sox), Landreaux threw out 
three base runners from the outfield.[1] In 1980 Landreaux set a Minnesota 
record with a 31-game hitting streak, the longest in the AL since Dom DiMaggio's 
34 in 1949.[2] He still holds the record for most consecutive games with 
a hit in Minnesota Twins history. Landreaux was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for three prospects (Mickey Hatcher and two minor leaguers) in 
1981 [2] where he remained, completing his professional baseball career 
in 1987. Landreaux is a cousin of former major league third baseman Enos 
Cabell. Landreaux was a member of the 1981 World Series champion Los Angeles 
Dodgers, and caught the final out of the 1981 World Series, a fly ball 
to center field off the bat of Bob Watson. Landreaux's best seasons were 
1982 and 1983. Usually batting 2nd in the order, he combined with leadoff 
man Steve Sax to give the Dodgers two formidable "table setters." Landreaux 
hit over .280 and had at least 30 stolen bases in each of those seasons 
. He also hit a career high 17 home runs for the 1983 National League Western 
Division champion Dodgers. Ken now spends his time teaching young baseballers
