Waterbury (nicknamed "The Brass City") (pronounced WƆ́-tər-bɛ̀ri) is a 
city in the U.S. state of Connecticut on the Naugatuck River, 33 miles 
(45 minutes) southwest of Hartford and 77 miles (90 minutes) northeast 
of New York City. Waterbury is located in New Haven County, Connecticut. 
As of the 2010 census, Waterbury had a total population of 110,366,[2] 
making it the 10th largest city in the New York Metropolitan Area, 9th 
largest city in New England and the 5th largest city in Connecticut.[3] 
Throughout the first half of the 20th century Waterbury had large industrial 
interests and was the leading center in the United States for the manufacture 
of brassware (including castings and finishings), as reflected in the nickname 
the "Brass City" and the city's motto Quid Aere Perennius? ("What Is More 
Lasting Than Brass?"). It was noted for the manufacture of watches and 
clocks. The city is located along Interstate 84 (Yankee Expressway) and 
Route 8 and has a Metro-North railroad station with connections to Grand 
Central Terminal. Waterbury is also home to Post University and the regional 
campuses of the University of Connecticut, University of Bridgeport, Western 
Connecticut State University as well as Naugatuck Valley Community College. 
The land was originally inhabited by Native Americans and according to 
Samuel Orcutt's history, the colonial settlers of Waterbury "found it expedient 
to purchase the same lands from different tribes, without attempting to 
decide between their rival claims."[4] The original settlement of Waterbury 
in 1674 was in the area now known as the Town Plot section. In 1675, the 
turbulence of King Philip's War caused the new settlement to be vacated 
until the resumption of peace in 1677, the following colony was west of 
the first settlement. The original Algonquin inhabitants called the area 
"Matetacoke" meaning "the interval lands." [5] Thus, the settlement's name 
was Anglicised to "Mattatuck" in 1673. When the settlement was admitted 
as the 28th town in the Connecticut Colony in 1686,[6] the name was changed 
to Waterbury in reference to the numerous streams that emptied into the 
Naugatuck River from the hills on either side of the valley. At that time, 
it included all or parts of what later became the towns of Watertown, Plymouth, 
Wolcott, Prospect, Naugatuck, Thomaston, and Middlebury. Growth was slow 
during Waterbury's first hundred years, the lack of arable land due to 
the constant flooding of the Naugatuck River in particular, discouraged 
many potential settlers. Furthermore, the residents suffered through a 
great flood in 1691[7] and an outbreak of disease in 1712. After a century, 
Waterbury's population numbered just 5,000.[8] Waterbury emerged as an 
early American industrial power in the early 19th century when the city 
began to manufacture brass, harnessing the waters of the Mad River and 
the Naugatuck River to power the early factories.[9][10] The new brass 
industry attracted many immigrant laborers from all over the world, leading 
to an influx of diverse nationalities.[11] Waterbury was incorporated as 
a city in 1853 and, as the "Brass Capital of the World", it gained a reputation 
for the quality and durability of its goods. Brass and copper supplied 
by Waterbury was notably used in Nevada's Boulder Dam and found myriad 
applications across the United States, as well. Another famous Waterbury 
product of the mid-19th century was Robert H. Ingersoll's one-dollar pocket 
watch, five million of which were sold. After this, the clock industry 
became as important as Waterbury's famed brass industry. Evidence of these 
two important industries can still be seen in Waterbury, as numerous clocktowers 
and old brass factories have become landmarks of the city. In June 1920, 
labor unrest occurred in the town, with striking workers fighting with 
police on the street. Over 30 were arrested, mostly Lithuanians, Russians, 
Poles, and Italians. The strikers numbered some 15,000,[12] with most being 
employed at Scovill, Chase Rolling Mill, and Chase Metal Works. One striker 
was shot to death by police.[13] At its peak during World War II, 10,000 
people worked at the Scovill Manufacturing Co, later sold to Century Brass. 
The city's metal manufacturing mills (Scovill Manufacturing, Anaconda American 
Brass, and Chase Brass & Copper were the largest) occupied more than 2 million 
square feet (180,000 m2) and more than 90 buildings. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 29.0 square miles (75.0 km2), 
of which 28.5 square miles (73.9 km2) is land and 0.42 square miles (1.1 km2), 
or 1.46%, is water.[17] Waterbury lies in the humid continental climate 
zone, and normally sees cold, snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Waterbury's 
neighborhoods are shaped by the history and geography of the city. Ethnic 
communities distinguish the city's 25 neighborhoods. Clusters of shops 
at the street corners created villages within the city. For many people, 
home, work and community life was contained within their neighborhood. 
Downtown, a short walk away, was "the city", offering live theater, fancy 
stores, parades and spectacles.[19] Commuting in the Greater Waterbury 
area consists of multiple public transportation options. CT Transit operates 
a significant amount of city buses running from the city center at Exchange 
Place to various neighborhoods in the city.[20] Metro-North Railroad runs 
commuter trains multiple times a day between the Waterbury station and 
Bridgeport, with connections to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. 
Waterbury’s Union Station, built in 1909 for the New York, New Haven and 
Hartford Railroad, is now closed for use as a railway station and part 
of the building is now the headquarters of the Republican-American newspaper.[21] 
Passengers traveling to and from Waterbury board and alight on a concrete 
platform adjacent to the old station. There are no ticket agents at Waterbury, 
which is currently the end of the line for the Waterbury Branch. The two 
main highways that run through the heart of the city are I-84 (Yankee Expressway) 
and Route 8. In the downtown area, I-84 and Route 8 are located on the 
elevated William W. Deady Bridge,[22] known locally as the "MixMaster" 
with eastbound traffic on the upper deck and westbound traffic on the lower 
deck. The interchange is ranked as one of the most heavily congested traffic 
areas in the New York/Connecticut region.[citation needed] Waterbury–Oxford 
Airport is the primary airport serving the city. The smaller Waterbury 
Airport is about four miles from the city's central business district. 
As of the census of 2010, there were 110,366 people, 42,761 households, 
and 26,996 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,866 
people per square mile (1,449.7/km2). There were 42,761 housing units at 
an average density of 1,492.0 per square mile. The racial makeup of the 
city was 58.8% White, 20.1% Black or African American, 0.6% Native American, 
1.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 14.2% from other races, and 4.6% from 
two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 31.2% of the population. 
Waterbury has a heavy Italian-American population with 21.46% of its residents 
claiming Italian heritage.[24] The Italian influence is especially strong 
in the Town Plot, Brooklyn, and North End neighborhoods.[25] Additionally, 
the city is home to thriving Albanian, Cape Verdean, Dominican, Brazilian, 
Jamaican, Portuguese, and Puerto Rican communities. Waterbury has strong 
Irish roots as well, especially in the Washington Hill section which is 
home to the city's annual St. Patrick Day's Parade, which, oddly enough, 
is rarely held on St. Patrick's Day itself. At the beginning of the 21st 
century, Waterbury had a growing Orthodox Jewish population.[26] There 
were 42,622 households out of which 31.2% had children under the age of 
18 living with them, 34.7% were married couples living together, 28.4% 
had a single householder with no husband present, and 36.9% were non-families. 
31.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.1% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.11. In the city the population 
was spread out with 25.6% under the age of 18, 10.1% from 18 to 24, 27.4% 
from 25 to 44, 24.3% from 45 to 64, and 12.6% who were 65 years of age 
or older. The median age was 35.2 years. For every 100 females there were 
89.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.8 males. 
According to the 2014 5-year American Community Survey (conducted 2010–2014, 
data released December 3, 2015), the median income for a household in the 
city was $41,136, compared to $69,899 statewide. In Waterbury, 24.2% of 
the population, or 26,122 residents of the city, lived below the poverty 
line, compared to 10.5% statewide. In Waterbury, 36.8% of the child population 
age 0–17, or 9,984 children in the city, lived below the poverty line, 
compared to 14% statewide.[27] Waterbury had a significant Jewish population 
beginning in the late 1800s, initially as a result of German immigration.The 
first synagogue in Waterbury opened in 1872[28] In the early 20th century, 
almost 9,000 Jews immigrated from Eastern Europe, with many fleeing persecution. 
The Orthodox Jewish community has experienced a renaissance since 2000 
due to efforts by educators and developers to create an affordable alternative 
to the high cost of living in established Orthodox communities in New York 
and New Jersey. This renaissance began with the founding of the Yeshiva 
K'tana of Waterbury in 2000; as of 2014, this full-service elementary and 
middle school has nearly 400 students. Other educational institutions are 
the Yeshiva Gedolah of Waterbury, which includes a mesivta high school 
and beit medrash (undergraduate) program for approximately 230 students, 
a Bais Yaakov school for girls, and a kolel. As of the end of 2014, the 
Waterbury Orthodox community numbers 180 families and includes a mikveh, 
eruv, and community services such as Hatzalah and Chaverim.[29] Waterbury's 
economic decline in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in it being ranked as 
having the worst quality of life of 300 U.S. metropolitan areas by Money 
Magazine in 1992. Waterbury was also rated as one of the "Worst Places 
for Businesses and Careers in America" by Forbes Magazine in April 2008.[30] 
Regardless, the city was named on the 100 Best Places to Raise a Family 
list in the same year.[31] According to the city's 2010 Comprehensive Annual 
Financial Report,[32] the top employers in the city are: Waterbury has 
about 52,000 registered voters, of whom about 24,000 are Democrats. There 
are about 7,800 registered Republicans and the balance are largely unaffiliated, 
with a smattering belonging to minor parties. John S. Monagan, who was 
a prolific author in addition to his political responsibilities, served 
as Waterbury's mayor from 1943 to 1948. He also served as its district's 
congressional representative from 1959 to 1973. George Harlamon, a member 
of the Waterbury Hall of Fame, was the city's 40th mayor. He served from 
1969 to 1970 during a period of racial tension. The city is known for its 
hard-nosed political culture compared locally to Cook County, Illinois, 
close elections, and a number of scandals. This reputation is so solidified 
that U.S. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman once joked that upon his death, he 
hoped to be buried in Waterbury so he could remain politically active.[citation 
needed] Waterbury's scandalous past dates back to 1940 when Mayor T. Frank 
Hayes and 22 others were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the City of 
Waterbury. Hayes received a 10–15 year sentence and served six years. Ironically, 
the massive corruption scheme was exposed with the help of then comptroller 
Sherwood Rowland, grandfather of Gov. John G. Rowland, who was convicted 
on corruption charges in 2004. The 2007 lulu.com book, Publisher vs. Politician: 
A Clash of Local Titans,[34] by author William A. Monti, is an account 
of the rise and fall of T. Frank Hayes and focuses on his election campaigns, 
his bitter fights with William J. Pape, publisher of two local newspapers, 
and his ultimate trial, conviction, and sentencing for corruption. Ironically, 
what appeared to have been a defeat for Hayes was not really a victory 
for Pape, and the stage was set for further corruption in Waterbury in 
the second half of the 20th century. Waterbury was in serious financial 
straits due to years of mismanagement, resulting in the city's finances 
being taken over by the State of Connecticut. The State Oversight Board 
oversaw city business for several years and have since left following consecutive 
years of balanced budgets. The successors to Philip Giordano, former Acting 
Mayor Sam Caligiuri (2001) and former mayor Michael Jarjura (2001–2011) 
managed the city without major controversy since 2001. Democrat Neil O'Leary 
was elected the 46th Mayor of Waterbury on November 9, 2011. As of July 
2012, the Mayor of Waterbury earns an annual salary of $119,306.[35] A 
number of presidential candidates have campaigned in Waterbury due to its 
pivotal role in statewide elections. The most famous was the election eve 
visit on the Green by John F. Kennedy in 1960. Forty thousand people waited 
until 3 am on the Green to greet Kennedy on Sunday, November 6, 1960. Sen. 
Kennedy spoke to them from the balcony of the Roger Smith Hotel (now called 
the Elton). Pierre Salinger later said it was the greatest night of the 
campaign. In September 1984 Ronald Reagan held a huge noontime election 
rally at the same location. In July 2006 former President Bill Clinton 
made a campaign appearance at the Palace Theatre for Senator Joe Lieberman 
during his campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate. Shortly after the 
Democratic primary, Tom Swan, campaign manager for Lieberman's opponent 
Ned Lamont, described Waterbury as a place where "the forces of slime meet 
the forces of evil," after a large majority of the town's voters backed 
Lieberman. Swan claimed he was referring to former Mayor Philip A. Giordano 
and former Governor John G. Rowland.[36] Governor John G. Rowland served 
ten months in a federal prison until February 10, 2006. He was released 
from federal prison with the stipulation that he serve four months house 
arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet monitor until June 2006. In January 
2008 Waterbury Mayor Michael Jarjura announced that he would hire Rowland 
as an economic development advisor for the city. Rowland began work in 
February that year receiving an annual salary of $95,000 as the city's 
economic development coordinator funded in conjunction with the Greater 
Waterbury Chamber of Commerce.[37][38] In 2011, the Board of Aldermen voted 
to eliminate funding the city's portion of his salary and in November 2011 
Rowland stated he would give up his position when his contract expired 
thus ending his quasi-city employment.[39] Later that year, following his 
victory over then Mayor Jarjura, new Mayor Neil O'Leary created the position 
of Economic Development Director as part of his new administration, removing 
the duties from the Chamber of Commerce and bringing them directly into 
City Hall, making Economic Development a cornerstone of his administration. 
Ron Pugliese was hired as the first Director to hold the position.[40] 
Waterbury is home to Connecticut's Consulate General of Portugal, which 
has its office downtown on East Main Street.[42] Waterbury is home to a 
total of 42 schools. That number breaks down to 9 high schools, 3 middle 
schools, 26 elementary schools (private & public), 2 Jewish schools and 
5 colleges/universities. The city's public schools are operated by Waterbury 
Public Schools under the leadership of superintendent Dr. Kathleen Ouellette 
and a board of education that consists of ten elected members and the city 
mayor, who acts as the chairman ex-officio. Waterbury at one time had the 
designation of the most catholic schools in the state. However, St. Thomas, 
St. Lucy, St. Margaret, St. Joseph, and St. Francis Elementary Schools 
have all closed over the years due to budget constraints. Public High Schools

The city of Waterbury is protected by the paid, full-time firefighters 
of the Waterbury Fire Department (WFD). The department currently operates 
out of nine fire stations located throughout the city.[47] The Waterbury 
Police Department (WPD) was founded in 1853. Headquarters is at 255 East 
Main Street, while the Waterbury police academy is located at the Waterbury 
Police Department Annex at 240 Bank Street. Chief of Police is Vernon Riddick, 
who holds the distinction of being the first African-American to hold the 
position in the departments history.[48] Print: Radio: *Consolidated borough
