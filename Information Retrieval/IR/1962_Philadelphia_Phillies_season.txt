The 1962 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 80th season for the National 
League franchise. The Phillies finished the season in seventh place in 
the newly expanded National League with a record of 81–80, a dramatic improvement 
of 30½ games over the 47–107 mark of the previous season. Gene Mauch managed 
the Phillies, who played their home games at Connie Mack Stadium. The Phillies 
had sold pitcher Robin Roberts to the New York Yankees shortly after the 
1961 season. On February 6, 1962, the Phillies announced that Roberts' 
uniform number 36 would be retired by the team on March 21, 1962, when 
the Yankees would visit Clearwater to play the Phillies in a spring training 
game. It was the first uniform number to be retired by the organization 
and only the second time (after the Yankees retired Babe Ruth's number 
3) that a uniform number was retired while the player was still active.[5] 
Roberts started for the Yankees in the spring game, gave up four runs in 
three innings, and was the winning pitcher in the game as the Yankees won 
13–10.[6] Tony Taylor, 2B[7] Johnny Callison, RF[7] Tony González, CF[7]
