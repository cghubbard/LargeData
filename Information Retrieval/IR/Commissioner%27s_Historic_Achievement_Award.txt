The Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award is awarded by the Commissioner 
of Baseball to a group or person who has made a "major impact on the sport" 
of baseball.[1] It is not an annual award; rather, the Commissioner presents 
the trophy at his discretion. The trophy is a gold baseball sitting atop 
a cylindrical silver base,[2] created by Tiffany & Co.[3] The award has 
been presented fourteen times by Commissioner Bud Selig: eleven times to 
players, once to a team, and twice to a non-player. Mark McGwire and Sammy 
Sosa were the first to receive the award for their parts in the 1998 MLB 
home run record chase.[2] The most recent recipient is Derek Jeter (2014), 
who was honored in the final year of his career for being "one of the most 
accomplished shortstops of all-time".[4] The 2001 Seattle Mariners won 
the award as a team for posting a 116–46 record one season after losing 
Alex Rodriguez to the Texas Rangers. Roberto Clemente, the 2006 awardee, 
is the only player to receive the award posthumously; his award was accepted 
by his wife, Vera.[5] Three years after McGwire and Sosa were honored, 
Cal Ripken, Jr. and Tony Gwynn, both of whom retired after the 2001 season, 
received the award and were honored at the 2001 MLB All-Star Game; Ripken 
was elected to the American League All-Star team as a starter at third 
base, while Gwynn was later added as an honorary member of the National 
League team.[6] During the first inning of the game, Rodriguez, who had 
been elected the starter at shortstop—the position at which Ripken played 
for most of his career—switched positions with Ripken for the first inning 
of the game as a tribute.[7] Including the presentation of the award to 
the Mariners following the season, the 2001 season's three awards are the 
most presented in a single year. Barry Bonds received the award in 2002, 
becoming the third player so honored for breaking the single-season home 
run record. Bonds was the first of two players to receive the award that 
season, along with Rickey Henderson. The award was given in each year from 
2004 until 2007: Roger Clemens was honored during the 2004 All-Star Game, 
and Ichiro Suzuki was presented with the award for breaking the single-season 
hits record in 2005. Rachel Robinson was honored in 2007, receiving the 
award for establishing the Jackie Robinson Foundation. She was the first
