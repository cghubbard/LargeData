The Newark Eagles were a professional Negro league baseball team which 
played in the Negro National League from 1936 to 1948. They were owned 
by Effa Manley.[1] The Newark Eagles were formed in 1936 when the Newark 
Dodgers, established in 1933, merged with the Brooklyn Eagles, established 
in 1935. Abe Manley and his wife Effa Manley, owners and founders of the 
Brooklyn Eagles, purchased the Newark Dodgers franchise and combined the 
teams' assets and player rosters.[2] Team management was left to Effa, 
making the Eagles the first professional team owned and operated by a woman. 
The Eagles shared Ruppert Stadium with the minor league Newark Bears. The 
Eagles were to (black) Newark what the Dodgers were to Brooklyn. In 1948, 
the Negro National League disbanded after Jackie Robinson's successful 
integration of Major League Baseball a year earlier. The Eagles were sold 
and moved to Houston, Texas for the 1949 season.[2] The Houston Eagles 
joined the Negro American League and lasted until 1950. Under Effa Manley's 
guidance, the 1946 team won the Negro World Series, upsetting the Kansas 
City Monarchs in a 7-game series.[2] The team featured future Hall of Famers 
Larry Doby (the first black player in the American League), Ray Dandridge, 
Leon Day, Monte Irvin, Biz Mackey, and Willie Wells, as well as other stars
