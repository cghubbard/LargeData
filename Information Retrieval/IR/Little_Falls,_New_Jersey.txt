Effective January 1, 2005, the form of government in Little Falls was changed 
by a public referendum to the Mayor-Council form authorized by the Faulkner

four-year term, and the five township council members to four-year terms 
of office on a staggered basis, with either three seats or two seats (together 
with the mayoral seat) up for election in even years as part of the November 
general election. For most of its history, Little Falls had been governed 
under the Township form of government by a township committee consisting 
of five committee members elected by the voters. Under this system, a chairman 
(mayor) and deputy-chair (deputy mayor) were selected annually by the Township 
Committee members.[6] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Little Falls is
