As player As coach Rodney Cline "Rod" Carew (born October 1, 1945) is a 
former Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman, second baseman and coach 
of Panamanian descent. He played from 1967 to 1985 for the Minnesota Twins 
and the California Angels and was elected to the All-Star game every season 
except his last. While Carew was never a home run threat (only 92 of his 
3,053 hits were home runs), he made a career out of being a consistent 
contact hitter. He threw right-handed and batted left-handed. He was inducted 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and the Caribbean Baseball Hall 
of Fame. Carew served as an MLB coach for several years after retiring 
as a player. Carew is the son of Olga Teoma, a domestic, and Eric Carew, 
Sr. a painter.[1][2] Carew is a Zonian and was born to a Panamanian mother 
on a train in the town of Gatún, which, at that time, was in the Panama 
Canal Zone. The train was racially segregated; white passengers were given 
the better forward cars, while non-whites, like Carew's mother, were forced 
to ride in the rearward cars. When she went into labor, the conductor Charles 
Williams stopped the train to find a physician. Traveling on the train 
was Dr. Rodney Cline, who delivered the baby. In appreciation for this, 
Mrs. Carew named the boy Rodney Cline Carew.[3] At age 14, Carew and his 
family emigrated to the United States and settled in the Washington Heights 
section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City. Although Carew attended 
George Washington High School, he never played baseball for the high school 
team. Instead, Carew played semi-pro baseball for the Bronx Cavaliers, 
which is where he was discovered by Minnesota Twins' scout, Monroe Katz 
(whose son, Steve, played with Carew on the Cavaliers). Katz then recommended 
Carew to another Twins' scout, Herb Stein, who along with Katz signed Carew 
to an amateur free agent contract (at the Stella D'Oro Restaurant in the 
Bronx) on June 24, 1964.[4][5] Starting his minor league career, Carew 
was assigned to play second base with the Melbourne (FL) Twins in the Cocoa 
Rookie League and hit .325 over the final 37 games of the season.[6] Promoted 
to the Single-A Orlando Twins in the Florida State League the following 
season, Carew hit .303 with 20 doubles, eight triples and one home run. 
Carew spent the 1966 season back at Single-A, but this time with the Wilson 
Tobs in the Carolina League. Carew won the American League (AL) Rookie 
of the Year award in 1967[3] and was elected to the first of 18 consecutive 
All-Star game appearances. Carew stole home seven times in the 1969 season 
to lead the majors, just missing Ty Cobb's Major League record of eight 
and the most in the major leagues since Pete Reiser stole seven for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946. In 1972, Carew led the AL in batting, hitting 
.318; he had no home runs for the only time in his career. This was the 
first time since 1918, when Zack Wheat won the National League batting 
championship, that a player won the batting title with no home runs. In 
1975, Carew won his fourth consecutive AL batting title.[7] He joined Ty 
Cobb as the only players to lead the major leagues in batting average for 
three consecutive seasons. Seeing time predominantly at second base early 
in his career, Carew moved to first base in September 1975 and stayed there 
for the rest of his career. In the 1977 season, Carew batted .388, which 
was the highest since Boston's Ted Williams hit .388 in 1957; he won the 
1977 AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He had finished in the top 15 
in AL MVP voting in every season between 1972 and 1976.[7] In the summer 
of 1977, Carew appeared on the cover of Time with the caption "Baseball's 
Best Hitter".[8] He won two more batting titles in 1977 and 1978, hitting 
.388 and .333.[7] In 1979, frustrated by the Twins' inability to keep young 
talent, some racist comments by Calvin Griffith, and the Twins' overall 
penny-pinching negotiating style,[5] Carew announced his intention to leave 
the Twins. On February 3, Carew was traded to the Angels for outfielder 
Ken Landreaux, catcher/first baseman Dave Engle, right-handed pitcher Paul 
Hartzell, and left-handed pitcher Brad Havens.[9] Although it would have 
represented an infusion of talent, the Twins were unable to complete a 
possibly better deal with the New York Yankees in January in which Carew 
would have moved to the Yankees in exchange for Chris Chambliss, Juan Beníquez, 
Dámaso García, and Dave Righetti.[10] Though Carew did not win a batting 
title after 1978, he hit between .305 and .339 from 1979 to 1983.[7] In 
1982, Carew broke his hand early in the season. Newspaper reports characterized 
him as swinging one-handed that season due to pain, but he put together 
a 25-game hitting streak at one point in the season.[11] He played in 138 
games that year and hit .319. The Angels went to the playoffs in 1982, 
which was Carew's fourth and final appearance in postseason play. The team 
lost a five-game series (three games to two) to the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Carew played in all five games, but he hit .176 (three hits in 17 at-bats).[7] 
On August 4, 1985, Carew joined an elite group of ballplayers when he got 
his 3,000th base hit against Minnesota Twins left-hander Frank Viola at 
the former Anaheim Stadium.[3] The 1985 season was his last. After the 
season, Rod Carew was granted free agency, after the Angels declined to 
offer him a new contract, but he received no offers from other teams. Carew 
suspected that baseball owners were colluding to keep him (and other players) 
from signing.[12] On January 10, 1995, nearly a decade after his forced 
retirement, arbitrator Thomas Roberts ruled that the owners had violated 
the rules of baseball's second collusion agreement. Carew was awarded damages 
equivalent to what he would have likely received in 1986: $782,035.71.[12] 
Carew finished his career with 3,053 hits and a lifetime batting average 
of .328.[13] Through 2013, Carew still holds many places on the Twins all-time 
franchise lists including: the highest career batting average (.334), the 
second highest on-base percentage (.393; tied with Buddy Myer), fourth 
highest in intentional walks (99), and fifth in hits (2,085) and stolen 
bases (271).[14] He also holds many places in Angels franchise history 
including highest career on-base percentage (.393), the second highest 
batting average (.314), and sixth highest in both intentional walks (45) 
and sacrifice hits (60).[15] Carew's career total of 17 steals of home 
ties him for 17th on the all-time MLB list with former New York Giant MVP 
Larry Doyle and fellow Hall of Famer Eddie Collins.[3][4] In a pre-game 
ceremony before the 2016 All Star Game in San Diego, the American League 
batting championship trophy was named "the Rod Carew American League Batting 
Championship Award." During the 1960s, Carew served a six-year commitment 
in the United States Marine Corps Reserve as a combat engineer.[16] He 
later said that his military experience helped him in his baseball career. 
Carew said, "When I joined the Marine Corps, it was a life-changing event 
for me because I learned about discipline. When I first came up to the 
big leagues in 1967, I was a little bit of a hot-head. But after two weeks 
of war games every summer, I realized that baseball was not do-or-die. 
That kind of discipline made me the player I became."[17] There is no evidence 
that Carew ever formally converted to Judaism, although he wore a chai 
necklace during his playing days. His first wife, Marilynn Levy, is Jewish[9] 
and he was a member of Temple Beth Shalom[18] in Santa Ana, California. 
Their three daughters were raised in the Jewish tradition and had their 
bat mitzvahs there. When one daughter, Michelle, died at age 18, services 
were held at Beth Shalom,[19] and she was buried in the family plot at 
the United Hebrew Brotherhood Cemetery in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb 
of Minneapolis, where Rod Carew played for the Minnesota Twins.[20] A 1976 
article written in Esquire magazine was one of the first publications to 
assert that Carew is Jewish. Sportswriter Harry Stein released his "All-Time 
All-Star Argument Starter" article which consisted of five different ethnic-based 
baseball teams. Carew was erroneously named the second baseman on Stein's 
All-Jewish team. A 2007 Salon article named Carew one of the 18 best Jewish 
ballplayers of all time; the article clarified that Carew was not Jewish 
but commended him for raising his children in the faith and for marrying 
Levy in spite of death threats he received.[21] Another source propagating 
the story is the 1994 song, "The Chanukah Song", written and performed 
by entertainer Adam Sandler, in which he lists famous Jews of the 20th 
century: "...O.J. Simpson... not a Jew! But guess who is: Hall of Famer 
Rod Carew! He converted!" Carew later wrote Sandler and explained the situation, 
adding that Carew thought the song was "pretty funny." Sandler later deleted 
Carew from future versions of the song, although the original version still 
gets the most airplay. However, Neil Diamond later mentioned the ballplayer 
in his version of "The Chanukah Song". Carew moved to the community of 
Anaheim Hills, California while playing with the Angels and remained there 
after his retirement.[22] Carew was hired as the Angels hitting coach on 
November 5, 1991 and served in a similar capacity with the Milwaukee Brewers. 
He is credited with helping develop young hitters like Garret Anderson, 
Jim Edmonds, and Tim Salmon. Carew has also worked at various times as 
a minor league and spring training hitting and base running coach for the 
Twins and serves as an international youth baseball instructor for Major 
League Baseball.[23] Rod married second wife Rhonda in December 2001 and 
she has two children, Cheyenne and Devon. Devout Christians, the family 
attends Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California. On January 19, 2004, 
Panama City's National Stadium was renamed "Rod Carew Stadium".[24] In 
2005, Carew was named the second baseman on the Major League Baseball Latino 
Legends Team.[25] Carew's number 29 was retired by the Twins on July 19, 
1987, and by the Angels in 1986. Carew was the fourth inductee into the 
Angels' Hall of Fame on August 6, 1991.[26][27] Carew was elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility, the 22nd 
player so elected. In 1999, he ranked #61 on The Sporting News' list of 
100 Greatest Baseball Players,[28] and was nominated as a finalist for 
Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. Carew was inducted into the Hispanic 
Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010.[29] Carew has three biological 
children from his first marriage - Charryse, Stephanie, and Michelle. In 
September 1995, his youngest of three daughters, Michelle, was diagnosed 
with acute myeloid leukemia, a relatively rare leukemia for a young person. 
Doctors wanted to perform a bone marrow transplant, but Michelle's rare 
ethnic heritage complicated the search for a matching donor; her father 
was black with West Indian and Panamanian roots and her mother was of Russian-Jewish 
ancestry. Carew pleaded for those of similar ethnic background to come 
forward. When no matching bone marrow donor was found, an umbilical cord 
blood transplant was performed in March 1996. Michelle died on April 17, 
1996 at the age of 18.[30] A statue of her has been installed in Angel 
Stadium of Anaheim.[31] Carew began using chewing tobacco in 1964 and was 
a regular user up to 1992, when a cancerous growth in his mouth was discovered 
and removed. The years of use had severely damaged his teeth and gums, 
and Carew has spent a reported $100,000 in restorative dental work.[32] 
In September, 2015 Carew suffered a massive heart attack while on a California 
golf course.[33] He was hospitalized for more than six weeks, and had several 
surgeries, which culminated with implantation of a Left Ventricular Assist 
Device (LVAD).[34] Carew recovered sufficiently to take part in the Twins' 
2016 spring training as an instructor and coach.[35] In comments Carew 
made to reporters in February, 2016, he indicated that his doctors have 
informed him that he will eventually need a heart transplant.[35] Italics
