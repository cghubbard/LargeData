Gary Nedrow Bender (born September 1, 1940) [1] is a retired American sportscaster 
and 2008 inductee into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame. He officially retired, 
April 13, 2011,[2][3] from Fox Sports Arizona network after 18 years calling 
the NBA's Phoenix Suns games. Bender, who was born in Norton, Kansas, and 
raised in a nearby town of Ulysses, Kansas,[4] graduated from Ulysses High 
School in 1958. He then attended Wichita State University, graduating with 
a journalism degree in 1962 and a master's degree from the University of 
Kansas in 1964. Bender then began his broadcasting career calling games 
at Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, KS and then went on to do 
the same at the University of Kansas' football and basketball programs 
in the 1960s. He also spent years as a broadcaster in Wisconsin and called 
all of the Wisconsin Athletic Association championship games, as well as 
Green Bay Packers radio and Milwaukee Brewers television in the early 1970s. 
He did play-by-play for the NFL on CBS from 1975 to 1981, and again in 
1986 (among his partners were Johnny Unitas, Sonny Jurgensen, Hank Stram, 
and John Madden, all members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame) and the 
1981 NBA Finals along with color commentators Rick Barry and Bill Russell, 
both members of the Basketball Hall of Fame. He was CBS' first play-by-play 
announcer for the network's coverage of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball 
Tournament, calling the Final Four alongside Billy Packer in 1982, 1983 
and 1984. In 1982 and 1983, he was CBS' lead college football play-by-play 
man. On October 27, 1987, Bender (along with Lynn Swann) called the Monday 
Night Football game between the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings. 
That game had been scheduled for October 26, but when the Minnesota Twins 
(who at the time, shared the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome with the Vikings) 
played Game 7 of the World Series that day, the football game was moved 
to Monday and shown to a regional audience. In 1988, Bender did play-by-play 
for the American League Championship Series alongside Baseball Hall of 
Famers Joe Morgan and Reggie Jackson. He also announced college football 
games for ABC Sports, where he formerly worked alongside Dick Vermeil. 
As previously mentioned, Bender did play-by-play for the 1988 American 
League Championship Series[5] between the Oakland Athletics and Boston 
Red Sox. Bender spent two years (1987-1988) as the #2 baseball play-by-play 
man for ABC behind Al Michaels. Bender worked the backup Monday Night Baseball 
broadcasts (with Tim McCarver in 1987 and Joe Morgan in 1988) as well as 
serving as a field reporter/post-game interviewer for ABC's 1987 World 
Series coverage. Gary Bender would ultimately be taken off ABC's baseball 
team in favor of Gary Thorne in 1989. Bender also called NFL games for 
TNT from 1992 to 1994, teaming with Pat Haden. On December 17, 2009, Bender 
filled in for Marv Albert, who was battling throat problems, to call the 
Phoenix Suns at Portland Trail Blazers game on TNT and called the game 
with Reggie Miller. As previously mentioned, for 18 years, Bender was the 
television play-by-play announcer on Fox Sports Net (FSN-Arizona) for the 
National Basketball Association's Phoenix Suns; he worked alongside former 
Suns players Eddie Johnson and Scott Williams. In 2006, he was named as 
the play-by-play announcer for the Versus network's coverage of Mountain 
West Conference football, where he would be partnered with former NFL player 
Glenn Parker. Bender is also co-author with Michael Johnson of the biography 
Call of the Game, in which he shares his life story, tips on how to become 
a better broadcaster, and his Christian testimony. Bender did a series 
of Kendall Motor Oil commercials in mid-1980s. In the first five months 
of 2001, Bender presided as host of the nationally syndicated Focus on 
the Family radio show after the resignation of previous host Mike Trout 
(1985â€“2000) because of an extramarital affair. Bender was replaced on a 
full-time basis by Focus vice president of broadcasting John Fuller. Gary 
Bender is an alumnus of the Kansas Delta chapter of Phi Delta Theta at 
Wichita State where he received his bachelor's degree. He received his 
master's degree in radio and TV from the University of Kansas. His son,
