Dámaso Marte Sabiñón (born February 14, 1975) is a former Dominican Major 
League Baseball relief pitcher.[1] He played for the Seattle Mariners (1999), 
Pittsburgh Pirates (2001, 2006–2008), Chicago White Sox (2002–2005), and 
New York Yankees (2008–2011).[2] Marte was the winning pitcher of the longest 
World Series game ever played, Game 3 of 2005. Marte was signed as an amateur 
free agent by the Seattle Mariners in 1992. He made his major league debut 
on June 30, 1999, against the Oakland Athletics. On November 16, 2000, 
Marte signed with the New York Yankees, but was traded to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates on June 13, 2001, for Enrique Wilson. In his Pirates debut, he 
hurled 3 innings of one-hit ball. He went on to throw 14 innings in which 
he only allowed 1 run and struck out a career-high 5 batters against the 
Cincinnati Reds. On March 27, 2002, Marte along with Edwin Yan were traded 
to the Chicago White Sox for Matt Guerrier. In 2003, he enjoyed his most 
successful big league season, where he went 4–2 with a 1.58 ERA in 79.7 
innings pitched where he struck out a career high 87 batters. He continued 
his success in 2004 when he held opposing batters to a .217 batting average 
and left-handed batters to an average of .143. He also matched his career 
high for strikeouts in a game with 5 against the Florida Marlins. A notable 
achievement for him was being the winning pitcher in the longest game in 
World Series history, Game 3 of the 2005 World Series. In that game, he 
tossed 1.2 scoreless innings and struck out three batters in the 14 inning 
win over the Houston Astros. The White Sox would then win the World Series 
against the Astros in 4 games. On December 13, 2005, the White Sox traded 
Marte back to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Rob Mackowiak. Dámaso 
made 3 relief appearances in the World Baseball Classic for the Dominican 
Republic in 2006. Come the regular season, he went on to struggle a bit 
in where he lost 7 straight games as a reliever but still averaged 9.7 
strikeouts per 9 innings pitched. In 2007, he enjoyed some success where 
he held left-handed batters to a .094 batting average. He also did not 
allow a hit in 32 consecutive at-bats against left-handers which happened 
to be the longest streak of consecutive hitless at-bats by a left-handed 
batter against any pitcher in the MLB. For a stint, after an injury to 
Matt Capps, Marte was the Pirates closing pitcher, and was fairly successful. 
During his stint as closer, he was traded to the New York Yankees. On July 
26, 2008, Marte and Xavier Nady were traded to the Yankees for 4 minor 
leaguers José Tábata, Ross Ohlendorf, Jeff Karstens, and Dan McCutchen.[3] 
In his Yankees debut, he relieved José Veras (for only one batter), and 
faced David Ortiz, who struck out swinging.[4] Following the 2008 season, 
the Yankees declined Marte's option. However, the Yankees then re-signed 
him to a new three-year deal with an option for a fourth.[5] Following 
a disappointing regular season in which Marté posted an ERA of 9.45, he 
delivered an extraordinary performance for the Yankees in the playoffs. 
After a shaky first outing in Game 2 of the 2009 American League Division 
Series, in which he surrendered two consecutive singles to the Minnesota 
Twins before being relieved, Marte retired all twelve of the remaining 
batters he faced during the postseason. During Game 6 of the 2009 World 
Series, Marte faced Philadelphia Phillies stars Chase Utley and Ryan Howard, 
striking out both of them on the minimum 6 pitches. Marte and the Yankees 
went on to win Game 6, clinching the Series for the team's 27th championship. 
Marte missed much of the 2010 season due to left arm inflammation. He underwent 
left shoulder surgery late in the 2010 season and was knocked out for the 
entire 2011 season.[6] In late June, Marte started to play catch in his 
journey to recovery.[7] He became a free agent at the end of the 2011 season 
after the Yankees declined his 2012 option and paid him a $250,000 buyout.[8]
