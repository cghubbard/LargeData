William Russell Johnson (August 30, 1918 – June 20, 2006) was an American 
professional baseball player. He was a third baseman in Major League Baseball 
who played in 964 games for the New York Yankees in the 1940s and later 
with the St. Louis Cardinals. Johnson was born in Montclair, New Jersey, 
and debuted in 1943. He had an impressive rookie season which earned him 
4th place in American League MVP voting. After missing 1944–1945 for wartime 
service in the United States Army, where he fought in the European Theater 
of Operations, he returned to MLB to spend the next five seasons as a regular 
third baseman. Nicknamed "Bull", and standing 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) 
tall and weighing 180 pounds (82 kg; 13 st), Johnson was named an All-Star 
in 1947, and was a part of four championship teams in his six seasons as 
a regular. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1951 to allow Gil 
McDougald, a hot prospect for the Yankees, to play his position full-time. 
He served as the Cards' third baseman for two years before retiring during 
the 1953 season. In later years he worked as a shipping supervisor in Augusta,
