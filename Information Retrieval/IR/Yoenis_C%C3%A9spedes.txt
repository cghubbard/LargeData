Yoenis Céspedes Milanés (born October 18, 1985), nicknamed La Potencia, 
is a Cuban professional baseball outfielder who is currently a free agent. 
He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, 
Boston Red Sox, and Detroit Tigers and the New York Mets. Before joining 
the Major Leagues, he played in the Cuban National Series and was a member 
of the Cuba national baseball team. He won the 2013 and 2014 Home Run Derby. 
While primarily a left fielder in his early career, he has split between 
left and center field since joining the Mets. Céspedes was born in the 
small town of Campechuela, in Granma Province, Cuba. Céspedes is the son 
of Estela Milanés, a softball pitcher who appeared in the 2000 Summer Olympics 
for Cuba,[1][2][3] and Cresencio Céspedes, a former Cuban League catcher 
who separated from Milanés when Yoenis was one year old.[4] At age 10, 
he was sent by his mother to a state-run school where he could focus on 
baseball.[4] He played eight seasons in the Cuban Winter League before 
defecting from Cuba in 2011. In the summer of 2011, Céspedes and six others 
took a 23-hour speedboat ride departing Cuba and heading for the Dominican 
Republic. After arriving in the Dominican, he met Dominican agent Edgar 
Mercedes who established residency for him in Santiago which allowed him 
to bypass the MLB Draft and become a free-agent.[5] Céspedes debuted in 
the Cuban National Series with Granma during the 2003–04 Cuban National 
Series, hitting .302/.382/.503 (batting average, on-base percentage and 
slugging percentage). He was considered for the Cuban National Series Rookie 
of the Year Award, but lost out to Frank Montieth. He batted .313/.403/.540 
in the 2004–05 season. In the 2005–06 season, he hit .351/.444/.649 with 
23 home runs, 89 runs and 78 runs batted in (RBI) in 88 games played. He 
tied Yulieski Gourriel for the National Series lead in runs and was four 
home runs behind Gourriel for the lead, placing second. He tied for seventh 
in doubles (24), was second in total bases (220, 6 behind Gourriel) and 
was 4th in slugging. He hit .481/.481/.741 for Cuba in the 2006 Haarlem 
Baseball Week. He produced at a .303/.402/.541 rate in the 2006–2007 season 
with 17 home runs and 79 runs in 89 games. He again led in runs. He was 
also fifth in doubles (24), tied Yosvani Peraza for third in home runs, 
was fourth in total bases (184), tied Alfredo Despaigne for 4th in RBI, 
tied for 4th in steals (15) and was sixth in slugging. He was 1 for 7 with 
a steal and a run in the 2007 Pan-American Games in his debut for the Cuban 
national team. He hit .284/.342/.552 in the 2007–08 season. He was among 
the league leaders in RBI (tying teammate Despaigne for third with 78), 
tied Urgellés for fourth in runs (82), was second in home runs (26, trailing 
only Alexei Bell) and fourth in 202 total bases. He was the starting center 
fielder for Cuba in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He hit .458/.480/1.000 
with a double, 3 triples, 2 home runs, five runs and five RBI in six games. 
He led Cuba in slugging and was second to Frederich Cepeda in average, 
OBP and OPS. He tied Cepeda and Yulieski Gourriel for the team lead in 
runs and tied Gourriel for second in homers, behind Cepeda. He broke a 
1–1 tie against Australia with a 6th-inning solo homer off Damian Moss 
and started a 16–4 romp over Mexico with a leadoff triple against Pablo 
Ortega. Céspedes tripled off Hisashi Iwakuma in Cuba's last game of the 
tournament, a 5–0 loss to Japan, but did not score. Earlier in that game, 
he dropped a fly from Michihiro Ogasawara to let the first two Japanese 
runs score.[6] Cuba thus missed the final four of an event for the first 
time ever; the Cuban team had also made the finals of every global baseball 
competition since 1959.[6] Céspedes batted .323/.411/.601 in the 2008–2009 
season with 24 homers and 83 runs in 87 games. He tied Leonys Martín for 
4th in the league in runs and tied Rolando Meriño for third in home runs 
(trailing Alfredo Despaigne and Joan Carlos Pedroso). He was 7th in total 
bases (197), 9th in RBI (76) and 10th in slugging. He made the All-Star 
outfield alongside Giorvis Duvergel and Despaigne. He started the 2009 
Baseball World Cup as Cuba's starting center fielder, but struggled and 
only hit .194/.275/.333 while being caught in his only steal attempt;[7] 
Martín replaced him as the event went along.[3] In the gold medal game, 
Céspedes pinch-hit for Yorbis Borroto successfully with a 9th-inning single 
off Brad Lincoln in Cuba's 10–5 loss to Team USA, settling for a silver 
medal. He hit .345/.426/.617 in the 2009–2010 season with 87 runs and 22 
homers in 87 contests. He was third in the league in runs (3 behind leader 
Yulieski Gourriel), 10th in hits (118), 8th in home runs, 4th in total 
bases (211, behind Alfredo Despaigne, Gourriel and José Dariel Abreu) and 
was 9th in slugging. He was not picked as an All-Star outfielder as Despaigne, 
Cepeda and Bell took the three slots. He went 11 for 22 with 12 runs, 14 
RBI, two doubles and four homers in six games at the 2010 World University 
Baseball Championship.[8] He drove in six against South Korea and five 
against China. In the gold medal game, he was 0 for 4 with a strikeout 
as Cuba's fifth batter in a 4–3 win over Team USA. He made the tournament 
All-Star outfield alongside Mikie Mahtook and Shota Ishimine. He played 
for Cuba when it finished second in the 2011 Pan American Games Qualifying 
Tournament. In the 2010 Intercontinental Cup, he was 3 for 10 with a double, 
three runs, four RBI and a walk as a backup. In the 4–1 win over the Dutch 
national team in the Gold Medal game, he was the second of three left fielders 
Cuba used. He replaced Yoandry Urgellés, was retired by Berry van Driel 
and then replaced by Despaigne.[9] He put up a .333/.424/.667 batting line 
with 89 runs, 33 home runs and 99 RBI in 90 games in the 2010–2011 season. 
He led the league in runs (five ahead of Cepeda), tied Abreu for the home 
run lead (breaking Despaigne's league record by one),[10] tied Cepeda for 
the most total bases (236), tied Ramon Tamayo for 7th in steals (11 in 
14 tries), led in RBI (6 ahead of Abreu) and finished 5th in slugging. 
He was named the All-Star center fielder, joining Despaigne and Cepeda 
in the outfield. After Céspedes defected from Cuba in the summer of 2011, 
he established residency in the U.S. in January 2012, bypassing the MLB 
draft and becoming an unrestricted free agent.[11] Céspedes was considered 
a five-tool outfielder going into free agency. Kevin Goldstein of Baseball 
Prospectus declared Céspedes "arguably the best all-around player to come 
out of Cuba in a generation."[12] After interest from numerous Major League 
teams, Céspedes agreed to a 4-year, $36 million contract with the Oakland 
Athletics on February 13, 2012, with the deal becoming official the following 
month.[13] Céspedes began the 2012 season for the Athletics at his usual 
position of center field, but was later moved to left field upon the return 
of veteran center fielder Coco Crisp. On March 28, in his major league 
debut, he went 1 for 3, and was also hit by a pitch.[14] The following 
day, he hit his first major league home run, a 2-run shot off Seattle Mariners 
relief pitcher Shawn Kelley.[15] Céspedes had hit his first walk-off home 
run on June 21 against the Los Angeles Dodgers with the final score of 
4–1, resulting in a three-game sweep. The Athletics would go on to win 
the American League West, with Céspedes batting .316 with a .381 OBP in 
the postseason. On July 15, 2013, Céspedes won the 2013 Home Run Derby. 
A last-minute addition by team captain Robinson Cano to represent the American 
League squad, he hit 32 home runs total in the exhibition, including 17 
in the first round. He defeated the National League's Bryce Harper in the 
final round by hitting 9 home runs, with five swings to spare. He was the 
first winner of the contest who had not been selected to that year's All-Star 
game.[16] Céspedes hit .240 for the year and had 26 home runs along with 
80 RBI's. Though Cèspedes had a great postseason, the A's were eliminated 
by the Detroit Tigers. Céspedes suffered several injuries throughout the 
season, including wrist, hamstring, and knee injuries.[17] Céspedes had 
a great start to the season, hitting .273 with 14 homers and 55 RBIs through 
July 1, and was 3rd in the All-Star Voting for the AL behind Jose Bautista 
of the Toronto Blue Jays and Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. 
Immediately Céspedes was noticed for throwing out runners. After getting 
3 putouts against the Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles, Céspedes 
gunned down Chris Iannetta and Kole Calhoun at home plate in the same inning 
in a game against the Angels on May 31. He would have an even more memorable 
throw, again against the Angels, when he threw out Howie Kendrick at home 
on June 10. Céspedes bobbled a hit off the bat of Mike Trout, causing Kendrick 
to attempt to run home.[18] Céspedes corralled the ball and fired a 300-foot 
throw on the fly to nail Kendrick at the plate. He would once again terrorize 
Angel baserunners as he threw out Albert Pujols trying to advance to third 
when the ball got by Céspedes in the next game.[19] This put Céspedes at 
11 outfield assists on the season, which led the league. On July 1, Céspedes 
suffered a hamstring injury while running against the Tigers on a RBI hit 
by Brandon Moss. Céspedes along with 5 other A's players (Josh Donaldson, 
Derek Norris, Brandon Moss, and pitchers Scott Kazmir and Sean Doolittle) 
were chosen to play in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game in Target Field. In the 
final week of fan voting to select starters for the All Star Game, he was 
passed by Adam Jones.[20] On July 14, 2014, Céspedes won the Home Run Derby 
for a second time, becoming the first player to win consecutive Home Run 
Derby titles since Ken Griffey Jr. accomplished that feat in 1999. Céspedes 
played in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game where he went 0 for 2. On July 31, 
2014, Céspedes was traded to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for pitcher 
Jon Lester and utility player Jonny Gomes.[21] Céspedes hit his first home 
run as a member of the Boston Red Sox on August 10, 2014 against the Los 
Angeles Angels, with a 3-run home run. Céspedes ended the season with a 
.260 batting average with 22 home runs and a career-high 100 RBI. On December 
11, 2014, the Red Sox traded Céspedes along with Alex Wilson and Gabe Speier 
to the Detroit Tigers for Rick Porcello.[22] Céspedes played his first 
game with the Tigers during opening day against the Minnesota Twins on 
April 6, 2015, where he robbed Kurt Suzuki of a home run, leading to a 
4–0 victory for the Tigers.[23] Through June 13, Céspedes was hitting .308 
with 9 home runs and 33 runs batted in. He was not selected as an All Star 
but was put in as a player on the All-Star Final Vote. Therefore, he could 
not compete in the home run derby after winning the two previous years.[24] 
Céspedes won the American League Rawlings Gold Glove Award in left field. 
In 99 games for the Tigers, Céspedes had nine assists, 11 Defensive Runs 
Saved and a 15 Ultimate Zone Rating. He became only the second player in 
MLB history to win a Gold Glove Award after a mid-season trade between 
leagues, following Vic Power in 1964.[25] On July 31, 2015, Céspedes was 
traded to the New York Mets for minor league pitchers Michael Fulmer and 
Luis Cessa. On August 21, Céspedes went 5 for 6 against the Colorado Rockies, 
hitting 3 home runs in a game for the first time. Céspedes finished a triple 
shy of the cycle.[26] In his first 41 games with the Mets, Céspedes exploded, 
posting a .309 batting average, 17 home runs, 42 RBIs, and a .691 slugging 
percentage. His offensive explosion helped the Mets jump up to a 9.5 game 
lead over the Washington Nationals in the National League East as of September 
14. Because of his efforts, Céspedes was awarded the NL Player of the Week 
Award for September 7 to the 13th. He batted .345, hit 4 home runs, scored 
6 runs, and drove 12 RBI while posting a 1.263 OPS. His performance continued 
in the playoffs. In Game 3 of the National League Division Series against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, his three-hit, three-run, three-RBI performance, 
including a home run, helped the Mets take a 13–7 win and a 2–1 series 
lead.[27] In Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against 
the Chicago Cubs, Céspedes threw Starlin Castro out at the plate, preserving 
a then 1–1 tie which the Mets won 4–2.[28] In the sixth inning of Game 
3, Céspedes caught the Cubs off-guard by stealing third base. He later 
scored the go-ahead run when Trevor Cahill's uncaught third strike allowed 
Michael Conforto to reach base safely.[29] The World Series started inauspiciously 
for Céspedes when Kansas City leadoff hitter Alcides Escobar hit Matt Harvey's 
first pitch to centerfield, and Céspedes misplayed the ball, then booted 
it into left field, resulting in the first World Series inside-the-park 
home run since 1929. The Royals would eventually take the series 4-1. For 
the Series, Céspedes batted .150 with no extra base hits. At the end of 
the year, he became a free agent. On January 26, 2016, Céspedes re-signed 
with the Mets on a 3-year, $75 million contract, with an opt-out after 
the first season.[30] On April 26, Céspedes came off the bench against 
the Cincinnati Reds in the 7th inning and hit a first-pitch pinch-hit three-run 
homer to tie the game at 3. He had previously sat out the last few games 
due to a lingering leg injury. The Mets eventually won 4-3.[31] His 466 
feet (142 m) home run against the Chicago Cubs on June 30 tied for the 
longest in Citi Field history.[32] On July 5, Céspedes was named to the 
National League roster for the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
at Petco Park, joining teammates Noah Syndergaard and Jeurys Familia and 
Mets manager Terry Collins, but was later taken off the roster along with 
Syndergaard due to an injury.[33][34] In August 2016, Céspedes was criticized 
for golfing while on the disabled list.[35] Céspedes currently lives in 
Manhattan, New York. He has a 6-year-old son, Yoenis Jr., in Cuba, whom 
he hasn't seen in four years, and is only able to talk to him on the phone. 
He has tried to get him into the United States.[36] In 2014, Céspedes signed 
with Jay-Z's Roc Nation Sports, a sports agency division of Roc Nation.[37] 
A proud exotic car owner, Céspedes arrived to 2016 Mets Spring Training 
with a variety of custom sports cars on display. His collection includes 
a custom 2016 Ford F-250, 2 custom Polaris Slingshots, a custom Lamborghini 
Aventador, an Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione, and a custom Jeep Wrangler all 
totaling a little under $1 million.[38][39][40][41][42][43] Cespedes also 
bought a 270-pound hog from a local county fair while at 2016 Mets Spring
