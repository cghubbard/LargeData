Eddie Clarence Murray (born February 24, 1956), nicknamed "Steady Eddie", 
is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman and designated hitter. 
Spending most of his MLB career with the Baltimore Orioles, he ranks fourth 
in team history in both games played and hits. Though Murray never won 
a Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, he finished in the top ten in MVP voting 
several times. After his playing career, Murray coached for the Cleveland 
Indians and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 2003.[1] In the New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract (2010), 
Murray is described as the fifth-best first baseman in major league history. 
He was 77th on the list of the Baseball's 100 Greatest Players by The Sporting 
News (1998). Murray was the eighth child of twelve and still has five sisters 
and four brothers. He has often quipped that as a child he did not have 
to go far for a pick-up baseball game. The games were quite fierce and 
his older brothers never let him win.[2] Murray played Little League baseball 
under coach Clifford Prelow, an ex-Dodger minor leaguer. (In his Hall of 
Fame induction speech, Murray thanked Prelow for teaching him not just 
the game of baseball, but love for the game as well.)[3] Prelow remembers 
that young Murray was a well behaved player.[4] Murray attended Locke High 
School in Los Angeles, where he batted .500 as a senior and was a teammate 
of Ozzie Smith. Murray was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the third 
round of the 1973 amateur draft and had several successful seasons in the 
minor leagues. He debuted at the major league level on April 7, 1977 and 
played in 160 games for the Orioles in his first season. He won the American 
League Rookie of the Year award by batting .283, hitting 27 home runs and 
contributing 88 RBI. With the Orioles from 1977 until 1988, Murray averaged 
28 home runs and 99 RBI and was a perennial candidate for the MVP award, 
twice finishing second in the voting. His best season was 1983, when he 
hit .306/.393/.538 with 110 RBI and a career-high 33 home runs; though 
a spectacular season, he finished second in the MVP voting. The Orioles 
also appeared in the post-season twice, in 1979 and 1983, and won the World 
Series in 1983. He won the Gold Glove Award three consecutive times from 
1982 to 1984. Murray's close-knit friendship with fellow Oriole Cal Ripken, 
Jr. was highly publicized in Baltimore at the time. Murray was traded on 
December 4, 1988 to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Juan Bell, Brian Holton, 
and Ken Howell and had three successful seasons with the Dodgers, knocking 
in 88, 95, and 96 runs. In 1990, Murray led the Major Leagues in hitting, 
but failed to win the National League batting crown; that went to Willie 
McGee, who already had enough plate appearances to qualify for it when 
he was traded from the National League's St. Louis Cardinals to the American 
League's Oakland A's. McGee won the NL batting crown with a .335 average, 
but hit only .274 the rest of the season in Oakland, for a season average 
of .324, .006 lower than Murray's major league leading .330 average. Prior 
to the 1992 season, Murray signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets. 
Murray was one of several acquisitions the Mets made (including Bobby Bonilla, 
Willie Randolph, and Bret Saberhagen) to try to regain their winning ways. 
However, in Murray's two years with the team they finished with 90 and 
103 losses, respectively. Murray hit his 400th career home run with the 
Mets early in the 1992 season and finished with 16 for the season, while 
driving in 93 runs and hitting .265. Despite the team's struggles in 1993, 
Murray hit 27 home runs to finish behind Bonilla for the team lead. Murray 
was one of three Mets to hit twenty or more home runs that year, with Bonilla 
hitting 34 and Jeff Kent hitting 20. Murray also led the team in RBI with 
100. This was the last time in his career that Murray hit the 100 RBI mark. 
Murray reached the 3,000-hit plateau as an Indian on June 30, 1995 at the 
Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome with a single to right field off Minnesota 
Twins pitcher Mike Trombley. In the 1995 World Series between the Cleveland 
Indians and the Atlanta Braves, Murray won Game 3 with a single in the 
bottom of the eleventh inning off of Alejandro Peña to score Álvaro Espinoza. 
The hit made the series 2–1, in favor of Atlanta. The Indians traded Murray 
back to Baltimore on July 21, 1996 for pitcher Kent Merker.[5] From 1996 
to 1997, Murray played for several teams, including the Cleveland Indians 
(1994–96), the Baltimore Orioles (1996), the Anaheim Angels (1997) and 
the Los Angeles Dodgers (1997). Although he no longer possessed the presence 
at the plate he had had in the 1980s, he was a valued and still consistent 
contributor for these teams. On September 6, 1996, he hit his 500th career 
home run—fittingly, the home run came as a member of the Orioles, and also 
came exactly one year to the day that Ripken had broken Lou Gehrig's streak 
of 2,130 consecutive games played. He retired after the 1997 season with 
504 home runs; as of 2011, Mickey Mantle is the only switch-hitter who 
has hit more home runs (536). Murray hit a home run from both sides of 
the plate in 11 games; he retired tied with Chili Davis for first place 
in this category. This co-record has since been broken by Mark Teixeira. 
Murray served as the hitting coach for the Cleveland Indians from 2002 
to 2005. He was with the Indians when inducted into the Hall of Fame. On 
June 14, 2007, Murray was fired as hitting coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
The Dodgers had just come off a three-game sweep of the New York Mets and 
had produced 31 hits and 18 runs. Former Dodger player Bill Mueller was 
named as interim replacement. In the late 1980s, Murray made a generous 
donation to the Baltimore City Parks and Recreation Department. This donation 
led to the establishment of the Carrie Murray Nature Center, named after 
Murray's late mother. In 2008, Murray released a charity wine called Eddie 
Murray 504 Cabernet, a nod to his 504 career home runs, with all of his 
proceeds donated to the Baltimore Community Foundation. On August 17, 2012, 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Murray with insider 
trading. The SEC alleged, in a civil claim, that Murray had "made approximately 
$235,314 in illegal profits after Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories Inc. 
publicly announced its plan to purchase Advanced Medical Optics through 
a tender offer."[6] Specifically, the SEC alleged that Murray had received 
a "tip" about the impending purchase offer before the offer was publicly 
announced, bought stock in Advanced Medical Optics because of the tip, 
and then sold the stock for the profits after the stock increased in value 
after Abbott Laboratories' plans were publicly announced.[7] According 
to the SEC, Murray received the tip from former Baltimore Orioles teammate 
Doug DeCinces, with whom he remained close friends after their playing 
careers ended. One year earlier, DeCinces had agreed to pay $2.5 million 
to settle the SEC's civil insider trading charges against him in the same 
case.[8][9] Murray agreed to settle the SEC's civil charges by paying a 
total of $358,151, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.[10][11] 
In 1998, he ranked number 77 on The Sporting News list of Baseball's 100 
Greatest Players,[12] and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Murray was the third player in history to reach 
500 home runs and 3,000 hits Hank Aaron and Willie Mays were the first 
two.[13] On Sunday, July 27, 2003, Murray, along with Gary Carter, was 
inducted into major league baseball's Hall of Fame.[2] More than 30,000 
people heard Murray talk about how hard it was to get to the Hall of Fame. 
He said that he was never about one person, but about the team. He thanked 
the "sea of black and orange" in the crowd and then pointed to the kids 
farthest in the back; (more than 300 inner-city little leaguers had come 
from Baltimore's Northwood Baseball League) and told them that one day 
"they would be here too".[14] Murray was named the fifth best first baseman 
in major league history in the New Bill James Historical Abstract (2010).[15]
