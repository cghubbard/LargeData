Nathan Edward Eovaldi (/ɛˈvældi/ e-VAL-dee; born February 13, 1990) is 
an American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Yankees of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He previously pitched in MLB for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and Miami Marlins. Eovaldi attended Alvin High School in Alvin, 
Texas, where he played for the school's baseball team. Eovaldi had Tommy 
John surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow 
during his junior year of high school.[1][2] In 2008, Eovaldi's senior 
year, he was an honorable mention on Texas' All-State team.[3] He committed 
to attend Texas A&M University on a college baseball scholarship.[2] The 
Los Angeles Dodgers selected Eovaldi in the 11th round of the 2008 MLB 
Draft. His draft stock had fallen because of his first Tommy John surgery. 
Eovaldi signed with the Dodgers, receiving a $250,000 signing bonus, forgoing 
his commitment to Texas A&M.[2] He made his way through the Dodgers' farm 
system, pitching for the Gulf Coast Dodgers of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast 
League in 2008 and the Great Lakes Loons of the Class A Midwest League 
in 2009. In 2010, with the Inland Empire 66ers of San Bernardino of the 
Class A-Advanced California League, Eovaldi was selected to the mid-season 
California League all-star team. Eovaldi was promoted to the Chattanooga 
Lookouts of the Class AA Southern League in 2011 and was selected to the 
mid-season all-star game. He had a 6–5 win–loss record with a 2.62 earned 
run average (ERA) for the Lookouts, where he started 19 games. He was also 
selected to the post-season All-Star team.[4] Eovaldi was called up to 
the majors for the first time on August 6, 2011, and was the starting pitcher 
that night against the Arizona Diamondbacks.[5] In the game he picked up 
the win, while pitching five innings, allowing only two runs while striking 
out seven. He also hit a single in his first major league at bat and scored 
a run. His seven strikeouts were tied for fourth in Dodgers' history for 
a major league debut and he was only the fourth Dodger pitcher to score 
a run in his debut since 1960.[6] Eovaldi became the first Dodger starter 
since Danny McDevitt in the 1957 season to start his career with four games 
of five innings or more while allowing two runs or less.[7] He made 6 starts 
for the Dodgers and was then moved to the bullpen in order to keep his 
innings down for the season.[8] He pitched in four games out of the bullpen 
late in the season. His 2011 totals included a 1–2 record and 3.63 ERA.[9] 
After beginning the 2012 season with Chattanooga, Eovaldi made his first 
appearance of the season for the Dodgers on May 29 when he started against 
the Milwaukee Brewers. He had four strikeouts, allowed 4 hits and 2 runs 
through 7 innings in a 1–2 loss. In 10 starts with the Dodgers, he had 
a 1–6 record with a 4.15 ERA.[10] On July 25, 2012, Eovaldi was traded, 
along with minor league pitcher Scott McGough, to the Miami Marlins for 
Hanley Ramírez and Randy Choate. In his first game with the Marlins, he 
got the win vs the San Diego Padres on July 28.[11] He started 12 games 
for the Marlins in 2012, with a 3–7 record and 4.43 ERA. He finished the 
season with a 4–13 record in 22 games with a 4.30 ERA, a 1.51 walks plus 
hits per inning pitched (WHIP) ratio, 47 walks, and 78 strikeouts in 119 1⁄3 
innings pitched.[10] In 2013, Eovaldi had a 4–6 record with a 3.39 ERA 
and 78 Strikeouts in 18 starts. In 2014, Eovaldi had a 6–14 record with 
a 4.37 ERA. He allowed 223 hits, the most in the National League. He set 
new career highs with 33 games started and 199 2⁄3 innings pitched.[12] 
On December 19, 2014, the Marlins traded Eovaldi, Garrett Jones, and Domingo 
Germán to the New York Yankees for Martín Prado and David Phelps.[13] Eovaldi 
made his first start for the Yankees on April 10, 2015 against the Boston 
Red Sox, where he pitched 5.1 innings allowing 2 runs on 8 hits. He was 
credited with a no-decision as the Yankees lost to the Red Sox 6–5 in 19 
innings.[14] Eovaldi developed a split-finger fastball, which led to improved 
results.[15] From June 20 through August 24, Eovaldi pitched to a 8–0 record 
with a 2.93 ERA. In September, Eovaldi experienced elbow inflammation, 
ending his regular season.[16] He went 14–3 with a 4.20 ERA for the season.[17] 
Eovaldi was prepared to pitch in the 2015 American League Division Series, 
but the Yankees were eliminated in the 2015 American League Wild Card Game.[18] 
On August 16, 2016, it was announced that he would miss the remainder of 
the 2016 season and possibly the 2017 season due to a torn flexor tendon 
and partially-torn ulnar collateral ligament in the elbow.[19] Several 
days later, the Yankees announced that Eovaldi had undergone his second 
Tommy John surgery.[20] Eovaldi is expected to miss the 2017 season, after
