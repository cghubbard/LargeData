Kenneth Joseph Silvestri (May 3, 1916 – March 31, 1992) was an American 
professional baseball player, coach and manager. During his 16-year playing 
career, he was a backup catcher in the Major Leagues over eight seasons 
scattered between 1939 through 1951, appearing for the Chicago White Sox 
(1939–40), New York Yankees (1941; 1946–47) and Philadelphia Phillies (1950–51). 
Silvestri was born in Chicago and attended Purdue University. A switch-hitter 
who threw right-handed, he stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 
200 pounds (91 kg). He served in the United States Army during World War 
II. As a big leaguer, Silvestri batted .217, with 44 hits, 11 doubles, 
one triple, five home runs and 25 RBI in 102 games played. As a member 
of the 1950 Phillies, he appeared in Game 2 of the 1950 World Series as 
a defensive replacement, spelling starting catcher Andy Seminick and handling 
Baseball Hall of Famer Robin Roberts for two scoreless innings. However, 
the opposing Yankees broke through to win the game after Silvestri was 
removed for a pinch hitter in the ninth.[1] Following his MLB playing career, 
Silvestri managed in the minor leagues in the Yankee farm system and coached 
for the Phillies (1952–53; 1959–60), Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves (1963–75) 
and the White Sox (1976; 1982). He also managed the Atlanta Braves for 
the final three games of the 1967 season after skipper Billy Hitchcock 
was fired.[2] The Braves lost all three games Silvestri managed.[3] Silvestri
