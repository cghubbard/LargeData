The Pecos League of Professional Baseball Clubs is an independent professional 
baseball league headquartered in Houston, which operates in cities in desert 
mountain regions throughout New Mexico, Arizona, southern Colorado, Kansas 
and West Texas. The league plays in cities that do not have Major or Minor 
League Baseball teams and is not affiliated with either. The Pecos League 
operated six teams in the 2011[1] and 2012 seasons and expanded to eight 
teams for 2013. Continued growth saw the league reach a high of 10 teams 
for 2014. The season is a highly condensed one, where teams may play 70 
games in 72 days, all for a weekly salary of $50 per player. The Pecos 
League also operates a spring developmental league, which is a one-month 
showcase beginning in March for recent college graduates and free agents 
looking to catch on to a full season league. In May 2014, Fox Sports 1 
aired a six-part documentary about life in the Pecos League, mostly based 
on the Trinidad Triggers. In August 2014, Jon Edwards made his major league 
debut with the Texas Rangers becoming the first player in Pecos League 
history to play in Major League Baseball. In September 2016, Chris Smith 
was called up to the Toronto Blue Jays becoming the 2nd player from the 
Pecos League to make a major league roster. For 2016, the Las Vegas Train 
Robbers moved to Topeka, Kansas. Expansion teams were added in Great Bend, 
Kansas[2] and Tucson, Arizona.[3][4][5] The Tucson Saguaros will play home 
games at Kino Veterans Memorial Stadium on Thursdays through Saturdays 
and at Warren Ballpark in Bisbee on Sundays. On February 25, 2016 it was
