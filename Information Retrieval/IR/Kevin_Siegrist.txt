Kevin Ryan Siegrist (born July 20, 1989) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). The 
Cardinals drafted him in 2008 from Palm Beach State College in Lake Worth, 
Florida. After spending a significant amount of time as a starting pitcher, 
Siegrist converted to relief full-time for 2013. In May, he earned recognition 
as the Cardinals Pitcher of the Month. He made his MLB debut the next month 
after spending five years in the minor leagues. For his rookie year, Siegrist 
posted a 0.45 earned run average (ERA) in 39 1⁄3 innings pitched (IP), 
striking out 50. After graduating from Wellington High School in Wellington, 
Florida, he attended Palm Beach State College, where he was a walk-on with 
the "Panthers" baseball team.[1][2] Siegrist was discovered purely by accident 
when a scout attending a Palm Beach State game to watch another player 
took notice of Siegrist's performance.[2] The Cardinals selected Siegrist 
in the 41st round of the 2008 MLB draft as the 1,235th player taken out 
of 1,504 total.[3] He spent the summer playing for the Gulf Coast League 
Cardinals.[1] In 2009, he pitched for the Batavia Muckdogs, then a Cardinals 
affiliate in the New York–Penn League. He appeared in ten games for Batavia, 
making one start and earning a victory while posting an overall season 
3.86 ERA.[1] The next season, 2010, was split between Batavia and the Johnson 
City Cardinals. Siegrist made a combined 14 starts between the two teams, 
finishing with a season ERA of 4.02 and a 4–4 overall record.[1] Kevin 
Siegrist again split time among two Cardinals minor league teams in 2011. 
He began the season in the Class A Midwest League with the Quad Cities 
River Bandits starting nine games, winning eight of them, and posting a 
low 1.15 ERA. He was the Topps' Midwest League Player of Month in May.[4] 
Siegrist fared less well after promotion to the Palm Beach Cardinals back 
near his Florida home, going 0–3 in eleven games as his ERA jumped to 3.42. 
However he did log the most innings pitched, 107, of any point yet in his 
career.[1] Persistent injuries, consisting of back pain and shoulder soreness, 
in part, slowed his progress.[3] Another year, another split season as 
Siegrist spent 2012 with Palm Beach before advancing to the Double-A Springfield 
Cardinals. A combined 7–2 record between the two teams, including 6–0 with 
Palm Beach, and 68 strikeouts over 87 IP[1] caught the attention of officials 
with main club as the St. Louis Cardinals added Siegrist to their 40-man 
roster after the 2012 season.[5] Siegrist started 2013 again with the Springfield 
Cardinals but the organization began to take a different strategy. Instead 
of grooming him to be a starter, the Cardinals predicted he would have 
a velocity increase as a full-time reliever, and as a left-hander, could 
serve as a valuable late-inning strategic piece.[3] He quickly moved up 
to the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League, where he 
spent just 7 2⁄3 IP after four years between the Rookie and A levels. Siegrist 
was named the Cardinals Minor League Pitcher of the Month in May. He posted 
an ERA of 1.95 and a record of 2–1 in 18 relief appearances combined at 
Springfield and Memphis.[6] In 27 2⁄3 IP, he allowed just 11 hits with 
10 bases on balls (BB) for a walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio (WHIP) 
of 0.759. In addition, he registered 44 SO for a ratio of 14.3 strikeouts 
per 9 innings pitched (K/9).[1] The Cardinals promoted Siegrist from Memphis 
to the major leagues on June 6, 2013.[7] He made his major league debut 
the same night as he took the mound in the 7th inning in relief of Shelby 
Miller in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks at Busch Stadium. Siegrist 
struck out four while allowing one hit in one and two-thirds inning of 
work.[8] As of his debut, 51 players from the 2008 MLB Draft had been on 
a major league roster, or 3.4%. Siegrist had also been just one of eight 
drafted in the 40th round or later that on a major league roster.[3] Siegrist 
proved difficult for Major League hitters as allowed a .128 batting average 
against (BAA); against left-handed hitters it was .118, and .138 against 
right-handers. For the season, he pitched 39 2⁄3 innings while allowing 
a team-low 0.45 ERA for all with at least at many innings pitched as he. 
With 50 SO, his K/9 ratio was 11.3.[9] In the World Series against the 
Boston Red Sox, he yielded a home run to David Ortiz, the Series MVP, but 
did not factor in the decision in that game. The Cardinals lost in six 
games.[10] After suffering a forearm injury early in 2014, his BAA increased 
to .267. He was far less effective, allowing 23 earned runs in 30 1⁄3 IP 
− he had allowed just two runs in all of 2013. His ERA was 6.82, and he 
also allowed 32 hits and 16 walks. In 2015, Siegrist became the primary 
setup man for closer Trevor Rosenthal. He started off with much dramatically 
improved results, due in part to restored fastball velocity.[11] He also 
increased his pitch efficiency, which started at 17.12 in 2013 and increased 
to 19.2 in 2014. In July 2015, he averaged 16 per inning. He also began 
varying his pitches more that season, relying much less on the fastball, 
and more on a changeup and slider.[12] Siegrist earned his first major 
league save by pitching the last two innings of a 6−1 win against the Cincinnati 
Reds on April 17.[13] In 38 1⁄3 innings into July, he struck out 49 batters. 
He had 15 holds, which ranked fourth in the National League (in July), 
to go with a 1.41 ERA and 1.10 WHIP.[11] He made 80th appearance of the 
season against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 30 in an 11–1 win and 
the club's 100th of season, became just the third left-handed pitcher in 
franchise history to make that many appearances in a season.[14] He led 
the major leagues in appearances with 81.[15] Continuing in the role as 
a setup reliever in 2016, Siegrist went on the DL on June 30 due to mononucleosis. 
To that point, he was tied for first in victories among NL relievers at 
5−2. Further, in 35 appearances, he posted a 2.78 ERA and one save and 
34 strikeouts in 32 1⁄3 IP. He returned from the DL on July 15.[16] Three 
primary pitches compose Siegrist's arsenal. He throws a fastball, circle 
changeup and a slider. According to Brooks Baseball, he easily reaches 
95 miles per hour (153 km/h) with his fastball, generating a high amount 
of swings and misses. All three of his pitches result in high amounts of 
fly balls and his breaking balls are deceptive to hitters. He also mixes 
in a curveball, but this is rare as he had thrown it just five times through
