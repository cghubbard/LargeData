The Colorado Rockies are a professional baseball team based in Denver, 
Colorado and owned since formation by Charles and Richard Monfort. The 
Rockies were created as an expansion team for the 1993 season and rose 
to a postseason appearance after three seasons and the 1994–95 strike. 
The Rockies have, however, not lived up to this promise since, playing 
in the postseason only in 2007 when they unexpectedly reached the World 
Series before being defeated by the Red Sox and in 2009. In 2012, the Rockies 
won only 64 games - the fewest in their history over a full season. The
