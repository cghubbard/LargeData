Michael Tejera (born October 18, 1976 in Havana, Cuba) is a former Major 
League Baseball pitcher. He played all or part of five seasons in the majors, 
and currently is a pitching coach for the GCL Nationals. Tejera made two 
playoff appearances in 2003 for the Florida Marlins, both in the NLCS against 
the Chicago Cubs. After pitching a scoreless inning in game two,[1] he 
took the loss in game three. He gave up just one hit in the latter game, 
a single to Kenny Lofton in the 11th inning. Lofton came around to score 
on a triple by Doug Glanville, which turned out to be the winning run.[2] 
In the 2003 NLCS, some fans humorously remember Tejera for throwing a ball 
into the stands from the mound after a pitch slipped from his hand midway 
through his delivery. After starting the 2009 season in the Mexican League, 
Tejera signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians on July 
10, 2009. He was let go at the end of the season, and in 2010 returned 
to the Mexican League with Tabasco. Currently he is the Pitching Coach
