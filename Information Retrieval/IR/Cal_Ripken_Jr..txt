Calvin Edwin "Cal" Ripken Jr. (born August 24, 1960), nicknamed "The Iron 
Man",[1] is an American former baseball shortstop and third baseman who 
played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles 
(1981–2001). One of his position's most offensively productive players, 
Ripken compiled 3,184 hits, 431 home runs, and 1,695 runs batted in during 
his career, and he won two Gold Glove Awards for his defense. He was a 
19-time All-Star and was twice named American League (AL) Most Valuable 
Player (MVP). Ripken is best known for holding the record for consecutive 
games played, 2,632, surpassing Lou Gehrig's streak of 2,130 that had stood 
for 56 years and that many deemed unbreakable. In 2007, he was elected 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, 
and currently has the fourth highest voting percentage of all time (98.53%). 
Born in Maryland, Ripken grew up traveling around the United States as 
his father, Cal Sr., was a player and coach in the Orioles' organization. 
After a fine career at Aberdeen High School, Ripken Jr. was drafted by 
the Orioles in the second round of the 1978 MLB draft. He reached the major 
leagues in 1981 as a third baseman, but the following year, he was shifted 
to shortstop, his long-time position for Baltimore. That year, Ripken also 
won the AL Rookie of the Year Award and began his consecutive games played 
streak. In 1983, he won a World Series championship and his first AL MVP 
Award. One of Ripken's best years came in 1991, when he was named an All-Star, 
won the Home Run Derby, and was recipient of his first All-Star Game MVP 
Award, his second AL MVP Award, and first Gold Glove Award. He broke the 
consecutive games played record on September 6, 1995, in his 2,131st consecutive 
game, which fans voted as the league's "most memorable moment" in an MLB.com 
poll; Ripken voluntarily ended his 17-year streak at 2,632 games, in 1998. 
He switched back to third base for the final five years of his career. 
In 2001, his final season, Ripken was named the All-Star Game MVP and was 
honored with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award. Ripken is considered 
one of the best shortstops and third basemen in baseball history. At 6 ft 
4 in (1.93 m), 225 lb (102 kg), he pioneered the way for the success of 
taller, larger shortstops. He is a member of the 3,000 hit club and is 
behind Derek Jeter and Honus Wagner for most hits by a shortstop. Ripken 
is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, 
Inc., whose goal is to grow the love of baseball from a grassroots level. 
Since his retirement, he has purchased three minor league baseball teams. 
He has been active in charity work throughout his career and is still considered 
an ambassador of the game. Ripken was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland, 
the son of Violet "Vi" Ripken (née Roberta) and Cal Ripken Sr. He has German, 
English, and Irish ancestry.[2][3] Though the Ripkens called Aberdeen, 
Maryland, their home, they were often on the move because of Cal Sr.'s 
coaching duties with the Baltimore Orioles organization.[4] Cal Sr., in 
fact, was in Topeka, Kansas with one of his teams when his son was born.[5] 
Cal Jr. grew up around baseball and got started in it at a very young age.[1] 
He was able to receive instruction from players on his father's teams, 
notably Doug DeCinces.[6] He also got advice from his father, who once 
remarked to his mother that his questions were better than the ones reporters 
had.[7] At the age of three, Ripken knew he wanted to be a ballplayer and, 
at the age of 10, Ripken "knew the game inside and out."[7][8] Ripken and 
his brother Billy attended Aberdeen High School.[9] They both played baseball 
there; Cal also played soccer.[10] He has two other siblings, Ellen and 
Fred.[11] Ripken began his high school career playing second base; his 
coach, Don Morrison, said, "I was considering moving him to short, but 
I was unsure if his arm was strong enough."[12] Despite Morrison's concerns, 
Ripken did move to shortstop as a sophomore, combining strong fielding 
with a team-leading 10 runs batted in (RBI).[10] Needing pitching help, 
the Aberdeen Eagles began using Ripken as a pitcher as well in his junior 
year. He responded by striking out 55 batters in 46 1⁄3 innings pitched 
with three shutouts while batting .339 with 21 hits and nine RBI.[13] He 
was named the Harford County Most Valuable Player (MVP) while helping Aberdeen 
become county champions for the first time since 1959.[14] During his senior 
year, Ripken again had a strong season, lifting his batting average to 
.688 at one point and posting a 0.79 ERA with 45 strikeouts over his first 
26 innings.[15] In the playoffs, Ripken pitched the state championship 
game against Thomas Stone High School.[16] The Eagles trailed 3–1 when 
Ripken, noting that rain was coming and that the game would be cancelled 
and replayed since the Eagles had not yet played the fourth inning, made 
nine throws to first base to ensure the game would be replayed.[16] When 
the game was played the next week, Ripken struck out 17, allowed two hits, 
and threw a complete game as Aberdeen won the state championship.[17] Ripken 
was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the second round of the 1978 Major 
League Baseball draft on a pick the Boston Red Sox forfeited in the re-entry 
draft by selecting Dick Drago.[18] On deciding to go straight from high 
school to the professional level, he said, "When the colleges started coming 
around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career 
in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and 
if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26."[19] Ripken 
played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles 
were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability.[20] The 
Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding 
it would be easier for him to transition back to pitching if necessary 
than it would be for him to start hitting again.[21] To begin Ripken's 
minor league career, the Orioles assigned him to the Bluefield Orioles 
of the rookie Appalachian League.[21] He batted .264 with 63 hits, no home 
runs, and 24 RBI, failing to make the league's all-rookie team.[22] In 
1979, Ripken moved up to the Single-A Miami Orioles of the Florida State 
League. Shortly into the season, Miami manager Lance Nichols decided to 
move Ripken to third base, saying, "Cal was having some problems at short, 
so naturally I decided to shift him to third ... Third base was a perfect 
fit for Cal and our team."[23] On July 2, Ripken hit his first professional 
home run, a game-winner in the 12th inning against Gary Abone of the West 
Palm Beach Expos.[24] Ripken batted .303, hit five home runs, led the league 
with 28 doubles, and had 54 RBI while playing in all 105 of Miami's games. 
He was named an All-Star after the season.[24] His performance earned him 
a brief call-up to the Charlotte Orioles of the Double-A Southern League; 
Ripken batted .180 in a month with them, albeit with three home runs.[25] 
Ripken began 1980 with Charlotte. His manager at Charlotte, Jimmy Williams, 
predicted him to set the team home run record, and Ripken did not disappoint.[26] 
At season's end, he had 25 home runs, besting the previous record by four. 
He also had 28 doubles, 78 RBI, and a .492 slugging percentage.[27] Ripken 
was named an All-Star while helping Charlotte win the Southern League championship.[27] 
In 1981, Ripken was added to Baltimore's 40-man roster. He attended spring 
training with the Orioles but was sent to the Rochester Red Wings of the 
Triple-A International League to start the season.[28] At Rochester, Ripken 
played in the longest professional baseball game. Ripken started at third 
base and played all 33 innings against the Pawtucket Red Sox (which featured 
another future Hall of Famer, Wade Boggs) in a game that took parts of 
three days to complete.[29] Ripken hit 23 home runs for Rochester while 
batting .288 with 75 RBI in 114 games.[30] He was named the International 
League Rookie of the Year.[31] The Orioles were planning to keep Ripken 
in Rochester through 1981, but searching for improvement in the second 
half of the 1981 season, they called him up on August 7.[32] Manager Earl 
Weaver planned to have Ripken take over the role of utility infielder Wayne 
Krenchicki, who had been sent down to make room for Ripken on the roster.[33] 
He made his debut on August 10 as a pinch runner for Ken Singleton in the 
12th inning of a game against the Kansas City Royals. Ripken scored on 
a hit by John Lowenstein, giving the Orioles the win.[34] His first major 
league hit came six days later against Dennis Lamp of the Chicago White 
Sox.[31] Ripken finished the season batting .182 without an extra-base 
hit as the Orioles finished fourth in the second half of the season.[35] 
Ripken received the third base job for the Orioles in 1982 when the team 
traded DeCinces before the start of the season.[36] He homered in his very 
first at bat of the first game of the Orioles' 1982 season against Dennis 
Leonard of Kansas City as part of three hits. However, he slumped to begin 
the season, as his batting average was .118 through May 1.[37] Ripken looked 
for advice from several Orioles players and coaches but was most aided 
by advice from Reggie Jackson: "Just know what you know you can do, not 
what everybody else tells you to do."[38] After that, Ripken hit well for 
the rest of the season.[39] On May 29, Ripken did not play the second game 
of a doubleheader, the last time he missed a game until 1998.[40] On July 
1, Weaver decided to permanently shift Ripken to shortstop, deciding that 
it was harder to find a shortstop who could hit than it was to find a third 
baseman who could hit.[41] Weaver said, "You never know. Rip might be a 
great shortstop."[41] Ripken hit 28 home runs that year en route to winning 
the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year Award.[42] Aided by Ripken, 
the Orioles contended for the playoffs until they lost to the Milwaukee 
Brewers on the final day of the season.[43] Ripken advanced even more in 
1983, having what would be one of the best years of his career. He played 
well all season on the way to earning the first of 19 All-Star berths.[44] 
Roommate Rick Dempsey gave this analysis of Ripken's performance: "Certainly 
there were pitchers who faced him in 1982 and made or tried to make adjustments 
against him. But Cal was determined and worked hard to offset their adjustments."[45] 
At season's end, Ripken had set Orioles' records for RBI by a shortstop 
(102) and hits by anybody (211).[46] He led the major leagues in hits and 
doubles (47) while also leading the AL with 121 runs scored.[46] As a shortstop, 
he led the league in fielding percentage (.970), assists (534), and double 
plays (111), although he did not win the Gold Glove Award.[46] After the 
season, he was named the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP), hitting .318 with 
27 home runs.[46] Ripken became the first player in MLB history to win 
Rookie of the Year and MVP Awards in consecutive seasons. Ripken made the 
playoffs for the first time as the Orioles won the AL East in 1983.[47] 
The Orioles defeated the White Sox in the ALCS before beating the Philadelphia 
Phillies four games to one in the 1983 World Series. In the series Ripken 
hit just .167 with no homers and only one RBI.[48] Although not contributing 
significantly in the World Series with his bat, he made a number of key 
plays defensively at shortstop, including the final out of the series on 
a Garry Maddox lineout in Game 5.[49] Before the 1984 season, Ripken signed 
a four-year contract for "about" $1 million a year, the largest contract 
the Orioles had ever given to a player of his age.[50] Again, he was named 
to the All-Star Game.[51] He racked up another fine season, batting .304 
with 27 home runs, 86 RBI, and 103 runs scored.[51] Although he failed 
to win a Gold Glove, he set an AL record with 583 assists.[51] The Orioles 
had a winning record but only managed to finish in fifth place.[51] Ripken's 
streak nearly came to an end in 1985. Against the Texas Rangers in the 
second game of the season, he sprained his ankle on a fielding play. Ripken 
finished the game, but afterwards Dr. Charles Silverstein ordered him to 
rest for 24 hours. However, the Orioles had an off day after that game, 
and Ripken was back for their next game.[52] During the season, Ripken 
was managed by his father when Cal Sr. filled in between Joe Altobelli 
and Weaver for one game on June 14.[53] Ripken finished the year batting 
.282 with 26 home runs and 110 RBI while also leading the league with 123 
double plays and 286 putouts.[54] During June 1986, Ripken recorded a 17-game 
hitting streak.[55] It was a tough season for the Orioles, as they finished 
last for the first time in their tenure in Baltimore.[56] In a speech to 
the team before the All-Star break, Weaver criticized the healthy players 
on the team for not hitting "Except [Ripken]. Do you know the kid hasn't 
missed an infield practice all year? Now, he's going to the All-Star Game."[57] 
He batted .282 with 81 RBI, a drop partly because the Orioles scored 110 
fewer runs than the year before. He was the first Oriole other than Eddie 
Murray since 1979 to lead the team in home runs, with 25.[56] Cal Ripken 
Sr. replaced the retired Weaver as manager of the Orioles at the beginning 
of the 1987 season. That year, Ripken Sr. became the first manager to write 
two of his sons into the lineup card when both Ripken Jr. and his brother 
and fellow Oriole, Billy Ripken, played in the same game on July 11.[58] 
Later in the season, Ripken Sr. decided to take Ripken Jr. out of the game 
on September 14, in a blow-out loss to the Toronto Blue Jays at Exhibition 
Stadium. Ron Washington replaced him in the eighth inning, ending Ripken's 
streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played.[59] Ripken Sr. called the streak 
a "burden" after the game, saying, "I had to do it sometime."[59] Consecutive 
innings streaks have not always been recorded, but Ripken's remains unchallenged 
by historians.[59] Ripken finished the year batting a career-low .252, 
but he still hit 27 home runs, had 98 RBI, and walked a career-high 81 
times. He also recorded a .982 fielding percentage.[60] The Orioles considered 
having Ripken replace Ray Knight at third base in 1988, but they decided 
to keep him at shortstop.[61] After the Orioles started the season 0–6, 
Ripken Sr. was fired and replaced by Frank Robinson.[62] The Orioles started 
the year 0–21, with Ripken slumping as well to open the season.[63] He 
finished the year batting just .264, although he led major league shortstops 
with 23 home runs and 81 RBI.[64] He also had a particularly memorable 
play in the All-Star Game, making a tremendous catch and strong throw to 
retire Will Clark in the second inning.[65] Ken Rosenthal of the Baltimore 
Sun called it "the gem of the evening."[65] During the 1988 season, Ripken 
had signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth year, preventing 
him from being a free agent at season's end.[66] On August 2, 1989, he 
and Billy combined for seven hits against the Boston Red Sox, with Cal 
Jr. providing a game-winning hit late in the game.[67] That was an AL record 
for hits by brothers; the major league record was held by Lloyd and Paul 
Waner, who had eight on June 25, 1932.[67] Fifteen days later, he passed 
Steve Garvey by playing in his 1,208th straight game, moving to third on 
baseball's all-time list behind Lou Gehrig and Everett Scott.[68] Despite 
this accomplishment, Ray Robinson of the New York Times wrote, "Few regarded 
Ripken... or anyone else, as the successor to the Iron Horse."[69] The 
Orioles, after posting three straight losing seasons, contended for the 
playoffs most of the year before missing out in the final week of the season.[70] 
Ripken slumped in September, as he had only seven hits in his final 55 
at bats.[70] He batted .257 in 1989 but was especially impressive for his 
fielding; he once went 47 games in a row without an error and finished 
the year with a .990 fielding percentage.[71] Ripken slumped offensively 
in 1990, batting .209 through his first 59 games.[72] However, throughout 
the year he impressed players and fans with his fielding.[72] On June 12, 
he broke Mark Belanger's Baltimore record for most consecutive errorless 
chances by a shortstop.[72] He went 67 straight games before suffering 
what was originally scored an error on June 26.[73] However, official scorer 
Bill Steka decided the error was really Mike Devereaux's fault and changed 
the call the next day.[73] Ripken continued the streak to 95 games, breaking 
the Major League record for shortstops and setting the AL record for infielders 
other than third basemen.[74] On June 12, he also passed Scott to move 
into second place all-time for consecutive games played. The milestone 
came at Memorial Stadium; however, the fans booed him because of his offensive 
slump.[72] Ripken finished the year batting .250, leading the Orioles with 
21 home runs, 84 RBI, 150 hits, and 78 runs scored.[75] He and Billy tied 
for the team lead with 28 doubles.[75] Despite his fielding accomplishments, 
Ozzie Guillén won the Gold Glove Award.[76] Some felt that Ripken should 
have won the award: Tim Kurkjian called the vote a "crime", and Bobby Valentine 
stated that he was, "embarrassed by the actions of my peers."[76] Ripken 
had a career year in 1991.[77] Through the All-Star break, his batting 
average was .348, making him the first shortstop to be leading the league 
in average through that point since Lou Boudreau in 1947.[78] He finished 
the season by hitting .323 with 34 home runs and 114 RBI.[77] In addition, 
Ripken hit 46 doubles, stole a career-high six bases and was caught once, 
and hit five triples while posting his career lowest strikeout rate and 
lowest number of strikeouts in a season with 600 or more plate appearances.[77] 
He became the first Major League shortstop ever to have 30 home runs and 
200 or more hits or 30 home runs and 40 or more doubles.[77] Ripken won 
his second AL MVP award, his first Gold Glove Award, the All-Star Game 
MVP Award (going two for three including a three-run home run off Dennis 
Martínez), the Gatorade Home Run Derby contest (hitting a then-record 12 
home runs in 22 swings, including seven consecutive homers to start the 
contest), Louisville Slugger "Silver Slugger Award", Associated Press (AP) 
Player of the Year Award, and The Sporting News Player of the Year Award.[79] 
The only other player in MLB history to win all those awards in the same 
season, excluding the Home Run Derby, was Maury Wills in 1962.[80] Ripken 
was the first player to win the Home Run Derby and All-Star Game MVP Award 
in the same year.[18] As for his regular-season AL MVP, he was the first 
to win the award while playing with a sub-.500 club; the Orioles finished 
in sixth place that year with a 67–95 record.[81] At the end of the 1991 
season, Memorial Stadium, the Orioles' home since 1954, saw its last MLB 
game against the Tigers. Ripken was the last Oriole to bat at the stadium, 
hitting into a double play against Detroit's Frank Tanana on Oct 6, 1991.[82] 
During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles tried to work out a new 
contract.[83] Several times throughout the season, Ripken endured batting 
slumps.[83] He said after the season, "I don't like to make excuses for 
the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted ... I just felt like 
the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or 
wrong, it was bothering me."[84] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a 
five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the 
time.[85] Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' 
fans late in the season.[86] He finished the year batting .251 with career-lows 
in home runs (14) and RBI (72).[87] The Orioles contended for the playoffs 
much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27.[88] However, 
he did win his second Gold Glove Award.[89] For the first time in Ripken's 
career, he became the only Ripken to be a member of the Orioles' organization, 
as the Orioles ousted his father as coach and traded Billy to Texas.[90] 
His slump continued at the start of the 1993 season, but Ripken managed 
to get out of it in May by adopting a taller batting stance.[91] Because 
of his early-season struggles, some criticized him for playing every day.[92] 
Bobby Bonds said of Ripken's playing every day, "That's idiotic. If I were 
his manager, he'd be out of there."[92] Oriole coach Davey Lopes responded 
that only Ripken could tell whether or not he needed a day off.[92] On 
June 6, Ripken injured his knee during a brawl against the Seattle Mariners 
and was convinced for most of the next day that he would be unable to play.[93] 
However, the knee felt better at gametime, enabling the streak to continue.[93] 
Ripken achieved a personal milestone on July 10, when he collected his 
2,000th career hit, during a game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards against 
Wilson Álvarez of the White Sox.[94] Because of Ripken's struggles, most 
managers and some sportswriters felt he should be left out of the All-Star 
Game in Baltimore that year; however, the fans gave him over two million 
votes to ensure his spot.[95] Following the All-Star break, Ripken's hitting 
improved greatly, as he batted .300 with 14 home runs and 46 RBI for the 
rest of the season.[96] He finished the year batting .257 with 24 home 
runs and 90 RBI.[97] Before the 1994 season, the Elias Sports Bureau informed 
the Orioles that Ripken had surpassed Ernie Banks for most career home 
runs as a shortstop with his 278th on July 15 against Scott Erickson.[98] 
Banks met Ripken at a ceremony on February 9 and said, "I'm extremely happy 
that he broke this record because it give me a chance to come back and 
be remembered too."[98] Ripken started the season strong, batting .340 
with 19 RBI through April.[99] On May 24, Ripken had six RBI, including 
his 300th home run against Teddy Higuera, as the Orioles rallied from a 
5–0 deficit to defeat the Brewers 13–5.[100] On August 1, he played in 
his 2,000th consecutive game, a 1–0 victory over the Twins at the Metrodome.[101] 
Through 112 games, Ripken batted .315 with 13 home runs and 75 RBI before 
the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cancelled the rest of the season.[102] 
Ripken's average fell to .262 in 1995; he hit 17 home runs and had 88 RBI.[103] 
However, his season highlight came on September 6. Many baseball fans within 
and out of the United States tuned into ESPN to watch Ripken surpass Lou 
Gehrig's 56-year-old record for consecutive games played (2,130 games). 
The game, between the Orioles and the California Angels, still ranks as 
one of the network's most watched baseball games (Baseball's most-watched 
game was Game 7 of the 1986 World Series). Cal's children, Rachel and Ryan, 
threw out the ceremonial first balls. Both President Bill Clinton and Vice 
President Al Gore were at the game; Clinton was with the commentators on 
ESPN for the Orioles' half of the fourth inning and called Ripken's fourth 
inning home run. When the game became official after the Angels' half of 
the fifth inning, the numerical banners that displayed Ripken's streak 
on the wall of the B&O Warehouse outside the stadium's right field wall 
changed from 2130 to 2131.[104][105] The crowd in the stands, the opposing 
players and all four umpires gave Ripken a standing ovation lasting more 
than 22 minutes, one of the longest standing ovations for any athlete; 
ESPN did not go to a commercial break during the entire ovation. During 
the ovation, Ripken did a lap around the entire Camden Yards warning track 
to shake hands and give high-fives to the fans.[105] "Tonight I stand here, 
overwhelmed, as my name is linked with the great and courageous Lou Gehrig. 
I'm truly humbled to have our names spoken in the same breath. This year 
has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in ballparks all over the country. 
People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they demonstrated 
their love of the game of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. 
Tonight, I want to make sure you know how I feel. As I grew up here, I 
not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being 
a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank 
you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest 
place to play."[106] "Bobby Bonilla and Rafael Palmeiro pushed me out of 
the dugout and said, 'Hey, if you don't do a lap around this thing, we'll 
never get the game started.' I thought it was a ridiculous sort of thing ... 
but as I started to do it, the celebration of 50,000 started to be very 
one-on-one and very personal. I started seeing people I knew ... Those 
were the people that had been around the ballpark all those years, and 
it was really a wonderful human experience."[58] Ripken began the 1996 
season slowly, but his playing improved as the season went on.[107] On 
June 14 at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City against the Royals, Ripken broke 
the world record of consecutive games played by playing in his 2,216th. 
The record had been held by Sachio Kinugasa of Japan. Kinugasa was at the 
game to watch Ripken break his record.[108] On July 15, Ripken was moved 
to third base as an experiment, with Manny Alexander taking the shortstop 
position.[109] He was told the change would be permanent but was moved 
back to shortstop after Alexander had one hit in his six games at shortstop.[110] 
Ripken appeared in 163 games during the regular season in 1996, batting 
.278 with 26 home runs, 102 RBI, and a .980 fielding percentage at shortstop.[103] 
He returned to the playoffs for the first time in 13 years as the Orioles 
won the AL Wild Card. In the AL Division Series, Baltimore defeated Cleveland 
in four games, with Ripken batting .444 in the series.[103][111] His average 
fell to .250 in the ALCS as the Orioles were defeated in five games by 
the Yankees.[112] In 1997, the Orioles signed free agent shortstop Mike 
Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to third base 
permanently.[107] General manager Pat Gillick said that the move was made 
not because of problems by Ripken but because more defensive options were 
available at shortstop than at third base.[107] Had Ripken not wanted to 
move back to third base, the Orioles likely would have signed Tim Naehring 
instead.[107] Ripken was scheduled to become a free agent following the 
1997 season, but at the start of the year he agreed to a two-year extension 
with the Orioles.[113] During the season, he suffered from nerve damage 
that at times kept him from being able to sit on the bench.[114] He did 
not miss a game, though, and batted .270 with 17 home runs and 84 RBI as 
the Orioles again made the playoffs, this time by winning the AL East.[103][115] 
Ripken batted .438 as the Orioles defeated the Mariners in four games in 
the ALDS.[103] He batted .348 and hit a home run in the ALCS, but the Orioles 
fell to Cleveland in six games.[103] Ripken batted .271 with 14 home runs 
and 61 RBI in 1998.[103] On September 20, before the final home game of 
the season against the Yankees, Ripken decided to end his streak at 2,632 
games, having surpassed Gehrig's previous record by 502 games. Rookie third 
baseman Ryan Minor started in his place, at first thinking it was a rookie 
prank. Realizing that the streak was coming to an end, the fans, his teammates, 
and the visiting Yankees (with David Wells being the first to notice that 
Ripken was not playing during batting practice) gave Ripken an ovation 
after the game's first out was recorded. Ripken later stated that he decided 
to end the streak at the end of the season to avoid any offseason controversy 
about his playing status, and to end the streak entirely on his own terms 
while he still could.[116] Ripken returned to the lineup for the final 
seven games of the season, on the road against the Toronto Blue Jays and 
Boston Red Sox. In 1999, Ripken had the highest batting average of his 
career, at .340.[103] Although he was injured at both the beginning and 
the end of the 1999 season and also mourned the loss of his father and 
former coach Cal Ripken Sr. only a few days before 1999's opening game, 
he hit 18 homers in 332 at-bats (one HR every 18.4 AB's).[103][117][118][119] 
He had the best individual game of his career, going 6 for 6 with 2 home 
runs off John Smoltz and tying a club record with 13 total bases against 
the Atlanta Braves on June 13.[120] On September 3, he hit the 400th home 
run of his career against Rolando Arrojo of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[121] 
Ripken's 1999 season ended early due to injury when he was only nine hits 
away from joining the 3,000 hit club.[122] He achieved the milestone early 
in the 2000 season in an April game against the Twins at the Metrodome 
when he singled off reliever Héctor Carrasco. Ripken had a good night at 
the plate, recording three hits, the third of which was the milestone.[123] 
Ripken missed all of July and August with a back injury. He was selected 
to the All-Star Game but sat out due to the injury, marking the first All-Star 
Game that he missed since his rookie season.[124][125] In 83 games, Ripken 
batted .256 (his lowest total since 1992) with 15 home runs and 56 RBI.[103] 
In June 2001, Ripken announced he would retire at the end of the season.[126] 
He was voted the starting third baseman in the All-Star Game at Seattle's 
Safeco Field on July 10, 2001.[127] In a tribute to Ripken's achievements 
and stature in the game, shortstop Alex Rodriguez (unknowingly foreshadowing 
his own future) insisted on exchanging positions with third baseman Ripken 
for the first inning, so that Ripken could play shortstop as he had for 
most of his career. That move allowed Ripken to claim the record of most 
MLB All-Star Game appearances at shortstop. In the third inning, Ripken 
made his first plate appearance and was greeted with a standing ovation. 
Ripken then homered off the first pitch from Chan Ho Park. Ripken ended 
up with All-Star MVP honors, becoming one of four players in MLB history 
with multiple All Star Game MVP Awards (1991 and 2001) and the only player 
to be named All-Star Game MVP in two different decades.[128] The Orioles 
planned to retire Ripken's #8 in a ceremony before the final home game 
of the 2001 season, in late September. Ripken's final game was originally 
set to be played at Yankee Stadium; however, the September 11, 2001 attacks 
led to the postponement of a week's worth of games. The games missed were 
added onto the end of the season's schedule. Since all the games the Orioles 
missed were at home, this changed the location of Ripken's final game to 
Oriole Park, much to the delight of Orioles fans.[129] On October 6, Ripken 
ended his career in the on-deck circle in the bottom of the ninth inning. 
Longtime teammate Brady Anderson, also playing in his last game for the 
Orioles, swung and missed on a fastball high and tight on a 3–2 count to 
end the game.[130] After the game, Ripken gave a speech thanking the fans 
for their support over 20 seasons.[131] Ripken was healthier in his final 
season than he had been over his last two, as he appeared in 128 games. 
He batted a career-low .239 with 14 home runs and 68 RBI.[103] Throughout 
his career, Ripken has contributed his time and money to numerous charitable 
organizations. Following the signing of his new contract in 1984, Ripken 
announced he would distribute 1984 Orioles tickets to underprivileged children 
in Harford County, donate to the Harford Center, and donate to the Baltimore 
School for the Performing Arts.[132] In 1988, he and wife Kelly founded 
the Cal Ripken Jr., Lifelong Learning Center, which is dedicated to teaching 
adults to read.[133] In 1992, MLB recognized him with the Roberto Clemente 
Award.[134] Ripken has made donations to many various charitable causes, 
including donations supporting research on Lou Gehrig's disease. After 
he broke Gehrig's record, the Orioles, along with private donors, created 
the Cal Ripken/Lou Gehrig Fund for Neuromuscular Research at Johns Hopkins 
University.[135] Along with his brother Billy, he formed the Cal Ripken 
Sr., Foundation in 2001 to give underprivileged children the opportunity 
to attend baseball camps around the country and learn the game. The Foundation 
is a branch of Ripken Baseball.[136] In addition to controlling these camps 
and Ripken's minor league teams, Ripken Baseball operates for-profit camps 
and designs ballfields for youth, college, and professional teams.[137] 
He gives speeches about his time in baseball and some of the lessons he 
has learned. Between 2001 and 2004, inclusive, Ripken served as commissioner 
of the White House Tee Ball Initiative of President George W. Bush, in 
which capacity he worked to promote the value of teamwork amongst players 
and volunteership amongst the public and helped to teach tee ball fundamentals 
to teams of children at the White House.[138] In 2007, Ripken, along with 
Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Warrick Dunn, Mia Hamm, Jeff 
Gordon, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, 
and Alonzo Mourning founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization, 
which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and 
inspires millions of non-athletes to volunteer and support the community.[139] 
Ripken also announced a partnership with Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities, 
with the donation of US$1 million in cash and equipment from the Cal Ripken 
Sr. Foundation.[140] On August 13, 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice announced that Ripken had been named Special Sports Envoy for the 
US State Department and that he would be going to China in October: "... we're 
just delighted that somebody of Cal Ripken's stature is going to be someone 
who will go out and represent America so well and represent what we consider 
to be American values, but universal values; that hard work and diligence 
and the willingness to really put it all on the line every day is something 
that kids need to learn", said Rice.[141][142] "A Shortstop in China" premiered 
on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's 
trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while 
nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy.[143] The documentary included footage 
from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing 
to Guangzhou.[144] The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment 
from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly 
to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, 
Karen Hughes.[143] On May 31, 2008, Ripken received an honorary Doctor 
of Humanities degree from the University of Delaware and served as the 
university's commencement speaker.[145] On May 19, 2013 Ripken received 
an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from the University of Maryland 
while serving as the university's general commencement speaker.[146] In 
an interview with Robinson, Ripken said, "My personal philosophy is to 
get a feeling of fulfillment through my work. I have a desire to create 
something. I guess that's why I've long been fascinated by two books, The 
Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged [both by Ayn Rand]. The leading figure 
in 'The Fountainhead,' an architect named Howard Roark, is someone I've 
thought about a good deal."[69] At 6 ft 4 in, 225 lb (1.93 m, 102 kg), 
Ripken was a departure from the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, 
fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively difficult position but often 
did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder 
might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra 
and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans to be part of Ripken's legacy.[58][147][148] 
Nonetheless, Ripken demonstrated the ability to play excellent defense 
at shortstop, and as a result remained a fixture there for well over a 
decade, leading the league in assists several times, winning the Gold Glove 
twice, and, in 1990, setting the MLB record for best fielding percentage 
in a season at his position.[51][74][89] Though not a flashy fielder, Ripken 
displayed excellent fundamentals, and studied batters and even his own 
pitching staff so he could position himself to compensate for his lack 
of physical speed.[149] Ripken's legacy as a fielder is reflected by his 
place near the top of almost every defensive statistical category—he holds 
at least one all-time record (for either season, career, or most seasons 
leading the league) in assists, putouts, fielding percentage, double plays, 
and fewest errors. Ripken's career range factor was 4.73 (and as high as 
5.50 for a single season), a mark few shortstops have reached.[103] Ripken's 
power, which led to records such as most home runs by a shortstop and 13th 
place in career doubles, had consequences. His propensity to drive the 
ball often led to his grounders getting to fielders quickly for tailor-made 
double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who 
had grounded into the most double plays in his career.[150] Ripken is third 
on the fielding side for double plays by a shortstop (1565, behind Omar 
Vizquel's 1734 and Ozzie Smith's 1590).[151] Ripken was also notable for 
never settling on a signature batting stance during his long career. Sometimes 
referred to as "the man of 1,000 stances", Ripken would change his stance 
in response to a slump, or if his current choice "didn't feel good."[152] 
When asked about his propensity for experimentation during an interview, 
Ripken responded that a batting stance, "was only a starting point."[152] 
A poll of fans by MLB.com ranked Ripken's 2,131'st straight game the "Most 
Memorable Moment" in MLB history, leading such moments as Gehrig's farewell 
speech in 1939 and Jackie Robinson's breaking of the color barrier in 1947.[153] 
The writeup in the 1996 Sporting News Baseball Guide, which was written 
shortly after Ripken set the record, called the streak "what almost everyone 
considered the high point of the major league season."[154] In 2005, the 
Orioles honored Ripken on the 10th anniversary of his 2,131st consecutive 
game. After the top of the fifth inning, the numbers 2130 on the warehouse 
behind the stadium changed to 2131, just as they did on September 6, 1995.[155] 
Ripken has stated that he never felt comfortable being compared to Gehrig. 
"Lou has monstrous numbers and was like Babe Ruth. How was it possible 
to compare him to me? But I realized what we did share is playing in consecutive 
games. It was still uncomfortable for me. When you're mentioned with him, 
I'm not sure you fully understand what it means."[156] Billy and Cal Ripken 
are one of only four two-brother combinations in major league history to 
play second base/shortstop on the same club. The others are Garvin and 
Granny Hamner for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945; the twins Eddie and 
Johnny O'Brien with the Pittsburgh Pirates in the mid-1950s, and Frank 
and Milt Bolling for the Detroit Tigers in 1958.[157] On January 9, 2007, 
Ripken was elected to the Hall of Fame, appearing on 537 out of 545 of 
the ballots cast (98.53%), eight votes short of a unanimous selection. 
His percentage is the fourth highest in history, behind Ken Griffey Jr. 
(99.32 percent), Tom Seaver who received 98.84 percent of the vote and 
Nolan Ryan who received 98.79 percent. Tony Gwynn, who was appearing on 
his first ballot as well, was chosen alongside Ripken. Both Hall of Fame-Elects 
were formally inducted on July 29, 2007.[158] The induction ceremony was 
attended by a record 75,000 people including special guests of Ripken: 
John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Steve Geppi, and Ron Shapiro (Ripken's agent 
during his career).[159][160] Ripken has received several tributes outside 
of baseball. On September 23, 2001, the NASCAR Winston Cup series and MBNA 
renamed the fall race at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware, 
naming the race the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400. The race paid tribute to the 
legacy of Ripken, who was in attendance greeting the competing drivers 
as they crossed the stage during driver introductions. Driver Bobby Labonte 
had a special paint scheme on his #18 Interstate Batteries car featuring 
Baltimore Orioles colors along with Ripken's retirement seal. The race 
was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was then driving the #8 car. The race 
was also the first race held after the September 11, 2001, attacks as the 
race scheduled for Loudon a week earlier had been postponed in the wake 
of the attacks.[161] On March 30, 2008, I-395's eastern branch in Baltimore, 
from I-95 to Conway Street, was named Cal Ripken Way.[162] Because of Ripken's 
success during his career, he became a prominent advertising figure, appearing 
in advertisements for brands such as Nike, Chevrolet, True Value Hardware, 
Wheaties, PowerAde, and other companies, some of which were small, Maryland 
businesses. These advertisements would often stress Ripken's "dependability, 
durability, and wholesomeness", linking that to their product. Ripken became 
an emblem to Americans through his hard work, loyalty to the Orioles, and 
his charity off the field.[163] Ripken was humble about his success, once 
saying, I have talent, no doubt. My advantage is that I know the game well. 
The reason is that I grew up in it and had a good teacher in my father. 
I'm sure that whatever I am as a man and a ballplayer comes from the way 
I was raised. But am I a superstar? Oh, no. I don't think I stack up with 
the great players in the league. Author Glen Macnow responded to Ripken's 
comments by writing, "Anyone who has seen Cal Ripken Jr., play knows differently."[164] 
Ripken married the former Kelly Geer at Towson United Methodist Church 
on Friday, November 13, 1987.[165] They have a daughter, Rachel,[166] and 
a son, Ryan.[167] Ryan, also a baseball player, was drafted by the Orioles 
in the 20th round of Major League Baseball's 2012 amateur draft.[168] However, 
he chose to attend college instead, beginning his freshman year at the 
University of South Carolina in 2012.[167] He transferred to Indian River 
Community College and was drafted in the 15th round of the Major League 
Baseball's 2014 amateur draft by the Washington Nationals. It was reported 
on April 28, 2016, that Ripken and his wife Kelly had divorced[169] after 
a one-year separation. Ripken's mother, Violet Ripken, was kidnapped at 
gunpoint and safely returned on July 24, 2012. She was gone for 12 hours 
before her disappearance was reported to authorities.[170] On October 15, 
2013, she was approached by a man with a handgun in a parking lot at the 
NBRS Bank in Aberdeen, Maryland. The man demanded her car, but she activated 
a key alarm and he fled. She was unharmed. Lt. Frederick Bundick, spokesman 
for the Aberdeen Police, said the two incidents appeared unrelated.[171] 
Ripken has written nearly thirty books, some of which are mentioned here.[172] 
After the 1996 season, he released an autobiography titled The Only Way 
I Know, co-written with Mike Bryan, which was a New York Times bestseller.[173][174] 
Following his retirement, he wrote several more, including Play Baseball 
the Ripken Way: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Fundamentals, also 
written by his brother Billy and co-authored by Larry Burke, in 2005. He 
released the book Parenting Young Athletes the Ripken Way, co-written with 
Rick Wolff, in 2006 after seeing too many young athletes whom he felt were 
being pressured unnecessarily by their parents. He said, "I was thinking, 
'This just creates too much pressure on kids.' They need to find an environment 
in which they can explore their game ... without all these kinds of pressures 
being brought to bear. Once I started thinking about it, I saw we had more 
than enough to fill a book."[175] Then in 2007, he released three books, 
starting with Coaching Youth Baseball the Ripken Way, also written by his 
brother Billy and co-authored by Scott Lowe, which highlights 50 practice 
drills, topics include coaching responsibly, goal setting for youth, and 
effective practice planning.[176] Later, in April of that year, he released 
two more books: Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the 
Difference, co-written with Donald T. Phillips, described as a motivational 
guide to success; and The Longest Season, co-written with Ron Mazellan, 
a children's book about the Orioles' 1988 season.[177] In 2011, he released 
Hothead, a children's fiction book co-written with Kevin Cowherd which 
was also a New York Times bestseller.[178] In addition, he has been writing 
a weekly youth sports advice newspaper column in the Baltimore Sun since 
2005.[179] In addition to his writing, Ripken himself has been the subject 
of several books. In 1995, Harvey Rosenfeld released a biography on him 
entitled Iron Man: The Cal Ripken Jr., Story.[180] Later, in 2007, Jeff 
Seidel released a biography on him entitled, Iron Man: Cal Ripken Jr., 
a Tribute.[181] A children's biography of Ripken, Cal Ripken Jr., Quiet 
Hero was published in 1993 by Lois Nicholson.[182] In addition, Ripken 
has been the subject of scholarly publications analyzing the impact of 
his career.[163][183] Ripken owns several minor league baseball teams. 
In 2002, he purchased the Utica Blue Sox of the New York–Penn League and 
moved them to his hometown of Aberdeen, renaming them the Aberdeen IronBirds. 
The team is the Short-season Single-A affiliate team in the Orioles' system 
and plays at Ripken Stadium.[184] On June 28, 2005, he announced that he 
was purchasing the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League, a 
Single-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants.[185] At the end of the 
2008 season, Ripken purchased the Vero Beach Devil Rays of the Single-A 
advanced Florida State League and moved them to Port Charlotte, Florida, 
where they were renamed the Charlotte Stone Crabs.[186][187] On January 
10, 2007, Ripken expressed interest in purchasing the Baltimore Orioles 
if current owner Peter Angelos were to sell the team. He had yet to be 
approached about the potential purchase of the team.[188] Though he has 
not purchased them, Ripken was quoted in a July 17, 2010, Associated Press 
article as saying he would consider rejoining the Orioles part-time as 
an advisor and full-time after his son graduated from high school in 2012.[189] 
In October 2007, Ripken began working as a studio analyst for TBS Sports 
during the 2007 Major League Baseball playoffs.[190] He has continued to 
serve in this role since then.[191] Ripken is on the Board of Directors 
of ZeniMax Media.[192] On February 28, 2008, Ripken announced his venture 
into the massively multiplayer online sports game market with "Cal Ripken's 
Real Baseball".[193] The Ripken Experience is a group of sports complexes. 
The first opened in Aberdeen, Maryland. A second location with nine baseball 
fields is located in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Opened in 2006, it cost 
$26 million with $7 million more spent since then. A third location is 
set to open in summer 2016 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.[194] Italics denotes
