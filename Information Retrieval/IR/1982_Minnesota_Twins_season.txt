The 1982 Minnesota Twins finished 60-102, seventh in the AL West. It was 
the first time the Twins lost more than 100 games since moving to Minnesota. 
The Twins moved into the Metrodome but only 921,186 fans attended Twins 
games, the lowest total in the American League. The Hubert H. Humphrey 
Metrodome debuted with an April 3 exhibition game against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. Philadelphia's Pete Rose had the first unofficial Metrodome hit, 
and Minnesota's Kent Hrbek homered twice. In the regular-season home opener, 
outfielder Dave Engle had the Twins' first hit and home run in the Metrodome. 
Third baseman Gary Gaetti homered twice and was thrown out at home trying 
to stretch for an inside-the-park home run. The Seattle Mariners beat the 
Twins 11-7.[3] On May 29, for the only time in Twins history, a catcher 
nabbed four base stealers in a single game: Sal Butera threw out Ken Griffey, 
Graig Nettles, Bobby Murcer and Willie Randolph of the New York Yankees.[4] 
Otherwise, May was not a good month as the Twins went 3-26, the worst major 
league month in baseball since the Philadelphia Athletics posted a 2–28 
June of 1916. The Twins-record slide of fourteen consecutive losses ended 
with a June 4 shutout win over Baltimore. Only one Twins player made the 
All-Star Game in Montreal, first baseman Kent Hrbek. On July 19, outfielder 
Tom Brunansky hit what will be the Twins only inside-the-park grand slam 
home run, ever. Jerry Augustine of the Milwaukee Brewers threw the pitch. 
Pitcher Terry Felton – who'd gone 0-3 in 1980 – finished this season 0-13, 
and would not pitch in the majors again. His 0-16 career record is a major 
league record for futility. Kent Hrbek hit .301 with 23 HR and 92 RBI. 
Gary Ward hit .289 with 28 HR and 91 RBI. Gary Gaetti hit 25 HR and 84 
RBI. Tom Brunansky hit 20 HR and 42 RBI. Reliever Ron Davis had 22 saves.
