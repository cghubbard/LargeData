River; its surroundings, formerly industrial, are now set aside as parks 
and natural areas including Webb Memorial State Park. There are also a 
lot of streets named after people and trees. Weymouth residents often designate 
which of four distinct 'districts' they live in. Weymouth is bordered on 
the north by Hingham Bay. Weymouth's territory includes Grape Island, Slate 
Island, and Sheep Island, all part of the Boston Harbor Islands National 
Recreation Area. Weymouth is bordered on the west by Quincy, Braintree, 
and Holbrook. It is bordered on the south by Abington and Rockland. Weymouth 
is bordered on the east by Hingham. The climate in this area is characterized 
by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to 
the Köppen Climate Classification system, Weymouth has a humid subtropical 
climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[22] Weymouth is served by several 
MBTA Bus routes as well as three MBTA Commuter Rail stations: two on the 
Greenbush Line, at Weymouth Landing and near Jackson Square, and one on 
the Old Colony Line at South Weymouth. Numbered routes that pass through 
Weymouth include Massachusetts Routes 3, 3A, 18, 53, 58 and 139. Weymouth 
was founded in 1635, from the territory known as Wessagusett which was 
described in 1622—just two years after the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth. 
Weymouth held the distinction of having the oldest continuous Town Meeting 
form of government for 365 years. In 1999, Weymouth residents voted to 
change to a city form of government. David M. Madden was elected as the 
city's first mayor and took office in 2000. On July 10, 2007, Mayor David 
M. Madden announced he would not seek re-election. In 2008, Susan Kay was 
elected as the new mayor of Weymouth. On November 3, 2015, Republican state 
senator Robert L. Hedlund was elected as the new mayor of Weymouth, succeeding 
long-incumbent mayor Susan M. Kay. Hedlund assumed office on January 4, 
2016. Weymouth High School is the one high school in Weymouth. Prior to 
2005, grades eight and nine were housed in Weymouth Junior High while grades 
ten, eleven, and twelve comprised the High School. This changed with the 
construction of a new wing on the Junior High building in South Weymouth, 
which subsequently became the new Weymouth High School housing grades nine 
through twelve. The old Weymouth High School in East Weymouth was converted 
into the Maria Weston Chapman Middle School. More than 2,000 students attend 
the high school. A brand new athletic surface was completed in 2005, giving 
Weymouth High School an artificial turf field and a track surface. In 2008 
Boston Magazine ranked Weymouth High School number eight among Boston area 
high schools in academic performance and eighteenth in cost efficiency.[25] 
There is one Weymouth Middle School in East Weymouth.There are two campuses 
and are down the street from each other. The campuses are called Chapman 
Campus and Adams Campus. Abigail Adams Middle School has now been set for 
5th and 6th grades and Maria Weston Chapman Middle School 7th and 8th grades 
in 2010. There are eight primary schools and one early childhood center, 
five of which are named after Weymouth's Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. 
There is one Public Charter School which Weymouth is associated to In addition, 
there are five private schools in Weymouth. The site of Weymouth first 
saw European inhabitants in 1622 as Wessagusset Colony, a colony founded 
by Thomas Weston, who had been the main backer of the Plymouth settlement.[26] 
The settlement was a failure. The sixty men taken from London were ill-prepared 
for the hardships required for survival. They also may have lacked the 
motivation of the Pilgrims as this colony was purely economic in motivation 
and the men had not brought their families.[27] By winter, poor planning 
and bad management led to supplies running out. With the Plymouth colonists 
having few supplies to share, the Weymouth men began to steal from the 
local Massachusetts nation. Foraging in cooperation with the Pilgrims and 
trading with Natives was insufficient, and some colonists began to steal 
from the natives.[27] By now, many in the colony were ill and all forms 
of law and order had broken down. The lowest point came when a healthy 
settler was caught stealing supplies from the Massachusetts and the Massachusetts 
leaders demanded the thief's execution; the Weymouth men complied but either 
executed or failed to substitute for execution a dying, sick settler instead.[26] 
By April 1623, word of conflict between Native Americans and the Virginia 
colonists had reached the north and this increased the tension between 
the two groups. Massachusetts and other native groups began plotting to 
attack and destroy what was left of the floundering Wessagusset colony 
and possibly the more successful Plymouth Colony. Massasoit heard about 
it and sent word to Plymouth. Bradford, fearing that Plymouth would also 
be destroyed, sent Myles Standish to Weymouth with the Plymouth militia 
to end the threat. Under a banner of truce Standish lured five of the more 
bellicose Massachusetts Natives inside the stockade. There, after a brief 
struggle, the native leaders were killed. Ten of the original sixty had 
starved to death and two others had been killed in conflict with the Natives. 
Forty-five colonists joined Plymouth or went north to Maine, and from there 
most returned to England. The three who remained were subsequently killed 
by Native Americans.[26][27] Robert Gorges attempted to form a colony at 
the site later that year as the center of a more royalist and Anglican 
system of government for New England.[27] He brought William Morrell as 
religious leader and expected Governor Bradford to acknowledge his supremacy 
and act as his agent[27] Within weeks the New England winter caused Gorges 
to leave with most of the settlers.[26] Those who remained formed the nucleus 
of the permanent settlement, the second oldest in New England,[28] and 
the oldest in what would become Massachusetts Bay Colony.[29] In 1630 it 
was officially incorporated into the Massachusetts Bay Colony and in 1635 
with the addition of 100 families under the leadership of Joseph Hull the 
name was changed to Weymouth. While the integration of these groups did 
not commence without difficulty, especially due to conflicting pressures 
from the Puritans of Boston and the Pilgrims of Plymouth, Weymouth was 
a stable and prominent town with its current boundaries by 1635.[27] Weymouth 
was included as part of Suffolk County when it was formed on 10 May 1643. 
Weymouth was heavily involved in the shoemaking industry from the first 
years of the 18th century right through to 1973, when the Stetson Shoe 
Company closed its doors. The building is currently being used for medical 
offices.[30] The original town hall, which was destroyed by fire in 1914, 
was replaced in 1928 with a town hall that is a replica of the old Massachusetts 
State House in Boston. (Another replica of the building can be found at
