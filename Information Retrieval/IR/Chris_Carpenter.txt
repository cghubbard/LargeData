Christopher John "Chris" Carpenter (born April 27, 1975) is an American 
retired professional baseball starting pitcher. He played 15 seasons in 
Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and St. Louis Cardinals 
from 1997 to 2012.[1][2] A Cy Young Award winner and two-time World Series 
champion, he was also a three-time All-Star selection. In addition, he 
was twice named the Sporting News National League Pitcher of the Year, 
and voted for a number of Comeback Player of the Year awards for surmounting 
injury. The Blue Jays selected Carpenter in the first round of the 1993 
amateur draft from Trinity High School in New Hampshire, and he made his 
MLB debut in 1997. However, injuries and ineffectiveness delayed his career 
before the Blue Jays released him in 2002. After the Cardinals signed him, 
he emerged as an ace in 2004, winning the Cy Young Award in 2005 and helping 
lead the Cardinals to World Series titles in 2006 and 2011. For much of 
his career, Carpenter relied on a cutter that produced a heavy bore and 
finished with a sharp drop, a 12-to-6 curveball and a sinker. Multiple 
injuries that were deemed career-threatening – including three surgeries 
on his elbow, two on his shoulder and another on his rib cage – caused 
Carpenter to miss nearly five full seasons. However, he rehabilitated and 
returned to pitch after each of these injuries. In nine seasons playing 
for the Cardinals, he won 95 regular-season games and compiled a 3.07 ERA 
in 197 starts and 1348 2⁄3 innings pitched. His .683 winning percentage 
during that period led the Major Leagues. In 18 postseason starts, he won 
10 games with a 3.00 ERA over 108 innings. Chris Carpenter was born in 
Exeter, New Hampshire but grew up in Raymond NH, and later moved to Bedford. 
[3] He played in Little League Baseball, Babe Ruth League and in the American 
Legion Baseball. While attending Trinity High School in Manchester, New 
Hampshire, he was selected all-state for three years in both baseball and 
hockey. As a junior in 1992, his baseball team won the state championship. 
He was selected for The Boston Globe All-Scholastic team as a senior.[4] 
In 1993, his senior campaign, he earned Athlete of the Year honors.[5] 
The Toronto Blue Jays selected Carpenter in the first round and 15th overall 
pick of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.[5] He signed for $580,000. 
Standing 6 feet, 6 inches tall (78 inches (2.0 m)), scouts saw potential 
in his size, projectability, low-90s fastball, and power curveball. However, 
he needed to develop his control and changeup – he consistently struggled 
with his control early in his career. He began his professional career 
in 1994 in Minor League Baseball with the Medicine Hat Blue Jays of the 
short-season Pioneer League. In his debut against the Great Falls Dodgers, 
he tossed six scoreless innings of one-hit ball, fanning nine along the 
way.[6] When he defeated the Lethbridge Mounties, he claimed the July 2 
Pitcher of the Week award.[7] His early success continued throughout the 
season as he finished with a 2.56 earned run average (ERA) with 80 strikeouts 
(SO), 39 bases on balls (BB) and 76 hits allowed in 84 2⁄3 innings pitched 
(IP). He ended the season with a win–loss record (W–L) of 6–3 and turned 
in the league's third-lowest ERA.[6][8] He was also picked as the Pioneer 
League's number-three prospect by league managers, behind Aaron Boone and 
Ray Brown. The Blue Jays promoted Carpenter to the Class-A Advanced Dunedin 
Blue Jays of Florida State League in 1995. Baseball America rated him the 
#100 prospect in all the minor leagues before the season. He made 15 starts 
and yielded a 2.17 ERA in 99 1⁄3 IP.[6] In thirteen of those starts, he 
yielded three or fewer earned runs (ER).[9] However, he posted a poor strikeout-to-walk 
ratio (K/BB) of 1.12, with 56 SO and 50 BB. After a promotion to the AA 
Knoxville Blue Jays of the Southern League, he struggled with a 5.18 ERA, 
53 SO and 31 for 1.17 K/BB.[6][8] Returning to Knoxville the next season, 
Carpenter's Baseball America rating moved up to #82 among all minor leaguers,[6] 
and was third in the organization. Pitching against the Carolina Mudcats 
on May 17, he struck out six batters in the sixth and seventh innings, 
and 10 total in a 5–0 win. For the month of May, he was Knoxville's Pitcher 
of the Month after allowing a 1.91 ERA and a 3–0 W–L.[10] He spent the 
entire season there, starting 28 games, pitching 171 1⁄3 innings, allowing 
161 hits, 75 earned runs, and 91 BB while striking out 150 and compiling 
a 1.61 K/BB.[8] He struck out eight or more batters in nine different games 
and led the club in starts, IP and SO. The strikeout total tied him for 
third in club history behind Alex Sanchez' 166 recorded in 1988 and were 
third in the organization. Playing for Phoenix Desert Dogs in the off-season 
Arizona Fall League (AFL), he posted a 2–0 W–L in ten starts, 2.33 ERA 
(second in the AFL) and 43 SO (third). He was named that club's most valuable 
player (MVP).[10] His command continued to be problematic, although his 
curve and changeup improved.[6] In 1997, Baseball America promoted Carpenter's 
prospect ranking to 28th in the minor leagues. He started the season with 
the AAA Syracuse SkyChiefs of the International League,[8] where he made 
his first seven starts of the season for a 3.88 ERA and 1–3 record. The 
Blue Jays purchased his contract on May 10, conferring his first major-league 
call-up.[11] Carpenter made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut as a 
starter against the Minnesota Twins on May 12, 1997, completing three innings 
with eight hits, seven runs and three BB, while striking out five, in a 
12–2 loss. His first strikeout victim was Paul Molitor. At 22 years and 
18 days old, he became the sixth-youngest starting pitcher for the Blue 
Jays. After two more appearances with a 12.71 ERA and 0–2 W–L, he returned 
to Syracuse. Carpenter's second round at Syracuse consisted of 12 more 
starts, including a seven inning complete game–shutout against the Richmond 
Braves on May 28.[11] Totaling 19 games started at Syracuse in 1997, he 
pitched 120 innings, allowed 113 hits, and a 4.20 ERA. He posted 97 SO 
with 53 BB for a 1.83 K/BB, his best figure since playing at Medicine Hat.[6] 
However, his home run (HR) rate jumped after surrendering 16 HR – a rate 
of 1.2 home runs per nine innings (HR/9). His previous high (0.7) was at 
Knoxville in 1996.[8] The Blue Jays recalled Carpenter from Syracuse on 
July 29, where he remained in the starting rotation for the balance of 
the season.[11] Losing his first five MLB decisions, Carpenter defeated 
the Chicago White Sox 6–5 on August 19 for his first major league win. 
He pitched his first MLB complete game-shutout on September 9 in a 2–0 
victory over the Anaheim Angels.[6] In each of his final nine starts of 
the season, Carpenter lowered his season ERA with the Blue Jays. In that 
duration, he allowed 22 ER in 60 IP for a 3.30 ERA and was credited with 
a 3–3 W–L.[11] He finished his rookie season with a 3–7 record and a 5.09 
ERA.[12] Performance struggles plagued Carpenter early in 1998. After just 
10 innings with a combined 9.00 ERA in his first two starts, the Blue Jays 
moved him into the bullpen, where he remained until the end of May. On 
May 18, he totaled four innings and struck out six, which was a season-high 
for Toronto relievers. That stage included his total relief work for the 
season, where he made nine appearances and completed 22 2⁄3 IP, allowing 
a 2.38 ERA and carrying a 1–0 record. After Carpenter returned to the starting 
rotation, he earned a four-hit complete game shutout on July 4 against 
the Tampa Bay, his first complete game and shutout of the season. Twelve 
days later, he struck out a season-high 10 – and then-career high – against 
the White Sox.[13] Facing the Texas Rangers on August 4, he walked a career-high 
seven in an 11–9 loss. He won three games in a row from August 11–21. His 
September totals were a 3-0 W–L and 2.55 ERA in five starts and 35 1⁄3 
IP with just nine BB and 26 SO. Carpenter's finish to the season proved 
superior to the beginning; in eight of his final ten starts, he was charged 
three earned runs or fewer. His K/9 rate of 6.99 was tenth in the American 
League (AL). However, his home and road performances were uneven; at Toronto 
his ERA was 3.66 and his road ERA 5.24.[13] He also won six of his last 
seven decisions as the Blue Jays made a late push for a playoff spot. However, 
Toronto missed the playoffs, finishing four games behind the Boston Red 
Sox for the AL wild card. With a 12–7 record and 4.37 ERA, his 12 wins 
tied Pat Hentgen for the second-highest total on the club. Carpenter battled 
through an injury-plagued 1999 season. Initially, he continued the skillful 
finish from the season before, allowing three or fewer ER in his first 
nine starts, and was credited with a 3–4 W–L and 3.02 ERA. His first loss 
of the season came in a 1–0 decision in Baltimore on April 10. His second 
start of the season resulted in an 11–1 complete game two-hitter at home 
on April 15 against Tampa Bay. For the month of April, his performance 
included a 2–1 W–L and 2.55 ERA. However, the results reversed in May; 
he was 1–4 in six starts with a 4.50 ERA. Pitching elbow inflammation stationed 
him on the DL from June 3–28. After returning to play, he won the next 
five decisions of eight starts through August 11. He shut out Tampa Bay 
on July 3, the third of his career, and allowed just three hits. His season 
output at the All-Star break was a 3.24 ERA with a 6–5 W–L. He remained 
effective in June and throughout July, allowing 20 ER in 49 1⁄3 IP for 
a 3.62 ERA.[14] However, Carpenter's performance waned following the All-Star 
break; in ten starts, his record was 3–3 with a 6.31 ERA. Carpenter's August 
ERA was 6.46 and his season ended early on September 16 when Dr. James 
Andrews performed surgery to remove a bone spur. He finished with a 9–8 
W–L, 4.38 ERA in 150 IP and 24 starts. He allowed 177 hits, a rate of 10.6 
hits per nine innings pitched (H/9), 1.500 walks plus hits per inning pitched 
(WHIP) and one HR/9. In 16 of 24 starts, he allowed three earned runs or 
fewer. Just three of nine baserunners successfully stole a base. His home 
and road performances also evened from the season before – his ERA at home 
was 4.21 and 4.54 on the road.[14] Although Carpenter found significantly 
improved health the following season, he scrimmaged through the statistically 
worst season of his career. He lost his first three starts, in which he 
completed just 16 IP, allowing 18 hits, six HR and ten BB for a 7.31 ERA. 
His first win of the season was an 8–3 complete game margin against the 
New York Yankees on April 21. Carpenter won his next start and finished 
April with a 5.25 ERA and 2–3 W–L. Opposing Red Sox ace Pedro Martínez 
– the eventual Cy Young Award winner that year – in Boston on May 23, Carpenter 
emerged victorious in a 3–2 decision. The only point in the season in which 
he had a winning record, however, was on June 14 when the Blue Jays defeated 
the Detroit Tigers 8–1, putting his personal record at 6–5. He went 3–7 
the rest of the way. Ironically, he allowed a career-high nine earned runs 
against Detroit in his next start. He would again allow nine ER against 
Baltimore two starts later. The Blue Jays moved him to the bullpen and 
he made his first relief appearance in more than two years on July 22. 
He returned to the rotation for two starts, but lasted just 3 1⁄3 IP both 
times.[15] At the beginning of August, after posting a 7–10 record with 
a 6.99 ERA, he was again shifted from the starting rotation to the bullpen.[16] 
He made six more relief appearances, winning two, but allowed a 6.63 ERA. 
His eighth win came in 4 1⁄3 IP of scoreless relief against the Kansas 
City Royals. Carpenter pitched another 5 1⁄3 IP in relief for his ninth 
win on August 13 in opposition to the Minnesota Twins, striking out seven, 
which matched an AL season-high in relief. From August 29 to September 
28, he returned to the rotation. In a September 16 contest against the 
Chicago White Sox, a ball hit off the bat of José Valentín struck him in 
the face, forcing him from the game. He returned to the mount twelve days 
later.[15] However, in his final start that season, he was the losing pitcher 
in a 23–1 defeat to the Orioles, yielding four earned runs in three innings.[17] 
With improved health, Carpenter pitched a new career-high 175 1⁄3 innings, 
but surrendered an AL-high 122 ER for a 6.26 ERA, by far the highest of 
his career. He allowed 204 hits a 1.637 WHIP, and 30 HR, or 1.5 HR/9. His 
starting ERA was 6.55. His home ERA ballooned to 7.53 from 4.21 of the 
season before while his road ERA was 5.25.[15] Beginning his 2001 season 
with 13 scoreless innings – a career high – he won his first start 11–0 
against Tampa with 11 strikeouts (also a new career high). His April totals 
included a 3.15 ERA and 2–1 W–L. He tossed a six-hitter in a 4–0 victory 
over the White Sox on May 29 for his first complete game and shutout of 
the season. He gained three wins in May, his first three-win month since 
September, 1998.[18] At the end of June, Carpenter had a 7–4 record with 
a 3.67 ERA. However, he lost his next seven decisions in ten starts from 
July 1 to August 19 to fall to 7–11 and a 4.59 ERA.[19] During that stretch 
he allowed 12 home runs and 40 ER in 56 2⁄3 IP for an ERA of 6.35. Lee 
Stevens became his 500th career strikeout casualty in a July 6 game against 
Montreal. The losing streak ended on August 24 with seven shutout innings 
against Baltimore. On September 4, his third CG of the season was a 14–0 
defeat of the Yankees in a contest in which he set a career-high with 12 
SO. He won his last four decisions in eight starts, allowing just 14 ER 
in 51 IP for a 2.52 ERA.[18] He finished with a record of 11–11 and an 
ERA of 4.09. His 11 victories tied him with Esteban Loaiza and Paul Quantrill 
for the team high, and he was considered one of the Blue Jays' starters 
of the future along with Roy Halladay.[19] Prior to the All-Star break, 
he was 7–5 with a 3.99 ERA. After, he was 4–6 with a 4.21 ERA.[18] He allowed 
29 HR on the season, which was the fourth-highest total in the AL. His 
two shutouts placed fourth and three CG ninth. The Blue Jays named Carpenter 
their opening day starter for the first time in his career on April 1, 
2002, at Fenway Park against the Red Sox. He was rocked in this start, 
recording 2 1⁄3 innings and allowing six runs. He received a no-decision 
as Toronto prevailed, 12–11. The Blue Jays placed him on the DL due to 
a shoulder injury after that start. Making his second start on April 21, 
Carpenter lasted only three innings, allowing three runs against the New 
York Yankees. He took the loss as New York won, 9–2. However, he was back 
on the DL after that start due to shoulder tendonitis. After recovering, 
Carpenter made six rehab starts between Tennessee and Syracuse. He allowed 
seven HR in his first four starts covering 16.0 IP. Carpenter's first win 
of the season came against the Arizona Diamondbacks, after completing five 
innings and allowing two runs.[20] Carpenter landed on the DL in August 
for the third time in 2002, where he remained for the rest of the season. 
Shoulder surgery followed in September to repair a torn glenoid labrum. 
Surgeons inserted three tacks to anchor the labrum.[21] He allowed four 
home runs in last 58 IP.[20] Carpenter finished the year 4–5 with a 5.28 
ERA. After the season – and plagues of injuries and control issues that 
did not fully resolve over his career in the Toronto organization – the 
Blue Jays removed him from the 40-man roster and offered him a minor league, 
incentive-based deal. Carpenter refused, allowing him to become a free 
agent.[22] The St. Louis Cardinals signed Carpenter on December 13, 2002, 
while he was still recovering from elbow surgery in anticipation that he 
would be ready about the middle of the 2003 season.[23] He made eight minor 
league starts as rehabilitation assignments[24] before it was discovered 
that he had torn his labrum again after the pins anchoring it had destabilized. 
Scar tissue developed, necessitating further surgery and a DL stay for 
the remainder of the season.[21] On November 3, 2003, the Cardinals declined 
Carpenter's option for 2004[23] worth $2 million, instead buying him out 
for $200,000 and making him a free agent again. The two sides negotiated 
on a new contract and resigned for $300,000 on December 3, 2003.[25] Fully 
recovered for the 2004 season, Carpenter became a regular in the Cardinals' 
starting rotation. The first 11 starts of his Cardinals career included 
a 3.42 ERA and a 7–1 record. On April 9, he earned his first Cardinals 
win and 50th of his career against the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 13–7 score. 
He matched up against the Houston Astros and former Blue Jays rotation 
mate Roger Clemens on May 28, pitching eight scoreless innings while allowing 
just two hits. He did not factor in the decision as the Cardinals won 2–1 
in 10 innings. In May, Carpenter started five games and was credited with 
4–0 W–L as he allowed a 2.62 ERA; eventually his win streak reached six 
games. On July 5 against the Cincinnati Reds, he struck out eight including 
Adam Dunn for the 700th of his career in a 4–1 victory. He established 
a new career-high 13th win in the second game of an August 20 doubleheader 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In an August 26 rematch against Cincinnati, 
he struck out 11 in an eight-inning complete game, his only one of the 
season. Carpenter walked just 22 while striking out 113 in his last 19 
starts.[26] A nerve problem in his right biceps ended his season early 
in September.[27] For the season, Carpenter established then-career bests 
with 15 victories, a 3.46 ERA, 7.5 K/9 and allowed less than one hit per 
inning for the first time as a Major Leaguer. He tallied 182 IP, his highest 
total since 2001. His ERA placed thirteenth in the NL, 1.137 WHIP fourth, 
1.879 bases on balls per 9 innings pitched (BB/9) sixth, K/BB ratio of 
4.000 placed fifth,[12] and overall record of 15–5 with a .750 winning 
percentage ranked second.[26] The Cardinals staff finished second in the 
league in ERA (3.75) as they won a National League-high 105 games, their 
most since 1944, and first NL pennant since 1987.[28][29] The nerve problem 
caused Carpenter to miss the postseason, including what would have been 
his first World Series appearance,[27] which the Boston Red Sox won. Carpenter 
won the National League Comeback Player of the Year Awards from the Sporting 
News and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) Players 
Choice Award series.[30][31] The Cardinals called on Carpenter for his 
first Opening Day start for the club in 2005, and second of his career. 
He faced off against the Astros for his first for the Cardinals and second 
overall, allowing four hits in seven innings in a 7–3 win.[32] On April 
15, he signed a two-year extension through 2007 with a vesting option for 
2008.[33] He earned his first shutout in three years against the Chicago 
Cubs on April 21, and, on April 27, tied a career-high by striking out 
12 Milwaukee Brewers in 7 2⁄3 IP.[34][35][36] On June 14, Carpenter hurled 
a one-hit shutout against the team that drafted him, the Blue Jays while 
striking out 10 in a 7–0 win. It was the 19th complete game one-hitter 
in Cardinals history.[37][38] That contest launched the first of his 17 
consecutive starts the Cardinals won, a streak that spanned until September 
23.[39] Other streaks coincided with that game. One was a 13-game personal 
winning streak with a 1.36 ERA over 16 starts, during which he yielded 
just 20 ER in 132 1⁄3 IP. Second, he was the first pitcher in the live-ball 
era (since 1920) to go undefeated in 16 consecutive starts, complete seven 
innings or more, and allow three or fewer runs in each game. Third, dating 
back to May 7, he also produced 22 consecutive quality starts. Fourth, 
he won his first twelve road starts of the season. Fifth, he was the first 
NL pitcher to win ten consecutive road outings since Bob Gibson in 1970.[36] 
Two starts after playing against Toronto, Carpenter picked up his third 
complete-game shutout against Pittsburgh, striking out 11 in an 8–0 win.[40] 
He allowed four earned runs in 40 innings for a major-league leading 0.90 
ERA in June. From June 25 to July 6, he threw 21 2⁄3 consecutive scoreless 
innings, a career high.[36] With 13 wins before the All-Star break, Carpenter 
became just the third Cardinal pitcher ever to achieve the feat, following 
Joaquín Andújar in 1984 and 1985, and Kent Bottenfield in 1999.[36] He 
was picked to start an All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit, the first 
Cardinal pitcher in 32 years since Rick Wise to do so.[41][42] He pitched 
one scoreless inning.[36] On another occasion facing Clemens on July 17, 
Carpenter struck out nine Astros while giving up just three hits and no 
walks as St. Louis won, 3–0. It was his sixth consecutive start allowing 
one or no runs.[43] He yielded five earned runs over 40 2⁄3 innings in 
July for a 1.11 July ERA (second in MLB), 33 strikeouts, seven walks and 
24 hits, and one home run. Carpenter became the first Cardinals pitcher 
since Andújar in 1985 to record 15 wins before August 1. Carpenter's August 
resulted in a 4–0 record, 2.17 ERA six BB and 38 SO in six starts. On September 
3, he won a complete game in Houston to become the majors' first 20-game 
winner. It was his 28th start, making him the fastest Cardinal to win 20 
since Dizzy Dean in his 23rd start in 1934.[36] With a 2–0 record, 1.69 
ERA, 13 SO and 16 2⁄3 IP, Carpenter won his first NL Player of the Week 
Award for the week ending September 4.[44] On September 23, the Cardinals' 
streak of winning 17 consecutive starts by Carpenter ended with a 9–6 loss 
to Milwaukee.[45] For the second consecutive season, the Cardinals repeated 
as Central division champions, and won at least 100 games with the best 
record in the National League. Carpenter set career bests with a 2.83 ERA, 
213 SO, 241 2⁄3 IP, seven CG, four shutouts and a 21–5 record.[46] as the 
club won 26 of his 33 regular season starts.[36] While not a leader in 
any one major statistical category in 2005 – aside from leading MLB in 
CG – he was the only pitcher to finish in the top five in all MLB in the 
pitching Triple Crown categories (ERA, wins and SO).[46] In road games, 
he went 12–1 in 15 starts with a 2.90 ERA, ranking fifth in the NL. The 
.923 winning percentage on the road is highest in franchise history for 
all pitchers with at least 10 wins on the road. He was the first Cardinals 
pitcher to strike out 200 in a season since José DeLeón in 1989.[36] Finally 
healthy for an entire season, Carpenter pitched in the postseason for the 
first time in his career, debuting on October 4 against the Padres in Game 
1 of the National League Division Series (NLDS). In six shutout innings, 
he earned the win in an 8–5 margin, but left due to hand cramping.[47] 
The Cardinals defeated the Padres in the NLDS but fell to the Astros in 
the National League Championship Series (NLCS). His combined postseason 
totals were a 2–0 record with a 2.14 ERA in 21 IP.[36] After winning several 
awards for his regular season performance, Carpenter was the National League 
Cy Young Award winner. He amassed 19 first-place votes for 132 points while 
runner-up Dontrelle Willis of the Florida Marlins garnered 112 total points. 
Carpenter became just the second pitcher in team history to win a Cy Young 
since Gibson, who had last won in 1970.[39] He won the Major League Baseball 
Players Association (MLBPA) Players Choice Award for the National League 
Outstanding Pitcher,[46] and the Sporting News' Award for the National 
League Pitcher of the Year.[42] He also won the This Year in Baseball Starting 
Pitcher of the Year Award.[48] To recognize his selection as the NL Outstanding 
Pitcher, MLBPA Trust contributed $20,000 to Kristen's Gift in Lebanon, 
New Hampshire. The St. Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America (BBWAA) selected him, along with Albert Pujols, as co-St. Louis 
Baseball Man of the Year Award winners.[4] He finished eighth in the NL 
MVP voting, the highest placement of all pitchers.[49] For the second consecutive 
season in 2006, Carpenter was the Cardinals' Opening Day starter. At Philadelphia 
on April 3, he earned the victory after posting five IP in a 13–5 margin.[50] 
With nine strikeouts in six innings against the Cubs on April 8, he departed 
with a 2–0 lead, but earned a no-decision as the Cubs won, 3–2.[51] In 
an April 14 contest against Cincinnati, he allowed just one run in eight 
innings, but Aaron Harang – who had the game-winning hit off Carpenter 
– and the bullpen muzzled the Cardinals on just five hits for a 1–0 Reds 
triumph.[52] Carpenter stifled the Pittsburgh Pirates for eight scoreless 
innings on April 19 at PNC Park and allowed just a pair of hits. After 
thumping the leadoff hitter, he retired 15 consecutive batters before surrendering 
a single in the sixth inning. In that inning, he fanned Nate McLouth for 
his 1,000th career strikeout.[53][54] Making his 200th career start against 
the Pirates on April 24, Carpenter earned the decision in a 7–2 win.[53] 
On June 13 against the Pirates, he struck out a personal and club season-high 
13 batters, allowing just three hits in a 2–1 win.[55] He was voted to 
his second All-Star Game in July.[56] He picked up his first victory against 
the last remaining club of whom he had not yet defeated – besides the Cardinals, 
whom he never faced in his career – the Atlanta Braves on July 4.[53] He 
worked five innings in a rain-interrupted outing against the Braves on 
July 4 at Turner Field for that first career victory.[57] In a complete 
game shutout of the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 14, he allowed just two 
hits and struck out seven in a 5–0 win. It was his tenth career shutout 
and fifth as a Cardinal. Following that contest, Carpenter was named the 
NL Player of the Week for the All Star-shortened week of July 13–16. His 
nine innings pitched paced the league and he was also tied for the league 
lead in ERA at 0.00.[58] Debuting in Coors Field on July 25 against the 
Rockies, Carpenter combined with Randy Flores and Jason Isringhausen for 
the Cardinals' first-ever shutout win (1–0) in Denver.[53] Winless in his 
previous three starts after allowing 15 runs in 17 innings, he pitched 
a four-hitter against the Reds on August 15 for his 11th career shutout. 
Only one runner reached second base while Carpenter struck out six and 
walked none.[59] The next start, he was the winning pitcher in a 5–3 victory 
over the Cubs, allowing two runs on seven innings. Along with teammate 
Chris Duncan, Carpenter was named NL co-Player of the Week for the week 
ending August 20.[60] In two starts against the Reds and Cubs, he tallied 
17 innings, was charged with a 1.06 ERA and struck out 13 without issuing 
a walk.[61] On September 11, Carpenter shut out the Astros in a 7–0 final 
score for his fourth complete game and third shutout of the season. It 
was also his 50th win as a Cardinal.[62] He became the third member of 
the St. Louis Cardinals pitching staff to gain his 100th career win in 
2006, joining Jeff Suppan and Mark Mulder in a September 16 matchup against 
the San Francisco Giants. Facing former teammate Matt Morris for the first 
time, the Cardinals were victorious, 6–1. Carpenter used a newly evolved 
curveball over seven completed innings, allowing the lone run in the eighth 
inning. That run stopped a personal streak of 22 scoreless innings at home.[63] 
Winning his third National League Player of the Week Award for the week 
ending September 16, he allowed just a 0.56 ERA with 15 SO and a 2–0 W–L. 
Included in those totals were the games against Houston and San Francisco.[64] 
For the season, he posted a 3.09 ERA with 15 wins in 221 2⁄3 IP. His three 
shutouts led the Major Leagues and 1.069 walks plus hits per inning pitched 
(WHIP) led the National League. With the Cardinals facing the Padres in 
the NLDS for the second consecutive season, Carpenter won both his starts 
and yielded a 2.03 ERA while striking out 12 in 13 1⁄3 IP. He was less 
effective against the New York Mets in the NLCS, allowing a 5.73 ERA while 
losing one of two starts. Carpenter made his first World Series start in 
Game 3 against the Detroit Tigers on October 24 at Busch Stadium in St. 
Louis. He pitched eight shutout innings, allowing no runs on three hits 
and striking out six. Per the Elias Sports Bureau, that performance made 
him the first pitcher in Cardinals history to pitch eight innings and allow 
no walks and no more than three hits in a World Series contest. Just two 
other pitchers in the prior 20 seasons had accomplished the feat: Greg 
Maddux (1995) and Clemens (2000).[27] The Cardinals prevailed in five games 
over the Tigers, giving him his first World Series ring.[65] Carpenter 
finished third in the NL Cy Young balloting behind Brandon Webb and Trevor 
Hoffman,[56] and 19th in the NL MVP voting, second to Hoffman among pitchers.[66] 
His teammates voted him as that season's Darryl Kile Good Guy Award winner 
for the Cardinals.[4] On December 4, 2006, the Cardinals announced they 
re-signed Carpenter to a five-year, US$65 million deal, keeping him with 
the team through 2011, with a $12 million option for 2012.[67] From 2007–08, 
elbow problems persisted, causing Carpenter to miss nearly all of both 
seasons, and the Cardinals missed the playoffs in that period. He returned 
in 2009, helping leading the Cardinals to a Central division title. He 
made his third consecutive Opening Day start on April 1, 2007, facing off 
against Tom Glavine of the Mets. The Mets won, 6–1, giving Carpenter his 
first career Opening Day loss.[68] He missed his next start due to apparent 
elbow inflammation. The Cardinals placed him on the DL on April 9 for impingement 
syndrome and moderate arthritis.[69] On May 5, the team announced that 
he would require surgery to trim bone spurs in the elbow.[70] After a rehabilitation 
start following the surgery, swelling and stiffness developed, and, on 
July 19, the Cardinals announced that Carpenter required Tommy John surgery 
to replace the medial collateral ligament of the right elbow and would 
miss approximately another 10 to 12 months.[71] He made his next major 
league appearance one year later on July 30, 2008, against the Braves. 
He lasted four innings, gave up one run on five hits, walked two and struck 
out two. Despite receiving a no-decision, the Cardinals went on to win 
the game, 7–2.[72] At one point in 2008, he began experiencing numbness 
in his pitching forearm, which lingered for rest of his career, and transformed 
into weakness, intermittently shifting from his arm to his hands, neck, 
and facial muscles.[73] After making just four starts from 2007–08, Carpenter 
returned for a one-hit performance on April 9 against Pittsburgh in his 
2009 season debut. He shut them out for seven innings at Busch Stadium 
struck out seven.[74] In his second start of the season on April 14, he 
strained the left side of his rib cage,[75] prompting the club placed him 
on the 15-day DL. A magnetic resonance image (MRI)[76] revealed an oblique 
tear.[77] On May 20, Carpenter returned after missing a month to make his 
100th start for the Cardinals. He pitched five shutout innings against 
the Chicago Cubs, giving up just three hits, walking two, and striking 
out five in a 2–1 win.[78][79] With that win, his winning percentage with 
the club increased to .726 (53–20), the highest ever by a Cardinal through 
his first 100 starts, surpassing John Tudor's 49–21 record (.700).[80][81] 
He completed 19 total innings for the month of May and allowed just two 
ER for a 0.95 ERA; he also allowed just a 0.737 WHIP.[82] On June 4, he 
threw his 26th career complete game, and lowered his ERA for the season 
to 0.71, the lowest for any Cardinals' pitcher in the first six starts 
of a season, exceeding Harry Brecheen's mark of 0.75 in 1948.[83] In July, 
he was 4–0 in five starts and 36 IP with a 1.75 ERA and 1.222 WHIP.[82] 
He hurled seven shutout innings while striking out ten Reds on August 12.[84] 
A 7–0 victory over San Diego at Petco Park on August 22 gave him his ninth 
win in ten starts with a 1.92 ERA in that span.[85] It was also the unofficial 
10,000th win in the Cardinals' all-time franchise history, dating back 
to the American Association era. The official total at the time, counted 
since their entry into the NL in 1892, was 9,219.[86] Carpenter won the 
National League Pitcher of the Month Award for August with a 5–0 record 
and 2.20 ERA in six starts.[84] He threw a one-hitter on September 7 against 
the Brewers at Miller Park, striking out 10, and earning his first shutout 
since September 11, 2006.[87] On October 1, he hit his first career home 
run, a grand slam, in a 13–0 rout of the Reds at Great American Ball Park, 
and doubled home two more runs, he became only the fourth pitcher since 
the advent of divisional play in 1969 with at least six runs batted in 
(RBI) in a game. That total broke the Cardinals' club record for pitchers 
which Gibson established with five on July 26, 1973.[88][89] For the year, 
Carpenter led the NL with a career-best 2.24 ERA in 192 2⁄3 IP and a major 
league-leading .810 winning percentage with 17 wins and just four losses. 
Further, he struck out 144 while walking just 38 batters, and allowed just 
seven home runs.[90] His 0.3 HR/9 rate also led the major leagues and his 
K/BB rate of 3.79 placed eighth in the NL.[12] After the season, Carpenter 
won the NL Comeback Player of the Year by winning 27 of 30 first-place 
votes.[90] He was the runner-up for the National League Cy Young Award. 
In one of the closest votes of the history of the award, winner Tim Lincecum 
garnered 100 total points while Carpenter had 94 despite being written 
in just nine of 30 first-place votes.[91][92] He also finished 14th in 
the NL MVP voting, which was tops among all NL pitchers.[93] For his performance 
in the 2009 season after missing nearly all of the previous season while 
recuperating from nerve ailments in his pitching arm and Tommy John surgery, 
he unanimously won the Tony Conigliaro Award.[94] Early in the 2010 season, 
Carpenter began to experience increased symptoms related to the prior weakness 
and numbness in his pitching arm that was concentrated mainly in his shoulder. 
He gained relief through multiple remedies that included deep massage and 
muscle release that chiropractor Dr. Clayton Skaggs performed. The relief 
allowed him to play the entire season without a DL stay. However, over 
time, his condition became more resistant to treatment.[73] He played in 
the All-Star Game, the third appearance of his career. In an August game, 
Carpenter was involved in a bench-clearing brawl with the Cincinnati Reds. 
After a heated exchange with Reds' manager Dusty Baker following an incident 
between Cardinals' catcher Yadier Molina and the Reds' Brandon Phillips 
which cleared the benches, the two teams began shoving and grappling with 
each other. While pinned against a backstop, Reds' starting pitcher Johnny 
Cueto kicked wildly at several Cardinals, hitting Carpenter and catcher 
Jason LaRue several times. Cueto was suspended seven games for the incident. 
In the midst of the brawl, Carpenter could be seen exchanging words with 
several players, then the whole crowd of players including the Cardinals 
massed together in his direction. He was pushed up against the railing 
bordering the stands and almost fell in the middle of the chaos.[95][96] 
For the 2010 season, Carpenter finished with a 3.22 ERA, 235 IP, 179 SO 
and 16–9 W–L record. It was the only time in his Cardinals career in which 
he played the full season but missed the playoffs. He led the major leagues 
in games started (35) and was second in the NL in IP. He also finished 
in the top ten in the NL in wins, winning percentage, walks per nine innings, 
batters faced and hit batsmen. At the close of the 2011 regular season, 
the Cardinals called on Carpenter to consummate what St. Louis Post-Dispatch 
sportswriter Bernie Miklasz termed an "improbable comeback."[97] The Cardinals 
were one game from realizing their quest of surmounting a 10 1⁄2 games-won 
deficit over the Atlanta Braves that had commenced on August 28. They had 
tied the Braves for the Wild Card lead entering the final game of the season 
on September 29. Carpenter started that game against the Houston Astros, 
securing an 8–0 victory behind his two-hit shutout.[98] Meanwhile, the 
Philadelphia Philles defeated the Braves 4–3 in 13 innings, giving the 
Cardinals the wild card title and eliminating the Braves from the playoffs. 
The games-won deficit marked the largest lead surrendered with 32 left 
to play.[99] For the season, Carpenter pitched an NL-leading 237 1⁄3 innings 
while posting a 3.45 ERA and leading the major leagues in starts with 34. 
He also struck out 191 batters, allowed a 1.256 WHIP, completed four games, 
and was ninth in the NL with 3.473 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Incidentally, 
the Cardinals faced off against the Phillies in the five-game NLDS. On 
Friday, October 7, Carpenter started for the second time in the series 
for the finale in Philadelphia, matching up against former Blue Jays teammate 
and friend Roy Halladay. Carpenter defeated Halladay in a sensational 1–0, 
complete-game shutout where he allowed just three hits and received skilled 
defensive support. That game clinched the series and sent the Cardinals 
to the NLCS to face the Brewers.[100] Carpenter started once, and the Cardinals 
also won this series. Meeting the Texas Rangers in the World Series, Carpenter 
started Game 1. The Cardinals prevailed, 3–2, and he earned the decision.[101] 
By winning his eighth career postseason game as a Cardinal, he surpassed 
Gibson for the all-time franchise lead.[102] Carpenter also pitched Games 
5 and Game 7. He completed six innings of the seventh game on three days 
rest, leading the Cardinals to a 6–2 win and third career World Series 
win.[103] It was also the third clincher of the season he pitched and won. 
His overall 2011 postseason totals included a 4–0 record and 3.30 ERA.[104] 
After producing three successful seasons (2009–11) that had followed two 
injury-plagued seasons (2007–08), Carpenter would again miss nearly all 
of two consecutive seasons. This time, they were his final two major league 
seasons under contract. He did not pitch for much of 2012 because of thoracic 
outlet syndrome (TOS), diagnosed on June 28 after a visit to a Dallas-area 
specialist.[105] Initially, a three-month strengthening program to remedy 
shoulder weakness was the goal. However, the treatment failed, leaving 
surgical intervention as the only option.[73] On July 3, the team and Carpenter 
announced he would have surgery to repair the TOS. It involved removal 
of his first rib, the amelioration of two scalene muscles in the neck and 
extrication of nerves within the brachial plexus. Initial recovery time 
was estimated at six months, meaning he would miss the remainder of the 
2012 season and be ready for spring training the following February.[73] 
Dr. Greg Pearl performed the surgery on July 19 and the procedure involved 
removal of a rib.[106] Defying expectations, his speedy recovery allowed 
him to return to the mound in a September 21 game against the Cubs. According 
to Carpenter, "I worked my butt off to try and get back, and it worked 
out."[107] His post-season win on October 10 in the third game of the 2012 
NLDS against the Washington Nationals gave him a 10–2 record, 2.88 ERA 
and 100 innings in 16 postseason starts. The 10 wins placed him seventh 
on MLB's all-time postseason win list at the time, just one behind Curt 
Schilling (11–2, 2.23 ERA) and Greg Maddux (11–14, 3.27 ERA).[108] However, 
he allowed five runs – two earned – in only four innings to take the loss 
in Game 2 of the NLCS against the San Francisco Giants, and turned in an 
identical performance in the potentially clinching Game 6. The Cardinals 
lost in seven games. On February 5, 2013, an MLB.com report on the Cardinals 
official team website stated that Carpenter was considered unlikely to 
pitch for the team in the 2013 season, his final under his contract. According 
to Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak, Carpenter informed team officials 
he was again experiencing symptoms in his right shoulder that sidelined 
him for much of 2012, namely numbness, weakness, and general discomfort. 
In mid-January, he disclosed to reporters at the Cardinals Winter Warmup 
event that he'd experienced no problems with the shoulder in his off-season 
throwing routine. However, according to Mozeliak, several attempts by Carpenter 
to throw bullpen sessions had caused a resurfacing of the shoulder issue.[109] 
Carpenter stated on February 11 that he would not travel to spring training 
in Jupiter, Florida, deciding to stay in St. Louis fearing he could be 
a distraction.[110] At a press conference that same day, he said he still 
held out hope of pitching in 2013, and refused to talk about retirement.[111] 
On February 22, the team placed him on the 60-day disabled list.[112] He 
hoped to return to pitch out of the bullpen after stating on May 4 he was 
feeling good and resuming a throwing program. Mozeliak believed he could 
return in late June or early July.[113] He threw a bullpen session of around 
70 pitches on May 10, with all his pitch types, and said afterwards he 
felt good and was ready for his fifth session on May 13.[114] He made two 
minor league rehab starts but was shut down because of continued discomfort.[115] 
He did not pitch for the Cardinals in 2013. On October 13, his agent Bob 
LaMonte stated Carpenter would retire, and may pursue a career in the Cardinals 
organization.[2][116] Mozeliak confirmed his retirement during a press 
conference on November 20, 2013.[117] Approximately two months after announcing 
his retirement as a player, the Cardinals announced in January, 2014, that 
Carpenter would join the team's front office. Mozeliak stated that he would 
become familiar with the role of scouting.[118] He resigned the position 
after the 2014 season for personal reasons.[119] Like teammate Adam Wainwright, 
Carpenter's repertoire consisted mostly of sinkers (90–94 mph), cutters 
(87–90), and curveballs (74–77), with occasional four-seam fastballs and 
a changeup used against left-handed hitters. His curveball was his preferred 
pitch with two strikes.[120] "He's just the entire package", manager Tony 
La Russa said. "He's got really tough stuff. He has a lot of pitches [and] 
can show a hitter one thing, mix it two or three times and show him something 
different, and he's competitive as all get-out. He's the complete package."[121] 
He was also a good fielder, having pitched three full seasons (2001, 2006 
and 2009) without making an error.[122] Carpenter's sinker generally averaged 
about 91.5 miles per hour (147.3 km/h) in 2011, his last full season, and 
slightly lower that its average speed of 93 miles per hour (150 km/h) in 
2009. His sinker and four-seam fastball combination averaged 92.4 miles 
per hour (148.7 km/h) in 2011. Against right-handed hitters, his sinker 
was most effective with horizontal movement rather than with marked sink. 
His cutter actually had more sink on it than his sinker, along with the 
effective, familiar cutting motion. It averaged between 86.5 and 88 mph 
over the last few years over his career. The curveball had significant 
downward movement, and, at or below 75 miles per hour (121 km/h), was slow 
for a pitcher who threw as hard as Carpenter did.[123] Carpenter has credited 
former pitching coach Dave Duncan with helping prompt him to rethink his 
pitching strategy. After arriving in St. Louis in 2003, he "was able to 
sit around and listen and watch (Duncan)," Carpenter stated. "When I was 
a young kid, I didn’t think about up and down and things like that. I was 
just trying to throw the ball away, trying to throw the ball in, I wasn’t 
thinking about throwing my curveball for strikes." When he won the 2005 
Cy Young Award, he became the fourth pitcher to win with Duncan as coach, 
and the seventh overall in Duncan's playing and coaching career. "When 
I came here (St. Louis), (Duncan) talks about throwing the ball down in 
the strike zone and getting ahead and attacking the strike zone. All these 
things have helped me progress and be successful, and I owe him a lot for 
what I’ve done the last few years."[124] As a pitcher who missed considerable 
playing time due to injury, Carpenter won three major Comeback Player of 
the Year awards in two separate seasons. Steve Adams of MLB Trade Rumors 
wrote that "injuries to Carpenter shortened what could have been one of 
the most impressive careers of a generation, but few were better than Carpenter 
when he was healthy. From 2004–11, [he] posted a 3.06 ERA with 7.3 K/9 
and 2.0 BB/9 in 1331 2⁄3 innings." Said Mozeliak, "When you think back 
to everything this organization has been through in regard to his ups and 
downs, he will still go down as one of the greatest we’ve ever had. … We 
think back to his career and what an amazing one it was. He was part of 
so many highlights and I think he really created a culture of higher expectations." 
Chairman William DeWitt, Jr., remarked "Chris will always be remembered 
as the leader of the pitching staff during one of the great eras of Cardinals 
baseball."[125] Carpenter won one Cy Young Award and finished in the top 
three twice more.[126] Despite reaching 28 or more starts in just six of 
his nine seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, he won two World Series 
rings and 95 games with a 3.07 ERA over 1348 1⁄3 innings.[122] He is the 
franchise's all-time leader in strikeout-to-walk ratio (3.666) and is tied 
for eighth in league-average adjusted ERA+ (133), fourth in strikeouts 
(1,085), fifth in walks and hits per inning pitched (WHIP, 1.125), fifth 
in strikeouts per nine innings pitched (7.240), ninth in bases on balls 
per 9 innings pitched (1.975) and eighth in winning percentage (.683)[127] 
His .683 winning percentage also was second all-time for Cardinals starting 
pitchers with at least 100 starts and led the Major Leagues over the period 
of his Cardinals career.[128] On December 9, 2014, the Missouri Sports 
Hall of Fame announced Carpenter as an inductee in their 2015 class.[129] 
The Cardinals announced on April 29, 2016, that Carpenter was voted by 
fans into the franchise Hall of Fame, with the enshrinement taking place 
on August 27, 2016.[130] Bold: League leader †: led both Major Leagues 
Carpenter currently resides in Bedford, New Hampshire and Clayton, Missouri. 
Chris filed for divorce from 1st wife Alyson Ickes in December 2013. He 
re-married in October 2015 to his current wife. His agent is Bob LaMonte. 
In May, 2014, he put his Ladue, Missouri, home on the market for $3.65 
million.[132] Two months later, he listed his Palm Beach, Florida, home 
for sale for $675,000.[133] In the 2011–12 offseason, Carpenter and Halladay 
were fishing in the Amazon River with fellow pitcher B. J. Ryan and professional 
sport fisherman Skeet Reese when they encountered a wounded man who was 
stranded. The man was attempting to catch fish to sell as aquarium pets 
when an anaconda attacked him. The snake bit him, but the victim was able 
to free himself. The snake attempted to wrap itself around the man, but 
instead wrapped itself around the motor of his 14-foot canoe, flipped it 
over and broke the motor off. When the pitchers discovered him, they flipped 
the boat back over, recovered his belongings and towed him home.[134][135] 
Less than three weeks after Carpenter announced his retirement, Halladay 
signed a one-day contract with the Blue Jays on December 9, 2013, and announced 
his own retirement.[136] Carpenter's friendship with Halladay received 
increased media attention during the 2011 NLDS. Drafted two years apart, 
Halladay made his Major League debut for the Blue Jays one year after Carpenter 
in 1998. They met the year before while assigned with the Syracuse Chiefs 
and developed a competitive bond. Although they both pitched together in 
the Toronto rotation for four years, Carpenter had yet to achieve the success 
for which he is now recognized until after the Blue Jays released him following 
the 2002 season. That season, Halladay achieved a breakthrough with his 
first All-Star selection and winning 19 games with a 2.93 ERA.[137][138]
