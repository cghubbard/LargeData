-73.95194 The Museum of the City of New York (MCNY) is a history and art 
museum in New York City, New York. It was founded by Henry Collins Brown,[1][2] 
in 1923[3] to preserve and present the history of New York City, and its 
people. It is located at 1220-1227 Fifth Avenue from East 103rd to 104th 
Streets, across from Central Park in the Upper East Side neighborhood of 
Manhattan, at the northern end of the Museum Mile section of Fifth Avenue. 
The red brick with marble trim[4] museum was built in 1929-30[4] and was 
designed by Joseph H. Freedlander in the neo-Georgian style, with statues 
of Alexander Hamilton and DeWitt Clinton by sculptor Adolph Alexander Weinman 
facing Central Park from niches in the facade.[5] The museum is a private 
non-profit organization which receives government support as a member of 
New York City's Cultural Institutions Group, commonly known as "CIG"s.[6] 
Its other sources of income are endowments, admission fees, and contributions.[4][7] 
The museum was originally located in Gracie Mansion, where available space 
was limited.[3] One of its first major exhibits was "Old New York", presented 
in the Fine Arts Building on West 57th Street in 1926. The success of the 
project led to a search for a new, permanent headquarters for the museum. 
A design competition was held between five invited architects,[5] and the 
Colonial Revival design by Freedlander was selected. The city donated a 
site on Fifth Avenue, and funds for construction of the museum building 
were raised by public subscription.[3][8] The original plans for the museum's 
building were scaled back as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, 
nevertheless, the building was dedicated on January 11, 1932.[3] On January 
24, 1967 the museum building was designated a New York City landmark.[4] 
In 1982, the Museum received The Hundred Year Association of New York's 
Gold Medal Award "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City 
of New York." In 2000, the Giuliani administration told the museum that 
it could relocate to the historic Tweed Courthouse near City Hall in Lower 
Manhattan.[9] El Museo del Barrio would then have moved across the street 
to occupy the current Museum of the City of New York building. This decision 
was overturned by the incoming administration of Michael Bloomberg, which 
decided to use the Courthouse as the headquarters for the new New York 
City Department of Education, causing MCNY's then-director Robert R. McDonald 
to tender his resignation.[9] McDonald was replaced in 2002 by Susan Henshaw 
Jones, who was at the time the president of the National Building Museum 
in Washington, D.C.[9] There was also an attempt to merge the museum with 
the New-York Historical Society, which did not come to fruition, and the 
museum was passed over for space at Ground Zero.[10] The Museum's new director, 
Susan Henshaw Jones, recommitted MCNY to its East Harlem neighborhood by 
planning an extension to the Museum. The groundbreaking for this extension, 
which included renovation of existing gallery space, as well as a new pavilion, 
took place on August 2, 2006,[10] and it was completed in February 2008 
with a ribbon cutting later that same year. The pavilion gallery, designed 
by the Polshek Partnership,[5] is 3,000-square-foot (280 m2) glass addition, 
which has two levels for which to display artifacts. The original 1932 
Georgian Revival building was also restored during this project, as well 
as additions including a vault for the museum's silver collection, a research 
room and a room for the handling of artifacts. The total costs for the 
first phase of refurbishments came to $28 million.[11] In late 2011, the 
Museum temporarily took over operation of the South Street Seaport Museum 
which reopened in January 2012.[12] The museum's collection of over 1.5 
million items[9] – which is particularly strong in objects dating from 
the 19th and early 20th centuries[3] – include paintings, drawings, prints, 
including over 3000 by Currier and Ives,[3] and photographs featuring New 
York City and its residents, as well as costumes, decorative objects and 
furniture, antique toys– the museum was the first in the United States 
to establish a curatorial department for toys[3] – ship models, rare books 
and manuscripts, marine and military collections, police and fire collections, 
and a theater collection which documents the golden age of Broadway theater. 
There are also dioramas about the city's history as well as its physical 
environment.[5] Among the rare items in the museum's collection is a chair 
that once belonged to Sarah Rapelje, daughter of Joris Jansen Rapelje of 
Nieuw Amsterdam, and said to be the first child born in New York State 
of European parentage.[13] The chair was donated by her Brinckerhoff descendants. 
The museum is known for its comprehensive collection of photographic images, 
which includes works by noted photographers Percy Byron, Jacob Riis and 
Berenice Abbott, as well as many Depression-era Federal Art Project photographs. 
The collection also includes still photography by film director Stanley 
Kubrick.[14] MCNY is also home to several recreations of furnished rooms 
from the house of John D. Rockefeller, donated by the Rockefeller family.[3] 
Notable as well is a model of New Amsterdam based on the Castello Plan 
of 1660.[5] ”The Bay and Harbor of New York” by Samuel Waugh (1814–1885), 
depicting the arrival of the Junk Keying in New York harbour in July 1847 
(watercolor on canvas, c.1853–1855, Museum of the City of New York). Henry 
Gurdon Marquand House Conservatory Window (around 1883–1884), designed 
by Richard Morris Hunt (1827–1895) and made by Eugène Stanislas Oudinot 
(1827–1889) From October 2004 through July 2009, Perform was the only permanent 
exhibition in New York City focused on theater in New York. It included 
objects ranging from Bill "Bojangles" Robinson's tap shoes to advertising 
materials from Avenue Q.[15] In June 2007, the museum opened its temporary 
"The Glory Days, 1947–1957" exhibit, an in-depth photographic look at the 
history of professional baseball in New York City. The exhibit included 
clips of Ed Sullivan, a pioneer of CBS television entertainment, interviewing 
many of the players of the era, including Mickey Mantle and Phil Rizzuto. 
A section was devoted to Jackie Robinson, who broke the color line in 1947 
when he joined the former Brooklyn Dodgers and became a leading figure 
in the civil rights movement both during.and after his playing career. 
In May 2012, the Museum opened a new space devoted to the Puffin Foundation 
and its collection. The inaugural exhibit focused on social activism and
