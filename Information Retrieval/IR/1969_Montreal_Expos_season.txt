The Montreal Expos participated in their first season in Major League Baseball 
in 1969. The Expos, as typical for first-year expansion teams, finished 
in the cellar of the National League East Division with a 52â€“110 record, 
48 games behind the eventual World Series Champion New York Mets. They 
did not win any game in extra innings during the year, which also featured 
a surprise no-hitter in just the ninth regular-season game they ever played. 
Their home attendance of 1,212,608, an average of 14,970 per game, was 
good for 7th in the N.L. The Montreal Expos participated in the 1968 Major
