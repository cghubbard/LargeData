The Bradley Braves are the intercollegiate athletics teams of Bradley University, 
located in Peoria, Illinois, United States. The Braves' athletic program 
is a member of the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) [2] and competes at 
the NCAA Division I level.[3] The Bradley mascot is Kaboom! the Gargoyle, 
and the school colors are red and white. Bradley Polytechnic Institute 
opened its doors in the fall of 1897, and the school fielded a football 
team in that first fall and a baseball team in the spring of 1998.[4] Men's 
basketball debuted in 1902–03 with no coach and no home court, but was 
destined to become Bradley's most successful team; over the years, the 
Braves have played in 34 post-season tournaments, winning the National 
Invitation Tournament (NIT) four times and being runnersup in the NCAA 
and the NIT twice each and in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) 
and CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament (CIT) once each.[5] A member 
of the Missouri Valley Conference, Bradley University sponsors teams in 
seven men's and eight women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[6] Mary Swanson Bradley
