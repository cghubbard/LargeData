Willard Eben Mains (July 7, 1868 â€“ May 23, 1923) was an American professional 
baseball pitcher. He joined the National League at the age of 19 with the 
Chicago White Stockings, started two games in 1888, winning one and losing 
the other. After that season, he didn't return to the Majors until 1891, 
when he pitched in 30 games, starting 23 of them, for the Cincinnati Kelly's 
Killers of the American Association. He had a record of 12-12 with 20 complete 
games before he moved on and pitched two games for the Milwaukee Brewers, 
also of the Association. He wasn't seen again in the Major Leagues again 
until five years later when he surfaced for the 1896 Boston Beaneaters, 
with whom he pitched in eight games, winning three games, losing two. His 
son, Jim Mains pitched one game in the majors, for the 1943 Philadelphia 
Athletics.[1] Mains had a long career in minor league baseball, where he 
recorded a record of 318 wins and 179 losses in 545 games.[2] Willard died 
at the age of 54 in Bridgton, Maine, and interred at South High Street
