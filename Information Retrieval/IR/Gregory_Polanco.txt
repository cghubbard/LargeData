Gregory Polanco (born September 14, 1991), nicknamed "El Coffee", is a 
Dominican professional baseball right fielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). Polanco competed in showcases, and played 
as a pitcher due to him being left-handed. He was asked to rotate to the 
outfield due to a shortage of players, and found that he preferred the 
position.[1] Polanco signed as an international free agent with the Pirates 
on April 11, 2009.[2] In 2009, he played for the Dominican Pirates of the 
Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. In 2010, he played for the Gulf Coast 
Pirates of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL), where he had a .202 
batting average. In 2011, he played for the GCL Pirates and the State College 
Spikes, batting .237. He spent the 2012 season with the West Virginia Power 
of the Class A South Atlantic League. He enjoyed his best season to date, 
batting .325 with 16 home runs and 40 stolen bases.[1] He was named the 
South Atlantic League player of the year, and the Pirates' minor league 
player of the year.[3] Prior to the 2013 season, Polanco was ranked as 
the 65th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com,[4] and as the 51st best 
prospect in baseball by Baseball America.[5] Polanco began the 2013 season 
with the Bradenton Marauders of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. 
With Bradenton, Polanco batted .312 with 24 stolen bases and 30 runs batted 
in in 57 games, before receiving a promotion to the Altoona Curve of the 
Class AA Eastern League.[6] In June 2013, Baseball Prospectus ranked Polanco 
as the 12th best prospect in baseball.[7] Polanco, along with Dilson Herrera, 
represented the Pirates at the 2013 All-Star Futures Game.[8] The Pirates 
promoted Polanco to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA International 
League at the end of the season. He received nine at-bats with Indianapolis.[9] 
On March 14, 2014, the Pirates optioned Polanco to Indianapolis.[1] Polanco 
was called up to the major leagues on June 9, 2014 due to an appendix injury 
to second baseman Neil Walker[10] and made his MLB debut on June 10 playing 
right field.[11] In that game, he recorded his first career Major League 
hit against Chicago Cubs pitcher Travis Wood, later scoring his first career 
run. The following day, June 11, Polanco recorded his first Major League 
RBI. On June 13, as part of a five-hit game, Polanco hit his first career 
home run, a two-run shot, against the Miami Marlins in the 13th inning 
that would turn out to be the game winner in an 8–6 victory for the Pirates. 
On June 17, he became the third Pirates player—the first since Roberto 
Clemente in 1955—to record a hit in each of his first seven major league 
appearances.[12] The following day, he became the first Pirate to hit in 
his first eight games.[13] Polanco struggled for a month after a good start 
to his career, and was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis on August 25 before 
returning a week later as part of the expanded roster at the beginning 
of September.[14][15] On April 5, 2016 the Pittsburgh Pirates announced 
they had reached an agreement with Polanco and his agent Rafa Nieves on 
a $35 million contract extension.[16] Polanco is from Santo Domingo, villa
