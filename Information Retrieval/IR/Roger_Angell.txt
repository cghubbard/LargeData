Roger Angell (born September 19, 1920) is an American essayist known for 
his writing on sports, especially baseball. He has been a regular contributor 
to The New Yorker and was its chief fiction editor for many years.[3] He 
has written numerous works of fiction, non-fiction, and criticism, and 
for many years wrote an annual Christmas poem for The New Yorker.[3] He 
received a number of awards for his writing, including the George Polk 
Award for Commentary in 1980,[4] the Kenyon Review Award for Literary Achievement 
in 2005 along with Umberto Eco,[5] and the inaugural PEN/ESPN Lifetime 
Achievement Award for Literary Sports Writing in 2011. He was elected a 
Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007[6] and is a 
long-time ex-officio member of the council of the Authors Guild.[4] He 
was named the 2014 recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award by the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America on December 10, 2013. Angell is the son 
of Katharine Sergeant Angell White, The New Yorker’s first fiction editor, 
and the stepson of renowned essayist E. B. White, but was raised for the 
most part by his father, Ernest Angell, an attorney who became head of 
the American Civil Liberties Union.[7][8][9] Angell is a 1938 graduate 
of the Pomfret School and attended Harvard University.[10] He served in 
the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Angell's earliest 
published works were pieces of short fiction and personal narratives. Several 
of these pieces were collected in The Stone Arbor and Other Stories (1960) 
and A Day in the Life of Roger Angell (1970). He first contributed to The 
New Yorker in March, 1944. He first wrote professionally about baseball 
in 1962, when William Shawn, editor of The New Yorker, had him travel to 
Florida to write about spring training.[3][9] Angell has been called the 
"Poet Laureate of baseball" but dislikes the term.[3][9] In a review of 
Once More Around the Park for the Journal of Sport History, Richard C. 
Crepeau wrote that "Gone for Good", Angell's essay on the career of Steve 
Blass, "may be the best piece that anyone has ever written on baseball 
or any other sport".[11] Angell was one of several personalities who gave 
commentaries throughout the Ken Burns series, Baseball, in 1994. One of 
the most striking items from Angell's essays is one ultimately published 
in Season Ticket, involving a spring training trip to see the Baltimore 
Orioles, where he interviews Earl Weaver, then the manager of the Orioles, 
about Cal Ripken, Jr., who was about to start his rookie season. Angell 
quotes Weaver as saying about Ripken that, at whichever position the team 
decides (between shortstop and third base), "his manager can just write 
his name into the lineup every day for the next fifteen years; that's how 
good he is". Starting that year, Ripken in fact was written into lineups 
every day for more than fifteen years, setting the all-time consecutive-games-played 
streak of 2,632 games. Angell's quotation of Weaver stands as one of the 
most incredibly prescient (and well-documented) "first-guesses" in recorded 
literature.[citation needed] Angell has two children, Alice and John Henry. 
He had Alice and another daughter, Callie, with his first wife Evelyn,[1] 
and John Henry with Carol. Callie Angell, who was an authority on the films 
of Andy Warhol, committed suicide on May 5, 2010, in Manhattan, where she 
worked as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art; she was 62. 
In a 2014 essay, Angell mentioned her death -- "the oceanic force and mystery 
of that event"—and his struggle to comprehend that "a beautiful daughter 
of mine, my oldest child, had ended her life."[12] Alice Angell lives in 
Portland, Maine, and John Henry Angell lives in Portland, Oregon.[2] His 
second wife, Carol Rogge Angell, to whom he was married for 48 years, died
