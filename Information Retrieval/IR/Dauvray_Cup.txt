The Dauvray Cup was a championship trophy awarded in professional baseball 
from 1887 to 1893.[1][2] Named after Helen Dauvray, who presented the cup, 
it was initially awarded to the winner of the World Series between the 
National League and American Association. It was the first World Series 
trophy.[2] The last National League-American Association series was in 
1890, with the latter collapsing after the end of the following season. 
The cup was then awarded to the winner of the National League pennant. 
Like the Stanley Cup, the same trophy was used each season rather than 
a new one being made.[1] The Dauvray Cup has since been lost. The cup was 
named for its presenter, Broadway actress Helen Dauvray.[2] In 1887, Dauvray 
began a relationship with John Montgomery Ward, shortstop for the New York 
Giants and future Hall of Famer. Their marriage was announced in October 
of that year during the World Series.[3] Dauvray first announced her intentions 
to present the trophy in newspapers on May 21, 1887. The announcement described 
the cup as "a $500 silver cup" in "the form of a true lovers' cup ... about 
twelve inches high".[4][5] On June 1, the Gorham Silver Company began the 
process of creating the trophy. When some, including National League president 
Nicholas Young, suggested that the trophy was more for the owner of the 
winning team than the players, Dauvray agreed to award gold medals to the 
players of the winning team as well as one umpire.[3][6][7] Some newspapers 
at the time, including the Brooklyn Eagle and Police Gazette, dismissed 
the trophy as a publicity stunt designed more to promote Dauvray herself 
than out of a fondness for baseball.[3] The Dauvray Cup was first won in 
1887 by the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, who defeated the St. Louis Browns 
in the 1887 World Series.[7] It would also be won twice by Ward's Giants, 
in 1888 and 1889.[1] The cup was last awarded in 1893 to the Boston Beaneaters. 
The Beaneaters had won the cup three years in a row, having won the NL 
pennant in 1891 and 1892 as well. The rules established at the creation 
of the cup stated that it would permanently belong to the first team to 
win it three years in a row.[1][4][6] Dauvray, by that time no longer much 
interested in either Ward—they would divorce in November that same year—or 
baseball, took no steps to provide a new Dauvray Cup to replace the retired 
one.[8] A replacement would be provided by William Chase Temple, president 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, which became known as the Temple Cup.[1] According 
to John Thorn, official historian of Major League Baseball, the last mention 
of the presence of the Dauvray Cup was on November 12, 1893, in Newport, 
Kentucky. By June 1894, Sporting Life was wondering in print what had happened
