This is a list of the top 300 Major League Baseball leaders in home runs 
hit. In the sport of baseball, a home run is a hit in which the batter 
scores by circling all the bases and reaching home plate in one play, without 
the benefit of a fielding error. This can be accomplished either by hitting 
the ball out of play while it is still in fair territory (a conventional 
home run), or by an inside-the-park home run. Barry Bonds holds the Major 
League Baseball home run record with 762. He passed Hank Aaron, who is 
currently second with 755, on August 7, 2007. The only other player to 
have hit 700 or more is Babe Ruth with 714. Alex Rodriguez (696), Willie 
Mays (660), Ken Griffey, Jr. (630), Jim Thome (612) and Sammy Sosa (609) 
are the only other players to have hit 600 or more; Rodriguez is also the 
active leader in home runs. Listed are all Major League Baseball players 
with 213 or more home runs hit during official regular season (i.e., excluding 
playoffs or exhibition games). Players in bold face are active as of the 
2016 Major League Baseball season (including free agents), with the number 
in parentheses designating the number of home runs they have hit during 
the 2016 season. The last change in the cutoff for the top 300 occurred 
on September 16, 2016, when Justin Upton hit his 213th career home run.
