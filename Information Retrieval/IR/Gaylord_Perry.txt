Gaylord Jackson Perry (born September 15, 1938) is a former Major League 
Baseball right-handed pitcher. He pitched from 1962 to 1983 for eight different 
teams. During a 22-year baseball career, Perry compiled 314 wins, 3,534 
strikeouts, and a 3.11 earned run average. He was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1991. Perry, a five-time All-Star, was the first pitcher 
to win the Cy Young Award in each league, winning it in the American League 
in 1972 with the Cleveland Indians and in the National League in 1978 with 
the San Diego Padres. He is also distinguished, along with his brother 
Jim, for being the second-winningest brother combination in baseball history—second 
only to the knuckleballing Niekro brothers, Phil and Joe.[1] While pitching 
for the Seattle Mariners in 1982, Perry became the fifteenth member of 
the 300 win club. Despite Perry's notoriety for doctoring baseballs (e.g. 
throwing a spitball), and perhaps even more so for making batters think 
he was throwing them on a regular basis – he even went so far as to title 
his 1974 autobiography Me and the Spitter[2] – he was not ejected for the 
illegal practice until August 23, 1982, in his 21st season in the majors. 
Like most pitchers, Perry was not renowned for his hitting ability, and 
in his sophomore season of 1963, his manager Alvin Dark is said to have 
joked, "They'll put a man on the moon before he hits a home run." There 
are other variants on the story, but either way, on July 20, 1969, just 
an hour after the Apollo 11 spacecraft carrying Neil Armstrong and Buzz 
Aldrin landed on the moon, Perry hit the first home run of his career.[3] 
Gaylord Perry was born in Williamston, North Carolina, and named after 
a close friend of his father's, who died while having his teeth pulled.[4] 
He studied at Campbell University in his home state. The current mascot 
of the Campbell Fighting Camels and Lady Camels is Gaylord the Camel, named 
in honor of Gaylord Perry. Perry claims he was taught the spitball in 1964 
by pitcher Bob Shaw. Perry had a reputation throughout his career for doctoring 
baseballs, and was inspected on the mound by umpires and monitored closely 
by opposing teams.[5] On August 23, 1982, he was ejected from a game against 
the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball, and given a 10-day suspension. 
Perry reportedly approached the makers of Vaseline about endorsing the 
product and was allegedly rebuffed with a one-line postcard reading, "We 
soothe babies' backsides, not baseballs." Former manager Gene Mauch famously 
quipped "He should be in the Hall of Fame with a tube of K-Y Jelly attached 
to his plaque."[6] Gene Tenace, who caught Gaylord Perry when they played 
for the San Diego Padres, said: "I can remember a couple of occasions when 
I couldn't throw the ball back to him because it was so greasy that it 
slipped out of my hands. I just walked out to the mound and flipped the 
ball back to him."[7] Perry used his reputation to psyche out the hitters 
as well. As he looked in to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry 
would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. 
In this manner, he may or may not have been applying a foreign substance 
to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after 
striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. 
Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing 
Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be 
allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball. The spitball was not his only 
method for upsetting batters. Sports Illustrated's Joe Posnanski wrote 
of Perry, "My favorite trick pitch of his was the old Puffball, where he 
would load up on rosin so that a puff of white smoke would release while 
he threw his pitches. This was made illegal somewhere along the way (because 
of Perry, of course), but it's so awesome — it's like the sort of thing 
one of the villains on the old Batman TV show would do."[8] Perry played 
semi-professionally in Alpine, Texas at Kokernot Field in the early 1950s 
for the Alpine Cowboys. Bobby Biedermann was his catcher and roommate. 
Perry was signed by the San Francisco Giants on June 3, 1958 for $90,000, 
which was a big contract at the time. He spent 1958 with the St. Cloud, 
Minnesota team in Class A Northern League, compiling a 9–5 record and a 
2.39 ERA. In 1959 he was promoted to the Class AA Corpus Christi Giants, 
where he posted a less impressive 10–11 record and 4.05 ERA. He remained 
with the team as they became the Rio Grande Valley Giants in 1960, and 
an improved ERA of 2.82 earned him a promotion to the Class AAA Tacoma 
Giants for the 1961 season. At Tacoma, he led the Pacific Coast League 
in wins and inning pitched in 1961.[9] He had a brief call-up to the Major 
Leagues in 1962, making his debut on April 14 against the Cincinnati Reds. 
He appeared in 13 games in 1962, but had a 5.23 ERA and was sent back down 
to Tacoma for the remainder of the year.[9] With the addition of Perry, 
Bill James called that 1962 Tacoma squad, which featured numerous future 
major league players, the best minor league lineup of the 1960s.[4] After 
his brief call-up in 1962, Perry joined the Giants in 1963 to work mostly 
as a relief pitcher that year, posting a mediocre 4.03 ERA in 31 appearances. 
Nevertheless, in 1964 he was given the opportunity to join the starting 
rotation, finishing with a 2.75 ERA and a 12–11 record, both second best 
for the Giants that year behind Juan Marichal. In 1965 his record was 8–12, 
and with two full seasons as a starter, his 24–30 record attracted little 
national attention.[9] Perry's breakout season came in 1966 with a tremendous 
start, going 20–2 into August. Perry and Marichal became known as a "1–2 
punch" to rival the famous Koufax/Drysdale combination of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. While Marichal was NL Player of the Month in May, Perry was so 
named in June (5-0, 0.90 ERA, 31 SO). He played in his first All-Star game, 
but after August, he slumped the rest of the season, finishing 21–8, and 
the Giants finished second to the Dodgers. Marichal missed much of the 
1967 season with a leg injury, and Perry was thrust into the role of team 
ace. While he finished the season with a disappointing 15–17 record, he 
had a low ERA and allowed only 7 hits per 9 innings pitched.[10] Perry 
had similar numbers in 1968: he posted a 16-15 record, but with a then-career-best 
2.45 ERA on a Giants team that finished second to the St. Louis Cardinals. 
On September 17 of that year, two days after his 30th birthday, Perry no-hit 
the Cardinals and Bob Gibson 1-0 at Candlestick Park. The lone run came 
on a first-inning home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt—the second of the 
only two he would hit that season. The very next day, the Cardinals returned 
the favor on the Giants on a 2–0 no-hitter by Ray Washburn—the first time 
in Major League history that back-to-back no-hitters had been pitched in 
the same series.[10] In 1969, Perry led the league in innings pitched, 
but the Giants finished second in the pennant race for the fifth straight 
season. Perry took over as the Giants' ace in 1970, and led the league 
both in wins (23) and innings pitched (328). Perry's strong 1970 performance 
salvaged the Giants season, helping them finish above .500 but in third 
place. In 1971, the Giants finally won their division, with Perry posting 
a 2.76 ERA. In what would be his only two postseason appearances, Perry 
won one game and lost the other against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[11] Before 
the 1972 season, the Giants traded the then 32-year-old Perry and shortstop 
Frank Duffy to the Cleveland Indians for 29-year-old flamethrower Sam McDowell, 
the ace of the Indians' staff. After that trade Perry went on to win 180 
more games in his career while McDowell won only 24 more. Perry went 24–16 
in 1972 with a 1.92 ERA and 1 save, winning his first Cy Young Award. He 
stood as the only Cy Young winner for Cleveland until 2007 (CC Sabathia). 
He was named AL Player of the Month in June 1974 with a 6-0 record, 1.00 
ERA, and 39 strikeouts, thus becoming the first player to win the award 
in both leagues (the AL had only begun to issue the award in April of that 
season). Perry continued as Cleveland's staff ace until 1975. He went 70–57 
during his time in Cleveland, but the team never finished above 4th place. 
Perry accounted for 39% of all Cleveland wins during his tenure. Tensions 
between him and player-manager Frank Robinson led to Perry's trade to Texas 
in June 1975. Gaylord Perry remained as Cleveland's last 20-game winner 
(21 wins in 1974), until Cliff Lee in 2008. On June 13, 1975, at the start 
of a three-game series with the Texas Rangers, the Indians traded Perry 
to the Rangers in exchange for pitchers Jim Bibby, Jackie Brown, and Rick 
Waits. Perry was feuding with Indians player/manager Frank Robinson.[12] 
Perry would win nearly 80 more games in his career than the three combined. 
With the Rangers, Perry formed a one-two punch with Ferguson Jenkins, with 
Perry earning 12 wins, and Jenkins 11, during the remainder of 1975. However, 
the Rangers, who had finished 2nd in the AL West in 1974, slipped to 3rd 
place that year. The next year, with Jenkins moving to Boston, the 37-year-old 
Perry became the staff ace, winning 15 games against 14 defeats. The Rangers, 
however, slipped to 4th place in the AL West. But then, in 1977, the Rangers 
surged to 2nd place in the AL West, winning 94 games, a total that the 
franchise would not surpass until 1999. Perry again won 15 games, this 
time against only 12 defeats, in a rotation that included double-digit 
winners Doyle Alexander, Bert Blyleven, and Dock Ellis. Before the 1978 
season San Diego acquired Perry from Texas in exchange for middle reliever 
Dave Tomlin and $125,000. The 39-year-old Perry wound up winning the Cy 
Young Award going 21–6 for San Diego while the 29-year-old Tomlin never 
pitched for Texas and pitched barely 150 innings the rest of his career. 
Perry's 21 wins in 1978 accounted for 25% of the club's victories all year 
long, and he became the first pitcher to win Cy Young Awards in both leagues. 
In this season he became the third pitcher to strike out 3,000 batters, 
accomplishing the feat two weeks after his 40th birthday.[13] In 1979, 
Perry posted a 3.05 ERA and a 12–11 record before quitting the team on 
September 5, saying he would retire unless the club traded him back to 
Texas.[14] The Padres traded Perry to the Texas Rangers on February 15, 
1980.[13] In 1980, Perry posted a 6–9 record and 3.43 ERA in 24 games with 
Texas before being traded to the Yankees on August 13, 1980 for minor leaguers 
Ken Clay and a player to be named later (Marvin Thompson).[15] Many Yankees 
players had complained about Perry during his stints with the Rangers, 
and the club even used a special camera team to monitor his movements during 
one of his starts at Yankee Stadium.[16] Perry finished the season with 
a 4–4 record for the Yankees.[17] Perry's contract was up after the 1980 
season and he signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with the Atlanta Braves.[18] 
During the strike-shortened 1981 season, Perry, the oldest player at the 
time in Major League baseball, started 23 games (150.7 innings) and had 
an 8–9 record.[17] The Braves released Perry after the season, leaving 
him three victories short of 300.[5] After being released by the Braves, 
Perry was unable to find interest from any clubs, and missed his first 
spring training in 23 years.[5] He eventually signed with the Seattle Mariners, 
where he acquired the nickname "Ancient Mariner",[19] and won his 300th 
game on May 6, 1982, the first pitcher to win 300 since Early Wynn did 
so in 1963. On August 23 of that year, he was ejected from a game against 
the Boston Red Sox for doctoring the ball, and given a 10-day suspension. 
It was the second time Perry had been ejected in his entire career, and 
it was his first ejection for ball doctoring.[7] After starting the 1983 
season 3–10, Perry was designated for assignment by Seattle on June 26 
and the Kansas City Royals picked him on a waiver claim 10 days later.[20] 
In August, Perry became the third pitcher in history to record 3,500 strikeouts.[21] 
On July 24 he took the pine tar bat that was used to call George Brett 
out against the Yankees and tried to hide it from the umpires. In the final 
months of the season, Perry experimented with a submarine delivery for 
the first time in his career and took a no-hitter into the eighth inning 
against the first-place Baltimore Orioles on August 19.[22] In 1983, he 
became the third pitcher in the same year to surpass longtime strikeout 
king Walter Johnson's record of 3,509 strikeouts. Steve Carlton and Nolan 
Ryan were the others. He announced his retirement on September 23, 1983. 
Perry retired in 1983 after pitching for eight teams (the San Francisco 
Giants, Cleveland Indians, Texas Rangers (twice), San Diego Padres, New 
York Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Seattle Mariners and Kansas City Royals). 
Perry retired to his 500-acre (2.0 km2) farm in Martin County, North Carolina 
where he grew tobacco and peanuts, but had to file for bankruptcy in 1986. 
He briefly worked for Fiesta Foods as a sales manager,[23] and later in 
the year Limestone College in Gaffney, South Carolina chose Perry to be 
the College's first baseball coach. Perry was there until 1991 when he 
retired.[24] Despite his admission of illegal pitches he was elected to 
the Hall of Fame in 1991 and was nominated as a finalist for the Major 
League Baseball All-Century Team. In 1999 The Sporting News ranked him 
97th on their list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. Perry supported 
the Republican Party, campaigned for Jesse Helms and contemplated a bid 
for Congress himself in 1986.[25] On July 23, 2005 the San Francisco Giants 
retired Perry's uniform number 36.[26] Perry was inducted into the Bay 
Area Sports Hall of Fame on March 9, 2009.[27] He was honored on April 
9, 2011 at AT&T Park with a 2010 World Series World Series ring along with 
other San Francisco Giants greats Willie McCovey, Orlando Cepeda, and Willie 
Mays. Of the four, only Mays, as a member of the 1954 team, had previously 
received a World Series ring from playing for the Giants. He was honored 
again on April 18, 2015 at AT&T Parkwith a 2014 World Series ring along 
with Mays, McCovey, Cepeda, and Juan Marichal. Due to the number of games 
Perry lost (265) and lack of postseason glory, the Washington Post called 
Perry's bid for the Hall of Fame "dubious".[28] Bill James lists Perry 
as having the 10th best career of any right-handed starting pitcher, and 
the 50th greatest player at any position.[29] In 1999, The Sporting News 
placed Perry at number 97 on its list of "The 100 Greatest Baseball Players."[30] 
Perry is one of five pitchers to win the Cy Young Award in both the American 
and National League (Pedro Martínez, Roger Clemens, Randy Johnson, and 
Roy Halladay being the others). He held the record for most consecutive 
15-win seasons since 1900 with 13 (1966–1978) and was 2nd all-time to Cy 
Young, who had 15 (1891–1905). Greg Maddux surpassed both men, with 17 
in a row (1988–2004). Perry's wife, Blanche Manning Perry, died on September 
11, 1987 when a car ran a stop sign and hit her car broadside on U.S. Route 
27 in Lake Wales, Florida.[31] Daughters: Amy, Beth, and Allison. Son Gaylord 
Jackson "Jack" Perry, Jr. died of leukemia in 2005. His nephew, Chris,
