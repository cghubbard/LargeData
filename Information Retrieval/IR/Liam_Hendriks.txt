Liam Johnson Hendriks (born 10 February 1989) is an Australian professional 
baseball pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has previously played for the Minnesota Twins, Kansas City Royals, and 
Toronto Blue Jays. Born and raised in Perth, Australia, Hendriks began 
playing tee-ball when he was 5 rather than the traditional Australian summer 
game of cricket, before transitioning to baseball at the age of ten. He 
also played Australian rules football.[1][2] and at one stage made both 
the All Australian football and All Australian baseball teams in the same 
year. Hendriks continued playing both baseball and football through high 
school at Sacred Heart College in his hometown of Perth. Hendriks' grandfather 
and father both played football in the Western Australian Football League 
and Liam was eligible to be drafted by the West Coast Eagles under the 
Father/Son draft rule had he decided to pursue a career in football. At 
sixteen Hendriks was forced to make a decision as the two sports began 
to clash. Deciding on baseball he was signed by the Minnesota Twins on 
his eighteenth birthday. Hendriks debuted for the Twins in 2007 pitching 
for the Gulf Coast League Twins. He led the team in strikeouts with 52. 
He was also named as a Twins Top 50 prospect.[3] He pitched for the Perth 
Heat in the 2008 Claxton Shield and went 3–0 with a 1.90 ERA and 25 K's, 
a competition high. Liam was then added to the Australian national team 
for the 2008 Final Olympic Qualification Tournament pitching five innings 
of work while only allowing one unearned run alongside two hits and a walk 
while striking out six. Hendriks underwent back surgery that prevented 
him from playing in the minors in the 2008 season, but made the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic roster, the youngest Australian player in the Classic.[4] 
In 2009 Hendriks spent the season with the Class-A Beloit Snappers of the 
Midwest League and the Rookie-Level Elizabethton Twins of the Appalachian
