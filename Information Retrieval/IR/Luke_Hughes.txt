Luke Trevor Hughes (born 2 August 1984) is an Australian professional baseball 
infielder for the Perth Heat of the Australian Baseball League. He played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics 
and also played in international competition for the Australia national 
baseball team. Hughes played the 2001/2002 season in the International 
Baseball League of Australia, where he was named as the All-Star second 
baseman. He helped the Perth Heat win the 2003 Claxton Shield with a .429 
batting average. He also won the Golden Glove in the 2004 Claxton Shield. 
He currently plays for the Perth Heat in the Australian Baseball League 
and grew up playing for the Morley Eagles Baseball Club. He was then signed 
to the Minnesota Twins early 2002. He debuted professionally a year later 
with the GCL Twins, reaching base safely in 19 straight games at one point. 
He was named to the Gulf Coast League All-Star team at third base. In 2004, 
he moved to the Elizabethton Twins and played second base. After two seasons 
with the New Britain Rock Cats and appearances for the 2007 and 2008 Eastern 
League All-Star team, he was promoted to AAA with the Rochester Red Wings. 
He also played in the 2008 All-Star Futures Game and was the only Australian 
that played for the World team. On 24 April 2010 he was called up to the 
Minnesota Twins Major League roster as Nick Punto was sent to the DL. On 
28 April 2010 he debuted for the Twins at third base. In his first Major 
League at bat he hit a home run against Detroit Tigers pitcher Max Scherzer. 
In comparison, hitting a first at bat home run is twice as rare as throwing 
a no-hitter. Hughes' home run was calculated to have gone 360 feet.[1] 
He is the 106th person in MLB history to homer in his first major league 
at-bat dating back to 1855 (less than once per season: .68), and was the 
2nd to do so during the 2010 season (the first was Jason Heyward). Five 
other Twins have homered in their first at-bat: Rick Renick (1968), Dave 
McKay (1975), Gary Gaetti (1981), Andre David (1984), and Eddie Rosario 
(2015). On 22 April 2012 he was claimed off of waivers by the Oakland Athletics 
to make room on the Twins roster for RHP Jason Marquis. However, 8 days 
later, Hughes was designated for assignment when Brandon Inge was signed. 
Hughes was 1â€“13 in 4 games with Oakland while striking out 6 times.[2] 
He was released on 17 July. Toronto Blue Jays signed Hughes on 1 August 
2012 and assigned him to their AAA affiliate Las Vegas 51s. Hughes played 
for Australia in the 2005 Baseball World Cup where he batted 1 for 15. 
Again he played in the 2006 World Baseball Classic going 0 from 3. In 2006 
he picked up his form in the Intercontinental Cup, the Australian batted 
.455 and slugged .755. In 5 games at second and four at third, he was error-free. 
Hughes hit .333 for Australia in the 2007 Baseball World Cup. Hughes tied 
a game against the Dutch national team with a 9th-inning sacrifice fly. 
Against the Venezuela national team, Luke cracked a 3-run homer in the 
bottom of the 11th to win the game. He broke open a tie game against Team 
Canada in the top of the 9th with a double and the go-ahead run. America's 
Jayson Nix beat him out for All-Star honours at second base in the tournament.
