Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated 
in England in the first half of the 19th century.[3] One of the two codes 
of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its 
most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players (two more than 
rugby league) using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped 
goalposts on each try line. In 1845, the first football laws were written 
by Rugby School pupils; other significant events in the early development 
of rugby include the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association 
in 1863 and the split between rugby union and rugby league in 1895. Historically 
an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to players were removed, 
making the game openly professional at the highest level for the first 
time.[4] World Rugby, originally the International Rugby Football Board 
(IRFB) and from 1998 to 2014 the International Rugby Board (IRB), has been 
the governing body for rugby union since 1886. Rugby union spread from 
the Home Nations of Great Britain and Ireland, and was absorbed by many 
of the countries associated with the British Empire. Early exponents of 
the sport included Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France. Countries 
that have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport include 
Fiji, Georgia, Madagascar,[5] New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga and Wales. Rugby 
union is played in over 100 countries across six continents; there are 
101 full members and 18 associate members of World Rugby. The Rugby World 
Cup, first held in 1987, takes place every four years with the winner of 
the tournament receiving the Webb Ellis Cup. The Six Nations Championship 
in Europe and The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere are major 
annual competitions. Major domestic competitions include the English Premiership 
in England, Top 14 in France, the Mitre 10 Cup in New Zealand, National 
Rugby Championship in Australia, and the Currie Cup in South Africa. Other 
transnational competitions include the Pro12, involving Irish, Italian, 
Scottish and Welsh teams; the European Rugby Champions Cup, involving the 
top European teams from their respective domestic competitions; and Super 
Rugby, launched in 1996 with Australian, New Zealand and South African 
teams and since 2016 also including teams in Argentina and Japan. The origin 
of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of English 
school football at Rugby School in 1823, when William Webb Ellis is said 
to have picked up the ball and run with it.[6] Although the evidence for 
the story is doubtful, it was immortalised at the school with a plaque 
unveiled in 1895.[7][8] Despite the doubtful evidence, the Rugby World 
Cup trophy is named after Webb Ellis. Rugby football stems from the form 
of game played at Rugby School, which former pupils then introduced to 
their university. Old Rugbeian Albert Pell, a student at Cambridge, is 
credited with having formed the first "football" team.[9] During this early 
period different schools used different rules, with former pupils from 
Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their 
universities.[10] A significant event in the early development of rugby 
football was the production of the first written laws of the game at Rugby 
School in 1845,[11][12] which was followed by the 'Cambridge Rules' drawn 
up in 1848.[13] Other important events include the Blackheath Club's decision 
to leave the Football Association in 1863[14][15] and the formation of 
the Rugby Football Union in 1871.[14] The code was originally known as 
"rugby football"; it was not until after the schism in England in 1895, 
which resulted in the separate code of rugby league, that the sport took 
on the name "rugby union" to differentiate it from the league game.[16] 
Despite the sport's full name of rugby union, it is known simply as rugby 
throughout most of the world.[17] The first rugby football international 
was played on 27 March 1871 between Scotland and England. Scotland won 
the game 1-0.[14][18] By 1881 both Ireland and Wales had representative 
teams, and in 1883 the first international competition, the Home Nations 
Championship had begun. 1883 is also the year of the first rugby sevens 
tournament, the Melrose Sevens,[19] which is still held annually. Two important 
overseas tours took place in 1888: a British Isles team visited Australia 
and New Zealand—although a private venture, it laid the foundations for 
future British and Irish Lions tours;[20] and the 1888–89 New Zealand Native 
football team brought the first overseas team to British spectators.[21] 
During the early history of rugby union, a time before commercial air travel, 
teams from different continents rarely met. The first two notable tours 
both took place in 1888—the British Isles team touring New Zealand and 
Australia,[22] followed by the New Zealand team touring Europe.[23] Traditionally 
the most prestigious tours were the Southern Hemisphere countries of Australia, 
New Zealand and South Africa making a tour of a Northern Hemisphere, and 
the return tours made by a joint British and Irish team.[24] Tours would 
last for months, due to long traveling times and the number of games undertaken; 
the 1888 New Zealand team began their tour in Hawkes Bay in June and did 
not complete their schedule until August 1889, having played 107 rugby 
matches.[25] Touring international sides would play Test matches against 
international opponents, including national, club and county sides in the 
case of Northern Hemisphere rugby, or provincial/state sides in the case 
of Southern Hemisphere rugby.[22][26] Between 1905 and 1908, all three 
major Southern Hemisphere rugby countries sent their first touring teams 
to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa 
in 1906 and Australia in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, 
fitness levels and tactics,[27] and were far more successful than critics 
had expected.[28] The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before 
each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest 
that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National 
Anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, as a response. After Morgan began singing, 
the crowd joined in: the first time a national anthem was sung at the start 
of a sporting event.[29][nb 2] In 1905 France played England in its first 
international match.[27] Rugby union was included as an event in the Olympic 
Games four times during the early 20th century. No international rugby 
games and union-sponsored club matches were played during the First World 
War, but competitions continued through service teams such as the New Zealand 
Army team.[31] During the Second World War no international matches were 
played by most countries, though Italy, Germany and Romania played a limited 
number of games,[32][33][34] and Cambridge and Oxford continued their annual 
University Match.[35] The first officially sanctioned international rugby 
sevens tournament took place in 1973 at Murrayfield, one of Scotland's 
biggest stadiums, as part of the Scottish Rugby Union centenary celebrations.[36] 
In 1987 the first Rugby World Cup was held in Australia and New Zealand, 
and the inaugural winners were New Zealand. The first World Cup Sevens 
tournament was held at Murrayfield in 1993. Rugby Sevens was introduced 
into the Commonwealth Games in 1998 and has been added to the Olympic Games 
of 2016.[37] Rugby union was an amateur sport until the IRB declared the 
game "open" in 1995, removing restrictions on payments to players.[38][39] 
However, the pre-1995 period of rugby union was marked by frequent accusations 
of "shamateurism",[40] including an investigation in Britain by a House 
of Commons Select committee.[41][42] Following the introduction of professionalism 
trans-national club competitions were started, with the Heineken Cup in 
the Northern Hemisphere and Super Rugby in the Southern Hemisphere.[43][44] 
The Tri Nations, an annual international tournament involving Australia, 
New Zealand and South Africa, kicked off in 1996.[44] In 2012, this competition 
was extended to include Argentina, a country whose impressive performances 
in international games (especially finishing in third place in the 2007 
Rugby World Cup) was deemed to merit inclusion in the competition. As a 
result of the expansion to four teams, the tournament was renamed The Rugby 
Championship.[45] Each team starts the match with 15 players on the field 
and seven or eight substitutes.[46] Players in a team are divided into 
eight forwards (two more than in rugby league) and seven backs.[47] The 
main responsibilities of the forward players are to gain and retain possession 
of the ball.[48] Players in these positions are generally bigger and stronger 
and take part in the scrum and line-out.[48] The forwards are often collectively 
referred to as the 'pack', especially when in the scrum formation.[49] 
Front row The front row consists of three players: two props (the loosehead 
prop and the tighthead prop) and the hooker. The role of the two props 
is to support the hooker during scrums, to provide support for the jumpers 
during line-outs and to provide strength and power in rucks and mauls. 
The third position in the front row is the hooker. The hooker is a key 
position in attacking and defensive play and is responsible for winning 
the ball in the scrum. Hookers normally throw the ball in at line-outs.[47][50] 
Second row The second row consists of two locks or lock forwards. Locks 
are usually the tallest players in the team, and specialise as line-out 
jumpers.[47] The main role of the lock in line-outs is to make a standing 
jump, often supported by the other forwards, to either collect the thrown 
ball or ensure the ball comes down on their side. Locks also have an important 
role in the scrum, binding directly behind the three front row players 
and providing forward drive.[47] Back row The back row, not to be confused 
with ‘Backs’, is the third and final row of the forward positions, they 
are often referred to as the loose forwards.[49] The three positions in 
the back row are the two flankers and the number 8. The two flanker positions, 
called the blindside flanker and openside flanker, are the final row in 
the scrum. They are usually the most mobile forwards in the game. Their 
main role is to win possession through 'turn overs'.[47] The number 8 packs 
down between the two locks at the back of the scrum. The role of the number 
8 in the scrum is to control the ball after it has been heeled back from 
the front of the pack and the position provides a link between the forwards 
and backs during attacking phases.[51] The backs' role is to create and 
convert point-scoring opportunities. They are generally smaller, faster 
and more agile than the forwards.[48] Another distinction between the backs 
and the forwards is that the backs are expected to have superior kicking 
and ball handling skills, especially the fly-half, scrum-half and full-back.[48] 
Half-backs The half-backs consist of two positions, the scrum-half and 
the fly-half. The fly-half is crucial to a team's game plan, orchestrating 
the team's performance.[51] They are usually the first to receive the ball 
from the scrum-half following a breakdown, lineout, or scrum, and need 
to be decisive with what actions to take and be effective at communicating 
with the outside backs.[51] Many fly-halfs are also their team's goal kickers. 
The scrum-half is the link between the forwards and the backs.[51] They 
receive the ball from the lineout and remove the ball from the back of 
the scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half.[52] They also feed the scrum 
and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward.[53] Three quarters 
There are four three quarter positions, the inside centre, outside centre 
and left and right wings. The centres will attempt to tackle attacking 
players; whilst in attack they should employ speed and strength to breach 
opposition defences.[51] The wings are generally positioned on the outside 
of the backline. Their primary function is to finish off moves and score 
tries.[54] Wings are usually the fastest players in the team and are elusive 
runners who use their speed to avoid tackles.[55] Fullbacks The fullback 
normally positions himself several metres behind the back line. He fields 
any opposition kicks and is often the last line of defence should an opponent 
break through the back line.[51] Two of the most important attributes of 
a good fullback are dependable catching skills and a good kicking game.[56] 
Rugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points 
wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding 
the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead-ball line), 
is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful 
penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points.[57] The values of each 
of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.[58] The field 
of play on a rugby pitch is as near as possible to a maximum of 144 metres 
(157 yd) long by 70 metres (77 yd) wide.[59] In actual gameplay there should 
be a maximum of 100 metres (109 yd) between the two try-lines, with anywhere 
between 10 and 22 metres behind each try line to serve as the in-goal area.[59] 
Several lines cross the field, notably the half way line and the "twenty 
two", which is 22 metres (24 yd) from the goal line.[59] Stricter rules 
apply to the pitch size for matches between national representative teams. 
The same maximums apply in this case, but the distance between the two 
try-lines must also be at least 94 metres (103 yd) and the pitch must be 
at least 68 metres (74 yd) wide.[59] Rugby goalposts are H-shaped, and 
consist of two poles, 5.6 metres (6.1 yd) apart, connected by a horizontal 
crossbar 3 metres (3.3 yd) above the ground.[59][60] At the beginning of 
the game, the captains and the referee toss a coin to decide which team 
will kick off first. Play then starts with a drop kick, with the players 
chasing the ball into the opposition's territory, and the other side trying 
to retrieve the ball and advance it. If the ball does not reach the opponent’s 
10-metre line the opposing team has two choices: to have the ball kicked 
off again, or to have a scrum at the centre of the half-way line.[61] If 
the player with the ball is tackled, frequently a ruck will result.[62] 
Games are divided into 40-minute halves, with a break in the middle.[63] 
The sides exchange ends of the field after the half-time break.[63] Stoppages 
for injury or to allow the referee to take disciplinary action do not count 
as part of the playing time, so that the elapsed time is usually longer 
than 80 minutes.[63] The referee is responsible for keeping time, even 
when—as in many professional tournaments—he is assisted by an official 
time-keeper.[63] If time expires while the ball is in play, the game continues 
until the ball is "dead", and only then will the referee blow the whistle 
to signal half-time or full-time; but if the referee awards a penalty or 
free-kick, the game continues.[63] In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, 
most notably the Rugby World Cup, two extra time periods of 10 minutes 
periods are played (with an interval of 5 minutes in between) if the game 
is tied after full-time. If scores are level after 100 minutes then the 
rules call for 20 minutes of sudden-death extra time to be played. If the 
sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition 
is used to determine the winner. However, no match in the history of the 
Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra 
time period.[64] Forward passing (throwing the ball ahead to another player) 
is not allowed; the ball can be passed laterally or backwards.[65] The 
ball tends to be moved forward in three ways — by kicking, by a player 
running with it or within a scrum or maul. Only the player with the ball 
may be tackled or rucked. When a ball is knocked forward by a player with 
his/her arms, a "knock-on" is committed, and play is restarted with a scrum.[65] 
Any player may kick the ball forward in an attempt to gain territory. When 
a player anywhere in the playing area kicks indirectly into touch so that 
the ball first bounces in the field of play, the throw-in is taken where 
the ball went into touch.[66] If the player kicks directly into touch (i.e. 
without bouncing in-field first) from within one's own 22-metre line, the 
lineout is taken by the opposition where the ball went into touch, but 
if the ball is kicked into touch directly by a player outside the 22-metre 
line, the lineout is taken level to where the kick was taken.[66] The aim 
of the defending side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing 
them to ground (a tackle, which is frequently followed by a ruck), or by 
contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul). 
Such a circumstance is called a breakdown and each is governed by a specific 
law. Tackling A player may tackle an opposing player who has the ball by 
holding them while bringing them to ground. Tacklers cannot tackle above 
the shoulder (the neck and head are out of bounds),[67] and the tackler 
has to attempt to wrap their arms around the player being tackled to complete 
the tackle. It is illegal to push, shoulder-charge, or to trip a player 
using feet or legs, but hands may be used (this being referred to as a 
tap-tackle or ankle-tap).[68][69] Tacklers may not tackle an opponent who 
has jumped to catch a ball until the player has landed.[67] Rucking and 
Mauling Mauls occur after a player with the ball has come into contact 
with an opponent but the handler remains on his feet; once any combination 
of at least three players have bound themselves a maul has been set.[49] 
A ruck is similar to the maul, but in this case the ball has gone to ground 
with at least three attacking players binding themselves on the ground 
in an attempt to secure the ball.[49] When the ball leaves the side of 
the field, a line-out is awarded against the team which last touched the 
ball.[70] Forward players from each team line up a metre apart, perpendicular 
to the touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline.[70] The ball 
is thrown from the touchline down the centre of the lines of forwards by 
a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball 
into touch.[70] The exception to this is when the ball went out from a 
penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball 
in.[70] Both sides compete for the ball and players may lift their teammates.[71] 
A jumping player cannot be tackled until they stand and only shoulder-to-shoulder 
contact is allowed; deliberate infringement of this law is dangerous play, 
and results in a penalty kick.[72] A scrum is a way of restarting the game 
safely and fairly after a minor infringement.[73] It is awarded when the 
ball has been knocked or passed forward, if a player takes the ball over 
his own try line and puts the ball down, when a player is accidentally 
offside or when the ball is trapped in a ruck or maul with no realistic 
chance of being retrieved. A team may also opt for a scrum if awarded a 
penalty.[73] A scrum is formed by the eight forwards from each team binding 
together in three rows.[73] The front row consists of the two props (loosehead 
and tighthead) either side of the hooker.[73] The second row consists of 
two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. 
This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation.[74] Once a scrum is formed 
the scrum-half from the team awarded the feed rolls the ball into the gap 
between the two front-rows known as the tunnel.[73] The two hookers then 
compete for possession by hooking the ball backwards with their feet, while 
each pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards to help gain possession.[73] 
The side that wins possession transfers the ball to the back of the scrum, 
where it is picked up either by the number 8 or by the scrum-half.[73] 
There are three match officials: a referee, and two assistant referees.[75] 
The latter, formerly known as touch judges, had the primary function of 
indicating when the ball had gone into "touch"; their role has been expanded 
and they are now expected to assist the referee in a number of areas, such 
as watching for foul play and checking offside lines.[75] In addition, 
for matches in high level competitions, there is often a television match 
official (TMO; popularly called the "video referee"), to assist with certain 
decisions, linked up to the referee by radio.[76] The referees have a system 
of hand signals to indicate their decisions.[77] Common offences include 
tackling above the shoulders, collapsing a scrum, ruck or maul, not releasing 
the ball when on the ground, or being offside.[78] The non-offending team 
has a number of options when awarded a penalty: a "tap" kick, when the 
ball is kicked a very short distance from hand, allowing the kicker to 
regather the ball and run with it; a punt, when the ball is kicked a long 
distance from hand, for field position; a place-kick, when the kicker will 
attempt to score a goal; or a scrum.[78] Players may be sent off (signalled 
by a red card) or temporarily suspended ("sin-binned") for ten minutes 
(yellow card) for foul play or repeated infringements, and may not be replaced.[78] 
Occasionally, infringements are not caught by the referee during the match 
and these may be "cited" by the citing commissioner after the match and 
have punishments (usually suspension for a number of weeks) imposed on 
the infringing player.[79] During the match, players may be replaced (for 
injury) or substituted (for tactical reasons).[46] A player who has been 
replaced may not rejoin play unless he was temporarily replaced to have 
bleeding controlled; a player who has been substituted may return temporarily, 
to replace a player who has a blood injury or has suffered a concussion, 
or permanently, if he is replacing a front-row forward.[46] In international 
matches, eight replacements are allowed; in domestic or cross-border tournaments, 
at the discretion of the responsible national union(s), the number of replacements 
may be nominated to a maximum of eight, of whom three must be sufficiently 
trained and experienced to provide cover for the three front row positions.[46][80] 
Prior to 2016, all substitutions, no matter the cause, counted against 
the limit during a match. In 2016, World Rugby changed the law so that 
substitutions made to replace a player deemed unable to continue due to 
foul play by the opposition would no longer count against the match limit. 
This change was introduced in January of that year in the Southern Hemisphere 
and June in the Northern Hemisphere.[81] The most basic items of equipment 
for a game of rugby union are the ball itself, a rugby shirt (also known 
as a "jersey"), rugby shorts, socks and boots. The rugby ball is oval in 
shape, (technically a prolate spheroid), and is made up of four panels.[82] 
The ball was historically made of leather, but in the modern era most games 
use a ball made from a synthetic material. The WR lays out specific dimensions 
for the ball, 280-300mm in length, 740-770mm in circumference of length 
and 580-620mm in circumference of width.[82] Rugby boots have soles with 
studs to allow grip on the turf of the pitch. The studs may be either metal 
or plastic but must not have any sharp edges or ridges.[83] Protective 
equipment is optional and strictly regulated. The most common items are 
mouthguards, which are worn by almost all players, and are compulsory in 
some rugby-playing nations.[84] Other protective items that are permitted 
include head gear; thin (not more than 10 mm thick), non-rigid shoulder 
pads and shin guards; which are worn underneath socks.[83] Bandages or 
tape can be worn to support or protect injuries; some players wear tape 
around the head to protect the ears in scrums and rucks. Female players 
may also wear chest pads.[83] Although not worn for protection, some types 
of fingerless mitts are allowed to aid grip.[83] It is the responsibility 
of the match officials to check players' clothing and equipment before 
a game to ensure that it conforms to the laws of the game.[83] The international 
governing body of rugby union (and associated games such as sevens) is 
World Rugby (WR).[85] The WR headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland.[85] WR, 
founded in 1886, governs the sport worldwide and publishes the game's laws 
and rankings.[85] As of February 2014, WR (then known as the IRB, for International 
Rugby Board) recorded 119 unions in its membership, 101 full members and 
18 associate member countries.[2] According to WR, rugby union is played 
by men and women in over 100 countries.[85] WR controls the Rugby World 
Cup,[85] the Women's Rugby World Cup,[86] Rugby World Cup Sevens,[87] HSBC 
Sevens Series,[88] HSBC Women's Sevens Series,[89] World Under 20 Championship,[90] 
World Under 20 Trophy,[91] Nations Cup[92] and the Pacific Nations Cup.[93] 
WR holds votes to decide where each of these events are be held, except 
in the case of the Sevens World Series for men and women, for which WR 
contracts with several national unions to hold individual events. Six regional 
associations, which are members of WR, form the next level of administration; 
these are: SANZAAR (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina 
Rugby) is a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, the New Zealand 
Rugby Union, the Australian Rugby Union and the Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) 
that operates Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri 
Nations before the entry of Argentina).[100] Although UAR initially had 
no representation on the former SANZAR board, it was granted input into 
the organisation's issues, especially with regard to The Rugby Championship,[101] 
and became a full SANZAAR member in 2016 (when the country entered Super 
Rugby). National unions oversee rugby union within individual countries 
and are affiliated to WR. Since 2016, the WR Council has 40 seats. A total 
of 11 unions—the eight foundation unions of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, England, 
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France, plus Argentina, Canada 
and Italy—have two seats. In addition, the six regional associations have 
two seats. Four more unions—Georgia, Japan, Romania and the USA—have one 
seat each. Finally, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, who usually come from 
one of the eight foundation unions (although the current Vice Chairman, 
Agustín Pichot, is with the non-foundation Argentine union) have one vote 
each.[102] [85] The earliest countries to adopt rugby union were England, 
the country of inception, and the other three Home Nations, Scotland, Ireland 
and Wales. The spread of rugby union as a global sport has its roots in 
the exporting of the game by British expatriates, military personnel and 
over-seas university students. The first rugby club in France was formed 
by British residents in Le Havre in 1872, while the next year Argentina 
recorded its first game: 'Banks' v 'City' in Buenos Aires.[103] At least 
six countries have adopted rugby union as their de facto national sport; 
they are Fiji,[104] Georgia,[105][106] New Zealand,[107] Samoa,[108] Tonga[109] 
and Wales.[110] A rugby club was formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia 
in 1864; while the sport was said to have been introduced to New Zealand 
by Charles Monro in 1870, who played rugby while a student at Christ's 
College, Finchley.[14] Several island nations have embraced the sport of 
rugby. Rugby was first played in Fiji circa 1884 by European and Fijian 
soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba on Viti Levu island.[111][112] 
Fiji then sent their first overseas team to Samoa in 1924, who in turn 
set up their own union in 1927.[113] Along with Tonga, other countries 
to have national rugby teams in Oceania include the Cook Islands, Niue, 
Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.[114] In North America a club 
formed in Montreal in 1868, Canada's first club. The city of Montreal also 
played its part in the introduction of the sport in the United States, 
when students of McGill University played against a team from Harvard University 
in 1874.[14][103] Although the exact date of arrival of rugby union in 
Trinidad and Tobago is unknown, their first club Northern RFC was formed 
in 1923, a national team was playing by 1927 and due to a cancelled tour 
to British Guiana in 1933, switched their venue to Barbados; introducing 
rugby to the island.[115][116] Other Atlantic countries to play rugby union 
include Jamaica[117] and Bermuda.[118] The growth of rugby union in Europe 
outside the 6 Nations countries in terms of playing numbers has been sporadic. 
Historically, British and Irish home teams played the Southern Hemisphere 
teams of Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as France. The 
rest of Europe were let to play amongst themselves. During a period when 
it had been isolated by the British and Irish Unions, France, lacking international 
competition, became the only European team from the top tier to regularly 
play the other European countries; mainly Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, 
Spain, Romania, Poland, Italy and Czechoslovakia.[97][119] In 1934, instigated 
by the French Rugby Federation, FIRA (Fédération Internationale de Rugby 
Amateur) was formed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the 
IRFB.[97] The founding members were Italy, Romania, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Czechoslovakia, and Sweden. Other European rugby playing nations of note 
include Russia, whose first officially recorded match is marked by an encounter 
between Dynamo Moscow and the Moscow Institute of Physical Education in 
1933.[120] Rugby union in Portugal also took hold between the First and 
Second World Wars, with a Portuguese National XV set up in 1922 and an 
official championship started in 1927.[121] In 1999, FIRA agreed to place 
itself under the auspices of the IRB, transforming itself into a strictly 
European organising body. Accordingly, it changed its name to FIRA–AER 
(Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur – Association Européenne de 
Rugby). It adopted its current name of Rugby Europe in 2014. Although Argentina 
is the best-known rugby playing nation in South America, founding the Argentine 
Rugby Union in 1899,[122] several other countries on the continent have 
a long history. Rugby had been played in Brazil since the end of the 19th 
century, but the game was played regularly only from 1926, when São Paulo 
beat Santos in an inter-city match.[123] It took Uruguay several aborted 
attempts to adapt to rugby, led mainly by the efforts of the Montevideo 
Cricket Club; these efforts succeeded in 1951 with the formation of a national 
league and four clubs.[124] Other South American countries that formed 
a rugby union include Chile (1948),[125] and Paraguay (1968).[126] Many 
Asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby dating from the British 
Empire. India began playing rugby in the early 1870s, the Calcutta Football 
Club forming in 1873. However, with the departure of a local British army 
regiment, interest in rugby diminished in the area.[127] In 1878, The Calcutta 
Football Club was disbanded, and rugby in India faltered.[128] Sri Lanka 
claims to have founded their union in 1878, and although little official 
information from the period is available, the team won the All-India cup 
in Madras in 1920.[129] The first recorded match in Malaysia was in 1892, 
but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the HMS Malaya 
Cup which was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners 
of the Malay sevens.[130] Rugby union was introduced to Japan in 1899 by 
two Cambridge students: Ginnosuke Tanaka and Edward Bramwell Clarke.[131][132] 
The Japan RFU was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented 
with the news that Japan will host the 2019 World Cup.[133] It will be 
the first country outside the Commonwealth, Ireland and France to host 
the event, and this is viewed by the IRB as an opportunity for rugby union 
to extend its reach,[133] particularly in Asia. Other Asian playing countries 
of note include Singapore, South Korea, China and The Philippines, while 
the former British colony of Hong Kong is notable within rugby for its 
development of the rugby sevens game, especially the Hong Kong Sevens tournament 
which was founded in 1976.[134] Rugby in the Middle East and the Gulf States 
has its history in the 1950s, with clubs formed by British and French Services 
stationed in the region after the Second World War.[135] When these servicemen 
left, the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals, mostly 
Europeans, working in these countries. The official union of Oman was formed 
in 1971.[136] Bahrain founded its union a year later, while in 1975 the 
Dubai Sevens, the Gulf's leading rugby tournament, was created. Rugby remains 
a minority sport in the region with Israel, as of 2011, being the only 
member union from the Middle East to be included in the IRB World Rankings.[137] 
In 1875, rugby was introduced to South Africa by British soldiers garrisoned 
in Cape Town.[103] During the late 19th and early 20th century, the sport 
in Africa was spread by settlers and colonials who often adopted a "whites-only" 
policy to playing the game. This resulted in rugby being viewed as a bourgeois 
sport by the indigenous people with limited appeal.[138] The earliest countries 
to see the playing of competitive rugby include South Africa, and neighbouring 
Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe), which formed the Rhodesia Rugby Football 
Union in 1895.[139] In more recent times the sport has been embraced by 
several African nations. In the early 21st century Madagascar has experienced 
crowds of 40,000 at national matches,[140] while Namibia, whose history 
of rugby can be dated from 1915, have qualified for the final stages of 
the World Cup four times since 1999.[141] Other African nations to be represented 
in the World Rugby Rankings as Member Unions include Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, 
Uganda and Zambia.[137] South Africa and Kenya are among the 15 "core teams" 
that participate in every event of the men's Sevens World Series.[142] 
Records of women's rugby football date from the late 19th century, with 
the first documented source being Emily Valentine's writings, stating that 
she set up a rugby team in Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland 
in 1887.[143] Although there are reports of early women's matches in New 
Zealand and France, one of the first notable games to prove primary evidence 
was the 1917 war-time encounter between Cardiff Ladies and Newport Ladies; 
a photo of which shows the Cardiff team before the match at the Cardiff 
Arms Park.[144] In the past 30 years the game has grown in popularity among 
female athletes, and, according to WR, is now played in over 100 countries.[145] 
The English-based Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU), responsible for 
women's rugby in England, Scotland Ireland and Wales, was founded in 1983, 
and is the oldest formally organised national governing body for women's 
rugby.[146] This was replaced in 1994 by the Rugby Football Union for Women 
(RFUW) in England with each of the other Home Nations governing their own 
countries.[146] The premier international competition in rugby union for 
women is the Women's Rugby World Cup, first held in 1991.[147] Since 1994 
it has been held every four years.[147] The most important tournament in 
rugby union is the Rugby World Cup, a men's tournament that has taken place 
every four years since 1987 among national rugby union teams. New Zealand 
has won the Rugby World Cup the most (3 times) and is the current cup holder, 
winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup held at Twickenham, beating Australia 
in the final.[148][149] England (2003) were the first team from the Northern 
Hemisphere to win, the other champions being New Zealand (1987, 2011 and 
2015), Australia (1991 and 1999), and South Africa (1995 and 2007).[149] 
The Rugby World Cup has continued to grow since its inception in 1987.[150] 
The first tournament, in which 16 teams competed for the title, was broadcast 
to 17 countries with an accumulated total of 230 million television viewers.[150] 
Ticket sales during the pool stages and finals of the same tournament was 
less than a million.[150] The 2007 World Cup was contested by 94 countries 
with ticket sales of 3,850,000 over the pool and final stage.[150] The 
accumulated television audience for the event, then broadcast to 200 countries, 
was a claimed 4.2 billion.[150] Major international competitions are the 
Six Nations Championship and The Rugby Championship, held in Europe and 
the Southern Hemisphere respectively.[151] The Six Nations is an annual 
competition involving the European teams England, France, Ireland, Italy, 
Scotland and Wales.[152] Each country plays the other five once. After 
the initial internationals between England and Scotland, Ireland and Wales 
began competing in the 1880s, forming the Home International Championships.[152] 
France joined the tournament in the 1900s and in 1910 the term Five Nations 
first appeared.[152] However, the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, 
and Wales) excluded France in 1931 amid a run of poor results, allegations 
of professionalism and concerns over on-field violence.[153] France then 
rejoined in 1939–1940, though World War II halted proceedings for a further 
eight years.[152] France has played in all the tournaments since WWII, 
the first of which was played in 1947.[152] In 2000, Italy became the sixth 
nation in the contest and Rome's Stadio Olimpico has replaced Stadio Flaminio, 
as the venue for their home games since 2013.[154] The current Six Nations 
champions are England. The Rugby Championship is the Southern Hemisphere's 
annual international series for that region's top national teams. From 
its inception in 1996 through 2011, it was known as the Tri Nations, as 
it featured the hemisphere's traditional powers of Australia, New Zealand 
and South Africa.[155] These teams have dominated world rankings in recent 
years, and many considered the Tri Nations to be the toughest competition 
in international rugby.[156][157] The Tri Nations was initially played 
on a home and away basis with the three nations playing each other twice. 
In 2006 a new system was introduced where each nation plays the others 
three times, though in 2007 and 2011 the teams played each other only twice, 
as both were World Cup years.[155] Since Argentina's strong performances 
in the 2007 World Cup,[158] after the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, SANZAR 
(South Africa, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) invited the Argentine 
Rugby Union (UAR) to join an expanded Four Nations tournament in 2012.[159] 
The competition has been officially rechristened as The Rugby Championship 
beginning with the 2012 edition. The competition reverted to the Tri Nations' 
original home-and-away format, but now involving four teams. In World Cup 
years, an abbreviated tournament is held in which each team plays the others 
only once. New Zealand are the current champions, winning the 2016 title 
with two rounds to spare. Rugby union was played at the Olympic Games in 
1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924.[160] As per Olympic rules, the nations of Scotland, 
Wales and England were not allowed to play separately as they are not sovereign 
states. In 1900, France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 points to 
8 and defeating Germany 27 points to 17.[160] In 1908, Australia defeated 
Great Britain, claiming the gold medal, the score being 32 points to three.[160] 
In 1920, the United States, fielding a team with many players new to the 
sport of rugby, upset France in a shock win, eight points to zero. In 1924, 
the United States again defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team 
to win gold twice in the sport.[160] In 2009 the International Olympic 
Committee voted with a majority of 81 to 8 that rugby union be reinstated 
as an Olympic sport in at least the 2016 and 2020 games, but in the sevens, 
4-day tournament format.[37][161] This is something the rugby world has 
aspired to for a long time and Bernard Lapasset, president of the International 
Rugby Board, said the Olympic gold medal would be considered to be "the 
pinnacle of our sport" (Rugby Sevens).[162] Rugby sevens has been played 
at the Commonwealth Games since the 1998 Games in Kuala Lumpur.[163] The 
most gold medal holders are New Zealand who have won the competition on 
four successive occasions until South Africa beat them in 2014.[164] Rugby 
union has also been an Asian Games event since the 1998 games in Bangkok, 
Thailand. In the 1998 and 2002 editions of the games, both the usual fifteen-a-side 
variety and rugby sevens were played, but from 2006 onwards, only rugby 
sevens was retained. In 2010, the women's rugby sevens event was introduced. 
The event is likely to remain a permanent fixture of the Asian Games due 
to elevation of rugby sevens as an Olympic sport from the 2016 Olympics 
onwards. The present gold medal holders in the sevens tournament, held 
in 2010, are Japan in the male event and Kazakhstan in the women's.[165][166] 
Women's international rugby union began in 1982, with a match between France 
and Netherlands played in Utrecht.[167] As of 2009 over six hundred women's 
internationals have been played by over forty different nations.[168] The 
first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Wales in 1991, and was won by 
the United States.[147] The second tournament took place in 1994, and since 
that date the competition has been held every four years. The New Zealand 
Women's team then won four straight World Cups (1998, 2002, 2006, 2010)[169] 
before England won in 2014. As well as the Women's Rugby World Cup there 
are also other regular tournaments, including a Six Nations, run in parallel 
to the men's competition. The Women's Six Nations, first played in 1996 
has been dominated by England, who have won the tournament on 13 occasions, 
including a run of seven consecutive wins from 2006 to 2012. However, England 
have failed to win the tournament since; Ireland and France have alternated 
titles in the last four editions, with France as the current holders. Rugby 
union has been professionalized since 1995. The following table shows fully 
professional rugby competitions. (Semi-professional competitions are excluded). 
The game of rugby union has spawned several variants of the full-contact, 
15-a-side code. The two more common differences applied to the variants 
of the sport lie in either fewer players or reduced player contact. Of 
the variants, the oldest is Rugby sevens (7's, or VIIs), a fast-paced variant 
which originated in Melrose, Scotland in 1883. In rugby sevens, there are 
only seven players per side, and each half is normally seven minutes. Major 
tournaments include the Hong Kong Sevens and Dubai Sevens, both held in 
areas not normally associated with the highest levels of the 15-a-side 
game. A more recent variant of the sport is Rugby tens (10's or Xs), a 
Malaysian variant with ten players per side.[170] Due to the physical nature 
of playing rugby, several variants have been created to introduce the sport 
to children with a reduced level of physical contact.[171] Of these versions, 
Touch rugby, in which "tackles" are made by simply touching the ball carrier 
with two hands, is popular as a mixed sex version of the sport played by 
both children and adults.[172][173] Tag Rugby, is a version in which the 
participants wear a belt with two hook-and-loop fastener tags, the removal 
of either counting as a 'tackle'. Tag Rugby also varies in the fact that 
kicking the ball is not allowed.[174] Mini rugby is another variant of 
rugby union aimed at fostering the sport in children.[175][176] It is played 
with only eight players and on a smaller pitch.[175] Similar to Tag Rugby, 
American Flag Rugby, (AFR), is a mixed gender, non-contact imitation of 
rugby union designed for American children entering grades K-9.[177] Both 
American Flag Rugby and Mini Rugby differ to Tag Rugby in that they introduce 
more advanced elements of rugby union as the participants age.[175] Other 
less formal variants include beach rugby and snow rugby.[171][178] Rugby 
union football, and its immediate ancestor rugby football, has had a strong 
influence on several other sports. Most obviously rugby league which originally 
was formed as an administrative break from the English union before changing 
its laws, becoming a code in its own right. The two sports continue to 
influence each other to this day. The Gridiron codes, American football[179][180] 
and Canadian football,[181] are derived from early forms of rugby. Confusingly, 
in Canada, Canadian football has also frequently been referred to as "rugby 
football",[181] and a number of national and provincial bodies were called 
"Rugby Football Unions" or "Rugby Unions", such as the Ontario and Quebec 
Rugby Football Unions.[181] For example, in the Encyclopedia Canadiana, 
the entry Rugby Football begins by referring to "the Canadian development 
of rugby union or "English rugger" introduced into Canada in the third 
quarter of the nineteenth century", but later states that "the Canadian 
game is a radical departure from rugby union".[181] The primary influence 
on early Australian rules football was rugby football and other games originating 
in English public schools.[182][183] Tom Wills, who is recognised as the 
principal founder of Australian football, also attended Rugby School.[184] 
James Naismith took aspects of many sports including rugby to invent basketball.[185] 
The most obvious contribution is the jump ball's similarity to the line-out 
as well as the underhand shooting style that dominated the early years 
of the sport. Naismith played many years of rugby at McGill University.[186] 
Swedish football was a code whose rules were a mix of the association football 
rules and the rugby football rules. Some played the game with a round ball, 
while others played with an oval ball.[187] It is no longer played.[188] 
Rugby lends its name to wheelchair rugby (also known as "quad rugby" or 
"murderball"), and although the sport takes from wheelchair basketball, 
ice hockey and handball, it contains elements of rugby such as crossing 
a try line with the ball to score and the central theme of it being a full 
contact sport.[189] According to a 2011 report by the Centre for the International 
Business of Sport, over four and a half million people play rugby union 
or one of its variants organised by the IRB.[190] This is an increase of 
19 percent since the previous report in 2007.[191] The report also claimed 
that since 2007 participation has grown by 33 percent in Africa, 22 percent 
in South America and 18 percent in Asia and North America.[191] In 2014 
the IRB published a breakdown of the total number of players worldwide 
by national unions. It recorded a total of 6.6 million players globally, 
of those, 2.36 million were registered members playing for a club affiliated 
to their country's union.[2] The most capped international player from 
the tier 1 nations is former New Zealand openside flanker and captain Richie 
McCaw who has played in 148 internationals.[192] While the top scoring 
tier 1 international player is New Zealand's Dan Carter, who has amassed 
1442 points during his career.[193] In April 2010 Lithuania broke the record 
of consecutive international wins previously held by New Zealand and South 
Africa, which was 17 consecutive wins against tier 1 nations,[194] with 
their 18th win in tier 2 in a match against Serbia.[195] The highest scoring 
international match between two recognised unions was Hong Kong's 164–13 
victory over Singapore on 27 October 1994[196] While the largest winning 
margin of 152 points is held by two countries, Japan (a 155–3 win over 
Chinese Taipei) and Argentina (152–0 over Paraguay) both in 2002.[196] 
The record attendance for a rugby union game was set on 15 July 2000 in 
which New Zealand defeated Australia 39–35 in a Bledisloe Cup game at Stadium 
Australia in Sydney before 109,874 fans.[197] The record attendance for 
a match in Europe of 104,000 (at the time a world record) was set on 1 
March 1975 when Scotland defeated Wales 12–10 at Murrayfield in Edinburgh 
during the 1975 Five Nations Championship.[197] The record attendance for 
a domestic club match is 99,124, set when Racing 92 defeated Toulon in 
the 2016 Top 14 final on 24 June at Camp Nou in Barcelona. The match had 
been moved from its normal site of Stade de France near Paris due to scheduling 
conflicts with France's hosting of UEFA Euro 2016.[198] Thomas Hughes 1857 
novel Tom Brown's Schooldays, set at Rugby School, includes a rugby football 
match, also portrayed in the 1940s film of the same name. James Joyce mentions 
Irish team Bective Rangers in several of his works, including Ulysses (1922) 
and Finnegans Wake (1939), while his 1916 semi-autobiographical work A 
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man has an account of Ireland international 
James Magee.[199] Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in his 1924 Sherlock Holmes tale 
The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire, mentions that Dr Watson played rugby 
for Blackheath.[200] Henri Rousseau's 1908 work Joueurs de football shows 
two pairs of rugby players competing.[201] Other French artists to have 
represented the sport in their works include Albert Gleizes' Les Joueurs 
de football (1912), Robert Delaunay's Football. L'Équipe de Cardiff (1916) 
and André Lhote's Partie de Rugby (1917).[202] The 1928 Gold Medal for 
Art at the Antwerp Olympics was won by Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby for his 
work Rugby.[203] In film, Ealing Studios' 1949 comedy A Run for Your Money 
and the 1979 BBC Wales television film Grand Slam both centre on fans attending 
a match.[204] Films that explore the sport in more detail include independent 
production Old Scores (1991) and Forever Strong (2008). Invictus (2009), 
based on John Carlin's book Playing the Enemy, explores the events of the 
1995 Rugby World Cup and Nelson Mandela's attempt to use the sport to connect 
South Africa's people post-apartheid.[205][206] In public art and sculpture 
there are many works dedicated to the sport. There is a 27 ft bronze statue 
of a rugby line-out by pop artist Gerald Laing at Twickenham[207] and one 
of rugby administrator Sir Tasker Watkins at the Millennium Stadium.[208] 
Rugby players to have been honoured with statues include Gareth Edwards
