Weiser is a city in the rural western part of the U.S. state of Idaho and 
the county seat of Washington County.[4] With its mild climate, the city 
supports farm, orchard, and livestock endeavors in the vicinity. The city 
sits at the confluence of the Weiser River with the great Snake River, 
which marks the border with Oregon. The population was 5,507 at the 2010 
census.[5] Locals pronounce the city's name as "Wee-zer." The city was 
named after the nearby Weiser River, but exactly who that was named for 
is not precisely known. In one version it is for Peter M. Weiser, a soldier 
and member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806. Another has 
it for Jacob Weiser, a trapper-turned-miner who struck it rich in Baboon 
Gulch in the Florence Basin of Idaho in 1861. William Logan and his wife 
settled in the vicinity of Weiser in 1863 building a roadhouse in anticipation 
of the opening of Olds Ferry west of them on the Snake River across from 
Farewell Bend. In 1863, Reuben Olds acquired a franchise from the Territorial 
Legislature and began operating Olds Ferry.[6] Olds ferry business did 
well (as did Logan's) as it diverted much of the traffic from the old Snake 
River crossing point at Old Fort Boise. Increasing settlement on the Weiser 
River valley increased Weiser's population. A post office was established 
in 1866 as Weiser Ranch. In 1871, it was renamed Weiser.[7] Weiser reached 
its height of prosperity when a railroad way station was established and 
it became a transportation hub for travelers. Its history is well represented 
by the great number of original buildings from the 1890s and early 1900s 
that are on the National Register of Historic Places. During the 1890s, 
the city had pretensions of becoming a major regional market and transportation 
center. The Idaho Northern Railroad was built up the Weiser River with 
the intention of reaching Lewiston and river transportation to the ocean. 
The dream ended among the lumber mills of central Idaho almost at the community 
of Meadows... not needing to actually go past the stock loading and lumber 
ponds outside the village, the terminus station was built there and a new 
city, New Meadows, came into being. Likewise the Union Pacific, after taking 
over the Oregon Short Line chose not to locate its major section yards 
in the flats west of Weiser—probably due to inflated prices asked by land 
speculators—and built at Huntington, Oregon at the western edge of the 
Snake River valley. Legendary Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson played 
semi-pro baseball for the Weiser Kids as a young man in 1906–1907. After 
high school in Fullerton, California, the "Big Train" was lured to Weiser 
to play baseball and work for the local telephone company. While in Weiser, 
he once pitched 84 consecutive scoreless innings. His skills attracted 
a scout from the Washington Nationals (later Senators) and in July 1907 
he departed Idaho for the major leagues at age nineteen.[8] U.S. Route 
95 runs through the city, connecting to Oregon and British Columbia. Weiser 
bills itself as the "Fiddling Capital of the World" and the National Oldtime 
Fiddlers' Contest has been held each year since 1953. Fiddling contests 
have been held in Weiser since 1914, but the present festival was the idea 
of Blaine Stubblefield, a fiddler and folk music collector, and the head 
of the city's chamber of commerce.[9] The festival is held at the beginning 
of summer, during the third full week in June, the only exception occurring 
during leap years when it is held on the 4th week of the month. It draws 
national media coverage and over 7,000 people to the Weiser area. The city 
has been consistently served by the Weiser Signal-American, the local weekly 
newspaper. For many years Weiser's location as the last city upriver from 
Hells Canyon made it the jump-off point for wilderness tours by powered 
rubber raft down the gorge. Enormous sturgeon and plentiful salmon were 
a draw for anglers. The salmon runs ended not long after the float tours 
with the blocking of the river by three hydro-power dams built by Idaho 
Power Company starting in the 1950s. Weiser is located at 44°14′59″N 116°58′4″W﻿
