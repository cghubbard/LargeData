The Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League (PGCBL) is a 13-team collegiate 
summer baseball league founded in 2010. All players in the league must 
have NCAA eligibility remaining in order to participate. Players are not 
paid so as to maintain their college eligibility. Each team plays an eight-week, 
50 game schedule from June to August with playoffs in early August. The 
league's level of play, while amateur, is considered to be comparable to 
the professional short season leagues.[1] The Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball 
League was founded in the fall of 2010 when seven New York Collegiate Baseball 
League teams left that league. For an even number a new team was placed 
in Newark, New York. The league is in conjunction with Perfect Game USA, 
baseball's largest scouting service. The eight founding members of the 
PGCBL were the Albany Dutchmen, Amsterdam Mohawks, Cooperstown Hawkeyes, 
Elmira Pioneers, Glens Falls Dragons Mohawk Valley DiamondDawgs, Newark 
Pilots and Watertown Wizards. The league's first season was completed in 
the summer of 2011. The eight teams were broken down into two divisions, 
PGCBL East and PGCBL West. The East comprised Albany, Amsterdam, Glens 
Falls and Mohawk Valley. The West was made up of Cooperstown, Elmira, Newark 
and Watertown. Glens Falls and Cooperstown were the regular season division 
champions in the PGCBL East and West respectively. Glens Falls, Cooperstown, 
Amsterdam and Newark qualified for the league playoffs. Newark defeated 
Amsterdam, two games to one, to win the very first PGCBL championship. 
In 2012, the league expanded to nine teams with the addition of the Oneonta 
Outlaws. The two-division format was replaced by a single nine-team division 
with the top four teams in the league regular season standings qualifying 
for the playoffs. Amsterdam won 35 of 47 regular season games and captured 
the regular season championship. Amsterdam, Glens Falls, Newark and Mohawk 
Valley qualified for the postseason. Amsterdam swept Glens Falls to win 
its first league title. The Mohawks finished the summer ranked third nationally 
in Perfect Game's Summer Top 30 poll. The 2013 season saw a return of the 
two-division format as 10 teams were broken into East and West divisions. 
Albany, Cooperstown, Glens Falls, Mohawk Valley and defending champion 
Amsterdam constituted the East while newcomers Adirondack and Utica joined 
Elmira, Newark and Watertown in the West. A new playoff format featuring 
six teams was instituted as the first and second-place finishers in each 
division were joined for the first time by the third-place finishing team 
- this led to a down-to-wire playoff chase where the sixth and final playoff 
spot was not decided until the final night of the regular season. Amsterdam 
and Watertown overcame slow starts to win division titles; each team captured 
its first division title in the PGCBL. Albany, Mohawk Valley, Elmira and 
Newark rounded out the playoff field. Three seeds Albany and Elmira each 
won opening round playoff games over second-seeded Mohawk Valley and Newark 
respectively to advance to the divisional finals against Amsterdam and 
Watertown. Amsterdam edged out Albany and Elmira in back-to-back Game 3's 
to become the first repeat champion in league history. 2011- Newark Pilots
