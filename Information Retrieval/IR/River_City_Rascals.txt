The River City Rascals are a professional baseball team based in O'Fallon, 
Missouri, in the United States. The Rascals are a member of the West Division 
of the Frontier League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball. 
From the 1999 season to the present, the Rascals have played their home 
games at CarShield Field. The franchise began in 1993 as one of the original 
six teams of the independent Frontier League in 1993 with teams from Ohio, 
Kentucky, and West Virginia.[1] The Greys played in Zanesville, Ohio, at 
Gant Municipal Stadium, a historic 4,000-seat multipurpose stadium built 
in 1940. The Greys were the first professional baseball team to play in 
Zanesville since 1950 and the Zanesville Indians.[2] The Greys won both 
halves of the 1993 season and defeated the Ohio Valley Redcoats in the 
playoffs to become the first champions of the Frontier League.[3] Zanesville 
had five players hit over .300 as well as solid pitching; Kyle Shade was 
named Frontier League MVP and Tom Crowley was named Most Valuable Pitcher. 
The Greys also led the league in attendance with an average of 1,000 fans 
per game.[3] Despite a 35-28 record in the 1994 season, the team finished 
in third place in the North Division behind Ohio Valley and Erie Sailors.[3] 
The team returned to the playoffs in 1995 after a season characterized 
by solid pitching and baserunning. Despite only recording 12 home runs, 
the Greys led the league with 137 stolen bases.[3] Zanesville swept the 
Newark Buffaloes two games to none in the Division Championship Series 
before falling to the Johnstown Steal in the Frontier League Championship 
Series.[3] Closing pitcher, Don Wolfe was named League MVP and Playoff 
MVP in 1995. Wolfe had a league-leading 21 saves during the 1995 season.[3] 
Zanesville pitching was again strong in the 1996 season. The Greys were 
led by Matt Baxter with a 9-2 record and 2.47 ERA while the bullpen was 
led by Terry Pearson, who recorded 20 saves and a .50 ERA and stuck out 
43 batters in 36 innings while only walking eight batters for the entire 
season.[3] Pitching was not enough to make the playoffs and the team finished 
third in the FL East Division.[3] Although the team had a winning record 
in each of the three seasons in Zanesville, the franchise fell into financial 
trouble. This was partially due to the Greys' market being one of the smallest 
in the league with a population around 25,000.[3] The franchise was inactive 
during the 1997 and 1998 seasons. On Tuesday, October 27, 1998, O'Fallon 
Mayor Paul Renaud announced the new name of the team to be the "River City 
Rascals."[4] Initial ownership of the Rascals consisted of a local group 
headed by Ken Wilson.[3][5] The Rascals began play in 1999 in the Western 
Division of the Frontier League under manager Jack Clark, pitching coach 
Greg Mathews, and first-base coach Dick Schofield Jr., all previous Major 
League Baseball players. .[6] The first game played was on Wednesday, June 
2, 1999 on the road against the Cook County Cheetahs of Crestwood, Illinois. 
Pitcher Joey Pipes pitched a complete game in losing by a score of 1-0.[7] 
The first home game was played on Tuesday, June 8, 1999 at T.R. Hughes 
Ballpark at the Ozzie Smith Sports Complex in front of an overflow crowd 
of 4,173 (3,500 seat capacity). The Rascals beat the Dubois County Dragons 
by a score of 6-5 by rallying from a 5-1 deficit with William Black scoring 
on Tim Still's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth inning.[8] This 
was the first minor league baseball game in Missouri since 1955. Under 
Clark, a former St. Louis Cardinals slugger,[9] the team led the Frontier 
League in home runs, however only two pitchers had ERAs under 5.00.[6] 
The move of the franchise from Zanesville to O'Fallon saw a major increase 
in attendance. The team averaged more than 150,000 fans in 1999 and set 
new franchise records in 2000 and again in 2002. The Rascals were named 
Frontier League Organization of the Year in 1999 and 2000; and Pat Daly 
was named Executive of the Year in 1999 followed by Matt Jones in 2002.[6] 
Clark left after the 1999 season to join the Los Angeles Dodgers as a hitting 
coach.[10] He was replaced by Neil Fiala, who led the team to a West Division 
title in 2000 before losing in the first round of the playoffs to the Evansville 
Otters.[6] The team just missed making the playoffs again in 2001, being 
eliminated on the last day of the season. The season was highlighted by 
outfielder Mike Robertson's 30-game hitting before being signed by the 
Boston Red Sox organization.[6] Fiala resigned after the 2002 season and 
was replaced by former major-league catcher Marc Hill.[6] Hill resigned 
after underperforming in the first half of the 2003 season and was replaced 
midseason pitching coach Randy Martz.[6] Former pitcher Josh Kinney who 
played for the Rascals in 2001 (21 innings, 18 strikeouts, 1.71 ERA) became 
the first Rascal player, and second in franchise history, to make it to 
the Major Leagues. His contract was purchased from the Memphis Redbirds 
on July 2, 2006 by the St. Louis Cardinals where he appeared out of the 
bullpen during the 2006 regular season. His first major league pitch (July 
3, 2006) was hit for a home run by Atlanta Braves left fielder Ryan Langerhans; 
Kinney finished the 2006 season winning a championship ring with the Cardinals 
as 2006 World Series Champions. Following the 2006 season the franchise 
was acquired by the group PS and J Professional Baseball Club, LLC headed 
by Steve Malliet, an experienced minor league executive in both affiliated 
and independent baseball.[11] After declining attendance and a number of 
seasons without a winning record Malliet hired former Cincinnati Reds farmhand 
Toby Rumfield as the Rascals' manager for the 2007 season.[6][12] Rumfield 
began remaking the team, with only a few players from the 2006 remaining 
on the roster. The rebuilding was not immediate and the team finished with 
a record of 36-60.[6] The 2007 Rascals finished last in the league in both 
fielding and pitching and offense suffered after the team lost first baseman 
Bobby Mosby in a trade to the Northern League and outfielder Phil Laurent, 
who was signed by the San Diego Padres.[6] Under Rumfield, pitching improved 
in 2008 and closer Mike Benacka recorded 13 saves and a 0.35 ERA in 22 
games before signing with Oakland Athletics halfway through the season.[6] 
The Rascals finished 4th in the West Division with a record of 47-49. Despite 
the improvement from 2006 Rumfield was replaced by Chad Parker, who previously 
managed the Macon Music of the South Coast League.[6] Parker continued 
the rebuilding process and focused on adding speed and strengthen pitching.[6] 
Under Parker, seven players reached double figures in steals, led by OF 
Scott Houin with 35.[6] Offense was led by Chad Maddox (.307) and Ryan 
Wehrle (.317), and in August, Frontier League all-star Ernie Banks was 
acquired from the Washington Wild Things and hit .353 on the season.[6] 
The Rascals clinched a division title late in the regular season, marking 
the first time since 2000.[6] In the first round of the playoffs the team 
defeated the Windy City ThunderBolts, the first playoff series win since 
1995 in Zanesville. In the Frontier League Championship Series the Rascals 
won the first two games of the series before Lake Erie Crushers rallied 
with three straight wins.[6][13] The Rascals ended the 2009 season with 
a franchise record 56 wins and Parker was named Frontier League Coach of 
the Year.[6] Parker resigned following the season and was replaced by former 
River City pitcher Steve Brook. Brook continued the rebuilding from Parker 
and the team finished second in the West Division.[6] The team won the 
first round playoff series against the Southern Illinois Miners and entered 
the Frontier League Championship Series for the second straight season, 
a first in franchise history. The Rascals defeated the Traverse City Beach 
Bums in four games and won the franchise's second championship and first 
as the Rascals.[14] In 2013, the Rascals and the City of O'Fallon, Missouri 
came to an agreement to extend their lease at TR Hughes Ballpark through 
the 2022 season.[15] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches
