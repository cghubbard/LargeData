The 1924 Colored World Series was a best-of-nine match-up between the Negro 
National League champion Kansas City Monarchs and the Eastern Colored League 
champion Hilldale. In a ten-game series, the Monarchs narrowly defeated 
Hilldale 5 games to 4, with one tie game. It was the first World Series 
between the respective champions of the NNL and ECL. It was the second 
year of existence for the ECL, but no agreement could be reached in 1923 
for a post-season series, owing primarily to unresolved disputes between 
the leagues. Five members of the Baseball Hall of Fame participated in 
the series: Biz Mackey, Judy Johnson, and Louis Santop played for Hilldale, 
while Bullet Rogan and José Méndez played for the Monarchs. In addition, 
Monarchs owner J. L. Wilkinson was also inducted into the Hall. October

third and the Monarchs leading 3-0, and shut them out the rest of the game. 
Hilldale tied the game in the third on two base hits, a walk, and three 
steals, including Otto Briggs’ steal of home. Two walks and two errors 
helped score Hilldale's winning run with none out in the ninth. October
