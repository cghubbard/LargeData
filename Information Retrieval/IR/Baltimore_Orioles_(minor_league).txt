The city of Baltimore, Maryland has been home to two minor league baseball 
teams called the "Baltimore Orioles", besides the four major league baseball 
teams, (the American Association in 1882–1891, the National League in the 
1890s and the so-called "up-start" American League charter franchise of 
two seasons 1901–1902, and the current American League's modern team of 
the Baltimore Orioles since April 1954). "Orioles" is a traditional name 
for baseball clubs in Baltimore (after the state bird of Maryland, with 
the colors of black and orange/gold/yellow). It was used by major league 
teams representing the port city from 1882 through 1899 in the old American 
Association and the original National League two decades after its founding 
in 1876, and by a charter team franchise member of the new American League 
from 1901 through 1902. The American League franchise was later shifted 
against the city's will to New York City with former famous player and 
now owner/manager John McGraw in 1903 and renamed the New York Highlanders, 
which later became the modern New York Yankees, a decade later (in order 
to give the new A.L. "bragging rights" by also having a team in the "Big 
Apple" versus the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers). Their string 
of championships and hall-of-fame roster of players began in the "Roaring 
Twenties", some baseballers say with the trading of the now famous "Babe 
Ruth", the "Bambino", and "Sultan of Swat", George Herman Ruth of southwest 
Baltimore, (formerly briefly with the old, now minor league Orioles of 
the International League with owner/manager Jack Dunn (1878–1928) in 1914, 
then traded later in the season to the Boston Red Sox because of new Federal 
League competition from the neighboring Baltimore Terrapins) now from the 
also financially pressed Red Sox team in 1919 to the New York Yankees. 
Since 1923, the Yankees have compiled 27 World Series championships (with 
the St. Louis Cardinals being second, having won 11 between 1926 and 2011), 
and the 1980s are the only decade so far in which they have failed to win 
at least one title. In 1903, an Oriole minor league team joined the Eastern 
League (renamed the International League in 1911, and not to be confused 
with the present day 'Double AA' level, minor league Eastern League). This 
Orioles team stayed mediocre for the first few years of its existence, 
but after the arrival of Jack Dunn (1872–1928), as manager, it won the 
Eastern League pennant in 1908. This E.L./I.L. Orioles team played at the 
old American League Park (aka as Oriole Park) at the southwest corner of 
Greenmount Avenue and 29th Street in the Waverly neighborhood of northeast 
Baltimore. The 1914 season featured the professional debut of local son, 
George Herman Ruth ("Babe Ruth"), but competition from the Baltimore Terrapins 
of the new Federal League challenge for major league status, with their 
more modern steel-beamed ballpark across the street, forced Dunn to sell 
Ruth (to the Boston Red Sox) later in the 1914 season and many of his other 
players, and eventually temporarily relocate the team to Richmond, Virginia 
(eventually becoming the present-day Syracuse Chiefs, still playing in 
the I.L.). After the Federal League's demise, Dunn returned with an Orioles 
team in 1916. This team, later in the 1919 I.L. Baseball Season won the 
International League pennant with 100 victories, the first team to win 
that many games and went on a championship spree, seldom seen in major 
or minor league baseball ever since. Featuring another future Hall-of-Fame 
pitcher in Lefty Grove, the Orioles improved on that in 1920 by winning 
110 games, including the last 25 of the season. In 1921, the Orioles won 
27 straight games (a record for consecutive victories by a minor league 
team that would stand until the Salt Lake City team of the western Pioneer 
League won 29 in 1987). The Orioles won the League by 20 games over the 
second place team, and had a home record of 70 wins and 18 losses. Despite 
their impressive record, however, they lost the "Little World Series" to 
the American Association's champion Louisville Colonels, 4 games to 1. 
The Orioles actually led the fourth game, 12–4, but a riot broke out among 
the Baltimore home crowd in the top of the 9th inning, and the game was 
forfeited to Louisville, 9 runs to 0, reflecting Baltimore's alternate 
home-town controversial nickname of the 19th Century, "Mobtown". The I.L. 
Orioles continued to roll over International League opposition for several 
more seasons straight through to the 1925 Baseball Season. The team entered 
the Governors' Cup playoffs in the International circuit in 1936, 1937, 
and 1940, but did not win another pennant until the "war year" of 1944. 
The team was leading the League on July 4 of that year, when their home 
wooden and steel beamed stadium, Oriole Park (formerly Terrapin Park of 
1914), burned down. Even after relocating several blocks northwest to the 
old 1922 football bowl of Municipal Stadium on 33rd Street Boulevard (also 
known as "Baltimore Stadium"), the team seemed to have a hard time recovering 
from that loss, playing lackluster ball through the rest of the season 
and losing their last game, only to strangely "back into the championship" 
when the second place team, the Newark Bears, also lost their recent games. 
The Orioles, under manager Alphonse "Tommy" Thomas, went on to win the 
"Junior World Series" that year, four games to two, against Louisville. 
Six years later, with the shackles of war-time baseball cast off, in 1950, 
under manager Nick Cullop, Baltimore won the league championship again, 
only to lose the "Junior World Series" to the Columbus Red Birds of Ohio, 
four games to one. After the 1953 season, the St. Louis Browns moved to 
Baltimore and took the name of the Baltimore Orioles. The last minor league/International 
League Orioles team (of 1916–1953), re-located to Richmond (coincidentally 
just as had the earlier Orioles team in 1914), this time as the Richmond 
Virginians from 1954–64, later relocating as today's Toledo Mud Hens franchise 
in northwest Ohio since 1965. The St. Louis Browns are one of two franchises 
with the same nickname to move to Baltimore, with the other being the first 
Cleveland Browns team that became the Ravens in 1996; however, a new Browns 
team was formed in 1999. The Orioles won the Governors' Cup, the championship 
of the IL, 2 times, and played in the championship games "Little World
