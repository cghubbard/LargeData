Jason Alan Grimsley (born August 7, 1967) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. Like many relief pitchers, Grimsley began his career as 
a starting pitcher, but he became a full-time reliever while a member of 
the Yankees. Grimsley began his career in 1989 and pitched very poorly, 
surrendering 13 runs in 18 1⁄3 innings. The following year, he went 3–2 
and made 11starts. In 1991, he went 1–7 with a 4.87 ERA in 12 starts. Following 
the 1991 season, he was traded to the Houston Astros for Curt Schilling. 
He spent the entire 1992 season in the minors and on March 30, 1993 he 
was released by Houston and signed with the Cleveland Indians. In his first 
season with Cleveland, he went 3–4 over 10 games, and in 1994, went 5–2 
with a 4.57 ERA in 14 games. Grimsley is known for his leading role in 
the 1994 Bat Burglary involving Albert Belle and an allegedly corked bat 
that was taken away by umpires for examination by the league. Grimsley 
was the player who crawled through a Comiskey Park air conditioning duct 
to reach the room where the confiscated bat had been secured. He took the 
corked bat and replaced it with a clean bat. The incident made ESPN.com's 
"Biggest Cheaters in Baseball" list at number 4[1] and Foxsports.com list 
of the biggest cheaters in baseball history at #5.[citation needed] The 
next season, he was used mostly as a reliever, making only two starts. 
Following the season, on February 14, 1996 he was traded to the Angels. 
Grimsley went 5–7 with a 6.84 ERA in 1996 while making a career-high 20 
starts.[2] On October 8, he was granted free agency. Grimsley signed with 
the Tigers on January 17, 1997, but was released following spring training. 
On April 3, he signed with the Brewers and on July 29, was traded to the 
Royals for Jamie Brewington. He was granted free agency on October 15. 
On January 8, 1998, he was signed with the Cleveland Indians. He did not 
appear in a major league game that year and was granted free agency on 
October 15. Grimsley signed with the Yankees on January 26, 1999. With 
the Yankees, he rebounded, going 7–2 with a 3.60 ERA in 55 relief outings, 
25 as a closer, but earned only one save. Grimsley did not pitch in the 
1999 American League Division Series or the 1999 American League Championship 
Series, but pitched 2 and 1/3 innings of two-hit, two-walk ball in the 
1999 World Series. In 2000, he was 3–2 with a 5.04 ERA. In the 2000 ALCS, 
he pitched one scoreless inning and earned his second World Series ring 
when the Yankees defeated the Mets in five games despite not pitching in 
the World Series. On November 20, he was released by the Yankees.[2] Grimsley 
signed with the Royals on January 19, 2001. In his first season in Kansas 
City he was 1–5. In three and a half years in Kansas City, he never posted 
a record better than .500 (he was 3–3 in 2004). He was 1–5 in 2001, 4–7 
in 2002, and 2–6 in 2003. Grimsley also gave up the famous home run to 
Scott Hatteberg that gave the Oakland Athletics their 20th straight win 
in 2002, as immortalized in the film Moneyball. On October 29, 2003, he 
was granted free agency, but re-signed on December 7. In 2004, he went 
3–3 with a 3.38 ERA before being traded on June 21 to the Orioles for Denny 
Bautista. Grimsley went 2–4 in 2004 with Baltimore. In 2005, he posted 
a dismal 1–3 record with a 5.73 ERA, and was granted free agency on October 
27. In 2006, he was 1–2 with a slightly better 4.88 ERA in 19 games before 
being released on June 7. He subsequently retired. On June 6, 2006, it 
was reported that Federal officials had raided Grimsley's home looking 
for evidence that he was distributing human growth hormone (HGH) and other 
performance-enhancing drugs.[3] The Arizona Diamondbacks released him at 
his request, shortly after it became public in June 2006 that he had admitted 
to using performance-enhancing drugs.[4][5] The Diamondbacks announced 
they would not pay the rest of his 2006 salary, an estimated US$875,000. 
Grimsley's agent Joe Bick stated that Grimsley would contest the decision. 
Michael Weiner, general counsel to the players union stated that the union 
would file a grievance on his behalf.[6] On June 12, 2006, Grimsley was 
suspended for 50 games for violating Major League Baseball's Joint Drug 
Prevention and Treatment Program. This penalty would take effect if Grimsley 
ever signed a contract with a major league team and was placed on a 40-man 
roster.[7] He was the fourteenth Major League Baseball player to be suspended 
for use of performance-enhancing drugs. ESPN reported that court documents 
showed that Grimsley had failed an MLB-administered drug test in 2003; 
he subsequently confessed to the use of human growth hormones, amphetamines 
and steroids.[8] His drug use began in 1998 while in Buffalo, New York. 
After a nine-year MLB career, he was in the minors trying to get back to 
the majors after a shoulder injury. Among the drugs he has used are Deca-Durabolin, 
amphetamines, human growth hormone and Clenbuterol. Prior to the use of 
performance-enhancing drugs he had earned a total of $1 million; subsequently 
he earned $9 million. His ERA dropped by a run.[9] On September 30, 2006, 
the Los Angeles Times reported that Grimsley told federal agents investigating 
steroids in baseball that Houston Astros pitchers Roger Clemens and Andy 
Pettitte were users of performance-enhancing drugs and that Baltimore Orioles's 
Miguel Tejada, Jay Gibbons, and Brian Roberts were users of "anabolic steroids."[10] 
On October 3, 2006, the Washington Post reported that San Francisco United 
States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the Los Angeles Times report contained 
"significant inaccuracies."[11] All five players named (Clemens, Pettitte, 
Tejada, Gibbons, and Roberts) denounced the story, with Clemens calling 
it "dangerous and malicious and reckless." Gibbons was later implicated 
in the steroid scandal by Sports Illustrated, who uncovered receipts issued 
by a Florida steroid mail order company in his name.[11] On December 13, 
2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report, an investigation into the use 
of anabolic steroids and HGH in Major League Baseball.[12] On December 
20, 2007, the report was unsealed by a U.S. magistrate, who harshly criticized 
the L.A. Times for what he called "irresponsible reporting"...or "manufacturing 
of facts." Neither, Roberts, Clemens nor Pettitte's names were mentioned 
by Grimsley in any context whatsoever. The Times announced that it would 
publish a correction and apology for their misrepresentation of the facts.[13] 
Grimsley had told investigators that he got amphetamines, anabolic steroids 
and human growth hormone from someone recommended to him by former Yankees 
trainer Brian McNamee. The fact that McNamee was a personal strength coach 
for Clemens and Pettitte apparently prompted the Times to leap to the erroneous 
conclusion that Grimsley had implicated them in his statement.[13] The 
Tarkington Independent School District named the high school baseball field 
in his honor, being the school he graduated from. On January 21, 2005, 
a small plane crashed into the back of Grimsley's house in Overland Park, 
Kansas. Grimsley was not home at the time, but his wife, daughter, and 
nanny were; they escaped unharmed. The pilot and four passengers were killed.[14]
