Montgomery County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 
2010 census, the population was 50,219.[1] The county seat is Fonda.[2] 
The county was named in honor of Richard Montgomery, an American Revolutionary 
War general killed in 1775 at the Battle of Quebec. It was created in 1772 
as Tryon County and in 1784 was renamed Montgomery County.[3] Montgomery 
County comprises the Amsterdam, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area. The county 
borders the north and south banks of the Mohawk River. In 1784, following 
end of the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed 
to Montgomery County. This change was to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, 
who had captured several places in Canada and died in 1775 attempting to 
capture the city of Quebec during the Revolutionary War. It replaced the 
name formerly honoring the last provincial governor of New York. In 1789, 
Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The area split off from Montgomery 
County was much larger than the present county, as it also included the 
present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, 
Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne 
counties. In 1791, Herkimer, Otsego, and Tioga counties were split off 
from Montgomery. In 1802, portions of Clinton, Herkimer, and Montgomery 
counties were combined to form St. Lawrence County. In 1816, Hamilton County 
was split off from Montgomery. In 1838, Fulton County was split off from 
Montgomery. In 2012, Montgomery County voters approved a charter, making 
it the 21st county in New York to do so. In 2013, Matthew L. Ossenfort 
was elected the first County Executive in the county's history. Ossenfort 
took office in 2014, the same year the charter went into effect. Under 
the terms of the charter, the Board of Supervisors was replaced by a nine-member 
County Legislature, with members elected from single-member districts. 
Thomas L. Quackenbush was elected the first Chairman of the new Legislature. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 410 
square miles (1,100 km2), of which 403 square miles (1,040 km2) is land 
and 7.3 square miles (19 km2) (1.8%) is water.[4] Montgomery County is 
located in the central part of the state, west of the city of Schenectady 
and northwest of Albany. The Erie Canal runs through Montgomery County 
parallel to the Mohawk River, connecting to the Wood River to the west, 
which leads to Lake Ontario. Overall, the canal connected Great Lakes shipping 
with the Hudson River and the port of New York on the Atlantic Ocean. Several 
towns and villages developed along the canal, as it carried much trade 
and passenger traffic during its peak years. After the railroad was built 
through the state, along the same river plain, it superseded the canal, 
which was filled in some areas. At the time of the canal's construction, 
Montgomery County was the only place where there was a break in the Appalachian 
Mountains. Called 'The Noses' because of canal construction, it became 
known as "the gateway to the West". In the mid-twentieth century, the NYS 
Thruway was constructed parallel to the former east-west routes of the 
canal and railroad. Today the Erie Canal and its lock system is used primarily 
for recreational boat use among locals and tourists. Montgomery County 
is located in the heart of the state's Mohawk Valley region. Foothills 
of the Catskill Mountains dot the southern part of the county, while foothills 
of the Adirondack Mountains dot the north. As of the census[10] of 2010,

Montgomery County lies in New York's 19th Congressional District, while 
the Eastern half lies in New York's 20th Congressional District, the latter 
of which is represented in Congress by Paul Tonko, a lifelong resident 
of Amsterdam. While Democrats have been elected to local office, Republican 
candidates have a +5 margin in Presidential elections. In 2012, voters 
approved a county charter under New York's municipal home rule law which 
established an independent county executive to head its executive branch 
and replacing the board of supervisors with a nine seat county legislature.[11]
