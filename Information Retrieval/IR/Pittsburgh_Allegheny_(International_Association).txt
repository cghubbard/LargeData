Pittsburgh Allegheny was the name of the first professional baseball club 
to represent Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The team was an unrelated forerunner 
to the American Association's Pittsburgh Alleghenies that were established 
in 1882, and later became the modern-day Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] Following 
the American Civil War, the leading baseball clubs in Pittsburgh were the 
"Enterprise", "Olympic", and "Xantha" teams. They played at Union Park, 
was located in the city of Allegheny, before it became annexed into Pittsburgh 
in 1907.[2] On February 2, 1876, Pittsburgh lost its bid for a franchise 
in the newly established National League. Twenty days later, several local 
organizers formed the Allegheny Base Ball Club.[3] Allegheny played their 
first game, defeating the Xanthas 7-3 at Union Park on April 15, 1876.[2] 
On February 20, 1877 the International Association was founded in Pittsburgh, 
and consisted of seven teams that played within Canada and the United States. 
It is probably the first minor league in baseball history.[4] On February 
22, 1877, after a year of playing as an independent club, Allegheny officially 
joined the new league.[2] The club paid a $25 ($556.00 in 2016 dollars[5]) 
entry fee and joined the new league.[3] The Allegheny would finish the 
season with a 13-6 record, the second best winning percentage in the league.[4] 
The club consisted of twelve players in 1877, all of which later made it 
the majors. No other team in the league used so few players or had a total 
progression rate to the majors. The manager of the team was Denny McKnight, 
a lifelong Pittsburgh native who later went on to manage the major league 
Alleghenies 1884 season for 110 games.[4] McKnight also served as the International 
Association's president after Candy Cummings resigned.[6] Allegheny did 
make two historic firsts in their brief history. On June 2, 1877 Allegheny 
played in the very first professional game to be decided in 19-innings. 
That day the club was defeated by a club representing Memphis, Tennessee 
and the League Alliance. Later that month on June 20, 1877 Allegheny tied 
a club representing Indianapolis and the League Alliance, 2-2, in the first 
game to be decided in 17-innings.[7] The league existed for the 1878 season 
and while none of the players returned to the team, the roster did include 
future Pittsburgh Alleghenys players; Chappy Lane and George Strief, who 
would later hit the very first home run in the history of the Pirates franchise. 
Jack Glasscock, who played shortstop for the 1893-94 Pirates received his 
start with International Association's Allegheny club as did an 18-year-old 
pitcher, Mickey Welch. He would go on to win 307 major league games and 
gain induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[4] Despite gaining membership 
to the International League the following season, the club folded in 1878, 
unable to compete with the strong, local independent squads like the East 
Liberty Stars or the Olympics, which were better-rooted in the Pittsburgh 
neighborhoods and workplaces.[1] Despite a rule prohibiting "a person leaving 
one club and joining another without proper release" Allegheny was hit 
hard with player defections and formally folded on June 8, 1878, posting 
a dismal 3-23 record.[3] Having no official nickname, the Allegheny team 
was commonly referred to by its pluralized city name, i.e., the Alleghenys 
or Alleghenies.[1][8][9][10][11] (from Baseball Reference Bullpen) Fielders
