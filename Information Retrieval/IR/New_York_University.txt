-73.99500 New York University (NYU) is a private nonprofit nonsectarian 
research university based in New York City.[1][12][13] Founded in 1831, 
NYU is considered one of the world’s most influential and foremost research 
universities.[14][15] University rankings compiled by U.S. News & World 
Report, Times Higher Education and the Academic Ranking of World Universities 
all rank NYU among the top 32 universities in the world.[16][17][18] NYU 
is organized into more than 20 schools, colleges, and institutes,[12] located 
in six centers throughout Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn. NYU's main campus 
is located at Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan with institutes and 
centers on the Upper East Side, academic buildings and dorms down on Wall 
Street, and the Brooklyn campus located at MetroTech Center in Downtown 
Brooklyn.[19] The university also established NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai 
and maintains 11 other Global Academic Centers in Accra, Berlin, Buenos 
Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Sydney, Tel Aviv; and Washington, 
D.C.[20] NYU enrolls approximately 25,500 undergraduate and 24,000 post-graduate 
students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, 
including 183 foreign countries.[21] NYU was elected to the Association 
of American Universities in 1950.[22] NYU counts 35 Nobel Prize winners, 
four Abel Prize winners, four Turing Award winners, four Fields Medal winners, 
over 30 National Medals for Science, Technology and Innovation, Arts and 
Humanities recipients, over 30 Pulitzer Prize winners, over 30 Academy 
Award winners, several Russ Prize, Gordon Prize, Draper Prize, and Wolf 
Prize winners, numerous Emmy, Grammy, Lasker and Tony Award winners, many 
MacArthur, Sloan and Guggenheim Fellowship holders, as well as hundreds 
of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and American 
Academy of Arts and Sciences members among its faculty and alumni. NYU 
also has many Fulbright, Marshall, Rhodes, Mitchell, Truman and Gates Scholars, 
and a plethora of members of the United States Congress and United States 
Cabinet officials, Chief Judges, Chief Justices, governors, mayors, high-ranking 
diplomats, ministers, royalty, heads of state or government, scholars in 
academia, eminent mathematicians, scientists and inventors, literary and 
media figures, professional athletes, Olympic medalists, astronauts, two 
FBI Directors, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and three judges 
of the International Court of Justice among its graduates. The alumni of 
NYU are among the wealthiest in the world, and include many leaders and 
founders of Fortune 500 companies, and 17 living billionaires.[23][24][25][26] 
NYU's sports teams are called the Violets, the colors being the trademarked 
hue "NYU Violet" and white; the school mascot is the bobcat. Almost all 
sporting teams participate in the NCAA's Division III and the University 
Athletic Association. Albert Gallatin, Secretary of Treasury under Thomas 
Jefferson and James Madison, declared his intention to establish "in this 
immense and fast-growing city ... a system of rational and practical education 
fitting for all and graciously opened to all".[1] A three-day-long "literary 
and scientific convention" held in City Hall in 1830 and attended by over 
100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a new university. These New 
Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who 
would be admitted based upon merit rather than birthright, status, or social 
class. On April 18, 1831, an institution was established, with the support 
of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's landed 
class of merchants, bankers, and traders.[27] Albert Gallatin was elected 
as the institution's first president.[28] On April 21, 1831, the new institution 
received its charter and was incorporated as the University of the City 
of New York by the New York State Legislature; older documents often refer 
to it by that name. The university has been popularly known as New York 
University since its beginning and was officially renamed New York University 
in 1896.[28] In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four-story 
Clinton Hall, situated near City Hall.[28] In 1835, the School of Law, 
NYU's first professional school, was established. Although the impetus 
to found a new school was partly a reaction by evangelical Presbyterians 
to what they perceived as the Episcopalianism of Columbia College,[29] 
NYU was created non-denominational, unlike many American colleges at the 
time.[28] American Chemical Society was founded in 1876 at NYU. It became 
one of the nation's largest universities, with an enrollment of 9,300 in 
1917.[30] NYU had its Washington Square campus since its founding. The 
university purchased a campus at University Heights in the Bronx because 
of overcrowding on the old campus. NYU also had a desire to follow New 
York City's development further uptown. NYU's move to the Bronx occurred 
in 1894, spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor Henry Mitchell MacCracken.[28] 
The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor 
was. As a result, most of the university's operations along with the undergraduate 
College of Arts and Science and School of Engineering were housed there. 
NYU's administrative operations were moved to the new campus, but the graduate 
schools of the university remained at Washington Square.[31] In 1914, Washington 
Square College was founded as the downtown undergraduate college of NYU. 
In 1935, NYU opened the "Nassau College-Hofstra Memorial of New York University 
at Hempstead, Long Island". This extension would later become a fully independent 
Hofstra University.[32] In 1950, NYU was elected to the Association of 
American Universities, a nonprofit organization of leading public and private 
research universities.[22][33] In the late 1960s and early 1970s, financial 
crisis gripped the New York City government and the troubles spread to 
the city's institutions, including NYU.[34] Feeling the pressures of imminent 
bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated the sale of 
the University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which 
occurred in 1973.[35] In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering 
and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn,[36] which eventually 
merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. 
After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington 
Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President John Brademas,[37] 
NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on 
updating facilities.[38] The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, 
but ended up being completed in 10.[39] In 2003 President John Sexton launched 
a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and 
financial aid resources.[40] In 2009, the university responded to a series 
of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its 
fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for 
Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some 
conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university 
were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. 
The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker 
passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms 
where workers had to sleep under beds. According to the article, workers 
who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly 
arrested.[41] The university responded the day of the article with an apology 
to the workers.[42] Another report was published and it maintains that 
those who were on strike were arrested by police who then promptly abused 
them in a police station. Many of those who were not local were then deported 
to their country.[43] In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers 
on its Abu Dhabi complex.[44] NYU was the founding member of the League 
of World Universities, an international organization consisting of rectors 
and presidents from urban universities across six continents. The league 
and its 47 representatives gather every two years to discuss global issues 
in education.[45] L. Jay Oliva formed the organization in 1991 just after 
he was inaugurated president of New York University.[46] NYU's board of 
trustees is currently one of the largest and most powerful in American 
academia.[47] The university logo, the upheld torch, is derived from the 
Statue of Liberty, signifying NYU's service to New York City. The torch 
is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed 
in 1965 by renowned graphic designer Tom Geismar of the branding and design 
firm Chermayeff & Geismar. There are at least two versions of the possible 
origin of the university color, violet. Some believe that it may have been 
chosen because violets are said to have grown abundantly in Washington 
Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others 
argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower 
associated with Athens, the center of learning in ancient Greece. Washington 
Square and Greenwich Village have been hubs of cultural life in New York 
City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected 
with NYU at various points in its history. Artists of the Hudson River 
School, the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled 
around Washington Square. Samuel F.B. Morse, a noted artist who also pioneered 
the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of 
Painting and Sculpture. He and Daniel Huntington were early tenants of 
the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The University rented 
out studio space and residential apartments within the "academic" building.) 
As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic 
life of the university.[34] In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens 
and Daniel Chester French lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, 
Washington Square Park was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic 
and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more 
diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change 
at NYU.[34] Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, 
and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson 
Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas 
Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area 
became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg 
and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which 
at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.[34] 
In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square 
East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.[48][49] 
NYU has successfully completed a seven-year, $2.5 billion campaign, surpassing 
expectations by raising more than $3 billion over the seven-year period.[50] 
Started in 2001, this campaign was the university's largest in its history, 
in which they planned to "raise $1 million per day for scholarships and 
financial aid, faculty building, new academic initiatives, and enhancing 
NYU's physical facilities".[51] The campaign included a $50 million gift 
from the Tisch family (after which one building and the art school are 
named) and a $60 million gift from six trustees called "The Partners Fund", 
aimed at hiring new faculty.[51][52] On October 15, 2007 the university 
announced that the Silver family donated $50 million to the School of Social 
Work, which will be renamed as a result.[53] This is the largest donation 
ever to a school of social work in the United States.[54] The 2007–2008 
academic year was the most successful fundraising year to date for NYU, 
with the school raising $698 million in only the first 11 months of the 
year, representing a 70% increase in donations from the prior year.[55] 
The University also recently announced plans for NYU's Call to Action, 
a new initiative to ask alumni and donors to support financial aid for 
students at NYU.[56] The university has announced a 25-year strategic development 
plan, scheduled to coincide with its bicentennial in 2031. Included in 
the "NYU 200" plans are increasing resident and academic space, hiring 
additional exemplary faculty, and involving the New York City community 
in a transparent planning process. Additionally, NYU hopes to make their 
buildings more environmentally friendly, which will be facilitated by an 
evaluation of all campus spaces.[57] As a part of this plan, NYU purchased 
118 million kilowatt-hours of wind power during the 2006–2007 academic 
year – the largest purchase of wind power by any university in the country 
and any institution in New York City.[58] For 2007, the university expanded 
its purchase of wind power to 132 million kilowatt-hours.[59] As a result, 
the EPA ranked NYU as one of the greenest colleges in the country in its 
annual College & University Green Power Challenge.[60] NYU consistently 
ranks as one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, raising 
$449.34 million in 2013 and $455.72 million in 2014.[61][62] NYU is also 
the 19th wealthiest university in America with $5.3 billion in cash and 
investments in fiscal year 2014.[63] NYU's campus in New York City includes 
more than 100 buildings in Manhattan,[64] as well as several buildings 
in Brooklyn. Most of NYU's buildings in Manhattan are located across a 
roughly 230-acre (930,000 m2) area bounded by Houston Street to the south, 
Broadway to the east, 14th Street to the north, and Sixth Avenue (Avenue 
of the Americas) to the west. The core of NYU consists of buildings that 
surround Washington Square Park.[65][66][67] With approximately 11,000 
undergraduate and graduate residents,[68] NYU had the seventh-largest university 
housing system in the U.S. as of 2007, and one of the largest among private 
schools.[69] Since the late 1970s, the central part of NYU has been its 
Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. The Washington 
Square Arch is an unofficial symbol of NYU. Until 2007, NYU had held its 
commencement ceremonies in Washington Square Park, but moved the ceremonies 
to Yankee Stadium in 2008 because of renovations to Washington Square.[70] 
In the 1990s, NYU became a "two square" university by building a second 
community around Union Square, in close proximity to Washington Square. 
NYU's Union Square community primarily consists of the priority residence 
halls of Carlyle Court, Palladium Residence Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Tower, 
Thirteenth Street Hall, University Hall, Third North Residence Hall, and 
Founders Hall.[65] NYU operates theaters and performance facilities that 
are often used by the university's music conservatory and Tisch School 
of the Arts. External productions are also occasionally held in NYU's facilities. 
The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the Skirball Center for 
Performing Arts (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington 
Square South, and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel 
Center. Recently, the Skirball Center hosted important speeches on foreign 
policy by John Kerry[71] and Al Gore.[72] The Skirball Center is the largest 
performing arts facility south of 42nd Street.[73][74] The Elmer Holmes 
Bobst Library, built between 1967 and 1972, is the largest library at NYU 
and one of the largest academic libraries in the United States. Designed 
by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, the 12-story, 425,000-square-foot 
(39,500 m2) structure sits on the southern edge of Washington Square Park 
(at 70 Washington Square South) and is the flagship of an eight-library, 
4.5 million-volume system. Bobst Library offers one Multidisciplinary Reference 
Center, a Research Commons, 28 miles (45 km) of open-stacks shelving, and 
approximately 2,000 seats for student study. The library is visited by 
more than 6,800 users each day, and circulates more than one million books 
annually.[75] Bobst's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media is one of 
the world's largest academic media centers, where students and researchers 
use more than 95,000 audio and video recordings per year.[76] The Digital 
Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty 
and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources 
for teaching, learning, research and arts events.[77] Bobst Library is 
also home to significant special collections. The Fales Collection houses 
one of the finest collections of English and American fiction in the United 
States, the unique Downtown Collection, documenting the New York literary 
avante-garde arts scene from the 1970s to the present, and the Food and 
Cookery Collection, which documents American food history with a focus 
on New York City. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, one of 
the finest collections in the world for scholarly research in labor history, 
socialism, anarchism, communism, and American radicalism. Tamiment includes 
the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, the Archives of Irish America, the 
Center for the Cold War and the U.S., and the Frederic Ewen Academic Freedom 
Center.[78] Since the early 2000s, NYU has developed new facilities on 
and around its Washington Square Campus. The Kimmel Center for University 
Life was built in 2003 as the primary location for the university's student 
services offices. It also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing 
Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner & Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb 
Student Center. The School of Law built Furman Hall in 2004, incorporating 
elements of two historic buildings into the new facade, one of which had 
been occupied by poet Edgar Allan Poe.[79] In 2005, NYU announced the development 
of a new life science facility on Waverly Place, the first new NYU science 
building since the opening of Meyer Hall in 1971.[80] In November 2005, 
NYU announced plans to build a 26-floor, 190,000-square-foot (18,000 m2) 
residence hall on 12th Street. The residence hall, named "Founders Hall", 
accommodates approximately 700 undergraduates and contains a host of other 
student facilities. It is currently the tallest building in the East Village.[81] 
NYU's Brooklyn campus is located at MetroTech Center, an urban academic-industrial 
research park,[36] and is only a few subway stops from the Washington Square 
campus. It houses the School of Engineering, the Center for Urban Science 
and Progress and also several of Tisch School of the Arts[82] and Steinhardt 
School of Culture, Education, and Human Development's degree programs.[83] 
The Brooklyn campus also houses NYU's Game Center Open Library, which is 
the largest collection of games held by any university in the world.[82] 
In 2014, NYU Langone Medical Center acquired a 125,000 square feet (11,600 m2) 
healthcare facility in Brooklyn.[84] The NYU shuttle bus system connects 
the Brooklyn campus with the Washington Square campus.[85][86] The New 
York University School of Medicine is situated near the East River waterfront 
at 550 First Avenue between East 30th and 34th Streets. The campus hosts 
the medical school, Tisch Hospital, and the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation 
Medicine.[87] Other NYU Centers across the city include NYU Hospital for 
Joint Diseases and the Bellevue Hospital Center.[88][89] NYU's Silver School 
of Social Work (formerly Ehrenkranz School of Social Work) manages branch 
campus programs in Westchester County at Manhattanville College, in Rockland 
County at St. Thomas Aquinas College, and on Staten Island at the City 
University of New York's College of Staten Island.[90] In Sterling Forest, 
near Tuxedo, NYU has a research facility that contains institutes, in particular 
the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine.[91] The Midtown Center 
at 11 West 42nd Street is home to the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate. 
The Woolworth Building in the financial district is home to NYU's professional 
studies and education programs.[92] NYU has two units located on the Upper 
East Side. The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, a discrete 
entity within NYU, independent of any other school or department of the 
university, is located on East 84th Street,[93] while the New York University 
Institute of Fine Arts, a graduate school of art history and fine arts, 
is located at the James B. Duke Building at 1 East 78th Street.[94] The 
Tandon School of Engineering has locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan. It 
is one of the oldest private engineering schools in the United States.[95] 
NYU has international houses on its Manhattan campus, including the Deutsches 
Haus, La Maison Française, Casa Italiana Zerilli Marimò, the Glucksman 
Ireland House, the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, the Hagop Kevorkian 
Center, an Africa House and a China House.[96] Tisch School of the Arts, 
Asia was NYU's first branch campus abroad. The result of a partnership 
between Tisch School of the Arts and the Singapore Government, it offered 
Master of Fine Arts degrees in animation and digital arts, dramatic writing, 
film and international media producing. The campus opened in fall 2007 
with the intention to enroll approximately 250 students.[97] Anticipated 
enrolment figures were not achieved, financial irregularities were alleged 
and President Pari Sara Shirazi was dismissed from her post by NYU in November 
2011.[98] She subsequently announced her intention to commence legal proceedings 
against NYU alleging wrongful termination and defamation.[99] In a letter 
to the Tisch Asia community dated November 8, 2012, Dean Mary Schmidt Campbell 
announced that the campus would close after 2014 with recruitment and admission 
of new students suspended with immediate effect.[100] In 2016, three former 
students of the now defunct Tisch Asia sued NYU.[101][102] NYU has a host 
of foreign facilities used for study abroad programs, referred to as Global 
Academic Centers. As of 2012, NYU operates 14 academic sites – both degree-granting 
research university campuses and study abroad sites – in Africa, Asia and 
the Middle East, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, including 
undergraduate academic-year and summer study abroad programs in New York 
City, Florence, London, Paris, Prague, Berlin, Accra, Madrid, Shanghai, 
Buenos Aires, Tel Aviv, Abu Dhabi, Sydney, and Washington, D.C.[103][104] 
One of the most noteworthy is the 57-acre (230,000 m2) campus of NYU Florence 
Villa LaPietra in Italy, bequeathed by the late Sir Harold Acton to NYU 
in 1994.[105] In fall 2010, NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) opened as the university's 
first overseas "Portal Campus" with an inaugural class of 150 students.[106] 
Unlike NYU's other study abroad centers, NYUAD functions as a separate 
liberal arts college within a university, offering complete degree programs 
to students admitted directly to NYUAD. NYUAD recruits students from all 
over the world and describes itself as the "World's Honor College". The 
main campus for NYUAD is under construction on Saadiyat Island and is scheduled 
to open in 2014. Until then the school operates from a campus located in 
downtown Abu Dhabi.[107] The campus construction and operational costs 
are entirely funded by the Abu Dhabi government.[108] In 2011, NYU announced 
plans to open another portal campus, New York University Shanghai, for 
the fall semester of 2013. It was set to have about 3,000 undergraduate 
students, the majority of whom would be Chinese. It was approved by the 
Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China in January 2011.[109] 
NYU's local partner will be East China Normal University (ECNU). ECNU's 
president Yu Lizhong will be the chancellor and play a major role in government 
relations while Jeffrey S. Lehman, former president of Cornell amongst 
other positions, will serve as vice chancellor and have "free rein in academic 
affairs".[110] In spring 2014, NYU opened a new campus in Paris, in the 
student area of the Quartier Latin, where NYU Law set up an EU Regulatory 
Policy Clinic taught by Alberto Alemanno and Vincent Chauvet.[111] NYU 
houses approximately 11,000 undergraduate and graduate residents,[68] and 
had the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. as of 2007, 
and one of the largest among private schools.[69] NYU's undergraduate housing 
system consists of more than 20 residence halls.[68] Uniquely, many of 
NYU's residence halls are converted apartment complexes or old hotels. 
In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are 
opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare 
for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens, lavatories, 
living rooms and common areas.[112] The university operates its own transit 
system to transport its students by bus to its campus.[113] Undergraduate 
students are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU. Most freshman 
residence halls are located near the Washington Square area. While nearly 
all of the residence halls that primarily house sophomores are located 
near the Union Square area, two former residence halls were located in 
the Financial District and one is still in use in Chinatown.[114][115] 
All of NYU's residence halls are governed by the Inter-Residence Hall Council 
(IRHC), an umbrella student council organization.[116] In 2007, the National 
Association of College and University Residence Halls (NACURH) named NYU 
the National School of the Year for IRHC and NRHH's strong efforts over 
the past year. In addition, NYU was named the National Program of the Year 
for UltraViolet Live, the annual inter-hall competition that raises funds 
for Relay For Life.[117] NYU has made the greening of its campus a large 
priority. For example, NYU has been the largest university purchaser of 
wind energy in the U.S. since 2009.[118] With this switch to renewable 
power, NYU is achieving benefits equivalent to removing 12,000 cars from 
the road or planting 72,000 trees. In May 2008, the NYU Sustainability 
Task Force awarded $150,000 in grants to 23 projects that would focus research 
and efforts toward energy, food, landscape, outreach, procurement, transportation 
and waste.[119] These projects include a student-led bike-sharing program 
modeled after Paris' Velib program with 30 bikes free to students, staff, 
and faculty. NYU received a grade of "B" on the College Sustainability 
Report Card 2010 from the Sustainable Endowments Institute.[120] NYU purchased 
118 million kilowatt-hours of wind power during the 2006–2007 academic 
year – the largest purchase of wind power by any university in the country 
and any institution in New York City.[58] For 2007, the university expanded 
its purchase of wind power to 132 million kilowatt-hours.[59] The EPA ranked 
NYU as one of the greenest colleges in the country in its annual College 
& University Green Power Challenge.[60] New York University comprises the 
following schools and colleges:[12] Arts and Science is currently NYU's 
largest academic division. It has three subdivisions: the College of Arts 
and Science, the Graduate School of Arts and Science, and the Liberal Studies 
program.[12] The College of Arts and Science and Liberal Studies program 
are undergraduate divisions, and the former has existed since the founding 
of NYU.[121] Undergraduate divisions are also found in the College of Dentistry, 
College of Nursing, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Gallatin 
School of Individualized Study, Leonard N. Stern School of Business, NYU 
Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, Tandon School of Engineering,[122] Silver School 
of Social Work, School of Professional Studies, Steinhardt School of Culture, 
Education, and Human Development, and the Tisch School of the Arts. Postgraduate 
divisions are found in all of NYU's schools and colleges.[12] NYU manages 
one of the largest annual collegiate research budgets of any university 
in the United States. In 2014, NYU received $524 million in research grants 
from the National Science Foundation alone.[123] NYU School of Medicine 
received $305 million in external research funding from the National Institutes 
of Health in 2014.[124] NYU was granted 90 patents in 2014, the 19th most 
of any institution in the world.[125] NYU owns the fastest supercomputer 
in New York City.[126] As of 2016, NYU hardware researchers and their collaborators 
enjoy the largest outside funding level for hardware security of any institution 
in the United States, including grants from the National Science Foundation 
(NSF), the Office of Naval Research, the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA), the United States Army Research Laboratory, the Air Force 
Research Laboratory, the Semiconductor Research Corporation, and companies 
including Boeing, Microsoft, and Google.[127] Admission to NYU is highly 
selective. For the undergraduate class of 2019, 18,500 were admitted from 
an applicant pool of 60,322 (31%).[128] As of 2016, NYU's graduate schools 
have acceptance rates of 1.8% to the School of Medicine,[129] 23% to the 
School of Business,[130] 28% to the School of Engineering,[131] 29% to 
the Graduate School of Arts and Science,[132] and 34% to the School of 
Law.[133] Total undergraduate freshman enrollment is 5,917 for the 2015–2016 
academic year, representing 49 states and 91 countries, with 19% as non-US 
citizens. Most freshmen have a typical unweighted GPA of 3.5/A (90–95%) 
and are in the top 10% of their high school graduating class. The middle 
50% of freshmen score between 1900 and 2150 on the SAT and between 29 and 
32 on the ACT. The student-to-faculty ratio at the New York campus is 10:1, 
and less than that at the Abu Dhabi and Shanghai campuses. The average 
scholarship amount awarded to freshmen is $29,528, and 21% of freshmen 
received Pell Grants.[134] As of 2016, average MCAT score of students at

York University School of Law 1st for tax law and 1st for international 
law. The publication also ranks The Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of 
Public Service 6th in public policy.[161] The NYU Department of Philosophy 
is globally ranked 1st by the The Philosophical Gourmet Report[162] and 
the QS World University Rankings.[163] In The Los Angeles Times, NYU Tisch 
School of Arts is ranked 1st for film by Ranker.[164][165] NYU is ranked 
1st for New Ivies by college resource guide Unigo.[166] In 2006, NYU was 
named by Kaplan as one of the "New Ivies".[167] The annual Global Employability 
Survey in The New York Times ranks NYU 11th nationally and 29th globally 
for employability.[168][169] For four consecutive years NYU has been ranked 
as America's "#1 dream school" by the Princeton Review.[170] NYU is consistently 
ranked as a "Top 10 Dream College" for both parents and students according 
to The Princeton Review. Alongside Stanford University, Harvard College, 
Princeton University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, NYU is 
one of few universities to regularly appear in the top 10 list for both 
parents and students.[171] NYU ranks 19th in the world based on the number 
of patents generated.[172] The Student Senators Council is the governing 
student body at NYU. The SSC has been involved in controversial debates 
on campus, including a campuswide ban on the sale of Coca-Cola products 
in 2005, and the Graduate Student Organizing Committee unionization in 
2001 and subsequent strike in 2005.[173][174][175][176] This ban was lifted 
by the University Senate on February 5, 2009.[177] NYU has over 450 student 
clubs and organizations on campus.[178] In addition to the sports teams, 
fraternities, sororities, and study clubs, there are many organizations 
on campus that focus on entertainment, arts, and culture. These organizations 
include various student media clubs: for instance, the daily student newspaper 
the Washington Square News, the NYU Local daily blog, The Plague comedy 
magazine, "Washington Square Local web-based satire news source, and the 
literary journals Washington Square Review and The Minetta Review, as well 
as student-run event producers such as the NYU Program Board and the Inter-Residence 
Hall Council. It also operates radio station WNYU-FM 89.1 with a diverse 
college radio format, transmitting to the entire New York metropolitan 
area from the original campus, and via booster station WNYU-FM1 which fills 
in the signal in lower Manhattan from atop one of the Silver Towers, next 
to the football field at the Washington Square campus.[179][180] The New 
York University Mock Trial team is consistently ranked as one of the best 
collegiate mock trial teams in the country. NYU has qualified for the National 
Championship Tournament for 10 consecutive seasons and placed in the top 
10 during each of those years. In the 2009–2010 season, NYU won the 26th 
National Championship Tournament in Memphis over rival Harvard.[181] The 
following season, they qualified for the final round once more only to 
be the runners-up to UCLA.[182] In the American Mock Trial Association's 
2015–2016 power rankings, NYU ranks third, behind Harvard and Yale.[183] 
During the University Heights era, an apparent rift evolved with some organizations 
distancing themselves from students from the downtown schools. The exclusive 
Philomathean Society operated from 1832 to 1888 (formally giving way in 
1907 and reconstituted into the Andiron Club). Included among the Andiron's 
regulations was "Rule No.11: Have no relations save the most casual and 
informal kind with the downtown schools".[184] The Eucleian Society, rival 
to the Philomathean Society, was founded in 1832. The Knights of the Lamp 
was a social organization founded in 1914 at the School of Commerce. This 
organization met every full moon and had a glowworm as its mascot.[185] 
The Red Dragon Society, founded in 1898, is thought to be the most selective 
society at NYU. In addition, NYU's first yearbook was formed by fraternities 
and "secret societies" at the university.[186] NYU has traditions which 
have persisted across campuses. Since the beginning of the 20th century 
initiation ceremonies have welcomed incoming NYU freshmen. At the Bronx 
University Heights Campus, seniors used to grab unsuspecting freshmen, 
take them to a horse-watering trough, and then dunk them head-first into 
what was known colloquially as "the Fountain of Knowledge". This underground 
initiation took place until the 1970s.[187] Today freshmen take part in 
university-sponsored activities during what is called "Welcome Week".[188] 
In addition, throughout the year the university traditionally holds Apple 
Fest (an apple-themed country fest that began at the University Heights 
campus), the Violet Ball (a dance in the atrium of Bobst Library), Strawberry 
Fest (featuring New York City's longest Strawberry Shortcake), and the 
semi-annual midnight breakfast where Student Affairs administrators serve 
free breakfast to students before finals.[189] Students publish a campus 
comedy magazine, The Plague. Like many college humor magazines, this often 
pokes fun at popular culture as well as campus life and the idiosyncrasies 
of New York University.[190] The Plague was founded in 1978[191] by Howard 
Ostrowsky along with Amy Burns, John Rawlins, Joe Pinto and Dan Fiorella,[192] 
and is currently published once per semester.[193] It is not NYU's first 
humor magazine, as The Medley was a humor magazine published by the Eucleian 
Society from 1913 to 1950.[190] Some of the first fraternities in the country 
were formed at NYU.[194][195] Greek life first formed on the NYU campus 
in 1837 when Psi Upsilon chartered its Delta Chapter.[194] The first fraternities 
at NYU were social ones. With their athletic, professional, intellectual, 
and service activities, later groups sought to attract students who also 
formed other groups. Since then, Greek letter organizations have proliferated 
to include 25 social fraternities and sororities. As of 2014, approximately 
13% of NYU students are members of fraternities or sororities.[196] Four 
governing boards oversee Greek life at the university. The Interfraternity 
Council (IFC) has jurisdiction over all twelve recognized fraternities 
on campus. Eight sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Panhellenic 
Council (PhC), which features seven national sororities (ΔΦΕ, ΑΕΦ, ΑΣΤ, 
ΠΒΦ, KKΓ, ZTΑ, ΔΓ) and two local sororities (AΦΖ and ΘΦΒ). Five multicultural 
organizations maintain membership in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), 
including two fraternities and three sororities. All three of the aforementioned 
boards are managed under the auspices of the Inter-Greek Council.[197] 
Greek organizations have historical significance at NYU. Delta Phi Epsilon, 
Zeta Psi, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Tau Delta Phi,[198] Alpha Kappa Psi and Delta 
Sigma Pi were founded at NYU. Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America was 
chartered in 1847,[195] Delta Sigma Pi in 1907,[199] and Alpha Epsilon 
Pi in 1913.[200] Delta Phi Epsilon was founded in 1917.[201] The NYU Gamma 
chapter of Delta Phi, founded in 1841, is the longest continuously active 
fraternity chapter in the world, having never gone inactive since its establishment. 
Delta Phi is also the oldest continuously active fraternity in the United 
States, being the only organization in the original Union Triad to remain 
active since its institute.[202] The NYU Gamma chapter of Zeta Beta Tau 
is the oldest active ZBT chapter in the country.[203] NYU does not have 
an ROTC program on campus. However, NYU students may participate in the 
U.S. Army ROTC program through NYC Army ROTC, headquartered at Fordham 
University.[204] NYU's sports teams are referred to as the NYU Violets, 
the colors being the trademarked hue "NYU Violet" and white. Since 1981, 
the school mascot has been a bobcat, whose origin can be traced back to 
the abbreviation then being used by the Bobst Library computerized catalog—short: 
Bobcat.[205] NYU's sports teams include baseball, men's and women's varsity 
basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, soccer, softball, swimming and 
diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling.[206] All of 
NYU's sports teams participate in the NCAA's Division III and the University 
Athletic Association, with the exception of fencing, which participates 
in Division I.[207] While NYU has had All-American football players, the 
school has not had a varsity football team since 1952.[208] NYU students 
also compete in club and intramural sports, including badminton, baseball, 
basketball, crew, cycling, equestrianism, ice hockey, lacrosse, martial 
arts, rugby, softball, squash, tennis, triathlon, and ultimate. The Coles 
Sports and Recreation Center serves as the home base of several of NYU's 
intercollegiate athletic teams. Many of NYU's varsity teams play their 
games at various facilities and fields throughout Manhattan because of 
the scarcity of space for playing fields near campus. In 2002, NYU opened 
the Palladium Athletic Facility as the second on-campus recreational facility.[209][210] 
NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015.[211] At least 38 Nobel Prize 
winners are affiliated with NYU. NYU is associated with a great number 
of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator 
and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac 
defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), RFID (Mario 
Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang 
Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin 
Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), 
black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis 
Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald),

of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation 
therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald 
Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Some 
of the most prolific inventors in American history, such as Jerome H. Lemelson, 
Samuel Ruben, and James Wood, are NYU alumni. NYU is the birthplace of 
the tractor beam.[212] Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School 
of Engineering worked on problems whose solution led to the development 
of radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics 
in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules,[213] 
as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System 
and trading floors.[214] Developer of the early telephone systems in the 
United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications 
facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, 
designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon 
Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as 
well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from 
the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just,[215] are also NYU 
alumni. Many of the world's most renowned companies, such as IBM (Charles 
Ranlett Flint), Twitter (Jack Dorsey), Bloomberg L.P. (Charles Zegar), 
Jacobs Engineering Group (Joseph J. Jacobs), Hudson Group (Robert B. Cohen), 
MTV (Tom Freston), Barnes & Noble (Leonard Riggio), Northrop Grumman (William 
T. Schwendler), Automatic Data Processing (Henry Taub), Duracell (Samuel 
Ruben), Bugle Boy (William C. W. Mow), Virgin Mobile USA (Dan Schulman), 
among many others, were founded or co-founded by NYU alumni. Likewise, 
many of the world's most famous companies were either owned or led by NYU 
alumni. For example, Lockheed Martin (Robert J. Stevens), Xerox (Ursula 
Burns), Yahoo! (Alfred Amoroso), TPV Technology (Jason Hsuan), 20th Century 
Fox (Marvin Davis), BAE Systems Inc (Mark Ronald), AECOM (John Dionisio), 
Pfizer (John Elmer McKeen), Ingersoll Rand (Herbert L. Henkel), General 
Motors (Alfred P. Sloan), Sears (Arthur C. Martinez), The New York Times 
(Spencer Trask), Stanley Black & Decker (John Trani), American International 
Group (Harvey Golub), American Express (Edward P. Gilligan), Qwest (Joseph 
Nacchio), Chase Bank (Walter V. Shipley), CBS (Laurence Alan Tisch), Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Company (Charles A. Heimbold, Jr.), Citigroup (Robert I. Lipp),

Entertainment (Peter Guber), GQ (Steven Florio), Viacom (Thomas E. Dooley), 
Liberty Media (John C. Malone), Verizon (Lawrence Babbio Jr.) and Chemtura 
(Vincent A. Calarco), just to name a few. Pioneer of Silicon Valley, Eugene 
Kleiner,[216] and World Trade Center site owner, Larry Silverstein, are 
also alumni of NYU. The following are examples of some of the many notable 
members of some of the many notable graduating classes: class of 1941,
