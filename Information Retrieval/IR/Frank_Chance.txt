As player As manager Frank Leroy Chance (September 9, 1876 – September 
15, 1924) was an American professional baseball player. A first baseman, 
Chance played in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs (initially 
named the "Orphans") and New York Yankees from 1898 through 1914. He also 
served as manager of the Cubs, Yankees, and Boston Red Sox. Discovered 
by the Cubs as he played semi-professional baseball while attending college, 
Chance debuted with the Cubs in 1898, serving as a part-time player. In 
1903, Chance became the Cubs' regular first baseman, and in 1905, he succeeded 
Frank Selee as the team's manager. Chance led the Cubs to four National 
League championships in the span of five years (1906–1910) and won the 
World Series in 1907 and 1908. With Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers, Chance 
formed a strong double play combination, which was immortalized as "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance" 
in "Baseball's Sad Lexicon". Let go by the Cubs after the 1912 season, 
Chance signed with the Yankees, serving as a player–manager for two seasons. 
He joined the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League as a player–manager, 
returning to MLB in 1923 as manager of the Red Sox. Chance was named the 
manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1924, but never took control of the 
team as he became ill. He died later that year. Noted for his leadership 
abilities, Chance earned the nickname "Peerless Leader." [1] He is the 
all-time leader in managerial winning percentage in Cubs history. Chance 
was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in the 1946 balloting by the Veterans 
Committee, along with Tinker and Evers. Chance was born in Salida, California, 
in Stanislaus County, on September 9, 1876. His family was of English and 
Scottish descent.[2] He was raised in Fresno, California[3] and attended 
Fresno High School.[4] His father was president of the first national bank 
in Fresno.[2] Chance enrolled at the University of California, where he 
pursued a degree in dentistry.[4] He transferred to Washington College 
in Irvington, California. While playing baseball for the school's baseball 
team, he received an offer to play semi-professional baseball for a team 
in Sullivan, Illinois, for $40 a month ($1,140 in current dollar terms), 
which he accepted.[2] Returning to college the next year, Chance led his 
team to a third-place finish in an amateur tournament of 50 teams.[2] Bill 
Lange of the Chicago Cubs discovered Chance and convinced the Cubs to sign 
him as a backup catcher and outfielder,[2][4] receiving $1,200 a year ($34,190 
in current dollar terms).[2] Chance was scouted by other teams, but chose 
the Cubs as Tim Donohue was the only catcher ahead of him on the Cubs' 
depth chart.[2] Chance began his career in 1898 with the Chicago Cubs, 
serving as a reserve catcher and outfielder. He played irregularly through 
the 1902 season. Due in part to finger injuries suffered while catching, 
Chance played in no more than 75 games in a season through 1902.[4] In 
1903, Johnny Kling became the Cubs' full-time catcher. As Bill Hanlon, 
the Cubs' first baseman, left the team, manager Frank Selee moved Chance 
to first base. Though Chance initially balked at the position change, he 
agreed when he received a pay raise.[4] In 125 games during the 1903 season, 
Chance recorded a .327 batting average, and 67 stolen bases; the latter 
mark led the National League (NL). His .439 on-base percentage was third-best 
in the league, behind Roy Thomas and Roger Bresnahan, and his 81 runs batted 
in (RBIs) tied Jake Beckley for sixth-best.[4] Chance had a .310 batting 
average in 1904, good for sixth place in the NL. His .382 on-base percentage 
was the fourth-best in the league, and his .430 slugging percentage was 
fifth-best. Chance also hit six home runs, tying him with Dan McGann, Red 
Dooin, and Cozy Dolan for third place, his 42 stolen bases tied McGann 
for fourth place, and his 89 runs scored were seventh-best.[5] Selee fell 
ill in 1905, and Chance was selected to succeed him as manager.[4] That 
year, he also batted .316 with 92 runs scored and 70 RBIs. His batting 
average was sixth-best in the NL, while he led the league with a .450 on-base 
percentage, and finished seventh with a .434 slugging percentage. His 38 
stolen bases were sixth-best in the league.[6] In 1906, Chance batted .319 
and led the NL in runs scored (103) and stolen bases (57). His batting 
average was fifth-best in the league, while his .419 on-base percentage 
finished in third, and his .430 slugging percentage placed him in fifth.[7] 
When Chance stole home from second base in a tie game against the Cincinnati 
Reds, team owner Charles W. Murphy granted him a ten-percent ownership 
stake in the club to show his gratitude. Chance later sold his share of 
the franchise for approximately $150,000.[4] Meanwhile, The Cubs won 116 
games during the 1906 season, taking the NL pennant.[4][8] The Chicago 
White Sox of the American League defeated the Cubs in the 1906 World Series.[9] 
Chance batted .293 during the 1907 season, finishing sixth in the NL, while 
his .395 on-base percentage was third-best. He tied Ed Abbaticchio for 
seventh with 35 stolen bases.[10] The Cubs returned to the World Series 
in 1907. Though Chance only batted .154 in the 1907 World Series, the Cubs 
defeated the Tigers in four games.[11] Chance began to decline during the 
1908 season. Though he finished third in the NL with 27 doubles, he did 
not finish among the ten best in the categories of batting average, on-base 
percentage, or stolen bases in 1908, 1909, or 1910.[12][13][14] Chance 
batted .425 in the 1908 World Series, as the Cubs again defeated the Tigers, 
this time in five games.[15] By 1910, Chance began to groom Fred Luderus 
as his successor at first base.[16] He rebuilt the team in 1911 after Evers's 
nervous breakdown and the departure of Harry Steinfeldt, replacing them 
with Heinie Zimmerman and Jim Doyle respectively.[17] The Cubs returned 
to the World Series in 1910, against the Philadelphia Athletics. Chance 
batted .353 in the 1910 World Series, though the Athletics won the series 
in five games.[18] Chance was ejected in game three, becoming the first 
player ever ejected from a World Series game. Chance continued to transition 
himself out of the Cubs' lineup in 1911, as he played in only 31 games.[4] 
In 1912, Chance endured surgeries to correct blood clots in his brain that 
were caused by being hit by pitches in his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued 
with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs in 
an effort to save the team money.[4] The New York Yankees negotiated for 
Chance's release from the Cubs after the 1912 season.[19] The Cubs released 
Chance while he was hospitalized,[4] and in January 1913, Chance signed 
a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 ($2,877,980 in current 
dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees' manager.[20] He also played first 
base for the Yankees[21] and served as field captain, though he played 
in no more than 12 games in a season.[4] The Yankees sat in last place 
on the next-to-last day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to 
finish in seventh place.[22] In 1914, Chance named Roger Peckinpaugh the 
Yankees' new captain.[23] After struggling during the 1914 season, Chance 
criticized the talent brought to him by Yankees scout Arthur Irwin. After 
repeatedly seeking to have Irwin fired, he offered his resignation from 
the team late in the season on the condition that he still was to receive 
his 1915 salary.[24] After this was accepted by team owner Frank J. Farrell, 
Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh 
served as player–manager for the remainder of the season.[25][26] Chance 
returned to his native California, and was named manager of the Los Angeles 
Angels of the Pacific Coast League in 1916.[27] Chance won the league championship 
in 1916. He re-signed with the Angels for the 1917 season[28] and was also 
granted a part ownership in the Angels from the majority owner, John F. 
Powers. Powers and Chance remained good friends for the rest of his life. 
He resigned during the 1917 season due to his declining health.[29] He 
then served as president of the California Winter League, continuing to 
instill discipline in players: he fined Ty Cobb for "abusing an umpire".[30] 
Chance managed the Boston Red Sox in 1923.[31] The Red Sox did not retain 
Chance after the season.[32] But some sources noted that Chance had only 
agreed to a one-year contract and was not necessarily interested in returning 
to the Red Sox, a team described by one sportswriter as no better than 
a minor league club.[33] After his relationship with the Red Sox was severed, 
he was named the Chicago White Sox manager for the 1924 season[34] but 
developed severe influenza before he could take the helm. He soon developed 
other respiratory complications, including asthma.[35] Chance submitted 
his resignation to owner Charles Comiskey, but Comiskey refused to accept 
it, giving him the opportunity to return to the team when his health improved.[36] 
He returned to Chicago briefly in April,[37] but was unable to take charge 
of the team.[35] Chance returned to Los Angeles where he underwent emergency 
surgery in April 1924. Evers was named the White Sox acting manager for 
the 1924 season.[38] He is buried in Los Angeles in the Angelus-Rosedale 
Cemetery. Chance was part of the trio of infielders remembered for their 
double-play ability, with Joe Tinker and Johnny Evers. The trio were immortalized 
as "Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance", also known as "Baseball's Sad Lexicon", 
written by the 28-year-old New York Evening Mail newspaper columnist Franklin 
Pierce Adams in July 1910.[39][40] Chance helped Evers develop an underhanded 
throw.[41] Chance took over as Chicago's manager in 1905. His playing time 
decreased towards the end of the decade. The Cubs won the NL pennant in 
1906, 1907, 1908 and 1910, and won the World Series in 1907 and 1908—the 
team's last World Series titles prior to 2016. He became the highest paid 
player in baseball, earning as much as $25,000 ($635,982 in current dollar 
terms) in 1910.[42] Chance's lifetime record as a manager was 946–648 (.593 
winning percentage); his .667 winning percentage as manager of the Cubs 
is the highest in franchise history.[4] As a player, Chance is the Cubs' 
all-time career leader in stolen bases, with 400. He led the Cubs in batting 
average in 1903, 1904, 1905 and 1907. In World Series play, Chance batted 
.310, recording 22 hits, scoring 11 runs, and stealing 10 bases.[4] Chance 
was a disciplinarian.[43] He preached moderation in socializing, including 
avoiding alcohol, to his players.[44] Chance fined his players for shaking 
hands with members of the opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay 
his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities 
on the playing field.[4] In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker for the 
remainder of the season for using profanity,[45] though he reinstated Tinker 
two days later.[46] During the baseball offseasons, Chance worked as a 
prizefighter. James J. Corbett and John L. Sullivan, among the best fighters 
of the era, both considered Chance "the greatest amateur brawler of all 
time."[4] Chance owned a ranch in Glendora, California, which he sold prior 
to becoming manager of the Red Sox.[48] Chance married Edythe Pancake on 
October 3, 1903.[49] Edythe became an advocate for baseball, imploring 
women to attend baseball games.[50] Chance died at age 48. Some sources 
simply said that he died after a "long illness",[51] while others attributed 
it to heart disease brought on by severe spasms of bronchial asthma.[52] 
He was survived by his wife, mother, sister, and three brothers.[53][54] 
Chance was interred in the Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, Los Angeles. His 
death was greatly mourned, and his funeral received widespread publicity 
in Los Angeles and Chicago. Among his pallbearers were Powers and race 
car driver Barney Oldfield.[55] His estate was valued at $170,000.[56] 
After falling short of induction in the Hall of Fame by seven votes in 
1945,[57] Chance was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1946. Tinker and Evers 
were elected the same year.[58][59] Chance was also elected to the Fresno 
Athletic Hall of Fame.[60] A baseball field in Fresno named after Chance 
operated from 1935 to 1941. Joe DiMaggio played in the first-ever game 
at Frank Chance Field.[60] Retired players participated in an exhibition 
game in Chance's honor in 1937.[61] John McGraw, a contemporary and rival 
of Chance, considered Chance one of the greatest players he ever saw.[62]
