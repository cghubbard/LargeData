Ballston Spa is a village in Saratoga County, New York, United States. 
The population was 5,556 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Saratoga 
County.[1] The village is named after Rev. Eliphalet Ball, a Congregationalist 
clergyman and an early settler.[2][3] The village lies on the border of 
two towns and is partly in the Town of Ballston and partly in the Town 
of Milton. The village is southwest of Saratoga Springs. The village was 
first settled in 1771. In 1787 Benajah Douglas, father of 1860 presidential 
candidate Stephen A. Douglas, built the first tavern and hotel at Ballston 
Spa. It was located near the natural spring.[4] In 1803 Ballston Spa's 
Sans Souci Hotel, at the time the largest hotel in the United States, was 
built by Nicholas Low. Presidents, senators and governors stayed there, 
as well as many wealthy private citizens.[5] Ballston Spa was incorporated 
as a village in 1807. At one time the village was the 11th most populated 
region in the future United States.[citation needed] It was once served 
by four railroads (Delaware and Hudson Railway, The Ballston Terminal Railroad, 
Schenectady Railway Company,[6] Hudson Valley Railway).[7] The village 
was famous for its mineral water spring used for healing in sanatoriums,[8] 
including the Hawthorne and Lithia springs. The effervescent water, tonic, 
and cathartic from this city is also known as Ballston Spa. The liquid 
contains common salt and carbonates of magnesium and calcium. Portions 
of the novel The Last of the Mohicans were written by James Fenimore Cooper 
in the present day Brookside Museum and inspired by the local landscape. 
The village was the model for the village of North Bath, NY, the setting 
for the 1993 best-selling novel and 1994 movie, Nobody's Fool. The book's 
author, Richard Russo, is a native of nearby Gloversville. It was also 
the location of the fictional "Elspeth Hatch" murder trial defended by 
Clarence Darrow set in 1897 in the book titled Angel of Darkness by author 
Caleb Carr. Several scenes in Sydney Pollack's 1973 film The Way We Were 
were filmed on Ballston Spa's Front Street. Scenes from The Horse Whisperer 
(1998) were also filmed in the village.[9] Since 2008 Ballston Spa has 
been home to the Ballston Spa Film Festival of short films from around 
the globe.[10] Ballston Spa is home to the National Bottle Museum.[11] 
It is also home to Brookside Museum, Saratoga County Historical Society.[12] 
The Brookside Museum, United States Post Office, Union Mill Complex, and 
Verbeck House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[13] 
George West (known as the "Paper Bag King") developed a line of square-bottomed 
paper bags which he manufactured by the millions after the American Civil 
War, and at one time owned almost a dozen paper mills located along the 
Kayaderosseras Creek.[14] The village was also home to the Ballston Knitting 
Company from 1918 to 1994.[citation needed] Recent mayors of Ballston Spa:
