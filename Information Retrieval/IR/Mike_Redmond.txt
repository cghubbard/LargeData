As a player As a manager Michael Patrick Redmond (born May 5, 1971) is 
an American former professional baseball catcher and manager. He played 
for 13 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Florida Marlins, Minnesota 
Twins, and Cleveland Indians. In 864 career games, Redmond recorded a batting 
average of .287 and accumulated 13 home runs, and 243 runs batted in (RBI). 
Redmond batted and threw right-handed. He made his major league debut on 
May 31, 1998, and played his final game on July 2, 2010, and was part of 
the Florida Marlins team that won the 2003 World Series. He was named the 
manager of the Marlins on November 1, 2012. After two and a half years, 
Redmond was fired on May 17, 2015. Michael Patrick Redmond was born on 
May 5, 1971 in Seattle, five minutes after his fraternal twin brother, 
Patrick Michael.[1][2] His father, Pat Sr., was a grocery store buyer.[2] 
Redmond grew up in Kirkland, Washington, where he played Little League 
baseball. His family moved to Spokane, Washington, where Mike and his brother 
attended Gonzaga Preparatory School,[3] graduating in 1989. Mike, a catcher, 
and Patrick, a shortstop, both played baseball for the Gonzaga Prep baseball 
team. In his senior season at Gonzaga Prep, Mike had a .300 batting average 
with three home runs and 21 runs batted in. He set a single-game record 
for putouts by a catcher with 15, the single-season record for assists 
with 114.[1] Both Redmond brothers committed to attend Gonzaga University, 
where they played college baseball for the Gonzaga Bulldogs baseball team, 
when it competed in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10), from 1990 through 
1993.[1][4] Redmond was named a first team Pac-10 all-conference selection 
in 1991 and 1992.[5] Redmond was invited to Homestead, Florida, where he 
participated in the United States national baseball team trials for the 
1992 Summer Olympics.[6] Undrafted in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, 
Redmond signed with the Florida Marlins as an undrafted free agent on August 
18, 1992.[7] He made his professional debut in minor league baseball with 
the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League in 1993, and also 
played for the Cougars in 1994.[8] He was promoted to the Brevard County 
Manatees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 1994, and the 
Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League in 1995. After playing 
with Portland in 1996, he was promoted to the Charlotte Knights of the 
Class AAA International League in 1997. Redmond had shoulder surgery in 
1997, and was presented the option of playing for Portland or remaining 
with the organization as a coach. Redmond opted to continue playing, returning 
to Portland in 1998.[2] Redmond made his Major League debut with Florida 
on May 31, 1998, receiving the opportunity after the Marlins traded Charles 
Johnson and Mike Piazza;[2] he hit .331 in 37 games that year for the Marlins. 
He played with the Marlins as a backup catcher, often sharing time with 
Johnson, Jorge Fábregas, and Paul Bako. In 2002, Redmond posted career-highs 
in both batting average, hitting .305, and in games played with 89.[9] 
In the following season, he served as the backup to Iván Rodríguez,[3] 
as the Marlins won the 2003 World Series. When the Marlins fell into a 
slump in 2003, he would take batting practice wearing only batting gloves, 
socks, and shoes.[10][11][12] In 2004, with Rodríguez signing with the 
Detroit Tigers, Redmond split catching duties with Ramón Castro.[13] However, 
he got injured early into the season when, while running the bases, his 
left pinky finger was spiked by Marcus Giles, resulting in a chipped fracture.[14] 
Redmond signed a two-year contract with the Minnesota Twins to backup starting 
catcher Joe Mauer before the 2005 season. His 2005 season ended prematurely 
due to a torn plantar fascia in his right foot.[15] During the 2007 season, 
Redmond signed a two-year contract extension with a club option for the 
2009 season.[16] He played in 82 games during the 2007 season due to an 
injury to Mauer,[17] though he continued to play through his own injuries, 
including a broken finger, bruised shoulder, and stitches in his head.[18] 
During the 2008 season, Redmond frequently joined Dan Gladden on the Twins 
Radio Network live broadcasts prior to the game to give his insight from 
the dugout. After the 2008 season, the Twins exercised an option on Redmond's 
contract, paying him $950,000 for the 2009 season.[17] He suffered injury 
in the beginning of the season in a game against the Mariners; after escaping 
unscathed from a hit to the shoulder by a broken bat, Redmond aggravated 
a groin muscle while attempting to run out a ground ball.[19] On May 28, 
2009, Redmond was ejected from a game for the first time in his career 
after a furious reaction to a safe call at home plate. The call occurred 
in a game against the Boston Red Sox that saw both teams have their managers 
and catchers ejected in the same inning. Redmond successfully relayed an 
outfield assist from Jason Kubel and tagged Jeff Bailey out just before 
he reached home plate—which subsequent replays confirmed—but home plate 
umpire Todd Tichenor ruled that Bailey was safe. Redmond then got into 
a face-to-face argument with Tichenor, which led to his ejection.[20] Tichenor 
also ejected Twins manager Ron Gardenhire for defending Redmond, before 
subsequently throwing both Terry Francona and Jason Varitek out for an 
unrelated matter.[21] The Twins let Redmond leave after the 2009 season, 
opting to use Drew Butera and José Morales as their backup catchers.[22] 
On January 15, 2010, Redmond signed a one-year contract with a guaranteed 
salary of $850,000 to play for the Cleveland Indians[23] The Indians credited 
Redmond with helping Fausto Carmona have a strong start to the 2010 season.[24] 
He committed an error on May 23, 2010, which was his first error since 
July 22, 2004. The 253 game streak without an error set a new MLB record, 
besting Mike Matheny's 252 consecutive errorless games from 2002 to 2004.[25] 
However, Redmond batted .206 in 22 games, and was designated for assignment 
on July 10, 2010 to make room on the 40-man roster for catcher/outfielder 
Chris Gimenez.[26] Redmond had only played in three games since June 8, 
and the Indians wanted to develop their younger players.[27] On July 16, 
2010, Redmond was released by the Indians. Redmond retired on October 4, 
2010.[28] In 2011, Redmond managed the Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League, 
the Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The Lugnuts had their best 
record in team history under Redmond, and reached the league finals.[29] 
He was named Midwest League manager of the year.[5] In 2012, he managed 
the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, the Blue Jays' Class 
A-Advanced affiliate.[30] On November 1, 2012, Redmond was named manager 
of the Miami Marlins,[31] and given a three-year deal.[32] After the conclusion 
of the 2014 season Redmond got a contract extension until 2017.[33] After 
struggling to start the 2015 season, rumors indicated that Marlins' owner 
Jeffrey Loria, was considering firing Redmond.[34][35] The Marlins fired 
Redmond on May 17, just under an hour after the Marlins lost to the Braves, 
leaving the team at 16–22 on the season.[36][37] As a catcher, Redmond 
was known for his skill in calling the right pitches for the pitcher to 
throw. He was also noted for his veteran leadership and clubhouse presence.[17] 
He was also known for his defensive ability. He caught R.A. Dickey and 
Dennis Springer, who all threw a knuckleball, considered a difficult pitch 
to catch.[38] Redmond is ranked second in career fielding percentage as 
a catcher, finishing with 99.6%.[39] In 1999, Redmond won the Charlie Hough 
Good Guy Award. He was inducted into the Unum Portland Sea Dogs Hall of 
Fame in 2010, primarily because of the stellar defensive skills he exemplified 
during his tenure with the team and in the major leagues. However, Redmond 
could not attend the induction ceremony due to his family commitments.[7] 
Mike and his wife Michele (née Rowe) have two sons, Ryan and Michael.[2]
