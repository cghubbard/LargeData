The Southeastern Conference (SEC) is an American college athletic conference 
whose member institutions are located primarily in the Southern part of 
the United States. Its fourteen members include the flagship public universities 
of ten states, three additional public land grant universities, and one 
private research university. The conference is headquartered in Birmingham, 
Alabama. The SEC participates in the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
(NCAA) Division I in sports competitions; for football, it is part of the 
Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A. The SEC 
is regarded as one of the most accomplished sports conferences in terms 
of its winning reputation, with 37 national football championships, 21 
basketball championships, 41 indoor track championships, 42 outdoor track 
championships, 24 swimming championships, and 20 gymnastics championships. 
The conference is also highly successful financially, as it consistently 
leads most others in revenue distribution to its members, including an 
SEC record $455.8 million for the 2014–15 fiscal year,[2] which was a sizable 
increase over the $292.8 million for the 2013–14 fiscal year,[3] largely 
due to the revenue from the introduction of the SEC Network. The SEC was 
also the first NCAA Division I conference to hold a championship game (and 
award a subsequent title) for college football and was one of the founding 
members of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The current SEC commissioner 
is Greg Sankey. The conference sponsors team championships in nine men's 
sports and twelve women's sports. The SEC consists of 14 member institutions 
located within the borders of 11 contiguous states. Listed in alphabetical 
order, these 11 states within the SEC's geographical footprint are Alabama, 
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, 
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. The geographic domain of the conference 
is predominantly within the Southeastern and Southern United States (with 
the notable exception of the border states of Kentucky and Missouri), and 
stretches from Texas in the west to South Carolina in the east and from 
Missouri in the north to Florida in the south. The SEC is divided into 
East and West Divisions although the divisional labels are misnomers[4] 
given Missouri's East Division alignment while being located in the west 
geographically, and Auburn's West Division alignment despite being located 
considerably further east than Missouri and Vanderbilt. These divisional 
groupings are applied exclusively to football and baseball as well as their 
scheduling and standings. Since July 1, 2012, the 14 members of the SEC 
are: The SEC was established on December 8 and 9, 1932, when the thirteen 
members of the Southern Conference located west and south of the Appalachian 
Mountains left to form their own conference. Ten of the thirteen founding 
members have remained in the conference since its inception: the University 
of Alabama, Auburn University, the University of Florida, the University 
of Georgia, the University of Kentucky, Louisiana State University ("LSU"), 
the University of Mississippi ("Ole Miss"), Mississippi State University, 
the University of Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University. The other charter 
members were: In 1990, the SEC expanded from ten to twelve member universities 
with the addition of the Arkansas Razorbacks and the South Carolina Gamecocks. 
The two new members began SEC competition with the 1991–1992 basketball 
season. At the same time, the SEC organized competition for some sports 
into two divisions. The Western Division comprised six of the seven member 
schools in the Central Time Zone, while the Eastern Division comprised 
the five member schools in the Eastern Time Zone plus Vanderbilt, which 
is in the Central Time Zone but was placed in the Eastern Division to preserve 
its rivalry with Tennessee. Initially, the divisional format was used in 
football, baseball, and men's basketball. The divisional format was dropped 
for men's basketball following the 2011–2012 season. Following expansion, 
the SEC was the first conference to receive permission from the NCAA to 
sponsor an annual football championship game, featuring the winners of 
the conference's Eastern and Western divisions.[7] The 1992 and 1993 championship 
games were held at Legion Field in Birmingham, and all championship games 
from 1994 onward have been held at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.[7] On September 
25, 2011, the SEC Presidents and Chancellors, acting unanimously, announced 
that Texas A&M University would join the SEC effective July 1, 2012, with 
Texas A&M to begin competition in nineteen of the twenty sports sponsored 
by the SEC during the 2012–13 academic year.[8] On November 6, 2011 the 
SEC commissioner announced that the University of Missouri would also join 
the SEC on July 1, 2012.[9] For football, Texas A&M was scheduled to compete 
in the Western Division, and Missouri in the Eastern Division.[10][11][12][13] 
Texas A&M and Missouri both left the Big 12 Conference. The office of Commissioner 
was created in 1940.[14] Under the leadership of Michael F. Adams the then 
President of the University of Georgia and chair of SEC Presidents and 
Chancellors, the member institutions of the Southeastern Conference joined 
forces in 2005 to form the SEC Academic Consortium (SECAC), a collaborative 
endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship, and achievement amongst 
the universities.[15] In 2011, the SEC Academic Consortium was relocated 
to the SEC headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama, from its original home 
on the campus of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas and 
was renamed SECU. The SECU rebranded its mission to better serve as a means 
through which the collaborative academic endeavors and achievements of 
Southeastern Conference universities would be promoted and advanced. The 
SECU's goals included highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC 
faculty, students and its universities; advancing the academic reputation 
of SEC universities; identifying and preparing future leaders for high-level 
service in academia; increasing the amount and type of study abroad opportunities 
available for students; and providing opportunities for collaboration among 
SEC university personnel.[16][17] The Big Ten Conference has a similar 
program called the Big Ten Academic Alliance. The SEC Symposium component 
of SECU was crafted by Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos, 
who at the time was the Vice President of the SEC Executive Committee and 
liaison to SECU.[18] In an interview with Dr. Zeppos about the formation 
of the SECU he noted, "that the member institutions of the Southeastern 
Conference are committed to a shared mission of fostering research, scholarship, 
and achievement. The SEC Symposium represents a platform to connect, collaborate 
and promote a productive dialogue that will span disciplinary and institutional 
boundaries and allow us to work together for the betterment of society."[19] 
The SEC Academic Network was created in 2009 in partnership with ESPN. 
The SEC Academic Network was an online library of institutionally produced 
videos featuring academic initiatives and stories from all Southeastern 
Conference institutions. The SEC Academic Network was officially merged 
into the SECU operation.[20] There are several programs that have been 
implemented under SECU.[21] The SEC Academic Leadership Development Program 
seeks to identify, prepare, and advance academic leaders for roles within 
SEC institutions and beyond. It has two components, a university-level 
program and two three-day, SEC-wide workshops held on specified campuses 
for all participants. The SEC Faculty Achievement and Professor of the 
Year Awards recognize faculty with outstanding records in research and 
scholarship. There is one winner per campus and one overall winner for 
the Conference. The SEC Faculty Travel Grant Program is intended to enhance 
collaboration that stimulates scholarly initiatives between SEC universities. 
The program offers faculty from each SEC university the opportunity to 
travel to other SEC universities to develop grant proposals and conduct 
research. The SEC College Tour occurs each spring, and administrators from 
all SEC universities participate in events intended to introduce SEC universities 
to students, parents, and high school counselors from outside of the Southeast 
region. The SEC Symposium is an academic conference-type event intended 
to address a scholarly issue in an area of strength represented by all 
SEC universities. Held in Atlanta, this marquee event puts on display the 
research and innovation of SEC institutions for an audience of academicians, 
government officials, grant funding agents, and other stakeholders. In 
2013, the SEC Symposium was organized and led by the University of Georgia 
and the UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute. The topic of the Symposium 
was titled, the "Impact of the Southeast in the World's Renewable Energy 
Future".[22] The SEC Cooperative Education Abroad Agreement provides opportunities 
for students from all SEC universities to access international programs 
offered at other SEC universities. As part of a renewable agreement, Italian 
engineering students from the Politecnico di Torino (PdT) have the opportunity 
to enroll at SEC universities each fall, and engineering SEC students may 
study there the following spring. The SEC MBA Case Competition are graduate 
level competitions provide an opportunity for SEC business schools to showcase 
their students' skills at solving simulated, real-world problems that cover 
the spectrum of business disciplines (e.g., organizational dynamics, budgeting, 
capitalization, competitive environment, etc.). The competition is held 
on one SEC campus and teams of four MBA students compete against other 
SEC teams, the best receiving various awards and recognition. The event 
is generally in April. The SEC University Collaboration Program gives university 
personnel groups (e.g., deans of colleges, chief financial officers, etc.) 
a mechanism to share best practices and ideas. Regular meetings and workshops 
are held university campuses, the Conference office or other similar locations. 
The International/Education Abroad Activities program was established as 
a part of a renewable agreement. Italian engineering students enroll at 
SEC universities each fall, and engineering SEC students study in Italy 
each spring (i.e., February to July) at the Politecnico di Torino. In addition, 
by utilizing a cooperative programming agreement, students from all SEC 
universities have access to education abroad programs offered at other 
SEC universities. Four SEC institutions are members of the prestigious 
Association of American Universities: Florida, Missouri, Texas A&M and 
Vanderbilt. Prior to the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M from the Big 
12, the SEC had the fewest AAU members among Power 5 conferences. The Big 
12, which had seven AAU members prior to the departure of Colorado, Missouri, 
Nebraska (expelled in 2011 after it joined the Big Ten) and Texas A&M, 
is down to three. By comparison, every Big Ten member except Nebraska is 
an AAU member. Total revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, 
rights/licensing, student fees, school funds, and all other sources including 
TV income, camp income, food, and novelties. Total expenses includes coaching/staff, 
scholarships, buildings/grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, 
and all other costs including recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, 
conference dues, and insurance costs. The Southeastern Conference sponsors 
championship competition in nine men's and twelve women's NCAA sanctioned 
sports.[26] Under SEC conference rules reflecting the large number of male 
scholarship participants in football and attempting to address gender equity 
concerns (see also Title IX), each member institution is required to provide 
two more women's varsity sports than men's. A similar rule was recently 
adopted by the NCAA for all of Division I.[27][28] Men's varsity sports 
not sponsored by the Southeastern Conference which are played by SEC schools: 
Women's varsity sports not sponsored by the Southeastern Conference which

see 2016 Southeastern Conference football season. SEC teams did not play 
a uniform number of conference games until 1982. Prior to that the number 
of conference games teams played ranged from 4 to 8, but most played a 
6 or 7 game schedule. The league adopted a uniform 6 game schedule from 
1982–1987, and added a 7th conference game from 1988 to 1991. Through this 
period and through the earlier years each SEC school had 5 permanent opponents, 
developing some traditional rivalries between schools, and the other games 
rotated around the other members of the conference. After expansion to 
twelve programs in 1992, the SEC went to an 8-game conference schedule, 
with each team playing the five other teams in their division and three 
opponents from the other division. The winners of the two divisions would 
then meet in the SEC Championship Game. From 1992 through 2002, each team 
had two permanent inter-divisional opponents, allowing many traditional 
rivalries from the pre-expansion era (such as Florida vs. Auburn, Kentucky 
vs. LSU, and Vanderbilt vs. Alabama) to continue. However, complaints from 
some league athletic directors about imbalance in the schedule (for instance, 
Auburn's two permanent opponents from the East were Florida and Georgia 
– two of the SEC's stronger football programs at the time – while Mississippi 
State played Kentucky and South Carolina every year) led to the SEC reducing 
the number of permanent inter-division opponents to one starting in the 
2003 season. The TV networks televising SEC games were also pressuring 
for the change so attractive match-ups between non-traditional opponents 
would occur 2 of every 5 years instead of happening 2 of every 8 years. 
With the subsequent expansion to 14 members in 2012, non-permanent cross-division 
opponents face each other in the regular season twice in a span of 12 years. 
Under the current format, each school plays a total of eight conference 
games, consisting of the other six teams in its division, one school from 
the other division on a rotating basis, and one school from the other division 
that it plays each year. The current scheduling arrangement was originally 
set to expire after the 2015 season, but the SEC presidents voted 10–4[30] 
in April 2014 to keep the current format for an additional six to eight 
seasons beyond 2015.[31] Additionally, beginning in 2016, SEC teams will 
be required to schedule at least one opponent each season from the other 
so-called "Power Five" conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, or Pac-12); games 
against football independent schools also qualify, including Army, BYU, 
and Notre Dame.[31][32][33] The following table shows the current permanent 
inter-divisional opponent for each school listed by total number of games 
played (records through week 11 of the 2015 season with West Division wins 
listed first):[34] Through end of the 2015 season. Records reflect official 
NCAA results, including any forfeits or win vacating. Source: College Football 
Data Warehouse.[42] Alabama's record reflects 21 wins being vacated (2005–2007) 
and 8 wins and 1 tied forfeited (1993). Mississippi State's record reflects 
18 wins and 1 tie being forfeited (1975–1977). The SEC Championship Game 
pits the SEC Western Division representative against the Eastern Division 
representative in a game held after the regular season has been completed. 
The first two SEC Championship football games were held at Legion Field 
in Birmingham, Alabama. Since 1994, the game has been played at the Georgia 
Dome in Atlanta. The team designated as the "home" team alternates between 
division champions; the designation goes to the East champion in even-numbered 
years and the West champion in odd-numbered years. As of 2015, the West 
division leads in overall wins in the championship game against the East 
division, 13 to 11. The post-season bowl game tie-ins for the SEC for the 
2014–2019 seasons are:[43] Payout is per team for the 2014 season; if different 
for opposing conference, payout for the SEC team is shown. Each conference 
member, irrespective of bowl participation, also receives an equal split 
of a payout to the SEC conference.[44][45][46] ^ The Sugar Bowl is contractually 
obligated to select the SEC champion if that team is not participating 
in the College Football Playoff. In years where the champion is unavailable 
the Playoff Committee will assign another SEC team to participate in the 
Sugar. Alternatively, in years where the Sugar hosts a playoff game the 
SEC Champion will be sent to the Fiesta, Cotton, or Peach Bowl if not selected 
for the playoff. † The Big Ten and SEC will be eligible to face the ACC 
representative in the Orange Bowl at least three out of the eight seasons 
that it does not host a semifinal for the Playoff over a 12-year span. 
Notre Dame may be chosen the other two years if eligible. ° In years when 
the Big Ten places a team in the Orange Bowl, the Citrus Bowl will select 
from ACC teams remaining after the Playoff Committee and Orange Bowl make 
their selections. ‡ The Big Ten and ACC will switch between the Music City 
and TaxSlayer bowls on alternating years. The total pay of head coaches 
includes university and non-university compensation. This includes base 
salary, income from contracts, foundation supplements, bonuses and media 
and radio pay.[47] Each year, the conference selects various individual 
awards. In 1994, the conference began honoring former players from each 
school annually with the SEC Football Legends program. In 1982, the SEC 
Skywriters, a group of media covering the Southeastern Conference, selected 
members of their All-Time SEC Team for the first fifty years (1933–82) 
of the SEC.[50] Coach: Paul "Bear" Bryant Offense QB Archie Manning, Ole

Conference men's basketball season. Since the 2012–13 season, SEC teams 
have played an 18-game conference schedule. Before expansion to 14 teams, 
the conference schedule was 16 games. Although the divisions were eliminated 
beginning with the 2011–12 season, that season's schedule was still set 
according to the divisional alignments, with each team facing each team 
from its own division twice and each team from the opposite division once. 
As part of the proposal by SEC head coaches that led to the scrapping of 
the divisional structure, a task force of four coaches and four athletic 
directors was set to discuss future conference scheduling. At that time, 
options included a revamped 16-game schedule, an 18-game schedule, or a 
full double round-robin of 22 conference games.[51] However, these discussions 
came before Texas A&M and Missouri were announced in late 2011 as incoming 
members for the 2012–13 season. At the 2012 SEC spring meetings, league 
athletic directors adopted an 18-game conference schedule. Each school 
had one permanent opponent that it played home and away every season, and 
faced four other opponents in a home-and-home series during a given season, 
and then the remaining teams one each (four home, four away). The permanent 
opponents were Alabama-Auburn, Arkansas-Missouri, Florida-Kentucky, Georgia-South 
Carolina, LSU-Texas A&M, Ole Miss-Mississippi State, and Tennessee-Vanderbilt. 
The home-and-home opponents, apart from the permanent opponent, rotated 
each season.[52] The 2014 SEC spring meetings saw a change to the scheduling 
format. While the athletic directors voted to stay with an 18-game conference 
schedule, they increased the number of permanent opponents for each school 
from one to three. Each school will retain its permanent opponent from 
the 2012–2014 period. Further details of the new scheduling format, including 
the complete list of permanent opponents, have yet to be finalized.[53] 
Before the 1990 expansion to 12 schools, teams played a double round-robin, 
leading to an exhausting 18-game conference schedule. Not surprisingly, 
no team ever ran the table when the conference schedule featured 18 games; 
three teams went 17–1 (Kentucky in 1970 and 1986, LSU in 1981). During 
the period from 1992 to 2012 when the league slate was 16 games, Kentucky 
went undefeated in SEC play in 1996, 2003, and 2012 (although only the 
2003 team went on to win the conference tournament). Since the return to 
an 18-game conference schedule following the 2012 conference expansion, 
two teams have gone undefeated in SEC play: Florida in 2013–14 and Kentucky 
in 2014–15. The new SEC coordinator of basketball officials for 2013–14 
was announced as Dr. Robert "Jake" Bell. Bell is a former SEC and NCAA 
tournament official. He lives in Lexington, Kentucky.[54] The SEC Men's 
Basketball Tournament (also known simply as the SEC Tournament) is the 
competition that determines the SEC's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball 
tournament. Notably, it does not determine the SEC conference champion 
in men's basketball—the conference has awarded its championship to the 
team(s) with the best regular-season record since the 1950–51 season.[55] 
It is a single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season 
records. With the expansion to 14 members in 2012, the 2013 tournament 
was the first with a new format covering five days. The teams seeded 11 
through 14 play on the first day, with the winners advancing to play the 
No. 5 and 6 seeds on Thursday. The top four teams receive a "double bye" 
and do not play until the quarterfinals on Friday. As of the most recently 
completed 2015–16 season, the tournament has most often been held at two 
venues that have each hosted 12 times. Louisville Gardens in Louisville, 
Kentucky served as the regular host from 1941 until the tournament was 
discontinued after the 1952 edition. The Georgia Dome in Atlanta first 
hosted the tournament in 1995 and most recently hosted in 2014. Bridgestone 
Arena in Nashville, Tennessee is now the regular host, with that venue 
hosting the tournament from 2015 through 2025, except in 2018 and 2022 
(years in which it will instead host the SEC women's basketball tournament).[56] 
Sometimes, the tournament will take place at the Smoothie King Center in 
New Orleans, or Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida. During the two seasons 
in the 2015–2025 period in which Nashville will not host the men's tournament, 
it will be held at Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri in 2018 and 
Amalie Arena in 2022.[57] Prior to moving to the Georgia Dome, the tournament 
(during its modern, post-1979 era) was most often contested at the Birmingham-Jefferson 
Civic Center, home of the SEC's headquarters and centrally located prior 
to the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina. Other sites to host include 
on-campus arenas at LSU, Tennessee and Vanderbilt; Rupp Arena in Lexington; 
and the Orlando Arena. † denotes overtime games. Multiple †'s indicate 
more than one overtime. The SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year is 
awarded to the player who has proven himself, throughout the season, to 
be the most exceptional talent in the Southeastern Conference. Various 
other awards, such as the best tournament player in the SEC Tournament 
and all conference honors are given out throughout the year. Schools play 
a 30-game league schedule (10 three-game series). From 1996 through 2012, 
schools played all five schools within their division and five of the six 
schools from the opposite division. With the addition of Missouri and Texas 
A&M, schools will now miss three opponents from the opposite division in 
a given season. Since 1990, the SEC has become the most successful conference 
on the college baseball diamond. That year, Georgia captured the conference's 
first national championship at the College World Series. Following that, 
LSU won 6 of the next 19 titles, including 5 of 10 between 1991 and 2000 
and its sixth title in 2009. This was followed by South Carolina winning 
back to back titles in 2010 and 2011, and then by Vanderbilt winning its 
first title in 2014. During that same span, eight teams have also been 
runners-up at the CWS. In 1997 and 2011 the CWS final series involved two 
SEC teams. The only current SEC member that has never appeared in the CWS 
is Kentucky. Missouri and Texas A&M have not made the CWS as SEC members, 
but both have made appearances while in other conferences. Both Georgia 
Tech and Tulane have made appearances in the CWS after leaving the SEC. 
SEC teams have also become leaders in total and average attendance over 
the years. In 2010 five of the top six drawing programs hailed from the 
SEC. Six more teams placed in the top 35 nationally. The NCAA automatic 
berth is given to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, which was 
first started in 1977. It is a double-elimination tournament and seeding 
is based on regular season records. Since 1998, the tournament has been 
held at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in Hoover, Alabama and contested under 
the format used at the College World Series from 1988 through 2002, with 
two four-team brackets leading to a single championship game. The winner 
receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Division I Baseball 
Tournament. SEC presidents and athletic directors voted to expand the SEC 
Tournament to 10 teams starting in 2012. The division winners will receive 
a bye on the first day of competition, and the tournament will become single-elimination 
after the field is pared to four teams. In addition to the winner of the 
SEC Baseball Tournament, the Southeastern Conference usually gets several 
at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament. Many teams have qualified for the 
NCAA Tournament despite failing to qualify for the SEC Tournament. One 
of those, Mississippi State, reached the College World Series in 2007. 
Note: Teams in bold are current SEC members who advanced to the CWS while 
in the conference. Teams in bold italics are current SEC members who were 
in another conference at the time of their appearance. Several baseball 
rivalries have developed in the SEC: The SEC has historically been the 
most dominant conference in women's basketball.[58] Since the 2009–10 season, 
teams have played a 16-game conference schedule with a single league table; 
prior to that time the conference schedule was 14 games, again in a single 
table.[59] Like SEC men's basketball, women's basketball used the divisional 
alignment for scheduling purposes through the 2011–12 season; however, 
the women's scheduling format was significantly different from the men's. 
Each team played home-and-home games against five schools—one permanent 
opponent, two teams from the same division, and two teams from the opposite 
division; the non-permanent home-and-home opponents rotated every two years.[60] 
The remaining games were single games against the six other schools in 
the conference, with three at home and three away. The league voted to 
keep a 16-game league schedule even after the addition of Missouri and 
Texas A&M. Arkansas and LSU are no longer permanent opponents, with the 
Razorbacks picking up Missouri and the Lady Tigers picking up Texas A&M. 
The other permanent opponents are the same as men's basketball, except 
for Florida-Georgia and Kentucky-South Carolina (both pairs had been permanent 
women's basketball opponents before the 2012 expansion). Each school plays 
two others home-and-home during a given season and the other 10 once each. 
The divisional alignments no longer play any role in scheduling.[61] The 
recent history of SEC women's basketball is dominated by Tennessee, who 
have won regular season and/or conference tournament championships in 20 
of the last 22 seasons, as well as 8 national championships since 1987. 
In the 28 seasons the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship has 
been held, SEC schools have reached the Final Four 32 times, more than 
twice as often as any other conference.[62] The SEC Women's Basketball 
Tournament is currently held a week before the men's basketball tournament. 
Like the men's version, it is a single-elimination tournament involving 
all conference members, with seeding based on regular season records. With 
the expansion to 14 schools, the bottom four teams in the conference standings 
play opening-round games, and the top four receive "double byes" into the 
quarterfinals. The winner earns the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA 
women's basketball tournament. Also paralleling the men's tournament, the 
women's tournament does not determine the SEC champion; that honor has 
been awarded based on regular-season record since the 1985–86 season.[63] 
The tournament, inaugurated in 1980, was originally held on campus sites; 
the first tournament to take place at a neutral site was in 1987. The two 
most frequent sites for the tournament have been McKenzie Arena in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee (seven times) and the Albany Civic Center in Albany, Georgia 
(six times); however, the tournament was last played in Albany in 1992 
and Chattanooga in 2000. Because demand for women's tournament tickets 
is generally lower than for the men's tournament, it is typically played 
in a smaller venue than the men's tournament in the same season. The most 
frequent venues since 2000 have been Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (five 
times), Infinite Energy Arena in Duluth, Georgia (four), and Verizon Arena 
in North Little Rock, Arkansas (four). † denotes overtime games. Multiple 
†'s indicate more than one overtime. Besides football, basketball, and 
baseball, there are a number of other sports in which the Southeastern 
Conference actively competes. Since the SEC's founding in December 1932, 
the varsity athletic teams of its current 14 members have won over 200 
national team sports championships. The following is the list of the national 
team championships claimed by current SEC member schools, including those 
tournament championships currently or formerly sponsored by the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).[65][66] The NCAA has never sponsored 
a tournament championship for major college football, the championship 
game for which is currently part of the College Football Playoff (CFP) 
system. Prior to 1992, championships for major college football were determined 
by a "consensus" of major polling services, including the Associated Press 
and United Press International college football polls. Recognized women's 
championships from 1972 to 1982 were administered by the Association for 
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), not the NCAA. There was a one-year 
overlap period during the 1981–82 school year, when both the AIAW and the 
NCAA operated women's championship tournaments; since 1982, only the NCAA 
has sponsored women's championship tournaments. National equestrian tournament 
championships are currently sponsored by the National Collegiate Equestrian 
Association (NCEA), not the NCAA. Those national championships dating from 
before 1933 predate the founding of the SEC in December 1932; championships 
won by Arkansas and South Carolina before the 1992–93 school year predate 
their membership in the SEC; championships won by Missouri and Texas A&M 
before the 2012–13 school year predate their membership in the SEC. Football

The fourteen members of the Southeastern Conference claim over 200 national 
team championships in sports currently or formerly sponsored by conference 
members. The following totals include national team championships sponsored 
by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) from 1906 to the 
present, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) 
from 1972 to 1982, and, in football, the Bowl Alliance, Bowl Coalition, 
Bowl Championship Series (BCS) and College Football Playoff (CFP) since 
1992, as well as consensus national championships determined by the major 
football polls prior to 1992. The following totals include national team 
tournament championships sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) from 1906 to the present and the Association for Intercollegiate 
Athletics for Women (AIAW) from 1972 to 1982. The NCAA did not sponsor 
tournament championships in women's sports before the 1981–82 academic 
year, and the NCAA has never sponsored a national championship playoff 
or tournament in major college football. To date, the fourteen members 
of the SEC have won 212 NCAA and four AIAW championships,[67] including: 
The SEC televises football games across various networks during the fall. 
SEC coverage is primarily provided by CBS and the ESPN family of networks, 
which includes ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, and ABC. Fox Sports Networks also has 
rights to air seven live football games over the course of the season.[68] 
ESPN reported paying $2.25 billion for broadcast rights of SEC football 
games beginning in the 2009 season and running through fiscal year 2025.[69] 
Games scheduled for airing are generally picked two weeks before they occur, 
with a few matches that are selected by CBS and ESPN prior to the season.[citation 
needed] CBS has the first pick for a game and selects the highest-profile 
game to broadcast to a national, over-the-air audience. The CBS game is 
usually broadcast at 3:30 Eastern. Some weekends, CBS will air a doubleheader 
of SEC games.[70] CBS also has the rights for the SEC Championship Game. 
ESPN will air several SEC games each week among its various channels, with 
Saturday time slots generally at 12:00 ET, 7:00 ET, and 7:45 ET, and some 
SEC games will be shown on Thursday nights. In previous years, Raycom Sports 
(and before it, Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial Sports) syndicated regional 
coverage for an SEC game of the week at 12:30 ET, but the new contract 
replaced it with a new ESPN-produced syndication package, the SEC Network—whose 
football games kickoff at 12:21 ET.[71] The currently scheduled Fox Sports 
Net games are set for 7:00 ET.[72] For games not selected by any broadcast 
provider, certain schools may offer regional pay-per-view. As of 2008, 
all SEC schools are affiliated with XM Radio, offering their radio broadcasts 
to an audience on XM. According to SiriusXM, the SEC will not be included 
as part of the "Best of XM" package deal for Sirius customers. During the 
2007–2008 fiscal year review meeting, there was discussion among SEC leadership 
about the possibility of starting a TV network dedicated to its conference, 
much in the same way the Mountain West Conference and Big Ten Conference 
have done with the mtn. and Big Ten Networks, respectively. A decision 
was made to postpone the decision until at least the following year.[73] 
In August 2008, the SEC announced an unprecedented 15-year television contract 
with CBS worth an estimated $55 million a year. This continues the relationship 
the SEC already has with CBS, which puts the SEC in the unique position 
as the only conference to have its own exclusive national television network 
of the four major over-the-air broadcast networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox) 
to display the SEC's events.[7] In the same month, the league also announced 
another landmark television contract with ESPN worth $2.25 billion or $150 
million a year for the life of the contract, which is for fifteen years. 
It is the longest and wealthiest contract among all television deals among 
the major conferences. With these contracts, the SEC had, at the time of 
the deal, the richest television deals in the country outside the Big Ten 
and helped make the SEC one of the most nationally televised and visible 
conferences in the country with the coverage that was provided by these 
contracts.[74][75] The SEC Network is a television and multimedia network 
that features exclusively Southeastern Conference content through a partnership 
between ESPN and the SEC.[76] The network launched on August 14, 2014 with 
the first live football game scheduled for two weeks later between Texas 
A&M and South Carolina on Thursday, August 28 in Columbia, South Carolina[77] 
The network is part of a deal between the Southeastern Conference and ESPN 
which is a 20-year agreement, beginning in August 2014 and running through 
2034. The agreement served to create and operate a new multiplatform television 
network and accompanying digital platform in the hope of increasing revenue 
for member institutions and expanding the reach of the Southeastern Conference. 
The Southeastern Conference sponsors nine men's sports and twelve women's
