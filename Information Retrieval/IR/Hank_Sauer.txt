Henry John "Hank" Sauer (March 17, 1917 – August 24, 2001) was a left fielder 
in Major League Baseball. From 1941 through 1959, Sauer played for the 
Cincinnati Reds (1941–42, 1945, 1948–49), Chicago Cubs (1949–55), St. Louis 
Cardinals (1956), New York Giants (1957) and San Francisco Giants (1958–59). 
He batted and threw right-handed. He and Johnny Bench are the only players 
in major league history ever to have hit three home runs in a single game 
twice against the same pitcher. He did it 1950 and 1952 while with the 
Chicago Cubs, both times against Philadelphia's Curt Simmons. In a 15-season 
career, Sauer was a .266 hitter with 288 home runs and 876 RBIs in 1399 
games. A native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Sauer started his major league 
career with the Reds in 1941, and was traded to the Cubs midway through 
the 1949 season. A two-time All-Star, Sauer was a feared slugger for the 
Cubs in the early 1950s, hitting over 30 home runs in six seasons, with 
a career-high 41 in 1954. His most productive season came in 1952, when 
he led the National League in home runs (37) and RBIs (121), and was named 
the Most Valuable Player. During a time when the Cubs were especially moribund, 
Sauer provided some joy for the team's fans with his power hitting, earning 
him the nickname "The Mayor of Wrigley Field". He was well known for using 
smokeless tobacco, and it has often been reported that after he hit a home 
run, when he returned to his left field position, bleacher fans might shower 
him with packets of his favorite chew, Beech Nut tobacco. Sauer was not 
especially fleet afoot. In contrast to radio's Quiz Kids or the 1950 Phillies 
"Whiz Kids", according to Chicago columnist Mike Royko the 1950s Cubs had 
an outfield "that was so slow they were known as the Quicksand Kids." Sauer, 
Frank Baumholtz and Ralph Kiner played left, center and right fields respectively.

In 1955, Sauer tried to hold out for a bigger contract for the Cubs, but 
was released. A year later, he played with the Cardinals and finished with 
the Giants in 1959. Sauer died of a heart attack while playing golf in
