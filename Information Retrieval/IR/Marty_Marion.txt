As player As manager Martin Whiteford Marion (December 1, 1917 – March 
15, 2011)[1] was an American professional baseball player and manager. 
He played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball from 1940 to 1953. Marion 
played with the St. Louis Cardinals for the majority of his career before 
ending with the St. Louis Browns as a player-manager. He later became the 
manager of the Chicago White Sox. Marion was born in Richburg, South Carolina. 
He grew up in Atlanta, where he attended Tech High School and played baseball 
for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets.[2][3] His older brother, Red Marion, 
was briefly an outfielder in the American League and a long-time manager 
in the minor leagues. Nicknamed "Slats", Marion had unusually long arms 
which reached for grounders like tentacles, prompting sportwriters to call 
him "The Octopus". From 1940-50, Marion led the National League shortstops 
in fielding percentage four times, despite several other players being 
moved around the infield during these years. In 1941 he played all 154 
games at shortstop (also a league-high) and in 1947 he made only 15 errors 
for a consistent .981 percentage. Marion was also a better-than-average 
hitter for a shortstop. His most productive season came in 1942, when he 
hit .276 with a league-leading 38 doubles. In the 1942 World Series, one 
of four series in which he participated with the Cardinals, he helped his 
team to a World Championship. In 1943 he batted a career-high .280 in the 
regular season and hit .357 in the 1943 World Series. He played with many 
second basemen throughout his career, including Frank "Creepy" Crespi. 
Marion commented after the '41 season that Crespi's play was the best he 
ever saw by a second baseman. Crespi once took on Joe Medwick on the field 
(during a game) when he was trying to intimidate Marion. They remained 
friends until Crespi's death in 1990. In 1951 Marion managed the Cardinals 
and was replaced by Eddie Stanky at the end of the season. He moved to 
the American League Browns and took over for manager Rogers Hornsby early 
in 1952 as their player-manager. The last manager in St. Louis Browns history, 
he was let go after the 1953 season when the Browns moved to Baltimore. 
He then signed as a coach for the White Sox for the 1954 campaign and was 
promoted to manager that September, when skipper Paul Richards left Chicago 
to become field manager and general manager in Baltimore. Marion led the 
White Sox for two and half seasons, finishing third each time, before he 
stepped down at the end of the 1956 season. In 1958, Marion purchased the 
Double-A minor league Houston Buffaloes from the St. Louis Cardinals, and 
successfully moved the team to the Triple-A level under the Chicago Cubs 
farm system.[4] He later sold the team to a group led by William Hopkins 
on August 16, 1960.[5] Hopkins then sold the team to the Houston Sports 
Association led by Roy Hofheinz who had obtained a major league franchise 
in the National League which became the Houston Astros.[6] In a 13-season 
career, Marion posted a .263 batting average with 36 home runs and 624 
RBI in 1572 games. He made All-Star Game appearances from 1943–44 and 1946–1950 
(There was no All-Star Game in 1945). In 1944 he earned the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award. As a manager, he compiled a 356-372 record. 
Marion died of an apparent heart attack on March 15, 2011. He lived in
