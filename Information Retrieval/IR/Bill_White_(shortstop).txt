William Dighton White (May 1, 1860 – December 29, 1924), was a professional 
baseball player who was mainly a shortstop in the Major Leagues for five 
seasons from 1883 to 1888. During his Major League career, he played for 
three different franchises: the Pittsburg Alleghenys in 1884, the Louisville 
Colonels from 1886 to 1888, and the St. Louis Browns, also in 1888. He 
led the American Association (AA) in putouts among shortstops for three 
consecutive seasons, from 1886–1888, and 1887, he led all AA shortstops 
in assists and double plays as well. He was a member of the St. Louis Browns 
when they were champions of the AA, and went to face the New York Giants 
in a post-season exhibition set of game, known as the "World Series". Although 
the Browns lost the 10 game series, White played in every game. White was 
born on May 1, 1860 in Bridgeport, Ohio, and he began his professional 
baseball career in 1883 with the Pottsville Antharcites of the International 
Association.[1][2] During that season he is credited with making an appearance 
with the Philadelphia Quakers of the National League, which consisted of 
one at bat without collecting a hit.[1] In 1884, he signed with the Pittsburg 
Alleghenys of the American Association (AA), and played in 74 games, 60 
of which were at shortstop; he had a batting average of .227 and ten triples 
in 291 at bats.[1] That season, he also played for the Springfield team 
in the Ohio State League.[2] For the 1885 season, he remained in the minor 
leagues, playing for the Washington Nationals of the Eastern League.[2] 
In 1886, White signed a contract with Louisville Colonels of the AA, which 
paid him $2000 for the season.[3] His 143 hits in 135 games that season 
were his career high totals, as well as his 96 runs, and 17 doubles.[3] 
He led the AA in putouts for a shortstop for the first time in his career, 
and on October 9, against Bill Hart of the Philadelphia Athletics, he hit 
the first of his six career home runs.[3][4] Staying in Louisville for 
the 1887 season, White continued as their starting shortstop, and again 
led the AA in putouts, as well as assists and double plays in 132 games 
played.[3] He began the 1888 season with the Colonels, playing in 49 games 
before moving at midseason to play for the St. Louis Browns, and led the 
AA in putouts for third time.[3] At the conclusion of the season, the Browns 
went on to play the National League champion New York Giants in a set of 
exhibition games called the "World Series".[5] In ten game, the Giants 
defeated the Browns six games to four, and White participated in all 10 
games, but had a .143 batting average however.[5] White returned to the 
minor leagues after the 1888 season, and play for the Denver Grizzlies/Mountaineers 
of the Western Association in 1889, 1890, and partially in 1891.[2] He 
also played for the Minneapolis Millers, of the Western Association for 
the remainder of the 1891 season.[2] He began the 1892 season with the 
Butte representative in the Montana State League, however he later joined 
the Portland Webfeet of the Pacific Northwest League.[2] He moved on to 
play for the Augusta Electricians of the Southern Association for the 1893 
season, and then the Bangor Millionaires of the New England League for 
the 1894 season, his last as player.[2] After his playing days were over, 
White performed three different stints as the manager of minor league clubs 
in Wheeling, West Virginia.[2] The first took place for the 1896 Nailers 
of the Interstate League, then in 1901 for the Stogies of the Western Association, 
and finally for the 1905 Stogies of the Central League.[2] White died in
