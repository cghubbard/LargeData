Glenn Murray (born November 23, 1970) is a former outfielder from Manning, 
S.C., who made his Major League Baseball debut in 1996 with the Philadelphia 
Phillies. In his debut with the Philadelphia Phillies he collected his 
first hit against the Atlanta Braves. After playing 38 games he collected 
19 hits with 2 home runs and 6 runs batted in. Glenn Murray was drafted 
in the second round of the 1989 free-agent draft by the Montreal Expos. 
After spending several seasons in the Expos minor league system, Murray 
was traded by Montreal to the Red Sox on March 23, 1994 for Derek Vineyard. 
Murray's stay in the Red Sox organization lasted until January 1996 when 
the Boston Red Sox sent him, with Ken Ryan and Lee Tinsley, to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for Rick Holyfield, Heathcliff Slocumb and Larry Wimberly. Glenn 
Murray's last major league game came on July 24, 1996. In October of that 
season, Murray was claimed on waivers by the Cincinnati Reds. On May 20, 
1998, Glenn Murray was part of an unusual feat in baseball while playing 
for AAA Indianapolis Indians in a game against Pawtucket. In the 5th inning 
of the game, Pete Rose Jr. hit a solo home run, Jason Willims hit a 3-run 
home run, Murray added a grand slam, and Guillermo Garcia completed the 
"homer cycle" with a 2-run shot. The Indians won the game, 11-4. In 1999, 
Murray joined the Nashua Pride of the Atlantic League. He stayed there 
until 2006, the year that Nashua switched to the Can-Am League, though
