Jacoby McCabe Ellsbury (/dʒəˈkoʊbi/ jə-KOH-bee; born September 11, 1983) 
is an American professional baseball center fielder for the New York Yankees 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Boston Red Sox 
from 2007 through 2013, and joined the Yankees before the 2014 season. 
Ellsbury was first drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 23rd round 
of the 2002 MLB draft, but did not sign. He was drafted next as 23rd overall 
by the Red Sox in the 2005, after playing college baseball for three years 
at Oregon State University. Ellsbury is the only Red Sox player in history 
to be a member of the 30–30 club. In 2011, Ellsbury also won the Gold Glove 
Award, the Silver Slugger Award, and was the American League MVP runner-up 
to Justin Verlander.[1] Ellsbury is an enrolled member of the Colorado 
River Indian Tribes;[2] Ellsbury's mother, Margie, is full-blooded Navajo[3] 
and his father is of English and German descent.[4] Ellsbury is the first 
Native American of Navajo descent to reach the major leagues.[5] As of 
2008, he was one of three active non-Hispanic Native American players in 
Major League Baseball, along with Kyle Lohse and Joba Chamberlain.[6] Ellsbury 
was born on September 11, 1983, to Jim and Margie Ellsbury, and is the 
eldest of four children. His mother is a Navajo Native American, a descendant 
from 19th-century tribal leader Ganado Mucho. Her father Franklin McCabe 
was a silversmith and her mother a traditional rug weaver.[3] His father, 
Jim Ellsbury is of English and German descent.[7] The Ellsburys lived on 
the Warm Springs Indian Reservation until they moved to Madras, Oregon, 
when the boy was in kindergarten.[7] He was raised in the Mormon religion.[8] 
In Little League, Ellsbury often played with teammates up to three years 
older than him.[9] At Madras High School, he lettered in five sports.[8] 
In his senior year in baseball, he hit .537 with 65 stolen bases. In basketball, 
he averaged 23.6 points and 4.4 blocks per game. He finished his football 
career with nine interceptions and six kickoff returns for touchdowns. 
He went to Oregon State University where he was a Baseball America first-team 
All-American and Pac-10 Conference Co-Player of the year, with Trevor Crowe. 
He was drafted in the 1st round of the 2005 MLB draft by the Boston Red 
Sox.[10] Ellsbury began his professional career on July 14, 2005, with 
the Lowell Spinners in the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. On 
September 7, he tied a Lowell team record with three stolen bases in a 
single game. Ellsbury finished the season batting .317, with 23 stolen 
bases in 35 games.[11] Ellsbury began the 2006 season ranked as the sixth-best 
prospect in the Red Sox' organization according to Baseball America.[12] 
He started the season with the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Class A-Advanced 
Carolina League. On July 3, he tied a Wilmington franchise record by stealing 
four bases in a game.[13] After batting .299 with 25 steals in 61 games 
and being named to the 2006 Carolina League All-Star team, Ellsbury was 
promoted to the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League on July 
12.[14] Soon after his promotion to Portland, Ellsbury was named Eastern 
League Player of the Week for August 6–13, after batting .400 along with 
a home run, and hitting safely in seven straight games.[15] Ellsbury finished 
the season in Portland batting .308 with 16 steals in 50 games and the 
Red Sox selected him as their Minor League Defensive Player of the Year 
and Base Runner of the Year.[16] They assigned him to the Peoria Javelinas 
of the Arizona Fall League (AFL), an off-season developmental league for 
top prospects. In the AFL, Ellsbury hit .276 in 25 games, and his defensive 
skills were enough to earn him a spot in the AFL Rising Stars All-Star 
game.[17] Ellsbury participated in the Red Sox' 2007 spring training camp 
in Fort Myers, Florida, as a non-roster invitee and was assigned to the 
minor league camp on March 9.[18] He was rated the best prospect in the 
Red Sox' organization[19] and the 33rd-best prospect in baseball for 2007 
by Baseball America,[20] while Sports Illustrated ranked Ellsbury as the 
43rd-best prospect.[21] Ellsbury began the 2007 season as the starting 
center fielder for the Sea Dogs and was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox 
of the Class AAA International League on May 4 after batting .452 in 17 
games at Portland, and being named the Eastern League Player of the Month 
for April.[22] He was chosen to play in the 2007 All-Star Futures Game 
as part of the MLB All-Star festivities at AT&T Park in San Francisco.[23] 
On August 24, Ellsbury set a new consecutive-game hitting streak record 
for Pawtucket with 25, besting the consecutive-game mark of 19 previously 
shared by Dave Stapleton and Dave Berg[24] Ellsbury finished the season 
with 33 stolen bases for Pawtucket, which tied him for second in the International 
League with Darnell McDonald of the Rochester Red Wings, and one behind 
league leader Bernie Castro of the Columbus Clippers. Although Castro had 
34 steals in 118 games, and McDonald had 33 steals in 134 games, Ellsbury's 
33 steals came in 87 games.[11] For the second consecutive season, the 
Red Sox selected him as their minor league Defensive Player of the Year 
and Baserunner of the Year.[25] After Coco Crisp was injured, the Red Sox 
purchased Ellsbury's contract and he received a call-up on June 30, 2007, 
where he made his MLB debut in center field and hit ninth against the Texas 
Rangers at Fenway Park[26] wearing number 46. He recorded his first major 
league hit, an infield single off of Robinson Tejeda, in the bottom of 
the third inning of that game. His first career stolen base came off pitcher 
Brandon McCarthy and catcher Gerald Laird of the Rangers on July 2. He 
also scored from second base in that game on a wild pitch.[5][27] Johnny 
Pesky described the play as "the greatest single play I've ever seen in 
all my years in baseball".[28] He was optioned back to Pawtucket on July 
5 after serving in six games for the Red Sox.[29] On August 17, the Red 
Sox recalled Ellsbury from Pawtucket for the second game of a doubleheader, 
where he led off and played center field.[30] He was optioned back to Pawtucket 
after the game.[31] When major league rosters expanded to 40 players on 
September 1, he was a September call-up by the Red Sox.[32] On September 
2, he hit his first major league home run, a solo shot which landed in 
the Red Sox bullpen, in the bottom of the fourth inning run off Daniel 
Cabrera of the Baltimore Orioles.[33] A September 2007 article in The New 
York Times described him as a "cult hero" who brings "speed, improved defense, 
and unbridled enthusiasm."[34] Ellsbury was named MLB's American League 
Rookie of the Month for September 2007.[35] With fewer than 130 major league 
at-bats, he still qualified as a rookie for the 2008 season. During the 
2007 postseason, with Crisp struggling, Ellsbury started in center field 
for Game 6 of the 2007 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against 
the Cleveland Indians, and started the remainder of the postseason for 
the Red Sox. In 11 postseason games, he hit .360 in 25 at-bats with two 
stolen bases.[36] With his two doubles off Josh Fogg in the top of the 
third inning of Game 3 of the 2007 World Series on October 27, Ellsbury 
became the first rookie to hit two doubles in the same inning of a World 
Series game. After hitting another double off Brian Fuentes in the eighth 
inning, he became the fourth rookie ever to hit three doubles in a World 
Series game. His four hits, including a single in the first inning, made 
him only the third rookie to ever accomplish the feat in the World Series, 
after Freddie Lindstrom in the 1924 World Series and Joe Garagiola in the 
1946 World Series.[37] He batted .438 with four doubles and a stolen base 
for the World Series.[36] The Red Sox eventually won the World Series in 
a 4-game sweep over the Rockies, giving Ellsbury his first career championship 
title. Heading into the 2008 season, Ellsbury was ranked 13th-best prospect 
in baseball by Baseball America,[38] the 16th-best prospect by Baseball 
Prospectus,[39] and the 19th-best prospect by ESPN Scouts Inc.[40] Ellsbury 
hit .224, with .291 on-base percentage (OBP), and a .347 slugging percentage 
in 16 spring training games and started in center field on Opening Day 
of the 2008 Major League Baseball season against the Oakland Athletics 
on March 25 at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan.[41] Ellsbury had his first 
career multi-home run game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on 
April 22.[citation needed] Ellsbury stole 25 consecutive bases without 
being caught, until he was caught stealing in a game on May 18. He was 
two stolen bases shy of the major league record held by Tim Raines in 1979.[42] 
With three stolen bases against the Baltimore Orioles on May 30, he became 
the first Red Sox player to steal more than two bases in a game since Jerry 
Remy stole four in 1980.[43] Ellsbury stole his 32nd base of the season 
on June 15, breaking the Red Sox' rookie record, set 100 years earlier 
by Amby McConnell.[44] He finished the season with 50 steals to lead the 
American League,[36] putting him third on the list of Red Sox all-time 
stolen base leaders for a single season, behind Tommy Harper (54) in 1973 
and Tris Speaker (52) in 1912.[36] Ellsbury finished third in the AL Rookie 
of the Year voting, behind Evan Longoria of Tampa Bay and Alexei Ramírez 
of the Chicago White Sox.[45] Ellsbury hit .333, with a .400 OBP and a 
.567 slugging percentage, and three stolen bases in the 2008 American League 
Division Series (ALDS), in which the Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim, 3–1, in the best-of-five series.[36] In the second inning of 
Game 3 of the ALDS, he hit the first three-run single in postseason history 
when Howie Kendrick and Torii Hunter let a pop-up fall to the ground between 
them.[46] After going 0–for-14 in the first three games of the 2008 ALCS 
against the Tampa Bay Rays, Ellsbury was benched in favor of Crisp with 
only a pinch hitting at-bat in game 4.[47] He did not play in the final 
three games of the series, and the Sox eventually lost the series 4–3. 
Ellsbury played his 179th straight regular-season game without an error 
on April 12, 2009, breaking the franchise record for outfielders held by 
Mike Greenwell. On April 15, with six errorless chances, Ellsbury passed 
Coco Crisp for most errorless total chances by a center fielder, setting 
a new Red Sox franchise record of 433.[48] Ellsbury tied a major league 
record for outfielders with 12 putouts in a nine-inning game on May 20, 
tying Earl Clark of the Boston Braves, who accomplished the feat in 1929, 
and Lyman Bostock of the Minnesota Twins, who did it in 1977.[49] Ellsbury's 
streak of errorless games ended at 232, with 554 errorless chances, when 
he committed an error on June 17.[50] Ellsbury tied Tommy Harper's franchise 
single season record for stolen bases (54) on August 21.[51] Ellsbury then 
broke the record with his 55th steal on August 25, against the Chicago 
White Sox.[52] He finished the season with 70 stolen bases, the most in 
the American League, and he also led the league in triples with 10.[36] 
He won Defensive Player of the Year in MLB.com's annual This Year in Baseball 
Awards 2009.[53] During the offseason, Ellsbury changed his uniform number 
from 46 to 2, which had belonged to the Red Sox' former bench coach, Brad 
Mills, who left the organization to become the manager of the Houston Astros.[54] 
With the Red Sox signing free agent center fielder Mike Cameron and not 
re-signing left fielder Jason Bay, Ellsbury became the Red Sox' starting 
left fielder. The move was made as the result of Cameron's experience in 
center and inexperience in left. Manager Terry Francona expressed excitement 
over the prospect of playing a true center fielder in left field, creating 
a larger fielding range and more aggressive style.[55] On April 11, Ellsbury 
collided with Red Sox third baseman Adrián Beltré in a game against the 
Kansas City Royals, and the collision resulted in hairline fractures to 
four of his left ribs. He was put on the 15-day disabled list on April 
20, and he returned to the Red Sox on May 22.[56] He returned to the 15-day 
DL on May 28 after playing in only three games due to residual soreness 
in his ribs from the collision with Beltré. He met with a thoracic specialist 
who advised him that his ribs should be further along in the healing process 
before he would be able to play.[56] He started a rehab assignment with 
Lowell on July 26,[57] and rejoined the Red Sox on August 4.[56] Ellsbury 
returned to the 15-day disabled list on August 14 after re-injuring his 
ribs in a game against the Texas Rangers.[58] He did not play again in 
2010.[59] During games on August 2 and 3, Ellsbury had walk-off hits in 
the back-to-back games against the Cleveland Indians; a single off Vinnie 
Pestano and a home run off Joe Smith. On August 6, he hit a three-run home 
run and drove in a career-high six runs in Boston's 10–4 win over the New 
York Yankees. On September 25, he hit two home runs during the first game 
of a doubleheader against the Yankees to become the first member of the 
Boston Red Sox to join the 30–30 club.[60] Ellsbury finished the season 
with career highs in home runs (32), hits (212), RBIs (105), runs (119), 
and batting average (.321).[61] He won his first Gold Glove Award, and 
finished as one of only two qualifying players to complete the season with 
a 1.000 fielding percentage. Jacoby was awarded a Silver Slugger Award 
for his hitting, joining teammate Adrian Gonzalez as the only American 
League players to win both the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards in 
2011. Ellsbury was voted the American League Comeback Player of the Year, 
and finished second in the 2011 American League Most Valuable Player Award 
balloting, with 242 points, losing to Justin Verlander (280).[62][63] On 
April 13, 2012, while attempting to slide under Tampa Bay Rays shortstop 
Reid Brignac in an attempt to break up a double play, Ellsbury collided 
with the shortstop. His right shoulder was injured when Brignac fell on 
top of his exposed shoulder. He was placed on the disabled list with a 
subluxation of the shoulder on April 14.[64] He was activated from the 
DL and returned to the Red Sox lineup on July 13, and finished the season 
with a .271 batting average, four home runs, 26 RBI, and 14 stolen bases 
in only 74 games played. Ellsbury set a franchise record for most stolen 
bases in a game with five on May 30.[65] In the August 28 game against 
the Orioles, Ellsbury suffered a compression fractured by fouling a ball 
off his right foot.[66] He was taken to the Steadman Clinic in Vail, Colo., 
for treatment from Dr. Thomas Clanton, who cleared him to rejoin the Red 
Sox lineup on September 25, well ahead of the preliminary prognosis.[67] 
Ellsbury turned in a strong performance in the 2013 postseason, batting 
.500 in the 2013 ALDS and .318 in the 2013 ALCS. In the 2013 World Series, 
Ellsbury started the eventual series-winning rally in Game 6 with a single 
and earned his second World Series ring as a member of the Red Sox.[68] 
Ellsbury's contract expired on October 31, 2013, and he became a free agent 
for the first time in his career.[69] On December 3, 2013, Ellsbury and 
the New York Yankees agreed in principle to a seven-year $153 million deal, 
including an option for an eighth year that could increase the value of 
the contract to $169 million.[70][71] The contract became official on December 
7.[72] In his first season with the Yankees, Ellsbury hit .271 with 16 
home runs and 39 stolen bases.[73] On May 20, 2015, Ellsbury was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list due to a right knee sprain. He ended the season 
hitting .257, with 21 stolen bases.[74] He batted .224 in 74 games after 
he returned from the disabled list, and did not play in the 2015 American 
League Wild Card Game.[75] On April 21, 2016, Ellsbury stole home plate 
on a 3-2 count to tie a game at 3-3 against the Tampa Bay Rays.[76] Ellsbury 
was raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
(Mormon), but as reported in the Boston Globe in 2008,[77] he and his three 
brothers stopped attending services when Jacoby was a teenager. He said, 
"I try not to get Him too involved in baseball. What I wish for is good 
health." Ellsbury was one of the victims of the $8 billion fraud perpetrated 
by wealth manager Allen Stanford;[78] although he had some assets frozen, 
it did not cause him any significant hardship, like those suffered by Johnny 
Damon and Xavier Nady.[79] Ellsbury married Kelsey Hawkins in December 
2012.[80] In 2010, Ellsbury released a Zinfandel wine called ZinfandEllsbury 
through Charity Wines, with 100% of his proceeds donated among three charities: 
The Navajo Relief Fund, Project Bread: The Walk for Hunger, and Ellsbury 
Read Project. The wine launched alongside a charity wine by former Boston
