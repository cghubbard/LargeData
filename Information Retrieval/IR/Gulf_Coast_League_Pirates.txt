The Gulf Coast Pirates or GCL Pirates are the North Division Gulf Coast 
League Rookie Level minor league affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The 
team plays in Bradenton, Florida, at Pirate City Complex. Established in 
1978, the team is composed mainly of players who are in their first year 
of professional baseball either as draftees or non-drafted free agents 
from the United States, Canada, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and other 
countries. The team won division championships in 2002, 2003 and in 2008. 
The team's current manager is Milver Reyes. In 2012, the team won its first 
GCL Championship in team history.[1] The 2009 GCL Pirates had nine players 
each from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, with the United States 
a distant third at six. There were the two highly publicized, pioneering 
Indian pitchers, Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, who became the first Indian-born 
players to sign professional baseball contracts in the United States,[2] 
a second baseman named Henry Henry from Colombia, two players from Puerto 
Rico, and one each from Mexico, Panama, Australia, Canada and one of the 
first three players ever signed out of South Africa, Gift Ngoepe, while 
one of the Americans, Chris Aure, is from Alaska. "We eat together in the 
cafeteria, but sometimes we try each other's foods," Ngoepe says. "I listen 
to the Indians' music when I go past their rooms, and they listen to my 
music from Africa. We tell each other stories about our home countries. 
We do everything together." "Everybody's the same here, like family," Venezuelan 
infielder Elevys Gonzalez says.[3] (from Baseball Reference Bullpen) Pitchers
