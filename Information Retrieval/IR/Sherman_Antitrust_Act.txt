The Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act,[1] 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1–7) 
is a landmark federal statute in the history of United States antitrust 
law (or "competition law") passed by Congress in 1890. Passed under the 
presidency of Benjamin Harrison, it prohibits certain business activities 
that federal government regulators deem to be anti-competitive, and requires 
the federal government to investigate and pursue trusts. In the general 
sense, a trust is a centuries-old form of a contract whereby one party 
entrusts its property to a second party. These are commonly used to hold 
inheritances for the benefit of children, for example. The specific sense 
from 19th Century America used in the law refers to a type of trust which 
combines several large businesses for monopolistic purposes - to exert 
complete control over a market - though the law addresses monopolistic 
practices even if they have nothing to do with this specific legal arrangement.[2] 
In most countries outside the United States, antitrust law is known as 
"competition law." The law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of 
prices by restriction of trade or supply.[3] "Innocent monopoly", or monopoly 
achieved solely by merit, is perfectly legal, but acts by a monopolist 
to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a 
monopoly, are not. The purpose of the Sherman Act is not to protect competitors 
from harm from legitimately successful businesses, nor to prevent businesses 
from gaining honest profits from consumers, but rather to preserve a competitive 
marketplace to protect consumers from abuses.[4] Over time, the Act has 
also been used more broadly, to oppose the combination of entities that 
could potentially harm competition, such as monopolies or cartels. The 
Sherman Act is divided into three sections. Section 1 delineates and prohibits 
specific means of anticompetitive conduct, while Section 2 deals with end 
results that are anti-competitive in nature. Thus, these sections supplement 
each other in an effort to prevent businesses from violating the spirit 
of the Act, while technically remaining within the letter of the law. Section 
3 simply extends the provisions of Section 1 to U.S. territories and the 
District of Columbia. The Clayton Antitrust Act, passed in 1914, proscribes 
certain additional activities that had been discovered to fall outside 
the scope of the Sherman Antitrust Act. For example, the Clayton Act added 
certain practices to the list of impermissible activities: The Robinson–Patman 
Act of 1936 amended the Clayton Act. The amendment proscribed certain anti-competitive 
practices in which manufacturers engaged in price discrimination against 
equally-situated distributors. The federal government began filing cases 
under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. Some cases were successful and 
others were not; many took several years to decide, including appeals. 
Notable cases filed under the act include:[7] As explained by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan 506 U.S. 447 (1993): 
The purpose of the [Sherman] Act is not to protect businesses from the 
working of the market; it is to protect the public from the failure of 
the market. The law directs itself not against conduct which is competitive, 
even severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition 
itself.[9] According to its authors, it was not intended to impact market 
gains obtained by honest means, by benefiting the consumers more than the 
competitors. Senator George Hoar of Massachusetts, another author of the 
Sherman Act, said the following: "... [a person] who merely by superior 
skill and intelligence...got the whole business because nobody could do 
it as well as he could was not a monopolist..(but was if) it involved something 
like the use of means which made it impossible for other persons to engage 
in fair competition."[10] At Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader 310 U. S. 469, 
310 U. S. 492-93 and n. 15: The legislative history of the Sherman Act, 
as well as the decisions of this Court interpreting it, show that it was 
not aimed at policing interstate transportation or movement of goods and 
property. The legislative history and the voluminous literature which was 
generated in the course of the enactment and during fifty years of litigation 
of the Sherman Act give no hint that such was its purpose.[11] They do 
not suggest that, in general, state laws or law enforcement machinery were 
inadequate to prevent local obstructions or interferences with interstate 
transportation, or presented any problem requiring the interposition of 
federal authority.[12] In 1890, when the Sherman Act was adopted, there 
were only a few federal statutes imposing penalties for obstructing or 
misusing interstate transportation.[13] With an expanding commerce, many 
others have since been enacted safeguarding transportation in interstate 
commerce as the need was seen, including statutes declaring conspiracies 
to interfere or actual interference with interstate commerce by violence 
or threats of violence to be felonies.[14] The law was enacted in the era 
of "trusts" and of "combinations" of businesses and of capital organized 
and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in 
the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which 
had become a matter of public concern. The goal was to prevent restraints 
of free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended 
to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise control the market to 
the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of 
which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.[15] For 
that reason the phrase "restraint of trade," which, as will presently appear, 
had a well understood meaning in common law, was made the means of defining 
the activities prohibited. The addition of the words "or commerce among 
the several States" was not an additional kind of restraint to be prohibited 
by the Sherman Act, but was the means used to relate the prohibited restraint 
of trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes, Atlantic Cleaners 
& Dyers v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 286 U. S. 434, so that Congress, 
through its commerce power, might suppress and penalize restraints on the 
competitive system which involved or affected interstate commerce. Because 
many forms of restraint upon commercial competition extended across state 
lines so as to make regulation by state action difficult or impossible, 
Congress enacted the Sherman Act, 21 Cong.Rec. 2456. It was in this sense 
of preventing restraints on commercial competition that Congress exercised 
"all the power it possessed." Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers v. United States, 
supra, 286 U. S. 435. At Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States, 
85 F.2d 1, affirmed, 175 U. S. 175 U.S. 211; At Standard Oil Co. of New 
Jersey v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 221 U. S. 54-58. Congress claimed 
power to pass the Sherman Act through its constitutional authority to regulate 
interstate commerce. Therefore, federal courts only have jurisdiction to 
apply the Act to conduct that restrains or substantially affects either 
interstate commerce or trade within the District of Columbia. This requires 
that the plaintiff must show that the conduct occurred during the flow 
of interstate commerce or had an appreciable effect on some activity that 
occurs during interstate commerce. A Section 1 violation has three elements:[16] 
A Section 2 violation has two elements:[17] Violations of the Sherman Act 
fall (loosely[18]) into two categories: A modern trend has increased difficulty 
for antitrust plaintiffs as courts have come to hold plaintiffs to increasing 
burdens of pleading. Under older Section 1 precedent, it was not settled 
how much evidence was required to show a conspiracy. For example, a conspiracy 
could be inferred based on parallel conduct, etc. That is, plaintiffs were 
only required to show that a conspiracy was conceivable. Since the 1970s, 
however, courts have held plaintiffs to higher standards, giving antitrust 
defendants an opportunity to resolve cases in their favor before significant 
discovery under FRCP 12(b)(6). That is, to overcome a motion to dismiss, 
plaintiffs, under Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, must plead facts consistent 
with FRCP 8(a) sufficient to show that a conspiracy is plausible (and not 
merely conceivable or possible). This protects defendants from bearing 
the costs of antitrust "fishing expeditions," however it deprives plaintiffs 
of perhaps their only tool to acquire evidence (discovery). Second, courts 
have employed more sophisticated and principled definitions of markets. 
Market definition is necessary, in rule of reason cases, for the plaintiff 
to prove a conspiracy is harmful. It is also necessary for the plaintiff 
to establish the market relationship between conspirators to prove their 
conduct is within the per se rule. In early cases, it was easier for plaintiffs 
to show market relationship, or dominance, by tailoring market definition, 
even if it ignored fundamental principles of economics. In U.S. v. Grinnell, 
384 U.S. 563 (1966), the trial judge, Charles Wyzanski, composed the market 
only of alarm companies with services in every state, tailoring out any 
local competitors; the defendant stood alone in this market, but had the 
court added up the entire national market, it would have had a much smaller 
share of the national market for alarm services that the court purportedly 
used. The appellate courts affirmed this finding; however, today, an appellate 
court would likely find this definition to be flawed. Modern courts use 
a more sophisticated market definition that does not permit as manipulative 
a definition.[citation needed] Section 2 of the Act forbade monopoly. In 
Section 2 cases, the court has, again on its own initiative, drawn a distinction 
between coercive and innocent monopoly. The act is not meant to punish 
businesses that come to dominate their market passively or on their own 
merit, only those that intentionally dominate the market through misconduct, 
which generally consists of conspiratorial conduct of the kind forbidden 
by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or Section 3 of the Clayton Act. The Act 
was aimed at regulating businesses. However, its application was not limited 
to the commercial side of business. Its prohibition of the cartel was also 
interpreted to make illegal many labor union activities. This is because 
unions were characterized as cartels as well (cartels of laborers).[30] 
This persisted until 1914, when the Clayton Act created exceptions for 
certain union activities. To determine whether a particular state statute 
that restrains competition was intended to be preempted by the Act, courts 
will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in 
Rice v. Norman Williams Co.: The Sherman Act has seen much controversy. 
One branch of the criticism focuses on whether the Act improves competition 
and benefits consumers, or merely aids inefficient businesses at the expense 
of more innovative ones. Alan Greenspan, in his essay entitled Antitrust[31] 
condemns the Sherman Act as stifling innovation and harming society. "No 
one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving 
mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before 
they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid 
for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept 
our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible." 
Greenspan summarized the nature of antitrust law as: "a jumble of economic 
irrationality and ignorance."[32] Greenspan at that time was a disciple 
and friend of Ayn Rand, and he first published Antitrust in Rand's monthly 
publication The Objectivist Newsletter. Rand, who described herself as 
"a radical for capitalism,"[33] opposed antitrust law not only on economic 
grounds but also morally, as a violation of property rights, asserting 
that the "meaning and purpose" of antitrust law is "the penalizing of ability 
for being ability, the penalizing of success for being success, and the 
sacrifice of productive genius to the demands of envious mediocrity."[34] 
Other normative criticism of antitrust policy has been framed in utilitarian 
terms. Critics, having assumed that some kind of competition law is inevitable, 
argue as to what its central policy should be, and raise doubts as to whether 
it is accomplishing its goal. A common tactic is to choose a goal, and 
then cite evidence that it supports the opposite.[original research?] For 
example, during a debate over the act in 1890, Representative William Mason 
said "trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the 
price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would 
not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which 
have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate 
business enterprise."[35] Consequently, if the primary goal of the act 
is to protect consumers, and consumers are protected by lower prices, the 
act may be harmful if it reduces economy of scale, a price-lowering mechanism, 
by breaking up big businesses. Mason put small business survival, a justice 
interest, on a level concomitant with the pure economic rationale of consumer 
interest. The converse argument is that if lowering prices alone is not 
the goal, and instead protecting competitions and markets as well as consumers 
is the goal, the law again arguably has the opposite effect — it could 
be protectionist. Economist Thomas DiLorenzo notes that Senator Sherman 
sponsored the 1890 William McKinley tariff just three months after the 
Sherman Act, and agrees with The New York Times which wrote on October 
1, 1890: "That so-called Anti-Trust law was passed to deceive the people 
and to clear the way for the enactment of this Pro-Trust law relating to 
the tariff." The Times goes on to assert that Sherman merely supported 
this "humbug" of a law "in order that party organs might say...'Behold! 
We have attacked the trusts. The Republican Party is the enemy of all such 
rings.' [36] Dilorenzo writes: "Protectionists did not want prices paid 
by consumers to fall. But they also understood that to gain political support 
for high tariffs they would have to assure the public that industries would 
not combine to increase prices to politically prohibitive levels. Support 
for both an antitrust law and tariff hikes would maintain high prices while 
avoiding the more obvious bilking of consumers."[37] The criticism of antitrust 
law is often associated with conservative politics. For example, conservative 
legal scholar, judge, and failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork was 
well known for his outspoken criticism of the antitrust regime. Another 
conservative legal scholar and judge, Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit 
does not condemn the entire regime, but expresses concern with the potential 
that it could be applied to create inefficiency, rather than to avoid inefficiency.[38] 
Posner further believes, along with a number of others, including Bork, 
that genuinely inefficient cartels and coercive monopolies, the target 
of the act, would be self-corrected by market forces, making the strict
