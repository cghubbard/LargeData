The Midwest League is a Minor League Baseball league, established in 1954 
and based in the Midwestern United States. It is a Class A league that 
plays a full season; its players are typically players in their second 
or third year of professional play. The Midwest League began as the Illinois 
State League (1947-1948), then became the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League 
(1949-1955). In 1956, the Mississippi-Ohio Valley League was renamed the 
Midwest League.[1][2] Today, the league has 16 teams in two divisions.[3] 
The Midwest League directly evolved from two earlier leagues in the region. 
In 1947, the Class D Illinois State League (ISL) began operation with six 
Illinois teams – the Belleville Stags, Centralia Cubs, Marion Indians, 
Mattoon Indians, Mount Vernon Braves and the West Frankfort Cardinals. 
In 1949, the ISL changed its name to the Mississippi–Ohio Valley League 
after Marion moved their franchise to Kentucky and became the Paducah Chiefs. 
In 1954, the Mississippi-Ohio Valley League expanded, adding teams in Clinton 
and Dubuque, Iowa. The Mississippi-Ohio Valley League was then renamed 
Midwest League in 1956. The original teams in 1956, the first year of Midwest 
League play, were: Clinton Pirates, Decatur Commodores, Dubuque Packers, 
Kokomo Dodgers, Lafayette Red Sox, Mattoon Phillies, Michigan City White 
Caps and the Paris Lakers. Mattoon is the oldest franchise in the MWL, 
evolving into today's Fort Wayne TinCaps, while Clinton is the oldest MWL 
locale. [4] In 1960, the Davenport, Iowa based Quad City Braves joined 
the league as an expansion team. In 1962, Appleton, Burlington, and Cedar 
Rapids joined the Midwest League from the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League 
which folded operations when those franchises switched leagues.[5] All 
those franchised remain in the league today. In 1963, the Midwest League 
was designated as a Class A league, after the minor league classification 
structure was reorganized.[6] The 1975 Waterloo Royals, led by future MLB 
All-Stars Willie Wilson and Dan Quisenberry, are ranked #60 on MiLB.com's 
Top 100 Teams. The Royals finished the season 93–35.[7] In 1976, the Midwest 
League contracted from ten teams to eight, as franchises in Danville and 
Dubuque were eliminated. In 1982, the league expanded from 8 to 12 teams, 
adding the Beloit Brewers, the Danville Suns, the Madison Muskies, and 
the Springfield Cardinals. The Peoria Suns relocated from Danville in 1983, 
and acquired their current name, Peoria Chiefs, the following year. In 
1988, the league began splitting its season into two halves and expanded 
from 12 to 14 teams, with the addition of franchises in South Bend, Indiana, 
and Rockford, Illinois. During the 1990s several teams changed cities as 
Major League Baseball placed higher standards on minor league baseball 
facilities; franchises in smaller cities were sold to new owners who moved 
those teams to new ballparks in larger cities. Kenosha, Madison, Rockford, 
Springfield, Waterloo, and Wausau lost teams during this decade while Battle 
Creek, Dayton, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids (West Michigan), Kane County, and 
Lansing gained teams.[8] The 1978 Appleton Foxes are ranked #93 on the 
Top-100 All Time teams by MiLB.com. [9] Led by future Cy Young Award winner 
LaMarr Hoyt, the team finished 97-40. Harry Chappas, Ross Baumgarten and 
Britt Burns were all called up to the parent Chicago White Sox at the conclusin 
of the MWL season. The 97 wins by the Foxes remains a Midwest League record. 
[10] The Fort Wayne TinCaps are the oldest franchise in the league, having 
begun as the Mattoon Indians in 1947 and playing in Keokuk, Iowa; Wisconsin 
Rapids, Wisconsin; and Kenosha, Wisconsin, before moving to Fort Wayne, 
Indiana, in 1993. The Clinton LumberKings have been in one city longer 
than any Midwest League team, having called Clinton, Iowa, home since 1954. 
The Southwest Michigan Devil Rays moved to Midland, Michigan, and became 
the Great Lakes Loons prior to the 2007 season. On September 2, 2008, Minor 
League Baseball announced that two teams would transfer from the fellow 
Class A South Atlantic League to the Midwest League: the Lake County Captains 
(an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians playing in Eastlake, Ohio) and the 
Bowling Green Hot Rods (an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays playing in Bowling 
Green, Kentucky).[11] Year by Year championship teams: List of Midwest
