Warren Scott Brusstar (born February 2, 1952) is a former major league 
baseball pitcher who played nine years, for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Chicago White Sox, and Chicago Cubs. He graduated from Napa High School 
in 1970[1] and attended Fresno State University before being signed. He 
is currently the pitching coach at Napa Valley College. Brusstar was inducted 
into the Napa Valley College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011[2][3] Brusstar, 
who batted and threw right-handed, was drafted by the San Francisco Giants 
in 1970 in the 27th round (635th overall), but chose not to sign. In 1971, 
he was drafted by the Giants again, this time in the sixth round (114th 
overall). Again, the 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 200 pound Brusstar did not sign. 
He would have to wait until 1973 to be drafted again, this time by the 
New York Mets in the 33rd round (684th), but again did not sign. In 1974, 
the Phillies were able to sign Brusstar after drafting him in the fourth 
round (67th). Brusstar was a very successful starter and reliever in the 
minor leagues. His ERA never reached 3.00 in any of the years he played 
before making his major league debut (the highest it reached was 2.71), 
although in two seasons he walked 90 or more batters. On May 6, 1977, at 
the age of 25, Brusstar made his major league debut with the Phillies when 
he was called up to replace Tug McGraw on the team's roster after McGraw 
suffered an elbow injury.[4] He would never start a game in his career, 
because he was used primarily as a middle reliever. In only three seasons 
did Brusstar appear in over 50 games in a season, because he was constantly 
hampered by elbow and shoulder problems.[citation needed] He played his 
last game on October 3, 1985. On August 30, 1982, the Chicago White Sox 
purchased Brusstar from the Phillies. He would end up only pitching ten 
games for the White Sox. On January 25, 1983, the Chicago White Sox made 
a trade sending Brusstar and Steve Trout to the Cubs for Scott Fletcher, 
Pat Tabler, Randy Martz, and Dick Tidrow. Bill Buckner, who also graduated 
from Napa High School, was a teammate with Brusstar for a year and a half
