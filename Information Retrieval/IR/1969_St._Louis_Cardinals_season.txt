The 1969 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 88th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 78th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
87–75 during the season and finished fourth in the newly established National 
League East, 13 games behind the eventual NL pennant and World Series champion 
New York Mets. The resurgent Chicago Cubs, featuring players such as Ernie 
Banks, Ron Santo, and Billy Williams and helmed by fiery manager Leo Durocher, 
led the newly formed NL East for much of the summer before faltering. The 
Cardinals put on a mid-season surge, as their famous announcer Harry Caray 
(in what would prove to be his final season of 25 doing Cardinals broadcasts) 
began singing, "The Cardinals are coming, tra-la, tra-la". However, to 
the surprise of both Chicago and St. Louis, the Miracle Mets would ultimately 
win the division, as well as the league championship and the World Series. 
Pitcher Bob Gibson and outfielder Curt Flood won Gold Gloves this year. 
1969 also marked the final season for the Busch Stadium grass before the 
installation of AstroTurf, which would be their home surface for the next 
26 seasons. After the season, long-time broadcaster Harry Caray was fired. 
Caray would be a broadcaster for the Oakland Athletics in 1970, before 
spending 27 seasons in Chicago with the White Sox (1971–1981) and the Cubs 
from 1982 until his death prior to the 1998 season. Infielders Coaches
