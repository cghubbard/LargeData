Ellis Rena Burks (born September 11, 1964) is a former outfielder who played 
in Major League Baseball for 18 seasons. He batted and threw right-handed. 
Selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first round (20th pick) of the 1983 
Major League Baseball draft, Burks made his debut in the 1987 season as 
a regular center fielder at age 22, becoming the third player in Red Sox 
history to hit 20 home runs and steal 20 bases in one season. He was selected 
to both the Baseball Digest and Topps "All-Rookie" teams. Defensively, 
Burks showed excellent range, a sure glove and a strong arm. The only problem 
for Burks while with the Red Sox was that he was injury-prone. He had shoulder 
surgery in 1989, and it was the first of many setbacks for him. During 
the 1990 season he hit two home runs in the same inning of a game, to become 
the second player in Red Sox history to achieve the feat; Bill Regan was 
the first, in 1928. Later, Burks suffered from bad knees and back spasms. 
After six seasons in Boston, and despite his injuries, he ended up leaving 
as a free agent and signing with the Chicago White Sox in January 1993. 
He surpassed expectations around him by turning in a solid, injury-free 
season, filling the White Sox' urgent need for a quality right fielder. 
He was one of the club's better performers in the playoffs, batting .304. 
A free agent at the end of the season, he signed a five-year contract with 
the Colorado Rockies (1994–98). In 1996 Burks enjoyed his best season. 
He led National League hitters in runs (142), slugging average (.639), 
total bases (392) and extra-base hits (93); was second in hits (211) and 
doubles (45), and fifth in home runs (40) and RBI (128). His .344 was also 
second in the batting title race (behind Tony Gwynn, .353). Burks finished 
third in the MVP voting. He also stole 32 bases that season, marking only 
the second time that two players from the same team collected at least 
30 home runs and 30 steals, as Colorado outfielder Dante Bichette accomplished 
the feat. He remains in the top ten in many offensive categories for the 
Rockies.[1] While with the Rockies, Burks was part of the Blake Street 
Bombers that included Andrés Galarraga, Bichette, Larry Walker and Vinny 
Castilla. This was the heart of the Rockies' lineup that was second in 
the National League in home runs by team in 1994, then led the National 
League in home runs from 1995 to 1997.[2] Burks was traded to the San Francisco 
Giants in mid-season 1998. In 2000, batting fifth behind Barry Bonds and 
Jeff Kent, he compiled numbers of .344, 24, 96, in only 122 games and 393 
at-bats. He won the 2000 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. 
He was signed by the Cleveland Indians after the season. In his new role 
as a DH for the Indians, Burks provided consistent production in the middle-of-the-lineup, 
hitting .280, 28, 74 in 2001, and .301, 32, 91 in 2002. He sprained his 
wrist in spring training of 2003 and kept playing in 55 games until the 
muscles in his right hand affected his ability to swing the bat. He underwent 
season-ending surgery to repair nerve damage in his right elbow. The Indians 
did not pick up their 2004 contract option or offer him salary arbitration, 
and he returned to the Red Sox in 2004. He retired at the end of the season 
with a World Series ring with the team that he began his career with. His 
1000th career hit was a triple. In an 18-year career, Burks was a .291 
hitter with 352 home runs, 1206 RBI, 1253 runs, 2107 hits, 402 doubles, 
63 triples, and 181 stolen bases in 2000 games. After the 2005 season, 
Burks joined the Indians' front office staff as a special assistant to 
the general manager. He currently resides in Chagrin Falls, Ohio [1] and 
his son Chris plays high school baseball for Verrado High School in Arizona.
