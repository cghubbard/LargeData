In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate 
in achieving a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), it 
is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). In MLB, 
a player in each league[L] wins the "batting title" each season for having 
the highest batting average that year.[1][2] Under current rules, a player 
must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 
over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.[3] 
However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless 
at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would 
have the highest batting average, he wins the title.[3] Tony Gwynn, for 
example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.[4] 
Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) 
with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would 
still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), 
so he was awarded the 1996 National League (NL) batting title.[5] The first 
batting average champion in the NL was Ross Barnes; in the league's inaugural 
1876 season, Barnes batted .429 for the Chicago White Stockings.[6] The 
American League (AL) was established in 1901, and Hall of Fame second baseman 
Nap Lajoie led that league with a .426 average for the Philadelphia Athletics.[7] 
Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers, who also holds the highest career batting 
average of .366, led the AL in average in 11 (or 12) seasons.[8] Honus 
Wagner and Gwynn are tied for the second-most titles, with eight apiece 
in the NL.[4][9] It is unclear whether Lajoie or Cobb won the 1910 AL title, 
with some sources attributing the title to each man.[1910a] If Cobb is 
credited with the 1910 title, he won 9 consecutive titles from 1907 to 
1915 and 12 total titles for his career. Otherwise, Rogers Hornsby won 
the most consecutive titles, with six from 1920 to 1925. Without the 1910 
title, Cobb still led the league in five consecutive seasons from 1911 
to 1915. Cobb holds the record for highest average in two and three consecutive 
seasons (.414 from 1911 to 1912 and .408 from 1911 to 1913), but Hornsby 
holds the record for four and five consecutive seasons (.404 from 1922 
to 1925 and .402 from 1921 to 1925).[10] Wagner, Rod Carew, Wade Boggs, 
and Gwynn have each won four consecutive titles. Lajoie also had a streak 
of four league-leading seasons from 1901 to 1904 if he is credited with 
the contested AL title in 1902.[1902a] Barnes' initial NL-leading average 
of .4286 in 1876 set the single-season record which stood for a decade.[11] 
Tip O'Neill topped this total with a .4352 average in 1887 (that batting 
average had to be calculated without counting walks as hits, because of 
the walk-as-base-hit rule being in effect that year only), and Hugh Duffy 
set the current record mark in 1894 by posting a .4397 batting average.[11] 
Under the current 3.1 PA qualification, players have posted a .400 batting 
average for a season 28 times.[12] Ted Williams' .4057 in 1941 the most 
recent such season, one of 13 to occur since 1900.[12] George Brett in 
1980 is the only player to maintain a .400 average into September since 
1941.[13] Additionally, only Brett and John Olerud in 1993 maintained such 
an average into August.[13] With the modern scarcity of .400 hitters, recent 
players who have been above .400 early in the season, such as Chipper Jones 
in 2008, have drawn significant attention in the media.[13][14] Brett's 
.390 in 1980 and Gwynn's .394 in 1994 are the only seasons in which a player 
reached .390 since 1941. Carl Yastrzemski's .301 in the 1968 American League 
was the lowest batting average ever to lead a league. Willie Keeler's 1897 
and Zack Wheat's 1918 are the only two title seasons in which the winner 
hit no home runs.[15][16] Joe Mauer's 2006 title made him the first catcher 
to ever win an AL batting title, and his third title in 2009 surpassed 
Ernie Lombardi's previous record of two titles for a catcher in any league.[17][18][19][20] 
The most recent champions are Miguel Cabrera, at .338 in the AL, and Dee 
Gordon, at .333 in the NL. The closest finish in a batting race came in 
1945 when Snuffy Stirnweiss batted .309, topping Tony Cuccinello's .308 
average for the American League title by .00008.[21][22] George Kell beat 
out Williams in 1949 by .00015.[21] The closest race in the National League 
came in 2003 when Albert Pujols held off Todd Helton on the last day of 
the season by .00022.[21][23] The closest National League race before that 
was in 1931 with Chick Hafey edging out Bill Terry by .00028.[21] Lajoie's 
.426 average in 1901 was 86 points higher than runner-up Mike Donlin's 
.340, the largest margin of victory for a batting champion. Cap Anson's 
.399 in 1881 was 71 points higher than Joe Start in 1881, the widest margin 
in the National League. No player has definitively won batting titles in 
both the American and National Leagues. However, Ed Delahanty has if he 
is credited with the disputed 1902 American League title, as he was also 
the 1899 National League champion. The only other player to win titles 
in multiple leagues was Pete Browning, who won American Association titles 
in 1882 and 1885, along with the lone Players' League championship in 1890. 
Ross Barnes and Deacon White each won National Association and National 
League titles, but the National Association is not regarded as an official 
league.[L] In 1990, Willie McGee posted a .335 average over 542 at-bats 
in the NL before being traded to the AL on August 29.[24] Although McGee 
finished the season in the AL, he had enough PA's in the NL to qualify 
for the NL batting title, which he won narrowly over Eddie Murray's .330. 
However, McGee batted .274 that season in the AL, bringing down his overall 
average to .324 and allowing Murray to lead the majors in batting average.[24][25] 
At a ceremony prior to the 2016 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 
San Diego, Padres broadcaster Dick Enberg announced that commissioner Rob 
Manfred had proclaimed that the American League batting champion and the 
National League batting champion would forthwith be rewarded with the Rod 
Carew Batting Championship and Tony Gwynn Batting Championship respectively.[26]
