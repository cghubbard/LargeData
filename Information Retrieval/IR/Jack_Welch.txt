John Francis "Jack" Welch, Jr. (born November 19, 1935) is a retired American 
business executive, author, and chemical engineer. He was chairman and 
CEO of General Electric between 1981 and 2001. During his tenure at GE, 
the company's value rose 4,000%.[2] In 2006, Welch's net worth was estimated 
at $720 million.[1] When he retired from GE he received a severance payment 
of $417 million, the largest such payment in history.[3] Jack Welch was 
born in Peabody, Massachusetts, the son of Grace (Andrews), a homemaker, 
and John Francis Welch, Senior, a Boston & Maine Railroad conductor.[4] 
Jack is Irish American. His paternal and maternal grandparents were Irish.[5] 
Throughout his early life in middle school and high school, Jack found 
work in the summers as a golf caddie, newspaper delivery boy, shoe salesman, 
and drill press operator.[5] Welch attended Salem High School, where he 
participated in baseball, football, and captained the hockey team.[5] Late 
in his senior year, Welch was accepted to University of Massachusetts Amherst, 
where he studied chemical engineering. Welch worked in chemical engineering 
at Sunoco and PPG Industries during his college summers.[5] In his sophomore 
year, he became a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity.[5] Welch graduated 
in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering, turning 
down offers from several companies in order to attend graduate school at 
the University of Illinois.[5][6] He graduated from the University of Illinois 
in 1960 with a Master's degree and a PhD in chemical engineering.[7][8] 
Welch joined General Electric in 1960. He worked as a junior chemical engineer 
in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, at a salary of $10,500. In 1961, Welch planned 
to quit his job as junior engineer because he was dissatisfied with the 
raise offered to him and was unhappy with the bureaucracy he observed at 
GE. Welch was persuaded to remain at GE by Reuben Gutoff, an executive 
at the company, who promised him that he would help create the small-company 
atmosphere Welch desired.[9] In 1963, an explosion at the factory which 
was under his management blew off the roof of the facilities, and he was 
almost fired for that episode.[10] By 1968, Welch became the vice president 
and head of GE's plastics division, which at the time was a $26 million 
operation for GE.[6] Welch oversaw production as well as the marketing 
for the GE-developed plastics Lexan and Noryl. Not long after, in 1971, 
Welch also became the vice president of GE's metallurgical and chemical 
divisions.[6] By 1973, Welch was named the head of strategic planning for 
GE and he held that position until 1979, which involved him now working 
from the corporate headquarters, exposing him to many of the "big fish" 
he would one day be among.[11] Not long after his promotion to head of 
strategic planning, Welch was named senior vice president and head of Consumer 
Products and Services Division in 1977, a position he held until 1979 when 
he became the vice chairman of GE.[6] In 1981, Welch became GE's youngest 
chairman and CEO, succeeding Reginald H. Jones. By 1982, Welch had dismantled 
much of the earlier management put together by Jones with aggressive simplification 
and consolidation. One of his primary leadership directives was that GE 
had to be No. 1 or No. 2 in the industries it participated in.[12] Through 
the 1980s, Welch sought to streamline GE. In 1981, he made a speech in 
New York City called "Growing fast in a slow-growth economy".[13] Under 
Welch's leadership, GE increased market value from $12 billion in 1981 
to $280 billion, making 600 acquisitions while shifting into emerging markets. 
Welch pioneered a policy of informality at the work place, allowing all 
employees to have a small business experience at a large corporation.[9] 
Welch worked to eradicate perceived inefficiency by trimming inventories 
and dismantling the bureaucracy that had almost led him to leave GE in 
the past. He closed factories, reduced pay rolls and cut lackluster units.[14] 
Welch's public philosophy was that a company should be either No. 1 or 
No. 2 in a particular industry, or else leave it completely. Welch valued 
surprise and made unexpected visits to GE's plants and offices.[9] Welch 
popularized so-called "rank and yank" policies used now by other corporate 
entities. Each year, Welch would fire the bottom 10% of his managers, regardless 
of absolute performance.[15] He earned a reputation for brutal candor. 
He rewarded those in the top 20% with bonuses and stock options. He also 
broadened the stock options program at GE, extending availability from 
top executives to nearly one third of all employees. Welch is also known 
for abolishing the nine-layer management hierarchy and bringing a sense 
of informality to the company.[16] During the early 1980s he was dubbed 
"Neutron Jack" (in reference to the neutron bomb) for eliminating employees 
while leaving buildings intact.[17] In Jack: Straight From The Gut, Welch 
states that GE had 411,000 employees at the end of 1980, and 299,000 at 
the end of 1985. Of the 112,000 who left the payroll, 37,000 were in businesses 
that GE sold, and 81,000 were reduced in continuing businesses. In return, 
GE had increased its market capital tremendously. Welch reduced basic research, 
and closed or sold off businesses that were under-performing. In 1986, 
GE acquired RCA.[18] RCA's corporate headquarters were located in Rockefeller 
Center; Welch subsequently took up an office in the now GE Building at 
30 Rockefeller Plaza. The RCA acquisition resulted in GE selling off RCA 
properties to other companies and keeping NBC as part of the GE portfolio 
of businesses. During the 1990s, Welch shifted GE's business from manufacturing 
to financial services through numerous acquisitions. Welch adopted Motorola's 
Six Sigma quality program in late 1995. In 1980, the year before Welch 
became CEO, GE recorded revenues of roughly $26.8 billion. By 1999 he was 
named "Manager of the Century" by Fortune magazine.[19] There was a lengthy 
and publicized succession planning saga prior to his retirement among James 
McNerney, Robert Nardelli, and Jeffrey Immelt, with Immelt eventually selected 
to succeed Welch as chairman and CEO. Nardelli became the CEO of Home Depot 
until his resignation in early 2007, and until recently, was the CEO of 
Chrysler, while McNerney became CEO of 3M until he left that post to serve 
in the same capacity at Boeing. Welch's "walk-away" package from GE was 
not valued at the time of his retirement, but GMI Ratings estimates its 
worth at $420 million.[20] He served as Chairman of The Business Council 
in 1991 and 1992.[21] According to BusinessWeek, critics of Welch have 
questioned whether the pressure he placed on employees may have led them 
to "cut corners", which may have contributed to controversies over defense-contracting, 
or the Kidder, Peabody & Co. bond-trading scheme in the early 1990s.[9] 
Welch has received criticism for a lack of compassion for the middle class 
and working class. By his actions during acquisitions and wholesale shutdowns 
of GE business units Welch proved that keeping only the "good" units of 
a company can maximize ROI in the short term.[22] Welch has stated that 
he is not concerned with the discrepancy between the salaries of top-paid 
CEOs and those of average workers. When asked about the issue of excessive 
CEO pay, Welch has said that such allegations are "outrageous" and has 
vehemently opposed proposed SEC regulations affecting executive compensation. 
Countering the public uproar over excessive executive pay (including backdating 
stock options, golden parachutes for nonperformance, and extravagant retirement 
packages), Welch stated that CEO compensation should continue to be dictated 
by the free market, without interference from government or other outside 
parties.[23] Welch's income and assets came under scrutiny during his divorce 
from his second wife, Jane, in 2001, after she included details in divorce 
papers of what she said he received as benefits from GE. Welch's contracts 
with GE were subsequently investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.[24][25] 
The retention package, worth $2.5 million, was agreed upon by Welch and 
GE in 1996 and promised him continued access after his retirement to benefits 
he received as CEO including an apartment in New York, baseball tickets 
and the use of a private jet and chauffeured car.[24][26] The benefits 
were agreed upon in lieu of a more traditional stock package because, according 
to Welch, he did not want more money, preferring instead to retain the 
lifestyle he had enjoyed as CEO once he retired. According to an interview 
with Welch in 2009, the agreement was filed with the SEC. As a result of 
the media attention and accusations of being "greedy," Welch chose to renounce 
the benefits.[26] Following Welch's retirement from General Electric, he 
became an adviser to private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and to 
the chief executive of IAC, Barry Diller.[27][28] In addition to his consulting 
and advisory roles, Welch has been active on the public speaking circuit 
and co-wrote a popular column for BusinessWeek with his wife, Suzy, for 
four years until November 2009. The column was syndicated by The New York 
Times.[28][29] In September 2004, the Central Intelligence Agency published 
a parody of Jack Welch applying his management skills while serving as 
imagined Deputy Director of Intelligence.[30] In 2005, he published Winning, 
a book about management co-written with Suzy Welch, which reached No. 1 
on The Wall Street Journal bestseller list,[31] and appeared on New York 
Times Best Seller list.[27][28] On January 25, 2006, Welch gave his name 
to Sacred Heart University's College of Business, which will be known as 
the "John F. Welch College of Business".[32] Since September 2006, Welch 
has been teaching a class at the MIT Sloan School of Management to a hand-picked 
group of 30 MBA students with a demonstrated career interest in leadership.[33] 
In 2009, Welch founded the Jack Welch Management Institute (JWMI), a program 
at Chancellor University that offered an online executive MBA. The institute 
was acquired by Strayer University in 2011.[34] Welch has been very actively 
involved with the curriculum, faculty and students since the beginning 
of the institution.[35][36] JWMI's MBA program was recently named the number 
one most influential education brand on Linkedin[37] and one of the top 
business schools to watch in 2016.[38] While JWMI is not ranked by U.S. 
News & World Report, the school has been recognized in the online education 
community as reputable.[39] Its goal is not to make money, but to build 
over time focusing on the quality of the program and increasing the number 
of students enrolled year after year.[40] At GE, Welch became known for 
his teaching and growing leaders. He has taught at MIT’s Sloan School of 
Management and teaches seminars to CEOs all over the globe. “More than 
35 CEOs at today’s top companies [are] trained under Jack Welch”.[41] He 
demonstrates his passion for the institute by being highly involved with 
the students, faculty, and the development of the curriculum. JWMI students 
have direct access to Jack Welch, and he hosts quarterly video conferences 
with his students.[41] It is known that along with his video conferences, 
Welch creates many video responses to messages on bulletin boards and answers 
individual emails. His investment in the university is also reflected in 
his interest in the institute's Net Promoter score (NPS). He administers 
surveys on satisfaction regularly and scrutinizes the results to find scores 
that need improvement. In an interview with Wired Academic, Welch explained 
the overall status of his MBA program, stating that the persistence rate 
of students continuing on to a second year had grown from 90% to 95%, and 
that JWMI turns away very few students in the admissions process. He also 
said that he would like better leadership training for MBA students.[42] 
Welch had four children with his first wife, Carolyn. They divorced amicably 
in April 1987 after 28 years of marriage. His second wife, Jane Beasley, 
was a former mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer. She married Welch in April 
1989, and they divorced in 2003. While Welch had crafted a prenuptial agreement, 
Beasley insisted on a ten-year time limit to its applicability, and thus 
she was able to leave the marriage reportedly with around $180 million.[43] 
Welch's third wife, Suzy Wetlaufer (née Spring), co-authored his 2005 book 
Winning as Suzy Welch. She served briefly as the editor-in-chief of the 
Harvard Business Review. Welch's wife at the time, Jane Beasley, found 
out about an affair between Wetlaufer and Welch. Beasley informed the review 
and Wetlaufer was forced to resign in early 2002 after admitting to the 
affair with Welch while preparing an interview with him for the magazine.[44] 
Since January 2012, Welch and Suzy Welch wrote a biweekly column for Reuters 
and Fortune,[45][46] which they both left on October 9, 2012, after an 
article critical of Welch and his GE career was published by Fortune.[47] 
Jack Welch identifies politically as a Republican.[48] He has stated that 
the idea of global warming is "the attack on capitalism that socialism 
couldn't bring", and that it is a form of "mass neurosis".[49] Yet, he 
has said that every business must embrace green products and green ways 
of doing business, "whether you believe in global warming or not...because 
the world wants these products".[50] Regarding shareholder value, Welch 
said in a Financial Times interview on the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, 
“On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. 
Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy...your main constituencies 
are your employees, your customers and your products".[51] Welch has been 
publicly criticized for his opinions on job numbers from September 2012.[52] 
After the Bureau of Labor Statistics released employment data stating that 
the U.S. unemployment rate had dropped from 8.1% to 7.8%, Welch tweeted, 
"Unbelievable jobs numbers...these Chicago guys will do anything...can't 
debate so change numbers".[53] Welch has stood by his tweet stating if 
he could write the tweet again, he would add question marks at the end 
to make it clear that his intention was to raise a question over the legitimacy 
of the job numbers.[54] A subsequent report on the figures suggested manipulation 
of the figures but did not prove political manipulation.[55][56] In a Wall 
Street Journal opinion piece, Welch wrote that the debate has led to people 
looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Referencing 
his original tweet, he stated "Thank God I did", in a Squawk Box appearance,[54] 
and also wrote, “The coming election is too important to be decided on 
a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong”.[57] Jack Welch instilled 
an organizational behavior that he called "boundaryless". He called such 
a company, a "boundaryless company". He defined it as, removing the barriers 
between traditional functions, and finding great ideas, anywhere within 
the organization, or from outside the organization, and sharing them with 
everyone in the company.[58][59][60][61] General Electric under CEO Jeff 
Immelt has realigned itself becoming more specialized, cutting off ties 
with older businesses, and is now more focused on services in finance, 
health care, and aircraft engines.[61] An article from the New York Times 
highlights the fact that General Electric after the era of Jack Welch is 
more focused on core businesses after a spin-off of its North America retail 
finance business. After selling a fraction of its business, Immelt planned 
to use the proceeds to build the capital as a "standalone company", resulting 
in "a boost for shareholders".[62] On March 11, 2010, Welch cameoed as 
himself in the NBC sitcom 30 Rock, appearing in the season four episode 
'Future Husband'. In the episode, Welch confronts Alec Baldwin's character, 
Jack Donaghy, to confirm the sale of NBC Universal to a fictional Philadelphia-based 
cable company called Kabletown. The sale is a satirical reference to the 
real-world acquisition of NBCUniversal from General Electric by Comcast
