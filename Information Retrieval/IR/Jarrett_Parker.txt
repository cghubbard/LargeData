Jarrett Paul Parker (born January 1, 1989) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Born in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Parker attended Colonial Forge High 
School in Stafford, Virginia. Parker later attended the University of Virginia 
from 2008 to 2010. After struggling as a freshman, Parker led his team 
to the College World Series as a sophomore in 2009, hitting .355 with 16 
home runs.[1] As a junior, Parker hit .333 with ten home runs.[2] Parker 
was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the second round (74th overall) 
of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft.[3] Parker spent 2011 and 2012 
with the Single-A San Jose Giants and was promoted to the Double-A Richmond 
Flying Squirrels for 2013 and 2014. The Giants promoted Parker to the major 
leagues for one day in August 2014, but he did not appear in a game before 
being optioned to Triple-A Fresno. Because he was on the Major League roster 
for part of the season, Parker received a 2014 World Series ring, even 
though he did not play in the majors.[4] In his first four minor league 
seasons, Parker hit 61 home runs and stole 73 bases, hitting .255 and striking 
out over 100 times each season.[5] Parker was promoted for the second time

playing right field and batting 0-for-3 with two strikeouts.[7] On June

Diamondbacks at home. In four games, Parker batted .111 (1-for-9) with 
five strikeouts. He was optioned back to Triple-A Sacramento when Gregor 
Blanco returned from the disabled list on June 19.[8] Parker was recalled 
on September 11, 2015, and hit his first RBI that night against the San 
Diego Padres.[9] On September 25, Parker hit a home run into the center 
field seats at the Oakland Coliseum estimated at 474 feet (144 m).[10] 
On September 26, in a 14–10 Giants victory over the Oakland A's, Parker

in one game, and the first Giant with three homers and seven RBIs since
