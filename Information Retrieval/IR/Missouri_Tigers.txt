The Missouri Tigers athletics programs include the extramural and intramural 
sports teams of the University of Missouri, located in Columbia, Missouri, 
United States. The name comes from a band of armed guards called the Fighting 
Tigers of Columbia who, in 1864, protected Columbia from guerrillas during 
the Civil War.[2] The University of Missouri (often referred to as Mizzou 
or MU) is the flagship institution of the University of Missouri System.[3] 
The women's teams are sometimes called the Lady Tigers, but often both 
the men's and women's teams are simply called the Tigers. Mizzou is a member 
of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and is the only NCAA Football Bowl 
Subdivision program in Missouri. Its wrestling program, the only one sponsored 
by an SEC member school, competes in the Mid-American Conference. Prior 
to joining the SEC in 2012, Missouri was a charter member of the Big 12 
Conference, which was created with the merger of the former Big Eight Conference 
and four schools from the former Southwest Conference (one of these schools, 
Texas A&M, joined the SEC with Missouri in 2012), and which began athletic 
competition in the 1996–97 academic year. Missouri competed in the Missouri 
Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association starting in 1907, which officially 
changed its name to the Big Eight Conference in 1964. The Missouri Tigers 
are represented in the following NCAA Division I varsity sports: Men's 
sports Women's sports The first Missouri Tigers baseball team was in 1868. 
The first recorded season was in 1891, when the Tigers went 2–2. The Tigers 
won the National Championship in 1954. The presence of former Missouri 
Tiger baseball players in professional baseball continues to grow each 
year. Current MU head coach Tim Jamieson has seen 40 players in his 13-year 
tenure sign pro contracts. Notable Tiger baseball alumni include Tim Laudner, 
who played for the 1987 World Champion Minnesota Twins, and Phil Bradley, 
who played for several teams in 1980s and early 1990s, and current Major 
Leaguer Ian Kinsler. In 2006, pitcher Max Scherzer was selected in the 
first round with the 11th overall pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Scherzer 
went on to win the Al Cy Young Award with the Detroit Tigers in 2013. In 
2008, pitcher Aaron Crow was picked 9th overall by the Washington Nationals. 
The men's basketball program has produced several NBA players, including 
Anthony Peeler, Doug Smith, Jon Sundvold, Steve Stipanovich, Kareem Rush, 
Keyon Dooling, Linas Kleiza, Thomas Gardner, Jordan Clarkson and DeMarre 
Carroll. The Tigers were regularly a national power under Norm Stewart, 
whose tenure spanned four decades but which failed to include a Final Four 
appearance despite numerous conference championships. The team advanced 
to the Elite Eight under Quin Snyder in 2002, but inconsistent performance 
and various improprieties in his leadership of the program caused him to 
be fired in the midst of an abysmal 2006 season. He was replaced with then-UAB 
head coach Mike Anderson. In 2009 the team lost in the Elite Eight to the 
Connecticut Huskies. Then, after a first-round exit from the NCAA tournament 
in 2011, Anderson took the head coaching position with the University of 
Arkansas. The head coaching vacancy was filled in early April 2011 with 
Frank Haith, the former Miami (Florida) head coach who left after the 2013 
season to go Tulsa. In 2014, Kim Anderson became the new head basketball 
coach. The 1920–21 and 1921–22 teams were retroactively named national 
champions by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[4] The current head coach of 
the women's basketball program is Robin Pingeton, formerly of Illinois 
State. She was hired in April 2010 to replace Cindy Stein, who resigned 
under pressure from boosters and media after the 2009–10 season. The university's 
first football team was formed in 1890 by the sophomore class of the "Academic 
School" (now the College of Arts and Science). They challenged a team of 
Engineering students in April of that year upon encouragement of Dr. A. 
L. McRea, a university professor. Interest in the sport quickly grew among 
the students, professors, and administrators, and a Foot Ball Association 
was formed at a meeting on October 10, 1890. The first intercollegiate 
game for the university took place on Thanksgiving Day, 1890, when Missouri 
played Washington University before a crowd of 3,000 in St. Louis, Missouri. 
The Washington University team, which had already been playing for several 
years, easily defeated the University of Missouri team by a score of 28–0. 
Missouri has compiled a 15–16 record in bowl games, including a 41-31 victory 
over Oklahoma State in the 2014 Cotton Bowl and a 33-17 win over Minnesota 
in the 2015 Citrus Bowl. It has finished in the final Associated Press 
poll Top Ten eight times since the poll began in 1936, and has had two 
top-five finishes since 2007. Missouri softball began play in 1975. Missouri 
has appeared in seven Women's College World Series, in 1981, 1983, 1991, 
1994, 2009, 2010 and 2011.[5] Hearnes Center is home to the Missouri Tigers' 
nationally ranked wrestling program. For 16 years Brian Smith has been 
the university's head wrestling coach. Since 1998, Smith has received honors 
for his coaching accomplishments at the University of Missouri: Dan Gable 
Coach of the Year (2007), NWCA President (2010-12), Big 12 Coach of the 
Year (2012).[6] Ben Askren is among the few from the university's wrestling 
program to make the transition to Mixed Martial Arts. Ben Askren is a 4-time 
All-American wrestler (2004-2007), 2-time NCAA Division I Collegiate National 
Runner-up (2004, 2005), 2-time NCAA Division I Collegiate National Champion 
(2006, 2007), and 2-time Dan Hodge Trophy Collegiate Wrestler of the Year 
(2006, 2007). He has been inducted into the University of Missouri Intercollegiate 
Athletics Hall of Fame (2012). He is now a grappler, mixed martial artist 
and the former Bellator Lightweight Champion, known for his effective wrestling. 
Michael Chandler is a former Tiger wrestler earning All-American honors 
in 2009 (5th place 157 lbs.) who is the former Bellator Lightweight Champion. 
The University of Missouri Men's Rugby Club plays Division 1-AA college 
rugby in the Heart of America conference against traditional rivals such 
as Kansas and Kansas State.[7] Mizzou has been led since 2010 by head coach 
J.P. Victor. Missouri rugby finished the 2011–2012 season ranked 17th.[8] 
As the winner of the Heart of America conference, Missouri qualified for 
the playoffs of the 2012 men's collegiate DI-AA championships, reaching 
the round of 16 before losing to Wisconsin.[9] Mizzou defeated Kansas 24–7 
to finish third at the 2012 Heart of America 7s tournament.[10] Mizzou 
was again successful during the 2013–2014 season, reaching the D1-AA national 
playoffs, where they defeated Middle Tennessee 46–10 in the round of 16 
before losing in the quarterfinals to Bowling Green.[11] The University 
of Missouri Club Racquetball team is pretty neat. The women's team won 
back-to-back Division 1 titles in 2015 and 2016 at the USA Racquetball 
Intercollegiate Championships. The overall team placed 2nd and 3rd respectively 
in those years. The team's president is Dan Witt. He is single. Missouri's 
newest rivalry after joining the SEC is with the Arkansas Razorbacks, known 
as the Battle Line Rivalry. Both the Razorbacks and Tigers have played 
five times before playing annually in the same conference which started 
in 2014. Arkansas was one of the founding members of the Southwest Conference 
along with the Texas Longhorns. The Razorbacks left the Southwest Conference 
to join the SEC, which triggered the Southwest and the Big Eight Conferences 
to merged to form the Big 12 in 1996. Arkansas is placed in the West Division 
of the SEC while Missouri is placed in the East and with the SEC current 
football scheduling format a team from the West and the East divisions 
must play annually. To keep traditional rivalries ongoing in the SEC, the 
conference dropped Arkansas's cross-division annual match up with South 
Carolina to replace the Gamecocks with the Tigers due to the proximity 
of the two universities. Missouri currently leads the football series 4–2.[citation 
needed] Also known as Battle for Columbia due to the two universities in 
the city of Columbia in their respective states. Both the Tigers and the 
Gamecocks play for Missouri's newest Trophy game, the Mayors' Cup. The 
trophy was created in 2012 when Missouri joined the conference. Both teams 
are in the East division of the SEC and will play annually along with the 
other five members of the division. Missouri currently leads the football 
series at 3–2, while the trophy series is tied at two[citation needed] 
Historically, the Tigers' biggest rival was the Kansas Jayhawks, with whom 
they competed in the annual Border War. This was one of the most intense 
rivalries in college sports, going back to a time of actual armed conflict 
between pro-slavery residents from Missouri and anti-slavery residents 
of the Kansas Territory, known as Bleeding Kansas.[12] The series ended 
for the foreseeable future once Mizzou moved to the SEC. The Kansas–Missouri 
football series is the second-oldest and second-most-played rivalry in 
college football history. (See: The Rivalry (Lehigh–Lafayette)) The teams 
first matched up in football on October 31, 1891. Missouri claims to lead 
the all-time series, 57–54–9, since it counts the forfeit of Kansas' 1960 
victory as a win.[13][14] Missouri claims the 1911 football game in Columbia, 
Missouri as the world's first Homecoming.[15] An important meeting between 
the Tigers and Jayhawks occurred on November 24, 2007 when the two teams 
played for the Big 12 North Championship and a shot at playing for the 
Big 12 Championship and a possible National Championship. The Tigers defeated 
the Jayhawks 36–28. The Tigers season later resulted in a trip to the Cotton 
Bowl Classic, where they defeated Arkansas 38–7. The Missouri-Nebraska 
football series was another historic rivalry alongside the MU–KU series, 
although it ended with Nebraska's departure for the Big Ten Conference. 
The Missouri–Nebraska series was the second oldest rivalry in the Big 12, 
dating back to 1892. The two teams met 104 times, with Nebraska leading 
the series 65–36–3. The large lead was the result of a 24-year Nebraska 
winning streak from 1979 to 2002. The teams split the eight games played 
from 2003 to 2010. The rivalry saw renewed interest following the Flea 
Kicker. The two teams played for the Victory Bell trophy, which was first 
awarded in 1927. There is also a relatively new basketball rivalry with 
the Illinois Fighting Illini of the Big Ten Conference referred to as Braggin' 
Rights. The Braggin' Rights game debuted in 1980 and has been played every 
year since 1983. Missouri trails the series 20–11. The start of football 
season also often matches the two schools in the "Arch Rivalry" game, most 
recently played at the Edward Jones Dome. Mizzou leads the football series 
with an all-time record of 14–7 since 1896. In addition, the Missouri and 
Illinois baseball teams have recently begun a baseball rivalry, meeting 
at Busch Stadium since 2005 (though the schools did not meet in 2009 or 
2011). Missouri leads the series 5-1 since 2005. The Tiger–Sooner Peace 
Pipe is a rivalry trophy presented to the winner of the Missouri vs. Oklahoma 
game. The trophy is a ceremony of smoking the old pipe. The trophy was 
inaugurated in 1929 by Chester M. Brewer, Mizzou's director of athletics, 
and by members of Mystical Seven, a University of Missouri honorary group. 
The peace pipe was donated by a Mr. R. L. Hill, an "M" man and former president 
of the Missouri student body. Ceremony takes place during halves, with 
Mystical Seven representing Missouri, and a similar organization representing 
Oklahoma. Missouri won the first game, 13–0. During Mizzou's tenure in 
the Big 12, the conference's divisional play structure meant that the Tigers 
and the Sooners only faced off two out every four years. Therefore, only 
scheduled games between the two teams count for the exchange of the Peace 
Pipe. The most recent Big 12 Championship games featuring Mizzou and Oklahoma 
would not have triggered a transfer of the Peace Pipe (if Missouri had 
won on either occasion.) Oklahoma leads the all-time series with a record 
of 65–23–5. In 2010, Mizzou, ranked no. 11 in the BCS standings, defeated 
no. 1 ranked Oklahoma, 36–27. Oklahoma leads the series since the trophy 
tradition started with a record of 56–14–4. The Telephone Trophy started 
during a 1959 Game featuring Iowa State and Missouri when the field phones 
were tested prior to the game, it was found that both teams could hear 
each other. The problem was solved by game time, but not without considerable 
worry on the part of the coaches. The Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. of 
Ames had a trophy made and presented it to Iowa State to be awarded each 
year to the team winning the game. An odd sidelight to the whole affair 
was that the same thing happened to Missouri later in the year in a game 
played at Columbia. Missouri won the first game, 14–0. The series is 58–34–9 
in favor of Missouri. Missouri leads the series since the trophy tradition 
started with a record of 30–18–3. The University of Missouri claims to 
be the originator of the tradition of homecoming.[15] Before, games against 
the University of Kansas were played in Kansas City. However, a change 
in conference regulations required intercollegiate football games to be 
played on campus starting in 1911. Fearing that game attendance would be 
low, the new Missouri coach, C. L. Brewer, appealed with great success 
for the "Old Grads" to "Come Back Home" to boost attendance and help dedicate 
MU's new football field. The fans responded, swelling the crowd at Rollins 
Field in Columbia to more than ten thousand. MU, Trivial Pursuit, and Jeopardy! 
all verify that this game in 1911 was one of the first homecoming games. 
The 2010 edition of the University of Missouri Homecoming also included 
the first ever visit by ESPN College GameDay. 18,000 fans attended College 
GameDay at the Francis Quadrangle on Saturday, October 23, 2010. The turnout 
broke the previous record of 15,800 fans set at the University of Nebraska 
in 2001.[16][17][18] Big MO is a 6-foot, 150-pound bass drum featured at 
Mizzou football games. Big MO's handlers are actually University of Missouri 
alumni rather than student members of Marching Mizzou. Big MO is used to 
lead fans in the traditional MIZ-ZOU cheer. The drum has been a Mizzou 
football tradition since 1981, when it was acquired by a Mizzou athletic 
booster club known as the St. Louis Quarterback Club. The club donated 
$5,000 to purchase the drum, which was built by Ludwig Drums in Chicago. 
The drum, originally painted red with gold flakes, was brought back from 
Chicago strapped in the back of a pickup truck. When it arrived in Columbia, 
the drum was repainted black and presented to the university a week before 
the first 1981 football game at an event known as the Tiger Fall Rally. 
Responsibility for Big MO was transferred to the Mizzou chapters of Kappa 
Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma in 1993. Only student and alumni members of 
the two organizations are eligible to be on the Big MO crew. Big MO is 
the third largest bass drum in the United States, behind Big Bertha at 
the University of Texas and the Purdue Big Bass Drum.[19][20] In April 
2011, the Mizzou chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma kicked 
off a fundraising campaign to replace Big MO, which deteriorated over several 
decades of use. The current Big MO weighs 800-plus-pounds and has a 9-foot 
diameter and a 54-inch width, making it the largest collegiate bass drum 
as well as largest bass drum in the United States. The new drum was built 
by Neil Boumpani of Boumpani Music Company, a custom drum maker in Barnesville, 
Georgia. The new record-setting Big MO debuted when Mizzou entered play 
in the Southeastern Conference in 2012.[21][22][23] Since 1971, there has 
been no doubt about the destination of the goal posts any time they have 
been torn down following a home football game. 1971 marked the first year 
in which the goal posts ended up at Harpo's Bar and Grill at 29 S. Tenth 
Street in Columbia. Although no concrete reasoning is known behind the 
tradition, it is suggested that Harpo's became the destination because 
of its popularity among alumni returning to Columbia on game days and because 
the restaurant is one of the few places that had remained under consistent 
ownership without any name changes, so alumni and students all easily identify 
with the establishment.[24] Following the 2005 season, removable goal posts 
were installed, which are lowered at the close of each home game. In 2010 
the goal post tradition was revived following the victory against BCS #1 
ranked Oklahoma. Thousands of fans began to swarm the field before the 
final play had even ended. Although there were event staff and highway 
patrol encircling the field, security was unable to prevent fans from storming 
the field and removing the north end zone goal post from the stadium.[25] 
The Alma Mater for the University of Missouri is Old Missouri. It was written 
in 1895 and is sung to the tune of Annie Lisle and has two verses. Before 
and after athletic events, sometimes only the first verse is used. The 
first and second verses are more commonly sung at student orientation and 
at commencement/graduation ceremonies. Both verses are followed by the 
chorus. Missouri has won 2 NCAA team national championships.[26] The Tiger 
Radio Network is anchored by KMBZ in Kansas City, KTGR AM/KCMQ FM in Columbia 
and Jefferson City, and KTRS in St Louis. Mike Kelly is the commentator 
for both sports, with Howard Richards and Chris Gervino serving as analysts 
for football and Gary Link filling in for basketball. In addition, the 
school owns and operates its own NBC affiliate, KOMU-TV, in Columbia. The 
station is run by MU faculty members and is staffed by professionals and 
students. It's the only college-owned and operated network affiliate in 
the country. For indoor sports, Mizzou operates the Missouri Sports Network, 
a syndication package that airs on FSN Midwest and/or Metro Sports. It 
mainly broadcasts volleyball and basketball. Dan McLaughlin handles play-by-play 
for all sports, and is joined by a rotating group of color commentators, 
most notably Tigers coaching legend Norm Stewart for men's basketball games.
