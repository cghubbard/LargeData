On March 31, 2016, the club assigned him to Triple-A Memphis. However, 
due to an injury to backup catcher Brayan Peña, he made the major league 
Opening Day roster as the backup to Yadier Molina.[15] Fryer's first hit 
and RBI came in his first plate appearance of the season on April 9 against 
the Atlanta Braves.[16] He made his first start on April 17 at Busch Stadium 
against the Cincinnati Reds. He reached base in all four plate appearances, 
including three hits in three at bats and first walk of the season, to
