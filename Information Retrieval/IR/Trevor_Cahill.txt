Trevor John Cahill (March 1, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has previously played for the 
Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs. 
He was named an All-Star in 2010, and finished that year 18-8 with a 2.97 
ERA. The Oakland Athletics drafted Cahill in the second round (66th overall) 
of the 2006 MLB draft out of Vista High School. In his first full season 
in minor league baseball, with the Kane County Cougars, he went 11–4 with 
a 2.73 earned run average, 117 strikeouts and 105 1⁄3 innings pitched over 
19 starts to earn a Class A All-Star nod from Baseball America. Cahill 
began 2008 with the Stockton Ports of the California League. He went 5–4 
with a 2.78 ERA and 103 strikeouts to earn a California League All star 
selection and a promotion to AA. He also represented America in Major League 
Baseball's Futures Game. With the RockHounds, Cahill was 6–1 with a 2.19 
ERA before shutting it down in order to compete with the United States 
national baseball team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[1] Entering 
the 2009 season, Cahill was ranked 11th among Baseball America's Top 100 
Prospects,[2] and made the Athletics starting rotation out of Spring training 
along with his Olympic teammate Brett Anderson. On April 7, 2009, Cahill 
made his Major League debut against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
going 5 innings, allowing 5 hits, 2 earned runs, striking out 1 and received 
a no decision.[3] Cahill came into the 2010 season as a starter for the 
A's, quickly becoming one of the breakout pitchers of the year. He put 
up borderline Cy Young Award-worthy statistics, finishing the season with 
an 18–8 record and an ERA of 2.97, making it into the Top 5 of lowest ERA 
in the American League, behind Félix Hernández, Clay Buchholz, and David 
Price, all three considered among best pitchers in the American League. 
His WHIP was also in the Top 5, with 1.11 WHIP. For the 2011 season, high 
expectations were set for Cahill. Cahill began the season as the A's #1 
starter. Cahill did not replicate his 2010 performance, despite logging 
in 207 innings in 34 starts. Cahill finished 12-14 with a 4.16 ERA for 
Oakland. On December 9, 2011, Cahill and Craig Breslow were traded to the 
Arizona Diamondbacks for Ryan Cook, Jarrod Parker, and Collin Cowgill.[4] 
In his first season in Arizona, Cahill bettered his 2011 performance by 
going 13-12 in 32 starts. He pitched more than 200 innings for the second 
straight year and struck out a career high 156 batters. In 2013, through 
17 starts, Cahill was 3-10 with a 4.66 ERA. After his 17th start, Cahill 
was put on the disabled list for the first time in his career.[5] Cahill 
missed more than a month due to a hip contusion. He came back in mid August. 
After his stint in the disabled list, Cahill finished the season on a 5-game 
winning streak, finishing the 2013 season with a 8-10 record in 25 starts. 
He led the league in wild pitches with 17. Cahill struggled mightily at 
the beginning of the 2014 season. He first began the season 0-4 with a 
9.17 ERA, then he was demoted to the bullpen the following week.[6] Cahill 
made 15 appearances out of the bullpen, recording his first save of his 
career and lowering his ERA to 5.17. Despite this, Cahill's control didn't 
seem to get better, he was designated for assignment on June 9.[7] After 
going unclaimed, the D'Backs sent him to Single A to fix his mechanical 
issues.[8] After a month in the minors, Cahill was recalled on July 14.[9] 
Cahill was quickly inserted back into the rotation. Cahill finished his 
rocky 2014 season with a career worst 3-12 record and a career high 5.61 
ERA in 32 games (17 starts) for the D'Backs. On April 2, 2015, he was traded 
to the Braves in exchange for minor league player Josh Elander.[10] He 
made his Braves debut on April 14, yielding four earned runs in 2 1⁄3 innings.[11] 
On June 11, 2015, he was designated for assignment.[12] He was released 
on June 20.[13] On July 2, 2015, Cahill signed a minor league contract 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[14] He started seven games in the Dodgers 
system between three levels and was 1–3 with a 5.24 ERA before exercising 
his opt out and becoming a free agent on August 14.[15] Cahill signed a 
minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs on August 18, 2015.[16] On October 
10th, 2015, Cahill pitched in the National League Division Series against 
the St. Louis Cardinals and pitched a scoreless inning of relief. It was 
only the third time he was used in the 8th inning or beyond in 2015. On 
December 14, 2015, Cahill re-signed with the Cubs on a 1-year, $4.25 million 
contract.[17] Cahill's was mostly in the bullpen in 2016, making 50 appearances, 
finishing the year 4-4 with a 2.74 ERA. The Cubs finished the season with 
a 103-58 record for an NL Central pennant, and would eventually win the 
2016 World Series. Cahill did not make any postseason appearances, but 
still won the World Series for the first time in his career.[18] Cahill 
attended Vista High School and committed to Dartmouth College before eventually 
signing with the A's.[19] He got a 1950 out of 2400 on the SAT.[20] In 
the offseason, he lives in Oceanside, California, with his wife, Jessica. 
Cahill's best pitch is his sinker, which features excellent downward movement 
and ranges from 88–92 mph. His sinker is his most frequent offering and 
is the main reason why he gets so many ground balls. Cahill also has a 
changeup in the 81–83 mph range, which like his fastball also features 
excellent downward movement. This is a pitch that he uses frequently against 
left-handers to get strikeouts. Starting in the 2010 season, Cahill began 
featuring a 12–6 curveball as well. His curve, which ranges in the 76–80 mph 
range, has become his main strikeout weapon, and he can get hitters to 
chase it out of the zone as well as freezing hitters with it in the zone. 
Cahill also features a rare mid-80s slider against righties, though it 
is a below average pitch.[citation needed] In 2012, Cahill added a cutter 
to his repertoire. Since 2012, he has thrown fewer fastballs and gone with
