Bay Ridge is a neighborhood in the southwest corner of the New York City 
borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by Sunset Park on the north, Dyker Heights 
on the east, the Narrows and the Belt Parkway on the west, Fort Hamilton 
Army Base in the southwest corner, and the Verrazano Bridge on the south. 
The first Dutch settlers began farming here in the 17th century.[4] Well 
into the 19th century, what’s now considered Bay Ridge consisted of two 
sister villages: Yellow Hook to the north, named for the color of the soil, 
and Fort Hamilton to the south, named for the military installation at 
its center. The latter began to develop in the 1830s as a resort destination 
to lodge visitors to the army base. The former began to develop after 1850, 
when a group of artists moved to the area and founded a colony called Ovington 
Village; before that, it was mostly farmland. In the 1850s, the village 
changed the community’s name to avoid association with yellow fever.[5] 
"Bay Ridge" was suggested by local horticulturist James Weir after the 
area’s most prominent geographic features: the high ridge that offered 
views of New York Bay.[6][7] The natural beauty attracted the wealthy, 
who built country homes along Shore Road, overlooking the water.[8] By 
World War II, almost all of these large houses had been replaced with apartment 
buildings.[8] In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many Norwegian 
and Danish sailors emigrated to Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge and neighboring 
Sunset Park; Lapskaus Boulevard, referring to the salted Norwegian beef 
stew, was the nickname of Eighth Avenue in this area.[9] Development took 
off after the Fourth Avenue subway (today's R train) arrived in 1916, and 
accelerated through the 1920s, when the number of apartment buildings increased 
fivefold, replacing old farms, homesteads and houses.[10] Construction 
of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects Bay Ridge to Staten Island, 
was completed in 1964. Though now an iconic structure, it was opposed by 
residents because it would require the demolition of many homes and businesses. 
Eight hundred buildings were destroyed, displacing 7,000 people, to make 
room for the bridge and its approach. Also destroyed was Fort Lafayette, 
part of New York City's defense system along with Fort Hamilton and Fort 
Wadsworth in Staten Island, replaced by the base of the bridge's east tower.[11] 
The Senator Street Historic District was listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places in 2002.[12] The Houses at 216-264 Ovington Ave. was 
listed in 2007.[12] The 2007 Brooklyn tornado hit this area, specifically 
68th Street and Bay Ridge Avenue between Third and Fourth Avenues.[13] 
Eleven houses had to be vacated after they suffered significant damage, 
and many of the trees on the two blocks toppled, landing on cars and stoops. 
The 4th Avenue Presbyterian Church had its very large stained glass window 
blown out.[14] As the tornado lifted, it peeled the roof of a nearby Nissan 
dealership and deforested 40% of Leif Ericson Park. The tornado has been 
rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds between 111 and 
135 MPH.[15] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population 
of Bay Ridge was 79,371, a decrease of 1,168 (1.5%) from the 80,539 counted 
in 2000. Covering an area of 1,571.96 acres (636.15 ha), the neighborhood 
had a population density of 50.5 inhabitants per acre (32,300/sq mi; 12,500/km2).[2] 
The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 66.4% (52,740) White, 1.8% (1,457) 
African American, 0.1% (83) Native American, 13.3% (10,530) Asian, 0.0% 
(19) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (265) from other races, and 2.1% (1,682) from 
two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 15.9% (12,595) of 
the population.[16] Bay Ridge is a largely middle-class neighborhood. With 
its strong family presence, it is not uncommon to see third or fourth generation 
families living in the region. Until the early 1990s Bay Ridge was a primarily 
Irish, Italian, and Norwegian[17] neighborhood. This area used to be highly 
Norwegian. Its Nordic heritage is still apparent in the neighborhood. For 
instance, there is an annual Norwegian Constitution Day Parade, also known 
as the Syttende Mai Parade, featuring hundreds of people in folk dress 
who parade down Third Avenue. It ends in Leif Ericson Park, named for the 
Viking explorer, where "Miss Norway" is crowned near the statue of Leif 
Ericson. The statue was donated by Crown Prince Olav, Prince of Norway, 
on behalf of the nation of Norway in 1939.[18][19] There is also a Norwegian 
gifts-and-groceries store. As of 1971, the 30,000-strong Norwegian community 
of Bay Ridge boasted that it was the fourth-largest Norwegian city in the 
world.[20] Residents also compared Eighth Avenue's string of Norwegian 
businesses to Oslo's Karljohans Gate.[20] Today, Bay Ridge's population 
is around 80,000[21] and maintains a sizable Irish, Italian, and Greek 
population. However, like other areas in South/Southwest Brooklyn, late 
in the 20th century it saw an influx of Russian, Polish, and Lebanese, 
and lesser numbers of Chinese. In recent decades many Middle Eastern and 
Arab Americans have moved to Bay Ridge. It has even been referred to as 
"the heart of Brooklyn's Arab community."[22] Bay Ridge has many international 
restaurants and bars, especially along 3rd and 5th Avenue, its main commercial 
strips. Bay Ridge has a high elderly population. It has been called a NORC 
or a naturally occurring retirement community because many of its families 
have grown up in the neighborhood while their children moved away. In 2006, 
it was reported that 20% of the population of Bay Ridge is 60 years of 
age or over.[23] Famous fictional residents of Bay Ridge include Peggy 
Olson of Mad Men and Tony Manero, played by John Travolta, of Saturday 
Night Fever. Local newspapers include The Home Reporter and Sunset News 
and The Bay Ridge Courier. The neighborhood is also often covered by The 
Brooklyn Daily Eagle. (These papers publish other local offshoots: The 
Home Reporter also publishes The Spectator; the Courier's parent company 
also publishes The Brooklyn Paper; and the Eagle publishes a weekly digest 
called Bay Ridge Life.) Development has been a passionate issue for Bay 
Ridge residents, as in recent years they saw many of the decades-old two-family 
houses being demolished, replaced by condominiums known colloquially as 
"Fedder Homes," after the branded air conditioners poking out from the 
buildings' facades. The six-story apartment complexes lining Shore Road 
are among the tallest buildings in the neighborhood.[21] In 2005, local 
community leaders and community activists from across the political spectrum 
united to issue rezoning laws.[24] Bay Ridge was chosen as an "Editor's 
Pick" in This Old House magazine April 2011 as a good neighborhood to buy 
an old house.[25] Historic Fort Hamilton Army Base is located in the southwestern 
corner of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, with gates in Bay Ridge 
and Dyker Heights, and is one of several posts that are part of the region 
which is headquartered by the Military District of Washington. Its mission 
is to provide the New York metropolitan area with military installation 
support for the Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve. 
The base is considered to be part of Bay Ridge. The children stationed 
at the base are zoned into Bay Ridge schools. Bay Ridge is patrolled by 
the New York City Police Department's 68th[36] Precinct. It is served by 
Engine 241, Engine 242, and Ladder 109 of the New York City Fire Department. 
Bay Ridge is also served by a BRAVO Volunteer Ambulance. The area is served 
by the R train on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway 
between Bay Ridge Avenue and 95th Street.[37] Additionally, there are MTA 
express bus routes X27, X37 which mainly serve for the commute to Manhattan, 
but also run during off-peak hours on weekdays. The X27 also runs on weekends. 
The routes X28, X38 also serve the eastern part of Bay Ridge. Many Bay 
Ridge commuters opt for the relative comfort and convenience of the express 
bus. Bay Ridge is readily accessible by car, encircled by the Belt Parkway 
and Gowanus Expressway. Local bus routes include B1, B4, B8, B9, B16, B37, 
B63, B64, B70, S53, S79 SBS, S93.[38] The freight-only Bay Ridge Branch 
connects car floats to the Long Island Rail Road. Bay Ridge is expected 
to be served by the Citywide Ferry Service[39] starting in 2017.[40][41] 
New York City Department of Education operates area public schools. Educational 
institutions in Bay Ridge include; P.S. 102,[42] P.S. 170, P.S. 127, P.S. 
185[43] (Walter Kassenbrock Elementary School), P.S. 104[44] (called the 
Fort Hamilton School), Lutheran Elementary School, St. Anselm's Roman Catholic 
School, I.S. 30[45] (also known as Mary White Ovington), I.S.259 (also 
known as William McKinley Junior High School) Angels Catholic Academy[46] 
Holy Bay Ridge Preparatory School,[47] Fort Hamilton High School, High 
School of Telecommunications (originally all-girls Bay Ridge High School), 
Poly Prep Country Day School, Visitation Academy, Adelphi Academy, Fontbonne 
Hall Academy, St. Patrick Elementary School, D., G. Kaloidis Parochial 
School,[48] and Xaverian High School. Fort Hamilton High School, between 
83rd and 85th streets, was erected in the 1940s on the grounds of the Crescent 
Athletic Club, a country club. The High School of Telecommunications was 
formerly Bay Ridge High School, which was once an all-girls school. Brooklyn 
Public Library (BPL) operates the Bay Ridge Library. The Bay Ridge Reading 
Club first organized the library in 1880. It opened on its present site 
in 1896 and became a BPL branch in 1901. The current two story facility 
opened in 1960. In 2004 it received a $2.1 million renovation, including 
new furniture and shelving, new lighting equipment, a new roof, and 27 
additional public access computers.[49] A smaller public library is the 
Fort Hamilton Library, built with money gift from Andrew Carnegie in 1906. 
The current branch's predecessor was founded over 100 years ago. It became 
a part of the BPL system in 1901 and moved to its current location in 1905. 
Since then it has gone through numerous renovations. The most recent renovation 
was completed in March 2011, with a ribbon cutting ceremony held on April 
11, 2011.[50] Bay Ridge is recognized as politically conservative.[51] 
Mike Long, Chairman of the Conservative Party of New York, resides there. 
It has been known to elect Democrats to office, such as City Councilmember 
Vincent J. Gentile. Bay Ridge, which has shared a congressional district 
with Staten Island since the 1980s,[52] is represented in the United States 
Congress by Republican Dan Donovan, in the New York State Senate by Republican 
Marty Golden and in the New York State Assembly by Republican Nicole Malliotakis. 
Democratic Assemblymember Alec Brook-Krasny resigned in July 2015.[53] 
Republican Michael Grimm was elected to Congress in 2010, and he resigned 
in 2015, following a 20-count indictment; he pleaded guilty to one count 
of federal tax evasion and was sentenced to eight months in prison.[54] 
The neighborhood is served by Brooklyn Community Board 10. Coordinates:
