Aaron Ryan Rowand (born August 29, 1977) is an American former professional 
baseball center fielder in Major League Baseball. He played for the Chicago 
White Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants.[1] When 
Rowand was about 10 years old, he frequently played slow-pitch softball 
in an adult league with his dad, Bob.[2] He attended Glendora High School 
in California and graduated in 1995.[3] Drafted by the New York Mets, he 
elected to go to college instead.[1] He attended California State University, 
Fullerton from 1996 to 1998.[1] In 1998, Rowand earned All-America honors 
before being selected by the Chicago White Sox in the first round (35th 
pick) of the 1998 amateur draft.[1] During his senior season, Rowand had 
27 doubles.[4] On June 15, 2001, Rowand was called up to the Chicago White 
Sox for the first time.[5] He made his major league debut for them the 
next day, on June 16,[1] as a pinch hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals.[6] 
He finished his rookie season fourth among American League rookies in batting 
average at .293.[1] He collected his first major league hit on June 19, 
2001, against Kansas City Royals' pitcher Tony Cogan.[5] Rowand suffered 
a broken left shoulder blade and rib in a dirt bike accident in the 2002 
off season and spent part of spring training recovering.[7] In 2003, Rowand 
was sent down to the minor leagues[8] after hitting .133 in his first 60 
games, but after spending 32 games in the minors, he returned to hit in 
the Major Leagues, hitting .387 after his return. 2004 was his 1st season 
with close to 500 at bats and Rowand established himself as a regular starter 
for the first time in his career.[1] Rowand showed patience at the plate 
and posted his second highest career on-base percentage at .361.[1] In 
2005 with the White Sox, he had a .270 batting average with 77 runs and 
30 doubles. He also hit 13 home runs and stole 16 bases.[1] He was walked 
32 times, compared to 116 strikeouts.[1] He had a .329 on-base percentage 
(OBP) and a .407 slugging percentage (SLG). He also collected 235 total 
bases.[1] In 2005, at center field, he collected 388 putouts and had only 
three errors. He had a .978 fielding percentage.[1] The 2005 Chicago White 
Sox went on to win the World Series.[9] In the postseason, he had a .267 
batting average with 8 runs and 6 doubles. He also walked 4 times and had 
1 stolen base. On November 23, 2005, Rowand was traded by the White Sox 
along with minor league pitchers Gio Gonzalez and Daniel Haigwood to the 
Philadelphia Phillies for first baseman Jim Thome.[1] On May 11, 2006, 
in the first inning of a game versus the New York Mets, Rowand made a spectacular 
play by smashing into the center field fence of Citizens Bank Park face 
first at full speed in order to run down a deep fly ball off the bat of 
Xavier Nady with the bases loaded, that would otherwise have scored three 
runs.[10] Rowand suffered a broken nose and severe lacerations to his face.[10] 
The Phillies won the game, 2-0, in a rain-shortened 5-inning game.[11] 
He underwent seven hours of surgery to repair the nose, and was placed 
on the 15-day disabled list.[10] He returned to the starting lineup on 
May 27, 2006.[12] On August 21, 2006, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, 
Rowand collided with second baseman Chase Utley and broke his ankle. He 
was on the disabled list for the remainder of the regular season.[13] 2007, 
a contract year, proved to be Rowand's breakthrough, both statistically 
and in recognition around baseball. He finished with a batting average 
of .309, 27 home runs, 89 runs batted in, and 6 stolen bases.[1] On July 
10, 2007, Rowand was selected to the 2007 MLB All-Star Game in San Francisco, 
for his first All-Star appearance.[1] In the bottom of the 9th, with the 
bases loaded, two outs, and the AL leading 5-4, Rowand flew out to Alex 
Ríos in right field to end the game helping give the American League home 
field advantage in the 2007 World Series.[14] He earned his first Gold 
Glove Award for his outfield play that year, including 11 outfield assists 
and only 2 errors all season.[1] Rowand signed a five-year-$60 million 
contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 12, 2007.[15] In the 
face of dismal expectations for the rebuilding season, Rowand declared 
the next month that the Giants could win the division.[16] Rowand's prediction 
did not come true, however, as the 2008 Giants struggled to a 72-90 finish.[17] 
Rowand himself did not come close to his 2007 numbers with Philadelphia, 
as his OPS dropped by over one hundred points to .749, below the .772 league 
average.[1] On May 25, 2008, Rowand hit his 100th career home run at Dolphin 
Stadium.[18] On July 10, 2009, with one out in the ninth inning, Rowand 
made a leaping catch at the center field wall to rob Edgar Gonzalez of 
a hit and preserve Jonathan Sánchez's no hitter. On July 31, 2009, Rowand 
collected his 1,000th career hit at home against his former team, the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[19] On October 28, 2010, Rowand hit a 2 RBI triple in the bottom 
of the eighth inning of Game 2 of the 2010 World Series. He then scored 
off an Andres Torres RBI double to extend the Giants lead 9-0 over the 
Texas Rangers. The Giants won the series, and Rowand earned his second 
World Series championship. Rowand was designated for assignment on August 
31, 2011 after batting .233 with four home runs and 21 RBIs in 108 games 
during the 2011 season.[20] He was released on September 8, 2011.[21] On 
December 12, 2011, Rowand signed a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins 
with an invite to spring training.[22] He was released on March 29, 2012. 
He married Marianne Griffen on November 27, 1999, and has two children, 
Tatum (August 10, 2001) and McKay (December 5, 2004)[5] When he was with 
the Phillies, Rowand and his family lived in Garnet Valley, which is in 
Delaware County, outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[23] Since at least 
2004, his offseason home has been in Las Vegas, Nevada.[24][25] Rowand 
is the first cousin of Chicago White Sox pitcher James Shields.[1] In 2015, 
Rowand served as a guest instructor for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago 
White Sox in Spring Training.[26][27] Rowand also coaches his son's baseball 
team.[26] During Season 3 of American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior, Paul 
Junior Designs built "The Aaron Rowand Bike" which features a similar color
