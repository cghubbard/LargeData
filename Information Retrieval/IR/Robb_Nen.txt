Robert Allen Nen (born November 28, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed relief pitcher. He spent most of his career as a closer. He 
is the son of former major league first baseman Dick Nen. He currently 
works in the Giants' front office as a special assistant to General Manager 
Brian Sabean. Nen is best known for his years with the San Francisco Giants 
(1998–2002), with whom he was a three-time All-Star and played in the 2002 
World Series. He also played with the Texas Rangers (1993) and Florida 
Marlins (1993–97); in 1997, Nen won the World Series championship with 
the Marlins. Nen has 314 career saves with the Marlins (1993–1997; 108 
saves) and Giants (1998–2002; 206 saves). He is 15th overall in career 
saves. Nen wore number 31 as his jersey number throughout his career. He 
attended Los Alamitos High School and played both varsity football and 
baseball with future Giants teammate J. T. Snow. Nen played mostly at third 
base, and also did some pitching. He skipped college and went directly 
to the minor leagues. Nen was selected by the Rangers as a pitcher in the 
32nd round of the 1987 MLB draft. The Rangers promoted him to their Major 
League roster in 1993. His partial season with the Rangers was marred by 
injuries and subpar results on the mound, resulting in a 6.35 earned run 
average. On July 17 of his first year, the Rangers traded Nen and pitcher 
Kurt Miller to the Florida Marlins for Cris Carpenter.[1] Nen started one 
game for his new team and finished the 1993 season with a disappointing 
7.02 ERA. The following season, the Marlins moved him to the bullpen in 
an effort to reduce the frequency of his arm injuries. Nen flourished in 
his new role and became the Marlins' new closer that year. He finished 
the strike-shortened 1994 season with 15 saves and a 2.95 ERA. Nen would 
continue to be a dominating closer for the Marlins, racking up a total 
of 108 saves and establishing himself as one of the elite closers of the 
1990s. During the 1997 postseason, Nen pitched in eight games, including 
two saves in the World Series, as well as 1.2 innings of scoreless relief 
in the 9th and 10th innings of Game 7 while the Marlins came back in the 
last inning, and subsequently won the World Series in the bottom of the 
11th. Throughout the 1997 playoffs, Florida didn't lose a single game in 
which Nen made an appearance. In a controversial move, the Marlins held 
a "fire sale" in which they traded away most of their high-caliber players 
in favor of gaining prospects and utilizing many of their minor league 
players, all while keeping their team payroll low. On November 18, 1997, 
Nen was traded to the Giants for Mike Villano, Joe Fontenot and Mick Pageler. 
Nen was expected to fill in the closer role, a role recently vacated by 
Rod Beck, who left via free agency to the Chicago Cubs. If Beck had set 
the bar high for a San Francisco closer (199 saves in his 7-year tenure 
with the Giants), Nen would raise the bar. His first year yielded 40 saves 
with a 1.52 ERA and 110 strikeouts in 88.7 IP. As a Giant, Nen was selected 
to three All-Star Games (1998, 1999, 2002) and finished 4th in voting for 
the 2000 National League Cy Young Award and 12th in the NL MVP voting (the 
award went to teammate Jeff Kent), both high honors for a closer. The 9th 
inning was affectionately renamed the "Nenth" by fans. Nen's career reached 
its climax in the 2002 World Series. Robb Nen's last game was October 26, 
2002 at Edison International Field (now known as Angel Stadium of Anaheim). 
It was Game 6 (of 7) of the 2002 World Series. The Giants, the National 
League wild card team, and the Anaheim Angels, the American League wild 
card team, played a seven-game series in which Nen earned two saves. The 
Giants entered Game 6 leading the series three games to two. Behind the 
pitching of starter Russ Ortiz, the Giants appeared to be cruising to an 
easy 5-0 victory and their first World Series title since 1954 (when they 
were still the New York Giants). In the seventh inning, however, Ortiz 
ran into trouble and was relieved by Felix Rodríguez. Rodriguez then gave 
up a three-run home run to the Angels' Scott Spiezio. The Angels tacked 
on another run in the eighth with a lead-off home run by Darin Erstad. 
After two more runners reached base safely in the eighth, Nen came in to 
relieve Tim Worrell and try to protect what was now a shaky one-run Giants 
lead. But Nen was unable to shut down the Angels' surge and gave up a two-run 
double to eventual series MVP Troy Glaus, which put the Angels ahead by 
one run. They hung on to win the game, and won the series following a win 
the next day. Nen pitched with full awareness that he was likely jeopardizing 
his career and remains admired by Giants' fans for his self-sacrifice. 
It was, in fact, his final appearance. The 8 save opportunities (7 saved) 
in one postseason is a record, tied in 2015 by Jeurys Familia; the 7 saves 
ties the mark with 5 other pitchers (John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Brad 
Lidge, Koji Uehara and Greg Holland). During the next two seasons, Nen 
spent time rehabilitating from three surgeries for a torn rotator cuff 
that he had aggravated during the middle of the 2002 season. The tear went 
through 40 to 75% of his right shoulder. When his contract with the Giants 
ended after the 2004 season, Nen filed for free agency but was not picked 
up by any team. On February 20, 2005, Nen formally announced his retirement.[2] 
As of 7 May 2015[update], he is the all-time saves leader for the Giants 
with 206 saves.[3] His locker was maintained throughout the 2003 and 2004 
seasons as he last left it and was formally retired in 2005, but his jersey 
continued to hang in the locker room both at home and on the road. Nen 
was known for an unusual delivery in which he tapped his toe on the ground 
before releasing the ball. His signature pitch, a slider, was nicknamed 
"The Terminator." It looked like a fastball until it broke straight down 
at the plate at a velocity of up to 92 mph. In addition to the slider, 
Nen had a fastball that reached the upper 90s. A splitter rounded out Nen's 
pitching arsenal. Nen joined the Giants' baseball operations department 
as an instructor on both the major and minor league levels, while also 
advising general manager Brian Sabean on an as-needed basis. In a ceremony 
before their July 9, 2005 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, the Giants 
honored Nen with a plaque commemorating his 300th career save. The plaque 
is now located on the public walkway behind the right-field wall of AT&T
