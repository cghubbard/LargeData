Albert J. "Cozy" Dolan (born James Alberts, December 23, 1889 – December 
10, 1958) was a Major League Baseball player. The 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 
160-pound outfielder and third baseman played for six teams; the Cincinnati 
Reds (1909), the New York Highlanders (1911–1912), the Philadelphia Phillies 
(1912–1913), the Pittsburgh Pirates (1913), the St. Louis Cardinals (1914–1915) 
and the New York Giants (1922). Over his career he posted career numbers 
of 299 hits, 210 runs, 102 stolen bases, a .339 Slugging percentage, and 
a .252 batting average. In the final series of the 1924 season, the Giants 
were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling 
for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell 
offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to throw the games. Sand rejected 
the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually 
led to the lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Dolan, who was a coach 
for the Giants, by Commissioner Landis, although future-Hall of Famers 
Frankie Frisch, George Kelly, and Ross Youngs were also implicated.[1] 
Dolan was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin on December 23, 1882 to James T. and 
Bridget (Joyce) Dolan.[2] He was the youngest of 7 children.[3] His birth 
record indicates he was named Alvin, but a 1911 newspaper report says, 
"Albert J Dolan, commonly known and called as Alvin Dolan... ."[4] He records 
his name as Albert James Dolan on his World War I draft registration card.[5] 
On January 2, 1907, Albert J. Dolan married Georgia Simpson, daughter of 
Douglas J. and Mary (Abrams) Simpson, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.[6] The couple 
frequently wintered in Oshkosh during Cozy's off season. This tendency 
is evidenced by articles such as the following: "Mr. and Mrs. Albert J. 
Dolan have returned to Oshkosh to spend the winter in this city. They will 
reside at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Simpson, 1316 South Main street. 
Mr. Dolan is a member of the New York American league baseball team" (The 
Daily Northwestern [Oshkosh, Wisconsin], 10 Oct 1911).[7] The city of Oshkosh 
was very proud of their native son and local papers assiduously followed 
his career. Articles such as the following were common: "PLAYS WINNING 
BALL. Alvin Dolan Makes Home Run and Brings Victory to Jersey City Over 
Newark. Alvin Dolan, the Oshkosh young man who formerly played with the 
Oshkosh team in the Wisconsin state league and the W-1 league, and is now 
playing third base with Jersey City in the Eastern league, makes the eastern 
fans sit up by clouting the ball."[8] The article continues to describe 
a specific game and touts Alvin's prowess. Another article shows some of 
Cozy Dolan's personality when he joined the bowlers team of Oshkosh's Elks 
Lodge when they competed in a state tournament in 1915. A review of the 
tournament in The Daily Northwestern (an Oshkosh newspaper) includes the 
following Cozy Dolan antics: "A feature of the Oshkosh expedition to the 
tournament was a concert by the Arions of this city at the Hotel Beaumont, 
Green Bay, at supper-time Saturday. They played in the lobby for an hour, 
under the direction of Albert J. Dolan, the Oshkosh baseball star who plays 
left field for the St. Louis Cardinals. The name "Cozy Dolan" was changed 
to "Dazy Colan" for the time being, and the ball-player-bowler-comedian 
literally brought down the house with his skillful interpretations of the 
wiles and arts of bandmaster. With all the magnetic directive powers of 
a John Philip Sousa, all the grace of a D'Urbando, "Dozy Colan" led the 
Arions in an artistic concert" (The Daily Northwestern (Oshkosh, Wisconsin), 
25 Jan 1915).[9] Cozy Dolan died December 8, 1958 in his hometown of Chicago.
