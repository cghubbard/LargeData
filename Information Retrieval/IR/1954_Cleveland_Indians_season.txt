The 1954 Cleveland Indians advanced to the World Series for the first time 
in six years. It was the team's third American League championship in franchise 
history. The Indians' 111-43 record is the all-time record for winning 
percentage by an American League team (.721.) For more than 60 years, the 
Tribe had been the only team in Major League Baseball to have compiled 
two different 11-game winning streaks within the same season, until the 
Toronto Blue Jays were able to accomplish the rare feat during the 2015 
regular season.[1] However, their great regular-season record would not 
be enough to win the World Series, as the Indians lost in four games to 
the New York Giants, after which the Indians would not return to the Fall 
Classic until 1995. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters

in a World Series. The only highlight for the Indians was that they kept 
the Yankees from winning their sixth straight series. The last time the 
Yankees had not won the series or pennant beforehand was 1948, when, again, 
the Indians kept them out (although that year, they won the Series). It 
was also the only World Series from 1949 to 1958 which did not feature 
the Yankees. September 29, 1954 at the Polo Grounds in New York September
