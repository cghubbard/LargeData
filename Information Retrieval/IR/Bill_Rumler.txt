William George "Bill" Rumler (March 27, 1891 – May 26, 1966), known as 
James Rumler during the 1918 season, and Red Moore during the 1921 season, 
was a professional baseball player, whose career spanned 19 seasons, three 
of which were spent in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the St. Louis Browns 
(1914, 1916–17). He played catcher, and outfielder. Over his major league 
career, Rumler compiled a combined batting average of .251 with 15 runs 
scored, 43 hits, seven doubles, four triples, one home run, and 32 runs 
batted in (RBIs) in 139 games played. After making his MLB debut in 1914, 
he spent the next season in the minor leagues. He returned to the majors 
in 1916, and again for a final time in 1917. After his MLB career was over, 
Rumler joined the minor league Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast 
League (PCL). In 1920, during his second season with the team, Rumler was 
given a five-year suspension from the PCL after being accused of throwing 
games for gamblers. He played with several outlaw leagues after he was 
suspended. He returned to the PCL in 1929 as a member of the Hollywood 
Stars. In 1932, he was hired as a player-manager for the Lincoln Links. 
He has a combined career minor league batting average of .342 with 1,037 
hits in 826 games played. Rumler batted and threw right-handed. During 
his career, he stood at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm), and weighed 190 pounds 
(86 kg). Rumler was born on March 27, 1891 in Milford, Nebraska to Charles, 
and Sophia Rumler of Germany, and Russia, respectively.[1] Bill Rumler 
had two brothers and a sister. Their father worked as a farmer.[1] At the 
age of 17, Bill Rumler was working on his father's farm.[1] In 1913, Rumler 
began his professional baseball debut after signing with the minor league 
Great Bend Millers of the Class-D Kansas State League. With Great Bend, 
he batted .314 with 76 hits in 61 games played. Late in the season, Rumler 
was sold to the Burlington Pathfinders of the Class-D Central Association.[2] 
For the Pathfinders, Rumler batted .350 with 49 hits in 37 games played. 
After the season, he was drafted by the Major League Baseball (MLB) St. 
Louis Browns in the 1913 rule 5 draft.[2][3] He joined the Browns for spring 
training in 1914.[4] Rumler made his MLB debut on May 4, 1914, against 
the Chicago White Sox.[5] On June 22, in a game against the Philadelphia 
Athletics, Rumler collided with the fence at Sportsman's Park, and was 
knocked unconscious.[6] In his first season in the majors, Rumler batted 
.174 with two runs scored, eight hits, one double, six runs batted in (RBIs), 
and two stolen bases in 34 games played. Defensively, he played 10 games 
at catcher, and six games in the outfield. On June 30, 1914, the St. Louis 
Browns sold Rumler to the Montgomery Rebels of the Class-A Southern Association.[7] 
However, he never made an appearance with the Rebels.[8] In December 1914, 
Rumler was signed by the Atlanta Crackers of the Class-A Southern Association.[9] 
At the start of the 1915 season, Crackers manager William Smith stated 
that he was going to use Rumler primarily as an outfielder.[10] On the 
season, he batted .253 with 93 hits, 12 doubles, nine triples, and six 
home runs in 122 games played. His home run total tied him for fourth in 
the Southern Association with Tim Hendryx, and Red McDermott.[11] Rumler 
started the 1916 season with the Little Rock Travelers of the Class-A Southern 
Association. He batted .337 with 84 hits, 10 doubles, five triples, and 
eight home runs in 75 games played. Rumler led the league in slugging percentage 
(.514); and was second in home runs, and batting average.[12] In late-July 
1916, Rumler was sold by the minor league Little Rock Travelers to the 
St. Louis Browns.[13] On the season with the Browns, he batted .324 with 
six runs scored, 12 hits, three doubles, and 10 RBIs in 27 games played. 
That season, Rumler set a career high in MLB batting average. He played 
all of his nine defensive games at the catcher position. After the season, 
Rumler participated in a charity game with semi-professional baseball players 
in Lincoln, Nebraska.[14] In 1917, Rumler re-joined the St. Louis Browns. 
It was his first, and only full MLB season. On April 20, Rumler drove in 
the winnings runs in the top of the ninth inning during a game against 
the Cleveland Indians.[15] Through July 3, Rumler had the third-highest 
batting average in the American League, behind Earl Hamilton, and Babe 
Ruth.[16] In July, Rumler stated that he was considering joining the United 
States military so he could fight in World War I.[17] He hit his first, 
and only MLB home run on September 21, against New York Yankees pitcher 
George Mogridge.[18] His final game came on September 27. With St. Louis 
that year, he batted .261 with seven runs scored, 23 hits, three doubles, 
four triples, one home run, 16 RBIs, and two stolen bases in 78 games played. 
During the season, Rumler registered 71 pinch-hit at-bats, which was an 
MLB record at the time.[19] In 1918, Rumler was sold by the St. Louis Browns 
to the minor league Columbus Senators of the Double-A American Association.[20] 
That year, he was known as "James" Rumler.[21] He played just seven games 
with Columbus, who was managed by Joe Tinker.[22] In those games, he batted 
.125 with two hits in 16 at-bats.[21] On May 23, Rumler was drafted into 
the United States military to fight in World War I.[20][23] After World 
War I, Rumler signed with the minor league Salt Lake City Bees of the Double-A 
Pacific Coast League (PCL).[24] During spring training that season, the 
Oakland Tribune wrote that Rumler was "one of the hardest hitters in the 
Bees camp", and that "if he keeps up the clip throughout the season he 
will be right up among the leading batters [in the PCL]".[24] He won a 
starting job with the Salt Lake club out of spring training.[25] On the 
season, he batted .362 with 214 hits, 42 doubles, 17 triples, and 17 home 
runs in 140 games played. He led the league in batting average, doubles; 
was second in home runs; and third in triples.[26][27] In January 1920, 
the St. Louis Browns, Rumler's former team, attempted to make a deal with 
the Salt Lake City Bees for him.[28] However, the Browns did not offer 
the players that Salt Lake wanted, and the deal fell apart.[28] Rumler 
injured his leg during spring training in 1920.[29] On April 7, Rumler 
hit the first home run in the PCL by any batter in the 1920 season.[30] 
On July 24, in a game against the Seattle Rainiers, he hit two home runs 
in the same game.[31] In August 1920, Babe Borton, a first baseman for 
the Vernon Tigers, came forward and claimed the Vernon club paid players 
from the Salt Lake City Bees to throw the 1919 PCL pennant series.[32] 
According to Borton, Vernon manager Bill Essick had asked him if he could 
get any Salt Lake players to throw the pennant game.[32] Borton stated 
that he got four players from the Salt Lake club, Rumler being one of them, 
to agree to throw games so that Vernon could win the PCL pennant.[32] Broton 
claimed that he paid Rumler US$200.[32] Rumler admitted to taking Borton's 
money, but claimed it was not a bribe, but a friendly bet on which team 
would win the series.[33] On August 13, executives from the Salt Lake club 
cleared Rumler of any wrongdoing.[34] On August 17, Rumler was suspended 
indefinably by PCL executives.[35] It was later announced that the suspension 
meant Rumler would be prohibited from playing in organized baseball for 
five years.[36] Rumler batted .348 with 185 hits, 37 doubles, 12 triples, 
and 23 home runs in 128 games played before his suspension. In September 
1920, it was announced that PCL team presidents would meet and decide if 
Rumler should be re-instated.[37] The president of the Pacific Coast League 
at the time, William H. McCarthy, stated that if Rumler, who he believed 
was guilty of throwing the pennant games, was allowed to continue to play 
in the PCL, he would resign his post as league president.[37] Rumler threatened 
to take legal action against the PCL.[38] Every team president voted against 
the reinstatement of Rumler, upholding league president McCarthy's five-year 
ban.[39] Rumler was brought before a Los Angeles County grand jury in November 
1920 on criminal conspiracy charges.[40] The grand jury handed down an 
indictment on Rumler.[41] He was eventually cleared on all charges.[42] 
In January 1921, the National Association of Minor Leagues adopted a resolution 
banning Rumler, Maggert, Borton, and Gene Dale from organized minor league 
baseball, backing up the PCL's decision.[43][44] In 1921, Rumler went under 
the name Red Moore, and played with the Minot Minoters, who represented 
Minot, North Dakota.[45] Minot was an outlaw baseball team.[45] On July 
15, Rumler was appointed manager of the Minot club.[45] The Bismarck Tribune 
called Rumler Minot's "big home run hitter and catcher".[46] At the end 
of the season, it was rumored that Rumler was going to be able to return 
to the PCL Salt Lake City Bees.[47] However, in 1922, Rumler joined the 
outlaw Hibbing, Minnesota Minnesota Steel League team.[48] He joined the 
Canton Terminals, who represented Canton, Ohio in 1923.[49] He re-signed 
with the Canton club in 1924.[50] In 1925, Rumler signed with the Kenosha 
Twin Sixies, who represented Kenosha, Wisconsin.[51] He primarily played 
center field for the Twins Sixies that year.[52] On the season, he hit 
eight home runs.[53] In January 1926, Rumler announced that he wanted to 
re-sign with the Kenosha club.[54] He eventually made it official when 
he re-signed with the Twin Sixies, and returned to his spot in center field.[55] 
In 1927, Rumler again played for the Twin Sixies.[56] In April 1928, Rumler 
was hired to manage to the Milford, Nebraska team.[57] On December 4, 1928, 
Rumler's suspension from organized baseball was lifted, and he signed with 
the Hollywood Stars of the PCL.[42] He attended spring training with the 
Stars that season.[58] He made the club at the start of the regular season.[59] 
In late-May, he suffered an injury to his shoulder, which healed by mid-June.[60] 
During the fourth game of the 1929 PCL pennant series against the Mission 
Reds, Rumler was struck in the head by a pitch, and knocked unconscious.[61] 
He regained consciousness that night in the hospital.[61] Rumler was released 
from the hospital in time for the deciding fifth game, which the Stars 
won due to an eight inning come-back led by Rumler.[62] On the season, 
he batted .386 with 194 hits, 39 doubles, three triples, and 26 home runs 
in 140 games played. He was third in the PCL in batting average.[63] Rumler 
re-signed with the Hollywood Stars in 1930.[64] In April, while on a train 
going to Oakland, California, Rumler had a nightmare, which caused him 
to kick his foot through the Pullman's window.[65] After the incident, 
he had to sit out for a week while the lacerations on his foot and leg.[65] 
On June 18, during a game against the Mission Reds, Rumler hit a game-winning 
home run.[66] He suffered another injury in September.[67] With the Stars 
that year, Rumler batted .353 with 122 hits, 23 doubles, three triples, 
and 14 home runs. On May 6, 1931, Rumler signed with the Denver Bears of 
the Class-A Western League.[68] With the Bears, he batted .237 with 14 
hits, one double, and one triple in 16 games played. In August, he signed 
with the Canadian-American Clowns, a travel team.[69] As a member of the 
Clowns, he played a game against the House of David, a Negro league baseball 
team who represented Ogden, Utah.[70] His last season in professional baseball 
would come in 1932, as the player-manager for the Lincoln Links of the 
Class-D Nebraska State League. With Lincoln, he batted .340 with 16 hits, 
five doubles, and one triple in 17 games played. He was succeeded as manager 
of the club by Bob Sanguinet.[71] In 1930, Rumler lived with his parents 
on their farm in Milford, Nebraska.[72] His last residence was in Milford.[73] 
Rumler died on May 26, 1966 in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was buried at Blue
