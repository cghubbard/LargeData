Chad Michael Qualls (born August 17, 1978) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played in MLB for the Houston Astros, Arizona Diamondbacks, 
Tampa Bay Rays, San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, and Miami Marlins. Qualls attended Narbonne High School 
in Harbor City, California, Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC) in Wilmington, 
California, and the University of Nevada-Reno in Reno, Nevada. After pitching 
for LAHC, he was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 52nd round of 
the 1997 MLB Draft, but he did not sign. He transferred to the University 
of Nevada, where he played college baseball for the Nevada Wolf Pack's 
baseball team, competing in the Big West Conference of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Association's Division I. He was named to the Big West Conference's 
second team in 1999.[1] In 2000, Qualls anchored the Wolf Pack's starting 
rotation with Darrell Rasner and Matt Rainer.[2] Qualls pitched seven complete 
games for the Wolf Pack.[3] Qualls was drafted in the second round of the 
2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Houston Astros.[4] He began his 
career as a starting pitcher with the Michigan Battle Cats of the Class 
A Midwest League during the 2001 season. In 2002 and 2003, he pitched for 
the Round Rock Express, which competed in the Class AA Texas League.[5] 
He was converted to relief during the 2004 season while with the New Orleans 
Zephyrs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. Qualls made his major league 
debut with Astros on July 22, 2004. He pitched the next three seasons for 
the Astros. He recorded six saves and a 3.39 earned run average (ERA). 
Qualls joined with Dan Wheeler and Brad Lidge to form a strong bullpen, 
as the Astros reached the 2005 World Series.[4] Qualls served a three-game 
suspension for throwing a baseball into the stands.[6] On December 14, 
2007, the Astros traded Qualls to the Arizona Diamondbacks, along with 
Chris Burke and Juan Gutiérrez, for José Valverde. Qualls replaced Brandon 
Lyon as the closer for the Diamondbacks in mid-September 2008 after Lyon 
struggled in the second half of the season. He became one of four pitchers 
who pitched in at least 70 games every season from 2004 through 2008.[7] 
Qualls signed a $2.54 million contract with the Diamondbacks for the 2009 
season.[8] He became their closer at the start of the 2009 season. For 
the year, he recorded a 2–2 win–loss record, a 3.63 ERA, and 24 saves in 
29 opportunities.[9] On August 30, 2009, he suffered a patellar dislocation 
on the final play of a winning effort against the Astros. He required surgery 
and missed the rest of the season.[9] Qualls signed a one-year contract 
with the Diamondbacks for the 2010 season worth $4.185 million.[9] However, 
he struggled with the Diamondbacks that season, pitching to an 8.29 ERA 
with 12 saves.[10] On July 31, 2010, Qualls was traded to the Tampa Bay 
Rays for a player to be named later.[10] He pitched in 27 games for them 
with a 5.57 ERA. Qualls signed with the Padres for the 2011 season and 
a $6 million team option for 2012.[11] He finished the 2011 season with 
a 6–8 record and 3.51 ERA in a team-high 77 appearances.[12] Qualls signed 
a $1.15 million, one-year contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on January 
31, 2012.[12] On April 4, he was named to the opening day roster.[13] He 
began the year as the primary set up reliever to closer Jonathan Papelbon.[14] 
With the Phillies, Qualls pitched to a 4.60 ERA in 35 games.[15] On July 
1, 2012, Qualls was traded to the New York Yankees from the Phillies for 
a player to be named or cash.[16] He replaced the struggling Cory Wade 
in the bullpen, as Wade was demoted to the minor leagues.[15] On July 31, 
2012, Qualls was traded from the Yankees to the Pittsburgh Pirates for 
Casey McGehee.[17] On Friday, January 25, 2013, Chad Qualls reportedly 
agreed to a minor league deal with the Miami Marlins.[18] Following a game 
on Tuesday, July 30, 2013 between the Marlins and Mets, Qualls became an 
overnight social media viral sensation. Qualls punctuated his scoreless 
7th inning stint in which he walked one, allowed one hit, and struck out 
two, with an attempted fist pump as he ran towards the dugout. Leaving 
the mound after strike-three against the Mets' Omar Quintanilla, Qualls 
punched the air in celebration as he headed toward the dugout. As he threw 
the punch, he snagged his right cleat in the grass and his own forward 
momentum sent him tumbling to the ground. Qualls was uninjured and bounced 
up quickly and continued to the dugout, where he covered his face in a 
towel and laughed with teammates."As soon as I saw the fist pump I put 
my head down," Marlins manager Mike Redmond said. "That's one of those 
if you win that game, you can watch it. But since we lost it's not quite 
as funny." The video quickly made the rounds via Twitter and other social 
media and made the front page of web sites including CBS Sports, Deadspin, 
SI, and The Big Lead.[19] On December 7, 2013, Qualls signed a two-year 
contract, with an option for 2016, to return to the Houston Astros.[20] 
On November 3, 2015, the Astros declined their 2016 option on Qualls, making 
him a free agent.[21] On December 8, 2015, Qualls signed a 2-year, $6 million 
contract with the Colorado Rockies.[22] Qualls throws two main pitches: 
a heavy sinker in the low-to-mid 90s, and a hard slider in the mid-to-upper 
80s. He typically uses the sinker to get ahead in the count and the slider 
to get strikeouts. He also occasionally uses a changeup against left-handed
