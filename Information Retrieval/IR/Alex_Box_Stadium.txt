Alex Box Stadium, sometimes pronounced as "Elec" or "Alec" Box[1] was a 
baseball stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. It was the home 
field of the LSU Tigers baseball team. The stadium was located across the 
street from Tiger Stadium, which is visible in right field. It was most 
notable for The Intimidator, a large billboard behind the right-field fence 
featuring the five years in which LSU won the College World Series. The 
stadium opened in 1938 and closed in 2008. It was replaced with a new stadium 
200 yards to the south named Alex Box Stadium/Skip Bertman Field. Both 
structures were named for Simeon Alex Box, an LSU letterman (1942) who 
was killed in North Africa during World War II. The stadium was called 
LSU Diamond or LSU Varsity Baseball Field when it first opened. The New 
York Giants held spring training at the ballpark in 1938 and 1939. The 
Giants played the first baseball game at the park, defeating the Philadelphia 
Phillies 6-5. The first LSU game was March 21, 1938. LSU led Minnesota, 
4-2, after three innings when the game was halted due to rain. The first 
official LSU Game at the stadium was March 24, 1938 when Minnesota defeated 
LSU, 6-5.[2] The final regular season series at Alex Box Stadium was played 
between LSU and Mississippi State University.[3] At the time, it appeared 
this would be the last series ever at Alex Box Stadium; however, LSU was 
selected to host a regional in the NCAA Tournament (which it won), and 
subsequently hosted a Super Regional as the #7 national seed.[4] It appeared 
that Alex Box stadium would close on a sour note for the Tigers, as LSU 
dropped Game 1 to UC Irvine 11-5, and in Game 2, LSU was three outs away 
from elimination, trailing 7-4 in the ninth inning. However, UC Irvine 
was unable to close out the LSU Tigers and LSU came from behind to win 
the game 9-7.[5] The stadium was thus given one final chance to close on 
a high note, which it did in Game 3 of the Super Regional played on June 
9, 2008, as LSU defeated UC Irvine 21-7. As a result of the victory, LSU 
won the Baton Rouge Super Regional two games to one and advanced to the 
College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. In the final play at the stadium, 
Tyler Hoechlin hit a grounder to pitcher Anthony Ranaudo, who threw to 
first baseman Buzzy Haydel for the final out.[6] The stadium has been dismantled 
and sold to fans. NCAA Regional Tournaments (18): 1986, 1990, 1991, 1992,
