Markus Lynn "Mookie" Betts (born October 7, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball right fielder for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Betts is listed at 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 m) and 180 pounds (82 kg), 
and bats and throws right handed.[1] Betts was drafted by the Red Sox in 
2011, and made his MLB debut in the 2014 season,[2] sharing time between 
second base and the outfield. He became the Red Sox starting center fielder 
in 2015, before moving to right field in 2016.[3] As a relatively short 
natural second baseman with a high contact rate and a high level of production 
when pulling the ball, Betts has been compared to fellow Red Sox player 
Dustin Pedroia.[4][5] Betts attended John Overton High School in Nashville, 
Tennessee, playing second base, shortstop and outfield.[6] In 2011, his 
senior year, he batted .509 with 30 steals[7] and was an honorable mention 
inclusion for the Louisville Slugger High School All-American list.[8] 
In 2010, his junior year at Overton, Betts batted .549 with 24 steals. 
In November that year, Betts signed a letter of commitment to attend the 
University of Tennessee on a baseball scholarship, also getting recruited 
by Vanderbilt University, Mississippi State University and the University 
of Alabama at Birmingham.[9] At Overton, Betts was also a standout basketball 
player, named MVP of the District 12-AAA league his senior season while 
averaging 14.1 points, 9 assists, 4 rebounds and 3 steals per game;[10] 
and also named Class AAA All-City Player of the Year for the Nashville, 
Tennessee metropolitan area.[11] His junior year, Betts was named MVP of 
the District 12-AAA tournament.[12] Betts also excelled in bowling, named 
the Tennessee boys Bowler of the Year in 2010 with a high score of 290.[13] 
The Boston Red Sox selected Betts in the fifth round of the 2011 Major 
League Baseball Draft with the 172nd overall pick.[14] After protracted 
negotiations,[15] Betts subsequently rescinded his commitment to the University 
of Tennessee, signing a $750,000 contract with the Red Sox organization[16] 
Betts played one game in 2011 for the GCL Red Sox of the rookie Gulf Coast 
League, getting two hits in four at bats.[17] In 2012, he batted .267 and 
stole 20 bases in 71 games for the short season Lowell Spinners of the 
New York–Penn League. He played shortstop regularly, but looked more comfortable 
at second base[1] Betts started the 2013 season with the Greenville Drive 
of the Low A South Atlantic League. In 76 games, Betts batted .296[1] with 
a 19-game hitting streak[18] and was selected to the South Atlantic League 
All-Star Game.[19] On July 9, Betts was promoted to the Salem Red Sox of 
the High A Carolina League,[20] batting .341 in 51 games to complete the 
2013 season with a combined .314 average in 127 games between Greenville 
and Salem with 15 home runs and 38 steals.[1] Betts was named Offensive 
Player of the Year and Breakout Player of the Year in the Boston minor 
league system,[21] leading all Sox minors players with a .506 slugging 
percentage, while his .314 batting average ranked him third behind Alex 
Hassan (.338) and Garin Cecchini (.322).[22] Betts was a second-team inclusion 
on the Baseball America Minor League All-Star Team for 2013, with the first-team 
selection for second base going to Marcus Semien, an infielder in the Chicago 
White Sox system.[23] Betts subsequently played 16 games for the Surprise 
Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League, batting .271.[17] Betts opened the 
2014 season with the Portland Sea Dogs of the Double-A Eastern League,[1] 
batting .355 in 54 games to lead the Eastern League through June 2. On 
June 3, Betts was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Triple-A International 
League,[24] batting .322 and reaching base in all 23 games with the PawSox.[25] 
In 2013 and 2014, Betts reached base in 66 straight regular-season games 
plus five playoff games for a combined streak of 71 games. Because official 
baseball streak records do not include playoff games, Betts' streak has 
been listed at 66 games; Kevin Millar and Kevin Youkilis hold the official 
minor league record for consecutive games reaching base, at 71 games, with 
Minor League Baseball lacking data on the statistic prior to 1997.[26] 
Since mid-May 2014, Betts has played outfield in addition to second base.[27] 
In 2013, four-time All-Star second baseman Dustin Pedroia signed an eight-year, 
$110 million contract extension with the Red Sox, leading to speculation 
that the Red Sox would groom Betts for a new position.[28][29] Betts was 
promoted to the Red Sox on June 28, 2014.[30][31] He had previously been 
selected for the All-Star Futures Game, but was replaced following his 
promotion to the Major Leagues.[32] Betts made his debut on June 29, recording 
his first major league career hit against Yankees starter Chase Whitley 
in the fourth inning.[33] He hit his first home run on July 2 off the Cubs' 
Carlos Villanueva.[34] He then was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket on July 
19 when Shane Victorino was activated from the disabled list,[35] and was 
recalled to Boston on August 1. Betts was optioned back to Pawtucket in 
August, and recalled again on August 18.[36] On August 29, Betts hit his 
first career grand slam against Rays pitcher Chris Archer in a Red Sox 
victory at Tropicana Field.[37] At age 21, Betts became the youngest Sox 
player to hit a grand slam in 49 years[38][39] Betts spent most of the 
2014 season playing in the outfield, but on September 11 manager John Farrell 
announced that Betts would play second base "fairly regularly" following 
injuries to regular second basemen Dustin Pedroia and Brock Holt.[40] Betts 
split the 2014 season fairly evenly between AA, AAA and MLB, playing 52 
major league games.[41] He performed well for the Red Sox, hitting .291 
with five home runs; and played over half his innings in center field.[42] 
On April 6, 2015, Opening Day for the Boston Red Sox vs. the Philadelphia 
Phillies, he hit a home run in his second at bat, becoming the third youngest 
player to hit a home run on Opening Day for the Red Sox.[43] On April 13, 
2015, in the home opener at Fenway Park against the Washington Nationals, 
Betts arguably had the most exciting performance of his career. He robbed 
Bryce Harper of a home run, stole two bases on one play and hit a home 
run into the Monster seats, all in the first three innings.[44] Betts was 
named the AL Player of the Week for the week ending on June 21, 2015. Within 
that week, Betts batted .581 (18 for 31) with two home runs, two triples, 
three doubles, seven RBI and eight runs. He led the AL in batting average, 
hits, on-base percentage (.594), total bases (31), and slugging percentage 
(1.000) that week.[45] In the latter part of the season, he spent some 
time in right field, leading to speculation that he would move there permanently 
to allow teammate Jackie Bradley, Jr., to take over in center field.[46] 
Betts ended the 2015 season with a .291 batting average, with 92 runs scored, 
77 RBIs, 18 home runs, and 21 stolen bases.[47] Betts was selected as an 
All-Star for the first time in his career. He was selected by the fans 
to start in the outfield for the American League.[48] Betts was 1 for 2 
with a single in his All-Star Game debut.[49] Betts was named the AL Player 
of the Month for July 2016. During July, Betts batted .368 (35 for 95) 
with five home runs, 15 RBIs, five stolen bases, and a 1.068 OPS in 23 
games.[50] On Tuesday, September 20, 2016, Betts became the first player 
to reach 200 hits during the 2016 Major League Baseball season.[51] In 
158 games of 2016, Betts finished the season with a .318 batting average, 
214 hits, 122 runs scored, 42 doubles, 31 home runs, 113 RBI, and an MLB-leading 
359 total bases. With the Red Sox finishing the season 93-69, the team 
clinched the AL East Division, but succumbed to a 3-game sweep by the Cleveland 
Indians in the 2016 ALDS. Wilson Sporting Goods named Betts their Defensive 
Player of the Year at right field and overall among all major league fielders.[52] 
Betts is an avid bowler; he bowled throughout his youth and competed in 
the PBA World Series of Bowling in Reno, Nevada, in 2015.[53] He has bowled 
two perfect games on January 27, 2013 and February 2, 2016.[54] Betts is 
a nephew of Terry Shumpert,[55] who played parts of 14 seasons with several 
MLB teams.[56] In 2004, Shumpert spent his final season of professional 
baseball with the Triple A Nashville Sounds and worked extensively with 
Betts.[57] Betts' first Little League coach was his mother Diana, who is 
also an avid bowler and taught Mookie to bowl at an early age.[15] Betts 
was named the Tennessee boys Bowler of the Year in 2010, having set Tennessee 
high school records that season with a 290-game and an 827 three-game series.[58] 
He has rolled two sanctioned 300 games and has averaged over 200 in league 
competition. In the 2015 offseason, Betts entered the Professional Bowlers 
Association's GEICO World Series of Bowling VII, being held in Reno, Nevada.[59] 
Betts' parents chose his name in part to form the initials MLB, matching 
those of Major League Baseball.[15] He has attributed his nickname Mookie 
to his parents watching former NBA guard Mookie Blaylock play basketball 
shortly after Betts was born. Betts has stated he has never met Blaylock.[60]
