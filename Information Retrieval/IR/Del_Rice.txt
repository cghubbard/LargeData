As player As manager Delbert Rice Jr. (27 October 1922 â€“ 26 January 1983) 
was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager.[1] He 
played for 17 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1945 to 
1961, most notably for the St. Louis Cardinals. Although Rice was a relatively 
weak hitter, he sustained a lengthy career in the major leagues due to 
his valuable defensive abilities.[2] A native of Portsmouth, Ohio, Rice 
attended Portsmouth High School where he starred in football, basketball 
and track as well as baseball.[2] He was contracted as an amateur free 
agent by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1941.[1] Although Rice received his 
induction notice into the military in 1943, he was turned down because 
of a physical disqualification.[2] After playing in the minor leagues for 
four seasons, he made his major league debut with the Cardinals on 2 May, 
1945 at the age of 22.[1] Shortly after the season began, the Cardinals 
sold their star catcher, Walker Cooper to the New York Giants, leaving 
Rice to share catching duties with Ken O'Dea.[2] Although they competed 
for the same job, the veteran O'Dea, who had played with Hall of Fame catcher 
Gabby Hartnett in Chicago during the 1930s, provided Rice with valuable 
help in learning the intricacies of catching in the major leagues.[2] Rice 
posted a .261 batting average in 83 games as the Cardinals finished in 
second place, three games behind the Chicago Cubs.[1][3] Although he served 
as a backup catcher to Joe Garagiola in 1946, he regularly played whenever 
Harry Brecheen pitched.[2] The Cardinals ended the season tied for first 
place with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the two teams met in the 1946 National 
League tie-breaker series.[4] It was the first playoff tiebreaker in Major 
League Baseball history.[5] The Cardinals won the first two games of the 
best-of-three game series to capture the National League pennant.[4] In 
the 1946 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Rice caught all three 
of Brecheen's victories, as the Cardinals defeated the Red Sox in seven 
games.[2][6] He was also the hitting standout in Game 2, with a single, 
a double and a walk, scoring two runs in the Cardinals' 3-0 victory.[7] 
In 1947, Rice caught the majority of the team's games and guided the Cardinals' 
pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average and the most strikeouts 
in the National League, as the Cardinals finished in second place to the 
Dodgers.[1][8] His pitch-calling skills were made evident once again in 
1949, leading the Cardinals' pitching staff to the lowest team earned run 
average in the league, as the Cardinals once again finished in second place, 
one game behind the Dodgers.[9] Rice had his best season in 1952, posting 
a .259 batting average along with 11 home runs and a career-high 65 runs 
batted in.[1] He also led National League catchers in games played, putouts, 
assists and in baserunners caught stealing.[1] The following season, Rice 
was named as a reserve player for the National League team in the 1953 
All-Star Game, although an injury kept him from participating in the game.[10][11] 
Rice was injured during a game against the Dodgers on 7 June, 1954 when 
Roy Campanella stole home and spiked Rice's leg.[12] While he was sidelined 
with the injury, his replacement, Bill Sarni hit for a .300 average for 
the remainder of the season.[13] In the middle of the 1955 season, the 
32-year-old Rice was traded to the Milwaukee Braves, who were in need of 
a backup catcher for their perennial All-Star, Del Crandall.[14] He became 
pitcher Bob Buhl's personal catcher, as Buhl didn't like having Crandall 
calling his pitches.[15] In 1956, Rice helped Buhl to an 18-8 record as 
the Braves held first place with two games left in the season before the 
team faltered and finished the season one game behind the Dodgers.[16][17] 
In the 1957 season, Buhl again won 18 games and posted a 2.74 earned run 
average with Rice as his catcher, as the Braves won the National League 
pennant.[16][18] Rice became a member of his second world championship 
winning team when the Braves defeated the New York Yankees in the 1957 
World Series.[19] The Braves won the National League pennant for a second 
consecutive year in 1958, but lost a rematch with the Yankees in the 1958 
World Series.[20] In June 1959, Rice suffered a broken leg in a collision 
at home plate with Willie Mays.[21] He missed more than two months of the 
season and was used sparingly upon his return.[22] He played in only a 
handful of games before he was given a coaching position in late August 
to make room on the roster for another player.[23] The Braves then released 
him at the end of the season.[23] Rice played for the Chicago Cubs in 1960, 
but was released in June when the Cubs acquired catcher Jim Hegan.[24][25] 
One of the 18 games Rice caught as a Cub was Don Cardwell's no-hitter on 
15 May.[26] He was then re-signed with the Cardinals, but only appeared 
in one game before being selected off waivers by the Baltimore Orioles 
in September.[1] After appearing in only one game for the Orioles, he was 
released in October.[27] Rice became the first player ever to sign with 
the Los Angeles Angels expansion team.[28] He played in 30 games during 
their inaugural 1961 campaign and was released as a player at the end of 
the season, but was retained within the organization.[29] He played in 
his final major league game on 31 August 1961 at the age of 39.[1] In a 
seventeen-year major league career, Rice played in 1,309 games, accumulating 
908 hits in 3,826 at bats for a .237 career batting average along with 
79 home runs, 441 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .312.[1] 
He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage.[1] Rice was known 
for his strong defensive skills, leading National League catchers in fielding 
percentage in 1948 and 1949, and tying for the lead in double plays in 
1949, 1950 and 1951.[2][30] Rice also had a career in the National Basketball 
League, playing four seasons for the Rochester Royals from 1946 until 1950, 
when Fred Saigh, the Cardinals owner, asked him to concentrate on baseball.[2][31] 
Rice was a longtime member of the Angels' organization. After retiring 
as a player, he was retained as their first base coach from 1962 to 1966. 
He spent the 1967 season as a coach for the Cleveland Indians, but then 
returned to the Angels as a minor league manager and had success at the 
AAA level. He was named Minor League Manager of the Year for 1971 by The 
Sporting News after leading the Salt Lake City Bees to a divisional title 
in the Pacific Coast League.[32][33] Rice was rewarded with a promotion 
to manager of the 1972 Angels, but after one season and a 75-80 (.484) 
fifth-place finish, he was replaced by Bobby Winkles.[34][35] He remained 
with the club, however, as a scout. Rice died of complications from cancer 
while attending a benefit dinner in his honor of in Garden Grove, California,
