Claude William Passeau (April 9, 1909 – August 30, 2003) was an American 
starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1935 through 1947, Passeau 
played with the Pittsburgh Pirates (1935), Philadelphia Phillies (1936–39) 
and Chicago Cubs (1939–47). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 13-year 
career, Passeau posted a 162–150 record with 1104 strikeouts and a 3.32 
ERA in 2179.2 innings. Passeau was a native of Waynesboro, Mississippi. 
He was a graduate of Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi. Passeau 
was considered the finest college quarterback in Mississippi, but he chose 
to pursue an athletic career in professional baseball rather than football 
after graduation. Passeau started his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
then played for several years with the Philadelphia Phillies at their notorious 
"bandbox" ballpark, Baker Bowl, before being traded to the Chicago Cubs, 
where he had several winning seasons. Passeau surrendered the game-winning 
home run to Ted Williams in the 1941 All-Star Game. Passeau's greatest 
individual performance came in Game 3 of the 1945 World Series, in which 
he pitched a one-hitter against the Detroit Tigers. Slugger Rudy York got 
the Tigers' only hit, in the second inning, and the Cubs took a 2-games-to-1 
edge. Due to wartime travel restrictions that were still in place, despite 
the war having ended, the first three games were in Detroit and the last 
four in Chicago. Back in Wrigley Field, the Cubs lost 3 of 4, their last 
appearance in the Series, as of 2013. Passeau was the starting pitcher 
for the Cubs in Game 6, but had to be removed from the game during the 
sixth inning after he injured his pitching hand while fielding a hard smash. 
Passeau had a comfortable lead in the game, but the Chicago bullpen could 
not check the Tigers. The game went into extra innings and the Cubs emptied 
their bench. Hank Borowy, who was scheduled to pitch Game 7, was pressed 
into service and pitched four innings as Chicago won the game in twelve 
innings. Passeau's injury proved to be costly as the Cubs were without 
a well rested pitcher to face Hal Newhouser the final game. That one-hit 
game was only the second low-hit game in the history of the Series; the 
first was pitched by the Cubs' Ed Reulbach in 1906. There have only been 
four low-hit Series games since, including Don Larsen's perfect game in 
the 1956 World Series, and Roy Halladay's one walk no hitter in the 2010 
NLDS, which are the only two no-hitters in MLB postseason history.[citation
