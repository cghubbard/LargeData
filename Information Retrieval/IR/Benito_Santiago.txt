Benito Santiago Rivera (born March 9, 1965) is a Puerto Rican former professional 
baseball player.[1] He played for twenty seasons as a catcher in Major 
League Baseball for ten different teams, although his greatest success 
came with his first team, the San Diego Padres.[1] In the late 1980s and 
early 1990s, Santiago was considered the premier catcher in the National 
League.[2] Santiago was signed as an amateur free agent by the San Diego 
Padres on September 1, 1982.[1] After playing four seasons in the minor 
leagues, he made his Major League debut with the Padres on September 14, 
1986 at the age of 21.[1] The next year, Santiago established a Major League 
record for a rookie by hitting safely in 34 straight games.[3] It was also 
the longest hitting streak by a catcher in major league history.[4] He 
ended the season with what would be career-highs in hits (164), doubles 
(33) and batting average (.300).[1] Santiago was the unanimous selection 
for the 1987 National League Rookie of the Year Award.[5] Although he struggled 
defensively, leading the league in errors and passed balls, his hitting 
performance earned him the 1987 Silver Slugger Award which is awarded annually 
to the best offensive player at each position.[6][7] While Santiago initially 
made an impression with his offensive statistics, he soon became known 
for his defensive prowess, most notably for his strong throwing arm.[8] 
Santiago was known for his ability to throw out would be base stealers 
from a kneeling position.[8] In 1988, he led National League catchers in 
assists and in baserunners caught stealing with a 45% average when the 
league average was 30%.[8][9] Although he still led the league's catchers 
with 12 errors, it was an improvement over the 22 he had committed the 
previous season. Santiago was awarded the first of three consecutive Gold 
Glove Awards in 1988.[10] Santiago also claimed his second successive Silver 
Slugger Award as the Padres improved to finish in third place in the National 
League Western Division.[11][12] Although he was hitting for only a .236 
average at mid-season in 1989, his defensive reputation earned him the 
starting catcher's role in the 1989 All-Star Game.[13][14] He was awarded 
the 1989 National League Gold Glove Award for catchers, as the Padres climbed 
to second place in the season's final standings.[15][16] Santiago rebounded 
in 1990 and was hitting for a .317 batting average with 9 home runs in 
mid-June when he was hit by a pitch and had to miss six weeks of the season.[17] 
He finished the season with a .270 average along with 11 home runs and 
53 runs batted in to earn his third Silver Slugger Award.[1][18] He was 
also named as a reserve player for the National League team in the 1990 
All-Star Game and won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.[19][20] Before 
the 1991 season, Santiago asked for a four-year contract worth $11 million, 
but lost his arbitration case and was awarded a one-year contract worth 
$1.65 million.[21] A disgruntled Santiago announced that he would leave 
the Padres when he became eligible for free agency after the 1992 season.[21] 
He was also disillusioned when the Padres traded away players such as Joe 
Carter and Jack Clark.[22] In June, Padres manager, Greg Riddoch, benched 
Santiago for his lack of hustle on the playing field.[21] Despite the difficulties, 
Santiago led the league's catchers with 100 assists and posted a career-high 
87 runs batted in.[1] Santiago returned to arbitration before the 1992 
season, this time winning a $3.3 million one-year contract that made him 
the highest paid catcher in baseball.[23] In September 1992, the Padres 
announced that they would not seek to re-sign Santiago, in what was seen 
as a cost-cutting measure.[22][24] Santiago is also unusual for his uniform 
number; from 1991 to 1994, Santiago wore a jersey with the number 09, making 
him one of the only major professional sports players to have ever worn 
a jersey with a leading zero as part of his uniform number.[25] On December 
16, 1992, Santiago signed with the newly established franchise Florida 
Marlins and hit the first home run in team history. Despite hitting for 
a .273 average in 1994, he was granted free agency after the season as 
the Marlins were ready to promote their young catching prospect, Charles 
Johnson.[1] On April 17, 1995, the Cincinnati Reds signed him and he briefly 
recovered his form batting .286.[1] On January 30, 1996, he joined the 
Phillies, where he became the first player to hit a grand slam off Greg 
Maddux in the regular season after Maddux had been pitching for nearly 
ten years.[26] Santiago also hit a home run in four consecutive at bats 
in the same season. Santiago ended the season with a career-high 30 home 
runs, along with 85 runs batted in, for the last place Phillies.[1] Santiago 
then signed a contract to play for the Blue Jays (1997–1998) where he lost 
almost the entire 1998 season to a serious injury sustained in a car crash 
in Florida.[27] A free agent again, he played 89 games for the Cubs in 
1999 and played for Cincinnati in 2000.[1] Santiago arrived in San Francisco 
on March 17, 2001. He played in 133 games and helped the Giants finish 
in second place, two games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National 
League West.[1][28] He shared the 2001 Willie Mac Award with Mark Gardner, 
which recognized the spirit and leadership of each.[29] Santiago had another 
good year in 2002, appearing in 126 games and finishing third among National 
League catchers with a .995 fielding percentage.[1] He earned his fifth 
All-Star berth and ended the season with a .278 batting average with 74 
runs batted in as the Giants once again finished second to the Diamondbacks 
and claimed the National League wild card berth.[1][30] The Giants defeated 
the Atlanta Braves in the first round of the play-offs then met the St. 
Louis Cardinals in the 2002 National League Championship Series.[31] Santiago 
hit two home runs in the series along with 6 runs batted in, and was awarded 
the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award as the Giants 
defeated the Cardinals in five games.[32] In the 2002 World Series against 
the Anaheim Angels, Santiago delivered 5 runs batted in as the Giants were 
defeated in a seven-game series.[33][34] In 2003, the 38-year-old Santiago 
continued to perform well, hitting fifth in the batting order behind Barry 
Bonds, he appeared in 108 games while posting a .279 batting average with 
56 runs batted in.[1][35] On December 11, 2003, Santiago, again a free 
agent, signed with the Kansas City Royals. By June 18, he was hitting .274 
with six home runs and 23 RBI when he was hit by a pitch from Geoff Geary 
that broke his hand. After the 2004 season, the Royals traded him to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates for Leo Núñez, a minor league pitcher. The Pirates let 
Santiago go after a mere 23 at-bats in favor of giving playing time to 
young David Ross. Santiago signed with the New York Mets to a minor-league 
contract, but he appeared in only a handful of games. He opted out of his 
Triple-A contract, but did not play in the major leagues in 2006. He was 
inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame on August 8, 2015.[36] 
In a twenty-year major league career, Santiago played in 1,978 games, accumulating 
1,830 hits in 6,951 at bats for a .261 career batting average along with 
217 home runs, 920 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .307.[1] 
He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage.[1] A five-time All-Star, 
Santiago was known for his strong defensive skills, leading National League 
catchers three times in assists, once in fielding percentage and once in 
baserunners caught stealing.[1] As 2010 began, Santiago was tied for eighth 
on the all-time list of games caught with Brad Ausmus, with 1,917.[37] 
In 2003, Santiago was named by FBI investigators as one of the athletes 
alleged to have received anabolic steroids. He was linked to performance 
enhancers in the book Game of Shadows.[38] On December 13, 2007, Santiago 
was written about in the Mitchell Report on page 134. "At the end of the 
2003 season, Mike Murphy, a Giants clubhouse attendant, was cleaning out 
Santiago's locker when he found a sealed package of syringes. Murphy brought 
the syringes to the training room, handed them to Conte, and told Conte 
that he had found them in Santiago's locker. Conte responded that he "would 
take care of it." Murphy recalled that the Giants’ assistant athletic trainer 
Dave Groeschner also was present in the training room during this conversation."
