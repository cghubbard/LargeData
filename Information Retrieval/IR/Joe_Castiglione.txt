Joseph John Castiglione (born March 2, 1947)[1] is an American radio announcer 
for the Boston Red Sox baseball team,[2] an author[3] and lecturer.[2] 
Castiglione was born in Hamden, Connecticut and graduated from Colgate 
University with a BA in Liberal Arts.[2] He was the radio voice of Colgate 
football and baseball while a student.[3] He then received an MA from Syracuse 
University.[4] While at Syracuse, he worked a variety of on-air jobs for 
WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV). He began his career in Youngstown, Ohio broadcasting 
football games for $15 a game, and as sports reporter for WFMJ-TV in 1972.[5] 
His first major job as a sportscaster was in Cleveland in 1979, where he 
called Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Cavaliers games and did sports reporting 
for WKYC-TV.[6] He also called a handful of Milwaukee Brewers games for 
pay-cable channel SelecTV in 1981. Castiglione joined the Red Sox broadcast 
team in 1983,[3] teamed with Ken Coleman.[6] He admitted not being in the 
booth when the ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs in the 1986 World 
Series, as he was in the clubhouse covering Red Sox' seemingly impending 
victory celebration.[6] After Coleman's retirement in 1989, Bob Starr became 
the lead announcer for the Red Sox.[7] After Starr's departure at the end 
of the 1991 season, Castiglione became the team's lead radio announcer 
along with Jerry Trupiano.[8] Castiglione became nationally known when 
the team won the 2004 World Series, with his broadcast of the end of the 
game.[3] His jubilant "Can you believe it?" after the final out became 
a catchphrase. During the 2007 season he shared announcing duties with 
a rotating duo of Dave O'Brien[9] and Glenn Geffner.[10] With Glenn Geffner 
leaving for the Florida Marlins broadcast booth,[11] Castiglione shared 
the booth with Dave O'Brien, Dale Arnold or Jon Rish in 2008.[12] Dave 
O'Brien and Jon Rish were his partners since 2009 through April 2013.[13] 
In 2011, Dale Arnold returned to be the primary fill in on Wednesday games. 
Starting in May 2013, Rob Bradford, Lou Merloni and O'Brien were his partners 
after John Ryder replaced Rish, with Merloni and Bradford stepping in for 
fill-in play by play duties. In 2011, O'Brien became the lead announcer 
with Castiglione moving back to the secondary announcing role. Castiglione 
does play by play in innings 3-4 and 6-7. He does all innings when working 
with Bradford and Merloni. Castiglione claims to have been a New York Yankees 
fan as a kid.[6] He said in his autobiography that he then closely followed 
the Pittsburgh Pirates because they were the closest to Youngstown, and 
likewise became an Indians fan after moving to Cleveland.[14] Castiglione 
is currently a Lecturer in the department of Communication Studies at Northeastern 
University, where he teaches a course on Sports Broadcasting.[9] Current 
Red Sox play-by-play announcers Don Orsillo and Uri Berenguer were among 
his students and broadcast booth interns.[6] He has also taught at Franklin 
Pierce University in New Hampshire.[4] He occasionally has called college 
football and basketball, most notably including games of Lafayette College 
and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, where he worked alongside 
his oldest son, Duke, now with WNYW in New York.[14] In 2004, Castiglione 
published a book called Broadcast Rites and Sites: I Saw It on the Radio 
with the Boston Red Sox (ISBN 1-58-979324-2).[3] The book is a collection 
of stories from his days covering the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red 
Sox.[3] It was updated in 2006 to include material on the 2004 World Series.[15] 
In 2012 Castiglione returned to writing with a second book entitled Can 
You Believe it? 30 Years of Insider Stories with the Boston Red Sox. In 
this book, the author takes the reader back to the 2004 ALCS with the Yankees 
and that year's World Series as well as the team's return to glory in 2007. 
However, much of the book is about the 30 years that Castiglione spent 
in the broadcast booth and the personal relationships he built up over
