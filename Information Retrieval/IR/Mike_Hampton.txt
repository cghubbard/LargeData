As coach Michael "Mike" William Hampton (born September 9, 1972) is an 
American former professional baseball player and current coach. Hampton 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a pitcher from 1993 through 2010. 
He pitched for the Seattle Mariners, Houston Astros, New York Mets, Colorado 
Rockies, Atlanta Braves and Arizona Diamondbacks. He is currently the bullpen 
coach for the Mariners. Hampton is a two-time MLB All-Star. He won five 
Silver Slugger Awards and a Gold Glove Award. He was the Most Valuable 
Player of the 2000 National League Championship Series, and he pitched 
in the 2000 World Series for the Mets. Hampton was drafted by the Seattle 
Mariners in the sixth round of the 1990 Major League Baseball draft. He 
first broke into the major leagues in 1993, but had a disappointing start. 
After the season, he found himself traded to the Houston Astros with Mike 
Felder for Eric Anthony.[1] Hampton became a starter for Houston in 1995, 
and kept his ERA under 4.00 for every season he was with the Astros. In 
1999, Hampton had his best year. He broke through with a 22–4 record, best 
in the National League, and a 2.90 ERA. He picked up his first of five 
Silver Slugger Awards and narrowly finished second in National League Cy 
Young Award voting to Randy Johnson. Entering the final year of his contract, 
Hampton was dealt to the New York Mets in the wake of his big season.[2] 
He went 15–10 with a 3.12 ERA and helped the Mets greatly in the postseason. 
With two wins and no earned runs in two starts, Hampton was named the MVP 
of the 2000 NLCS. Hampton received a loss in his only World Series appearance. 
During this time, Hampton also established a reputation as a good-hitting 
pitcher, as he batted .311 (23 for 74) in 1999. His best all-around offensive 
season came in 2001 with the Colorado Rockies, when he would hit .291 with 
seven home runs. The next year he hit three home runs and batted .344. 
From 1999–2003, Hampton would go on to win five consecutive Silver Slugger 
Awards. The Colorado Rockies signed Hampton to an expensive, long-term 
contract on December 9, 2000. It was the largest contract in baseball history 
at the time.[3] The contract is currently the 73rd largest in the history 
of sports. (Hampton once claimed that he had chosen to move to Colorado 
because of "the school system", a statement that is often derisively referenced 
by sportswriters.[4]) The Rockies hoped Hampton, who had been one of the 
best pitchers in the league over the past few seasons, would be able to 
succeed in the tough pitching conditions of Coors Field. Hampton went a 
disappointing 14–13 with a 5.12 ERA in 2001, his pitching clearly affected 
by Coors Field. Like his predecessor Darryl Kile, Hampton succumbed to 
control problems. The next season was even more of a disaster for the highly 
paid Hampton, as he went 7–15 with his ERA climbing to 6.15. The only positive 
from Hampton's Colorado years was his hitting (ten home runs and .300+ 
batting average over two seasons). In November 2002, Hampton was traded 
to the Florida Marlins, then to the Atlanta Braves. Hampton won 14 games 
and got his ERA back down to 3.84 in 2003. He overcame a slow start in 
2004 by winning 10 of his last 11 decisions and helping to propel the Braves 
to another division championship. Hampton did not contribute nearly as 
much in 2005 as he was limited heavily by injuries. He went 5–3 in twelve 
starts, but was lost for the rest of the season with an elbow injury on 
August 19, 2005. Hampton had Tommy John surgery on September 25, 2005 and 
missed the entire 2006 season rehabbing. The Braves were hoping for Hampton 
to be ready to rejoin the rotation in time for the start of the 2007 season. 
The rehab was on schedule until Hampton tore his oblique muscle on March 
7, 2007, which was to sideline him until at least May.[5] Soon after, the 
Braves signed Mark Redman to be a left-handed starting pitcher for them 
in case Hampton was not able to return to action soon. After Hampton threw 
a bullpen session on April 8, the Braves shut Hampton down due to recurring 
elbow pain and said that he would see Dr. David Altchek, who had performed 
his Tommy John surgery in 2005.[6] The next day, it was announced after 
having another left elbow procedure, that Hampton would miss the entire 
2007 season.[7] Hampton began a rehab assignment on November 22, 2007 for 
Navojoa of the Mexican Winter League. In the first inning, he attempted 
to make a play on a comebacker and left during warmups before the second 
inning, feeling discomfort in his hamstring. The rest of his rehab was 
left in doubt.[8] However, Hampton reported to "Camp Roger" on time in 
late January. He threw off the mound for Bobby Cox and Roger McDowell, 
both of whom were impressed with Hampton's steady progress.[citation needed] 
Hampton arrived a day before pitchers and catchers were due to report at 
Lake Buena Vista. He ran sprints and played catch with teammates, and continued 
to pitch off the mound, and threw to live batters: Mark Kotsay, Tim Hudson, 
and Corky Miller. On April 3, 2008, Hampton was scheduled to make his long-anticipated 
return to the Braves rotation in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
While warming up, however, Hampton strained his left pectoral muscle, and 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list. On July 26, 2008, Hampton made 
his first major league start since August 2005 against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. However, he was soon injured again, and finished the season with 
only 13 appearances. His final 2008 stats included a 3-4 record and a 4.85 
ERA. On December 3, 2008, Hampton signed a 1-year contract worth $2 million 
with the Houston Astros.[9] Hampton could have earned another $2 million 
in performance based incentives.[10] Hampton chose to wear uniform #11 
in his return to Houston to honor his old friend, longtime Astro catcher 
Brad Ausmus.[11] His #10 that he wore during his first stint with Houston 
was being worn by Miguel Tejada. His physical was clean, and experts believe 
he was once again healthy. He pitched in the number 4 pitcher slot behind 
Brian Moehler.[12] On September 15, 2009, Hampton underwent full rotator 
cuff surgery to repair a tear and was expected to miss the entire 2010 
season.[13] Despite initially being expected to miss the whole season, 
on August 21, 2010, Mike Hampton signed a minor league contract with the 
Arizona Diamondbacks.[14] He returned to the major leagues with the Diamondbacks, 
throwing 4 1⁄3 innings in ten appearances. After the season, Hampton re-signed 
with Arizona to a minor league deal for 2011.[15] On March 26, 2011, Hampton 
announced his retirement from baseball.[16] On November 9, 2012, the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim hired Hampton to be the pitching coach of the 
Arkansas Travelers, their Class AA affiliate in the Texas League.[17][18] 
On November 23, 2015, he was hired by the Seattle Mariners' as a bullpen
