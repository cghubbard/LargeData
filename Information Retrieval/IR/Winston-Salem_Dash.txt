The Winston-Salem Dash is a minor league baseball team in Winston-Salem, 
North Carolina, United States. They are a Class A-Advanced team in the 
Carolina League and have been a farm team of the Chicago White Sox since 
1997. The Dash began playing their home games at the new BB&T Ballpark 
beginning in 2010 after having Ernie Shore Field (now known as Gene Hooks 
Field at Wake Forest Baseball Park) as their home from 1956 to 2009. Previous 
baseball clubs in Winston-Salem had typically been called the "Twins", 
in reference to the long-since-merged "Twin Cities" of Winston and Salem 
since 1905. The Twins played in the Virginia-North Carolina League in 1905, 
the Carolina Baseball Association from 1908 to 1917 and the Piedmont League 
from 1920 to 1933 and again from 1937 to 1942. The current franchise joined 
the Carolina League in 1945, and is the oldest continuously operating team 
in that circuit. Originally a St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, it retained 
the Twins name until 1953, when it became the Winston-Salem Cardinals. 
After a brief period (1957–60) as the Winston-Salem Red Birds, the team 
switched affiliation in 1961 to the Boston Red Sox. It remained with the 
Red Sox for 22 years, and was known until 1983 as the Winston-Salem Red 
Sox. In 1984, the team changed affiliates again, this time contracting 
with the Chicago Cubs, and changed its name to the Winston-Salem Spirits. 
The team initially retained the Spirits name after becoming the Cincinnati 
Reds A-level affiliate in 1993, winning the Carolina League championship 
in that same year. After the 1994 season, the club decided to change its 
name and sponsored a contest through the local newspaper, the Winston-Salem 
Journal, to come up with a new name. The winning entry, the Warthogs, became 
the official team name in 1995. In addition to being alliterative, it also 
referred to the somewhat-celebrated acquisition of some warthogs at the 
state zoo around that time. As the Warthogs, they were the league champion 
in 2003. On December 4, 2008, the team publicly announced that they would 
be called the Winston-Salem Dash from 2009 onward. The Dash name is rumored 
to be a reference to a nickname for the city of Winston-Salem, "The Dash", 
a reference to the dash (-) symbol used in the middle of the city's name, 
despite the fact that it is actually a hyphen. As the Warthogs, the team's 
mascot was Wally Warthog. With the new nickname, the Dash held a name-the-mascot 
contest for Wally's replacement. In keeping with the image of speed implied 
by "The Dash", the new mascot is a lightning-themed character named Bolt.[1] 
The club originally played at South Side Park, south of the downtown area. 
When that park burned, a new park was built on the north side, near the 
Wake Forest campus and the RJR plant, and named Ernie Shore Field in honor 
of the former major leaguer who had led the fund drive for the new ballpark. 
Opened in 1956, Ernie Shore Field seats 6,000 fans. BB&T Ballpark was hoped 
to be completed for the 2009 season, or sometime within the season, but 
construction came to a halt due to a lack of funding. Meanwhile, Ernie 
Shore Field had been sold to Wake Forest and renamed as Gene Hooks Field 
at Wake Forest Baseball Park, compelling the Dash to lease the ballpark 
back for the 2009 season. On June 2, 2009, the Dash announced a new scheduled 
opening for the 2010 season.[2] On February 24, 2010, the Dash announced 
BB&T Ballpark's official name.[3] The Dash finally opened the new BB&T 
Ballpark on April 13, 2010.[4] (Compiled from[5]) Pitchers Catchers Infielders
