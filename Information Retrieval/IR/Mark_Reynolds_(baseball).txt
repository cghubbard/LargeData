Mark Andrew Reynolds (born August 3, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland 
Indians, New York Yankees, Milwaukee Brewers, St. Louis Cardinals and Colorado 
Rockies. A right-hander both when batting and throwing, Reynolds has gained 
attention for his frequent and long home runs, high strikeout totals, and 
defensive versatility, having been primarily a third baseman before transitioning 
to first base for the Brewers and Cardinals. The Diamondbacks drafted Reynolds 
in the 16th round of the 2004 MLB draft from the Cavaliers of the University 
of Virginia, where he played mainly shortstop. In the minor leagues, he 
played second base, third base, shortstop, and left field. He broke out 
in 2006 with Lancaster and Tennessee, batting .318 with 31 home runs (HR) 
and 98 runs batted in (RBI) in 106 games. With the Diamondbacks in 2009, 
he established career highs in HR (44), RBI (102), stolen bases (24) and 
runs scored (98). Known for his extreme statistical output, Reynolds displays 
prodigious power-hitting, record-breaking strikeout totals and high error 
totals. Between 2009–11, he finished with top ten home run totals and at 
bats per home run rates. In 2009, he set the all-time record for most strikeouts 
among batters in a season. He also holds two other of the ten highest single-season 
strikeout totals (211 and 204), and led the league in strikeouts in four 
consecutive seasons. Born in Pikeville, Kentucky, on August 3, 1983, Reynolds 
later moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia. In 1994 he played 
for the Virginia Blasters Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) baseball program, 
where one of his teammates was B. J. Upton. Both would eventually join 
B. J.'s younger brother Justin, David Wright and Ryan Zimmerman on a Hampton 
Roads-based autumn showcase team called the Mets in 2000. The five players, 
who were all shortstops at the time, rotated among the three positions 
on the left side and middle of the infield.[1] While with the Mets, Reynolds 
was nicknamed "Skeletor" due to his lanky build and "Forrest Gump" because 
of his awkward running style.[2] Reynolds was a four-year letterman in 
baseball, basketball and golf at First Colonial High School, where he graduated 
in 2001.[3] In his three years at the University of Virginia, he was the 
starting shortstop on the Cavaliers baseball team. During his sophomore 
and junior campaigns, he played alongside Zimmerman, who had been shifted 
to third base.[2] Reynolds led the team in home runs (15) in 2002, runs 
batted in (46) in 2003 and triples (5) in 2004.[4] His 60 runs scored in 
2004 matched a school record which has since been broken.[5] His 35 career 
homers at Virginia is tied for second all-time in Cavaliers history.[6] 
Through August 2011, he was one of 29 former UVA players to have made it 
to the major leagues, along with former Cavaliers Michael Schwimer, Javier 
López, and Zimmerman.[7] Reynolds was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in the 16th round (476th overall) of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft.[8] 
Reynolds made his major league debut on May 16, 2007, against the Colorado 
Rockies. He had been called up from Double-A Mobile when Chad Tracy was 
placed on the disabled list.[9] Reynolds made an instant impact with the 
Diamondbacks, driving in 14 runs in his first 15 MLB games. Reynolds was 
the latest of a number of players from the Tidewater region of Virginia 
to make it to the major leagues in recent years, a list that includes David 
Wright, Ryan Zimmerman, B.J. Upton, Justin Upton, and Michael Cuddyer. 
Reynolds ended the season 3rd among NL rookies in strikeouts (129), 4th 
in runs (62), tied for 4th in triples (4), and tied for 6th in home runs 
(17). He also drove in 62 runs and had a .279 batting average. On October 
3, 2007, when Arizona faced the Chicago Cubs in the first game of the 2007 
NLDS, Reynolds' seventh-inning home run off of Cubs reliever Carlos Mármol 
led the Diamondbacks to a 3–1 victory and winning the division series in 
just 3 games. Reynolds also hit a home run in Game 3 of the 2007 NLCS against 
the Colorado Rockies. The Diamondbacks would eventually lose the series 
to the Rockies in just 4 games. On September 25, he set a major league 
record by striking out for the 200th time in one season when he failed 
to check his swing against St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Joel Piñeiro. He 
broke the record of 199 set in 2007 by Philadelphia Phillies first baseman 
Ryan Howard. Reynolds ultimately finished the season striking out 204 times.[10] 
He also led the majors in strikeout percentage, with 33.3%.[11] Reynolds 
made the most errors (34) and had the lowest fielding percentage (.904) 
of all major league third basemen.[12] He did have a good offensive year, 
leading the Diamondbacks in home runs (28) and RBIs (97) to go along with 
11 stolen bases and 87 runs scored. His batting average saw a significant 
dip from his rookie campaign, however, ending with a .239 clip.[13] In 
2009. Reynolds was named one of the five finalists for the National League 
Final Vote for the All-Star Game, finishing third behind Shane Victorino 
and Pablo Sandoval.[14] On July 28, Reynolds hit a two-run home run off 
of Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge landing at 481 feet, making 
it the longest home run of the 2009 season, and the second longest home 
run in the history of Chase Field. He quickly became recognized for hitting 
towering home runs (25 of his 44 home runs being over 400 feet), averaging 
his home runs at 430 feet (longest in baseball).[15] In the Diamondbacks' 
four game series against the Mets on July 29 – August 3, Reynolds managed 
to hit the longest home run in the short history of Citi Field, at 461 
feet, as well as capped off the series finale with home runs in consecutive 
innings (first and second).[16] His four home runs at Citi Field rank second 
all-time in home runs hit at the park by a visiting player.[17] On August 
10, 2009, Reynolds was named the NL Player of the Week for the week ending 
August 9, beating out teammate Ryan Roberts (who finished second) in voting 
for the honor. Reynolds finished the week hitting .448 with 6 home runs, 
32 total bases, 10 RBIs, 1 stolen base, a .515 on-base percentage, and 
a slugging percentage of 1.103. This has been Reynolds's second NL Player 
of the Week award (the other being earlier this season for the week ending 
June 14).[18] As tradition with the Player of the Week award, Reynolds 
has received two wrist watches (one for each week), one of which he gave 
to his father, and the other of which he gave to his grandfather. Reynolds 
played at first base for 26 games, where he has a .974 fielding percentage, 
the second-highest in the league of players with 125 or more innings at 
first base, and an 8.21 range factor, the best in the league. Reynolds 
helped improve his defensive skills by working with former Diamondbacks 
third baseman Matt Williams, during Spring training; work that has raised 
his fielding percentage by over 50 points from the previous season.[19] 
He has also made headlines for several notable catches including July 21 
in Colorado,[20] July 24 in Arizona,[21] and August 1 in New York.[22] 
He broke his own one-year-old major league record for strikeouts in a season 
in 2009 with 223. He also hit .260 (batting average), hit 44 home runs, 
had 102 RBI, and scored 98 runs,[23] along with 24 stolen bases. He led 
the major leagues in the Three True Outcomes (the total of the three main 
outcomes not involving defense) with 343. After signing a three-year, $14.5 
million contract extension on March 18, 2010,[2][24] Reynolds began the 
season with two home runs in the first four games of the season. On May 
20, Reynolds hit his 100th career home run off of the Giants' Tim Lincecum. 
Though he finished the season with 32 home runs, the sixth highest total 
in the National League, along with 85 RBIs and a career high 83 walks in 
145 games, Reynolds again led the league in strikeouts with 211 and, having 
reached the mark three times, remained the only player in major league 
history to have at least 200 strikeouts in a season. Most notably, his 
.198 batting average established him as the first full-time position player 
in Major League history to finish the season with a lower batting average 
(x 1000) than strikeout total.[25] Reynolds and a player to be named later 
(John Hester on April 30, 2011) were traded to the Baltimore Orioles for 
David Hernandez and Kam Mickolio on December 6, 2010.[26][27] From the 
Diamondbacks' standpoint, the transaction, which was executed by new general 
manager Kevin Towers, was to improve the bullpen and reduce the record-breaking 
strikeout total by the team's batters (1,529 in 2010).[28][29] The Orioles, 
on the other hand, needed a starting third baseman and a power hitter.[30] 
In 2011, Reynolds led all major leaguers in errors, with 31, as his .897 
fielding percentage was the lowest of all major league third basemen, and 
led the AL in strikeouts, with 196.[31][32][33] He batted .221, and was 
fourth in the league in homers, with 37.[32] Reynolds was homerless until 
May 4 when he hit a home run against the Boston Red Sox. On the next day, 
May 5, he hit a three-run home run, his second of 2012. On May 29, he became 
the fastest position player to reach 1000 strikeouts in Major League history, 
having done so in only 747 career games. Reynolds started off the 2012 
season at third base, but was moved over to play first base, (moving first 
baseman Chris Davis to third) early on in the season, where he has since 
excelled. He has played in 108 games at first base in 2012, committing 
only 5 errors, and currently has a fielding percentage of .995, which is 
tied for 4th best fielding percentage by first basemen in the Major Leagues. 
On August 17, during a game between the Orioles and the Detroit Tigers, 
third baseman Manny Machado fielded a ground ball off the bat of Jhonny 
Peralta. Machado threw off line to Reynolds, who had to lay all the way 
out to catch the ball, and was unable to keep his foot on the bag long 
enough to record the out. Peralta and Tigers manager Jim Leyland argued 
to first base umpire Jeff Kellogg, who conferred with home plate umpire 
Tim Timmons. Kellogg's call was reversed, giving Peralta first base. Reynolds 
angrily threw his glove to the ground, causing him to be ejected by second 
base umpire Vic Carapazza. Orioles manager Buck Showalter angrily argued 
that Reynolds could not be ejected for throwing his glove, but he too was 
tossed, by third base umpire Marty Foster. Reynolds initially walked back 
onto the field, as if the umpires reversed the ejection call, only to return 
to the dugout moments later. On September 6, Reynolds hit 2 home runs against 
the New York Yankees in an Oriole 10–6 win. It was only the second time 
since 1918, that a player had three multi-homer games against the Yankees 
in a single season,[34] and it was Reynolds eighth home run in 6 games. 
On October 31, 2012, the Orioles declined Reynolds' 2013 option. He was 
non-tendered on November 30, making him a free agent for the first time. 
A tongue-in-cheek article from Baseball Prospectus suggested that Reynolds 
is blind.[35] On December 9, 2012, Reynolds agreed to a one-year contract 
with the Cleveland Indians.[36] On April 13, in a game against the Chicago 
White Sox, he hit his second career grand slam off of Chris Sale. He had 
eight home runs with a batting average of .301 in the month of April. However, 
he batted only .187 from May and there on. The Indians designated Reynolds 
for assignment on August 8.[37] When he was designated for assignment, 
he was leading the team with 15 home runs. He was then released four days 
later. On August 15, 2013, Reynolds agreed to a deal with the New York 
Yankees.[38][39] In his first at-bat as a member of the Yankees, he hit 
a home run against the Boston Red Sox.[40] On August 28, Reynolds started 
at second base for the first time in his career while Robinson Canó and 
Eduardo Núñez were stricken with injuries.[41] On January 17, 2014, Reynolds 
signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, with an invitation 
to big league camp. Reynolds would make $2 million, with an additional 
$500,000 in possible bonuses, if he made the big league team.[42] On March 
25, 2014 the Brewers announced that Reynolds had made the Opening Day roster. 
On December 11, 2014, Reynolds signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on a 
one-year, $2 million contract that included playing times incentives.[43] 
After five consecutive seasons with at least 21 home runs but batting averages 
that hovered between .196 and .221, he agreed to take a role as bench player 
to back up Matt Adams at first base and Matt Carpenter at third base.[44] 
Reynolds hit his fourth career grand slam on May 4 against the Cubs, aiding 
the Cardinals to a 10–9 win.[45] The next game, Reynolds' pinch-hit double 
drove in the go-ahead runs as the Cardinals defeated the Cubs, 7–4.[46] 
He drove in the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded infield single on June 
23 against the Miami Marlins in a 4–3 win.[47] As a member of the Cardinals, 
Reynolds' first multiple home run game came against the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in a 6−5 extra innings loss on July 12. It was his 22nd career multi-HR 
game.[48] Reynolds and the Colorado Rockies agreed to a one-year, $2.6 
million contract on December 16, 2015, including up to an additional $1.1
