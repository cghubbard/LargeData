Middletown Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United 
States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township had a total population 
of 66,522,[9][10][11] making it the state's 16th largest municipality, 
having seen an increase of 195 residents (0.3%) from its population of 
66,327 in the 2000 Census, when it was the state's 17th most populous municipality,[30] 
which had in turn declined by 1,856 (-2.7%) from the 68,183 counted in 
the 1990 Census.[31] Middletown is one of the oldest sites of European 
settlement in New Jersey.[32] Due to its affluence, low crime, access to 
cultural activities, public school system, and central commuting location, 
Middletown was ranked in 2006, 2008, and 2010, and 2014 Top 100 in CNNMoney.com's 
Best Places to Live.[33][34][35][36] Time magazine listed Middletown on 
its list of "Best Places to Live 2014".[37] In 2016, SafeWise named Middletown 
Township as the fifth-safest city in America to raise a child; the township 
was the highest ranked of the 12 communities in New Jersey included on 
the list.[38] Small communities of the Lenape Navesink tribe were common 
throughout the area when the first known European landing in what would 
become Middletown Township occurred in 1609. Sea captain and explorer Henry 
Hudson, in search of the mythical Northwest Passage in the service of the 
Dutch West India Company, anchored along the shores of Sandy Hook Bay in 
1609, describing the area "a very good land to fall in with and a pleasant 
land to see."[39] While a patroonship was granted by the company in 1651 
the land wasn't officially settled. Today's Shoal Harbor Museum and Old 
Spy House includes portions of a house constructed by Thomas Whitlock, 
one of the area's first European settlers (and a Reformed Baptist at Middletown[40]) 
who arrived here as early as 1664,[41] before the English conquest of New 
Netherland began in 1665 as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War.[39] Long-standing 
tradition had Penelope Stout, one of the first settlers, hiding in a tree 
from hostile Native Americans.[42] Shortly after the Dutch surrender of 
the New Netherland to the English in 1664 a large tract of land known as 
the Navesink Patent or Monmouth Tract was granted to Baptist and Quaker 
settlers from Long Island, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, which soon thereafter 
became the townships of Middletown and Shrewsbury.[43] During the American 
Revolutionary War, Middletown and much of the rest of Eastern Monmouth 
County was held by the British. After the Battle of Monmouth, the British 
retreat from Freehold Township, New Jersey carried them down King's Highway 
in Middletown to their embarkation points at Sandy Hook in the bay, heading 
back to New York City.[39][44] Middletown Township was originally formed 
on October 31, 1693, and was incorporated as a township by the Township 
Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Portions 
of the township were taken to form Atlantic Township (February 8, 1847, 
now Colts Neck Township), Raritan Township (February 25, 1848, now Hazlet 
Township), Atlantic Highlands (February 28, 1887), Highlands (March 22, 
1900) and Keansburg (March 22, 1917).[45] Upon the completion of a railroad 
junction in 1875, the town grew more rapidly, eventually changing from 
a group of small and loosely connected fishing and agricultural villages 
into a fast-growing suburb at the turn of the 20th century. If Middletown 
ever had a recognizable town center or town square, it was lost in that 
rapid growth soon after World War II. In May 1958, several Nike Ajax missiles 
exploded at Battery NY-53 in Chapel Hill, killing ten Army and civilian 
personnel. The accident was one of the worst missile-related disasters 
of the Cold War.[46][47] The Waterfront site of Naval Weapons Station Earle 
is located in Leonardo on Sandy Hook Bay, and is used to load ammunition 
onto ships on a finger pier that stretches for 2.9 miles (4.7 km), making 
it the world's second-longest such pier.[48] The "Evil Clown of Middletown" 
is a towering sign along Route 35 painted to resemble a circus clown, that 
currently advertises a liquor store. The sign is a remnant of an old supermarket 
that used to be at that location called "Food Circus". The clown and recent 
successful attempts from residents to save it from demolition have been 
featured in the pages of Weird NJ magazine, on The Tonight Show with Jay 
Leno, and in the Kevin Smith-directed film Clerks II.[49] The Indian Trails 
15K road race is held each year in April to benefit the Monmouth Conservation 
Foundation and includes a 5K walk/run event for fun. The race, run on a 
combination on paved and dirt roads, includes many relatively steep hills 
and has been described as "the most challenging race in the state".[50] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total 
area of 58.735 square miles (152.122 km2), including 40.989 square miles 
(106.160 km2) of land and 17.746 square miles (45.962 km2) of water (30.21%).[1][2] 
Belford (2010 Census population of 1,768),[51] Fairview (3,806),[52] Leonardo 
(2,757),[53] Lincroft (6,135),[54] Navesink (2,020),[55] North Middletown 
(3,295)[56] and Port Monmouth (3,818)[57] are all census-designated places 
and unincorporated communities located within Middletown Township.[58][59][60] 
Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the township include Browns Dock, Chapel Hill, East 
Keansburg, Everett, Fort Hancock, Harmony, Headdons Corner, Hendrickson 
Corners,[citation needed], Highland Park, Highlands Beach, Highlands of 
Navesink, Holland,[citation needed] Leonardville, Locust, Locust Point,

The Sandy Hook peninsula is also within Middletown Township, though it 
is not connected to the rest of the township by land. However, one could 
sail along Raritan Bay from the mainland to Sandy Hook and remain within 
Middletown Township.[39][62] The township borders the Monmouth County communities 
of Atlantic Highlands, Colts Neck Township, Fair Haven, Hazlet Township, 
Highlands, Holmdel Township, Keansburg, Red Bank, Rumson, Sea Bright and 
Tinton Falls.[63] Poricy Creek (Poricy Park, Oak Hill Road) is locally 
well known for its deposits of Cretaceous marine fossils, including belemnites.[64]

The Township Committee operates under a special charter approved on June 
23, 1971, by the New Jersey Legislature; The charter preserves many aspects 
of the Township form of government. Middletown Township is governed by 
a five-member Township Committee, who are elected at-large in partisan 
elections to three-year terms on a staggered basis, with either one or 
two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle as part 
of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting, 
the Committee selects one of its members to serve as Mayor and another 
as Deputy Mayor, each for a one-year term. The Township Committee establishes 
municipal policies and programs and appropriates funds.[7] As of 2016[update], 
members of the Middletown Township Committee are Mayor Gerard Scharfenberger 
(R, term on committee and as mayor ends December 31, 2016),[3] Deputy Mayor 
Anthony P. Fiore (R, term on committee ends 2017; term as deputy mayor 
ends 2016), Stephen G. Massell (R, 2018), Stephanie C. Murray (R, 2017) 
and Kevin M. Settembrino (R, 2016).[79][80][81][82][83][84] Middletown 
Township is split between the 4th and 6th Congressional Districts[85] and 
is part of New Jersey's 13th state legislative district.[10][86][87] Prior 
to the 2010 Census, Middletown Township had been split between the 6th 
Congressional District and the 12th Congressional District, a change made 
by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 
2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[88] 
The split that took effect in 2013 placed 30,866 residents living in the 
township's southeast in the 4th District, while 35,656 residents in the 
northern and eastern portions of the township were placed in the 6th District.[85][89] 
New Jersey's Fourth Congressional District is represented by Christopher 
Smith (R).[90] New Jersey's Sixth Congressional District is represented 
by Frank Pallone (D, Long Branch).[91] New Jersey is represented in the 
United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[92] and 
Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[93][94] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, 
General Assembly), the 13th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Joseph M. Kyrillos (R, Middletown 
Township) and in the General Assembly by Amy Handlin (R, Middletown Township) 
and Declan O'Scanlon (R, Little Silver).[95] The Governor of New Jersey 
is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[96] The Lieutenant Governor of 
New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[97] Monmouth County is 
governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders consisting of five members who 
are elected at-large to serve three year terms of office on a staggered 
basis, with either one or two seats up for election each year as part of 
the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting held 
in the beginning of January, the board selects one of its members to serve 
as Director and another as Deputy Director.[98] As of 2014[update], Monmouth 
County's Freeholders are Freeholder Director Lillian G. Burry (R, Colts 
Neck Township; term ends December 31, 2014),[99] Freeholder Deputy Director 
Gary J. Rich, Sr. (R, Spring Lake; 2014),[100] Thomas A. Arnone (R, Neptune

Middletown has some of the largest emergency service departments in the 
area. The police and fire departments celebrated a joint 75th Anniversary 
in 2003.[116] The Middletown Township Police Department is one of the largest 
police forces in Monmouth County, with 108 sworn officers.[117] The Middletown 
Township Police Department was formed on May 15, 1928 with the hiring of 
its first full-time police officer, Earl N. Hoyer. His appointment read 
Patrolman / Chief of Police, at an annual salary of $125.00.[118] The Rude 
Awakening Program educates the youth and their parents about alcohol abuse 
and its position as a gateway drug to further and harsher drugs and substance 
abuse. The program is specifically designed to educate the student in the 
life altering ramifications of drinking and driving.[119] The program is 
mainly backed by the police department and has later encompassed EMS and 
fire into the program for vehicle extrication demonstrations. The Middletown 
Township Fire Department (referred to as MTFD, Monmouth County agency prefix 
31 and 71) consists of 11 fire companies plus additional specialized units 
spread throughout the town and is composed of 500 volunteers.[120][121] 
It is commonly stated that the Middletown Township Fire Department is "The 
World's Largest All Volunteer Fire Department".[122] The companies, in 
order of creation, are as follows: For a time these companies acted separately 
until August 28, 1928, when all the individual companies were brought together 
to form the current fire department. Since then, two more companies have 
been formed: Later, the individual companies took on station numbers with 
regard to their creation date. Navesink becoming Station #1 and Old Village 
becoming Station #11. There are other special units besides the main fire 
companies. The MTFD has its own Fire Police Unit, Air Unit, and Special 
Services Unit (SSU). The Middletown Township Fire Academy was established 
in 1974 to provide basic firefighter training to the township's volunteers. 
A tract of land was donated off of Normandy Road for the cause and the 
volunteer firefighters built its beginnings themselves. Classes began in 
trailers until a suitable classroom building was constructed. A small wooden 
multi-floor building sitting on buried telephone poles was the earliest 
training structure. Later a proper "smokehouse" made of cinder block served 
firefighters until 2007 when it was closed. The classroom building and 
smokehouse are featured in the academy's logo. A four-story corrugated 
steel "ladder tower" building was constructed as the academy's high rise 
prop. There are internal and external stairways with a standpipe and sprinkler 
system throughout, only fed with water by an engine during training. It 
also features trapdoors creating an internal column for rope rescue training. 
For a period of time there was a SCBA maze located in a lower room of the 
building until it was converted into a live burn room after the smokehouse 
was closed. Vehicle extrication as well as car and fuel fires are fought 
on the "burn pad" which is an open concrete area next to the smokehouse. 
Donated vehicles are brought in from various sources. Typically they are 
used first for extrication by a first aid or fire company and then later 
get burned for car fire training by another. Fuels fires are contained 
in drums or tanks that have been cut open. A confined space prop was located 
next to the main parking lot which was a large pipe with access ways buried 
under dirt. Trench rescue simulations were also held near this prop. One 
of the more recent additions to the academy is the flashover chamber. A 
peaked roof prop sits in the middle of the academy which utilizes replaceable 
4x8 plywood sheets for firefighters to practice cutting roofs. There was 
at one time a flat roof prop as well. The Fire Academy's motto is "Training 
the Best, for the Worst". Firefighter I (aka "basic") classes are held 
in the spring and fall. Topics and graduation requirements surpass that 
of Monmouth County Fire Academy. Other courses from firefighting to Incident 
Command and more are offered by the academy. Other agencies also sponsor 
courses that use the facilities. Aside from the Middletown Township fire 
companies and first aid squads, outside departments such as those from 
Jersey City, Bayonne, Fort Monmouth, and others have come to Middletown 
Township for training at the academy. The classrooms are also used by the 
Board of Education and for police training. The township's shooting range 
is located on the same property adjacent to the fire academy. There are 
five squads that make up Middletown Township Emergency Medical Services 
(EMS) and provide Basic Life Support (BLS) ambulances to the township. 
They are: They are all volunteer as well.[127] All except Port Monmouth 
have EMS rescue trucks with equipment to handle vehicle extrications and 
rope rescue. These squads also have boats and dive teams to perform rescue 
and recovery operations involving water which have been called out of town 
to assist with large area searches. Port Monmouth provides a bariatric 
unit, a converted ambulance, for severely overweight patients. It has been 
requested outside of Middletown Township as a back-up for MONOC's unit. 
Advanced Life Support (ALS) or paramedics for the township and surrounding 
towns are provided by MONOC. The two primary paramedic units for Middletown 
Township are Medic 206 located at MTFD Station 8 (Middletown Fire Company 
No. 1) covering a majority of the town and Medic 201 located at South Aberdeen 
First Aid Squad in Aberdeen covering the Northwestern end of town. Other 
medic units from farther distances are dispatched when these are not available. 
In Mid-2016 Middletown has provided a paid EMS called MEMS (Middletown 
Emergency Medical Services) which include paid EMT's with 1 or more year(s) 
of experience. They also provide Basic Life Support (BLS). The Middletown 
Township Public School District serves students in pre-Kindergarten through 
twelfth grade. As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's 17 schools 
had an enrollment of 10,110 students and 706.2 classroom teachers (on an 
FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.32:1.[128] Schools in the

and Thorne Middle School[146] (797) — and two high schools for grades 9-12,[147] 
Middletown High School North[148] (1,581) and Middletown High School South[149] 
(1,432).[150] Four elementary schools feed into each of the three middle 
schools. Middletown also hosts two public magnet schools, High Technology 
High School, on the property of Brookdale Community College, located in 
the Lincroft section of town, and the Marine Academy of Science and Technology 
located on Sandy Hook, which are part of the Monmouth County Vocational 
School District.[151] Middletown Township is home to two private high schools. 
Christian Brothers Academy is an all-boys College preparatory school with 
a focus on Christian education run by the Institute of the Brothers of 
the Christian Schools, located in Lincroft. Mater Dei High School is a 
four-year Catholic coeducational high school located in the New Monmouth 
section and operates under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Diocese 
of Trenton.[152] Saint Mary School (for PreK-8, founded in 1953) in New 
Monmouth[153] and Saint Leo the Great School (a National Blue Ribbon School 
founded in 1960) in Lincroft[154] both operate as part of the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Trenton.[152] Oak Hill Academy is an independent school for 
PreK-8 in Lincroft, that was founded in 1981.[155] As of May 2010[update],

There are three toll gates on the Parkway located in Middletown, two of 
them are at Exit 109 (northbound entry, southbound exit), and two at Exit 
114 (northbound entry, with the southbound toll exit in Holmdel). Routes 
35 and 36 pass through Middletown. CR 516 travels through the northern 
part of the township and its eastern end is at Route 36 near Leonardo. 
County Route 520 passes through the southern portion of Middletown. Route 
520 leads to Sea Bright to the east and eventually turns into CR 612 to 
the west, which connects to the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 8A in Monroe 
Township. New Jersey Transit's provides rail service at the Middletown 
station[159] which runs between New York City's Pennsylvania Station and 
Bay Head on the North Jersey Coast Line.[160] New Jersey Transit is a major 
commuter rail system, with track-sharing agreements with Amtrak, Metro-North 
Railroad, Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation, and Conrail Shared Assets. 
New Jersey Transit offers local bus service on the 817, 833 and 834 routes.[161]
