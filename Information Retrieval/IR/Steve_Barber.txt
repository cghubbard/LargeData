Stephen David Barber (February 22, 1938 – February 4, 2007) was an American 
Major League Baseball (MLB) left-handed pitcher. He pitched for the Baltimore 
Orioles and six other teams in 1960–74. Barber compiled 121 wins, 1,309 
strikeouts, and had a 3.36 career earned run average. He also was an ALL-Star 
for two seasons during his 15 years in the major leagues. Barber was born 
in Takoma Park, Maryland and graduated in 1956 from Montgomery Blair High 
School[1] located in Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Maryland. Barber 
signed with the Orioles in 1957. As a rookie in 1960, he had a record of 
10-7 and an earned run average of 3.22 (sixth best in the American League), 
but also led the American League (AL) in both walks (113) and wild pitches 
(10). In 1961, he tied for the AL lead in shutouts with 8, and had a record 
of 18-12. In 1963, he became the first pitcher of the modern Orioles to 
win 20 games in a season when he compiled a 20-13 record, 180 strikeouts, 
and a 2.75 ERA, which led to him being selected as All-Star for the first 
time in his career. He was again named an AL All-Star one last time in 
1966, but tendinitis in his elbow prevented him from appearing in the game, 
and also kept him out of the World Series as the Orioles swept the defending 
champion Los Angeles Dodgers in four games for the first title in franchise 
history. On April 30, 1967, Barber was removed from a game against the 
Detroit Tigers with two outs in the ninth inning after having given up 
two runs despite having not surrendered a hit; Stu Miller got the final 
out to complete the no-hitter, although the Orioles lost 2-1.[2][3] Barber 
spent the rest of his career plagued by elbow troubles. The Orioles traded 
him to the New York Yankees in July 1967, and was selected by the expansion 
Seattle Pilots in an expansion draft after the 1968 season when the Yankees 
left him unprotected. Barber was released just before the 1970 season, 
but played that year for the Chicago Cubs, and then for the Atlanta Braves, 
pitching almost exclusively in relief. He remained with the Braves until 
they released him in May 1972, then joined the California Angels where 
he remained until the end of the 1973 season. He was traded to the Milwaukee 
Brewers but was released in 1974 during spring training. Barber later appeared 
in 13 games for the San Francisco Giants in the middle of the 1974 season. 
In August, he signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, but never pitched for 
the team. Barber and his wife moved to the Las Vegas area in 1978. He was 
employed as a driver for the Clark County School District, providing transportation 
for children with disabilities from 1992 to 2006.[4] Barber died of pneumonia
