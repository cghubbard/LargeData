Guangzhou (simplified Chinese: 广州; traditional Chinese: 廣州; pinyin: Guǎngzhōu 
( listen); Yale: Gwóngjāu), traditionally romanised as Canton,[6] is the 
capital and largest city of Guangdong Province in southeastern China.[7] 
Located on the Pearl River about 120 km (75 mi) north-northwest of Hong 
Kong and 145 km (90 mi) north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus 
of the maritime Silk Road[8] and continues to serve as a major port and 
transportation hub.[9] Guangzhou is the 3rd-largest Chinese city, behind 
Beijing and Shanghai; holds sub-provincial administrative status;[10] and 
is one of China's six National Central Cities.[11] In 2015 the city's administrative 
area was estimated to have a population of 13,501,100[12] and forms part 
of one of the most populous metropolitan agglomerations on Earth. Some 
estimates place the population of the built-up area of the Pearl River 
Delta Mega City as high as 44 million without the Hong Kong SAR and 54 
million including it. Guangzhou is identified as a Beta+ Global city. In 
recent years, there has been a rapidly increasing number of foreign residents 
and illegal immigrants from the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Southeast 
Asia, as well as from Africa.[13] This has led to it being dubbed the "Capital 
of the Third World."[14] The migrant population from other provinces of 
China in Guangzhou was 40 percent of the city's total population in 2008. 
Most of them are rural migrants, and they speak only Mandarin. They have 
taken on many jobs that the local citizens are unwilling to do.[15] Guangzhou 
was long the only Chinese port permitted for most foreign traders. The 
city proper fell to the British and was opened by the First Opium War. 
It lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued 
to serve as a major entrepôt. In modern commerce, Guangzhou is best known 
for its annual Canton Fair, the oldest, highest-level, largest-scale and 
most complete trade fair in China. For the three consecutive years 2013–2015, 
Forbes ranked Guangzhou as the best commercial city on the Chinese mainland.[16] 
Guǎngzhōu is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name 廣州, which was 
simplified in mainland China to 广州 in the 1950s. This name originally referred 
to the Imperial Chinese Guang Prefecture. The character 廣 or 广—which also 
appears in the names Guangdong, Guangxi, and Liangguang—means "broad" or 
"expansive" and refers to the valley of the Pearl River in comparison with 
the hill country of Hunan and Fujian by which it was reached by the Chinese. 
In common with many other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, and 
Fuzhou, the seat of the prefecture's government eventually took on its 
name. It became the municipality's formal designation on 15 February 1921.[17] 
It is sometimes abbreviated as GZ. Before the establishment of the prefecture, 
the town was known as Panyu, a name still borne by one of Guangzhou's districts 
in the hinterlands. The origin of the name is still uncertain, with 11 
various explanations being offered,[18] including that it may have referred 
to two local mountains.[20][21] The city has also sometimes been known 
as Guangzhou Fu or Guangfu after its status as the capital of a commandery. 
From this latter name, Guangzhou was known to medieval Arabs such as Al-Masudi 
and Ibn Khordadbeh[22] as Khanfu (خانفو).[23] Under the Southern Han, the 
city was renamed Xingwang. Under the Qing, it was also known to its inhabitants 
as simply "The Provincial Capital".[24][25] The Chinese abbreviation for 
Guangzhou is 穗, after its nickname "Rice City". As late as the early 20th 
century, most of the city continued to be made up of rice paddies.[26] 
The city has long borne the nickname City of Rams or City of the Five Rams 
from the five stones at the old Temple of the Five Immortals said to have 
been the sheep or goats ridden by the Taoist culture heroes credited with 
introducing rice cultivation to the area around the time of the city's 
foundation.[27] The former name "City of the Immortals" came from the same 
story. The more recent City of Flowers is usually taken as a simple reference 
to the area's greenery. The former name "Canton" derived from Portuguese 
Cantão[28] or Ciudad de Cantão,[29] a muddling of dialectical pronunciations 
of "Guangdong"[30][31] (e.g., Hakka Kóng-tûng). Although it originally 
and chiefly applied to the walled city, it was also used in English in 
reference to Guangdong generally.[32] It was adopted as the Postal Map 
Romanization of Guangzhou and remained in common use until the gradual 
adoption of pinyin. As an adjective, it is still used in describing the 
people, language, and culture of Guangzhou and Guangdong. The 19th-century 
name "Kwang-chow Foo"[33] derived from Nanjing Mandarin and the town's 
status as a prefectural capital. A settlement now known as Nanwucheng was 
present in the area by 1100 BC.[34][35] Some traditional Chinese histories 
placed Nanwucheng's founding during the reign of Ji Yan,[36][37] king of 
Zhou from 314–256 BC. It was said to have consisted of little more than 
a stockade of bamboo and mud.[36][37] Panyu was established on the east 
bank of the Pearl River[33] in 214 BC to serve as a base for the Qin Empire's 
first failed invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary 
accounts claimed the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not 
remove their armor for three years.Gray (1875), p. 3 Upon the fall of the 
Qin, General Zhao Tuo established his own kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu 
its capital in 204 BC. It remained independent through the Chu-Han Contention, 
although Zhao negotiated recognition of his independence in exchange for 
his nominal submission to the Han in 196 BC.[38] Archaeological evidence 
shows that Panyu was an expansive commercial centre: in addition to items 
from central China, archaeologists have found remains originating from 
Southeast Asia, India, and even Africa.[39] Upon Zhao Yingqi's death in 
115 BC, his younger son Zhao Xing was named as his successor in violation 
of Chinese primogeniture. By 113 BC, his Chinese mother, the Empress Dowager 
Jiu (樛) had prevailed upon him to submit Nanyue as a formal part of the 
Han Empire. The native prime minister Lü Jia (呂嘉) launched a coup, killing 
Han ambassadors along with the king, his mother, and their supporters.[40] 
A successful ambush then annihilated a Han force which had been sent to 
arrest him. The enraged Emperor Wu launched a massive river- and sea-borne 
invasion: six armies under Lu Bode and Yang Pu[41] took Panyu and annexed 
Nanyue by the end of 111 BC.[40] Incorporated into the Han Empire, Panyu 
became a provincial capital. In AD 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, 
which gave it its modern name. The Old Book of Tang described Guangzhou 
as important port in southern China.[42] Direct routes connected the Middle 
East and China, as shown in records of a Chinese prisoner returning home 
from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas.[43] Relations were not 
always peaceful: Muslims sacked the city on 30 October 758[n 1][44][45][46][47] 
and were massacred by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the 
city's Jews, Christians,[48][49][50] and Parsis.[51][52] Amid the Five 
Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms that followed the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, 
the Later Liang governor Liu Yan used his base at Panyu to establish a 
"Great Yue" or "Southern Han" empire, which lasted from 917 to 971. The 
region enjoyed considerable cultural and economic success in this period. 
From the 10th to 12th century, there are records that the large foreign 
communities were not exclusively male, but included "Persian women".[53][54][n 
2] Guangzhou was visited by the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta during his 
14th-century journey around the world;[56] he detailed the process by which 
the Chinese constructed their large ships in the port's shipyards.[57] 
Shortly after the Hongwu Emperor's declaration of the Ming Dynasty, he 
reversed his earlier support of foreign trade and imposed the first of 
a series of sea bans (haijin).[58] These banned private foreign trade upon 
penalty of death for the merchant and exile for his family and neighbors.[59] 
The Yuan-era maritime intendancies of Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Ningbo were 
closed in 1384[60] and legal trade became limited to the tribute delegations 
sent to or by official representatives of foreign governments.[61] The 
policies exacerbated "Japanese" pirate attacks in the area until their 
removal in 1567. Following the Portuguese conquest of Malacca, Rafael Perestrello 
travelled to Guangzhou as a passenger on a native junk in 1516.[62] His 
report induced Fernão Pires de Andrade to sail to the city with eight ships 
the next year,[62] but De Andrade's exploration[63] was understood as spying[64] 
and his brother Simão and others began attempting to monopolize trade,[65] 
enslaving Chinese women[66] and children,[n 3] engaging in piracy,[68] 
and fortifying the island of Tamão.[69][70] Rumors even circulated that 
Portuguese were eating the children.[71][67][n 4] The Guangzhou administration 
was charged with driving them off:[68] they bested the Portuguese at the 
Battle of Tunmen[73] and in Xicao Bay; held a diplomatic mission hostage 
in a failed attempt to pressure the restoration of the sultan of Malacca,[74] 
who had been accounted a Ming vassal;[75] and, after placing them in cangues 
and keeping them for most of a year, ultimately executed 23 by lingchi.[76][n 
5] With the help of local pirates,[71] the "Folangji" then carried out 
smuggling at Macao, Lampacau, and St John's Island (now Shangchuan),[66] 
until Leonel de Sousa legalized their trade with bribes to Admiral Wang 
Bo (汪柏) and the 1554 Luso-Chinese Accord. The Portuguese undertook not 
to raise fortifications and to pay customs dues;[79] three years later, 
after providing the Chinese with assistance suppressing their former pirate 
allies,[80] the Portuguese were permitted to warehouse their goods at Macau 
instead of Guangzhou itself.[81] After the fall of Fuzhou in October 1646, 
the Longwu Emperor's brother Zhu Yuyue fled by sea to Guangzhou. On 11 
December, he declared himself the Shaowu Emperor, borrowing his imperial 
regalia from local theatre troupes.[82] He led a successful offense against 
his cousin Zhu Youlang but was deposed and executed on 20 January 1647 
when the Ming turncoat Li Chengdong (李成東) sacked the city on behalf of 
the Qing.[83][n 6] The Qing became somewhat more open to foreign trade 
after gaining control of Taiwan in 1683.[84] The Portuguese from Macau 
and Spaniards from Manila returned, as did private Muslim, Armenian, and 
English traders.[85] From 1699 to 1714, the French and British East India 
Companies sent a ship or two each year;[85] the Austrian Ostend General 
India Co. arrived in 1717,[86] the Dutch East India Co. in 1729,[87] the 
Danish Asiatic Co. in 1731,[n 7] and the Swedish East India Co. the next 
year.[85] These were joined by the occasional Prussian or Trieste Company 
vessel. The first independent American ship arrived in 1784 and the first 
colonial Australian one in 1788.[citation needed] By that time, Guangzhou 
was one of the world's great ports, organised under the Canton System.[89] 
The main exports were tea and porcelain.[85] As a meeting place of merchants 
from all over the world, Guangzhou became a major contributor to the rise 
of the modern global economy.[90] In the 19th century, most of the city's 
buildings were still only one or two storeys. The major structures were 
the Plain Minaret of the Huaisheng Mosque, the Flower Pagoda of the Temple 
of the Six Banyan Trees, and the guard tower known as the 5-Storey Pagoda. 
The northern hills, since urbanized, were bare and covered with traditional 
graves. The brick city walls were about 6 miles (10 km) in circumference, 
25 feet (8 m) high, and 20 feet (6 m) wide. Its eight main gates and two 
water gates all held guards during the day and were closed at night. The 
wall rose to incorporate a hill on its northern side and was surrounded 
on the other three by a moat which, along with the canals, functioned as 
the city's sewer, emptied daily by the river's tides. A partition wall 
with four gates divided the northern "old town" from the southern "new 
town" closer to the river; the suburb of Xiguan ("West Gate") stretched 
beyond and the boats of fishers, traders, and Tanka ("boat people") almost 
entirely concealed the riverbank for about 4 miles (6 km). It was common 
for homes to have a storefront facing the street and to treat their courtyards 
as a kind of warehouse.[33] The city was part of a network of signal towers 
so effective that messages could be relayed to Beijing—about 1,200 miles 
(1,931 km) away—in less than 24 hours.[91] The Canton System was maintained 
until the outbreak of the First Opium War in 1839. Following a series of 
battles in the Pearl River Delta, the British captured Guangzhou itself 
on 18 March 1841.[92] The Second Battle of Canton was fought two months 
later.[93] Following the Qing Empire's 1842 treaty with Great Britain, 
Guangzhou lost its privileged trade status as more and more treaty ports 
were opened to more and more countries, usually including extraterritorial 
enclaves. Amid the decline of Qing prestige and the chaos of the Taiping 
Rebellion, the Punti and Hakka waged a series of clan wars from 1855 to 
1867 in which 1 million people died. The third pandemic of plague reached 
Guangzhou in 1894 and caused the death of 60,000 people in a few weeks.[94] 
The concession for the Canton–Hankow Railway was awarded to the American 
China Development Co. in 1898. It completed its branch line west to Foshan 
and Sanshui before being engulfed in a diplomatic crisis after a Belgian 
consortium bought a controlling interest and the Qing cancelled its concession. 
J.P. Morgan was awarded millions in damages[95] and the line to Wuchang 
wasn't completed until 1936[96] and a unified Beijing–Guangzhou Railway 
waited until the completion of Wuhan's Yangtze River Bridge in 1957. During 
the late Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of failed revolts such as 
the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 to overthrow the Qing; the 72 identifiable 
bodies found after the latter uprising are remembered and honoured as the 
city's 72 Martyrs in the Huanghuagang ("Yellow Flower Mound") Mausoleum. 
All these failed revolutionary attempts would eventually lead to the Xinhai 
Revolution that took place all over China including Guangzhou, which successfully 
overthrowed the Qing Dynasty established a new Han Chinese ruled republic, 
it also finally ended more than 4,000 years of dynastic rule in China with 
the abolishment of the Chinese monarchy. After the assassination of Song 
Jiaoren and Yuan Shikai's attempts to remove Nationalists from power; Hu 
Hanmin joined the 1913 Second Revolution against him[97] but was forced 
to flee to Japan with Sun Yat-sen after its failure. Upon Yuan's attempt 
to declare himself the Hongxian Emperor of China, Guangdong again revolted[98] 
and became effectively independent on 25 June 1917 with help from the naval 
commander at Shanghai.[99] In August, Sun Yat-sen established the Guangzhou 
Military Government as part of the Constitutional Protection Movement. 
It borrowed $2,000,000 from the German Empire for its army and navy, then 
declared war on it on September 13.[99] The new Republic of China merged 
the eastern part of Nanhai County and the northern part of Panyu County 
with Guangzhou in 1918 and established an urban council to govern it.[17] 
Amid the Warlord Era, the Guangzhou government was overwhelmed by Lu Rongting's 
Guangxi Clique. Sun fled to Shanghai in November 1918 until Chen Jiongming 
restored him in October 1920 during the Yuegui Wars.[99] The name Guangzhou 
was made official the next year.[17] In January 1922, the Nationalists 
organized a major strike among the tens of thousands of dockworkers and 
sailors in Guangzhou and Hong Kong.[99] On 16 June, Ye Ju assaulted Guangzhou's 
presidential palace after Chen and Sun differed over whether to accept 
an accommodation with the Zhili Clique's government in Beijing; Sun had 
already fled but his wife narrowly escaped shelling and rifle fire before 
meeting him[100] on the gunboat Yongfeng[101] under Chiang Kai-shek. In 
autumn, Sun and his party raised more than 500,000 Chinese dollars from 
supporters to recapture Guangzhou.[102] Their mercenaries removed Chen 
on 15 January 1923, and he returned to the city on 21 February.[103] His 
armies were then kept in the field largely through tax levies collected 
through the city's efficient police force.[102] In December, he planned 
to seize Guangzhou's maritime customs duties but foreign gunboats led him 
to drop the plan.[99] Sun and Chiang used Soviet funds and weapons to develop 
the Whampoa Military Academy[99] on Changzhou from 1924 on. In August, 
they acted to confiscated weapons being purchased by the Canton Merchants' 
Volunteer Corps. This led to rioting and a military stand-off in the western 
suburbs from 10–15 October; its suppression damaged Xiguan with large fire. 
During Sun's life, his son Sun Fo served as mayor of Guangzhou when he 
was in power from 1920 on; his role did not survive Sun's death by cancer 
in 1925. The "Canton Coup" on 20 March 1926 saw Chiang solidify his control 
over the Nationalists and their army against Wang Jingwei, the party's 
left wing, its Communist allies, and its Soviet advisors.[104][105] By 
May, he had ended civilian control of the military[106] and begun his Northern 
Expedition against the warlords of the north. Ultimately successful, it 
turned him into the country's paramount leader. Mao Zedong worked in the 
city, running the 6th term of the KMT's Peasant Movement Training Institute 
from May to September 1926.[107][108] In 1927, Zhang Fakui recovered Guangzhou 
from the New Guangxi Clique. Zhang's suppression of the 11 December Guangzhou 
Uprising saw even greater numbers of Communists and suspect workers and 
students killed than at the Shanghai Massacre earlier in the year. Amid 
the closing months of the Chinese Civil War, Guangzhou briefly served as 
the capital of the Republic of China after the fall of Nanjing to communism 
in April 1949. The People's Liberation Army entered the city on 14 October 
1949. Amid a massive exodus to Hong Kong and Macau, the Nationalists blew 
up the Haizhu Bridge across the Pearl River to protect the communist government's 
flight to Chongqing. The Cultural Revolution had a large effect on the 
city with much of its temples, churches and other monuments destroyed during 
this chaotic period. The People's Republic of China initiated building 
projects including new housing on the banks of the Pearl River to adjust 
the city's boat people to life on land. Since the 1980s, the city's close 
proximity to Hong Kong and Shenzhen and its ties to overseas Chinese have 
made it one of the major beneficiaries of China's opening up under Deng 
Xiaoping. Beneficial tax reforms in the 1990s have also helped the city's 
industrialisation and development. The municipality was expanded in the 
year 2000, with Huadu and Panyu joining the city as urban districts and 
Conghua and Zengcheng as more rural counties. The former districts of Dongshan 
and Fangcun were abolished in 2005, merged into Yuexiu and Liwan respectively. 
They were replaced by Nansha and Luogang. The former was carved out of 
Panyu, the latter from parts of Baiyun, Tianhe, Zengcheng, and an exclave 
within Huangpu. The National People's Congress approved a development plan 
for the Pearl River Delta in January 2009; on March 19 the same year, the 
Guangzhou and Foshan municipal governments agreed to establish a framework 
to merge the two cities.[109] In 2014, Luogang merged into Huangpu and 
both Conghua and Zengcheng counties were upgraded to districts. Guangzhou 
was then the most populous consolidated district-governed city in China 
until Beijing overtook it the next year. Nieuhof's imaginative 1665 map

(2011) The old town of Guangzhou was near Baiyun Mountain on the east bank 
of the Pearl River (Zhujiang) about 80 miles (129 km) from its junction 
with the South China Sea and about 300 miles (483 km) below its head of 
navigation.[33] It commanded the rich alluvial plain of the Pearl River 
Delta, with its connection to the sea protected at the Humen Strait.[33] 
The present city spans 7,434.4 square kilometres (2,870.4 sq mi) on both 
sides of the river from 112° 57′ to 114° 03′ E longitude and 22° 26′ to 
23° 56′ N latitude in south-central Guangdong. The Pearl is the 3rd-largest 
river of China.[112] Baiyun Mountain is now locally referred to as the 
city's "lung" (市肺).[9][113][why?] The elevation of the prefecture generally 
increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone 
of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak (天堂顶, "Heavenly 
Peak") is the highest point of elevation at 1,210 metres (3,970 ft) above 
sea level. There are 47 different types of minerals and also 820 ore fields 
in Guangzhou, including 18 large and medium-sized oil deposits. The major 
minerals are granite, cement limestone, ceramic clay, potassium, albite, 
salt mine, mirabilite, nepheline, syenite, fluorite, marble, mineral water, 
and geothermal mineral water. Since Guangzhou is located in the water-rich 
area of southern China, it has a wide water area with lots of rivers and 
water systems, accounting for 10% of the total land area. The rivers and 
streams improve the landscape and keep the ecological environment of the 
city stable.[114] Located just south of the Tropic of Cancer, Guangzhou 
has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) influenced by the East Asian 
monsoon. Summers are wet with high temperatures, high humidity, and a high 
heat index. Winters are mild and comparatively dry. Guangzhou has a lengthy 
monsoon season, spanning from April through September. Monthly averages 
range from 13.6 °C (56.5 °F) in January to 28.6 °C (83.5 °F) in July, while 
the annual mean is 22.6 °C (72.7 °F).[9] Autumn, from October to December, 
is very moderate, cool and windy, and is the best travel time.[115] The 
relative humidity is approximately 68 percent, whereas annual rainfall 
in the metropolitan area is over 1,700 mm (67 in).[9] With monthly percent 
possible sunshine ranging from 17 percent in March and April to 52 percent 
in November, the city receives 1,628 hours of bright sunshine annually, 
considerably less than nearby Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Extreme temperatures 
have ranged from 0 °C (32 °F) to 39.1 °C (102.4 °F).[116] The last recorded 
snowfall in the city was on 24 January 2016, 87 years after the second 
last recorded snowfall.[117] Guangzhou is a sub-provincial city. It has 
direct jurisdiction over eleven districts: Guangzhou is the main manufacturing 
hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of mainland China's leading commercial 
and manufacturing regions. In 2013, the GDP reached ¥1542 billion (US$248 
billion), per capita was ¥120,515 (US $19,459).[123] Guangzhou is considered 
one of the most prosperous cities in China. But due to rapid industrialisation, 
it is also considered one of the most polluted cities. The Canton Fair, 
formally the "China Import and Export Fair", is held every year in April 
and October by the Ministry of Trade. Inaugurated in the spring of 1957, 
the fair is a major event for the city. It is the trade fair with the longest 
history, highest level, largest scale in China.[124] From the 104th session 
onwards, the fair moved to the new Guangzhou International Convention and 
Exhibition Center (广州国际会展中心) in Pazhou, from the older complex in Liuhua. 
The GICEC is served by two stations on Metro Line 8. Since the 104th session, 
the Canton Fair has been arranged in three phases instead of two phases. 
Guangzhou is one the largest hubs of China's illegal drug trade. The Export 
Processing Zone was founded in 2005. Its total planned area is 1.36 km2 
(0.53 sq mi).[125] It is located in Nansha District and it belongs to the 
provincial capital, Guangzhou. The major industries encouraged in the zone 
include automobile assembly, biotechnology and heavy industry. It is situated 
54 kilometres (34 miles) (70 minutes drive) south of Guangzhou Baiyun International 
Airport and close to Nansha Port. It also has the advantage of Guangzhou 
Metro line 4 which is being extended to Nansha Ferry Terminal. The zone 
was founded in 1992. It is located in the east of Huangpu District and 
near to Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone. It is also 
very close to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport.[126] The major industries encouraged 
in the zone include international trade, logistics, processing and computer 
software. The 2010 census found Guangzhou's population to be 12.78 million. 
As of 2014[update], it was estimated at 13,080,500,[2][130] with 11,264,800 
urban residents.[3] Its population density is thus around 1,800 people 
per km². The built-up area of the Guangzhou proper connects directly to 
several other cities. The built-up area of the Pearl River Delta Economic 
Zone covers around 17,573 square kilometres (6,785 sq mi) and has been 
estimated to house 44 million people, including Guangzhou's nine urban 
districts, Shenzhen (10.36m), Dongguan (8.22m), Zhongshan (3.12m), most 
of Foshan (7.2m), Jiangmen (1.82m), Zhuhai (890k), and Huizhou's Huiyang 
District (760k).[citation needed] The total population of this agglomeration 
is over 54 million after including the population of the adjacent Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region.[citation needed] The area's fast-growing 
economy and high demand for labour has produced a huge "floating population" 
of migrant workers. Up to 30 million migrants reside in the area least 
six months each year.[citation needed] In 2008, about 5 million of Guangzhou's 
permanent residents were hukouless migrants.[131] Most of Guangzhou's population 
is Han Chinese. Most of the local Cantonese people speak Cantonese as their 
first language,[133] while most migrants speak forms of Mandarin.[131] 
In 2010, each language was the native tongue of roughly half of the city's 
population,[134] although significant numbers speak other dialects as well. 
As with elsewhere in the People's Republic of China, the household registration 
system (hukou) limits migrants' access to residences, educational institutions, 
and other public benefits. In May 2014, legally employed migrants in Guangzhou 
were permitted to receive a hukou card allowing them to marry and obtain 
permission for their pregnancies in the city, rather than having to return 
to their official hometowns as previously.[135] Historically, the Cantonese 
people have made up a sizeable part of the 19th- and 20th-century Chinese 
diaspora and many overseas Chinese have ties to Guangdong. This is particularly 
true in the United States,[136] Canada,[137] and Australia. Demographically, 
the only significant immigration into China has been by overseas Chinese, 
but Guangzhou sees many foreign tourists, workers, and residents from the 
usual locations such as the United States. Notably, it is also home to 
thousands of African expatriates, including people from Nigeria, Angola, 
and the Democratic Republic of Congo.[13] When the first line of the Guangzhou 
Metro opened in 1997, Guangzhou was the fourth city in Mainland China to 
have an underground railway system, behind Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. 
Currently the metro network is made up of nine lines, covering a total 
length of 266 km (165 mi).[138] A long-term plan is to make the city's 
metro system expand to over 500 km (310 mi) by 2020 with 15 lines in operation. 
As of January 2016 the lines of Guangzhou Metro include: The first section 
of the Haizhu Tram line opened on 31 December 2014.[139] In the 19th century, 
city already boasted over 600 long, straight streets; these were mostly 
paved but still very narrow.[33] The Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit (GBRT) 
system which was introduced in 2010, is the world's 2nd-largest Bus Rapid 
Transit system with 1,000,000 passenger trips daily[140] and 26,900 pphpd 
during the peak hour (second only to the TransMilenio BRT system in Bogota).[141] 
The system averages 1 bus every 10 seconds or 350 per hour in a single 
direction and contains the world's longest BRT stations—around 260 m (850 ft) 
including bridges. In 2009, it was reported that all 9,424 buses and 17,695 
taxis in Guangzhou would be operating on LPG-fuel by 2010 to promote clean 
energy for transport and improve the environment ahead of the 2010 Asian 
Games which were held in the city.[142] At present[when?], Guangzhou is 
the city that uses the most LPG-fueled vehicles in the world, and at the 
end of 2006, 6,500 buses and 16,000 taxis were using LPG, taking up 85 
percent of all buses and taxis.[citation needed] Effective January 1, 2007, 
the municipal government banned motorcycles in Guangdong's urban areas. 
Motorcycles found violating the ban are confiscated.[143] The Guangzhou 
traffic bureau claimed to have reported reduced traffic problems and accidents 
in the downtown area since the ban.[144] Guangzhou's main airport is the 
Baiyun International Airport in Huadu District; it opened on August 5, 
2004.[145] This airport is the second busiest airport in terms of traffic 
movements in China. It replaced the old Baiyun International Airport, which 
was very close to the city centre and failed to meet the city's fast-growing 
air traffic demand. The old Baiyun International Airport was in operation 
for 72 years. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport now has three runways, 
with two more planned.[146] The Terminal 2 is under construction and will 
open in 2018.[147] Guangzhou is the terminus of the Beijing–Guangzhou, 
Guangzhou–Shenzhen, Guangzhou–Maoming and Guangzhou–Meizhou–Shantou conventional 
speed railways. In late 2009, the Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway started 
service, with multiple unit trains covering 980 km (608.94 mi) at a top 
speed of 320 km/h (199 mph). In January 2011, the Guangzhou–Zhuhai Intercity 
Railway started service at an average speed of 200 km/h (124 mph). In December 
2014, the Guiyang–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway and Nanning-Guangzhou Railway 
began service with trains running at top speeds of 250 km/h (155 mph) and 
200 km/h (124 mph), respectively.[148] The Guangdong Through Train departs 
from the Guangzhou East railway station and arrives at the Hung Hom KCR 
station in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The route is approximately 182 km (113 mi) 
in length and the ride takes less than two hours. Frequent coach services 
are also provided with coaches departing every day from different locations 
(mostly major hotels) around the city. There are daily high-speed catamaran 
services between Nansha Ferry Terminal and Lianhua Shan Ferry Terminal 
in Guangzhou and the Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, as well as between 
Nansha Ferry Terminal and Macau Ferry Pier in Hong Kong. Within China, 
the culture of the Cantonese people is a subset of the larger "Southern" 
or "Lingnan" cultural areas. Notable aspects of Guangzhou's cultural heritage 
include: The Guangzhou Opera House & Symphony Orchestra also perform classical 
Western music and Chinese compositions in their style. Cantonese music 
is a style of traditional Chinese instrumental music, while Cantopop is 
the local form of rock-and-roll and pop music. Qing-era Guangzhou had around 
124 religious pavilions, halls, and temples.[33] Today, in addition to 
the Buddhist Association, Guangzhou also has a Taoist Association, a Jewish 
community,[151][152] and a history with Christianity and Islam.[clarification 
needed] Taoism and Chinese folk religion are still represented at a few 
of the city's temples. Among the most important is the Temple of the Five 
Immortals, honoring the five immortals credited with introducing rice cultivation 
at the foundation of the city. The five rams they rode were supposed to 
have turned into stones upon their departure and gave the city several 
of its nicknames.[153] Another place of worship is the City God Temple. 
Guangzhou, like most of southern China, is also notably observant concerning 
ancestral veneration during occasions like the Tomb Sweeping and Ghost 
Festivals. Buddhism is the most prominent religion in Guangzhou.[154] The 
Zhizhi Temple was founded in AD 233 from the estate of a Wu official; it 
is said to comprise the residence of Zhao Jiande, the last of the Nanyue 
kings, and has been known as the Guangxiao Temple ("Temple of Bright Filial 
Piety") since the Ming. The missionary Bodhidharma is traditionally said 
to have visited Panyu during the Liu Song or Liang dynasties (5th or 6th 
century). Around AD 520, Emperor Wu of the Liang ordered the construction 
of the Baozhuangyan Temple and the Xilai Monastery to store the relics 
of Cambodian Buddhist saints which had been brought to the city and to 
house the monks beginning to assemble there. The Baozhuangyan is now known 
as the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees, after a famous poem composed by 
Su Shi after a visit during the Northern Song.[155] The Xilai Monastery 
was renamed the Hualin Temple ("Flowery Forest Temple") after its reconstruction 
during the Qing. The temples were damaged by both the Republican campaign 
to "Promote Education with Temple Property" (廟產興學) and the Maoist Cultural 
Revolution but have been renovated since the opening up that began in the 
1980s. The Ocean Banner Temple on Henan Island, once famous in the west 
as the only tourist spot in Guangzhou accessible to foreigners, has been 
reopened as the Hoi Tong Monastery. The Temple of Bright Filial Piety (Guangxiao) 
The Flower Pagoda at the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees (Liurong) The Hall 
of the 500 Arhats at the Flowery Forest Temple (Hualin) in the 1870s The 
Thousand Buddha Tower at the present-day Hoi Tong Monastery Nestorian Christians 
first arrived in China via the overland Silk Road, but suffered during 
Emperor Wuzong's 845 persecution and were essentially extinct by the year 
1000.[156] The Qing-era ban on foreigners limited missionaries until it 
was abolished following the First Opium War, although the Protestant Robert 
Morrison was able to perform some work through his service with the British 
factory. The Catholic archdiocese is housed at Guangzhou's Sacred Heart 
Cathedral, known locally as the "Stone House". A Gothic Revival edifice 
which was built by hand from 1861 to 1888 under French direction, its original 
Latin and French stained-glass windows were destroyed during the wars and 
amid the Cultural Revolution; they have since been replaced by English 
ones. The Canton Christian College (1888) and Hackett Medical College for 
Women (1902) were both founded by missionaries and now form part of Guangzhou's 
Lingnan. Since the opening up of China in the 1980s, there has been renewed 
interest in Christianity, but Guangzhou maintains pressure on underground 
churches which avoid registration with government officials.[157] The Catholic 
archbishop Dominic Tang was imprisoned without trial for 22 years, but 
his present successor is recognised by both the Vatican and China's Patriotic 
Church. Guangzhou has had a Muslim community since the earliest days of 
Islam; the native or nativised adherents of the faith are known as the 
Hui. Huaisheng Mosque is one of the oldest extant mosques in the world, 
variously said to have been founded by the city's existing Arab community 
around the time of Muhammad's revelation or by Muhammad's visiting uncle 
in 627. Muslims sacked the city in 758[44][45][46][47] and were massacred 
by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the Jews, Christians,[48][49][50] 
and Parsis.[51][52] The Muslims who martyred themselves opposing the Manchu 
conquest of the city are still honored by a national monument at the tomb 
of "the Loyal Trio of Muslims".[158] The modern city includes numerous 
halal restaurants.[159] The 18,000 seat Guangzhou International Sports 
Arena will be one of the venues for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.[160] 
From 12–27 November 2010, Guangzhou hosted the 16th Asian Games. The same 
year, it hosted the first Asian Para Games from December 12 to 19. Combined, 
these were the largest sporting events the city ever hosted.[161] Guangzhou 
also hosted the following major sporting events: Current professional sports 
clubs based in Guangzhou include: Guangzhou Evergrande FC has risen in 
recent years to be a powerhouse in association football in the People's 
Republic of China, having won six consecutive national titles between 2011 
and 2016. The team also won the AFC Champions League in 2013 and 2015. 
The club competed in the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup, where it lost 3–0 in 
the semi-final stage to the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League winners FC Bayern 
Munich.[162] The Eight Views of Ram City are Guangzhou's eight most famous 
tourist attractions. They have varied over time since the Song dynasty, 
with some being named or demoted by emperors. The following modern list 
was chosen through public appraisal in 2011:[citation needed] Canton Tower[163] 
(2009) The Pearl River at Haiyin Bridge Zhujiang New City from Pakwan or 
Baiyun Mountain A brick carving at the Guangzhou Folk Art Museum, housed 
in the Chen Clan Ancestral Hall Guangzhou attracts more than 100 million 
visitors each year.[164] There are many tourist attractions, including: 
Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel on Shamian The Canton Cement Factory (est. 1907), 
which housed Sun Yat-sen from 1923 to 1925 Canton Custom House (est. 1916), 
one of the oldest surviving in China. The old provincial capitol, now the 
Museum of Revolutionary History Oi Kwan Hotel, Guangzhou's tallest building 
from 1937 to 1967 Guangzhou's CBD, including the IFC (right) Guangzhou 
has two local radio stations: the provincial Radio Guangdong and the municipal 
Radio Guangzhou. Together they broadcast in more than a dozen channels. 
The primary language of both stations is Cantonese. Traditionally only 
one channel of Radio Guangdong is dedicated to Mandarin Chinese. However, 
in recent years there has been an increase in Mandarin programmes on most 
Cantonese channels. Radio stations from cities around Guangzhou mainly 
broadcast in Cantonese and can be received in different parts of the city, 
depending on the radio stations' locations and transmission power. The 
Beijing-based China National Radio also broadcasts Mandarin programmes 
in the city. Radio Guangdong has a 30-minute weekly English programme, 
Guangdong Today, which is broadcast globally through the World Radio Network. 
Daily English news programmes are also broadcast by Radio Guangdong. Guangzhou 
has some of the best Chinese-language newspapers and magazines in mainland 
China, most of which are published by three major newspaper groups in the 
city, the Guangzhou Daily Press Group, Nanfang Press Corporation, and the 
Yangcheng Evening News Group. The two leading newspapers of the city are 
Guangzhou Daily and Southern Metropolis Daily. The former, with a circulation 
of 1.8 million, has been China's most successful newspaper for 14 years 
in terms of advertising revenue, while Southern Metropolis Daily is considered 
one of the most liberal newspapers in mainland China. In addition to Guangzhou's 
Chinese-language publications, there are a few English magazines and newspapers. 
The most successful is That's Guangzhou, which started more than a decade 
ago and has since blossomed into That's PRD, producing expatriate magazines 
in Beijing and Shanghai as well. It also produces In the Red. The Guangzhou 
Higher Education Mega Centre, also known as Guangzhou University Town (广州大学城), 
is a large tertiary education complex located in the southeast suburbs 
of Guangzhou. It occupies the entirety of Xiaoguwei Island in Panyu District, 
covering an area of about 18 square kilometres (7 sq mi). It houses new 
campuses from ten higher education institutions. The whole Higher Education 
Mega Centre can eventually accommodate up to 200,000 students, 20,000 teachers, 
and 50,000 staff.[165] The institutions include: Guangzhou's other fully 
accredited and degree-granting universities and colleges include: The two 
main comprehensive libraries are Guangzhou Library and Sun Yat-sen Library 
of Guangdong Province. Guangzhou Library is a public library in Guangzhou. 
The library has moved to a new building in Zhujiang New Town, which fully 
opened on 23 June 2013.[166] Sun Yat-sen Library of Guangdong Province 
has the largest collection of ancient books in Southern China.[167] Guangzhou 
currently maintains sister city agreements with 23 foreign cities.[168][169]
