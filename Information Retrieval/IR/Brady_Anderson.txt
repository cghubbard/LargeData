Brady Kevin Anderson (born January 18, 1964) currently serves as Vice President 
of Baseball Operations for the Baltimore Orioles. He is a former outfielder 
with the Orioles, Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians of Major League 
Baseball. In 1996, as a member of the Orioles, Anderson hit 50 home runs, 
setting a team record, although that number has since been surpassed by 
Chris Davis in 2013.[1] Anderson was born in Silver Spring, Maryland on 
January 18, 1964 and attended Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, California. 
He went on to study economics at the University of California, Irvine where 
he played outfield and first base for the Anteaters.[2] He left college 
following his junior season after being drafted in the 10th round of the 
1985 Major League Baseball draft by the Boston Red Sox. Anderson made his 
major league debut on April 4, 1988. On July 30, he and Curt Schilling 
were traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Mike Boddicker. Anderson hit his 
first major league home run on August 6 off of Milwaukee's Tom Filer at 
Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. In only his first season as a full-time player 
in 1992, Anderson played in all but three of the Orioles games and led 
the major leagues with 749 plate appearances. He earned his first of three 
All-Star nominations and played in the 1992 All-Star Game at San Diego 
on July 14. By season's end, he had become the first player in American 
League history to reach 20 homers, 50 steals and 75 RBI in a season. Anderson 
finished 15th in AL MVP voting. Despite missing 15 games with chicken pox 
and patellar tendinitis in both knees, Anderson led all American League 
leadoff hitters in extra-base hits (56) and RBI (62). He also led the Orioles 
in eight offensive categories, including runs scored (87), stolen bases 
(24), walks (82), triples (8), and extra base hits (57). He batted .571 
(8-14) with the bases loaded, the fourth highest total in the American 
League. The 1994 season was cut short two months by the player's strike. 
Anderson led all American League left fielders with a 1.000 fielding percentage, 
and his 31 stolen bases in 32 attempts was a major league record for 25 
or more steals. On June 12, Anderson set an American League record with 
34 consecutive stolen bases. The streak ended on July 3 at 36 when he was 
caught by Minnesota Twins catcher Matt Walbeck. His record was eclipsed 
by Chicago's Tim Raines later in the year and was matched by Toronto's 
Paul Molitor. Anderson was the hardest to double up in the American League, 
grounding into only three double plays on the year: once every 184.7 at-bats. 
He hit two home runs on September 5, the night teammate Cal Ripken, Jr. 
tied Lou Gehrig's consecutive games played record of 2,130. On September 
6, Anderson spoke on behalf of his teammates at a post-game ceremony honoring 
Ripken's 2,131st consecutive game. Anderson went into the final game of 
the 1996 season with 49 home runs. In his first at-bat, he hit his 50th 
homer off Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, breaking Frank Robinson's 
record for most home runs in a season by a Baltimore Oriole. He also became 
the only player in major league history to be in the 50–20 club and the 
20–50 clubs. Anderson also shattered a major league record by leading off 
four consecutive games with a home run. The previous mark was two straight 
games, done 33 times. In the annual Baseball America "Tools of the Trade" 
poll, Brady was named as the league's third-best defensive outfielder, 
behind only Seattle's Ken Griffey, Jr. and Cleveland's Kenny Lofton. Anderson 
also hit 37 doubles and five triples and led the American League in extra 
base hits with 92, breaking the Orioles club record previously held by 
Cal Ripken, Jr. "Because I only hit 50 home runs once, it was, in fact, 
an aberration. However, it was not a fluke", he told the Baltimore Sun 
(March 20, 2004). "Nothing can be considered a fluke that takes six months 
to accomplish. Rather it was a culmination of all my athleticism and baseball 
skills and years of training peaking simultaneously... Hitting in front 
of [Roberto] Alomar, [Rafael] Palmeiro, [Bobby] Bonilla and [Cal] Ripken 
didn't hurt, either." Anderson added that while the 50 homers may have 
been 26 more home runs than he hit in any other season, "that's just one 
more home run per week, just one more good swing. That is the data that 
simultaneously comforted me and haunted me, the small difference between 
greatness and mediocrity." Added former teammate Ripken: "Brady always 
had a much more advanced concept of cross-training and plyometrics and 
his diet. He was just ahead of the curve... To me, (that season) was all 
about him being locked in. He had good swings every at-bat. Bearing witness 
to it all year, he was a marvel to watch. I don't remember him ever being 
in a slump... Brady always had a fly-ball swing, which he was criticized 
for as a leadoff hitter, but that year he was right on the ball. He was 
just in one of those grooves. There were a couple of instances in my career 
when I seemed to pick up the next day where I left off. It's hard to explain. 
You wish you could do that every year." Despite playing most of the 1997 
season with a broken rib, Anderson led the Orioles to a wire-to-wire American 
League East title with a record of 98-64. Anderson made his third All-Star 
appearance at the 1997 All-Star Game in Cleveland, where he played the 
entire game in the leadoff spot for the American League and went 2 for 
4 with a double high off the 19-foot left field wall against pitcher Curt 
Schilling. Anderson led the Orioles in 13 offensive categories: batting 
average (.288), on-base percentage (.393), OPS (.862), plate appearances 
(696), runs scored (97), hits (170), doubles (39), triples (7), walks (84), 
stolen bases (18), and extra base hits (tied with Rafael Palmeiro – 64). 
He was hit by pitches a league-leading 19 times, marking the second straight 
year he led the league. Anderson appeared on the cover of the Konami video 
game Bottom of the 9th '99. The game was released on August 31, 1998 for 
the PlayStation. In 1999, Anderson rebounded from an injury-plagued 1998 
campaign for one of the best all-around seasons of his career. He led American 
League leadoff hitters with a .408 on-base percentage and reached base 
279 times, ninth most in the league. For the season, Anderson batted .282 
with 28 doubles, 5 triples, 24 home runs, 109 runs scored, 81 runs batted 
in, 36 stolen bases, 96 walks, and 24 hit by pitch. He became the only 
leadoff hitter in history with three 75 RBI seasons to his credit. On May 
23, Anderson became the first player in American League history to be hit 
by a pitch twice in the same inning. He broke his own American League record 
for hit by pitch in a season by a left-handed batter, set in 1996. The 
previous record was held by Washington's Harry Gessler, who was hit 20 
times in 1911. In a post-season statistical analysis by Baseball America, 
Anderson was rated as the best leadoff hitter in the American League. In 
four post-season series, (Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees in 1996, 
Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners in 1997) Anderson had 80 at bats, 
16 runs scored, 4 doubles, 6 home runs, a .300 batting average, a .380 
on-base percentage, and a .575 slugging percentage. In the 1997 playoffs, 
Anderson hit .353 against Seattle with a .588 slugging average and a .360 
batting average against Cleveland with a .680 slugging average. Anderson 
still ranks among the top ten in Orioles career batting leaders for games 
(1759), at-bats (6,271), runs (1,044), total bases (2,698), hits (1,614), 
doubles (329), triples (64), home runs (209), RBI (744), extra base hits 
(602), stolen bases (307), and walks (927). He holds the single-season 
records for total bases (369 in 1996) and hit by pitch (24 in 1999). As 
of 2008, Anderson is one of only two players (the other being Barry Bonds) 
to have stolen 50 or more bases in a season (53 in 1992) and hit 50 or 
more home runs in a season (50 in 1996). (Bonds stole 52 bases in 1990 
and hit 73 home runs in 2001.) Anderson was not able to duplicate his 50 
home run season; however, for a nine-year stretch from 1992–2000, he averaged 
21 home runs, 6 triples, 31 doubles, 96 runs scored, 70 RBI, 27 stolen 
bases, a .376 on base average, a .462 slugging average, and 14 hit by pitch 
per year as a leadoff hitter, despite one season shortened two months by 
a player strike (1994) and another shortened one month by owner lockout 
(1995). On August 21, 2004, Anderson was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles 
Hall of Fame. Cal Ripken, Jr. introduced Anderson and called him "the greatest 
leadoff hitter in Orioles baseball, and the best athlete I have ever played 
with." During Ripken's induction ceremony to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 2007, he described Anderson as "simply my best friend." In 2012, Anderson 
was named special assistant to the executive vice president of baseball 
operations by the Baltimore Orioles. In 2013, Anderson was promoted by 
the Baltimore Orioles to the role of Vice President of baseball operations. 
Brady Anderson joined Ripken on a journey to Japan, the first trip for 
Anderson as a "sports diplomat".[3] Anderson was an obvious choice for 
a companion for Ripken because it is said that Anderson is someone who 
"could help on the mission, spread goodwill and be with kids".[4] Anderson 
and Ripken were joined by Japanese baseball's Sachio Kinugasa.[5] The trip 
took place November 8–16, 2011, and included visits to several towns (Tokyo, 
Ofunato, Nishinomiya, and Kyoto) affected by the March 2011 earthquake 
and tsunami.[6] During the trip to Japan, Anderson and Ripken hosted baseball
