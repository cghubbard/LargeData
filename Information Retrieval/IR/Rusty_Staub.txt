Daniel Joseph "Rusty" Staub (born April 1, 1944) is an American former 
Major League Baseball right fielder, designated hitter, and first baseman. 
He enjoyed a 23-year baseball career with 5 different teams. He was an 
original member of the Montreal Expos and that team's first star; though 
the Expos traded him after only 3 years, his enduring popularity led them 
to retire his number in 1993. Staub signed his first professional contract 
with the expansion team Houston Colt .45s organization in 1961.[1] He spent 
the 1962 season in the Class B Carolina League, and at season's end he 
was named one of the league's all-stars.[2] Following that season, Staub 
was signed to a US$100,000 Major League contract under the Bonus Rule.[3] 
In his first season, at only 19 years of age, Staub played regularly, splitting 
time between first base and the outfield, but hit only .220. He became 
only the second major league rookie since 1900 to play 150 games as a teenager; 
the first had been Bob Kennedy, also 19, with the Chicago White Sox in 
1940.[4] The following season, he hit only .216 for the Colts and was sent 
down to the minor leagues at one point.[5] His numbers began to steadily 
improve in the 1965 season for the now-renamed Astros, and he had a breakout 
1967 season, where he led the league in doubles with 44 and was selected 
to the All-Star team. He was also an All-Star for the Astros in 1968. Staub 
was traded to the Expos before the start of their inaugural season in 1969 
as part of a trade for Donn Clendenon and Jesús Alou.[1] The trade became 
a source of controversy as Clendenon refused to report to the Astros and 
attempted to retire; the deal had to be resolved by Commissioner of Baseball 
Bowie Kuhn who ruled that the deal was official, but that Clendenon was 
to stay with the Expos. Montreal eventually dealt Jack Billingham, Skip 
Guinn, and $100,000 as compensation.[6] He was embraced as the expansion 
team's first star, and became one of the most popular players in their 
history. Embraced by French Canadians because he learned their language,[7] 
he was nicknamed "Le Grand Orange" for his red hair (his more common nickname 
of "Rusty" has the same origin). The #10 worn by Staub during his first 
stint in Montreal was the first number retired by the Montreal Expos organization. 
He is also the franchise's career leader in on-base percentage (.402), 
among players with 2,000 or more plate appearances with the franchise.[8] 
He is also the first player to win the Expos Player of the Year award. 
After three seasons in Montreal, the New York Mets made a blockbuster trade 
for Staub in 1972 in exchange for first baseman-outfielder Mike Jorgensen, 
shortstop Tim Foli, and outfielder Ken Singleton.[1] He was batting .313 
for the Mets until June 3 of that year, when he was hit by a pitch from 
future teammate George Stone of the Atlanta Braves, fracturing his right 
wrist in the process. He played through the pain until X-Rays revealed 
the broken bone. Surgery was required and as a result, he went on the disabled 
list and didn't return to the line-up until September 18, 1972. The injury 
never quite healed right and to make matters worse, he was hit by a pitch 
from Ramón Hernández of the Pittsburgh Pirates (on the left hand this time) 
early in the 1973 season. But he still led the team in RBI's. In the National 
League Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Staub hit three 
home runs and had five runs batted in. In game 4 however he made an outstanding 
play defensively, when he robbed Dan Driessen of an extra-base hit in the 
11th inning. But while making the catch in right field, he crashed into 
the fence extremely hard and separated his right shoulder.[9] The resulting 
injury to his shoulder forced him out of the line-up for game 5. The Mets 
went on to beat the heavily favored Reds to win the National League Pennant 
in 5 games. In the World Series the shoulder injury sat him out for game 
one. But he returned to the line-up for game two. The resulting injury 
forced him to throw underhanded and rather weakly in the World Series.[9] 
Despite the injury, he batted .423 against the Oakland Athletics including 
a home run and six runs batted in. And for the 1973 post season he batted 
.341 with 4 home runs and 11 runs batted in. In 1974 he finally had an 
injury free season. He led the team in hits, runs batted in, and at bats. 
In 1975, he set a Mets record with 105 runs batted in—the first Met player 
ever to surpass 100 RBIs—that would not be matched until 1986, when it 
was tied by Gary Carter, and not surpassed until 1990 when Darryl Strawberry 
recorded 108.[10] Before the 1976 season, he was traded to the Detroit 
Tigers with pitcher Bill Laxton for pitcher Mickey Lolich and outfielder 
Billy Baldwin.[1] In his three plus seasons with the Tigers, Staub hit 
.277 with 70 home runs and 358 runs batted in.[11] He was voted to start 
the 1976 All-Star Game, where he went 2-for-2. In 1978, Staub became the 
first player to play in all 162 regular-season games exclusively as a designated 
hitter.[12] Not playing the field at all proved beneficial, as Staub finished 
second in the Major Leagues with 121 RBI and finished fifth in American 
League Most Valuable Player voting. He was selected to the Sporting News 
American League All-Star team at the end of the season as the designated 
hitter.[13] Staub held out to start the 1979 season,[6] and eventually 
he was dealt to the Montreal Expos in July of that same season.[1] After 
spending the 1980 season with the Texas Rangers, Staub returned to the 
Mets in 1981 as a free agent and served as a player-coach in 1982. In 1983, 
he tied a National League record with eight straight pinch-hits and that 
same season also tied the Major League record of 25 RBIs by a pinch hitter.[9] 
In his last at bat in the season Staub hit a three-run home run off the 
LHP Dave Roberts to push his average to .300 for the season. Staub's career 
ended at the age of 41 in 1985. He was only 284 hits shy of the 3000 hit 
milestone. He was the only major league player to have 500 hits with four 
different teams.[9] He, Ty Cobb, Alex Rodriguez and Gary Sheffield share 
the distinction of being the only players to hit home runs before turning 
20 years old, and after turning 40 years old.[14][15] Staub was inducted 
into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2004, he received an honorary 
Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Niagara University.[16] Jesuit High 
School, where Rusty graduated, annually gives the Rusty Staub Award to 
the leader of the varsity baseball team.[17] In 2006, Staub was inducted 
into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame [15] and six years later, in 2012, 
he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.[18] On May 26, 
2012, the New York Mets featured a Rusty Staub promotional giveaway bobblehead 
as part of their 50th anniversary celebration.[19] Staub established the 
"Rusty Staub Foundation" to do charitable works, and in 1986, founded the 
New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund. During its 
first 15 years of existence, the Fund raised and distributed $11 million 
for families of policemen and firefighters killed in the line of duty.[20] 
Since September 11, 2001, Staub's organization has received contributions 
in excess of $112 million,[20] and has played a vital role in helping many 
families affected by the attack. Staub went on to work as a television 
announcer for Mets ball games. He owned and ran two well-received restaurants 
in Manhattan, New York City. Rusty Staub's opened in 1977, and Rusty Staub's 
on Fifth in 1989.[21] Both have since closed. In July 2006, Staub teamed 
with Mascot Books to publish his first children's book, Hello, Mr. Met.
