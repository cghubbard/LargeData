In baseball, a golden sombrero is a player's inglorious feat of striking 
out four times in a single game. The term derives from hat trick, and since 
four is bigger than three, the rationale was that a four-strikeout performance 
should be referred to by a bigger hat, such as a sombrero.[1] The "Olympic 
Rings" or platinum sombrero applies to a player striking out five times 
in a game,[2] while a horn (after Sam Horn of the Baltimore Orioles, who 
accomplished the feat in an extra-inning game in 1991),[3] titanium sombrero 
or double platinum sombrero is bestowed upon a player who strikes out six 
times in a single game.[4] The term was coined by San Diego Padres player 
Carmelo Mart√≠nez in the 1980s[citation needed] and first appeared in print 
when Leon Durham was quoted as using it in 1984.[5] The term "Horn" for 
a six-strikeout game was coined by Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan after 
Horn's six strikeout game.[6] Sammy Sosa and Ray Lankford are the only 
players to hit for a platinum sombrero more than twice.[3][7] Only eight 
players have had six strikeouts, listed below.[3] All eight players who 
accomplished a "Horn" needed extra innings to do it; the record for strikeouts 
in a nine-inning game is five.[8] On August 4, 2009, Tampa Bay Rays third 
baseman Evan Longoria went 2 for 6, recording a golden sombrero and 2 home 
runs. The second home run was a walk off home run. This feat was also accomplished 
by Brandon Moss of the Oakland Athletics on April 30, 2013 in a 19-inning 
game against the Los Angeles Angels.[9] They are the only players to record 
four strikeouts and two home runs (the second a walk-off) in a single game 
in the live-ball era. On May 29, 2014, in a game against the New York Mets, 
Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies earned his 24th career Golden 
Sombrero, surpassing Reggie Jackson to take the all-time MLB lead for this 
statistic. On May 29, 2015 San Diego Padres catcher Derek Norris struck 
out swinging in his first four plate appearances, then hit a walk-off grand 
slam, becoming the first MLB player to achieve a golden sombrero and a 
walk-off grand slam in the same game, in the modern era.[10] On July 30, 
2016 New York Yankees player Alex Rodriguez became the first MLB player 
to earn a Golden Sombrero after the age of 40 while having earned one before 
the age of 20. [11] The record for strikeouts in a game in all of professional 
baseball belongs to minor league baseball player Russ Laribee of the Pawtucket 
Red Sox, who in 1981 struck out seven times in a thirty-three inning baseball 
game.[12] The record was tied on May 21, 2013 by Stockton Ports right fielder
