Randy Alan Flores (born July 31, 1975) is an American director of scouting 
for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB), a sports commentator, 
entrepreneur, coach, and former professional baseball relief pitcher. While 
playing college baseball for the Trojans of the University of Southern 
California, Flores was the 1995 Co-Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year. The New 
York Yankees selected him in the ninth round of the 1997 amateur draft, 
and played eight seasons in MLB primarily as left-handed specialist. After 
making his MLB debut for the Texas Rangers in 2002, Flores also pitched 
for the Cardinals, with whom he won a World Series championship in 2006, 
the Colorado Rockies and Minnesota Twins. After his playing career, Flores 
became an on-air analyst for ESPN and the Pac-12 Network. He also coached 
for USC and started his own company, OnDeckDigital, whose product allows 
players and scouts to evaluate game play. In September 2015, he became 
the director of scouting for the Cardinals. After attending El Rancho High 
School in Pico Rivera, California, Flores played college baseball for the 
Trojans at the University of Southern California (USC) as a recruited walk-on. 
He graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science in business administration 
with a concentration in finance. While playing college baseball at USC 
from 1994 to 1997, he set several pitching records that still stood as 
of 2013, including career wins with 42, innings pitched with 484 1⁄3 and 
complete games with 22. Flores was the 1995 Co-Pac-10 Pitcher of the Year, 
going 13–3 with a 3.24 earned run average (ERA) and 86 strikeouts.[1] The 
New York Yankees selected Flores in the ninth round of the 1997 Major League 
Baseball Draft. In 2001, the Yankees sent him to the Texas Rangers to complete 
a trade earlier in the year for infielder Randy Velarde.[2] Flores made 
his major league debut with the Rangers on April 23, 2002. He also played 
for the Colorado Rockies before signing as a free agent with the Cardinals 
on November 20, 2003. Flores won a championship ring when the Cardinals 
won the 2006 World Series, defeating the Detroit Tigers four games to one. 
He appeared in seven games in that postseason, registering 5 2⁄3 innings 
without giving up an earned run. The next season, he appeared in a career-high 
70 games, posting 55 innings pitched and a 4.25 ERA. From 2005 through 
2007, he appeared in 185 games, contributing a pivotal role in the Cardinals' 
bullpen. However, injuries in the second half of 2007 began to reduce his 
effectiveness, and in the summer of 2008, he cleared waivers prior to a 
demotion to the Memphis Redbirds. Flores became a free agent after the 
2008 season.[3] On February 10, 2009, Flores signed a minor league contract 
with the Colorado Rockies with an invitation to spring training.[4] He 
spent most of the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox before the Rockies 
called him up in September when the rosters expanded. He made the Opening 
Day roster in 2010 and appeared in 47 games, completing 27 1⁄3 innings 
with 18 SO and a 2.96 ERA, a record of 2–0, and a 1.28 WHIP. Left-handed 
batters collected 11 hits in 50 at bats against him. The Rockies designated 
him for assignment on August 19, 2009.[5] The Minnesota Twins claimed him 
off waivers six days later.[6] On February 10, 2011, he signed a minor 
league contract with the San Diego Padres with an invite to spring training. 
Working 18 2⁄3 innings for Tucson, he struck out 19 and walked six before 
opting out of his contract on May 15.[7] Two days later, he signed a minor 
league contract with the Yankees.[8] He was released by the Yankees on 
August 2, 2011 and immediately signed a minor league contract with the 
Milwaukee Brewers. He was released by the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday, 
August 30, 2011, after asking for his release. In 2012, Flores joined ESPN 
as an on-air analyst during the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship.[9] 
In 2013, Flores returned to USC as a baseball broadcaster and later assistant 
baseball coach, while also pursuing a master's degree.[1] In 2014, Flores 
earned a Master of Science degree in post-secondary administration with 
an emphasis on athletic administration.[10] In February 2015, Flores joined 
the Pac-12 Network as a baseball analyst.[11] He launched his own startup 
company, OnDeckDigital, which utilizes video capture technology to allow 
players and scouts to evaluate their game play. Scouting departments of 
MLB clubs started using his product. On August 28, 2015, the Cardinals 
hired Flores as their new director of scouting, replacing Chris Correa.[12] 
Flores' brother, Ron, was also a left-handed relief pitcher who appeared 
in the major leagues, playing for the Oakland Athletics from 2005–07. Flores
