"Let's Go Mets Go!" (also entitled "Let's Go Mets!") was the rally song 
of the 1986 World Series champion New York Mets baseball team. The song 
was the brainchild of famed advertiser Jerry Della Femina and two of his 
executives, Bob Sherman and Jon Olken. The idea for the song was conceived 
in July 1986, when the Mets had a powerful lead in the National League 
East,[1] and the pennant seemed predictable. "Let's Go Mets Go" was composed 
and produced by Shelly Palmer, and lead vocals were performed by Tom Bernfeld.[2][3] 
A video was also produced, featuring Mets players, coaches and fans, along 
with a cameo appearance by Joe Piscopo. The video and song was debuted 
on August 27, 1986, at a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[3][4][5]
