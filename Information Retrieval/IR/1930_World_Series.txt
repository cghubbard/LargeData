The 1930 World Series featured the defending champion Philadelphia Athletics 
and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Athletics defeated the Cardinals in six 
games, 4–2. Philly's pitching ace Lefty Grove, and George Earnshaw, No. 
2 man in Mr. Mack's rotation, won two games apiece. Earnshaw also pitched 
seven scoreless innings as Game 5 starter, but ended up with a no-decision 
as Grove relieved him in the eighth and took the win on Jimmie Foxx's two-run 
homer in the top of the ninth for the game's only scoring. The Cardinals 
led the National League in runs scored and averaged six runs per game in 
the regular season, but could manage only two runs per game in this World 
Series. This was the Athletics' fifth World Series championship win (following 
1910, 1911, 1913 and 1929), and their last in Philadelphia before moving 
to Kansas City in 1955 and then Oakland in 1968—where they have since won 
four more World Series titles (1972, 1973, 1974, and 1989). Their win this 
year tied them with the Boston Red Sox for most World Series wins as of 
that point (five) until 1937, when the New York Yankees surged ahead of 
both in World Series wins and have gone on to amass 27 World Series championships 
as of 2016. The city of Philadelphia would have to wait 50 years until 
its next World Series championship, when the Phillies defeated the Kansas 
City Royals and thus becoming the last of the "Original Sixteen" MLB franchises 
to accomplish the feat. AL Philadelphia Athletics (4) vs. NL St. Louis
