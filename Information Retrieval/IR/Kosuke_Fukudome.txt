NPB MLB WBC Kosuke Fukudome (福留 孝介, Fukudome Kōsuke?, born April 26, 1977) 
(pronounced KOH-skay Foo-koo-DOUGH-may) is a Japanese professional baseball 
outfielder for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball. He previously 
played in Major League Baseball, primarily with the Chicago Cubs. Prior 
to arriving in the United States, Fukudome played nine seasons for the 
Chunichi Dragons of the Japanese Central League. He was also a member of 
the Japanese national baseball team, winning a silver medal in the 1996 
Summer Olympics, a bronze medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics, and placing 
first in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2009 World Baseball Classic. 
He won the Central League MVP in 2006. Fukudome entered the PL Gakuen High 
School, and was quickly targeted by professional scouts as a potential 
first round draft pick. Seven teams chose Fukudome in the first round of 
the 1995 draft, the Kintetsu Buffaloes won the right to negotiate with 
Fukudome by winning the lottery. However, Fukudome had already decided 
that he would not turn pro unless he could play with the Chunichi Dragons 
or Yomiuri Giants, and joined Nihon Seimei, whose baseball team belonged 
to the industrial leagues. In 1996, at the age of 19, he became the youngest 
player to ever be chosen for an Olympic baseball team, and his team won 
a silver medal in the Atlanta Olympics. The Chunichi Dragons drafted Fukudome 
in 1998 in the first round as a shortstop. Fukudome had grown up a fan 
of Dragons infielder Kazuyoshi Tatsunami, and received an autograph from 
Tatsunami, who would be his teammate when he joined the Dragons. Manager 
Senichi Hoshino used Fukudome in 132 games in his rookie year, and Fukudome 
batted .284 with 16 home runs, and contributing to his team's league championship. 
However, he also led the league in strikeouts. While Fukudome was fast 
and had a strong throwing arm, he simply could not field ground balls well 
at shortstop. He made several errors which led to his team's loss in the 
Japan Series, and was often taken out of games in later innings. He was 
converted to third base in his second year, but his fielding improved little, 
and his hitting dropped as well. The next year, he was moved to the outfield. 
While he played poorly at first, he gradually improved to become the everyday 
right fielder. His natural speed and strong arm has since led to his winning 
four Golden Glove awards in the outfield. His hitting also improved dramatically. 
He stopped Hideki Matsui in his run for the triple crown in 2002, by leading 
the league in batting average (.343). He hit .313 with 34 homers the next 
year, establishing himself as one of the best hitters in the league. In 
2004, he joined the Japanese Olympic baseball team for the second time, 
winning a bronze medal in the Athens Olympics. He was chosen for the 2006 
World Baseball Classic team, and pinch-hit with a two-run home run off 
Byung-Hyun Kim in the semi-finals against Korea. He pinch-hit again in 
the finals for a two-run hit against Cuba. In 2006, he batted .351 with 
31 home runs and 104 RBIs, winning the Central League MVP award. When asked 
whether he had any interest in the Major Leagues on a television show in 
the 2006 off-season, Fukudome answered, "It would be a lie to say I didn't. 
Playing in the World Baseball Classic increased my desire to play in the 
majors."[citation needed] Fukudome became a free agent in November 2007. 
On December 11, 2007, the Chicago Cubs signed Fukudome to a four-year, 
$48 million contract.[1] Fukudome said in an interview that one of the 
main reasons he chose the Chicago Cubs over the other three teams trying 
to sign him to their roster was because he wanted to be the first Japanese 
player to play for the team. He also thought Chicago had a great Japanese 
community, and that it was a great place to raise his children. Fukudome 
made his Major League debut on March 31, 2008, against the Milwaukee Brewers 
at Wrigley Field. He went 3-for-3 with a walk, including a double on his 
first Major League pitch, and a three-run game-tying home run off Brewers' 
closer Éric Gagné in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Brewers went on 
to win 4-3 in extra innings.[2] In April 2008, a souvenir stand selling 
unlicensed Cubs apparel sold a t-shirt bearing the Cubs cartoon bear wearing 
oversized Harry Caray-style glasses encircled by the phrase "Horry Kow" 
(an Engrish play on Caray's "Holy Cow!" catchphrase) in cartoonish Asian 
script below. Mark Kolbusz, the souvenir stand operator, said the shirt 
was his top seller so far that season, and that 1 in 10 customers complained 
that it was offensive. After he was shown the shirt, Fukudome said through 
his interpreter, "I don't know what the creator of the shirt meant this 
to be, but they should make it right. Maybe the creator created it because 
he thought it was funny, or maybe he made it to condescend the race. I 
don't know."[3] After a story on the t-shirt appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times, 
the Cubs ordered Kolbusz to pull the shirt off the stand and to stop production.[4] 
After a fast start, Fukudome's 2008 MLB performance faded. After a .327 
batting average in April, each successive month reflected less success 
as Fukudome batted .293 in May, .264 in June, .236 in July, .193 in August, 
and .178 in September, followed by .100 in the postseason. He ended the 
year with a .257 average, and a .370 slugging percentage. He hit .251 against 
right-handers, and .137 when there were 2 outs and runners in scoring position. 
Fukudome's slide was detailed in a New York Times article.[5] Nonetheless, 
on July 7, 2008, Fukudome was voted a starter in the 2008 MLB All-Star 
Game.[6] Cubs manager Lou Piniella defended him from criticism, and said, 
"[Fukudome] does such a good job in right field we hate to take him out 
of the lineup", and further stated the team would continue to give him 
more opportunities. After the Game 2 loss to the Dodgers in the NLDS, a 
reporter asked Piniella, enraged about the loss, about starting Fukudome. 
Piniella responded, "I'm going to play [Mike] Fontenot or Reed Johnson 
or somebody else, and that's the end of that story. The kid is struggling, 
and there's no sense sending him out there anymore."[7] Fukudome managed 
only one single in 10 at-bats in the postseason. In 2009, the Cubs switched 
Fukudome to center field, after acquiring right fielder Milton Bradley. 
In July, Fukudome became the Cubs' leadoff hitter. He replaced Alfonso 
Soriano, who had been performing poorly in May and June. He had the lowest 
range factor of all starting major league center fielders (2.29).[8] He 
walked 93 times, hit 38 doubles, and stole six bases. His .375 on-base 
percentage was second on the team. On July 28, 2011, he was traded to the 
Cleveland Indians for 2 minor league prospects. In 59 games in Cleveland, 
he hit only .249. On August 12, right fielder Shin-Soo Choo was activated 
from the 15-day disabled list, moving Fukudome to Center field. But on 
August 27, Choo suffered another injury that would put him on the 15-day 
disabled list again on September 1, and that moved Fukudome back to right. 
Fukudome signed a 1-year $1 million contract with the Chicago White Sox 
on February 14, 2012. On June 22, Fukudome was designated for assignment 
after hitting .171, 0 home runs and 4 RBI in 24 games played and 41 at-bats. 
Fukudome was released June 26. The New York Yankees signed Fukudome to 
a minor league contract on July 13, 2012. Fukudome was released by the 
Yankees September 3, 2012 after hitting .264 in 43 games for New York's 
AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre team.[9] After the 2012 MLB season, Fukodome 
left the United States to return to Japan and sign with the Hanshin Tigers. 
After playing just 63 games in 2013 and 104 in 2014 with limited offensive 
production, Fukudome experienced a resurgence in 2015 at the age of 38. 
In playing all but three of the season's 143 games, he batted .281 with 
20 home runs, 24 doubles, and 76 RBI. The home run and RBI totals were 
Fukudome's highest since his second to last year with the Chunichi Dragons 
of the Central League in 2006. At the end of the 2015 season, Fukudome 
was named to an NPB Best Nine lineup for a fourth time and was awarded 
his fifth career Golden Glove as an outfielder. The nine years between 
his last Golden Glove and 2015 is a Central League record.[10] He will 
return to the Tigers' outfield in 2016 for his 18th professional season 
at age 39. On 30 July 2016, Fukudome became the 4th player in NPB history 
to register multiple cycle hits as he helped lead the Tigers to an 8-3 
victory over his former team, the Chunichi Dragons.[11][12][13] Fukudome 
was a part of the 2006 World Baseball Classic and 2009 World Baseball Classic
