The 1997 National League Division Series (NLDS), the opening round of the 
1997 National League playoffs, began on Tuesday, September 30, and ended 
on Friday, October 3, with the champions of the three NL divisions—along 
with a "wild card" team—participating in two best-of-five series. They 
were: The higher seed (in parentheses) had the home field advantage, which 
was not tied to playing record but was predetermined—a highly unpopular 
arrangement which was discontinued after the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. 
Also, the team with home field "advantage" was required to play the first 
two games on the road, with potentially the last three at home, in order 
to reduce travel. Had the 1997 NLDS been played under the post-1997 arrangement, 
then Atlanta (1) would still have faced off against Houston (3) and San 
Francisco (2) would likewise have faced off against the wild card winners 
in Florida (4). The Atlanta Braves and Florida Marlins went on to meet 
in the NL Championship Series (NLCS). The Marlins became the National League 
champions, and defeated the American League champion Cleveland Indians 
in the 1997 World Series. Florida won the series, 3–0. Atlanta won the 
series, 3–0. The San Francisco Giants made it back to the postseason for 
the first time since the 1989 World Series. The Florida Marlins were in 
the postseason for the first time ever. Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens, 
Florida Game 1 was a matchup between Kirk Rueter and Kevin Brown. Both 
pitchers were on even terms, allowing one run and four hits through seven 
innings. Both teams struck in the seventh with leadoff solo homers by Bill 
Mueller and Charles Johnson. The game was tied 1–1 in the bottom of the 
ninth. With the bases loaded, Édgar Rentería singled to right to give the 
Marlins their first ever postseason win with a walk-off. Pro Player Stadium 
in Miami Gardens, Florida Shawn Estes faced Al Leiter in an exciting Game 
2. An RBI single by Mark Lewis made it 1–0 Giants in the first. The Marlins 
would strike back in the bottom half. Bobby Bonilla hit a two-run homer 
to make it 2–1 Marlins, but a solo homer by Brian Johnson tied the game 
in the second. Then Barry Bonds hit a sacrifice fly to give the Giants 
a 3–2 lead in the third. The Marlins tied it in the bottom half with an 
RBI single by Bonilla. Stan Javier's infield hit gave the Giants the lead 
back in the fourth. Hits by Alex Arias and Kurt Abbott gave the Marlins 
the lead in the bottom half. The Marlins would add another run on the strength 
of a solo homer by Gary Sheffield in the bottom of the sixth. It was 6–4, 
but the Giants refused to concede. An RBI double by Bonds made it a one-run 
game in the seventh. The one-run lead would stand into the ninth. With 
Robb Nen pitching, the Giants managed to tie the game thanks to a key error 
by Craig Counsell. However, the Marlins would not wait until extra innings 
to try to win. Sheffield led the inning off with a single; then he stole 
second. After Bonilla walked, Moisés Alou hit the game-winning single to 
center field. The ball was scooped up by Dante Powell, whose throw home 
was in line with home plate, but the ball hit the mound, allowing Sheffield 
to score easily. This play would be the defining moment of the series, 
being replayed many times on highlights, as well as mainstream shows such 
as Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. The Marlins took the series lead, 2–0. 
3Com Park at Candlestick Point in San Francisco, California In Game 3, 
the Giants looked to Wilson Álvarez to keep them alive. Opposing him would 
be Alex Fernandez, hoping to close out the series. The game was scoreless 
until the bottom of the fourth, when Jeff Kent hit a solo home run with 
one out to make it 1–0 Giants. Later, however, the Marlins would put the 
series away when Devon White hit a stunning grand slam into the left field 
bleachers in the top of the sixth. Kent would hit another solo home run 
in the bottom half, but two RBI doubles by Charles Johnson and Craig Counsell 
put any hopes of a Giants comeback out of reach. Robb Nen got Damon Berryhill 
to ground out to end the series. In response to their team being swept, 
Giants fans littered the field with garbage as the Marlins players celebrated. 
This was the final MLB playoff game at Candlestick Park. Until 2016, this 
was the last time the Giants lost a postseason series at home. In their 
next 7 appearances, including the wildcard tiebreaker in 1998, they either 
lost the series on the road or won the World Series until finally losing 
at home in the 2016 NLDS. 1997 NLDS (3–0): Florida Marlins over San Francisco 
Giants The Houston Astros finally made it back to the postseason for the 
first time since the 1986 National League Championship Series. The Atlanta 
Braves were hosting their first postseason series at Turner Field. Turner 
Field in Atlanta Game 1 was a matchup between Darryl Kile and Greg Maddux. 
Kenny Lofton led off the bottom of the first with a double, the first postseason 
hit at Turner Field. Keith Lockhart flied to right, putting Lofton at third. 
Then Chipper Jones hit a sacrifice fly to left field to make it 1–0 Braves 
in the first. Then Ryan Klesko homered to lead off the second, a homer 
which would prove to be the game winner. The Astros would strike for a 
run in the fifth, thanks to an RBI single by Kile. Maddux and Kile dueled 
for seven innings. Kile allowed only two hits and Maddux pitched a complete 
game. The Astros left five men on base, a fatal error, as the Braves won 
2–1. Turner Field in Atlanta The Astros sent Mike Hampton to the mound 
against Tom Glavine. The game was quiet through the first 2 1⁄2 innings, 
but, in the bottom of the third, Jeff Blauser hit a three-run homer to 
put the Braves ahead. The Astros, however, would tie the game thanks to 
a two-run double by Brad Ausmus and an RBI single by Mike Hampton that 
scored Ausmus. The Astros would make a game of it, but only for the moment. 
With two outs in the bottom of the fifth, Hampton would surrender four 
consecutive walks to give the Braves the lead. Hampton would leave, but 
the bullpen gave up two more runs thanks to a two-run single by Greg Colbrunn. 
The game would quickly get away thanks to a key error by Jeff Bagwell. 
The Braves would strike for five in the sixth and two more in the eighth. 
Glavine pitched six innings for the win as the Braves routed the Astros 
13–3. Astrodome in Houston, Texas Game 3 was a battle between John Smoltz 
and Shane Reynolds. Chipper Jones got the Braves started with a two-out 
homer to give the Braves a 1–0 lead in the top of the first. An RBI single 
by Jeff Blauser made it 2–0 in the second, and another RBI single, by Michael 
Tucker, made it 3–0 in the seventh. John Smoltz pitched brilliantly, allowing 
only three hits and one run, a solo homer by Chuck Carr, in a complete-game 
victory. A passed ball allowed one final insurance run to make it 4–1 Braves 
in the eighth. Bill Spiers grounded out in the bottom of the ninth to end 
the series. 1997 NLDS (3–0): Atlanta Braves over Houston Astros Their first 
ever postseason game is a scintillating one, as they win it in the bottom 
of the ninth two to one! Here comes the runner home, oh, it hits the mound,
