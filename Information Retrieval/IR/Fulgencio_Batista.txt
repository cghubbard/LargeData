Fulgencio Batista Zaldívar (Spanish: [fulˈxensjo βaˈtista i salˈdiβar]) 
(January 16, 1901 – August 6, 1973), more commonly known as Fulgencio Batista, 
was the elected President of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, and dictator from 
1952 to 1959, before being overthrown during the Cuban Revolution. Fulgencio 
Batista initially rose to power as part of the 1933 Revolt of the Sergeants 
that overthrew the authoritarian rule of Gerardo Machado. Batista then 
appointed himself chief of the armed forces, with the rank of colonel, 
and effectively controlled the five-member Presidency. He maintained this 
control through a string of puppet presidents until 1940, when he was himself 
elected President of Cuba on a populist platform.[1][2] He then instated 
the 1940 Constitution of Cuba, considered progressive for its time,[3] 
and served until 1944. After finishing his term he lived in the United 
States, returning to Cuba to run for president in 1952. Facing certain 
electoral defeat, he led a military coup that preempted the election. Back 
in power, Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political 
liberties, including the right to strike. He then aligned with the wealthiest 
landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a 
stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans.[4] 
Batista's increasingly corrupt and repressive government then began to 
systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, 
by negotiating lucrative relationships with the American mafia, who controlled 
the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large 
US-based multinationals who were awarded lucrative contracts.[4][5] To 
quell the growing discontent amongst the populace—which was subsequently 
displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations—Batista established 
tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the 
Repression of Communist Activities to carry out wide-scale violence, torture 
and public executions; ultimately killing anywhere from hundreds to 20,000 
people.[6][7][8] For several years until 1959, the Batista government received 
financial, military, and logistical support from the United States.[9] 
Catalyzing the resistance to such tactics, for two years (December 1956 
– December 1958) Fidel Castro's July 26 Movement and other nationalist 
rebelling elements led an urban and rural-based guerrilla uprising against 
Batista's government, which culminated in his eventual defeat by rebels 
under the command of Che Guevara at the Battle of Santa Clara on New Year's 
Day 1959. Batista immediately fled the island with an amassed personal 
fortune to the Dominican Republic, where strongman and previous military 
ally Rafael Trujillo held power. Batista eventually found political asylum 
in Oliveira Salazar's Portugal, where he lived until dying of a heart attack 
on August 6, 1973, near Marbella, Spain.[10] Batista was born in the town 
of Veguita, located in the municipality of Banes, Cuba, province of Holguín, 
in 1901, to Belisario Batista Palermo[11] and Carmela Zaldívar González, 
who had fought in the Cuban War of Independence. He was of mixed Spanish, 
African, and indigenous Caribbean descent with a part-Chinese father.[12][13] 
His mother named him Rubén and gave him her last name, Zaldívar. His father 
did not want to register him as a Batista. In the registration records 
of the Banes courthouse, he was legally Rubén Zaldívar until 1939, when, 
as Fulgencio Batista, he became a presidential candidate and it was discovered 
that this name did not exist. Both Batista's parents are believed to have 
been of mixed race, and one may have had indigenous Caribbean blood.[14] 
Batista was initially educated at a public school in Banes, and later attended 
night classes at an American Quaker school.[15] He left home at age 14, 
after the death of his mother. Coming from a humble background, he earned 
a living as a laborer in the cane fields, docks, and railroads.[16] He 
was a tailor, mechanic, charcoal vendor and fruit peddler.[16] In 1921, 
he traveled to Havana and joined the army as a private in April that year.[17] 
After learning shorthand and typing, Batista left the army in 1923, working 
briefly as a teacher of stenography before enlisting in the Guardia Rural 
(rural police). He transferred back to the army as a corporal, becoming 
secretary to a regimental colonel.[18] In September 1933, he held the rank 
of sergeant stenographer and as such acted as the secretary of a group 
of non-commissioned officers who led a "sergeant's conspiracy" for better 
conditions and improved prospects of promotion.[19] In 1933, Batista led 
an uprising called the Revolt of the Sergeants, as part of the coup that 
overthrew the government of Gerardo Machado.[20] Machado was succeeded 
by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada, who lacked a political coalition 
that could sustain him and was soon replaced.[21] A short-lived five-member 
presidency, known as the Pentarchy of 1933, was established. It included 
a representative from each anti-Machado faction. Batista was not a member, 
but controlled Cuba's armed forces. Within days, the representative for 
the students and professors of the University of Havana, Ramón Grau San 
Martín, was made president—and Batista became the Army Chief of Staff, 
with the rank of colonel, effectively putting him in control of the presidency.[22] 
The majority of the commissioned officer corps were forced to retire or, 
some speculate, were killed.[22] Grau remained president for just over 
100 days before Batista, conspiring with the U.S. envoy Sumner Welles, 
forced him to resign in January 1934.[20] Grau was replaced by Carlos Mendieta, 
and within five days the U.S. recognized Cuba's new government, which lasted 
eleven months. Batista then became the strongman behind a succession of 
puppet presidents until he was himself elected president in 1940.[20] After 
Mendieta, succeeding governments were led by José Barnet (5 months) and 
Miguel Mariano Gómez (7 months) before Federico Laredo Brú ruled from December 
1936 to October 1940.[21] Batista, supported by the Democratic Socialist 
Coalition which included Julio Antonio Mella's Communist Party, defeated 
Grau in the first presidential election under the new Cuban constitution 
in the 1940 election, and served a four-year term as President of Cuba, 
the first non-white Cuban in that office.[23][24] Although Batista supported 
capitalism and admired the United States, he was endorsed by the old Communist 
Party of Cuba, which at the time had little significance and no chance 
of an electoral victory.[24] This support was primarily due to Batista's 
labor laws and his support for labor unions, with which the Communists 
had close ties.[25] In fact, Communists attacked the anti-Batista opposition, 
saying Grau and others were "fascists" and "reactionaries."[26] During 
this term in office, Batista carried out major social reforms[24] and established 
numerous economic regulations and pro-union policies.[26] Cuba entered 
World War II on the side of the Allies on December 8, 1941, declaring war 
on Japan the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 11, the 
Batista government declared war on Germany and Italy. In December 1942, 
after a friendly visit to Washington, Batista said Latin America would 
applaud a decision by the United Nations to go to war with Francisco Franco's 
Spain, calling the regime "fascist".[27][28] In 1944, Batista's handpicked 
candidate for his successor, Carlos Saladrigas Zayas,[29] was defeated 
by Grau. In the final months of his presidency, Batista sought to handicap 
the incoming Grau administration. In a July 17, 1944, dispatch to the U.S. 
Secretary of State, U.S. Ambassador Spruille Braden wrote: It is becoming 
increasingly apparent that President Batista intends to discomfit the incoming 
Administration in every way possible, particularly financially. A systematic 
raid on the Treasury is in full swing with the result that Dr. Grau will 
probably find empty coffers when he takes office on October 10. It is blatant 
that President Batista desires that Dr. Grau San Martin should assume obligations 
which in fairness and equity should be a matter of settlement by the present 
Administration.[30] Shortly after his successor was inaugurated, Batista 
left Cuba for the United States. "I just felt safer there," he said. He 
divorced his wife, Elisa, and married Marta Fernández Batista in 1945. 
Two of their four children were born in the United States. For the next 
eight years, Batista remained in the background, spending time in the Waldorf-Astoria 
in New York City and a home in Daytona Beach, Florida.[20] He continued 
to participate in Cuban politics, and was elected to the Cuban Senate in 
absentia in 1948. Returning to Cuba, he decided to run for president and 
received permission from President Grau, whereupon he formed the United 
Action Party. He later founded the Progressive Action Party, on taking 
power, but never regained his former popular support, though the unions 
supported him until the end.[31][32] In 1952, Batista again ran for president. 
In a three-way race, Roberto Agramonte of the Orthodox Party led in all 
the polls, followed by Carlos Hevia of the Authentic Party. Batista's United 
Action coalition was running a distant third.[citation needed] On March 
10, 1952, three months before the elections, Batista, with army backing, 
staged a coup and seized power. He ousted outgoing President Carlos Prío 
Socarrás, canceled the elections, and took control of the government as 
"provisional president." Shortly after the coup, the United States government 
recognized his government. When asked by the U.S. government to analyze 
Batista's Cuba, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said "The corruption of the 
Government, the brutality of the police, the government's indifference 
to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social 
justice and economic justice ... is an open invitation to revolution."[33] 
Again in power, Batista did not continue the progressive social policies 
of his earlier term. He wanted recognition by the upper strata of Cuban 
society, which had never accepted him in their social circles. He also 
worked to increase his personal fortune.[citation needed] Upon his seizure 
of power, Batista inherited a country that was relatively prosperous for 
Latin America. Although a third of the population still lived in poverty, 
Cuba was one of the five most developed countries in the region (According 
to the figures of the government of Batista).[34] In the 1950s, Cuba's 
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was roughly equal to that of Italy 
at the time, although Cuba's per-capita GDP was still only a sixth of that 
of the United States.[35] Moreover, although corruption and inequality 
were rife under Batista, Cuban industrial workers' wages rose significantly.[35] 
According to the International Labor Organization, the average industrial 
salary in Cuba was the world's eighth-highest in 1958, and the average 
agricultural wage was higher than some European nations. However, despite 
an array of positive indicators, in 1953, the average Cuban family only 
had an income of $6.00 a week, 15% to 20% of the labor force was chronically 
unemployed, and only a third of the homes had running water.[36] Brothels 
flourished. A major industry grew up around them; government officials 
received bribes, policemen collected protection money. Prostitutes could 
be seen standing in doorways, strolling the streets, or leaning from windows. 
One report estimated that 11,500 of them worked their trade in Havana. 
Beyond the outskirts of the capital, beyond the slot machines, was one 
of the poorest, and most beautiful countries in the Western world. In the 
1950s, Havana served as "a hedonistic playground for the world's elite", 
producing sizable gambling, prostitution and drug profits for American 
Mafiosos, corrupt law-enforcement officials, and their politically elected 
cronies.[39] In fact, drugs, be it marijuana or cocaine, were so plentiful 
at the time that one American magazine in 1950 proclaimed "Narcotics are 
hardly more difficult to obtain in Cuba than a shot of rum. And only slightly 
more expensive."[39] In a bid to profit from such an environment, Batista 
established lasting relationships with organized crime, notably with American 
mobsters Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano, and under his rule Havana became 
known as "the Latin Las Vegas."[40] Batista and Lansky formed a friendship 
and business relationship that flourished for a decade. During a stay at 
the Waldorf-Astoria in New York in the late 1940s, it was mutually agreed 
that, in return for kickbacks, Batista would give Lansky and the Mafia 
control of Havana's racetracks and casinos.[41] After World War II, American 
mobster Lucky Luciano was paroled from prison on the condition that he 
permanently return to Sicily. Luciano secretly moved to Cuba, where he 
worked to resume control over American Mafia operations. Luciano also ran 
a number of casinos in Cuba with the sanction of Batista, though the American 
government eventually succeeded in pressuring the Batista government to 
deport him.[42] Batista encouraged large-scale gambling in Havana. In 1955, 
he announced that Cuba would grant a gaming license to anyone who invested 
US$1 million in a hotel or $200,000 in a new nightclub—and that the government 
would provide matching public funds for construction, a 10-year tax exemption, 
and waive duties on imported equipment and furnishings for new hotels. 
Each casino would pay the government $250,000 for the license, plus a percentage 
of the profits. The policy omitted background checks, as required for casino 
operations in the United States, which opened the door for casino investors 
with illegally obtained funds. Cuban contractors with the right connections 
made windfalls by importing, duty-free, more materials than needed for 
new hotels and selling the surplus to others. It was rumored that, besides 
the $250,000 to obtain a license, an additional "under the table" fee was 
sometimes required.[43] Lansky became a prominent figure in Cuba's gambling 
operations,[20] and exerted influence over Batista's casino policies. Lansky 
also turned Cuba into an international drug trafficking port. The Mafia's 
Havana Conference was held on December 22, 1946, at the Hotel Nacional 
de Cuba; this was the first full-scale meeting of American underworld leaders 
since the Chicago meeting in 1932. Lansky set about cleaning up the games 
at the Montmartre Club, which soon became the "place to be" in Havana. 
He also wanted to open a casino in the Hotel Nacional, the most elegant 
hotel in Havana. Batista endorsed Lansky's idea over the objections of 
American expatriates such as Ernest Hemingway, and the renovated casino 
wing opened for business in 1955 with a show by Eartha Kitt. The casino 
was an immediate success.[44] As the new hotels, nightclubs, and casinos 
opened, Batista collected his share of the profits. Nightly, the "bagman" 
for his wife collected 10% of the profits at Santo Trafficante's interests, 
the Sans Souci cabaret, and the casinos in the hotels Sevilla-Biltmore, 
Commodoro, Deauville, and Capri (partly owned by the actor George Raft). 
His take from the Lansky casinos—his prized Habana Riviera, the Hotel Nacional, 
the Montmartre Club, and others—was said to be 30%.[45] Lansky was said 
to have personally contributed millions of dollars per year to Batista's 
Swiss bank accounts.[46] At the beginning of 1959 United States companies 
owned about 40 percent of the Cuban sugar lands—almost all the cattle ranches—90 
percent of the mines and mineral concessions—80 percent of the utilities—practically 
all the oil industry—and supplied two-thirds of Cuba's imports. In a manner 
that antagonized the Cuban people, the U.S. government used its influence 
to advance the interests of and increase the profits of the private American 
companies, which "dominated the island's economy."[36] As a symbol of this 
relationship, ITT Corporation, an American-owned multinational telephone 
company, presented Batista with a Golden Telephone, as an "expression of 
gratitude" for the "excessive telephone rate increase" that Batista granted 
at the urging of the U.S. government.[36] Earl T. Smith, former U.S. Ambassador 
to Cuba, testified to the U.S. Senate in 1960 that, "Until Castro, the 
U.S. was so overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that the American ambassador 
was the second most important man, sometimes even more important than the 
Cuban president."[47] In addition, nearly "all aid" from the U.S. to Batista's 
government was in the "form of weapons assistance," which "merely strengthened 
the Batista dictatorship" and "completely failed to advance the economic 
welfare of the Cuban people."[36] Such actions later "enabled Castro and 
the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent 
to Cuban aspirations for a decent life."[36] According to historian and 
author James S. Olson, the U.S. government essentially became a "co-conspirator" 
in the arrangement because of Batista's strong opposition to communism, 
which, in the rhetoric of the Cold War, seemed to maintain business stability 
and a pro-U.S. posture on the island.[4] Thus, in the view of Olson, "The 
U.S. government had no difficulty in dealing with him, even if he was a 
hopeless despot."[4] On October 6, 1960 Senator John F. Kennedy, in the 
midst of his campaign for the U.S. Presidency, decried Batista's relationship 
with the U.S. government and criticized the Eisenhower administration for 
supporting him: "Fulgencio Batista murdered 20,000 Cubans in seven years 
... and he turned Democratic Cuba into a complete police state—destroying 
every individual liberty. Yet our aid to his regime, and the ineptness 
of our policies, enabled Batista to invoke the name of the United States 
in support of his reign of terror. Administration spokesmen publicly praised 
Batista—hailed him as a staunch ally and a good friend—at a time when Batista 
was murdering thousands, destroying the last vestiges of freedom, and stealing 
hundreds of millions of dollars from the Cuban people, and we failed to 
press for free elections."[36] I believe that there is no country in the 
world including any and all the countries under colonial domination, where 
economic colonization, humiliation and exploitation were worse than in 
Cuba, in part owing to my country's policies during the Batista regime. 
I approved the proclamation which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, 
when he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to rid Cuba 
of corruption. I will even go further: to some extent it is as though Batista 
was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States. 
Now we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the Batista regime, 
I am in agreement with the first Cuban revolutionaries. That is perfectly 
clear. On July 26, 1953, just over a year after Batista's second coup, 
a small group of revolutionaries attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago. 
Government forces easily defeated the assault and jailed its leaders, while 
many others fled the country. The primary leader of the attack, Fidel Castro, 
was a young attorney who had run for parliament in the canceled 1952 elections. 
Although Castro was never officially nominated, he felt that Batista's 
coup had sidetracked what would have been a promising political career 
for him.[48] In the wake of the Moncada assault, Batista suspended constitutional 
guarantees and increasingly relied on police tactics in an attempt to "frighten 
the population through open displays of brutality."[20] Batista held an 
election in 1954, running as the candidate of a political coalition that 
included the Progressive Action Party, the Radical Union Party, and the 
Liberal Party.[49] The opposition divided into abstentionists and electoralists. 
The abstentionists favored boycotting the elections regardless of the circumstances 
in which they were held, whereas the electoralists sought certain rights 
and guarantees to participate.[50] The CIA had predicted that Batista would 
use any means necessary to ensure he won the election. Batista lived up 
to their expectations, utilizing fraud and intimidation to secure his presidency. 
This led most of the other parties to boycott the elections.[51] Former 
President Ramón Grau San Martín, leading the electoralist factions of the 
Cuban Revolutionary Party, participated through the political campaign 
but withdrew from the campaign days before election day, charging that 
his supporters had been terrorized.[52] Thus Batista was elected president 
with the support of 45.6% of registered voters. Despite the boycott, Grau 
received the support of 6.8% of those who voted. The remaining voters abstained.[53] 
By late 1955, student riots and anti-Batista demonstrations had become 
frequent, and unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce 
could not find jobs.[54][55] These were dealt with through increasing repression. 
All youth were seen as suspected revolutionaries.[56] Due to its continued 
opposition to Batista and the large amount of revolutionary activity taking 
place on its campus, the University of Havana was temporarily closed on 
November 30, 1956 (it did not reopen until 1959 under the first revolutionary 
government). On March 13, 1957, student leader José Antonio Echeverría 
was killed by police outside Radio Reloj in Havana after announcing that 
Batista had been killed in a student attack on the Presidential Palace. 
In reality, Batista survived, and the students of the Federation of University 
Students (FEU) and the Directorio (DR) who led the attack were killed in 
the response by the military and police. Castro quickly condemned the attack, 
since the July 26 Movement had not participated in it.[57] In April 1956, 
Batista called popular military leader Col. Ramón Barquín back to Cuba 
from his post as military attaché to the United States. Believing Barquín 
would support his rule, Batista promoted him to General.[58] However, Barquín's 
Conspiración de los Puros (Conspiracy of the Pure) was already underway 
and had already progressed too far. On April 6, 1956, Barquín led hundreds 
of career officers in a coup attempt, but was frustrated by Lieutenant 
Ríos Morejón, who betrayed the plan. Barquín was sentenced to solitary 
confinement for eight years on the Isle of Pines, while some officers were 
sentenced to death for treason.[58] Many others were allowed to remain 
in the military without reprimand.[59] The purge of the officer corps contributed 
to the inability of the Cuban army to successfully combat Castro and his 
guerrillas.[58][60] Batista's police responded to increasing popular unrest 
by torturing and killing young men in the cities. However, his army was 
ineffective against the rebels based in the Sierra Maestra and Escambray 
mountains.[20] Another possible explanation for the failure to crush the 
rebellion was offered by author Carlos Alberto Montaner: "Batista does 
not finish Fidel out of greed ... His is a government of thieves. To have 
this small guerrilla band in the mountains is to his advantage, so that 
he can order special defense expenditures that they can steal."[20] Batista's 
rule became increasingly unpopular among the population, and the Soviet 
Union began to secretly support Castro.[61] Some of Batista's generals 
also criticized him in later years, saying that Batista's excessive interference 
in his generals' military plans to defeat the rebels hampered Army morale 
and rendered all operations ineffective.[59] In an effort to gather information 
about Castro's army, Batista's secret police pulled in people for questioning. 
Many innocent people were tortured by Batista's police, while suspects, 
including youth, were publicly executed as a warning to others who were 
considering joining the insurgency. Additionally, "Hundreds of mangled 
bodies were left hanging from lamp posts or dumped in the streets in a 
grotesque variation of the Spanish colonial practice of public executions."[56] 
The brutal behavior backfired and increased support for the guerrillas. 
In 1958, 45 organizations signed an open letter supporting the July 26 
Movement, among them national bodies representing lawyers, architects, 
dentists, accountants, and social workers. Castro, who had originally relied 
on the support of the poor, was now gaining the backing of the influential 
middle classes.[citation needed] The United States supplied Batista with 
planes, ships, tanks, and the latest technology, such as napalm, which 
he used against the insurgency. However, in March 1958, the U.S. announced 
it would stop selling arms to the Cuban government.[63] Soon after, the 
U.S. imposed an arms embargo, further weakening the government's position,[64] 
although land owners and others who benefited from the government continued 
to support Batista.[25] Elections were scheduled for June 1958, as required 
by the Constitution, but were delayed until November 1958, when Castro 
and the revolutionaries called for a general strike and placed several 
bombs in civilian areas of the country. Three main candidates ran in the 
elections: Carlos Márquez Sterling of the Party of the Free People, former 
President Ramón Grau San Martín of the Cuban Revolutionary Party-Authentic, 
and Andrés Rivero Agüero of the government coalition. According to Carlos 
Márquez Sterling, all three were threatened by Castro, and several assassination 
attempts were made on both Ramón Grau San Martín and Carlos Márquez Sterling. 
On Election Day, estimates on the turnout range from 30–50% in the areas 
where voting took place, which did not include parts of Las Villas and 
Oriente, which were controlled by Castro.[65] Márquez Sterling also stated 
that the initial results were favorable to him, but the military ordered 
the counting to stop as they changed the actual ballots for fraudulent 
ones.[65] However, Grau San Martín, as he had previously done in the 1954 
elections, withdrew his candidacy within a few hours of the election day. 
Batista declared Rivero Agüero the winner. On December 11, 1958, U.S. Ambassador 
Earl Smith visited Batista at his hacienda, Kuquine. There, Smith informed 
him that the United States could no longer support his government. Batista 
asked if he could go to his house in Daytona Beach. The ambassador denied 
the request and suggested that he seek asylum in Spain instead.[citation 
needed] On December 31, 1958, at a New Year's Eve party, Batista told his 
Cabinet and top officials that he was leaving the country. After seven 
years, Batista knew his presidency was over, and he fled the island in 
the early morning.[66] At 3:00 a.m. on January 1, 1959, Batista boarded 
a plane at Camp Columbia with 40 of his supporters and immediate family 
members.[67] and flew to Ciudad Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. A second 
plane flew out of Havana later in the night, carrying ministers, officers, 
and the Governor of Havana. Batista took along a personal fortune of more 
than $300 million that he had amassed through graft and payoffs.[68] Critics 
accused Batista and his supporters of taking as much as $700 million in 
fine art and cash with them as they fled into exile.[69][70] As news of 
the fall of Batista's government spread through Havana, The New York Times 
described jubilant crowds pouring into the streets and automobile horns 
honking. The black and red flag of the July 26 Movement waved on automobiles 
and buildings. The atmosphere was chaotic. On January 8, 1959, Castro and 
his army rolled victoriously into Havana.[71] Already denied entry to the 
United States, Batista sought asylum in Mexico, which also refused him. 
Portugal's dictator António Salazar allowed him to settle there on the 
condition that he completely abstain from politics.[72] By the end of Batista's 
rule, later described by U.S. President Kennedy as "one of the most bloody 
and repressive dictatorships in the long history of Latin American repression",[36] 
many claim that up to 20,000 Cubans had been killed.[73][74][75] Batista 
married Elisa Godínez y Gómez (1900–1993) on July 10, 1926. They had three 
children: Mirta Caridad (1927–2010), Elisa Aleida (born 1933), and Fulgencio 
Rubén Batista Godínez (1933–2007).[76][77] They divorced in October 1945. 
He later married Marta Fernández Miranda (1923–2006)[78] on November 28, 
1945, and they had five children: Jorge Luis (born 1942), Roberto Francisco 
(born 1947), Carlos Manuel (1950–1969),[79] Fulgencio José (born 1953) 
and Marta María Batista Fernández (born 1957). He also had an illegitimate 
daughter, Fermina Lázara Batista Estévez (born 1935).[80] [70] After he 
fled to Portugal, Batista lived in Madeira, then later in Estoril, outside 
Lisbon. He was the Chairman of a Spanish life insurance company that invested 
in property and mortgages on the Andalusian Costa del Sol. He died of a 
heart attack on August 6, 1973, at Guadalmina, near Marbella, Spain,[10] 
two days before, allegedly, a team of assassins from Castro's Cuba were 
to carry out a plan to assassinate him.[20] Marta Fernández Miranda de 
Batista, Batista's widow, died on October 2, 2006.[69] Roberto Batista, 
her son, says that she died at her West Palm Beach home.[70] She had suffered 
from Alzheimer's disease.[70] She was buried with her husband and son in 
Cementerio Sacramental de San Isidro[81] in Madrid, after a Mass in West 
Palm Beach. Batista's resignation as president on New Year's Eve 1958–59 
is reenacted in a pivotal scene in the Academy Award–winning 1974 film 
The Godfather Part II, although the Cuban president is not named. The role 
was played by Tito Alba.[82] Batista was also depicted in the 1979 film
