professional baseball player. He played seven seasons in Major League Baseball 
with the Cleveland Spiders (1896–1899), Detroit Tigers (1901–1903), and

83 at catcher, 65 at first base, 62 at shortstop, 27 at third base, and 
7 at second base. He also pitched in 17 games, including 10 complete games. 
In seven major league seasons, McAllister had a .247 batting average, with

Kid Elberfeld became the first .300 hitters for the Tigers. McAllister 
also was the umpire in a July 15, 1900 minor league game between Cleveland

Burns forfeited the game, but Cleveland manager Jimmy McAleer agreed to 
play using reserve player McAllister as the umpire. Detroit won 6–1.[1]
