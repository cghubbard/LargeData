Gary Nathaniel Matthews Sr. (born July 5, 1950), nicknamed Sarge, is an 
American former left fielder in Major League Baseball. He was a color commentator 
for the Philadelphia Phillies.[1] From 1972 through 1987, Matthews played 
for the San Francisco Giants, Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago 
Cubs and Seattle Mariners. He batted and threw right-handed. He is the 
father of former major leaguer Gary Matthews Jr.[2] The Matthews are one 
of seven father/son combinations in Cubs history; another son, Delvon, 
was a member of Milwaukee's minor league system in 2000–01. Matthews was 
selected in the first round of the June 1968 draft by the San Francisco 
Giants. He began his professional career in 1969 playing for the Giants' 
Decatur Commodores (A) affiliate in Decatur, Illinois. In 1973, his first 
complete season, he won the National League Rookie of the Year award.[3] 
Matthews batted .281 during his 16-season major league career with San 
Francisco (1972–76), Atlanta (1977–80), Philadelphia (1981–83), the Chicago 
Cubs (1984–87) and Seattle (1987). He appeared in 2,033 games and recorded 
2,011 hits, 234 homers and 978 RBI while scoring 1,083 runs. Matthews was 
the National League Rookie of the Year in 1973 after batting .300 with 
12 homers and 58 RBI for the Giants. He had his best overall season with 
the Braves in 1979, going to the All-Star Game during a season in which 
he batted .304 with 27 homers and 90 RBI. Matthews saw postseason action 
with the Phillies in 1981 and 1983. He homered 7 times in 19 playoff games 
and was voted the MVP of the 1983 NLCS after leading the Phillies past 
Los Angeles into the World Series. In the 4-game series, he went 6-for-14 
with three homers and eight RBIs. He was also a key contributor to the 
Cubs' NL Eastern Division title in 1984, batting .291 with 101 runs scored. 
He had been acquired with outfielder Bob Dernier and pitcher Porfi Altamirano 
in a spring training deal with Philadelphia for pitcher Bill Campbell and 
catcher Mike Diaz. In the first game of the 1984 NL Championship Series 
against San Diego, he homered twice. He spent three seasons as a starter 
in left field for the Cubs. Matthews was limited by injuries in 1987 before 
being traded in mid-season to Seattle for minor league pitcher Dave Hartnett. 
In his 16-season career, Matthews batted .281 with 234 home runs and 978 
RBIs in 2033 games. He finished with 183 career stolen bases, 1083 runs 
scored and 319 doubles. He had 2011 hits in 7147 at bats. He also showed 
decent plate discipline, with a lifetime .364 OBP, and a career high of 
.410. His last MLB at-bat was off of Texas Rangers pitcher Mitch Williams. 
Sarge singled, but was picked off in the next at-bat ending the ballgame. 
After retiring as a player following the 1987 season, Matthews worked in 
private industry and broadcasting before joining the Cubs' organization 
in 1995 as minor league hitting coordinator, a position he held for three 
years. He left the Cubs in 1998 to become Toronto's hitting coach; he was 
a member of the Blue Jays' coaching staff for two years, then joined their 
broadcast team for two seasons. Matthews returned to the field in 2002 
as Milwaukee's hitting coach and served as a coach for the Cubs in 2003–06. 
Matthews began his broadcast career as a radio commentator for the Toronto 
Blue Jays (2000–01) and as a studio analyst on Headline Sports Television, 
a Canadian cable network based in Toronto. After concluding his coaching 
career following the 2006 season, Matthews served as a color analyst for 
the Philadelphia Phillies from 2007 to 2013. During his first year in Philadelphia's 
booth, Matthews provided analysis for the entire game alongside Harry Kalas 
and Chris Wheeler (Kalas provided play-by-play for innings 1-3 and 7-9 
while doing the 4th on radio and taking the 5th and 6th off. Wheeler relieved 
Kalas during the middle three innings while doing color analysis with Matthews 
the rest of the game). For the remainder of his Phillies broadcast tenure, 
Matthews provided analysis for only the middle three innings. Following 
Phillies victories from 2008 to 2011, Matthews would also conduct a brief 
on-field interview with a player who made a key contribution in that day's 
game.[4] On January 8, 2014, Matthews and Wheeler were relieved of their 
commentary duties with the Philadelphia Phillies. Both were assigned other 
jobs within the organization. Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs were hired to
