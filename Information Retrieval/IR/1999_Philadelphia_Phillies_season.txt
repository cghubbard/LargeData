The Phillies were early contenders for the Wild Card, going a season-high 
13 games over .500 on August 6 (61–48), but injuries to pitching staff 
ace Curt Schilling and third baseman Scott Rolen, as well as a struggling 
bullpen, proved too tough to overcome. In one particularly bad stretch 
from August 28 to September 14, the Phillies went 1–18. Infielders Coaches
