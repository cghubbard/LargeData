A pennant is a commemorative flag typically used to show support for a 
particular athletic team. Pennants have been historically used in all types 
of athletic levels: high school, collegiate, professional etc. Traditionally, 
pennants were made of felt and fashioned in the official colors of a particular 
team.[citation needed] Often graphics, usually the mascot symbol, as well 
as the team name were displayed on pennants. The images displayed on pennants 
were either stitched on with contrasting colored felt or had screen-printing. 
Today, vintage pennants with rare images or honoring special victories 
have become prized collectibles for sporting enthusiasts. While pennants 
are typically associated with athletic teams, pennants have also been made 
to honor institutions and vacation spots, often acting as souvenirs. In 
Major League Baseball, a pennant typically refers to such a flag flown 
specifically by the National League or American League championship team 
of a given season, or to such a championship itself. The last few weeks 
of the regular American professional baseball season are known as a pennant 
race. This is a holdover from the time (pre-1969) when the league championships 
were determined by the team with the best record at the end of the regular 
season. In Australian sports, the term flag is used in the same context. 
The pennant is waved around in the crowd to show support to the sport team
