Brian Patrick Abraham (born December 20, 1984)[1] is an American professional 
baseball front-office executive and former coach. He was appointed assistant 
director of player development by the Boston Red Sox in November 2014.[2] 
Born and raised in Worcester, Massachusetts,[1] Abraham attended St. John's 
High School in Shrewsbury and the College of the Holy Cross, where he served 
as the catcher for the Holy Cross Crusaders during his first three years 
in college.[3] He considered going to law school when he finished up at 
Holy Cross, as his father, Stephen Abraham, is a lawyer.[4] When he was 
a junior, Abraham had a commercial real estate internship and lived in 
the nearby town of Lexington. He then received an offer to play professional 
baseball in Germany, but the general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays at 
the time, J. P. Ricciardi, made him a substantial offer to join them.[4] 
Ricciardi grew up with Abraham's family, while Brian's uncle, Dave Abraham, 
was a long time trainer with the Blue Jays.[5] Abraham joined the Blue 
Jays in 2007, working for them as advance scouting and video coordinator 
through the 2012 season.[6] Advance video staffs are still relatively new 
to baseball, and Ricciardi wanted the Blue Jays to get out of the Dark 
Ages a little. Then, when Abraham attended spring training in 2007, he 
did not know he would be staying on, so literally he was thrown into the 
fire like anyone is on their first job, and he responded positively in 
all of his or her endeavors. In between, Abraham handled the pitching duties 
for Toronto's slugger José Bautista in the 2012 MLB Home Run Derby.[7] 
Before the 2013 season, Abraham made the jump from Toronto to Boston along 
with manager John Farrell and coach Brian Butterfield.[4] His job often 
involved handling scouting reports for the Red Sox relievers. But he also 
had broader responsibilities as part of a joint process between himself, 
bullpen coach Dana LeVangie, third base coach and infield instructor Butterfield 
and the whole staff.[8] He earned his first World Series ring when Boston 
won the 2013 Championship. Abraham was the Red Sox' MLB bullpen catcher 
during the 2013–2014 seasons. He threw batting practice and assisted the 
coaching staff with video and statistical reports, focusing his interest 
on the relief pitchers.[8] In 2015, he began assisting Boston's director
