Jayson Richard Gowan Werth (born May 20, 1979) is an American professional 
baseball outfielder for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has previously played for the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles 
Dodgers, and Philadelphia Phillies. He bats and throws right-handed. While 
primarily a right fielder throughout his career, Werth has recently been 
moved to left field for the Nationals. Werth was born in Springfield, Illinois, 
the son of Jeff Gowan, a collegiate baseball and football player who broke 
all the receiving records and led all Division I wide receivers in receptions 
while at Illinois State University,[citation needed] and played outfield 
in the St. Louis Cardinals farm system in 1978[1] and Kim Schofield Werth, 
who competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in the long jump and 100 meters. 
He is the grandson of Ducky Schofield and nephew of Dick Schofield, both 
Major League Baseball infielders, and stepson of Dennis Werth, who played 
in parts of four seasons with the Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees 
from 1979 through 1982. Werth is married with two children.[2] Werth was 
successful as a youngster, playing for the top youth traveling teams in 
Springfield, Illinois. His teams began traveling when he was seven and 
dominated the state of Illinois youth baseball with four consecutive state 
championships (never finishing worse than fourth in nationals) in Khoury 
League with the Bunn Brewers. He then played for a national power, the 
Springfield Flame, where his team won the state and Midwest Regional and 
finished third in the 1993 Sandy Koufax World Series in Spring, Texas behind 
Pico Rivera, California and a Dallas, Texas team that included future major 
leaguer Vernon Wells. Werth also was selected to play for the U.S. Junior 
Pan Am Games in 1995. He gained more attention while attending Glenwood 
High School in Chatham, Illinois, where he compiled a .616 [3]batting average 
in his senior year with 15 home runs in 31 games and helped his team to 
the state championship in 1996 (his junior year).[4] Werth initially planned 
on playing college baseball at the University of Georgia,[citation needed] 
but changed his plans when he was drafted in the first round (22nd overall) 
by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. In the 
minor leagues, Werth played catcher and first base, in addition to being 
an outfielder. Prior to making his major-league debut, the Orioles traded 
Werth to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher John Bale. Werth broke into 
the major leagues with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2002. On March 29, 2004, 
Werth was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Jason Frasor after two 
seasons in Toronto. During spring training, on March 2, 2005, Werth was 
hit by a pitch from A. J. Burnett that broke his left wrist. Despite the 
injury, Werth was able to play in 102 games during 2005, hitting .234 with 
seven home runs (compared to 16 the previous year, in fewer at-bats). Eight 
months later, Werth underwent exploratory surgery which revealed two ligament 
tears that were repaired; however, his discomfort never subsided. On May 
21, 2006, Werth had cortisone injected into his wrist; the wrist was placed 
in a cast for three to four weeks. These injuries caused him to miss the 
entire 2006 season. On December 19, 2006, Werth signed a one-year, $850,000 
contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 28, 2007, Werth suffered 
another wrist injury, but returned August 2 against the Chicago Cubs and 
went 3-for-6, with 4 RBI and 1 stolen base. In 2008, Werth began the season 
platooning with Geoff Jenkins in right field, but soon found himself playing 
every day in the early part of the season while regular center fielder 
Shane Victorino was on the disabled list. On May 16, he had a career night 
against the Blue Jays. He hit three home runs in one game, including a 
grand slam, a three-run home run, and a solo shot which put him one round-tripper 
short of hitting for the "homer cycle." He also tied the Phillies team 
record with 8 RBIs in one game.[5] For the season, he led the majors in 
home runs against left-handed pitchers, with 16.[6] On October 29, 2008, 
the Phillies won their second World Series title. Despite being eligible 
for arbitration after the 2008 season, Werth agreed to a two-year contract 
with the Phillies worth $10 million on January 21, 2009.[7] On May 12, 
2009, Werth made a steal of home plate in a bases-loaded situation against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, which came in the seventh inning after previously 
stealing both second and third base. Werth stole four bases in the game, 
leading the team to a 5–3 victory, and again tying a Phillies record.[8] 
On June 27, Werth became the 14th player in Toronto's Rogers Centre history 
to hit a home run into the stadium's 500 level. On July 10, Werth was named 
to the NL All-Star Team as a replacement for New York Mets' outfielder 
Carlos Beltrán. On July 21, in a home game against the Chicago Cubs, Werth 
hit his first career walk-off home run, in the 13th inning against Jeff 
Samardzija, to deliver a 4–1 victory for the Phillies. He led the majors 
in pitches per plate appearance during the 2009 season, with 4.50.[9] In 
Game 5 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Werth hit home 
runs in the first and seventh innings, in a game which the Phillies won 
10–4, clinching the series. Baseball fans voted Werth the 2009 "Unsung 
Star of the Year" in MLB's This Year in Baseball Awards.[10] On December 
5, 2010, Werth signed a seven-year contract with the Washington Nationals 
worth $126 million, the 14th richest contract in baseball history. He was 
introduced to the media on December 15, 2010 with his number 28 jersey.[11] 
Werth had a difficult 2011, highlighted by a June in which he had a .154 
batting average, a .291 on-base percentage, and a .286 slugging percentage. 
On the season, Werth had a .232 batting average, with 20 home runs and 
58 runs batted in.[12] On May 6, 2012, Werth broke his left wrist attempting 
to make a diving catch against his old team, the Philadelphia Phillies. 
The wrist was the same one that had caused him to miss much of the 2005 
season and all of 2006. While the injury was described as a "clean break", 
it was reported that Werth would consult with the same wrist specialist 
who treated him in 2005, to determine whether there was any ligament damage. 
The next day, Werth underwent surgery on the left wrist.[13] After a three-month 
absence for recuperation, Werth returned to the Nationals' lineup on August 
2. Werth batted primarily in the leadoff spot for the first time in his 
career, posting a .309 batting average and .388 OBP in that role.[14] On 
October 11, 2012, Werth, to conclude a 13-pitch at bat, hit a 9th inning 
walk-off home run off Lance Lynn of the St. Louis Cardinals in the bottom 
of the 9th inning to win the game, 2–1, and tie the National League Divisional 
Series at two games apiece.[15] Werth finished the 2012 season with a .300 
batting average, 5 homers, and 31 runs driven in in 81 games. On August 
11, 2013, Werth collected his 1,000th career hit. Werth finished the 2013 
season batting .318 with 25 home runs and 82 RBI. Werth also finished 13th 
in the NL MVP voting. It marked the third time in his career that Werth 
had garnered MVP votes. On April 19, 2016, Werth hit 200th career home 
run in a game against the Miami Marlins.[16] On January 29, 2015, Werth 
pleaded guilty to reckless driving, and was sentenced to five days in jail.[17]
