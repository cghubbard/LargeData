The 1959 Cincinnati Reds season consisted of the Reds finishing in a fifth-place 
tie with the Chicago Cubs in the National League standings, with a record 
of 74–80, 13 games behind the NL and World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Prior to the season the club, after calling themselves the Cincinnati Redlegs 
for the past six seasons, changed its nickname back to the Reds. The Reds 
played their home games at Crosley Field. For the second consecutive season, 
the Reds played under two managers. Mayo Smith managed the Reds to a 35–45 
start. He was replaced in mid-season by Fred Hutchinson, who led the club 
to a 39–35 record the rest of the way. Infielders Other batters Coaches
