A baseball card is a type of trading card relating to baseball, usually 
printed on some type of paper stock or card stock. A card will usually 
feature one or more baseball players or other baseball-related sports figures. 
Cards are most often found in the US but are also common in countries such 
as Canada, Cuba, and Japan, where top-level leagues are present with a 
substantial fan base to support them. Some companies that are notable for 
making these cards include Topps, Upper Deck, and Panini. Previous manufacturers 
include Fleer (now a brand name owned by Upper Deck), Bowman (now a brand 
name owned by Topps), and Donruss (now a brand name owned by Panini Group)[citation 
needed]. Baseball cards can be highly collectible and valuable. While baseball 
cards were first produced in the United States, as the popularity of baseball 
spread to other countries, so too did the production of baseball cards. 
Sets appeared in Japan as early as 1898,[1] in Cuba as early as 1909[2] 
and in Canada as early as 1912.[3] The obverse (front) of the card typically 
displays an image of the player with identifying information, including, 
but not limited to, the player's name and team affiliation. The reverse 
of most modern cards displays statistics and/or biographical information. 
Many early trade cards displayed advertisements for a particular brand 
or company on the back. Tobacco companies were the most instrumental in 
the proliferation of baseball cards, which they used as value added bonuses 
and advertisements for their products.[4] Although the function of trading 
cards had much in common with business cards, the format of baseball cards 
most resembled that of playing cards — at least initially. For an example, 
one need look no further than the design of 1951 Topps Baseball. While 
there are no firm standards that limit the size or shape of a baseball 
card, most cards of today are rectangular, measuring 2½ inches by 3½ inches 
(6.4 cm by 8.9 cm).[5] Since early baseball cards were produced primarily 
as a marketing vehicle, collectors began to classify those cards by the 
'type' of company producing the set. The system implemented by Jefferson 
Burdick in The American Card Catalog has become the de facto standard in 
identifying and organizing trade cards produced in the Americas pre-1951. 
The catalog itself extends into many other areas of collecting beyond the 
sport of baseball. Sets like 1909–1911 White Borders, 1910 Philadelphia 
Caramels, and 1909 Box Tops are most commonly referred to by their ACC 
catalog numbers (T206, E95, and W555, respectively). The rarest baseball 
cards are the ones which are difficult to find and also the most expensive 
ones. The rare type of cards are the oldest baseball cards and those from 
limited edition sets. A rare card generally must be kept in good condition 
in order to be valuable, although the rarest cards can be worth tens of 
thousands of dollars even in poor condition.[6] Price also increases if 
there is an autograph on it. Rare baseball cards or the vintage baseball 
cards do not have a certain price established. Their value is judged upon 
their quality, condition, rarity and upon the number of collectors that 
are seeking them. Vintage baseball cards have been a prime focus of countless 
collectors and historians of one of America's favorite pastimes. Some baseball 
card collectors pay large sums of money to gain possession of these cards 
and they may also put a lot of time into it. Since rare baseball cards 
are difficult to find, collectors seek for ways to be aware of the rare 
cards that come into the trading or selling market. Baseball card collectors 
normally obtain them from other card collectors or from specialized dealers. 
Some collectors may sell rare baseball cards over the internet and very 
often on eBay.[7] Rare baseball cards may also be purchased at major baseball 
card shows. These events are held periodically in different cities, allowing 
baseball card collectors and dealers to meet. The rare baseball cards do 
not have a specific price and they are worth what other collectors are 
willing to pay for, and in order to establish a price, the collector takes 
into consideration the condition of the card. The price of the rare cards 
depends as well on market demands. If there are many collectors who are 
looking to get a specific rare card, the one who gets it is the one who 
pays more for it regardless of its predetermined value.[8] During the mid-19th 
century in the United States, baseball and photography were both gaining 
popularity. As a result, baseball clubs began to pose for group and individual 
pictures, much like members of other clubs and associations posed. Some 
of these photographs were printed onto small cards similar to modern wallet 
photos. As baseball increased in popularity and became a professional sport 
during the late 1860s, trade cards featuring baseball players appeared. 
These were used by a variety of companies to promote their business, even 
if the products being advertised had no connection with baseball. In 1868, 
Peck and Snyder, a sporting goods store in New York, began producing trade 
cards featuring baseball teams.[10] Peck and Snyder sold baseball equipment, 
and the cards were a natural advertising vehicle. The Peck and Snyder cards 
are sometimes considered the first baseball cards. Typically, a trade card 
of the time featured an image on one side and information advertising the 
business on the other. Advances in color printing increased the appeal 
of the cards. As a result, cards began to use photographs, either in black-and-white 
or sepia, or color artwork, which was not necessarily based on photographs. 
Some early baseball cards could be used as part of a game, which might 
be either a conventional card game or a simulated baseball game. By early 
1886, images of baseball players were often included on cigarette cards 
with cigarette packs and other tobacco products. This was partly for promotional 
purposes and partly because the card helped protect the cigarettes from 
damage. By the end of the century, baseball had become so popular that 
production had spread well beyond the Americas and into the Pacific Isles.[1] 
By the turn of the century, most baseball cards were produced by confectionery 
companies and tobacco companies.[11] The first major set of the 20th century 
was issued by the Breisch-Williams Company in 1903.[12] Breisch-Williams 
was a confectionery company based in Oxford, Pennsylvania. Soon after, 
several other companies began to advertise their products with baseball 
cards. This included, but was not limited to, the American Tobacco Company, 
the American Caramel Company, the Imperial Tobacco Company of Canada, and 
Cabañas. a Cuban cigar manufacturer. The American Tobacco Company decided 
to introduce baseball advertising cards into their tobacco products with 
the issue of the T206 White Border Set in 1909.[13] The cards were included 
in packs of cigarettes and produced over a three-year period until the 
ATC was dissolved. The most famous card, and most expensive for the grade, 
is the Honus Wagner from this set. Another famous one, from 1911, is Joe 
Tinker.[6][14] At the same time, many other non-tobacco companies started 
producing and distributing baseball trade cards to the public. Between 
1909 and 1911, The American Caramel Company produced the E90-1 series and 
1911 saw the introduction of the 'Zee Nut' card. These sets were produced 
over a 28-year span by the Collins-McCarthy Company of California. By the 
mid-teens companies such as The Sporting News magazine began sponsoring 
card issues. Caramel companies like Rueckheim Bros. & Eckstein were among 
the first to put 'prizes' in boxes. In 1914, they produced the first of 
two Cracker Jack card issues, which featured players from both major leagues 
as well as players from the short lived Federal League. As the teens drew 
to a close, the Chicago-based Boston Store Department company also issued 
a set. After the end of World War I in 1918, baseball card production lulled 
for a few years as foreign markets were not yet developed and the United 
States' economy was transitioning away from wartime production. This trend 
would continue until the late 1930s when the effects of the Great depression 
finally hit. The twenties produced a second influx of caramel cards, a 
plethora of postcard issues, and a handful of cards from different regions 
of the world. During the first two years, an influx of strip cards hit 
the market. These cards were distributed in long strips and often cut by 
the consumer or the retailer in the store. The American Caramel Company 
re-emerged as a producer of baseball cards and started to distribute sets 
in 1922–1923. Few, if any cards, were produced in the mid-twenties until 
1927 when companies like York Caramel of York, Pennsylvania started producing 
baseball cards. Cards with similar images as the York Caramel set were 
produced in 1928 for four ice cream companies, Yuengling's, Harrington's, 
Sweetman and Tharp's. In 1921, the Exhibit Supply Company of Chicago started 
to release issues on post card stock. Although they are considered a post 
card issue, many of the cards had statistics and other biographical information 
on the back.[15] 1920 saw the emergence of the foreign markets after what 
was essentially an eight-year hiatus. Canadian products found their way 
to the market, including products branded by the Peggy Popcorn and Food 
Products company of Winnipeg, Manitoba from 1920 to 1926, and Willard's 
Chocolate Company from 1923 to 1924. Other Canadian products came from 
ice cream manufacturers in 1925 and 1927, from Holland Creameries and Honey 
Boy, respectively. Billiken Cigars, a.k.a. "Cigarros Billiken", were distributed 
in Cuba from 1923 to 1924. In the early 1930s, production soared, starting 
with the 1932 US Caramel set. The popular 1933 Goudey Gum Co. issue, which 
included cards of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, best identifies this era. In 
contrast to the economical designs common in earlier decades, this card 
set featured bright, hand-colored player photos on the front. Backs provided 
brief biographies and personal information such as height, weight, and 
birthplace. The 240-card set, quite large for the time, included current 
players, former stars, and prominent minor leaguers. Individual cards measured 
2 3/8" by 2 7/8", which Goudey printed on 24-card sheets and distributed 
throughout the year.[16] The bulk of early National Baseball Hall of Fame 
inductees appear in this set. 1933 also saw the delivery of the World Wide 
Gum issue. World Wide Gum Co. was based in Montreal and clearly had a close 
relationship with the Goudey Gum Company, as each of their four issues 
closely resembled a Goudey contemporary. Goudey, National Chicle, Delong 
and a handful of other companies were competitive in the bubble gum and 
baseball card market until World War II began. After 1941, cards would 
not be produced in any significant number until a few years after the end 
of the war. Wartime production transitioned into the post-war civilian 
consumer goods, and in 1948 baseball card production resumed in the US 
with issues by the Bowman Gum and the Leaf Candy Company. At the same time, 
Topps Gum Company issued their Magic Photos set, four years before they 
issued their first "traditional" card set.[17] By 1950, Leaf had bowed 
out of the industry. Japanese baseball cards became more numerous in 1947 
and 1950. The cards were associated with Menko, a Japanese card game. Early 
baseball menko were often round, and were printed on thick cardboard stock 
to facilitate the game.[18] Bowman was the major producer of baseball cards 
from 1948 to 1952. In 1952, Topps began to produce large sets of cards 
as well. The 1952 Topps set is the most sought-after post-World War set 
among collectors because of the scarcity of the Mickey Mantle rookie card, 
the first Mantle card issued by Topps.[19] Although it is not his true 
rookie card (that honor belongs to his 1951 Bowman card), it is still considered 
the ultimate card to own of the post-war era.[20] Topps and Bowman then 
competed for customers and for the rights to any baseball players' likeness. 
Two years later, Leaf stopped producing cards. In 1956, Topps bought out 
Bowman and enjoyed a largely unchallenged position in the US market for 
the next two decades. From 1952–1969, Topps always offered five or six 
card nickel wax packs and in 1952–1964, also offered one card penny packs.[21][22] 
In the 1970s Topps increased the cost of wax packs from 10–15 cents (with 
8–14 cards depending on year) and also offered cello packs (typically around 
18–33 cards) for 25 cents.[23] Rack packs containing 39–54 cards could 
also be had for between 39–59 cents per pack.[24] This did not prevent 
a large number of regional companies from producing successful runs of 
trading cards. Additionally, several US companies attempted to enter into 
the market at a national level. In 1959, Fleer, a gum company, signed Ted 
Williams to an exclusive contract and sold a set of cards featuring him.[25] 
Williams retired in 1960, forcing Fleer to produce a set of Baseball Greats 
cards featuring retired players.[26] Like the Topps cards, they were sold 
with gum. In 1963, Fleer produced a 67 card set of active players (this 
time with a cherry cookie in the packs instead of gum), which was not successful, 
as most players were contractually obligated to appear exclusively in Topps 
trading card products. Post Cereals issued cards on cereal boxes from 1960 
to 1963 and sister company Jell-O issued virtually identical cards on the 
backs of its packaging in 1962 and 1963. In 1965, Topps licensed production 
to Canadian candy maker O-Pee-Chee. The O-Pee-Chee sets were essentially 
identical to the Topps sets until 1969, when the backs of the cards were 
branded O-Pee-Chee. In 1970, due to federal legislation, O-Pee-Chee was 
compelled to add French-language text to the backs of its baseball cards.[27] 
In the 1970s, several companies took advantage of a new licensing scheme, 
not to take on Topps, but to create premiums. Kellogg's began to produce 
3D-cards inserted with cereal and Hostess printed cards on packages of 
its baked goods. In 1976, a company called TCMA, which mainly produced 
minor league baseball cards, produced a set of 630 cards consisting of 
Major League Ball players. The cards were produced under the name the Sports 
Stars Publishing Company, or SSPC. TCMA published a baseball card magazine 
named Collectors Quarterly which it used to advertise its set offering 
it directly via mail order. The cards were available directly from TCMA, 
and were not made available again, like other sets issued by TCMA, due 
to a manufacturers' agreement. Fleer sued Topps in 1975 to break Topps' 
monopoly on baseball cards and won.[28] In 1981, Fleer and Donruss issued 
baseball card sets, both with gum. An appeal of the Fleer lawsuit by Topps 
clarified that Topps' exclusive rights only applied to cards sold with 
gum.[29] After the appeal, Fleer and Donruss continued to produce cards 
issued without gum; Fleer included team logo stickers with their card packs, 
while Donruss introduced "Hall of Fame Diamond Kings" puzzles and included 
three puzzle pieces in each pack. In 1992, Topps' gum and Fleer's logo 
stickers were discontinued, with Donruss discontinuing the puzzle piece 
inserts the following year.[30] With the issuance of a very popular and 
rare (compared to other sets at the time) set in 1984, Donruss began to 
take hold as one of the most popular card brands in competition with Topps. 
In particular, several rookie cards in the 1984 Donruss set are still considered 
the most desirable cards from that year of any brand (especially the Don 
Mattingly rookie card). Also in 1984, two monthly price guides came on 
the scene. Tuff Stuff and Beckett Baseball Card Monthly, published by Dr. 
James Beckett, attempted to track the approximate market value of several 
types of trading cards. More collectors entered the hobby during the 1980s. 
As a result, manufacturers such as Score (which later became Pinnacle Brands) 
and Upper Deck entered the marketplace in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Upper 
Deck introduced several innovative production methods including tamper-proof 
foil packaging, hologram-style logos, and higher quality card stock. This 
style of production allowed Upper Deck to charge a premium for its product, 
becoming the first mainstream baseball card product to have a suggested 
retail price of 99 cents per pack. In 1989, Upper Deck's first set included 
the Ken Griffey, Jr. rookie card. The card became highly sought-after until 
Griffey's persistent injury troubles caused his performance level to decline.[30] 
The other major card companies followed suit and created card brands with 
higher price points. Topps resurrected the Bowman brand name in 1989. Topps 
produced a Stadium Club issue in 1991. 1992 proved to be a breakthrough 
year as far as the price of baseball cards was concerned, with the previous 
50-cents per pack price being replaced by higher price points, overall 
higher-grade cardboard stock, and the widespread introduction of limited 
edition "inserts" across all product lines. 1992 was the beginning of the 
collectors' chase for "gold foil," which was commonly stamped on the limited 
edition "insert" cards. Notable examples from 1992's "insert" craze include 
Donruss Diamond Kings, which included gold-foil accents for the first time 
ever, and Fleer's host of gold foil-accented "insert" cards, including 
All-Stars and Rookie Sensations. 1992 was also the first year that "parallel" 
cards were introduced. In 1992, Topps produced Topps Gold "insert" cards 
of each card in the standard base set. The "parallel" Topps Gold cards 
had the player's name and team stamped in a banner of "gold foil" on the 
card front. The "parallel" moniker became popular to describe these cards 
because each and every card in the standard base set had an accompanying 
"insert" variation. In 1993, the card companies stepped up the "premium" 
card genre with "super premium" card sets, with Fleer debuting its "Flair" 
set and Topps debuting its "Topps Finest" set. Topps Finest was the first 
set to utilize refractors, a technology that utilized a reflective foil 
technology that gave the card a shiny "rainbow" appearance that proved 
extremely popular among hobbyists. Other notable "premium" card sets from 
the 1990s are as follows: Donruss issued its Leaf brand in 1990; Fleer 
followed with Fleer Ultra sets in 1991; and Score issued Pinnacle brand 
cards in 1992.[30] Starting in 1997 with Upper Deck, companies began inserting 
cards with swatches of uniforms and pieces of game-used baseball equipment 
as part of a plan to generate interest. Card companies obtained all manner 
of memorabilia, from uniform jerseys and pants, to bats, gloves, caps, 
and even bases and defunct stadium seats to feed this new hobby demand.[30] 
It is also in 1997 that the first "one-of-one" cards were released by Fleer, 
beginning with the 1997 Flair Showcase "Masterpieces" (the Ultra set would 
begin to include purple 1-of-1 masterpieces the following year). Both kinds 
of inserts remain popular staples in the hobby today. The process and cost 
of multi-tiered printings, monthly set issues, licensing fees, and player-spokesman 
contracts made for a difficult market. Pinnacle Brands folded after 1998. 
Pacific, which acquired full licensing in 1994, ceased production in 2001. 
In 2005, Fleer went bankrupt and was bought out by Upper Deck, and Donruss 
lost the MLB license in 2006 (they also did not produce baseball cards 
in 1999 and 2000). At that time, the MLBPA limited the number of companies 
that would produce baseball cards to offset the glut in product, and to 
consolidate the market.[31] As a result of the measure that included revoking 
the MLB/MLBPA production licenses from Donruss, only two companies remained; 
Topps and Upper Deck.[30] Topps and Upper Deck are the only two companies 
that retained production licenses for baseball cards of major league players. 
In a move to expand their market influence, Upper Deck purchased the Fleer 
brand and the remnants of its production inventory. After purchasing Fleer, 
Upper Deck took over production of the remaining products that were slated 
to be released. Upper Deck continues to issue products with the Fleer name, 
while Topps continues to release Bowman and Bazooka card products. Topps 
is also the only company that continues to produce pre-collated factory 
sets of cards.[30] Card companies are trying to maintain a sizable hobby 
base in a variety of ways. Especially prominent is a focus on transitioning 
the cards to an online market. Both Topps and Upper Deck have issued cards 
that require online registration, while Topps has targeted the investment-minded 
collector with its eTopps offering of cards that are maintained and traded 
at its website.[32] Also, since the late 1990s, hobby retail shops and 
trade-show dealers found their customer base declining, with their buyers 
now having access to more items and better prices on the Internet. As more 
collectors and dealers purchased computers and began trusting the Internet 
as a "safe" venue to buy and sell, the transformation from the traditional 
retail shops and shows to Internet transactions changed the nature of the 
hobby. During the same time period, MLBPA also introduced a new guideline 
for players to attain a rookie card. For years, players had been highlighted 
in previous sets as a rookie while still in the Minor Leagues. Such players 
would sometimes remain in the Minor Leagues for considerable time before 
attaining Major League status, making a player's rookie card released years 
before their first game as a major leaguer. The new guideline requires 
players to be part of the a Major League team roster before a rookie card 
would be released in their name, and a designated "rookie card" logo printed 
on the face of the card. The rookie card logo shows the words "rookie card" 
over a baseball bat and home plate with the Major League Baseball logo 
in the top left corner. Baseball cards garnered national media attention 
again in early 2007, when it was found that Topps' new Derek Jeter card 
had allegedly been altered just prior to final printing. A reported prankster 
inside the company had inserted a photo of Mickey Mantle into the Yankees' 
dugout and another showing a smiling President George W. Bush waving from 
the stands. Topps Spokesman Clay Luraschi later admitted that it was done 
on purpose by the Topps creative department. In February 2007, the hobby's 
most expensive card, a near mint-mint professionally graded and authenticated 
T206 Honus Wagner, was sold to a private collector for $2.35 million.[33] 
The card was sold again later that same year for a record-setting $2.8 
million.[34] In 2012, Topps revolutionized the sports card industry by 
creating the Topps Bunt digital trading card app. The project started off 
slowly, but after gaining Mike Trout as a spokesperson and cross promotion 
with their physical trading cards, the app has gained over 2 million users 
from more than 50 countries across the world.[35] The apps have been an 
enormous success and created a huge following of new fans to the trading 
card world. Along with Topps Bunt, Topps has gone on to create the Topps 
Huddle for digital Football cards, Topps Kick for digital soccer cards 
and the most recent release, Star Wars Card Trader. Baseball cards in the 
United States have gone through numerous changes in everything from production 
and marketing to distribution and use. The earliest cards were targeted 
primarily at adults as they were produced and associated by photographers 
selling services and tobacco companies in order to market their wares. 
By the early 1910s, many cards were issued as part of games and confection 
companies began to distribute their own card sets. The market in the United 
States has been particularly affected by issues both sports and non-sports 
related. Economic effects of World War I, World War II, and the Great Depression 
have all had a major impact on the production of cards. For example, World 
War I suppressed baseball card production to the point where only a handful 
of sets were produced until the economy had transitioned away from wartime 
industrialization. The 1994 players' strike caused a decline in interest 
and industry consolidation. Yet, with the advent and acceptance of third 
party grading companies (c. 1997) bringing greater objectivity in the grading 
of baseball cards (coupled with online marketing), the vintage baseball 
card business has become quite popular again, with sales in the multi-millions 
of dollars recorded every year for at least ten years. Topps' purchase 
of Bowman led to a stranglehold on player contracts. Since Topps had no 
competition and there was no easy way for others to break into the national 
market, the company had a de facto monopoly. However, several regional 
sets featuring players from local teams, both major league and minor league, 
were issued by various companies. Over the years, there was also a great 
deal of resistance from other companies. In 1967, Topps faced an attempt 
to undermine its position from the Major League Baseball Players Association, 
the League's nascent players' union. Struggling to raise funds, the MLBPA 
discovered that it could generate significant income by pooling the publicity 
rights of its members and offering companies a group license to use their 
images on various products. After initially putting players on Coca-Cola 
bottlecaps, the union concluded that the Topps contracts did not pay players 
adequately for their rights. Fleer even filed a complaint with the Federal 
Trade Commission alleging that Topps was engaged in unfair competition 
through its aggregation of exclusive contracts. A hearing examiner ruled 
against Topps in 1965, but the Commission reversed this decision on appeal. 
The Commission concluded that because the contracts only covered the sale 
of cards with gum, competition was still possible by selling cards with 
other small, low-cost products. However, Fleer chose not to pursue such 
options and instead sold its remaining player contracts to Topps for $395,000 
in 1966.[36] Soon after, MLBPA executive director Marvin Miller then approached 
Joel Shorin, the president of Topps, about renegotiating these contracts. 
At this time, Topps had every major league player under contract, generally 
for five years plus renewal options, so Shorin declined. After continued 
discussions went nowhere, before the 1968 season, the union asked its members 
to stop signing renewals on these contracts, and offered Fleer the exclusive 
rights to market cards. Although Fleer declined the proposal, by the end 
of 1973, Topps had agreed to double its payments to each player from $125 
to $250, and also to begin paying players a percentage of Topps' overall 
sales.[37] The figure for individual player contracts has since increased 
to $500. Since then, Topps used individual player contracts as the basis 
for its baseball cards. In April 1975, Fleer asked for Topps to waive its 
exclusive rights and allow Fleer to produce stickers, stamps, or other 
small items featuring active baseball players. Topps refused, and Fleer 
then sued both Topps and the MLBPA to break the Topps monopoly. After several 
years of litigation, the court ordered the union to offer group licenses 
for baseball cards to companies other than Topps. Fleer and another company, 
Donruss, were thus allowed to begin making cards in 1981. Fleer's legal 
victory was overturned after one season, but they continued to manufacture 
cards, substituting stickers with team logos for gum. Donruss distributed 
their cards with a Jigsaw puzzle piece. The history of baseball cards in 
Canada is somewhat similar to that of baseball cards in the United States. 
The first cards were trade cards, then cards issued with tobacco products 
and later candies and gum. World Wide Gum and O-Pee-Chee both produced 
major sets during the 1930s. In 1952, Topps started distributing its American 
made cards in Canada. In 1965 O-Pee-Chee re-entered the baseball card market 
producing a licensed version of the Topps set. From 1970 until the last 
Topps based set was produced in 1992 the cards were bi-lingual French/English 
to comply with Canadian law[38][39] From 1985 until 1988, Donruss issued 
a parallel Canadian set under the Leaf name. The set was basically identical 
to the Donruss issues of the same years however it was bi-lingual. All 
the Leaf sets were produced in the United States. There were several promotional 
issues issued by Canadian firms since Major League Baseball began in Canada 
in 1969. There were also several public safety sets issued, most notably 
the Toronto Blue Jays fire safety sets of the 1980s and early 1990s and 
the Toronto Public Libraries "Reading is fun" set of 1998 and 1999. These 
sets were distributed in the Toronto area. The cards were monolingual and 
only issued in English. The first baseball cards appeared in Japan in the 
late 19th century. Unlike American cards of the same era, the cards utilized 
traditional Japanese pen and ink illustrations. In the 1920s, black-and-white 
photo postcards were issued, but illustrated cards were the norm until 
the 1950s. The 1950s brought about cards which incorporated photos of players, 
mostly in black and white. Menko cards also became popular at the time. 
NPB branded baseball cards are currently widely available in Japanese toy 
stores, convenience stores, sports stores, and as bonus items included 
in certain packages of potato chips. In 1987 and 1988 the American company 
Topps issued two series of American baseball cards featuring cards from 
American and Canadian Major League Baseball teams in the UK. The full colour 
cards were produced by Topps Republic of Ireland subsidiary company and 
contained explanations of baseball terms. Given the baseball's lack of 
popularity in the United Kingdom, the issues were unsuccessful. Topps issued 
licensed sets in Venezuela from 1959 to 1977.[40] Most of the set had Spanish 
in place of the English text on the cards and the sets included winter 
league players. There were locally produced cards depicting players from 
the winter leagues produced by Offset Venezolana C.A., Sport Grafico, and 
others which were in production until the late 1990s. In Cuba, sets were 
issued first in the early 1900s. By the 1930s various candy, gum and chocolate 
makers were offering cards, most notably Baguer Chocolate. The post-World 
War Two era had cards issued by magazines, candy makers, Coca-Cola, and 
of course a gum company. In post revolution Cuba, baseball cards were still 
issued. Several sets of Mexican League baseball cards have been issued 
in the past few years. Australian produced baseball cards were first released 
in 1990 by the then newly created trading card company Futera. These cards 
featured players from the newly created Australian Baseball League. Subsequent 
baseball cards were released annually in boxed sets or foil packs until 
1996 when declining interest saw production cease. No new baseball cards 
were released in Australia until Select Australia released six team sets
