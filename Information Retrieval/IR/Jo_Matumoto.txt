Jo Matumoto (born February 5, 1971 in São Paulo, Brazil) is a Brazilian 
former professional baseball player. He is a left-handed pitcher. Matumoto 
was born in Brazil and is of Japanese descent. He emerged from relative 
baseball obscurity, signed by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2007 as an undrafted 
free agent at the age of 36.[1] Matumoto's wife had contacted agent Randy 
Hendricks as she desperately searched for someone in North America to give 
Matumoto an opportunity.[2] Matumoto did not speak any English at that 
time.[3] He became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season. While playing 
baseball in Japan, Matumoto was part of an "industrial league" team in 
Japanese professional baseball, essentially the Japanese equivalent of 
the Minor League Baseball circuit.[4] He was signed by the Nippon Blue 
Jays[5]—a team unaffiliated with the Toronto Blue Jays, but founded by 
a former Toronto Blue Jays farm team player, fellow Brazilian Jose Pett.[2] 
Matumoto would play in Japan from 1996 until 2001.[4] Matumoto returned 
to Brazil and has seen action playing for their national baseball team 
since 2001 and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in the 2005 South 
American Games when he led Brazil to a victory over Venezuela.[1][2] He 
was considered the ace of the national team.[1][5][6] Matumoto pitches 
with a three-quarters delivery, throwing in the high 80s with a solid slider.
