Louis "Studs" Terkel (May 16, 1912 – October 31, 2008)[1] was an American 
author, historian, actor, and broadcaster. He received the Pulitzer Prize 
for General Non-Fiction in 1985 for "The Good War", and is best remembered 
for his oral histories of common Americans, and for hosting a long-running 
radio show in Chicago. Terkel was born to Samuel Terkel, a Russian Jewish 
tailor, and Anna (Annie) Finkel, a seamstress, in New York City.[2] At 
the age of eight he moved with his family to Chicago, Illinois, where he 
spent most of his life. He had two brothers, Ben (1907–1965) and Meyer 
(1905–1958). From 1926 to 1936, his parents ran a rooming house that also 
served as a meeting place for people from all walks of life. Terkel credited 
his understanding of humanity and social interaction to the tenants and 
visitors who gathered in the lobby there, and the people who congregated 
in nearby Bughouse Square. In 1939, he married Ida Goldberg (1912–1999), 
and the couple had one son. Although he received his law degree from the 
University of Chicago Law School in 1934, he decided instead of practicing 
law, he wanted to be a concierge at a hotel, and he soon joined a theater 
group.[3] A political liberal, Terkel joined the Works Progress Administration's 
Federal Writers' Project, working in radio, doing work that varied from 
voicing soap opera productions and announcing news and sports, to presenting 
shows of recorded music and writing radio scripts and advertisements. His 
well-known radio program, titled The Studs Terkel Program, aired on 98.7 
WFMT Chicago between 1952 and 1997.[4] The one-hour program was broadcast 
each weekday during those forty-five years. On this program, he interviewed 
guests as diverse as Martin Luther King, Leonard Bernstein, Mort Sahl, 
Bob Dylan, Alexander Frey, Dorothy Parker, Tennessee Williams, Jean Shepherd, 
and Big Bill Broonzy. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Terkel was also 
the central character of Studs' Place, an unscripted television drama about 
the owner of a greasy-spoon diner in Chicago through which many famous 
people and interesting characters passed. This show, along with Marlin 
Perkins's Zoo Parade, Garroway at Large and the children's show Kukla, 
Fran, and Ollie, are widely considered canonical examples of the Chicago 
School of Television. Terkel published his first book, Giants of Jazz, 
in 1956. He followed it in 1967 with his first collection of oral histories, 
Division Street America with 70 people talking about effect on the human 
spirit of living in an American metropolis.[5][6][7] He also served as 
a distinguished scholar-in-residence at the Chicago History Museum. He 
appeared in the film Eight Men Out, based on the Black Sox Scandal, in 
which he played newspaper reporter Hugh Fullerton, who tries to uncover 
the White Sox players' plans to throw the 1919 World Series. Terkel found 
it particularly amusing to play this role, as he was a big fan of the Chicago 
White Sox (as well as a vocal critic of major league baseball during the 
1994 baseball strike), and gave a moving congratulatory speech to the White 
Sox organization after their 2005 World Series championship during a television 
interview. Terkel received his nickname while he was acting in a play with 
another person named Louis. To keep the two straight, the director of the 
production gave Terkel the nickname Studs after the fictional character 
about whom Terkel was reading at the time—Studs Lonigan, of James T. Farrell's 
trilogy. Terkel was acclaimed for his efforts to preserve American oral 
history. His 1985 book "The Good War": An Oral History of World War Two, 
which detailed ordinary peoples' accounts of the country's involvement 
in World War II, won the Pulitzer Prize. For Hard Times: An Oral History 
of the Great Depression, Terkel assembled recollections of the Great Depression 
that spanned the socioeconomic spectrum, from Okies, through prison inmates, 
to the wealthy. His 1974 book, Working, in which (as reflected by its subtitle) 
People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They 
Do, also was highly acclaimed. Working was made into a short-lived Broadway 
show of the same title in 1978 and was telecast on PBS in 1982. In 1995, 
he received the Chicago History Museum "Making History Award" for Distinction 
in Journalism and Communications. In 1997, Terkel was elected a member 
of The American Academy of Arts and Letters. Two years later, he received 
the George Polk Career Award in 1999. In 2004, Terkel received the Elijah 
Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from 
Colby College. In August 2005, Terkel underwent successful open-heart surgery. 
At the age of ninety-three, he was one of the oldest people to undergo 
this form of surgery and doctors reported his recovery to be remarkable 
for someone of that advanced age. Terkel smoked two cigars a day until 
2004. On May 22, 2006, Terkel, along with other plaintiffs, including Quentin 
Young, filed a suit in federal district court against AT&T Inc., to stop 
the telecommunications carrier from giving customer telephone records to 
the National Security Agency without a court order.[8] The lawsuit was 
dismissed by Judge Matthew F. Kennelly on July 26, 2006. Judge Kennelly 
cited a "state secrets privilege" designed to protect national security 
from being harmed by lawsuits.[9] In 2006, Terkel received the Dayton Literary 
Peace Prize's first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award.[10] In an interview 
in The Guardian celebrating his 95th birthday, Terkel discussed his own 
"diverse and idiosyncratic taste in music, from Bob Dylan to Alexander 
Frey, Louis Armstrong to Woody Guthrie".[11] Terkel completed a new personal 
memoir entitled, Touch and Go, published in the fall of 2007.[12] Terkel 
was a self-described agnostic,[13] which he jokingly defined as "a cowardly 
atheist" during a 2004 interview with Krista Tippett on American Public 
Media's Speaking of Faith.[14] Movie critic Roger Ebert claimed that Terkel 
was an atheist.[15][16] One of his last interviews was for the documentary 
Soul of a People on Smithsonian Channel. He spoke about his participation 
in the Works Progress Administration. At his last public appearance, in 
2007, Terkel said he was "still in touch—but ready to go".[16] He gave 
one of his last interviews on the BBC Hardtalk program on February 4, 2008.[17] 
He spoke of the imminent election of Barack Obama as President of the United 
States, and offered him some advice, in October 2008.[18] Terkel died in 
his Chicago home on Friday, October 31, 2008 at the age of ninety-six. 
He had been suffering ever since a fall in his home earlier that month.[19] 
In 1998, Terkel and WFMT, the radio station which broadcast Terkel's long-running 
program, had donated approximately 7,000 tape recordings of Terkel's interviews 
and broadcasts to the Chicago History Museum. In 2010, the Museum and the 
Library of Congress announced a multi-year joint collaboration to digitally 
preserve and make available at both institutions these recordings, which 
the Library of Congress called, "a remarkably rich history of the ideas 
and perspectives of both common and influential people living in the second 
half of the 20th century." "For Studs, there was not a voice that should 
not be heard, a story that could not be told," said Gary T. Johnson, Museum 
president. "He believed that everyone had the right to be heard and had 
something important to say. He was there to listen, to chronicle, and to 
make sure their stories are remembered."[23] In 2014 WFMT and the Chicago 
History Museum announced the creation of the website, Studsterkel.org (see 
studsterkel.wfmt.com), which will house the entire archive of Studs Terkel 
interviews. In 1982, Terkel was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters 
from the University of Illinois at Chicago.[24] In 2001, Terkel was inducted 
into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame as a Friend of the Community.[25] 
In 2004, Terkel was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois 
and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State's highest honor) by the Governor 
of Illinois in the area of Communications.[26] In 2006, Terkel received 
the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, the 
first and only annual U.S. literary award recognizing the power of the
