Darryl DeWayne Motley (born January 21, 1960 in Muskogee, Oklahoma) is 
a former Major League Baseball outfielder who played six seasons for the 
Kansas City Royals and Atlanta Braves between 1981 and 1987. In his MLB 
career, Motley played in 413 games, hit 44 home runs, 324 hits, 159 RBIs,

in Japan, 1992 and 1993, for the Chiba Lotte Marines. Motley, a right-handed 
hitting outfielder, hit a 2-run home run for the Royals against the St. 
Louis Cardinals in Game 7 of the 1985 World Series to give Kansas City 
an early 2–0 lead. Motley's home run into the left field bleachers came 
on a 3–2 pitch, after he had hit the preceding 3–2 pitch to the same area 
in the stands, but foul. Motley, upon seeing the ball curve foul, slammed 
his bat into the home-plate area, breaking it.[1] After selecting a new 
bat from the bat-boy, Motley delivered the fatal blow to the Cardinals. 
He also caught Andy Van Slyke's fly ball for the final out of the Series. 
He also played 4 years for the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks of the Northern 
League, from 1996 to 1999. In the team's inaugural season in 1996, Motley 
hit an impressive .346 with 26 home runs and 103 RBI in 82 regular season
