Edward Paul Runge (May 12, 1918 - July 25, 2002) was an American professional 
baseball umpire. He worked in Major League Baseball between 1954 and 1970. 
During his career, he officiated three World Series and five All-Star games. 
He was born in Buffalo, New York and lived in Buffalo, San Diego, California, 
and St. Catharines, Ontario during his childhood. Runge's first professional 
umpiring experience came in the Big State League in Texas in 1947. He was 
promoted to the Pacific Coast League in 1949. He became a Major League 
umpire in 1954, working in the American League. He retired in 1970. After 
his retirement, Runge said of umpiring, "It's the only occupation where 
a man has to be perfect his first day on the job and then improve over 
the years." He was part of the crew that called Don Larsen's perfect game 
in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. As the right field umpire, Runge made 
a critical foul ball call in the fourth inning on a potential home run 
hit by Duke Snider.[1] He also was the home plate umpire for Dave Morehead's 
no-hitter on September 16, 1965.[2] In 1960, Runge testified in court against 
two Washington men who were accused of attempting to extort money from 
Runge and fellow umpire Bill McKinley. After Runge and McKinley entered 
a hotel room with two females, the two men entered the room. The men photographed 
McKinley and Runge in the company of the women and then held the photograph 
for blackmail.[3] He is the father of Paul Runge and grandfather of Brian 
Runge, both of whom became umpires in the Major Leagues. In retirement, 
Runge served as a community liaison and speaker for the San Diego Padres.
