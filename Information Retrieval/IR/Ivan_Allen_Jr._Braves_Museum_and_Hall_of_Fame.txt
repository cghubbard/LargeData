The Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame (BMHF) was founded in 
1999,[1] to honor various players, managers, coaches, executives, and others 
who have been a part of the Atlanta Braves professional-baseball franchise 
during its years in Boston (1871–1952), Milwaukee (1953–1965), and/or Atlanta 
(1966–present).[1] The Museum and Hall of Fame, named after former Atlanta 
mayor Ivan Allen Jr., is located in Turner Field on the northwest side 
at Aisle 134.[1] The Braves Hall of Fame consists of 24 members who contributed 
to the franchise during its 138 seasons, whether they were players, managers, 
broadcasters, or owners. The museum features three "city" exhibits (for 
Boston, Milwaukee, and Atlanta) that each feature items and information 
for the Braves from their times in that respective city. Included in these 
exhibits are "Babe Ruth as a Brave" and the 1914 World Series exhibit from 
Boston, a section of an original Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Car and the 
1957 World Series exhibit from Milwaukee, and Hank Aaron's 715th home run 
exhibit and the 1995 World Series exhibit with replica rings and the Commissioner's 
Trophy from Atlanta. This exhibit features photos of all who played for 
the Braves franchise who are members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
