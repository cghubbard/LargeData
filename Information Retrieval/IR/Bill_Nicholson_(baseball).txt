William Beck "Swish" Nicholson (December 11, 1914 – March 8, 1996) was 
a right fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Philadelphia 
Athletics (1936), Chicago Cubs (1939–1948) and Philadelphia Phillies (1949–1953). 
A native of Chestertown, Maryland, where he attended Washington College, 
he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. In 1944, Nicholson received 
an intentional walk with the bases loaded. He is listed as one of only 
six players in major league history to do it. The others are Abner Dalrymple 
(1881), Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928), Barry Bonds (1998) and 
Josh Hamilton (2008). In a 16-year career, Nicholson posted a .268 batting 
average with 235 home runs and 948 RBI in 1677 games. Nicknamed "Swish" 
because of his mighty swing, which often missed the ball, Nicholson twice 
led the National League in home runs and RBI. He played briefly in the 
American League for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1936, then spent two 
years in the minors before joining the Chicago Cubs in 1939. Nicholson 
became a regular with the Cubs in 1940. His most productive season came 
in 1943, when he hit .309 with a league-leading 29 home runs and 128 RBI. 
He finished 3rd in the NL MVP Award vote behind Stan Musial and Walker 
Cooper. In 1944, Nicholson slipped to .287, but he again led the NL in 
home runs (33), RBI (122) and runs (116). In the same season, after hitting 
four consecutive homers in a July 23 doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, 
he came to bat with the bases loaded in the eighth inning of the second 
game, and was intentionally walked. Obviously, that forced in a run, but 
the Cubs couldn't score again and the Giants won the game, 12–10. This 
time, he lost the MVP honors by one vote to Marty Marion. Although Nicholson 
helped the Cubs to the 1945 pennant, his failing eyesight resulted in a 
slip in production. He hit only .243 with 13 home runs and 88 RBI in the 
regular season, and batted just .214 with eight RBI in Chicago's seven-game 
loss to the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. In 1949, Nicholson was 
traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, where he became a part-time player 
and frequent pinch-hitter. The next season, after he became weak and lost 
weight, it was disclosed that Nicholson was diabetic. He was unable to 
play in the World Series with his "Whiz Kids" teammates against the Yankees. 
Well respected as one of the toughest men to double up, Nicholson hit into 
double plays only once every 90.7 at-bats. He finished his career in 1953 
with eight pinch homers. Bill Nicholson died in Chestertown, Maryland,
