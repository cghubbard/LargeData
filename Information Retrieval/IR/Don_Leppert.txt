Donald George Leppert (born October 19, 1931) is an American former professional 
baseball player and coach. A catcher, he appeared in the Major Leagues 
from 1961–64 for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Senators. Leppert 
threw and batted right-handed; he stood 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and 
weighed 220 pounds (100 kg). During an MLB career of only 3½ years, Leppert 
nonetheless distinguished himself by hitting a home run on the first pitch 
thrown to him in the Majors on June 18, 1961. Then, on April 11, 1963, 
he hit three homers in a game. In the former game, Leppert connected in 
the second inning of his MLB debut against Curt Simmons of the St. Louis 
Cardinals; the blow gave the Pirates a 2–1 lead in a game they would eventually 
win, 5–3.[1] In the latter contest, Leppert's third game in the American 
League, he hit a solo shot off Ike Delock in the fourth inning, then belted 
a three-run blast and another solo homer off relief pitcher Chet Nichols, 
as the Senators humbled the Boston Red Sox, 8–0, at DC Stadium. To top 
it off, Leppert caught Tom Cheney's one-hit shutout, with the Washington 
pitcher striking out ten Red Sox.[2] That season, Leppert was selected 
as a reserve on the American League All-Star team, but he did not play 
in the July 9 game at Cleveland Stadium. In 190 Major League games, Leppert 
collected 122 hits and 15 home runs. After his playing career ended in 
the minors in 1966, Leppert managed in Class A in the Pittsburgh organization 
in 1967. He then embarked upon an 18-year stint as a Major League coach 
for the Pirates (1968–76), Toronto Blue Jays (1977–79) and Houston Astros 
(1980–85). In the late 1980s, he served as field coordinator of minor league 
instruction for the Minnesota Twins and managed in the Twins' farm system. 
He is sometimes confused with Don Eugene Leppert, a second baseman who 
played one year in Major League Baseball with the 1955 Baltimore Orioles.
