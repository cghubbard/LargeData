Jerold Charles Hoffberger (April 7, 1919 – April 9, 1999) was an American 
businessman. He was president of the National Brewing Company from 1946 
to 1973. He was also part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles of the American 
League from 1954 to 1965, and majority owner from 1965 to 1979. Hoffberger 
was a lifelong resident of Baltimore, Maryland. He was the only son of 
his father Samuel, a lawyer who was active in the Democratic Party and 
a major shareholder and board chairman of National Brewing. His grandfather 
Charles had been a local merchant who sold wood, coal and ice. Hoffberger 
attended the University of Virginia. During World War II, he served in 
the United States Army with the 1st Armored Division in Africa, France 
and Italy, where he was wounded near Lake Bracciano, northwest of Rome. 
Jerold Hoffberger was also involved in the Battle of Monte Cassino.[1] 
The year after the war ended, he was appointed president of the brewery 
by his father after the death of his predecessor, Arthur Deute. Under the 
younger Hoffberger's command, National's sales rose from 230,000 barrels 
in 1946 to two million in 1966. In 1953, when the St. Louis Browns of baseball's 
American League wanted to move to Baltimore, the nearby Washington Senators, 
led by Clark Griffith, objected to the potential encroachment on their 
market. Hoffberger helped ease the way for the move by making his National 
Bohemian beer a Senators sponsor.[1] When Browns owner Bill Veeck was all 
but forced to sell the team, Hoffberger and attorney Clarence Miles put 
together a syndicate that bought the team for $2.5 million and moved it 
to Baltimore as the Orioles. Hoffberger was the largest single shareholder 
in the Orioles, but was initially a silent partner with Miles (1954–1955), 
James Keelty (1955–1960) and Joe Iglehart (1960–1965). During this time, 
however, he bought more and more stock until he acquired controlling interest 
in 1965. He immediately brought in Frank Cashen, National's advertising 
director, as executive vice president. Under the direction of Cashen and 
general manager Harry Dalton, the Orioles won four AL pennants and two 
World Series from 1966-71.[1][2] He was a 1996 honoree into the Orioles 
Hall of Fame, inducted with Cal Ripken, Sr. and Billy Hunter. 400 showed 
up at the luncheon at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel.[3] National Brewing 
merged with Canadian brewer Carling in 1975. Hoffberger sold his share 
of the Orioles to Washington, D.C. lawyer Edward Bennett Williams in 1979.[1] 
in the early 1970s, Hoffberger purchased a farm near Woodbine called Sunset 
Hill Farm (formerly Helmore Farm) in Howard County, Maryland where he bred 
Thoroughbred horses for racing. While primarily a breeder, he did race 
horses on his own, notably winning the 1984 Razorback Handicap at Oaklawn
