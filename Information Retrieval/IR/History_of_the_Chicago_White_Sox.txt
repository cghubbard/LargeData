The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball team based on the South 
Side of Chicago. They are one of eight charter members of the American 
League, having played in Chicago since the inaugural 1901 season. They 
have won six American League pennants and three World Series titles, most 
recently in 2005. Despite long periods of mediocrity, the White Sox have 
among the most unusual, challenging, and celebrated histories of any Major 
League franchise. The team began as the minor league Sioux City Cornhuskers 
and played in the Western League. The WL reorganized itself in November 
1893, with Ban Johnson as President. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based reporter, 
had been recommended by his friend Charles Comiskey, former major league 
star with the St. Louis Browns in the 1880s, who was then managing the 
Cincinnati Reds. After the 1894 season, when Comiskey's contract with the 
Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the 
Sioux City team and transferred it to Saint Paul, Minnesota, where it enjoyed 
some success over the next five seasons. In 1900, the Western League changed 
its name to the American League. It was still officially a minor league, 
subject to the governing National Agreement and an underling of the National 
League. The NL gave permission to the AL to put a team in Chicago, provided 
they not use the city name in the team's branding. Comiskey moved his St. 
Paul club to the Near South Side and renamed it the White Stockings, grabbing 
a nickname that had once been used by the Chicago Cubs. The White Stockings 
won the 1900 American League pennant led by player-manager Dick Padden,[1][2] 
the final WL/AL championship season as a minor league.[3] After the season, 
the AL declined to renew its membership in the National Agreement and declared 
itself a major league. After acquiring a number of stars from the older 
league, including pitcher and manager Clark Griffith, the White Stockings 
also captured the AL's first major-league pennant the next year, in 1901. 
Headline editors at the Chicago Tribune sports department immediately began 
shortening the name to "White Sox", and the team officially adopted the 
shorter name in 1904. The name change to the White Sox was brought on after 
scorekeeper Christoph Hynes wrote White Sox at the top of a scorecard rather 
than White Stockings, this scorecard was then seen by the press. The White 
Sox would continue to be built on pitching and defense in the following 
years, led by pitching workhorse Ed Walsh, who routinely pitched over 400 
innings each season in his prime. Walsh, Doc White and Nick Altrock paced 
the White Sox to their 1906 pennant and faced the crosstown rival Cubs 
in the 1906 World Series. The Cubs had won a then-record 116 regular-season 
games and were an overwhelming favorite to defeat the White Sox, especially 
since the White Sox had the lowest team batting average in the American 
League that year. However, in a stunning upset, the White Sox took the 
Series, and intracity bragging rights, in six games. To this day, the 1906 
White Sox are known as "the Hitless Wonders." The White Sox spent the next 
decade alternating between solid and mediocre seasons. During this time, 
however, they acquired a solid core of players such as catcher Ray Schalk, 
shortstop / third baseman Buck Weaver, and pitchers Eddie Cicotte, Red 
Faber and Reb Russell. April 18, 1907, was the coldest Opening Day ever, 
when the temperature was 38 degrees.[4] In 1915, Pants Rowland became the 
manager and the White Sox added outfielder Shoeless Joe Jackson, second 
baseman Eddie Collins and outfielder Happy Felsch to the line-up. The White 
Sox finished in third place with a record of 93–61. In 1916, the White 
Sox acquired pitcher Lefty Williams and finished 2nd at 89–65. In 1917, 
the White Sox put the final pieces of the puzzle together with the addition 
of first baseman Chick Gandil and shortstop Swede Risberg. Weaver was moved 
over to third base. The White Sox roared through the American League in 
1917 with a record of 100–54—still a franchise record for wins and winning 
percentage—and won the pennant by nine games over the Boston Red Sox. Their 
offense, led by Collins (.289, 91 runs), Felsch (.308, 102 RBI) and Jackson 
(.301, 91 runs), was 1st in runs scored. The White Sox pitching staff, 
led by Eddie Cicotte (28–12 1.53 ERA), Williams (17–8 2.97 ERA), Red Faber 
(16–13 1.92 ERA) and Reb Russell (15–5 1.95 ERA), ranked first with a 2.16 
ERA. The White Sox faced the 98–56 New York Giants in the 1917 World Series. 
The White Sox won Game one in Chicago 2–1 behind a complete game by Cicotte. 
Felsch hit a home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. 
The White Sox beat the Giants in Game two by a score of 7–2 behind another 
complete game effort by Faber to take a 2–0 lead in the series. Back in 
New York for Game three, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the White 
Sox could not muster a single run against Giants starter Rube Benton and 
lost 2–0. In Game 4 the White Sox were shut out again 5–0 by Ferdie Schupp. 
Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was going back to Chicago 
even at 2–2. Reb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced 3 batters 
before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the seventth inning, 
Chicago was down 5–2, but they rallied to score three in the 7th and three 
in the 8th to win 8–5. Red Faber pitched the final two innings for the 
win. In Game six, the White Sox took an early 3–0 lead and on the strength 
of another complete game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 
4–2 and clinched the world championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting 
hero, batting .409 over the six game series while Cicotte and Faber combined 
to pitch fifty out of a total fifty two World Series innings to lead the 
staff. After an off-year in the war-shortened season of 1918, the club 
bounced back to win the pennant in 1919 and entered the World Series heavily 
favored to defeat the Cincinnati Reds in a best-of-9. However, just before 
the Series, it became known that some big money was being bet on the Reds, 
fueling talk that the Series was fixed. The White Sox lost to the Reds 
in eight games. Rumors of a fix continued unabated through the 1920 season 
campaign, even as the White Sox roared through the season and appeared 
on their way to a third pennant in four years. The team's pitching was 
particularly strong that year; the 1920 White Sox pitching staff was the 
first in the majors to feature four 20-game winners. In September 1920, 
an investigation into a fixed Cubs game eventually turned in the direction 
of the 1919 Series. During the investigation, Cicotte and Jackson confessed. 
Comiskey, who himself had turned a blind eye to the rumors, was compelled 
to suspend the remaining seven players (Gandil, eventually perceived as 
the ringleader, the one "connected" to the gamblers, had retired after 
the 1919 season) before their last season series against the St. Louis 
Browns. The suspensions ground the team to a halt; they lost two out of 
three games to the Browns and finished second, two games behind the Cleveland 
Indians. However, the evidence of their involvement (signed confessions) 
disappeared from the Cook County courthouse, and lacking that tangible 
evidence, a criminal trial (whose scope was limited to the question of 
defrauding the public) ended in acquittals of all the players. Regardless, 
with the public's trust of the game of baseball at stake, newly installed 
Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned all the accused 
from baseball for life. From 1901 to 1920, the White Sox won five out of 
a possible 19 pennants. However, they were severely crippled by the loss 
of seven of their best players in their prime. With a depleted roster, 
the White Sox dropped into seventh place in 1921 and would not contend 
again until 1936. During that stretch, only the 1925 and 1926 teams even 
managed to top .500. During this period, the White Sox featured stars such 
as third baseman Willie Kamm, shortstop Luke Appling, outfielder Leo Najo 
and pitcher Ted Lyons. However, an outstanding team was never developed 
around them, or a deep pitching staff. Ironically, the White Sox almost 
landed Babe Ruth; they offered to trade Jackson to the Red Sox for Ruth 
after owner Harry Frazee put his troublemaking star on the market. The 
White Sox offered Jackson and $60,000; however, the New York Yankees offered 
an all-cash deal of $100,000. Between the dumping of star players by the 
Philadelphia Athletics and the Red Sox, and the decimation of the White 
Sox, a "power vacuum" was created in the American League, into which the 
Yankees would soon move. The White Sox finally became competitive again 
under popular manager Jimmy Dykes, who led them from 1934 to 1946 – still 
the longest managerial tenure in team history. However, the White Sox did 
not completely recover from their malaise until the team was rebuilt in 
the 1950s under managers Paul Richards, Marty Marion, and Al López. Following 
Charles Comiskey's death in 1931, the team continued to be operated by 
his family – first by his son Louis, then by Louis' widow Grace, and finally 
by their daughter Dorothy Rigney. Not until 1959 did the team pass out 
of the family (thanks in part to a feud between Dorothy and her brother 
Chuck) to a new ownership group, led by Bill Veeck, who had run the Cleveland 
Indians and the St. Louis Browns. During the 1950s, the team had begun 
to restore its respectability with manager Paul Richards utilizing an offensive 
philosophy emphasizing speed and a spectacular style of defense.[5] Perennial 
All-Star Minnie Miñoso, a former Negro Leaguer who became the White Sox' 
first black player in 1951, personified both aspects, leading the league 
in stolen bases while hitting over .300 and providing terrific play in 
left field. The additions of rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio in 1956 and 
manager Al López in 1957 continued the strengthening of the team, joining 
longtime team standouts such as Nellie Fox at second base, pitchers Billy 
Pierce and Virgil Trucks, and catcher Sherm Lollar. The White Sox would 
lead the American League in stolen bases every year from 1951 to 1961. 
Although the White Sox had winning records every season from 1951 through 
1967, the Yankees dynasty of the era often left the White Sox frustrated 
in second place; they were league runner-up five times between 1957 and 
1965. Health problems forced Veeck to sell the team to brothers Arthur 
and John Allyn in 1961, and while the team continued to play well, many 
of the ballpark thrills seemed to be missing. The White Sox had several 
outstanding pitching staffs in the 1960s, with pitchers who had the best 
ERA in four different seasons -- Frank Baumann, 2.67 (1960), Gary Peters, 
2.33 (1963), and again with 1.98 (1966) and finally Joe Horlen, 2.06 (1967). 
In 1959, the team won its first pennant in 40 years, thanks to the efforts 
of several eventual Hall of Famers – Lopez, Aparicio, Fox (the league MVP), 
and pitcher Early Wynn, who won the Cy Young Award at a time when only 
one award was presented for both leagues. The White Sox would also acquire 
slugger Ted Kluszewski, a local area native, from the Pittsburgh Pirates 
for the final pennant push. Kluszewski gave the team a much-needed slugger 
for the stretch run, and he hit nearly .300 for the White Sox in the final 
month. Lopez had also managed the Cleveland Indians to the World Series 
in 1954, making him the only manager to interrupt the New York Yankees 
pennant run between 1949 and 1964 inclusive. After the pennant-clinching 
victory, Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, a lifelong White Sox fan, ordered 
his fire chief to set off the city's air raid sirens. Many Chicagoans became 
fearful and confused since 1959 was the height of the Cold War; however, 
they relaxed somewhat upon realizing it was part of the White Sox' celebration. 
The White Sox won Game 1 of the World Series 11–0 on the strength of Kluszewski's 
two home runs, their last postseason home win until 2005. The Los Angeles 
Dodgers, however, won three of the next four games and captured their first 
World Series championship since moving to the west coast in 1958. 92,706 
fans witnessed Game 5 of the World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 
the most ever to attend a World Series game, or for that matter any non-exhibition 
major league baseball game. The White Sox won that game 1–0 over the Dodgers' 
23-year-old pitcher Sandy Koufax, but the Dodgers clinched the series by 
beating the White Sox 9–3 two days later at Comiskey Park. Due to Veeck's 
arrival in 1959, Comiskey Park instantly became a ballpark filled with 
a series of promotional stunts which helped draw record crowds, the most 
obvious being the exploding fireworks Veeck installed in the scoreboard 
to celebrate home runs and victories. And in 1960, they became the first 
team in the history of sports to wear last names on the back of their jerseys, 
a Veeck innovation. Unlike Charles Comiskey, Veeck was considered a player-friendly 
owner, and players enjoyed playing for him. The 1964 season was especially 
frustrating, as the team won 98 games, four more than 1959, including their 
last nine in a row – yet finished one game behind the pennant-winning Yankees, 
who had a late-season eleven-game win streak that opened up just enough 
room to stave off the White Sox's final charge. The White Sox were also 
involved in one of the closest pennant races in history in 1967. After 
leading the American League for most of the season, on the final weekend, 
the White Sox, Red Sox, Minnesota Twins and Detroit Tigers all had a shot 
at the pennant. However, the Red Sox would assert themselves in the final 
weekend, beating the Twins to take the pennant by a single game. The White 
Sox finished in fourth place at 89–73, three games behind. In 1968, Bud 
Selig, a former minority owner of the Milwaukee Braves who had been unable 
to stop the relocation of his team three years earlier, contracted with 
the Allyn brothers to host nine home games (one against each of the other 
American League clubs) at Milwaukee County Stadium as part of an attempt 
to attract an expansion franchise to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The experiment 
was staggeringly successful — those nine games drew 264,297 fans. In Chicago 
that season, the White Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home 
dates (72 games, 14 doubleheaders). In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee 
crowds accounted for nearly one-third of the total attendance at White 
Sox games. In 1969, the league expanded from 10 teams to 12, and the White 
Sox schedule in Milwaukee was likewise expanded to include 11 home games 
(again, one against every opponent). Although those games were attended 
by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented 
a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous 
year — over one-third of the fans who went to White Sox games did so at 
Milwaukee County Stadium. In the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago (70 
games, 11 doubleheaders), the White Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 
6,632 per date. Selig was denied an expansion franchise at the 1968 owners' 
meetings, and turned his efforts toward purchasing and relocating an existing 
club. His search began close to home with the White Sox themselves. According 
to Selig, he had a handshake agreement with Arthur Allyn in early 1969 
to purchase a majority stake in the White Sox and move them north to Milwaukee. 
The American League, however, blocked the sale, unwilling to cede what 
was then the nation's second largest city to the National League and the 
Cubs. Arthur Allyn instead sold his shares to his brother John, who agreed 
to stay in Chicago. Selig would go on to buy the Seattle Pilots and move 
them to Milwaukee instead. John Allyn renamed Comiskey Park "White Sox 
Park" and installed artificial turf ("Sox Sod") in the infield (the outfield 
remained natural grass). The 1970 White Sox hit rock bottom for the franchise 
in the post-World War II era, going a Major League worst 56-106, nine games 
worse than the second-year Milwaukee Brewers, and seven worse than another 
1969 expansion team, the San Diego Padres. The White Sox had a brief resurgence 
in 1972, with slugger Dick Allen winning the MVP award; but injuries, especially 
to popular third baseman Bill Melton, took their toll and the team finished 
5½ games behind Oakland, the eventual world champion. Several lawsuits 
against Major League Baseball from Seattle over the move of the Pilots 
to Milwaukee almost resulted in the White Sox being moved to the Emerald 
City in 1975. An elaborate scheme for a franchise shuffle soon came to 
light. The White Sox were to be moved to Seattle, then the Oakland Athletics 
were to take the White Sox's place in Comiskey Park. Oakland owner Charlie 
Finley was from nearby La Porte, Indiana. His A's had not drawn well during 
their Championship years in Oakland, California, and he wanted to bring 
them to Chicago.[citation needed] However, the shuffle collapsed when owner 
John Allyn sold the team to the physically rehabilitated Bill Veeck. In 
1977, the Seattle Mariners were created, thus restoring the major leagues' 
presence in the Pacific Northwest. On December 10, 1975, Bill Veeck regained 
ownership of the team, and he vowed to make the White Sox an exciting team 
again. Besides his customary promotions, Veeck introduced retro uniforms 
and shorts. The shorts were only worn three times. The first time was during 
the initial game of a doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals at Comiskey 
Park on August 8, 1976, followed by appearances on August 21 and August 
22.[6] The 1976 team was one of the worst White Sox teams ever, winning 
only 64 games (.398), drawing fewer than 915,000 fans. Veeck's strategy 
to make the team competitive quickly, dubbed "rent-a-player" by sports 
writers, involved acquiring star players entering the final year of their 
contracts. The theory was that the players would strive to put up huge 
numbers in hopes of getting a big contract at the end of the season, and 
carry the club with them. The first of these acquisitions was made prior 
to the 1977 season and the last prior to the 1978 season. While this approach 
had the virtue of not having been tried, it was unsustainable. The Sox 
had to give up several young prospects in exchange for veteran players 
who invariably signed with other clubs after their single season in Chicago. 
During this period the Sox acquired several players who were once stars 
but were past their primes. One was Don Kessinger, a shortstop who had 
his best years with the crosstown Cubs. Kessinger served as a player-manager 
in 1979. Another was outfielder Ralph Garr, who had his best seasons with 
the Atlanta Braves. A once-notable pitcher was John "Blue Moon" Odom, a 
former Oakland Athletics star. On July 28, 1976, Odom combined with Francisco 
Barrios on a no-hitter against Oakland, which proved to be Odom's last 
major league victory. The Sox also brought in Clay Carroll, a right-handed 
relief pitcher who was a key member of the Cincinnati Reds championship 
teams in the mid-1970s. Since the Sox didn't have the revenue of the wealthier 
clubs, Veeck looked for any edge he could find. The club held open tryouts 
during spring training in 1978. They looked at pretty much anyone who showed 
up. Each player's name was sewn on his uniform, ostensibly to prove that 
the tryouts were legitimate and not just a stunt. This approach was the 
subject of an article in Sports Illustrated. The spring training tryout 
became a White Sox tradition that continues to this day.[7] The 1977 season 
was a memorable one for the South Siders, led by off-season acquisitions 
Oscar Gamble (.297 AVG, 31 HR, 83 RBI), Richie Zisk (.290 AVG, 30 HR, 101 
RBI) and American League Comeback Player of the Year Eric Soderholm (.280 
AVG, 25 HR, 67 RBI). The team, known by the press and fans as the "South 
Side Hitmen" hit a since-broken team record 192 home runs and were in first 
place in the American League West as late as August en route to a third-place 
finish (90–72). They also drew a team-record 1,657,135 fans to Comiskey 
(since broken as well). Manager Bob Lemon was named AL Manager of the Year 
by UPI for his efforts.[8] After the 1977 season Gamble and Zisk signed 
with other teams — Gamble with the San Diego Padres and Zisk with the Texas 
Rangers. Veeck's attempt to replace them with Bobby Bonds and Ron Blomberg 
fizzled as the 1978 team lost 90 games. Bonds appeared in only 26 games 
for the Sox before being dealt to the Texas Rangers, and Blomberg's major 
league career ended with the season's final game. Two tough years followed: 
87 losses in 1979 (including the infamous July 12 forfeit on Disco Demolition 
Night) and 90 losses in 1980. Veeck began building a farm system that produced 
several noteworthy players including Harold Baines and Britt Burns. But 
Veeck could not compete in the free agent market or afford what he called 
"the high price of mediocrity." By 1980, the White Sox were looking for 
new ownership. Veeck favored Ohio real estate tycoon Edward J. DeBartolo, 
Sr., whose family owned the NFL's San Francisco 49ers and the NHL's Pittsburgh 
Penguins and had tried to buy several MLB teams and move them to New Orleans. 
DeBartolo pleaded to be allowed to buy the White Sox and he promised to 
keep the team in Chicago. Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn blocked the 
deal, because he thought DeBartolo would be bad for baseball. Instead, 
Veeck sold the team to an ownership group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and 
Eddie Einhorn. The new owners moved quickly to show that they were committed 
to winning by signing All-Star catcher Carlton Fisk from the Red Sox as 
well as power-hitting outfielder Greg Luzinski from the defending champion 
Phillies during the 1980–81 offseason. They also retained the club's young, 
relatively unknown manager Tony La Russa. In 1983, the White Sox enjoyed 
their best success in a generation. After a mediocre first half, the White 
Sox decided that they needed speed at the top of the lineup. The Sox traded 
second baseman Tony Bernazard to the Mariners for Julio Cruz. With Cruz's 
speed, they went 60–25 to close out the season, clinching the AL West title, 
which earned Manager Tony La Russa his first Manager of the Year award. 
Doug Rader, then-manager of the Texas Rangers, derisively accused the team 
of "winning ugly" for their style of play, which reflected a tendency to 
win games through scrappy play rather than strong hitting or pitching. 
Rader also thought that if the White Sox played in the Eastern Division, 
they would finish fifth behind powerhouses such as Baltimore, New York, 
and Milwaukee. Chicago media and White Sox fans picked up on the phrase, 
and turned "Winning Ugly" into the team slogan. While they had a great 
run in the regular season, they were not able to carry that over into the 
postseason as they lost to a powerful Baltimore Orioles team three games 
to one in the AL Championship Series. LaMarr Hoyt led the White Sox to 
a 2–1 victory in Game 1, but the Orioles clinched the series with a 3–0 
ten-inning victory in Game 4. White Sox pitcher Burns pitched a "gutsy" 
game, throwing 9⅓ shutout innings before a home run by Tito Landrum broke 
up the game and the hearts of the South Side faithful. The club slid back 
into mediocrity for the rest of the 1980s, contending only in 1985. Before 
the 1985 season began, the White Sox traded pitcher LaMarr Hoyt to the 
San Diego Padres in exchange for flashy shortstop Ozzie Guillén. Guillen 
would win the AL Rookie of the Year award. In 1986, broadcaster-turned-general 
manager Ken "Hawk" Harrelson fired La Russa after a poor start. The club 
wouldn't contend again until 1990, the final year in Comiskey Park. That 
season, most of their young talent blossomed. Closer Bobby Thigpen established 
a then record of 57 saves. In addition to that, first baseman Frank Thomas, 
pitchers Alex Fernandez and Jack McDowell, and third baseman Robin Ventura 
would make their presences felt on the South Side. The White Sox of 1990 
won 94 games, but finished 9 games behind the powerful Oakland Athletics. 
On July 11, as part of the celebration of Comiskey Park, the White Sox 
played a Turn Back the Clock game against the Milwaukee Brewers; the Brewers 
won 12–9 in 13 innings after posting a 6-run rally in the 8th inning to 
tie the game. The White Sox wore their 1917 home uniforms. This was the 
first Turn Back the Clock game in the major leagues and started what has 
become a popular promotion. New Comiskey Park opened in 1991, and was completed 
at a cost of $167 million. The team reached the ALCS in 1993. The White 
Sox were led by Thomas, Ventura, multi-sport star Bo Jackson, Cy Young 
Award winner McDowell and All-Star closer Roberto Hernández and won the 
last AL West before realignment with a 94–68 record. However, the White 
Sox were a big disappointment in the ALCS, losing to the defending World 
Champion Toronto Blue Jays in six games. The Jays would go on to win the 
World Series again in 1993. The White Sox led the new American League Central 
at the time of the 1994 players' strike. Under Manager Jerry Manuel, the 
White Sox fielded a talented but chronically under-achieving team. In 2000, 
however, the White Sox had one of their best teams since the 1983 club. 
This team, whose slogan was "The Kids Can Play", won 95 games en route 
to an AL Central division title. The team scored runs at a blistering pace, 
which enabled them to overcome the effects of a mediocre pitching staff, 
led by Mike Sirotka and James Baldwin. Frank Thomas nearly won his third 
MVP award with his offensive output; he was helped by good offensive years 
from Magglio Ordóñez, Paul Konerko, Carlos Lee and José Valentín. As in 
1983 and 1993, the 2000 team could not carry its success over into the 
postseason, getting swept by the wild-card Seattle Mariners in the Division 
Series. Despite new club records for hits (1,615), runs scored (978), RBI 
(926), home runs (216), and doubles (325), the White Sox hit only .185 
in the ALDS and failed to score a run after the third inning in any of 
the three games. In 2003, Comiskey Park was renamed after cell phone company 
U.S. Cellular bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years, a 
very unpopular move among fans. In 2003 The All Star game was held for 
the first time at their new park. The changes made an immediate impact 
on the team. In 2005, the White Sox posted the best record in the major 
leagues for much of the year, before a late season slump saw the St. Louis 
Cardinals overtake them (100 wins vs. 99 wins). Though a serious challenge 
for their dominance of the division was mounted late in the year by the 
Cleveland Indians (the Tribe actually reduced what was once a 15-game lead 
for the White Sox down to 1½ games at one point only to lose the last 7 
games), Chicago scored a 4–2 victory over the Detroit Tigers on September 
29 to win their first AL Central Division title since 2000. Finishing at 
99–63 (.611) tied their 1983 record, and won the division by six games. 
The last time they had a higher percentage than that was 1920, when they 
finished second in the league thanks to the late-season "Black Sox" suspensions. 
The combination of the league's best record with the American League victory 
in the All-Star Game gave the White Sox the home field advantage throughout 
the 2005 postseason (perhaps unnecessary as the White Sox won every post-season 
road game they played in 2005). In the 2005 American League Division Series, 
the White Sox took on the Boston Red Sox, the 2005 AL wild-card winners 
and the defending World Series champions. The White Sox defeated the Red 
Sox in a three-game sweep. They won the first two games (scoring a 14–2 
victory in the first game – their first postseason win at home since 1959 – 
and 5–4 in the second) of the series at home before claiming a 5–3 victory 
at Fenway Park in Boston. Scott Podsednik hit his first home run of the 
season in the first game of the series. The ALDS also set the tone for 
what would be an unusually suspenseful post-season; while their first game 
was considered a blow-out, the remaining games saw the White Sox making 
the most of rare opportunities and hanging on to narrow leads. In the first 
inning of game 1, the White Sox put up 5 runs, and never looked back. A 
late inning three-run home run by Scott Podsednik – his first home run 
of the season, was the icing on the cake in the game 1 blowout. In Game 
2, the White Sox were actually down 4–2 when Red Sox second baseman Tony 
Graffanino, formerly playing for the White Sox, let Juan Uribe's potential 
inning-ending, double-play grounder go through his legs; one out later, 
Tadahito Iguchi hit a three-run homer to left that clinched the game for 
the White Sox. In Game 3, Orlando Hernández entered the game with the bases 
loaded and nobody out with the White Sox ahead by only one run in the bottom 
of the sixth inning. Based on their regular season performance, it was 
later calculated that the Red Sox's probability of winning at that point 
was .662, even though they were trailing by one run. Instead, the first 
two batters, Jason Varitek and Tony Graffanino, both popped out, and Johnny 
Damon struck out swinging on a breaking ball. Hernandez went on to retire 
six of the next seven batters, and the White Sox's rookie reliever Bobby 
Jenks closed out the game. The White Sox then moved on to face the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALCS. The Angels won Game 1, 3–2, The 
White Sox only post-season loss. In Game 2 on October 12, the teams were 
involved in one of the most controversial endings in baseball playoff history. 
With the score tied 1–1 with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, A. J. 
Pierzynski apparently struck out to end the inning. At first Pierzynski 
headed back to the dugout but ran to first base upon realizing that umpire 
Doug Eddings had ruled that Angels catcher Josh Paul (a former White Sox 
player) did not field the ball cleanly, meaning he would have to either 
tag the batter or throw to the first baseman to record the out (see uncaught 
third strike). Despite vehement protests from various members of the Angels, 
including manager Mike Scioscia, Pierzynski was awarded first base. Pinch-runner 
Pablo Ozuna replaced Pierzynski and stole second base. Third baseman Joe 
Crede then delivered a double on the third pitch to give the White Sox 
a 2–1 win. Overshadowed by that play was the 1-run, 5-hit complete game 
pitched by Mark Buehrle. Buehrle's excellent effort allowed the White Sox 
to capture their first-ever home victory in ALCS history. Buoyed by their 
win, the White Sox traveled to Anaheim, California, where starters Jon 
Garland, Freddy García, and José Contreras (who had dropped Game 1 to the 
Angels in Chicago) pitched three more complete game victories consecutively 
over the Angels, giving the White Sox their first American League pennant 
since 1959. White Sox slugger Paul Konerko was named the ALCS MVP, on the 
strength of his two home runs, 7 RBI, and .286 average. Especially in light 
of the evolution of the game, the White Sox four straight complete games 
was considered an unbelievable achievement. In fact, since José Contreras 
pitched 8⅓ innings in game 1, the White Sox bullpen saw a total of ⅔ of 
an inning pitched (by Neal Cotts) in the entire series. The last time four 
consecutive complete games had been pitched in a championship series was 
in the 1956 World Series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees, 
and the 1928 Yankees were the last team to win four consecutive complete 
games in a championship series. In fact, the last time any major league 
pitching staff had hurled four straight complete game victories was near 
the end of the 1983 regular season, when the Texas Rangers accomplished 
the feat. The White Sox now advanced to the World Series, where they would 
take on the National League champion Houston Astros. The White Sox' appearance 
in the World Series was bittersweet for longtime franchise star Frank Thomas. 
One of the most popular and productive players in the franchise's long 
history, Thomas would finally be going to a World Series in his 16th major 
league season. However, due to injury, Thomas would be unable to participate 
except as an observer, and his contributions to the White Sox in 2005 were 
limited. Game 1 saw Astros' ace Roger Clemens leave the game with a hamstring 
injury, leaving José Contreras to finish up the Astros and Chicago took 
advantage of its opponents' weakness, winning 5–3. Joe Crede especially 
made an impressive showing with his stellar defensive plays at third base. 
Game 2 of the Series, as in the ALCS, saw the White Sox again involved 
in a controversial play. With the White Sox down 4–2 in the seventh with 
two outs and two runners on base, the home plate umpire ruled that Jermaine 
Dye had been hit by a pitch, while the Astros argued (and TV replays confirmed) 
that the ball had actually hit the bat. Dye was given a free pass to first, 
and the next batter, Paul Konerko, launched a grand slam into left field 
to give Chicago a 6–4 lead. Houston tied the game on a two-run single with 
two outs in the top of the ninth, but in the bottom of the ninth, Scott 
Podsednik hit a walk-off solo home run off Brad Lidge to give the White 
Sox a thrilling 7–6 victory and a 2–0 lead in the Series. Podsednik was 
the first player in major league history to hit a home run in the World 
Series after not having hit any during the regular season. (He did, however, 
have a home run in Game 1 of the ALDS against Boston, making the World 
Series home run his second of the playoffs.) The World Series then shifted 
to Houston for Game 3, in which Astros' starter and NLCS MVP Roy Oswalt 
cruised with a 4–0 lead until the wheels totally came off for him with 
a five-run fifth by the White Sox. The Astros managed to tie the game in 
the eighth, but repeatedly blew scoring opportunities in the next few innings. 
Finally, in the top of the 14th, former Astro Geoff Blum hit a tie-breaking 
home run; the White Sox took a commanding 3–0 Series lead with a 7–5 victory 
in the longest World Series game in history (in terms of time; tied for 
most innings). Ozzie Guillén sent Mark Buehrle in to get the last out in 
the bottom of the 14th to get the save after he had started Game 2, and 
later remarked that he was set to send Pablo Ozuna (a position player) 
in to pitch if the Astros somehow extended the game. Game 4 was a pitcher's 
duel between Freddy García and Brandon Backe. The game was scoreless until 
Jermaine Dye singled to center off of Brad Lidge, driving in Willie Harris 
for what turned out to be the winning run. This was the second game of 
the series in which Lidge had given up the game-winning run (Podesednik's 
home run in Game 2). Game 4 also saw a spectacular defensive play by Juan 
Uribe, as the Chicago shortstop fell two rows into the stands in order 
to retire Chris Burke for the second out in the bottom of the ninth. Uribe 
also earned the assist in the final out of the Series on the next play, 
as he narrowly threw Orlando Palmeiro out at first to give the White Sox 
their first World Series crown since 1917. A grounder up the middle, past 
Jenks, Uribe has it, he throws- OUT! OUT! A WHITE SOX WINNER! AND A WORLD 
CHAMPIONSHIP! Dye was named the World Series MVP in the four-game sweep. 
Only the 1927 Yankees and the 1984 Detroit Tigers were able to achieve 
such a feat. Their 11–1 postseason record was tied with 1999 Yankees as 
the best single post season mark. (Only Cincinnati Reds in 1976 had a better 
winning percentage by going 7–0.) Also, their 8-game winning streak (the 
four wins over the Angels and the sweep against the Astros) is tied with 
the Boston Red Sox (who won 8 games in a row en route to their 2004 World 
Series championship) for the longest postseason winning streak in Major 
League history. The White Sox also became the first team to win all three 
post-season victories on the road. Amazingly, despite their 105-year history, 
this was only the franchise's third World Series championship, (following 
victories in 1917 and 1906). It also marked their first pennant since the 
advent of divisional play in 1969 (the White Sox won the inaugural American 
League pennant in 1901, but this was 2 years prior to the first modern 
World Series). After leading the wild card race for much of the season, 
the White Sox faltered, losing 15 of 24 at the beginning of September to 
eliminate them from playoff contention, ending their chances of becoming 
the first repeat winner of the World Series since the New York Yankees 
in 1999 and 2000. They nonetheless finished with a 90–72 record, the season's 
best record by a non-playoff team. This was the first year a White Sox 
manager had led the AL All-Star squad since 1994, when Gene Lamont led 
the team. In addition to manager Ozzie Guillén, the White Sox had six representatives 
at the 77th All-Star Game at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, the most among any 
club: starting pitcher Mark Buehrle, closer Bobby Jenks, catcher A. J. 
Pierzynski, first basemen Paul Konerko and Jim Thome, and right fielder 
Jermaine Dye. José Contreras was originally selected to pitch in the All-Star 
Game, but was replaced by Francisco Liriano. Guillen removed Contreras 
from the roster after a 117-pitch performance in a 19-inning game against 
Boston on the last day before the All-Star Break. Pierzynski was the last 
White Sox to be named to the team after winning the year's Final Vote, 
in which the fans select the 32nd and final player on both the AL and NL 
squads. Pierzynski is the second White Sox to be selected, following Scott 
Podsednik's nomination in 2005. Dye competed in the 2006 CENTURY 21 Home 
Run Derby; he managed to hit 7 home runs in the first round, but David 
Ortiz and Ryan Howard both surpassed that total to knock Dye out of the 
competition. The White Sox drew 2,957,414 fans for an average of 36,511, 
third in the AL. There were a total of 52 sellouts, breaking the previous 
team record of 18. The White Sox also drew 75 crowds in excess of 30,000, 
another franchise record. On April 18, Buehrle pitched a no-hitter against 
the Texas Rangers, 6–0. Buehrle's only blemish was a walk to Sammy Sosa 
in the fifth, but Buehrle would promptly pick Sosa off during the next 
at-bat. Buehrle secured his spot in the MLB record books when he forced 
Rangers catcher Gerald Laird to ground out to third baseman Joe Crede at 
9:14 P.M. CDT, sending the crowd of 25,390 at U.S. Cellular Field into 
a frenzy. He would face the minimum of 27 batters using 106 pitches (66 
strikes), with the one walk to Sosa and eight strikeouts. Jermaine Dye 
hit a grand slam and Jim Thome added two solo homers in the history-making 
night. On July 6, the White Sox announced the signing of Mark Buehrle to 
a contract extension worth $56 million over four years. The move came after 
weeks of rumors of Buehrle possibly being traded. Overall, the White Sox 
season was hampered by injuries and a team-wide hitting slump. However, 
the season was not a complete failure with Mark Buehrle's no hitter, Jim 
Thome's 500th home run, and closer Bobby Jenks 41 consecutive batters retired 
(tying Jim Barr's all-time record and breaking the American League record.) 
Jenks would later fall short of the all-time record when Kansas City Royal's 
player Joey Gathright slapped a ground ball into left field just out of 
the reaches of third baseman Josh Fields and shortstop Juan Uribe. The 
White Sox finished the season fourth in their division with a 72–90 record, 
behind the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, and Minnesota Twins. On July 
31, the day of the trade deadline, the White Sox traded relief pitcher 
Nick Masset and minor leaguer 2nd Baseman Danny Richar for Ken Griffey, 
Jr. of the Cincinnati Reds.[9] On August 14, Jim Thome, Paul Konerko, Alexei 
Ramírez, and Juan Uribe combined to hit four consecutive home runs, something 
that has only been done six other times in the history of Major League 
Baseball. On September 29, 2008, Ramirez hit his fourth grand slam of the 
season, setting a major-league single-season record for a rookie, off of 
Detroit Tigers pitcher Gary Glover in an 8–2 White Sox victory to qualify 
the White Sox for a one-game playoff against the Minnesota Twins for the 
AL Central title. This also broke the team record for most grand slams 
in a single season. On September 30, 2008, the White Sox won a tiebreaker 
1–0 against the Minnesota Twins for the American League playoff spot after 
a diving catch from Brian Anderson. A game saving throw to home plate from 
center-fielder Ken Griffey Jr. to catcher A. J. Pierzynski on a flyout 
to keep Michael Cuddyer from scoring would keep the Twins scoreless through 
the top of the 5th inning. John Danks pitched on only three days rest and 
threw 103 pitches for 2 hits and no runs in eight innings. Bobby Jenks 
would close the game with a perfect 9th. The only run of the game came 
from a Jim Thome home run, the 541st of his career. This was the lowest 
scoring tiebreaker game in MLB history. The White Sox are also the only 
team in MLB history to beat three different teams on three consecutive 
days: the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, and Minnesota Twins. They 
lost to the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALDS, 3 games to 1. During the 2009 offseason 
the White Sox declined a team option for Ken Griffey, Jr.. The White Sox 
also let Joe Crede become a free agent, who went on to sign with the Minnesota 
Twins, and signed closer Bobby Jenks to a one-year contract, avoiding arbitration.[10] 
Pitcher Bartolo Colón was signed as a free agent on January 15.[10] Javier 
Vázquez and Boone Logan were traded to the Atlanta Braves for prospects 
Tyler Flowers, Brent Lillibridge, Jon Gilmore and Santos Rodriguez.[11] 
On June 4, the White Sox called up 2008 number one draft pick (eighth overall), 
shortstop Gordon Beckham.[12] It took Beckham only 364 days to reach the 
Major Leagues, as he was drafted on June 5, 2008.[13] On June 9, the White 
Sox called up another number one draft pick (2007, 25th overall), left-handed 
pitcher Aaron Poreda.[12] On July 23, White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle threw 
a perfect game against the Tampa Bay Rays. It was his second career no-hitter, 
both with the White Sox, and the second perfect game in team history. After 
the game, Buehrle was in the middle of his press conference with the media 
when he received a phone call from President Barack Obama to congratulate 
him. It was the second time in two weeks that President Obama and Buehrle 
had contact, with the first being at the 2009 All-Star game in St. Louis, 
Missouri. On July 28 Mark Buehrle established a new major league baseball 
record, by retiring Minnesota Twin (And former teammate) Joe Crede, Buehrle 
retired his 42nd consecutive batter, breaking the record held by teammate 
Bobby Jenks, and Jim Barr, Buehrle would retire three more batters. He 
holds the all-time record now at 45. On July 31, the White Sox traded 2007 
number one draft pick (twenty fifth overall), pitcher Aaron Poreda, Clayton 
Richard, Adam Russell and Dexter Carter in exchange for Jake Peavy. On 
August 10, the White Sox claimed OF Alex Ríos off waivers from the Toronto 
Blue Jays On August 31, Jim Thome waived his no-trade clause, allowing 
the White Sox to trade him to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and pick up center 
fielder Justin Fuller. The White Sox also trade José Contreras to the Colorado 
Rockies, in exchange for Brandon Hynick, a 24-year-old right-handed starter. 
On the Opening Day, the White Sox shutout the Cleveland 6–0. On that day, 
Mark Buehrle made an astounding play when he hurried and picked up a ball 
with his glove in foul territory and quickly underthrew backwards with 
his glove to Paul Konerko, who caught the ball with his bare hand to force 
out Lou Marson in the fifth inning for the second out. Paul Konerko broke 
the franchise record for most home runs hit during the month of April with 
11. On May 11, the Sox opened the two-game series at the new Target Field 
and took the victory 5–2 over Minnesota, but the next day lost 3–2. On 
August 29, The White Sox hosted Frank Thomas day at U.S. Cellular field 
against the New York Yankees. Frank Thomas's Jersey was retired that day. 
The White Sox Organization also printed his face on the legendary wall 
in Left-Center field with other number retirees Billy Pierce to his left 
and Carlton Fisk to his right. Thomas's image also appears under the printed 
words 'The Catch,' commemorating DeWayne Wise's catch to preserve Mark 
Buehrle's perfect game in 2009. Following a busy off season, in which the 
White Sox signed big name free agent Adam Dunn and re-signed first baseman 
Paul Konerko and catcher A. J. Pierzynski the White Sox, the 2011 White 
Sox ended the season with a 79–83 record. Some notable events for the 2011 
Season included: unveiling of a bronze statue of former White Sox slugger 
Frank Thomas and the catastrophically horrible season of Adam Dunn in his 
debut season as the White Sox designated hitter.[14] The end of the season 
was marked by the end of former World Series winning manager Ozzie Guillén 
who departed a few days before the end of the regular season, eventually 
signing as manager with the then Florida Marlins.[15] Shortly after the 
2011 season, the White Sox announced former third baseman Robin Ventura 
as their new manager, succeeding interim manager Don Cooper. On April 21, 
Philip Humber threw the third perfect game in franchise history against 
the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington, as the ChiSox 
won 3–0. It was the 21st perfect game in MLB history. The White Sox were 
leading the Central Division until the last weeks of the season where they 
lost many games and ended up 3 games behind the eventual AL Champions, 
the Detroit Tigers. Their final record was 85-77.[16] The Sox had the coldest 
opening day in 106 years, equalling the April 18, 1907 record of 38 °F 
or 3.3 °C.[4] They won the game 1-0.[17] However, the White Sox finished 
last in the AL Central and had the second worst record in the American 
League, losing 99 games – their first season losing more than 95 games
