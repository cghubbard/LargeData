Luis Beltrán Sojo Sojo (/ˈsoʊhoʊ/ SOH-hoh; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈlwiz 
βelˈtɾan ˈsoxo]; born January 3, 1966 in Petare, Miranda State, Venezuela) 
is a former Major League Baseball infielder and right-handed batter. In 
his career, Sojo filled a role as a utility infielder for the Blue Jays, 
Angels, Mariners, Pirates and, most notably, for the Yankees.[1] Not classically 
athletic, he was a natural shortstop in the minors, but took on an expanded 
role in emergency situations, initially and most commonly as a second baseman, 
and eventually as a third baseman, first baseman and left fielder as well.[2] 
Sojo had limited power and did not draw many walks, but he was a good contact 
hitter, especially for someone who made a habit of falling behind in the 
count during his minor league tenure. He did show an ability to put the 
ball in play with a low strikeout rate (one for 13 at-bats). Some of his 
great contributions came when going to the opposite field in hit and run 
situations and with infield hits. An avid bunter, he led the league in 
sacrificial hits in 1991 (19).[2] Though not a threat as a base stealer, 
he was a competent base runner. In the field, Sojo had a good range and 
a good arm, showing quick hands and slick moves. He signed with the Blue 
Jays on January 3, 1986. Called up late in the 1990 season, Sojo played 
33 games for the Blue Jays. He promptly went 18-for-80 (.225) and was then 
traded to the California Angels with a player to be named later (Ken Rivers). 
Sojo played 219 games for the Angels over two years. In 1991, he had 19 
sacrifice hits, a career-high. He was traded back to the Blue Jays after 
the 1992 season. Sojo played only 19 games in 1993, and was only 8 for 
47 (.170), although he managed to collect six runs batted in. He earned 
his first of five World Series rings with the Blue Jays. On October 15, 
he was granted free agency. Sojo hit .277 over 63 games in the strike-shortened 
1994 season, while also hitting 6 home runs, ten a career-best. He was 
once again awarded a starting role in 1995, where he played in 102 games, 
his second-highest career total. He finished the season with 98 hits, and 
seven home runs, tying a career best. In the 1995 American League Division 
Series against the Yankees, he played in all five games, going 5-for-20 
with 3 runs batted in. He continued his hot streak into the 1995 American 
League Championship Series, again going 5-for-20 as the Mariners lost to 
the Cleveland Indians. In 1996, Sojo began the 1996 season with the Mariners, 
hitting just .211 (52 for 247) over 77 games before being claimed off of 
waivers by the New York Yankees on August 22, 1996. Sojo began his Yankee 
career 11-for-40 (.275) while only striking out four times with one walk. 
After playing only 18 games with the Yankees, he was added to the postseason 
roster. He did not receive a plate appearance during the 1996 American 
League Division Series, but played as a defensive replacement and pinch 
runner. He did, however, play in the 1996 American League Championship 
Series, going 1 for 5 over 3 games. Despite his limited playing time in 
that postseason, he played in five of the six games of the 1996 World Series, 
going 3 for 5 (.600) with a double and a run batted in. Sojo earned his 
second World Series ring when the Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves. 
On January 9, 1997, Sojo re-signed with the Yankees. In 1997, Sojo began 
to see his playing time decrease. He played in only 77 games, hitting .377. 
Sojo's 25 runs batted in was his most as a Yankee. He did not play at all 
in the 1997 postseason as the Yankees were defeated by the Cleveland Indians. 
He was granted free agency on October 31, and again re-signed with the 
Yankees on November 12, 1997. During the 1998 season, Sojo's playing time 
again decreased as he saw action in only 54 games, hitting .231. He had 
34 hits and 14 runs batted in during the season, but did not play in the 
1998 American League Division Series. He rejoined the team for the Championship 
Series, where he played in one game. He did not play in the World Series, 
but received a ring regardless. In 1999, he played in just 49 games, less 
than the previous year, but hit .252 and again missed the Division Series. 
He re-joined the team for the 1999 American League Championship Series, 
where he had only one at-bat. He was not much of a force in the World Series 
that year either, with just one at-bat, but nevertheless received a World 
Series ring. He was released on November 10. On January 9, 2000, Sojo signed 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played in 61 games and hit .284 with 5 
home runs before being traded to the Yankees on August 7 in exchange for 
Chris Spurling. Sojo played in 34 games after being traded and hit .288, 
earning him a spot on the postseason roster. Playing in all five games 
of the American League Division Series, he was 3 for 16 with 5 RBIs and 
3 hits. Playing in all six games of the 2000 American League Championship 
Series, he went 6 for 23. In Game 5 of the 2000 World Series, Sojo turned 
from a role player to a hero.[3] With the score tied at two with two outs 
in the ninth inning, Sojo singled to center, driving in Jorge Posada to 
break the tie with Scott Brosius also scoring on the errant throw to home 
plate.[4] The Yankees won their 26th World Series, their third consecutive, 
and fourth in the Joe Torre era. Sojo obtained his fifth World Series ring, 
(4 with New York and one with the Blue Jays). On November 7, Sojo was released 
again and re-signed exactly one month later on December 7. In 2001, he 
played in 39 games, collecting only 13 hits, but proved productive, as 
he drove in nine runs.[2] After missing the American League Division Series, 
he received one at-bat in the American League Championship Series. He played 
in two of the seven games in that year's World Series, going 1 for 3 with 
a run batted in. In 2002, Sojo failed to earn a spot on the Yankees roster, 
and retired from playing Major League Baseball. He then made his managerial 
debut with the Yankees Double A affiliate Norwich Navigators,[5] and led 
the team to its first Eastern League Championship. 2003 was a unique year 
for Sojo. Having left the Navigators, Sojo was invited to the Yankees Old 
Timers Day. During the annual Old Timers' Game, he hit the game-winning 
home run off Ron Guidry. Later that season, the Yankees re-signed him as 
an active player, and he appeared in three games to conclude the season.[6] 
He may be the only Yankee (or overall player) in history to play in an 
Old Timers Game and later a regular season game in the same year. In 13 
seasons, Sojo batted .261 (671-for-2571) with 36 home runs, 261 RBI, 300 
runs, 103 doubles, 12 triples, and 28 stolen bases in 848 games. After 
his playing career, he served as the New York Yankees third base coach 
for the 2004 and 2005 seasons, after which he would serve as manager for 
the Class A Advanced Tampa Yankees from 2006 to 2009, before being relieved 
on Feb. 2, 2010.[7] Sojo also managed the Venezuelan national baseball 
team in the 2006, 2009, and the 2013 World Baseball Classic. On January 
10, 2011, the New York Yankees announced that they were bringing Sojo back 
to manage the Tampa Yankees.[8] After a disappointing 2013 season for the 
Tampa Yankees Sojo was released again from the manager spot.[9] He spent 
the 2014 season as the third base coach for the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
RailRiders before being fired[10] and starting in 2015 he will serve as
