Luis Enrique "Tite" Arroyo, (February 18, 1927 – January 13, 2016), was 
a major league baseball pitcher from 1955 to 1963. Arroyo was the first 
Puerto Rican born baseball player to play for the New York Yankees and 
was a key part of their pennant winning seasons in 1961 and 1962.[1] Arroyo, 
from Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, made his Major League Baseball debut on April 
20, 1955. A stocky left-hander, he spent one season primarily as a starter 
with the St. Louis Cardinals. Though he was a member of the National League 
All-Star team that year, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates the next 
spring, where he was moved to the bullpen. Struggling to establish himself 
in the role, he went from the Pirates to the Cincinnati Redlegs, then the 
New York Yankees. Arroyo was the first to play for the Yankees, and despite 
his earlier struggles, he quickly became an important contributor to the 
club.[2] American League hitters had little success against Arroyo's screwball, 
and after a solid contribution at the back of their bullpen in 1960, he 
enjoyed the best season of his career in 1961. That year, Arroyo pitched 
119 innings with a 2.19 ERA, while winning 15 games as the team's relief 
ace. His totals of 65 games pitched and 29 saves both led the league, he 
surrendered only five home runs in a season where league-wide offensive 
totals were very high by historical standards, and was named to his second 
All-Star team while finishing sixth in AL MVP voting.[2][3] Arroyo's glory 
was, however, short-lived. He injured his arm the following spring; while 
he pitched for two more seasons, he never regained his prior effectiveness. 
Arroyo retired after appearing in only six innings in the 1963 season. 
Over the course of his MLB career, he pitched 531 1⁄3 innings with a 3.93 
ERA, collecting 40 wins, 32 losses, and 44 saves.[2][3] Following his retirement 
as a player, Arroyo became a scout and pitching coach for the Yankees.[1] 
In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published 
an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Arroyo, a Puerto Rican, was the relief pitcher on Stein's Latin 
team.[2] On July 16, 2010, Arroyo was hospitalized after suffering a "mild 
heart attack"; he fell ill at an event leading up to the Yankees' July 
17 Old-Timers' Day celebration,[4] an annual event where Arroyo was a popular 
figure.[1] Arroyo died on January 13, 2016 in Ponce, Puerto Rico.[5] The 
Yankees announced his death saying that Arroyos daughter said he had been
