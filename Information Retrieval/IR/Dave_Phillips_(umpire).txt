David Robert Phillips (born October 8, 1943) is a retired umpire, first 
with the American League from 1971-1999, then with both leagues from 2001-2002.[1] 
Phillips wore uniform number 7 when the American League adopted uniform 
numbers for its umpires in 1980, and retained the number when the staffs 
merged in 2000. Phillips umpired in three American League Division Series 
(1981, 1997, and 1998), six American League Championship Series (1974, 
1978, 1983, 1985—crew chief, 1989—crew chief, and 1995—crew chief), four 
World Series (1976, 1982, 1987—crew chief, and 1993—crew chief) and two 
All-Star Games (1977 and 1990). Phillips served during six no-hitters (Nolan

White Sox to forfeit the second game of a scheduled doubleheader to the 
visiting Detroit Tigers. In August 1982, Phillips ejected Seattle Mariners 
pitcher Gaylord Perry for throwing an illegal pitch, the first such ejection 
of Perry's career.[2] On July 15, 1994, Phillips was the plate umpire when 
he decided to take Albert Belle's bat and have it placed in the umpire's 
locker room, after Chicago White Sox manager Gene Lamont alleged that the 
bat was corked. As the Indians were aware that Belle's bat was corked, 
Cleveland pitcher Jason Grimsley managed to get into the umpire's locker
