Paul Leroy Robeson (/ˈroʊbsən/; April 9, 1898 – January 23, 1976) was an 
American bass singer and actor who became involved with the Civil Rights 
Movement. At Rutgers College, he was an outstanding American football player, 
and then had an international career in singing, with a distinctive, powerful, 
deep bass voice, as well as acting in theater and movies. He became politically 
involved in response to the Spanish Civil War, fascism, and social injustices. 
His advocacy of anti-imperialism, affiliation with communism, and criticism 
of the United States government caused him to be blacklisted during the 
McCarthy era. Ill health forced him into retirement from his career. Robeson 
won an academic scholarship to Rutgers College, where he was twice named 
a consensus All-American and was the class valedictorian. He was later 
inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He received his LL.B. 
from Columbia Law School, while playing in the National Football League 
(NFL). At Columbia, he sang and acted in off-campus productions; and, after 
graduating, he became a participant in the Harlem Renaissance with performances 
in The Emperor Jones and All God's Chillun Got Wings. Robeson initiated 
his international artistic résumé with a theatrical role in Great Britain, 
settling in London for the next several years with his wife Essie. Robeson 
next appeared as Othello at the Savoy Theatre before becoming an international 
cinema star through roles in Show Boat and Sanders of the River. He became 
increasingly attuned towards the sufferings of other cultures and peoples. 
Acting against advice, which warned of his economic ruin if he became politically 
active, he set aside his theatrical career to advocate the cause of the 
Republican forces of the Spanish Civil War. He then became active in the 
Council on African Affairs (CAA). During World War II, he supported America's 
war efforts and won accolades for his portrayal of Othello on Broadway. 
However, his history of supporting pro-Soviet policies brought scrutiny 
from the FBI. After the war ended, the CAA was placed on the Attorney General's 
List of Subversive Organizations and Robeson was investigated during the 
age of McCarthyism. Due to his decision not to recant his public advocacy 
of pro-Soviet policies, he was denied a passport by the U.S. State Department, 
and his income, consequently, plummeted. He moved to Harlem and published 
a periodical critical of United States policies. His right to travel was 
eventually restored by the 1958 United States Supreme Court decision, Kent 
v. Dulles, but his health broke down. He retired and he lived out the remaining 
years of his life privately in Philadelphia. Paul Robeson was born in Princeton, 
New Jersey, in 1898, to Reverend William Drew Robeson and Maria Louisa 
Bustill.[1] His mother was from a prominent Quaker family of mixed ancestry: 
African, Anglo-American, and Lenape.[2] His father, William, whose family 
traced their ancestry to the Igbo people of present-day Nigeria,[1] escaped 
from a plantation in his teens[3] and eventually became the minister of 
Princeton's Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church in 1881.[4] Robeson 
had three brothers: William Drew, Jr. (born 1881), Reeve (born c. 1887), 
and Ben (born c. 1893); and one sister, Marian (born c. 1895).[5] In 1900, 
a disagreement between William and white financial supporters of Witherspoon 
arose with apparent racial undertones,[6] which were prevalent in Princeton.[7] 
William, who had the support of his entirely black congregation, resigned 
in 1901.[8] The loss of his position forced him to work menial jobs.[9] 
Three years later when Robeson was six, his mother, who was nearly blind, 
died in a house fire.[10] Eventually, William became financially incapable 
of providing a house for himself and his children still living at home, 
Ben and Paul, so they moved into the attic of a store in Westfield, New 
Jersey.[11] William found a stable parsonage at the St. Thomas A. M. E. 
Zion in 1910,[12] where Robeson would fill in for his father during sermons 
when he was called away.[13] In 1912, Robeson attended Somerville High 
School, Somerville, New Jersey,[14] where he performed in Julius Caesar, 
Othello, sang in the chorus, and excelled in football, basketball, baseball 
and track.[15] His athletic dominance elicited racial taunts which he ignored.[16] 
Prior to his graduation, he won a statewide academic contest for a scholarship 
to Rutgers.[17] He took a summer job as a waiter in Narragansett Pier, 
Rhode Island, where he befriended Fritz Pollard, later to be the first 
African-American coach in the National Football League.[18] In late 1915, 
Robeson became the third African-American student ever enrolled at Rutgers, 
and the only one at the time.[19] He tried out for the Rutgers Scarlet 
Knights football team,[20] and his resolve to make the squad was tested 
as his teammates engaged in unwarranted and excessive play, arguably precipitated 
by racism during which his nose was broken and his shoulder dislocated.[21] 
The coach, Foster Sanford, decided he had overcome the provocation and 
announced that he had made the team.[22] Robeson joined the debate team[23] 
and sang off-campus for spending money,[24] and on-campus with the Glee 
Club informally, as membership required attending all-white mixers.[25] 
He also joined the other collegiate athletic teams.[26] As a sophomore, 
amidst Rutgers' sesquicentennial celebration, he was benched when a Southern 
team refused to take the field, because the Scarlet Knights had fielded 
a Negro, Robeson.[27] After a standout junior year of football,[28] he 
was recognized in The Crisis for his athletic, academic, and singing talents.[29] 
At this time [30] his father fell grievously ill.[31] Robeson took the 
sole responsibility in caring for him, shuttling between Rutgers and Somerville.[32] 
His father, who was the "glory of his boyhood years"[33] soon died, and 
at Rutgers, Robeson expounded on the incongruity of African Americans fighting 
to protect America in World War I but, contemporaneously, being without 
the same opportunities in the United States as whites.[34] He finished 
university with four annual oratorical triumphs[35] and varsity letters 
in multiple sports.[36] His play at end[37] won him first-team All-American 
selection, in both his junior and senior years. Walter Camp considered 
him the greatest end ever.[38] Academically, he was accepted into Phi Beta 
Kappa[39] and Cap and Skull.[40] His classmates recognized him[41] by electing 
him class valedictorian.[42] The Daily Targum published a poem featuring 
his achievements.[43] In his valedictory speech, he exhorted his classmates 
to work for equality for all Americans.[44] Robeson entered New York University 
School of Law in fall 1919.[46] To support himself, he became an assistant 
football coach at Lincoln,[47] where he joined the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.[48] 
However, Robeson felt uncomfortable at NYU[49] and moved to Harlem and 
transferred to Columbia Law School in February 1920.[50] Already known 
in the black community for his singing,[51] he was selected to perform 
at the dedication of the Harlem YWCA.[52] Robeson began dating Eslanda 
"Essie" Goode[53] and after her coaxing,[54] he gave his theatrical debut 
as Simon in Ridgely Torrence's Simon of Cyrene.[55] After a year of courtship, 
they were married in August 1921.[56] He was recruited by Pollard to play 
for the NFL's Akron Pros while Robeson continued his law studies.[57] In 
the spring, Robeson postponed school[58] to portray Jim in Mary Hoyt Wiborg's 
Taboo.[59] He then sang in a chorus in an Off-Broadway production of Shuffle 
Along[60] before he joined Taboo in Britain.[61] The play was adapted by 
Mrs. Patrick Campbell to highlight his singing.[62] After the play ended, 
he befriended Lawrence Brown,[63] a classically trained musician,[64] before 
returning to Columbia while playing for the NFL's Milwaukee Badgers.[65] 
He ended his football career after 1922,[66] and months later, he graduated 
from law school.[67] Robeson worked briefly as a lawyer, but he renounced 
a career in law due to extant racism.[68] Essie financially supported them 
and they frequented the social functions at the future Schomburg Center.[69] 
In December 1924 he landed the lead role of Jim in Eugene O'Neill's All 
God's Chillun Got Wings,[70] which culminated with Jim metaphorically consummating 
his marriage with his white wife by symbolically emasculating himself. 
Chillun's opening was postponed while a nationwide debate occurred over 
its plot.[71] Chillun's delay led to a revival of The Emperor Jones with 
Robeson as Brutus, a role pioneered by Charles Sidney Gilpin.[72] The role 
terrified and galvanized Robeson, as it was practically a 90-minute soliloquy.[73] 
Reviews declared him an unequivocal success.[74] Though arguably clouded 
by its controversial subject, his Jim in Chillun was less well received.[75] 
He deflected criticism of its plot by writing that fate had drawn him to 
the "untrodden path" of drama and the true measure of a culture is in its 
artistic contributions, and the only true American culture was African-American.[76] 
The success of his acting placed him in elite social circles[77] and his 
ascension to fame, which was forcefully aided by Essie,[78] had occurred 
at a startling pace.[79] Essie's ambition for Robeson was a startling dichotomy 
to his indifference.[80] She quit her job, became his agent, and negotiated 
his first movie role in a silent race film directed by Oscar Micheaux, 
Body and Soul.[81] To support a charity for single mothers, he headlined 
a concert singing spirituals.[82] He performed his repertoire of spirituals 
on the radio.[83] Lawrence Brown, who had become renowned while touring 
as a pianist with gospel singer Roland Hayes, stumbled upon Robeson in 
Harlem.[84] The two ad-libbed a set of spirituals, with Robeson as lead 
and Brown as accompanist. This so enthralled them that they booked Provincetown 
Playhouse for a concert.[85] The pair's rendition of African-American folk 
songs and spirituals was captivating,[86] and Victor Records signed Robeson 
to a contract.[87] The Robesons went to London for a revival of Jones, 
before spending the rest of the fall on holiday on the French Riviera, 
socializing with Gertrude Stein and Claude McKay.[88] Robeson and Brown 
performed a series of concert tours in America from January 1926 until 
May 1927.[89] During a hiatus in New York, Robeson learned that Essie was 
several months pregnant.[90] Paul Robeson, Jr. was born in November 1927 
in New York, while Robeson and Brown toured Europe.[91] Essie experienced 
complications from the birth,[92] and by mid-December, her health had deteriorated 
dramatically. Ignoring Essie's objections, her mother wired Robeson and 
he immediately returned to her bedside.[93] Essie completely recovered 
after a few months.[citation needed] Robeson played "Joe" in the London 
production of the American musical Show Boat, at the Theatre Royal, Drury 
Lane.[94] His rendition of "Ol' Man River" became the benchmark for all 
future performers of the song.[95] Some black critics were not pleased 
with the play due to its usage of the word nigger.[96] It was, nonetheless, 
immensely popular with white audiences.[97] He was summoned for a Royal 
Command Performance at Buckingham Palace[98] as Robeson was befriended 
by MPs from the House of Commons.[99] Show Boat continued for 350 performances 
and, by 2001, it remained the Royal's most profitable venture.[95] The 
Robesons bought a home in Hampstead.[100] He reflected on his life in his 
diary and wrote that it was all part of a "higher plan" and "God watches 
over me and guides me. He's with me and lets me fight my own battles and 
hopes I'll win."[101] However, an incident at the Savoy Grill, in which 
he was refused seating, sparked him to issue a press release portraying 
the insult which subsequently became a matter of public debate.[102] Essie 
had learned early in their marriage that Robeson had been involved in extramarital 
affairs, but she tolerated them.[103] However, when she discovered that 
he was having another affair, she unfavorably altered the characterization 
of him in his biography,[104] and defamed him by describing him with "negative 
racial stereotypes".[105] Despite her uncovering of this tryst, there was 
no public evidence that their relationship had soured.[106] In early 1930, 
they both appeared in the experimental classic Borderline,[107] and then 
returned to the West End for his starring role in Shakespeare's Othello, 
opposite Peggy Ashcroft as Desdemona.[108] Robeson became the first black 
actor cast as Othello in Britain since Ira Aldridge.[109] The production 
received mixed reviews which pointed out Robeson's "highly civilized quality 
[but lacking the] grand style."[110] Robeson stated the best way to diminish 
the oppression African Americans faced was for his artistic work to be 
an example of what "men of my colour" could accomplish rather than to "be 
a propagandist and make speeches and write articles about what they call 
the Colour Question."[111] After Essie's discovery of Robeson's affair 
with Ashcroft, she decided to seek a divorce and they split up.[112] Robeson 
returned to Broadway as Joe in the 1932 revival of Show Boat, to critical 
and popular acclaim.[113] Subsequently, he received, with immense pride, 
an honorary master's degree from Rutgers.[114] Thereabout, his former football 
coach, Foster Sanford, advised him that divorcing Essie and marrying Ashcroft 
would do irreparable damage to his reputation.[115] Ashcroft and Robeson's 
relationship ended in 1932,[116] following which Robeson and Essie reconciled, 
although their relationship was permanently scarred.[117] In 1933 Robeson 
played the role of Jim in the London production of Chillun, virtually gratis;[118] 
then returned to the United States to star as Brutus in the film The Emperor 
Jones,[119] "a feat not repeated for more than two decades in the U.S."[120][clarification 
needed] His acting in "Jones"—the first film to feature an African American 
in a starring role—was well received.[120] On the film set he rejected 
any slight to his dignity, despite the widespread Jim Crow atmosphere in 
the United States.[121] Upon returning to England he publicly criticized 
African Americans' rejection of their own culture.[122] Despite negative 
reactions from the press, such as a New York Amsterdam News retort that 
Robeson had made a "jolly well [ass of himself]",[123] he also announced 
that he would reject any offers to perform European opera, because the 
music had no connection to his heritage.[124] In early 1934 Robeson enrolled 
in the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, where he studied 
some 20 African dialects. His "sudden interest" in African history and 
its impact on culture[125] coincided with his essay "I Want to be African", 
wherein he wrote of his desire to embrace his ancestry.[126] He undertook 
the role of Bosambo in the movie Sanders of the River,[127] which he felt 
would render a realistic view of colonial African culture.[citation needed] 
His friends in the anti-imperialism movement and association with British 
socialists led him to visit the Soviet Union.[126] Robeson, Essie, and 
Marie Seton traveled to the Soviet Union on an invitation from Sergei Eisenstein 
in December 1934.[128] A stopover in Berlin enlightened Robeson to the 
racism in Nazi Germany[129] and, on his arrival in the Soviet Union, he 
expounded on race and what he felt in Moscow, where he said, "Here I am 
not a Negro but a human being for the first time in my life .. I walk in 
full human dignity."[130] Waldemar ("Wally") Hille, who subsequently went 
on to do arrangements on the People's Songs Bulletin with Pete Seeger and 
others, got his start as an early touring pianist for Robeson. Sanders 
of the River, released in 1935, made Robeson an international movie star;[131] 
but the stereotypical portrayal of a colonial African[132] was seen as 
embarrassing to his stature as an artist[133] and damaging to his reputation.[134] 
The Commissioner of Nigeria to London protested the film as slanderous 
to his country,[135] and Robeson thereafter became more politically conscious 
of his roles.[136] He appeared in the play Stevedore at the Embassy Theatre 
in London in May 1935,[137] which was favorably reviewed in The Crisis 
by Nancy Cunard, who concluded: "Stevedore is extremely valuable in the 
racial–social question — it is straight from the shoulder".[138] In early 
1936, he decided to send his son to school in the Soviet Union to shield 
him from racist attitudes.[139] He then played the role of Toussaint Louverture 
in the eponymous play by C. L. R. James[140] at the Westminster Theatre, 
and appeared in the films Song of Freedom,[141] Show Boat,[142] Big Fella,[143] 
My Song Goes Forth,[144] and King Solomon's Mines.[145] He was internationally 
recognized as the 10th most popular star in British cinema.[146] Robeson 
believed that the struggle against fascism during the Spanish Civil War 
was a turning point in his life and transformed him into a political activist.[147] 
In 1937, he used his concert performances to advocate the Republican cause 
and the war's refugees.[148] He permanently modified his renditions of 
Ol' Man River from a tragic "song of resignation with a hint of protest 
implied"[citation needed] into a battle hymn of unwavering defiance.[149] 
His business agent expressed concern about his political involvement,[150] 
but Robeson overruled him and decided that contemporary events trumped 
commercialism.[151] In Wales,[152] he commemorated the Welsh killed while 
fighting for the Republicans,[153] where he recorded a message which would 
become his epitaph: "The artist must take sides. He must elect to fight 
for freedom or slavery. I have made my choice. I had no alternative."[154] 
After an invitation from J. B. S. Haldane,[155] he traveled to Spain in 
1938 because he believed in the International Brigades's cause, [156] visited 
the hospital of the Benicàssim, singing to the wounded soldiers.[157] Also 
visited the battlefront[158] and provided a morale boost to the Republicans 
at a time when their victory was unlikely.[159] Back in England, he hosted 
Jawaharlal Nehru to support Indian independence, whereat Nehru expounded 
on imperialism's affiliation with Fascism.[160] Robeson reevaluated the 
direction of his career and decided to focus his attention on utilizing 
his talents to bring attention to the ordeals of "common people".[161] 
and subsequently he appeared in the pro-labor play Plant in the Sun[162] 
by Herbert Marshall.[163] With Max Yergan, and the CAA, Robeson became 
an advocate in the aspirations of African colonialists for political independence.[164] 
Robeson's last British film was The Proud Valley (released 1940), set in 
a Welsh coal-mining town.[165] After the outbreak of World War II, Robeson 
returned to the United States and became America's "no.1 entertainer"[166] 
with a radio broadcast of Ballad for Americans.[167] Nevertheless, during 
an ensuing tour, the Beverly Wilshire Hotel was the only hotel willing 
to accommodate him due to his race,[citation needed] and he therefore dedicated 
two hours every afternoon sitting in the lobby "to ensure that the next 
time Black[s] come through, they'll have a place to stay."[citation needed] 
Furthermore, Native Land was labeled by the FBI as communist propaganda.[168] 
After an appearance in Tales of Manhattan, a production that he felt was 
"very offensive to my people", he announced that he would no longer act 
in films because of the demeaning roles available to blacks.[169] Robeson 
participated in benefit concerts on behalf of the war effort and at a concert 
at the Polo Grounds, he met two emissaries from the Jewish Anti-Fascist 
Committee, Solomon Mikhoels and Itzik Feffer[170] Subsequently, Robeson 
reprised his role of Othello at the Shubert Theatre in 1943,[171] and became 
the first African American to play the role with a white supporting cast 
on Broadway. During the same period of time, he addressed a meeting with 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis in a failed attempt to convince him to admit black 
players to Major League Baseball.[172] He toured North America with Othello 
until 1945,[173] and subsequently, his political efforts with the CAA to 
get colonial powers to discontinue their exploitation of Africa were short-circuited 
by the United Nations.[174] After the lynchings of four African Americans, 
Robeson met with President Truman and admonished Truman that if he did 
not enact legislation to end lynching,[175] "the Negroes will defend themselves".[175][176] 
Truman immediately terminated the meeting and declared the time was not 
right to propose anti-lynching legislation.[175] Subsequently, Robeson 
publicly called upon all Americans to demand that Congress pass civil rights 
legislation.[177] Taking a stance against lynching, Robeson founded the 
American Crusade Against Lynching organization in 1946. This organization 
was thought to be a threat to the NAACP antiviolence movement. Robeson 
received support from W. E. B. Du Bois regarding this matter and officially 
launched this organization on the anniversary day of the Emancipation Proclamation, 
September 23.[178] About this time, Robeson's belief that trade unionism 
was crucial to civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs 
as he became proponent of the union activist Revels Cayton.[179] Robeson 
was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions 
about his affiliation with the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) by testifying 
that he was not a member of the CPUSA.[180] Nevertheless, two organizations 
with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC)[citation 
needed] and the CAA,[181] were placed on the Attorney General's List of 
Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO).[182] Subsequently, he was summoned before 
the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned 
about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: 
"Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go 
to jail for the failure to answer that question, and I am going to join 
them, if necessary."[183] In 1948, Robeson was preeminent in Henry A. Wallace's 
bid for the President of the United States,[184] during which Robeson traveled 
to the Deep South, at risk to his own life, to campaign for him.[185] In 
the ensuing year, Robeson was forced to go overseas to work because his 
concert performances were canceled at the FBI's behest.[186] While on tour, 
he spoke at the World Peace Council,[187] at which his speech was publicly 
reported as equating America with a Fascist state[188]—a depiction that 
he flatly denied.[189] Nevertheless, the speech publicly attributed to 
him was a catalyst for his becoming an enemy of mainstream America.[190] 
Robeson refused to subjugate himself to public criticism when he advocated 
in favor of twelve defendants, including his long-time friend, Benjamin 
J. Davis, Jr. charged during the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.[citation 
needed] Robeson traveled to Moscow in June, and was unable to find Itzik 
Feffer. He let Soviet authorities know that he wanted to see him.[191] 
Reluctant to lose Robeson as a propagandist for the Soviet Union,[192] 
the Soviets brought Feffer from prison to him. Feffer told him that Mikhoels 
had been murdered, and he would be summarily executed.[193] To protect 
the Soviet Union's reputation,[194] and to keep the right wing of the United 
States from gaining the moral high ground, Robeson denied that any persecution 
existed in the Soviet Union,[195] and kept the meeting secret for the rest 
of his life, except from his son.[194] On June 20, 1949, Robeson spoke 
at the Paris Peace Congress saying that "We in America do not forget that 
it was on the backs of the white workers from Europe and on the backs of 
millions of Blacks that the wealth of America was built. And we are resolved 
to share it equally. We reject any hysterical raving that urges us to make 
war on anyone. Our will to fight for peace is strong. We shall not make 
war on anyone. We shall not make war on the Soviet Union. We oppose those 
who wish to build up imperialist Germany and to establish fascism in Greece. 
We wish peace with Franco's Spain despite her fascism. We shall support 
peace and friendship among all nations, with Soviet Russia and the people's 
Republics." He was blacklisted for saying this in the US mainstream press 
including many periodicals of the Negro press such as The Crisis.[196] 
In order to isolate Robeson politically,[197] the House Un-American Activities 
Committee (HUAC) subpoenad Jackie Robinson[198] to comment on Robeson's 
Paris speech.[198] Robinson testified that Robeson's statements, "'if accurately 
reported', were silly'".[197] Days later, the announcement of a concert 
headlined by Robeson in New York provoked the local press to decry the 
use of their community to support subversives[199] and the Peekskill Riots 
ensued.[200] A book reviewed in early 1950 as "the most complete record 
on college football"[201] failed to list Robeson as ever having played 
on the Rutgers team[202] and as ever having been an All-American.[203] 
Months later, NBC canceled Robeson's appearance on Eleanor Roosevelt's 
television program.[204] Subsequently, the State Department (State) denied 
Robeson a passport to travel abroad and issued a "stop notice" at all ports 
because it believed that an isolated existence inside United States borders 
would not only afford him less freedom of expression[205] but also avenge 
his "extreme advocacy on behalf of the independence of the colonial peoples 
of Africa."[206] However, when Robeson met with State and asked why he 
was denied a passport, he was told that "his frequent criticism of the 
treatment of blacks in the United States should not be aired in foreign 
countries".[207] In 1951, an article titled "Paul Robeson – the Lost Shepherd" 
was published in The Crisis[208] although Paul Jr. suspected it was authored 
by Amsterdam News columnist Earl Brown.[209] J. Edgar Hoover and the United 
States State Department arranged for the article to be printed and distributed 
in Africa[210] in order to defame Robeson's reputation and reduce his and 
Communists' popularity in colonial countries.[211] Another article by Wilkins 
denounced Robeson as well as the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) in terms consistent 
with the anti-Communist FBI propaganda.[212] On December 17, 1951, Robeson 
presented to the United Nations an anti-lynching petition, "We Charge Genocide".[213] 
The document asserted that the United States federal government, by its 
failure to act against lynching in the United States, was "guilty of genocide" 
under Article II of the UN Genocide Convention. In 1952, Robeson was awarded 
the International Stalin Prize by the Soviet Union.[214] Unable to travel 
to Moscow, he accepted the award in New York.[215] In April 1953, shortly 
after Stalin's death, Robeson penned To You My Beloved Comrade, praising 
Stalin as dedicated to peace and a guide to the world: "Through his deep 
humanity, by his wise understanding, he leaves us a rich and monumental 
heritage."[216] Robeson's opinion on the Soviet Union kept his passport 
out of reach and stopped his return to the entertainment industry and the 
civil rights movement.[217] In his opinion, the Soviet Union was the guarantor 
of political balance in the world.[218] In a symbolic act of defiance against 
the travel ban, labor unions in the United States and Canada organized 
a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington 
state and the Canadian province of British Columbia.[219] Robeson returned 
to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953,[220] and over the 
next two years, two further concerts were scheduled. In this period, with 
the encouragement of his friend the Welsh politician Aneurin Bevan, Robeson 
recorded a number of radio concerts for supporters in Wales. In 1956, Robeson 
was called before HUAC after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming 
that he was not a Communist. In his testimony, he invoked the Fifth Amendment 
and refused to reveal his political affiliations. When asked why he had 
not remained in the Soviet Union because of his affinity with its political 
ideology, he replied that "because my father was a slave and my people 
died to build [the United States and], I am going to stay here, and have 
a part of it just like you and no fascist-minded people will drive me from 
it!"[221] Robeson's passport was subsequently revoked. Campaigns were launched 
to protest the passport ban and the restriction of his right to travel 
over the next four years, but it was to no avail. In 1957, unable to accept 
invitations to perform abroad, Paul Robeson sang for audiences in London, 
where 1,000 concert tickets for his telephone concert at St Pancras Town 
Hall sold out within an hour,[222] and Wales via the transatlantic telephone 
cable TAT-1:[223] "We have to learn the hard way that there is another 
way to sing".[224] In 1956 in the United Kingdom, Topic Records, at that 
time part of the Workers Music Association, released a single of "Joe Hill" 
backed with "John Brown's Body". Versions of "Joe Hill" are the third most 
popular selection on the BBC radio programme Desert Island Discs for British 
Labour Party politicians, and the fourth most popular selection for all 
British politicians. This version was selected by Ed Miliband.[225] Nikita 
Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalinism at the 1956 Party Congress silenced 
Robeson on Stalin, though Robeson continued to praise the Soviet Union.[226] 
In 1956, after public pressure brought a one-time exemption to the travel 
ban, Robeson performed concerts in Canada in March.[citation needed] That 
year Robeson, along with close friend W. E. B. Du Bois, compared the anti-Soviet 
uprising in Hungary to the "same sort of people who overthrew the Spanish 
Republican Government" and supported the Soviet invasion and suppression 
of the revolt.[227] An appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States 
to reinstate his confiscated passport had been rejected, but over the telephone 
Robeson was able to sing to the 5,000 gathered there as he had earlier 
in the year to London. Due to the reaction to the promulgation of Robeson's 
political views,[citation needed] his recordings and films were removed 
from public distribution,[citation needed] and he was universally condemned 
in the U.S press.[citation needed] During the height of the Cold War, it 
became increasingly difficult in the United States to hear Robeson sing 
on commercial radio, buy his music or see his films.[228] 1958 saw the 
publication of Robeson's "manifesto-autobiography", Here I Stand.[229] 
His passport was restored in June 1958 via Kent v. Dulles,[230] and he 
embarked on a world tour using London as his base.[citation needed][231] 
In Moscow in August 1959, he received a tumultuous reception at the Lenin 
Stadium (Khabarovsk) where he sang classic Russian songs along with American 
standards.[232] Robeson and Essie then flew to Yalta to rest and spend 
time with Nikita Khrushchev.[citation needed] On October 11, 1959, Robeson 
took part in a service at St. Paul's Cathedral, the first black performer 
to sing there.[233] On a trip to Moscow, Robeson experienced bouts of dizziness 
and heart problems and was hospitalized for two months while Essie was 
diagnosed with operable cancer.[234] He recovered and returned to the UK 
to visit the National Eisteddfod. Meanwhile, the State Department had circulated 
negative literature about him throughout the media in India.[235] During 
his run at the Royal Shakespeare Company playing Othello in Tony Richardson's 
1959 production at Stratford-upon-Avon, he befriended actor Andrew Faulds, 
whose family hosted him in the nearby village of Shottery. In 1960, in 
what would prove to be his final concert performance in Great Britain, 
Robeson sang to raise money for the Movement for Colonial Freedom at the 
Royal Festival Hall.[citation needed] In October 1960, Robeson embarked 
on a two-month concert tour of Australia and New Zealand with Essie, primarily 
to generate money,[236] at the behest of Australian politician Bill Morrow.[237] 
While in Sydney, he became the first major artist to perform at the construction 
site of the future Sydney Opera House.[238] After appearing at the Brisbane 
Festival Hall, they went to Auckland where Robeson reaffirmed his support 
of Marxism,[239] denounced the inequality faced by the Māori and efforts 
to denigrate their culture.[240] Thereabouts, Robeson publicly stated "..the 
people of the lands of Socialism want peace dearly".[241] He was introduced 
to Faith Bandler who enlightened the Robesons to the deprivation of the 
Australian Aborigines.[242] Robeson, consequently, became enraged and demanded 
the Australian government provide the Aborigines citizenship and equal 
rights.[243] He attacked the view of the Aborigines as being unsophisticated 
and uncultured,[citation needed] and declared, "there's no such thing as 
a backward human being, there is only a society which says they are backward."[citation 
needed] Back in London, he planned his return to the United States to participate 
in the Civil Rights Movement, stopping off in Africa, China and Cuba along 
the way. Essie argued to stay in London, fearing that he'd be "killed" 
if he returned and would be "unable to make any money" due to harassment 
by the United States government. Robeson disagreed and made his own travel 
arrangements, stopping off in Moscow in March 1961.[244] During an uncharacteristically 
wild party in his Moscow hotel room, he locked himself in his bedroom and 
attempted suicide by cutting his wrists.[245] Three days later, under Soviet 
medical care, he told his son that he felt extreme paranoia, thought that 
the walls of the room were moving and, overcome by a powerful sense of 
emptiness and depression, tried to take his own life.[246] Paul Jr. believed 
that his father's health problems stemmed from attempts by CIA and MI5 
to "neutralize" his father.[247][248] He remembered that his father had 
had such fears prior to his prostate operation.[249] He said that three 
doctors treating Robeson in London and New York had been CIA contractors,[247] 
and that his father's symptoms resulted from being "subjected to mind depatterning 
under MKULTRA", a secret CIA programme.[250] Martin Duberman claimed that 
Robeson's health breakdown was probably brought on by a combination of 
factors including extreme emotional and physical stress, bipolar depression, 
exhaustion and the beginning of circulatory and heart problems. "[E]ven 
without an organic predisposition and accumulated pressures of government 
harassment he might have been susceptible to a breakdown."[251] Robeson 
stayed at the Barvikha Sanatorium until September 1961, when he left for 
London. There his depression reemerged, and after another period of recuperation 
in Moscow, he returned to London. Three days after arriving back, he became 
suicidal and suffered a panic attack while passing the Soviet Embassy.[252] 
He was admitted to The Priory hospital, where he underwent electroconvulsive 
therapy (ECT) and was given heavy doses of drugs for nearly two years, 
with no accompanying psychotherapy.[253] During his treatment at the Priory, 
Robeson was being monitored by the British MI5.[254] Both intelligence 
services were well aware of Robeson's suicidal state of mind. An FBI memo 
described Robeson's debilitated condition, remarking that his "death would 
be much publicized" and would be used for Communist propaganda, necessitating 
continued surveillance.[255] Numerous memos advised that Robeson should 
be denied a passport renewal which would ostensibly jeopardize his fragile 
health and his recovery process.[245] In August 1963, disturbed about his 
treatment, friends had him transferred to the Buch Clinic in East Berlin.[256][257] 
Given psychotherapy and less medication, his physicians found him still 
"completely without initiative" and they expressed "doubt and anger" about 
the "high level of barbiturates and ECT" that had been administered in 
London. He rapidly improved, though his doctor stressed that "what little 
is left of Paul's health must be quietly conserved."[258] In 1963, Robeson 
returned to the United States and for the remainder of his life lived in 
seclusion.[259] He momentarily assumed a role in the civil rights movement,[247] 
making a few major public appearances before falling seriously ill during 
a tour. Double pneumonia and a kidney blockage in 1965 nearly killed him.[259] 
Robeson was contacted by both Bayard Rustin and James L. Farmer, Jr. about 
the possibility of becoming involved with the mainstream of the Civil Rights 
movement.[260] Because of Rustin's past anti-Communist stances, Robeson 
declined to meet with him. Robeson eventually met with Farmer, but because 
he was asked to denounce Communism and the Soviet Union in order to assume 
a place in the mainstream, Robeson adamantly declined.[261] After Essie, 
who had been his spokesperson to the media, died in December 1965,[262] 
Robeson moved in with his son's family in New York City.[263][257] He was 
rarely seen strolling near his Harlem apartment on Jumal Place (sic.), 
and his son responded to press inquiries that his "father's health does 
not permit him to perform or answer questions."[257] In 1968, he settled 
at his sister's home in Philadelphia.[264][257] Numerous celebrations were 
held in honor of Robeson over the next several years, including at public 
arenas that had previously shunned him, but he saw few visitors aside from 
close friends and gave few statements apart from messages to support current 
civil rights and international movements, feeling that his record "spoke 
for itself".[265] At a Carnegie Hall tribute to mark his 75th birthday 
in 1973, he was unable to attend, but a taped message from him was played 
that said: "Though I have not been able to be active for several years, 
I want you to know that I am the same Paul, dedicated as ever to the worldwide 
cause of humanity for freedom, peace and brotherhood."[266] On January 
23, 1976, following complications of a stroke, Robeson died in Philadelphia 
at the age of 77.[267] He lay in state in Harlem[268] and his funeral was 
held at his brother Ben's former parsonage, Mother AME Zion Church,[269] 
where Bishop J. Clinton Hoggard performed the eulogy.[270] His twelve pall 
bearers included Harry Belafonte[271] and Pollard.[272] He was interred 
in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.[271] According to biographer, 
Martin Duberman, contemporary post-mortem reflections on Robeson's life 
in "[t]he white [American] press..ignored the continuing inability of white 
America to tolerate a black maverick who refused to bend, ..downplayed 
the racist component central to his persecution [during his life]", as 
they "paid him gingerly respect and tipped their hat to him as a 'great 
American,'" while the black American press, "which had never, overall, 
been as hostile to Robeson [as the white American press had], opined that 
his life '..would always be a challenge to white and Black America.'"[269] 
Early in his life, Robeson was one of the most influential participants 
in the Harlem Renaissance.[273] His achievements in sport and culture were 
all the more incredible given the barriers of racism he had to surmount.[274] 
Robeson brought Negro spirituals into the American mainstream .[275] His 
theatrical performances have been recognized as the first to display dignity 
for black actors and pride in African heritage,[276] and he was among the 
first artists to refuse to play live to segregated audiences. After McCarthyism, 
[Robeson's stand] on anti-colonialism in the 1940s would never again have 
a voice in American politics, but the [African independence movements] 
of the late 1950s and 1960s would vindicate his anti-colonial [agenda].[277] 
Several public and private establishments he was associated with have been 
landmarked,[278] or named after him.[279] His efforts to end Apartheid 
in South Africa were posthumously rewarded by the United Nations General 
Assembly.[280] Paul Robeson: Tribute to an Artist won an Academy Award 
for best short documentary in 1980.[281] In 1995, he was named to the College 
Football Hall of Fame.[282] In the centenary of his birth, which was commemorated 
around the world,[283] he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award,[284] 
as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[285] Robeson is also a 
member of the American Theater Hall of Fame.[286] As of 2011[update] the 
run of Othello starring Robeson was the longest-running production of a 
Shakespeare play ever staged on Broadway.[287] He received a Donaldson 
Award for his performance.[288] His Othello was characterised by Michael 
A. Morrison in 2011 as a high point in Shakespearean theatre in the 20th 
century.[289] Subsequently, he received the Spingarn medal from the NAACP.[290] 
His starring role as an African American in the film "was a feat not repeated 
for more than two decades in the U.S.[120] Paul Robeson: Tribute to an 
Artist won an Academy Award for best short documentary in 1980. Robeson 
left Australia as a respected, albeit controversial, figure and his support 
for Aboriginal rights had a profound effect in Australia over the next 
decade.[291] Robeson archives exist at the Academy of Arts;[292] Howard 
University,[293] and the Schomburg Center.[294] In 2010, Susan Robeson 
launched a project by Swansea University and the Welsh Assembly to create 
an online learning resource in her grandfather's memory.[295] Robeson connected 
his own life and history not only to his fellow Americans and to his people 
in the South, but to all the people of Africa and its diaspora whose lives 
had been fundamentally shaped by the same processes that had brought his 
ancestors to America.[296] While a consensus definition of his legacy remains 
controversial,[297] to deny his courage in the face of public and governmental 
pressure would be to defame his courage.[298] In 1976, the apartment building 
on Edgecombe Avenue in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan where 
Robeson lived during the early 1940s was officially renamed the Paul Robeson 
Residence, and declared a National Historic Landmark.[299][300][301] In 
1993, the building was designated a New York City landmark as well.[302] 
Edgecombe Avenue itself was later co-named Paul Robeson Boulevard. In 1978, 
TASS announced that the Latvian Shipping Company had named one of its new 
40,000-ton tankers Paul Robeson in honor of the singer. TASS said the ship's 
crew would establish a Robeson museum aboard the tanker.[303] In 2001, 
the Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers released the single Let Robeson 
Sing from their album Know Your Enemy. The song is about the life of Paul 
Robeson. In 2002, a blue plaque was unveiled by English Heritage on the 
house in Hampstead where Robeson lived in 1929–1930.[304] In 2004, the 
U.S. Postal Service issued a 37-cent stamp honoring Robeson.[305] In 2007, 
the Criterion Collection, a company that specializes in releasing special 
edition versions of classic and contemporary films, released a DVD boxed 
set of Robeson films.[306] The main campus library at Rutgers University 
Camden is named after Robeson,[307] as is the campus center at Rutgers 
University Newark.[308] Tom Rob Smith's novel Agent 6 (2012) features the 
character "Jesse Austin, a black singer, political activist and communist 
sympathizer modeled after real-life actor/activist Paul Robeson. In his 
portrayal of Austin, Smith dramatizes little-known facts of the FBI's harassment 
of Robeson and his family that give a chilling verisimilitude to the actions 
of an FBI agent hellbent on destroying a perceived threat to his country."[309] 
Black 47's album Home of The Brave includes the song "Paul Robeson (Born 
To Be Free)", which features spoken quotes of Robeson as part of the song.[310] 
These quotes are drawn from Robeson's testimony before the House Un-American 
Activities Committee in June 1956. In 1978, James Earl Jones performed 
his one-man show about Paul Robeson on Broadway, this was made into a TV 
movie in 1979.[citation needed] In November 2014 it was reported that film 
director Steve McQueen's next film would be a biopic about Paul Robeson.[311] 
In 2001, Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers released a song titled 
Let Robeson Sing as a tribute to Robeson, which reached number 19 on the
