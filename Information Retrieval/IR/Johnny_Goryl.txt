John Albert Goryl (born October 21, 1933 in Cumberland, Rhode Island) is 
a special adviser/player development for the Cleveland Indians and a former 
infielder, manager and coach in American Major League Baseball. A right-handed 
batter and thrower who stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 
175 pounds (79 kg), Goryl apprenticed in the farm systems of the Boston/Milwaukee 
Braves and Chicago Cubs. He played 117 games for the Cubs over three seasons 
(1957–1959), returned to the minor leagues when he was traded to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, then joined the Minnesota Twins in 1962 for the remainder 
of his MLB playing career. His finest season was 1963, when he hit .287 
with nine home runs in 64 games. Overall, Goryl batted .225 with 134 hits 
in 276 games over six MLB campaigns. When his playing career ended, Goryl 
became a manager in the Twins' farm system (1966–68; 1970–78), and third-base 
coach of the MLB Twins (1968–69; 1979–80). During his second stint as a 
Minnesota coach in 1980 he was named successor to manager Gene Mauch on 
August 25. The Twins won 23 of their final 36 games that season, to improve 
from sixth to third place in the American League West, but when they faltered 
coming out of the gate in 1981 — losing 25 of their first 36 games — Goryl 
was replaced by one of his coaches, Billy Gardner. His career MLB managing 
record was 34–38 (.472). After his firing, Goryl joined the Cleveland organization 
as a Major League coach (1982–88; 1997–98) and development official in 
the Indians' minor league system, continuing into the present day. He was 
inducted in the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002. Goryl
