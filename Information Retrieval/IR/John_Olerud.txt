John Garrett Olerud (/ˈoʊləruːd/; nicknamed Johnny O, and Big Rude; born 
August 5, 1968), is a left-handed American former Major League Baseball 
first baseman. Olerud played with the Toronto Blue Jays (1989–96), New 
York Mets (1997–99), Seattle Mariners (2000–2004), New York Yankees (2004) 
and Boston Red Sox (2005). A patient, productive hitter throughout his 
career, Olerud won the American League batting title in 1993 and was runner-up 
for the National League batting title in 1998. Also a three-time Gold Glove 
winner, he was an excellent defensive first baseman and part of Sports 
Illustrated's "Greatest Infield Ever?" cover with Edgardo Alfonzo, Rey 
Ordóñez, and Robin Ventura, when he played for the Mets.[1] Olerud was 
born to Lynda and John E. Olerud, a physician, dermatologist and baseball 
player.[2][3] The elder Olerud, as a catcher and captain of the Washington 
State Cougars, brought his team to the 1965 College World Series before 
being selected by the California Angels in the 1965 Major League Baseball 
draft and spending the next seven years both studying medicine and playing 
minor league baseball.[3] At Interlake High School, Olerud played varsity 
golf and baseball for three years.[4] In 1986, he led Interlake to a state 
high school baseball championship as both a pitcher and hitter.[2] In 1987, 
Olerud hit .414 with 5 HR and 20 RBIs. As a pitcher, he went 8-2 with a 
3.00 ERA and was a freshman All-American. In 1988, Olerud hit .464 with 
23 HR, 81 RBIs, 108 hits, 204 total bases, and a .876 slugging percentage. 
As a pitcher, he had an undefeated 15–0 season, and threw 113 strikeouts 
with a 2.49 ERA. He was a consensus All-American as both a first baseman 
and pitcher and was named the Baseball America College Player of the Year. 
In 1989, while recovering from a brain aneurysm, Olerud hit .359 with 5 
HR and 30 RBI in 78 plate appearances. He threw for three wins, two losses, 
and a 6.68 ERA. He was a Pac-10 North All-League designated Hitter. After 
his college career, the Toronto Blue Jays drafted him in the third round 
of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. In a 17-season career through 
2005 spanning 2,234 games, Olerud posted a .398 on-base percentage, 500 
doubles, 255 home runs, 1,275 walks, 1,408 runs scored, 3,602 times on 
base, 96 sacrifice flies and 157 intentional walks. He was also hit by 
a pitch 88 times and grounded into 232 double plays during his career. 
He is also one of only 26 players to ever hit for the cycle multiple times 
in their careers. He was a two-time All-Star and was a member of two World 
Series-winning teams with the Blue Jays (1992–93). Olerud jumped directly 
to the majors after a stellar career at Washington State University, where 
he was a pitcher noted for his performance from 1987 to 1989. He had originally 
intended to return to Washington State for his senior year but agreed to 
sign with the Blue Jays only after they promised that he would report directly 
to Toronto.[5] He was known for wearing a batting helmet in the field as 
a precaution, since he had suffered a brain aneurysm while playing in college.[6] 
Olerud broke into MLB with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1989. He was platooned 
by Jays' manager Cito Gaston for the first few years of his career, until 
1992, when he became the team's full-time first baseman. In 1993, his breakout 
season, he led the American League in batting average (.363), intentional 
walks (33), times on base (321), on-base percentage (.473), OPS (1.072), 
and doubles (54, also a career high), while posting career highs in home 
runs (24), RBI (107), runs (109), and hits (200). He flirted with a .400 
batting average for much of the season, with his average staying higher 
than .400 as late as August 24. Despite putting up solid numbers over the 
next several years, he failed to meet the high expectations placed upon 
him following his breakout performance in 1993. After the 1996 season, 
Olerud was battling veteran Joe Carter and up-and-comer Carlos Delgado 
for a spot at either first base or designated hitter. Delgado was young, 
had a bright future and a low salary, while Gaston preferred Carter to 
Olerud, feeling the latter wasn't aggressive enough at the plate.[7] Therefore, 
Olerud was traded, along with cash, to the New York Mets on December 20, 
1996 for Robert Person. With the Mets, he set a team record in 1998 only 
tied by Ike Davis in 2013, by reaching base at least twice in 12 straight 
starts.[8] Olerud set team single-season records for batting average (.354), 
on-base percentage (.447) and runs created (138) in 1998 and set their 
team records for most walks (125) and times on base (309) in a season in 
1999. Also during his 1999 campaign, Olerud appeared on the cover of the 
September 6 issue of Sports Illustrated, along with fellow Mets infielders 
Edgardo Alfonzo, Rey Ordóñez, and Robin Ventura. The magazine raised the 
debate as to whether the four talented defensive players comprised the 
best infield in Major League history. Following the 1999 season, Olerud 
returned home, agreeing to a three-year, $20 million contract with the 
Seattle Mariners. In 2000, he amassed 45 doubles, 102 walks, 10 sacrifice 
flies and 11 intentional walks. He was an important part of the Mariners' 
116–46 2001 season, with a .401 on-base percentage, 94 walks, 272 times 
on base and 19 intentional walks in 159 games. In 2002, he recorded a .403 
on-base percentage, 39 doubles, 98 walks, 269 times on base and led the 
American League in sacrifice flies (12). In 2003, he collected another 
84 walks. Olerud also earned all three of his career Gold Gloves while 
playing first base for Seattle in 2000, 2002 and 2003. After being released 
by the Mariners in the middle of the 2004 season, Olerud was signed by 
the New York Yankees to fill a void left at first base by the injury of 
Jason Giambi. Later that year the Yankees visited Seattle to play the Mariners. 
Olerud started the second game; his first time up, Mariner catcher Dan 
Wilson went to the mound to have a "conference" with pitcher Jamie Moyer. 
This gave time for about a minute long standing ovation for Olerud from 
the Seattle fans. His AL championship series was cut short when he was 
forced to leave due to an injured foot in Game 3. Olerud pinch hit in Game 
7 but struck out after a lengthy at-bat against Pedro Martínez, making 
a rare relief appearance; it was Olerud's last at-bat as a Yankee. On May 
1, 2005, the Boston Red Sox and Olerud agreed to terms on a minor league 
contract. He had been recovering from surgery in November 2004 to repair 
torn ligaments in his left foot. Initially, Olerud reported to the club's 
spring training complex in Fort Myers, Florida. He was added to Boston's 
25-man roster on May 27, sharing time at first base with Kevin Millar and 
batting in the middle of the lineup (including several starts in the clean-up 
spot). On December 6, 2005, Olerud announced his retirement from baseball. 
At the time of his retirement, his 2,239 career hits represented the 143rd-highest 
total in Major League Baseball history. His career .398 OBP ranks 65th 
all-time, and his 500 doubles are 44th all-time. In 2007, Olerud was inducted 
into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2016, Olerud was named 
Pac-12 Player of the Century when the conference released its All-Century 
Baseball team.[9] Olerud lives with his wife Kelly and their children (one 
son and two daughters) in Clyde Hill, Washington.[10] Olerud's father John 
E. Olerud, M.D. also played baseball at Washington State University.[11]
