The 2009 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 127th year in Major 
League Baseball, their 52nd year in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 10th at AT&T Park. After 
four consecutive losing seasons, the team finished in third place in the 
National League West with a 88-74 record, 7 games behind the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Following Peter Magowan's retirement, Bill Neukom served as general 
managing partner of the Giants.[1] After a season with the fewest home 
runs of any team since the 1993 Florida Marlins,[2] general manager Brian 
Sabean said the Giants would attempt to bring in a power hitter as well 
as strengthening a bullpen that held a 4.45 ERA in 2008, fourteenth in 
the National League.[3][4] After leading the National League Wild Card 
race for most of the season, the Giants were ultimately passed by the Colorado 
Rockies. The team finished third in the NL West and second in the Wild 
Card. Though they missed the playoffs, the Giants surpassed most expectations 
for their season; for example, Sports Illustrated projected that the Giants 
would finish with a record of 77â€“85.[5] Sports Illustrated's Lee Jenkins 
noted San Francisco's promising farm system (including products Pablo Sandoval 
and Madison Bumgarner) and the perceived weakness of the NL West as reasons 
to be optimistic about the Giants' potential.[6] Additionally, the Giants' 
starting rotation boasted three Cy Young Award winners: Randy Johnson, 
Tim Lincecum, and Barry Zito. After the season ended, Lincecum won his 
second straight Cy Young.[7] The Giants would build on their surprising 
2009 season the following year, winning the World Series. It would be their 
first in San Francisco. Infielders Outfielders Coaches Note: G = Games
