Harold Craig Reynolds (born November 26, 1960) is a former Major League 
Baseball second baseman. He played from 1983 to 1994, primarily for the 
Seattle Mariners, and later for the Baltimore Orioles and California Angels. 
Since his retirement, he has become a well known television analyst, working 
for MLB Network and Fox Sports. Born in Eugene, Oregon,[1] Reynolds was 
raised in Corvallis and starred in football, basketball, and baseball at 
Corvallis High School. He was a member of the state championship (AAA) 
football team in 1978, graduated in 1979, and was inducted into the Oregon 
Sports Hall of Fame in 1998.[2] He was a member of Corvallis' American 
Legion baseball team that won state and regional titles in August 1978.[3] 
Although Reynolds was selected in the 6th round of the 1979 amateur draft 
by the San Diego Padres on June 5, he elected not to sign and played college 
baseball at Cañada College in Redwood City, California. In the 1980 draft 
on June 3, Reynolds was selected in the 1st round (2nd pick) of the amateur 
draft (Secondary Phase) by the Seattle Mariners. On June 1, 2013 Reynolds 
was inducted into the Cañada College Hall of Fame and was presented with 
the "Colts Lifetime Achievement Award". Reynolds spent several seasons 
in the minor leagues, playing for the Wausau Timbers (A) in Wisconsin in 
1981, Lynn Sailors (AA) in Massachusetts in 1982, and Salt Lake Gulls (AAA) 
in Utah in 1983,[4] prior to his major league debut on September 2, 1983. 
The following season, he played AAA ball in Salt Lake before being called 
up again in September 1984. The 1985 season was his official rookie season 
in Major League Baseball. Reynolds was an All-Star in 1987 and 1988, led 
the American League in stolen bases with 60 in 1987, in triples with 11 
in 1988, and in at-bats with 642 in 1990. He was the only player other 
than Rickey Henderson to lead the American League in stolen bases during 
any season in the 1980s. In 1986, he played in Puerto Rico with the Mayagüez 
Indians. In 1991, Reynolds won the Roberto Clemente Award, given annually 
to a Major League Baseball player selected for his character and charitable 
contributions to his community. On Oct. 26, 1992, Reynolds was granted 
free agency and signed with the Baltimore Orioles that December. After 
one season with the Orioles, he again entered free agency on Oct. 29, 1993. 
Reynolds signed with the San Diego Padres on Jan. 28, 1994, before being 
traded to the California Angels that March for Hilly Hathaway. The 1994 
season was Reynolds' final season in the major leagues. During a 12-year 
baseball career, Reynolds batted .258 with 1,233 hits and 353 runs batted 
in. A superb fielder, Reynolds regularly led the league in double plays 
turned and won three Gold Glove awards for his play at second base. Reynolds 
was a lead studio analyst on ESPN's Baseball Tonight from 1996–2006. He 
would appear at major baseball events on the ESPN set including the All-Star 
Game and the World Series. He also was a commentator for ESPN's coverage 
of the College World Series and Little League World Series. He was also 
a two time winning coach in the Taco Bell All Star Celebrity Softball game 
held during the MLB All Star break. He was known for telling his players 
to "let it all hang out."[citation needed] On July 24, 2006, Harold Reynolds 
was fired from ESPN. The ESPN spokeswoman confirmed that Reynolds "is no 
longer with the network" but did not give a reason for the departure.[5] 
"Three people who work at ESPN and familiar with the case said the cause 
was a pattern of sexual harassment."[6] Reynolds called this incident "a 
total misunderstanding" and that "I gave a woman a hug and I felt like 
it was misinterpreted."[7] It was announced on October 30, 2006, that Reynolds 
planned to sue ESPN after having tried "everything possible to handle this 
situation quietly behind the scenes", while stating that he is seeking 
the money owed to him under the remainder of his contract, including interest 
and lost earnings.[8] The Smoking Gun obtained a copy of Reynolds' contract 
that was filed as part of the lawsuit. Reynolds' lawsuit is for $5 million, 
roughly equivalent to the value of the contract Reynolds signed that was 
scheduled to cover the 2006–2011 seasons.[9] ESPN settled the case in April 
2008, giving Reynolds a seven figure settlement (Portland Tribune, April 
29, 2008). On June 11, 2007, Reynolds officially joined MLB.com as a baseball 
commentator.[10] Reynolds settled his lawsuit with ESPN on April 16, 2008. 
Nine days later, Reynolds officially joined Mets pre-game and post-game 
coverage on SportsNet New York as a baseball commentator.[11] Reynolds 
also worked with TBS on their Sunday baseball telecasts, as well as the 
2008 MLB Playoffs. Since its launch on January 1, 2009, Reynolds has been 
an analyst on MLB Network.[12] Reynolds regularly appears on MLB Tonight, 
Quick Pitch, Diamond Demo and MLB Network's breaking news and special event 
coverage, including the All-Star Game, Postseason and World Series. He 
also stars in a new show alongside Brian Kenny titled MLB Now. The new 
series airs Monday thru Friday on MLB Network. Reynolds was nominated for 
a Sports Emmy Award for his work as a studio analyst on MLB Network in 
2010 and 2011. Reynolds became a member of the MLB on Fox pregame show 
in 2012, which at the time was being produced out of MLB Network's studios. 
Reynolds worked on Fox's pregame show for two years alongside Matt Vasgersian 
and Kevin Millar. With the retirement of Fox's lead analyst Tim McCarver 
following the 2013 season, Reynolds, along with Tom Verducci, was promoted 
to join Joe Buck on the network's top broadcast team. Following criticism 
over Reynolds's commentary (many claiming he was not suited for the broadcast 
booth), he and Verducci were replaced with John Smoltz for the 2016 season. 
Reynolds provides an in-game tutorial on how to hit, field, and pitch in 
the Triple Play Baseball and MVP Baseball series. He has also started an 
organization called HR Enterprises.[13] Reynolds' brother Don is a former 
outfielder who played parts of two seasons with the San Diego Padres.[14]
