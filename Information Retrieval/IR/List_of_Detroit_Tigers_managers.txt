The Detroit Tigers are a professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan. 
The Tigers are members of the American League Central Division in Major 
League Baseball. In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, 
or more formally, the field manager. The duties of the team manager include 
team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[1][2] The team initially 
began in the now defunct Western League in 1894, and later became one of 
the American League's eight charter franchises in 1901. Since the inception 
of the team in 1894, it has employed 46 different managers.[3] The Tigers 
current manager is Brad Ausmus, who was hired for the 2014 season.[4] The 
franchise's first manager after the team's arrival in the American League 
was George Stallings, who managed the team for one season. Hall of Famer 
Hughie Jennings, who managed the team from 1907 to 1920, led the team to 
three American League championships. Jennings however was unable to win 
the World Series, losing to the Chicago Cubs in 1907 and 1908 and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in 1909. The Detroit Tigers did not win their first World Series 
until 1935 under the leadership of player-manager Mickey Cochrane. Steve 
O'Neill later led the Tigers to another World Series victory again in 1945. 
The Tigers would not win another World Series until 1968 World Series when 
the Tigers, led by Mayo Smith, defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. Sparky 
Anderson's 1984 Detroit Tigers team was the franchise's last World Series 
victory, and marked the first time in Major League Baseball history that 
a manager won the World Series in both leagues. In total, the Tigers have 
won the American League pennant 10 times, and the World Series 4 times. 
The longest tenured Tiger manager was Sparky Anderson. Anderson managed 
the team for 2,579 games from 1979 to 1995. Hughie Jennings, Bucky Harris 
and Jim Leyland are the only other Detroit Tiger managers who have managed 
the team for more than 1,000 games. Anderson's 1331 wins and 1248 losses 
also lead all Tiger managers, while Cochrane's winning percentage of .582 
is the highest of any Tiger manager who has managed at least one full-season. 
Seven Hall of Famers have managed the Tigers: Ed Barrow, Jennings, Ty Cobb, 
Cochrane, Joe Gordon, Bucky Harris and Anderson. Barrow was elected as 
an executive, Jennings and Anderson were elected as managers; the others
