Through 1987, the College World Series was a pure double-elimination event. 
The format was changed in 1988, when the tournament was divided into two 
four-team double-elimination brackets, with the survivors of each bracket 
playing in a single championship game. The single-game championship was 
designed for network television, with the final game on CBS on Saturday 
afternoon. In 2003, the tournament returned entirely to cable television 
on ESPN, which had been covering all of the other games of the CWS since 
1982 (and a partial schedule since 1980).[1] The championship final became 
a best-of-three series between the two bracket winners, with games scheduled 
for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings. In the results shown here, Score 
indicates the score of the championship game(s) only. The following is 
a list of the American television networks and announcers that have broadcast 
the College World Series. Note: ESPN aired some of these games on ESPN2[13]
