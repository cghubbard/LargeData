In baseball, a double is the act of a batter striking the pitched ball 
and safely reaching second base without being called out by the umpire, 
without the benefit of a fielder's misplay (see error) or another runner 
being put out on a fielder's choice. Typically, a double is a well-hit 
ball into the outfield that either finds the "gap" between the center fielder 
and one of the corner outfielders, bounces off the outfield wall and down 
into the field of play, or is hit up one of the two foul lines. To hit 
many doubles, one must have decent hitting skill and power; it also helps 
to run well enough to beat an outfield throw. Doubles typically drive in 
runs from third base, second base, and even from first base at times. When 
total bases and slugging percentages are calculated, the number two is 
used for the calculation. The all-time leader in doubles is Tris Speaker, 
with 792. A two-base hit awarded by an umpire when a batted ball is hit 
fairly and bounces out of play is referred to as a ground rule double. 
The batter is awarded second base and any runners advance two bases from 
the base they occupied at the time of the pitch. Prior to 1931, such hits 
were considered home runs. A two-base hit awarded because the batter hit 
into a special situation defined in the ground rules is also defined as 
a ground rule double. An example of this occurs where the rules of Chicago's 
Wrigley Field award a ground rule double if a batted ball is lost in the 
vines on the outfield bleacher wall. The rules of the Hubert H. Humphrey 
Metrodome in Minneapolis awarded a ground rule double if the ball became 
stuck in its Teflon ceiling. This happened only once in major league baseball—Dave 
Kingman hit a ball into the ceiling during a 1984 game. Only five players 
in major league history have reached 50 or more doubles in a season at 
least three times: Tris Speaker (1912, 1920–21, 1923, 1926), Paul Waner 
(1928, 1932, 1936), Stan Musial (1944, 1946, 1953), Brian Roberts (2004, 
2008–09) and Albert Pujols (2003–04, 2012). Individual season leaders:
