Dennis Lawrence "Dan" McGann (July 15, 1871 – December 13, 1910), also 
known as Cap McGann, was a professional baseball player who played first 
base in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1896 to 1908. He was a member 
of the NL pennant-winning Brooklyn Superbas in 1899 and New York Giants 
in 1904 and 1905. He was also a member of the 1905 World Series champions. 
After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball in 1895, 
McGann played in MLB for the Boston Beaneaters (1896), Baltimore Orioles 
(1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899), Washington Senators (1899), and St. Louis 
Cardinals (1900–1901) of the National League (NL) before jumping to the 
rival American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles in 1902. He returned 
to the NL, playing for the New York Giants (1902–1907) and Boston Doves 
(1908). In 1909–10, he played for the Milwaukee Brewers in the American 
Association. McGann had a troubled personal life. He suffered from depression, 
and several members of his family committed suicide. After the 1910 season, 
with rumors of McGann signing with another minor league team, McGann committed 
suicide with a firearm. McGann began his professional baseball career in 
minor league baseball with a team representing his hometown, Shelbyville, 
Kentucky, in 1891. He also played for Kentucky teams representing Harrodsburg 
in 1892, Lexington in 1893, and Maysville in 1894.[1][2] McGann played 
for the Norfolk Clams/Crows of the Class-B Virginia State League in 1895 
and the Lynchburg Hill Climbers of the Class-B Virginia League in 1896. 
He initially played all positions except for pitcher, catcher, and first 
baseman.[1] In August 1896, the Boston Beaneaters of the National League 
(NL) purchased McGann from Lynchburg to fill in for injured second baseman 
Bobby Lowe. McGann batted .322 with the Beaneaters, hitting for power, 
but he committed 21 errors in 43 games. The Beaneaters released him following 
the completion of the season.[1] McGann played the 1897 season with the 
Toronto Canucks of the Class-A Eastern League. He moved to first base and 
batted .354, leading the Eastern League with 20 triples.[1] The Washington 
Senators of the NL purchased McGann, Butts Wagner, Bob McHale and Cooney 
Snyder from Toronto for $8,500 ($242,182 in current dollar terms) on September 
22, 1897. The Senators traded McGann with Gene DeMontreville and Doc McJames 
to the Baltimore Orioles of the NL for Doc Amole, Jack Doyle and Heinie 
Reitz that December.[3] He played one season with the Orioles, in which 
he batted .301 with 106 runs batted in (RBI) in 1898, good for fifth place 
in the NL.[1] When Orioles manager Ned Hanlon was hired to manage the Brooklyn 
Superbas during the 1899 season, receiving an ownership stake in the team 
to do so, he assigned several of his star players, including McGann, Joe 
McGinnity, Joe Kelley, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler to the Superbas.[4] 
McGann finished second on the team in RBIs with 106, behind Kelley.[1] 
McGann batted .243 for the Superbas through July 14, 1899, when they traded 
him with Aleck Smith to the Senators for Deacon McGuire.[1] For the Senators, 
McGann batted .343 during the rest of the 1899 season.[1] Short on money, 
the Senators sold McGann and Gus Weyhing to the St. Louis Cardinals for 
$5,000 ($142,460 in current dollar terms) on March 9, 1900.[1] McGann left 
the Cardinals before the end of 1901 season, for unknown reasons.[5] The 
Cardinals replaced McGann with Bill Richardson.[6] With the formation of 
the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, McGann joined many 
fellow NL players who jumped to the AL. Following Cardinals teammate John 
McGraw, who became player-manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before 
the 1901 season, McGann signed with the Orioles.[1][7] However, the Orioles 
struggled with debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law 
of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 
($328,754 in current dollar terms).[8] Unable to afford that debt, Mahon 
purchased shares of the team from Kelley and John McGraw. With this, Mahon 
became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares.[9] 
On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, 
principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the 
Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman released McGann, McGraw, 
Cy Seymour, Roger Bresnahan, Joe Kelley, Joe McGinnity, and Jack Cronin 
from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed McGann, Bresnahan, McGinnity 
and Cronin to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants 
ten days earlier. Brush signed Seymour and Kelley to the Reds.[10][11] 
With the Giants, McGraw installed McGann at first base, moving Christy 
Mathewson to pitcher.[1] McGann stole 36 bases in the 1903 season. After 
the season, McGann and some of his Giants teammates threatened to quit 
the team due to the treatment of Brush, now the Giants owner, for allegedly 
going back on a promise to provide the Giants with a monetary bonus for 
having the Giants finish in the top three of the NL and a share of the 
gate receipts from exhibition games, in which they were paid $56.35 ($1,487 
in current dollar terms), though Brush allegedly had made over $200,000 
($5,276,296 in current dollar terms). McGann and Jack Warner were rumored 
to join McGinnity in an outlaw league in California.[12] McGann stole 42 
bases in 1904, finishing fourth in the NL. He stole five bases on May 27, 
1904, setting an NL record.[13] McGann's record stood until Davey Lopes 
stole five bases in a game in 1974, and Otis Nixon stole six in a game 
in 1991.[1] McGann led the team with a .286 batting average and six home 
runs that season.[14] Though the Giants won the NL pennant in 1904, they 
refused to compete in the 1904 World Series. Brush and McGraw refused to 
face the AL champion Boston Pilgrims, following their altercations with 
Johnson.[14][15] McGann developed a reputation as a fighter in 1905. On 
April 21, 1905, in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, McGann punched 
catcher Fred Abbott after McGann was thrown out at home plate. Abbott hit 
McGann in the back with the ball, resulting in both players being ejected 
from the game.[16] McGann batted .299 with 14 triples in 1905 as the Giants 
won NL pennant for the second consecutive year. Competing in the 1905 World 
Series, a series the Giants won over the Philadelphia Athletics in five 
games, McGann contributed with his bat and glove.[17] Although McGann batted 
.235 in the series, he recorded four RBIs on three hits in a Game Three 
victory.[1] McGann was briefly suspended by NL president Harry Pulliam 
for fighting on May 16, 1906.[18] McGann finished first in the NL fielding 
percentage at first base from 1903 through 1906.[1] He also served as Giants' 
team captain.[19][20] Despite this, rumors began to circulate that the 
Giants were looking to trade McGann, which the team denied.[21] Before 
the 1907 season, a report surfaced that the Giants would shift Mike Donlin 
from the outfield to first base, in order to replace McGann. Donlin denied 
the claim.[22] McGann suffered a broken wrist when he was hit by a pitch 
thrown by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds during spring training in 
1907. McGann returned to the Giants out of shape midway through the 1907 
season, although he did bat .298 that season. That winter, trade rumours 
began to swirl that the Giants would trade him to the Reds.[23] Instead, 
the Giants traded McGann to the Boston Doves with Frank Bowerman, George 
Browne, Bill Dahlen and Cecil Ferguson for Al Bridwell, Tom Needham and 
Fred Tenney on December 13, 1907. Tenney, also a first baseman, was designated 
as McGann's replacement at first.[24] When a reporter asked McGraw about 
McGann and Tenney, pointing out that both first basemen were 36 years old, 
McGraw replied that Tenney had taken better care of himself.[1] Despite 
discussion of appointing McGann player-manager of the Doves, the role was 
assigned to Kelley.[25] Agreeing to terms with George Dovey, president 
of the Doves,[26] McGann played 135 games during the 1908 season, but batted 
only .240. During an April 1908 game between the Doves and the Giants, 
McGraw insulted McGann as slow, referring to him as a "damned ice wagon", 
noting "that's how the Giants lost a lot of games last season".[1] After 
the game, McGann went to the Giants' hotel, waited for McGraw to return 
from the theatre, and fought him in a billiard room.[1][27] Dovey released 
McGann from the Doves after the 1908 season.[28] McGann signed with the 
Milwaukee Brewers of the Class-A American Association for the 1909 season.[29][30] 
He played for Milwaukee in 1909 and 1910, batting only .225 in 1910, his 
career low.[1] There were reports McGann might sign with the Oakland Oaks 
of the Pacific Coast League or a team in Louisville, Kentucky, near his 
Shelbyville home in 1911. McGann's career was ended, however, by his death 
in December 1910.[1] McGann invested in real estate and financial holdings 
near his Shelbyville home during his career.[1] At the time of his death, 
his property was assessed to be worth approximately $40,000 ($1,017,571 
in current dollar terms).[31] McGann suffered from severe clinical depression, 
a condition which ran throughout his family. One of McGann's sisters committed 
suicide in 1890 after their mother died. On New Year's Eve in 1907, one 
of McGann's brothers died as a result of an accidental shooting. In 1909, 
another of McGann's brothers committed suicide.[32][33] On December 13, 
1910, McGann committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart at a Louisville 
hotel. At the time of his death, he was 39 years old, and reportedly had 
been "in the best of health and humor" when last seen.[34] McGann was survived 
by two sisters, who, despite the family history of suicide, believed their 
brother had been murdered, as a diamond ring valued at $800 ($20,351 in
