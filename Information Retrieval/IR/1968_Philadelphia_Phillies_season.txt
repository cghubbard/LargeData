The 1968 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in Major League Baseball. 
The Phillies finished eighth in the National League with a record of 76 
wins and 86 losses, 21 games behind the NL pennant-winning Cardinals. The 
Phillies were scheduled to open the 1968 season on April 9, 1968 in Los 
Angeles. However, Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 
1968, leading to days of national unrest. President Johnson declared Monday, 
April 8, a national day of mourning, and the funeral was scheduled for 
April 9. The Dodgers initially refused to postpone the game, leading Phillies 
GM John Quinn and President Bob Carpenter to announce that the Phillies 
would not play on April 9 even under threat of forfeit. On April 7, Quinn 
told reporters, "Under the rules, the game can be forfeited and we could 
be fined. But we have made our final decision. We will not play."[4] In 
consultation with NL President Warren Giles, the Dodgers eventually agreed 
and postponed the game.[5] The Phillies opened April 10, 1968 with a Chris 
Short 2 to 0 shutout of the Dodgers.[6] On July 28, 1968, George Culver 
of the Cincinnati Reds pitched a 6â€“1 no-hitter against the Phillies in 
the second game of a doubleheader at Connie Mack Stadium.[7] Infielders
