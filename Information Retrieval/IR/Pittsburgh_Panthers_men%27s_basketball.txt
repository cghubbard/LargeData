Eastern Eight 1981, 1982 EIC 1933, 1934, 1935, 1937 The Pittsburgh Panthers 
men's basketball is the NCAA Division I intercollegiate men's basketball 
program of the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as "Pitt", located 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pitt men's basketball team competes in 
the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and plays their home games in the Petersen 
Events Center. The Panthers were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA 
Tournament national champion twice by the Helms Athletic Foundation and 
once by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Pitt has reached one Final Four, 
received 15 First Team All-American selections, appeared in 25 NCAA and 
eight National Invitation Tournaments (NIT) and through the 2012–13 season, 
and has recorded 1,577 victories against 1,111 losses since their inaugural 
season of 1905–06. On March 28, 2016, the school announced the hiring of 
Kevin Stallings as coach after the departure of Jamie Dixon.[2] The University 
of Pittsburgh began playing men's basketball in 1905–06 under coach Benjamin 
Printz. The University did not field a team during the 1909–10 and 1910–11 
seasons. The program was resurrected in 1911 under head coach Wohlparth 
Wegner, and the following year Dr. George M. Flint assumed head coaching 
duties and began rebuilding Pitt's program essentially from the ground 
up. Flint led the Panthers to eight winning seasons during his ten years 
at the helm and coached future Pitt coach H. C. Carlson. Henry Clifford 
"Doc" Carlson, MD took over as coach in 1922 and soon turned Pitt into 
a national power. In the era preceding the initiation of national tournaments, 
the Panthers were both contemporaneously[3][4] and later retroactively, 
by the Helms Athletic Foundation (1927–28 and 1929–30) and the Premo-Porretta 
Power Poll (1927–28), regarded as national champions.[5] Those teams were 
led by National Player of the Year, 3-time All-American and Naismith Basketball 
Hall of Fame inductee Charlie Hyatt. Carlson was a ground-breaking coach 
who would be inducted into the Naismith and Helms Foundation Basketball 
Hall of Fames. In the late 1920s, Carlson initiated playing a "national 
schedule" by taking his teams on midwestern road trips that included games 
against several Big Ten schools and, in 1931, is credited as the first 
coach to take an Eastern team out west.[6] He also developed the widely 
emulated Figure Eight Offense and also experimented with various conditioning 
techniques, including the use of oxygen on the bench. Under Carlson, and 
led by two-time All-American Claire Cribbs, Pitt continued success through 
the 1930s winning four Eastern Intercollegiate Conference Championships. 
In 1935, Pitt, as Eastern Intercollegiate champions representing the best 
of the East, lost a 41–37 season-ending contest to SEC champion LSU in 
the American Legion Bowl in Atlantic City, a game on which LSU bases its 
claim on that season's national championship.[7] On February 28, 1940, 
Pitt played in the first ever televised basketball game, a 57–37 victory 
over Fordham at Madison Square Garden that was televised by NBC station 
W2XBS.[8] Carlson also led Pitt to its first ever NCAA appearance en route 
to the 1941 NCAA Final Four. Carlson's tenure at Pitt's helm lasted for 
30 consecutive years before he retired following the 1952–53 season. Pitt 
moved their competition into the Fitzgerald Field House in 1951, leaving 
the Pitt Pavilion, housed inside of Pitt Stadium. Pitt would continue to 
play in the Fieldhouse until 2002. Robert Timmons took over as head coach 
from Carlson for the 1953–54 season and, led by two-time All-American and 
Helms Foundation Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Don Hennon, appeared 
in two NCAA tournaments during the late 1950s. Timmons also led Pitt to 
an NCAA appearance in 1963 and its first NIT appearance in 1964. Timmons 
was succeeded by head coach Charles "Buzz" Ridl who became famous for his 
'amoebe' defense, an ever changing man to zone match-up defense. With All-American 
Billy Knight, Ridl led Pitt to the Elite Eight in 1974, with early round 
victories over St. Joseph's and Furman. Pitt lost to eventual national 
champion North Carolina State in the Eastern Regional Final (Elite 8) played 
in Raleigh, North Carolina amid a hostile local crowd. This Pitt team was 
filled with local players such as Mickey Martin, Jim Bolla, Tom Richards, 
Keith Starr, Kirk Bruce and Billy Knight, who went on to star in the ABA 
for the Indiana Pacers and with several teams in the NBA. Following the 
graduation of Knight and Martin, Pitt made an NIT appearance the following 
year, Ridl's last before retiring. Pittsburgh native Tim Grgurich, who 
was an assistant coach under Ridl, became Pitt's next head coach. He led 
Pitt into the inaugural 1976–77 season of the Eastern Collegiate Basketball 
League, which would change its name to the Eastern Eight (forerunner to 
the Atlantic 10) the following year. That initial year, Larry Harris, a 
6'6" forward with an impressive outside shot and an ability to score points 
in traffic, won the league scoring title. Grgurich also led Pitt to the 
1980 NIT. Grgurich was succeeded by Lafayette coach Dr. Roy Chipman who 
began Pitt's rollercoaster-like ride back to national significance. In 
his first season at the helm, the Panthers won the Eastern Eight Conference 
Tournament. In the 1981 NCAA Tournament, Pitt defeated Idaho in overtime 
in the first round; they lost to North Carolina in the second round. Chipman's 
Panthers enjoyed similar success the following season, defeating archrival 
West Virginia for their last Eastern Eight Tournament Championship, energized 
by remarks by WVU Coach Gale Catlett.[9] Pitt lost to Pepperdine in the 
first round of the 1982 NCAA Tournament to end Chipman's second season 
and Pitt's last as a member of the Eastern Eight Conference. For the 1982–83 
season, Pitt began play as a member of the Big East Conference. Although 
Chipman would lead Pitt to three more postseason appearances, he was replaced 
by Paul Evans as head coach in 1986–87. Led by All-Americans Charles Smith 
and Jerome Lane, Pitt would capture its first two regular season Big East 
Championships and secure several top 10 rankings reaching as high as number 
two in the nation. However, compared to the expectations of the fans, these 
teams had disappointing showings in their Big East and NCAA tournaments 
appearances. After the departures of Smith and Lane, Pitt basketball continued 
to have a national, if not inconsistent, impact with players such as Sean 
Miller, Brian Shorter, Jerry McCullough, and Eric Mobley. In eight seasons 
as head coach Evans' teams advanced to a total of five NCAA tournaments 
and one NIT. Slumping play led to Evans' departure, and he was replaced 
by Ralph Willard who headed the Pitt program from 1994–95 through 1998–-99. 
Despite highly regarded recruiting classes and stars such as Mark Blount 
and Vonteego Cummings, Pitt advanced to only one NIT in five seasons under 
Willard. Ben Howland was hired as head coach of the Panthers in 1999–00 
and led them to sustained success for 4 seasons. In Howland's second season 
(2000–01), the Pitt team, led by senior standout Ricardo Greer and All-American 
guard Brandin Knight, advanced to the Big East Tournament championship 
game and NIT. In Howland's third (2001–02) and fourth (2002–03) seasons, 
Pitt won back-to-back Big East regular season championships, appeared in 
back-to-back Big East tournament championship games and won the Big East 
tournament in 2003. Pitt advanced to consecutive NCAA tournament Sweet 
Sixteens (2002, 2003). For his success in the 2001–02 season, Howland was 
named the Big East Coach of the Year, Naismith College Coach of the Year, 
and won the Henry Iba Award as best college basketball coach as named by 
the United States Basketball Writers Association. Following the 2003 season, 
Howland left Pitt for the only job he said he would ever contemplate leaving 
Pitt for: the head coach position at UCLA.[10] In 2002, Pitt began their 
first season of play at the 12,508-seat Petersen Events Center which sits 
on the former site of Pitt Stadium. The first opponent at "the Pete", as 
the facility is called by students, was against cross-city rival Duquesne 
University. Jamie Dixon, Howland's assistant at Northern Arizona and Pitt, 
was named head coach of the team in 2003. Under Dixon, the Panthers continued 
the progress begun under Howland, registering a third straight Big East 
regular season championship (2004), a fourth straight appearance in the 
Big East Tournament championship game (Pitt 58, UConn 61) and a third straight 
appearance in the NCAA tournament Sweet Sixteen. With Dixon at the helm, 
Pitt's success continued with frequent national rankings, four Big East 
tournament championship game appearances in five seasons (2004, 2006, 2007 
2008), a Big East Tournament Championship in 2008, and NCAA tournament 
appearances in nine of ten years under Dixon's leadership (2004–11, 2013), 
including trips to the Sweet Sixteen (2004, 2007, 2009) and Elite Eight 
(2009). The 2008–09 season was notable for several historic accomplishments. 
The Panthers were ranked #1 in the Associated Press poll and ESPN/USA Today 
Coaches' poll for the first time in school history, claiming the #1 spot 
for a total of three weeks. On February 16, 2009, the #4 ranked Panthers 
defeated the # ranked UConn Huskies, 76–68, for Pitt's first-ever win versus 
a #1 ranked team. The Panthers repeated the feat on March 7, 2009, when 
the #3 ranked Panthers again defeated #1 ranked UConn again, 70–60, for 
Pitt's second-ever win versus a #1 ranked team. In doing so, Pitt became 
only the seventh school in NCAA Division I history to defeat two #1 ranked 
teams in the same season. On Selection Sunday, March 15, 2009, the Panthers 
received their first ever No.1 seed (East Region) in the 2009 NCAA Tournament. 
They reached the Elite Eight for the first time since 1974. Pitt's 76–78 
last second loss to fellow Big East Conference foe Villanova in the East 
Regional final for a trip to the Final Four became an instant classic. 
In 2009, Dixon broke the record for the most victories in the first six 
seasons as a Division I head coach and won the Naismith Coach of the Year 
award. The success of the 2008–09 season continued over to the 2009–10 
season, somewhat unexpectedly. Having lost the talents of Sam Young, DeJuan 
Blair and Levance Fields, the Panthers were picked in a pre-season Big 
East poll to finish ninth in the conference. Instead, Pitt earned a 13–5 
Big East record, good enough for a second seed in the Big East tournament, 
received a third seed in the NCAA Tournament, and finished 25–9 overall 
record. In 2010–11, Pitt won the regular season Big East title and, for 
a second time in the program's history, earned a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. 
The program achieved a school record 10-straight seasons with at least 
20 overall wins, 10 conference wins, and an NCAA Tournament appearance 
from 2002 through 2011. Dixon, who has been named as a national coach of 
the year in three separate seasons, guided Pitt to NCAA Tournament appearances 
in his first eight seasons as head coach, and is the only head coach in 
school history to guide Pitt to eight NCAA Tournament appearances (2004–2011). 
The Atlantic Coast Conference announced in September 2011 that Pitt and 
Syracuse would be leaving the Big East and had been accepted as members 
of the ACC, which would grow from 12 to 14 teams.[11] Pitt officially joined 
the ACC on July 1, 2013.[12] In 2011–12, Pitt failed to qualify for the 
NCAA Tournament, but managed to again surpass 20 wins for the 11th consecutive 
season and qualify for the College Basketball Invitational for a 12th consecutive 
post-season appearance. Pitt defeated Washington State in the Finals in 
a best 2 out of 3 format to win the post-season tournament. Dixon's record 
at Pitt stood at 262 wins and 86 losses (.753 win percentage) in ten seasons 
(2003–04 through 2012–13), second in school history behind only Carlson. 
His league record of 127–66 in ten seasons made him the winningest coach 
in Big East history with a .658 winning percentage in league games and 
tournaments. . On March 31, 2010, Pitt extended Dixon's contract by two 
years, making him Pitt's head coach through 2017–18 season. Dixon signed 
another contract extension on March 23, 2013. This extension ran through 
the 2022–2023 season. Upon the extension, Dixon commented saying that his 
intentions were to "finish his career at the University of Pittsburgh."[13] 
Dixon, however, departed to take the head coaching position at his alma 
mater, TCU, in March 2016.[14] On March 28, 2016, the school hired Vanderbilt 
head coach Kevin Stallings to fill the vacant head coaching position.[2] 
The fiercest rivalry was with former Big East Conference member West Virginia 
University in the basketball version of the Backyard Brawl, an extension 
of the football rivalry. Adding to the importance of the game, Pitt and 
West Virginia shared membership in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference 
(1933–1939),[15] the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League West Division 
(1977),[16] Eastern 8 Conference(1978–1982),[17] and the Big East Conference 
(1996–2012). In addition, the two rivals have tangled in the last games 
played at three of their respective arenas: on February 26, 1951, Pitt 
defeated WVU 74–72 in the closing seconds of the last college game played 
at the Pitt Pavilion inside Pitt Stadium; on March 3, 1970, Pitt upset 
WVU 92–87 in the last game played at the West Virginia University Field 
House in Morgantown; and on March 2, 2002, Pitt defeated WVU 92–65 in Pitt's 
last game at Fitzgerald Field House. The rivalry with West Virginia is 
now dormant due to WVU's move to the Big 12 Conference. The Panthers also 
have a sustained rivalry with crosstown opponent Duquesne University in 
the City Game. Peaking in ferocity from 1977–1982 when both were members 
of the Eastern Eight Conference, the rivalry has diminished somewhat since 
Pitt's move to the Big East Conference in 1982.[18] In addition to their 
rivalry with West Virginia, Pitt had several rivals in the Big East Conference: 
Pitt men's basketball teams of 1927–28 (21–0) and 1929–30 (23–2) were recognized 
as national champions both popularly[21] and by the Helms Athletic Foundation.[22] 
These teams of "Doc" Carlson, led by three-time All-American and two-time 
National Scoring Champion Charley Hyatt, played a "national" schedule that 
during the 1927–28 season that included the following wins:[23] The 1929–30 
national championship team racked up wins that included the following: 
Although there was no NCAA Tournament at that time, there were contests 
billed as "National Championship Games". The 1930 game in particular helped 
Pittsburgh legend Charley Hyatt cement his place in history by scoring 
27 points, including a last second game-winning shot, at the defending 
national champions and assumed #1 squad Montana State.[24] Starting with 
the NCAA rule change regarding exempt tournaments in the 2006–2007 season, 
Pitt has participated in an event every year. The Panthers have appeared 
in the NCAA Tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 23–26. NCAA Tournament 
Seeding History The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. 
The Panthers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 
nine times. Their combined record is 6–9. The Panthers have appeared in 
the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) one time. Their record is 5–1 
and they were CBI champions in 2012. 1932–33 Eastern Intercollegiate Champions

Pitt was the only team in Big East Conference history to reach the Big 
East Championship Game seven times in eight seasons having earned a trip 
to the title game in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2008.[1] Pitt 
played in the Eastern 8 Tournament Championship games in 1979, 1981, and 
1982. Charley Hyatt won the National Player of the Year in 1929–30, he 
was the America's leading scorer that season (his second time as leading 
scorer) and made a last second basket to win the National Title Game with 
27 points against what many considered the best team in the country. This 
season was also to be the third consecutive time he had earned consensus 
All-American status (the second time he won the honor owing to him being 
in the inaugural class of consensus in his second season). Three inductees 
represent the University of Pittsburgh in the Helms Foundation Basketball 
Hall of Fame; two of them, Carlson and Hyatt, are also represented in the 
Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball 
Hall of Fame. Both Carlson and Hyatt were selected as the first class inducted 
to each hall.[27][28] Thirteen different Pitt players have received All-American 
honors 14 unique season. Pitt players have been named First Team† All-Americans 
15 times, Second Team All-Americans seven times, and Third Team All-Americans 
six times. In addition, players have been named as Freshman All-Americans 
four times and Honorable Mention All-Americans six times. A Pitt player 
has achieved Consensus First Team All-American, as listed in the Official 
NCAA Records Book, on nine different occasions. Charley Hyatt and Sykes 
Reed, who together lead Pitt to an undefeated national championship season, 
were Pitt's first Consensus All-Americans in 1928. The other consensus 
first-team All-Americans include Don Smith, Claire Cribbs, Don Hennon, 
and DeJuan Blair.[29] In addition, Don Hennon, Billy Knight and Jerome 
Lane received Consensus Second Team All-American status.[30] Honorable 
Mention All-Americans   Freshman All-Americans Two Pitt players have earned 
Academic All-American status from the College Sports Information Directors 
of America.[35] Three Pitt players have earned the NCAA Postgraduate Scholarships 
which are awarded annually to select student-athletes who excel academically 
and athletically and who are in their final year of intercollegiate athletics 
competition.[36] Four players have had their jerseys retired at Pitt. 41 
total Panther players have achieved the 1,000 points club. Of these, fourteen 
total Panther players have scored over 1,500 points in their career. Two 
of these Panther players, Charles Smith and Clyde Vaughan, scored over 
2,000 points in their career. Stats updated through February 5, 2014. Pittsburgh 
Panthers have been selected 27 times in the NBA draft, 3 times in the ABA 
draft (Billy Knight was drafted by both the NBA and ABA in 1974). In addition, 
11 former Panthers were selected in the CBA draft. Seven Panthers have 
been selected as first-round NBA draft picks with Steven Adams being the 
most recent in 2013. In addition, 48 former Panthers have played professionally 
in international basketball leagues. Clyde Vaughan especially stands out 
in averaging 28 points per game over his decade-long basketball career
