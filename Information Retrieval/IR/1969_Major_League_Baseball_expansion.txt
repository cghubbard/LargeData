The 1969 Major League Baseball expansion resulted in the establishment 
of expansion franchises in Kansas City and Seattle in the American League 
and in Montreal and San Diego in the National League of Major League Baseball. 
The Kansas City Royals, Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Seattle Pilots 
began play in the 1969 Major League Baseball season. One of the reasons 
for expansion was increasing pressure to maintain the sport as the US national 
pastime, particularly because of the increasing popularity of professional 
football.[1] As a result of expansion, the American and National Leagues 
reorganized. Each league was split into two divisions, forming the American 
League East, American League West, National League East, and National League 
West.[2] Other candidate cities that were considered in 1967 included Buffalo, 
Dallas–Fort Worth, and Milwaukee.[3] The latter two were rejected because 
they were close to cities that already had a Major League Baseball team 
(Houston and Chicago, respectively).[3] In May 1966, Commissioner of Baseball 
William Eckert stated that cities that should be considered for expansion 
included Milwaukee (the Milwaukee Braves had moved to Atlanta before the 
1966 season), New Orleans, Oakland, San Diego, Seattle, and Toronto, and 
that expansion would occur in "eight to ten years";[4] he subsequently 
stated that the leagues could expand "any time after two years".[5] By 
August, Major League Baseball had plans to expand to two 12-team leagues 
by 1970, and had squelched the possibility of a third league,[6] such as 
the Continental League proposed in 1959 or the proposal made in August 
1968 by Ron Plaza consisting of an Eastern, Central, and Western League.[7] 
In 1960, the American League conducted a survey to determine potential 
expansion cities. The list included Atlanta, Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, 
Denver, Oakland, San Diego, Seattle, and Toronto.[8] Kansas City had been 
the home to the Kansas City Athletics from 1955, when the team moved from 
Philadelphia, to 1967, after which the team moved to Oakland. For several 
years, owner Charlie Finley had threatened to leave the city: in May and 
September 1962 to Dallas–Fort Worth;[9][10] in January 1964 he signed a 
contract with the state of Kentucky to move the team to Louisville and 
rename the team Kentucky Athletics;[11] and in February 1964 he wanted 
to move the team to Oakland. A committee of American League owners denied 
his requests.[12] In October 1967, with the team's lease at Municipal Stadium 
expired,[13] Finley once again proposed to move the franchise to Oakland, 
this time at the owner's meetings in Chicago. During the first ballot of 
the committee of American League owners on October 18,[13] he received 
six supporting votes, one opposing vote (from the Baltimore Orioles), and 
the Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees, and Washington Senators abstained 
from voting. American League president Joe Cronin requested a second ballot, 
in which the New York Yankees were the only team to change their status, 
opting to support the move and giving Finley "the seven votes necessary 
to move the team".[14] In a press release, Cronin announced the move and 
promised to expand the league by two more clubs no later than 1971.[15] 
The Oakland Athletics began play in the 1968 Major League Baseball season. 
Cronin conveyed the news to Kansas City mayor Ilus Davis and Stuart Symington, 
a Senator from Missouri. Cronin had thought that the compromise to install 
a new team by 1971 would be acceptable to them as compensation for the 
loss of the Athletics. Instead, Symington threatened to challenge Major 
League Baseball's antitrust exemption with federal legislation,[14] and 
to also challenge the reserve clause. Davis threatened a lawsuit to block 
the move.[13] Tom Yawkey arranged a meeting of the owners still at the 
convention, during which the league agreed to accelerate the expansion 
process and assured that Kansas City would be granted a new franchise to 
begin play no later than the 1969 season.[15] This would require another 
franchise to be established at the same time to ensure the league had an 
even number of teams for a balanced schedule.[16] On the floor of the United 
States Senate on October 19, Symington described Finley as "one of the 
most disreputable characters ever to enter the American sports scene" and 
that "Oakland is the luckiest city since Hiroshima".[17] Ewing Kauffman 
won rights to the franchise, and paid a $5.5 million expansion fee for 
the Royals, which played games at Municipal Stadium[2] until the end of 
the 1972 season, after which the team moved to Royals Stadium, now known 
as Kauffman Stadium. By the 1960s, with Seattle's population growing, the 
city became the largest to host a Pacific Coast League team, the Seattle 
Rainiers.[16] The league's stature also declined with the move of the Brooklyn 
Dodgers to Los Angeles and the New York Giants to San Francisco, which 
caused those cities' PCL teams to fold.[16] In 1964, the city purchased 
Sick's Stadium for $1.1 million.[16] In 1965, the Rainiers were sold to 
the Los Angeles Angels, who renamed the team the Seattle Angels. The city 
made several attempts to lure a Major League Baseball team. In 1964, William 
R. Daley visited the city when searching for a new home for the Cleveland 
Indians. He was unimpressed with the stadium, citing it as the primary 
reason to terminate his quest to move his team.[16] Charlie Finley also 
found the stadium inadequate during a 1967 visit, and so rejected Seattle 
as a potential target for moving the Kansas City Athletics.[16] Because 
of this, the city instead tried to lobby for an expansion franchise at 
the 1967 owner's meetings in Chicago.[16] The delegation also had support 
from two Congressmen, Henry M. Jackson and Warren Magnuson, the latter 
of whom was the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, a committee 
which has "jurisdiction over the major league’s business activities".[16] 
Coupled with Symington's threats related to the move of the Kansas City 
Athletics, the political influence swayed the American League owners. However, 
they were reluctant to expand in 1969 without a Seattle stadium bond issue.[15] 
The Seattle delegation assured the owners that Sick's Stadium could be 
renovated in five months to fulfill the minimum requirements until a new 
stadium was built; with this, the owners agreed to a 1969 expansion, and 
approved teams in Kansas City and Seattle.[15] In December 1967 at the 
Winter Meetings in Mexico City, the franchise was officially awarded to 
Pacific Northwest Sports, which received $5.5 million in funding from Daley, 
who thus had 47% ownership of the venture.[16] Other owners included Max 
and Dewey Soriano. The award was contingent on renovation of Sick's Stadium 
to increase its seating capacity from 11,000 to 30,000 by the start of 
the 1969 season.[16] The Sorianos persuaded notable athletes to advocate 
for the $40 million King County stadium bond issue, including baseball 
players Mickey Mantle, Carl Yastrzemski, Joe DiMaggio, and football player 
Y. A. Tittle; the bond issue was approved by 62.3% of the electorate.[18][16] 
The National League had received applications for an expansion franchise 
from Buffalo, Dallas–Fort Worth, Milwaukee, Montreal, San Diego, and Toronto 
as well as an informal bid from Denver.[19] Montreal had a long history 
of interest in baseball. The sport became increasingly popular in eastern 
North America in the 1850s and 1860s, and Montreal "became a special hotbed",[20] 
so much so that by the early 1860s Montreal authorities banned play in 
city parks and streets for public safety.[21] Minor league baseball became 
a presence in the city. In 1946, the Montreal Royals, a Triple-A team affiliated 
with the Brooklyn Dodgers of Major League Baseball, became the first team 
having any affiliation to MLB to break baseball's colour barrier. Jackie 
Robinson, who had been signed to a contract by Branch Rickey in late 1945, 
played the entire season for the International League team.[22] He and 
teammates Roy Partlow and Johnny Wright were the first black players in 
the league since the 1880s.[23][24] The next year, Robinson became the 
first black player to play for a Major League Baseball team. In 1951 in 
Farnham, a town east of Montreal, Sam Bankhead became the first black manager 
in Minor League Baseball;[23] he was a player-manager for the Farnham Pirates 
of the Provincial League that year.[25] Montreal City Councilor Gerry Snyder 
spoke to Ford Frick sometime after the 1962 Major League Baseball expansion, 
during which he was told Montreal would not receive an expansion franchise 
unless it had a stadium in which to contest matches.[26] At the Winter 
Meetings in Mexico City on December 2, 1967, Snyder presented a proposal 
to Major League Baseball owners to establish a franchise in the city.[27] 
Several influential owners pledged their support for a Montreal franchise 
in that meeting, including Walter O'Malley, Roy Hofheinz, and John Galbreath.[26] 
Certain that Hofheinz would object to a Dallas–Fort Worth bid and that 
the San Diego bid was near certain to be successful, Snyder deemed a bid 
from Buffalo to be the strongest bid against which to compete. On 27 May 
1968, the National League officially awarded a franchise to Montreal to 
commence play in the 1969 season.[27] National League president Warren 
Giles had encouraged the owners during the meeting, stating "If we're going 
to expand, let's really spread it out".[3] The Montreal Expos became the 
first franchise to be awarded to a city outside the United States. When 
the news reached Congress, congressmen collectively condemned the decision.[26] 
Because of the slow pace of progress in meeting commitments, Jean-Louis 
Lévesque withdrew his financial support in the franchise on July 31, 1968. 
Snyder quickly found another investor, Charles Bronfman, and the team met 
the deadline of 15 August for the initial $1.1 million installment, before 
which Jarry Park was selected as the team's stadium for the short term.[26] 
Renovations to the park were made by adding uncovered bleacher seats along 
the right and left field lines, and an electronic scoreboard installed 
beyond right field.[28] The team had some issues committing to a new stadium, 
as required by the franchise award, and it was said that the team had agreed 
to build a dome at the Autostade and use it as their stadium if a new stadium 
was not built by 1970.[29] It had originally intended to lease the stadium 
and expand its seating capacity from 26,000 to 37,000,[29] but then chose 
Jarry Park instead. The ownership group paid $12.5 million for the team.[30] 
John McHale was hired as the team's first president,[31] and Jim Fanning 
its first general manager.[26] Many names had been considered for the team, 
including Royals which had a strong association with the city, but the 
name had already been adopted by the new Kansas City franchise. After rejecting 
various options, including "Voyageurs" and "Nationals", the name Expos 
was chosen in honour of Expo 67[28] and because it was the same in both 
of the city's official languages.[26] McHale stated that the name would 
"help Montreal be identified properly as the city that gave the world Expo 
67".[26] The New York Daily mistakenly reported that Buffalo had been awarded 
a franchise instead of Montreal.[32] On May 27, 1968, the National League 
officially awarded a franchise to San Diego to commence play in the 1969 
season[27] for a fee of $12.5 million for the team.[30] Buzzie Bavasi was 
hired as president of the team after he resigned as general manager of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers.[33] In order to stock the roster of each team, 
a draft was held in which each of the extant teams would make available 
to the expansion franchises some of the players on their major league and 
minor league rosters. Each expansion team selected 30 players in the draft, 
and each of the extant teams lost six players. The extant teams were allowed 
to protect 15 players in their organization from the draft.[34] After each 
player lost, another three players could be protected.[35][36] The extant 
teams were not informed of the draft selections of the expansion teams 
until the draft was complete.[36] On October 14, 1968, the Montreal Expos 
and San Diego Padres drafted players exclusively from National League teams. 
The draft was conducted from the Windsor Hotel in Montreal, in which four 
rooms were reserved: one for the Expos, one for the Padres, one for the 
remaining 10 teams, and one in which draft selections were made.[36] The 
Padres won a coin flip,[37] and so had the first selection, which they 
used to draft Ollie Brown from the San Francisco Giants.[38] Montreal's 
first selection was Pittsburgh Pirates utility player Manny Mota.[38] Selections 
were made by general manager Jim Fanning and manager Gene Mauch for Montreal, 
and general manager Buzzie Bavasi and manager Preston Gómez for San Diego.[34] 
On 15 October, the Kansas City Royals and Seattle Pilots drafted players 
exclusively from American League teams. The draft was conducted in Boston,[36][38] 
at the Sheraton Hotel. Because Buffalo was not awarded an expansion franchise, 
Erie County legislators reconsidered a $50 million bond issue that was 
to be used for the construction of a domed stadium for baseball and football.[39] 
The applicants that submitted a bid for Dallas–Fort Worth claimed that 
Roy Hofheinz, owner of the Houston Astros, had blocked their bid in order 
to preserve Houston's radio and television broadcast revenue.[39] Chicago 
White Sox owner Arthur Allyn, Jr. complained about his team being in the 
same division as two expansion franchises.[40] The addition of four teams 
resulted in the reconfiguration of the leagues; each was split into an 
east and a west division.[1][3] The American League announced its realignment 
into two divisions on 28 May 1968;[41] the American League East would consist 
of the Baltimore Orioles, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, 
New York Yankees and Washington Senators, and the American League West 
would consist of the California Angels, Chicago White Sox, Kansas City 
Royals, Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, and Seattle Pilots.[41] The 
National League originally resisted a divisional split, with its president 
Warren Giles citing "the tradition and history of baseball".[41] By July 
10, the National League owners had agreed to a divisional split, in which 
the National League East would consist of the Chicago Cubs, Montreal Expos, 
New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis 
Cardinals, and the National League West would consist of the Atlanta Braves, 
Cincinnati Reds, Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, 
and San Francisco Giants.[40] Game scheduling issues had to be resolved;[3] 
league-wide, there would be 1,944 games compared to 1,232 for the 1968 
Major League Baseball season.[1] The American League had considered decreasing 
the number of games played by each team to 152[18] or 156 from 162 that 
had been played each season since 1961, and the National League either 
162 or 165 games,[41] but the leagues agreed to a 162-game schedule in 
a meeting on 10 July 1968.[40] Each team would play 18 games against divisional 
opponents, and 12 games against league opponents in the other division.[42] 
A best-of-five post-season playoff series between league division winners 
was also introduced.[1][40] The Kansas City Royals have been the most successful 
of the four 1969 expansion teams. The franchise fielded competitive teams 
in the 1970s and 1980s and won the 1985 World Series. After a 29-year postseason 
drought, the Royals returned to postseason play in the 2014 season, before 
winning their second World Series title in 2015. The San Diego Padres had 
nine consecutive losing seasons, and have since made the playoffs five 
times. The Padres twice made the World Series in 1984 and 1998, but lost 
both appearances. The Montreal Expos had good attendance for the 1969 season, 
and after having losing records for ten years, were competitive in the 
1980s and early 1990s. Its 1994 season put it in first place before the 
1994–95 Major League Baseball strike prematurely ended the season. The 
team's fortunes declined thereafter, and the team moved to Washington, 
D.C. for the 2005 season, becoming the Washington Nationals. The Seattle 
Pilots fared worst of the four expansion franchises, playing only in the 
1969 season. The team fared poorly on the field, and faced financial difficulties 
owing to no television coverage, a stadium with problems, and the highest 
ticket and concession prices in the league.[43] Owners of other American 
League teams wanted Soriano and Daley to sell the team to a Seattle owner 
who would improve the team and address issues at Sick's Stadium, particularly 
uncovered seats with bad views.[43] After several attempts to sell the 
team to a Seattle owner failed, on April 1, 1970 judge Sidney Volinn declared 
the team officially bankrupt; it was sold to Bud Selig, who moved the team 
to Milwaukee and renamed it the Milwaukee Brewers.[44] Selig had negotiated 
a deal for the purchase with Soriano during Game 1 of the 1969 World Series.[44] 
As a result of the relocation, in 1970 the city of Seattle, King County, 
and the state of Washington sued the American League for breach of contract.[45] 
The $32.5 million lawsuit[46] was settled in 1976 when the American League 
offered the city a franchise in exchange for termination of the lawsuit.[45] 
This led to the establishment of the Seattle Mariners via the 1977 Major
