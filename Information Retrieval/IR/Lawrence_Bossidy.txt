Lawrence A. ("Larry") Bossidy (born March 5, 1935) is a businessman and 
author. He is a retired CEO of AlliedSignal (later Honeywell), and has 
also spent more than 30 years rising into executive power at General Electric. 
Bossidy was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on March 5, 1935[1] and has 
a twin brother, Tom Bossidy.[2] Bossidy worked at the family shoe store 
growing up, had dreams of being a big league baseball pitcher.[3] and once 
had a summer job of pitching baseball for a college league team in Quebec, 
Canada.[2] When Bossidy was a senior in high school he had a 95+ mph fastball 
& a scout offered Bossidy a $40,000 contract to pitch for the Detroit Tigers.[2] 
However, when the scout came to Bossidy's house with a check, Bossidy's 
mother wouldn't let him in the house[2] insisting that Bossidy finish his 
studies at Colgate.[3] While at Colgate, he helped lead them to the college 
world series and was inducted into their sports hall of fame. Bossidy graduated 
from Colgate University in 1957 with a BA in economics.[1] He was a member 
of the Mu Chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Colgate. Bossidy 
was later conferred a doctorate of Humane Letters from Colgate.[2] Bossidy 
joined General Electric in 1957.[4] Bossidy started out in General Electric's 
financial training program.[4] Bossidy stayed with General Electric for 
the next 34 years rising in the company through a number of executive positions 
including chief operating officer of General Electric Credit Corporation 
from 1979 to 1981, Executive Vice President and President of GE's Services 
and Materials Sector from 1981 to 1984, and vice-chairman and Executive 
Officer of the General Electric Company from 1984 to 1991.[5] One of Bossidy's 
most important jobs at General Electric was as chief operating officer 
of General Electric Credit Corporation[3] from 1979 to 1981.[5] During 
Bossidy's tenure as head of General Electric Credit Corporation, the subsidiary, 
founded in 1943, came into its own.[6] Between 1979 and 1984, its assets 
doubled, to $16 billion, due to expansion into leasing and selling of heavy 
industrial goods, inventories, real estate, and insurance.[6] The leasing 
operations also provided General Electric with tax shelters from accelerated 
depreciation on equipment that GE developed that were then leased by the 
credit corporation.[6] Dennis Dammerman worked for Bossidy at GE Credit 
and remembered that Bossidy "could be boisterous and a little unsettling 
to the insecure. He challenged everything, If you couldn't back up what 
you said, look out. But he also challenges himself."[3] Bossidy had a long 
term business relationship with General Electric CEO Jack Welch that began 
in the late 1960s when Bossidy came to audit GE's plastics division where 
Welch worked at the time.[3] Bossidy later worked for Welch when Welch 
became CEO at General Electric.[3] "Larry is a quick thinker, who energizes 
others around him. When he gets behind an idea, he lights up a room," says 
Welch.[3] "He has both the mental toughness as well as the broad perspective 
that is necessary to lead and deliver results."[3] Before joining AlliedSignal, 
Bossidy was a high level executive at GE. He was very close to GE CEO Jack 
Welch but left for Allied Signal because he was too close in age to Welch 
to be considered as his successor (GE has a mandatory 65-year retirement 
age for its CEOs so somebody who is not a good ten years younger at the 
time of a CEO change would not be considered for the job). From 1991â€“1999 
Bossidy served as chairman and CEO of AlliedSignal Corporation. He became 
Chairman of Honeywell Corporation when Honeywell was acquired by AlliedSignal 
in 1999. (Allied Signal, well known in the Aerospace, Aviation, and Military 
industries adopted the Honeywell name, as Honeywell's product diversity 
provided greater notoriety in the consumer market). He served as Chairman 
of The Business Council in 1997 and 1998.[7] In 2002, he co-authored a 
book entitled Execution: The Discipline of Getting Things Done. (ISBN 0-609-61057-0). 
He is currently a director of the pharmaceutical company Merck. Bossidy 
married Nancy Bossidy[2] in 1956.[1] The Bossidys have six daughters and 
three sons[1] and thirty-one grandchildren.[2] Bossidy lives in Ridgefield, 
Connecticut and has a winter home in Palm Beach, Florida.[2] Bossidy's
