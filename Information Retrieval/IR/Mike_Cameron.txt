Michael Terrance Cameron (born January 8, 1973) is an American former professional 
Major League Baseball outfielder. He played for the Chicago White Sox, 
Cincinnati Reds, Seattle Mariners, New York Mets, San Diego Padres, Milwaukee 
Brewers, Boston Red Sox, and Florida Marlins. In 2002, Cameron became the 
13th player to hit four home runs in one game. He was also an All-Star 
in 2001 and won Gold Gloves in 2001, 2003, and 2006.[1] Cameron attended 
LaGrange High School in LaGrange, Georgia. Cameron was drafted out of high 
school by the Chicago White Sox in 1991. His major league debut took place 
on August 27, 1995, with the White Sox. In 1997 he won a starting job as 
the team's regular center fielder. He was traded to the Cincinnati Reds 
for Paul Konerko in 1998.[2] Along with three other players he was traded 
to the Seattle Mariners for Ken Griffey, Jr. before the 2000 season.[3] 
Cameron tied a major league record on May 2, 2002 when he hit four home 
runs in one game[4][5] becoming only the 15th player in MLB history to 
do this. In his fifth at bat, he hit one to the warning track, just missing 
what would have been a record setting fifth home run. He played in the 
All-Star Game in 2001[6] and reached the postseason twice and won the Gold 
Glove Award in 2001, 2003, and 2006 (with the Padres) for his defensive 
play in the outfield.[7] He led all major league center fielders in range 
factor (3.42) in 2003.[8] In 2004 he signed a three-year, $19.5 million 
contract to play center field for the New York Mets. With the acquisition 
by the Mets of Carlos Beltrán before the 2005 season, Cameron surrendered 
his position to the star center fielder and played most of his games in 
right field during the 2005 season.[9] On August 11, 2005, in San Diego, 
Cameron collided with Beltran in the outfield as both made diving attempts 
to catch a fly ball. Cameron suffered a concussion and multiple fractures 
of his nose and cheekbones, and was removed from the field on a stretcher.[10] 
Beltran also suffered a concussion but was able to walk off the field with 
help. On November 15, 2005 Cameron was traded to the San Diego Padres for 
Xavier Nady.[11] He won his first National League Gold Glove award during 
the 2006 season with San Diego.[12] After leaving the Seattle Mariners 
in 2004 via free agency, Cameron played his first game back in Seattle 
during interleague play in May 2006. Mariners fans greeted his return with 
a standing ovation. On October 31, 2007, it was announced that he had failed 
a test for banned stimulants for a second time and would miss the first 
25 games of the 2008 season.[13] Cameron has said he believes that a supplement 
he took was "tainted." However, given the requirement of two failed drug 
tests before an announcement is made, this explanation is questionable. 
He was just the second major leaguer to be suspended for a second positive 
test for stimulants, following Neifi Pérez.[14] On January 14, 2008 he 
signed a 1-year contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.[15] On March 13, 2008, 
Cameron applied for a therapeutic exemption to use stimulants during the 
2008 season because of his outfield collision with former teammate Carlos 
Beltrán. He claimed to be struggling with after-effects of the collision 
that ended his 2005 season.[16] If he had applied for the exemption in 
2007, he could have avoided the 25-game suspension he had to serve to begin 
this season for testing positive for a banned stimulant for the second 
time. He also told USA Today that he will see a neurologist to determine 
if he is suffering from post-concussion syndrome.[16] If the exemption 
is granted, Cameron would be permitted to use some amphetamines that are 
currently banned by the Major League Baseball drug policy. In November 
2008, his club option was picked up by the Brewers for the 2009 season.[17] 
On May 24, 2009, Cameron hit his 250th career home run against the Minnesota 
Twins, becoming the 20th player in the league to hit 250 home runs and 
steal 250 bases.[18] On December 16, 2009, Cameron signed a 2-year deal 
with the Boston Red Sox.[19] He missed most of the season with a groin 
injury but managed to still hit 4 home runs on the season. Cameron made 
70 plate appearances for Boston, batting .143, before being designated 
for assignment on June 29.[20] On July 5, he was traded to the Florida 
Marlins for a player to be named later or cash considerations.[21] He was 
released on September 13, 2011.[22] On December 19, 2011, he agreed to 
a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals.[23] Cameron never played 
in any games for the Nationals after announcing his retirement on February 
19, 2012.[24] He signed a one-day contract with Seattle on April 14, 2012, 
to officially retire as a Mariner before throwing out the ceremonial first 
pitch at the Mariners' home opener that same day.[25] Cincinnati Reds announcer 
Marty Brennaman once said Cameron is one of his top 10 favorite players 
he has ever been around.[26] Together with Greg Brown and Robin Roberts, 
Cameron wrote a book (aimed primarily at children) titled "It Takes a Team: 
Mike Cameron", ISBN 1-57243-502-X, where he presents his views on the importance 
of teamwork and describes his life. Published in 2002 by Triumph Books. 
After being selected to the American League All-Star Team in 2001, Cameron 
used his salary bonus to purchase All-Star Game warm-up jackets for all 
of his Seattle Mariner teammates. He is known for routinely sitting on 
top of the dugout to sign autographs and talk with fans before games. He 
is also founder of the Cam4Kids Foundation and was host of the First State 
Golf Tournament for Inner City Kids in Seattle in 2002; these in effort 
to raise money to provide scholarships to inner-city youth. He is actively 
involved with the Make-A-Wish Foundation as well as the Starlight Foundation.[27] 
Cameron's son, Daz Cameron, played baseball at Eagle's Landing Christian 
Academy. He was drafted 37th overall by the Houston Astros in the 2015
