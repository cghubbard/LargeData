The Minnesota Twins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota. They play in the American League Central division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Twins have selected 68 
players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning players 
from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to its franchises. 
The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, 
with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick.[1] 
In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may 
be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 68 players picked 
in the first round by Minnesota, 30 have been pitchers, the most of any 
position; 22 of these were right-handed, while 8 were left-handed. Twelve 
outfielders were selected, while eleven shortstops, seven third basemen, 
four catchers, three first basemen and one player at second base were taken 
as well.[3] Thirteen of the players came from high schools or universities 
in the state of California, and Florida follows with nine players. The 
Twins have drafted six players from Arizona, including five players from 
Arizona State University.[3] Two of the Twins' first-round picks have won 
championships with the franchise. Willie Banks (1987) and Chuck Knoblauch 
(1989) won a World Series title on the 1991 championship team.[4][5] Knoblauch 
is also the only first-round draft pick of the Twins to win the MLB Rookie 
of the Year award, taking home the award in 1991.[5] None of their first-round 
picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Catcher Joe Mauer 
(2001) won the 2009 American League Most Valuable Player award, the only 
first-round pick of the Twins to win the award.[6] Mauer has also won three 
Silver Slugger Awards, two Rawlings Gold Glove Awards, and is the only 
catcher in MLB history to win three batting titles.[6][7] The Twins have 
made 16 selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have made 
the first overall selection twice (1983 and 2001).[3][8] They have also 
had 18 compensatory picks since the institution of the First-Year Player 
Draft in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided when a team loses 
a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][9][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[10] The Twins have six times failed to sign their first-round pick.[3] 
Eddie Leon (1965), Dick Ruthven (1972), Jamie Allen (1976), and Tim Belcher 
(1983) all failed to sign with the Twins without the team receiving compensation.[11][12][13] 
The Twins did, however, receive a compensatory pick when they failed to 
sign Jason Varitek (1993). Varitek did not sign and instead chose to enter 
the draft again the following year and was taken by the Seattle Mariners.[14] 
Additionally, Travis Lee, the Twins' only selection in 1996 and the second-overall 
pick of that draft, did not sign with the team. Lee's agent, Scott Boras, 
did not communicate with the Twins for the first two weeks after the draft 
and then invoked a rarely used rule that a team was required to make a 
contract offer within 15 days of the draft or relinquish their rights to 
the player.[15] As a result, Lee and 3 other 1996 first-round picks who 
were Boras clients were granted free agency and he ultimately signed with
