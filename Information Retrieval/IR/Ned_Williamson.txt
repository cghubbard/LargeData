Edward Nagle "Ned" or "Ed" Williamson (October 24, 1857 – March 3, 1894) 
was an American Major League Baseball player for 13 seasons from 1878 until 
1890. He played for three different teams: the Indianapolis Blues of the 
National League (NL) for one season, the Chicago White Stockings (NL) for 
11 seasons, and the Chicago Pirates of the Players' League for one season. 
From 1883 and 1887, Williamson held the single-season record for both doubles 
and home runs. Although his record for doubles was surpassed in 1887, he 
held the home run record until 1919, when it was topped by Babe Ruth of 
the Boston Red Sox. Statistically, he was one of the best fielders of his 
era. During the first eight years of his career, he led the league at his 
position in both fielding percentage and double plays five times, and he 
also led his position in assists six times. Later, when he moved to shortstop, 
he again led the league in both assists and double plays. His career was 
shortened by a knee injury that he suffered in Paris during a world-tour 
organized by Albert Spalding. After he left organized baseball, his health 
declined rapidly. He contracted tuberculosis and ultimately died at the 
age of 36 of dropsy. Born in Philadelphia, Williamson began his major league 
career on May 1, 1878 for the Indianapolis Blues of the National League.[1] 
That season he played in all 63 of the team's games as the starting third 
baseman, leading the league in that category.[2] He umpired his only game 
on August 12, calling a game between the Chicago White Stockings and the 
Providence Grays.[3] His season-ending statistics included a .232 batting 
average, one home run, and 31 runs scored.[1] The Blues were only a major 
league team for the 1878 season,[4] resulting in Williamson joining the 
Chicago White Stockings for the 1879 season.[1] He was their regular third 
baseman, leading the league in multiple fielding categories for his position, 
including fielding percentage, assists, putouts, and double plays.[1] As 
a hitter, his numbers improved. He finished second in the league with 13 
triples, and eighth in doubles with 20, while also raising his batting 
average to .294.[2] During the next three seasons, his batting statistics 
fluctuated from year to year. His batting average rose from .251 in 1880 
to .282 in 1882; likewise, his 20 doubles in 1880 were good for seventh 
in the league, but dropped to 12 in 1881. He followed that season with 
27 in 1882, which was fourth in the league.[2] During this time period, 
when his level of hitting had dropped, his play in the field did not. He 
led the league in fielding percentage from 1880 to 1882, and in assists 
in 1881 and 1882.[1] In 1883, Williamson set the major league record for 
doubles in a single season by hitting 49, surpassing King Kelly's 37 set 
the previous year.[5] Williamson's record for doubles stood until Tip O'Neill 
of the St. Louis Browns hit 52 in 1887.[5] Williamson's doubles achievement 
was attributed to the short dimensions of Chicago's Lakeshore Park; the 
distances were 186 feet (57 m) in left field, 300 feet (91 m) in center 
field, and 190 feet (58 m) in right field. Balls that were hit over the 
fence were counted as doubles until 1884, when they became home runs.[6] 
On September 6, Chicago scored a record 18 runs in one inning during a 
26–6 victory over the Detroit Wolverines. Williamson contributed three 
hits, and scored three runs in that inning, setting individual records 
in both categories. Other than runs scored, the other team records set 
that day included the most hits and total bases in one inning.[7] During 
this time period, the establishment of the ground rules of each park rested 
with the home team. In 1884, team captain and on-field manager Cap Anson 
decided that balls hit over the fence were to be home runs.[6] Williamson 
used these short dimensions and new ground rules to set the single-season 
home run record by hitting 27 in a 112-game season, surpassing the record 
of 14 set by Harry Stovey the previous year. Of the 27 home runs he hit 
that year, 25 of them were hit at home.[8] This record stood for 35 years 
until it was broken in 1919 by Babe Ruth, who hit 29 for the Boston Red 
Sox in a 140-game schedule. The first three of Williamson's 27 home runs 
came on May 30, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Detroit 
Wolverines. Williamson became the first major league baseball player to 
hit three home runs in one game.[8] During these two record-breaking seasons, 
his fielding prowess did not recede. He did not lead the league in fielding 
percentage in either 1883 or 1884, but did lead in assists, capping off 
a streak of five consecutive years in which he did so, while also leading 
the league in double plays for the second and third consecutive years.[1] 
After the 1884 season, the White Stockings moved to West Side Park, and 
Williamson's power numbers dropped. Without the short fences, his home 
run total dropped to three, his doubles went down to 16, and his batting 
average dropped to .238, his lowest average since he became a White Stocking. 
Despite his low hitting numbers, he did lead the league in games played 
with 116, bases on balls with 75,[2] and yet again, led his position in 
assists, double plays, and for the fifth and last time, fielding percentage.[1] 
Chicago won the National League championship that season, and agreed to 
play the American Association champions, the St. Louis Browns in a seven-game 
"World Series". Before game one began, the players of both teams held a 
field day which included contests of skill, and Williamson won the long 
throw with a toss that traveled 400 feet, four inches.[9] The 1885 series 
ended in a tie when each team won three games, and one game ended in a 
tie.[10] Williamson collected two base hits in 23 at bats, for a .087 batting 
average, and scored one run.[10] Beginning in 1886, Williamson switched 
his fielding position to shortstop, while the Chicago White Stockings again 
won the National League championship, their fifth in seven years.[11] The 
team's success did not coincide with Williamson's slide in seasonal numbers. 
His batting average dropped to his career low of .216, and his strikeouts 
jumped up to a career high of 71, in 430 at bats, although he did finish 
third in bases on balls.[2] The White Stockings met the St. Louis Browns 
following the season and agreed to play a best of seven "World Series" 
for the second consecutive year.[12] The Browns won the series, four games 
to two, and Williamson's statistics for the series did not improve. In 
fact, they were worse than in 1885. He gathered one base hit in 18 at bats, 
for a .056 batting average, and scored two runs.[12] 1887 was Williamson's 
second season at shortstop, his last full season in the majors, and his 
numbers began to climb back to what they were during the early part of 
his career. His batting average jumped back up to .267, hit 20 doubles, 
14 triples, 73 base on balls, and nine home runs.[2] In 1888, his batting 
average dipped again, this time to .250, but he did finish fourth in the 
league in both RBIs with 73, and base on balls with 65.[2] In the field, 
he led the league in assists and double plays.[1] At the completion of 
the 1888 baseball season, Albert Spalding organized an around-the-world 
tour to promote the game of baseball. The two teams Spalding selected were 
the White Stockings and a collection of players from other National League 
teams.[13] The tour departed on October 20, 1888 to play exhibition games 
throughout the western United States for a month, before departing to Hawaii. 
The tour visited several foreign countries, such as Australia, Egypt, Ceylon 
(Sri Lanka), France, Italy, and England.[13] It was during a game played 
on at the Parc Aristotique in Paris,[8] France on March 8, 1889, when Williamson 
suffered a torn knee cap which forced him to be bedridden in England on 
doctor's orders,[13] missing the tour through Britain.[14] Though players 
in the 19th century were responsible for their own medical care, Williamson 
asked Spalding to help him financially with the mounting medical costs. 
Spalding refused, citing that he was not obligated to assist, and Williamson 
never forgave him for this.[14] Williamson, among his baseball contemporaries, 
wrote the most colorful articles to newspapers as the tour was unfolding. 
Williamson, an 1880s teammate of Anson in Chicago, had a knack for roasting—poking 
fun at—his teammates while always coming across as good-natured. A testament 
to the letters' significance is that they are a dominant source of one 
recent book's World Tour presentation.[15] Williamson is portrayed by Charlie 
Crabtree in the 2015 movie "Deadball" which depicts his life and journaling 
of the world tour.[16] The injury to Williamson's knee caused his career 
to suffer, as he played in 47 games during the 1889 season. He batted .237, 
and of his 41 hits that season, only five of them were extra base hits.[1] 
He joined the Chicago Pirates of the Players' League for the 1890 season, 
his final major league season, and played in 73 games, hitting .195.[1] 
In the spring of 1894, Williamson traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 
hopes that he could recover from a liver ailment and lose some weight as 
well, but the treatments did not work.[17] Williamson died on March 3 of 
that year, at the age of 36 in Willow Springs, Arkansas, of dropsy (edema) 
complicated by consumption (tuberculosis).[18] He is interred in an unmarked
