José Dennis Martínez Ortíz (born May 14, 1955), nicknamed "El Presidente" 
(The President),[1] is a former Major League Baseball pitcher.[2] He was 
the first Nicaraguan baseball player (pitcher or position player) to play 
in the majors. Martínez pitched for the Baltimore Orioles (1976–1986), 
Montreal Expos (1986–1993), Cleveland Indians (1994–1996), Seattle Mariners 
(1997) and Atlanta Braves (1998). During a 23-year baseball career, Martínez 
compiled 245 wins, 2,149 strikeouts, and a 3.70 earned run average. He 
is one of the top Latin American pitchers of all-time. On July 28, 1991, 
Martínez pitched the thirteenth perfect game in Major League Baseball history, 
pitching for the Montreal Expos against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was 
the first Latin American-born pitcher to pitch a perfect game.[3] On September 
28, 1993, Martinez won his 100th game for the Expos, becoming one of nine 
major league pitchers ever with at least 100 wins in both the American 
and National leagues. Others to do that are Jim Bunning, Ferguson Jenkins, 
Al Orth, Gaylord Perry, Kevin Brown, Randy Johnson, Nolan Ryan and Cy Young. 
On September 28, 1995, a wild pitch by Martinez broke the jaw of Hall of 
Famer Kirby Puckett. This would be Puckett's last official game of his 
career, retiring in 1996 due to glaucoma in his right eye, a problem unrelated 
to Martinez's pitch. Martínez has the most career victories of any pitcher 
who has never won 20 games in a single season. Milt Pappas, Jerry Reuss, 
Frank Tanana, Charlie Hough, Chuck Finley, Kenny Rogers, and Tim Wakefield 
are the only other pitchers with at least 200 career victories who have 
done so. (Of these, Pappas, Reuss and Rogers had pitched no-hitters, with 
Rogers' also being a perfect game, three years to the day of Martínez's.) 
During Martinez' time with the Expos, a variation of the Montreal hot dog 
topped with cheese and bacon called the Denny Dog was sold at Olympic Stadium.[4] 
Martinez has worked as a spring training instructor for the Baltimore Orioles 
in 2005 and 2006,[5] and pitching coach for the Palm Beach Cardinals in 
the Florida State League.[6] On November 5, 2012, the Houston Astros finalized 
their coaching staff for the 2013 season, naming Martínez as their new 
bullpen coach. He was fired on October 1, 2013.[7] Martinez also is manager 
of the Nicaragua national baseball team, and managed during the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic Qualifying Tournament. The national baseball park in Managua 
(Nicaragua's capital city), Dennis Martínez National Stadium, was named 
in his honor. Martinez runs his own organization, The Dennis Martínez Foundation, 
to help poor children around the world. In 2016, Martinez was inducted 
into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
