Hamilton Township is a township in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. 
The township is within the New York metropolitan area as defined by the 
United States Census Bureau,[21] but directly borders the Philadelphia 
metropolitan area and is part of the Federal Communications Commission's 
Philadelphia Designated Market Area.[22] As of the 2010 United States Census, 
the township had a total population of 88,464,[10][11][12] reflecting an 
increase of 1,355 (+1.6%) from the 87,109 counted in the 2000 Census, which 
had in turn increased by 556 (+0.6%) from the 86,553 counted in the 1990 
Census.[23] The township was the state's 9th-largest municipality, after 
having been ranked 10th in 2000.[24] The township is located immediately 
east of the city of Trenton, the state's capital. Hamilton was incorporated 
as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1842, 
from portions of the now-defunct Nottingham Township. Portions of the township 
were taken to form Chambersburg borough (April 1, 1872, annexed by Trenton 
in 1888) and Wilbur borough (April 24, 1891, annexed by Trenton in 1898).[25] 
Hamilton Township derives its name from the village of Hamilton Square, 
which might have been named for Alexander Hamilton.[26][27] In 2006, Hamilton 
Township was ranked by Morgan Quitno as the eighteenth-safest city in the 
United States, out of 369 cities nationwide.[28] In the company's 2005 
survey, the Township was ranked 15th safest of 354 cities surveyed nationwide.[29] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total 
area of 40.387 square miles (104.602 km2), including 39.489 square miles 
(102.277 km2) of it is land and 0.898 square miles (2.325 km2) of water 
(2.22%) is water.[2][3] Although Hamilton is one of the largest townships 
in New Jersey it doesn't have a true "downtown", but a number of settlements 
within the township form smaller commercial centers. Groveville (with a 
2010 Census population of 2,945[30]), Hamilton Square (12,784[31]), Mercerville 
(13,230[32]), White Horse (9,494[33]) and Yardville (7,186[34]) are all 
census-designated places and unincorporated communities located within 
the township.[35] Other unincorporated communities, localities and place 
names located partially or completely within the township include Briar 
Manor,[citation needed] Broad Street Park, Bromley, Chewalla Park,[citation 
needed] Creston, DeCou Village, Deutzville, Duck Island, East Trenton Heights,[citation

Haines Corner, Hutchinson Mills, Lakeside Park, Maple Shade, North Crosswicks, 
Nottingham,[citation needed] Oil City, Pond Run, Quaker Bridge, Quaker 
Gardens,[citation needed] Rosemont,[citation needed] The Orchards,[citation

White City and Yardville Heights.[36] Van Nest Wildlife Refuge is a 98-acre 
(40 ha) wildlife management area operated by the New Jersey Department 
of Environmental Protection's Division of Fish and Wildlife.[37][38] As 
of late 2005, much of the new residential development in Hamilton has been 
geared to accommodating the aging baby boomer generation. New retirement 
communities and assisted-living facilities outpace that of new traditional 
residential communities. Such construction has been spurred by several 
factors. The first being that the public is skeptical of growing school 
budgets due to its already large size. Hamilton voters have often rejected 
increases in school budgets in their yearly elections to keep already high 
taxes from growing higher. As a result, the planning board has been reluctant 
to authorize construction of housing that will increase the student population. 
Another reason is a series of improvements to Robert Wood Johnson University 
Hospital. The hospital is now a highly respected source of care in the 
state. It is situated next to where most of the under-developed land in 
the township used to be, land that is now home to the active older-adult 
communities. As of October 2016, significant construction has been done 
to further build up the Hamilton Township area. Multiple new retirement 
communities have been constructed, as well as multiple new restaurants, 
banks, gas stations and convenience stores along Route 33. Hamilton Township 
continues to expand rapidly to accommodate the increase in citizens residing 
in the community. At the 2010 United States Census, there were 88,464 people, 
34,534 households, and 23,759 families residing in the township. The population

of the largest recreational parks in the state, and borders another. The 
municipal Veterans Park is 350 acres (1.4 km2) and is housed entirely in 
the township. Mercer County Park borders the township to the North and 
encompasses 2,500 acres (10 km2) of land that was shared from Hamilton 
Township along with neighboring Lawrence Township and West Windsor Township.[51] 
This park contains Mercer Lake, one of the largest man-made lakes in the 
state, which was built as a result of a federal flood control project to 
prevent flooding in Trenton along Assunpink Creek, with gravel removed 
to deepen the lake basin used as part of the construction of Interstates 
95 and 195.[52] The Grounds for Sculpture is a 42-acre (170,000 m2) sculpture 
park which houses more than 270 sculptures, gardens, water features, and 
other nature scenes. The organization's mission is to promote the appreciation 
of arts and sculpture. Sayen Park Botanical Garden is named after Fredrick 
Sayen because it was originally his land and his home. George Washington 
used Quakerbridge Road on his famous night march from the Second Battle 
of Trenton on his way to the Battle of Princeton. Hamilton Township is 
governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal 
Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council plan E system of New Jersey municipal 
government, as implemented on January 1, 1976, based on the recommendations 
of a Charter Study Commission.[53] The township's government consists of 
a mayor and a five-member township council, with all elected representatives 
serving four-year terms of office. Elections alternate in a four-year cycle, 
with the mayor and two township council members up for election and then 
the three other township council seats coming up to vote two years later.[8] 
At an annual reorganization meeting, the council selects a president and 
vice president from among its members for a one-year term.[54] As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Hamilton Township is Republican Kelly A. Yaede, serving a 
term of office that ends December 31, 2019.[4] Members of the Township 
Council are Council President Ileana Schirmer (R, 2019), Council Vice President 
Edward R. Gore (R, 2017), David J. Kenny (R, 2017), Ralph Mastrangelo (R, 
2019) and Dennis A. Pone (R, 2017).[55][56][57][58][59][60] On April 27, 
2012, Mayor John Bencivengo was charged by the U.S. Attorney's office for 
corruption in the extortion of payments in exchange for influencing the 
awarding of a health insurance contract for the Township's Board of Education.[61] 
On June 22, 2012 he was indicted by a federal grand jury on five criminal 
counts including extortion, attempted extortion, money laundering and two 
counts related to the federal travel act.[62] On June 29, 2012, Rob Warney, 
a former Hamilton Township Director in Mayor John Bencivengo's cabinet, 
pleaded guilty before US District Court Judge Peter Sheridan to laundering 
money related to the federal bribery indictment against Mayor Bencivengo. 
Warney also admitted to accepting a bribe in 2006 in exchange for his vote 
and influence over a health insurance broker's contract.[63] On November 
19, 2012, Bencivengo was found guilty on all counts of corruption, extortion 
and bribery. He submitted his resignation effective November 21, 2012.[64] 
On March 24, 2013, Bencivengo was sentenced to a 38-month prison term, 
and is currently serving his sentence at a minimum security federal prison 
at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Lewisburg, PA. On September 23, 2013, 
his attorney filed an appeal with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.[65]

state capital of Trenton, and New Jersey's eighth-largest municipality, 
Hamilton Township is 65 miles (105 km) away from New York City and 35 miles 
(56 km) away from Philadelphia. Hamilton is also close to most points along 
the Jersey Shore. By car, Hamilton is about 80 minutes from New York City 
and 50 minutes from Philadelphia. The train ride to New York is slightly 
shorter than the drive into New York while the train ride to Philadelphia 
is slightly longer than the drive into Philadelphia. With nearly 90,000 
residents and 40 square miles (100 km2) of land, it offers modern train 
station and major roads passing through. As of May 2010[update], the township 
had a total of 369.10 miles (594.01 km) of roadways, of which 304.98 miles 
(490.82 km) were maintained by the municipality, 33.49 miles (53.90 km) 
by Mercer County and 27.93 miles (44.95 km) by the New Jersey Department 
of Transportation and 2.70 miles (4.35 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[136] 
Roads include the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Interstate 295, 
Interstate 195, U.S. Route 130, U.S. Route 206 and Route 33. Hamilton is 
the only municipality in the state that hosts Interstate 95 and both of 
its auxiliary routes, Interstates 195 and 295. Major county routes that 
traverse through include CR 524, CR 533 and CR 535. The Turnpike's Woodrow 
Wilson service area is located between Interchanges 7 and 7A northbound 
at milepost 58.7.[137] The Richard Stockton service area is located between 
Interchanges 7A and 7 southbound at milepost 58.7.[138] No turnpike interchange 
is located in the township, but the closest exit is at Interchange 7A along 
I-195 in neighboring Robbinsville Township. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority 
widened the turnpike between Exit 6 in Mansfield Township, Burlington County 
and Exit 8A in Monroe Township, Middlesex County. Two new carriageways 
were built to accommodate the outer roadway (or truck lanes). In Hamilton, 
new sound barriers and overpasses were built, as well as new entrance & 
exit ramps to the service areas. The project was announced in December 
2004 and completed in early November 2014.[139] With the addition of the 
modern Hamilton train station located on Sloan Avenue just off I-295 at 
Exit 65B, the township has attracted more New York City-based commuters 
to the area.[140] The station offers service on New Jersey Transit's Northeast 
Corridor Line to New York Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan and to Trenton 
station where there is a SEPTA Trenton Line Regional Rail service to and 
from Philadelphia.[141] New Jersey Transit provides public bus service 
between the township and Philadelphia on the 409 route and to Trenton on 
the 601, 603, 606, 607, 608 and 609 routes.[142] People who were born in,
