Christopher Ralph Perez (born July 1, 1985) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. He pitched collegiately for the University of Miami, 
and was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round (42nd overall) 
of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft. Perez also played for the Cleveland 
Indians and Los Angeles Dodgers. Perez began his professional career in 
2006 with the Swing of the Quad Cities, the Midwest League affiliate of 
the Cardinals. He was 1–1 with a team-leading eleven saves and a 3.20 ERA 
in 26 games for the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds in 2008. He fanned 38 batters 
in his 25 1⁄3 innings pitched, walked just 12 and allowed only 18 hits. 
He was added to the Cardinals 25-man active roster from Triple-A Memphis 
on May 16, 2008. He made his debut that same day, working one scoreless 
inning in relief against the Tampa Bay Rays. He picked up his first career 
save on August 6 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He attended the Cardinals' 
2009 spring training camp to compete for a relief pitcher spot, but had 
arm trouble and was returned to the minor leagues for more experience.[1] 
In 70 total games with the Cardinals, he was 4-4 with a 3.72 ERA and 8 
saves. Perez and Jess Todd were traded to the Cleveland Indians on June 
27, 2009 for Mark DeRosa.[2] Following the trade of Kerry Wood to the New 
York Yankees on July 31, 2010, Perez became the Indians' permanent closer.[3] 
After a breakout 2011 season that included playing in the All-Star Game 
and being fourth in the league in saves, on February 23, 2012, Perez strained 
his left oblique in spring training and was expected to miss 4–6 weeks. 
However, Perez himself set a goal for March 15. He was throwing a 10-minute 
bullpen session, when, after 25–30 pitches, he felt a pain in his left 
side. He returned for Opening Day despite the injury, but blew the save 
by loading the bases and allowing multiple runs.[4] Perez's ongoing and 
vocal criticism of Indians fans has made him a controversial figure. In 
May and June, 2012, Perez publicly criticized Indians fans in response 
to the team beginning the season last in attendance across both leagues 
and for being booed in a game on May 17. Perez was booed in the 10th inning 
for allowing two runners, although the opposition failed to score in the 
inning and the Indians won the game.[5][6] On July 1, Perez was named to 
his second consecutive All-Star Game as a member of the American League 
squad, joining Indians teammate Asdrúbal Cabrera.[7] At the time of his 
selection, Perez had converted 23 of 24 save opportunities, his save count 
total tied for best in the Majors. Perez throws just two pitches: a four-seam 
fastball at 93–96 mph and a slider at 82–86.[8] On August 13, 2012, Perez 
earned his 100th save in a 6-2 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. 
He entered the ninth inning with runners on first and second but recorded 
three strikeouts to record the save.[9] On January 18, 2013, the Cleveland 
Indians announced they had avoided arbitration with Perez, signing him 
to a one-year contract worth $7.3 million.[10] On August 5, 2013, Perez 
blew a save to the Detroit Tigers, and after the game decided to boycott 
the media for the rest of the season, which led to a rocky relationship 
between him and the fans. On September 29, 2013, he broke his silence and 
talked with the media. The Cleveland Indians released Perez on October 
31, 2013.[11] He signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
on December 24, 2013. The contract included a base salary of $2.3 million 
with incentives worth as much as $8 million.[12] Perez appeared in 49 games 
for the Dodgers and was 1–3 with a 4.27 ERA. He was owed a $500,000 bonus 
if he appeared in 50 games, but the Dodgers did not use him at all the 
last week of the season to avoid paying the bonus. Perez signed a 1-year 
minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on February 4, 2015, which 
included an invitation to spring training.[13] He was released on March 
29.[14] He was re-signed to another minor league contract two days later, 
and exercised an opt-out on April 27.[15] On June 24, it was announced 
that Perez was suspended for 50 games for violating the drug policy by 
testing positive for a drug of abuse.[16] On July 2, 2015, Perez signed 
a minor league deal with the Orioles, despite still being suspended.[17] 
He retired on August 22.[18] Perez grew up on Anna Maria Island with his 
father, Tim Perez. He resides in Tampa, Florida[19] with his wife, Melanie.[20] 
His entrance music is "Firestarter" by The Prodigy. He is nicknamed "Pure 
Rage" and uses it as his Twitter handle.[21][22] He deleted his Twitter 
account at the beginning of the 2013 to "minimize any potential off-the-field 
distractions."[23] Perez and his wife were arrested on June 4, 2013 in
