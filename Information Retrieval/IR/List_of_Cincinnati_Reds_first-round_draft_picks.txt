The Cincinnati Reds are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Cincinnati, Ohio. They play in the National League Central division. Officially 
known as the "First-Year Player Draft",[2] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary 
mechanism for assigning players from high schools, colleges, and other 
amateur clubs to its franchises. The draft order is determined based on 
the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record 
receiving the first pick.[2] In addition, teams which lost free agents 
in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary 
picks.[3] Since the establishment of the draft in 1965, the Reds have selected 
58 players in the first round. Of those 58 players, 28 have been pitchers, 
the most of any position; 22 of these were right-handed, while 6 were left-handed. 
The Reds have also selected 12 outfielders, eight shortstops, four catchers, 
four third basemen and two first basemen. They have never selected a second 
baseman in the initial round of the draft.[4] The franchise has drafted 
eleven players from colleges or high schools in California, while another 
eight were drafted out of Texas. No first-round pick has been drafted out 
the Reds' home state of Ohio.[4] Five of these picks have won a World Series 
championship with the Reds. Don Gullett & Gary Nolan (baseball) won two 
consecutive Series with the Reds, 1975 and 1976, and won again in 1977 
as a member of the New York Yankees.[5] Three of the Reds first-round picks 
participated in the team's 1990 championship; Barry Larkin, Scott Scudder, 
and Jack Armstrong.[6] Larkin was awarded the Roberto Clemente Award in 
1993, the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 1994, and named the National League 
Most Valuable Player in 1995.[1] Larkin received 361 votes—out of 436 required—in 
his second year of eligibility for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
He will be eligible for election for a further 13 years, as long as he 
is named on 5% of the ballots cast each year.[7] Cincinnati has made ten 
selections in the supplemental round of the draft, but has never held the 
first overall pick. They have also had two compensatory picks since the 
first draft in 1965.[4] These additional picks are provided when a team 
loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[3][8][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[9] The Reds have failed to sign their first-round pick twice. Mike 
Miley, selected in 1971, chose to attend college at Louisiana State University; 
he would later be drafted by the California Angels in 1974.[10][11] The 
Reds did not receive a compensatory pick for failing to sign Miley. Jeremy 
Sowers, the Reds' 2001 choice, decided to attend Vanderbilt University, 
and was selected in the first-round of the 2004 draft by the Cleveland 
Indians. Sowers' MLB debut came in 2006 against Cincinnati.[12] For failing 
to sign Sowers, the Reds received the 40th pick in the 2002 draft, which
