Leavitt Leo "Bud" Daley (born October 7, 1932), is a former professional 
baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1955–1964. Leavitt 
was his father's name. Leo was for St. Leo from his mother's Catholicism. 
He was called Bud because his mother was an only child and she always wanted 
a child like her cousin, Buddy Walker. As a player Daley made his home 
in Long Beach, California. He was successful in public relations and a 
skilled speaker. In the offseason he once appeared in seventy-two towns 
in six states.[1] Daley was a knuckleball pitcher.[2] who threw curves 
of two different speeds.[1] He became an All-Star pitcher in 1959 and 1960 
for the Kansas City Athletics. During that two-year period, Daley won a 
total of 32 games, and was 3rd in the American League with 16 wins in 1960. 
In June 1961, he was traded by Kansas City to the New York Yankees, becoming 
an impact pitcher as the Yanks won the 1961 World Series over the Cincinnati 
Reds. Daley was purchased by the Cleveland Indians from the Sacramento 
Solons of the Pacific Coast League on August 18, 1955. The purchase price 
was not revealed.[3] Daley received offers from five other major league 
clubs. He signed with the Indians because of his friendship with Bob Lemon, 
whose children Daley used to babysit for.[2] He dropped his first major 
league start at Briggs Stadium in a 6-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Harvey 
Kuenn hit an 8th-inning home run in a game in which the Tigers reached 
Daley for nine of ten hits in the first six innings.[4] Daley was optioned 
to the Indianapolis Indians on July 4, 1956.[5] On September 7 he was one 
of 7 players recalled from the American Association farm team.[6] On March 
31, 1958 Daley was traded, along with Gene Woodling and Dick Williams, 
to the Baltimore Orioles, for Larry Doby and Don Ferrarese.[7] On April 
18 Daley was traded to the Athletics for pitcher Arnie Portocarrero.[8] 
Daley put together a 4-game win streak in 1959. On June 6 he beat the Orioles 
5-1, for his 5th win of the season. He conceded five hits to Baltimore, 
and afterwards, had allowed only a single run in his previous four games.[9] 
Casey Stengel selected Daley as one of seven pitchers he picked for the 
American League All-Star team on July 2.[10] Daley pitched a 5-hitter against 
the Orioles on July 21. The 8-1 win would have been a shutout except for 
a homer by Walt Dropo, which Daley gave up with two out in the 9th inning.[11] 
Kansas City earned its 6th straight victory with a 3-0, 4-hitter, thrown 
by Daley against Boston, on July 25.[12] For the 7th place Athletics Daley 
achieved a 16-13 record with a 3.17 E.R.A. in 1959.[1] On July 29 Daley 
was sidelined with an infected knee, which had hurt while sliding. His 
record was 11-6.[13] He gained his 12th win against the Washington Senators 
with relief help from Tom Sturdivant.[14] Daley concluded the 1959 season 
with a 16-13 record.[15] Bob Cerv hit two home runs which assisted Daley 
in stopping a four-game winning streak by the Detroit Tigers, in May 1960.[16] 
He earned his 10th victory of the season in June with an 11-7 decision 
over the Boston Red Sox. He yielded 7 earned runs, 4 of them on 2 home 
runs and a run scoring single by Ted Williams.[17] Daley suffered his 16th 
setback against the Tigers on October 2, in a 6-4 loss. He had an equal 
number of wins.[18] He was traded to the New York Yankees after being relegated 
to the Kansas City bullpen during the 1961 season. The move impaired his 
effectiveness as a pitcher. Frank Lane was responsible for trading Daley 
to the Athletics and then to the Yankees.[2] It is often rumoured that 
Daley was born naturally right-handed but developed polio as a child causing 
one arm to be shorter than the other. In fact Daley was born left-handed 
and his right arm and side are healthy. He did suffer temporary paralysis 
to his right arm after birth due to forceps pinching a nerve. However, 
massage and exercise restored the limb to health. Daley's mother, Mrs. 
E.G. Petzoldt, once said, No one wanted a baby more than I did. But Buddy 
was so crippled I didn't want him to live.. His right arm remained so crippled 
as an adult that he could barely raise it high enough to comb his hair.[2] 
Despite a 'slightly withered right arm', Daley served as a fifth infielder, 
was competitive as a batter, shot golf in the low 80s, and was a proficient 
fisherman.[1] Swaine, Rick (2004). Beating the Breaks: Major League Ballplayers
