Andrew Charles Benes (born August 20, 1967) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher. During a 14-year career from 1989 to 2002, Benes 
played for four different teams: the San Diego Padres, the Seattle Mariners, 
the St. Louis Cardinals and the Arizona Diamondbacks. His brother Alan 
also pitched in the Major Leagues, and was his teammate in 1996–97 and 
2000–01. He and his brother Alan attended Evansville Lutheran School and 
Evansville Central High School. Benes was the first player selected in

in strikeouts with 189 the next season. Benes finished third in the Cy 
Young Award balloting in 1996 after an 18–10, 3.83 earned run average season. 
After the 1997 season, Benes agreed to sign a 5-year 30 million dollar 
contract to return to the Cardinals. Unfortunately, the contract was signed 
after the deadline for players to re-sign with their 1997 teams. Benes 
would then have to wait until May 1 to re-sign.[2] Instead, Benes became 
one of the first players in Diamondbacks history when he signed as a free 
agent prior to the 1998 season and threw out the first pitch in the history 
of the franchise.[1] In a 2004 column for The Sporting News, pitcher Todd 
Jones wrote that Benes had a habit of gritting his teeth when preparing
