Greenlee Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, was the first 
black-built and black-owned major league baseball field in the United States. 
The field was the dream of Gus Greenlee, owner of the Pittsburgh Crawfords. 
In 1931, construction started on Bedford Avenue between Chauncy and Duff 
in Pittsburgh's Hill District. The park opened on April 29, 1932, and reportedly 
cost $100,000. The first game was the next day, April 30, 1932, and had 
future hall of famers Satchel Paige pitching to catcher Josh Gibson as 
City Council members, the Allegheny County commissioners, and Mayor Kline 
watched from the stands. Greenlee Field held 7,500 spectators and it was 
the home field for the Crawfords throughout the Great Depression era. The 
Homestead Grays also played there for a time. Greenlee Field was located 
a few blocks up Bedford Avenue from Ammon Field, home to the Pittsburgh 
Keystones. Contemporary city directories list the ballpark's address as 
2501 Bedford Avenue. Greenlee was forced to shut out blacks from ballpark 
jobs during the 1938 season. This angered the team's fans, and they stayed 
away in droves. After the season, the Crawfords disbanded and Greenlee 
Field was torn down. The Bedford Dwellings housing project was later developed 
on the property. The Pittsburgh Steelers used the field for in-season practices 
during the 1930s.[3] Coordinates: 40°27′05″N 79°58′22″W﻿ / ﻿40.4514°N 79.9727°W﻿
