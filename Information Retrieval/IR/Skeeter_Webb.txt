James Laverne "Skeeter" Webb (November 4, 1909 – July 8, 1986) was an American 
professional baseball player from 1932 to 1949. He played 12 seasons as 
an infielder in Major League Baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals (1932), 
Cleveland Indians (1938–1939), Chicago White Sox (1940–1944), Detroit Tigers 
(1945–1947), and Philadelphia Athletics (1948). Skeeter Webb was born in 
Meridian, Mississippi, in 1909. He attended the University of Mississippi.[1] 
He began his major league career on July 20, 1932, with the St. Louis Cardinals 
at the age of 23. He appeared in only one game in 1932 and did not have 
a plate appearance for the Cardinals.[1] Webb did not make another major 
league club for six years. From 1932 to 1937, Webb played for six minor 
league clubs, including the Springfield Senators (1932-1933), Cedar Rapids 
Raiders (1935-1936), and Columbus Red Birds (1932 and 1937). He compiled 
a career-high .320 batting average in 472 at bats with Cedar Rapids in 
1935.[2] In April 1938, he signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. 
In 1939, he played in 81 games at shortstop for the Indians and had a .264 
batting average, the highest of his major league career.[1] He also appeared 
in 39 games with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in 1939.[2] 
Traded to the Chicago White Sox in January 1940, he was moved to second 
base where he played 74 games. His batting average dropped to .237 in 1940, 
and he was relegated to the role of a utility infielder and back-up second 
baseman in 1942 and 1943. However, with the major league talent pool depleted, 
Webb won the job as the Sox' starting shortstop in 1944. However, he hit 
only .211 in 513 at bats for the 1944 White Sox.[1] Traded to the Detroit 
Tigers at the end of the 1944 season, Webb was the Tigers' starting shortstop 
in their 1945 World Series championship season. Skeeter played 104 games 
at shortstop for the 1945 Tigers but proved to be a liability at bat. His 
batting average dropped to .199 in 1945, as Webb got only 81 hits in 407 
at bats.[1] Some believe that Webb was able to hold on to the starting 
shortstop job because the Tigers' manager Steve O'Neill was his father-in-law. 
Despite his weak hitting performance in the regular season, Webb played 
all seven games of the 1945 World Series as the Tigers' shortstop. He hit 
.185 in the World Series, going 5-for-27, though he did score 5 runs. In 
Game 7, Webb had his best performances, scoring two runs and fielding the 
final out of the Series. In 1946 and 1947, Webb stayed with the Tigers 
as a backup second baseman. He finished his major league career playing 
in 23 games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1948, where he hit a career-low 
.148. He played in his final game on August 31, 1948.[1] During the 1949 
season, Webb played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League. 
He appeared in 49 games for Toronto.[2] In 12 major league seasons, Webb 
played in 699 games - 368 at shortstop, 282 at second base, and seven at 
third base. Webb had a career .219 batting average, a .263 on-base percentage, 
and a .368 slugging percentage.[1] Webb died in Meridian, Mississippi,
