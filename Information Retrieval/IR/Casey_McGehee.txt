MLB NPB Casey Michael McGehee (born October 12, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball corner infielder for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has played for the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, New York Yankees, Miami Marlins, San Francisco Giants, and Detroit 
Tigers. He also played for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Nippon Professional 
Baseball. During his tenure with the Pirates in 2012 and his tenure with 
the Marlins in 2015, McGehee was primarily a first baseman. Born and raised 
in Santa Cruz, California, McGehee graduated from Soquel High School in 
Soquel, California, where he competed in baseball and basketball. In baseball, 
McGehee was a four-year letter winner and was named County Player of the 
Year for his junior and senior seasons. However, he finished 2nd in the 
league in batting average to Harbor High star, Mike Urbani, brother of 
former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Tom Urbani. His senior season he hit 
.489 with 10 home runs and did not strikeout once during the season. McGehee 
holds the SCCAL all-time hits record and was an AAU All-American for his 
junior and senior seasons. McGehee then attended California State University 
Fresno. At Fresno, McGehee played left field his freshman season before 
transitioning to third base as a sophomore. During his freshman season, 
McGehee was a Baseball America honorable mention freshman All-American. 
During his sophomore season, McGehee was co-MVP of the team, and after 
another excellent junior season, McGehee decided to leave Fresno to play 
in the MLB.[1] McGehee was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the tenth round 
of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft out of Fresno State. McGehee was 
a September call-up for the Cubs in 2008,[2] making his major league debut 
on September 2. He went 0 for 1 in his first game. Following the season, 
he was claimed off of waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers, and added to their 
40-man roster. On March 31, 2009, it was announced that he would be a reserve 
infielder for the Brewers in 2009. When Ryan Braun got injured, third baseman 
Bill Hall played at Braun's position in left field, while McGehee started 
at third base. When Rickie Weeks got injured, he made his first start at 
second base.[3] With Bill Hall struggling at the plate, and Mat Gamel struggling 
on defense, he saw a lot of time at third base. He hit his first home run 
on June 14, 2009 off of Mark Buehrle of the Chicago White Sox; it was one 
of his two RBIs in the game. On June 29, 2009, he hit his first career 
grand slam off of New York Mets pitcher Brian Stokes, which came after 
he committed an error that led to two unearned runs. On July 4, McGehee 
had career highs of four hits and five RBIs against the Chicago Cubs. Although 
he came up short on the NL Rookie of the Year balloting for 2009, his solid 
season cemented him a starting job at third base for the Brewers in 2010. 
McGehee was voted the Brewers' Most Valuable Player. He edged out second 
baseman Rickie Weeks and outfielder Corey Hart for the award. McGehee batted 
.285 with 23 home runs and a team-leading 104 RBIs in 157 games. On August 
12, McGehee sets a team record with nine consecutive hits in going 4 for 
4 in the Brewers' 8-4 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. McGehee hit a 
home run, a double, and two singles, driving in four and scoring three 
runs to lead Milwaukee. He grounded out in his first at-bat the next day 
to end his streak.[4] In 2011, he batted .223 with 13 home runs, three 
of which came in the same game on August 3. All three were off of St. Louis 
Cardinals pitcher Edwin Jackson.[5] He led all NL third basemen in errors, 
with 20.[5] On December 12, 2011, hours after the Brewers agreed to a contract 
with Aramis Ramírez, McGehee was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for José 
Veras.[6] On July 31, 2012, McGehee was traded to the New York Yankees 
for RHP Chad Qualls.[7] The Yankees traded for 1B/3B McGehee after injuries 
to Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira. On August 28, 2012, McGehee was optioned 
to Class-A Charleston to make room on the 25-man roster for a recently 
acquired Steve Pearce.[8] He was recalled when rosters expanded in September. 
He signed a $1.5 million contract to play in Japan for the Tohoku Rakuten 
Golden Eagles on December 21, 2012.[9] McGehee led the Golden Eagles to 
their 1st Japan Series title. Also leading the way were Japan Series MVP 
Manabu Mima, current Yankees star Masahiro Tanaka, and fellow former MLB 
outfielder Andruw Jones. In 144 games, mostly at third base, McGehee hit 
.292 with 28 HR and 93 RBI. McGehee's period in Japan paid off, and on 
December 18, 2013, McGehee signed a one-year, $1.1 million deal with the 
Miami Marlins to start at third base. McGehee hit his first Marlins home 
run on May 10, despite hitting .309 with 23 RBI in 36 games before. It 
was in Miami that Casey earned his nickname "Hits McGehee". It is a play 
on a joke from the movie Anchorman. In 159 games of 2014, McGehee grounded 
into an MLB-leading 31 double plays while batting .289 with 4 home runs 
and 76 RBI, winning the Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year 
Award for the National League. On December 19, 2014, McGehee was traded 
to the San Francisco Giants in exchange for minor league pitchers Kendry 
Flores and Luis Castillo.[10] He was designated for assignment on May 24.[11][12] 
On May 26, McGehee accepted an assignment to the Giants AAA team, the Sacramento 
River Cats,[13] but was promoted up a couple weeks later after batting 
.357 (15-for-42) with two homers and three doubles.[14] He was designated 
for assignment again on June 30.[15] On July 10, 2015, the Miami Marlins 
signed McGehee to a one-year contract.[16] On February 23, 2016, the Detroit 
Tigers signed McGehee to a minor league contract.[17] On March 28, 2016, 
McGehee was released by the Tigers.[18] On March 30, the Tigers re-signed 
McGehee to a minor league contract.[19] On June 18, 2016, the Tigers purchased 
McGehee's contract from the Toledo Mud Hens.[20] In early August 2016, 
McGehee was called up to the major leagues by the Tigers following an injury 
to Nick Castellanos.[21] McGehee is married to wife, Sarah, and has two 
children, Mackail (Mack) and Cooper Reese.[22] Mack has Cerebral palsy.[23] 
They met in Jackson, Tennessee where Sarah lived and Casey played for the
