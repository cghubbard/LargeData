The following is a list of annual leaders in shutouts in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). A shutout occurs when a single pitcher throws a complete game and 
does not allow the opposing team to score a single run. Walter Johnson 
holds the career shutout record with 110. The most shutouts pitched in 
one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander 
(1916) and George Bradley (1876). In the dead-ball era and throughout much 
of the first three-quarters of the twentieth century, starting pitchers 
were generally expected to perform complete games, and starting pitchers 
would throw dozens of complete games a year — thereby increasing a pitcher's 
chances of achieving a shutout. These shutout records are among the most 
secure records in baseball, as pitchers today rarely earn more than one 
or two shutouts per season with the heavy emphasis on pitch counts and 
relief pitching. Pitchers today will often pitch only a few, if any, complete 
games a season. In 2009, five pitchers tied the National League with only 
two shutouts, and in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2015, the American 
League leaders also only had two shutouts. * – Denotes a member of the
