In Major League Baseball, the 300 win club is the group of pitchers who 
have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. 
Early in the history of professional baseball, many of the rules favored 
the pitcher over the batter; the distance pitchers threw to home plate 
was shorter than today, and pitchers were able to use foreign substances 
to alter the direction of the ball.[1] The first player to win 300 games 
was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of 
their career wins in the 19th century: Galvin, Cy Young, Kid Nichols, Tim 
Keefe, John Clarkson, Charley Radbourn, and Mickey Welch.[2] Four more 
pitchers joined the club in the first quarter of the 20th century: Christy 
Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander.[1] 
Young is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered 
unbreakable.[3] If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 
seasons, he would still be 11 games short of Young's mark. Only three pitchers, 
Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, joined the 300 win club between 
1924 and 1982, which may be explained by a number of factors: the abolition 
of the spitball,[1][a] World War II military service, such as Bob Feller's,[5] 
and the growing importance of the home run in the game.[1] As the home 
run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically 
increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation.[1][2] 
Between 1982 and 1990, the 300 win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, 
Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton and Tom Seaver.[2] These 
pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, 
an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger 
Stadium and the Astrodome, that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed 
offensive production.[2] Also, the increasing sophistication of training 
methods and sports medicine, such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players 
to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time.[6] Randy Johnson, 
for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.[7] Since 
1990, only four pitchers have joined the 300 win club: Roger Clemens, Greg 
Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in the game in the last decade 
of the 20th century have made attaining 300 career wins difficult, perhaps 
more so than during the mid 20th century.[8] The four-man starting rotation 
has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer 
chances to pick up wins.[2] No pitcher reached 20 wins in a non strike-shortened 
year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009.[9] Recording 
300 career wins has been seen as a guaranteed admission to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame.[10][11][12] All pitchers with 300 wins have been elected 
to the Hall of Fame[13] except for Clemens, who received only half of the 
vote total needed for induction in his first appearance on the Hall of 
Fame ballot in 2013[14] and lost votes from that total in 2014.[15] Clemens' 
future election is seen as uncertain because of his alleged links to use 
of performance-enhancing drugs.[16] To be eligible for the Hall of Fame, 
a player must have "been retired five seasons" or deceased for at least 
six months,[17] Many observers expect the club to gain few, if any, members 
in the foreseeable future.[13][18][19] Ten members of the 300 win club
