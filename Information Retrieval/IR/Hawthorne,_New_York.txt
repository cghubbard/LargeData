Hawthorne is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located in the 
town of Mount Pleasant in Westchester County, New York. The population 
was 4,586 at the 2010 census.[1] The village was originally known as Hammond's 
Mills, and was part of Frederick Philipse's estate Philipsburgh. On September 
23, 1780, Major John André stopped here on his way to New York to ask directions 
after meeting with Benedict Arnold. After the Revolutionary War, the name 
of the village changed to Unionville. The hamlet's population consisted 
mostly of farmers. The Reformed Church of Unionville (Hawthorne Reformed 
Church) was built here in 1818. In 1832, a one-room school house was built. 
In 1847, a railroad station was established on New York Central's Harlem 
Division, with the name Unionville. A post office was established on February 
10, 1851, and was designated Neperan after the Indian name for the Saw 
Mill River. In the early 1890s, real-estate developer Louis Smadbeck began 
buying up the area farms to subdivide into parcels, which were sold to 
working- and middle-class people looking to live outside the city. In 1901, 
Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, also known as Mother Mary Alphonsa, O.P., a convert 
to Catholicism and daughter of Nathaniel Hawthorne, founded Rosary Hill 
Home in Sherman Park (now Thornwood) for those suffering from incurable 
cancer. Mother Mary Alphonsa also founded a Dominican Order now known as 
the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne. Shortly after the opening of the cancer 
home, the hamlet was renamed Hawthorne in Mother Mary Alphonsa's honor. 
Rosary Hill Home is still operated by the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne 
and is located on a hilltop on Linda Avenue. Hawthorne is the final resting 
place of Babe Ruth, James Cagney, Billy Martin, Malachi Martin, Dorothy 
Kilgallen, Ernesto Lecuona and many other notables interred at Gate of 
Heaven Cemetery. The Hammond House was listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places in 1980.[2] Hawthorne is located at 41°6′13″N 73°47′45″W﻿

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area 
of 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2), all land.[1] Bounded by Route 9A to the 
west, the Taconic State Parkway to the east, and split in the middle by 
the Sprain Brook Parkway, Hawthorne lies near the geographic center of 
Westchester County. Corporate parks and nurseries line Hawthorne's Route 
9A corridor. Commerce Street (Route 141), the main commercial thoroughfare 
serving both Hawthorne and Thornwood, runs north to south, parallel to 
Metro-North's Harlem Line tracks. It is a 40-minute train ride from the 
Hawthorne station to Grand Central Terminal. The majority of Hawthorne 
consists of residential homes and small businesses. Stores on Elwood Avenue 
include The Lock House, the Hawthorne Station Deli (also known as the "Railroad 
Deli"), Pop's Deli, Office Dynamics, and Hawthorne Pizzeria. On July 12, 
2006, an F2 tornado struck the hamlet, causing major damage to the California 
Closets Warehouse and minor injuries to three people. It was the strongest 
tornado to strike in Westchester County. Hawthorne's residents are served 
by the Mount Pleasant Central School District, which includes the Hawthorne 
Elementary School, Columbus Elementary School, Westlake Middle School and 
Westlake High School (the latter three actually located in Thornwood). 
The Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services (formerly "Jewish Board 
of Guardians")[4] runs two residential schools in Hawthorne, the Hawthorne 
Cedar Knolls School[5] and the Linden Hill High School;[6] both of these 
schools are on Linda Avenue. Hawthorne Cedar Knolls School with less than 
thirty students eligible to play varsity sports (football, basketball and 
baseball) boasted numerous championship teams in the varsity sports during 
the sixties and seventies (playing in a small school league named the Tri-State 
league, NY, NJ, and Conn.). HCKS went undefeated in all three varsity sports 
and winning the championships in 1972-1973 and again in 1974-1975). Hawthorne's
