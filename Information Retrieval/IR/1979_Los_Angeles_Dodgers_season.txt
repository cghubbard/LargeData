in BOLD won League Championships The Dodgers drafted 36 players in the 
June draft and 11 in the January draft. Of those, five players would eventually 
play in the Major Leagues. The Dodgers lost their first round pick in the 
June draft to the San Diego Padres because they signed free agent Derrel 
Thomas but they gained the first round picks of the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(compensation for Lee Lacy) and New York Yankees (for Tommy John). With 
those picks they drafted two players from the University of Michigan, left-handed 
pitcher Steve Howe and right-handed pitcher Steve Perry. Howe was the 1980 
NL Rookie of the Year, a 1981 World Series Champion and a 1982 All-Star. 
He played in 12 seasons and saved 328 games before a drug addiction forced 
him out of the game. Perry pitched six seasons in the minors, the last 
two with the AAA Albuquerque Dukes, and finished 28-40 with a 5.34 ERA 
before the Dodgers released him. This years draft class also included pitcher 
Orel Hershiser from Bowling Green University, who was picked in the 17th 
round. He pitched 18 seasons (13 with the Dodgers), winning 204 games. 
He set a Major League record with a 59 consecutive scoreless inning streak 
in 1988 en route to winning the Cy Young Award and the World Series MVP.
