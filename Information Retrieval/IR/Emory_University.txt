Emory University is a private research university in metropolitan Atlanta, 
located in the Druid Hills section of DeKalb County, Georgia, United States.[16] 
The university was founded as Emory College in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia 
by the Methodist Episcopal Church and was named in honor of Methodist bishop 
John Emory.[17] In 1915, the college relocated to metropolitan Atlanta 
and was rechartered as Emory University. The university is the second-oldest 
private institution of higher education in Georgia and among the fifty 
oldest private universities in the United States.[18] Emory University 
has nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford 
College, Goizueta Business School, Laney Graduate School, School of Law, 
School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Rollins School 
of Public Health, and the Candler School of Theology.[19] Emory University, 
the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Peking University in Beijing, 
China jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical 
Engineering.[20][21] The university operates the Confucius Institute in 
Atlanta in partnership with Nanjing University.[22][23] Emory has a growing 
faculty research partnership with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science 
and Technology (KAIST).[24][25][26] Emory University students come from 
all 50 states, 6 territories of the United States, and over 100 foreign 
countries.[27] Emory Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in the 
state of Georgia[28] and comprises seven major hospitals, including the 
internationally renowned Emory University Hospital and Emory University 
Hospital Midtown.[29] The university operates the Winship Cancer Institute, 
Yerkes National Primate Research Center, and many disease and vaccine research 
centers.[30][31][32] Emory University is the leading coordinator of both 
the NIAID's Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC)[33] and the 
U.S. Health Department's National Ebola Training and Education Center. 
[34] The university is one of four institutions involved in the NIAID's 
Tuberculosis Research Units Program.[35] The International Association 
of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university[36] 
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer 
Society are national affiliate institutions located adjacent to the campus.[37] 
The university is partnered with the Carter Center.[38] Emory University 
is 16th among the list of colleges and universities in the United States 
by endowment,[39] 21st among universities in the world by endowment,[40] 
and 20th in U.S. News & World Report's 2017 National Universities Rankings.[41] 
Emory University has a Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher 
Education status of R1: "highest research activity" and is cited for high 
scientific performance and citation impact in the CWTS Leiden Ranking.[42] 
The National Science Foundation ranked the university 36th among academic 
institutions in the United States for research and development (R&D) expenditures.[43] 
Emory University research is funded primarily by federal government agencies, 
namely the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[44] In 1995 Emory University 
was elected to the Association of American Universities, an association 
of the 62 leading research universities in the United States & Canada.[11] 
Emory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal 
Church.[47] The college was named in honor of the departed Methodist bishop 
John Emory.[47] Ignatius Alphonso Few was the college's first president. 
In 1854, the Atlanta Medical College, a forerunner of Emory University 
School of Medicine, was founded. On April 12, 1861, the American Civil 
War began. Emory College was closed in November 1861 and all of its students 
enlisted on the Confederate side.[47] In late 1863 the war came to Georgia 
and the college was used as hospital and later a headquarters for the Union 
Army. The university produced many officers who served in the war, including 
General George Thomas Anderson (1846C) who fought in nearly every major 
battle in the eastern theater.[48] Thirty five Emory students lost their 
lives and much of the campus was destroyed during the war.[49] Emory College, 
as with the entire Southeastern United States, struggled to overcome financial 
devastation during the Reconstruction Era. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, 
Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the 
end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George 
I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its 
debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. 
In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, 
a polymath professor at Emory College. Hopkins became the first president 
of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1888. Emory University's first 
international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893.[50] Yun became an 
important political activist in Korea and is the author of "Aegukga", the 
national anthem of the Republic of Korea.[51][52] On August 16, 1906, the 
Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed 
the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. In 1914, 
the Candler School of Theology was established. In 1915, Emory College 
relocated to metropolitan Atlanta and was rechartered as Emory University 
after accepting a land grant from Asa Griggs Candler, founder of the The 
Coca-Cola Company. The Emory University School of Law was established in 
1916. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its 
reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in 
medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts. On April 6, 1917 
the United States entered the First World War. Emory University organized 
a medical unit, composed of medical school faculty and medical alumni, 
that would be known as Emory Unit, Base Hospital 43. The unit served in 
Loir-et-Cher, France from July 1918 to January 1919. The Emory Unit, Base 
Hospital 43 was remobilized during the Second World War and served in the 
North African Campaign and Europe. To recognize Emory’s participation in 
the war effort, a ship was christened M.S. Emory Victory and served through 
World War II and in the Korean War. In the 1940s, Emory University students, 
alumni, and faculty served in the Asia-Pacific War and European theater 
of World War II. Bobby Jones (golfer), served during the Battle of Normandy.[53] 
Dr. Alfred A. Weinstein, a professor of surgery at Emory University School 
of Medicine, was a prisoner of war of the Empire of Japan between 1942 
and 1945. His memoir "Barbed Wire Surgeon" is considered one of the finest 
accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights 
the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe.[54] Kiyoshi Tanimoto, 
who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed 
in John Hersey's Hiroshima (book), was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens 
reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while 
studying in the United States.[55] Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student 
at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily 
until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Emory helped the 
nation prepare for war by participating in the V-12 Navy College Training 
Program and Army Specialized Training Program, programs designed to supplement 
the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy and United 
States Army. The Candler School of Theology trained men for military chaplaincy. 
During the war, university enrollment boasted two military students for 
every one civilian. Emory University alumni would go on to serve in the 
Korean War, Second Indochina War (Vietnam War), Persian Gulf War, Yugoslav 
Wars, and the Global War on Terrorism. The Women's Movement and Civil Rights 
Movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped 
the future of Emory University. Formerly an all-male school, Emory officially 
became a coeducational institution in 1953. Although it had previously 
admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before 
had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident 
students. In 1959, sororities first appeared on campus. In 1962, in the 
midst of the Civil Rights Movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end 
racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the 
Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Previously, Georgia law denied tax-exempt 
status to private universities with racially integrated student bodies. 
The Supreme Court of Georgia ruled in Emory's favor and Emory officially 
became racially integrated. Marvin S. Arrington, Sr. was Emory University's 
first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University 
School of Law in 1967.[56] Emory's diversity and academic reputation flourished 
under the leadership of the university's fifth president, James T. Laney. 
In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in 
the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty 
and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and 
thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961-1987). 
On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile 
in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy 
at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.[57] 
Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South 
Korea, served as the 8th President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and 
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation 
of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador 
to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named 
in his honor in 2009.[56] In 2005, the university presented the President 
Medal, an rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the 
world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural 
achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. The award is 
one of the highest honors presented by Emory.[59] In 2014, at Emory’s 169th 
Commencement, John Lewis, the only living "Big Six" leader of the Civil 
Rights Movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary 
doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received 
a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights 
and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship 
which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar 
with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated 
desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. The 
law school has committed to raise an additional $500,000 to fund the chair 
fully.[60] The course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 
1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the 
institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. At the time 
this was the largest single gift to any institution of higher education 
in American history, and it made a profound impact on Emory's direction 
in the next two decades, boosting the university to the top ranks of American 
research universities.[47] As one of the fastest-growing research universities 
in the United States in the 21st century, Emory University has established 
a national reputation on the strength of the scholarly achievements of 
its faculty and students, its highly ranked professional schools, a long-term 
commitment to the arts and sciences, and the presence of more than seventy 
cutting-edge research centers that are addressing major social problems.[56] 
Emory has extended its ties to the community, creating close links with 
Atlanta's neighborhoods, clinics, hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and 
boardrooms. To accommodate its growth, Emory has undergone a physical transformation 
that has increased classroom and research space. The latest additions to 
the campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, 
scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and 
the performing arts.[56] The Emory College of Arts and Sciences offers

the university.[77] The Annual Robert W. Woodruff Library Undergraduate 
Research Award recognizes undergraduate students who make extensive use 
of Woodruff Library’s collections and research resources in their original 
scholarship and show evidence of critical analysis in their research skills.[78] 
In 2012, the Princeton Review ranked the Robert W. Woodruff Library among 
the top 10 "Best College Libraries" in the United States.[79] In 2013, 
the Pitts Theology Library of the Candler School of Theology was named 
as one of "Most Beautiful College Libraries in the World."[80] Emory University 
is ranked 20th among national universities in the United States by U.S. 
News & World Report and tied for 82nd among global universities in the 
Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2016-17. The university 
has been named both a Hidden Ivy and a "New Ivy".[89] Business Insider

BBA Program 9th in the nation in 2014. The Economist ranked Goizueta Business 
School's MBA program 13th in the nation in 2014. In 2012, following an 
internal investigation led by Emory Provost Earl Lewis and Jones Day Law 
Firm, Emory University announced that members of Emory University's Office 
of Admission and Institutional Research intentionally misreported data 
concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings 
between 2000-2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank 
colleges and universities.[99] For example, while the office reported that 
89% of its students graduated in the top 10% of their class, only 75% actually 
had. Following the investigation, the individuals responsible for the misreportings 
were fired or resigned and the university issued a public apology.[100] 
The university made several corrective actions in 2012 and 2013, including 
the hiring of independent data advisers, to ensure accurate data collection 
and reporting in the future.[101] Emory University has a Carnegie Classification 
of Institutions of Higher Education status of RU/VH: "very high research 
activity". According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, the university 
is 5th among universities in the United States with licensing revenue per 
dollars spent on research.[102] The university is the 4th largest contributor 
in the nation to the discovery of new drugs and vaccines among public-sector 
research institutions.[103] The Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, 
ranked Emory 6th among universities in the United States and Canada for 
global health contributions and research.[104] In 2015, Emory received 
$572.4 million from external funding agencies.[105] Emory University leads 
the nation in the number of students with Kirschstein-National Research 
Service Award pre-doctoral fellowships from the National Institutes of 
Health.[106] Emory University has a strong partnership with the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 1947, the university donated 
15 acres of land to the United States Department of Health and Human Services 
for the construction of the CDC headquarters.[107] The Emory University 
Prevention Research Center (EPRC) and Emory Center for Injury Control are 
funded by the CDC.[31][108] Emory University's African Center of Excellence 
for Public Health Security, which seeks to improve preparedness and response 
to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar 
cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National 
Public Health Institutes (IANPHI).[109] The Emory University Center for 
Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, 
and training to promote global health equity through universal access to 
safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC.[110][111] 
The Emory University Global Health Institute, funded by the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, partners with the CDC to enhance public health infrastructure 
in low-resource countries.[112] The Emory University Hospital Isolation 
Unit and Quarantine Station was established by the CDC following the 2003 
SARS outbreak.[113] The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University 
played a crucial role in ending the 2014 Ebola virus cases in the United 
States.[114] CDC scientists and administrators hold memberships and frequently 
speak at Emory University's Vaccine Dinner Club (VDC), an association that 
holds monthly academic meetings to discuss and advance vaccine research.[115] 
In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, 
a research program in which CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion 
(DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection 
control and prevention research.[116][117] In 2015, Emory University, the 
London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Public Health Foundation 
of India, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences established the 
Center for Control of Chronic Conditions in New Delhi, India. The center 
aims to improve the prevention and care of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, 
mental health, and injuries in India.[118] The International Association 
of National Public Health Institutes is based at the university. The association 
was chartered in 2006 with a $20 million, five-year grant through Emory 
University from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2015, the Emory 
Global Health Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
were made lead partners for the newly created, $75 million Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation funded Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance 
Network (CHAMPS).[119] Emory University research is heavily funded by the 
United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes 
of Health.[44] The federal agency awarded the university nearly $300 million 
in the fiscal year of 2015.[105] In 2015, Emory University was one of four 
institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research 
Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research 
and reduce the global burden of the disease.[35] In 2015, an Emory-led 
research consortium received a five-year, 15 million dollar grant from 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research human immune responses 
to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination.[120] The university 
also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support 
one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in Fragile X syndrome. 
The grant is a renewal of Emory’s National Fragile X Research Center, continuously 
funded by the NIH for more than 10 years.[105] In 2015, the university 
received a $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, 
Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive 
oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore 
new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic 
aneurysms.[105] In 2015, the university received a $8 million grant over 
five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of 
how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses. 
The researchers will create and disseminate powerful, user-friendly modeling 
tools for use by the wider research community in developing more effective 
vaccines.[105] In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over 
five years from the NIH to examine the effects of maternal stress on brain 
function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including 
the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome.[105] In 
2015, the university received a $3.5 million grant over five years from 
the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) for an Informatics Technology for 
Cancer Research award. Winship Cancer Institute and Emory School of Medicine 
researchers will develop software tools to help the cancer research community 
gain new insights from cancer imaging “big data” and develop new open-source 
cancer research applications.[105] In 2015, the university received a $3.4 
million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease 
Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center 
and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology 
(ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.[105] 
The Emory University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and the Emory Vaccine 
Center are world leaders in AIDS Vaccine Development and HIV Parthenogenesis 
studies are funded by nine different institutes of the National Institutes 
of Health and by the Georgia Research Alliance.[30] The centers include 
one of the largest groups of academic vaccine scientists in the world and 
are currently attempting to develop an effective HIV vaccine.[121] Emory 
University Researchers Dr. Dennis C. Liotta, Dr. Raymond F. Schinazi and 
Dr. Woo-Baeg Choi discovered Emtricitabine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor (NRTI) used in the treatment of HIV. The drug was named as one 
of the world's most important antiviral drugs by the World Health Organization 
and is included in their Model List of Essential Medicines.[122] Emory 
University is a global leader in Ebola research and treatment. The university 
was one of three institutions that successfully treated medical evacuees 
during the 2014 Ebola Outbreak. In 2015, the United States Department of 
Health and Human Services named Emory University the lead coordinating 
center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC).[34] 
The university will collaborate with the University of Nebraska Medical 
Center, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of the Assistant Secretary 
for Preparedness and Response on the program, which will receive $12 million 
in funding over the next five years.The program will support training of 
health care providers and facilities to manage Ebola and other emerging 
infectious diseases. Its objectives are to develop metrics to measure facility 
and health care worker readiness to care for Ebola patients, conduct assessments 
of state and regional Ebola Treatment Centers, create education materials 
related to care of patients with possible Ebola and other special pathogens 
and offer technical and training assistance to public health departments 
and health facilities.[34] The university also received a $10.8 million 
grant over three years from the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to lead a 10-institution national team 
developing improved therapeutics and vaccines for multiple strains of Ebola 
virus.[105] In 2015, Emory received a three-year, $2.2 million grant from 
the CDC to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including Ebola, 
in health-care facilities.[117] Emory and the Georgia Institute of Technology 
have a strong research partnership. In 2015, Emory and Georgia Tech were 
awarded an $8.3 million grant by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
to establish a National Exposure Assessment Laboratory.[123] The Laboratory 
will research the impact of environmental chemicals on children's health.[123] 
In 2015, the two universities received a five-year, $2.9 million grant 
from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to create new bachelor’s, master’s, 
and doctoral degree programs and concentrations in healthcare robotics, 
which will be the first program of its kind in the Southeastern United 
States.[124] In 2015, Emory University, Georgia Tech, and Children’s Healthcare 
of Atlanta were awarded a four-year, $1.8 million grant by the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation in order to expand the Atlanta Cystic Fibrosis Research and 
Development Program. As of 2015, Emory jointly manages the second largest 
cystic fibrosis population in the United States.[32] In 2015, Emory and 
Georgia Tech received a $1.6 million grant from the Coulter Translational 
Research Partnership Program to accelerate nine promising technologies 
developed in research laboratories with commercialization potential.[105] 
In 2015, Emory University received a $15 million grant from the Wounded 
Warrior Project in order to establish the "Warrior Care Network" and develop 
innovative approaches to treat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).[125] In 2015, Emory University 
and the University of South Florida received a $2.5 million grant over 
five years from the John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) to study 
links between infectious disease transmission and agricultural practices.[105] 
The Emory University main campus, established in the early twentieth century, 
covers more than 600 acres in Atlanta's historic suburb of Druid Hills.[126] 
The university campus is heavily forested with pine, maples, oak, and magnolias, 
and Peavine Creek, a branch of the Peachtree Creek, runs through the campus. 
The Arbor Day Foundation named Emory a Tree Campus USA school in 2015.[127] 
Many of the university's buildings are designed with multi-hued granite 
and Spanish Saltillo tile. The university has one of the largest inventories 
by square footage of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified 
building space among campuses in the United States.[128] In 2015, The Best 
Colleges, a Seattle-based educational ranking service, named Emory one 
of the top ten "Most Amazing College Campuses."[126] The campus is home 
to the Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the 
largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, 
the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia’s first and only cancer center designated 
by the National Cancer Institute,[129] the Yerkes National Primate Research 
Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health–funded national primate 
research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student 
facilitates. Undergraduate dormitories include the Undergraduate Residential 
Center, Clairmont Residential Center, Tower Apartments, Alabama Hall, Complex, 
Dobbs Hall, Holmes Hall, Longstreet-Means Hall, Raoul Hall and Turman Hall. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, 
Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston hospital, and Emory Point are 
located adjacent to the campus. In 2015, a $52 million expansion and renovation 
project of the Sanford S. Atwood Chemistry Center was completed. The new, 
270,000 square-foot complex features state of the art laboratories, interactive 
teaching and study spaces, and a chemistry library.[130] The completion 
of the complex was accompanied by a $1.2 million grant from the Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute to advance and modernize the university's chemistry 
curriculum.[130] In the Candler Library Annex of Robert W. Woodruff Library, 
there is a 1920s Pietro Caproni reproduction of Bertel Thorvaldsen's "The 
Triumph of Alexander" frieze. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and 
his army entering Babylon following their victory over the Achaemenid Empire 
in the Battle of Gaugamela.[131] During the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, 
Georgia, the university hosted the United States Olympic women's gymnastics 
team on its main campus.[132] The team, known as the Magnificent Seven, 
won the first ever gold medal for the United States in the women's team 
all-around competition. The university housed international officials and 
journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. The Cox Hall 
Ballroom was transformed into a news center for the Olympic foreign press.[132] 
Emory University's original campus was established in Oxford, Georgia in 
1836. The 56-acres campus is home to Oxford College of Emory University 
and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American 
Civil War.[49] Many of the buildings were designed with Neoclassical architecture 
and Gothic Revival architecture. In 1975, the United States National Register 
of Historic Places designated the campus as part of the Oxford Historic 
District.[133] Emory University's total enrollment for the 2015-2016 academic 
year is 14,724 students, with 7,803 undergraduates and 6,921 graduate and 
professional students. Students come from all 50 states and more than 65 
countries.[136] The student to faculty ratio is 7:1, with an average class 
size of 25 students.[137] Of the 1,389 students in the Class of 2018, 46% 
are Caucasian, 31% are Asian, 10% are Black/African American, 9% are Latino/Hispanic, 
and 3% did not identity; 56% are female and 44% are male.[138] Emory University 
has awarded 4,568 degrees during the 2014-2105 year. Of those awards 2,366 
were undergraduate and 2,202 were graduate.[139] Emory University's average 
GPA for incoming freshman is a 3.70-3.97.[140] Students may engage in the 
performing and fine arts as an area of academic study or as extracurricular 
activities. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, 
theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative 
writing.[141] Graduate programs in art history, film studies, and music 
are offered.[142] There are more than 50 student organizations dedicated 
to the arts. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, 
breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy.[143] Emory routinely 
hosts arts events in the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts that are open 
to the Emory and Atlanta communities. Recent performances include Bang 
on a Can All-Stars (a side project of drummer Glenn Kotche from the rock 
band Wilco), jazz performer Esperanza Spalding, and New York’s Cedar Lake 
Dance Company. A program called Creativity Conversations brings artistic 
minds to campus to discuss art and the creative process. Guests have included 
Philip Glass, Jimmy Carter, Salman Rushdie, Seamus Heaney and Rita Dove.[144][145][146] 
Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement.[147] 
Emory ranks among top schools in both the U.S. News & World Report’s rankings 
of the best national universities and the Directors Cup of the National 
Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics for best all-around athletics 
program.[148] Emory's 18 varsity sports teams, known as the Eagles, are 
members of the NCAA’s Division III University Athletic Association (UAA). 
However, Emory does not have an intercollegiate football team.[149] The 
Barkley Forum Center for Debate Education is an intercollegiate debate 
organization at Emory University.[150] The center is named in honor of 
Emory alumnus, Alben Barkley, 35th Vice President of the United States, 
and is directed by Melissa Wade. Debating was established at the university 
in 1837 and the intercollegiate debate team was formed by Nolan A. Goodyear 
in 1914. Emory's Barkley Forum debate team has won 3 National Debate Tournaments 
and over 25 individual champion speaker awards.[151] The university received 
the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the 
highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for 
their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement.[152] 
About 25% of Emory students participate in Volunteer Emory, Emory's umbrella 
community service group. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer 
Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied 
organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Trees Atlanta, 
PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club.[153] Emory Cares International 
Service Day brings together students, alumni and other community members 
to volunteer at a number of projects organized by Emory and its many partners 
around the city of Atlanta and in cities worldwide.[154] The Emory Wheel 
is the student-run newspaper of Emory University. The Wheel is published 
twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday, during the regular school year, and 
is updated regularly at its website. Serving the Emory community since 
1919, the Wheel is editorially and financially independent from the University. 
The staff is composed entirely of students, with the exception of the general 
manager, who oversees advertising and whose salary is paid by the newspaper. 
[155][156] Through the Centers of International Programs Abroad, Emory 
University students can study in over 40 countries at the top academic 
institutions in the world including the National University of Singapore, 
Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies, Nanjing University, Oxford University, 
Imperial College London, the School of Oriental and African Studies, Yonsei 
University, Trinity College Dublin, University of St. Andrews, University 
of Melbourne, University of Amsterdam, University of Cape Town, and Tel 
Aviv University.[157] Fraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early 
as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's "temple" of the 
Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established 
anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities 
play an important part in leavening Emory's campus life. For undergraduates, 
Greek life comprises approximately 30% of the Emory student population. 
The Office of Greek Life recognizes and regulates on-campus chapters of 
fraternities and sororities.[158] Fraternities have on-campus housing located 
on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity 
houses.[159] Greek Life is an important social engagement for students, 
but it is not totally exclusive—students from different sororities and 
fraternities regularly socialize, and the college's emphasis on on-campus 
housing helps students make friends inside and outside the Greek system.The 
intramural sports program provides an athletic outlet for the entire Emory 
community. Emory has numerous club sports[160] and a variety of recreational 
and competitive intramural teams.[161] The Outdoor Emory Organization sponsors 
weekend trips of outdoor activities such as rafting, rock climbing and 
hiking.[162] Hundreds of student clubs and organizations operate on Emory's 
campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and 
service organizations.The Student Government Association (SGA) charters 
and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents 
students' interests when dealing with the administration.[163] The SGA 
oversees divisional councils, each coinciding with the undergraduate, graduate 
and professional schools of the university. Notable among these are the 
College Council (CC) which handles students concerns primarily for the 
undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually 
sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar 
activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. The Student Programming 
Council (SPC) is the school's primary programming organization, responsible 
for planning five events every year: Homecoming Week, Fall Band Party, 
Spring Band Party, Swoopstock and Dooley's Week.[164] Emory also has several 
secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Senior Honor Society, 
Ducemus, Speculum, and The Order of Ammon.[165] Emory has a partnership 
with Coca-Cola in which they pledged 3 million dollars over a 5-year period 
for "Service for Learning" which projects that Emory student volunteers 
participate to help preserve nature trails, create urban farms, as well 
as restore neighborhood parks.[166] Emory University also has many Black 
student organizations, including: the Black Student Alliance, the National 
Association for the Advacement of Colored People (NAACP), and Voices of 
Inner Strength Gospel Choir (VOIS). Emory University has over 13,200 faculty 
and staff members and over 133,000 living alumni. Awards and honors recognizing 
Emory alumni and faculty include the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, Bancroft Prize, Booker Prize, Lenore Marshall Poetry 
Prize, National Humanities Medal, Peabody Award, Breakthrough Prize in 
Life Sciences, Guggenheim Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowship, American Mathematical 
Society Fellowship, MacArthur Fellows Program, Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall 
Scholarship, and membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, Howard Hughes Medical 
Institute, American Society for Clinical Investigation, National Academy 
of Sciences, and National Research Council.[167][168] Notable Alumni: Alben
