As Player As Manager As Coach As General Manager Herold Dominic "Muddy" 
Ruel (February 20, 1896 – November 13, 1963) was an American professional 
baseball player, coach, manager and general manager. He played as a catcher 
in Major League Baseball for 19 seasons with the St. Louis Browns, New 
York Yankees, Washington Senators, Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and 
the Chicago White Sox. Ruel was one of the top defensive catchers of his 
era, and is best remembered for scoring the winning run for the Washington 
Senators in Game 7 of the 1924 World Series and, for being the battery-mate 
of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, Walter Johnson.[1][2][3] Born in St. 
Louis, Missouri, Ruel began his professional baseball career at the age 
of 19 with his hometown team, the St. Louis Browns, appearing in 10 games 
during the 1915 season.[4] He then played in the minor leagues for two 
seasons with the Memphis Chickasaws before joining the New York Yankees 
in 1918.[5] With the Yankees, Ruel shared catching duties with Truck Hannah 
from 1918 to 1920.[4] He was the Yankees catcher on August 16, 1920 when 
a Carl Mays' pitch hit Ray Chapman on the head, resulting in Chapman's 
death the next day.[6] He later defended Mays and said that he was innocent 
of any wrongdoing. Ruel would be traded to the Boston Red Sox in 1921, 
where he played for two seasons before being traded to the Washington Senators 
in 1923.[7] In the 1923 season, he posted a career-high batting average 
of .316 along with 54 runs batted in.[4] He led American League catchers 
in assists and putouts, and finished 11th in the American League Most Valuable 
Player Award ballot.[8][9] He had another solid year in 1924, playing in 
149 games and once again leading the American League catchers in assists 
and putouts.[4][10] With Ruel calling the pitches, Walter Johnson's career 
was revitalized, as he led the league with 23 victories and a 2.72 earned 
run average.[11] The Senators clinched the 1924 American League pennant, 
finishing the season two games ahead of the New York Yankees. The Senators 
would face John McGraw's heavily favored New York Giants in the 1924 World 
Series.[12] The two teams traded wins back and forth until the series reached 
the seventh and deciding game. The Senators trailed the Giants 3 to 1 in 
the eighth inning of Game 7, when they rallied and tied the score.[13] 
Ruel hit a single, then scored the tying run during the rally, to send 
the game into extra innings with the score tied at three runs apeice.[13] 
In the bottom of the twelfth inning with Ruel at bat, he hit a high, foul 
ball directly over home plate.[1] The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped 
his protective mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, 
stumbled over it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance 
to bat.[1] On the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and, then proceeded to 
score the winning run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took a bad 
hop over third baseman Freddie Lindstrom's head.[1][13] Ruel had another 
good season in 1925, producing a .310 batting average along with 54 runs 
batted in and, for the third consecutive year, he led American League catchers 
in assists and putouts.[4][14] The Senators would win the American League 
pennant for the second year in a row, however they were defeated by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series.[15] Ruel hit for a .299 batting 
average in 1926 and led the American League catchers with a .989 fielding 
percentage, as the Senators slipped to a fourth-place finish.[4] He had 
one more good season in 1927, posting a .310 batting average and finishing 
second among catchers in fielding percentage, putouts, assists and baserunners 
caught stealing.[4][16] Ruel finished sixth in the 1927 American League 
Most Valuable Player Award balloting.[17] After the 1927 season, his offensive 
production began to diminish, and by 1929, Bennie Tate had begun to take 
over as the Senators' main catcher.[18] In December 1930, Ruel was purchased 
from the Senators by the Boston Red Sox, who then traded him to the Detroit 
Tigers in August 1931.[7] With the Tigers, he served as a reserve catcher 
in 1932 working behind Ray Hayworth.[19] He returned to the St. Louis Browns 
in 1933 before ending his playing career with the Chicago White Sox in 
1934 at the age of 38. In a nineteen-year major league career, Ruel played 
in 1,468 games, accumulating 1,242 hits in 4,514 at bats for a .275 career 
batting average along with 4 home runs, 534 runs batted in and a .365 on-base 
percentage.[4] He possessed strong defensive skills, leading American League 
catchers in fielding percentage three consecutive years (1926–28), finishing 
with a .982 career fielding percentage.[4][20] Ruel also led American League 
catchers three times in putouts and assists and twice in range factor and 
in baserunners caught stealing.[4] He made 23 double plays in 1924, the 
seventh highest season total for catchers in major league history.[21] 
His reputation as a defensive stand out is enhanced because of the era 
in which he played. In the Deadball Era, catchers played a huge defensive 
role, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well 
as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching 
staffs.[22] Richard Kendall of the Society for American Baseball Research 
devised an unscientific study that ranked Ruel as the fifth most dominating 
fielding catcher in major league history.[23] After retiring as a player, 
Ruel spent a decade as a coach with the Chicago White Sox from 1935 to 
1945.[2][24] He then became an assistant to Commissioner of Baseball Happy 
Chandler in 1946.[2][24] He worked with Chandler for only one year before 
accepting his only managerial job with the St. Louis Browns, where he led 
the 1947 team to a dismal 59–95 record, good for the American League cellar.[25] 
Ruel then coached for the Cleveland Indians from 1948 to 1950, winning 
another world championship as a coach with the Indians in the 1948 World 
Series.[2] He was later named as the director of the Detroit Tigers' farm 
system before taking on the role as the Tigers' general manager from 1954 
to 1956.[24] Ruel was one of the few major leaguers to hold a law degree.[24] 
He earned his degree from Washington University in St. Louis and was admitted 
to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.[2] He is buried at Alta Mesa
