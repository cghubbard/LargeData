The Toledo Blue Stockings formed as a minor league baseball team in Toledo, 
Ohio in 1883. They won the Northwestern League championship in 1883. Their 
home ballpark was League Park. The following year, they joined the major 
league American Association. That year, they finished 8th with a 46-58 
record. The team returned to the minors the next year and disbanded after 
the 1885 season. Historically, the team is best known for being the only 
major league team with black players (Moses Fleetwood Walker and his brother, 
Weldy Walker) prior to Jackie Robinson's appearance with the Brooklyn Dodgers
