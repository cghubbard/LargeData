Carl Owen Hubbell (June 22, 1903 – November 21, 1988), nicknamed "The Meal 
Ticket" and "King Carl", was an American baseball player. He was a member 
of the New York Giants in the National League from 1928 to 1943. He remained 
on the team's payroll for the rest of his life, long after their move to 
San Francisco. Twice voted the National League's Most Valuable Player, 
Hubbell was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. During 1936 
and 1937, Hubbell set the major league record for consecutive wins by a 
pitcher with 24. He is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 
1934 All-Star Game, when he struck out five of the game's great hitters 
in succession. Hubbell's primary pitch was the screwball. Hubbell was born 
in Carthage, Missouri and raised in Meeker, Oklahoma. He was originally 
signed by the Detroit Tigers and was invited to spring training in 1926. 
However, pitching coach George McBride and player-manager Ty Cobb weren't 
impressed with him. Additionally, they were concerned about his reliance 
on a screwball, a pitch that some believe places an unusual amount of stress 
on a pitcher's arm. Hubbell was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 
International League before the start of the season. He went 7–7 on a championship 
team. In 1927 he was invited to spring training again with Detroit, but 
the Tigers still weren't impressed and sent him two steps down the minor-league 
ladder, to the Decatur Commodores of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. 
Despite a 14–7 record, the Tigers didn't invite him back for 1928, and 
he was sent to the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League.,[1][2] Hubbell 
was so fed up by this time that he told Beaumont manager Claude Robinson 
that he would retire and go into the oil business unless he was sold to 
another organization by the end of the season.[3] Years later, he said 
that being unloaded by the Tigers was the best thing that ever happened 
to him. His break came that June, when Giants scout Dick Kinsella decided 
to take in a game between Hubbell's Exporters and the Houston Buffs while 
in Houston for the Democratic National Convention. He hadn't planned on 
doing any scouting, but he was impressed by Hubbell. Kinsella called Giants 
manager John McGraw and mentioned that he knew of Hubbell's release by 
Detroit, prompted in part by Cobb's concerns about the screwball. McGraw 
replied that Christy Mathewson had a screwball (a fadeaway, as it was called 
in his time) and it didn't seem to affect his arm. Kinsella followed Hubbell 
for a month and was still impressed.[1] Hubbell would go 10–6 in his first 
major league season and would pitch his entire career for the Giants. With 
a slow delivery of his screwball, Hubbell recorded five consecutive 20-win 
seasons for the Giants (1933–37) and helped his team to three NL pennants 
and the 1933 World Series title. In the 1933 Series, he won two complete 
game victories, including an 11-inning 2–1 triumph in Game Four (the run 
was unearned). In six career Series starts, he was 4–2 with 32 strikeouts 
and a low 1.79 earned run average. Hubbell finished his career with a 253–154 
record, 1678 strikeouts, 724 walks, 36 shutouts and a 2.97 ERA, in 3590 
innings pitched. He won 24 consecutive games between 1936 (16) & 1937 (8),[4] 
the longest such streak ever recorded in major league history. He was twice 
named National League MVP (1933, 1936) (1st unanimous MVP pick in 1936). 
He led the league in wins 3 times in 1933 (23), 1936 (26), and 1937 (22). 
He led the league in ERA three times in 1933 (1.66), 1934 (2.30), and 1936 
(2.31). He led the league in innings pitched in 1933 (308). He led the 
league in strikeouts in 1937 (159). He led the league in strikeouts per 
9 innings pitched in 1938 (5.23). He led the league in shutouts in 1933 
(10). He led the league in saves in 1934 (eight, retroactively credited). 
He compiled a streak of 46 1⁄3 scoreless innings and four shutouts in 1933. 
He pitched a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates (11–0, May 8, 1929). 
He pitched an 18-inning shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals (1–0, July 
2, 1933).[4] Joe DiMaggio called Hubbell the toughest pitcher he'd ever 
faced.[2] In its 1936 World Series cover story about Lou Gehrig and Carl 
Hubbell, Time magazine depicted the Fall Classic that year between crosstown 
rivals Giants and Yankees as "a personal struggle between Hubbell and Gehrig", 
calling Hubbell "...currently baseball's No. 1 Pitcher and among the half 
dozen ablest in the game's annals." Time said that while he was growing 
up on his family's Missouri farm, he "practiced for hours...throwing stones 
at a barn door until he could unfailingly hit knotholes no bigger than 
a dime".[5] Hubbell was released at the end of the 1943 season. He had 
posted a 4-4 record that year, marking the only time he didn't record double-digit 
wins.[3] However, Giants owner Horace Stoneham immediately appointed him 
as director of player development, a post he held for 35 years. During 
that time, he lived in Haworth, New Jersey; he continued to live there 
after the Giants left New York.[6] The last ten years of his life were 
spent as a Giants scout. Hubbell was married to Lucille "Sue" Harrington 
(1905–1967) from 1930 until her death. They had two children: Carl Jr. 
(b. 1936) and James. Carl Jr. had a brief career in the lower minor leagues. 
In the 1934 All Star Game played at the Polo Grounds, Hubbell set a record 
by striking out five future Hall of Famers in succession: Babe Ruth, Lou 
Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin.[4] In 1984, the 50th anniversary 
of this legendary performance, National League pitchers Fernando Valenzuela 
and Dwight Gooden combined to fan six batters in a row for a new All-Star 
Game record (future Hall of Famers Dave Winfield, Reggie Jackson, and George 
Brett by Valenzuela; Lance Parrish, Chet Lemon, and Alvin Davis by Gooden). 
Hubbell himself was on hand for the 1984 All-Star Game at San Francisco's 
Candlestick Park to throw out the first pitch, which was a screwball. Hubbell 
died due to injuries suffered in an auto accident in Scottsdale, Arizona 
in 1988, thirty years to the day after teammate and Hall of Famer Mel Ott 
died of the same cause. He is interred at Meeker-Newhope Cemetery in Meeker, 
Oklahoma. Hubbell was a 9-time All-Star, having been honored each year 
from 1933 to 1938 and then again from 1940 to 1942. In 1999, he ranked 
number 45 on the The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, 
and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Hubbell 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947.[4] He was the first 
NL player to have his number (11) retired. His number is posted on the 
facing of the upper deck in the left field corner at AT&T Park. Hubbell 
appeared as himself in the movie Big Leaguer, and was one of the players 
mentioned in the poem "Line-Up for Yesterday" by Ogden Nash: U would be 
'Ubbell If Carl were a Cockney; We say Hubbell and baseball Like football
