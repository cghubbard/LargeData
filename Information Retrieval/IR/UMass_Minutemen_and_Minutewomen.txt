The UMass Minutemen are the athletic teams that represent the University 
of Massachusetts Amherst;[2] strictly speaking, the Minutemen nickname 
applies to men's teams and athletes only — women's teams and athletes are 
known as Minutewomen. The Minutemen and Minutewomen compete in NCAA Division 
I sports competition primarily as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference.[3] 
UMass is one of only 15 universities in the nation that plays Division 
I FBS football and Division I men's ice hockey (six of which are in the 
Big Ten Conference).[4] The nickname is also applied to club teams that 
do not participate within the NCAA structure. When athletic teams were 
first fielded by Massachusetts Agricultural College, the popular nickname 
was "Statesmen", in honor of the roles of Massachusetts statesmen in the 
founding of the country. Although "Aggies" was also used, by 1948 the school, 
which had changed their name to the University of Massachusetts the year 
before, decided a new nickname was in order. From the leading choices, 
Redmen was chosen, both for the roles Native Americans served in the history 
of the Commonwealth and for their "strength and fierceness in defending 
his lands."[5] However, by 1972, Native Americans in the region were calling 
the choice of nickname into question for the derogatory connotations of 
the name.[6] The administration began requesting that the name was used 
as little as possible, and by the end of the 1972 spring semester, the 
Board of Trustees chose to change the nickname to Minutemen, one of the 
choices that was a finalist in 1948. The name was chosen for its ties to 
the history of the Commonwealth, as the Minutemen were instrumental in 
the early stages of the American Revolution. Though there was some controversy 
in the 1990s over the mascot being perceived as "a symbol of oppression,"[7] 
the mascot has remained the Minutemen and Minutewomen. The school's colors 
are maroon and white. Their mascot is Sam the Minuteman, a colonial based 
on the Concord Minute Man's imagery. A member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, 
the University of Massachusetts sponsors teams in ten men's and eleven 
women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[8] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's 
Intercollegiate Sports Initiated in 1877, the baseball team was Yankee 
Conference champions in 1952, 1957, 1966, 1967, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1978, 
1979, and 1980, and Atlantic 10 champions in 1980, 1994, 1995, and 1996. 
They reached the NCAA tournament in 1954, 1955, 1956, 1966, 1967, 1969, 
1971, 1973, 1978, 1995, and 1996, and the College World Series in 1954 
and 1969. The team, since the termination of many men's teams (including 
football and baseball) in 1996 at Boston University, has become the fourth 
team (in addition to the traditional Boston College, Harvard, and Northeastern) 
in the baseball version of the Beanpot tournament held at Fenway Park. 
The baseball team plays its home games at Earl Lorden Field. UMass has 
had 17 players later reach the major leagues. The best known are starting 
pitcher Mike Flanagan, relief pitcher Jeff Reardon, shortstop Gary DiSarcina, 
and relief pitcher Ron Villone. UMass (Massachusetts Agricultural College) 
played its first varsity basketball game in 1900. Today, the Minutemen 
are members of the Atlantic 10 basketball conference, of which it was regular 
season co-Champion in 2007. This marked the first time it won or shared 
the league title since the last of its five consecutive Atlantic 10 championships 
in 1996. During the 1990s, the men's basketball team was known as one of 
the finest in the nation, holding the number one ranking in national polls 
for extended periods. Under the leadership of then-head coach John Calipari 
and players such as 1996 National Player of the Year Marcus Camby, Harper 
Williams and Lou Roe, the Minutemen participated in the NCAA Tournament 
each year between 1992 and 1998, and reached the Final Four in 1996. However, 
a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Camby illegally accepted a total 
of $28,000 from sports agents that were attempting to lure him into the 
NBA Draft after his Sophomore season, and the school was forced to vacate 
its Final Four appearance as well as return their 1996 NCAA Final Four 
trophy. Camby eventually repaid the school the $151,000 in lost Final Four 
revenue that came as a result of the NCAA's ruling. While a Final Four 
banner still hangs from the rafters of the Mullins Center in defiance of 
the NCAA's ruling, the appearance is marked with an asterisk in official 
record books, even though it was noted that there was absolutely no institutional 
wrongdoing. First played in 1905 and held annually since 1995 (until Boston 
College ended the annual game in 2012), UMass' basketball rivalry with 
Boston College is called the "Commonwealth Classic." Notable UMass basketball 
alumni include Camby, Basketball Hall of Famer Julius Erving, Louisville 
head coach Rick Pitino, and Boston College head coach Al Skinner. The current 
coach of the Minutemen is Derek Kellogg. Camby, Roe, Williams, Stephane 
Lasme and Gary Forbes were each named Atlantic 10 player of the year. Derek 
Kellogg was also a point guard for the Umass Minutemen from 1992 to 1995. 
He played under John Calipari and was an assistant coach for the Memphis 
Tigers before becoming a head coach at his alma mater. With the football 
team joining the Mid-American Conference the men's and women's basketball 
teams will play four non conference games (two home and two away) each 
year against MAC teams as long as the football team is a member of the 
MAC.[9] The women's basketball program began in 1968. They have reached 
the Women's NIT in 1995 and the NCAA Tournament in 1996 and 1998. Former 
players Tamara and Alisha Tatham competed for Team Canada in the 2012 Summer 
Olympics. Another notable player is Rashida Timbilla, who is now one of 
the all-time greatest players in program history. She played for Umass 
Amherst from 2012 to 2016. Timbilla along with Jennifer Butler were the 
only two players to ever reach 1,000 rebounds in Umass women's basketball 
history. Timbilla also was ranked among the program's top-10 lists in 14 
different categories. Victoria Stewart was the first player in Umass Women's 
Basketball history to play in her hometown. She has a story behind her 
basketball career. She started at Amherst-Pelham High School from 2008–12. 
She participated in 2011 state game where they finished 2nd. By the end 
of her senior year of high school she named first team all-conference. 
Coming out of high school Stewart had a decision to make, by choosing whether 
or not she wanted to continue playing basketball or pursue a nursing degree 
at a nursing school nearby. She decided to continue to play basketball 
and walked on the Umass Women's Basketball Team in 2012. In December 2012 
Victoria was honored a full ride basketball scholarship for all her hard 
work and dedication. Shortly after, Victoria was nominated a captain of 
the Umass Women's Basketball team. This shows that hard work really does 
pay off. In November 2015, Victoria faced a devastating incident where 
she tore ACL where she had to sit out the rest of her senior season. It 
was hard on Victoria but she decided that she did not want to end her senior 
season like that so she was offered an opportunity to red shirt that she 
decided to take and pursue with her basketball career The field hockey 
program's first season was in 1975, when it quickly rose in national prominence. 
From 1977 to 1980, the field hockey team qualified for the AIAW national 
tournament, which was a precursor to the NCAA. The team has qualified for 
the NCAA tournament 26 times, reaching the Final Four four times (1983, 
1987, 1992) and the Finals in 1981. They have been Atlantic 10 champions 
16 times. Minutewomen who have competed for Team USA in the Olympics include 
Judy Strong in 1980 and 1984, Patty Shea in 1988 and 1996, Megan Donnelly 
in 1998, and Pam Bustin in 1996. Pam Hixon was the Head Coach of Team USA 
in 1996. Hilary Rose competed on the British team in the 1996 and 2000 
Olympic Games. Former UMass assistant coach Shannon Taylor competed for 
Team USA at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and was a member of the USA National 
Team in 2013. The football team began a move to the Football Bowl Subdivision 
and the Mid-American Conference in April 2011 and became a full member 
in 2013. In March 2014, the MAC and UMass announced an agreement for the 
Minutemen to leave the conference after the 2015 season due to UMass declining 
an offer to become a full member of the conference. In the agreement between 
the MAC and the university, there was a contractual clause that had UMass 
playing in the MAC as a football-only member for two more seasons if UMass 
declined a full membership offer. UMass announced that it would look for 
a "more suitable conference" for the team.[10] UMass became an independent 
member of FBS football beginning with the 2016 season. The UMass football 
team competed at the NCAA Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) level until 2012, 
and won one national title in that subdivision in 1998. The Minutemen were 
national finalists in 1978 and 2006. UMass has competed in four football 
conferences over its history, the Yankee Conference, the Atlantic 10, and 
the Colonial Athletic Association, which are basically three incarnations 
of the same conference, and now the FBS Mid-American Conference. UMass 
has captured a total of 22 conference championships, the most recent one 
being a share of the CAA title in 2007. The 2006 season was the final season 
under which the football team competed in the Atlantic 10, as the A-10 
Football Conference disbanded after the season with all current teams moving 
to the CAA. They defeated Montana, 19–17, to advance to the championship 
game (first since 1998). UMass fell to Appalachian State in the national 
championship game by a score of 28–17 and finished the season with a record 
of 13–2. Historically, the program has competed in three major bowl games, 
compiling a record of 1–2. In 1964, UMass played in the Tangerine Bowl 
in Orlando, Florida, losing to East Carolina, 14–13. They then played in 
the 1972 Boardwalk Bowl in Atlantic City, New Jersey and defeated UC Davis, 
35–14, in a game played inside the Atlantic City Convention Center. Also, 
the 1979 Division I-AA title game was then known as the Pioneer Bowl and 
was played in Wichita Falls, Texas. The Minutemen fell to Florida A&M in 
that game by a score of 35–28. UMass football has sent several players 
to the NFL. Some of their most successful players there include quarterback 
Greg Landry, running back Marcel Shipp, and tight end Milt Morin. Class 
of 2010 members that went on to the NFL include offensive lineman Vladimir 
Ducasse and wide receiver Victor Cruz. Cruz and safety James Ihedigbo, 
also a UMass product, both started Super Bowl XLVI. In the year of 2016, 
a former Umass minutemen Tajae Sharpe was Invited to the NFL Combines. 
On November 30, 2010, the Boston Herald reported that the Mid-American 
Conference was exploring the possibility of adding the Minutemen for football.[11] 
This would upgrade UMass from the FCS to the FBS. This report was later 
confirmed by an article in The Plain Dealer (Cleveland, Ohio), going on 
to report UMass will become a member of the MAC in 2012, and bowl-eligible 
beginning in 2013.[12] In April 2011, UMass confirmed that it was moving 
to the FBS and play in the MAC beginning with the 2012 season. The team 
also announced it would play its home schedule at Gillette Stadium during 
renovations at McGuirk Stadium, and be bowl-eligible in 2013. The 2011 
team remained in the CAA Conference of the FCS. The school cited the changing 
landscape of the FCS, especially in the Colonial Athletic Association, 
with Hofstra and Northeastern dropping their football programs in 2009, 
Rhode Island considering a move to the lower-profile Northeast Conference, 
Georgia State and Old Dominion joining the CAA, and Villanova considering 
a move to the Football Bowl Subdivision's Big East Conference.[13] The 
football team became a football-only member in the MAC in 2013, and an 
independent football member of FBS beginning with the 2016 season. UMass 
ice hockey has a long history dating back to 1908. The team competed in 
the Eastern College Athletic Conference at the Division II level through 
1979, when the program was ceased due to the absence of an on-campus facility 
that could support ice hockey. Ice hockey returned in 1993 with the opening 
of the Mullins Center, and the team began competition in 1994 at the Division 
I level in the Hockey East Conference. The year 1993 is considered the 
beginning of the "modern era" of UMass Hockey. The program has shown steady 
improvement since it resumed competition, with breakthrough years occurring 
in 2003 and 2004, when the team reached the Hockey East Tournament semifinals 
and finals, respectively. UMass Men's Ice Hockey appeared in their first 
NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament (16 Teams) in the 2006–07 season and won 
their first NCAA Tournament game against Clarkson (1-0 OT) before losing 
to Maine (3-1) in the Regional Final. The UMass hockey team is nicknamed 
"The Mass Attack." They are currently coached by Greg Carvel. UMass alumni 
who have played/are playing professional hockey include Jonathan Quick, 
Thomas Pock, Greg Mauldin, Justin Braun, and Casey Wellman, among others. 
Quick also won a silver medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics as a member of 
Team USA and the Stanley Cup and the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason 
MVP with the Los Angeles Kings during the 2012 NHL playoffs. He also was 
starting goalie of the Stanley Cup Champion Kings in 2014. Conor Sheary 
played for the 2015/16 Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins. The men's 
lacrosse team reached the NCAA Championship Game in 2006, where they lost 
to the #1 ranked and undefeated Virginia Cavaliers. UMass, unseeded in 
the tournament, had to defeat three seeded teams (Cornell, Hofstra, Maryland) 
to make it to the championship game in Philadelphia. It was the first time 
any team had ever defeated the #4, #3, ad #2 seeded teams on its way to 
facing #1 Virginia in the championship. On February 13, 2008, members of 
the men's lacrosse team were involved in an off campus brawl which led 
to the suspension of eight players and the arrests of three. The players 
in question beat three college-aged males with lacrosse sticks and bottles 
at a North Pleasant Street residence.[14] The women's lacrosse team's first 
season was in 1976 where the program quickly rose to prominence. They reached 
the USWLA Semifinals in 1978, and were USWLA runner up in 1979. The Minutewomen 
reached the AIAW seminfinals both in 1980 and 1981. They were NCAA Champions 
in 1982, and have been selected for the NCAA tournament in 1983 (semifinals), 
1984 (semifinals), 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. They have 
been Atlantic 10 Champions in 2000, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 
2015, and 2016. UMass began its men's soccer program in 1930. They have 
reached the NCAA tournament 3 times, in 2001, in 2008, and in 2007 where 
UMass Men's soccer led by Captains Junior Goalkeeper Zack Simmons, Senior 
Defender Kenny Cook, and Junior Midfielder Mike Desantis reached NCAA Men's 
College Cup. They were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes, 1-0. On their 
road to the Final Four, they first won the Atlantic 10 Tournament in Dayton, 
Ohio, and then went on to beat Boston University, #1 ranked Boston College, 
Central Connecticut State, and Illinois at Chicago. They finished the season 
17-8-1, setting program records for wins and furthest advancement into 
the NCAA Tournament. They have been Atlantic 10 champions twice, in 2001 
and 2007. The women's soccer program began in 1978. The Minutewomen have 
won 4 Atlantic 10 championships (1993, 1994, 1995 and 1997). They have 
been selected to the NCAA Tournament 15 times, reaching the Women's College 
Cup 6 times (1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 (finalist), and 1993). Alumnus 
Briana Scurry received gold medals as a member of the 1996 and 2004 Team 
USA Women's Soccer Teams. The softball team has solidified itself as the 
top sports program at UMass over the last 30-plus years. The program was 
started in 1974 and in just five seasons would become a national power. 
From 1978 to 1980 the Minutewomen softball team reached the EAIAW Tournament 
each year, winning it twice. In three seasons (1974, 1978 and 1980) they 
played in the AIAW Women's College World Series.[15] From 1980 through 
the 2013 season, the team was led by legendary head coach, Elaine Sortino. 
Since its conversion from the AIAW to the NCAA, UMass has played in 21 
NCAA Tournaments, and has made three trips to the College World Series 
(1992, 1997, and 1998). They have had players named as All-Americans on 
32 different occasions. The team has also dominated the Atlantic 10, winning 
23 conference championships. Of the notable softball alumni one of the 
school's most famous is pitcher Danielle Henderson who pitched in the 2000 
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia and led the United States to a gold 
medal. Henderson also won the 1999 Honda Sports Award, given annually to 
the top Collegiate Softball player in the country. Henderson returned to 
her alma mater when she was named associate head coach in 2013. In her 
tenure as coach of the UMass Softball team Sortino won over 1,000 games. 
In her career, UMass posted 21 30-win seasons, seven 40-win campaign and 
one 50-win season. Since 2000 the Softball team has played its home games 
at the state of the art 1,000 seat UMass Softball Complex. The men's swimming 
and diving teams first season was in 1935. They have been Atlantic 10 Conference 
champions 16 times. The women's team began their program in 1976. They 
were the Atlantic 10 Champions in 2001. Diver Angelique Rodríguez competed 
on the Puerto Rican Olympic teams in the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. 
Although UMass did not have a women's swim team at the time, Dorothy Donnelly 
practiced with the men's team in the late 1930s and early 1940s. She competed 
on the US swimming team in the 1940 Summer Olympics. The women's rowing 
program has been highly successful. The team has been 15 time A-10 champions, 
and some team members have been selected to the U.S. National Team, including 
Sara Jones who competed in the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. The team 
won 4th place in the 1998 NCAA Championships. UMass alumnus Julia Richter 
won the silver medal at the 2012 London Summer Olympics for Team Germany 
as a member of that country's women's four. Head coach Jim Dietz coached 
the 1988, 1992 and 2000 Olympic teams and was a member of the 1972, 1976, 
and 1980 Olympic teams. The women's tennis team were A-10 champions in 
2001, and New England Champions in 1996. Before being eliminated after 
the 2002 academic year,[16] UMass had highly successful varsity programs 
in men's water polo (4th place national finish in 1995, with 6 appearances 
in NCAA tournaments), women's water polo, men's and women's gymnastics, 
men's tennis and women's volleyball. Before being eliminated as a varsity 
sports after the 2009 season,the 2008 Minutemen skiing team won the United 
States Collegiate Skiing and Snowboard Association National Championship 
(the first time in 23 years an Eastern Coast team had won). Many of the
