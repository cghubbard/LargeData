Christopher Armand Taylor Jr. (born August 29, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Prior to playing professionally, he attended the University of Virginia, 
and played college baseball for the Virginia Cavaliers. Taylor made his 
MLB debut with the Seattle Mariners on July 24, 2014. Taylor attended Great 
Neck Middle School in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where he was on the wrestling 
team, and won a city wrestling championship. When he attended Frank W. 
Cox High School, also in Virginia Beach, he stopped wrestling to focus 
on baseball. He was named the All-Tidewater region player of the year in 
2009.[1] Taylor was recruited to play college baseball by the University 
of Virginia and the College of William & Mary. He chose to attend Virginia, 
and played college baseball for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team, competing 
in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). In his freshman year, Taylor played 
sparingly as Tyler Cannon, an All-ACC shortstop, received most of the playing 
time. In the summer of 2010, he played for the Newport Gulls of the NECBL. 
In his sophomore year, Stephen Bruno was named the Cavaliers' starting 
shortstop at the beginning of the season, and Taylor began the year as 
the teams' right fielder. Taylor became the starting shortstop when Bruno 
suffered a hamstring injury, and retained the job after Bruno recovered.[2] 
In 2011, he hit a two-out, bases-loaded single to score the tying and winning 
runs in the decisive game of the Charlottesville Super Regional against 
UC Irvine and send the Cavaliers to the College World Series. The Seattle 
Mariners selected Taylor in the fifth round of the 2012 MLB Draft.[3] He 
began his professional career in Minor League Baseball at the Rookie-level, 
but was soon promoted to Class A.[4] In 2013, Taylor played for the High 
Desert Mavericks of the Class A-Advanced California League and Jackson 
Generals of the Class AA Southern League, finishing the season with a combined 
.314 batting average, 165 hits (eight-best in Minor League Baseball), eight 
home runs, 60 runs batted in (RBIs), 108 runs scored, and 38 stolen bases. 
After the season, the Mariners assigned Taylor to the Peoria Javelinas 
of the Arizona Fall League, and named him their minor league player of 
the year.[3] He hit .294 with Peoria, and had a .351 on-base percentage.[5] 
The Mariners invited Taylor to spring training in 2014.[6][7] Following 
Spring Training, he was assigned to the Tacoma Rainers of the Class AAA 
Pacific Coast League (PCL). He appeared in the Triple-A All-Star Game, 
and was named the PCL's Top Star.[8] After batting .328 with five home 
runs, 37 RBIs, and 63 runs scored in 75 games, the Mariners promoted Taylor 
to the major leagues on July 24 to replace the injured Willie Bloomquist 
who was placed on the 15-day disabled list.[9] He collected his first major-league 
hit, a single, on the same day against the Baltimore Orioles. During spring 
training in 2015, Taylor fractured his wrist when he was hit by a pitch.[10] 
After he recovered from his injury, he began the 2015 Season with AAA Tacoma. 
He would have a stint with the Mariners later in the year, but was sent 
back to Tacoma after RHP Mayckol Guaipe was called up. On May 21, 2016 
Chris was recalled from AAA Tacoma to replace the injured Ketel Marte. 
On June 19, 2016, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange 
for Zach Lee.[11] The Dodgers optioned him to the Oklahoma City Dodgers 
of the PCL.[12] He was called up to the majors on June 25, 2016.[13] On 
July 15, 2016, Taylor hit his first major league career home run, a grand 
slam, off of Silvino Bracho of the Arizona Diamondbacks. He also had a 
double, a triple, drove in six runs, and fell just short of hitting for 
the cycle. He was the third Dodgers player in history to have his first 
career homer be a grand slam (Preston Ward in 1948 and Chico Fernández 
in 1956) and the third Dodgers second baseman to have at least six RBI 
in a game (Billy Herman in 1943 and Jackie Robinson in 1949).[14] He played 
in 34 games for the Dodgers, hitting .207.[15] Taylor's father, Chris Sr., 
and grandfather, Armand, attended Virginia Tech, where they competed on
