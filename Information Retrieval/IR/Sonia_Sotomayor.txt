Sonia Maria Sotomayor (/ˈsoʊnjə ˈsoʊtəˌmaɪər/, Spanish: [ˈsonja sotomaˈʝor];[5] 
born June 25, 1954) is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the 
United States, serving since August 2009. She has the distinction of being 
its first justice of Hispanic heritage, the first Latina, its third female 
justice, and its twelfth Roman Catholic justice.[4] Sotomayor, along with 
John Roberts and Elena Kagan, is one of the youngest justices on the Supreme 
Court. Sotomayor was born in The Bronx, New York City, to Puerto Rican-born 
parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised 
by her mother. Sotomayor graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University 
in 1976 and received her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was 
an editor at the Yale Law Journal. She was an advocate for the hiring of 
Latino faculty at both schools.[citation needed] She worked as an assistant 
district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering 
private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors 
for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New 
York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board. Sotomayor 
was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. 
In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the Republican 
majority in the United States Senate, but she was eventually confirmed 
in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 
cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York 
University School of Law and Columbia Law School. In May 2009, President 
Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement 
of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in 
August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. Sotomayor has supported, while on the court, 
the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly 
perceived ideological lines. During her tenure on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor 
has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants, calls for 
reform of the criminal justice system, and making impassioned dissents 
on issues of race, gender and ethnic identity. Sonia Maria Sotomayor[6] 
was born in the New York City borough of The Bronx.[7] Her father was Juan 
Sotomayor (born c. 1921),[8] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto 
Rico,[9][10][11] and her mother was Celina Báez (born 1927),[12] an orphan[13] 
from the neighborhood of Santa Rosa in Lajas, a still mostly rural area 
on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[11] The two left Puerto Rico separately, 
met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's 
Army Corps.[14][15] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not 
speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[9] Celina Baez worked 
as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[8] Sonia's younger 
brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university 
professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[16][17] Sotomayor was raised 
a Catholic[4] and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx 
and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a "Nuyorican".[14] The family lived 
in a South Bronx tenement[18] before moving in 1957 to the well-maintained, 
racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[18][19][20] 
in Soundview (which has over time been thought as part of both the East 
Bronx and South Bronx).[21][22][23] Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium 
led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[24] The extended 
family got together frequently[18] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during 
summers.[25] Sonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was 
emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later 
said gave her a source of "protection and purpose".[13] Sonia was diagnosed 
with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[9] and began taking daily insulin injections.[26] 
Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[8][18] 
After this, she became fluent in English.[9] Sotomayor has said that she 
was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and 
then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career 
from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a 
judge by watching the Perry Mason television series.[9][24][26] She reflected 
in 1998: "I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, 
and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest."[24] Celina Sotomayor 
put great stress on the value of education; she bought the Encyclopædia 
Britannica for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[14] 
Despite the distance between the two, which became even worse after her 
father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[13] 
Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her "life inspiration".[27] 
For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[28] 
where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[23][29] 
Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital.[30] 
Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman 
High School in the Bronx.[4][31] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen 
victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black 
Spades gang.[18] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City 
in the Northeast Bronx.[18] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the 
forensics team and was elected to the student government.[4][31] She graduated 
as valedictorian in 1972.[14] Sotomayor entered Princeton University on 
a full scholarship,[32] by her own later description gaining admission 
in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative 
action made up for her standardized test scores not being fully comparable 
to those of other applicants.[33][34] She would later say that there are 
cultural biases built into such testing[33] and praise affirmative action 
for fulfilling "its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students 
from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of 
a race many were unaware was even being run."[35] She would describe her 
time at Princeton as a life-changing experience.[36] Initially, she felt 
like "a visitor landing in an alien country"[37] as her exposure had been 
limited to the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[38] Princeton had few women students 
and fewer Latinos (about 20).[14][39] She was too intimidated to ask questions 
during her freshman year;[37] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, 
and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[40] She put in long hours in 
the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, 
and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[14][39][40] She became a 
moderate student activist[31][41] and co-chair of the Acción Puertorriqueña 
organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more 
opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[14][42][43] She worked in the 
admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of 
her best prospects.[44] As an activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring 
and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino 
professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[45][46] A meeting with 
university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[43] 
leading to Sotomayor's saying in a New York Times story at the time that 
"Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making 
substantive efforts to change."[47] So, Acción Puertorriqueña filed a formal 
letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education 
and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission 
practices.[42][45][47] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the Daily Princetonian 
with the same theme.[14] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[41][45] 
and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[44] Sotomayor 
also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on 
Puerto Rican history and politics.[45] Sotomayor joined the governance 
board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's 
student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[44][48] 
She also ran an after-school program for local children[41] and volunteered 
as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[14][38][49] 
A history major, Sotomayor received almost all A's in her final two years 
of college.[48] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis at Princeton on Luis 
Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, 
and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[14] 
The 178-page work, "La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the 
Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto 
Rico, 1930–1975",[50] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies 
Thesis Prize.[51] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award 
for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular 
activities.[14][31][48] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[14][52] 
and awarded an A.B. from Princeton, graduating summa cum laude.[53] She 
was influenced by the then-fashionable critical race theory, which would 
be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[54] On August 14, 1976, 
just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, 
whom she had dated since high school,[10][14] in a small chapel at St. 
Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[4] She used the married name Sonia Sotomayor 
de Noonan.[55][56][57] He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[14] Sotomayor 
entered Yale Law School in the fall of 1976, once more on a scholarship.[24] 
While she believes she again benefited from affirmative action to compensate 
for somewhat lower standardized test scores,[33][34] a former dean of admissions 
at Yale has said that given her record at Princeton, it probably had little 
effect.[44] At Yale she fit in well[19][56] although she found there were 
again few Latino students.[43] She was known as a hard worker but she was 
not considered among the star students in her class.[19][56] Yale General 
Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes acted as an early mentor to her 
to successfully transition and work within "the system".[58] She became 
an editor of the Yale Law Journal[10] and was also managing editor of the 
student-run Yale Studies in World Public Order publication (later known 
as the Yale Journal of International Law).[59] Sotomayor published a law 
review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's 
mineral and ocean rights.[14][31] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers 
Union mock trial competition.[59] She was co-chair of a group for Latin, 
Asian, and Native American students, and her advocacy to hire more Hispanic 
faculty was renewed.[39][43] Following her second year, she gained a job 
as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, 
Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[60] By her own later evaluation, her performance 
there was lacking.[61] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, 
an experience that she later described as a "kick in the teeth" and one 
that would bother her for years.[60][61] In her third year, she filed a 
formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of 
Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner 
that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[31][43] Sotomayor refused 
to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student 
tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[43][45] Her action triggered a campus-wide 
debate,[58] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made 
the Washington Post.[55] In 1979, Sotomayor was awarded a J.D. from Yale 
Law School.[10] She was admitted to the New York Bar the following year.[57][62] 
On the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school 
as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney 
Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[10][58] She said at the time that she 
did so with conflicted emotions: "There was a tremendous amount of pressure 
from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could 
not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved 
that problem."[63] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems 
in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other 
rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before 
judges in court.[64] Working in the trial division,[65] she handled heavy 
caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution 
to robberies, assaults, and murders.[10][14][66] She also worked on cases 
involving police brutality.[32] She was not afraid to venture into tough 
neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[66][67] 
In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying 
a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[66] In 1983 in her highest 
profile case she helped convict the "Tarzan Murderer" (who acrobatically 
entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason).[64][68] 
She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment 
and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: "No 
matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless 
of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals 
to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous."[63] Hispanic-on-Hispanic 
crime was of particular concern to her: "The saddest crimes for me were 
the ones that my own people committed against each other."[9] In general, 
she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, 
displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for 
the time.[31] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being 
driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[24][64][69] One of her job 
evaluations labelled her a "potential superstar".[67] Morgenthau later 
described her as "smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,"[70] 
and as a "fearless and effective prosecutor."[32] She stayed a typical 
length of time in the post[63] and had a common reaction to the job: "After 
a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life."[71] 
Sotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[67] they did not have children.[22] 
She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing 
factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[69][72] From 1983 to 
1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, 
located in her Brooklyn apartment.[73] She performed legal consulting work, 
often for friends or family members.[73] In 1984, she entered private practice, 
joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in 
Manhattan as an associate.[9][74] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[74] 
she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, 
and arbitration.[9][32][75][76] She later said, "I wanted to complete myself 
as an attorney."[24] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the 
firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[74] She 
was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger 
law firm.[74] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing 
business in the United States;[31] much of her time was spent tracking 
down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[14][74] In some cases, Sotomayor 
went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate 
merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while 
riding on a motorcycle.[14][74] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's 
efforts were run "much like a drug operation", and the successful rounding 
up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by "Fendi 
Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[77] 
At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract 
disputes.[74] In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled 
women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law 
work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had 
expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[72] In 1988 she 
became a partner at the firm;[40][59] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[78] 
She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[10] In addition to her law firm 
work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[79] She was not connected 
to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, 
and indeed she was registered as an independent.[79] Instead, District 
Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[70][79] 
In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board 
of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[80] 
As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[80] 
the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance 
coverage for housing and AIDS hospices.[9] Despite being the youngest member 
of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the 
details of the operation and was effective.[70][79] She was vocal in supporting 
the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home 
owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although 
in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[79][80] Sotomayor 
was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of 
the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[9][81] 
There she took a vigorous role[79] in the board's implementation of a voluntary 
scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange 
for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial 
disclosure.[82] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed 
to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow 
those regulations than some of the other board members.[70][79] She joined 
in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of 
Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[79] Based upon another recommendation 
from Cabranes,[70] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of 
the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[83] 
There she was a top policy maker[9] who worked actively with the organization's 
lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, 
the death penalty, and voting rights.[83] The group achieved its most visible 
triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds 
that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority 
voters.[83] During 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the 
Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which 
focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[84][85][86] Sotomayor 
had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 
1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan.[9] Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with 
his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get 
to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even 
though a Republican was in the White House.[36][87][88][89] Moynihan also 
wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge 
appointed for New York.[22] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, 
they said "Have we got a judge for you!"[9] Moynihan identified with her 
socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become 
the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[14][79] D'Amato became an enthusiastic 
backer of Sotomayor,[90] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[9][22] 
Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: 
"I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted 
to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns 
and how I was raised, it's not modest at all."[9] Sotomayor was thus nominated 
on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. 
Walker, Jr.[7] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic 
majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities 
winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval 
from the committee.[9][90][91] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination 
and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block 
Democrats had put on another nominee.[90][92] D'Amato objected strongly;[92] 
some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by 
unanimous consent[65][90] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 
1992, and received her commission the next day.[7] Sotomayor became the 
youngest judge in the Southern District[93] and the first Hispanic federal 
judge in New York State.[94] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to 
serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[95] She was one of seven women 
among the district's 58 judges.[9] She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, 
back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[9] Sotomayor generally 
kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[24] She showed a willingness 
to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her 
first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest 
groups.[22] Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist 
during this period.[9][22] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for 
tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[96] A Syracuse 
University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out 
longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime 
was involved.[97] Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an 
influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, "just the facts" approach 
to judicial decision-making.[58] As a trial judge, she garnered a reputation 
for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight 
schedule.[22] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, 
demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, "She does not 
have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it."[22] 
On March 30, 1995, in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations 
Committee, Inc.,[98] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against 
Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new 
collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling 
ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season 
was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision 
and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[24][99][100] The decision 
raised her profile,[14] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[24] and 
had a lasting effect on the game.[101] In the preparatory phase of the 
case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, "I hope none of 
you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details 
of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the 
South Bronx without knowing about baseball."[102] In Dow Jones v. Department 
of Justice (1995),[103] Sotomayor sided with the Wall Street Journal in 
its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by 
former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the 
public had "a substantial interest"[104] in viewing the note and enjoined 
the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release. In New York Times 
Co. v. Tasini (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company 
for copyright infringement for the New York Times' inclusion in an electronic 
archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. 
Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' 
work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld 
the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took 
Sotomayor's position.[105] In Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol 
Publishing Group (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia 
from the television program Seinfeld infringed on the copyright of the 
show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling. On June 
25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by 
J. Daniel Mahoney.[7] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth 
sailing,[24][106] with the American Bar Association Standing Committee 
on the Federal Judiciary giving her a "well qualified" professional assessment.[107] 
However, as The New York Times described, "[it became] embroiled in the 
sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate."[108] Some in the Republican 
majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme 
Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would 
put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination 
(despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton 
administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic). Therefore, 
the Republican majority decided to slow her confirmation.[19][106][108] 
Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal 
who was on a "rocket ship" to the highest court.[106] During her September 
1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong 
questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay 
rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[91] 
After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with 
only two dissensions.[91][106] However, in June 1998, the influential Wall 
Street Journal editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended 
to "get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court 
as soon as an opening occurs"; the editorial criticized two of her district 
court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[109] The Republican 
block continued.[24][106] Ranking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy 
objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor 
nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence 
about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[106][110] The prior 
month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow 
Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton 
and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable 
by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration 
of the Sotomayor confirmation.[111] During 1998, several Hispanic organizations 
organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures 
from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato 
to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[112] 
D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned 
about being up for re-election that year,[112] helped move Republican leadership.[14] 
Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent 
Lott scheduled the vote.[108] With complete Democratic support, and support 
from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[108] 
Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[113] She received 
her commission on October 7.[7] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor 
somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans 
had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: "That series 
of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some 
people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping 
is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today."[24] 
Over her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more 
than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions where she was in the majority.[14] 
The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming 
two[14]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[19] 
and a typical percentage of reversals.[114] Sotomayor's circuit court rulings 
led to her being considered a political centrist by the ABA Journal[76][115] 
and other sources and organizations.[76][93][115][116][117][118] Several 
lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone 
with liberal inclinations.[119][120][121] In any case, the Second Circuit's 
caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather 
than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[19] Sotomayor tended to 
write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the 
law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[19][122] 
A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings 
defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent 
and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[123] 
Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases 
under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended 
to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[124] Some legal experts have said that 
Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case 
came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[125] 
Across some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings 
were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[126] 
Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number 
of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, 
increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and 
was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[127] 
Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions 
that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower 
than that of other circuit judges.[128] Sotomayor was a member of the Second 
Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[105] 
In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial 
Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[17] titled "A Latina Judge's Voice"; 
it was published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal the following spring.[129][130] 
In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing 
and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal 
bench.[131] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench 
at that time was "shocking".[43] She then discussed at length how her own 
experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[131] In 
any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her 
rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her 
panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[43] An 
expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim 
of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[132] 
Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt 
with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's 
opinions.[133] In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation 
for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes 
to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[14][134] 
She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running 
a "hot bench", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[134][135] 
Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning 
was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's 
concerns.[135] The 2009 Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, which collected 
anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained 
a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[14] Comments also diverged among 
lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, "She's brilliant 
and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, 
temperamental."[134] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, "She used 
her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer 
to a question she did not understand."[134] In contrast, Second Circuit 
Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been 
"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction 
that she is somehow confrontational."[134] Second Circuit Judge and former 
teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning 
patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and 
added, "Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [The 
criticism] was sexist, plain and simple."[134] Sotomayor's law clerks regarded 
her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them 
like family.[53] In 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, 
to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of 
retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[136] In the 2002 decision 
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush,[137] Sotomayor upheld the 
Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states 
that "the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental 
organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of 
family planning in other nations."[138] Sotomayor held that the policy 
did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as "the government 
is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, 
and can do so with public funds."[137] In Pappas v. Giuliani (2002),[139] 
Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police 
Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist 
materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected 
speech by the employee "away from the office, on [his] own time", even 
if that speech was "offensive, hateful, and insulting", and that therefore 
the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than 
being dismissed on summary judgment.[140] In 2005, Sotomayor wrote the 
opinion for United States v. Quattrone.[141] Frank Quattrone had been on 
trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. 
Some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors 
deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order to 
forbid the publication of the juror's names. In United States v. Quattrone, 
Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down 
this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be 
free to publish the names of the jurors. The first trial ended in a deadlocked 
jury and a mistrial, and the district court ordered the media not to publish 
the names of jurors, even though those names had been disclosed in open 
court. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness 
of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior 
restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press "to report 
freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom".[141] In 2008, Sotomayor 
was on a three-judge panel in Doninger v. Niehoff[142] that unanimously 
affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, 
the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate 
the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running 
for student government after she called the superintendent and other school 
officials "douchebags" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged 
students to call an administrator and "piss her off more".[142] Judge Livingston 
held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that 
the student's speech "foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption 
within the school environment",[143] which is the precedent in the Second 
Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[142] Although 
Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who 
disagree with it.[144] Sotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit 
panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo (2009).[145] 
Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in 
New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right 
to bear arms. The Second Circuit's per curiam opinion noted that the Supreme 
Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against 
state governments. On the contrary, in Presser v. Illinois, a Supreme Court 
case from 1886, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment "is a 
limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, 
and not upon that of the state".[145] With respect to the Presser v. Illinois 
precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has "the prerogative 
of overruling its own decisions,"[146] and the recent Supreme Court case 
of District of Columbia v. Heller (which struck down the district's gun 
ban as unconstitutional) did "not invalidate this longstanding principle".[145] 
The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge 
to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[147] On June 2, 2009, 
a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges 
Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with Maloney v. 
Cuomo, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's 
gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until 
altered by the Supreme Court itself.[146] In N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. 
Connecticut (2004),[148] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues’ decision 
to uphold a series of strip searches of "troubled adolescent girls" in 
juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip 
searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due 
to "the severely intrusive nature of strip searches",[148] they should 
not be allowed "in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents 
who have never been charged with a crime".[148] She argued that an "individualized 
suspicion" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than 
the majority's rule.[148] In Leventhal v. Knapek (2001),[149] Sotomayor 
rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation 
employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, "Even 
though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of 
his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate 
his Fourth Amendment rights"[149] because here "there were reasonable grounds 
to believe" that the search would reveal evidence of "work-related misconduct".[149] 
In 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in Swedenburg 
v. Kelly that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping 
directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state 
wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was 
appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court 
later on as Swedenburg v. Kelly and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that 
found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[150] Sotomayor was 
involved in the high-profile case Ricci v. DeStefano that initially upheld 
the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters 
and start over with a new test, because the City believed the test had 
a "disparate impact"[151] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters 
qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under 
tests used in previous years.) The City was concerned that minority firefighters 
might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The City chose 
not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld 
the City's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic 
firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has 
dyslexia and had put much extra effort into studying, sued the City of 
New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel 
that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not 
written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[152] Sotomayor's 
former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected 
to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[153] Sotomayor 
voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling 
was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the 
Supreme Court in 2009.[153] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that 
found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination 
when they were denied promotion.[154] In Clarett v. National Football League 
(2004),[155] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility 
rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation 
before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, 
which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL 
and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim 
would upset the established "federal labor law favoring and governing the 
collective bargaining process".[156] In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & 
Smith, Inc. v. Dabit (2005),[157] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that 
the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt 
class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading 
inducement to buy or sell stocks.[114] The Supreme Court handed down an 
8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling 
Sotomayor's decision.[114] In Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp. (2001),[158] 
she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software 
did not constitute a binding contract because the system didn't give "sufficient 
notice" to the user.[159] In Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko (2000),[160] 
Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual 
to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government 
for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing 
a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that an existing Supreme Court 
doctrine, known as "Bivens"—which allows suits against individuals working 
for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be 
applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company 
operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme 
Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the Bivens 
doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf 
of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer 
dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling. In Gant v. Wallingford 
Board of Education (1999),[161] the parents of a black student alleged 
that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against 
when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class 
without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were 
treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment 
claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination 
claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was "contrary 
to the school's established policies" as well as its treatment of white 
students, which "supports the inference that race discrimination played 
a role". In Krimstock v. Kelly (2002),[162] Sotomayor wrote an opinion 
halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers 
accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding 
those vehicles for "months or even years" during criminal proceedings. 
Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily 
activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to 
hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the City's 
continued possession of their property. In Brody v. Village of Port Chester 
(2003 and 2005),[163] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for 
a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted 
to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court 
subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found 
itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel 
majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated 
by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order 
that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the 
panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[164] 
In Didden v. Village of Port Chester (2006),[165] an unrelated case brought 
about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's 
summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of 
limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned 
for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without 
the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the 
Supreme Court's recent Kelo v. City of New London ruling. The Second Circuit's 
reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[166][167] Since 
President Barack Obama's election there was speculation that Sotomayor 
could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[76][115][116][168] 
New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint 
letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior 
Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during 
his term.[169] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, 
about the possibility of her nomination.[170] On April 30, 2009, Justice 
David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received 
early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in 
June 2009.[171] On May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she 
later said, "I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, 
literally."[172] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[173] She became 
only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions 
by three different presidents.[174] The selection appeared to closely match 
Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who 
had "the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage 
mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, 
or gay, or disabled, or old."[175] Sotomayor's nomination won praise from 
Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes 
to confirm her.[176] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from 
conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used 
in similar forms in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley 
Law lecture:[131][176] "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the 
richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion 
than a white male who hasn't lived that life."[17] Sotomayor had made similar 
remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted 
as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, 
but they had attracted little attention at the time.[177][178] The remark 
now became widely known.[179] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with 
radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House 
of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a "racist" (although 
the latter later backtracked from that claim),[180] while John Cornyn and 
other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's 
approach was troubling.[181][182] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety 
of explanations in defense of the remark,[183] and White House Press Secretary 
Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been "poor".[181] 
Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee 
chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, 
"ultimately and completely" a judge follows the law regardless of personal 
background.[184] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in Ricci v. DeStefano 
received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[185] 
motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination 
aspect of the case.[179] In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme 
Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[154] A third line of Republican 
attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo and 
was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation 
of Second Amendment rights.[179] Some of the fervor with which conservatives 
and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances 
over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 
1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[186] A Gallup poll released 
a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of 
Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[187] A 
June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with 
her "wise Latina" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify 
her from serving on the Supreme Court.[188] The American Bar Association 
gave her a unanimous "well qualified" assessment, its highest mark for 
professional qualification.[107] Following the Ricci overruling, Rasmussen 
Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply 
divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor 
should be confirmed.[189][190] Sotomayor's confirmation hearings before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she 
backed away from her "wise Latina" remark, declaring it "a rhetorical flourish 
that fell flat" and stating that "I do not believe that any ethnic, racial 
or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment."[191][192] When Republican 
senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, 
she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life 
experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[193] Republican senators 
said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, 
they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with 
respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her 
speeches.[194][195] Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following 
applicable precedent.[191] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to 
Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[196] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings 
formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, 
declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before 
the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming 
that as a justice she would just apply the law.[197] On July 28, 2009, 
the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 
vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing 
her and only one Republican supporting her.[198] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor 
was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31.[199] The vote was 
largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans 
supporting her.[200] President Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day 
of her confirmation;[201] Sotomayor was sworn in on August 8, 2009, by 
Chief Justice John Roberts.[202] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve 
on the Supreme Court.[199][200][203][204] Some attention has been given 
to Justice Benjamin Cardozo – a Sephardic Jew believed to be of distant 
Portuguese descent – as the first Hispanic on the court when appointed 
in 1932, but his roots were uncertain, the term "Hispanic" was not in use 
as an ethnic identifier at the time, and the Portuguese are generally excluded 
from its meaning.[204][205][206] Sotomayor is among four women to have 
historically served on the Court, together with Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, the last of whom won confirmation a year 
after Sotomayor by a comparable 63–37 vote.[207] Sotomayor's appointment 
gives the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same 
time.[4] Sotomayor became one of the three youngest of the justices sitting 
on the Court, along with John Roberts and Elena Kagan.[208] Sotomayor cast 
her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, 
in a stay of execution case.[209] She was given a warm welcome onto the 
Court[210] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[211] Sotomayor's 
inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a 
special session, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. It involved 
the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations 
in campaign finance;[212] Sotomayor dissented.[213][214] In her vigorous 
examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in 
the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of 
the Court and saying, "What you are suggesting is that the courts, who 
created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, 
and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to 
start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics."[212][215] 
Sotomayor's first major written opinion was a dissent in the Berghuis v. 
Thompkins case dealing with Miranda rights.[213][216] As her first year 
neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the intensity and 
heavy workload of the job.[216] During the oral arguments for National 
Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor showed her increasing 
familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions 
of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing 
the government's position.[217] In succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor 
had done little to change the philosophical and ideological balance of 
the Court.[213][214][216] While many cases are decided unanimously or with 
different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member 
of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly 
perceived ideological lines.[218] Specifically, her voting pattern and 
judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, 
Ginsburg and Kagan.[219] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor 
voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest 
agreement rates on the Court.[213][220] In a 2015 article titled "Ranking 
the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices", Alex Greer identified 
Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena 
Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginzberg.[221] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the 
most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, and slightly 
less liberal than her predecessors Thurgood Marshall and John Marshall 
Harlan II on the Court.[221] Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito 
(and former Justice Scalia) have comprised the identifiable conservative 
wing of the Court.[222] Although, five of the justices on the Supreme Court 
self-identify as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting 
history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. 
However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their 
approaches to the law.[4] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, 
Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse set of life experiences to 
the court.[223] There have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. 
In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's 
position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong 
guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[219] 
Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity 
with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial 
agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to 
the clause. On January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath 
to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor 
became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a 
president or vice president.[224] By the end of her fifth year on the court, 
Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate 
dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues 
of race, gender and ethnic identity.[225] Sotomayor has shown her individuality 
on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality 
of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided 
with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[226] In dealing 
with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his 
statement that "the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is 
to stop discrimination on the basis of race," by stating, "I don't borrow 
Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society 
is too complex to use that kind of analysis."[227] In the manufacturer 
liability case of Williamson v. Mazda, which the court decided unanimously, 
she wrote a separate concurring opinion.[228] Sotomayor's rapport with 
her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices 
as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering 
with a table of contents attached.[229] When compared to Kagan directly, 
one of their colleagues stated, "Neither of them is a shrinking violet". 
Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court stated that: "Both women are 
more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and 
they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench."[230] During 
her tenure on the court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being 
among the court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.[231] 
She has been identified by Laurence Tribe as the foremost voice on the 
court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication – in particular 
as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, 
concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss 
of privacy – and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that 
of past Chief Justice Earl Warren.[232] J.D.B. v. North Carolina was a 
2011 case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that age 
is relevant when determining police custody for Miranda purposes. Sotomayor 
was assigned to write the majority opinion in the case. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old 
student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected 
of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, 
where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, 
and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was 
convicted. J.D.B. was not given a Miranda warning during the interrogation, 
nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. During the trial, attempts 
to suppress the statements given by J.D.B. because he was not given a Miranda 
warning were denied on the grounds that J.D.B. was not in police custody. 
The case was appealed and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Sotomayor's 
opinion for the Court held that a child's age properly informs the Miranda 
custody analysis. Her opinion underscored the dangers of not applying age 
to the custody analysis, writing: "to hold... that a child's age is never 
relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to 
ignore the very real differences between children and adults— would be 
to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that Miranda 
guarantees to adults".[233] The opinion cited Stansbury v. California where 
the Court held that a child's age "would have affected how a reasonable 
person" in the suspect's position "would perceive his or her freedom to 
leave". Yarborough v. Alvarado was also cited, where the Court wrote that 
a child's age "generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception". 
Finally, Sotomayor's opinion pointed out that the law reflects the idea 
that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal 
disqualifications on children as a class (e.g. limitations on a child's 
ability to marry without parental consent). Sotomayor's opinion was challenged 
by Associate Justice Samuel Alito who wrote a dissenting opinion for four 
Justices. A particularly fractious United States Supreme Court case was 
2012's United States v. Alvarez, involving judicial review in which the 
Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act, a federal law that criminalized 
false statements about having a military medal. The law had been passed 
as an effort to stem instances where people falsely claimed to have won 
the medal in an attempt to protect the "valor" of those who really had. 
While a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court agreed that the law was unconstitutional 
under the First Amendment's free speech protections, it could not agree 
on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices 
Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity 
is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. 
Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled 
to some protection, the Stolen Valor Act was invalid because it could have 
achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas 
and Alito were in dissent.[234] Most visibly during the 2012 term, in National 
Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, Sotomayor was part of a 
landmark 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against 
the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather 
than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey 
Toobin wrote, "Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. 
Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed 
questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, 
sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of 
inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly 
suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness 
of the applying the same principle to health insurance as well)."[235] 
Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court 
directed at the attorneys: "Do you think that if some states decided not 
to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be 
without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?" 
For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument 
for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.[235] 
In another high-profile June 2012 decision at the end of her third term, 
Sotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in Arizona v. United States that struck 
down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law.[236] 
The Arizona case was decided as a compromise verdict with Sotomayor joining 
Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Ginsburg and Breyer in the majority, with Justice 
Kagan not participating.[237] In 2013, Sotomayor's unjoined concurrence 
in the prior year's United States v. Jones decision, in which she said 
that in the digital age, "It may be necessary to reconsider the premise 
that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information 
voluntarily disclosed to third parties," was cited by federal judge Richard 
Leon in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection 
of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[238] 
Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said 
that Sotomayor's Jones concurrence had been influential in calling out 
the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, 
as she wrote, "in which people reveal a great deal of information about 
themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks."[238] 
On July 3, 2014, six justices ordered an injunction that allowed Wheaton 
College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption 
from complying with Affordable Care Act's mandate on contraception.[239] 
It came in the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in Burwell v. 
Hobby Lobby, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, and was opposed 
by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. They 
suggested that the Hobby Lobby decision was not the Court's conclusive 
opinion on birth control. In her dissent to the injunction, Sotomayor wrote 
that, "Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take 
us at our word ... Not today." Sotomayor stated further her opinion that 
the decision compromised "hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students 
of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage."[239] Sotomayor was 
an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 
2007.[240] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal 
appellate court seminar.[240] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer 
in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[85][241] 
While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate 
Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, 
moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[241] She became a member 
of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her 
term in 2011.[49][242] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean 
Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian 
Grove.[243] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove 
after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership 
policy.[244] Sotomayor has maintained a public presence, mostly through 
making speeches, since joining the federal judiciary and throughout her 
time on the Supreme Court.[245][246] She gave over 180 speeches between 
1993 and 2009, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity 
or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[245] While on 
the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses at 
a number of universities including New York University (2012),[247] Yale 
University (2013),[248] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[246][249] 
Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview 
than her rulings on the bench.[170] The themes of her speeches have often 
focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and 
America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[170] She 
has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success 
of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying "I am the 
perfect affirmative action baby" in regard to her belief that her admission 
test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[33][34] During 
2012 while already on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor made two appearances 
as herself on the children's television program Sesame Street, explaining 
what a vocational career is in general and then demonstrating how a judge 
hears a case.[250][251] Sotomayor long lived in Greenwich Village in New 
York City and had few financial assets other than her home.[170] She enjoys 
shopping, traveling, and giving gifts and helps support her mother and 
her mother's husband in Florida.[252] Regarding her short financial disclosure 
reports prior to her Supreme Court nomination, she has said, "When you 
don't have money, it's easy. There isn't anything there to report."[53] 
As a federal judge, she is entitled to a pension equal to her full salary 
upon retirement.[252] Upon joining the Supreme Court, she took up residence 
in Washington but sorely missed the faster-paced life of New York.[60] 
After renting in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for three years, in 2012 
she purchased a condominium in the U Street Corridor.[253] She said, "I 
picked [that area] because it's mixed. I walk out and I see all kinds of 
people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love."[60] 
She takes several daily insulin injections,[254] and her diabetes is considered 
to be well controlled.[255] Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish 
or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions.[4] She 
has said, "I am a very spiritual person [though] maybe not traditionally 
religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing. The trappings 
are not important to me, but, yes, I do believe in God. And, yes, I do 
believe in the commandments."[60] She maintains ties with Puerto Rico, 
visiting once or twice a year, speaking there occasionally, and visiting 
cousins and other relatives who still live in the Mayagüez area.[11][12][15] 
She has long stressed her ethnic identity, saying in 1996, "Although I 
am an American, love my country and could achieve its opportunity of succeeding 
at anything I worked for, I also have a Latina soul and heart, with the 
magic that carries."[25] Sotomayor said of the years following her divorce, 
that "I have found it difficult to maintain a relationship while I've pursued 
my career."[69] She has talked of herself as "emotionally withdrawn" and 
lacking "genuine happiness" when living by herself; after becoming a judge, 
she said she would not date lawyers.[67] In 1997, she was engaged to New 
York construction contractor Peter White, but the relationship had ended 
by 2000.[10][67] In July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred 
A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[256] She 
received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[257] which was 
published in January 2013 and titled My Beloved World[60] (Mi mundo adorado 
in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life 
up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New 
York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[60] It received good 
reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times describing it as "a 
compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. 
... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and 
hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary 
will and dedication."[258] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[259] 
and it debuted atop the New York Times Best Seller List.[260] On December 
31, 2013, Sotomayor pressed the ceremonial button and led the final 60-second 
countdown at the Times Square New Year's Eve ball drop, being the first 
United States Supreme Court justice to perform the task.[261][262] Sotomayor 
has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[105] Princeton 
University (2001),[105] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[105] Pace University 
School of Law (2003),[263] Hofstra University (2006),[85] Northeastern 
University School of Law (2007),[264] Howard University (2010),[265] St. 
Lawrence University (2010),[266] New York University (2012),[247]Yale University 
(2013),[248] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[249] She was elected 
a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[267] She was given 
the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students 
Association.[268] In 2008, Esquire magazine included Sotomayor on its list 
of "The 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century".[269] In 2013, 
Sotomayor won the Woodrow Wilson Award at her alma mater Princeton University.[270] 
In June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, 
was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia 
Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. 
While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, 
this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[271] In 2011, 
the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex 
in Los Angeles, was named after her.[272] In 2013, a painting featuring 
her, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan was unveiled 
at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[273] 
According to the Smithsonian at the time, the painting was on loan to the 
museum for three years.[273] In May 2015 she received the Katharine Hepburn 
medal from Bryn Mawr College.[274] The Katharine Hepburn Medal recognizes 
women who change their worlds: those whose lives, work, and contributions 
embody the intelligence, drive, and independence of the four-time Oscar
