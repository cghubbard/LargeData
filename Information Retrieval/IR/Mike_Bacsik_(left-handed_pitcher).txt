Michael Joseph Bacsik (/ˈbæsᵻk/; born November 11, 1977) is a former Major 
League Baseball pitcher. Bacsik is the son of Michael James Bacsik, who 
pitched in the majors from 1975–1980. He is particularly notable for giving 
up Barry Bonds' 756th career home run on August 7, 2007, which broke the 
all-time record formerly held by Hank Aaron. Bacsik also has a long-running 
media career. A former intern at Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas radio station 
KTCK ('Sportsradio 1310 The Ticket') for the Bob and Dan (BaD) Radio Show 
prior to beginning his Major League career, Bacsik later served as the 
show producer on 'The Ticket' for midday host Norm Hitzges and performed 
other fill-in on-air host duties. He was fired in late April 2010 for offensive 
comments he made on Twitter. Bacsik currently serves as a color analyst 
for selected college baseball games on Fox Sports Southwest and Fox College 
Sports. He currently serves as co-host on the Dallas/Ft. Worth radio station 
KRLD 105.3 The Fan show "G-Bag Nation". Bacsik was drafted by the Cleveland 
Indians in the 18th round (543rd overall) in the 1996 Major League Baseball 
draft. He was in his 6th minor league season with the Indians organization 
before making his debut on August 5, 2001. He was supposed to be serving 
mop-up duty, as the Seattle Mariners had opened up a huge lead on the Indians. 
He was knocked around at first and settled in. The Indians rallied from 
12 runs down to win the game in extra innings. He had a 9.00 ERA in 3 relief 
appearances (9 innings) in 2001. On December 11, 2001, as part of a big 
trade, he was traded along with Roberto Alomar and Danny Peoples to the 
New York Mets for Matt Lawton, Alex Escobar, Jerrod Riggan, Earl Snyder, 
and Billy Traber. On July 5, 2002, he got his first big league win when 
he made his debut with the Mets. He would later go on to have a 3-2 record 
with a 4.37 ERA in the 2003 season. He spent just two seasons with the 
Mets before becoming a free agent on October 15, 2003. Two months later, 
on December 23, 2003, he would sign a contract with the Texas Rangers (incidentally, 
the team where his father was a member when he was born). He spent most 
of the 2004 season for the Oklahoma Redhawks, the Rangers Triple-A affiliate. 
He made just 3 starts in 2004 for the big league club, going 1-1 with a 
4.60 ERA. He became a free agent after the 2004 season and signed a contract 
on November 18, 2004, with the Philadelphia Phillies. However he spent 
the whole 2005 season with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, the Phillies 
Triple-A team. He opted for minor league free agency after the 2005 season. 
While in Dallas, he interned for the popular KTCK mid-day show the Bob 
and Dan radio program, and gave them many interviews both before and after 
756, at one point claiming he would "give up the home run to Bonds" to 
be immortalized in baseball history. He signed a contract with the Washington 
Nationals on February 9, 2006, with an invitation to spring training. He 
made just one start in spring training and gave up 6 runs in 0.2 innings 
before getting cut in April. Afterwards, he signed a minor league contract 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He had an impressive minor league season 
with the Diamondbacks Triple-A team, the Tucson Sidewinders, in which he 
went a perfect 11-0 with a 2.79 ERA in 28 games (10 starts). He became 
a free agent after the 2006 season and later signed a minor league contract 
with the Washington Nationals again on November 6, 2006. Bacsik did not 
make the major league team when the Nationals broke camp, and started with 
the Columbus Clippers, the Nationals Triple-A team. After the Nationals 
found themselves with four of their five starting pitchers on the disabled 
list, Bacsik and other pitchers were brought up from their farm system. 
Despite a record of 1-3 and a 4.00 ERA with Columbus (and an ERA of 5.26 
as a starter), Bacsik made his debut with the Nationals on May 19, throwing 
six shutout innings in a game the Nats eventually lost. In his following 
start, he pitched 7-2/3 innings, his longest outing of the year including 
the minors, allowing three runs, and earning his first win in the majors 
since August 4, 2004.[2] On August 7, 2007, Bacsik sealed his name to baseball 
history as he gave up career home run number 756 to Barry Bonds, who broke 
a 33-year-old record previously held by Hank Aaron. During the post-home 
run celebration, Bacsik tipped his cap to Bonds in a gesture of respect. 
Bacsik visited the Giants clubhouse to personally congratulate Bonds on 
his achievement and Bonds gave Bacsik an autographed bat that read: "To 
Mike, God Bless. Barry Bonds."[1] Coincidentally, Bacsik's father had faced 
Aaron (as a pitcher for the Texas Rangers) after Aaron had hit his 755th 
home run. On August 23, 1976, Michael James Bacsik held Aaron to a single 
and a fly out to right field. The younger Bacsik commented later, "If my 
dad had been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run, we both 
would have given up 756."[2] In 2007, he did not miss a start in the rotation 
after his last callup until he was sent to the bullpen, and went 5-8 with 
a 5.11 ERA in 20 starts and 9 relief appearances. During the 2007 postseason, 
Bacsik worked as an analyst for ESPN. On October 26, 2007, the Washington 
Nationals signed Bacsik to a non-guaranteed minor league contract with 
an invitation to spring training.[3] After spring training, on March 5, 
2008, the Nationals reassigned Bacsik to minor league camp[4] and he was 
assigned to Triple-A Columbus. He became a free agent at the end of the 
season. In 2011, Bacsik pitched for the Fort Worth Cats, an independent 
club, in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. 
During the 2012 college baseball season, Bacsik served as the baseball 
analyst for broadcasts of the TCU baseball team on "The Mountain", the 
official Mountain West conference cable TV channel. He has also carried 
that role into the 2013 season, serving as a color analyst for TCU games 
on Fox Sports Southwest and Fox College Sports. Bacsik married Sue Myers 
in February 2000. He has a daughter, Mary Grace, and a son Jacob Ryan. 
Jacob was born in late April due to complications during pregnancy. Mike 
announced on Dallas radio station KTCK the Ticket that he and his wife 
are expecting their third child. Bacsik is also well-known around Dallas 
as a Spin Class instructor with occasionally unorthodox teaching methods.[5] 
[6] Bacsik made offensive comments on his Twitter account following the 
loss of the Dallas Mavericks to the San Antonio Spurs in game 4 of the 
first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs. The comments, most notably "Congratulations 
to all the dirty Mexicans in San Antonio", quickly circulated on social 
networks online before Bacsik deleted the comments.[7][8] The following 
Monday, on April 26, 2010, Bacsik was suspended indefinitely from his KTCK 
duties by owner Cumulus Media for "comments [that] were unacceptable and 
offensive, and are inconsistent with the core values of KTCK and Cumulus."[7]
