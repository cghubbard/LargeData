Clearwater Phillies (FSL) (1985–2003) Jack Russell Memorial Stadium is 
a stadium in Clearwater, Florida. It opened as Jack Russell Stadium in 
1955. It had a capacity of 4,744 when it opened; in 2003 seating capacity 
was 6,942 people. It was the spring training home of the Philadelphia Phillies 
MLB team from 1955 through 2003. The Clearwater Bombers, a softball team 
that won 10 National Amateur Softball Association titles between 1950 and 
1973, played their home games there from 1955 through 1984. The name of 
the stadium was changed to Jack Russell Memorial Stadium following Jack 
Russell's death in November 1990. In 2004, the Philadelphia Phillies moved 
to Bright House Networks Field, 4 miles to the east. Most of the ballpark 
was demolished on July 21, 2007.[1] The dugouts, offices, and other elements 
were retained as the field continues to be used today for amateur instruction 
and tournaments. The field is now leased from the City of Clearwater by 
The Winning Inning. In 2007, the Winning Inning pays for stadium rent, 
utilities, and a full-time groundskeeper. The Winning Inning is responsible 
for maintenance of the grounds, and the City of Clearwater for plumbing 
and electrical repairs.[2] Jack Russell played in the Major Leagues from 
1926 through 1940. He was introduced to Pinellas County while training 
in the area as a member of the Cleveland American League club. Russell 
settled in Clearwater after his career where he became a Union Oil Co. 
distributor and Clearwater Chamber of Commerce president.[3] The Phillies 
moved their training to Clearwater for the 1947 season and played at Clearwater 
Athletic Field. Russell became a Clearwater city commissioner, a position 
he held from 1951 to 1955, and was a vocal advocate for a new ballpark 
for Clearwater. In 1954, the Clearwater city council approved the building 
of the park which would serve as the spring home of the Phillies. In 1955, 
Clearwater Mayor Herbert M. Brown surprised Russell when he announced that 
the stadium would be named in his honor.[4] Jack Russell was instrumental 
in the conception of the ballpark. Russell had the blueprints and plans 
drawn up himself in 1954 and then approached the Clearwater mayor and city 
commission with the plans in July 1954. The mayor and commissioners approved 
of the idea and then Russell obtained legal rights from the Florida state 
supreme court in Tallahassee to raise the money to build the stadium through 
revenue bonds. Work began in fall 1954.[5] The stadium was dedicated on 
March 10, 1955.[6] Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick, National League president 
Warren Giles, American League president Will Harridge, Clearwater mayor 
Herbert M. Brown, and other city dignitaries were in attendance.[7] The 
Phillies played their first game at the stadium on the day of the dedication. 
Robin Roberts started for the Phillies against the Detroit Tigers. The 
Phillies won 4-2 on a two-run double by Willie Jones before 4,209 attendees.[4] 
Roberts returned to the ballpark and threw out the ceremonial first-pitch 
for the Phillies' final spring training game there in 2003. The City of 
Clearwater added additional seating during the 1989–1990 off-season raising 
capacity from 5,300 to close to 7,000.[8] The Tokyo Giants trained with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in Vero Beach in 1971. The Phillies played the 
Giants at Jack Russell on March 15, 1971.[9] In its final spring training 
in 2003, parking cost $3 and game tickets cost $8, $6, and $5.[10] The 
Florida Winter Instructional Rookie League played in October and November. 
The Baltimore Orioles team played their home games at Jack Russell in 1959[11] 
and the Kansas City A's played at the ballpark in 1960.[12] The Orioles 
and Yankees shared the ballpark in 1970[13] and 1971.[14] Clearwater city 
officials approached the Philadelphia Phillies as early as 1981 about locating 
a Phillies minor league affiliate at Jack Russell Stadium in Clearwater. 
In July 1982, in a visit to Philadelphia, Clearwater city officials and 
the president of the Florida State League again asked the Philadelphia 
Phillies about affiliating with a team to be based in Clearwater. The Amateur 
Softball Association Clearwater Bombers had long used Jack Russell Stadium 
during the summer months when the field would be reconfigured for softball. 
The placement of a minor league baseball team would mean the relocation 
of the Bombers.[15] The Florida State League granted the city of Clearwater 
a franchise on September 26, 1984, generating protests from the Bombers 
and their local supporters.[16] A new home was built for the Bombers adjacent 
to the Phillies' Carpenter Complex. In 1985, for the Clearwater Phillies' 
first-season in the Florida State League, a new home clubhouse and additional 
seating were added to the ballpark. The Clearwater Phillies played their 
first game against the Tampa Tarpons at home on April 12, 1985.[17] On 
August 23, 1992, the Clearwater Phillies defeated the Winter Haven Red 
Sox 1-0 in the first double no-hitter in 40 years. Andy Carter pitched 
for Clearwater and Scott Bakkum pitched for Winter Haven. The Phillies 
won on two walked batters and two sacrifice bunts in the seventh inning.[18] 
In a spring training game on April 2, 1993, Frank Viola and Cory Bailey 
combined on a no-hitter as the Red Sox defeated the Phillies 10-0 at Jack 
Russell.[19] The Clearwater Phillies played their last game at Jack Russell 
on Saturday night, August 23, 2003. The attendance of 6,472 was the second-largest 
crowd ever to watch the Clearwater Phillies at the ballpark. Robin Roberts 
threw out the first-pitch of the game and Clearwater lost 6-2 to the Sarasota 
Red Sox.[20] Wilbur Snapp served as Stadium organist from 1982 through 
1996. Snapp had run a music store in Springfield, Ohio and retired to Florida 
in 1978. He played organ for both spring training and Florida State League 
games. Snapp received national attention following his ejection from an 
FSL ballgame in 1985. On June 25, 1985 during a Clearwater Phillies game 
against the Osceola Astros, an umpire called a close-out against Clearwater. 
Snapp agreed with the boos of the crowd and began playing "Three Blind 
Mice."[21] The umpire ejected Snapp, the first time an organist was ejected 
by an umpire during a game.[22] Willard Scott mentioned it on NBC's Today 
show, and Paul Harvey talked about it on his syndicated radio program. 
Clearwater replaced Snapp with recorded music in 1997 but it was reported 
that Snapp continued to attend home games at the Stadium.[23] The ballpark 
was listed in 1957 as having a seating capacity of 6,500 for concerts.[24] 
The Rolling Stones played Jack Russell Stadium on May 6, 1965 during their 
22-show 3rd American Tour.[25] That night, Keith Richards found the guitar 
riff for (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction in his sleep, when he briefly woke 
up in his room at the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, recorded the riff 
and the phrase "I can't get no satisfaction", and went back to sleep.[26] 
The pop-band 'N Sync was from Orlando, Florida and played a concert at 
Jack Russell in 1996.[20] On January 14, 2000, Tampa's Michael "Gold" Rush 
claimed the vacant National Boxing Association's cruiserweight belt with 
a technical knockout of Pedro Riveron at 1 minute, 34 seconds into the 
seventh round in front of 1,500 spectators. The Clearwater City Council 
voted on June 7, 2007 to partially raze the stadium. That summer, JVS Contracting 
Inc. of Tamp[27] – MapQuest demolished much of the stadium for $104,280.[28] 
The field, dugouts, bleachers, batting cages and the two-story office in 
the right field corner remain from the original structure. High school 
and college baseball games and tournaments, and other amateur baseball 
games have been held at the stadium, along with other events. Clearwater 
High School plays its home baseball games at the field. The Winning Inning 
and the City of Clearwater hosted the Clearwater College Invitational in 
March 2008 at Jack Russell Memorial Stadium. Two of the twelve participating 
institutions included NCCAA Division II National Champions Southeastern 
University and NAIA Region III Champions Northwestern College.[29] The 
St. Petersburg/Clearwater Sports Commission hosted the inaugural Big East/Big 
Ten Baseball Challenge in February 2009. The Challenge featured all ten 
Big Ten baseball teams and eight of the Big East teams. Jack Russell Stadium 
was one of five local ballparks hosting Challenge games.[30] Jack Russell
