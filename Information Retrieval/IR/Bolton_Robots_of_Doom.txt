Robots of Doom[1] (formerly Bolton Blaze) is an English baseball team from 
Bolton situated in the North West region of England, playing in the Northern 
AA Division under the British Baseball Federation. Information on the beginnings 
of Bolton baseball are scarce. The earliest known details date back to 
1938. The then named Bolton Scarlets Baseball team played their first game 
at Raikes Park in Bolton against a team from Oldham in May 1938. The modern 
team began in the summer of 2002 while Matthew Norburn was the General 
Manager and player for Manchester A's Baseball Club. Frustrated with the 
lack of direction and commitment Norburn decided to look into setting up 
a new club in his hometown of Bolton. After early talks with the Bolton 
Local Authority, who were eager to have a baseball team set up in Bolton 
plans moved forward. Norburn recruited fellow player Barrie Joyce from 
Manchester to help set the club up. Norburn and Joyce finished off the 
season in Manchester and Norburn resigned as the club's GM. Bolton Baseball 
Club took the team name of Brewers and went about preparing for 2003 baseball 
season, with only two team members. The Brewers soon secured a council 
grant that would ensure adequate equipment could be purchased. As the 2003 
season came closer Bolton had built up a good roster size with former junior 
players and people new to the sport. However the planned baseball field 
would not be ready till the end of the inaugural season. In a last minute 
deal Bolton Baseball agreed to join CMB Sports Club located in Lostock 
and became known as CMB Baseball Club. Bolton Baseball Club remained part 
of CMB Sports Club for 3 years before making a move to their own facility. 
The team took this opportunity in 2006 to rename the team to the Blaze. 
The move to a new ground proved to be one of the biggest mistakes the club 
would ever make. The new ground provided by the Local Authority turned 
into a money pit. The ground situated off Slack Lane, Westhoughton was 
continually flooded by poor drainage. Looking to put a brave face on and 
play the season opener on this poor attempt of a field, Bolton awaited 
visiting team Humber. After looking at the state of the field, Humber refused 
to play at that site. The teams did however manage to locate a suitable 
site across town to play the game at Markland Hill Playing Fields. With 
no official home field, Bolton played the rest of the 2006 season at two 
different locations. During the 2006 off-season major interest was put 
to the local council for use of the Markland Hill playing fields. After 
many discussions with the council it was agreed that Bolton Baseball Club 
could use the field. The field was renamed the Ballpark at Stapleton Avenue. 
Since the 2007 season the Blaze have invested heavily in developing the 
ball park in the aim that it will become one of the best facilities in 
the country. During 2007 a junior baseball team was re-introduced into 
the Bolton community, originally headed by John Baxendale and later to 
be fulfilled by Andrew Lee Heaton. The junior team, named the Bears, entered 
league play in 2008. In 2009 the junior team was taken over by Dave Clugston 
who is still currently the junior team manager. In 2008 the Bolton Blaze 
changed its name to Bolton Robots of Doom after a much-maligned voting 
process. The name change was met with a mixed reaction from its own players. 
Some embraced the outlandish new name, whilst others remained unimpressed; 
so much so that one player duly quit the team citing the name change as 
being utterly ridiculous. As one fan on a public forum put it..."You cannot 
make this stuff up!". Nevertheless, club GM, Matthew Norburn, pressed on 
and remained unmoved by any criticism. Once the name was formally announced 
in the public domain, it again was greeted with varied reactions. Local 
team rivals scorned and ridiculed the club, whilst baseball fans bought 
into the spirit of such an unusual name, to the point where fans of the 
MLB's New York Mets began a thread on a fans' forum grandslamsingle.com 
discussing what they felt was a unique and inspired team name. One thing 
was guaranteed, no other baseball team had the name Robots of Doom. Over 
the next few years, the team would evolve on a playing level. By introducing 
more talented players into the team Bolton R.o.D. would develop from its 
status as perennial division whipping boys, to serious divisional contenders. 
The team would also begin to take part in mid-season European tournaments, 
beginning in Dublin in 2008 where on the opening day Bolton R.o.D. almost 
upset the British allstar team, Northern Knights and kept within touching 
distance of the Irish national side, Team Ireland. Then it was off to the 
Netherlands in 2009 & 2010, where the standards of baseball were at higher 
levels than had previously encountered. These elements combined would ultimately 
lead the club to its first ever playoff appearance in 2009, and a second 
playoff appearance in 2010 following the club's greatest success when it 
won AA/A North Division Title with a winning record of 18–6. 2010 also 
saw the club's first ever win on European soil against Hagen Chipmunks 
of Germany, and ultimately finishing 4th narrowly losing by 1 run to the 
tournament favourites Rouen Dragons of France. In 2010 the club were featured 
in a two-page article entitled 'Bolton's Batmen' in Lancashire Life magazine, 
which covered the club's history and involvement in the Bolton community, 
and club GM Matthew Norburn was interviewed for BBC Radio live on air. 
This was Norburn's final act as club GM before returning to his native 
Canada and handing over General Manager's role over to Dom Clarke who lead 
the club into the 2011 season. '33' Adam Johnson (July 1981 – September
