In baseball, the batting average (BA) is defined by the number of hits 
divided by at bats. It is usually reported to three decimal places and 
pronounced as if it were multiplied by 1,000: a player with a batting average 
of .300 is "batting three-hundred." A point (or percentage point) is understood 
to be .001 . If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken 
to more than three decimal places. Outfielder Ty Cobb, whose career ended 
in 1928, has the highest batting average in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
history.[1] He batted .366 over 24 seasons, mostly with the Detroit Tigers. 
In addition, he won a record 11 batting titles for leading the American 
League in BA over the course of an entire season. He batted over .360 in 
11 consecutive seasons from 1909 to 1919.[2] Rogers Hornsby has the second 
highest BA of all-time, at .358.[1] He won seven batting titles in the 
National League (NL) and has the highest NL average in a single season 
since 1900, when he batted .424 in 1924. He batted over .370 in six consecutive 
seasons.[3] Shoeless Joe Jackson is the only other player to finish his 
career with a .350 batting average.[1] He batted .356 over 13 seasons before 
he was permanently suspended from organized baseball in 1921 for his role 
in the Black Sox Scandal.[4] Lefty O'Doul first came to the major leagues 
as a pitcher, but after developing a sore arm, he converted to an outfielder 
and won two batting titles.[5] The fifth player on the list, and the last 
with at least a .345 BA, is Ed Delahanty. Delahanty's career was cut short 
when he fell into the Niagara Falls and died during the 1903 season.[6] 
The last player to bat .400 in a season, Ted Williams,[7] ranks tied for 
seventh on the all-time career BA list. Babe Ruth hit for a career .342 
average and is tied for ninth on the list. Miguel Cabrera holds the highest
