The 1988 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in Major League Baseball. 
The Phillies finished sixth in the National League East with a record of 
65 wins and 96 losses. The Phillies were scheduled to play the Cubs in 
the first night game at Wrigley Field on August 8, 1988. The game began 
before an announced crowd of 39,008. The Cubs were leading 3 to 1 and coming 
to bat in the bottom of the fourth when the rain delay began. The umpires 
called the game after waiting two hours, ten minutes.[3] The Cubs' first 
official night game came the following night against the Mets. Montreal 
Expos pitcher Pascual PÃ©rez threw a five-inning rain-shortened no-hitter 
against the Phillies on September 24, 1988. It was the first no-hitter 
in Veterans Stadium history. Perez allowed one walk, and another Phillies 
baserunner reached on an error. Umpire Harry Wendelstedt waved off the 
game after a 90-minute rain delay after the game was stopped by a steady 
rain with one out in the top of the sixth.[4] However, due to a statistical 
rule change in 1991, no-hitters must last at least nine innings to count. 
As a result of the retroactive application of the new rule, this game and 
thirty-five others are no longer considered no-hitters. Infielders Coaches
