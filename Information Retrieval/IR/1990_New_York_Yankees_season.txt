The New York Yankees' 1990 season was the 88th season for the Yankees. 
The team finished in seventh place in the American League East with a record 
of 67-95, finishing 21 games behind the Boston Red Sox. It was the Yankees' 
first last-place finish in 24 years, and the first in the two-division 
era. New York was managed by Stump Merrill and Bucky Dent. The Yankees 
played at Yankee Stadium. Multi-time former Yankees manager Billy Martin 
was working as a special consultant to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner 
when he was killed in a one-car crash in Binghamton, New York, on Christmas 
Day (December 25) in 1989. Martin had been drinking heavily with his friend, 
William Reedy, who was driving a pickup truck at the time of the accident. 
When Martin was killed, the media reported that he was a passenger in Reedy's 
pickup. However, Peter Golenbock, in his book Wild, High, and Tight: The 
Life and Death of Billy Martin, makes the case that Martin was the driver 
and that his wife and Reedy covered up the truth. According to the HBO 
TV series Autopsy,[9] forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden performed 
the autopsy on Martin and investigated the accident scene, including the 
pick-up truck in which Martin died. The autopsy revealed that Martin's 
impact injuries were all on the right side, and that hair and other DNA 
found on the right side of the shattered windshield belonged to Martin, 
who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident. The conclusion 
of the autopsy study was that Reedy drove the pick-up. Billy Martin was 
eulogized by Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor at St. Patrick's Cathedral, 
New York, before his funeral at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New 
York. His grave is located about 150 feet from the grave of Babe Ruth. 
The following epitaph by Billy Martin himself appears on the headstone: 
I may not have been the greatest Yankee to put on the uniform but I was 
the proudest. Former President of the United States Richard Nixon attended 
Martin's funeral. The Yankees started the season with a small number 1 
on their left sleeves. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
