Joe & Josephine Bruin The UCLA Bruins football program represents the University 
of California, Los Angeles in college football as members of the Pac-12 
Conference at the NCAA Division I FBS level. The Bruins have enjoyed several 
periods of success in their history, having been ranked in the top ten 
of the AP Poll at least once in every decade since the poll began in the 
1930s. Their first major period of success came in the 1950s, under head 
coach Henry Russell Sanders. Sanders led the Bruins to the Coaches' Poll 
national championship in 1954, three conference championships, and an overall 
record of 66–19–1 in nine years. In the 1980s and 1990s, during the tenure 
of Terry Donahue, the Bruins compiled a 151–74–8 record, including 13 bowl 
games and an NCAA record eight straight bowl wins. The program has produced 
28 first round picks in the NFL Draft, 30 consensus All-Americans, and 
multiple major award winners, including Heisman winner Gary Beban. The 
UCLA Bruins' main rival is the USC Trojans. Jim L. Mora is the current 
head coach. The Bruins were the Pac-12 Conference South Division champions 
for two years in a row and played Pac-12 Football Championship Games in 
both 2011 and 2012. The first football team fielded by UCLA took the field 
in 1919.[3] The team was coached by Fred Cozens.[3] That UCLA football 
team compiled a 2–6 record.[3] UCLA did not participate in an athletic 
conference until 1920, so the 1919 football team played a schedule full 
of local high schools and other assorted teams.[3] Cozens was UCLA's athletics 
director from 1919 to 1942.[4] Harry Trotter took over the young UCLA football 
program after Cozens stepped down after guiding the Bruins in their first 
season.[5] UCLA began to play in the Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference (SCIAC) in 1920, and competed against Occidental College, 
California Institute of Technology, University of Redlands, Whittier College, 
and Pomona College.[5] Coach Trotter's two wins were against Redlands and 
San Diego State, which did not join the SCIAC until 1926.[5] Trotter left 
UCLA with a 2–13–1 record in three seasons (1920–1922).[5] James J. Cline 
took over the Bruins football program as its third head coach in 1923.[5] 
Coach Cline's two wins were against Loyola University and San Diego State.[5] 
Cline was replaced after two seasons and a 2–10–3 record.[5] William H. 
Spaulding came to UCLA from Minnesota in 1925. As the Bruins head coach, 
his overall record in fourteen seasons was 72–51–8.[6] During his tenure 
in Los Angeles, Spaulding led the Bruins to their first bowl appearance 
and victory, the 1938 Poi Bowl.[6] Also during Spaulding's tenure, the 
Bruins left the SCIAC and joined the Pacific Coast Conference beginning 
in 1928.[7] Spaulding's 72 wins rank him among the best in head coaching 
victories in Bruin football history.[8] He retired after a successful fourteen-season 
tenure ended after the 1938 season.[9] Edwin C. Horrell was promoted to 
head coach following Spaulding's retirement.[10] His 1942 UCLA Bruins team 
lost to Georgia in the 1943 Rose Bowl.[11] He was the first coach to lead 
a UCLA team to defeat the rival USC.[10] It was the first football victory 
in the UCLA-USC rivalry. The most notable player who played for Horrell 
at UCLA was Jackie Robinson.[10] Horrell's 1939 team compiled a 6–0–4 and 
his 1941 team posted a 5–5–1 record.[11] With the exception of the 1942 
season, the combined record of the Bruins during Horrell's tenure outside 
the aforementioned seasons was 6–22–1.[11] These struggles led to Horrell's 
firing after six seasons at the helm of UCLA football.[10] Coach Bert LaBrucherie 
was hired by his alma mater to replace Horrell.[10] LaBrucherie's overall 
record at UCLA was 23–16.[12] In his second year as head coach, the Bruins 
were Pacific Coast Conference champions, but lost to Illinois in the Rose 
Bowl.[13] LaBrucherie's Bruins only posted one losing season during his 
four seasons, a 3–7 1948 season in what turned out to be his final season.[12] 
LaBrucherie accepted the position of head football coach at California 
Institute of Technology after the 1948 season, departing UCLA.[10] Henry 
Sanders came to UCLA from Vanderbilt.[14] He was arguably the best coach 
in school history, with an overall record of 66–19–1 (.773) at UCLA and 
earned the school its only national championship in football in 1954.[15] 
As head coach of the Bruins, Sanders led them to three Pacific Coast Conference 
(PCC) titles, two Rose Bowls (1953 and 1955 seasons) and to a 6–3 record 
over arch-rival USC.[10][15] Sanders instituted the distinctive football 
uniforms worn by the Bruins when he replaced the navy blue jerseys with 
"powderkeg blue," added the shoulder stripe to give the impression of motion, 
and changed the number style from block to clarendon.[10] Sanders said 
these changes were made to make it easier to see his Bruins on the grainy 
black and white game films of the time.[10] The 1954 Bruins compiled a 
9–0 record and climbed to the top of the Coaches' Poll, sharing the national 
championship with Ohio State, winner of the AP Poll's title.[15] Due to 
the PCC's early "no repeat" rule, the undefeated Bruins were unable to 
compete in the Rose Bowl that season despite being the PCC champion.[10] 
Second-place USC, who the Bruins defeated 34-0, played in the 1955 Rose 
Bowl instead and lost to Big Ten Conference champion and eventual co-national 
champion Ohio State, 20-7.[10] Henry Sanders was also known for intensifying 
the Bruins' rivalry with USC.[10] His teams were always given a speech 
before the game against their cross-town rivals that always ended with 
"Beat SC!" A famous quote was attributed to Sanders regarding the rivalry, 
"Beating 'SC is not a matter of life or death, it's more important than 
that."[16][17] Shortly before the 1958 season was set to begin, Coach Sanders 
suffered and died from a heart attack in a Los Angeles hotel.[18][19] Assistant 
coach George W. Dickerson took over the Bruins on an interim basis before 
suffering a nervous breakdown.[20] Then, a full-time head coach was hired. 
For his successes, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame 
as a coach in 1996.[21] William F. Barnes was the head coach for the UCLA 
Bruins football team for seven seasons.[22] He guided his teams to a 31–34–3 
(.478) record.[22] He did have two seven-win seasons in 1960 and 1961, 
leading the Bruins to the 1962 Rose Bowl.[22] That year, the Bruins finished 
the season ranked #16 in the final AP poll.[22] Barnes resigned after the 
1964 season after learning that athletics director J.D. Morgan was not 
going to renew his contract.[23][24] On January 11, 1965, Tommy Prothro 
was hired away from Oregon State as head coach of the UCLA Bruins.[10] 
In the 1965 football season, the Bruins lost their season opening game 
13-3 at Michigan State, who then rose to become the top-ranked team in 
the country.[10] The unheralded Bruins would go on a seven-game undefeated 
streak, surprising the national powers likes of Syracuse and Penn State.[10] 
Going into the 1965 UCLA-USC rivalry football game ranked #7, the conference 
championship and 1966 Rose Bowl were on the line.[10] #6 USC, led by Heisman 
Trophy winner Mike Garrett led 16-6 until UCLA got a touchdown on a pass 
from Gary Beban to Dick Witcher with four minutes to play.[10] After the 
two-point conversion made it 16–14, UCLA recovered an onside kick.[10] 
Beban then hit Kurt Altenberg on a 50-yard bomb and UCLA won, 20-16.[25] 
Integrated UCLA then faced all-white Tennessee in the newly built Liberty 
Bowl stadium in Memphis, Prothro's native city.[10] On the last play of 
the game, Tennessee defensive back Bob Petrella intercepted a UCLA pass 
to save a Volunteer win by a score of 37-34.[10] Tennessee's winning drive 
was aided by a controversial pass interference call, the clock had questionably 
stopped twice, and a dropped pass that appeared to be a lateral was recovered 
by UCLA but was later ruled an incomplete forward pass.[10] After the game, 
Prothro stated, "For the first time in my life, I am ashamed to be a Southerner."[26] 
Heading into the final game of the 1966 season vs. USC, UCLA was 2–1 in 
conference games, 8–1 overall and ranked #5 in the country.[10] The Bruins, 
featuring a "dream backfield" of All-Americans Gary Beban and Mel Farr, 
lost only one game, at rainy Washington, 16-3, where Huskies' head coach 
Jim Owens had devoted his entire season to beating Prothro.[10] UCLA had 
beaten UW the season before, 28-24, with Prothro's trick play, the Z-streak 
in which a receiver trots towards the sideline like he's going out of the 
game and then runs a streak pattern unguarded by the inattentive defender.[10] 
USC was 4–0 in conference and 7–1 overall, having lost to unranked Miami.[10] 
The Bruins and Trojans played a different number of conference due to uneven 
scheduling caused by new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State and schedules 
made years in advance.[10] It was widely assumed that only losses would 
be considered and the winner of the 1966 UCLA-USC game would go to the 
1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star quarterback Gary Beban broke his ankle the week 
before in a win over Stanford, but backup Norman Dow, making his first 
and only start at quarterback, led UCLA to a 14-7 win.[27][28] That left 
USC with a 4–1 conference record (7–2 overall) and #5 UCLA with a 3–1 conference 
record (9–1) overall. Due to their win over USC, it was widely assumed 
UCLA would get the Rose Bowl berth. However, a vote the next Monday among 
the AAWU conference athletic directors awarded USC the Rose Bowl berth.[10] 
It was speculated that the directors believed Beban could not play for 
UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big Ten 
Conference representative, Purdue, a better chance to win. As it turned 
out, Beban could have played. But a bigger reason was that this was to 
make up for 1964 when Oregon State was voted in ahead of USC. The coach 
of Oregon State in 1964 was Prothro.[10][29] Another speculation was the 
vote was against UCLA out of pure jealousy by the rest of the conference, 
which voted 7–1 for the clearly inferior team. This vote deprived Prothro 
of being the first coach to earn three consecutive Rose Bowl berths and 
UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan called it a "gross injustice" and the 
"a dark day in UCLA and AAWU Athletic history." Inflamed UCLA students 
who had gathered for the Rose Bowl celebration rally, took to the streets 
of Westwood in protest and actually blocked the 405 Freeway for a short 
time.[10] Ironically, Morgan was the force behind establishing a tie-breaking 
method adopted by the conference one year later in which only loss column 
counted; the first tiebreaker was head-to-head results, followed by overall 
record. If there was still a tie, the Rose Bowl berth would go to the team 
that had not played in the Rose Bowl the longest. But it was too late for 
UCLA. In their final game, USC made the AAWU decision look bad by losing 
to Notre Dame, 51-0. They went on to lose the Rose Bowl as well to Purdue, 
14-13, finishing the season at 7–4. In 1967, Prothro helped a second quarterback 
capture the Heisman Trophy when Gary Beban was awarded the trophy after 
the regular season.[10] He would bring his #1 ranked UCLA Bruin team to 
face #2 USC in one of the "Games of the Century". Despite playing with 
cracked ribs, Beban threw for 301 yards, but UCLA lost, 21-20, on a spectacular 
64-yard run by O. J. Simpson in the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game.[10] 
Another big factor was UCLA's acclaimed sophomore kicker Zenon Andusyshyn 
missing a chip shot field goal, and having two field goals and an extra 
point attempt blocked.[10] In what was acknowledged to be a rebuilding 
year, the Bruins opened the 1968 season with a 63-7 defeat of Pittsburgh 
and a win over Washington State.[30] The season ground to a halt at Syracuse 
and with the season-ending injury of quarterback Billy Bolden, and UCLA 
would win only one more game, over Stanford 20–17. The Bruins gave #1 USC 
and Heisman Trophy winner O. J. Simpson a scare in a 28–16 loss;[30] UCLA 
trailed 21–16 late in the fourth quarter and had the ball inside USC's 
10-yard line, but USC recovered a fumble and then used almost all of the 
remaining time in driving for their insurance touchdown. 1969 was the year 
Prothro had geared his recruiting efforts towards as he believed this was 
his best team and was capable of contending for the national championship.[10] 
The Bruins, quarterbacked by a sensational Junior College transfer Dennis 
Dummit discovered by Prothro, were undefeated until they faced #10 Stanford 
in Palo Alto.[31] Once again, Prothro was let down by now senior kicker 
Zenon Andrusyshyn as he missed a short field goal late in the game with 
the score tied 20–20.[10] Suddenly, two long Jim Plunkett passes had Stanford 
in field goal range in the final seconds, but UCLA blocked Steve Horowitz's 
attempt to preserve the tie.[10] One again, the UCLA-USC game would decide 
the Pac-8 title and the 1970 Rose Bowl berth. UCLA was ranked 6th with 
a 5–0–1 record in conference and 8–0–1 overall USC was #5 and was 6–0 in 
conference and 8–0–1 overall (tied Notre Dame in South Bend, 14-14); UCLA 
and USC were both unbeaten coming into their rivalry game for the first 
time since 1952. UCLA scored midway through the fourth quarter to take 
a 12-7 lead (knowing he need a win and not a tie to advance to the Rose 
Bowl, Prothro had the Bruins go for two after each touchdown and each attempt 
failed).[10] USC then drove to the winning touchdown with 1:38 to play 
to win 14-12. The Trojans were aided by two controversial calls; the first 
was a dubious pass interference call on UCLA's Danny Graham on a 4th-and-10 
incompletion. Secondly, on the winning touchdown pass reception, USC receiver 
Sam Dickerson appeared to be either out of bounds, out of the back of the 
end zone, or both. This loss supposedly was harder for Prothro to take 
than the 1967 loss and the freak officiating calls resembled the debacle 
at Tennessee in 1965.[10][32] In what turned out to be his final season 
at UCLA, Prothro's team suffered a rash of key injuries and finished 6–5, 
yet they were three close games from a 9–2 season and Rose Bowl berth.[33] 
Before those injuries set in, UCLA took a 3–0 record into Austin to play 
defending national champ and top ranked Texas.[33] Trailing 13-3 at the 
half, UCLA rallied and had a 17-13 lead in the final minute. But with 12 
seconds left, Texas completed a long pass when their receiver caught the 
ball between two UCLA defenders, who then collided, allowing the receiver 
to score. UCLA also blew a 20-point fourth quarter lead against Oregon, 
when Ducks sophomore quarterback Dan Fouts rallied his team to three touchdowns 
and a 41–40 win.[33] Finally, there came the showdown with Stanford; the 
game was expected to be a shootout between UCLA quarterback Dennis Dummit 
and Heisman winner Jim Plunkett. But the defenses ruled as UCLA took a 
7-6 lead into the 4th quarter. Stanford took a 9-7 lead on a field goal, 
but UCLA was driving to a potential game winning field goal or touchdown 
themselves when they completed a pass inside the Stanford 10-yard-line, 
only to have the receiver get sandwiched by two defenders on the tackle 
and fumble. This game ultimately decided the Pac-8 championship and 1971 
Rose Bowl representative. The season ended on a high note however, when 
UCLA beat rival USC, 45–20, in a game that was not that close. This would 
end up being Prothro's final game at UCLA. Prothro was frustrated by bizarre 
officiating at critical moments, numerous last minute narrow losses, and 
losing out of the Rose Bowl by the conference vote in 1966.[10] Prothro 
also decried the Pac-8 rule that only allowed the conference champion to 
go to a bowl game; he witnessed many lower ranked inferior teams (often 
ones he defeated during the season) go to bowl games while his Bruins stayed 
home.[10] After George Allen was fired by the Los Angeles Rams, Prothro 
accepted that job,[10] leaving the Bruins after six seasons and a 41–18–3 
record.[29] Prothro was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame 
as a coach in 1991.[34] Pepper Rodgers came to UCLA from Kansas after the 
departure of Prothro. In Rodgers' three seasons at the helm of the Bruins, 
UCLA finished 2–7–1, 8–3 and 9–2.[35] In 1972, the Bruins finished the 
season ranked #17 and #15 in the final Coaches' and AP polls, respectively.[35] 
In 1973, the Bruins finished ranked #9 and #12 in the final Coaches' and 
AP polls, respectively.[35] Rodgers surprised UCLA fans, players and administration 
by deciding to accept the head football coach position at his alma mater, 
Georgia Tech after the 1973 season.[36] He left the Bruins after compiling 
a 19–12–1 overall record.[35] As head coach at UCLA, Dick Vermeil compiled 
a 15–5–3 record in two seasons (1974–75), including a 9–2–1 record in 1975 
when he led the Bruins to their first conference championship in 10 years, 
and a win in the Rose Bowl over undefeated and number 1 ranked Ohio State.[37] 
Vermeil won Pac-10 Coach of the Year honors in 1975.[37] Vermeil became 
to second out of three UCLA head coaches (and third in a row to leave UCLA 
for another job) to leave for the NFL when he accepted on offer to become 
head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.[38] His final record as head coach 
of the Bruins is 15–5–3.[37] Terry Donahue was promoted from assistant 
coach to head coach of the Bruins football team following Vermeil's departure.[39] 
Donahue has the most conference wins of any head coach in Pacific-10 Conference 
history (98) and also the most wins in UCLA football history (151).[39] 
His teams compiled a record of 8–4–1 in bowl games and were the first to 
win a bowl game in seven consecutive seasons.[40] Donahue's UCLA teams 
won or shared five Pacific-10 Conference championships and won three Rose 
Bowls (1983, 1984, and 1986).[40] Donahue's record was 10–9–1 against USC 
in the UCLA–USC rivalry.[39][41] His teams won four New Year's Day bowl 
games in a row from 1983 to 1986.[39] Donahue retired from coaching after 
twenty seasons and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame 
as a coach in 2000.[39] His final record is 151–74–8.[40] Bob Toledo was 
promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach of the Bruins after Donahue's 
retirement.[10] In 1996, his first season as head coach, the Bruins finished 
with a 5–6 record.[42] The highlight of the season was a comeback win over 
USC. The 1997 team finished as co-champions of the Pacific-10 Conference 
with Washington State.[42] However, with Washington State defeating the 
Bruins in the season opener, the Cougars earned the right to play in the 
Rose Bowl.[10] The highlights of that season were a 66-3 win over the Texas 
and a victory at the Cotton Bowl Classic over Texas A&M, and a victory 
over USC.[10] The 1998 season started out as one of the best in the history 
of UCLA football.[10] The team was high enough in the BCS standings to 
merit entry to the national championship game, and all UCLA needed to do 
was beat unranked University of Miami, who were major underdogs after a 
66-13 loss to Syracuse the week before.[10] UCLA was also coming off of 
their eighth consecutive victory over USC and 20th straight win overall. 
However, Miami won 49-45, ending UCLA's chances of playing in the national 
championship game.[10] They instead settled for a trip to the Rose Bowl 
as Pac-10 champions, but lost to Wisconsin.[42] This is seen as the turning 
point for the UCLA football program.[10] The 1999 season was a major disappointment, 
with the team finishing 4–7.[42] This was the first year that USC had defeated 
them in the annual Battle for the Victory Bell since 1990.[43] The year 
also had the dubious distinction of a 55–7 loss to Pac-10 foe Oregon State, 
the worst defeat of the Bruins in 69 years.[43] In 2000, the Bruins finished 
6–6 with a loss in the Sun Bowl, again against Wisconsin.[44] The 2001 
season started with promise as the Bruins got off to a fast start with 
a 6–0 record.[45] However, four straight losses to Stanford, Washington 
State, Oregon, and USC, the Bruins faded out of postseason contention.[45] 
UCLA finished off 8–5 in Toledo's final season in 2002.[46] The team finished 
7–5 in the regular season, but Toledo was fired after a fourth straight 
loss to USC.[47] The Bruins did reach the Las Vegas Bowl and interim coach 
Ed Kezirian coached—and won—his only game in charge of the program.[46] 
Toledo finished with a record of 49–32, for a winning percentage of .605, 
including one winning streak of 20 consecutive victories, a school record.[42] 
Toledo's greatest accomplishment with the team may have been in the 1997 
season, where the team finished 10–2 with a victory over Texas A&M in the 
Cotton Bowl Classic.[42] Toledo's Bruins were 3–4 against UCLA's cross-town 
archrival, the USC Trojans.[10] Longtime college and NFL assistant Karl 
Dorrell was brought in to revive the glory of the UCLA football program, 
his alma mater, after Toledo was fired.[48] Dorrell also was brought in 
to UCLA to clean up a program marred by off-the-field problems in the final 
years of Bob Toledo's tenure.[49] He was the first African American head 
football coach in UCLA football history. Dorrell's UCLA Bruins team recorded 
a mark of 6–7 in his first season as head coach in 2003, with an appearance 
in the Silicon Valley Bowl, and a loss to Fresno State.[50] In 2004, his 
second season, the team finished with a record of 6–6 an appearance in 
the Las Vegas Bowl, with a loss to Wyoming.[51] In 2005, his third season 
as head football coach, Dorrell was able get his first win against a ranked 
opponent, No. 21 Oklahoma, featuring Adrian Peterson.[52] On October 1, 
2005, head coach Tyrone Willingham and his Washington Huskies came to the 
Rose Bowl for a Pacific-10 Conference game to play UCLA. This was the first 
time two black head coaches faced each other in a Pac-10 conference game. 
At the time, Sylvester Croom of Mississippi State was the only other black 
coach heading an NCAA Division I football program. Dorrell achieved his 
first win against a top-ten opponent with a 47-40 upset win over No. 10-ranked 
rival California.[52] Three Bruin wins in the 2005 season set new school 
records for biggest comebacks earning the nickname "The Cardiac Kids." 
They came thanks largely to the heroics of quarterback Drew Olson and tailback 
Maurice Jones-Drew. In the regular season the Bruins came from down 21 
points to win in overtime against both Washington State and Stanford.[52] 
In the Stanford comeback, the Bruins scored 21 points in the final 7:04 
of the fourth quarter.[53] In the Sun Bowl, the Bruins set the record again 
by coming back from 22 points down.[52] The Bruins were ranked No. 7 in 
the nation until a 52–14 blowout loss to a 3–8 Arizona team.[52] The Bruins 
came into the UCLA-USC rivalry last regular season game ranked No. 11. 
They suffered a 66–19 defeat to the No. 1 2005 USC Trojans football team.[52] 
This was the largest margin of defeat since the series began in 1929 with 
a 76-0 defeat. The Bruins finished third in the Pac-10 standings. On December 
30, 2005 his Bruins defeated the Northwestern Wildcats in the Sun Bowl, 
50-38, finishing the season with a 10–2 record.[52] At the end of the 2005 
season, Dorrell received pay bonuses for coaching successful seasons. He 
was named Pac-10 co-coach of the year along with USC head coach Pete Carroll.[54] 
In 2006, Dorrell's fourth season, the Bruins finished the season 7–6 (5–4 
in conference) and finished fourth-place in the Pac-10.[55] UCLA played 
its first game at the University of Notre Dame since the 1960s and was 
leading 17-13, but the Irish scored a touchdown in the final minute to 
win.[56] The most notable victory of his coaching career at UCLA was a 
13–9 defeat of No. 2-ranked and Bowl Championship Series title-game-bound 
USC on December 2, 2006.[55] The win kept the Trojans out of the title 
game and broke a seven-game UCLA losing streak to the Trojans, thereby 
preserving the Bruins' eight-game win streak over USC from 1991 to 1998 
as the longest run in the history of the rivalry. The victory also clinched 
a winning season for UCLA. The Bruins played in the Emerald Bowl in San 
Francisco against a Bobby Bowden-coached Florida State team on December 
27, 2006 and lost, 44-27.[55] In Dorrell's fifth season at UCLA, with 20 
returning starters and a team of his own recruits, hopes were high for 
the Bruins in 2007.[10] After starting the season with a couple of wins 
over Stanford and BYU, and achieving a No. 11 AP Poll ranking, however, 
UCLA stumbled against an injured, winless, and unranked Utah team, 44-6.[57] 
Four weeks later, Dorrell's Bruins fell again; this time 20–6 to an unranked, 
winless Notre Dame team.[58] The Bruins did, however, post wins against 
seemingly more difficult PAC-10 opponents, including a No. 10 Cal team. 
However; the bad taste of losses to teams the Bruins were favored to beat 
(including an embarrassing 27-7 loss to Washington State) raised questions 
about Dorrell's play-calling and ability to motivate his players.[10] After 
the Washington State loss, UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero addressed 
UCLA's inconsistent football performances for the first time, stating "I 
will be very interested to see how we finish the season. And you can use 
that."[10] Many took this as a hint that Dorrell's job might be in serious 
jeopardy.[59] The Bruins would go on to lose to Arizona and Arizona State 
by a combined score of 58–47, but surprisingly shut out an Oregon Ducks 
team that a week earlier lost starting quarterback and Heisman Trophy Candidate 
Dennis Dixon to a knee injury. Heading into the final game of the regular 
season against crosstown-rival USC, the Bruins still had an outside chance 
at a Rose Bowl berth that might have saved Dorrell's job; with a victory 
over USC and some help from Arizona (with a win over ASU), the Bruins could 
have been the first-ever five-loss team to play in the Rose Bowl. It wasn't 
to be, however, and the Bruins finished the 2007 Regular season with a 
miserable offensive performance in a 24–7 loss to USC and a record of 6–6.[60] 
On December 3, 2007, Los Angeles papers and the Associated Press reported 
that Karl Dorrell was fired during a meeting with athletic director Dan 
Guerrero.[61] Dorrell was offered the choice, but decided not to coach 
in the Las Vegas Bowl. Defensive coordinator DeWayne Walker served as interim 
coach for the game, where UCLA lost to BYU.[62] On December 29, 2007, Baltimore 
Ravens offensive coordinator Rick Neuheisel, formerly head coach at Colorado 
and Washington, was brought back to his alma mater and hired as UCLA's 
15th head football coach after his former Bruins teammate Dorrell was fired.[63] 
Neuheisel coined the phrase "Passion Bucket" during an interview on The 
Dan Patrick Show by saying, "When you’re at UCLA, you have to have your 
passion bucket full when you play the Trojans."[64] Neuheisel had his first 
win on September 1 as the Bruins' head coach as they defeated #18 Tennessee, 
27-24.[65] The win came in overtime as Tennessee's field goal try sailed 
wide left.[66] However, the team's momentum came to a halt in successive 
weeks. A brutal 59–0 defeat on the road at the hands of #15 BYU was followed 
by a disappointing 31–10 loss at home to unranked Arizona in the Bruins' 
Pac-10 opener.[65] The UCLA offense failed to score a touchdown in either 
contest. The team finished the season 4–8 overall and 3–6 in conference.[65] 
Despite this record, Neuheisel was still able secure the fifth-best recruiting 
class in the nation in 2009 as rated by Scout.com. The class was headlined 
by Morrell Presley, Randall Carroll, offensive linemen Xavier Sua-Filo 
and Stan Hasiak, and running back Damien Thigpen. Nevertheless, the Bruins 
fell to 4–8 in 2010, losing six of their last seven games and failing to 
receive a bowl berth. Player injuries and other attrition depleted UCLA 
of its roster depth, while true freshmen were forced into action and seniors 
who were previously reserves became starters; a quarterback who had attempted 
only 17 passes in his career became the starter.[67] At the end of the 
season Neuheisel fired two assistant coaches, including Chow, and said 
he would “be crushed ... if we’re not going to a bowl game a year from 
now.” [68] The 2011 season brought about continued mediocre performance, 
although the team's record improved to 6–6 in regular season play.[69] 
Despite the lackluster overall record, the Bruins won the first Pac-12 
South Division title, as crosstown rival USC was ineligible due to NCAA 
sanctions.[69] A 50-0 shutout loss to USC to end the regular season—UCLA's 
fifth consecutive loss to the Trojans—prompted speculation that Neuheisel 
would be fired. Neuheisel was fired as head coach of UCLA on November 28, 
2011.[70] He was allowed to coach his final game at the December 2 Pac-12 
Conference football Championship game, where the team lost 49-31 to the 
Oregon Ducks.[71] On December 10, 2011, UCLA athletics director Dan Guerrero 
announced the hiring of former Atlanta Falcons and Seattle Seahawks head 
coach, Jim L. Mora, as the Bruins' 16th head football coach.[72] Mora signed 
a three-year contract.[73] The results of the new regime came early, as 
UCLA landed a consensus #12 ranked recruiting class in 2012 after having 
a class ranked in the high 40s at Rick Neuheisel's departure.[74][75] In 
Mora's first season, the Bruins finished 9–5 capped with a loss in the 
2012 Holiday Bowl.[76] In Mora's second season, the Bruins improved to 
10–3, capping the season with a victory in the 2013 Sun Bowl.[76] Behind 
the leadership of quarterback Brett Hundley, the Bruins came within one 
game of reaching the Pac-12 championship game and beat crosstown rivals 
USC for the second straight year.[73] In Mora's third season, the Bruins 
finished 10-3 again. The team beat rival Southern Cal for the third straight 
year and won the Alamo Bowl against Kansas State. Paul Perkins led the 
Pac-12 in rushing with 1,575 yards. The fourth season brought the arrival 
of freshman quarterback Josh Rosen, a rash of injuries, and erratic play 
by the offense. The Bruins finished 8-5, including a loss to Nebraska in 
the Foster Farms Bowl. UCLA's rivalry with USC is unusual in that they 
are one of a few pairs of Division I FBS programs that share a major city. 
Both are within the Los Angeles city limits, approximately 10 miles (16 km) 
apart. Until 1982, the two schools also shared the same stadium: the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The crosstown rivals play each year for city 
bragging rights and the Victory Bell; and often for the right to go to 
the Rose Bowl. The USC rivalry tends to draw the focus of student supporters 
since many UCLA students have friends or family members attending "that 
other school" (of course, many USC students refer to their UCLA friends 
in the same manner) and many Southern California families are evenly divided 
between Trojan Cardinal and Bruin Blue. USC leads the all-time series 44–30–7 
(2 Southern Cal victories vacated by the NCAA).[77] The Bruins also enjoy 
an annual rivalry with another in-state conference foe, the California 
Golden Bears. The rivals have faced each other 84 times, every year starting 
in 1933.[78] UCLA leads the all-time series against Cal, 51-32-1.[78] The 
Rose Bowl is a National Historic Landmark located in Pasadena, California 
with an official capacity of 92,542. It has been the home football field 
for the UCLA Bruins since the 1982 season. The Bruins had played their 
home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after joining the Pacific 
Coast Conference in 1928. The Coliseum is also the home of the rival USC 
Trojans. As the Coliseum is located across the street from the USC campus, 
Bruin officials long sought to move out from under the Trojans' shadow. 
An on-campus facility was discussed, but UCLA's location is not conducive 
to adequate traffic flow, and the campus lacks room for sufficient parking. 
There was an attempt to build a 44,000 seat stadium on campus, at the site 
where Drake Stadium eventually was built. However, the proposal was blocked 
by influential area residents, as well as other politicians.[79][80] In 
addition, the Coliseum already was constructed by and is a facility of 
the State of California. When the Oakland Raiders became the Los Angeles 
Raiders, in 1982, and after arduous negotiations with the city of Pasadena, 
UCLA decided to move out of the Coliseum, relocating its home games to 
the Rose Bowl Stadium.[81] UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games 
since moving to the stadium, including the 1983 Rose Bowl at the end of 
the Bruins' first season there. From 1919 to 1927, the Bruins (then known 
as the Cubs) used Moore Field at the Vermont Ave. campus of the "Southern 
Branch of the University of California."[82] Training room, weight room, 
football facilities, and locker rooms are all located in the Acosta Athletic 
Complex, just west of Pauley Pavilion. The on campus practice facility 
for the football team is Spaulding Field, which has two football fields, 
one grass and one artificial turf, or synthetic turf. Because of space 
constraints, the Bruins don't have a complete 100 yard field for practice. 
The Wasserman Football Center will be built immediately west of Spaulding 
Field, the football team’s practice field. The UCLA athletic colors are 
"True Blue" and gold. The "True Blue" is a slightly darker shade than the 
previous powder blue worn by teams.[83] In the early days of the school, 
UCLA had the same colors as the California Golden Bears: Yale Blue and 
California Gold.[84] Blue symbolized the ocean, while gold represented 
the state of California, known as the "Golden State".[85] When football 
coach Red Sanders came to UCLA for the 1949 season he redesigned the football 
uniforms. The Yale Blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders 
figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. 
He would dub the baby blue uniform "Powderkeg blue", powder blue with an 
explosive kick.[85][86] For the 1954 season, Sanders added the now familiar 
loop on the shoulders, the UCLA Stripe, to give an impression of motion.[87] 
The away uniforms became white, with a navy blue and gold shoulder stripe 
and gold pants. The helmets became gold. At times, beginning with the 1954 
football season, the font for the numbers on the uniforms has been Clarendon 
typeface. Otherwise it has been block numerals.[87] In the 1980s the uniform 
pants became yellow to look better in color publications, the jerseys a 
lighter blue, and the UCLA script was added to the helmets. In the 1990s, 
the uniform pants became gold again. In 2003, the True Blue colors were 
adopted.[83] The away uniforms got true blue shoulder stripes and numbers 
in 2006,[88] but were replaced by navy blue again in 2010.[89] In 2009, 
the Bruins wore a 1967 throwback uniform against Washington and USC, though 
against USC the team's normal helmet was worn. UCLA has played in 35 bowl 
games in its history, compiling a record of 17–17–1. From 1946 to 1974, 
no team could participate in the Rose Bowl two years in a row. This is 
why the 1954 team, which won the conference, did not participate in the 
1955 Rose Bowl. UCLA became the first school to have a top winner in both 
basketball and football in the same year with Gary Beban winning the Heisman 
Trophy and Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) winning the U.S. Basketball 
Writers Association player of the year award in 1968. The following former 
Bruins have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Five
