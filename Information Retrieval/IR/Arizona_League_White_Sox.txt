The Arizona League (AZL) White Sox is a member franchise of the Rookie-level 
Arizona League in American minor league baseball.[1][2] The AZL White Sox 
re-entered the league in 2014 after an 11-year hiatus. They previously 
played from 1998 through 2002. At the close of the 2013 season, the parent 
Chicago White Sox announced their intention to sever their 19-year-long 
relationship with the Bristol White Sox of the Appalachian League, and 
relocate their second rookie-level affiliation with an Arizona League team 
operating from the team's spring training base at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, 
Arizona.[2] The return of the White Sox to the AZL was subject to the league's 
board of directors, but AZL president Bob Richmond said in October that 
he "didn't foresee any difficulties."[2] The AZL White Sox share the Camelback 
Ranch stadium with the Arizona League Dodgers, whose parent team, the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, also trains at the Glendale facility. The 2014 AZL White 
Sox finished tied for fourth overall in the circuit, with a 30–25 (.545) 
record,[3] and will return to the field in 2015. The Pittsburgh Pirates 
replaced the White Sox in Bristol, Virginia, and the Appalachian League 
as the new owners and operators of the Bristol Pirates.[4] The White Sox' 
previous entry in the Arizona League played at facilities in Tucson (1998–2000) 
and Phoenix (2001–02). The team formed after the parent ChiSox moved their 
spring training headquarters from Sarasota, Florida, to Tucson Electric 
Park after the 1997 season, in the process effectively transplanting their 
Rookie-level Gulf Coast League White Sox across the country to the Arizona 
League. The AZL White Sox compiled a record of 115–161 (.417) during their 
first incarnation, never posting a winning mark. The White Sox departed 
the Arizona League in 2003, affiliating with what is now the Great Falls 
Voyagers of the Pioneer League; in 2014, Great Falls will mark its 12th 
season as a ChiSox farm club. Former Major League All-Star catcher Tony 
Peña began his career as a manager with the 1998 AZL White Sox. He has 
since managed the MLB Kansas City Royals (2003–2005) and has been a coach
