known for hitting a walk-off home run in Game 3 of the series against the 
Atlanta Braves; it was his second of the night.[5] In an on-field interview 
immediately after the home run, Curtis refused to talk to NBC sportscaster 
Jim Gray in response to Gray's controversial interview on gambling with 
Pete Rose, a former baseball player who has been banned from involvement 
with MLB.[6] Curtis told Gray, "I can't do it. As a team, we kind of decided 
– because what happened with Pete – we're not going to talk out here on 
the field." However, former manager Joe Torre later said there was no unified 
front from either the Yankees players or Yankees front office to snub Gray, 
and that Curtis had acted alone with his viewpoint.[7] After the MasterCard 
All-Century Team ceremony before Game 2, Gray had aggressively asked Pete 
Rose about gambling on baseball.[8] During Curtis' time in New York he 
chatised his teammate Derek Jeter to the media after one game because, 
while the Seattle Mariners and Yankees were in a mild dustup on the field, 
Jeter, according to Curtis, shouldn't have been talking with Mariners' 
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who viewed any Mariners' player as the enemy.
