Phillipsburg is a town in Warren County, New Jersey, in the United States.[21] 
As of 2010 United States Census, the town's population was 14,950,[10][11][12] 
reflecting a decline of 216 (-1.4%) from the 15,166 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn declined by 591 (-3.8%) from the 15,757 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[22] Phillipsburg was incorporated as a town by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on March 8, 1861, from portions of Phillipsburg 
Township (now Lopatcong Township).[23] The town was named for William Phillips, 
an early settler of the area.[24] The town is located in western New Jersey, 
on the border of Pennsylvania, and is considered the eastern border of 
the region's Lehigh Valley. The Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh Line 
(formerly the main line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad with Central Railroad 
of New Jersey main line trackage), runs through Phillipsburg on its way 
cross river to Easton, Pennsylvania. According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the town had a total area of 3.311 square miles (8.575 km2), including 
3.193 square miles (8.270 km2) of land and 0.118 square miles (0.305 km2) 
of water (3.56%).[1][2] Unincorporated communities, localities and place 
names located partially or completely within the town include Andover Furnace, 
Delaware Park, Lopatcong Heights, Shirmers and Warren Heights.[25] Pohatcong 
Mountain is a ridge, approximately 6 mi (9.7 km) long, in the Appalachian 
Mountains that extends from Phillipsburg northeast approximately to Washington. 
The Town's economic data (as is all of Warren County) is calculated by

a major transportation hub, situated at the confluence of the Delaware 
and Lehigh rivers. Phillipsburg served as the western terminus of the Morris 
Canal for approximately 100 years from the 1820s to 1920s, which connected 
the city by water to the industrial and consumer centers of the New York 
City area, with connections westward via the Lehigh Canal and Delaware 
Canal across the Delaware. Long gone is the era of canal shipping and many 
of the important freight railways that served the area have gone bankrupt 
or bypass the city on long distance routes.[37] Phillipsburg was served 
by five major railroads: 1. Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) 2. Lehigh 
& Hudson River Railroad (L&HR) 3. Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) 4. Delaware, 
Lackawanna & Western Phillipsburg Branch (DL&W) 5. Pennsylvania Railroad 
Belvidere Division (PRR). Most of the manufacturing jobs have left Warren 
County's largest city. In 1994, the New Jersey Legislature designated Phillipsburg 
as an Urban Enterprise Zone community. This zoning offers tax incentives 
and other benefits to Phillipsburg-based businesses, as well as a 3½% sales 
tax rate at eligible merchants, reduced from the 7% rate charged statewide.[38] 
In recent years, some businesses have begun to move into the center of 
the city. Rising real estate prices indicate that these legislative stimulants 
have been somewhat effective.[citation needed] Phillipsburg has been selected 
as a site for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Heritage Center 
(jointly with Netcong), a museum designed to help preserve and showcase 
the state's transportation history.[39] A tourist railroad known as the 
Belvidere & Delaware River Railroad operates on the former Belvidere-Delaware 
Railroad Pennsylvania Railroad Branch serving excursions from Lehigh Junction 
Station south to Carpentersville. Norfolk Southern serves the industrial 
manufacturing purposes in Phillipsburg using former LVRR tracks and the 
L&HR bridge to connect with the Bel-Del PRR tracks. Since 2007, New Jersey 
Transit has been conducting a study to determine if re-establishing a commuter 
rail extension of the Raritan Valley Line to Phillipsburg is economically 
feasible.[40] Phillipsburg also is home to the Phillipsburg Railroad Historians 
museum. They display railroad memorabilia inside the museum, an "N" scale 
diorama, two Lehigh & Hudson River cabooses (one of which is currently 
being restored) and a Jersey Central caboose. There is a L&HR snow flanger, 
Tidewater tank car, a CNJ box car owned by the Anthracite Railroads Historical 
Society, a 1922 Chestnut Ridge Mack railbus owned by the Lehigh Valley 
NRHS, a Public Service trolley owned by the North Jersey Electric Railway 
Historical Society, a 44-ton GE locomotive and a 25-ton GE locomotive.[41] 
They operate a miniature railroad, the Centerville & Southwestern, that 
formerly ran in Roseland, New Jersey.[42] Phillipsburg is governed under 
the Mayor-Council system of municipal government within the Faulkner Act, 
formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, by a mayor and a 
five-member Town Council. Councilmembers are elected at-large in partisan 
elections to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either 
three seats or two seats and the mayoral seat up for election in odd-numbered 
years.[7][43] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Phillipsburg is Democrat 
Stephen R. Ellis Jr., whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.[3] Town 
Council members are Council President Todd M. Tersigni (R, 2017), Council 
Vice President Bernie Fey Jr. (R, 2017), Joshua Davis (D, 2019), Mark Lutz 
(D, 2019) and Randy S. Piazza Sr. (R, 2017).[44][45][46][47][48] Phillipsburg 
is located in the 7th Congressional District[49] and is part of New Jersey's 
23rd state legislative district.[11][50][51] Prior to the 2010 Census, 
Phillipsburg had been part of the 5th Congressional District, a change 
made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 
2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[52] 
New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District is represented by Leonard Lance 
(R, Clinton Township).[53] New Jersey is represented in the United States 
Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[54] and Bob Menendez 
(D, Paramus, 2019).[55][56] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General 
Assembly), the 23rd Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Michael J. Doherty (R, Washington 
Township, Warren County) and in the General Assembly by John DiMaio (R, 
Hackettstown) and Erik Peterson (R, Franklin Township, Hunterdon County).[57] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[58] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[59] 
Warren County is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders whose three 
members are chosen at-large on a staggered basis in partisan elections 
with one seat coming up for election each year as part of the November 
general election. At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning 
of January, the board selects one of its members to serve as Freeholder 
Director and other as Deputy Director. As of 2014[update], Warren County's 
Freeholders are Freeholder Director Edward J. Smith (R, Asbury / Franklin 
Township, 2015), Freeholder Deputy Director Richard D. Gardner (R, Asbury 
/ Franklin Township, 2014) and Freeholder Jason Sarnoski (R, Lopatcong 
Township, 2016).[60] Constitutional officers elected on a countywide basis 
are County Clerk Patricia J. Kolb (Blairstown Township),[61] Sheriff David 
Gallant (Blairstown Township) and Surrogate Kevin O'Neill (Hackettstown).[62][63]

District serves public school students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth 
grade, including students from five sending communities who attend the 
district's high school.[74] The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts 
statewide,[75] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the 
requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation 
projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools 
Development Authority.[76][77] As of the 2012-13 school year, the district's 
seven schools had an enrollment of 3,667 students and 329.3 classroom teachers 
(on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.13:1.[78] Schools 
in the district (with 2012-13 enrollment data from the National Center 
for Education Statistics[79]) are Early Childhood Learning Center[80] (Grades 
PreK-K, 555 students), Barber School[81] (1&2, 204), Freeman School[82]

Phillipsburg High School Stateliners have an athletic rivalry with neighboring 
Easton, Pennsylvania's Easton Area High School, which celebrated its 100th 
anniversary game on Thanksgiving Day 2006.[91] In 2009, the 1993 teams 
from the Easton P-Burg Game met again for the Gatorade REPLAY Game to resolve 
the game, which ended in a 7-7 tie, with more than 13,000 fans watching

which was established in 1875 and serves students in pre-Kindergarten through 
eighth grade, operating under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese 
of Metuchen.[96][97] Situated at the confluence of the Delaware River and 
the Lehigh River, Phillipsburg has historically been a major transportation 
hub. From the 1820s to 1920s, was the western terminus of the Morris Canal, 
which connected it by water eastward to the Port of New York and New Jersey 
and westward via the Lehigh Canal across the Delaware River. Five major 
railroads converged in Phillipsburg, the Central Railroad of New Jersey 
(CNJ), the DL&W's Morris and Essex Railroad, the Lehigh & Hudson River 
Railroad (L&HR), Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR), and the Pennsylvania Railroad's 
(PRR) Belvidere Delaware Railroad.[98][99] The CNJ first ran in 1852.[100][101][102][103] 
Phillipsburg Union Station served CNJ and DL&W. The CNJ tracks and bridge 
in Phillipsburg which was part of the CNJ main line became part of the 
former Lehigh Valley Railroad main line, the Lehigh Line now owned by Norfolk 
Southern Railway, while the PRR line in Phillipsburg is now the Belvidere 
and Delaware River Railway.[104] As of May 2010[update], the town had a 
total of 59.21 miles (95.29 km) of roadways, of which 54.51 miles (87.73 km)

1.18 miles (1.90 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 
0.54 miles (0.87 km) by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission.[105] 
Major highways that enter Phillipsburg include U.S. Route 22 and Route 
122. Interstate 78 passes through for less than a quarter-of-a-mile without 
any exits, but the closest interchange is in neighboring Pohatcong. The 
town is connected to Pennsylvania across the Delaware River by the Easton–Phillipsburg 
Toll Bridge - (toll bridge carrying U.S. Route 22), Northampton Street 
Bridge (the "Free Bridge") and the Interstate 78 Toll Bridge (carrying 
Interstate 78), all of which are operated by the Delaware River Joint Toll 
Bridge Commission.[106] New Jersey Transit bus service is provided on the 
890 and 891 routes.[107] It is also served by a bus line down Route 57 
to Washington Township.[108][109] By air, Phillipsburg is served by Lehigh 
Valley International Airport. People who were born in, residents of, or
