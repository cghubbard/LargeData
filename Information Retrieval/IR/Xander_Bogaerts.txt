Xander Jan Bogaerts, OON (Papiamento pronunciation: [ˈsandər ˈboxarts]; 
born October 1, 1992) nicknamed The X-Man, is an Aruban professional baseball 
shortstop for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. After being 
signed as an amateur free agent by the Red Sox in 2009, Bogaerts made his 
MLB debut in 2013, appearing in 30 games between the regular season and 
postseason, and helping the Red Sox to the World Series championship. He 
became the Red Sox' starting shortstop in 2014, and in 2015 was awarded 
the American League Silver Slugger award at the position. Mike Lord, a 
scout for the Boston Red Sox, discovered Bogaerts at the age of 16, in 
2009. After not playing baseball for two weeks due to the chicken pox, 
Bogaerts played for Lord, who recommended him to Craig Shipley, the Red 
Sox' vice president of international scouting. Shipley flew to Aruba to 
watch Bogaerts play. The Red Sox signed him to a contract with a $410,000 
signing bonus.[1] Bogaerts made his professional debut in 2010 with the 
Dominican Summer League (DSL) Red Sox, where he batted .314 with a .396 
on-base percentage (OBP) and .423 slugging percentage (SLG). He led the 
DSL Red Sox in batting average, hits (75), home runs (3), runs batted in 
(RBI) (42), total bases (101), slugging and on-base plus slugging (OPS). 
He was fifth in the DSL in RBI and tenth in total bases. He had a .929 
fielding percentage. The next year, at age 18, Bogaerts played in a full-season 
league for the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League, with 
a .260 batting average, .324 OBP and .509 SLG, fielding .924 and hitting 
16 home runs in 72 games. He then joined the Dutch national team for the 
2011 Baseball World Cup, winning the gold medal.[2] During the 2012 season, 
Bogaerts started out in Class-A and ended up playing with the Portland 
Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League.[3] He was named to appear in the 
2012 All-Star Futures Game.[4] He played for the Netherlands national baseball 
team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[5] Heading into the 2013 season, 
Bogaerts was ranked the fifth overall prospect by ESPN's Keith Law, who 
described him as "Still just 20 years old, Bogaerts has been playing solid 
shortstop for Portland with a solid walk rate but isn't yet generating 
the power expected from his explosive swing."[6] Entering 2013, Bogaerts 
ranked 6th in the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list,[7] and 8th in the Baseball 
America Top 100 Prospects list.[8] He started the season with Portland 
and was promoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Triple-A International 
League in mid-June.[9] The Red Sox promoted Bogaerts to the major leagues 
on August 19.[10] Bogaerts made his MLB debut on August 20 against the 
San Francisco Giants. He got his first major league hit five days later 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 7, Bogaerts hit his first 
MLB home run against New York Yankees pitcher Jim Miller.[11] At the end 
of the 2013 Minor League season, Bogaerts gained USA Today Minor League 
Player of the Year honors and was named to the 2013 Baseball America Minor 
League All-Star Team.[citation needed] During his brief stint in the Majors 
of 2013, Bogaerts appeared in 18 games batting .250 with a home run, 5 
RBI, and a stolen base. Despite debuting late in the season, Bogaerts was 
part of the 25-man active roster during the postseason run. Bogaerts had 
a strong performance in the postseason as he batted .296 with 2 RBI in 
12 postseason games, eventually leading to the Red Sox winning their eighth 
overall World Series.[12]Bogaerts also became the youngest player to hit 
a triple in World Series history. Bogaerts started the year as the starting 
shortstop for the Boston Red Sox on 3/31/14 against the Baltimore Orioles. 
On May 29, Bogaerts had his first walk-off plate appearance on a throwing 
error by Atlanta Braves third baseman Chris Johnson, allowing Red Sox outfielder 
Jackie Bradley Jr to reach home. On June 2, Bogaerts was moved back to 
third base after the Red Sox resigned Stephen Drew. He was moved back to 
short once again when the Red Sox traded Drew to the rival New York Yankees 
at the trading deadline on July 31, 2014. Bogaerts broke out in 2015, leading 
the Red Sox with a career-high .320 average, finishing second only to Miguel 
Cabrera for the AL batting title. From late July, Bogaerts began to bat 
second or third exclusively.[13] He was awarded the Silver Slugger award 
for shortstop.[14] On top of his breakout offense, Bogaerts was also a 
finalist for the Rawlings Gold Glove Award at shortstop. In 2016 Bogaerts 
again began the season as the Red Sox' starting shortstop, primarily batting 
third. .[15] Between May 6 and June 2, Bogaerts hit safely in 26 consecutive 
games. His hitting streak came to an end in a loss to the Toronto Blue 
Jays on June 3. In 2016 he was chosen to play in his first ever MLB All 
Star Game of his career [16] Bogaerts finished the season batting .294 
and was once again given the American League's shortstop Silver Slugger 
Award. Xander has a twin brother, Jair.[17] Jair also signed with the Red 
Sox as an international free agent. He was sent to the Chicago Cubs prior 
to the 2012 season to complete the compensation regarding Theo Epstein.[17] 
Xander Bogaerts is the fifth Aruban to play in MLB, following Sidney Ponson, 
Calvin Maduro, Gene Kingsale, and Radhames Dykhoff. In 2011, after winning 
the gold medal in the Baseball World Cup, Bogaerts was inducted into the 
Knights Order of Orange-Nassau by the Governor of Aruba.[2][18] Bogaerts
