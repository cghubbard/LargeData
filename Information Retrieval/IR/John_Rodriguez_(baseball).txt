John Joseph Rodriguez (born January 20, 1978 in New York City, is a retired 
Major League Baseball Player. He played in the Major Leagues for the St. 
Louis Cardinals from 2005-2006. Rodriguez attended Brandeis High School. 
He signed as an undrafted free agent by the Yankees in 1996. Rodriguez 
played in the Yankees minor league system for eight seasons before signing 
with the Cleveland Indians in 2005. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
later that year and forced a major league call-up to replace the injured 
Reggie Sanders by hitting .342 with 17 home runs in 34 games with Triple-A 
the Memphis Redbirds. He performed well enough that the Cardinals signed 
him to a one-year contract following the season. On July 20, 2005, Rodriguez 
hit his first career home run off Ben Sheets of the Milwaukee Brewers. 
Rodriguez got more playing time for the 2006 Cardinals (183 at-bats, 34 
more than the year before) and was on the postseason roster, winning a 
World Series ring when the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series. On November 
30, 2007, the Cardinals designated Rodriguez for assignment, removing him 
from the 40-man roster to make room for newly acquired shortstop, CÃ©sar 
Izturis.[1] Shortly thereafter the team released him.[2] Rodriguez signed 
a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays on January 4, 2008, but 
did not make the major league team out of spring training. On June 2, 2008, 
Rodriguez was released. On June 8, Rodriguez signed a minor league contract 
with the New York Mets and was assigned to Triple-A New Orleans. On January 
6, 2009, Rodriguez signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees. 
After playing the entire season with the Scranton/Wilkes Barre Yankees, 
he became a free agent. On May 7, 2010 signed with the Long Island Ducks. 
On March 2, 2011, he signed a contract with the Long Island Ducks.[3] In 
May 2012, signed to play for the Wichita Wingnuts in the American Association.
