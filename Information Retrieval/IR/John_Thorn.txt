John Thorn (born April 17, 1947) is a sports historian, author, publisher, 
and cultural commentator. Since March 1, 2011, he has been the Official 
Baseball Historian for Major League Baseball.[1][2][3] Thorn was born in 
Stuttgart, Germany,[3] where his Polish Jewish parents had come as refugees.[2] 
Less than two years after Thorn was born, his family emigrated to the United 
States, and settled in the Bronx, New York. “I fell in love with [baseball] 
cards before I loved the game, when I discovered that baseball was something 
that all the kids on my street corner cared about," Thorn said in a 2013 
profile. "I was an immigrant kid and was looking for a way into America. 
With my background I saw myself as an underdog, and so Brooklyn had to 
be my team. I began watching the game seriously when I was eight, in 1955, 
on my Admiral television, but I had already begun to follow their exploits 
in the daily newspapers my father brought home with him each night.”[4] 
As a teen he played baseball and basketball. However, at age 19 he suffered 
a stroke. "It was severe," he said, "knocking out my left-side function 
for months as well as patches of personal memory—though not the powerful 
visual memory I retain for images and facts and statistics." The stroke 
left him with a limp and precluded his further participation in athletic 
activities.[5] Thorn graduated from Beloit College in 1968.[2][6] He is 
married to Erica Freudenberger, director of the Red Hook, New York, Public 
Library. He and his wife live in Catskill, New York,[7] where they moved 
in 2010. He claims to have been drawn to the town because of its "slow 
pace," which suits him because, Thorn asserts, "I pride myself on being 
the world’s most boring man."[7] Thorn has three sons from two previous 
marriages.[5] Thorn is the author and editor of numerous books, including 
Total Baseball: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball,[2] 
Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of Major League Football, Treasures 
of the Baseball Hall of Fame, The Hidden Game of Baseball,[2] The Glory 
Days: New York Baseball 1947–1957, and The Armchair Book of Baseball.[2] 
His 2011 book, Baseball in the Garden of Eden: The Secret History of the 
Early Game, published by Simon & Schuster, was an in-depth chronicle of 
the seminal development and pioneers of the sport.[8] A New York Times 
review of the latter book referred to Thorn as "a researcher of colossal 
diligence."[9] Thorn is also the co-author with Pete Palmer and Bob Carroll 
of The Hidden Game of Football and with them co-editors of Total Football. 
His book New York 400, a graphic history of the city timed for its quadricentennial, 
created with the Museum of the City of New York and Running Press, was 
published in September 2009. Thorn is a columnist for Voices, the publication 
of the New York Folklore Society. He founded Total Sports Publishing and 
served as its publisher from 1998–2002. Thorn served as the senior creative 
consultant for the 1994 Ken Burns documentary Baseball.[6] In 2004 Thorn 
discovered documentation that traced the origins of baseball in America 
to 1791 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.[10] He has also attempted to shed 
light on the contributions of 19th century pioneers of the game, while 
debunking common misconceptions. "I don't want anyone to think of me as 
a crusader on behalf of causes," he wrote. "I'm only interested in setting 
the story straight, and in recognizing other stories for what they are, 
some of which are legend."[11] Despite the claims of various localities 
to being the "birthplace of baseball," Thorn simply follows facts. "Abner 
Doubleday, Santa Claus and Dracula," he notes, "are equally mythic figures."[10] 
In June 2006, the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) bestowed 
on Thorn its highest accolade, the Bob Davids Award.[12] The award honors 
those whose contributions to SABR and baseball reflect the ingenuity, integrity, 
and self-sacrifice of the founder and past president of SABR, L. Robert 
"Bob" Davids. On March 1, 2011, he was named Official Baseball Historian 
for Major League Baseball.,[6] succeeding the late Chicago Tribune and 
Chicago Sun-Times baseball writer Jerome Holtzman, who served from 1999
