Robert Matthew Byrne (December 31, 1884 – December 31, 1964) was a third 
baseman in Major League Baseball. From 1907 through 1917, he played for 
the St. Louis Cardinals (1907–1909), Pittsburgh Pirates (1909–1913), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1913–1917) and Chicago White Sox (1917). Byrne batted and threw 
right-handed. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri. The speedy Byrne was 
a defensive stalwart with excellent range. He started his major league 
career with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1907 season. Acquired by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in late August 1909, he contributed for his new club 
down the stretch, including allowing Tommy Leach to stay in center field. 
Used mainly in the leadoff spot, Byrne made just two errors while hitting 
.256 with eight stolen bases. Byrne enjoyed his most productive season 
in 1910, when he posted career-numbers in batting average (.296), RBI (52), 
runs (101), stolen bases (36), slugging percentage (.417), and led the 
National League with 178 hits and in doubles with 43 (also career highs). 
Despite a low .259 average in 1911, Byrne scored 96 runs with 23 stolen 
bases and set career highs in triples (17) and games played (153). He raised 
to .288 in 1912, adding 31 doubles, 11 triples, and 20 steals. In the 1913 
midseason Byrne was traded by Pittsburgh along with pitcher Howie Camnitz 
to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for utility Cozy Dolan and cash 
considerations. In 1917 he was selected off waivers by the Chicago White 
Sox from the Phillies, making his last major league appearance in the 1917 
World Series. In an 11-season career, Byrne was a .254 hitter with 10 home 
runs and 329 RBI in 1283 games. He also collected 176 stolen bases and 
posted an above average walk-to-strikeout ratio of 2.07 (456-to-220). Byrne 
played soccer in the St. Louis Soccer League during the off-season. When 
he signed with the Pirates, team president Barney Dreyfuss ordered him 
to give it up.[1] Following his baseball career, Byrne was owner of a bowling 
alley in St. Louis.[2] Bobby Byrne died in Wayne, Pennsylvania on his 80th
