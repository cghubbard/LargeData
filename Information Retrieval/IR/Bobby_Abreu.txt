Bob Kelly "Bobby" Abreu (/əˈbreɪ.uː/; Spanish: [boβ aˈβɾeu]; born March 
11, 1974), nicknamed "El Comedulce" and also "La Leche", is a former Venezuelan 
professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets. Abreu is a two-time 
All-Star, and has won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award and a Silver Slugger 
Award. He has been a single-season league leader in games played (twice), 
doubles, and triples. Through 2014, he led active ballplayers in doubles 
(565), walks (1,456), and outfield assists (136), was fifth in runs scored 
(1,441) and in stolen bases (399), seventh in extra base hits (911) and 
on-base percentage (.396), and tenth in runs batted in (1,349).[1] Abreu 
was signed as an amateur free agent by the Houston Astros on August 21, 
1990. He was the Astros Minor League Player of the Year in 1996 and made 
his Major League debut on September 1, 1996, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He was announced as a pinch hitter but did not get to bat because he was 
subsequently pinch hit for himself with Mike Simms.[2] He had his first 
official at-bat the following day against the St. Louis Cardinals when 
he flied out to left field as a pinch hitter in the top of the 6th.[3] 
After a few more appearances as a pinch hitter or late inning defensive 
replacement, he made his first start in left field against the Colorado 
Rockies on September 6, going hitless in four at-bats with 2 strikeouts.[4] 
Abreu's first Major League hit was a single to right field as a pinch hitter 
against Bobby Jones of the New York Mets on September 24.[5] He finished 
his first season with 5 hits in 22 at-bats. He hit his first two home runs 
in the same game on April 28, 1997, against Jamey Wright and Steve Reed 
of the Colorado Rockies.[6] He played in 59 games for the Astros in 1997, 
hitting .250 with 3 homers. Left unprotected in the 1997 MLB Expansion 
Draft when the Astros decided to keep fellow Venezuelan outfielder Richard 
Hidalgo, Abreu was selected by the then Tampa Bay Devil Rays, only to be 
dealt hours later to the Phillies for shortstop Kevin Stocker,[7] a trade 
regarded among the worst in MLB history[8] In 1998, his first season with 
the Phillies, Abreu led the team with a .312 batting average and collected 
17 home runs, 74 RBI, and 19 stolen bases in 151 games, with 271 putouts 
and 17 assists in right field. In 1999, he made a brief run at the batting 
title. His .335 career-high average that season ranked third in the National 
League and was the highest posted by a Phillies player since outfielder 
Tony González hit .339 in 1967.[7] His .446 career-high OBP was third in 
the league and he tied for the league lead in triples with 11. In 2000, 
he finished fourth in the league in triples (10), sixth in doubles (42), 
seventh in walks (100), and ninth in OBP (.416). Abreu became the first 
Phillie outfielder since Greg Luzinski with back-to-back 20 homer seasons. 
In 2001, Abreu led the NL in games played (162), and was third in walks 
(106), fourth in stolen bases (36) and doubles (48), and eighth in runs 
(118) and sacrifice flies (9). He also hit a career-high 31 home runs and 
had a career-high 110 RBI. In 2002, he led the league in doubles (50), 
and was sixth in walks (104), seventh in stolen bases (31) and intentional 
walks (13), eighth in OBP (.413), ninth in hits (176), and tenth in runs 
(102). In 2003, Abreu was fourth in the league in walks (109), seventh 
in sacrifice flies (7), eighth in OBP (.409), and ninth in stolen bases 
(22). In 2004, Abreu got his first All-Star berth, being voted in as the 
National League All-Star Final Vote winner in online voting on MLB.com.[9] 
Abreu hit the first home run at Citizens Bank Park on Opening Day, April 
12, 2004. He finished the season with a .301 average, 30 home runs, and 
105 RBI, and ranked among the National League top five in five offensive 
categories: runs (fourth, 118) -- the third time in 6 years that he scored 
118 runs, doubles (fourth, 47), stolen bases (third, 40—a career high), 
walks (second, 127—a career high) and on-base percentage (fifth, .428). 
In 2004, Abreu also led the Major Leagues in pitches-per-plate-appearance 
(4.32) and number of pitches seen (3,077), was eighth highest in the league 
in total bases (312), and posted the league's tenth-best OPS (.971). In 
May, Abreu was honored as the Player of the Month in the National League, 
after he hit .396 and 11 home runs. He also led the NL for the month in 
slugging average (.792), on-base percentage (.535), and walks (30) and 
was tied for the league lead with 30 RBI. He became the first player in 
Major League history to hit at least one home run in nine out of ten team 
games. He was voted a starter in the NL outfield for the All-Star Game, 
finishing second in fan voting, behind St. Louis Cardinals Jim Edmonds. 
Prior to the All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit, Abreu won the Home 
Run Derby as he set records with 24 home runs in a single round (since 
broken by Josh Hamilton in 2008), and 41 overall, topping Miguel Tejada's 
previous marks of 15 and 27 set one year earlier. Abreu's longest homer 
was measured at 517 feet, the third longest in Derby history. On July 30, 
2006, Abreu was traded along with Cory Lidle to the New York Yankees for 
minor league shortstop C. J. Henry (a 2005 first-round draft pick), left-hander 
Matt Smith (a seven-year minor league veteran), catcher Jesus Sanchez, 
and right-hander Carlos Monasterios—all low-level prospects in the Yankee 
organization. Philadelphia Daily News columnist Bill Conlin called the 
trade "the Great Gillick Giveaway" and declared it "an unvarnished disaster." 
The Phillies actually improved after the Abreu trade and made a run for 
the National League wild card, only to be eliminated on the second to last 
day of the season. Abreu fit well into the Yankees lineup. He batted .297 
with 15 home runs and 107 RBI in the 2006 season. The Yankees ran away 
with the AL East division title by mid-September 2006, but were eliminated 
by the Detroit Tigers in the 2006 American League Division Series. In 2006, 
Abreu led the major leagues in walks (124), pitches per plate appearance 
(4.45), and number of pitches seen (3,056), and was second in the major 
leagues in percent of plate appearances that were walks (18.5%),[10] and 
led the AL in percentage of pitches taken (66.2), and in walks per plate 
appearance (.181), third in batting average on balls in play (.375),[10] 
eighth in on-base percentage (.424), 18th in stolen bases (30), and 19th 
in doubles (41). On September 12, 2006, Abreu drove in six runs in the 
first inning of the Yankees' 12–4 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
Abreu began the 9-run inning by homering with Johnny Damon and Derek Jeter 
on base, then concluded it with a bases-loaded double that scored Hideki 
Matsui, Melky Cabrera and Jeter.[11] The six RBIs tied Gil McDougald's 
55-year franchise record for most in one inning (McDougald batted in six 
runs in one inning in 1951, his rookie season). Alex Rodriguez broke the 
record shared by Abreu and McDougald by driving in seven runs in the sixth 
inning of 2009 regular season finale, also against Tampa Bay. After getting 
off to a slow start in (2007), Abreu finished the season strong putting 
up 101 RBI, 16 home runs and a .283 batting average. In 2007, Abreu was 
second in the AL in runs (123), third in pitches per plate appearance (4.38), 
ninth in games (158) and times on base (258), and tenth in walks (84) and 
plate appearances (699). Abreu hit a walk-off double on July 9, 2008. On 
September 18, Abreu hit 2 home runs and had 6 RBI in a game versus the 
Chicago White Sox and Javier Vázquez. He finished the season with a .296 
average, 20 home runs, and 100 RBI. He had the last stolen base in the 
original Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008. On February 12, 2009, Abreu 
signed a $5 million, one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
and was expected to play left field. However, after Vladimir Guerrero was 
moved to DH due to injury, Abreu saw more action at his natural position 
in right field. After struggling early in the season, Abreu hit .380 with 
28 RBI in 26 games in July and was named American League player of the 
month. Abreu became the first Angels player to reach those figures in batting 
average and RBI in one calendar month since Tim Salmon, who hit .390 with 
32 RBI in 27 games in July 1997. On August 6, Abreu led off the fifth inning 
with a solo home run off Chicago White Sox pitcher John Danks, giving him 
250 homers in his career. Abreu became one of only six players in major 
league history to collect 250 home runs, 2,000 hits, 1,000 runs, 1,000 
runs batted in, 1,000 walks and 300 stolen bases. In 2009, he led the AL 
in errors by an outfielder, with 8.[12] Though Abreu stated that he enjoyed 
his season with the Angels and was credited with helping many of the team's 
younger players to improve their swings and patience at the plate,[13] 
he turned down a two-year, $16 million extension on his contract on October 
15.[14] On November 5, 2009, the first day eligible players could file 
for free agency, Abreu accepted a two-year deal with the Angels, with a 
club option for 2012.[15] He cited the Angels manager, Mike Scioscia as 
one of the reasons, saying "He's one of those managers that lets you play 
the game, and he gives you big support." He also noted the organization 
publicly recognized his career achievements and consistently delivered 
opportunities to succeed in the postseason, saying, "This is a team that 
gives you an opportunity always to be in the playoffs. This time, my first 
time with them, I was very close to getting to the World Series, so why 
not stay? Of course you want a team that is going to give you opportunities 
to be in the World Series and win the World Series. I don't want to take 
a chance with someone else."[16] During the 2011–2012 offseason, the New 
York Yankees proposed a trade to the Angels that would have sent starting 
pitcher A. J. Burnett to Anaheim for Abreu. Abreu would have become the 
Yankees' regular designated hitter, but Burnett vetoed the trade. On February 
20, 2012, Burnett was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Yankees 
signed Raúl Ibañez to be the DH. Abreu was already annoyed that he wouldn't 
be playing every day for the Angels, and when he learned what Burnett had 
done, he ordered Angels' management to either play him every day as the 
designated hitter or trade him. Another proposed trade, which would have 
sent Abreu to the Cleveland Indians for Lou Marson, fell through.[17] Abreu 
was released by the Angels on April 27, 2012 and replaced on the roster 
by future Rookie of the Year and MVP Award winner Mike Trout.[18] On May 
4, 2012, Abreu signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[19] He was 
designated for assignment on August 1, 2012. Abreu cleared waivers and 
accepted an assignment to AAA Albuquerque. He had 6 hits in his 17 at-bats 
for the Isotopes before rejoining the Dodgers as a September call-up, spending 
the last month of the season as a pinch hitter. He played in 92 games with 
the Dodgers, hitting .246. After sitting out the 2013 season, Abreu participated 
in the 2013–14 Venezuelan Winter League and logged a .322 batting average 
in 180 plate appearances with Leones del Caracas. On January 21, 2014, 
Abreu signed a minor league contract with the Phillies.[20] He was released 
before the season on March 27. On March 31, 2014, Abreu signed a minor 
league deal with the New York Mets.[21] On April 21, the Mets promoted 
Abreu from the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, after trading Ike Davis to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[22] He was designated for assignment on August 4 and officially 
released on August 10.[23][24] However, just four days later on August 
14, the Mets re-signed Abreu to another minor league contract.[25] He was 
called back up to the majors on September 9, 2014. Abreu announced his 
retirement from baseball on September 26.[26] He singled in his final at-bat 
on September 28.[27] Abreu was noted for his plate discipline.[28][29] 
In 2009, he led the American League in percent of pitches taken at 67.5%,[30] 
while also having the fourth lowest percentage of swinging at the first 
pitch at 9.5%.[31] Abreu dated former Miss Universe Alicia Machado; the 
couple later split, calling off their engagement.[32][33] Abreu was involved 
in many events in the Philadelphia and Delaware Valley communities. In 
2001, he was the Honorary Chairman for the American Red Cross Blood Drive. 
Abreu bought $10,000 worth of tickets to most Friday night games for children 
in his "Abreu's Amigos" organization during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. 
In this program, the children got jerseys, coupons for concessions, and 
chances to meet Abreu on the field during batting practice. Abreu was the 
2004 recipient of the Phillies Community Service award and the Phillies' 
representative for MLB's Roberto Clemente Award. In 2008, Abreu made a 
contribution to the Police Athletic League of New York City through his 
Abreu's Finest charity wine to provide boys and girls with recreational, 
educational, cultural and social programs. Abreu is known as "El Comedulce" 
in Venezuela. The name translates roughly to "the candy-eater", which had 
been his father Nelson Abreu's nickname. Following Nelson's death, Abreu 
"began asking people to call him the same name as a way of honoring his
