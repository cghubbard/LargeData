The Chicago Tribune is a daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois, United 
States, owned by tronc, Inc., formerly Tribune Publishing. Founded in 1847, 
and formerly self-styled as the "World's Greatest Newspaper" (for which 
WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper 
of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region and is currently 
the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became 
the second largest under Tribune's ownership after the Chicago Tribune's 
parent company purchased the Los Angeles Times).[2] Traditionally published 
as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the Tribune announced it would continue 
publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid 
format for newsstand, news box and commuter station sales.[3] The move, 
however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the Tribune 
discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet 
edition through all distribution channels.[4] The Tribune's masthead is 
notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, 
"An American Paper for Americans," which is no longer displayed on the 
masthead, where it was below the flag. The Tribune was founded by James 
Kelly, John E. Wheeler and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing its first edition 
on June 10, 1847. The paper saw numerous changes in ownership and editorship 
over the next eight years. Initially, the Tribune was not politically affiliated 
but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the 
Democrats in elections.[5] By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic 
editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics.[6] About this 
time it also became a strong proponent of temperance.[7] However nativist 
its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the 
Tribune formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing 
party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following 
month.[8] By about 1854, part-owner Capt. J. D. Webster, later General 
Webster and chief of staff at the Battle of Shiloh, and Dr. Charles H. 
Ray of Galena, Illinois through Horace Greeley convinced Joseph Medill 
of Cleveland's Leader to become managing editor. Ray became editor-in-chief, 
Medill became the managing editor, and Alfred Cowles, Sr., brother of Edwin 
Cowles, initially was the bookkeeper. Each purchased one third of the Tribune.[9][10] 
Under their leadership the Tribune distanced itself from the Know Nothings 
and became the main Chicago organ of the Republican Party.[11] However, 
the paper continued to print anti-Catholic and anti-Irish editorials.[12] 
The Tribune absorbed three other Chicago publications under the new editors: 
the Free West in 1855, the Democratic Press of William Bross in 1858, and 
the Chicago Democrat in 1861, whose editor, John Wentworth, left his position 
to become Chicago Mayor. Between 1858 and 1860, the paper was known as 
the Chicago Press & Tribune. On October 25, 1860, it became the Chicago 
Daily Tribune.[13] Before and during the American Civil War, the new editors 
pushed an abolitionist agenda and strongly supported Abraham Lincoln, whom 
Medill helped secure the Presidency in 1860. The paper remained a force 
in Republican politics for years afterwards. In 1861, the Tribune published 
new lyrics for the song "John Brown's Body" by William W. Patton, rivaling 
the ones published two months later by Julia Ward Howe. Medill served as 
mayor of Chicago for one term after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Under 
the 20th-century editorship of Colonel Robert R. McCormick, who took control 
in the 1920s, the paper was strongly isolationist and aligned with the 
Old Right in its coverage of political news and social trends, calling 
itself "The American Paper for Americans", excoriating the Democrats and 
the New Deal, resolutely disdainful of the British and French and greatly 
enthusiastic for Chiang Kai-shek and Sen. Joseph McCarthy. When McCormick 
assumed the position of co-editor (with his cousin Joseph Medill Patterson) 
in 1910, the Tribune was the third-best-selling paper among Chicago's eight 
dailies, with a circulation of only 188,000.[14] The young cousins added 
features such as advice columns and homegrown comic strips like Little 
Orphan Annie and Moon Mullins, then turned to "crusades", with their first 
success coming with the ouster of the Republican political boss of Illinois, 
Sen. William Lorimer.[14] At the same time, the Tribune competed with the 
Hearst paper, the Chicago Examiner, in a circulation war. By 1914, the 
cousins succeeded in forcing out Managing Editor William Keeley. By 1918, 
the Examiner was forced to merge with the Chicago Herald. In 1919, Patterson 
left the Tribune and moved to New York to launch his own newspaper, the 
New York Daily News.[14] In a renewed circulation war with Hearst's Herald-Examiner, 
McCormick and Hearst ran rival lotteries in 1922. The Tribune won the battle, 
adding 250,000 readers to its ranks. Also in 1922, the Chicago Tribune 
hosted an international design competition for its new headquarters, the 
Tribune Tower. The competition worked brilliantly as a publicity stunt, 
and more than 260 entries were received. The winner was a neo-Gothic design 
by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood. The newspaper 
sponsored a pioneering attempt at Arctic aviation in 1929, an attempted 
round-trip to Europe across Greenland and Iceland in a Sikorsky amphibious 
aircraft.[15] However the aircraft was destroyed by ice on July 15, 1929, 
near Ungava Bay at the tip of Labrador, Canada. The crew were rescued by 
the Canadian science ship CSS Acadia.[16] From 1940 to 1943 the paper supplemented 
its comic strip offerings with The Chicago Tribune Comic Book responding 
to the new success of comic books mirroring the near simultaneous launch 
of the more successful and longer lasting The Spirit Section which was 
also an attempt by newspapers to compete with the new medium.[17] During 
the McCormick years, the Tribune was a champion of modified spelling (such 
as spelling "although" as "altho").[18][19] McCormick, a vigorous campaigner 
for the Republican Party, died in 1955, just four days before Democratic 
boss Richard J. Daley was elected mayor for the first time. One of the 
great scoops in Tribune history came when it obtained the text of the Treaty 
of Versailles in June 1919. Another was its revelation of United States 
war plans on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Tribune's June 7, 
1942, front page announcement that America had broken Japan's naval code 
was actually the potential revelation of a closely guarded military secret 
by the paper.[20] The story revealing that Americans broke the enemy naval 
codes was not cleared by censors, and had US President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
so enraged that he considered shutting down the Tribune.[21][22][23][24] 
The paper is also well known for a mistake it made during the 1948 presidential 
election. At that time, much of its composing room staff was on strike, 
and early returns led the paper to believe that the Republican candidate 
Thomas Dewey would win. An early edition of the next day's paper carried 
the headline "Dewey Defeats Truman", turning the paper into a collector's 
item when it turned out that Harry S. Truman won and proudly brandished 
it in a famous picture taken at St. Louis Union Station. Beneath the headline 
was a false article, written by Arthur Sears Henning, which purported to 
describe West Coast results even before East Coast election returns were 
available. The Tribune's legendary sports editor Arch Ward created the 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1933 as part of the city's Century 
of Progress exposition. The Tribune's reputation for innovation extended 
to radio—it bought an early station, WDAP, in 1924 and renamed it WGN (AM), 
the station call letters standing for the paper's self-description as the 
"World's Greatest Newspaper'. WGN Television was launched April 5, 1948. 
These broadcast stations remain Tribune properties to this day and are 
among the oldest newspaper/broadcasting cross-ownerships in the country. 
(The Tribune's East Coast sibling, the New York Daily News, later established 
WPIX television and radio.) Although under Colonel McCormick, the Tribune 
for years refused to participate in the Pulitzer Prize competition, it 
has won 25 of the awards over the years, including many for editorial writing.[25][26][27] 
The Tribune won its first post-McCormick Pulitzer in 1961, when Carey Orr 
won the award for editorial cartooning. Reporter George Bliss won a Pulitzer 
the following year for reporting, and reporter Bill Jones another in 1971 
for reporting.[25] A reporting team won the award in 1973, followed by 
reporter William Mullen and photographer Ovie Carter, who won a Pulitzer 
for international reporting in 1975. A local reporting team won the award 
in 1976, and architecture critic Paul Gapp won a Pulitzer in 1979.[25] 
In 1969, under the leadership of publisher Harold Grumhaus and editor Clayton 
Kirkpatrick (1915–2004), the Tribune's past conservative partisanship became 
history. Though the paper retained its Republican and conservative perspective 
in its editorials, it began to publish perspectives in wider commentary 
that represented a spectrum of diverse opinions, while its news reporting 
no longer had the conservative slant it had in the McCormick years. In 
early 1974, in a major feat of journalism, the Tribune published the complete 
246,000-word text of the Watergate tapes in a 44-page supplement that hit 
the streets a mere 24 hours after the transcripts' release by the Nixon 
White House. Not only was the Tribune the first newspaper to publish the 
transcripts, but it beat the Government Printing Office's own published 
version, and made headlines doing so.[clarification needed] A week later, 
after studying the transcripts, the paper's editorial board observed that 
"the high dedication to grand principles that Americans have a right to 
expect from a President is missing from the transcript record." The Tribune's 
editors concluded that "nobody of sound mind can read [the transcripts] 
and continue to think that Mr. Nixon has upheld the standards and dignity 
of the Presidency," and called for Nixon's resignation. The Tribune call 
for Nixon to resign made news, reflecting not only the change in the type 
of conservatism practiced by the paper, but as a watershed event in terms 
of Nixon's hopes for survival in office. The White House reportedly saw 
the Tribune's editorial as a loss of a long-time supporter and as a blow 
to Nixon's hopes to weather the scandal. On December 7, 1975, Kirkpatrick 
announced in a column on the editorial page that Rick Soll, a "young and 
talented columnist" for the paper whose work had "won a following among 
many Tribune readers over the last two years" resigned from the paper after 
acknowledging that a column he wrote that appeared on November 23, 1975, 
contained verbatim passages that another columnist wrote in 1967 and later 
published in a collection. Kirkpatrick did not identify the columnist. 
The passages in question, Kirkpatrick wrote, had been in a notebook where 
Soll had copied words, phrases and bits of conversation that he had wished 
to remember. Although the paper initially suspended Soll for a month without 
pay, Kirkpatrick noted that further evidence then came out that another 
column contained information that Soll knew was false. At that point, Kirkpatrick 
wrote, Tribune editors decided to accept the resignation that Soll offered 
when the investigation began.[28] Soll went on to marry Chicago newspaper 
(and future TV) reporter Pam Zekman and eventually work for the short-lived 
Chicago Times magazine in the late 1980s. In January 1977, Tribune columnist 
Will Leonard died at age 64.[29] In March 1978, the Tribune announced that 
it hired columnist Bob Greene away from the Chicago Sun-Times.[30] Kirkpatrick 
stepped down as editor in 1979 and was succeeded by Maxwell McCrohon (1928–2004), 
who served as editor until 1981, when he was transitioned to a corporate 
position. McCrohon held the corporate position until 1983, when he left 
to become editor in chief of the United Press International. James Squires 
served as the paper's editor from July 1981 until December 1989. Jack Fuller 
served as the Tribune's editor from 1989 until 1993, when he became the 
president and chief executive officer of the Chicago Tribune. Howard Tyner 
served as the Tribune's editor from 1993 until 2001, when he was promoted 
to vice president/editorial for Tribune Publishing. The Tribune won 11 
Pulitzer prizes during the 1980s and 1990s.[25] Editorial cartoonist Dick 
Locher won the award in 1983, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly won 
one in 1985. Then, future editor Jack Fuller won a Pulitzer for editorial 
writing in 1986. In 1987, reporters Jeff Lyon and Peter Gorner won a Pulitzer 
for explanatory reporting, and in 1988, Dean Baquet, William Gaines and 
Ann Marie Lipinski won a Pulitzer for investigative reporting. In 1989, 
Lois Wille won a Pulitzer for editorial writing and Clarence Page snagged 
the award for commentary. In 1994, Ron Kotulak won a Pulitzer for explanatory 
journalism, while R. Bruce Dold won it for editorial writing. In 1998, 
reporter Paul Salopek won a Pulitzer for explanatory writing, and in 1999, 
architecture critic Blair Kamin won it for criticism.[25] In September 
1981, baseball writer Jerome Holtzman was hired by the Tribune after a 
38-year career at the Sun-Times. In November 1982, Tribune managing editor 
William H. "Bill" Jones, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1971, died at 
age 43 of cardiac arrest as a result of complications from a long battle 
with leukemia.[31] In May 1983, Tribune columnist Aaron Gold died at age 
45 of complications from leukemia.[32] Gold had coauthored the Tribune's 
"Inc." column with Michael Sneed and prior to that had written the paper's 
"Tower Ticker" column. The Tribune scored a coup in 1984 when it hired 
popular columnist Mike Royko away from the rival Sun-Times.[33] In 1986, 
the Tribune announced that celebrated film critic Gene Siskel, the Tribune's 
best-known writer, was no longer the paper's film critic, and that his 
position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film 
critic to that of a free-lance contract writer who was to write about the 
film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews 
for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel 
and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift 
the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as "At the 
Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert" and later known as "Siskel & Ebert 
& The Movies"—from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company's Buena 
Vista Television unit. "He has done a great job for us," editor James Squires 
said at the time. "It's a question of how much a person can do physically. 
We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always 
tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that 
you can't do that." Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, 
but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's Tribune bosses for punishing Siskel 
for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment.[34] 
Siskel remained in that free-lance position until his death in 1999. He 
was replaced as film critic in 1986 by Dave Kehr.[35] In August 1988, Chicago 
Tribune reporter Michael Coakley died at age 41 of complications from AIDS.[36] 
In November 1992, Tribune associate subject editor Searle "Ed" Hawley was 
arrested by Chicago police and charged with seven counts of aggravated 
criminal sexual abuse for allegedly having sex with three juveniles in 
his home in Evanston, Illinois.[37] Hawley formally resigned from the paper 
in early 1993, and pleaded guilty in April 1993. He was sentenced to 3 years 
in prison.[38] In an unusual move at that time, the Tribune in October 
1993 fired its longtime military-affairs writer, retired-Marine David Evans, 
with the public position that the post of military affairs was being dropped 
in favor of having a national security writer.[39] In December 1993, the 
Tribune's longtime Washington, D.C. bureau chief, Nicholas Horrock, was 
removed from his post after he chose not to attend a meeting that editor 
Howard Tyner requested of him in Chicago.[40] Horrock, who shortly thereafter 
left the paper, was replaced by James Warren, who attracted new attention 
to the Tribune's D.C. bureau through his continued attacks on celebrity 
broadcast journalists in Washington. Also in December 1993, the Tribune 
hired Margaret Holt from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel as its assistant 
managing editor for sports, making her the first female to head a sports 
department at any of the nation's 10 largest newspapers.[41] In mid-1995, 
Holt was replaced as sports editor by Tim Franklin and shifted to a newly 
created job, customer service editor.[42] In 1994, reporter Brenda You 
was fired by the Tribune after free-lancing for supermarket tabloid newspapers 
and lending them photographs from the Tribune's photo library.[30] You 
later worked for the National Enquirer and as a producer for The Jerry 
Springer Show before committing suicide in November 2005.[43] In April 
1994, the Tribune's new television critic, Ken Parish Perkins, wrote an 
article about then-WFLD morning news anchor Bob Sirott in which Perkins 
quoted Sirott as making a statement that Sirott later denied making. Sirott 
criticized Perkins on the air, and the Tribune later printed a correction 
acknowledging that Sirott had never made that statement.[44] Eight months 
later, Perkins stepped down as TV critic, and he left the paper shortly 
thereafter.[45] In December 1995, the alternative newsweekly Newcity published 
a first-person article by the pseudonymous Clara Hamon (a name mentioned 
in the play The Front Page) but quickly identified by Tribune reporters 
as that of former Tribune reporter Mary Hill that heavily criticized the 
paper's one-year residency program. The program brought young journalists 
in and out of the paper for one-year stints, seldom resulting in a full-time 
job. Hill, who wrote for the paper from 1992 until 1993, acknowledged to 
the Chicago Reader that she had written the diatribe originally for the 
Internet, and that the piece eventually was edited for Newcity.[46] In 
1997, the Tribune celebrated its 150th anniversary in part by tapping longtime 
reporter Stevenson Swanson to edit the book Chicago Days: 150 Defining 
Moments in the Life of a Great City. On April 29, 1997, popular columnist 
Mike Royko died of a brain aneurysm. On September 2, 1997, the Tribune 
promoted longtime City Hall reporter John Kass to take Royko's place as 
the paper's principal Page Two news columnist.[47] On June 1, 1997, the 
Tribune published what ended up becoming a very popular column by Mary 
Schmich called "Advice, like youth, probably just wasted on the young", 
otherwise known as "Wear Sunscreen" or the "Sunscreen Speech." The most 
popular and well-known form of the essay is the successful music single 
released in 1999, accredited to Baz Luhrmann. In 1998, reporter Jerry Thomas 
was fired by the Tribune after he wrote a cover article on boxing promoter 
Don King for Emerge magazine at the same time that he was writing a cover 
article on King for the Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine. The paper decided 
to fire Thomas—and suspend his photographer on the Emerge story, Pulitzer 
Prize-winning Tribune photographer Ovie Carter for a month—because Thomas 
did not tell the Tribune about his outside work and also because the Emerge 
story wound up appearing in print first.[48] On June 6, 1999, the Tribune 
published a first-person travel article from freelance writer Gaby Plattner 
that described a supposed incident in which a pilot for Air Zimbabwe who 
was flying without a copilot inadvertently locked himself out of his cockpit 
while the plane was flying on autopilot and as a result needed to use a 
large ax to chop a hole in the cockpit door.[49] An airline representative 
wrote a lengthy letter to the paper calling the account "totally untrue, 
unprofessional and damaging to our airline" and explaining that Air Zimbabwe 
does not keep axes on its aircraft and never flies without a full crew,[50] 
and the paper was forced to print a correction stating that Plattner "now 
says that she passed along a story she had heard as something she had experienced."[49] 
The Tribune has been a leader on the Internet, acquiring 10 percent of 
America Online in the early 1990s, then launching such web sites as Chicagotribune.com 
(1995), Metromix.com (1996), ChicagoSports.com (1999), ChicagoBreakingNews.com 
(2008), and ChicagoNow.com (2009). In 2002, the paper launched a tabloid 
edition targeted at 18- to 34-year-olds known as RedEye. Ann Marie Lipinski 
was the paper's editor from February 2001 until stepping down on July 17, 
2008. Gerould W. Kern was named the paper's editor in July 2008.[51] In 
early August 2008, managing editor for news Hanke Gratteau resigned, and 
several weeks later, managing editor for features James Warren resigned 
as well.[52] Both were replaced by Jane Hirt, who previously had been the 
editor of the Tribune's RedEye tabloid.[52] In June 2000, Times Mirror 
merged with Tribune Company making The Baltimore Sun and its community 
papers Baltimore Sun Media Group / Patuxent Publishing a subsidiary of 
Tribune.[53][54] Tribune's Baltimore Community papers include Arbutus Times, 
Baltimore Messenger, Catonsville Times, Columbia Flier, Howard County Times, 
The Jeffersonian, Laurel Leader, Lifetimes, North County News, Northeast 
Booster, Northeast Reporter, Owings Mills Times, and Towson Times. The 
Howard County Times was named 2010 Newspaper of the Year by the Suburban 
Newspaper Association.[55] The Towson Times expands coverage beyond the 
Towson area and includes Baltimore County government and politics.[56][57] 
The Tribune won five Pulitzer prizes in the first decade of the 21st century.[25] 
Salopek won his second Pulitzer for the Tribune in 2001 for international 
reporting, and that same year an explanatory reporting team—lead writers 
of which were Louise Kiernan, Jon Hilkevitch, Laurie Cohen, Robert Manor, 
Andrew Martin, John Schmeltzer, Alex Rodriguez and Andrew Zajac—won the 
honor for a profile of the chaotic U.S. air traffic system.[25][58] In 
2003, editorial writer Cornelia Grumman snagged the award for editorial 
writing.[25] In 2005, Julia Keller won a Pulitzer for feature reporting 
on a tornado that struck Utica, Illinois.[25] And, in 2008, an investigative 
reporting team including Patricia Callahan, Maurice Possley, Sam Roe, Ted 
Gregory, Michael Oneal and Evan Osnos won the Pulitzer for its series about 
faulty government regulation of defective toys, cribs and car seats.[25][59] 
In late 2001, sports columnist Michael Holley announced he was leaving 
the Tribune after just two months because he was homesick.[60] He ultimately 
returned to the Boston Globe, where he had been working immediately before 
the Tribune had hired him.[60] On September 15, 2002, Lipinski wrote a 
terse, page-one note informing readers that the paper's longtime columnist, 
Bob Greene, resigned effective immediately after acknowledging "engaging 
in inappropriate sexual conduct some years ago with a girl in her late 
teens whom he met in connection with his newspaper column." The conduct 
later was revealed to have occurred in 1988 with a woman who was of the 
age of consent in Illinois. "Greene's behavior was a serious violation 
of Tribune ethics and standards for its journalists," Lipinski wrote. "We 
deeply regret the conduct, its effect on the young woman and the impact 
this disclosure has on the trust our readers placed in Greene and this 
newspaper."[61][62] In January 2003, Mike Downey, formerly of the Los Angeles 
Times, was hired as new Tribune sports columnist. He and colleague Rick 
Morrissey would write the In the Wake of the News Column originated by 
Ring Lardner. In March 2004, the Tribune announced that free-lance reporter 
Uli Schmetzer, who retired from the Tribune in 2002 after 16 years as a 
foreign correspondent, had fabricated the name and occupation of a person 
he had quoted in a story. The paper terminated Schmetzer as a contract 
reporter and began a review of the 300 stories that Schmetzer had written 
over the prior three years.[63] In May 2004, the Tribune revealed that 
free-lance reporter Mark Falanga was unable to verify some facts that he 
inserted in a lifestyle-related column that ran on April 18, 2004, about 
an expensive lunch at a Chicago restaurant—namely, that the restaurant 
charged $15 for a bottle of water and $35 for a pasta entree. "Upon questioning, 
the freelance writer indicated the column was based on an amalgam of three 
restaurants and could not verify the prices," the paper noted.[64][65] 
After the correction, the Tribune stopped using Falanga. In October 2004, 
Tribune editor Ann Marie Lipinski at the last minute spiked a story written 
for the paper's WomanNews section by free-lance reporter Lisa Bertagnoli 
titled "You c_nt say that (or can you?)," about a noted vulgarism.[66] 
The paper ordered every spare body to go to the Tribune's printing plant 
to pull already-printed WomanNews sections containing the story from the 
Wednesday, October 27, 2004, package of preprinted sections in the Tribune.[66] 
In September 2008, the Tribune considered hiring controversial sports columnist 
Jay Mariotti, shortly after his abrupt resignation from Tribune archrival 
Chicago Sun-Times.[67] Discussions ultimately ended, however, after the 
Sun-Times threatened to sue for violating Mariotti's noncompete agreement, 
which was to run until August 2009.[67] Sports columnist Rick Morrissey 
defected to the Sun-Times in December 2009. n April 2009, 55 Tribune reporters 
and editors signed their names to an e-mail sent to Kern and managing editor 
Jane Hirt, questioning why the newspaper's marketing department had solicited 
subscribers' opinions on stories before they were published, and suggesting 
that the practice raised ethical questions as well as legal and competitive 
issues. Reporters declined to speak on the record to the Associated Press 
about their issues. "We'll let the e-mail speak for itself," reporter John 
Chase told the AP. In the wake of the controversy, Kern abruptly discontinued 
the effort, which he described as "a brief market research project."[68] 
In the first decade of the 21st century, the Tribune had multiple rounds 
of reductions of staff through layoffs and buyouts as it has coped with 
the industrywide declines in advertising revenues: The Tribune broke the 
story on Friday, May 29, 2009, that several students had been admitted 
to the University of Illinois based upon connections or recommendations 
by the school's Board of Trustees, Chicago politicians, and members of 
the Rod Blagojevich administration. Initially denying the existence of 
a so-called "Category I" admissions program, university President B. Joseph 
"Joe" White and Chancellor Richard Herman later admitted that there were 
instances of preferential treatment. Although they claimed the list was 
short and their role was minor, the Tribune, in particular, revealed emails 
through a FOIA finding that White had received a recommendation for a relative 
of convicted fundraiser Tony Rezko to be admitted. The Tribune also later 
posted emails from Herman pushing for underqualified students to be accepted.[83][84] 
The Tribune has since filed suit against the university administration 
under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the names of students benefited 
by administrative clout and impropriety. On February 8, 2010, the Chicago 
Tribune shrank its newspaper's width by an inch. They said that the new 
format was becoming the industry standard and that there would be minimal 
content changes. In July 2011, the Chicago Tribune underwent its first 
round of layoffs of editorial employees in more than two years, letting 
go about 20 editors and reporters.[85] Among those let go were DuPage County 
reporter Art Barnum, Editorial Board member Pat Widder and photographer 
Dave Pierini.[85][86] On March 15, 2012, the Tribune laid off 15 editorial 
staffers, including security guard Wendell Smothers (Smothers then died 
on November 12, 2012).[87][88] At the same time, the paper gave buyouts 
to six editorial staffers, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter William 
Mullen, Barbara Mahany and Nancy Reese.[89] In June 2012, the Tribune's 
Pulitzer Prize-winning cultural critic Julia Keller left the paper to join 
the faculty of Ohio University and to pursue a career as a novelist.[90] 
In September 2012, Tribune education reporter Joel Hood resigned from the 
paper to become a real estate broker and City Hall reporter Kristen Mack 
left the paper to become press secretary for Cook County Board President 
Toni Preckwinkle.[91] In September 2012, the Tribune hired Pulitzer Prize-winning 
photographer John J. Kim from the Chicago Sun-Times.[92] In October 2012, 
the Tribune's science and medicine reporter, Trine Tsouderos, quit to join 
a public relations firm.[93] Also in October 2012, the Tribune announced 
plans to create a pay wall for its website, offering digital-only subscriptions 
at $14.99 per month, starting on November 1, 2012. Seven-day print subscribers 
would continue to have unlimited online access at no additional charge.[94] 
In late February 2013, the Tribune agreed to pay a total of $660,000 to 
settle a class-action lawsuit that had been filed against the paper by 
46 current and former reporters of its TribLocal local-news reporting group 
over unpaid overtime wages.[95] The suit had been filed in federal court 
on behalf of Carolyn Rusin, who had been a TribLocal staff reporter from 
July 2010 until October 2011.[95] The paper's TribLocal unit had been formed 
in 2007 and uses staff reporters, freelance writers and user-generated 
content to produce hyperlocal Chicago-area community news.[95] On June 
12, 2013, the Boston Marathon bombings moving tribute was posted again, 
which showed the words "We are Chicago" above the names of Boston sports 
teams.[96] On the graphic on June 12, the word "Bruins" was ripped off 
and the comment was added, "Yeah, not right now we're not", in a reference 
to the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, which play the Chicago Blackhawks against 
the Boston Bruins.[96] Gerould Kern tweeted later that the Tribune "still 
supports [Boston] after all you've been through. We regret any offense. 
Now let's play hockey."[96] On November 20, 2013, the Tribune laid off 
another 12 or so editorial staffers.[97] On April 6, 2014, the Tribune 
increased the newsstand price of its Sunday/Thanksgiving Day paper by 50 
percent to $2.99 for a single copy. The newsrack price increased $0.75, 
or 42.9%, to $2.50.[98] On January 28, 2015, metropolitan editor Peter 
Kendall was named managing editor, replacing Jane Hirt, who had resigned 
several months earlier. Colin McMahon was named associate editor [99] Bruce 
Dold is now the Editor. In a 2007 statement of principles published in 
the Tribune's print and online editions, the paper's editorial board described 
the newspaper's philosophy, from which is excerpted the following: The 
Tribune has remained economically conservative, being widely skeptical 
of increasing the minimum wage and entitlement spending. Although the Tribune 
criticized the Bush administration's record on civil liberties, the environment, 
and many aspects of its foreign policy, it continued to support his presidency 
while taking Democrats, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and Cook 
County Board President Todd Stroger, to task and calling for their removal 
from office. In 2004, the Tribune endorsed President George W. Bush for 
re-election, a decision consistent with its longstanding support for the 
Republican Party. In 2008, it endorsed Democratic candidate and Illinois 
junior U.S. Senator Barack Obama—the first time that it had ever endorsed 
a Democrat for president.[100]The Tribune endorsed Obama once again for 
reelection in 2012.[101] The Tribune has previously backed independent 
candidates. In 1872, it supported Horace Greeley, a former Republican Party 
newspaper editor,[102] and in 1912 the paper endorsed Theodore Roosevelt, 
who ran on the Progressive Party slate against Republican President William 
Howard Taft. Over the years, the Tribune has endorsed Democrats for lesser 
offices, including recent endorsements of Bill Foster, Barack Obama for 
the Senate and Democrat Melissa Bean, who defeated Philip Crane, the House 
of Representatives' longest-serving Republican. Though the Tribune endorsed 
George Ryan in the 1998 Illinois gubernatorial race, the paper subsequently 
investigated and reported on the scandals surrounding Ryan during his preceding 
years as Secretary of State. Ryan declined to run for re-election in 2002 
and was subsequently indicted, convicted and imprisoned as a result of 
the scandal. In 2016, the Tribune endorsed the Libertarian Party candidate, 
former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson for president, over Republican 
Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton.[103] The Chicago Tribune is 
the founding business unit of Tribune Company (since renamed Tribune Media 
Company), which included many newspapers and television stations around 
the country. In Chicago, Tribune Media owns the WGN radio station (720 AM) 
and WGN-TV (Channel 9). Tribune Company also owned the Los Angeles Times—which 
displaced the Tribune as the company's largest property—and the Chicago 
Cubs baseball team. The Cubs were sold in 2009, the newspapers spun off 
in 2014. Tribune Company owned the New York Daily News from its 1919 founding 
until its 1991 sale to British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell. The founder 
of the News, Capt. Joseph Medill Patterson, was a grandson of Joseph Medill 
and a cousin of Tribune editor Robert McCormick. Both Patterson and McCormick 
were enthusiasts of simplified spelling, another hallmark of their papers 
for many years. In 2008, the Tribune Company sold the Long Island newspaper 
Newsday—founded in 1940 by Patterson's daughter (and Medill's great-granddaughter), 
Alicia Patterson—to Long Island cable TV company Cablevision. Since 1925, 
the Chicago Tribune has been housed in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan 
Avenue on the Magnificent Mile. The building is neo-Gothic in style, and 
the design was the winner of an international competition hosted by the 
Tribune. The Tribune Tower is owned by Tribune Media. Tribune Tower once 
housed the physical storefront of the Chicago Tribune Store, but more recently 
the store has switched to an online presence.[104] The September 2008 redesign 
(discussed here[105] on the Tribune's web site) was controversial and is 
largely regarded as an effort in cost-cutting.[106] Since then the newspaper 
has returned to a more toned down style. The style is more a mix of the 
old style and a new modern style. In December 2007, the Tribune Company 
was bought out by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell in an $8.2 billion 
deal. Zell was the company's new chairman.[107] A year after going private, 
following a $124 million third-quarter loss, the Tribune Company filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 8, 2008. The company made 
its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 
citing a debt of $13 billion and assets of $7.6 billion.[108] As part of 
its bankruptcy plan, owner Sam Zell intended to sell the Cubs to reduce 
debt. This sale has become linked to the corruption charges leading to 
the December 9, 2008, arrest of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. 
Specifically, the ex-governor was accused of exploiting the paper's financial 
trouble in an effort to have several editors fired.[109] In the bankruptcy, 
unsecured bondholders of Tribune Co. essentially claimed that ordinary 
Tribune shareholders participated in a "fraudulent transfer" of wealth.[110] 
The law firm Brown Rudnick, representing the Aurelius group of junior creditors, 
filed fraudulent transfer claims and fraud claims against 33,000 to 35,000 
stockholders who bought Tribune stock.[111] Prolonged due to these claims 
against former officers, directors, and every former stockholder of the 
Chicago Tribune Company,[111][112] the Tribune's bankruptcy-related legal 
and professional fees of $500 million were more than twice the usual amount 
for that size of company.[113] The Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy 
in January, 2013, partially owned by private equity firms which had speculated 
on its distressed debt. The reorganized company's plan included selling 
off many of its assets.[113] Tribune Publishing, owning the Chicago Tribune, 
Los Angeles Times, and eight other newspapers, was spun off as a separate 
publicly traded company in August, 2014. The parent Tribune Company was 
renamed Tribune Media Company.[114] Tribune Publishing started life with 
a $350 million loan, $275 million of which was paid as a dividend to Tribune 
Media. The publishing company was also due to lease its office space from 
Tribune Media for $30 million per year through 2017.[114][115] Spinning 
off Tribune Publishing avoided the capital gains taxes that would accrue 
from selling those assets. The shares in Tribune Publishing were given 
tax-free to stakeholders in Tribune Media, the largest shareholder was 
Oaktree Capital Management with 18.5%.[115] Tribune Media, retaining the 
non-newspaper broadcasting, entertainment, real estate, and other investments, 
also sold off some of the non-newspaper properties.[114] The Tribune prices 
are: $1.99/$1.50 Daily, $2.99/$2.50 Sunday/Thanksgiving Day. The Tribune 
on weekdays was $1 until 2014, when it was raised to $1.50.[citation needed].
