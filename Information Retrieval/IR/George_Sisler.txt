As player As manager George Harold Sisler (March 24, 1893 – March 26, 1973), 
nicknamed "Gentleman George" and "Gorgeous George", was an American professional 
baseball player for 15 seasons, primarily as first baseman with the St. 
Louis Browns. From 1920 until 2004, Sisler held the Major League Baseball 
(MLB) record for most hits in a single season; it was broken by Ichiro 
Suzuki. Sisler's 1922 season — during which he batted .420, hit safely 
in a then-record 41 consecutive games, led the American League in hits 
(246), stolen bases (51), triples (18), and was probably the best fielding 
first baseman in the game — is considered by many historians to be among 
the best individual all-around single-season performances in baseball history.[1] 
After Sisler retired as a player, he worked as a major league scout and 
aide. He was on a team of scouts appointed by Branch Rickey to find black 
players for the Brooklyn Dodgers; the team's work resulted in the signing 
of Jackie Robinson. Sisler was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1939.[2] In 1999 editors at The Sporting News named him 33rd on their list 
of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players." Sisler was born in the unincorporated 
hamlet of Manchester (now part of the city of New Franklin, a suburb of 
Akron, Ohio[3]). His paternal ancestors were immigrants from Northern Germany 
in the middle of 19th century. When he was 14, Sisler moved to Akron to 
live with his older brother so that he could attend an accredited high 
school. When Sisler was a high school senior, his brother died of tuberculosis 
but Sisler was able to move in with a local family and finish school.[4] 
In 1911, Sisler signed a contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates to play minor 
league baseball in the Ohio–Pennsylvania League, but he never played in 
the league or earned any money.[5] He played college baseball for the University 
of Michigan. As a freshman, Sisler struck out 20 batters in seven innings 
during a 1912 game.[6] He lettered in baseball from 1913 to 1915.[7] At 
Michigan he played for coach Branch Rickey and he earned a degree in mechanical 
engineering.[5] After his graduation from Michigan, Sisler sought legal 
advice from Rickey about the status of his contract with Pittsburgh. The 
three-time Vanity Fair All-American had become highly sought-after by major 
league scouts. Rickey talked to Pittsburgh owner Barney Dreyfuss about 
releasing Sisler from the contract he had signed as a minor, but Dreyfuss 
maintained his claim to Sisler. Rickey wrote to the National Commission, 
baseball's governing body, who ruled that the contract was illegal. Rickey, 
now managing the St. Louis Browns, signed Sisler to a contract worth $7,400.[5] 
Sisler entered the major leagues as a pitcher for the Browns in 1915. He 
posted a career pitching record of 5–6 with a 2.35 earned run average in 
24 career mound appearances.[8] He defeated Walter Johnson twice in complete-game 
victories. In 1916, he moved to first base and finished the season with 
a batting average above .300 for the first of seven consecutive seasons. 
He also had 34 stolen bases that season; he stole at least 28 bases in 
every season through 1922.[8] In 1917, Sisler hit .353, registered 190 
hits and stole 37 bases. The next year he hit .341 and stole a league-leading 
45 bases.[8] He then enlisted in the army, joining several major league 
players in a Chemical Warfare Service unit commanded by Rickey. Sisler 
was preparing to go overseas when World War I ended that November.[9] In 
1920, Sisler played every inning of each game.[10] He stole 42 bases (second 
in the American League), collected a major league-leading 257 hits for 
an average of .407 and ended the season by hitting .442 in August and .448 
in September.[8] His batting average was the highest ever for a 600+ at-bat 
performance. In breaking Ty Cobb's 1911 record for hits in a single season, 
Sisler established a mark which stood until Ichiro Suzuki broke the record 
with 262 hits in 2004. (Suzuki, however, collected his hits over 161 games 
during the modern 162-game season as opposed to 154 in Sisler's era.) Sisler 
finished second in the AL in doubles and triples, as well as second to 
Babe Ruth in RBIs and home runs. Jim Barrero of the Los Angeles Times asserts 
that Sisler's record was largely overshadowed by Ruth's 54 home runs that 
season. "Of course, Ruth's obliteration of the home run record drew all 
the attention from fans and newspapermen, while Sisler's mark was pushed 
to the side and perhaps left unappreciated during what was a golden age 
of pure hitters", Barrero wrote.[10] As his popularity increased, Sisler 
drew comparisons to Cobb, Ruth and Tris Speaker. Sisler, however, was much 
more reserved than those three stars. A writer named Floyd Bell described 
Sisler as "modest, almost to a point of bashfulness, as far from egotism 
as a blushing debutante... Shift the conversation to Sisler himself and 
he becomes a clam."[11] In 1922, Sisler hit safely in 41 consecutive games 
– an American League record that stood until Joe DiMaggio broke it in 1941. 
His .420 batting average is the third-highest of the 20th century, surpassed 
only by Rogers Hornsby's .424 in 1924 and Nap Lajoie's .426 in 1901. He 
was chosen as the AL's Most Valuable Player that year,[8] the first year 
an official league award was given, as the Browns finished second to the 
New York Yankees. Sisler stole over 25 bases in every year from 1916 through 
1922, peaking with 51 the last year and leading the league three times; 
he also scored an AL-best 134 runs, and hit 18 triples for the third year 
in a row. A severe attack of sinusitis caused him double vision in 1923, 
forcing him to miss the entire season. He defied some predictions by returning 
in 1924 with a batting average over .300. Sisler later said, "I planned 
to get back in uniform for 1924. I just had to meet a ball with a good 
swing again, and then run. The doctors all said I'd never play again, but 
when you're fighting for something that actually keeps you alive – well, 
the human will is all you need."[5] Sisler never regained his previous 
level of play, though he continued to hit over .300 in six of his last 
seven seasons and led the AL in stolen bases for a fourth time in 1927.[8] 
In 1928, the Browns sold Sisler's contract to the Washington Senators, 
who in turn sold the contract to the Boston Braves in May. After batting 
.340, .326 and .309 in his three years in Boston, he ended his major league 
career with the Braves in 1930, then played in the minor leagues. He accumulated 
a .340 lifetime batting average over his 16 years in the majors. Sisler 
stole 375 bases during his career. He became one of the early entrants 
elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame when he was selected in 1939.[8] After 
his playing career, Sisler reunited with Rickey as a special assignment 
scout and front-office aide with the St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Dodgers 
and Pittsburgh Pirates. Sisler and Rickey worked with future Hall of Famer 
Duke Snider to teach the young Dodgers hitter to accurately judge the strike 
zone.[12] Sisler was part of a scouting corps that Rickey assigned to look 
for black players, though the scouts thought they were looking for players 
to fill an all-black baseball team separate from MLB. Sisler evaluated 
Jackie Robinson as a potential star second baseman, but he was concerned 
about whether Robinson had enough arm strength to play shortstop.[13] With 
the Pirates in 1961, Sisler had Roberto Clemente switch to a heavier bat. 
Clemente won the league batting title that season.[14] Sisler's sons Dick 
and Dave were also major league players in the 1950s. Sisler was a Dodgers 
scout in 1950 when his son Dick hit a game-winning home run against Brooklyn 
to clinch the pennant for the Phillies and eliminate the second-place Dodgers. 
When asked after the pennant winning game how he felt when his son beat 
his current team, the Dodgers, George replied, "I felt awful and terrific 
at the same time."[15] A passage in The Old Man and the Sea refers to Dick 
Sisler's long home run drives.[14] Another son, George Jr., served as a 
minor league executive and as the president of the International League. 
Sisler also spent some time as commissioner of the National Baseball Congress.[16] 
He died in Richmond Heights, Missouri, in 1973, while still employed as 
a scout for the Pirates. Outside of St. Louis' Busch Stadium, there is 
a statue honoring Sisler. He is also honored with a star on the St. Louis 
Walk of Fame.[17] In October 2004, Ichiro Suzuki broke Sisler's 84 years 
old hit record, collecting his 258th hit off of Texas Rangers pitcher Ryan 
Drese. Sisler's daughter Frances Sisler Drochelman and other of his family 
members were in attendance when the record was broken.[18] While in St. 
Louis for the 2009 All-Star game, Ichiro Suzuki visited Sisler's grave
