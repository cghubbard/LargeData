The 1989 Oakland Athletics season saw the A's finish in first place in 
the American League West division, with a record of 99 wins and 63 losses, 
seven games in front of the Kansas City Royals. It was their second consecutive 
AL West title, as well as the second straight year in which they finished 
with the best record in all of baseball. The team defeated the Toronto 
Blue Jays in five games in the ALCS, then swept their cross-Bay rivals, 
the San Francisco Giants, in an earthquake-marred World Series. [1] [2]
