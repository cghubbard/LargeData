Halsey Louis Hall (May 23, 1898 – December 30, 1977) was a sports reporter 
and announcer in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area from the 1920s to 1970s. 
The son of reporter Smith B. Hall and actress Mary Hall, he entered journalism 
in November 1919 after being discharged from the United States Navy. Hall 
worked for several newspapers in the Twin Cities area, including the Minneapolis 
Tribune, the Minneapolis Star, and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. He later 
did radio broadcasts for Minneapolis Millers and Minnesota Twins baseball 
and Minnesota Golden Gophers football. Hall originated "Holy cow!" as a 
home run call on WCCO radio long before Harry Caray used it. Hall's great-uncle, 
Harlan P. Hall, was a co-founder of the Pioneer Press. The Halsey Hall 
Chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research [SABR] located in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, maintains a biographical sketch of Halsey Hall
