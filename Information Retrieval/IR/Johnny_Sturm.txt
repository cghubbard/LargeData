John Peter Joseph Sturm (January 23, 1916 – October 8, 2004) was a Major 
League Baseball player. He played with the New York Yankees during the 
1941 season as their starting first baseman. Sturm was born in St. Louis, 
Missouri, in 1916. He attended Roosevelt High School in St. Louis and also 
played semi-pro baseball.[1] Sturm started his professional career in 1936 
in the New York Yankees organization. In 1939 and 1940, he played for the 
American Association's Kansas City Blues alongside the double play combination 
of Phil Rizzuto and Jerry Priddy.[2] The Blues won two league championships, 
and Sturm hit over .300 in both seasons. He joined the Yankees in 1941, 
replacing Babe Dahlgren at first base. Sturm sat on the bench early in 
the season but broke into the lineup after the other infielders – including 
Hall of Famers Rizzuto and Joe Gordon – got off to slow starts.[3] Sturm 
hit just .239 for the Yankees but still batted first in the lineup the 
rest of the way. He later claimed to have a back injury that year.[3] He 
did, however, hit .286 in the 1941 World Series; the Yankees defeated the 
Brooklyn Dodgers in five games. After the season, Sturm enlisted in the 
United States Army and served in World War II. He was out of professional 
baseball from 1942 to 1945 and lost the tip of his right index finger in 
a tractor accident.[1] In 1946, Sturm tried to come back to the major leagues 
but broke his wrist.[1] He played and managed in the minors for the rest 
of the decade, hitting .360 for the Joplin Miners in 1948.[4] He is also 
known as the man who first recommended Mickey Mantle to the Yankees.[5] 
Sturm retired as a player-manager in 1949. In later years, he was a scout 
for the Houston Colt .45s, Cincinnati Reds, and Boston Red Sox. He was 
elected into the Greater St. Louis Hall of Fame.[1] Sturm was married and
