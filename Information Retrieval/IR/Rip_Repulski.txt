Eldon John (Rip) Repulski (October 4, 1928 – February 10, 1993) was an 
outfielder in Major League Baseball. From 1953 through 1961, he played 
with the St. Louis Cardinals (1953–56), Philadelphia Phillies (1957–58), 
Los Angeles Dodgers (1959–60) and Boston Red Sox (1960–61). He batted and 
threw right-handed. He was born in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota. He married Mildred 
"Millie" M. Repulski on December 30th 1950. The couple had one child together, 
a daughter, named Nadine Sue Repulski. In a nine-season career, Repulski 
posted a .269 batting average with 106 home runs and 416 RBI in 928 games 
played. A fine defensive player at all outfield positions, Repulski became 
the regular center fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals in his 1953 rookie 
season. He appeared in a career-high 153 games and finished third in National 
League Rookie of the Year voting behind Jim Gilliam and Harvey Haddix. 
Repulski enjoyed his most productive seasons in 1954 and 1955. In 1954, 
he hit 19 home runs and posted career highs in batting average (.283), 
runs (99), RBI (79) and doubles (39). From June 13–25 he had a string of 
ten consecutive games in which he collected two or more hits, going 22-for-44 
(.500), half for extra bases. After that, he hit in six more consecutive 
games before going hitless. In 1955 Repulski posted career highs in home 
runs (23), walks (49), on-base percentage (.333), slugging average (.467), 
OPS+ (110), and batting runs (7.7). He earned an All-Star berth in 1956. 
Pinch-hitting for National League starting pitcher Bob Friend, he batted 
against Whitey Ford in the fourth inning and was retired on a foul pop 
fly to the catcher. At the end of the '56 season, he was sent to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the same trade that brought Del Ennis to St. Louis. Repulski 
hit 20 home runs for the Phillies in 1957. A year later, he was traded 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with two other players in exchange for 
second baseman Sparky Anderson. He appeared in the 1959 World Series with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. Traded by Los Angeles to the Boston Red Sox in 
the 1960 midseason, Repulski hit a grand slam at Fenway Park in his first 
American League at bat. He played his last major league season with the 
Red Sox in 1961. Repulski died in Sauk Rapids, Minnesota, at age of 64. 
He was survived by his wife, Millie, daughter, Nadine “Deedee” (Gary) Mueller; 
granddaughters, Julie (Kelly) Renken, Sara Mueller, Sadie Mueller; great 
grandchild, Hannah Renken; brother and sister-in-law, Bill and Linda Repulski.
