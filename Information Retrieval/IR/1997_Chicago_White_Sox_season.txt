The 1997 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox's 98th season. They 
finished with a record 80-81, good enough for 2nd place in the American 
League Central, 6 games behind the 1st place Cleveland Indians. In the 
winter of 1996, Belle signed a 5-year, $55 million deal with the Chicago 
White Sox as a free agent. This contract made him the highest paid player 
in baseball for a brief period. Belle enjoyed two great seasons in Chicago, 
including a career-high 27-game hitting streak in May 1997. Belle came 
close to having another 50/50 season in 1998, with 49 home runs and 48 
doubles. Additionally, when Cal Ripken ended his record consecutive game 
streak in September 1998, it was Belle who took over as the major leagues' 
active leader in the category. Belle's White Sox contract had an unusual 
clause allowing him to demand that he would remain one of the three highest 
paid players in baseball. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 
[12] [13] [14] May 18, 1997: Tony Phillips was traded by the Chicago White 
Sox with Chad Kreuter to the Anaheim Angels for Chuck McElroy and Jorge 
FÃ¡bregas.[5] The White Flag Trade was a trade made in 1997. On July 31, 
1997, the Chicago White Sox traded three major players to the San Francisco 
Giants for six minor leaguers. At the time, the trade was maligned by the 
vast majority of White Sox fans as Jerry Reinsdorf giving up on the team, 
as they were only 3.5 games behind the Cleveland Indians for the American 
League Central Division lead. In 2000, however, the White Sox won the Central 
Division title, receiving large contributions from two of the players received 
in this trade. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: G = Games played;
