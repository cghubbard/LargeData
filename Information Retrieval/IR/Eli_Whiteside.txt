Dustin Eli Whiteside (born October 22, 1979) is an American former professional 
baseball catcher. He stands 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall, weighs 220 pounds 
(100 kg). He batted and threw right-handed. He played in Major League Baseball 
for the Baltimore Orioles, San Francisco Giants, and Chicago Cubs. Whiteside 
attended Delta State University before being drafted in the sixth round 
of the Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. He played 
in their organization through 2007, though he only played nine games in 
the major leagues with the Orioles, all coming in 2005. He signed with 
the Minnesota Twins in 2008 but was released after playing for their Triple-A 
team for a month. The San Francisco Giants then signed him, assigning him 
to the minor leagues. He was called up to be their backup catcher in May 
2009, and he caught Jonathan Sánchez's no-hitter on July 10. In 2010, he 
remained the backup catcher and was on the Giants' roster when they won 
the World Series, despite not playing any playoff games. After an injury 
to Buster Posey in May 2011, Whiteside split time catching with Chris Stewart 
for the rest of the year. He lost the role of backup to Héctor Sánchez 
in 2012 and appeared in just 12 games for the Giants during their second 
World Series-winning season in three years. Following 2012, Whiteside was 
claimed off waivers multiple times by different clubs before finally winding 
up with the Texas Rangers, who assigned him to their Triple-A team in 2013. 
In 2014, he competed for a spot on the Cubs' roster but was beaten out 
by John Baker and sent to the minors. In early 2015, Whiteside decided 
to retire and currently serves as a coach on the Giants. Whiteside was 
born on October 22, 1979, in New Albany, Mississippi. He was raised on 
an 80-acre farm that belonged to his grandfather. Whiteside attended W. 
P. Daniel High School, where he played both baseball and soccer before 
graduation in 1998. He then spent three years at Delta State University, 
majoring in business.[1] At Delta State, he was an All-American, an All-Gulf 
South Conference, and an All-Region player all three years with the baseball 
team.[2] After his junior year in 2001, the Baltimore Orioles drafted Whiteside 
in the sixth round of the Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft.[3] Whiteside 
began his minor league career in 2001 with the Single-A Delmarva Shorebirds 
of the South Atlantic League. In 61 games (212 at bats), he batted .250 
with 53 hits, seven home runs, and 28 runs batted in (RBI).[4] He finished 
second on the club in home runs and had a caught stealing percentage of 
41%.[1] Next season, he played for both the Single-A advanced Frederick 
Keys of the Carolina League and the Double-A Bowie Baysox of the Eastern 
League. He spent most of the season with Frederick, batting .259 with 89 
hits, eight home runs, and 42 RBI in 80 games (313 at bats). In 27 games 
(99 at bats) with Bowie, he hit .263 with 26 hits, two home runs, and 11 
RBI. His combined totals for the two leagues were 107 hits, 10 home runs, 
and 53 RBI in 107 games (412 at bats).[4] Outside of a rehab assignment, 
Whiteside spent all of 2003 with Bowie. In 81 games (265 at bats), he batted 
.204 with 54 hits, one home run, and 23 RBI. Defensively, he had a .989 
fielding percentage and threw out 37% of baserunners. In 2004, Whiteside 
again played with Bowie.[4] He had two-home-run games against the Akron 
Aeros on May 17 and the Erie SeaWolves on July 28, finishing fourth in 
the Orioles' organization on the season with 18 home runs. He batted .279 
before the Eastern League All-Star break but hit just .206 afterwards.[1] 
In 90 games (297 at bats), he hit .253 with 75 hits. Defensively, he posted 
a .986 fielding percentage.[4] He batted .310 in away games as opposed 
to .187 in home games. Following the season, he played for the Peoria Javelinas 
of the Arizona Fall League, batting .329 with 20 RBI in 18 games.[1] Whiteside 
moved up to the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx of the International League in 2005, 
and the Orioles signed veteran catcher Sal Fasano to mentor him.[4][5] 
On July 4, Whiteside was called up by the Orioles after Gerónimo Gil was 
placed on the disabled list.[6] He made his major league debut the next 
day, entering as a defensive replacement for Fasano in a 12–3 loss to the 
New York Yankees.[7] Four days later, making his first major league start, 
he got his first hit, an RBI single against Scott Cassidy in a 9–1 victory 
over the Boston Red Sox.[8] He appeared in six games and committed two 
throwing errors, one of which was important. On July 19, he made a wild 
throw to second base on a stolen base attempt that put Joe Mauer in position 
to score the tying run from third on a wild pitch in a 4–3 loss to the 
Minnesota Twins.[9] Whiteside was sent back to Ottawa on July 25 when Javy 
López came off the disabled list.[10] In 95 games (317 at bats) with Ottawa, 
Whiteside hit .233 with 74 hits, four home runs, and 27 RBI while posting 
a caught stealing percentage of 40%.[4] He was also called up in September, 
appearing in three more games. In nine games (12 at bats) with the Orioles, 
Whiteside had three hits and one RBI.[1] Whiteside was considered a "long 
shot" to make the Orioles' roster in 2006, but he remained in spring training 
with the Orioles until they made their final cuts on April 1 and sent him 
to Ottawa.[11][12] On May 21, Whiteside had four RBI in a game against 
the Rochester Red Wings, and he had back-to-back three-hit games against 
the Norfolk Tides from July 23 through 24.[1] In 92 games (315 at bats) 
with Ottawa in 2006, Whiteside batted .244 with 77 hits, 11 home runs, 
and 47 RBI.[4] His batting average was .281 at home compared to .201 on 
the road.[1] In 2007, Whiteside attended spring training but was reassigned 
to the minors on March 27, coinciding with the Orioles' acquisition of 
Alberto Castillo.[13] Whiteside began the season with the Orioles' Triple-A 
affiliate, which was now the Norfolk Tides, but after he batted .180 in 
18 games he was reassigned to Bowie on May 11. He spent time on the disabled 
list from June 18 through July 12 with a fractured right cheekbone. Upon 
returning, he had a seven-game hitting streak, but he was lost for the 
season on August 6 after suffering a concussion.[1] In 42 games (141 at 
bats) with Bowie, Whiteside hit .291 with 41 hits, four home runs, and 
30 RBI.[4] After 2007, he filed for free agency, having played in only 
nine major league games during his seven years with the Orioles.[14] On 
November 24, 2007, Whiteside signed a contract with the Minnesota Twins 
for the 2008 season. He played in eight games with the Rochester Red Wings 
of the International League, batting .167 before getting released on April 
30 when Ryan Jorgensen returned from serving a suspension for performance-enhancing 
drugs.[15] Five days after getting released by the Twins, the San Francisco 
Giants signed Whiteside.[14] He spent the rest of the year with the Triple-A 
Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League. In 49 games, the most by 
any catcher with Fresno in 2008, Whiteside batted .238 with 36 hits, two 
home runs, and 22 RBI.[16] He had a .986 fielding percentage but only threw 
out seven percent of attempted base-stealers. In 57 games (175 at bats) 
between Rochester and Fresno, he hit .229 with 40 hits, three home runs, 
and 23 RBI.[4] The next season, Whiteside started the year at Fresno again, 
batting .241 with 28 hits, six home runs, and 24 RBI in 34 games (116 at 
bats).[4] However, after an elbow injury prevented Pablo Sandoval from 
catching, the Giants called up Whiteside to be the backup catcher for Bengie 
Molina on May 24, 2009.[17] The same day, he played his first major league 
game in four years (and his first for a National League team). He finished 
the game with a hit and an RBI in three at-bats.[18] Matt Cain said of 
Whiteside, "He's been great. He's a guy who definitely takes advantage 
of his days in between, when he's not catching, and asking what guys threw 
in situations and what the pitches were, so he isn't thrown into the fire 
the days he's starting. Even if he doesn't see a team, he's still figuring 
out how guys got them out. He's definitely always learning."[17] On July 
10, 2009, Molina was scheduled to catch, but was unable to because he went 
to see his wife, who was having a baby. Whiteside caught in his place, 
and Jonathan Sánchez, starting in place of the injured Randy Johnson,[19] 
threw a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres. When asked if he thought 
it was more unlikely for Sánchez to throw a no-hitter or for him to catch 
it, he said, "Probably me catching one."[20] He hit a grand slam, his first 
Major League home run, against Brian Moehler of the Houston Astros in a 
10–6 Giants' victory on August 5, 2009.[21] He joined Bobby Bonds, Dave 
Kingman, and Brian Dallimore as the only Giants to hit a grand slam for 
their first home run.[1] He finished the year with 29 hits in 49 games 
(126 at-bats), two home runs, and 13 RBI. Defensively, he posted a .993 
fielding percentage while catching 39% of attempted base stealers.[14] 
In 2010, for the first time in his career, Whiteside made an MLB team out 
of spring training.[22] He served as Sánchez's personal catcher for much 
of the season, catching 19 of his starts. Following Molina's trade to the 
Texas Rangers on June 30, Whiteside saw his playing time reduced as Buster 
Posey caught more and more games; Whiteside would only start six of the 
Giants' final 57 games.[1][23][24] He finished the regular season with 
a .238 batting average, appearing in 73 games. Though Whiteside did not 
appear in any playoff games, he was on the team's roster throughout the 
playoffs, earning his first career championship title after the Giants 
won the series against the Rangers.[14][25][26] In 2011, Whiteside again 
began the year as the backup catcher. However, following Posey's season-ending 
leg injury on May 25, 2011, he moved into a more prominent role, splitting 
starting time with Chris Stewart.[27][28][29][30] On June 22, he had two 
hits (including a triple) and a season-high three RBI in a 5–2 victory 
over the Twins.[31] He had a season-high three hits on July 14 in a 12-inning, 
6–2 victory over San Diego.[32] From August 19 through August 25, he was 
on the seven-day disabled list with a concussion.[33][34] In 82 games (213 
at bats), Whiteside hit .197 with 42 hits, four home runs, and 17 RBI.[1] 
Defensively, he threw out 25% of attempted base stealers.[14] He was non-tendered 
after the season and briefly became a free agent before being re-signed 
to a one-year deal with the Giants.[35][36] In 2012 spring training, Whiteside 
competed with Stewart for the backup catcher job. However, the Giants ultimately 
decided to give the role to prospect Héctor Sánchez, a promising hitter 
who had been expected to start the season with Fresno to work on his defense. 
Stewart was traded to the Yankees and Whiteside was sent to Fresno.[37][38] 
In 60 games (201 at bats) with Fresno, he hit .224 with 45 hits, one home 
run, and 20 RBI.[4] On July 18, 2012, Whiteside was called up from Fresno 
when Héctor Sánchez was placed on the disabled list, appearing in six games 
before being optioned back to Fresno on August 1 when Sánchez returned 
from the disabled list.[39][40] He was then recalled on August 26 to be 
the third-string catcher.[41] Whiteside appeared in 12 games with the Giants 
in 2012, having one hit (an RBI double) in 11 at bats.[1] He threw out 
three out of five attempted base stealers.[14] This time, he was left off 
the playoff roster as the Giants went on to win the World Series in a four-game 
sweep against the Detroit Tigers.[1] Due to the emergence of Héctor Sánchez, 
Whiteside did not expect to return to the Giants after 2012. "I didn't 
really think I'd be back with the Giants. Love that team and love that 
organization. They've got a good thing going there. Good group of guys 
and I've enjoyed the time I've spent there."[42] On November 5, 2012, Whiteside 
was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees, agreeing to terms with 
them on a one-year contract worth $625,000 in the Major Leagues and $200,000 
in the Minors on November 26.[43] Just two days later, the Yankees designated 
Whiteside for assignment to make room for Andy Pettitte.[44] On December 
3, he was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays.[44] Nine days later, 
Whiteside was claimed off waivers by the Texas Rangers.[45] He was designated 
for assignment by the Rangers on January 3, 2013, and removed from the 
40 man roster to make room for Jason Frasor.[46] Whiteside cleared waivers 
the next day and was assigned to the Rangers' Triple-A affiliate Round 
Rock Express of the Pacific Coast League.[47] Whiteside attended 2013 spring 
training as a non-roster invitee, appearing in five games.[1] He played 
2013 with the Round Rock Express, where he split time at catcher with Robinson 
Chirinos and José Félix.[48] In 67 games (225 at bats) with the Express, 
he hit .187 with 5 home runs and 25 RBI.[4] On October 1, he filed for 
free agency.[4] On November 15, 2013, Whiteside signed a minor league contract 
with the Chicago Cubs, with an invitation to spring training.[14] He competed 
with John Baker and George Kottaras for the backup catcher role, and was 
assigned to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League on March 
27 when Baker was given the role.[49] His contract was selected from Iowa 
on June 3 when Welington Castillo was placed on the disabled list.[50] 
Whiteside appeared in eight games, batting .120.[1] He was designated for 
assignment on June 22 when Castillo returned from the disabled list, and 
sent outright to the Iowa Cubs on June 25.[51] Whiteside elected free agency 
in October 2014.[52] He signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta 
Braves during the off-season in 2015, but decided to retire instead.[53] 
He returned to the San Francisco Giants as a bullpen catcher.[54] Whiteside 
married his high school sweetheart, Amy, in 2004. They have two sons: Whit 
and Wake.[42] Whiteside is easily recognized by his completely gray hair, 
which he said began to gray when he was in high school. Whiteside said, 
"I've come to terms with it. As long as it doesn't fall out, I'll be doing 
all right, I think."[17] After Whiteside won the 2010 World Series, his 
hometown of New Albany declared an "Eli Whiteside Day" and presented Whiteside
