Kevin Charles Bass (born May 12, 1959) is an American former outfielder 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for the Milwaukee Brewers, Houston 
Astros, San Francisco Giants, New York Mets, and Baltimore Orioles. The 
Milwaukee Brewers selected Bass in the second round of the 1977 MLB Draft. 
His MLB debut came on April 9, 1982. Bass was traded to the Houston Astros 
from Milwaukee with Frank DiPino and Mike Madden for Don Sutton on August 
30, 1982. He played his final MLB game on October 1, 1995. Bass had his 
best year in 1986 for an Astros team that narrowly missed a World Series 
appearance. Bass was named to the 1986 National League All-Star team, pacing 
the Astros with a .311 batting average, 20 home runs, 22 steals, and sterling 
defensive play. His career year did not have a storybook ending, however. 
In Game Six of the epic 1986 NLCS, he struck out swinging with men on first 
and second in the 16th inning, sealing a 7-6 victory for the Mets, allowing 
them to advance to the 1986 World Series. On August 3, 1987 versus the 
San Francisco Giants, Bass became the 15th switch hitter in major league 
history to hit a home run from each side of the plate in the same game. 
In 1989, the Astros right fielder hit two grand slams in a season. The 
first stunned Cubs closer Mitch Williams, turning a 4–4 tie into an 8–4 
Astros victory. The second, against Atlanta Braves reliever Mark Eichhorn 
on September 20, created a tie game that the Astros won in 14 innings. 
Bass lives in the Houston, Texas area and works in real estate. He is a 
cousin of former American football player James Lofton. Bass is also the 
nephew of the late Stan Johnson, a former professional baseball player, 
who played for the White Sox and the Athletics organizations. Two of Kevin's 
sons were selected in the 2007 MLB Draft. Garrett (Jacksonville State University) 
was selected by the Washington Nationals in the 42nd round played a couple 
of seasons in their organization, followed by time in the independent minor 
leagues.[1] Justin (Clements High School) was taken by the Los Angeles 
Angels in the 21st round and has spent several seasons in Rookie and A
