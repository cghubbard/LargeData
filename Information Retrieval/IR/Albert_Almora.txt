Albert Almora Jr. (born April 16, 1994) is an American professional baseball 
outfielder of Cuban descent, who currently plays for the Chicago Cubs of 
Major League Baseball (MLB). Almora primarily plays center field. Almora 
attended Mater Academy Charter School in Hialeah Gardens, Florida. In 2011, 
Almora was named USA Baseball's athlete of the year after leading the 18 
and under team to a 9â€“0 record and being named the tournament MVP. He played 
on six national teams while in high school, tying a record.[1] He won the 
USA Baseball Richard W. "Dick" Case Player of the Year Award in 2011.[2][3] 
The Chicago Cubs selected Almora Jr. in the first round, with the sixth 
overall selection, in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with 
the Cubs, receiving a $3.9 million signing bonus. MLB.com ranked Almora 
as the second best prospect in the Cubs organization in 2013,[4] and the 
39th ranked prospect in all of baseball. Almora played for the Kane County 
Cougars of the Class A Midwest League in 2013. He had a .329 batting average 
in 61 games played, as he missed time due to injury. After the 2013 season, 
the Cubs assigned Almora to the Arizona Fall League to gain more experience.[4][5] 
Almora began the 2015 season at the Southern League AA level Tennessee 
Smokies. On April 5, 2016 he was assigned to the Iowa Cubs of the Pacific 
Coast League, the Cubs AAA affiliate. [1] At Iowa prior to being called 
up, he was batting .318 in 54 games. Almora Jr. was promoted to the Cubs 
on June 7, 2016 when Jorge Soler was placed on the disabled list.[6] He 
made his first career start in left field on June 8, 2016 against the Philadelphia 
Phillies[7] and on his first fielding opportunity threw out a runner at 
home to complete a double play. The following day, he got his first major 
league hit. On November 2, 2016 In Game 7 of the 2016 World Series, Almora 
Jr. took over as a pinch runner for Kyle Schwarber, the Cubs designated 
hitter who opened the top of the 10th inning with a lead-off single to 
right. Almora Jr. advanced to second base on a rare tag-up play from first 
base thanks to a deep fly ball out hit by Kris Bryant. After Cleveland 
Indians pitcher Bryan Shaw intentionally walked Cubs first baseman Anthony 
Rizzo, Almora Jr. scored the go-ahead 7th run for the Cubs off of a double 
by Ben Zobrist. The Cubs went on to win the game 8-7, earning their first 
World Series victory since 1908 thanks in part to Almora Jr.'s baserunning 
skill.[8] His father, Albert Sr., played baseball in Cuba before he defected 
to the United States.[4] Almora began training with his father when he
