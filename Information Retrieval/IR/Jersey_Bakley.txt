Edward Enoch "Jersey" Bakley[1] (April 17, 1864 â€“ February 17, 1915) was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher in the late 19th century. He pitched for 
nine different teams in six years of play from 1883 to 1891. Sometimes 
his last name is spelled "Bakely" or "Bakeley". Born in the Blackwood section 
of Gloucester Township, New Jersey, Bakley made his major league debut 
at the age of 19 for the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association.[2] 
He went 5-3 for the eventual pennant winners. He spent the next several 
years in the minors before returning to the majors in 1888 and was arguably 
one of the better pitchers in the country in 1888 and 1889. His 532 innings 
pitched in 1888 ranked second in the AA, and he went 25-33 with a 2.97 
earned run average. The next season, his 2.96 ERA was the second-best in 
the National League. On September 3, 1890, Bakley gave up Harry Stovey's 
100th homer, which was the first time that milestone had ever been reached.
