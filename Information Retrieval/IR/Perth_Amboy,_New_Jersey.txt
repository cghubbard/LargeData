Perth Amboy is a city in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. The 
City of Perth Amboy is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the 
2010 United States Census, the city's population was 50,814,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 3,511 (+7.4%) from the 47,303 counted in the 
2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 5,336 (+12.7%) from the 41,967 
counted in the 1990 Census.[20] Perth Amboy is known as the "City by the 
Bay," referring to Raritan Bay.[21] The Lenape Native Americans called 
the point on which the city is built "Ompoge" meaning "level ground".[22] 
When settled in 1684 the new city was dubbed New Perth in honor of James 
Drummond, Earl of Perth, one of the associates of a company of Scottish 
proprietaries. The Algonquian language name persisted, corrupted to Ambo, 
or Point Amboy, and eventually a combination of the native and colonial 
names emerged,[23][24][25] also appearing in South Amboy. Perth Amboy was 
first settled around 1683 by Scottish colonists who had been recruited 
to inhabit the share of the East Jersey colony owned by Robert Barclay, 
a Quaker who would later become the absentee governor of the province.[26] 
Perth Amboy was formed by Royal charter on August 4, 1718, within various 
townships and again by New Jersey Legislature on December 21, 1784, within 
Perth Amboy Township and from part of Woodbridge Township. Perth Amboy 
Township was formed on October 31, 1693, and was enlarged during the 1720s 
to encompass Perth Amboy city. Perth Amboy Township was incorporated as 
one of New Jersey's initial 104 townships through the Township Act of 1798 
on February 21, 1798. The township was replaced by Perth Amboy city on 
April 8, 1844.[27] Perth Amboy served as a capital of the Province of New 
Jersey from 1686 until 1776. In 1684, Perth Amboy became the capital of 
East Jersey and remained the capital until the union of East and West Jersey 
in 1702, and became an alternate colonial capital with Burlington until 
1776.[28] A few of the buildings from this early period can still be seen 
today.[29] Most notably, the Proprietary House, the home of William Franklin, 
the last Royal Governor of New Jersey and estranged son of Benjamin Franklin, 
still stands in the waterfront area of the city.[30] St. Peter's Church 
was founded in 1718 by the first Episcopal congregation in the state. Its 
current building, dating from 1875, is surrounded by a graveyard of early 
inhabitants and displays a collection of stained-glass windows with religious 
scenes as well as early depictions of New Jersey receiving her charter 
and a meeting between William Franklin and his father, Ben.[31] Perth Amboy 
City Hall, first built as a courthouse in 1714, survived major fires in 
1731 and 1764 and is the oldest city hall in continuous use in the United 
States.[32][33] The Kearny Cottage, moved from its original location, is 
a remaining example of 18th Century vernacular architecture. During the 
colonial period and for a significant time thereafter, Perth Amboy was 
an important way-station for travelers between New York City and Philadelphia, 
as it was the site of a ferry that crossed the Arthur Kill to Tottenville, 
Staten Island. Regular service began in 1709. This ferry became less important 
when the Outerbridge Crossing opened in 1928, but continued to operate 
until 1963. In 1998, the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip was restored to its 1904 
appearance.[34] A replica of the ticket office has been constructed and 
is used as a small museum.[33][35] By the middle of the 19th century, immigration 
and industrialization transformed Perth Amboy. Factories such as A. Hall 
and Sons Terra Cotta, Guggenheim and Sons and the Copper Works Smelting 
Company fueled a thriving downtown and employed many area residents. Growth 
was further stimulated by becoming the tidewater terminal for the Lehigh 
Valley Railroad and a coal shipping point.[36] Perth Amboy developed tightly 
knit and insular ethnic neighborhoods such as Budapest, Dublin, and Chickentown.[37] 
Immigrants from Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Russia, 
and Austria quickly dominated the factory jobs.[23] In 1903, the Perth 
Amboy Public Library became the first Carnegie library in the state, made 
possible through grants from Andrew Carnegie, and donations of local philanthropists.[38][39][40] 
In 1914, Perth Amboy had a baseball team called the Pacers; they only played 
for one season.[41] In late August 1923 a violent riot by an estimated 
6,000 persons shook Perth Amboy when the Ku Klux Klan attempted to organize 
a meeting in the city.[42][43] The city was also a resort town in the 19th 
century and early 20th century, located on the northern edge of the Raritan 
Bayshore. Since the early 1990s Perth Amboy has seen redevelopment. Small 
businesses have started to open up, helped by the city's designation as 
an Urban Enterprise Zone. The waterfront has also seen a rebirth. The marina 
has been extended, there are new promenades, parks, and housing overlooking 
the bay. The chapter "More Alarms at Night" in humorist James Thurber's 
biography My Life and Hard Times involves Perth Amboy. One night during 
his adolescence in Ohio, young Thurber is unable to go to sleep because 
he cannot remember the name of this New Jersey community. He wakens his 
father and demands that he start naming towns in New Jersey. When the startled 
father names several towns with single-word names, Thurber replies that 
the name he is seeking is "two words, like helter skelter". This convinces 
his father that Thurber has become dangerously insane. Thurber also wrote 
the story later made into the film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, about 
an "inconsequential guy from Perth Amboy, New Jersey".[44] Perth Amboy's 
water pumping station is located in Old Bridge Township[45] According to 
the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 5.957 square 
miles (15.429 km2), including 4.702 square miles (12.178 km2) of land and 
1.255 square miles (3.251 km2) of water (21.07%).[1][2] Perth Amboy, and 
South Amboy across the Raritan River, are collectively referred to as The 
Amboys. Signage for Exit 11 on the New Jersey Turnpike refers to "The Amboys" 
as a destination. The Amboys are the northern limit of the area informally 
referred to as the Bayshore. Perth Amboy borders Woodbridge Township (adjacent 
by land to the north and west), Sayreville (to the southwest, across the 
Raritan River), South Amboy (south across the upper reaches of Raritan 
Bay, directly connected only by rail), and the New York City borough of 
Staten Island (east across the Arthur Kill).[46] Unincorporated communities, 
localities and place names located partially or completely within the city 
include Barber, Eagleswood and Florida Grove.[47] Perth Amboy sits on a 
geological layer of clay several hundred feet thick. Consequently, clay 
mining and factories such as A. Hall and Sons Terra Cotta located in Perth 
Amboy in the late 19th century.[citation needed] In the September 2005 
issue, Golf Magazine named Perth Amboy the unofficial "Golf Capital of 
the U.S.," despite the fact that there are no golf courses within the city 
limits, citing the city's access to 25 of the magazine's Top 100 Golf Courses 
in the U.S., which can be found within 150 mi (240 km) of Perth Amboy.[48] 
Perth Amboy features a historic waterfront, which has gone through significant 
revitalization. This is where the city was first settled and one of the 
few places left in New Jersey that has a historic and marina culture surrounded 
by water. Local attractions include the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip, two small 
museums, an art gallery, a yacht club, and a marina. Near the marina lies 
a park with a small bandshell. On Sunday afternoons in the summertime, 
Perth Amboy hosts the Concerts by the Bay in the park's bandshell. Every 
Thursday evening in the summer Perth Amboy hosts the Mayor's Concert Series 
in Bayview Park. Perth Amboy also hosts an annual Waterfront Arts Festival. 
The waterfront is also characterized by a redbrick promenade near the water 
and many stately Victorian homes, some on hills overlooking the bay and 
predominating tree lined streets with well-manicured lawns. It has a number 
of seafood restaurants, as well. The land rises steeply after two blocks. 
This hides the rest of the town, making the waterfront look like a quiet 
fishing village. Points of interest on the waterfront include St. Peter's 
Episcopal Church, and the Proprietary House, which is now the former governor's 
mansion and houses a museum and some offices. Kearny Cottage, which also 
has a museum, is here. In addition, this section of Perth Amboy once had 
a thriving Jewish community with yeshivas, synagogues, kosher butchers 
and bakers.[49] Today however there are only two synagogues left each with 
only a few members usually over the age of 55. A project called the Landings 
at Harborside was to have featured 2,100 residential units along with indoor 
parking, 150,000 sq ft (14,000 m2) of retail space, a community center, 
and recreation amenities for the public as well.[50] After meeting with 
Charles Kushner, the developer who spent two years in prison after being 
convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and making illegal campaign 
contributions, Mayor Wilda Diaz endorsed a scaled-back design concept for 
the development, allowing Section 8 housing rentals instead of owner-occupied 
units as originally promised.[51] Perth Amboy was settled in 1683 and incorporated 
as a city in 1718. It was founded by English merchants, Scots seeking religious 
freedom, and French Protestants, who sought to make use of Perth Amboy's 
harbor to its full potential. Downtown is the main commercial district 
and is centered on Smith Street. It is an Urban Enterprise Zone and the 
reduced sales tax rate of 3½% (half of the statewide rate of 7%) funds 
revitalization of Smith Street with newly planted trees, Victorian streetlights, 
benches, garbage cans, and redbrick sidewalks.[52][53] Smith Street is 
a relatively small shopping center that is only seven blocks wide and bustles 
with stores catering to working-class customers. The street is flanked 
by mainly two- to three-story buildings of varied architecture. It also 
has a lone bank skyscraper which is 10-stories tall called Amboy Towers, 
located at Five Corners, the intersection of Smith Street, New Brunswick 
Avenue and State Street.[54] Once home to several department stores downtown, 
the largest today is discount retailer Bargain Man. Harbortown is at townhouse 
development on the waterfront which continues to be expanded since construction 
started in 1987. Affordable housing (Section 8) along with more affluent 
homes can be found in Harbortown, an economically and ethnically diverse 
townhouse development in the city.[55] This area was the Lehigh Valley 
Railroad marshaling yards where coal was loaded onto barges for shipment 
to New York City and elsewhere until the LVRR went bankrupt in 1976.[56] 
Hall Avenue is a neighborhood centered on Hall Avenue east of the NJ Transit 
train tracks. The street itself, Hall Avenue, is no longer the commercial 
strip it once wase. Still, although the street has few pedestrians, it 
is not deserted. In addition, there is a recently built strip mall on the 
corner of Hall Avenue and State Street called the "Firehouse Plaza." There 
is also the special "Banco Popular" a branch of the bank headquartered 
in Puerto Rico. However, Hall Avenue is now primarily residential. Most 
of the homes are aging apartments, but there are also some newly constructed 
homes. Hall Avenue remains a traditional Puerto Rican neighborhood, and 
it hosts the city's annual Puerto Rican Day Festival, which is held on 
the same day of the historic Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.[57] 
Rudyk Park is north of Route 440 and features the Roberto Clemente Baseball 
Field and an industrial park. The southwestern section is a mainly working-class 
residential neighborhood with some light industry, once the site of Eagleswood 
Military Academy. The city's largest strip mall is located here. This neighborhood 
has a large and diversified Hispanic neighborhood with many Dominicans, 
Puerto Ricans, and recently, South Americans. Much of the city's Mexican 
population also lives in this section. Previously, this section of Perth 
Amboy had a large Irish population and was once named "Dublin." Following 
the Irish came the Eastern Europeans, primarily Polish and Hungarian. Most 
of the housing consists of small one- or two-family houses. The main commercial 
strip is Smith Street, west of the NJ Transit train tracks. The western 
section of the waterfront is west of Kearny Avenue. It is an overwhelmingly 
blue-collar Hispanic neighborhood. Most of the homes are over 100 years 
old and many are modest row houses. Sadowski Parkway Park lines through 
the southern end of the neighborhood and has a walkway with a beach. The 
park also hosts the Dominican festival and other festivals during the summer. 
State Street is a neighborhood east of the NJ Transit train tracks, north 
of Fayette Street, and south of Harbortown. Like the southwestern section 
of Perth Amboy, it is predominantly working-class Hispanic. In addition, 
this neighborhood had many industries and factories before they moved overseas. 
The neighborhood is mainly Caribbean Hispanic. This section once had a 
large Cuban community. The State and Fayette Gardens, an apartment complex 
in the neighborhood, were called "The Cuban Buildings" at one time. The 
Landings at Harborside redevelopment project is being constructed in this 
neighborhood. Amboy Avenue is a quasi-suburban, working to middle-class 
neighborhood. It is also referred to as the "Hospital section" or the "High 
School section" due to the fact that these places are located in the neighborhood. 
Today most residents are Hispanic; Amboy Avenue once had a strong Italian 
population. Maurer is a chiefly working to middle-class neighborhood that 
lies in the northern part of Route 440. It is heavily industrial with many 
oil refineries and brownfields. Like Amboy Avenue, it is quasi-suburban. 
Chickentown is a neighborhood in the western part of Route 35 south of 
Spa Springs, just south of Route 440. It shares many of the same characteristics 
of Spa Springs but to a lesser extent. The city's largest park, Washington 
Park, is located here. It received its name from all the chicken farms 
(hens and eggs) that were located here before World War II. Along with 
the waterfront, Spa Springs, in the northwestern part of the city, remains 
one of the most attractive and middle-class areas of the city. The population 
is older. Spa Springs is the wealthiest neighborhood in town and is the 
most suburban with single-family houses and garages. Perth Amboy has a 
humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) typical of 
New Jersey with warm summers and cold winters. The city is one of many 
U.S. communities with a majority Hispanic population. At the 2010 United 
States Census, there were 50,814 people, 15,419 households, and 11,456 
families residing in the city. The population density was 10,806.8 per

The city's Hispanic population was the second-highest percentage among 
municipalities in New Jersey as of the 2010 Census, ranked behind Union 
City with 84.7%.[70] There were 15,419 households, of which 40.0% had children

showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income 
was $47,696 (with a margin of error of +/- $3,644) and the median family 
income was $53,792 (+/- $2,943). Males had a median income of $38,485 (+/- 
$2,450) versus $30,078 (+/- $3,452) for females. The per capita income 
for the city was $20,162 (+/-$933). About 16.3% of families and 19.4% of 
the population were below the poverty line, including 28.8% of those under 
age 18 and 15.2% of those age 65 or over.[71] As of the 2000 United States 
Census[17] there were 47,303 people, 14,562 households, and 10,761 families 
residing in the city. The population density was 9,892.0 people per square 
mile (3,820.9/km2). There were 15,236 housing units at an average density

Amboy residents identified themselves as being of Puerto Rican ancestry, 
the fifth highest concentration of Puerto Ricans on the U.S. mainland of 
those municipalities with 1,000 or more residents identifying their ancestry.[72] 
In the same census, 18.81% of Perth Amboy residents identified themselves 
as being of Dominican ancestry, the third highest concentration in the 
country of Dominicans in the United States after Haverstraw, New York and 
Lawrence, Massachusetts using the same criteria.[73] Portions of Perth 
Amboy are part of an Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits 
to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of 
a reduced 3½% sales tax rate at eligible merchants (versus the 7% rate 
charged statewide).[53] The City of Perth Amboy is governed under the Mayor-Council 
system of municipal government under the Faulkner Act. Members of the City 
Council are elected at-large on a non-partisan basis to four-year terms 
of office on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election 
in even years. The mayor also serves a four-year term of office, which 
is up for election the same year that two council seats are up for vote.[7] 
In October 2010, the City Council voted to shift the city's non-partisan 
elections from May to November, with the first balloting held in conjunction 
with the General Election in November 2012.[74] As of 2016[update], the 
mayor of Perth Amboy is Wilda Diaz, the first Latina mayor in state history, 
whose term of office ends on December 31, 2016.[3] She succeeded former 
mayor and 19th legislative district Assemblyman Joseph Vas, who served 
as mayor for 18 years. Members of the City Council are Council President 
Lisa Nanton (2016), Fernando Gonzalez (2018), Fernando Irizarry (2016), 
Joel Pabon, Sr. (2018) and William Petrick (2018).[6][75][76][77] In the 
November 2014 general election Fernando Gonzalez came in third place, winning 
the final seat up for election ahead of Sergio Diaz by nine votes. In March 
2015, a Superior Court judge ordered a special election between Diaz and 
Gonzalez after finding that votes had been illegally cast and that there 
was evidence of fraud in mail voting.[78] In the special election, Gonzalez 
beat Diaz by a 112-vote margin.[79] Perth Amboy is located in the 6th Congressional 
District[80] and is part of New Jersey's 19th state legislative district.[10][81][82] 
Prior to the 2010 Census, Perth Amboy had been part of the 13th Congressional 
District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that 
took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 
general elections.[83] New Jersey's Sixth Congressional District is represented 
by Frank Pallone (D, Long Branch).[84] New Jersey is represented in the 
United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[85] and 
Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[86][87] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, 
General Assembly), the 19th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Joseph Vitale (D, Woodbridge Township) 
and in the General Assembly by Craig Coughlin (D, Woodbridge Township) 
and John Wisniewski (D, Sayreville).[88] The Governor of New Jersey is 
Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[89] The Lieutenant Governor of New 
Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[90] Middlesex County is governed 
by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose seven members are elected at-large 
on a partisan basis to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered 
basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election each year 
as part of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting 
held in January, the board selects from among its members a Freeholder 
Director and Deputy Director. As of 2015[update], Middlesex County's Freeholders 
(with party affiliation, term-end year, residence and committee chairmanship 
listed in parentheses) are Freeholder Director Ronald G. Rios (D, term 
ends December 31, 2015, Carteret; Ex-officio on all committees),[91] Freeholder 
Deputy Director Carol Barrett Bellante (D, 2017; Monmouth Junction, South

24,593 registered voters (253 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 24.1%.[107][108] 
In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 69.8% 
of the vote (4,645 ballots cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 
24.2% (1,611 votes), Independent Chris Daggett with 3.4% (228 votes) and 
other candidates with 0.8% (50 votes), among the 6,654 ballots cast by

of May 2010[update], the city had a total of 75.25 miles (121.10 km) of 
roadways, of which 58.36 miles (93.92 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
11.45 miles (18.43 km) by Middlesex County and 4.27 miles (6.87 km) by 
the New Jersey Department of Transportation.[110] The Outerbridge Crossing, 
which opened to traffic on June 29, 1928, is a cantilever bridge over the 
Arthur Kill that connects Perth Amboy with Staten Island. Known locally 
as the "Outerbridge", it is part of a popular route on NY-440 / NJ-440 
from the south and west to New York City and Long Island. Despite the assumption 
that the name is derived from its location as the southernmost bridge in 
New York State and Staten Island, the Outerbridge Crossing was named in 
honor of Eugenius H. Outerbridge, first Chairman of the Port Authority.[111] 
The bridge clears the channel by 143 ft (44 m), providing passage for some 
of the largest ships entering the Port of New York and New Jersey.[112] 
The Victory Bridge carries Route 35 over the Raritan River, connecting 
Perth Amboy on the north with the borough of Sayreville to the south. A 
project completed in 2005 replaced a swing bridge that carried four lanes 
of traffic with twin bridges, each carrying two lanes of traffic, an outside 
shoulder and a bike lane.[113] The city has NJ Transit train service at

costs for school building and renovation projects in these districts under 
the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[118][119] 
As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's 10 schools had an enrollment 
of 10,258 students and 786.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for 
a student–teacher ratio of 13.05:1.[120] Schools in the district (with

and fundraising to increase its size threefold is underway.[40][135] Assumption
