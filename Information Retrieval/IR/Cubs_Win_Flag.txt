The Cubs Win Flag is a victory flag that is flown at Wrigley Field after 
every Chicago Cubs home win.[1] The flag is variously referred to by approximately 
a dozen names, combining; either Cubs or Chicago Cubs; Win, W, White, White 
W, or W Win; and flag, banner or banner flag. Other common names for the 
symbol include Chicago Cubs W Win Flag and Chicago Cubs Win Banner Flag.[2][3] 
It has become an important symbol for fans and days when the win flag is 
flown are known as "White Flag Days". The tradition of flying a win or 
loss flag over the stadium began soon after the construction of the scoreboard 
in 1937.[4] The flag has used two different color schemes with the letter 
"W" on a solid background, and there is a loss indicator flag with a letter 
"L". Additionally, the flags have been complemented by different color 
schemes of indicator lights.[4] The flag is also changed after each Cubs 
win.[5] The flag has become a very symbolic emblem for devout Cubs fans. 
Some retailers sell slightly different versions that also have the Cubs 
logo at the bottom.[6] Flying a flag over Wrigley Field to denote wins 
and losses is a longstanding tradition.[7][8] Currently, the Win Flag is 
composed of a large blue letter "W" on a white background while the Loss 
Flag is a large white letter "L" on a blue background.[9] Early in the 
21st century, the phrase "White flag time at Wrigley!" was used to explain 
that the Cubs had just won that day's home game.[10] More recently, at 
least as early as the 2015 season, the Cubs have used the phrase "Fly the 
W!"; an accompanying social media hashtag "#FlyTheW" has been heavily promoted 
by the team and its fans.[11] The flag is raised by a scoreboard crew member 
immediately after the completion of a game,[12] and in the case of a doubleheader 
split, both flags are flown.[10] It is customary to fly flags from sunrise 
until sunset, unless they are directly illuminated.[13] At the beginning 
of each day, the cross-shaped "masthead" atop the center field scoreboard 
displays the American flag at the top, and three strands of flags bearing 
the colors and nicknames of each of the National League clubs, one strand 
per Division in order of that day's standings.[14] Immediately after the 
game, one of the strands of flags is lowered, and either the W or the L-lettered 
flag is raised in its place. The W-lettered flag is raised on the left 
field side of the board, above the blue light that also indicates a win.[14] 
The L-lettered flag is raised on the right field side of the board, above 
the white light that indicates a loss. Once the Win or Loss Flag has been 
raised, the other flags are lowered and also stowed away inside the scoreboard. 
The symbolism of the flag now serves a wide variety of purposes. It is 
commonly reproduced in 3-by-5-foot (0.91 by 1.52 m) dimensions,[1][15] 
and car flag versions are also sold.[16] The flag is also available in 
2-by-3-foot (0.61 by 0.91 m) dimension versions.[17] The flag has become 
a celebratory symbol for Chicago Cubs fans who purchase reproductions and 
take them to games at home and on the road to show support.[10] The fans 
wave them after victories at Wrigley Field,[18] and they hang them in the 
stands during playoff series. Some fans fly a win flag in place of or in 
addition to the Flag of the United States on days when the Cubs win.[19] 
Since 1998, the flags have become ever more popular, with demand reaching 
a level where they are sold at Wrigley Field.[10] In 2007, with the Cubs 
in playoff contention for the first time in 3 years, the Cubs' victory 
tune, Go Cubs Go! became more popular among the fans. Due to the song's 
growing popularity, after wins at home, Cubs TV broadcasters Len Kasper 
and Bob Brenly would have their microphones shut off, while the camera 
pans around the stadium to view the jubilant fans as Go Cubs Go! plays 
in the background. After fans discovered this, they started purchasing 
"W" flags and waving them after wins at home as an attempt to get on TV. 
However, in seasons when the Cubs are performing poorly the tradition has 
led to parody and satire, such as stories of the Cubs retiring the win 
flag due to signs of neglect. While not having the popularity of the Win 
Flag, the Loss Flag has become increasingly popular with clubs who traditionally 
have rivalries with the Cubs, such as the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee 
Brewers, or Chicago White Sox. Fans of those teams wave the blue flag after 
their team defeats the Cubs at Busch Stadium or U.S. Cellular Field. However, 
because of the enormous fan base that the Cubs hold, it isn't uncommon 
to see fans at games on the road waving their "W" flags during Cubs wins 
on the road. The flag is known by many names, with none being more prevalent 
than the rest, and may often be referred to by more than one name by the 
same manufacturer. "Chicago Cubs W Win Flag" is the name used on Amazon.com,[2] 
however the company also refers to the flag as Chicago Cubs 'W' Banner 
Flag in their marketplace section.[3] CubWorld.com also refers to the flag 
by the name Chicago Cubs 'W' Banner Flag.[20] Other retailers use the names 
Cubs Win W Flag,[21] Chicago Cubs Win 3' x 5' Flag,[15][22][23][24] Cubs 
W Flag,[25] or (Chicago Cubs) W Flag in the case of Sports Fan Warehouse.[26] 
One retailer even sells an item called the Chicago Cubs W Fan Banner.[27] 
Another retailer sells two versions of the flag listed as Chicago Cubs 
Win W Flag and Chicago Cubs Win Flag, yet its advertisements mentions celebrating 
a Cub win with the Chicago Cubs White "W" Flag.[28] An alternate version 
that has the Chicago Cubs logo beneath the W can be found under the name 
Chicago Cubs Win W Banner.[6] The Cubs' then-owner Philip K. Wrigley ordered 
the reconstruction of the bleachers and the building of the manually operated 
scoreboard in 1937.[29] The scoreboard's "masthead" was in place by 1938, 
displaying the American flag at the top and flags representing the eight 
clubs of the National League on the left and right strands of the masthead, 
four apiece.[30] In the 1940s, the practice of raising the Win/Loss flags 
was begun.[4] The flags were originally a white "W" on a blue flag and 
a blue "L" on a white flag.[4] This matched what was then the color scheme 
of the Cubs "team flags" that flew on the foul poles, and the many little 
"W.F." flags that flew on the grandstand roof (all of them serving to give 
the players a sense of the wind speed and direction). Ernie Banks was the 
first Cub to have his number retired on August 22, 1982,[31] and his number 
14 has been flown in blue on a white flag (echoing the pattern of a Cubs 
home uniform shirt) on the left field foul pole ever since.[10] On August 
13, 1987, Billy Williams had his number retired and it flew with the same 
color scheme, on the right field foul pole.[10][31] The scheme of the Cubs 
Win flag was reversed in the early 1980s. The change in the flag color 
scheme matched the Win flag color with the honored colors of the retired 
number flags, as the white-on-blue Cubs "team flag" was retired.[10] Subsequent 
retired Cubs numbers for Ron Santo, Ryne Sandberg and Ferguson Jenkins/Greg 
Maddux also match this color scheme. In addition to the flags, Wrigley 
authorized Bill Veeck, the leader of the bleacher reconstruction project, 
to add colored lights on the crossbar of the masthead so that the Chicago 
'L' passengers would be able to see the outcome of Cubs home games after 
sunset. In his autobiography, Veeck remembered the colors as green for 
a win and red for a loss.[4] Hartell's book acknowledges Veeck's comments, 
but reports that contemporary newspapers stated that the colors of the 
lights were blue and white, as they are now. Eventually the original lights 
on the masthead were replaced by lights directly on the top of scoreboard, 
still visible from outside Wrigley field.[4] The lights complement the 
flags by helping night time passersby learn the result of that day's Cubs 
game at a glance.[10] The current blue and white Win/Loss lights were added 
atop the scoreboard in 1978.[10] On April 23, 2008 the Cubs won for the 
10,000th time in the history of the franchise on the road against the Colorado 
Rockies.[32] Like the 9,000th win, the 10,000th win came in a 7–6 victory 
at Coors Field.[32] The Cubs were the second franchise to achieve 10,000 
regular season wins; the San Francisco Giants/New York Giants were the 
first.[32] The franchise flew a special 10,000th win flag along with a 
Cubs Win flag to commemorate the landmark achievement for the franchise. 
This was unusual not just for the 10,000th win, but also for flying the 
flag in reference to a road game. The special flag flew from the afternoon 
of April 24, 2008 until immediately prior to the next home game on April 
29, 2008 at 7:05pm against the Milwaukee Brewers. After the flag was taken 
down, it was autographed by all members of the 2008 Chicago Cubs and auctioned
