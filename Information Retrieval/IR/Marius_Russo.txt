Marius Ugo Russo (July 19, 1914 – March 26, 2005) was a starting pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Yankees (1939–43, 
1946). Russo batted right-handed and threw left-handed. On June 6, 1939, 
Russo debuted with the New York Yankees. He gave four years of good services 
for his team, winning 14 games in both 1940 and 1941, and was their best 
pitcher in 1941. Beside this, he made two postseason starts in the 1941 
and 1943 World Series, both complete game wins. He joined the army in 1944, 
and pitched briefly in 1946. Russo, known as "The Kid From LI", was born 
in Brooklyn, New York. He played baseball for Richmond Hill High School 
in Queens. Later, he attended Brooklyn College and Long Island University 
in Brooklyn. After graduating, Russo played for the Newark Bears, International 
League farm team of the Yankees. In his rookie season for New York, he 
finished with an 8-3 record and a 2.41 ERA in 116.0 innings including two 
shutouts and nine complete games. A noted control ace, in 1940 Russo issued 
just 55 walks in 189.1 innings for a 2.61 W 9/I percentage while compiling 
a 14-8 mark with a 3.28 ERA and 15 complete games in 24 starts. After he 
retired. he moved with his wife Stasia to Florida. Russo enjoyed a career 
year in 1941. He compiled a 14-10 mark with three shutouts and 27 complete 
games in 1941. His 3.09 ERA was the best of the Yankees pitching staff 
and the 4th best in the American League, being surpassed only by Thornton 
Lee (2.37), Al Benton (2.97) and Charlie Wagner (3.07). He also led his 
team in strikeouts (105), games started (27), complete games (17) and innings 
pitched (209.2), and finished second in victories (14) behind Lefty Gomez 
and Red Ruffing (15 each). In the same season, he pitched a one-hit shutout 
and made the AL All-Star team. Russo also started and won a complete game 
2-1 victory in the Yankees 1941 World Series win over the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
In Game 3, with the Series tied 1-1, Russo was locked in a scoreless duel 
with Dodgers' pitcher Freddie Fitzsimmons when, with two out in the seventh 
inning, Russo hit a line drive that caught Fitzsimmons flush on the knee. 
While shortstop Pee Wee Reese caught the deflected ball on the fly to end 
the inning, Fitzsimmons was through for the day. Then, Dodgers reliever 
Hugh Casey was cuffed for four hits and two runs in the eighth, and Brooklyn, 
able to get only four hits off Russo, lost 2-1. The reports on Russo from 
1942 were not good. A sore arm limited him to pitch in only 45.1 innings, 
ending with a 4-1 record and a 2.78 ERA in nine games (five as a starter). 
In 1943, he never had control problems, his arm wasn't hurting, but his 
fastball was losing velocity while trying to simplify his delivery, and 
finished 5-10. Unfortunately, the Yankees provided him with 3.50 runs per 
game in offense, pretty close to his 3.72 ERA in that season. Moreover, 
Russo responded with a brilliant offseason. In the 1943 World Series, Russo 
limited the St. Louis Cardinals to seven hits in Game 4, and helped himself 
with the bat, hitting two doubles and scored the winning run in the eighth 
inning as New York won 2-1. After the 1943 season, Russo left his team 
and his family to serve in the Army Signal Corps in Hawaii. When he returned 
two years later, he played for the Yankees again briefly. In a six-season 
career, Russo posted a 45-34 record with 311 strikeouts and a 3.13 ERA 
in 680.2 innings. A solid hitter, he went 50-for-235 for a .213 batting 
average with 25 RBI and 23 runs. In the post season, Russo compiled a 2-0 
record with a 0.50 ERA in two complete games. Following his retirement 
as a player, Russo worked as an expediter for Grumman Aircraft Eng. Corp. 
in Bethpage, New York. Ending the 1970s, he retired and spent time traveling 
with his wife, Statia Russo. "We'd take trips to Europe, stay a while in 
Phoenix and go up to The Berkshires", she said in an interview. The couple 
moved to Florida in 2001. Marius Russo died of heart illness in a hospital
