Vinicio "Vinny" Castilla Soria (Spanish pronunciation: [kasˈtiʎa]; born 
July 4, 1967) is a Mexican-born former Major League Baseball third baseman 
who played his best years with the Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves. 
Previously, he played with the Atlanta Braves (1991–1992, 2002–2003), Colorado 
Rockies (1993–1999, 2004, 2006), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–2001), Houston 
Astros (2001), Washington Nationals (2005), and San Diego Padres (2006). 
The Atlanta Braves purchased Castilla's contract from the Saltillo club 
out of the Mexican League in 1990. He made his MLB debut as a shortstop 
for the Braves on September 9, 1991. For the 1992 season he only appeared 
in 9 games. In November 1992 he was selected by the Rockies in the expansion 
draft. For the 1993 season he played regularly hitting 9 home runs and 
9 triples (8th in the league) in 105 games as a shortstop. In 1994 his 
playing time was reduced mainly due to the acquisition of shortstop Walt 
Weiss and the 1994-95 Major League Baseball strike. Castilla only saw action 
in 52 games, playing all four positions in the infield. After the departure 
of starting third baseman Charlie Hayes, Castilla was the leading candidate 
to man third base for the 1995 season. This, along with the help of manager 
Don Baylor, was the turning point on Castllas's career, hitting .319 with 
17 home runs and 48 runs batted in by the All Star break, earning him a 
backup spot in the All Star team. He was later named the starting third 
baseman for the NL after Matt Williams was out with an injury. He finished 
the season with a .309 batting average, 32 home runs and 90 RBIs. In the 
NLDS against Atlanta he hit .467 with 3 home runs. Many considered Castilla's 
numbers to be a fluke, mainly because of playing at the friendly confines 
of a thin-air Denver stadium, a stigma that would follow Vinny for most 
of his Colorado career. However, in 1996 he surpassed his numbers from 
the previous year to the tune of a .304/40/113 line. For the 1997 season 
he would have exactly the same totals of home runs, RBIs and batting average 
(40-113-.304). 1998 was by far the best year of his career, earning him 
his second All Star and his first Home Run Derby selection in front of 
his home crowd in Colorado. He finished the season with 46 home runs (4th 
in the league) and 144 RBIs (3rd), which were good enough numbers to finish 
11th in the NL MVP ballot. In 1999 Castilla continued to be productive, 
hitting 33 home runs with 102 RBIs. Prior to the 2000 season, Castilla 
was sent to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, a team that featured veteran sluggers 
Jose Canseco, Greg Vaughn and Fred McGriff. However, he played only in 
85 games, hitting for a .221 BA and 6 home runs. The following year he 
played only 24 games for Tampa Bay before being traded to the Houston Astros. 
After playing only 24 games for Tampa Bay at the beginning of the 2001 
season, Castilla went to play for the Houston Astros where he re-discovered 
his power at the plate. He played in 122 games, hitting 23 home runs (including 
three in one game against the Pirates on July 28th) and 82 RBIs, making 
it to the post season with the Astros, where he hit .273 with a solo home 
run in the NLDS. He was signed as a free agent by the Braves in 2002. Although 
his offensive numbers declined (.232/12/61), he established himself as 
a premier defender at third base, leading the league in fielding average 
with .982. In the post season he hit a solid .320 with a home run and 4 
RBIs. He played another season with the Braves in 2003, finishing the year 
with 22 homers and 76 runs batted in. He returned for a second stint with 
the Colorado Rockies for the 2004 season and had a tremendous year, hitting 
43 doubles and 35 home runs, and led the league with 131 RBIs. Defensively 
Castilla had arguably his best season at third base, leading the league 
in fielding average and committing only 6 errors all year long. Inexplicably 
he was denied of Gold Glove, Silver Slugger Award or All Star Game considerations. 
He moved on to play with the (soon-to- be Washington Nationals) Montreal 
Expos in 2005, hitting 12 home runs and 66 RBIs in 142 games. He finished 
second among third basemen in fielding average, with .970. In 2006 he played 
72 games for the San Diego Padres before being released. He then signed 
with the Rockies for a third time to finish his career in Colorado. His 
last home run with the Rockies came on September 9, 2006 giving him a total 
of 239, good for 3rd all time in franchise history. Always a fan favorite 
in Colorado, Castilla was the last player to retire from the original 1993 
Colorado roster. As of 2016 he is the all-time home run leader among Mexican-born 
players (320). He won three Silver Slugger Awards ('95, '97 and '98) and 
was selected twice to the All Star Game. He hit 30+ home runs six times 
(including three 40-homer seasons) and drove in 100+ runs five times. At 
the peak of his career (1995 to 1999) he averaged 38 home runs and 112 
RBIs. In post season play he finished with a .350 average (21 of 60) in 
17 games, with 5 homers and 12 RBIs. He played in 16 seasons for six different 
clubs, and averaged 165 hits, 28 home runs and 97 RBIs for every 162 games 
played. Many analysts attributed Castilla's great offensive numbers to 
the hitter-friendly Denver stadiums, however, 57% of his career Home Runs 
came in parks other than Mile High and Coors Field (181 out of 320) He 
decided to retire after the Caribbean Series on February 7, 2007, becoming 
a special assistant to Rockies GM Dan O'Dowd.[1] In 2007, he was named 
manager of the Mexico baseball team for the Pan American Games,[2] and 
also served as manager in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.[3] In 2008, 
he was a player-manager for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo in the Mexican 
Pacific League.[3] Castilla and his wife, Samantha, have 3 sons, Vinicio
