The 1970 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 88th year in Major 
League Baseball, their 13th year in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 11th at Candlestick Park. 
The Giants went 86-76, which was good for third place in the National League 
West, 16 games behind the NL Champion Cincinnati Reds. Clyde King was fired 
as manager on May 23 after the Giants dropped a 15-inning 17-16 game to 
the San Diego Padres, slipping them to a 19-23 record and mired in fourth 
place. The Giants elevated Charlie Fox, manager of their AAA Phoenix (Pacific 
Coast League) farm team, to manage the big club. The team responded with 
a double-header sweep of the Padres, 6-1 and 7-6. Fox brought the Giants 
to a third-place finish with a 67-53 record the rest of the way. Infielders
