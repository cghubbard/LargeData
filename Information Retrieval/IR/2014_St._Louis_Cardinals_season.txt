The St. Louis Cardinals 2014 season was the 133rd for the franchise in 
St. Louis, Missouri, the 123rd season in the National League (NL), and 
the ninth at Busch Stadium III. The Cardinals entered 2014 as the defending 
NL champions. Ballpark Village opened on March 27, with a first phase completion 
of 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2),[1][2] and was considered a smashing 
success.[3] Located inside Ballpark Village, the franchise announced the 
opening of the Hall of Fame Museum, with an inaugural induction class of 
22 members. Ownership purchased the club's top minor league affiliate, 
the Memphis Redbirds on March 28. Forbes listed the Cardinals as the eighth-most 
valuable franchise in Major League Baseball at $820 million, and their 
$65.2 million operating income was the highest of all 30 MLB franchises.[4][5] 
They finished the season with a record of 90–72 and finished first in the 
NL Central for the second straight year. They defeated the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the Division Series, 3 games to 1 to advance to their fourth 
consecutive National League Championship Series, where they played San 
Francisco Giants for the second time in three seasons. They lost in five 
games to the Giants and were eliminated. The day after the 2013 World Series 
ended, October 31, a total of five Cardinals players became free agents: 
outfielder Carlos Beltrán, starting pitcher Chris Carpenter, shortstop 
Rafael Furcal, relief pitcher Edward Mujica, and starting pitcher Jake 
Westbrook.[6] Having already purchased three of their minor league affiliates, 
Cardinals ownership reached an agreement in principle to purchase the Memphis 
Redbirds AAA Minor League Baseball franchise from the Memphis Redbirds 
Foundation (MRF) on November 16. The city of Memphis purchased AutoZone 
Park, the Redbirds' home stadium, from MRF and agreed to lease it to the 
Cardinals and perform upgrades.[38] The Memphis City Council (MCC) initially 
set December 3 as the date to vote on the move. They also intended to finalize 
it by the end of the year.[39] After debating for almost four hours on 
the proposal on December 9, the vote was delayed for eight additional days 
because of concerns of certain financial aspects of the deal. The original 
proposal stated the Cardinals would cover at least $15 million in stadium 
improvements to AutoZone Park and pay $300,000 annually in rent to the 
city. Operating costs of the franchise and the stadium were to become the 
responsibility of the Cardinals. The lease was to assure the Redbirds of 
remaining in Memphis through the 2030 season. Two five-year renewal options 
were included with the principal 17-year lease. The Cardinals were officially 
cleared to acquire the Memphis Redbirds on January 7, 2014, after MCC approved 
the plan by an 8-4 vote. The deals included the city purchasing AutoZone 
Park by issuing $24 million in city-backed bonds.[8] The deal was finalized 
on March 28; the Cardinals acquired the Redbirds franchise and Memphis 
acquired the ballpark and began leasing it to the Cardinals.[9] In addition 
to the Redbirds, the team already owned its Double-A affiliate in Springfield, 
high Class A affiliate, and rookie level clubs in Jupiter, Florida.[40] 
Chris Carpenter, winner of the franchise's only Cy Young Award besides 
two won by Bob Gibson, announced his retirement on November 20 after posting 
a 95-44 (.683) over nine seasons as Cardinal. He lost nearly three entire 
seasons to injuries, but garnered a reputation for coming back from them 
to play. He won the Cy Young in 2005, when he was 21–5.[13] In each of 
his full seasons, he won at least 11 games. He finished his major league 
career with a 144–94 (.605) and a 3.76 earned run average (ERA). In 18 
post-season starts, he was 10–4 with a 3.00 ERA.[41] Mozeliak, who announced 
Carpenter's decision during a news conference, said the club offered him 
the opportunity to remain with the franchise in an off-field capacity, 
although it was unclear at the time what that role would be.[13] In December, 
the Cardinals announced they were raising season ticket prices an average 
of 4.1%. They also added new sections of seats and carved up the area of 
seats behind home plate and between first and third base and split the 
tiers in the outfield bleachers. The 330 seats in the overlook deck at 
Ballpark Village also opened for 2014, but were not yet for sale before 
the start of the season and were not made available in 2014 to season-ticket 
holders. Season-ticket holders, who purchased half of the seats in Busch 
Stadium, constituted 83% of season tickets. Annually, season-ticket holders 
renewed at a percentage in the low 90s. 57% of season tickets prices increased 
by $1 per game. Individual game tickets go on sale February 28, 2014.[42] 
David Bell, hired as the assistant hitting coach to replace Bengie Molina, 
was previously an infielder with the Cardinals from 1995 to 1998. He was 
the fourth assistant hitting coach in the past four years. All other members 
of the coaching staff returned in 2014.[43] The Cardinals broadcast team 
retained the services of Mike Shannon for a minimum of two more years. 
Shannon has broadcast since 1972, making 2014 his 42nd year. It was also 
his 56th year as part of the organization, including nine years as a player 
from 1962 to 1970. He was again paired with John Rooney on KMOX, who will 
work with Rick Horton and Al Hrabosky when Shannon is absent. Hrabosky 
and Horton are members of the Cardinals' FOX Sports Midwest television 
team.[17][44] On January 18, chairman William DeWitt, Jr., announced the 
reopening of the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum with a formal 
annual selection process. A "Red Ribbon" committee of Cardinals baseball 
experts plus an annual fan vote will decide three inductees per year. For 
the inaugural class of 2014, the Cardinals announced the following 22 members 
to be inducted in a ceremony on August 16:[45] Four more Cardinals were 
voted into the Cardinals Hall of Fame on an eight-player fan ballot announced 
on April 30. Those eight nominees had to be with the team for at least 
three years and retired from baseball for at least three years. Those not 
voted in by the fans in an online March vote that received almost 80,000 
votes over seven-weeks were: Bob Forsch, Keith Hernandez, Mark McGwire, 
Matt Morris, Ted Simmons and Joe Torre. To be inducted on August 16 along 
with the 22 above are: player-broadcaster Mike Shannon, outfielders Jim 
Edmonds and Willie McGee, and shortstop Marty Marion.[46] In addition, 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum announced the inductions 
of former Cardinals managers La Russa and Joe Torre.[47] The club announced 
its 27-game schedule on November 25, 2013. Pitchers and catchers report 
by Feb. 12, 2014, the position players report by Feb. 17, with the whole 
team scheduling its first workout on Feb. 18. The Grapefruit League opens 
on Feb. 28, starting against the Miami Marlins. Two scheduled off-days 
are Tue. March 4, and Tue. Mar. 18. They end spring training with an exhibition 
game on Fri. Mar. 28 against their AAA-farm team, the Memphis Redbirds, 
at Memphis, Tennessee. It will be the first baseball event at the AutoZone 
Park with the Cardinals owning the team, if the Memphis City Council approves 
the agreement in December 2013,[48] which was delayed until the 8-4 vote 
in favor on January 7, 2014.[8] There are 14 home games at Roger Dean Stadium 
and 13 games away, with 3 of those as the 'visiting' team against the stadium's 
co-tenants, the aforementioned Miami Marlins. All games at Roger Dean Stadium 
start at 12:05pm CT. This is the 17th season at Roger Dean Stadium since 
they left Al Lang Field at St. Petersburg, Florida after March 1997.[49] 
Fox Sports Midwest will broadcast 15 games of the 27 games on its schedule, 
an increase of five more than in 2013, and 10 more than in 2012. ESPN has 
already picked up the Cardinals' March 17 road game against the Boston 
Red Sox. In total, 22 of the Cards' 28 spring games will be available on 
either local TV or radio (KMOX). Last year, only four teams had as many 
as 15 spring games televised in their local market.[50] Middle infield. 
Kolten Wong, the top second-base prospect in the organization, was expected 
to compete for the major league starting position. By signing Mark Ellis, 
the Cardinals saw signing the right-hander as a low-risk backup for Wong 
and good fit for the team. His league-adjusted on-base plus slugging ratio 
of 116 against left-handed pitching strengthened the weakness against left-handed 
pitching the Redbirds dealt with the season before.[51] He hit .270 with 
a .323 on-base percentage in 106 games with the L.A. Dodgers in 2013, and 
hit .282 against lefties.[52] Wong won the starting role. The team reassigned 
outfield prospect Oscar Taveras to minor league camp after efforts for 
him fully recover from ankle surgery produced mixed results. The Cardinals 
opened their regular season at Great American Ball Park against the Cincinnati 
Reds on March 31. Adam Wainwright, making his third Opening Day start, 
won his 100th career game in a 1–0 defeat of the Reds. It was also his 
first win on Opening Day.[53] On April 14, the Cardinals ended the Milwaukee 
Brewers' nine-game winning streak behind Lance Lynn's seven scoreless innings. 
Entering the game with a 6.55 earned run average (ERA), Lynn won his third 
decision behind 11 strikeouts and just three hits and three walks allowed. 
Jhonny Peralta and Jon Jay each homered in the 4–0 victory.[54] Three days 
later, Wainwright continued his strong start for the season at Nationals 
Park with a two-hit complete game shutout in an 8-0 defeat of the Washington 
Nationals. He gave up the first hit in the second inning with a high infield 
chopper, but none until after two outs in the ninth. In his seventh career 
shutout, Wainwright walked three and struck out eight.[55] Former Cardinals' 
catcher and longtime television broadcaster for the Fox network Tim McCarver, 
called his first game of his scheduled 30 for the Cardinals on April 28, 
against the Milwaukee Brewers on Fox Sports Midwest, partnered with Dan 
McLaughlin.[15] With a 12-1 record in April in a total of 15 starts in 
his career, Lance Lynn is in a class in major league baseball history of 
only him and Babe Ruth for that month, with only Ruth having a better first-month 
winning percentage. In marked contrast to his April, his August record 
for the past two seasons (2012 and 2013) is 1-5 with a 5.75 ERA. His 37 
wins since the start of the 2012 season is second in the National League 
only to teammate Adam Wainwright, who has only one more win during that 
span. Lynn's run support is typically the highest of the five regular starters, 
and after his May 4 start is second with 4.6 runs per game to Wainwright's 
5.3.[56] The three-game series finale against the Pirates on May 11, marked 
the end of a road-heavy start to the season with 26 of the first 38 games 
away from Busch Stadium. Not since 1927, have the Cardinals had that many 
road games after the first 38 played. Prior to the game they were 11-14 
(after, 12-14) in road games, and 7-5 at home.[57] The 4-1 win on May 17 
featured four bunt hits, two by Kolten Wong and two by Peter Bourjos. It 
was only the second time in the 2010s that a team did that, and the first 
time since the Detroit Tigers did it on September 23, 2003. Lefthanded 
pitcher Jaime García will make his first start on May 18, since having 
shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum and rotator cuff in late May 2013. 
His last major league start was May 17, 2013 vs. MIL, a 7‐6 win in which 
he pitched 5.1 innings allowing all six runs.[58] Adam Wainwright threw 
the first one-hitter of his career on May 20, against the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
It was his eighth career shutout, walking none and striking out nine. Paul 
Goldschmidt was the only baserunner, getting a double in the fourth inning 
off the centerfield wall after Wainwright had retired the first 11 batters. 
After the hit, he retired the next 16 consecutive batters, facing only 
28 batters which is one over the minimum for a perfect game. He threw 115 
pitches, 86 for strikes. He becomes the second seven-game winner in the 
National League as he notched his 106th career victory (against 59 losses), 
tying him for eighth all-time in Cardinals' history with Slim Sallee.[59][60] 
Three days after starter Jaime García made his first start in over a year, 
reliever Jason Motte made his return on May 21, throwing 15 pitches over 
1.2 innings after a 19-month absence (October 2012) after Tommy John surgery.[61] 
Thirteen former Cardinals held a 50th anniversary reunion of their 1964 
championship in conjunction with the visiting New York Yankees team at 
Busch Stadium on May 26, for the first time since 2005. The 1964 Cardinals 
beat the Yankees in the World Series that year. The 13 players paraded 
around Busch Stadium prior to the game with the Yankees. Dick Groat was 
the oldest living player of the 13 to attend, now at 83. Bob Gibson threw 
out the ceremonial first pitch to his longtime battermate, catcher Tim 
McCarver. Gibson, then 28, and Lou Brock, then 25 on June 18 (traded for 
on June 15 that year for pitcher Ernie Broglio), are in the Hall of Fame. 
Red Schoendienst, then a coach, in 1965 named the manager, along with current 
Cardinals' broadcaster Mike Shannon, plus Julián Javier, Jerry Buchek, 
Phil Gagliano, Ron Taylor, Gordie Richardson, Bob Humphreys, Charlie James, 
and Carl Warwick were the others attending.[62] Adam Wainwright was named 
the NL Co-Players of the Week for May 19–25, along with Josh Beckett, 34, 
for their superb pitching. Beckett threw the season's first no-hitter on 
May 25, and was 2-0 for the week with a 2.57 ERA. Wainwright had the same 
won-loss record but boasted a 0.00 ERA, and led the Major Leagues with 
21 strikeouts, 1 walk in 17 IP with nine strikeouts coming in his one-hitter 
shutout, and the other 12 in eight scoreless innings. He became the first 
NL pitcher to get to eight wins, and currently leads all Major League starting 
pitchers with a 1.67 ERA.[63] In the middle game of the three-game series 
with the New York Yankees on May 27, Lance Lynn threw his first complete 
game and first shutout, in a 6-0 win. He had started 74 games previously 
before throwing his five-hit shutout gem. He walked three and struck out 
only two, but avoided his typical one bad inning in many prior starts, 
throwing a career high 126 pitches. The losing pitcher on the Yankees was 
native St. Louisan David Phelps now 1-2, from Hazelwood, Missouri, pitching 
in his home park for the first time. Lynn won his 40th career win against 
20 losses for a sterling .667 winning percentage, and a 3.72 ERA. The Cardinals 
are the first team in the Major Leagues with three six-game winners: Lynn 
(6), Wainwright (8), and Shelby Miller (6). The nine shutouts tie the Texas 
Rangers for the lead in that category.[64] The #2 Prospect in all of MLB, 
outfielder Oscar Taveras, 21, was recalled to the majors for the first 
time after the May 30 game, with Matt Adams placed on the 15-day disabled 
list.[65][66] He was promptly placed in the lineup on May 31 at home, batting 
sixth, playing right field. He was hitting .325/.373/.524 at Memphis, with 
7 HR, 40 RBI, in 49 G and 191 ABs. On a Saturday afternoon May 31, 2014, 
Taveras, in his second career at bat (after a fly out) with one out in 
the bottom of the fifth inning, hit his first career hit, a home run to 
right field against San Francisco Giants' starter Yusmeiro Petit, in the 
rain which immediately afterward forced the first rain delay (47 min., 
later a 51 min. delay) of the game. He struck out in his third at-bat, 
but the Cardinals won 2-0.[67] Despite the win on May 31, the team hit 
only 11 HRs in May, compared to 19 in March/April, for a total of only 
30, ranking 15th and last in the NL. The Cardinals did hit better in May 
with a .266 BA compared to .246 in March/April. With Runners-in-Scoring-Position, 
they hit .256 in May compared to a pitiful .226 in March/April. They scored 
an average of 4.2 runs/game in May compared to 3.6 in March/April. The 
Starters' ERA ballooned to 3.74 in May compared to 2.48 in March/April, 
and the Relievers' ERA also increased to 4.06 in May compared to 3.73 in 
March/April, according to a graphic shown on Fox Sports Midwest after the 
May 31 game. The team won in 11 innings against Kansas City at Kauffman 
Stadium on June 4 for a 31-29 (.517) won-loss record, bringing them to 
four games back of the Milwaukee Brewers. This happened after suffering 
a blown 6–0 lead in an eventual 8–7 loss in St. Louis on June 3, after 
a humiliating 6–0 shutout loss the night before in getting only three hits. 
Matt Carpenter got his fifth hit, a double, his second of the game in the 
top of the inning that drove in the go-ahead run in the eventual 5-2 win 
after a Trevor Rosenthal blown save attempt for Adam Wainwright in the 
bottom of the ninth with a 2-0 lead and no outs. Wainwright would have 
been the first nine-game winner in the NL, but remained tied for the lead 
with eight. Mark Buehrle (Toronto Blue Jays) led the majors with 10 wins. 
It was the first five-hit game of Carpenter's career, and with a walk, 
a perfect night. His average jumped from .292 to .307, 11th in the NL. 
He was hitting only .256 on May 17, but his 14-game hitting streak (ended 
on June 2), plus his two-game hit streak since, added 51 points. His .395 
on-base average (7th in NL) was the same as his slugging percentage. Carpenter 
became the first Cardinals' player to record a five-hit game since Ryan 
Ludwick on September 4, 2009. He led the NL with 73 hits, was fifth with 
40 runs scored, and eighth in doubles with 16. Pat Neshek got his first 
major league save in 255 games.[68][69] The team turned a triple play against 
the Toronto Blue Jays off the bat of José Bautista at Rogers Centre in 
the sixth inning on June 6. It was the first in nine years (May 5, 2005) 
for the Cardinals, against the San Diego Padres.[70] The pitchers threw 
three consecutive scoreless games June 7–8, and 10, giving them 13 for 
the season in leading the majors. It was the most in franchise history 
after 65 games, beating the 1968 Cardinals who had 11 at that point while 
on their way to an NL-leading 30.[71] Double-A Springfield Cardinals sensational 
starting LH-pitcher Marco Gonzales, the club's #4 prospect in the minors, 
a standout for his changeup and his command (3-2, 2.33 ERA in 7 G, 38.2 
IP, 33 H, 2 HR, 10 W, 46 SO), made the long jump to make his major league 
debut on June 25, at Coors Field against the Colorado Rockies, near where 
he grew up in Fort Collins. He pitched five innings, facing 24 batters, 
giving up seven hits, two walks, a home run, and five runs, while striking 
out three, including two in the first inning, including NL-batting leader 
Troy Tulowitski (.353). He doubled in his first at-bat, and scored the 
game's first run. Leaving after five innings with the team trailing 5-1, 
the team rallied for five runs over the last three innings, and won the 
game, 9-6 with Pat Neshek getting his second win of the season.[72] The 
game was the first for the Cardinals since 1980 to receive four sacrifice 
flys.[73] Gonzales became the first Cardinals' starter to make his debut 
without playing at the Triple A level since Cliff Politte in April 1998.[74] 
At the half-way point of the season on June 27, after 81 games the Cardinals 
are 44-37 (.543) with 306 runs scored, and 274 runs allowed. Last year 
(2013), the Cardinals scored 783 runs, with 596 runs allowed. On July 2, 
Adam Wainwright became the NL's first 11-game winner, pitching 7.2 innings 
in shutting out the San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park, 2-0, giving up only 
four hits all singles, walking two, but striking out only one in the seventh 
inning. He also lowered his ERA from 2.01 to 1.89 taking the NL-lead on 
that category after 124 innings for the season. The start was Wainwright's 
eighth scoreless of 17 total starts against opponents going at least seven 
innings.[75] Starting pitcher Jaime García announced on July 5, he will 
have season-ending surgery to correct the thoracic outlet syndrome condition. 
It is the same nerve condition that caused the end of former pitcher Chris 
Carpenter's career with the Cardinals.[76] The Cardinals, and all 30 teams, 
had their schedules released by Major League Baseball on September 10, 
2013. The Cardinals' Opening Day game will be away against the Cincinnati 
Reds on March 31.[77] It will be broadcast on ESPN along with others that 
day.[78] Regular Season Schedule (calendar style) Regular Season Schedule

Forbes released their annual valuation list of all Major League franchises 
and placed the Cardinals eighth. Their estimated value of $820 million 
was an increase of more than $100 million from the season before, when 
they ranked tenth. St. Louis' revenue in 2013 was $283 million, with an 
operating income of $65.2 million.[82][83] Cardinals Front Office The Cardinals
