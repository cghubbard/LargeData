Bruce Neal Froemming (/ˈfrɛmɪŋ/; born September 28, 1939 in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin) is Major League Baseball Special Assistant to the Vice President 
on Umpiring, after having served as an umpire in Major League Baseball. 
He is the longest-tenured umpire in major league history in terms of the 
number of full seasons umpired, finishing his 37th season in 2007.[1] He 
first umpired in the National League in 1971, and from 2000 to 2007 worked 
throughout both major leagues. Early in the 2007 season, Froemming tied 
Bill Klem for the most seasons umpired (Klem's final season, 1941, included 
only 11 games as a substitute).[1] Previously, on August 16, 2006, Froemming 
umpired his 5,000th game between the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox 
at Fenway Park, making him the second umpire to reach that milestone; Klem 
retired after 5,374 games.[2] On April 20, 2007, he umpired at first base 
in the Cleveland Indians-Tampa Bay Devil Rays game, passing Klem to become 
– at age 67 years 204 days – the man then believed to be the oldest umpire 
in major league history; Hank O'Day holds the record, retiring at 68 years, 
2 months. He worked his final regular-season game at age 68 years 2 days 
on September 30, 2007, when Froemming received a standing ovation before 
umpiring his last regular-season game, manning the third base position 
as the Milwaukee Brewers hosted the San Diego Padres at Miller Park in 
his native Milwaukee, with much of his family in attendance.[3] Because 
Froemming is over age 65, he became eligible for election to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 2010 instead of having to wait the customary five years. 
After a brief semi-pro playing career, Froemming became the youngest umpire 
in professional baseball in 1958 at age 18, working his way up through 
the minor leagues to the Pacific Coast League before joining the NL staff 
in April 1971. While in the minor leagues, his work had caught the attention 
of skilled observers such as Hall of Famer Jocko Conlan. Froemming became 
one of the NL's six crew chiefs in 1988. He also refereed high school basketball 
games, and was recommended for the NBA by Al McGuire, but declined the 
opportunity when NL umpire Al Barlick helped him in his advancement to 
the major leagues.[4] In Froemming's first season, he was on Barlick's 
crew. In Barlick's first season, 1941, he worked three games with Klem.[5] 
Froemming worked in 5 World Series: 1976, 1984, 1988, 1990 (Games 3–4) 
and 1995. He umpired in the League Championship Series in 1973, 1977, 1980, 
1982, 1985, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1997 and 2000, all in the NL. With his tenth 
appearance in the LCS in 2000, he broke the record he had previously shared 
with Doug Harvey; Jerry Crawford tied the record in 2003, and broke it 
with his 11th LCS in 2005. (Froemming and Crawford share the record of 
10 NLCS, as two of Crawford's 12 were in the American League.) Froemming 
also officiated in a record 9 Division Series: 1981 (East Division), 1995, 
1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2007 (all but the last in the NL). 
He was the home plate umpire for the playoff games to determine the NL 
wild-card team in both 1998 and 1999. He also umpired in the All-Star Game 
in 1975 (played at County Stadium in his hometown of Milwaukee), 1986, 
and 2007, calling balls and strikes for the last two contests.[6] In the 
2003 NLDS, Froemming surpassed Klem's record of working in 103 career postseason 
games (all Klem's games were in the World Series), ending the series with 
107 games; Jerry Crawford passed him with 108 games upon working in the 
2006 ALCS, but Froemming regained the record in the 2007 ALDS. He ended 
his career having officiated in 22 World Series games, 52 NLCS games and 
37 Division Series games, a total of 111 postseason games. In Game 1 of 
the 2012 World Series, Gerry Davis (umpire) surpassed Froemming's record 
when he worked his 112th postseason game. So far, Davis has 122 postseason 
games worked. Froemming was known for his extremely loud and enthusiastic 
strike call. He wore uniform number 6 beginning in the late 1970s, and 
kept the number when the umpiring staffs of the AL and NL were merged in 
2000. Los Angeles Times sports editor Bill Dwyre described him as "one 
of the game's true characters and legends," also calling him the prototypical 
umpire: "If Hollywood did a movie, they'd send 27 yuppies to study him.[4] 
Often regarded as stern and stubborn, Froemming nonetheless occasionally 
displayed a sense of humor; when Fox Sports wired umpires with microphones 
for broadcasts of Saturday games in 2007, Froemming looked toward the huge 
baseball glove beyond AT&T Park's outfield wall and wondered aloud whether 
Fox analyst Eric Karros had ever hit a ball that far.[7] For his final 
season, Froemming's crew included Brian Runge, the son of Paul Runge, who 
served on the NL staff from 1973 to 1997; Froemming has recalled that he 
used to baby-sit for Brian.[4] Froemming was also associated with the Joe 
Brinkman umpire school in Cocoa, Florida, which was renamed the Brinkman/Froemming 
umpire school several years prior to its closing in 1998. Froemming was 
the plate umpire (wearing number 16) when Milt Pappas was going for a perfect 
game on September 2, 1972 against the San Diego Padres, but made a controversial 
ball four call on the 27th batter, Larry Stahl, which cost Pappas the perfect 
game, though he still pitched a no-hitter. The call remains controversial.[8] 
Froemming was the first base umpire (wearing number 5) when he ejected 
New York Yankees manager Billy Martin in Game Four of the 1976 World Series 
in the top of the ninth inning, the first World Series managerial ejection 
since Earl Weaver's toss by umpire Shag Crawford in the 1969 World Series.[9] 
Froemming is reviled in Philadelphia to this day for a call in the 1977 
National League Championship Series.[10][11] In Game 3 of the series, the 
Philadelphia Phillies led the Los Angeles Dodgers by a run with two outs 
in the ninth with Manny Mota on third. Davey Lopes hit a smash that struck 
third baseman Mike Schmidt in the knee and caromed to shortstop Larry Bowa, 
who fired to first. Lopes was called safe, and the Dodgers went on to win 
the game and the series in four games. On September 3, 2001, Froemming 
was the second base umpire for the no-hitter pitched by Bud Smith of the 
St. Louis Cardinals. That game marked the record 11th time he had umpired 
in an official no-hitter; he had previously shared the record of 10 with 
Silk O'Loughlin, Paul Pryor and Jim McKean. On September 26, 1981, he was 
behind the plate for Nolan Ryan's record 5th no-hitter. Froemming did eventually 
work a perfect game, as the first base umpire for Dennis Martínez' gem 
on July 28, 1991. Two days earlier, he also umpired in what would have 
been a 12th no-hitter, but Montreal's Mark Gardner surrendered three hits 
in the 10th inning and lost; under current guidelines, baseball does not 
recognize games of nine hitless innings as no-hitters if hits are given 
up in extra innings. In April 2001, Froemming was the home plate umpire 
for the first game at Miller Park in his hometown of Milwaukee. On July 
24, 2004, he was the plate umpire in the famous game between the New York 
Yankees and Boston Red Sox that involved a brawl initiated by Jason Varitek's 
punch of Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez which resulted in both players 
getting ejected by Froemming. The game ended with a dramatic 2-run walk-off 
home run by Sox 3rd baseman Bill Mueller for an 11-10 win. On June 28, 
2007, Froemming was at first base when Toronto Blue Jay Frank Thomas hit 
his 500th career home run off Minnesota Twins pitcher Carlos Silva. Later 
in the game, Thomas was ejected by plate umpire Mark Wegner for arguing 
balls and strikes, with Toronto manager John Gibbons also getting thrown 
out.[12] A commanding presence on the field who was fined by National League 
and Major League Baseball on more than one occasion for his public comments 
and behavior, Froemming has acknowledged that "the one moment I would take 
back if I could" was in January 2003 when he referred to an umpire administrator 
as a "stupid Jew bitch" during a dispute over a relatively minor conflict 
over travel arrangements to Japan; the comment was made at the end of a 
voice-mail message, apparently after Froemming thought the call had ended.[2] 
He was given a 10-day suspension without pay for the incident, which he 
accepted after making a public apology. Froemming was also fined in 1996 
for going into the Los Angeles Dodgers' clubhouse before a game in New 
York against the Mets to get Mike Piazza's autograph.[13] Froemming told 
Piazza that catcher Johnny Bench refused to sign baseballs for him once 
and proceeded to go 0 for 4 that day with three strikeouts.[14] New York 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner blamed Froemming for not delaying Game 
2 of the 2007 American League Division Series between the Yankees and the 
Cleveland Indians, in which an infestation of Lake Erie gnats swarmed around 
Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain, who afterward lost a 1–0 lead in the 
8th inning. Froemming was calling balls and strikes on September 2, 1972, 
when Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas had a perfect game with two outs and a 1–2 
count in the ninth inning before walking the 27th batter (pinch-hitter 
Larry Stahl); Pappas then completed the no-hitter, but later criticized 
Froemming for wasting his chance at immortality. The umpire notes, "It's 
gotten ugly now. Right after the game, he said the 3–2 pitch had missed, 
but as time has gone on, that pitch has gotten better and better." Froemming 
umpired in a record 11 official no-hitters in the major leagues: It's great 
to see a young umpire like that. He's a nice boy, conscientious, hardworking, 
a million-dollar heart. And guts. They told me that he put an announcer 
out of the ball park one night in Tulsa. The announcer made some remark 
or other over the public address system about the umpire. Froemming stopped 
the game, turned to the announcer and said, 'Get out.' When I heard about 
that, I said, 'This is something.' I'd like to see that, making an announcer 
leave the ball park. The sun is 93 million miles away, and I can see that. 
For him, it's a calling, not a job. Something like holy orders. A sacrament,
