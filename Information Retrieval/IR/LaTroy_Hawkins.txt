LaTroy Hawkins (born December 21, 1972) is an American former professional 
baseball relief pitcher. In his 21-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, 
he played for the Minnesota Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Francisco Giants, 
Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees, Houston Astros, 
Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, New York Mets, and Toronto 
Blue Jays. At the time of his retirement, Hawkins was the only active player 
to be a member of the 1,000-games-pitched club, and at 42 years of age, 
was the oldest active player in MLB. Born and raised in Gary, Indiana, 
Hawkins attended West Side High School. Aside from baseball, Hawkins also 
competed in basketball and football.[1] Hawkins was drafted straight out 
of high school by the Minnesota Twins in the 1991 amateur draft, and spent 
the next four years in the Twins' minor league system. His major league 
debut early in the 1995 season was a disastrous start against the Baltimore 
Orioles, where he gave up seven earned runs in only an inning and two thirds 
of work. During his brief stint in the Majors during 1995, Hawkins made 
6 starts with a 2–3 record and an 8.67 ERA. Hawkins bounced between the 
big league club and Salt Lake of the PCL between 1996 and 1997, compiling 
a 7–13 record in those years. By the 1998 season, Hawkins was inserted 
into the Twins rotation. He led the team with 33 starts but also led the 
team in most runs allowed (126), walks (70) and the worst WHIP among Twins 
starters (1.53). He was the opposing starting pitcher during the perfect 
game by Yankees pitcher David Wells on May 17, 1998. In 1999, Hawkins suffered 
one of the worst statistical season in the majors and in his career. His 
6.66 ERA was the worst in the Majors among starters with at least 30 starts. 
He was tied with Brad Radke for most losses on the team and allowed the 
most home runs on the pitching staff. By the year 2000, Hawkins was in 
the Twins bullpen, appearing in 66 games while sporting an ERA of 3.39 
along with 14 saves. 2001 saw Hawkins revert to poorness, having one of 
the worst statistical seasons for a closer in the history of the MLB. He 
led the Twins in saves (28) but he had 5.96 ERA while having a WHIP of 
1.91 in 61 games. Hawkins rebounded the next two seasons, combining to 
pitch in 139 games while being replaced as closer by Eddie Guardado. He 
also had ERA's of 2.13 and 1.86 respectively. Hawkins became a free agent 
after the 2003 season. Hawkins drew interest from a number of teams before 
signing a three-year, $11 million deal with the Chicago Cubs after the 
2003 season. Hawkins was signed by the Cubs to pitch the 8th inning to 
set up for Joe Borowski, but Borowski went down with an injury early in 
the season, and Hawkins took over closing duties. On September 11, Hawkins 
struck out the side on only nine pitches in a game against the Florida 
Marlins. Despite a better-than-average ERA of 2.63 on the year and 25 saves, 
Hawkins blew 9 saves on the year, including two during a late-September 
skid that cost the Cubs the wild card. These blown saves earned him the 
ire of Cubs fans, who made a habit of booing him loudly at Wrigley Field 
when he came on in relief. Hawkins appeared in 21 games for the Cubs in 
2005 before being traded to the Giants. When Hawkins came back in 2005 
as a member of the San Francisco Giants the Cub fans chanted "Hawkins Sucks!" 
which angered then manager Dusty Baker and first baseman Derrek Lee. On 
May 28, 2005 the Cubs traded Hawkins to the San Francisco Giants in exchange 
for pitchers Jerome Williams and David Aardsma. Upon arrival in San Francisco, 
Hawkins was initially converted back into a set-up role, with the team 
cautiously optimistic about a return to form. However, Hawkins only showed 
brief flashes of his previous ability en route to a league-average performance 
for the Giants. Between the Cubs & Giants, Hawkins 2005 record was 2–8 
in 66 games. He had more hits than innings pitched while having a WHIP 
of 1.46. Following the 2005 season, Hawkins was traded to the Baltimore 
Orioles for left-handed reliever Steve Kline. He spent one season with 
the Orioles, going 3–2 with a 4.48 ERA in 60 games. He became a free agent 
after the season. On December 5, 2006, Hawkins signed a one-year, $3.25 
million contract with the Colorado Rockies. On July 8, 2007, Hawkins was 
the only Colorado player to help the groundskeepers and the entire Philadelphia 
ballclub with the tarp during a heavy storm in Denver.[2] Despite pitching 
in the hitter-friendly Coors Field, he posted a 3.42 ERA in 62 appearances, 
including a scoreless 7th inning in the wild card playoff against San Diego. 
Hawkins gave up only one run and two hits in five innings of postseason 
work for the National League champions. Hawkins was part of the Rockies 
team that went to the World Series for the first time ever but ended up 
losing the series to the Boston Red Sox after only 4 games. On December 
9, 2007, Hawkins signed a one-year contract with the New York Yankees, 
reportedly worth $3.75 million. He became the first player since outfielder 
Paul O'Neill to wear the jersey number 21 for the Yankees. [3] However, 
after returning from a road trip on April 16, he changed his number to 
22 in response to the fans' booing, yelling, and calling O'Neill's name 
when he took the field.[4] On May 20, 2008, during a game vs. the Baltimore 
Orioles, Hawkins threw a head-high pitch over left fielder Luke Scott. 
Hawkins was ejected by home plate umpire Chuck Meriwether and Scott accused 
him for throwing the ball over his head. Hawkins was suspended for 3 games 
and fined an undisclosed amount.[5] Hawkins was designated for assignment 
on July 26. During his time with the Yankees in 2008, Hawkins made 33 relief 
appearances going 1–1 with a 5.71 ERA. On July 30, 2008 the Houston Astros 
acquired Hawkins from the Yankees for minor leaguer Matt Cusick.[6] Hawkins 
was an integral part of the Astros' late-season run, pitching 21 innings 
out of the bullpen and allowing just one earned run over that span (good 
for an ERA of 0.43). Hawkins signed a 1-year deal with the Astros to return 
for the 2009 season.[7] Hawkins continued his success in Houston, sporting 
an ERA of 2.13 in 65 games, the lowest ERA he had since 2003. He also saved 
11 games. After the 2009 season, Hawkins left as a free agent. On December 
16, 2009, Hawkins signed a deal with the Milwaukee Brewers for 2 years 
and $7.5 million.[8] In 2010, he was 0–3 while only appearing in 18 games 
due to injury.[9] In 2011, he was 3–1 with a 2.42 ERA in 52 games.[10] 
Through 2011, he was third of all active pitchers in career games pitched 
(823) behind Arthur Rhodes and Mariano Rivera.[10] The Angels and LaTroy 
Hawkins agreed to terms on a one-year contract for the 2012 season.[11] 
Hawkins earned three million dollars, going 2–3 with a 3.64 ERA. LaTroy 
Hawkins signed a minor league deal with invitation to spring training with 
New York Mets on January 31, 2013. He ended up making the team, pitching 
in 72 games and ending the season with a 3–2 record and 13 saves (his most 
since 2004 with the Cubs) with a 2.93 ERA. Hawkins signed a one-year, $2.5 
million contract to return to the Colorado Rockies on November 19, 2013, 
pending a physical.[12] The contract became official on November 22, 2013.[13] 
Hawkins was named the Rockies' closer for the 2014 season and finished 
the year with a 3.31 ERA and 23 saves in 26 opportunities. On September 
27, 2014, Hawkins made his 1,000th career appearance in a game the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and promptly got Darwin Barney to fly out to right field. 
On December 12, 2014, Hawkins announced that 2015 would be his last season 
in the MLB during an interview on MLB Network. He struggled out of the 
gates in 2015, pitching to a 10.50 ERA in 7 games and recording only one 
save before heading to the disabled list. Shortly before his injury, Adam 
Ottavino replaced him as the closer. On July 28, 2015, Hawkins and teammate 
Troy Tulowitzki were traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for José Reyes, Jeff 
Hoffman, Miguel Castro, and Jesus Tinoco.[14] On August 5, Hawkins became 
the 13th player in MLB history to record a save against all 30 teams, closing 
out a 9-7 win over the Minnesota Twins.[15] He also surpassed Darren Oliver 
as the oldest Blue Jay to record a save.[16] Hawkins made 18 regular season 
appearances for the Blue Jays, pitching to a 1–0 record, 2.76 ERA, and 
14 strikeouts in 16 1⁄3 innings.[10] On October 25, Hawkins announced his 
retirement.[17] Hawkins is good friends with former MLB outfielder Torii
