The 1969 Atlanta Braves season was a season in American baseball. The National 
League had been split into two divisions before the season, with the Braves 
somewhat incongruously being assigned to the National League West. The 
Braves finished with a record of 93–69, winning the first ever NL West 
division title by three games over the San Francisco Giants. After the 
season, the Braves played in the first-ever inter-divisional National League 
Championship Series. They went on to lose the NLCS to the eventual World 
Champion New York Mets, three games to none. The 1969 season marked the 
first year of divisional play in Major League Baseball. The Braves (along 
with the Cincinnati Reds) were placed in the National League West division, 
despite being located further east than the two westernmost teams in the 
new National League East, the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. This 
was because the New York Mets wanted to be in the same division as the 
reigning power in the NL, which were the Cardinals at the time (to compensate 
for playing against the Dodgers and Giants fewer times each season). The 
Cubs consequently demanded to be in the NL East as well in order to continue 
playing in the same division as the Cardinals, one of the Cubs' biggest 
rivals. Second baseman Félix Millán started the All-Star Game, along with 
right fielder Hank Aaron, and won his first Gold Glove. Infielders Coaches
