Michael Eugene Reilly (born July 2, 1949) is a former Major League Baseball 
umpire who worked in the American League from 1977 to 1999 and throughout 
both major leagues from 2000-2010. Upon Ed Montague's retirement in February 
2010, Reilly became Major League Baseball's senior umpire; his 4,362 career 
games ranked ninth in major league history entering the 2010 season. He 
retired on February 23, 2011, along with fellow umpires Jerry Crawford 
and Chuck Meriwether.[1] Reilly umpired in the World Series in 1984, 1992, 
2002 and 2007, and in the All-Star Game in 1982, 1993, 2000, and 2010, 
calling balls and strikes for the last two contests. He also officiated 
in nine League Championship Series (1983, 1987, 1991, 1996, 1997, 2001, 
2003, 2006, 2008) and six Division Series (1981, 1995, 1999, 2000, 2002, 
2007). He also umpired in the 1976 Caribbean World Series. Reilly wore 
the uniform number 31 after the American League adopted numbers in 1980. 
He continued to wear the number when umpires were combined into a single 
staff under the supervision of Major League Baseball in 2000. Along with 
Steve Palermo, Reilly was one of the first American League umpires to never 
use the outside chest protector. Reilly and Palermo came to the junior 
circuit in 1977, the year the AL mandated all new umpires on staff would 
have to use the inside chest protector, which had been in use in the National 
League for decades. Umpires on staff prior to 1977 were grandfathered and 
could continue to wear the outside protector. Reilly was the third base 
umpire for David Wells' perfect game on May 17, 1998. He is famous for 
being on the October 26 cover of Sports Illustrated where he called Roberto 
Alomar of the Toronto Blue Jays out at home in Game 2 of the 1992 World 
Series when replay appeared to show Alomar as safe. Reilly was the second 
base umpire for Mark Buehrle's no-hitter against the Texas Rangers on April 
18, 2007.[2] Reilly received an associate degree from K.C.C. Junior College 
in 1970. He is a member of the Board of Directors for Big Brothers/Big 
Sisters and works with the Food Bank South Central Michigan. He was elected 
to St. Philip Catholic Central Hall of Fame in 1999 and is recognized by 
American Amateur Baseball as a consultant. He became interested in umpiring 
after taking a sports officiating class in college. His proudest moment 
as a major league umpire was working his first World Series (1984) in his 
home state. He coaches basketball at St. Philip/St. Joseph in the offseason 
and his hobbies include hunting, fishing, golfing and following the University 
of Notre Dame. Reilly was raised and still resides in Battle Creek, Michigan, 
the breakfast cereal capital of the world (a fact which prompted longtime 
baseball broadcaster Ernie Harwell to nickname him "Corn Flakes Reilly"). 
Reilly's wife Mary graduated from the University of Michigan and is currently 
an elementary teacher. Together they have four children: Katie, Ryan, Patrick 
and Conor. Katie attended Michigan State and now lives in Florida. Ryan 
attended Albion College, and played baseball for the Britons. Patrick attends 
Western Michigan, and Conor recently graduated from St. Philip Catholic 
Central High School, where Mike Reilly graduated in 1968. His nephew Brian
