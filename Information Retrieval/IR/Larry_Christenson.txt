Larry Richard 'L.C.' Christenson (November 10, 1953 in Everett, Washington), 
is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played his entire 
career for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1973–1983. During his high school 
years, Larry was noted more for his basketball than baseball skill. After 
graduating from Marysville High School in 1972, Larry began his career 
with the Philadelphia Phillies as their number one draft pick in June of 
that year. He was the third pick in the first round of all college and 
high school players. Larry’s first minor and major league hits were home 
runs and he is tied with Rick Wise for most home runs (11) by a pitcher 
in Phillies history. Christenson made his major-league debut on April 13, 
1973, and beat the New York Mets 7–1, pitching a complete game.[1] At the 
time, he was the youngest player in the Major Leagues at 19; he would remain 
so until 18-year-old David Clyde debuted for the Texas Rangers on June 
27 of that same season. He would bounce back and forth from the majors 
to the minor leagues until 1975, when the Phillies called him up to stay. 
Christenson went 11–6 that season and would become a key cog on the Phillies' 
teams that would win three straight National League Eastern Division titles 
from 1976 to 1978. He would have his best seasons those three years, going 
13–8 with a 3.68 earned run average in 1976. His best season was 1977, 
when he went 19–6 with a 4.06 ERA, winning 15 of his last 16 decisions. 
He slipped to 13–14 in 1978, despite posting a career-best ERA of 3.24, 
and started Game 1 of the 1978 National League Championship Series. Then, 
injuries would begin to plague Christenson's career. He began the 1979 
season on the disabled list with elbow problems and missed the first month. 
Then, in June of that season, he broke his collarbone during a charity 
bicycle ride and missed several weeks. He ended up with a 5–10 record that 
season. In 1980, he started 3–0, but went on the disabled list again and 
had elbow surgery. He recovered to finish the season 5–1 and start Game 
4 of the 1980 World Series, but was knocked in the first inning. In 1981, 
Christenson posted a less-than-stellar 4–7 record, but posted a win in 
the 1981 National League Division Series against the Montreal Expos. His 
last injury-free season was 1982, when he made 32 starts and went 9–10. 
In 1983, Christenson went under the knife for elbow surgery for the final 
time after a 2–4 start. He failed to make the postseason roster and the 
Phillies gave him his unconditional release on November 10 of that year, 
his 30th birthday. Christensen tried for several years, spent in his home 
state of Washington, to rehabilitate from his numerous surgeries, but he 
was unable to return to baseball. He began a career in institutional investing 
in 1985. He currently is president of Christenson Investment Partners which 
works with institutional asset managers and investors, and resides in the 
Philadelphia area. He has two daughters; Claire, age 21, and Libby, age 
23. He maintains his ties with the Phillies and is well known locally for
