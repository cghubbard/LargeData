As player As manager Tomoaki Kanemoto (金本 知憲, Kanemoto Tomoaki?, born April 
3, 1968 in Minami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan) is the manager of the Hanshin Tigers 
baseball team in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). In his career as a 
player he spent 11 years with the Hiroshima Carp before moving to the Tigers 
in 2003, where he spent another 10 years. He holds the world record for 
consecutive games played without missing an inning (1492, ending on April 
18, 2010). The Tigers' former cleanup hitter, Kanemoto is regarded as one 
of the most accomplished hitters in Japanese professional baseball history. 
His 476 career home runs are the most by a left-handed hitter who throws 
right-handed and tenth overall on the all-time NPB list. Kanemoto retired 
as a player at the end of the 2012 season[1] and rejoined the Tigers as 
their manager for the 2016 season, replacing Yutaka Wada.[2] At the time 
of his retirement, Kanemoto was ninth on the all-time hit list for Japanese 
players across Japan and MLB. He is now 10th on the all-time list in both 
hits and home runs. Kanemoto was born in Minami-ku, Hiroshima, as a third-generation 
Korean (he obtained Japanese citizenship in 2001). He began playing baseball 
in the fourth grade for the Hiroshima Central Little League club, but quit 
the team after a year because he could not keep up during team practices. 
After playing both baseball and softball for various teams while attending 
junior high, Kanemoto enrolled in Koryo High School,[3] where he became 
the team's cleanup hitter in his second year (the equivalent of eleventh 
grade in the United States) and played in the outfield as well as at third 
base and pitcher. Although Koryo High had a reputation as a baseball powerhouse, 
they failed to reach any national tournaments in Kanemoto's three years 
there. He hit 20 home runs during his high school career. Kanemoto earned 
a spot in the starting lineup in his first year at Tohoku Fukushi University. 
His team, which consisted of notable players like pitchers Kazuhiro Sasaki 
and Takashi Saito, catcher Akihiro Yano, outfielder Koji Otsuka and shortstop/second 
baseman Chihiro Hamana, all of whom would later go on to the pros, earned 
berths in four consecutive All-Japan University Baseball Championship Series. 
(Kanemoto and Yano work together on the Tigers bench today.) Though they 
lost in the third round against Kinki University in the 38th annual tournament 
in 1989 (Kanemoto's sophomore year), they were the runners-up in the 37th 
and 39th tournaments (in 1988 and 1990, respectively), and won their first 
national title in the 40th annual tournament in 1991, Kanemoto's senior 
year. Following the tournament, Kanemoto was chosen to play in the 20th 
U.S.–Japan Collegiate All-Star Baseball Games, sharing a room with then-Toyo 
University outfielder Shinjiro Hiyama, whom he would also later become 
teammates with upon joining the Tigers, during the series. Kanemoto was 
picked in the fourth round of the 1991 NPB draft by the Hiroshima Toyo 
Carp.[4] Kanemoto showed little promise in his first two seasons in the 
pros, falling behind as younger hitters like Tomonori Maeda and Akira Etoh 
began to make names for themselves at the ichigun (Japanese equivalent 
of "major league") level. He showed so little power that hitting coaches 
would tell him to try to slap the ball and use his speed to get on base 
more and earned the rather unflattering nickname "Mole Killer" for his 
habit of throwing the ball into the ground when trying to make a strong 
throw on the defensive end. Frustrated by his shortcomings and realizing 
that he would be soon released from the team if he did not improve dramatically, 
Kanemoto began a rigorous weight training regimen and, with the help of 
then-coach Kazuyoshi Yamamoto, made his way into the starting lineup in 
the later half of the 1994 season, hitting 17 home runs that year. He continued 
to make strides with his bat in 1995, hitting .274 with 24 home runs (including 
his first career grand slam off then-Tigers left-hander Toshiro Yufune 
on August 10) and earning his first Best Nine Award. Kanemoto hit over 
.300 for the first time in his career in 1996 as the Carp's No. 5 hitter, 
winning the Central League monthly Most Valuable Player award that September 
and hitting the first walk-off home run of his career off then-Swallows 
reliever Hiroto Kato on September 11. He added a career-high 33 home runs 
to the .300-plus average and drove in 82 RBI in 1997, but struggled in 
1998, hitting just .253 with 21 homers and 74 RBI. However, he rebounded 
from the down year by hitting .293 with 34 home runs and 94 RBIs (both 
career highs) in 1999, playing in all 136 games and hitting for the cycle 
on April 24 against the Chunichi Dragons. In 2000, Kanemoto was made the 
team's cleanup hitter by default after Etoh's departure for the Yomiuri 
Giants via free agency, and he responded by hitting .315 with 30 home runs 
and a career-high 30 stolen bases, becoming just the seventh player in 
NPB history to have a .300–30–30 (batting average, home runs, stolen bases) 
season.[5] The following season (2001), he set a new Japanese professional 
baseball record by going 1002 consecutive plate appearances without grounding 
into a double play and drew 128 walks, the fifth-highest single-season 
total in NPB history and the most by any player other than Sadaharu Oh. 
Kanemoto declared for free agency in the 2002 off-season. Despite recognizing 
that Kanemoto was an invaluable asset to the team, the low-budget Carp 
upheld their longtime policy of not pursuing any player of their own that 
opts to declare for free agency (an attempt by the Carp to hold down their 
payroll). After weeks of negotiations, Kanemoto eventually signed with 
the Central League rival Hanshin Tigers.[6] For the 2003 season, Kanemoto 
was given the uniform number 6 and appointed the Tigers' new No. 3 hitter 
amidst hopes that he would change the very culture of the Tigers organization, 
a perennial cellar-dweller that had finished last in the Central League 
four times in the last five years.[7] He committed himself to his new secondary 
role in the lineup, hitting just .289 with 19 home runs and 18 stolen bases 
but focusing on moving runners over and taking pitches so that teammate 
and fellow outfielder Norihiro Akahoshi could steal (he led the league 
with 61 stolen bases that year). Kanemoto played an integral role in leading 
the Tigers to their first league title in 18 years.[8] In the Japan Series 
that followed the regular season, he hit four home runs,[9] homering in 
three consecutive games and twice in one game[10] (all three tying the 
previous Japan Series record). However, the Tigers lost to the Hawks four 
games to three, failing to win the championship. In 2004, Kanemoto returned 
to the cleanup spot following the appointment of new manager Akinobu Okada. 
He hit the fourth walk-off home run of his career off then-Dragons ace 
Kenshin Kawakami on May 8 in a classic 1–0 pitchers' duel.[11] However, 
he was hit by a pitch by Dragons closer Hitoki Iwase on July 29, tearing 
the cartilage on his left wrist. While his streak of consecutive games 
played without missing an inning was thought to be in jeopardy, Kanemoto 
borrowed a lighter bat from teammate Teruyoshi Kuji and continued to play 
through the injury, setting a new Nippon Professional Baseball record of 
701 on August 1.[12] Despite such adversity, he put up some of his best 
numbers to date, hitting .317 with 34 home runs and a career-high 113 RBIs 
and leading the league in RBIs for the first time. Kanemoto began the 2005 
season well, hitting .291 in the month of April and following it up by 
hitting .404 with eight home runs and 29 RBIs in May, earning his second 
career monthly MVP award. His walk-off home run (the fifth such home run 
of his career) off reliever Yusaku Iriki in an interleague game against 
the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters on June 10[13] made him just the fourth 
player in NPB history to hit a home run against every team in both the 
Central and Pacific leagues. His home run on June 28 at Yonago Municipal 
Baseball Stadium gave him the distinction of having hit home runs in the 
most ballparks (32) of any active NPB player (Kazuhiro Yamauchi holds the 
all-time record with 39). Kanemoto reached several notable milestones this 
year, playing in 1000 consecutive games on August 11 against the Dragons, 
recording his 1000th run scored on August 25 and his 1000th RBI on September 
9 (both against the Carp). He also hit his 40th home run of the season 
on October 4, becoming the first Tigers player since Randy Bass in 1986 
to hit 40 home runs in a season and the first since the "Lucky Zone", the 
short porch in right field, was removed from Koshien Stadium. Kanemoto 
finished the year with career highs in every Triple Crown category, hitting 
.327 with 40 homers and 125 RBIs and leading the league in runs scored 
(120), total bases (344), slugging percentage (.615) and OPS (1.044) at 
the age of 37. He led the Tigers to another league titles and was voted 
the Central League Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career.[14][15] 
Kanemoto broke the world record held by Cal Ripken, Jr. for consecutive 
innings played of 8243 on March 31 2006, and set a new world record for 
consecutive games played without missing an inning with 904 on April 9 
in a game against the Yokohama BayStars (the previous record was also held 
by Ripken).[16][17] He reached his milestone 1000th consecutive game played 
without missing an inning on August 15 against the BayStars, finishing 
the season with a .303 average, 26 home runs and 98 RBI.[18] Kanemoto had 
somewhat of a down year in 2007, putting up 31 homers and 95 RBIs but batting 
just .265 and recording his lowest OPS (.843) since 1998. That the Tigers 
finished last in the NPB in team batting average and runs scored might 
also have been a contributing factor to the media's criticism of Kanemoto. 
As he chose to play through a meniscus tear to his left knee (a season-ending 
injury for many players), slowing him down both in the field and on the 
basepaths, some even alleged that Kanemoto was just "playing for his [consecutive 
games] streak" and that he was "hurting the team by continuing to play 
in such conditions" by taking playing time away from some of the Tigers' 
younger players. He underwent surgery on his left knee for the first time 
in his life in October.[19] Kanemoto recorded his 1999th career hit on 
April 6 2008, but did not get his 2000th hit (the 37th player to accomplish 
the feat in Japanese professional baseball history) until April 12 in a 
game against the BayStars.[20][21] His hitless stretch of three games and 
15 at-bats between his 1999th and 2000th career hit was an NPB record. 
(Incidentally, teammate Takahiro Arai, who played with Kanemoto on both 
the Carp and the Tigers, got his 1000th career hit in the same game.) He 
won his third monthly MVP award that June, hitting .413 with six home runs 
and 20 RBI. Though the Tigers narrowly lost the pennant race to the rival 
Giants, Kanemoto finished the season with a .307 average, 27 home runs 
and 108 RBI, bouncing back from a disappointing 2007 campaign.[22][23] 
He underwent surgery on his knee for the second straight year during the 
off-season. Despite having to sit out virtually all of Spring training 
due to rehab of his left knee, Kanemoto went on a torrid streak to begin 
the 2009 season,[24] hitting .521 with eight home runs and 25 RBIs and 
slugging 1.146 through the first twelve games of the season. He homered 
in the Tigers' season opener against the Swallows on April 3, his 41st 
birthday, and hit three home runs in a game for the first time in his career 
on April 8 against the Carp,[25] making history when he repeated the feat 
on April 10 against the Giants and became the first player in NPB history 
to homer in three consecutive plate appearances twice in the same month.[26] 
Though he cooled down after his initial streak, he hit .379 with eight 
homers and 30 RBIs in April, setting a career high for RBIs in a single 
month, leading the Central League in all three Triple Crown categories 
and winning his fourth monthly MVP award. He also had three walk-off hits 
early in the season, a two-run double off Carp closer Katsuhiro Nagakawa 
on April 7, an RBI single off BayStars reliever Yuya Ishii on April 30, 
and a walk-off home run off Carp reliever Ryuji Yokoyama on May 12, the
