Alva Bradley II (February 28, 1884 â€“ March 30, 1953), was a businessman 
and baseball team executive. Bradley was born on February 28, 1884 to a 
wealthy family in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of M.A. Bradley and grandson 
of his namesake, Captain Alva Bradley. He graduated Cornell in 1908. He 
was president of the group that bought the Cleveland Indians in 1927 for 
$1 million, and which in 1946 sold the team to Bill Veeck. While he was 
the team's president, he was not the majority shareholder. Other members 
of the ownership group included his brother, Charles C. Bradley, with whom 
he invested $175,000, John Sherwin Sr. ($300,000), Percy Morgan ($200,000), 
Newton D. Baker ($25,000), attorney Joseph C. Hostetler ($25,000) and the 
Van Sweringen brothers ($250,000).[1] During his tenure the team signed 
teenage strikeout king Bob Feller in a controversial move that had to ultimately 
be resolved by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. During the 
1940 season Indian players, led by Mel Harder and Ken Keltner, came to 
him demanding that he fire team manager Ossie Vitt. The Indians were labeled 
"Crybabies" for doing so and lost the pennant race on the last day of the 
season. Bradley went out on a limb by hiring then 25-year-old Lou Boudreau 
as team manager. Bradley had a number of other business interests. He owned 
a real estate company and was president and treasurer of the United States 
Coal Company. He served on the boards of several Van Sweringen companies, 
the American Shipbuilding Company, Great Lakes Towing Company, and others, 
and was chairman of Cleveland Builders Supply Company. He was married to 
the former Marguerite Andrews and had four children: a son and three daughters.
