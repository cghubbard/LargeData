The Town of Randolph is a city in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United 
States. At the 2010 census, the town population was 32,158.[1] Randolph 
adopted a new charter effective January 2010 providing for a council-manager 
form of government instead of the traditional town meeting. Randolph is 
one of fourteen Massachusetts municipalities that have applied for, and 
been granted, city forms of government but wish to retain "The town of” 
in their official names.[3] It was called Cochaticquom by the local Cochato 
and Ponkapoag tribes. The town was incorporated in 1793 from what was formerly 
the south precinct of the town of Braintree. According to the centennial 
address delivered by John V. Beal, the town was named after Peyton Randolph, 
first president of the Continental Congress.[4] Randolph was formerly the 
home of several large shoe companies. Many popular styles were made exclusively 
in Randolph, including the "Randies". At the time of Randolph's incorporation 
in 1793, local farmers were making shoes and boots to augment household 
incomes from subsistence farming. In the next half century, this sideline 
had become the town's major industry, attracting workers from across New 
England, Canada and Ireland and later from Italy and Eastern Europe, each 
adding to the quality of life in the town. By 1850, Randolph had become 
one of the nation's leading boot producers, shipping boots as far away 
as California and Australia. The decline of the shoe industry at the beginning 
of the twentieth century led to Randolph's evolution as a suburban residential 
community. Boot and shoe making has been supplanted by light manufacturing 
and service industries. The town's proximity to major transportation networks 
has resulted in an influx of families from Boston and other localities 
who live in Randolph but work throughout the metropolitan area. Starting 
in the 1950s, Randolph saw significant growth in its Jewish community with 
the exodus of Jews from Boston's Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods. 
In 1950, fifteen or twenty Jewish families lived in the town; by 1970, 
Randolph had about 7,000 Jewish residents, and about 9,000 in 1980, the 
largest such community south of Boston. At its peak, Randolph boasted a 
kosher butcher, Judaica shop, kosher bakery, and two synagogues. By the 
early 1990s, the population shrank to about 6,000.[5][6] The inspiration 
for the nationally observed "smoke-out day" came from Randolph High School 
Guidance councilor Arthur Mullaney, who observed in a 1969 discussion with 
students that he could send all of them to college if he had a nickel for 
every cigarette butt he found on the ground. This touched off an effort 
by the Randolph HS class of 1970, supported by the Randolph Rotary Club, 
to have local smokers give it up for a day and put the savings toward a 
college scholarship fund. Smoke out day went national in 1976.[1] Randolph 
is home to Lombardo's Function Facility, which originated as the Chateau 
de Ville. The facility is famous for its large chandelier and spiral staircase.
