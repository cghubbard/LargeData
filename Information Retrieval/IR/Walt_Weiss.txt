As player As manager Walter William "Walt" Weiss (born November 28, 1963) 
is a former shortstop in Major League Baseball. He managed the Colorado 
Rockies from 2013 through 2016. Weiss was a member of the 1998 National 
League All-Star Team. He also won the 1988 Rookie of the Year award.[1] 
Initially drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 10th round of the 1982 
amateur draft, Weiss decided to put his professional baseball career on 
hold and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In June 
1985, he was the 12th overall pick in the 1985 draft. At the age of 23, 
he made his first major league appearance for the Oakland Athletics in 
September 1987. The club was impressed enough with the young shortstop's 
talent that they traded starter Alfredo Griffin that December, making him 
their starting shortstop for 1988. His offensive numbers were low (.250 
average, three home runs, 39 RBIs and 44 runs scored), but his defensive 
wizardry helped lead the A's to their first American League pennant since 
1974. The 1988 World Series was a rematch of the 1974 matchup, with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers winning the National League pennant. His costly error 
in Game 4 helped the Dodgers win the Series in five games, but he was voted 
American League Rookie of the Year for 1988 as the third consecutive Oakland 
player to win the award after sluggers Jos√© Canseco in 1986 and Mark McGwire 
in 1987. He also made the 1988 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster. In 1989 Weiss' 
offensive numbers didn't improve as he battled through injury and adversity 
even though the A's repeated as AL pennant winners, meeting their crosstown 
rival San Francisco Giants in the 1989 World Series. Although the Series 
would be overshadowed by the Loma Prieta earthquake on October 17 which 
delayed play for ten days, Weiss homered and the A's swept the Giants to 
claim their first world title in fifteen years. 1990 saw Weiss put up his 
best offensive numbers to date in hits, runs and batting average, while 
also stealing nine bases. The A's won their third straight pennant, but 
Weiss was injured in the 1990 American League Championship Series against 
the Boston Red Sox and missed Oakland's 1990 World Series loss to the Cincinnati 
Reds, four games to none. Limited by prior injuries, he didn't play much 
in 1991 as the A's missed the playoffs for the first time since 1987. In 
what would be his final year in Oakland, he hit .212 in 1992 and was traded 
to the new NL expansion Florida Marlins during the offseason.[2] He played 
in 158 games in 1993 for the Marlins, but after the season became a free 
agent, chose to sign with the Colorado Rockies (which like the Marlins 
were a new NL expansion team in 1993) and was the first player to play 
for both of these 1993 expansion teams. Weiss spent four modestly successful 
years with the bat in Colorado, posting career highs in home runs (8) and 
RBIs (48); but his strengths lay in solid defensive play at shortstop and 
ability to reach base (.351 lifetime OBP). In December 1997, he signed[3] 
with the Atlanta Braves and became their starting shortstop, hitting .280 
and making the All-Star team[4] for the only time in his career in 1998. 
The Braves finished with 106 wins but lost the NL pennant to the San Diego 
Padres, but he was slowed by injuries and appeared in less than a hundred 
games for the first time since 1991. The next season, his decline continued 
with a disappointing .226 batting average. In Game 3 of the 1999 NLDS against 
the Houston Astros, however, he made a stunning defensive play to save 
the season. In the bottom of the tenth, with the bases loaded, one out 
and the score tied, Tony Eusebio hit a sharp grounder up the middle. Weiss 
ranged hard to his left, fell on his stomach and threw to home for the 
force. After the game, he said the ball nearly ripped the glove off his 
hand. Weiss and the Braves went on to win the game, and with it the division 
series, on their way to the NL pennant and the 1999 World Series, which 
they lost to the New York Yankees. In 2000 he only had 192 at-bats, mostly 
due to losing the starting shortstop job to the emergent Rafael Furcal, 
who would go on to win Rookie of the Year just like Weiss twelve years 
prior. He retired after the season. Weiss' charitable contributions have 
included numerous donations to Watertown High School in Watertown, New 
York. In addition, the baseball field at his alma mater, Suffern High School, 
is named after him. After retiring from the Braves as a player following 
the 2000 season, he returned to the Rockies as a special instructor and 
adviser to the front office from 2002 to 2008. He left that job to spend 
more time with his family, but eventually returned to baseball as head 
varsity coach for Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado, where in 
his first season in that capacity he led the team to the 5A semifinals. 
Weiss was signed on November 7, 2012, to be the manager of the Colorado 
Rockies.[5] Weiss made the decision to step down as the manager of the 
Colorado Rockies after 4 managerial seasons with the club on Monday, October 
3rd, 2016 [6] He finished with a record of 283 wins and 365 losses.[7]
