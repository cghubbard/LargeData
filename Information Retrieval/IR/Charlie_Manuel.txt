As player As manager Charles Fuqua Manuel, Jr. (born January 4, 1944) is 
an American senior advisor for the Philadelphia Phillies, and a former 
professional baseball outfielder, coach and manager in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). During his playing career, 
he appeared over parts of six MLB seasons for the Minnesota Twins and Los 
Angeles Dodgers before playing another six seasons in NPB with the Yakult 
Swallows and Kintetsu Buffaloes. Over four successive seasons in NBP, he 
hit at least .312 with 37 home runs each season and won the 1979 Pacific 
League Most Valuable Player Award. After his playing career, Manuel coached 
and managed the Cleveland Indians and managed the Philadelphia Phillies, 
winning the World Series in 2008. He now serves as the senior advisor to 
the Phillies General Manager.[1] Although he was born in Iowa, his family 
was actually living in Virginia at that time, and he lived in Virginia 
throughout his childhood. He was born in an automobile while his mother, 
June, was visiting her mother.[2] His father, Charles Sr., was a Pentecostal 
preacher, and the family lived in Wythe and Grayson Counties until they 
settled in Buena Vista when Charlie, the third of 11 children and the oldest 
son, was 12.[2] He became a four-sport star at Parry McCluer High School 
in Buena Vista, playing baseball, football, basketball and track and field, 
captaining the baseball and basketball teams. His first love was basketball 
and he had received scholarship offers in that sport, but his plans and 
his life would dramatically change just before his high school graduation. 
In April 1963, his father committed suicide due to being severely ill with 
diabetes and heart problems. Leaving behind a suicide note, he asked that 
Charlie – who was already married with a child – take care of his mother 
and siblings.[2][3] He turned down his basketball scholarship offers, including 
one to the University of Pennsylvania,[4] to consider offers from the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and New York Yankees, ultimately 
signing with the Twins out of high school in 1963 for $30,000. Manuel played 
from 1969 to 1972 with the Minnesota Twins and in 1974 and 1975 with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers, primarily as a pinch-hitter and left fielder. Manuel's 
baseball career took off when he left the United States to play in Japan. 
Wildly popular for his tenacious style of play and his power-hitting abilities, 
Manuel was dubbed "Aka-Oni" (The Red Devil) by fans and teammates. In 1977, 
he hit .316 with 42 home runs and 97 runs batted in, helping the Central 
League's Yakult Swallows reach second place for the first time in franchise 
history. In 1978, he hit .312 with 39 homers and 103 RBI, powering the 
Swallows to their first pennant and the Japan Championship Series. Playing 
for the Pacific League's Kintetsu Buffaloes, Manuel hit 25 home runs in 
the first eight weeks of the 1979 season.[5] He was on pace to break the 
Japanese record of 16 home runs in a month.[6] At a game against the Lotte 
Orions on June 19, 1979, he was beaned by a pitch from Soroku Yagisawa, 
effectively stopping Manuel from taking that record.[6] The pitch broke 
Manuel's jaw in six places. He wore a dental bridge as a result of an earlier 
accident in the minor leagues. There was nothing for doctors to wire together, 
so they inserted three metal plates in his head and removed nerves from 
his face.[5] Manuel was discharged from the hospital after six weeks and 
immediately began playing again, against the advice of doctors and worried 
family. The Buffaloes were struggling to stay in the Pacific League lead 
and had never won a pennant. To protect his jaw, Manuel wore a helmet equipped 
with a football facemask. He wore the helmet for the first few games but 
stopped using it because it obscured his vision at the plate.[7] He finished 
the 1979 season with 37 home runs to win the home run title. He led Kintetsu 
to its first pennant win. He was voted the Most Valuable Player, the first 
American to receive the honor since 1964, hitting .324 with 37 home runs 
and 94 RBI. A year later, Manuel shocked Japanese baseball by leaving for 
a week to attend his son's high school graduation in Virginia. His contract 
allowed it, but team officials were incredulous that Manuel would leave 
the team two games out of first place with three weeks to play in the first 
half of the season.[8] Manuel returned to lead the team to the second-half 
championship and the pennant. He finished the season hitting .324, with 
48 home runs and 129 RBI. It was the best season for an American player 
in Japan to that point. Manuel won no awards that season.[9] In 1981, he 
returned to the Yakult Swallows after being released by Kintetsu over contract 
negotiations. Manuel finished his successful run in Japan with a .303 career 
average, 189 home runs and 491 RBI. He was considered one of the best imported 
baseball players to Japan in those days, along with brothers Leron and 
Leon Lee and Randy Bass. During his time in Japan, Manuel learned to speak 
Japanese. The language skill and experience in Japan was useful in managing 
players such as So Taguchi and Tadahito Iguchi. Ultimately, injuries, including 
the beaning in Japan, cut Manuel's playing days short. He returned to the 
United States to work as a scout for the Minnesota Twins organization before 
turning to coaching. As a minor league manager for nine years in the Twins' 
(from 1983 to 1987) and Cleveland Indians' (from 1990 to 1993) farm systems, 
Manuel compiled a 610–588 (.509) record, winning the Pacific Coast League 
and International League championships in his final two seasons (1992–93). 
He was named Manager of the Year three times (1984, 1992, 1993) and managed 
the IL All-Star team in 1993. Manuel returned to the Majors in 1988 as 
the Indians' hitting coach (from 1988 to 1989, from 1994 to 1999), where 
under his tutelage, the Tribe led the American League in runs three times 
(from 1994 to 1995, 1999) and set a franchise record in 1999 with 1,009 
runs, becoming the first team to score 1,000 runs since the 1950 Boston 
Red Sox. The club also led the league in home runs in 1994 and 1995. From 
2000 to 2002, he served as the Indians' manager, leading the team to the 
American League Central Division title in 2001. He was the 37th manager 
in the Cleveland Indians history.[10] He was fired as manager of the Cleveland 
Indians on July 12, 2002 over a contract dispute. Shortly after he was 
fired as manager for the Cleveland Indians, Manuel was hired by the Phillies 
as special assistant to the general manager. He was hired in 2004 as the 
Phillies' Manager.[10] After the 2004 season, Manuel was hired as the club's 
51st manager, replacing Larry Bowa.[11] In the 2005 season, Manuel and 
the Phillies went 88–74, only one game back of the Wild Card. In 2006, 
Manuel and the Phillies finished just short of the playoffs once again, 
this time three games back of the wild card. However, the season did have 
certain positives that boded well for next season. Second-year slugger 
Ryan Howard hit a franchise record 58 home runs, second baseman Chase Utley 
was named a starter in the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, and rookie pitcher Cole 
Hamels showed progress and the potential that he could one day become the 
club's ace. The team got off to a slow start again in 2007 (in 2005, they 
opened at 9–12; in 2006, 6–10). They began the season with a 3–9 record 
and during the Phillies' post-game press conference following the team's 
8–1 loss to the New York Mets on April 17, 2007, Philadelphia radio personality 
Howard Eskin repeatedly questioned Manuel why he did not challenge his 
players. Eskin, a controversial afternoon drive host on local sports-talk 
station WIP-610, had criticized Manuel since the manager's hiring three 
years earlier.[12] The Phillies proceeded to lose two of their next three 
games after the confrontation before going on a five-game winning streak. 
After the streak, the Phillies took another step back, winning only 5 of 
their next 13 games. The Philles were still one game below .500 on July 
19 and only four games over .500 on August 25. From August 25 through the 
end of the season the Phillies went 23–11 to overtake the Mets. Manuel's 
Phillies battled injuries all season, including losing newly acquired pitcher 
Freddy García for the season. Howard, Utley, and Hamels also missed significant 
playing time. Hamels led the pitching staff with a 15–5 record, while Jimmy 
Rollins set the Major League Baseball record for at-bats in a season with 
716 through all 162 games played, as well as being named NL MVP. In a dramatic 
finale to the season, the Phillies captured the National League East title 
from the collapsing Mets, but were swept in the first round of the playoffs 
by the Colorado Rockies. Manuel finished second in balloting for the National 
League Manager of the Year Award for 2007.[13] The 2008 season started 
out much like 2005 through 2007, the Phillies once again got off to a slow 
start with a record of 8 wins and 10 losses. They recovered quickly after 
their slow start to go over the .500 mark on April 24. They peaked at 22 
games over the .500 mark on the final day of the season, winning 92 games 
and earning 1st place in the NL East for the 2nd consecutive year. On October 
29, Charlie Manuel guided the 2008 Phillies to their second world title. 
It was his first World Series ring after years of close calls (including 
the 1997 Cleveland Indians). He was voted by fans as MLB "This Year in 
Baseball Awards" Manager of the Year.[14] Manuel reached a contract agreement 
with the Phils on December 9, 2008 to keep him with the team through the 
2011 season. On October 21, 2009, Manuel became the first manager in franchise 
history to lead the Phillies to two consecutive World Series appearances. 
It was the first time a National League team won back-to-back pennants 
since the 1995–96 Atlanta Braves. During the 2009 World Series, Manuel 
was criticized for not pitching Cliff Lee in Game 4, a game the Phillies 
eventually lost.[15] He defended his decision by noting that Lee had never 
pitched on three days' rest before. Manuel finished sixth in balloting 
for the 2009 National League Manager of the Year Award.[16] In 2010, Manuel 
managed the Phillies to their fourth consecutive NL East title.[17] The 
Phillies became the third NL team in history to play in the postseason 
in four consecutive seasons, joining the Braves (1991–2005, excluding 1994) 
and the New York Giants (1921–24).[18] The Phillies finished the season 
at 97–65; it was the first time in franchise history that Philadelphia 
had completed a season with Major League Baseball's best record.[19] In 
November, the Rotary Club of Pittsburgh named Manuel the recipient of its 
Chuck Tanner Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award. In September 
2011, Manuel again led the Phillies to the NL East title, their fifth consecutive 
in as many years, and quickest post-season clinch ever: at game #150.[20] 
During the sweep of the final series against the Atlanta Braves on September 
26–28, records were set. First on the 26th, with the Phillies' 4-2 victory, 
he became the second manager in Phillies' history to manager a team to 
at least 100 wins in a season, after Danny Ozark during back-to-back 101 
win seasons in 1976 and 1977.[21][22] The next day, with the Phillies' 
7-1 victory, Manuel moved into a franchise-record tie with Gene Mauch with 
645 regular-season victories.[21] In the final game of the season with 
a victory in 13 innings, he led the Phillies to a franchise-record 102 
regular season wins. With the victory he picked up his 646th win, setting 
a new Phillies' managerial record for victories and assuring that the Phillies 
would face the red hot St. Louis Cardinals who defeated them in the NLDS. 
In 2012, he managed the Phillies to an 81–81 record, marking the first 
time in five years the team failed to reach the postseason. In 2013, Manuel 
won his 1,000th game on August 12.[23] However, Manuel did not win another 
game with the Phillies, and after the team lost their 15th game out of 
20 after the All-Star Break, Manuel was fired on August 16. He was replaced 
by third-base coach Ryne Sandberg.[24] Reaction around the league and from 
the Phillies fan base mostly consisted of sadness, a growing disdain for 
Ruben Amaro Jr. and gratitude to Manuel for his tenure.[25] Several Phillies 
veterans, including Chase Utley and Cole Hamels, expressed regret and guilt, 
believing their lack of production led to Manuel's firing; they said that 
they viewed Manuel as a fatherly figure.[26] Sandberg commented the next 
day, "It was a roller coaster of a day emotionally. It affected me and 
I think it affects the players."[27] Manuel received praise from the media 
for his class in handling the situation,[28] and sportswriters mostly exonerated 
him of the blame for the Phillies' performance for not having better players.[29][30] 
When asked if he had enough pieces to win the last two years, he said "The 
last two years? No. I can straight face tell you that." [31] Despite stepping 
down, Manuel would eventually return to the Philles as a senior advisor 
to the General Manager. Manuel has survived a heart attack, quadruple bypass 
surgery, a blocked and infected colon, and kidney cancer.[33] During his 
time with the Indians, he worked in the dugout with a colostomy bag beneath 
his jacket. Manuel's mother June died October 10, 2008, at age 87 in Buena 
Vista, Virginia. She had suffered a heart attack earlier in the week. Because 
of the Phillies' 2008 NLCS five-game win, he was unable to attend his mother's
