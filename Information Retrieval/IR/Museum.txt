A museum (/mjuˈziːəm/; myoo-zee-um) is an institution that cares for (conserves) 
a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, 
or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for 
public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary.[1] 
Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and 
more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. 
Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists 
to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly 
shifting to serving the general public. Some of the most attended museums 
include the Louvre in Paris, the National Museum of China in Beijing, the 
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the British Museum in London, 
the National Gallery in London, and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York 
City. There are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history 
museums, science museums, war museums and children's museums. As of the 
2010s, the continuing acceleration in the digitization of information, 
combined with the increasing capacity of digital information storage, is 
causing the traditional model of museums (i.e. as static bricks-and-mortar 
"collections of collections" of three-dimensional specimens and artifacts) 
to expand to include virtual exhibits and high-resolution images of their 
collections that patrons can peruse, study, and explore from any place 
with Internet.[citation needed] The city with the largest number of museums 
is Mexico City with over 128 museums. According to The World Museum Community, 
there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.[2] The English "museum" 
comes from the Latin word, and is pluralized as "museums" (or rarely, "musea"). 
It is originally from the Ancient Greek Μουσεῖον (Mouseion), which denotes 
a place or temple dedicated to the Muses (the patron divinities in Greek 
mythology of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the 
arts,[3] especially the Musaeum (institute) for philosophy and research 
at Alexandria by Ptolemy I Soter about 280 BCE.[4] The first museum/library 
is considered to be the one of Plato in Athens.[5] However, Pausanias gives 
another place called "Museum," namely a small hill in Classical Athens 
opposite to the Akropolis. The hill was called Mouseion after Mousaious, 
a man who used to sing on the hill and died there of old age and was subsequently 
buried there as well.[6] The purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, 
interpret, and display items of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance 
for the education of the public. The purpose can also depend on one's point 
of view. To a family looking for entertainment on a Sunday afternoon, a 
trip to a local history museum or large city art museum could be a fun, 
and enlightening way to spend the day. To city leaders, a healthy museum 
community can be seen as a gauge of the economic health of a city, and 
a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To a museum professional, 
a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's 
mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, 
storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson's bequest, that would 
fund the Smithsonian Institution, stated he wanted to establish an institution 
"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge."[7] Museums of natural history 
in the late 19th century exemplified the Victorian desire for consumption 
and for order. Gathering all examples of each classification of a field 
of knowledge for research and for display was the purpose. As American 
colleges grew in the 19th century, they developed their own natural history 
collections for the use of their students. By the last quarter of the 19th 
century, the scientific research in the universities was shifting toward 
biological research on a cellular level, and cutting edge research moved 
from museums to university laboratories.[8] While many large museums, such 
as the Smithsonian Institution, are still respected as research centers, 
research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an 
ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, 
there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve artifacts for 
future generations. Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation 
efforts to retard decomposition in aging documents, artifacts, artworks, 
and buildings. All museums display objects that are important to a culture. 
As historian Steven Conn writes, "To see the thing itself, with one's own 
eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version 
of the same experience can be enchanting."[9] Museum purposes vary from 
institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or 
vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the Canada Science and Technology 
Museum favored education over preservation of their objects. They displayed 
objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historic printing 
press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia.[10] 
Some seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, 
while some museums have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History 
Museum or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect 
objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation 
and display. Although most museums do not allow physical contact with the 
associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage 
a more hands-on approach. In 2009, Hampton Court Palace, palace of Henry 
VIII, opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive 
environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old 
objects, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The 
daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse 
the visitor in a slice of what Tudor life may have been.[11] This section 
lists the 20 most visited museums as compiled by AECOM and the Themed Entertainment 
Association's annual report on the world's most visited attractions.[12] 
The cities of London and Washington, D.C. contain more of the 20 most visited 
museums in the world than any others. The museum of ancient times, such 
as the Museum of Alexandria, would be equivalent to a modern graduate institute. 
Early museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, 
families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and 
artifacts. These were often displayed in so-called wonder rooms or cabinets 
of curiosities. The oldest such museum in evidence was Ennigaldi-Nanna's 
museum, dating from c. 530 BC and devoted to Mesopotamian antiquities; 
it apparently had sufficient traffic as to warrant labels for the ordered 
collection, although there is no source for this information. Public access 
to these museums was often possible for the "respectable", especially to 
private art collections, but at the whim of the owner and his staff. One 
way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status 
in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects 
and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries 
and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest 
in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections 
in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds 
but they also used the museum as a way to sort and "manage the empirical 
explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased 
travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication 
and exchange had produced." [19] One of these naturalists and collectors 
was Ulisse Aldrovandi, whose collection policy of gathering as many objects 
and facts about them was "encyclopedic" in nature, reminiscent of that 
of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist.[20] The idea was to consume 
and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected 
and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy 
would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed 
by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as "the museums 
that contained this knowledge." The 18th century scholars of the Age of 
Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their 
natural history museums on "organization and taxonomy" rather than displaying 
everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.[21] The Museo del 
Prado in Madrid was designed in the Age of Enlightenment, in 1785, to house 
the Natural History Cabinet, but finally the building was converted into 
the new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures, opened in 1819, with 
the aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown. Nowadays, 
with the nearby Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Museo Reina Sofía, forms 
Madrid's Golden Triangle of Art. While some of the oldest public museums 
in the world opened in Italy during the Renaissance, the majority of these 
significant museums in the world opened during the 18th century: The first 
"public" museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. 
It could be difficult to gain entrance. When the British Museum opened 
to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage 
the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply 
in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries 
each day.[33] The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 
19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the 
British Museum, especially on public holidays.[34] The Ashmolean Museum, 
however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, 
was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is 
considered by some to be the first modern public museum.[35] The collection 
included that of Elias Ashmole which he had collected himself, including 
objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors John 
Tradescant the elder and his son of the same name. The collection included 
antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological 
specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last dodo ever seen 
in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, 
except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with 
naturalist Robert Plot as the first keeper. The first building, which became 
known as the Old Ashmolean, is sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher 
Wren or Thomas Wood.[36] In France, the first public museum was the Louvre 
Museum in Paris,[37] opened in 1793 during the French Revolution, which 
enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections 
for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected 
by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three 
days each "décade" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the 
French Republican Calendar). The Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts 
(National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the 
Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national 
museum system. As Napoléon I conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating 
art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task 
became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, 
many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually returned to their owners 
(and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept 
of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence 
throughout Europe. American museums eventually joined European museums 
as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their 
fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual 
and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 
(this is often called "The Museum Period" or "The Museum Age"). While many 
American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were 
founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and 
artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European 
counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections 
from ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome). Drawing on Michel Foucault's 
concept of liberal government, Tony Bennett has suggested the development 
of more modern 19th century museums was part of new strategies by Western 
governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive 
or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate 
the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously 
had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public. As such, objects 
and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments 
for these "new tasks of social management."[38] Universities became the 
primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before 
the start of the Second World War. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute 
new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are 
useful for both research and display. The late twentieth century witnessed 
intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural 
artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native 
American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation 
of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains.[39] In 1990, Congress 
passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), 
which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate 
Native American "cultural items" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups.[40] 
Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural 
artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians 
and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare 
antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.[41] The roles associated 
with the management a museum largely depend on the size of the institution, 
but every museum has a hierarchy of governance with a Board of Trustees 
serving at the top. The Director is next in command and works with the 
Board to establish and fulfill the museum's mission statement and to ensure 
that the museum is accountable to the public.[42] Together, the Board and 
the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies 
that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards 
include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, 
bylaws, and collections policy. The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) 
has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help 
guide the management of museums. Unfortunately, many small, local museums 
lack this guidance since accreditation with AAM requires a museum to operate 
on an annual budget of at least $25,000.[43] Museum governance is grounded 
by a mission statement which states the purpose of the museum, and while 
a museum seeks to adhere consistently to its mission, this statement is 
subject to revision as the institution evolves over the years. A vision 
statement indicates where the museum wishes to be in the future and provides 
a framework for growth. A values statement explains the beliefs of the 
museum.[44] According to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne 
M. Ireland, "Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict 
management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, 
and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and 
ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession."[45] 
Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established 
by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together 
toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly 
found at museums: Other positions commonly found at museums include: building 
operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, 
groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development 
officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public 
relations staff, and graphic designer. At smaller museums, staff members 
often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely 
or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary. An exhibition history 
is a listing of exhibitions for an institution, artist, or a work of art. 
Exhibition histories generally include the name of the host institution, 
the title of the exhibition and the opening and closing dates of the exhibition. 
The following is a list of major institutions that have complete or substantial 
exhibition histories that are available online. The design of museums has 
evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning 
the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the 
collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning 
has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian John Cotton Dana. 
Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of 
books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan 
their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should 
form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to 
what the museum should supply or do for the community.[61] According to 
Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs: "The new 
museum…does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's 
life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the 
material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence 
widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the 
maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use." [62] The way that 
museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they 
house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed 
by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements 
of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at 
the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that 
were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.[63] 
Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive 
to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly 
accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this 
trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first 
century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums 
are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. 
Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location 
to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast 
majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American 
Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on 
display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage 
is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects 
play and how accessible they should be.[64] In terms of modern museums, 
interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting 
curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content 
in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. 
Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a museum planning 
process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, 
organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility 
study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an interpretive plan are 
all developed as part of the museum planning process. Some museum experiences 
have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, 
and their mission reflects this; the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles 
and the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, being notable examples 
where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or 
information is interpreted. In contrast, the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum in Washington, D.C. uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions. 
In recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic 
development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial 
cities.[65] Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around 
the world. For example, the spectacular Guggenheim Bilbao was built in 
Bilbao, Spain in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize 
the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed 
to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that 
caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project.[66] Nonetheless, 
the gamble has appeared to pay off financially for the city, with over 
1.1 million people visiting the museum in 2015. Key to this is the large 
demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors 
residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight 
into Bilbao.[67] A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was also 
built on the disused shipyards of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Titanic Belfast 
was built for the same price as the Guggenheim Bilbao (and which was incidentally 
built by the same architect, Frank Gehry) in time for the 100th anniversary 
of the Belfast-built ship's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting 
modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers 
reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland.[68] 
In the United States, similar projects include the 81, 000 square foot 
Taubman Museum of Art in Roanoke, Virginia and The Broad Museum in Los 
Angeles. Museums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local 
governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local 
populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which 
have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum 
is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum 
struggles to attract visitors. The Taubman Museum is an example of a museum 
which cost a lot (eventually $66 million) but attained little success, 
and continues to have a low endowment for its size.[69] Some museum activists 
also see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. 
Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that "to ask museums to 
solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable 
failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment."[65] 
Most mid-size and large museums employ exhibit design staff for graphic 
and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to 
traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments 
may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research 
and evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. 
These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design 
or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the interpretive 
plan for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate 
methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will 
often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual 
plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, 
fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the 
outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses. Exhibition design has 
as multitude of strategies, theories, and methods but two that embody much 
of the theory and dialogue surrounding exhibition design are the metonymy 
technique and the use of authentic artifacts to provide the historical 
narrative. Metonymy, or "the substitution of the name of an attribute or 
adjunct for that of the thing meant,"[70] is a technique used by many museums 
but few as heavily and as influentially as Holocaust museums. The United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., for example, employs 
this technique in its shoe exhibition. Simply a pile of decaying leather 
shoes piled against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily 
on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this 
use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies 
metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link 
to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving 
vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, can 
be a very powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the 
viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, 
however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. 
Hansen-Glucklich explains, "...when victims' possessions are collected 
according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the 
victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization 
of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects 
and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess."[71] 
While a powerful technique, Hansen-Glucklick points out that when used 
en masse the metonym suffers as the memory and suffering of the individual 
is lost in the chorus of the whole. While at times juxtaposed, the alternative 
technique of the use of authentic objects is seen the same exhibit mentioned 
above. The use of authentic artifacts is employed by most, if not all, 
museums but the degree to which and the intention can vary greatly. The 
basic idea behind exhibiting authentic artifacts is to provide not only 
legitimacy to the exhibit's historical narrative but, at times, to help 
create the narrative as well. The theory behind this technique is to exhibit 
artifacts in a neutral manner to orchestrate and narrate the historic narrative 
through, ideally, the provenance of the artifacts themselves. While albeit 
necessary to some degree in any museum repertoire, the use of authentic 
artifacts can not only be misleading but as equally problematic as the 
aforementioned metonymic technique. Hansen-Glucklick explains, "The danger 
of such a strategy lies in the fact that by claiming to offer the remnants 
of the past to the spectator, the museum creates the illusion of standing 
before a complete picture. The suggestion is that if enough details and 
fragments are collected and displayed, a coherent and total truth concerning 
the past will emerge, visible and comprehensible. The museum attempts, 
in other words, to archive the unachievable."[71] While any exhibit benefits 
from the legitimacy given by authentic objects or artifacts, the temptation 
must be protected against in order to avoid relying solely on the artifacts 
themselves. A well designed exhibition should employ objects and artifacts 
as a foundation to the narrative but not as a crutch; a lesson any conscientious 
curator would be well to keep in mind. Some museum scholars have even begun 
to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven 
Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer 
objects in all museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by 
interactive technology.[72] As educational programming has grown in museums, 
mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily 
a negative development. Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction 
in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly 
showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) 
to instead "thinning out" the objects presented "for a general view of 
any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, 
where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed 
to see them."[73] This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially 
present in science museums like the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, 
which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more 
from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.[74] 
Types of museums vary, from large institutions, covering many of the categories 
below, to very small institutions focusing on a specific subject, location, 
or a notable person. Categories include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, 
archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, 
science, technology, children's museums, natural history, botanical and 
zoological gardens. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, 
e.g. museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, 
aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. Another type of museum 
is an encyclopedic museum. Commonly referred to as a universal museum, 
encyclopedic museums have collections representative of the world and typically 
include art, science, history, and cultural history. The type and size 
of a museum is reflected in its collection. A museum normally houses a 
core collection of important selected objects in its field. Architectural 
museums are institutions dedicated to educating visitors about architecture 
and a variety of related fields, often including urban design, landscape 
design, interior decoration, engineering, and historic preservation. Additionally, 
museums of art or history sometimes dedicate a portion of the museum or 
a permanent exhibit to a particular facet or era of architecture and design, 
though this does not technically constitute a proper museum of architecture. 
The International Confederation of Architectural Museums (ICAM) is the 
principal worldwide organisation for architectural museums. Members consist 
of almost all large institutions specializing in this field and also those 
offering permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries. Architecture museums 
are in fact a less common type in the United States, due partly to the 
difficulty of curating a collection which could adequately represent or 
embody the large scale subject matter. The National Building Museum in 
Washington D.C., a privately run institution created by a mandate of Congress 
in 1980, is the nation's most prominent public museum of architecture. 
In addition to its architectural exhibits and collections, the museum seeks 
to educate the public about engineering and design. The NBM is a unique 
museum in that the building in which it is housed—the historic Pension 
Building built 1882-87—is itself a sort of curated collection piece which 
teaches about architecture. Another large scale museum of architecture 
is the Chicago Athenaeum, an international Museum of Architecture and Design, 
founded in 1988. The Athenaeum differs from the National Building Museum 
not only in its global scope—it has offices in Italy, Greece, Germany, 
and Ireland—but also in its broader topical scope, which encompasses smaller 
modern appliances and graphic design. A very different and much smaller 
example of an American architectural museum is the Schifferstadt Architectural 
Museum in Frederick, Maryland. Similar to the National Building Museum, 
the building of the Schifferstadt is a historic structure, built in 1758, 
and therefore also an embodiment of historic preservation and restoration. 
In addition to instructing the public about its eighteenth century German-American 
style architecture, the Schifferstadt also interprets the broader contextual 
history of its origins, including topics such as the French and Indian 
War and the arrival of the region's earliest German American immigrants. 
Museums of architecture are devoted primarily to disseminating knowledge 
about architecture, but there is considerable room for expanding into other 
related genres such as design, city planning, landscape, infrastructure, 
and even the traditional study of history or art, which can provide useful 
context for any architectural exhibit. Archaeology museums specialize in 
the display of archaeological artifacts. Many are in the open air, such 
as the Agora of Athens and the Roman Forum. Others display artifacts found 
in archaeological sites inside buildings. Some, such as the Western Australian 
Museum, exhibit maritime archaeological materials. These appear in its 
Shipwreck Galleries, a wing of the Maritime Museum. This Museum has also 
developed a 'museum-without-walls' through a series of underwater wreck 
trails. An art museum, also known as an art gallery, is a space for the 
exhibition of art, usually in the form of art objects from the visual arts, 
primarily paintings, illustrations, and sculptures. Collections of drawings 
and old master prints are often not displayed on the walls, but kept in 
a print room. There may be collections of applied art, including ceramics, 
metalwork, furniture, artist's books, and other types of objects. Video 
art is often screened. The first publicly owned museum in Europe was the 
Amerbach-Cabinet in Basel, originally a private collection sold to the 
city in 1661 and public since 1671 (now Kunstmuseum Basel).[75] The Ashmolean 
Museum in Oxford opened on 24 May 1683 as the world's first university 
art museum. Its first building was built in 1678–1683 to house the cabinet 
of curiosities Elias Ashmole gave Oxford University in 1677. The Uffizi 
Gallery in Florence was initially conceived as offices for the Florentine 
civil service (hence the name), but evolved into a display place for many 
of the paintings and sculpture collected by the Medici family or commissioned 
by them. After the house of Medici was extinguished, the art treasures 
remained in Florence, forming one of the first modern museums. The gallery 
had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 
1765 it was officially opened to the public. Another early public museum 
was the British Museum in London, which opened to the public in 1759.[25] 
It was a "universal museum" with very varied collections covering art, 
applied art, archaeology, anthropology, history, and science, and what 
is now the British Library. The science collections, library, paintings, 
and modern sculptures have since been found separate homes, leaving history, 
archaeology, non-European and pre-Renaissance art, and prints and drawings. 
Underwater museum is another type of art museum where the Artificial reef 
are placed to promote marine life. Cancun Underwater Museum, or the Subaquatic 
Sculpture Museum, in Mexico is the largest underwater museum in the world. 
There are now about 500 images in the underwater museum. The last eleven 
images were added in September 2013.[76] The specialised art museum is 
considered a fairly modern invention, the first being the Hermitage in 
Saint Petersburg which was established in 1764.[citation needed] The Louvre 
in Paris was established in 1793, soon after the French Revolution when 
the royal treasures were declared for the people.[77] The Czartoryski Museum 
in Kraków was established in 1796 by Princess Izabela Czartoryska.[78] 
This showed the beginnings of removing art collections from the private 
domain of aristocracy and the wealthy into the public sphere, where they 
were seen as sites for educating the masses in taste and cultural refinement. 
Biographical museums are dedicated to items relating to the life of a single 
person or group of people, and may also display the items collected by 
their subjects during their lifetimes. Some biographical museums are located 
in a house or other site associated with the lives of their subjects (e.g. 
Sagamore Hill which contains the Theodore Roosevelt Museum or The Keats-Shelley 
Memorial House in the Piazza di Spagna, Rome). Some homes of famous people 
house famous collections in the sphere of the owner's expertise or interests 
in addition to collections of their biographical material; one such example 
is The Wellington Museum, Apsley House, London, home of the Duke of Wellington, 
which, in addition to biographical memorabilia of the Duke's life, also 
houses his collection world-famous paintings. Other biographical museums, 
such as many of the American presidential libraries, are housed in specially 
constructed buildings. As time goes by, more and more museums dedicated 
to classic cars of yesteryear are opening. Many of the old classics come 
to life once the original owners pass away. Some are not-for-profit while 
others are run as a private business. Children's museums are institutions 
that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate informal learning experiences 
for children. In contrast with traditional museums that typically have 
a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive 
exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind 
such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially 
in early childhood. Most children's museums are nonprofit organizations, 
and many are run by volunteers or by very small professional staffs.[80] 
The Brooklyn Children's Museum was established in 1899 by the Brooklyn 
Institute of Arts and Sciences. It is often regarded as the first children's 
museum in the United States.[81] The idea behind the Brooklyn Children's 
Museum implicitly acknowledged that existing American museums were not 
designed with children in mind. Although museums at the turn of the century 
viewed themselves as institutions of public education, their exhibits were 
often not made accessible for children, who may have struggled with simple 
design features like the height of exhibit cases, or the language of interpretive 
labels.[82] Furthermore, touching objects was often prohibited, limiting 
visitors' ability to interact with museum objects. The founders of the 
Brooklyn Children's Museum were concerned with education and realized that 
no other institution had attempted to establish "a Museum that will be 
of especial value and interest to young people between the ages of six 
and twenty years."[83] Their goal was to gain children's interest and "to 
stimulate their powers of observation and reflection" as well as to "illustrate 
by collections of pictures, cartoons, charts, models, maps and so on, each 
of the important branches of knowledge which is taught in elementary schools."[81] 
Anna Billings Gallup, the museum's curator from 1904-1937, encouraged a 
learning technique that allowed children to "discover" information by themselves 
through touching and examining objects. Visitors to the museum were able 
to compare the composition, weight, and hardness of minerals, learn to 
use a microscope to examine natural objects, and build their own collections 
of natural objects to be displayed in a special room of the museum.[84] 
In addition to emphasis on allowing interaction with objects, Gallup also 
encouraged learning through play. She believed learning at the Brooklyn 
Children's Museum should be "pure fun", and to this end developed nature 
clubs, held field trips, brought live animals into the museum, and hired 
gallery instructors to lead children in classification games about animals, 
shells, and minerals.[85] Other children's museums of the early twentieth 
century used similar techniques that emphasized learning through experience. 
Children's museums often emphasize experiential learning through museum 
interactives, sometimes leading them to have very few or no physical collection 
items. The Brooklyn Children's Museum and other early children's museums 
grew out of the tradition of natural history museums, object-centered institutions. 
Over the course of the twentieth century, the children's museums slowly 
began to discard their objects in favor of more interactive exhibits. While 
children's museums are a more extreme case, it is important to note that 
during the twentieth century, more and more museums have elected to display 
fewer objects and offer more interpretation than museums of the nineteenth 
century.[86] Some scholars argue that objects, while once critical to the 
definition of a museum, are no longer considered vital to many institutions 
because they are no longer necessary to fulfill the roles we expect museums 
to serve as museums focus more on programs, education, and their visitors.[87] 
After the Brooklyn Children's Museum opened in 1899, other American museums 
followed suit by opening small children's sections of their institutions 
designed with children in mind and equipped with interactive activities, 
such as the Smithsonian's children's room opened in 1901.[88] The Brooklyn 
Children's Museum also inspired other children's museums either housed 
separately or even developed completely independently of parent museums, 
like the Boston Children's Museum (1913), The Children's Museum of Detroit 
Public Schools (1915), and the Children's Museum of Indianapolis (1925).[89] 
The number of children's museums in the United States continued to grow 
over the course of the twentieth century, with over 40 museums opened by 
the 1960s and more than 70 children's museums opened to the public between 
1990 and 1997.[90] International professional organizations of children's 
museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was 
formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and 
in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries,[80] and The Hands 
On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, 
with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007.[91] Many museums that 
are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one 
museum to visit all the others for free. A design museum is a museum with 
a focus on product, industrial, graphic, fashion, and architectural design. 
Many design museums were founded as museums for applied arts or decorative 
arts and started only in the late 20th century to collect design. It may 
sometimes be useful do distinguish between diachronic and synchronic museums. 
According to University of Florida's Professor Eric Kilgerman, "While a 
museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, 
those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called 
synchronic."[92] Encyclopedic museums are large, mostly national, institutions 
that offer visitors a plethora of information on a variety of subjects 
that tell both local and global stories. The aim of encyclopedic museums 
is to provide examples of each classification available for a field of 
knowledge. "With 3% of the world's population, or nearly 200 million people, 
living outside the country of their birth, encyclopedic museums play an 
especially important role in the building of civil society. They encourage 
curiosity about the world."[93] James Cuno, President and Director of the 
Art Institute of Chicago, along with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British 
Museum, are two of the most outspoken museum professionals who support 
encyclopedic museums. They state that encyclopedic museums are advantageous 
for society by exposing museum visitors to a wide variety of cultures, 
engendering a sense of a shared human history.[94] Some scholars and archaeologists, 
however, argue against encyclopedic museums because they remove cultural 
objects from their original cultural setting, losing their context.[95] 
Ethnology museums are a type of museum that focus on studying, collecting, 
preserving and displaying artifacts and objects concerning ethnology and 
anthropology. This type of museum usually were built in countries possessing 
diverse ethnic groups or significant numbers of ethnic minorities. An example 
is the Ozurgeti History Museum, an ethnographic museum in Georgia. Within 
the category of history museums, historic house museums are the most numerous. 
The earliest projects for preserving historic homes began in the 1850s 
under the direction of individuals concerned with the public good and the 
preservation of American history, especially centered on the first president. 
Since the establishment of America's first historic site at Washington's 
Revolutionary headquarters at Hasbrouck House in New York State, Americans 
have found a penchant for preserving similar historical structures. The 
establishment of historic house museums increased in popularity through 
the 1970s and 1980s as the Revolutionary bicentennial set off a wave of 
patriotism and alerted Americans to the destruction of their physical heritage. 
The tradition of restoring homes of the past and designating them as museums 
draws on the English custom of preserving ancient buildings and monuments. 
Initially homes were considered worthy of saving because of their associations 
with important individuals, usually of the elite classes, like former presidents, 
authors, or businessmen. Increasingly, Americans have fought to preserve 
structures characteristic of a more typical American past that represents 
the lives of everyday people including minorities.[96] While historic house 
museums compose the largest section within the historic museum category, 
they usually operate with small staffs and on limited budgets. Many are 
run entirely by volunteers and often do not meet the professional standards 
established by the museum industry. An independent survey conducted by 
Peggy Coats in 1990 revealed that sixty-five percent of historic house 
museums did not have a full-time staff and 19 to 27 percent of historic 
homes employed only one full-time employee. Furthermore, the majority of 
these museums operated on less than $50,000 annually. The survey also revealed 
a significant disparity in the amount of visitors between local house museums 
and national sites. While museums like Mount Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg 
were visited by over one million tourists a year, more than fifty percent 
of historic house museums received less than 5,000 visitors per year.[97] 
These museums are also unique in that the actual structure belongs to the 
museum collection as a historical object. While some historic home museums 
are fortunate to possess a collection containing many of the original furnishings 
once present in the home, many face the challenge of displaying a collection 
consistent with the historical structure. Some museums choose to collect 
pieces original to the period while not original to the house. Others, 
fill the home with replicas of the original pieces reconstructed with the 
help of historic records. Still other museums adopt a more aesthetic approach 
and use the homes to display the architecture and artistic objects.[98] 
Because historic homes have often existed through different generations 
and have been passed on from one family to another, volunteers and professionals 
also must decide which historical narrative to tell their visitors. Some 
museums grapple with this issue by displaying different eras in the home's 
history within different rooms or sections of the structure. Others choose 
one particular narrative, usually the one deemed most historically significant, 
and restore the home to that particular period. History museums cover the 
knowledge of history and its relevance to the present and future. Some 
cover specialized curatorial aspects of history or a particular locality; 
others are more general. Such museums contain a wide range of objects, 
including documents, artifacts of all kinds, art, archaeological objects. 
Antiquities museums specialize in more archaeological findings. A common 
type of history museum is a historic house. A historic house may be a building 
of special architectural interest, the birthplace or home of a famous person, 
or a house with an interesting history. Local and national governments 
often create museums to their history. The United States has many national 
museums for historical topics, such as the National Museum of African American 
History and Culture. Historic sites can also serve as museums, such as 
the museum at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C. The U.S. National Park 
Service defines a historic site as the "location of a significant event, 
a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, 
whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses 
historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any 
existing structure."[99] Historic sites can also mark public crimes, such 
as Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Robben Island, 
South Africa. Similar to museums focused on public crimes, museums attached 
to memorials of public crimes often contain a history component, as is 
the case at the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum. History museums 
may concern more general crimes and atrocities, such as American slavery. 
Often these museums are connected to a particular example, such as the 
proposed International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, 
which will treat slavery as an institution with a particular focus on slavery 
in Charleston and South Carolina's Lowcountry.[100] Museums in cities like 
Charleston, South Carolina must interact with a broader heritage tourism 
industry where the history of the majority population is traditionally 
privileged over the minority.[101] Despite efforts to tell multicultural 
histories, history museums have a problem with diversity and inclusion. 
Most museums in the United States that are national in scope such as the 
Smithsonian often focus solely on white upper class heterosexual male history 
and ignore most others. This has caused many specialized museums to be 
established such as the National LGBT Museum in New York City and the National 
Women's History Museum planned for the National Mall. The majority of museums 
across the country that tell state and local history also follow this example. 
Women are one of the worst examples of this, with less than 10% of historic 
sites devoted to women.[102] Other museums have a problem interpreting 
colonial histories, especially at Native American historic sites. However, 
museums such as the National Museum of the American Indian and Ziibiwing 
Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways in Michigan are working to share 
authority with indigenous groups and decolonize museums.[103] Another type 
of history museum is a living history museum. A living history museum is 
an outdoor museum featuring reenactors in period costume, and historic 
or reconstructed buildings. Colonial Williamsburg is a living history museum 
in Virginia that represents the colony on the eve of the American Revolution 
in the 18th century. The 301 acre historic area includes hundreds of buildings, 
in their original locations, but mostly reconstructed.[104] Living history 
museums combine historic architecture, material culture, and costumed interpretation 
with natural and cultural landscapes to create an immersive learning environment. 
These museums include the collection, preservation or interpretation of 
material culture, traditional skills, and historical processes. Recreated 
historical settings simulating past time periods can offer the visitor 
a sense of traveling back in time. They are a type of open-air museum. 
Two main interpretation styles dominate the visitor experience at living 
history museums: first and third person interpretation. In first person 
interpretation, interpreters assume the persona, including the speech patterns, 
behaviors, views, and dress of a historical figure from the museum's designated 
time period. In third person interpretation, the interpreters openly acknowledge 
themselves to be a contemporary of the museum visitor. The interpreter 
is not restricted by being in-character and can speak to the visitor about 
society from a modern-day perspective. The beginnings of the living history 
museum can be traced back to 1873 with the opening of the Skansen Museum 
near Stockholm, Sweden. The museum's founder, Artur Hazelius, began the 
museum by using his personal collection of buildings and other cultural 
materials of pre-industrial society.[105] This museum began as an open-air 
museum and, by 1891, had several farm buildings in which visitors could 
see exhibits and where guides demonstrated crafts and tools.[106] For years, 
living history museums were relatively nonexistent outside of Scandinavia, 
though some military garrisons in North America used some living history 
techniques. Living history museums in the United States were initially 
established by entrepreneurs, such as John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford, 
and since then have proliferated within the museum world. Some of the earliest 
living history museums in the United States include Colonial Williamsburg 
(1926), Greenfield Village (1929), Conner Prairie Pioneer Settlement (1930s), 
Old Sturbridge Village (1946), and Plimoth Plantation (1947). Many living 
history farms and similar farm and agricultural museums have united under 
an association known as the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural 
Museums (ALHFAM).[105] Maritime museums are museums that specialize in 
the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore 
the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just as 
there is a wide variety of museum types, there are also many different 
types of maritime museums. First, as mentioned above, maritime museums 
can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation 
and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime 
setting. A second type is the maritime history museum, dedicated to educating 
the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the San Francisco 
Maritime National Historical Park and Mystic Seaport. Military-focused 
maritime museums are a third variety, of which the Intrepid Sea, Air & 
Space Museum and Battleship IOWA Museum are examples. Medical museums today 
are largely an extinct subtype of museum with a few notable exceptions, 
such as the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Hunterian 
Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in Glasgow, Scotland. The origins 
of the medical museum date back to Renaissance cabinets of curiosities 
which often featured displays of human skeletal material and other materia 
medica. Apothecaries and physicians collected specimens as a part of their 
professional activities and to increase their professional status among 
their peers.[107] As the medical profession placed greater emphasis on 
teaching and the practice of materia medica in the late 16th century, medical 
collections became a fundamental component of a medical student's education.[107] 
New developments in preserving soft tissue samples long term in spirits 
appeared in the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century physicians like 
John Hunter were using personal anatomical collections as teaching tools.[108] 
By the early 19th century, many hospitals and medical colleges in Great 
Britain had built sizable teaching collections. In the United States, the 
nation's first hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, already 
had a collection of plaster casts and crayon drawings of the stages of 
pregnancy as early as 1762.[109] Medical museums functioned as an integral 
part of medical students education through the 19th century and into the 
early 20th century.[109] Dry and wet anatomical specimens, casts, drawings, 
oil paintings, and photographs provided a means for medical students to 
compare healthy anatomical specimens with abnormal, or diseased organs. 
Museums, like the Mütter, added medical instruments and equipment to their 
collections to preserve and teach the history of the medical profession. 
By the 1920s, medical museums had reached their nadir and began to wane 
in their importance as institutes of medical knowledge and training. Medical 
teaching shifted towards training medical students in hospitals and laboratories, 
and over the course of the 20th century most medical museums disappeared 
from the museum horizon. The few surviving medical museums, like the Mütter 
Museum, have managed to survive by broadening their mission of preserving 
and disseminating medical knowledge to include the general public, rather 
than exclusively catering to medical professionals. Memorial museums are 
museums dedicated both to educating the public about and commemorating 
a specific historic event, usually involving mass suffering. The concept 
gained traction throughout the 20th century as a response to the numerous 
and well publicized mass atrocities committed during that century. The 
events commemorated by memorial museums tend to involve mostly civilian 
victims who died under "morally problematic circumstances" that cannot 
easily be interpreted as heroic. There are frequently unresolved issues 
concerning the identity, culpability, and punishment of the perpetrators 
of these killings and memorial museums often play an active research role 
aimed at benefiting both the victims and those prosecuting the perpetrators.[110] 
Today there are numerous prominent memorial museums including the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Toul Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes 
in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the District Six Museum in Cape Town, South Africa, 
and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City. Although 
the concept of a memorial museum is largely a product of the 20th century, 
there are museums of this type that focus on events from other periods, 
an example being the House of Slaves (Maisons des Esclaves) in Senegal 
which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and acts as a museum 
and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade. Memorial museums differ from 
traditional history museums in several key ways, most notably in their 
dual mission to incorporate both a moral framework for and contextual explanations 
of an event. While traditional history museums tend to be in neutral institutional 
settings, memorial museums are very often situated at the scene of the 
atrocity they seek to commemorate. Memorial museums also often have close 
connections with, and advocate for, a specific clientele who have a special 
relationship to the event or its victims, such as family members or survivors, 
and regularly hold politically significant special events.[111] Unlike 
many traditional history museums, memorial museums almost always have a 
distinct, overt political and moral message with direct ties to contemporary 
society. The following mission statement of the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum is typical in its focus on commemoration, education and 
advocacy: "The museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge 
about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; 
and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions 
raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities 
as citizens of a democracy."[112] Military museums specialize in military 
histories; they are often organized from a national point of view, where 
a museum in a particular country will have displays organized around conflicts 
in which that country has taken part. They typically include displays of 
weapons and other military equipment, uniforms, wartime propaganda, and 
exhibits on civilian life during wartime, and decorations, among others. 
A military museum may be dedicated to a particular or area, such as the 
Imperial War Museum Duxford for military aircraft, Deutsches Panzermuseum 
for tanks, the Lange Max Museum for the Western Front (World War I), the 
International Spy Museum for espionage, The National World War I Museum 
for World War I, the D-Day Paratroopers Historical Center (Normandy) for 
WWII airborne, or more generalist, such as the Canadian War Museum or the 
Musée de l'Armée. Mobile museum is a term applied to museums that make 
exhibitions from a vehicle- such as a van. Some institutions, such as St. 
Vital Historical Society and the Walker Art Center, use the term to refer 
to a portion of their collection that travels to sites away from the museum 
for educational purposes. Other mobile museums have no "home site", and 
use travel as their exclusive means of presentation. University of Louisiana 
in Lafayette has also created a mobile museum as part of the graduate program 
in History. The project is called Museum on the Move. Museums of natural 
history and natural science typically exhibit work of the natural world. 
The focus lies on nature and culture. Exhibitions educate the public on 
natural history, dinosaurs, zoology, oceanography, anthropology, and more. 
Evolution, environmental issues, and biodiversity are major areas in natural 
science museums. Notable museums include the Natural History Museum in 
London, the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in Oxford, the 
Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, the Smithsonian Institution's 
National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., the American Museum 
of Natural History in New York City, and the Canadian Museum of Nature 
in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Open-air museums collect and re-erect old buildings 
at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of 
the past. The first one was King Oscar II's collection near Oslo in Norway, 
opened in 1881. In 1907, it was incorporated into the Norsk Folkemuseum.[113] 
In 1891, inspired by a visit to the open-air museum in Oslo, Artur Hazelius 
founded the Skansen in Stockholm, which became the model for subsequent 
open-air museums in Northern and Eastern Europe, and eventually in other 
parts of the world.[114] Most open-air museums are located in regions where 
wooden architecture prevail, as wooden structures may be translocated without 
substantial loss of authenticity.[citation needed] A more recent but related 
idea is realized in ecomuseums, which originated in France.[citation needed] 
A concept developed in the 1990s, the pop-up museum is generally defined 
as a short term institution existing in a temporary space.[115] These temporary 
museums are finding increasing favor among more progressive museum professionals 
as a means of direct community involvement with objects and exhibition. 
Often, the pop-up concept relies solely on visitors to provide both the 
objects on display and the accompanying labels with the professionals or 
institution providing only the theme of the pop-up and the space in which 
to display the objects, an example of shared historical authority. Due 
to the flexibility of the pop-up museums and their rejection of traditional 
structure, even these latter provisions need not be supplied by an institution; 
in some cases the themes have been chosen collectively by a committee of 
interested participants while exhibitions designated as pop-ups have been 
mounted in places as varied as community centers and even a walk-in closet.[116] 
Some examples of pop-up museums include: Science museums and technology 
centers or technology museums revolve around scientific achievements, and 
marvels and their history. To explain complicated inventions, a combination 
of demonstrations, interactive programs and thought-provoking media are 
used. Some museums may have exhibits on topics such as computers, aviation, 
railway museums, physics, astronomy, and the animal kingdom. The Museum 
of Science and Industry in Chicago is a very popular museum. Science museums 
traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic 
value, echoes of the 'curiosity cabinets' of the Renaissance period. These 
early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which 
emerged in the fifteenth century from 'an attempt to manage the empirical 
explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased 
travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication 
and exchange had produced.[119] Science museums were institutions of authoritative, 
uncontestable, knowledge, places of 'collecting, seeing and knowing, places 
where "anybody" might come and survey the evidence of science.[120] Dinosaurs, 
extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections, plant taxonomies, and 
so on - these were the orders of the day. By the nineteenth century, science 
museums had flourished, and with it 'the capacity of exhibitionary representation 
to render the world as visible and ordered... part of the instantiation 
of wider senses of scientific and political certainty' (MacDonald, 1998: 
11). By the twentieth century, museums of science had built 'on their earlier 
emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation 
between the obscure world of science and that of the public.[120] The nineteenth 
century also brought a proliferation of science museums with roots in technical 
and industrial heritage museums.[121] Ordinarily, visitors individually 
interact with exhibits, by a combination of manipulating, reading, pushing, 
pulling, and generally using their senses. Information is carefully structured 
through engaging, interactive displays. Science centers include interactive 
exhibits that respond to the visitor's action and invite further response, 
as well as hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor,[122] 
In general, science centers offer 'a decontextualized scattering of interactive 
exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas [123] 
usually presented in small rooms or galleries, with scant attention paid 
to applications of science, social political contexts, or moral and ethical 
implications. By the 1960s, these interactive science centers with their 
specialized hands-on galleries became prevalent. The Exploratorium in San 
Francisco, and the Ontario Science Centre in 1969, were two of the earliest 
examples of science centers dedicated to exploring scientific principles 
through hands-on exhibits. In the United States practically every major 
city has a science center with a total annual visitation of 115 million 
[124] New technologies of display and new interpretive experiments mark 
these interactive science centers, and the mantra 'public understanding 
of science' aptly describes their central activity.[125] Science museums, 
in particular, may consist of planetaria, or large theatre usually built 
around a dome. Museums may have IMAX feature films, which may provide 3-D 
viewing or higher quality picture. As a result, IMAX content provides a 
more immersive experience for people of all ages. Also new virtual museums, 
known as Net Museums, have recently been created. These are usually websites 
belonging to real museums and containing photo galleries of items found 
in those real museums. This new presentation is very useful for people 
living far away who wish to see the contents of these museums. A number 
of different museums exist to demonstrate a variety of topics. Music museums 
may celebrate the life and work of composers or musicians, such as the 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, or even the Rimsky-Korsakov 
Apartment and Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Other music museums include 
live music recitals, such as the Handel House Museum in London, England. 
In Glendale, Arizona, the Bead Museum[126] fosters an appreciation and 
understanding of the global, historical, cultural, and artistic significance 
of beads and related artifacts dating as far back as 15,000 years. Also 
residing in the American Southwest are living history towns such as Tombstone, 
Arizona. This historical town is home to a number of "living history" museums 
(such as the O.K. Corral and the Tombstone Epitaph) in which visitors can 
learn about historical events from actors playing the parts of historical 
figures like Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and John Clum. Colonial Williamsburg 
(in Williamsburg, Virginia), is another great example of a town devoted 
to preserving the story of America through reenactment. South Korea is 
host to the world's first museum devoted to the history and development 
of organic farming, the Namyangju Organic Museum, with exhibit captions 
in both Korean and English, and which opened in 2011.[127] The No Show 
Museum, based in Zurich and Johannesburg, is the world's first museum dedicated 
to nothing and its various manifestations throughout the history of art. 
Museums targeted for youth, such as children's museums or toy museums in 
many parts of the world, often exhibit interactive and educational material 
on a wide array of topics, for example, the Museum of Toys and Automata 
in Spain. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the "Borusseum", 
the museum about Borussia Dortmund in Dortmund, Germany, are institutions 
of the sports category. The Corning Museum of Glass is devoted to the art, 
history, and science of glass. The National Museum of Crime & Punishment 
explores the science of solving crimes. The Great American Dollhouse Museum 
in Danville, Kentucky, U.S.A., depicts American social history in miniature.[128] 
Interpretation centres are modern museums or visitors centres that often 
use new means of communication with the public. In some cases, museums 
cover an extremely wide range of topics together, such as the Museum of 
World Treasures in Wichita, KS. In other instances, museums emphasize regional 
culture and natural history, such as the Regional Museum of the National 
University of San Martin, Tarapoto, Peru. A development, with the expansion 
of the web, is the establishment of virtual museums. Online initiatives 
like the Virtual Museum of Canada[129] and the National Museum of the United 
States Air Force provide physical museums with a web presence, as well 
as online curatorial platforms such as Rhizome.[130] Some virtual museums 
have no counterpart in the real world, such as LIMAC (Museo de Arte Contemporáneo 
de Lima),[131] which has no physical location and might be confused with 
the city's own museum. The art historian Griselda Pollock elaborated a 
virtual feminist museum, spreading between classical art to contemporary 
art.[132] Some real life museums are also using the internet for virtual 
tours and exhibitions. In 2010, the Whitney Museum in New York organized 
what it called the first ever online Twitter museum tour.[133] Although 
zoos and botanical gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are 
in fact "living museums". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: 
to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop, and manage collections. 
They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. 
Notable zoos include the San Diego Zoo, the London Zoo, Brookfield Zoo 
at Chicago, Berlin Zoological Garden, the Bronx Zoo in New York City, Cincinnati 
Zoo and Botanical Garden, Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and Zürich Zoologischer 
Garten in Switzerland. Notable botanic gardens include Royal Botanic Gardens, 
Kew, Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Chicago Botanic Garden, Taipei Botanical
