John Arnold Heydler (July 10, 1869 – April 18, 1956) was an American executive 
in Major League Baseball. After working as a National League (NL) umpire, 
he was the secretary to the NL president and then became the secretary-treasurer 
of the NL before assuming the NL presidency himself. Heydler made early 
contributions to baseball recordkeeping and statistics. Born in La Fargeville, 
New York, Heydler was a printer's apprentice as a young man, and he eventually 
worked at the U.S. Government Printing Office. Heydler was an umpire (baseball) 
in the NL from 1895 to 1897, and then became a sportswriter. In 1903 he 
was hired as the private secretary to NL president Harry Pulliam, principally 
working to compile league playing statistics, a duty of every baseball 
league office. Heydler's work caused him to record much of the league's 
early history, and he became an advocate for new ways to measure player 
accomplishments; for example, he was a strong supporter of recording runs 
batted in for batters and he began computing earned run averages for pitchers. 
On becoming the NL's secretary-treasurer from 1907 to 1918, he served as 
the league president briefly after Pulliam's suicide in 1909. As NL president 
again from 1918 to 1934, he hired the Elias brothers to maintain as official 
keeper of playing statistics (1919), and he pushed for the selection of 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis as Commissioner of Baseball (1921), realizing the 
importance of an official who could keep the owners in check. Later he 
helped to establish the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1929 Heydler proposed 
permitting a tenth player to bat in place of the pitcher – a rule which 
came about with the creation of the designated hitter in 1973. After retiring 
as league president, he served as NL chairman until his death in San Diego,
