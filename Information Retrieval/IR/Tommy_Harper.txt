Tommy Harper (born October 14, 1940 in Oak Grove, Louisiana) is an American 
former Major League Baseball outfielder and third baseman. He played with 
the Cincinnati Reds (1962–67), Cleveland Indians (1968), Seattle Pilots 
(1969), Milwaukee Brewers (1970–71), Boston Red Sox (1972–74), California 
Angels (1975), Oakland Athletics (1975), and the Baltimore Orioles (1976). 
Harper played at Encinal High School in Alameda, California, where his 
teammates included Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Stargell and MLB player 
Curt Motton. He starred collegiately for San Francisco State University. 
Harper signed as an amateur free agent with the Reds before the 1960 season 
(as Major League Baseball had yet to institute a draft) and was assigned 
to Class B Topeka, where he had modest success. After hitting .324 for 
Topeka the following season, he was promoted all the way up to AAA San 
Diego where he hit .333 with 24 home runs and was even called up to the 
major league club, where he started 6 games at third base. In the 1963–64 
seasons, Harper was a platoon player for the Reds, working mostly as an 
outfielder. 1965 was his breakout season, as he became the Reds' starting 
left fielder and leadoff hitter, hitting 18 home runs, stealing 35 bases, 
and leading the National League with 126 runs scored. He would occupy the 
leadoff role for the next 3 seasons for the Reds, starting at all three 
outfield positions and serving as backup infielder until being traded to 
the Indians for 3 players following the 1967 season. Harper played only 
one season with the Indians, starting mostly in left and right field and 
seeing playing time at center field and second base as well. Although he 
struggled both with the bat and on the basepaths, he was drafted by the 
Seattle Pilots as the 3rd pick in the 1968 expansion draft. Harper was 
the first player to come to bat in Seattle Pilots history when he led off 
the top of the 1st against right-hander Jim McGlothlin of the California 
Angels. In that inaugural at bat, he was also the first Pilots player to 
record a hit, doubling to left field, and then scoring the Pilots first 
run on a home run by Mike Hegan. Harper led the American League with a 
career-high 73 stolen bases—the most by an American Leaguer since Ty Cobb's 
96 in 1915 and a mark that still stands today as a Pilots/Brewers record. 
He also showed his versatility in the field, making over 50 starts at both 
second and third base, 21 starts in center field, and also seeing playing 
time at both corner outfield positions. When the Pilots moved to Milwaukee 
and changed names the following season, Harper was also the first player 
to come to bat in Milwaukee Brewers history. On April 7, 1970, he led off 
the bottom of the 1st against California Angels right-hander Andy Messersmith. 
He hit a ground ball to third baseman Aurelio Rodríguez, who threw to first 
baseman Jim Spencer for the out. The 1970 season was probably the best 
statistically in Harper's career. He recorded career highs in hits, doubles, 
home runs, and RBIs on his way to the lone All-Star game appearance of 
his career. He also became the first Brewer, and just the fifth major leaguer 
at that point, to join the 30–30 club by hitting 31 home runs and stealing 
38 bases and come in 6th in the AL MVP voting. A second Brewer didn't join 
him in the 30–30 club until Ryan Braun accomplished the feat in 2011.[1] 
After his numbers fell off during the 1971 season, Harper was traded to 
the Red Sox as part of a 10-player trade following the season. Harper became 
the Sox' starting center fielder and leadoff hitter from 1972–74, playing 
well enough to earn him votes in the AL MVP balloting in '72 and '73. 1973 
was his best season with the club, as he led the league in stolen bases 
for the second time in his career, setting an all-time Red Sox mark with 
54, until Jacoby Ellsbury broke the record on August 25, 2009. After the 
1974 season, at age 34 and appearing to be in decline, he was traded to 
the California Angels for journeyman infielder Bob Heise. Harper played 
only part of the 1975 season for California. The Angels, well on their 
way to a last-place division finish, sold him for cash to the contending 
Oakland A's. Revitalized by the trade to a contender, Harper hit .319 in 
August and September for the A's and became their starting 1st baseman, 
also seeing spot duty in the outfield and at third base. Harper was also 
a perfect 7 of 7 in stolen base attempts. Harper was a key in Oakland's 
AL West championship drive not only because of his help with the bat, but 
also because his versatile fielding allowed the As to use the aging Billy 
Williams at DH where his still powerful bat was useful and where his play 
in the field was not a liability. Harper finally saw his first playoff 
action at age 34 after 14 major league seasons but would be limited to 
one plate appearance, a walk, as the A's were swept by his old team, the 
Red Sox. Harper was released by the A's after the season. Harper signed 
with the Orioles shortly before 1976 spring training. He played sparingly 
at DH, but his trademark blend of power and speed were gone, rendering 
him mostly a light-hitting pinch hitter. He was released by the Orioles 
following the season. Harper served as a coach for the Red Sox (1980–84; 
2000–02) and the Montreal Expos (1990–99). As of the start of the 2013 
season, he remained with Boston as a player development consultant. Harper 
successfully sued the Red Sox for firing him in 1985 for complaining in 
the media about the club allowing the segregated Elks Club in its spring 
training base of Winter Haven, Florida, to invite only the team's white 
personnel to its establishment.[2] Harper was elected to the Boston Red
