Abner Frank Dalrymple (September 9, 1857 â€“ January 25, 1939) was an American 
left fielder in Major League Baseball who hit 43 home runs (including 22 
in 1884, the second-highest total to that date) and batted .288 during 
his 12-season career spent primarily with the Chicago White Stockings. 
Born in Gratiot, Wisconsin, he played for the Milwaukee Grays, White Stockings, 
Pittsburgh Alleghenys, and Milwaukee Brewers. Dalrymple started his major 
league career in 1878 with the National League's Milwaukee Grays, and that 
season, he had a career-high .354 batting average.[1] He spent the next 
eight seasons with the Chicago White Stockings, for whom he starred as 
the leadoff hitter on five NL pennant winners. In 1880, Dalrymple led the 
league in hits (126) and runs scored (91). In 1881, he became the first 
batter known to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. He 
hit four doubles in a game in 1883, which still ties him for the major 
league record. In 1884, aided by the short right field fence at his home 
park, Dalrymple hit a career-high 22 home runs and moved into sixth place 
on the all-time home run list. On the strength of 11 home runs for the 
1885 champions, he moved up one place. For the remainder of his career, 
he hit only six home runs. His hitting declined in 1886, and his major 
league career ended five years later. Dalrymple died in Warren, Illinois
