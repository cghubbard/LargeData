The following is a list of Detroit Tigers broadcasters, past and present: 
The current flagship radio stations for the Detroit Tigers are WXYT, at 
1270 AM, and WXYT-FM, at 97.1, both sports stations.[1] Dan Dickerson calls 
play-by-play while former Tiger catcher Jim Price serves as color analyst; 
both double as pre-game and post-game show hosts.[2] The games are simulcast 
on both stations unless there is a conflict with Detroit Red Wings hockey 
or Detroit Lions football. WJR was the Tigers' flagship station from 1964-2000. 
Other former Tigers flagships include WWJ, WXYT (currently known as "CBS 
Sports Radio 1270") and WKMH (currently known as WDTW off the air since 
2013). The television rights are currently held by Fox Sports Detroit, 
in an exclusive contract that runs until 2018.[6] Mario Impemba serves 
as the play-by-play announcer, while former Tiger players Rod Allen, Kirk 
Gibson, and Jack Morris rotate color analyst duties.[7] Pre-game and post-game 
show hosts and reporters include John Keating, Mickey York, Trevor Thompson, 
Justin White, and Johnny Kane, while Craig Monroe provides studio analysis. 
The Tigers have spent most of their broadcast televised history across 
two of Detroit's heritage "Big Three" network stations, WJBK (Channel 2, 
Fox; formerly with CBS from 1948 to 1994) and WDIV (Channel 4, NBC; originally 
WWJ-TV from 1947 to 1978), as well as two of the market's former legacy 
independent stations, WMYD (Channel 20, formerly WXON-TV and WDWB) and 
WKBD (Channel 50). Channel 4 was the original Tiger television outlet, 
carrying games from 1947 to 1952, and again for a twenty-season run from 
1975 to 1994. Channel 4, at least during a time when NBC's ratings were 
sagging during the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, was one of a handful of 
the network's affiliates that was either a primary outlet or an affiliate 
of the local/regional baseball team. WJBK took over the Tigers telecasts 
starting with the 1953 season, and carried games until the end of the 1974 
season; since 2007, the station simulcasts the team's home opener each 
season from Fox Sports Detroit. WKBD, for many years known as Detroit's 
leading independent TV station, as well as the longtime over-the-air TV 
home of the Red Wings and Pistons, televised Tigers games starting in 1995 
(when it was an UPN owned-and-operated station) until 2003. WMYD televised 
selected Tigers games only for the 2006 season, and as WXON-TV and the 
local affiliate of the ONTV subscription TV service, Channel 20 also showed 
the team's games from 1981 to 1983. Pro-Am Sports System (PASS), originally 
started in 1982, became the regional cable outlet for the Tigers starting 
in 1984, after the network by purchased by then-Tigers team owner Tom Monaghan. 
Monaghan sold PASS to Post-Newsweek Stations (now Graham Media Group) in 
1992, after he sold the Tigers to local pizza magnate and Red Wings owner 
Mike Illitch. PASS, thereafter, re-located its operations to the WDIV studio/office 
facility in Downtown Detroit. PASS shut down operations in 1997, after 
the Red Wings, Tigers, and Pistons all elected to sign-with and helped
