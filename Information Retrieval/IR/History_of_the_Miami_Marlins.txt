The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball team that currently plays 
in the city of Miami. Founded in 1991 as the Florida Marlins, the Marlins 
began play in 1993 in the suburb of Miami Gardens, and moved to the city 
in 2012, becoming the Miami Marlins at that time. On March 7, 1990, Wayne 
Huizenga, CEO of Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation, announced he had 
purchased 15 percent of the NFL's Miami Dolphins and 50 percent of the 
Dolphins' home, Joe Robbie Stadium, for an estimated $30 million. Huizenga 
stated his intention to aggressively pursue an expansion franchise. MLB 
had announced a few months earlier that it intended to add two new teams 
to the National League. It was a foregone conclusion that one of them would 
be placed in Florida; the only question was whether Huizenga would beat 
out competing groups from Orlando and Tampa Bay. Orlando fielded a very 
spirited campaign bolstered by its family-oriented tourism industry. Tampa 
Bay already had a baseball park—the Florida Suncoast Dome in St. Petersburg, 
completed in 1990. However, on June 10, 1991, the National League awarded 
a Miami-based franchise to Huizenga for a $95 million expansion fee. One 
name considered early on was the Florida Flamingos.[1] The franchise adopted 
the nickname "Marlins" from previous minor league teams, the Miami Marlins 
of the International League from 1956 to 1960, and the Miami Marlins (1962–70) 
and Miami Marlins (1982–88) teams that played in the Florida State League. 
In November 1991, the Marlins hired Fredi González as the Marlins first 
Minor League manager. On December 16, 1991, they made their first-ever 
signing, inking 16-year-old Dominican pitcher Clemente Núñez to a contract.[2] 
They selected catcher Charles Johnson of the University of Miami with their 
first-ever first round draft pick in June 1992. Later that year Marlins 
President Carl Barger collapsed and died at the baseball winter meetings 
in Louisville, Kentucky. The Marlins later retired the number 5 in honor 
of Barger's favorite player, Joe DiMaggio, but would put the number back 
into circulation when they moved to the city of Miami in 2012, honoring 
Barger instead with a plaque at the new Marlins Park. The Marlins' first 
manager was Rene Lachemann, a former catcher who had previously managed 
the Seattle Mariners and Milwaukee Brewers, and who at the time of his 
hiring was a third base coach for the Oakland Athletics. The team drafted 
its initial lineup of players in the 1992 MLB Expansion Draft. The Marlins 
defeated the Houston Astros 12–8 in their inaugural Spring training game. 
Jeff Conine hit Florida's first homer before a crowd of 6,696 at the Cocoa 
Expo Sports Complex. The Marlins won their first game on April 5, 1993, 
against the Dodgers. Charlie Hough was the starting pitcher for that game. 
Jeff Conine went 4-4 as well, making him an immediate crowd favorite. By 
the end of his tenure with Florida, he would earn the nickname "Mr. Marlin." 
Gary Sheffield and Bryan Harvey represented the Marlins as the club's first 
All-Star Game selections, and Sheffield homered in the Marlins first All-Star 
Game at-bat. The team finished the year five games ahead of the last-place 
New York Mets and with an attendance of 3,064,847. In that season, the 
Marlins traded their young set-up reliever Trevor Hoffman and two minor-league 
prospects to the San Diego Padres for third baseman Gary Sheffield. While 
Sheffield helped Florida immediately and became an all-star, Hoffman eventually 
emerged as the best closer in the National League. After the 1993 season, 
Donald A. Smiley was named the second President in club history. The Marlins 
finished last (51–64) in their division in the strike-shortened season 
of 1994 and fourth (67-76) in 1995. Lachemann was replaced as manager midway 
through the 1996 season by director of player development John Boles. The 
Marlins had some bright spots on the mound and behind the plate in 1996. 
The team's 3.95 ERA ranked third in the NL, thanks in large part to newcomer 
Kevin Brown, who finished the season with a 17–11 win-loss record and an 
impressive 1.89 ERA. On May 11, Al Leiter pitched the first no-hitter in 
Marlins history. Catcher Charles Johnson led the league with a .995 fielding 
percentage, threw out a league-high 48 percent of base runners, and collected 
his second straight Gold Glove Award for fielding excellence. After a slow 
start, the Marlins finished the year with an 80–82 win-loss record to place 
third in their division. Boles returned to his previous position as director 
of player development, and former Pittsburgh Pirates manager Jim Leyland 
was hired to lead the club in 1997. In addition to hiring Leyland as manager, 
the Marlins signed third baseman Bobby Bonilla, outfielder Moisés Alou, 
and pitcher Alex Fernandez to lucrative free-agent contracts, raising expectations 
to levels far beyond anything in franchise history. The Marlins franchise 
got its second no-hitter from ace Kevin Brown on June 10, 1997. Brown nearly 
had the perfect game, but he hit the Giants' Marvin Benard with a pitch 
in the 8th inning when Benard attempted to bunt. With Brown, Leiter, and 
Fernandez heading the rotation, and Robb Nen closing out games, the Marlins' 
staff was almost systematic during their regular season run. In 1997, the 
Marlins finished nine games back of the Division Champion Atlanta Braves, 
but earned the wild card berth. Veteran additions such as LF Moisés Alou, 
3B Bobby Bonilla, and trade-deadline additions Darren Daulton and Jim Eisenreich 
added experience and clutch hits. Talented young stars Luis Castillo (2B) 
and Édgar Rentería (SS) comprised one of the best double play combos in 
the League. Castillo did not perform to expectations offensively, and was 
replaced by Craig Counsell before the playoffs began. The Marlins swept 
the San Francisco Giants 3–0 in the National League Division Series, and 
then went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 4–2 in the National League Championship 
Series, overcoming the loss of Alex Fernandez to a torn rotator cuff, and 
Kevin Brown to a virus. Brown's place was taken in Game 5 by rookie pitcher 
Liván Hernández, who had earned a spot in the rotation in the second half 
of the season, but was not in the rotation during the postseason. Hernandez 
struck out 15 Braves and outdueled multiple Cy Young Award winner Greg 
Maddux to a 2–1 victory and a 3–2 series lead. Brown returned to the mound 
for Game 6, pitching a complete game victory to secure the Marlins their 
first-ever National League pennant. The underdog Marlins went on to face 
the Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series, and won in seven games. 
In Game 7, Craig Counsell's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth tied 
the game at 2, then, with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of 
the 11th, Édgar Rentería's soft liner glanced off the glove of Cleveland 
pitcher Charles Nagy and into center field to score Counsell and give the 
Marlins the win. Following the World Series victory, Huizenga dismantled 
the team, claiming financial losses despite winning the World Series. He 
traded most of the club's best players in one of the biggest fire sales 
in sports history. The first deal came days after the World Series, when 
outfieldler Moisés Alou was traded to the Houston Astros for pitchers Oscar 
Hernandez and Manuel Barrios. The Marlins then traded Kevin Brown to the 
San Diego Padres for Derrek Lee and 2 minor leaguers. Finally, in May 1998, 
they dealt Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich, 
and Manuel Barrios to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Mike Piazza and Todd 
Zeile, both of whom would be gone via trades by midseason. On the flip 
side, these trades brought promising youngsters Derrek Lee and A. J. Burnett. 
The Marlins slumped to 54–108 in 1998, the worst record in the major leagues 
that year, and the most losses in franchise history. They are the only 
team to lose 100 games a year after winning the World Series. Leyland resigned 
as manager in October 1998, and was replaced by John Boles. Huizenga soon 
sold the club to John Henry, a commodities trader from Boca Raton, during 
the off-season. The Marlins had the second overall pick in the 1999 draft 
and drafted Josh Beckett, a high school pitcher from the Houston area. 
In 1999, the Marlins were the first MLB team to host a game in which instant 
replay was used.[3] While playing the Cardinals, Cliff Floyd hit a ball 
to the top of the left field scoreboard. Originally ruled a home run, NL 
umpire Frank Pulli reversed the call to a double, after consulting a dugout 
TV monitor. The Cardinals won the game, 5–2. After the game, the NL League 
Office declared the umpires erred in using instant replay. MLB would not 
use instant replay again for almost a decade.[4] The Marlins finished the 
1999 season with the worst record in baseball at 64–98, and traded World 
Series MVP Liván Hernández to the San Francisco Giants. The Marlins also 
drafted P Johan Santana from Houston in the Rule 5 draft but traded him 
to Minnesota in a prearranged deal for P Jared Camp. A month prior to the 
regular season, the Marlins hired David Dombrowski as the third President 
in club history, making him both President and General Manager. After posting 
the worst record in baseball for the 1999 season, the Marlins had the first 
overall pick in the 2000 first-year player draft and selected first baseman 
Adrian Gonzalez, an 18-year-old native of Bonita, California. The Eastlake 
High School product agreed to terms with the Marlins that same day. The 
Marlins went on that season to finish 79–82 and third in the NL East. This 
was thanks to the emergence of OF Preston Wilson who had 31 home runs and 
121 RBIs. Derrek Lee and Luis Castillo broke out this year as well, as 
Castillo posted a .334 batting average and Lee had 28 homers in his first 
full season. Antonio Alfonseca posted a then-club record 45 saves. The 
club slowly worked its way back to respectability with a third-place finish 
in 2000, driven by young stars such as A. J. Burnett, Brad Penny, Preston 
Wilson, Luis Castillo, and Mike Lowell. Burnett pitched the Marlins' third 
no-hitter on May 12, 2001, against the Padres, despite walking nine batters 
and throwing only half of his pitches for strikes. Three weeks after the 
no-no, Manager John Boles was fired and Hall of Famer Tony Pérez was named 
interim manager for the rest of the season. The club finished 76–86 and 
in fourth place, thanks to Brad Penny's and A. J. Burnett's emergence. 
The offseason following the 2001 regular season included an overhaul of 
the ownership and front office. Tony Pérez resigned and returned to his 
previous role as the front-office Baseball Operations assistant. About 
a month later, David Dombrowski resigned as President and General Manager 
of the Florida Marlins and accepted the position as President of the Detroit 
Tigers. Entering the new year, Henry sold the Marlins to Montreal Expos 
owner Jeffrey Loria, clearing the way for Henry to buy the Boston Red Sox. 
Loria brought the entire Expos management and coaching staff to the Marlins. 
David Samson became team president, Larry Beinfest became General Manager 
and Jeff Torborg became manager. Prior to the 2002 season, the Marlins 
traded RHP Matt Clement and RHP Antonio Alfonseca to the Cubs for RHP Julián 
Tavárez, LHP Dontrelle Willis, RHP Jose Cueto and C Ryan Jorgensen. The 
Marlins had their ups as Luis Castillo had a team record 35-game hitting 
streak and Kevin Millar had a 25-game hit streak. Around the All-Star break 
they made their second big trade, sending OF Cliff Floyd to the Expos for 
RHP Carl Pavano, RHP Justin Wayne, INF Mike Mordecai, LHP Graeme Lloyd, 
RHP Don Levinski and INF Wilton Guerrero. The same day, the Fish dealt 
RHP Ryan Dempster to the Cincinnati Reds for OF Juan Encarnación and LHP 
Ryan Snare. The Marlins finished 79–83, the second-best season in team 
history up to that time, but their fifth straight losing season since winning 
the World Series. The Marlins also turned their first ever triple play 
in franchise history on July 28, 2002. During the offseason, the Marlins 
signed free agent catcher Iván Rodríguez – a 10-time Gold Glove Award winner 
– and acquired speedy outfielder Juan Pierre from the Colorado Rockies 
hoping to offset the loss of sluggers Cliff Floyd and Preston Wilson. The 
Marlins did acquire P Mike Hampton but dealt him and his hefty contract 
to the Braves for P Tim Spooneybarger. The Marlins struggled in the opening 
stages of the season, going 16–22. During that span, Florida lost its top 
three pitchers: A. J. Burnett, Josh Beckett, and Mark Redman. On May 11, 
Florida replaced manager Jeff Torborg with 72-year-old Jack McKeon. On 
May 22, the Marlins hit bottom with a major league worst record of 19–29, 
having lost 6 straight games. However, help was on the way. On May 9, the 
Marlins called up high-kicking southpaw Dontrelle Willis from the Double-A 
Carolina Mudcats and helped carry the injury-plagued Marlins with an 11–2 
record in his first 17 starts. Miguel Cabrera (also from the Mudcats) filled 
in well, hitting a walk off home run in his first major league game, against 
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Pro Player Stadium. Both Willis and Cabrera 
would later prove to be essential parts of the Marlin's playoff success. 
Jeff Conine – an original Marlin and member of the 1997 World Series team 
– returned from Baltimore, and closer Ugueth Urbina arrived from the Texas 
Rangers. These acquisitions helped to keep the team in contention, and 
although they finished ten games behind the Braves, the Marlins captured 
the NL wild card. The Marlins won the Division Series against the favored 
San Francisco Giants three games to one. The series ended with a dramatic 
collision between Marlins catcher Rodríguez and Giants first baseman J. 
T. Snow, making it the first postseason series ever to end with the potential 
tying run being thrown out at the plate. It was the second time that the 
Marlins defeated the Giants in the Division Series, having done so in 1997. 
On October 15, the Marlins defeated the Chicago Cubs four games to three 
in the Championship Series, coming back from a three games to one deficit. 
A Beckett complete-game shutout in Game 5 kept the Marlins alive. Game 
6 saw the Marlins play a role in one of baseball's most infamous moments: 
"The Inning" . With 1 one out in the 8th inning and the Cubs 3 runs ahead, 
Marlins 2nd baseman Luis Castillo hit a pop foul a row into the stands 
along the third base line. Cubs fan Steve Bartman reached for the ball, 
preventing Cubs LF Moisés Alou from making the out and setting off an 8-run 
Marlins rally. The incident with Steve Bartman and a come-from-behind win 
in Wrigley Field in Game 7 helped the Marlins capture their second NL pennant, 
keeping the "Curse of the Billy Goat" alive and well. In the 2003 World 
Series, the Marlins defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees in six 
games, winning the sixth game in Yankee Stadium. Shortstop Álex González 
helped the Marlins in Game 4 of the series with a walk off home run in 
extra innings. Josh Beckett was named the Most Valuable Player for the 
series after twirling a five-hit complete-game shutout in Game 6. Skipper 
Jack McKeon became the oldest manager ever to win a World Series title. 
The Marlins became the first opposing team to win a Series championship 
on the field at Yankee Stadium since 1981, when the Los Angeles Dodgers 
did it. The Marlins are also the last team to win a World Series at the 
original Yankee Stadium; the Yankees themselves would not participate in 
another World Series until 2009, when they defeated the then-defending 
champion Philadelphia Phillies at the new Yankee Stadium. The Marlins won 
the series despite scoring fewer runs (17) than the Yankees (21). The offseason 
after their second World Series title, the Marlins made a questionable 
cost-cutting move as Derrek Lee was traded to Chicago Cubs for Hee-seop 
Choi and pitcher Mike Nannini. The Marlins also lost key parts of their 
second championship team, Ugueth Urbina and Iván Rodríguez left via free 
agency (signed by the Detroit Tigers). Marlins third base coach Ozzie Guillén 
also departed to be manager of the Chicago White Sox. The Marlins did get 
good news though as Dontrelle Willis was named NL Rookie of the Year and 
Jack McKeon named Manager of the Year. They also signed Mike Lowell to 
a new four-year contract. After winning the 2003 World Series, the Marlins 
entered 2004 with high hopes and a retooled roster. Retaining a core of 
stars from their title team and hoping that newly acquired 1B Hee-seop 
Choi would emerge, the Marlins fell short of reaching the postseason, but 
they posted the third winning season in franchise history, boasting an 
83-79 record. During the season, the Marlins were to make one of the biggest 
trades in club history as Los Angeles got P Brad Penny, 1B Choi and Double-A 
left-hander Bill Murphy in exchange for P Guillermo Mota, C Paul Lo Duca 
and OF Juan Encarnación. Pitchers Carl Pavano and Armando Benítez turned 
in record-setting performances. Pavano went 18-8 with a 3.30 ERA, and his 
18 wins established a season high by a Marlin. Benitez became the club's 
season saves leader with 47 (in 51 saves attempts). Pavano, Benitez, Mike 
Lowell and Miguel Cabrera each enjoyed All-Star seasons, with Cabrera belting 
33 homers (second-most ever in a season by a Marlin) while driving in 112 
runs. While losing All-Stars Carl Pavano and Armando Benítez in the off-season, 
the Marlins signed P Al Leiter and 1B Carlos Delgado. Delgado's contract 
was the biggest in franchise history at $52 million over 4 years, with 
an option for a fifth year. Meanwhile, play-by-play TV broadcaster Len 
Kasper was also lost to the Chicago Cubs and replaced by Rich Waltz (who 
had previously been with the Seattle Mariners), and radio announcer John 
"Boog" Sciambi was replaced by Roxy Bernstein. With the addition of Delgado, 
many sportswriters expected the Marlins to finish the 2005 season in either 
first or second place in the NL East. However, at the All-Star break they 
were 44–42, and the NL East was unusually competitive, as all five of its 
teams had a winning record at the break. While Cabrera, Willis, and several 
others posted very good first-half numbers, Lowell was one of the least 
productive regular major-league starters, and Leiter went 3–7 with an ERA 
of 6.64 before being traded to the New York Yankees on July 15 for a player 
to be named later. Additionally, Guillermo Mota, who was acquired by Florida 
in 2004 along with Paul Lo Duca and Juan Encarnación and was expected to 
be their closer, was inconsistent, and the Marlins gave the closer job 
to veteran Todd Jones, whom they signed in the offseason. However, the 
Marlins did send four players to the All-Star Game (Willis, Lo Duca, Castillo, 
and Cabrera), tying a team record. The club was expected to be quite active 
at the trading deadline (July 31), as Burnett was slated to be a free agent 
after the season and had already declared his desire to test the market 
like Pavano did. Burnett was mentioned in possible trades with the Chicago 
White Sox, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Toronto Blue Jays, and Texas 
Rangers, with many rumors also including Lowell or Encarnacion. The Marlins 
did not make a huge move at the deadline, instead trading minor-leaguer 
Yorman Bazardo to the Seattle Mariners for left-handed pitcher Ron Villone. 
The Marlins did have some pleasant surprises during the season. Dontrelle 
Willis became the 13th member of the Black Aces when he defeated the Washington 
Nationals to earn his 20th win. He finished the season 22-10 with a 2.63 
ERA, and he was considered a favorite to win the Cy Young Award for much 
of the season. Also, Jones, a journeyman who had been signed as a setup 
man, had one of the best years of his career as a closer; he earned 40 
saves and had a 2.13 ERA. In addition, late-season call up Jeremy Hermida, 
a highly regarded prospect who has been compared to the Atlanta Braves' 
Jeff Francoeur, hit a pinch-hit grand slam in his first major-league at-bat 
and a game-tying two-run homer in the last game of the season. The Marlins 
led the NL wild-card race as late as September 13, then lost 12 of their 
next 14 games. The Marlins closed the season by sweeping the Braves, and 
their final record for the season stood at 83–79. After the season, lingering 
stadium issues forced the Marlins to ponder big moves with their roster 
and also ponder possible relocation to another city. The 2005 offseason 
would prove to be one of busiest for the Marlins in years, Jack McKeon 
announced his retirement on October 2 after the Marlins' last game of the 
season. Former Tampa Bay Devil Rays manager Lou Piniella, Braves third 
base coach Fredi González (who previously managed in the Marlins' farm 
system), New York Yankees bench coach Joe Girardi, and even Yankees manager 
Joe Torre who most thought could have been let go after a short stint postseason, 
were named as possible replacements for McKeon.[5] On October 19, Girardi 
was hired as the new manager. Girardi, who was hired at age 41, became 
one of the youngest current managers in the major leagues at the time.[6] 
Few of the coaching staff, aside from infield/first base coach Perry Hill 
and bullpen coordinator Pierre Arsenault, were expected to return. Pitching 
coach Mark Wiley and bullpen coach Luis Dorante came under fire during 
the season due to the late-season struggles of Burnett and the season-long 
struggles of the Marlins' bullpen. Similarly, hitting coach Bill Robinson 
was often blamed for the Marlins' offensive woes throughout the season, 
and in particular for his failure to get Pierre and Lowell out of season-long 
slumps. Girardi hired Jim Presley as a replacement for Robinson, and also 
hired Rick Kranitz as the new pitching coach and Bobby Meacham as the new 
third-base coach. On October 3, the first day after the end of the regular 
season, the Marlins made their first offseason moves, releasing relief 
pitchers John Riedling and Tim Spooneybarger. Riedling had a 4–1 record 
and a 7.14 ERA during the season; Spooneybarger, who had not played since 
2003 due to rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery, had to have the surgery 
a second time during the season and missed the 2006 season as well. Screwball 
specialist Jim Mecir retired following the Marlins' last game of the season. 
Closer Todd Jones, pitchers A. J. Burnett, Brian Moehler, Ismael Valdéz, 
Paul Quantrill, first baseman Jeff Conine, infielder Lenny Harris, outfielder 
Juan Encarnación, and shortstop Álex González were among the Marlins' players 
whose contracts expired following the 2005 season. Burnett signed a five-year 
deal with the Toronto Blue Jays worth $55 million and Jones signed for 
two years with the Detroit Tigers, while Moehler elected to remain with 
the Marlins. The team declined to offer arbitration to Conine, Valdéz, 
Quantrill, Encarnación, Damion Easley, and Mike Mordecai, effectively ending 
their tenures with the club.[7] Soon after announcing a plan to relocate 
(see below), the Marlins started to shed payroll by dealing their highest-paid 
players for minor league prospects, in a series of moves reminiscent of 
the "fire sale" in the 1997 offseason. In response, the club announced 
that it was, in their opinion, a "market correction", brought about by 
the lack of a stadium deal.[8] On November 24, Josh Beckett, Mike Lowell, 
and Guillermo Mota were traded to the Red Sox for four minor-league prospects: 
shortstop Hanley Ramírez, and pitchers Aníbal Sánchez, Jesús Delgado, and 
Harvey García. The trade left Dontrelle Willis as the only remaining member 
of the team's 2005 Opening Day rotation. The Marlins filled most of the 
remaining rotation spots with young pitchers such as Jason Vargas, Josh 
Johnson, and Scott Olsen, all of whom they had recalled from their Class 
AA affiliate during the 2005 season.[9] On November 23, the Mets and the 
Marlins agreed on a deal to move Carlos Delgado to the Mets for first baseman 
Mike Jacobs and pitching prospect Yusmeiro Petit. Also, the Marlins would 
have to pay $7 million of Delgado's remaining contract. When the deal was 
made official the next day, the Marlins also received minor-league infielder 
Grant Psomas. According to the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, the Marlins 
passed up the Mets' offer to give them center fielder Lastings Milledge, 
who was at the time ranked the Mets' top prospect according to Baseball 
America.[10] Combined, the two trades allowed the Marlins to reduce their 
2006 payroll by $27 million. However, the Marlins were not yet done reducing 
payroll. Paul Lo Duca was traded to the Mets for two players to be named 
later, with the Marlins sending pitcher Gabriel Hernandez and outfielder 
Dante Brinkley to New York to complete the deal. Longtime second baseman 
Luis Castillo was traded to the Twins for pitchers Travis Bowyer and Scott 
Tyler, and Juan Pierre to the Cubs for pitchers Sergio Mitre, Ricky Nolasco, 
and Renyel Pinto. Of the seven players that the Marlins acquired in these 
three deals, only Mitre and Bowyer had any major-league experience when 
they came to the Marlins. To replace Castillo, the Marlins signed veteran 
Pokey Reese, but Reese was released during spring training after going 
AWOL, and was replaced by Dan Uggla, who had been selected from the Arizona 
Diamondbacks in the Rule 5 draft. Uggla played in the Arizona organization 
at the Class AA level in 2005. At the start of the year, the Marlins had 
a team salary close to $21 million. Not only was it the lowest team salary 
in all of MLB, but New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez alone 
made more money than the entire Marlins team. The Marlins made MLB history 
when they started six rookies in their Opening Day lineup.[11] Sporting 
the league's youngest team, the Marlins were predicted before the season 
to lose more than 100 games. Instead, the youthful squad greatly exceeded 
expectations, often in historical fashion. After getting off to an 11-31 
start, the Marlins found themselves at 73-72 on September 12, making them 
the first team in the modern baseball era to improve to better than .500 
after being as much as 20 games under .500. Also, for the first time in 
MLB history, four rookies topped double digits in wins: Josh Johnson, Scott 
Olsen, Ricky Nolasco and Aníbal Sánchez. On September 6, 2006, Sanchez 
threw the fourth no-hitter in franchise history, beating Arizona, 2-0, 
at Dolphin Stadium. Miguel Cabrera finished second in the N.L. in batting 
average, and set a franchise season mark with his .339 average. Dan Uggla 
became the first Rule 5 pick to be selected to the All-Star Game in the 
season in which he was drafted and won Sporting News Rookie of the Year 
for the National League and won the Players' Choice award as the league's 
most outstanding rookie. Hanley Ramírez won the N.L. Rookie of the Year 
Award, and Joe Girardi was voted N.L. Manager of the Year. Dan Uggla finished 
third in the voting and starting pitcher Josh Johnson, fourth; starting 
pitchers Scott Olsen and Aníbal Sánchez and left fielder Josh Willingham 
received one third-place vote each. Additionally, the Marlins had four 
of their rookie starting pitchers (Aníbal Sánchez, Josh Johnson, Scott 
Olsen, and Ricky Nolasco) win at least ten games, becoming the first team 
in major-league history to do so. The 2006 Marlins also had five ten-game 
winners for the first time in franchise history (including Dontrelle Willis). 
Shortly after the 2006 season ended and following months of speculation, 
Marlins manager Joe Girardi was fired on October 3, 2006 not long after 
winning the National League Manager of the Year award. This was due to 
a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers earlier in the year in which Girardi 
did not challenge a call that pitcher Taylor Tankersley thought was a strike 
and this prompted owner Jeffrey Loria, who was in the stands and a few 
feet away from the dugout, to call out Girardi who refused to listen to 
him. This wasn't the only thing that triggered the feud; earlier in the 
year Girardi reportedly wanted 1B Mike Jacobs to start off the year in 
triple A, Willingham to start at catcher, Miguel Cabrera to start at first 
base.[12] Within hours, Atlanta Braves third base coach Fredi González 
was named his replacement and was signed to a three-year contract. After 
a 2006 season which saw them defy expectations time and again, the Marlins 
entered 2007 hanging on to the belief that they could compete with anyone. 
It didn't turn out that way. Injuries ravaged the starting rotation and 
the Marlins struggled all season, ultimately finishing in last place in 
the National League East for the first time since 1999. Josh Johnson underwent 
Tommy John surgery and Aníbal Sánchez had right shoulder surgery. Ricky 
Nolasco dealt with a sore elbow all season. Suddenly, the strength of the 
team—the starting rotation—was minus three key players. Despite a disappointing 
finish, there certainly were a number of highs—Kevin Gregg emerged as a 
dominant closer, Hanley Ramírez developed into a legitimate superstar and 
Miguel Cabrera proved why he already was one—but none of them could ultimately 
overcome the odds heavily stacked against the Marlins. On the downside, 
southpaws Dontrelle Willis and Scott Olsen had disappointing campaigns. 
What was encouraging was an otherwise disappointing season ended on a high 
note. The team won five of six to end the season (sweeping the Cubs and 
taking two of three with the Mets at Shea Stadium). Still, after the season, 
the franchise went in a different direction. The year was capped by the 
trading of their two biggest stars, slugger Miguel Cabrera and pitcher 
Dontrelle Willis. Talks with both the Los Angeles Angels and San Francisco 
Giants fell apart. On December 5, 2007, the Marlins agreed to the terms 
of a trade with the Detroit Tigers. The trade would surprisingly send not 
only Cabrera, but also Willis, to the Tigers. In return, the Marlins did 
not receive four players, but six. The Marlins received center fielder 
Cameron Maybin, catcher Mike Rabelo, and pitchers Andrew Miller, Eulogio 
De La Cruz, Burke Badenhop, and Dallas Trahern. The Marlins did have some 
bright spots on offense as they set club records for runs scored (790), 
hits (1,504), doubles (340), home runs (201), RBIs (749) and slugging percentage 
(.448). As the Marlins wrapped up the season they announced that pitching 
coach Rick Kranitz would not be back with the club and extended Larry Beinfest 
and Michael Hill to long term deals that run through 2015 along with promotions 
to President of Baseball Operations and Vice President/General Manager, 
respectively.,[13][14] The Marlins began 2008 on a positive note. Analysts 
expected a lackluster performance on the field, citing the low payroll 
and loss of Dontrelle Willis and Miguel Cabrera during the offseason. However, 
the Marlins got off to one of the best starts in team history. At one point 
the Marlins were 30–20, the first time since September 14, 2005 the team 
had been 10 games over .500. They jumped atop of the National League East 
in April and May, the first time since 2002 that they held the lead that 
late in the season. The good start was attributed to powerful offensive 
production from their core of Mike Jacobs, Hanley Ramírez, Dan Uggla, Josh 
Willingham, and Jorge Cantú and quality pitching by southpaw Scott Olsen 
and right-hander Ricky Nolasco. The Marlins' hot start made them a rare 
buyer at the July trade deadline, where they were involved in talks on 
a three-way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Boston Red Sox which could 
have brought Manny Ramírez to South Florida. The Marlins backed out at 
the last second when trade talks turned to their coveted power-hitting 
prospect, Giancarlo Stanton. Instead, Manny Ramírez ended up with the Dodgers 
and the Marlins wound up trading for Arthur Rhodes. The team also received 
encouraging news when injured pitcher Josh Johnson made a fast recovery 
from Tommy John surgery and Aníbal Sánchez came back from a torn labrum 
in the shoulder, both leaping into the rotation right away along with newly 
called up prized prospect Chris Volstad. In addition, the Marlins sent 
two players, Hanley Ramírez, who started the game at shortstop, and reserve 
Dan Uggla to the last All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium. The Marlins signed 
Hanley Ramírez to a 6-year, $70 million deal, making him the richest Marlin 
in history. The team struggled in the month of August, when they went 11–16 
due to lack of the offense they had in the early part of the season. In 
September, the Marlins rallied with a nine-game winning streak, tying the 
franchise record, thanks in part to prized prospect, Cameron Maybin. However 
they lost four straight afterwards and were eliminated from playoff contention, 
although but they did manage to eliminate the New York Mets for the second 
consecutive season on the final day, winning the final game at Shea Stadium, 
4-2. The team finished with a franchise record for most home runs in a 
season at 208. Mike Jacobs, Dan Uggla, Hanley Ramírez and Jorge Cantú made 
MLB history by becoming the first foursome of infielders to hit at least 
25 homers in a season. Just a day after the World Series concluded, the 
Marlins began wheeling and dealing. They traded first baseman Mike Jacobs 
to the Royals for reliever Leo Núñez, who the Marlins hoped could become 
a setup-man in late innings. A few weeks later, the Marlins traded power 
hitting outfielder Josh Willingham and southpaw Scott Olsen to the Nationals 
for utility player Emilio Bonifacio and two minor leaguers. Soon after 
the Marlins traded closer Kevin Gregg to the Cubs for relief prospect José 
Ceda. A few weeks before the regular season, the Florida Marlins' 15-year 
quest for a permanent home became a reality by agreeing to bankroll a big 
share of a $634 million stadium complex to rise on the grounds of the old 
Orange Bowl site. The Marlins hoped to open at the new stadium on Opening 
Day 2012 with a new name of Miami Marlins. The Marlins kicked off the new 
season with the youngest team in baseball and with the lowest payroll for 
the fourth consecutive season. New leadoff man Emilio Bonifacio stole the 
show on Opening Day. He hit the first Opening Day inside-the-park home 
run since Carl Yastrzemski did it for the Boston Red Sox in 1968 and had 
three stolen bases to go along with four hits. Hanley Ramírez hit his first 
career grand slam as the Marlins went on to score 12 runs, the most ever 
in franchise history on Opening Day. The Marlins started the 2009 season 
hot by sweeping the Washington Nationals, only the second time they started 
the season with sweep since the 1997 Marlins team. The Marlins won their 
first four games for the first time in franchise history and started 11–1, 
which included 2 out of 3 wins from the Mets, the first Marlins franchise 
sweep at Turner Field, and three comeback late-inning wins against the 
Nationals in Washington, sweeping the teams' second series matchup. The 
11–1 start was the best start in Marlins history. They then lost their 
next seven games starting with the 62-99 Pittsburgh Pirates making them 
the first team in NL history to win seven straight games then lose the 
next seven. But even though they were below .500 by as many as five games, 
they rebounded to 2 games above .500 as of July 1, 2009. Cody Ross, the 
leader of the rebound, hit 2 grand slams in 2 weeks. The Marlins also amazed 
many in the final series before the All-Star break against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. Originally trailing by seven runs after five innings, the 
Marlins entered the eighth inning down 7-4, they sent 14 batters to the 
plate. In the benchmark frame, they collected eight hits, and had eight 
different players score for a total of ten runs in the inning. In all the 
Marlins collected 14 unanswered runs as they came back for their 21st come 
from behind victory of the season. After the first 100 games of the season 
they stood second in the NL East with a record of 52-48. Coming out of 
the All-Star break, the Marlins were swept in three games by the Phillies, 
but they responded by sweeping the Padres in San Diego before taking two 
of three against the Dodgers. That 5-1 West Coast road trip—from July 20–26—reinforced 
to management that the team was in contention. Instead of being sellers 
at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline, first baseman Nick Johnson was 
acquired from the Nationals for pitching prospect Aaron Thompson, in the 
hopes that Johnson would bring his renowned plate discipline to the forefront 
of the Marlins' lineup. However other rumors began to surface that the 
team was exploring options in deals that would bring major players to Florida, 
including superstars Roy Halladay and Adrian Gonzalez, as well as closer 
Heath Bell. In August, the Marlins offense would take off. Rookie Chris 
Coghlan set a club record with ten consecutive multihit games. In addition, 
the Marlins would set a team record with 14 consecutive games with 10 or 
more hits, becoming the first team since the 1937 St. Louis Browns to reach 
that milestone.[15][16] August would also see the Marlins sweeping the 
division leading Philadelphia Phillies after getting swept by the division 
cellar Washington Nationals. In light of being in the playoff race, the 
Marlins were rumored to have been targeting veteran pitchers John Smoltz 
and ex-Marlin Brad Penny.[17][18] The Marlins ended the 2009 Season with 
their 3rd best record in franchise history, 87-75, topped only by the 1997 
(92 wins) and 2003 (91) World Series championship teams. However, the status 
of Fredi González for the 2010 season was put in question when a report 
by ESPN's Buster Olney said the Marlins had made contact with Bobby Valentine. 
The Marlins put those rumors to rest days later confirming that the all-time 
winningest manager in franchise history would remain at the helm. On the 
other hand, pitching coach Mark Wiley and infield/first-base coach Andy 
Fox were not retained. Soon after the World Series, the Marlins began their 
off-season. On November 5, Jeremy Hermida was dealt to the Boston Red Sox 
in exchange for 2 prospects, pitchers Hunter Jones and José Álvarez. The 
team also saw a higher number of awards handed out to the team, as Ramirez 
notched his second straight Silver Slugger award, and Chris Coghlan was 
named the National League Rookie of the Year. Miami native and Marlins' 
Special Assistant to the President Andre Dawson was elected by the eligible 
members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America to the 2010 Class 
of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Dawson played with the Marlins in his final 
two seasons (1995 & 1996)[19] The Marlins were also active on the international 
front, targeting and offering Cuban defector Aroldis Chapman a five-year 
offer worth $16 million, but lost out to the Cincinnati Reds, who signed 
the heralded lefty for $30 million for over six years.[20] The Marlins 
announced in a statement on January 5, 2010, in preparation for the move 
to the new ballpark and name change, that the Marlins road jersey would 
no longer bear the name "Florida" on the front. Also the "F" marlin sleeve 
patch would no longer be on the jersey.[21] On January 12, 2010, as part 
of an agreement between Major League Baseball and the players' union, the 
Marlins agreed to increase payroll in line with the money it receives each 
year from revenue sharing. It could have meant that the Marlins would be 
more inclined to hang on to All-Star second baseman Dan Uggla rather than 
trade him as they had been trying to do for several months.[22] A few days 
after agreeing with MLB to increase payroll, the Marlins signed their ace 
right-hander, Josh Johnson to a four-year deal worth $39 million, the second 
biggest contract ever for a pitcher heading into his second salary arbitration 
year. The only bigger deal was signed by Johan Santana, then of the NY 
Mets, for $40 million over four years. The deal locked up the team's pitching 
ace beyond the opening of the new stadium in 2012, along with Hanley Ramírez.[23] 
Not too long after the deal, the Marlins avoided arbitration with all-star 
second baseman Dan Uggla by signing a one-year, $7.8 million deal which 
was the third-highest single season total in franchise history behind Iván 
Rodríguez's $10 million in 2003 and Gary Sheffield's $14.9 million in 1998.[24] 
Coming out of spring training, there were playoff aspirations for the Marlins, 
which had held the same nucleus since 2006 despite the fact they had the 
National League's third-lowest payroll. Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria expressed 
high hopes saying, "I expect us to make the playoffs, we've got all the 
ammunition we need." However, those aspirations proved to be misplaced, 
as little went right in Miami. In mid-May, Hanley Ramírez was suspended 
for a game by manager Fredi González for not hustling towards a fly ball 
which cost the team runs and a loss. Nearly two weeks later, Roy Halladay 
threw a perfect game against Florida, which was the first one thrown against 
the Marlins in franchise history. On June 23, with the team sitting at 
34-36 along with having a shaky bullpen and inconsistent situational hitting 
and bench, Loria decided to fire Fredi González along with bench coach 
Carlos Tosca and hitting coach Jim Presley on June 23. At the time of his 
dismissal, Gonzalez's record for the season was 32-34. Edwin Rodriguez 
was promoted from Triple-A New Orleans as Florida's new manager. Sandwiched 
between those two announcements were talks with former Rangers and Mets 
manager Bobby Valentine but those talks broke down. Edwin Rodriguez's first 
game was a June 23 win against the Baltimore Orioles. Other disappointments 
came in the way of injuries to core players, Chris Coghlan, the 2009 NL 
Rookie of the Year, tore the meniscus in his left knee while jamming a 
shaving-cream pie in Wes Helms' face. Ricky Nolasco tore the meniscus in 
his right knee when he took off a shoe. When all was said and done, a club-record 
57 players rotated through the clubhouse. At the All-Star Break, Hanley 
Ramírez participated in the State Farm Home Run Derby and became the first 
Marlin to reach the finals. Ramirez lost to David Ortiz but set a Marlins 
record for most home runs hit in the Derby with 26. After the All-Star 
Break, the Marlins went on a surge, getting off to an 11-5 start thanks 
in large part to Dan Uggla, who also set a Marlins franchise record for 
total home runs at 144, passing Mike Lowell. In that same week (July 19-July 
25), the Marlins had four walk-off base hits, two by Donnie Murphy and 
one each from Ronny Paulino and Wes Helms. It was that week which brought 
up the need to be buyers at the trade deadline. Considered in contention 
for the playoffs, the Marlins traded Rick VandenHurk to the Baltimore Orioles 
for lefty Will Ohman to shore up a shaky bullpen. The second half also 
saw the emergence of rookie outfielders Michael Stanton and Logan Morrison, 
who replaced the injured Chris Coghlan. Rookie first baseman Gaby Sánchez 
also put up good numbers, at the top of most lists in home runs, RBIs, 
and batting average, to contend for the NL Rookie of the Year award. The 
Marlins 2010 season was considered a disappointment, as they finished under 
.500 for the first time since 2007. Soon after the World Series, the team 
began its offseason on trying to improve its defense and bullpen while 
filling a dire need at catcher. Out of the gate, the Florida Marlins became 
one of the most active teams on the market. After retaining Edwin Rodríguez 
and bringing back defensive guru Perry Hill, the team traded the disappointing 
results of the notorious Miguel Cabrera–Dontrelle Willis trade. Andrew 
Miller was the first to go when he was traded to the Boston Red Sox on 
November 12 in exchange for another lefty, Dustin Richardson, a relief 
pitcher. The next day, the team shipped out young center fielder Cameron 
Maybin to the San Diego Padres for relief pitchers Ryan Webb and Edward 
Mujica to help in the expected overhaul of the team's disappointing bullpen. 
As soon as the season ended, the team began negotiations for a long-term 
deal that would keep All-Star second baseman Dan Uggla with the team. After 
rejecting the team's offer of $48 million over four years because of his 
desire for a fifth year totaling $71 million,[25] the team reached a stalemate 
with Uggla, meaning his days with the team were numbered. Days later on 
November 16, in order to get some kind of return for Uggla, the team dealt 
him to their divisional rivals, the Atlanta Braves, for fellow All-Star 
and utility man Omar Infante and relief pitcher Mike Dunn. Earlier in that 
same day, the team came to terms on a three-year deal with All-Star catcher 
John Buck, formerly of the Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays. With 
even more money left to spend, the team later signed free agent pitcher 
Javier Vázquez to a one-year, $7 million contract which had a no-trade 
clause. It signaled a change in the philosophy of the franchise who hadn't 
made such a free agent signing since 2005 when they had signed Carlos Delgado 
to a multi-year contract. The team wasn't done yet, as they signed yet 
another of their current players to an extension. Ricky Nolasco agreed 
to a three-year deal that would pay him $26.5 million through 2013, making 
him one of five players on the roster with a multi-year contract (the others 
being Hanley Ramírez, Josh Johnson, John Buck, and Randy Choate). After 
the Marlins began the season with the best start in franchise history through 
50 games (30–20), they had one of the worst runs in MLB history. Starting 
the month of June with a .053 winning percentage (1–18), manager Edwin 
Rodríguez resigned, and the Marlins hired former manager and special assistant 
to the GM Jack McKeon. The Marlins finished the month at a franchise worst 
5–23, but began July at 10–4. The Marlins dropped from the second-best 
record in the National League to last place in the National League East. 
In the final 112 games of the season, the Marlins played 40–72, finishing 
with 72 wins and 90 losses, last in the National League East. For the first 
19 years of its existence, the team played its home games at Sun Life Stadium 
in Miami Gardens. In 2012, it moved into the newly-constructed Marlins 
Park in Miami's Little Havana. In September 2011, the Marlins acquired 
manager Ozzie Guillén in a trade with the Chicago White Sox. The Marlins 
unveiled a new set of uniforms and color schemes on November 11, 2011, 
officially becoming the "Miami Marlins". They signed several high-profile 
free agents during the off-season in Jose Reyes, Heath Bell, and former 
White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle, who played for Ozzie Guillén from 2004 
to 2011. They opened Marlins Park and the 2012 season against the St. Louis 
Cardinals on April 4, losing 4–1. The Marlins struggled through the first 
100 games, only winning 46, despite going a franchise record 21–8 through 
May, resulting in the trades of Omar Infante, Aníbal Sánchez, and Hanley 
Ramírez. The team finished 69–93, its worst record since 1999. This resulted 
in Guillén being fired after one season. Mike Redmond succeeded him as 
the Marlins' manager. There was another fire sale, with the sale of almost 
every other major Marlins player of 2012 but Giancarlo Stanton.[citation 
needed] In 2013, the team started the season with consecutive losses to 
the Washington Nationals, 0-2, 0-3, and 1-6. The Marlins finished 62–100, 
the second 100-loss season for the team, and the first since 1998. However, 
the season ended on a good note, as the Marlins, already out of contention, 
beat the Detroit Tigers as Henderson Álvarez threw the franchise's fifth 
no-hitter in a 1-0 season-ending victory at Marlins Park and José Fernández 
won the NL Rookie of the Year. Prior to the 2014 season, the Marlins acquired 
several hitters in an attempt to supplement their strong pitching and defense, 
including Garrett Jones, Casey McGehee, Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Rafael 
Furcal. The Marlins finished 77–85 in 2014, losing both José Fernández 
and Giancarlo Stanton to major injuries. After the season's conclusion, 
Stanton was signed to the largest contract in MLB history: 13 years and 
$325 million. The Marlins then acquired Aaron Crow from the Kansas City 
Royals, Dee Gordon and Dan Haren from the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Mat 
Latos from the Cincinnati Reds and then signed free agents Michael Morse 
and Ichiro Suzuki, who became the first-ever Japanese-born Marlin in franchise 
history.[26] With the Marlins' talented roster, they entered the 2015 season 
with high expectations. However, after beginning the season 16–22, Redmond 
was fired from the Marlins' managerial position on May 17.[27] Then-general 
manager Dan Jennings replaced Redmond as manager, despite Jennings having 
never previously coached or managed in any MLB organization.[28] Tragedy 
struck the Miami Marlins on September 25, 2016, when star pitcher José
