Edward Joseph Mayo (April 15, 1910 – November 27, 2006), nicknamed "Hotshot" 
and "Steady Eddie", was a professional baseball infielder. He played nine 
seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants (1936), Boston 
Braves (1937–38), Philadelphia Athletics (1943) and Detroit Tigers (1944–48). 
Mayo played in 834 games in the major leagues, initially as a third baseman 
(229 games) and for most of his career as a second baseman (544 games). 
In a nine-season career, the left-handed hitting Mayo posted a .252 batting 
average and .313 on-base percentage with 287 RBIs, 759 hits, 350 runs scored, 
257 walks, 161 extra base hits, and 109 sacrifice hits. He was among the 
league leaders in sacrifice hits six times, including a major league leading 
28 sacrifice hits in 1944. Mayo was also a solid defensive infielder. In 
1943, he led all American League third basemen in fielding percentage at 
.976. Two years later, after switching positions, he led all American league 
second basemen with a .980 fielding percentage at his new position. He 
also led the league's second basemen in 1944 with 125 double plays. His 
best season was 1945 when he helped lead the Detroit Tigers to a World 
Series championship and was selected as the American League's Most Valuable 
Player by The Sporting News. May was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, but 
grew up in Clifton, New Jersey. Born Edward Joseph Mayoski, Mayo was the 
son of Polish immigrants who changed their name to Mayo. Mayo first signed 
with the Detroit Tigers at age 22 in 1932. He played in the minor leagues 
with Johnstown, Knoxville, and Baltimore. In May 1936, he was traded by 
Baltimore (International League) to the New York Giants. Mayo hit .199 
in 46 games as a backup third baseman for the 1936 Giants. He also appeared 
in one game of the 1936 World Series against the Yankees. In December 1936, 
Mayo was traded by the Giants to the Boston Bees. He played in 65 games 
for Boston in the 1937 season, principally as a backup third baseman, batting 
above .227. In May 1938, the Chicago Cubs bought Mayo from Boston, but 
he never appeared in a game for the Cubs. Mayo spent the next five years 
playing for the Los Angeles Angels in the Pacific Coast League. In 1938, 
Los Angeles sportswriters chose him as the Angels' Most Valuable Player 
after he batted .332 and set a PCL record for playing 34 consecutive error-free 
games. On July 13, 1941, Mayo (still playing for the Los Angeles Angels) 
was accused of spitting in the face of umpire Ray Snyder during an argument. 
League President W. C. Tuttle suspended Mayo for one year. Mayo protested 
that he never spat and‚ after a series of hearings with minor-league czar 
Judge Brabham‚ Mayo was reinstated on September 5, 1941, and finished the 
season with the Angels. After leaving Boston in May 1938, Mayo did not 
play in another major league game for five years. In November 1942, with 
the major league player pool depleted by World War II military service, 
Mayo was drafted by the Philadelphia Athletics from the Cubs in the Rule 
5 draft. During spring training prior to the 1943 season, Mayo suffered 
an eye injury when he was hit by a thrown ball. Mayo and catcher Bob Swift 
had a man in a rundown between third base and home. Swift's throw caromed 
off the runner and hit Mayo directly in the left eye, causing a retinal 
hemorrhage. Mayo later said that the injury affected his sight, and he 
even had a blind spot, throughout the 1943 season.[1] Despite the injury, 
Mayo was the Athletics' starting third baseman in 1943, playing 123 games 
at the position. He led the league in fielding percentage, was awarded 
his first Gold Glove award, and led the league with 29 fielding runs. However, 
Mayo felt that the eye injury affected his hitting more than his fielding, 
and his .219 batting average and 28 RBIs were unimpressive. The A's lost 
20 games in a row that year and finished in last place. The A's dropped 
him at the end of the season because of "poor eyesight."[2] After the 1943 
season, Mayo was purchased by the Boston Red Sox, but he was drafted by 
the Detroit Tigers one month later in the rule 5 draft. Perhaps because 
of the 1943 injury to his eye, Mayo developed a peculiar habit of ducking 
after every pitch.[3] In 1944, the Tigers moved Mayo from third base to 
second base. Prior to 1944, Mayo had never played in a single major game 
at second base, but he adjusted well. He had an excellent .978 fielding 
percentage for the Tigers in 1944 and led all American League second basemen 
with 120 double plays. Mayo also substantially improved his offensive performance 
in 1944, raising his average 30 points to .249 with 151 hits, 18 doubles, 
and 63 RBIs. Mayo finished 29th in the 1944 AL MVP voting. Going into the 
1945 season, writers were skeptical about the middle of the Tigers' infield. 
Second baseman Mayo and shortstop Skeeter Webb were both 35 years old, 
and both had been back-up or utility infielders before the depletion of 
talent in World War II. Yet, Mayo went on to be MLB's AL Most Valuable 
Player runner-up (he was selected by The Sporting News for their AL MVP 
award). In post-season voting, Tigers pitcher Hal Newhouser, won the official 
American League Most Valuable Player award with 9 first place votes, and 
Mayo finished second with 7 first place votes.[4][5] Prior to 1944, Mayo 
had never hit for a batting average higher than .227. In 1945, Mayo hit 
for a .285 average and .347 on base percentage—both career highs. He also 
had 24 doubles and a career-high 10 home runs. In addition to a better 
than average offensive year, Mayo led all American League second basemen 
with a .980 fielding percentage. The 35-year-old Mayo showed great range, 
as his range factor of 5.80 was 45 points higher than the league average. 
Mayo's performance also won him an unofficial American League All Star 
team position in 1945, no MLB All-Star Game was held due to the ending 
of the war and seven exhibitions games were played for the war relief fund. 
Mayo helped lead the Tigers to the American League pennant. In fact, the 
man previously known as a good-field and no-hit infielder, had the highest 
batting average among Tigers players with at least 300 at bats. Newhouser 
credited Mayo for sparking the Tigers' 1945 pennant drive, calling him 
the "take-charge guy in our infield." Mayo also contributed to the Tigers 
victory over the Cubs in the 1945 World Series. He started all seven games 
of the Series and had 7 hits, 4 runs, 3 walks, 2 RBIs, and a .323 on-base 
percentage. In the decisive Game 7, Mayo went 2-for-5, scored two runs 
and had a double and 2 RBIs. He hit a fly ball to deep left field in the 
6th inning narrowly missing a home run. Then, in the 8th inning, Mayo hit 
a double down the left-field line that scored Skeeter Webb. After advancing 
to third base, Mayo scored on a line drive to left field off the bat of 
Hank Greenberg.[6] The runs that Mayo drove in and scored in Game 6 proved 
to the last World Series runs by the Detroit Tigers until 1968. In 1946, 
Mayo was limited to 51 games, as Jimmy Bloodworth returned from the war 
and became the Tigers' starting second baseman and George Kell stepped 
in at third base. However, Mayo continued to be a fine fielder. On May 
8, 1946, against the Washington Senators, he caught a line drive off the 
bat of Gil Torres that deflected off Hal Newhouser and turned it into a 
triple play. It was the second one in which he'd been involved in two years, 
and Torres was the batter on both occasions. In 1947, the popular Mayo 
won back his starting job at second base and had a strong year at the bat. 
He hit .279 with 149 hits and career-highs in doubles (28) and triples 
(4). In 1948, Mayo played his final season, hitting for a .249 batting 
average, with 20 doubles and 42 RBIs. In 1949, Mayo became manager of the 
Tigers' Toledo Mud Hens Triple-A farm team. After two years in Toledo, 
he followed Tigers' manager Steve O'Neill, who had become manager of the 
Boston Red Sox. Mayo served as the Sox' third base coach under O'Neill. 
In 1952, O'Neill moved to the Philadelphia Phillies, and Mayo again followed, 
serving as the team's third base coach from 1952 to 1954. Hall of Famer 
Joe Cronin called Mayo the best third base coach in the major leagues. 
After retiring from baseball, Mayo owned several restaurants in northern 
New Jersey. He later retired to Southern California, where he became very 
active as a fundraiser for the Loma Linda Children's Hospital. Mayo died 
in 2006 at age 96 in Banning, California. He was the oldest living Detroit 
Tiger at the time of his death. He was also named the 81st best Tiger in
