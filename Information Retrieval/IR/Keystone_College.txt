Keystone College is a small private liberal arts and sciences college located 
in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Its official mailing address is La Plume, 
Pennsylvania in Lackawanna County; however, much of the campus is in Factoryville, 
Pennsylvania in Wyoming County. The school was founded in 1868. Enrolling 
just under 1,700 students, Keystone offers 40 associate and baccalaureate 
degree programs in business, communications, education, fine arts, natural 
science and mathematics, and social sciences. Keystone College is located 
about 12 miles (18 km) from Scranton, 110 miles (175 km) from New York 
City and 115 miles (185 km) from Philadelphia. Keystone Academy was founded 
in 1868 by Dr. John Howard Harris. The Academy was originally chartered 
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1868, with instruction beginning 
the following year in the local Baptist church in Factoryville. At the 
time it was chartered, Keystone Academy was the only high school between 
Binghamton, New York and Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1934, Keystone Academy 
was rechartered as Scranton-Keystone Junior College. In 1944, the name 
of the College was shortened to Keystone Junior College. The current name 
Keystone College was adopted in 1995. In 1998, the College received formal 
approval from the Pennsylvania Department of Education to offer baccalaureate 
degree programs. In 2014, Keystone received approval to offer master's 
degrees. Keystone College is located on a 270 acre (1.1 km²) tract at the 
gateway to the Endless Mountains of Northeastern Pennsylvania. The campus 
is 15 miles northwest of Scranton, on U.S. Routes 6 and 11 and is spread 
over both Lackawanna and Wyoming counties. Keystone's 170-acre Woodlands 
Campus features approximately seven miles of hiking trails that are open 
seven days a week from dawn until dusk. The Key is the student newspaper, 
which is published during the fall and spring semesters.[1] Keystone's 
22 teams compete in the Colonial States Athletic Conference [2] as a Division 
III school under the NCAA. Teams are known as the Giants, named after the 
baseball team that alumnus Christy Mathewson played for. Coordinates: 41°33′32″N
