New York City Football Club is an American professional soccer club based 
in New York City that competes as a member of the Eastern Conference in 
Major League Soccer (MLS). NYCFC began play in 2015, as an expansion team 
of the league.[3] The club is the first MLS franchise based in the city, 
and the second franchise in the New York metropolitan area after the New 
York Red Bulls, based in Harrison, New Jersey.[4] MLS commissioner Don 
Garber announced the league's intent to award a second team in the New 
York area in 2010, with the new team originally aimed to begin operations 
by 2013.[5] Initially, the league held talks with New York Mets owner Fred 
Wilpon about a second NY club and with owners of the rebooted New York 
Cosmos.[6] The Wilpons' interest in MLS reportedly faded following the 
family's losses in the Madoff investment scandal,[7] while the Cosmos began 
playing in the second-tier North American Soccer League in 2013.[8] Garber 
had previously cultivated an interest in acquiring investment from a major 
European soccer club to be owners of a future franchise, and in December 
2008, he announced a bid for a Miami expansion team led by FC Barcelona 
that was to begin play in 2010,[9] though the bid eventually fell through[10] 
(Garber also briefly discussed Barcelona investing in a New York franchise 
before moving the focus to Miami[11]). But when Ferran Soriano, Barcelona's 
vice president at the time of the Miami bid, was appointed Manchester City 
CEO in August 2012, Garber reached out to him about a New York City team.[11] 
In December 2012, unnamed sources told the media that Manchester City were 
close to being announced as the new owners of the 20th team of MLS, and 
the brand name "New York City Football Club" was trademarked, although 
the club quickly denied the report.[12] However, Garber announced in March 
2013 that he was almost ready to unveil the new expansion team,[13] Manchester 
City and the New York Yankees baseball team paid a $100 million expansion 
fee to join the league.[14][15] New York City Football Club, LLC was registered 
with the New York State Department on May 7, 2013,[16] and on May 21 the 
team was officially announced as the 20th Major League Soccer franchise.[17] 
On May 22, 2013, the club named former United States and Manchester City 
midfielder Claudio Reyna as its director of football operations, responsible 
for coaching staff and player recruitment ahead of the team's inaugural 
MLS season in 2015.[18] Reyna, a New Jersey native, also played for the 
nearby New York Red Bulls. He said he had begun identifying candidates 
to be the club's head coach, but would not name one in 2013.[19] The team 
announced an English-language radio deal with WFAN on October 3, 2013.[20] 
The club made their first recruitment dealing in off-field matters on September 
6, 2013, when they hired former Rutgers University Athletic Director Tim 
Pernetti to serve as Chief Business Officer, part of a five-year deal with 
the university.[21] Further hirings were made in mid-November, when three 
experienced administrators were appointed to Vice President roles.[22] 
On December 11, 2013, Jason Kreis was announced as the first head coach 
of the new franchise, having reached the end of his contract at Real Salt 
Lake and declined an extension.[23] The move came just four days after 
he missed out on lifting his second MLS Cup with the Utah team, losing 
on penalties to Sporting Kansas City. It was revealed in the announcement 
that his contract, starting on January 1, 2014, would see him begin by 
travelling to Manchester in England to familiarize himself with the set-up 
of franchise-owners Manchester City.[23] Kreis' official unveiling was 
made at a press conference on January 10, 2014, where he made it public 
that his former assistant Miles Joseph had joined him at the club.[24] 
On June 2, 2014 the club announced that Spanish World Cup-winning striker 
David Villa had signed as the first player.[25][26] While the team awaited 
its MLS start in 2015, Villa was loaned to another team owned by Manchester 
City, Melbourne City FC of the Australian A-League but was called back 
after only four matches.[27] On July 24, 2014, New York City FC announced 
at a live press conference in Brooklyn that ex-England international and 
Chelsea all-time top goal scorer Frank Lampard would be joining them as 
their second Designated Player. Reyna hailed Lampard as "one of the greatest 
players in world history." Lampard said that "It is a privilege to be able 
to help make history here in New York City."[28][29] On July 6, 2015 the 
club signed Italian international Andrea Pirlo from Juventus as their third 
Designated Player.[30] In the 2015 MLS SuperDraft, as an expansion team, 
New York City had second overall pick, choosing Oregon State forward Khiry 
Shelton as their first pick.[31] An up-and-down pre-season saw them dominate 
their first ever exhibition match, played against Scotland's St Mirren, 
with Villa scoring the club's first ever goal in a regulated match,[32] 
while in the Carolina Challenge Cup, they finished second out of four teams 
after a slow start ruled out their chances of picking up the non-competitive 
silverware. Their first ever league game was played on March 8 against 
fellow expansion side Orlando City, with Mix Diskerud scoring their first 
ever competitive goal in a game which finished 1–1 in front of a packed 
Citrus Bowl stadium.[33] A week later in their first home game, Villa and 
Patrick Mullins scored in their first home win against New England Revolution 
in front of a crowd of 43,507.[34][35] The team eventually suffered an 
eleven-game winless streak which ended on June 16, after defeating the 
Philadelphia Union 2-1.[36] New York faced the New York Cosmos in the fourth 
round of the 2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, and were eliminated on penalties 
after playing overtime.[37] The team finished 8th in the Eastern Conference, 
17th overall. After the season ended, Kreis was relieved from his head 
coaching duties on November 2. The team's failure to make the playoffs 
and the team's second lowest points in the league, were the main factors 
in his release.[38] A week later, Patrick Vieira was announced as the new 
head coach of the team.[39] With the team announced in 2013, almost two 
years before it was due to play its first competitive game in 2015, the 
board of the nascent New York club announced their intention to take their 
time in building the club, and at the team's launch ceremony did not unveil 
colors or a badge, instead only using a placeholder image of a blue circle 
with "New York City FC" written within. As interested parties waited for 
the club to reveal its official colors and badge, a number of graphic designers 
released their own impressions of possible crests and shirt designs,[40] 
something the club encouraged by publicizing several attempts on their 
various social media outlets. Although club chairman Ferran Soriano emphasized 
the desire to create a club with its own identity, rather than relying 
entirely on the brands of club owners Manchester City and the New York 
Yankees, the online presence that the club kept up across its own website 
and on various social networking websites maintained a consistent approach 
of using the sky blue of the Manchester club and the navy blue of the MLB 
team, along with the white employed by both owner-clubs. With the soccer 
side running the operations of NYCFC, however, the vast majority of journalistic 
reporting and speculation assumed that the club's color-scheme would eventually 
be revealed as a reflection of, if not a copy of Manchester City's sky 
blue kits with white trim.[41][42][43][44] with Director of Football Operations 
Claudio Reyna saying at the press conference announcing his appointment 
that he was "...incredibly excited to again wear City’s ‘Sky Blue’ as part 
of the expansion of the MLS...".[18] Having allowed the speculation and 
amateur designs to build interest in the club for almost nine months, on 
February 4, 2014 it was announced that the selection of an official club 
badge was to be forthcoming, with the club planning to release two designs 
for the crest in two different styles, which would then be put to a public 
vote to select the chosen design.[45] In the meantime, New York City FC's 
official website announced a "Badge of Badges" campaign, inviting all to 
create their own crests on a hosted badge-designer page, with every entry 
ultimately to be incorporated into a mosaic of the badge when a final design 
was selected, the mosaic to be available both online and in physical form 
at the club's training ground once built.[46] Although March 3 was originally 
set as the release date for the two proposed logos, the vote was pushed 
back as the Yankees vetoed one of the potential crests for infringing their 
own trademark.[47] The two badge options, both designed by Rafael Esquer 
following the success of his Made in NY mark, were revealed on March 10. 
At that time, the club's official color scheme of navy blue, sky blue and 
orange was also announced. The orange was an homage to the city's Dutch 
heritage, and is the same shade found in the city's flag.[48] Fans were 
given three days to vote on the final design, and the winner was announced 
on March 20.[49] Following closely on the tails of Orlando City SC's jersey 
announcement, New York City FC held their inaugural jersey announcement 
on November 13, 2014,[50] revealing a sky blue shirt taking its inspiration 
from parent club Manchester City.[51] The away jersey was revealed on November 
24, a black shirt with sky blue and orange trim and five reflective black 
stripes to represent the five boroughs of the city.[52] Home, away, and 
third kits. City Football Group sponsor Etihad Airways was announced to 
be NYCFC's inaugural jersey sponsor[53] in an event at Terminal 5 in New 
York City on November 13, 2014, at the same event which revealed the club's 
first ever jersey design. The announcement capped a week in which Heineken[54] 
and Adidas[55] had been signed up as secondary sponsors of the club. In 
one of the club's first announcements on October 3, 2013 - before announcing 
where the team would play and before any players had been signed - New 
York City FC signed an agreement with WFAN to broadcast English-language 
radio commentary to the New York area for NYCFC games.[20] A year later, 
on December 18, 2014, the club announced that it was following up its radio 
deal with an agreement with the YES Network to televise all home and away 
games.[56] On top of the YES broadcasting rights, the deal included free 
streaming of all games across the internet via the Fox Sports Go website.[56] 
With club co-owners the New York Yankees also part-owners of YES, the deals 
were of little surprise, with even Randy Levine openly speculating on the 
possibility within days of the club's unveiling.[57] Before the official 
team was announced, plans were presented by MLS to build a soccer stadium 
in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park[58] in Queens. However, due to opposition 
to building a stadium on park land as well as objections from the New York 
Mets, who play nearby, the site lost favor once the new team was announced. 
The team came up with an alternate proposal to build the stadium in the 
Bronx adjacent to Yankee Stadium to be completed in 2018 at the earliest.[59] 
On April 21, 2014, the club confirmed that they would play their first 
season home games at Yankee Stadium, and that plans for a future stadium 
were in progress.[60] New York City FC's official supporter group, The 
Third Rail, began to form after the club's announcement in May 2013, when 
fans met through social media, and through member drives and viewing parties 
for 2014 FIFA World Cup matches. It had registered 1,600 members before 
the team's first season.[61] Although the group operates independently 
from the club, it was recognized as the official supporter group and has 
received exclusive access to one section in Yankee Stadium. Then-group 
president Chance Michaels said the name reflected the group's desire to 
"power NYCFC" the way the third rail powered the New York City Subway system.[62] 
Before the club began play in March 2015, the club's season-ticket membership 
had already surpassed 14,000,[63] and by April 2015 season-ticket sales 
had reached 16,000.[64] In May 2015, the New York metropolitan area experienced 
a genuine local derby in MLS league play for the first time, when NYCFC 
played their first game against the New York Red Bulls.[65][66][67] Although 
initially regarded as a manufactured rivalry with little of the traditional 
banter apparent between long-time local rivals,[68] the first meetings 
between the two clubs displayed an increasing level of animosity between 
the two sides.[69] The Red Bulls won the first ever encounter between the 
two, a league game on May 10, 2015, at Red Bull Arena.[70] A series of 
brawls between supporters of the two teams occurred before and after matches 
between the two teams.[71] The contest has been dubbed the Hudson River 
Derby by supporters. In 2015, MLS hosted a contest between New York City 
Football Club and New York Red Bulls ahead of the Hudson River Derby on 
June 28. The team with the most votes would have the Empire State Building 
lit up in their favor. New York City Football Club launched the 'WINNYCFC' 
campaign and won the contest.[72][73] In the 2016 MLS season, New York 
City FC started the 'We Are One' campaign on social media, followed by 
the 'Support Your City' campaign during the playoffs later that year. Where 
a player has not declared an international allegiance, nation is determined 
by place of birth. Squad correct as of July 16, 2016.[74] Last updated:

first affiliate, announced on January 16, 2015.[77] One year later, both 
clubs announced an extension to that original agreement.[78] On April 21, 
2016, the club announced that the Long Island Rough Riders would be their 
official Premier Development League partner beginning with the 2016 season.[79] 
NYCFC began building its youth development program in April 2014 by partnering 
with eight local youth soccer clubs.[80] In February 2015, the club announced 
the formal creation of an academy, beginning with a single team at U-13
