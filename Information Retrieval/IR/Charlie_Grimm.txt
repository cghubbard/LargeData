As player As manager Charles John Grimm (August 28, 1898 – November 15, 
1983), nicknamed "Jolly Cholly", was an American professional baseball 
player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman, 
most notably for the Chicago Cubs; he was also a sometime radio sports 
commentator, and a popular goodwill ambassador for baseball. He played 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates early in his career, but was traded to the Cubs 
in 1925 and worked mostly for the Cubs for the rest of his career. Born 
in St. Louis, Missouri, Grimm was known for being outgoing and chatty, 
even singing old-fashioned songs while accompanying himself on the banjo. 
As a manager for the Cubs, he led the team to National League championships 
in 1932, 1935 and 1945. He also served as the Cubs' Director of Player 
Personnel, then the club's title for general manager, from his resignation 
as field manager in mid-1949 through early 1950. However, Grimm was not 
comfortable in his front-office post and resigned in February 1950 to manage 
a Double A team, the Dallas Eagles of the Texas League. Grimm was also 
a major baseball figure in Milwaukee. He was hired by Bill Veeck to manage 
his Milwaukee Brewers, then the Cubs' top farm team, during World War II. 
He returned to the Brewers in 1951 when they were a farm team of the Boston 
Braves. He was highly successful as a manager during each term, winning 
the regular season American Association title in 1943 and 1951, and the 
playoff championship in 1951. On May 30, 1952, Grimm was promoted from 
Milwaukee to manager of the big league Braves; he would prove to be the 
last skipper in the history of the Boston NL club. He then managed the 
Milwaukee Braves for their first three years after their move to Wisconsin 
in March 1953. Being of German extraction, he was popular in the Beer City, 
but left the Braves the year before they went to – and won – the World 
Series in 1957. He was brought out of retirement to direct the Cubs again 
in early 1960, but the team got off to a slow start, and owner P.K. Wrigley 
made the novel move of swapping Grimm with another former manager, Lou 
Boudreau, who was doing Cubs radiocasts at that time. Grimm had done play-by-play 
in the past, so he gave it one more go in 1960, before stepping back to 
the ranks of coaching and then front office duties. It was in 1961 that 
Wrigley began his "College of Coaches", of which Grimm was a part but was 
never designated "Head Coach". One of the Cubs' coaches during that 5-year 
experiment was baseball's first black coach, Buck O'Neil. Grimm finished 
with a record of 1,287 wins and 1,067 losses in the regular season and 
five wins and 12 losses in the post-season.[1] After his retirement from 
baseball, he lived adjacent to Lake Koshkonong, near Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. 
Grimm died in Scottsdale, Arizona at age 85, from cancer. His widow was
