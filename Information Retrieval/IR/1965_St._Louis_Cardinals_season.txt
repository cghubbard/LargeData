The 1965 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 84th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 74th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
80–81 during the season and finished seventh in the National League, 16½ 
games behind the eventual World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. It 
was also the last full season for the original Busch Stadium. The mid-1960s 
saw changes both on the field and off – all while retaining the core of 
a remarkable successful franchise and its renewed popularity in St. Louis. 
Schoendienst's replacement of Keane had been preceded a few weeks earlier 
by general manager Bing Devine's firing, the redemption of the final pennant 
drive having come too late to assuage owner August Busch's dwindling patience. 
Devine was replaced by Bob Howsam, who made a number of moves to shore 
up a talented but aging team which struggled through the 1965 campaign, 
finishing mired in 7th place at 80–81. A capable GM if not Devine's equal, 
Howsam made some moves that worked – and some that did not. Howsam traded 
aging veterans Bill White, Dick Groat, and utility catcher Bob Uecker to 
Philadelphia in return for Pat Corrales, Art Mahaffey, and Alex Johnson. 
Popular third baseman Ken Boyer was dispatched to the Mets in exchange 
for pitcher Al Jackson. Finally, pitcher Ray Sadecki was traded to the 
Giants for first baseman Orlando Cepeda in 1966. The latter moves worked 
better than the former, but the Cardinals still finished in 6th place in 
1966, resulting in Howsam's replacement by none other than Cardinals legend 
Stan Musial. Musial's most notable move was to acquire Yankees' star Roger 
Maris. Pitcher Bob Gibson, first baseman Bill White, and outfielder Curt 
Flood won Gold Gloves this year. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
