Randall Leo Jones (born January 12, 1950), nicknamed "Junkman", is an American 
former professional baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched in Major League 
Baseball for the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. Jones won the Cy Young 
Award in 1976. He attended Brea-Olinda High School in Brea, California.[citation 
needed] He attended Chapman University in Orange, California.[1] He was 
known for his sinker and the large number of ground-ball outs he induced. 
Jones was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the fifth round of the 1972 
Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on June 16, 
1973. In 1974, Jones went 8-22 with a 4.45 ERA. He was able to turn it 
around in 1975 when he won 20 games and led the National League with a 
2.24 ERA earning The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award honors. 
His best season was in 1976, when he went 22-14 with a 2.74 ERA, winning 
the National League Cy Young Award and being named The Sporting News NL 
Pitcher of the Year. He was selected as the left-handed pitcher on The 
Sporting News NL All-Star Teams after the 1975 and 1976 seasons. Jones 
established the Major League season record for most chances accepted by 
a pitcher without an error (112 in 1976), tied ML pitchers records for 
highest season fielding percentage (1.000, 1976) and most assists in an 
inning (3, 9/28/75 – 3rd inning), and tied the NL pitchers season record 
for the most double plays with 12 in 1976.[2] Jones owns the distinction 
of recording a save for the NL in the 1975 All Star game and being the 
starting and winning pitcher the next year. He entered the 1976 All-Star 
Game with a record of 16-3, an All Star break win total that no one has 
equaled since.[3] During his last start of the 1976 season, he injured 
a nerve in his pitching arm that required exploratory surgery, and he was 
never quite able to regain his Cy Young form. Jones pitched effectively 
for San Diego through the 1980 season. On December 15, 1980, he was traded 
to the New York Mets for José Moreno and John Pacella. After the 1982 season, 
Jones was released by the Mets[4] and signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
He was released by the Pirates before the 1983 season started, thus ending 
his playing career. His career win-loss record was just 100-123; he remains 
the only starting pitcher to win a Cy Young Award but retire with a losing 
record. He was named an All-Star in 1975 and 1976. After his retirement, 
Jones' uniform No. 35 was retired by the Padres on May 9, 1997.[5] After 
retiring from Major League Baseball, Jones has coached young pitchers. 
His most prominent pupil was Barry Zito,[6] a former Major League pitcher 
and the 2002 Cy Young Award winner while with the Oakland Athletics. He 
also is the owner of Randy Jones All American Grill, Randy Jones Big Stone 
Lodge, the home of his catering business Randy Jones Buckboard Catering. 
The Big Stone Lodge sells a barbecue sauce that bears Jones' name.[7] Jones 
also is involved in the San Diego Padres local radio broadcast pregame 
and postgame show. In 1996, Jones was inducted by the San Diego Hall of 
Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes 
both on and off the playing surface.[1] He was inducted as part of the 
inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.[8] Jones
