a former Major League Baseball first baseman and corner outfielder, who 
played for the Atlanta Braves, San Diego Padres, and the San Francisco 
Giants. He attended Westminster High School in Westminster, California. 
Klesko hit at least 21 home runs in eight of his 13 major league seasons, 
with a high of 34 homers in 1996. His most productive season came in 2001, 
when he hit .286 with 30 home runs and posted career-highs in RBI (113), 
runs (105), stolen bases (23) and slugging percentage (.539), and made 
the National League All-Star team. In 2002, he hit .300 with 29 HR and 
95 RBI, and collected career-highs in hits (162) and doubles (39). Defensively 
he has shuttled around the outfield and first base. In his career he has 
a .370 on-base percentage with a .500 slugging average, for a .870 OPS. 
His .525 slugging percentage as a Brave ranks 4th all-time among the team's 
career leaders, ahead of Eddie Mathews. His .886 OPS as a Brave ranks him 
5th among Braves' all-time leaders.[1] Klesko became the first player to 
hit a home run in three consecutive World Series road games when he did 
so against the Cleveland Indians in Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World

surgery. He returned on September 21, drawing a walk as a pinch-hitter 
in his first plate appearance. On December 19, 2006, Klesko signed a one-year 
contract with the San Francisco Giants. Klesko announced his retirement
