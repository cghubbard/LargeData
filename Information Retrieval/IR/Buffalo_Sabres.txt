                    The Buffalo Sabres are a professional ice hockey team 
based in Buffalo, New York. They are members of the Atlantic Division of 
the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was 
established in 1970, along with the Vancouver Canucks, when the league 
expanded to 14 teams. They have played at KeyBank Center since 1996. Prior 
to that, the Buffalo Sabres played at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium from 
the start of the franchise in 1970. The Sabres are owned by Terry Pegula 
and coached by Dan Bylsma. The team has twice advanced to the Stanley Cup 
Finals, losing to the Philadelphia Flyers in 1975 and to the Dallas Stars 
in 1999. The best known line in team history is The French Connection, 
which consisted of Gilbert Perreault, Rick Martin and Rene Robert. All 
three players have had their sweater numbers (11, 7 and 14, respectively) 
retired and a statue erected in their honor at KeyBank Center in 2012. 
Tim Horton (2), Pat LaFontaine (16), Danny Gare (18) and Dominik Hasek 
(39) have also had their jersey numbers retired. The Sabres, along with 
the Vancouver Canucks, joined the NHL in the 1970–71 season. Their first 
owners were Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, scions of a family long 
prominent in Western New York and grandsons of the co-founders of the Woolworth's 
variety store chain; along with Robert O. Swados, a Buffalo attorney. On 
the team's inaugural board of directors were Robert E. Rich, Jr., later 
the owner of the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team; and George 
W. Strawbridge, Jr., an heir to the Campbell Soup Company fortune. Buffalo 
had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' 
establishment, the Buffalo Bisons were a pillar of the American Hockey 
League (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another Bisons 
hockey team played from 1928 to 1936), winning the Calder Cup in their 
final season.[1] Wanting a name other than "bison" (a generic stock name 
used by Buffalo sports teams for decades), the Knoxes commissioned a name-the-team 
contest. The winning choice, "Sabres," was chosen because Seymour Knox 
felt a sabre, a weapon carried by a leader, could be effective on offense 
and defense.[A][B] The Knoxes tried twice before to get an NHL team, first 
when the NHL expanded in 1967, and again when they attempted to buy the 
Oakland Seals with the intent of moving them to Buffalo. At the time of 
their creation, the Sabres exercised their option to create their own AHL 
farm team, the Cincinnati Swords. Former Toronto Maple Leafs general manager 
and head coach Punch Imlach was hired in the same capacity with the Sabres. 
The year the Sabres debuted (1970) was an important year for major league 
sports in Buffalo. In addition to the Sabres' debut, the Buffalo Bills 
officially joined the National Football League (NFL), and the National 
Basketball Association's Buffalo Braves (NBA) also began to play, sharing 
Memorial Auditorium with the Sabres. The city of Buffalo went from having 
no teams in the established major professional sports leagues to three 
in one off-season, a situation that proved to be unsustainable. Between 
the Braves and the Sabres, the Sabres would prove to be, by far, the more 
successful of the two, and Braves owner Paul Snyder sold the team in 1976. 
The Braves left Buffalo in 1978, and its remains are now the Los Angeles 
Clippers. The consensus was that first pick in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft 
would be junior phenomenon Gilbert Perreault. Either the Sabres or the 
Canucks would get the first pick, to be determined with the spin of a roulette 
wheel. Perreault was available to the Sabres and Canucks as this was the 
first year that the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to 
draft Quebec-born junior players. The Canucks were allocated numbers 1–10 
on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11–20. When league president Clarence 
Campbell spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on 1. 
While Campbell was congratulating the Vancouver delegation, Imlach asked 
Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11—effectively 
handing Perreault to the Sabres.[3] Perreault scored 38 goals in his rookie 
season of 1970–71, at the time a record for most goals scored by a NHL 
rookie, and he received the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's rookie 
of the year. Despite Perreault's play, the Sabres finished well out of 
playoff contention. In the team's second season, 1971–72, rookie Rick Martin, 
drafted fifth overall by Buffalo in 1971, and Rene Robert, acquired in 
a late-season trade from the Pittsburgh Penguins, joined Perreault and 
would become one of the league's top forward lines in the 1970s. Martin 
broke Perreault's record at once with 44 rookie goals. They were nicknamed 
"The French Connection" after the movie of the same name and in homage 
to their French-Canadian roots. The Sabres made the playoffs for the first 
time in 1972–73, just the team's third year in the league, but lost in 
the quarterfinals in six games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal 
Canadiens. After a subpar year in 1974 that saw them miss the playoffs 
(as well as aging defenseman Tim Horton's death in a DUI-induced car accident), 
the Sabres tied for the best record in the NHL in the 1974–75 regular season. 
Buffalo advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in team history 
to play against the rough Philadelphia Flyers (who had been recently nicknamed 
the "Broad Street Bullies"), a series which included the legendary Fog 
Game (Game 3 of the series). Due to unusual heat in Buffalo in May 1975 
and the lack of air conditioning in the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, parts 
of the game were played in heavy fog that made players, officials, and 
the puck invisible to many spectators. During a face-off and through the 
fog, Sabres center Jim Lorentz spotted a bat flying across the rink, swung 
at it with his stick, killing it. It was the only time that any player 
killed an animal during an NHL game. The Sabres won that game thanks to 
Rene Robert's goal in overtime. However, Philadelphia would wind up taking 
the Cup in six games, winning the series 4–2. The French Connection, joined 
by 50–goal scorer Danny Gare, continued to score prolifically for the Sabres 
in 1975–76, but the team lost in the quarterfinals to the New York Islanders. 
The Sabres had success through the late 1970s behind Gare and the French 
Connection (Perreault, Martin and Robert), but they were unable to return 
to the Finals despite a Wales Conference championship in 1980 and being 
the first team to beat the Soviet Olympic Team when they toured the United 
States. The French Connection era ended with Robert's trade to the Colorado 
Rockies in 1979 and Martin's trade to the Los Angeles Kings in 1981, by 
which time Martin's career was essentially finished as the result of a 
devastating knee injury in 1980. In 1981–82, the NHL realigned its conferences 
and adopted an intra-divisional playoff format for the first two rounds. 
It was the beginning of an era in which the Sabres would finish in the 
middle of the Adams Division standings with regularity, and then face the 
near-certainty of having to get past either the Boston Bruins or Canadiens 
to make it to the conference finals. Aside from first-round victories over 
Montreal in 1982–83 and Boston in 1992–93, the era saw the Sabres lose 
to division rivals Boston, the Quebec Nordiques and Montreal in the Adams 
Division semi-finals (first round) a combined eight times, and miss the 
playoffs altogether in 1985–86 and 1986–87—only third and fourth times 
out of the playoffs in franchise history. Perrault reached the 500-goal 
mark in the 1985–86 season and retired after playing 20 games in 1986–87, 
17 years after joining the Sabres as their first draft pick. The Sabres 
drafted Pierre Turgeon with the first pick in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, 
and he quickly made an impact with the team. During his rookie season in 
1987–88, he helped the Sabres reach the playoffs for the first time in 
three years. He was joined in 1989 by Alexander Mogilny, who – with the 
help of Sabres officials – became the first Soviet player to defect to 
the NHL, and cleared the way for all other Russian players to follow. In 
the 1989–90 season, the Sabres would improve to finish with 98 points – 
third-best in the league – but the playoff futility continued with a first-round 
loss to Montreal. The Sabres traded Turgeon to the New York Islanders in 
1991 as part of a blockbuster seven-player trade that brought Pat LaFontaine 
to Buffalo. In 1992–93, Dominik Hasek joined the team in a trade from the 
Chicago Blackhawks. In the 1993 playoffs, the Sabres upset the Bruins in 
a four-game sweep in the Adams Division semi-finals, their first playoff 
series victory in 10 years. Brad May's series-winning goal in overtime 
of Game 4 in Buffalo was made famous by Rick Jeanneret's "May Day!" call. 
However, the eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens swept the 
Sabres in the division final, with the Sabres losing all four games by 
a 4–3 score (the last three games in overtime). With the NHL adopting a 
conference playoff format for the 1993–94 season, the Sabres faced the 
New Jersey Devils in the Eastern Conference playoffs' first round. Despite 
Hasek winning a 1–0 (4 OT) goaltending duel with the Devils' Martin Brodeur 
in Game 6 – the Sabres' longest game ever, which went into quadruple overtime 
– Buffalo would lose the series in seven games. Another first-round playoff 
loss to the Philadelphia Flyers in the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season 
was followed by a fifth-place finish in the Northeast Division in 1995–96, 
as the team missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years. It was 
the first season under coach Ted Nolan and the last for the Sabres at Buffalo 
Memorial Auditorium. Nolan brought an exciting brand of hockey to Buffalo. 
During his coaching tenure, Buffalo was referred to as the "hardest-working 
team in hockey."[4] This season also featured the debut of "walk-on" veteran 
Randy Burridge, who earned a spot on the roster after he attended training 
camp on a try-out basis. He scored 25 goals that season and was second 
in team scoring to Pat LaFontaine. Burridge also earned the Tim Horton 
Award for being the unsung hero and was voted team Most Valuable Player. 
The final game in Memorial Auditorium was played on April 14, 1996, a 4–1 
victory over the Hartford Whalers. Sabres principal owner Seymour Knox 
died a month later, on May 22, 1996. Ted Nolan and the Sabres rebounded 
in 1996–97, their first at Marine Midland Arena, by winning their first 
division title in 16 years, with Nolan winning the Jack Adams Award as 
the NHL's top coach, Dominik Hasek winning both the Hart and Vezina Trophies 
(the first goaltender to do so since Montreal's Jacques Plante in 1962), 
Michael Peca taking home the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the best defensive 
forward in the NHL and general manager John Muckler honored as Executive 
of the Year. However, the regular season success was overshadowed by what 
had taken place during the playoffs. Tensions between Nolan and Hasek had 
been high for most of the season; after being scored upon in Game 3 of 
the first round against the Ottawa Senators, Hasek left the game, forcing 
backup Steve Shields to step in. Hasek claimed he felt his knee pop, and 
the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. Buffalo News columnist Jim Kelley 
wrote a column that night for the next day's newspaper that detailed the 
day's events, which irked Hasek. After the Senators won Game 5, Hasek came 
out of the Sabres' training room and attacked Kelley, tearing his shirt. 
Despite the fact Hasek issued an apology, things went downhill afterwards. 
Shields starred as the Sabres rallied to win the series against Ottawa. 
But before the next series against the Philadelphia Flyers, the NHL announced 
Hasek had been suspended for three games – with the Sabres informing the 
league Hasek was healthy (Hasek most likely would not have been suspended 
had he not been cleared to play). Set to return in Game 4 with the Sabres 
down by three games to none, Hasek told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt 
a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pre-game skate. Shields 
turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off elimination 
with a win in overtime. Again before Game 5, Hasek declared himself unfit 
to play and Buffalo lost 6–3 and the series. Team President Larry Quinn 
fired General Manager John Muckler, who had a noted feud with Nolan. Hasek, 
who supported Muckler, openly told reporters at the NHL Awards Ceremony 
he did not respect Nolan, placing new GM Darcy Regier in a tough position. 
He offered Nolan just a one-year contract for a reported $500,000. Nolan 
refused on the grounds his previous contract was for two years. Regier 
then pulled the contract off the table and did not offer another one, ending 
Nolan's tenure as Sabres coach. Nolan was offered several jobs from the 
Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Islanders, which he turned down, and was 
out of the NHL until June 2006 when he was named coach of the Islanders. 
Former Sabres captain Lindy Ruff was hired as head coach on July 21, 1997, 
agreeing to a three-year deal. The Sabres organization, after having their 
most successful season in nearly two decades, had fired both the reigning 
NHL Executive of the Year (Muckler) and Coach of the Year (Nolan). During 
the 1997–98 season, the Sabres, which had lost $32 million over the previous 
three seasons and nearly missed payroll in December 1997,[5] were sold 
by Northrop Knox to John Rigas, owner of Adelphia Communications. Shortly 
thereafter, Quinn was dismissed and replaced by John Rigas's son, Timothy 
Rigas. Behind Hasek, left-winger Miroslav Satan (who led the team in scoring), 
right-winger Donald Audette, center Michael Peca and several role-playing 
journeymen including Matthew Barnaby, the Sabres reached the Eastern Conference 
Finals that season, but lost to the Washington Capitals in six games. In 
1998–99, Miroslav Satan scored 40 goals. The Sabres would add centers Stu 
Barnes from the Pittsburgh Penguins and Joe Juneau from the Capitals. Michal 
Grosek had the best season of his career, and the team finally returned 
to the Stanley Cup Finals, this time against the Presidents' Trophy winner, 
the Dallas Stars. In Game 6, Stars winger Brett Hull's triple-overtime 
goal ended the series, and the Stars were awarded the Cup. In 1999, it 
was illegal to score a goal if an offensive player's skate entered the 
crease before the puck did. NHL officials, however, maintained that Hull's 
two shots in the goal mouth constituted a single possession of the puck 
since the puck deflected off Hasek. The rule was changed for the following 
season, allowing players to be inside the goaltender's crease as long as 
they do not interfere with the goalie. The next year was a disappointing 
season. The team struggled in the regular season, due to injuries to Hasek 
as well as other tired and discouraged players. Doug Gilmour was acquired 
from the Chicago Blackhawks at the trade deadline and sparked the Sabres 
to a playoff berth. However, Gilmour was stricken by stomach flu during 
the post-season, and even the Hasek's return could not prevent a first-round 
playoff series loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Like the previous season, 
there would be an officiating controversy. In Game 2, Flyers left wing 
John LeClair put the puck in the net through a hole in the mesh. While 
replays appeared to show the puck entering through the "side" of the net, 
the goal was allowed to stand. The Flyers would win the game 2–1 and go 
on to win the series 4–1. Captain Michael Peca sat out 2000–01 due to a 
contract dispute, and was later traded to the New York Islanders in June 
2001 for Tim Connolly and Taylor Pyatt. Even so, the Sabres still defeated 
Philadelphia in six games in the first round of the playoffs (with a resounding 
8–0 victory in the series-winning game). In the second round, they faced 
the underdog Pittsburgh Penguins, led by rejuvenated superstar Mario Lemieux 
and captain Jaromir Jagr, who had won his fifth Art Ross Trophy that season, 
losing on a seventh-game overtime goal scored by defenseman Darius Kasparaitis. 
After lengthy and failed negotiations with their star goaltender, the Sabres 
traded Hasek to the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of 2001, bringing a 
five-year era of playoff success to a close. Without Hasek and Peca, the 
Sabres missed the 2002 playoffs. The first third jersey of the Buffalo 
Sabres was created in 2000. The primary color was Sabre red, with black 
and gray stripes on the sleeves. It also featured the word "Buffalo" written 
on a black stripe outlined by gray near the waist. The logo was a black 
circle with two sabres crossing each other. The third jersey ran from 2000–2006 
when the red jersey was retired. In May 2002, John Rigas and his sons were 
indicted for bank, wire and securities fraud for embezzling more than $2 
billion from Adelphia. Rigas was later convicted and presently is appealing 
a sentence of 15 years in prison. The league took control of the team, 
though the Rigas family remained owners on paper. For a while, there were 
no interested buyers. After the two-year period of uncertainty, the team 
was sold to a consortium led by Rochester, New York, billionaire and former 
New York gubernatorial candidate Tom Golisano and former Sabres president 
Larry Quinn, whose bid included no government funding. Golisano was introduced 
as team owner on March 19, 2003. With the 2002–03 season having started 
under league control, General Manager Darcy Regier could make only minimal 
moves. However, with the consultations of impending new ownership, the 
team began their rebuilding process around the March 2003 trade deadline 
by clearing out veteran players. The first to go was winger Rob Ray, who 
was sent to the Ottawa Senators. The team then sent center and team captain 
Stu Barnes to the Dallas Stars for young winger Michael Ryan and a draft 
pick. A third deal sent center Chris Gratton to the Phoenix Coyotes with 
a draft pick for Danny Briere and a draft pick, adding a player who would 
play a key role in the Sabres' resurgence in later years. The 2003–04 season 
saw the team emerge from its financial struggles and, though the Sabres 
narrowly missed the playoffs, the development of prominent young players. 
Although the 2004–05 NHL season was canceled due to a labor dispute, the 
league and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) were 
able to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement in the summer of 
2005, thus enabling NHL hockey to return for the 2005–06 season. On January 
19, 2005, the Sabres lost their main cable television broadcaster, as the 
Empire Sports Network (which had been on the air since 1991) ceased operations 
in a cost-cutting move during the Adelphia scandal and reorganization. 
(Like the Sabres, Empire had been owned by Adelphia prior to the NHL's 
seizure of the franchise.) Adelphia sold their rights to Sabres telecasts 
and for the 2005–06 campaign Madison Square Garden Network (MSG), a New 
York City-based channel which broadcasts New York Rangers, New York Islanders 
and New Jersey Devils games, took over the rights to broadcast Sabres games 
to television viewers in western New York, with the Sabres controlling 
all aspects of the broadcast. The agreement has since been extended through 
2016. In 2005–06 the Sabres took off, finishing with their best record 
in over twenty years and clinching their first playoff berth since the 
2000–01 season. The team finished the regular season with 52 wins, surpassing 
the 50–win mark for the first time in franchise history. They also finished 
with 110 points, their first 100-point season in 23 years and tied the 
1979–80 club for the second-best point total in franchise history. The 
Sabres tied the Ottawa Senators and Carolina Hurricanes for the most wins 
in the Eastern Conference. They finished with the fifth-best record in 
the league, behind Detroit, Ottawa, Dallas and Carolina. Buffalo defeated 
the Philadelphia Flyers in the first-round of the 2006 playoffs in six 
games and top-seeded Ottawa in five games. The Sabres advanced to play 
Carolina in their first Eastern Conference Final since 1999. However injuries 
began to mount. They were forced to play without four of their top defensemen 
(Teppo Numminen, Dmitri Kalinin, Jay McKee and Henrik Tallinder), and their 
top powerplay scorer, Tim Connolly for much of the series. Despite this 
the Sabres forced the series to seven games before falling to the eventual 
Stanley Cup Champion Carolina Hurricanes. The Sabres impressive season 
was recognized on June 22, 2006, at the NHL Awards Ceremony, when Lindy 
Ruff edged Hurricanes coach Peter Laviolette to win the Jack Adams Award 
as Coach of the Year in the closest vote in the award's history. Ruff was 
the second Sabres coach to win the award. On September 16, 2006, the Sabres 
unveiled new home and away jerseys featuring midnight blue, maize (gold), 
silver and white colors. The new logo, a stylized bison, was widely reviled, 
drawing unfavorable comparisons to a banana slug.[6] Despite the criticism, 
five of the top 10 player jerseys sold in the first two months of the 2006–07 
season were Sabres "slug" designs.[7][8] The Sabres started the 2006–07 
season 10–0, setting a new franchise record for consecutive wins to start 
a season, and becoming just the second team in NHL history (after the 1994 
Toronto Maple Leafs) to open a season with a ten-game winning streak. They 
also set a new league record for consecutive road wins to start a season 
(eight), which was extended to ten games (tying the team record for consecutive 
road wins) with a 7–4 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on November 13, 
2006. The team reached the 50-win plateau for the second time in franchise 
history. The Sabres won the Presidents' Trophy for the first time in franchise 
history, giving them the home ice advantage for their entire run in the 
2007 Stanley Cup playoffs. They also tied the 1974–75 team's franchise 
record for points in a season. The team defeated the New York Islanders 
and the New York Rangers to reach their second consecutive Eastern Conference 
Finals. On May 19, however, they were eliminated by the Ottawa Senators 
after five games. In the April 9, 2007, issue of ESPN the Magazine, the 
team ranked first of 122 major professional sports franchises in North 
America. The Sabres were cited for their player accessibility, low ticket 
prices and exciting brand of hockey.[9] The Sabres lost both co-captains, 
Daniel Briere (who went to the Philadelphia Flyers) and Chris Drury (who 
went to the New York Rangers) during the free agency period. The Sabres 
nearly lost Thomas Vanek to the Edmonton Oilers, who offered him a seven-year, 
$50 million offer sheet, but the Sabres matched the offer on July 6. After 
these events, the team changed its policy of not negotiating contracts 
during the regular season. Long-time Sabres broadcast color commentator 
Jim Lorentz announced his retirement during the preseason. Hockey Night 
in Canada's Harry Neale took over the position in October 2007. During 
the 2007–08 season, the Sabres hosted a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins 
on January 1, 2008, which was played outdoors at Ralph Wilson Stadium, 
home of the National Football League's Buffalo Bills.[10] Officially, the 
game was called the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic, known colloquially as 
the "Ice Bowl" due to it taking place at the same time as college football 
bowl games. The Sabres lost 2–1 in a shootout. The Sabres failed to qualify 
for the playoffs and became only the third team in NHL history to go from 
finishing first overall in the regular season standings to finishing out 
of the playoffs the following year. On June 10, the Sabres officially announced 
their new American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, beginning in the 2008–09 
season, would be the Portland Pirates from Portland, Maine. This ended 
their 29-year affiliation with the Rochester Americans. They signed with 
the Pirates for two seasons, with a parent club option for a third.[11] 
The Sabres entered the 2008 free agency period quietly, but on July 1 signed 
goaltender Patrick Lalime to a two-year contract. Three days later, the 
Sabres acquired Craig Rivet from the San Jose Sharks in exchange for a 
second round draft pick in each of the next two drafts. The Sabres also 
extended the contracts of three players: Paul Gaustad (four-year extension), 
Ryan Miller (five-year extension), and Jason Pominville (five-year extension). 
Miller was slated to become an unrestricted free agent following the upcoming 
season while Pominville was set to become a restricted free agent. On October 
8, the Sabres named defenseman Craig Rivet team captain, the first single 
full-time captain since Stu Barnes's term from 2001–2003. The team was 
also active at the trade deadline. First, they signed Tim Connolly to a 
two-year extension worth $4.2 million. They also acquired Mikael Tellqvist 
from the Phoenix Coyotes for a fourth round pick in the 2010 draft. Then 
Dominic Moore came from the Toronto Maple Leafs for a second-round pick 
in the 2009 draft. Finally, they received a second-round pick in the 2009 
draft from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Ales Kotalik. On April 9, 
the Buffalo Sabres were eliminated from the playoffs. General Manager Darcy 
Regier announced on the first day of free agency for the following season 
the Sabres had signed unrestricted free agent defenseman Steve Montador 
to a two-year contract. They also signed free agent defenseman Joe DiPenta 
to a one-year contract on July 11. They also extended contracts with three 
other players: Andrej Sekera to a multi-year deal, Clarke MacArthur to 
a one-year contract, and Mike Grier to a one-year contract. Grier, having 
played two seasons with the Sabres, returned after playing the last three 
with the San Jose Sharks. At the beginning of the season, the Sabres announced 
the Buffalo Sabres Road Crew, which saw appearances by the Sabres' coaching 
staff, GM Darcy Regier and broadcasting crew for charity. Four stops were 
scheduled throughout the season in Tampa, Florida, Washington, D.C., Raleigh, 
North Carolina, and Atlanta at established Buffalo fan clubs. Many native 
Western New Yorkers live in those four cities; Sabres fans have been known 
to have large contingents in attendance, rivaling those of the home teams 
when playing in Raleigh and Tampa.[12] After only playing two games with 
Buffalo that season, Daniel Paille was traded to the Boston Bruins on October 
20, 2009, for a third round and a conditional fourth round draft selection. 
Paille's move to Boston marked the first ever trade of a player under contract 
between the two division rivals in their common 39 years in the NHL.[13] 
On January 1, the Sabres became the first team to win consecutive games 
when trailing by three or more goals since the Dallas Stars did it in 2005–06. 
Buffalo beat the Atlanta Thrashers 4–3 in overtime. It was Buffalo's second 
straight win in a game it trailed 3–0, following a 4–3 victory over the 
Pittsburgh Penguins.[14] On March 3, the day of the trade deadline, the 
Sabres made two deals. The first was with the Columbus Blue Jackets, which 
sent them Nathan Paetsch and a second round draft pick in exchange for 
Raffi Torres. The Sabres' second and final deal sent Clarke MacArthur to 
the Atlanta Thrashers for third and fourth round draft picks. On March 
27, the Sabres clinched their first playoff berth since 2006–07 with a 
7–1 rout of the Tampa Bay Lightning. On April 6, the Sabres clinched the 
Northeast Division title by defeating the New York Rangers by a score of 
5–2. On April 26, the third-seed Sabres were eliminated from the Stanley 
Cup playoffs by the sixth-seeded Boston Bruins in six games. The Sabres 
unveiled new jerseys on September 18, 2010 that readopted the classic 1970–1996 
logo, with a third jersey having an alternate throwback arrangement that 
pays homage to the AHL's Buffalo Bisons, complete with the team's 40th 
Anniversary insignia (essentially the original royal blue version of the 
current logo with the year "1970" inside).[15][16] The roster did not have 
many significant changes; one of the most notable was the team's decision 
to waive center Tim Kennedy, a Buffalo native, to avoid paying the award 
he won in arbitration. Defensemen Henrik Tallinder and Toni Lydman were 
allowed to leave as free agents, while the team signed veterans Jordan 
Leopold and Shaone Morrisonn to replace them. Additionally, center Rob 
Niedermayer was added as a Stanley Cup-winning, veteran presence. On November 
30, Ken Campbell of The Hockey News reported a story that billionaire Terry 
Pegula had signed a letter of intent to purchase the Sabres for US$150 
million. Pegula was the founder, President and CEO of East Resources, one 
of the largest privately held companies in the United States before he 
sold the company.[17] After the report was released, Sabres managing partner 
Larry Quinn claimed it was "untrue" but refused further comment.[18] The 
$150 million was later determined to be an undervalued amount, as Forbes 
magazine had valued the team at just under $170 million in 2010. In December, 
Pegula officially expressed interest in buying the Sabres for $170 million 
and submitted a letter of intent to the NHL. In January, Golisano reportedly 
issued a counteroffer with an asking price of US$175 million.[19] Pegula 
and Golisano reached an agreement to sell the team on January 29, 2011, 
with Pegula buying the team for $189 million ($175 million with $14 million 
in debt included)[20][21] with the Sabres and Golisano officially making 
an announcement in a press conference on February 3, 2011.[22] League owners 
approved the sale on February 18.[23] In the conference, it was revealed 
that an unnamed bidder submitted a much higher bid than Pegula's, but made 
the bid contingent upon moving the team.[24] The description is consistent 
with that of Jim Balsillie, who has made public his efforts to move a team 
to Hamilton, Ontario, a move that the Sabres have actively opposed. Terry 
Pegula named former Pittsburgh Penguins executive Ted Black to be the team 
president.[25] Pegula was introduced as the Sabres' owner in a public ceremony 
at HSBC Arena on February 23, accompanied by what would be the final appearance 
of all three members of The French Connection before Rick Martin's death 
three weeks later. The uniforms worn until the 2014-15 season. Around the 
2010–11 trade deadline, the team attempted to trade Craig Rivet but was 
unsuccessful. After initially clearing waivers, Rivet entered re-entry 
waivers and was claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets.[26] Late on February 
27, the team acquired Brad Boyes from the St. Louis Blues for a second 
round draft pick.[27] This was the Sabres' sole trade of the deadline. 
After Pegula's official takeover of the team, the Sabres finished the regular 
season 16–4–4, never losing two consecutive games in that span, and landed 
the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference.[28] Pegula's approach was credited 
by players, fans, and the public with bringing new energy to the team, 
sparking a run to the playoffs that seemed improbable only months earlier. 
On April 8, the Sabres clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive 
season, beating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–3 in overtime. The Sabres clinched 
the seventh seed and faced Philadelphia in the first round. The Sabres 
had a three games to two lead but lost the series in seven games. The Sabres 
began the 2011–12 season in part of the NHL premiere series for the first 
time, playing games in Finland and Germany. The team was particularly well-received 
during a game against Adler Mannheim in Mannheim, the hometown of Sabres 
forward Jochen Hecht; a contingent of 65 Adler fans traveled from Germany 
to Buffalo in February 2012 to witness a Sabres game against the Boston 
Bruins.[29] Prior to the first game, Lindy Ruff named Jason Pominville 
the Sabres 13th full-time captain in team history.[30] The Sabres began 
the season relatively strong but collapsed after a Boston Bruins game in 
which Bruins forward Milan Lucic hit and injured goaltender Ryan Miller; 
the subsequent months saw the Sabres collapse to last place in the Eastern 
Conference. Despite a two-month rally that began in February along with 
the emergence of rookie forward Marcus Foligno, the Sabres lost the last 
two games of the regular season and fell three points short of a playoff 
spot. The 2012–13 NHL lockout eliminated the first part of the 2012–13 
season, which ultimately began with a scheduled 48 games.[31] After a 6–10–1 
start to the season, long-time coach Lindy Ruff was relieved of his duties 
by GM Darcy Regier on February 20, 2013, ending 16 seasons as head coach. 
He was replaced by Ron Rolston, first on an interim basis, then permanently 
after the season ended.[32] Due to the lockout shortened season, the trade 
deadline was moved to April 3, 2013. In the days leading up to it, the 
Sabres were active in trades. On March 15, the Sabres' first trade sent 
T. J. Brennan to the Florida Panthers for a fifth round pick (originally 
owned by the Los Angeles Kings) in the 2013 draft.[33] On March 30, the 
Sabres traded Jordan Leopold to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for a second 
round pick and a conditional fifth round pick in the 2013 draft.[34] On 
April 1, the Sabres traded Robyn Regehr to the Los Angeles Kings for two 
second round draft choices (one in 2014 and the other in the 2015).[35] 
The final trade came on the day of the trade deadline, April 3. The Sabres 
sent Jason Pominville to the Minnesota Wild for Johan Larsson and Matt 
Hackett. The official announcement came after the 3 p.m. deadline. At the 
time of the official announcement, it was not clear if there were other 
parts of the deal as the trade was still pending league approval.[36] It 
was later revealed draft picks were also involved in the deal. The Wild 
would receive a fourth round pick in 2014, and the Sabres would receive 
first round pick in the 2013 draft and a second round pick in 2014. The 
following season, on November 13, 2013, the team dismissed Regier and Rolston. 
Former Sabres coach Ted Nolan was named interim head coach for the remainder 
of the season (he later signed a three-year contract extension) and Pat 
LaFontaine was named President of Hockey Operations. On January 9, 2014, 
Tim Murray was named general manager. On February 28, 2014, Murray made 
his first major trade, sending star goalie Ryan Miller and forward Steve 
Ott to the St. Louis Blues for goalie Jaroslav Halak, forwards Chris Stewart 
and William Carrier and two draft picks. After just over three months as 
President of Hockey Operations, Pat LaFontaine resigned from the Sabres 
to return to his previous position with the NHL on March 1, 2014.[37] Among 
highlights in the otherwise bad 2013–14 season included the "butt goal" 
in which a severely short-staffed Sabres won their December 23 contest 
against the Phoenix Coyotes when Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith backed into 
his own goal with the puck lodged in his pants,[38] and the lone NHL appearance 
of former Lancaster High School goalie Ryan Vinz, who was working as a 
videographer in the Sabres organization, to suit up as a backup goaltender 
in the wake of the Ryan Miller trade. The Sabres finished the 2013-14 season 
last in the league, and again missed the playoffs. Despite winning two 
more games than the previous season, the 2014–15 season was much like the 
previous one, with the team sitting near the bottom of the standings the 
entire season, and finishing last in the league. On March 26, 2015, during 
a 4-3 overtime loss to the Arizona Coyotes, spectators at the game, ostensibly 
fans of the Sabres, cheered after a game-winning goal by Coyotes centre 
Sam Gagner. Said fans were more eager to see the team lose (the Sabres 
and Coyotes were 29th and 30th in the standings at the time) in the hopes 
that it would ensure the team would deliberately lose to finish in last 
place and guarantee a top-two pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, which included 
two extremely highly touted prospects, Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel. 
These spectators' “embrace the tank” philosophy led to criticism from the 
media and Sabres players for how the fans reacted.[39] However, some praised 
the fans for how they reacted, saying that they "did the right thing."[40] 
The Sabres clinched last place, and thus a top-two pick, with a loss to 
the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 10 (this was later confirmed to be a 
number-two pick after the team, for the second year in a row, lost the 
draft lottery); the team used the pick to select Eichel. Murray fired Nolan 
at the end of the season, citing a lack of chemistry and lukewarm relations 
between them.[41] On May 28, 2015, Dan Bylsma was hired as the 17th head 
coach in franchise history. The hiring of Bylsma, the drafting of Eichel 
and 2014 second overall pick Sam Reinhart, the acquisition of star centerman 
Ryan O'Reilly in the offseason, and the rising performance of youngsters 
Zemgus Girgensons, Jake McCabe and Rasmus Ristolainen resulted in an improved 
season in 2015-16. Even though the Sabres again missed the playoffs for 
the fourth consecutive season, the team managed to finish just under .500 
in points percentage while fans and critics have praised these rebuilding 
efforts by Sabres GM Tim Murray. In summer 2016, the team announced that 
its television broadcasts would be spun off to their own regional sports 
network, MSG Western New York. The new network will continue to operate 
under MSG control but will feature additional programs centered around 
the Sabres and the Buffalo Bills, which the Pegulas purchased separately 
in 2014. This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the
