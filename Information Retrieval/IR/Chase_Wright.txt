Major League draft by the New York Yankees out of Iowa Park High School. 
After spending five seasons in the minors, he was placed on the Yankees' 
40-man roster, to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. He started the 2007 
season in with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, where he performed well. In 
2 starts, he pitched 14 innings, striking out 19, without allowing an earned

league debut on April 17, 2007, against the Cleveland Indians. He pitched
