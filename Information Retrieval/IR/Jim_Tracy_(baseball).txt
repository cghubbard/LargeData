As player As manager James Edwin Tracy (born December 31, 1955) is a former 
professional baseball manager and player. He has managed the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Colorado Rockies. Tracy was named manager 
of the Rockies after the previous manager, Clint Hurdle, was fired on May 
29, 2009.[1] On November 18, 2009, Tracy was named Manager of the Year. 
He is only the second manager to win the award after being hired midseason, 
joining Jack McKeon for the Florida Marlins. Tracy was an All-America baseball 
player at Marietta College, a NCAA Division III institution in Ohio. He 
played as an outfielder for parts of two seasons with the Chicago Cubs 
in 1980–81. He also played two seasons in Japan with the Yokohama Taiyo 
Whales in 1983–84. Tracy worked as a minor league manager for several organizations. 
He is featured as the manager of the 1988 Peoria Chiefs in the book "The 
Boys Who Would Be Cubs", by Joseph Bosco [1]. Tracy later served as the 
bench coach of the Montreal Expos (under manager Felipe Alou), and the 
Dodgers (under manager Davey Johnson) in 1999 and 2000. Tracy was manager 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2001 to 2005, compiling four winning seasons 
and a 427–383 record. With Tracy as manager, the Dodgers won the National 
League's West division in 2004 but lost 3-1 to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the National League Division Series. On October 3, 2005, after finishing 
the season at 71-91, Tracy and the Dodgers agreed to part ways citing "philosophical 
differences."[2] Tracy was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates on October 11, 
2005. In two disappointing seasons in Pittsburgh, he compiled a 135–189 
record. Tracy was fired by the Pirates on October 5, 2007. Jim Tracy was 
hired as bench coach for the Colorado Rockies in November 2008. On May 
29, 2009, Clint Hurdle was fired with an 18–28 record, and Tracy was named 
to replace him. Tracy led the Rockies to the postseason, with a 74–42 (.638) 
record after taking over as manager, but lost the NLDS to the Philadelphia 
Phillies by a score of 3 games to 1. For his efforts in the 2009 season, 
Tracy was named Sporting News' NL Manager of the Year and the National 
League Manager of the Year as voted on by the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America. In 2010, the Rockies lost 13 of their last 14 games, collapsing 
from a 1/2 game deficit in the wild card race to finish 7 games behind 
an Atlanta Braves team that went 6-8 in the same span. In 2011, the Rockies 
began the season with an 11-2 record before finishing the season with a 
62-87 (.416) run that landed them in 4th place. After the 2011 season, 
the Rockies rewarded Tracy with an "indefinite" contract extension.[3] 
The Rockies went on to accumulate a 37-65 record (.363) through August 
1, leading to a front office reshuffle that left Jim Tracy and his staff 
intact. Tracy resigned as manager of the Rockies on October 7, 2012, following 
a disappointing and injury plagued 2012 season that saw the Rockies finish 
64-98, the worst record in franchise history.[4] His oldest son, Brian, 
played baseball at UC Santa Barbara, and was drafted in 2007 by the Pirates. 
He is now a scout for the Pirates. His son Chad plays in Triple-A for the 
Colorado Rockies organization. He was the first catcher drafted in the 
2006 draft when he was drafted in the third round. Chad, along with Bryan 
LaHair and Nick Stavinoha, led the Triple-A in runs batted in with 109 
in 2011. His youngest son, Mark, currently plays baseball for the Winston-Salem 
Dash, the Carolina League affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. Tracy is 
not related to retired former Washington Nationals player Chad Tracy. [5]
