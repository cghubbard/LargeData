The Commissioner of Baseball is the chief executive of Major League Baseball 
(MLB) and the associated Minor League Baseball (MiLB) – a constellation 
of leagues and clubs known as organized baseball.[1][2][3] Under the direction 
of the Commissioner, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball hires and 
maintains the sport's umpiring crews, and negotiates marketing, labor, 
and television contracts. The commissioner is chosen by a vote of the owners 
of the teams. The current commissioner is Rob Manfred, who assumed office 
on January 25, 2015. The title "commissioner", which is a title now applied 
to the heads of several other major sports leagues as well as baseball, 
derives from its predecessor office, the National Commission. The National 
Commission was the ruling body of professional baseball starting with the 
National Agreement of 1903, which made peace between the National League 
and the American League (see History of baseball in the United States). 
It consisted of three members: the two League presidents and a Commission 
chairman, whose primary responsibilities were to preside at meetings and 
to mediate disputes. Although the Commission chairman was the nominal head 
of major league baseball, it was AL President Ban Johnson who dominated 
the Commission. The event that would eventually lead to the appointment 
of a single Commissioner of Baseball was the Black Sox Scandal — perhaps 
the worst of a series of incidents in the late 1910s that jeopardized the 
integrity of the game. However, the motivations behind the creation of 
the Commissioner's office were more than the mere desire to rebuild public 
relations. The scandal had not only tarnished the image of baseball, but 
had brought relations between team owners and AL President Johnson to a 
breaking point. In particular, Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey 
was incensed at what he perceived to be Johnson's indifference to his suspicions 
that the 1919 World Series had been thrown. As a result, the National League, 
whose owners had never been on good terms with Johnson, agreed to invite 
the White Sox along with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees to join 
their league. The NL also unveiled plans to put a twelfth team in Detroit. 
With the American League's status as a major league and possibly its very 
existence suddenly in jeopardy, the five AL owners loyal to Johnson sued 
for peace. Eventually, at the urging of Detroit Tigers owner and Johnson 
loyalist Frank Navin, a compromise was reached in late 1920 to reform the 
National Commission with a membership of non-baseball men. Having agreed 
to appoint only non-baseball men to the National Commission, the owners 
tapped federal judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, an ardent baseball fan, to 
serve as the reformed commission's chairman.[4] Landis responded by declaring 
that he would only accept an appointment as sole commissioner, with nearly 
unlimited authority to act in the "best interests of baseball" — in essence, 
serving as an arbitrator whose decisions could not be appealed. Finally, 
Landis insisted on a lifetime contract. The owners, still reeling from 
the perception that the sport was crooked, readily agreed. Landis's first 
significant act was to deal with the Black Sox scandal. Following a trial, 
the eight players suspected of involvement in the fix were acquitted, including 
Buck Weaver and superstar Shoeless Joe Jackson. Nevertheless, immediately 
following the players' acquittal, Landis banned them all from baseball 
for life. He famously declared, "Regardless of the verdict of juries, no 
player who throws a ballgame, no player that undertakes or promises to 
throw a ballgame, no player that sits in conference with a bunch of crooked 
players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing a game are discussed 
and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional 
baseball." Landis explained that even though the players had all been acquitted 
in court, none of them could be allowed back in the game if its image was 
to be restored with the public.[5] Over the years, he dealt harshly with 
others proven to have thrown individual games, consorted with gamblers 
or engaged in actions that he felt tarnished the image of the game. Among 
the others he banned were New York Giants players Phil Douglas and Jimmy 
O'Connell, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Gene Paulette, Giants coach Cozy 
Dolan, and (in 1943) Phillies owner William D. Cox. He also formalized 
the unofficial banishments of Hal Chase and Heinie Zimmerman. In 1921, 
he banned Giants center fielder Benny Kauff even though he had been acquitted 
of involvement in a car theft ring. Nonetheless, Landis was convinced Kauff 
was guilty and argued that players of "undesirable reputation and character" 
had no place in baseball. The owners had initially assumed that Landis 
would deal with the Black Sox Scandal and then settle into a comfortable 
retirement as the titular head of baseball. Instead, Landis ruled baseball 
with an iron hand for the next 25 years. He established a fiercely independent 
Commissioner's Office that would go on to often make both players and owners 
miserable with decisions that he argued were in the best interests of the 
game. He worked to clean up the hooliganism that was tarnishing the reputation 
of players in the 1920s, and inserted his office into negotiations with 
players, where he deemed appropriate, to end a few of the labor practices 
of owners like Charles Comiskey that had contributed to the players' discontent. 
He also personally approved broadcasters for the World Series. Landis' 
only significant rival in the early years was longtime American League 
founder and president Ban Johnson, who had been reckoned as the most powerful 
man in the game before Landis' arrival. Johnson was as strong-willed as 
Landis, and a clash between the two was inevitable. It happened in the 
1924 World Series. When several Giants were implicated in a plan to bribe 
players on the moribund Phillies late in the season, Johnson demanded that 
the Series be canceled, and loudly criticized Landis' handling of the affair, 
to which Landis responded by threatening to resign. The American League 
owners promised to throw Johnson out of office if he stepped out of line 
again. Two years later, when Johnson criticized Landis' decision to give 
Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker an amnesty after it surfaced they had bet on a 
fixed game in 1919, Landis told the American League owners to choose between 
him and Johnson. The owners promptly sent Johnson on a sabbatical from 
which he never really returned. Landis perpetuated the color line and prolonged 
the segregation of organized baseball. His successor, Happy Chandler, said, 
"For twenty-four years Judge Landis wouldn't let a black man play. I had 
his records, and I read them, and for twenty-four years Landis consistently 
blocked any attempts to put blacks and whites together on a big league 
field."[6] Bill Veeck claimed Landis prevented him from purchasing the 
Phillies when Landis learned of Veeck's plan to integrate the team. The 
signing of the first black ballplayer in the modern era, Jackie Robinson, 
came less than a year after Landis's death on Chandler's watch and was 
engineered by one of Landis's old nemeses, Branch Rickey. Eleven weeks 
after Robinson's debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Veeck became the first 
American League owner to break the color line. Landis tried to curb the 
growth of minor league farm systems by innovators such as Rickey, in the 
name of protecting the lower levels of professional ball. Landis argued 
that because a parent club could unilaterally call up players from teams 
which were involved in pennant races, the organization was unfairly interfering 
with the minor competitions. His position was that the championship of 
each minor league was of no less importance than the championships of the 
major leagues, and that minor league fans and supporters had the right 
to see their teams competing as best they could. Yet he also prevented 
the formation of a powerful third major league when he stopped Pants Rowland 
from upgrading the Pacific Coast League in the 1940s. One of the schemes 
he fought was the effort by major-league teams to "cover up" players they 
were hiding in their farm systems. The term, not used in formal communications 
by league or team officials, referred to players clandestinely signed by 
a major-league team to a minor-league contract. Occasionally one team would 
serendipitously find such a player in the off-season draft, as in this 
occasion recorded in the book Dodger Daze and Knights: All the clubowners 
and managers, and Commissioner Landis, were assembled to conduct the draft. 
One team representative said he "claim[s] Player [Paul] Richards of Brooklyn." 
"You can't do that!" barked a surprised Wilbert Robinson, manager of the 
Brooklyn Dodgers. "Why not?" asked Landis. "Because Brooklyn has him covered 
up", sputtered Robbie. Most of the others broke down laughing. Even Landis 
smirked. Whether his decisions were praised or criticized, he was satisfied 
with being respected and feared. Dubbed "the baseball tyrant" by journalists 
of the day, his rule was absolute. In the context of ensuring the integrity 
of the game itself, baseball historians generally regard him as the right 
man at the right time when appointed, but also as a man who perhaps held 
office too long. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1944, in 
a special election held one month after his death, and the Most Valuable 
Player Award in each league is officially known as the Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis Award in his honor. When Judge Landis died in 1944, an official 
in the War Department began campaigning for Happy Chandler's election to 
the post. Despite being the last candidate put forth in the April 1945 
meetings, he was elected by a unanimous vote of the team owners, and resigned 
his Senate seat in October of that year.[7] Chandler clashed with Brooklyn 
Dodgers manager Leo "the Lip" Durocher over Durocher's association with 
gambling figures and his marriage to actress Laraine Day, which came amid 
allegations from Day's ex-husband that Durocher had stolen her away from 
him.[8] Before the start of the 1947 season, Chandler suspended Durocher 
for the entire season, citing "conduct detrimental to baseball."[9] The 
Dodgers went on to win the pennant that season under replacement manager 
Burt Shotton.[8] Chandler became known as "the players' commissioner" for 
his work on their behalf.[10] During his service, he presided over the 
establishment of a pension fund for players and oversaw the initial steps 
toward integration of the major leagues, beginning with the debut of Jackie 
Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. This move was controversial 
with team owners, who voted 15–1 against integrating the sport in a secret 
January 1947 meeting. The Dodgers' Branch Rickey met with Chandler, who 
agreed to back the team's move. Chandler's stance was credited by many 
in the sports community with Chandler's failure to be selected for another 
term as Commissioner after the expiration of his first one in 1951.[11] 
Chandler was fully aware that he was jeopardizing his own commissionership 
by stewarding the integration process. Chandler's attitude was a simple 
one, which he conveyed to Branch Rickey, and later recounted in his autobiography:[12] 
In 1951, Ford Frick succeeded Happy Chandler as commissioner of baseball. 
Frick's critics accused him of favoring the NL in his rulings, such as 
how the 1960s expansion teams would be stocked. Frick's most highly criticized 
statement[citation needed] as commissioner was made in 1961, when several 
players were on a pace to break Babe Ruth's single-season home run record. 
In a press conference, Frick stated that the single-season home run record 
should be separated into multiple lists, based on length of season. However, 
as MLB did not publish an official record book at the time, Frick had no 
control on how publishers presented MLB records, and within a few years 
after Roger Maris broke Ruth's record, all record books gave Maris sole 
credit as the single-season home run record holder.[13] Later, it was revealed 
that Frick had served as a ghostwriter for Ruth earlier in his career.[citation 
needed] Frick successfully prevented the Continental League, a proposed 
third major league, from ever playing, and introduced major league baseball 
to several markets in which the proposed league planned to play through 
expansion and relocation. More than 150 names appeared on the original 
list of nominees for the commissionership following Ford Frick's retirement. 
The club owners initially were unable to decide if the next commissioner 
should come from the ranks of the game (e.g., the president of the American 
or National Leagues), or elsewhere. They finally decided that the new commissioner 
should have a strong business background to deal with the problems that 
were confronting the game at the time. William Eckert became a serious 
candidate for the commissionership only after fellow officer Curtis LeMay 
gave Major League Baseball a recommendation for him. On November 17, 1965, 
by a unanimous vote of the then, 20 major league club owners, William Eckert 
became the fourth Commissioner of Major League Baseball. When he became 
commissioner, Eckert had not seen a game in person in over 10 years. He 
was a compromise choice for the job, previously being so obscure that sportswriters 
nicknamed him "the Unknown Soldier." He incurred the public's ire by refusing 
to cancel games after the assassinations of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and 
Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and team owners' disdain because he refused 
to deal forcefully with substantive business issues. Anticipating a players' 
strike and having no ownership confidence in his ability to handle the 
situation, Eckert was forced to resign at the end of the 1968 season, although 
he still had three years on his contract. In spite of his much publicized 
failures and shortcomings, William Eckert also developed more effective 
committee actions, streamlined business methods and helped stabilize franchises 
with bigger stadiums and long-term leases. In addition, Eckert worked hard 
toward promoting the game internationally, including a 1966 tour of Japan 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Bowie Kuhn's tenure was marked by labor strikes 
(most notably in 1981), owner disenchantment, and the end of baseball's 
reserve clause, yet baseball enjoyed unprecedented attendance gains (from 
23 million in 1968 to 45.5 million in 1983) and television contracts during 
the same time frame. Kuhn suspended numerous players for involvement with 
drugs and gambling, and took a strong stance against any activity that 
he perceived to be "not in the best interests of baseball."[14] In 1970, 
he suspended star Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain indefinitely (the 
suspension was later set at 3 months) due to McLain's involvement in a 
bookmaking operation, and later suspended McLain for the rest of the season 
for carrying a gun. He barred both Willie Mays (in 1979) and Mickey Mantle 
(in 1983) from the sport due to their involvement in casino promotion; 
neither was directly involved in gambling, and both were reinstated by 
Kuhn's successor Peter Ueberroth in 1985. Also in 1970, Kuhn described 
Jim Bouton's Ball Four as "detrimental to baseball" and demanded that Bouton 
retract it. The book has been republished several times and is now considered 
a classic. On October 13, 1971, the World Series held a night game for 
the first time. Kuhn, who thought that baseball could attract a larger 
audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon 
broadcast, when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the 
idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; TV ratings 
for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached 
such a record number. Kuhn's vision in this instance has been fulfilled, 
as all the World Series games are now shown in prime time. On October 7, 
1969, the St. Louis Cardinals traded Curt Flood, catcher Tim McCarver, 
outfielder Byron Browne, and left-handed pitcher Joe Hoerner to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for first baseman Dick Allen, second baseman Cookie Rojas, and 
right-handed ace relief pitcher Jerry Johnson. However, Flood refused to 
report to the moribund Phillies, citing the team's poor record and the 
fact that they played in dilapidated Connie Mack Stadium before belligerent 
and, Flood believed, racist fans. Flood forfeited a relatively lucrative 
US$100,000 (equivalent to $646,370 as of in 2015)[15] contract by his refusal 
to be traded to the Phillies. In a letter to Kuhn, Flood demanded that 
the commissioner declare him a free agent. Kuhn denied his request, citing 
the propriety of the reserve clause, which was language in contracts that 
essentially prevented a player from playing with another team even after 
his contract expired. In response, Flood filed a lawsuit against Kuhn and 
Major League Baseball on January 16, 1970, alleging that Major League Baseball 
had violated federal antitrust laws. Even though Flood was making $90,000 
(equivalent to $581,733 in 2015)[15] at the time, he likened the reserve 
clause to slavery. It was a controversial analogy, even among those who 
opposed the reserve clause. The case, Flood v. Kuhn (407 U.S. 258) eventually 
went to the Supreme Court. Flood's attorney, former Supreme Court Justice 
Arthur Goldberg, asserted that the reserve clause depressed wages and limited 
players to one team for life. Major League Baseball's counsel countered 
that Commissioner Kuhn acted under the way he did '"for the good of the 
game." Ultimately, the Supreme Court, acting on stare decisis "to stand 
by things decided", ruled 5–3 in favor of Major League Baseball, upholding 
a 1922 ruling in the case of Federal Baseball Club v. National League, 
(259 U.S. 200.) Though he had a reputation as an owners' commissioner, 
Kuhn did not avoid confronting owners when he deemed it necessary. For 
example, he was a major adversary of Oakland Athletics owner Charles O. 
Finley. A major embarrassment for baseball resulted from Finley's actions 
during the 1973 World Series. Finley forced player Mike Andrews to sign 
a false affidavit saying he was injured after the reserve infielder committed 
two consecutive errors in the 12th inning of Oakland's Game 2 loss to the 
New York Mets. Andrews' teammates as well as manager Dick Williams rallied 
to his defense. Kuhn in return, forced Finley to reinstate Andrews. In 
1976, when Finley attempted to sell several players to the Boston Red Sox 
and New York Yankees for $3.5 million, Kuhn blocked the deals on the grounds 
that they would be bad for the game. Some believe that Kuhn's actions were 
simply a revenge tactic, aimed at Finley, after Finley attempted to force 
an owners vote to remove Kuhn as commissioner in 1975. After being in office 
for over ten years, Kuhn had grown a strong reputation for being hard on 
players who abused drugs. Kuhn was quick to punish players who used drugs 
with heavy fines and suspensions. Kansas City Royals catcher Darrell Porter 
told the Associated Press that during the winter of 1979–1980 he became 
paranoid, convinced that Kuhn knew about his drug abuse, was trying to 
sneak into his house, and planned to ban him from baseball for life. Porter 
found himself sitting up at night in the dark watching out the front window, 
waiting for Kuhn to approach, clutching billiard balls and a shotgun. Ironically, 
when Porter was named the most valuable player of the 1982 World Series 
while playing for the Cardinals, Kuhn was on hand to congratulate him. 
In 1980, during the Iranian hostage crisis, Kuhn sat at a baseball game 
with Jeremiah Denton, a Navy admiral and former POW in Vietnam who would 
be elected U.S. Senator later that year from the state of Alabama. Recalling 
the event to The Washington Post, Kuhn believed that "that afternoon...the 
idea of a lifetime baseball pass was discussed," and upon their return 
from Iran, each of the 52 hostages was given one of these unique passes.[16] 
In 1983, four players from the Kansas City Royals – Willie Wilson, Jerry 
Martin, Willie Mays Aikens, and Vida Blue – were found guilty of cocaine 
use. In addition, such established stars as Ferguson Jenkins, Keith Hernandez, 
Dave Parker, and Dale Berra admitted to having problems with drugs. Kuhn 
was both praised and attacked for the firm stand that he levied against 
offenders. In 1982, some of the owners organized a move to push him out 
of office. In 1983, Kuhn and his supporters made a last-ditch effort to 
renew his contract but ultimately failed. Kuhn, though, was allowed to 
stay for the 1984 regular season before being replaced by Peter Ueberroth. 
Peter Ueberroth was elected to succeed Bowie Kuhn on March 3, 1984 and 
took office on October 1 of that year. As a condition of his hiring, Ueberroth 
increased the commissioner's fining ability from US$5,000 to $250,000. 
His salary was raised to a reported $450,000, nearly twice what Kuhn was 
paid. Just as Ueberroth was taking office the Major League Umpires Union 
was threatening to strike the postseason. Ueberroth managed to arbitrate 
the disagreement and had the umpires back to work before the League Championship 
Series were over. The next summer, Ueberroth worked behind the scenes to 
limit a players' strike to one day before a new labor agreement was worked 
out with the Players Association. During the course of his stint as commissioner, 
Ueberroth reinstated Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, who 
had been banned from working for Major League Baseball by Kuhn because 
of their associations with gambling casinos. Also, Ueberroth suspended 
numerous players because of cocaine use, negotiated a $1.2 billion television 
contract with CBS,[17] and initiated the investigation against Pete Rose's 
betting habits. In 1985, Ueberroth's first full year in office, the League 
Championship Series expanded from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven 
series. At his urging, the Chicago Cubs chose to install lights at Wrigley 
Field rather than reimburse the leagues for lost night-game revenues. Ueberroth 
then found a new source of income in the form of persuading large corporations 
to pay for the privilege of having their products endorsed by Major League 
Baseball. However, Ueberroth, with the assistance of the owners, also facilitated 
collusion, an illegal violation of the league's collective bargaining agreement 
with the players, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 off-seasons. Players entering 
free-agency were prevented from both signing equitable contracts and joining 
the teams of their choice during this period, a strategy that union leader 
Marvin Miller later held was "tantamount to fixing, not just games, but 
entire pennant races, including all post-season series."[18] The MLBPA 
filed collusion charges, arguing that Ueberroth and team owners had violated 
the collective bargaining agreement in the 1985, 1986, and 1987 seasons. 
The MLBPA won each case, resulting in "second look" free agents, and over 
$280 million in owner fines.[19] Fay Vincent, who followed Ueberroth's 
successor in the commissioner's office, laid the crippling labor problems 
of the early 1990s directly at the feet of Ueberroth and the owners' collusion, 
holding that the collusion years constituted theft from the players.[20] 
Under Ueberroth, Major League Baseball enjoyed increased attendance (record 
attendance four straight seasons), greater awareness of crowd control and 
alcohol management within ballparks, a successful and vigilant anti-drug 
campaign, significant industry-wide improvement in the area of fair employment, 
and a significantly improved financial picture for the industry. When Ueberroth 
took office, 21 of the 26 clubs were losing money; in Ueberroth's last 
full season--1988—all clubs either broke even or finished in the black. 
In 1987, for example, baseball as an industry showed a net profit of $21.3 
million, its first profitable year since 1973. Nonetheless, following the 
announcement of the first of three large awards to the players following 
the collusion findings, Ueberroth stepped down as commissioner before the 
start of the 1989 regular season; his contract was to have run through 
the end of the season. He was succeeded by National League president A. 
Bartlett Giamatti. A. Bartlett Giamatti had a lifelong interest in baseball 
(he was a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan). He became President of the National 
League in 1986, and later Commissioner of Baseball in 1989. During his 
stint as National League president, Giamatti placed an emphasis on the 
need to improve the environment for the fan in the ballparks. He also decided 
to make umpires strictly enforce the balk rule, and supported "social justice" 
as the only remedy for the lack of presence of minority managers, coaches, 
or executives at any level in Major League Baseball. While still serving 
as National League president, Giamatti suspended Pete Rose for 30 games 
after Rose shoved umpire Dave Pallone on April 30, 1988. Later that year, 
Giamatti also suspended Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jay Howell, who was 
caught using pine tar during the National League Championship Series. Giamatti, 
whose tough dealing with Yale's union favorably impressed Major League 
Baseball owners, was unanimously elected to succeed Peter Ueberroth as 
commissioner on September 8, 1988 and assumed office on April 1, 1989.[21] 
Giamatti was commissioner on August 24, 1989 when Pete Rose voluntarily 
agreed to permanent ineligibility from baseball.[22] As reflected in the 
agreement with Pete Rose, Giamatti was determined to maintain the integrity 
of the game during his brief commissionership. While at his vacation home 
on Martha's Vineyard, Giamatti, a heavy smoker for many years, died suddenly 
of a massive heart attack at the age of 51, just eight days after banishing 
Rose and 154 days into his tenure as commissioner.[23] He became the second 
baseball commissioner to die in office, the first being Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis. Baseball's owners soon selected Fay Vincent, Giamatti's close friend 
and baseball's first-ever deputy commissioner, as the new commissioner. 
At his longtime friend incoming commissioner Bart Giamatti's behest, Fay 
Vincent accepted the position of deputy commissioner.[24] He became the 
8th commissioner of baseball following Giamatti's death on September 1, 
1989, and presided over the 1989 World Series, which was interrupted by 
the Loma Prieta earthquake; the owners' lockout during Spring training 
of the 1990 season; and the expulsion of George Steinbrenner in his first 
year. Before accepting the job as Commissioner of Baseball, Vincent consulted 
with Bart Giamatti's widow, Toni, to make sure she thought it was appropriate 
for him to do so. In 1990, National League president Bill White was prepared 
to suspend umpire Joe West for slamming Philadelphia pitcher Dennis Cook 
to the field, but Vincent intervened and no discipline was imposed. During 
his commissionership, Vincent made it known (e.g. while being interviewed 
by Pat O'Brien during CBS' coverage of Game 4 of the 1991 World Series) 
that if he had the chance, he would get rid of the designated hitter rule. 
Vincent has also been connected with Pete Rose's lifetime banishment from 
baseball; however, Rose's banishment began while Giamatti was commissioner, 
not Vincent (although Vincent led the investigation and was involved in 
the negotiations). Vincent has publicly said he does not support Rose's 
reinstatement. On October 17, 1989, Vincent sat in a field box behind the 
left dugout at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. At 5:04 p.m., just prior 
to Game 3 of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland 
Athletics, the 6.9 Mw Loma Prieta earthquake hit with a maximum Mercalli 
intensity of IX (Violent). At approximately 5:35 p.m., after coming to 
the conclusion that the power couldn't be restored before sunset, Vincent 
ordered the game to be postponed. According to Vincent, he had already 
made the decision to postpone Game 3 without telling anybody first. As 
a result, the umpires filed a formal protest of Vincent's decision. However, 
the game had to be postponed due to trouble with gas lines as well as the 
power issue. The World Series ultimately resumed after a ten-day postponement 
(and some initial conflict between Vincent and San Francisco mayor Art 
Agnos, who felt that the World Series ought to have been delayed much longer) 
on October 27, 1989. While presenting the Commissioner's Trophy to the 
Athletics, who wound up winning the World Series in a four-game sweep, 
Vincent summed up the 1989 World Series as a "Remarkable World Series in 
many respects." In February 1990, owners announced that spring training 
would not be starting as scheduled. This occurred after MLBPA Executive 
Director Donald Fehr became afraid that the owners would institute a salary 
cap. Fehr believed that a salary cap could possibly restrict the number 
of choices free agents could make and a pay-for-performance scale would 
eliminate multiyear contracts. The lockout, which was the seventh work 
stoppage in baseball since 1972, lasted 32 games and wiped out all of spring 
training. Vincent worked with both the owners and MLBPA, and on March 19, 
1990, Vincent was able to announce a new Basic Agreement (which raised 
the minimum major league salary from US$68,000 to $100,000 and established 
a six-man study committee on revenue sharing). As a consequence for the 
lockout, Opening Day for the 1990 season was moved back a week to April 
9, and the season was extended by three days to accommodate the normal 
162-game schedule. On July 30, 1990, Vincent banned New York Yankees owner 
George Steinbrenner from baseball for life after Steinbrenner paid Howie 
Spira, a small-time gambler, $40,000 for "dirt" on his outfielder Dave 
Winfield after Winfield sued Steinbrenner for failing to pay his foundation 
the $300,000 guaranteed in his contract. Steinbrenner was eventually reinstated 
in 1993 (one year after Vincent left office). On June 24, 1992, Vincent 
permanently suspended pitcher Steve Howe for repeated drug offenses. Vincent 
was incensed when upper Yankee management (Buck Showalter, Gene Michael, 
and Jack Lawn) agreed to testify on Howe's behalf, and threatened them 
with expulsion from the game: Ironically, the three men were unaffected 
by Vincent's hyperbole, testified for Howe as promised, and remained active 
in baseball. Three months later, Vincent was removed from his job as commissioner. 
An arbitrator overturned Vincent's suspension of Howe on November 11, 1992. 
In June 1991, Vincent declared that the American League would receive US$42 
million of the National League's $190 million in expansion revenue and 
that the AL would provide players in the National League expansion draft 
(involving the Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins). In an attempt to 
win support in the American League and balance the vote, Vincent decreed 
that the AL owners were entitled to 22 percent of the $190 million take. 
This decision marked the first time in expansion history that leagues were 
required to share expansion revenue or provide players for another league's 
expansion draft. Vincent said the owners expanded to raise money to pay 
their collusion debt.[20] Just prior to leaving office, Vincent had plans 
to realign the National League. Vincent wanted the Chicago Cubs and St. 
Louis Cardinals to move from the Eastern Division to the Western Division. 
Part of the impetus for realignment was the geographically anomalous placement 
of the Cincinnati Reds and Atlanta Braves in the West and the Cubs and 
the Cardinals in the east since 1969. National League president Bill White 
warned Vincent that realigning without league approval would be in violation 
of the National League Constitution. Many thought this plan would be beneficial 
to the league as a whole, especially by building a regional rivalry between 
the new franchise in Miami and the Atlanta Braves. The Cubs, however, opposed 
the move, suggesting that fans in the Central Time Zone would be forced 
to watch more games originating on the West Coast with later broadcast 
times (had the realignment included the use of a balanced schedule, the 
Cubs would have actually played more games against teams outside their 
division). On July 17, 1992, the Chicago Cubs sued Vincent and asked the 
U.S. District Court in Chicago for a preliminary injunction to prevent 
implementation, which was granted two weeks later. After Vincent's attorneys 
appealed, oral arguments were scheduled for August 30 that year. Ultimately, 
Vincent resigned before the litigation was scheduled to resume, so as a 
result, the Cubs dropped their suit. Although Vincent's vision never really 
came into fruition, Major League Baseball did in fact realign in 1994, 
albeit in the form of three divisions in each league, and the addition 
of an expanded playoff format. His relationship with baseball's owners 
was always tenuous at best; he resigned in 1992 after the owners gave him 
an 18–9 no confidence vote. The owners were still angry at Vincent over 
his intervention during the 1990 lockout. The owners were also disappointed 
by dwindling television ratings in light of a US$1.2 billion, four-year 
deal with CBS (which ultimately cost the network $500 million) beginning 
in 1990 (Vincent's first full season as commissioner) and upwardly spiraling 
salaries. (It is also important to note that CBS itself contributed to 
decreasing ratings thanks to the haphazard scheduling of Game of the Week 
broadcasts during the regular season to the point that fans grew tired 
of tuning into no baseball on summer Saturdays.) They also accused him 
of acting in a high-handed manner, especially in the Howe affair. The leaders 
in the movement to oust Vincent were members of what The Sporting News 
later dubbed The Great Lakes Gang:[25] In his farewell, Vincent said He 
was replaced by Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig, whose family continued 
to maintain ownership over the Brewers. Fay Vincent was never able to complete 
the five-year term that he had inherited from Bart Giamatti. Vincent would 
later contend that Major League Baseball made a huge mistake by not appointing 
his deputy commissioner Steve Greenberg — the son of the Hall of Famer 
Hank Greenberg — as the commissioner.[citation needed] Bud Selig served 
as the Executive Council Chairman from 1992 to 1998, acting as the commissioner, 
and then was appointed as the official commissioner in 1998.[26] Selig 
oversaw baseball through the 1994 strike, the introduction of the wild 
card, interleague play, and the merging of the National and American leagues 
under the Office of the Commissioner. He was instrumental in organizing 
the World Baseball Classic in 2006.[26] Selig also introduced revenue sharing.[27] 
He is credited for the financial turnaround of baseball during his tenure 
with a 400 percent increase in the revenue of MLB and annual record breaking 
attendance.[26] During Selig's term of service, the use of steroids and 
other performance-enhancing drugs became a public issue. The Mitchell Report, 
commissioned by Selig, concluded that the MLB commissioners, club officials, 
the Players Association, and the players all share "to some extent in the 
responsibility for the steroid era."[28] Following the release of the Mitchell 
Report, Congressman Cliff Stearns called publicly for Selig to step down 
as commissioner, citing his "glacial response" to the "growing stain on 
baseball."[26] Selig pledged on numerous occasions to rid baseball of performance-enhancing 
drugs, and oversaw and instituted many rule changes and penalties to that 
end.[29] Bud Selig helped introduce the following changes to Major League 
Baseball: During Selig's years of service, new stadiums opened in Atlanta, 
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Colorado, Detroit, Houston, Miami, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, 
Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Arlington, St. 
Louis, Washington, D.C., Queens, The Bronx, and Minneapolis, while Kauffman 
Stadium in Kansas City underwent a major renovation. Selig retired from 
the position at the end of the 2014 season. Rob Manfred was elected as 
the 10th commissioner of baseball on August 14, 2014.[30] Manfred, who 
has worked full-time for Major League Baseball since 1998, was elected 
on the third ballot after falling one vote short of the 23 vote (3/4 super-majority)[31] 
threshold on the first two ballots.[32] It was baseball's first contested 
commissioner election in 46 years[33] as Chicago White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf and Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno led a group in support 
of Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner, who they felt would take a tougher 
stance against the players in labor negotiations.[32] Manfred took over 
from Bud Selig on January 25, 2015.[34] Tensions between commissioners 
and the baseball team owners who elected them, exacerbated by baseball's 
chronic labor conflicts with the Major League Baseball Players Association 
beginning in the 1970s, came to a head in 1992, when baseball owners voted 
no confidence in Commissioner Fay Vincent by a tally of 18–9. The owners 
had a number of grievances against Vincent, especially the perception that 
he had been too favorable to the players during the lockout of 1990. Unlike 
his replacement Selig, Vincent stated that the owners colluded against 
the players. Vincent put it this way: "The Union basically doesn’t trust 
the Ownership because collusion was a $280 million theft by Selig and Chicago 
White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf of that money from the players. I mean, 
they rigged the signing of free agents. They got caught. They paid $280 
million to the players. And I think that's polluted labor relations in 
baseball ever since it happened. I think it's the reason union chief Donald 
Fehr has no trust in Selig."[35] Vincent resigned on September 7, 1992. 
Selig, the longtime owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, was appointed chairman 
of baseball's Executive Council, making him the de facto acting commissioner 
(among the potential candidates for a permanent commissioner discussed 
in the media were future President George W. Bush, who was the managing 
partner for the Texas Rangers from 1989 to 1994,[36] and George J. Mitchell, 
then Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate).[37] While acting commissioner, 
Selig presided over Major League Baseball during the 1994 player's strike, 
which led to the cancellation of the World Series. Selig continued as acting 
commissioner until July 8, 1998, when the owners officially appointed him 
to the commissioner position.[38] Having been an owner for 30 years, Selig 
was seen as having closer ties to the MLB team owners than previous commissioners. 
Selig's administration had many perceived successes, such as expansion 
and interleague play. In May 2008, Bud Selig surpassed Bowie Kuhn as the 
second longest-serving commissioner (including his time as "acting commissioner" 
from 1992 to mid-1998), behind Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who died in office 
after 24 years of service.[39] Beginning in 2006, Selig repeatedly stated 
his intention to retire at the end of his contract in 2009.[40] However, 
on 17 January 2008, it was announced that Selig accepted a 3-year extension 
through the 2012 season [41] A prominent issue currently faced by Major 
League Baseball is the usage of performance-enhancing drugs, including 
anabolic steroids, by ballplayers in the late 1990s through 2009. Addressing 
the issue of whether Selig should have taken alternate actions, former 
commissioner Fay Vincent wrote in the April 24, 2006, issue of Sports Illustrated 
that with most of Barry Bonds' official troubles being off the field, and 
with the strength of the players' union, there is little Selig can do beyond 
appointing an investigating committee. Vincent said that Selig is largely 
"an observer of a forum beyond his reach." Another challenge facing the 
Office of the Commissioner is competitive imbalance and struggling attendance 
in small markets.[42][43][better source needed] In 2010, just 2 teams (Boston 
Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies) sold out every game and many teams failed 
to draw 2 million fans. In the Office of the Commissioner's Blue Ribbon 
Panel on Baseball Economics, it was found that the luxury tax was failing 
to correct the competitive balance of the league and several steps were 
needed to correct the current state of revenue generating and sharing.
