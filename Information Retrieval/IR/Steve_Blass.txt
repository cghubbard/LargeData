Stephen Robert "Steve" Blass (born April 18, 1942) is a former Major League 
Baseball right-handed pitcher and a current broadcast announcer for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. Blass was born in Canaan, Connecticut. In a 10-year 
career, he went 103–76 with 896 strikeouts and a 3.63 ERA in 1597 innings 
pitched. Signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1960, he made his major league 
debut in 1964 and joined the team permanently in 1966. He won 18 games 
in 1968, including a 2.12 ERA with seven shutouts, both career highs, and 
he finished particularly strong, winning the NL Player of the Month award 
for September with a 5-1 record, 1.65 ERA, and 46 SO. In 1969 won 16 with 
a career-high 147 strikeouts. From 1969 to 1972 he won 60 games, with a 
career-high 19 victories in 1972. In that season, he made the National 
League All-Star team. In the 1971 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, 
Blass pitched two complete game wins, allowing only seven hits and two 
runs in 18 innings, and was the winning pitcher in the 7th and deciding 
game. He finished second in the voting for World Series MVP behind teammate 
Roberto Clemente. Besides his Series performance, Blass is best known for 
his sudden and inexplicable loss of control after the 1972 season.[1] His 
ERA climbed to 9.85 in the 1973 season. He walked 84 batters in 88 2⁄3 
innings, and struck out only 27, laboring through the 1973 season; his 
-4.0 WAR that year still stands as the worst single-season WAR for a pitcher 
since 1901.[2] After spending most of 1974 in the minor leagues, he retired 
from baseball in March 1975. Two months later writer Roger Angell chronicled 
Blass's travails in an essay in The New Yorker.[3] A condition referred 
to as "Steve Blass disease" has become a part of baseball lexicon. The 
"diagnosis" is applied to talented players who inexplicably and permanently 
seem to lose their ability to throw a baseball accurately.[1][4][5][6] 
The fielder's variant of "Steve Blass disease" is sometimes referred to 
in baseball terminology as "Steve Sax syndrome". Notable victims of "Steve 
Blass disease" include Rick Ankiel,[5][7][8] Mark Wohlers,[9] Dontrelle 
Willis,[10] Ricky Romero,[11][12] Daniel Bard, [13] and Chuck Knoblauch.[14] 
In an interview years later, Blass mentioned that he was content with how 
his career panned out, mentioning that he had gotten ten good years with 
the Pirates, won 100 games, and appeared in a World Series.[15] He did 
mention that the sudden death of teammate and close friend Roberto Clemente 
in the offseason before he lost control – and the associated grief related 
to losing someone so close suddenly – did not play a factor in him losing 
his control.[16] Blass worked in the late 1970s as a salesman for a Pittsburgh 
company that manufactured school class rings.[17] He joined the Pirates' 
TV and radio broadcast team in 1983 as a part-time color commentator, earning 
a full-time post in 1986. Before the 2005 season, he announced that he 
would announce only home games from then on to spend more time with his 
family.[citation needed] He was inducted into the Kinston Professional 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. Blass' autobiography, A Pirate For Life, 
(Triumph Books) was released on May 1, 2012. His memoirs, co-written with 
Erik Sherman, encompass his struggles with Steve Blass disease and his
