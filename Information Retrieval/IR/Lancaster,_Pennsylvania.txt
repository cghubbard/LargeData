Lancaster (/ˈlænkæstər/, local /ˈlæŋkᵻstər/; Pennsylvania German: Lengeschder) 
is a city located in South Central Pennsylvania which serves as the seat 
of Pennsylvania's Lancaster County and one of the oldest inland towns in 
the United States (along with Hartford, Connecticut; Springfield, Massachusetts; 
Petersburg, Virginia; Albany, New York; Schenectady, New York, and several 
other early settlements).[1] With a population of 59,322,[2] it ranks eighth 
in population among Pennsylvania's cities.[3] The Lancaster metropolitan 
area population is 507,766,[4] making it the 101st largest metropolitan 
area in the US and 2nd largest in the South Central Pennsylvania area.[4] 
The city's primary industries include healthcare, tourism, public administration, 
manufacturing, both professional and semi-professional services, and home 
of the Park City Center shopping mall, the largest indoor retail facility 
in the region. Lancaster hosts more electronic public CCTV outdoor cameras 
per capita than cities such as Boston or San Francisco, despite controversy 
among residents.[5] Lancaster was home to James Buchanan, the nation's 
15th president,[6] and to congressman and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens.[7] 
Originally called Hickory Town, the city was renamed after the English 
city of Lancaster by native John Wright. Its symbol, the red rose, is from 
the House of Lancaster.[8] Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods 
Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It 
was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818.[9] 
During the American Revolution, Lancaster was the capital of the United 
States for one day, on September 27, 1777, after the Continental Congress 
fled Philadelphia, which had been captured by the British. The revolutionary 
government then moved still farther away to York, Pennsylvania.[10] Lancaster 
was capital of Pennsylvania from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital 
was moved to Harrisburg.[10] In 1851, the current Lancaster County Prison 
was built in the city, styled after Lancaster Castle in England. The prison 
remains in use, and was used for public hangings until 1912.[11] It replaced 
a 1737 structure on a different site. The first paved road in the United 
States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, which makes 
up part of the present-day U.S. Route 30. Opened in 1795, the Turnpike 
connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by 
a Scottish engineer named John Loudon McAdam. Lancaster residents are known 
to use the word "macadam" in lieu of pavement or asphalt.[12] This name 
is a reference to the paving process named for McAdam. The city of Lancaster 
was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the 
estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, 
is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered 
among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, 
lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical 
Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city 
was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, a renaissance man who created 
the first fully functional steamboat. All of these individuals have had 
local schools named after them. After the American Revolution, the city 
of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products 
needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: 
the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon 
was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city.[13] The 
innovative gunsmith William Henry lived in Lancaster and was a U.S. congressman 
and leader during and after the American Revolution. In 1803, Meriwether 
Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known 
surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude 
and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the Lewis 
and Clark Expedition.[14] In 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his 
first successful "five and dime" store in the city of Lancaster, the F. 
W. Woolworth Company.[13] Lancaster was one of the winning communities 
for the All-America City award in 2000.[15] On October 13, 2011, Lancaster's 
City Council officially recognized September 27 as Capital Day, a holiday 
recognizing Lancaster's one day as capital of the United States in 1777.

of Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania after Reading. For this reason, it is 
sometimes referred to as the "Spanish Rose." Lancaster celebrates its Puerto

Lancaster City has been in the process of recreating itself, particularly 
since 2010,[when?] and there has been a growth of specialty shops, boutiques, 
bars, clubs, and reinvestment in downtown institutions and locations. In 
2005 the creation of "Gallery Row" solidified the status of Lancaster as 
an arts destination. The art community continues to thrive and expand. 
There are also plans to convert an area of unused polluted industrial grounds 
(i.e., brownfields), which were once occupied by Armstrong World Industries, 
into playing fields for Franklin & Marshall College. This action is expected 
to take up most of the former industrial site. The Northwest Corridor will 
be developed with funds from Lancaster General Hospital. The hospital plans 
to create a mixed-use development which will add several city blocks to 
Lancaster’s grid. Another brownfield site is Burle Business Park, the City's 
only commercial and industrial park. Devoted to adaptive re-use, this facility 
originally opened in 1942 as a U.S. Navy electronics research, development 
and manufacturing plant that was operated by RCA. The Navy facility was 
purchased after World War II by RCA. Burle Business Park was originally 
occupied by Burle Industries, the successor company to the RCA New Products 
Division following the 1986 acquisition of RCA by General Electric Company 
(GE). The GE acquisition of RCA resulted in the divestiture of this facility 
and the electronic business, but GE retained certain environmental liabilities 
that were subdivided into a separate parcel. Burle Industries is a major 
manufacturer of vacuum tube products, including photomultiplier tubes, 
power tubes, and imaging tubes. and is the largest U.S. manufacturer of 
photomultiplier tubes. Burle Industries has completed a voluntary clean-up 
under the Pennsylvania Land Recycling Program ("Act 2").[28] In addition 
to Lancaster's boutiques, vintage shops, and art galleries (Gallery Row), 
there is the Park City Center within the City of Lancaster, Lancaster County, 
the largest enclosed shopping center in South Central Pennsylvania. The 
mall includes an excess of 150 stores and is anchored by The Bon-Ton, Boscov's, 
JCPenney, Kohl's, and Sears. Park City opened in September 1971.[29] Built 
in 1889, the Lancaster Central Market is the oldest continuously operated 
farmers market in the United States, and many tourists come to purchase 
the handmade Amish goods that are not commonly found elsewhere.[30] Central 
Market is also the center of the city's growing 'green' movement, allowing 
people to purchase organic and/or locally grown foods. Central Market is 
listed with the National Register of Historic Places, and its towers are 
of the Romanesque Revival style. The market underwent renovations beginning 
in July 2010, during which certain sections were closed off; though it 
remained in operation during this time.[31] Lancaster also has two outlet 
shopping centers, both of which are located in East Lampeter township on 
U.S. Route 30. Tanger Outlets is home to about 65 stores. Rockvale Outlets 
contains over 100 stores and restaurants as well as a Holiday Inn Express.[32] 
According to Lancaster's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[33] 
the top employers in the city are: Lancaster operates under a Mayor / Council 
form of Government. The City has a full range of services including Public 
Safety, Health, Housing, Parks, Streets & Highways, Water operations and 
Sewer operations.[34] Rick Gray is the 43rd mayor of Lancaster city. The 
City Council is composed of seven members: President Louise B. Williams, 
Patricia A. Coller, Joseph R. Morales, Nelson M. Polite, Sr., Tim J. Roschel, 
Todd E. Smith, and Jose E. Urdaneta. The Lancaster City Bureau of Fire 
has a staff of 75. The City Bureau of Fire operates out of 3 fire stations, 
located throughout the city, as well as a maintenance facility. The Bureau

as well as numerous special, support, and reserve units. The Bureau responds 
to approximately 3,250 emergency calls annually.[35] The city of Lancaster 
is protected by the City of Lancaster Bureau of Police. Founded in 1865, 
the Bureau of Police is located at 39 W. Chestnut St. in Downtown Lancaster, 
and consists of approximately 147 sworn officers and 46 civilian employees. 
The Bureau of Police operates out of twelve sectors, or districts, and 
operates in four Divisions, including Patrol, Criminal Investigative, Administrative 
Services, and Contracted Services. The Bureau also remains the largest 
law enforcement agency in Lancaster County.[36][37] Not long after a police 
officer was wounded in a February 17, 2000 daytime shootout near the center 
of Lancaster's Penn Square, community residents, law enforcement, and elected 
officials sought viable solutions to rising crime in downtown. Addressing 
issues of public safety was a goal when the Lancaster County Crime Commission 
convened in August 2000. Public meetings and discussions were held over 
a two-year period. Among the seventeen recommendations in the Crime Commission's 
2003 report was to explore the feasibility of a civilian-driven system 
of security cameras to support law enforcement and first responders. Lancaster's 
citizens did not want to have a government- or police-operated system of 
cameras. The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) organized and 
was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 
2004. Its goals included operating a video surveillance system, but it 
also developed to work on safety by design and community mobilization.[38] 
Paid LCSC staff are background-checked by the FBI and trained to monitor 
the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city of Lancaster. 
The community organization is also interested in stimulating economic development 
in downtown by creating a safe environment. In 2009, the LCSC's expansion 
from a 70 to a 165-camera network attracted national attention, including 
a front page article in the Los Angeles Times: "Lancaster, Pa., keeps a 
close eye on itself".[27][39] The article quoted city police chief Keith 
Sadler as saying, "Years ago, there's no way we could do this...It brings 
to mind Big Brother, George Orwell and 1984. It's just funny how Americans 
have softened on these issues."[27] Prior to the Los Angeles Times article, 
there had been little public opposition to the CCTV camera system. Data 
showed it had contributed to the prosecution or prevention of several crimes.[40] 
But, in response to the national coverage, a small but vocal group of opponents 
developed, who wanted to turn off the cameras, "possibly for good."[38] 
The MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann highlighted the issue in his 'Worst 
Person in the World' segment, criticizing the citizens for "spying on each 
other."[39] ABC's Nightline and CBS Evening News also covered the citizen-operated 
surveillance system.[38] Registered Democrats hold a 13,000 voter registration 
advantage over registered Republicans, as of June 2009.[41] U.S. presidential 
candidate Barack Obama easily won the city of Lancaster, receiving 76% 
of the vote during the 2008 presidential election.[42] Federally, Lancaster 
is part of Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district, represented by Republican
