Southampton, officially the Town of Southampton, is a town located in southeastern 
Suffolk County, New York, partly on the South Fork of Long Island. As of 
the 2010 United States Census, the town had a total population of 56,790. 
Southampton is included in the stretch of shoreline prominently known as 
The Hamptons. Stony Brook University's Southampton campus is located here. 
The town was founded when settlers from Lynn, Massachusetts established 
residence on lands obtained from local Shinnecock Indian Nation in 1640. 
The first settlers included eight men, one woman, and a boy who came ashore 
at Conscience Point. These men were Thomas Halsey, Edward Howell, Edmond 
Farrington, Edmund Needham, Abraham Pierson the Elder, Thomas Sayre, Josiah 
Stanborough, George Welbe, Henry Walton and Job Sayre. By July 7, 1640, 
they had determined the town boundaries. During the next few years (1640–43), 
Southampton was further increased in population by 43 families. The first 
meeting house was on a hill that is the site of the current Southampton 
Hospital. The oldest existent house in the town is the Halsey House at 
249 Main Street, which was built by Thomas Halsey, one of the first Englishmen 
to trade with the Shinnecocks.[2] Southampton has 47 public and private 
cemeteries,[3] not including Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, which is claimed 
as an Indian burial ground that is no longer in active use.[4] Southampton 
is named after the port city of Southampton in Hampshire, England. The 
Town of Southampton operates an official historical web site.[5] The site 
shows the locations of over 100 points of interest, historic markers, and 
historic districts as well as over 1500 photos. In 2005 the Shinnecock 
nation filed a lawsuit against the state seeking the return of 3,500 acres 
(14 km²) in Southampton located near the tribe’s reservation, and billions 
of dollars in reparations for damages suffered by colonial land grabs. 
The disputed property includes the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, which Shinnecock 
say is the location of tribe burial grounds. The tribe has challenged the 
state legislatures' approval of an 1859 sale of the 3500 acres of tribal 
land. This broke the terms of a 1,000-year-lease signed by Southampton 
colonial officials and the tribe in 1703. The suit charges that in 1859, 
a group of powerful New York investors conspired to break the lease by 
sending the state Legislature a fraudulent petition from a number of Shinnecock 
tribal members. Although other tribal members immediately protested that 
the petition was a forgery, the Legislature approved the sale of 3,500 
acres (14 km²) of tribal land.[6] The current town supervisor is Jay Schneiderman, 
a Democratic Party member who was elected in November 2015 with 56.34% 
of the vote. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has 
a total area of 295.6 square miles (765.6 km²), of which, 138.9 square 
miles (359.7 km²) of it is land and 156.7 square miles (405.9 km²) of it 
is water. The total area is 53.02% water. The Town of Southampton contains
