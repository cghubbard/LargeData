Gregory Allan Gibson (born October 2, 1968) is an umpire in Major League 
Baseball who has worked in the National League from 1997 to 1999 and throughout 
both major leagues since 2000. Throughout his career, he has worn the number 
53 on his uniform. Gibson has worked two Wild Card Games (2012, 2013), 
nine Division Series (2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2015), 
four National League Championship Series (2005, 2012, 2013, 2014), the 
2011 World Series, and the 2008 All-Star Game. He has also officiated in 
two World Baseball Classics (2009, 2013). Gibson was the home plate umpire 
for Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004, as well as Tim Wakefield's 
200th win.[1] Before reaching the major leagues, he umpired in the Appalachian 
League (1991), Florida Instructional League (1991 and 1994), South Atlantic 
League (1992), Florida State League (1993), Eastern League (1994–1995) 
and International League (1996–1999). During the 2005 NLCS, a series of 
contested calls brought fans and sports writers to wonder again whether 
instant replay would be a good move for Major League Baseball. For Gibson's 
part, he didn't see a ball hit off of Mark Grudzielanek's foot while he 
was still in the box, which would have been a foul ball. Instead, Grudzielanek 
grounded out to pitcher Roy Oswalt for the first out of the home half of 
second inning.[2] In the 2009 ALDS, Gibson was alleged to have ruled incorrectly 
on a baserunner coming into third base.[3] In the 12th inning of a game 
between the Minnesota Twins and the Kansas City Royals on April 24, 2010, 
Minnesota was leading 9–7 with two outs. Kansas City's Willie Bloomquist 
came to bat with baserunner Scott Podsednik on first base. Bloomquist hit 
a ground ball to shortstop J.J. Hardy, who mishandled it before throwing 
the ball to second base. Podsednik appeared to be safe, but Gibson, the 
second-base umpire, ruled him out to end the game and give the Twins a 
9-7 win. Royals manager Trey Hillman unsuccessfully disputed the call.[4] 
On Tuesday, April 17, 2012, while serving as home plate umpire, Gibson 
made a series of calls in a game between the New York Yankees and Minnesota 
Twins that were not well received by fans. First calling a balk on pitcher 
Francisco Liriano, then tossing out mild-mannered Denard Span and team 
manager Ron Gardenhire for showing disapproval of Gibson's 'strike' call 
at the beginning of the Span at-bat. Gibson's demeanor was reported by 
media as antagonistic as the fray began with Span, then remained aggressive 
as he tossed Gardenhire with great animation. [5] On August 15, 2012, Gibson 
left a game between the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Cleveland 
Indians after he was slashed near the left eye by Torii Hunter during a 
play at the plate. Hunter's cleat kicked up after a hard slide to home 
plate and kicked Gibson. Gibson was not seriously injured.[6] After his 
departure, minor league fill-in and first base umpire Manny Gonzalez assumed 
home plate umpiring duties as the crew worked in a three-person alignment 
for the remainder of the contest.[7] On September 3, 2008, Gibson was the 
home plate umpire for MLB's first use of instant replay. Gibson was chosen 
as one of the umpires for the one-game Wild Card playoff between the Baltimore 
Orioles and the Texas Rangers on October 5, 2012.[8] Gibson was the home 
plate umpire for Game 6 of the National League Championship Series on October 
18, 2013. At the start of the game, a "standoff" developed between Los 
Angeles Dodgers' first baseman Scott Van Slyke and St. Louis Cardinals' 
pitcher Joe Kelly. Both players remained on the field after the pregame 
ceremony, each waiting for the other to return to their respective dugout. 
Gibson ended the standoff by motioning both players back to their dugouts, 
with the Dodgers celebrating in their dugout after a Van Slyke victory. 
This incident was recorded in video form,[9] and was used as an outro by 
the MLB's official YouTube channel for all videos posted in 2014. The outro 
has developed into an internet meme, and Gibson has become one of the more 
well-known umpires in the league thanks to this video clip. On March 31, 
2014, Gibson became the first umpire to have a call overturned via a manager's 
challenge during a regular season game. During the sixth inning, Atlanta 
Braves skipper Fredi González successfully contested Gibson's ruling that 
Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun was safe at first base.[10] On 
June 18, 2014, Gibson was the home plate umpire when Los Angeles Dodgers
