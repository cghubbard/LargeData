George Alexander Selkirk (January 4, 1908 – January 19, 1987) was a Canadian 
outfielder and front office executive in Major League Baseball. In 1935, 
Selkirk succeeded Babe Ruth as the right fielder of the New York Yankees—and 
also inherited Ruth's fabled No. 3 uniform (which was not retired until 
1948, the year of Ruth's death). Over the next eight seasons, Selkirk batted 
over .300 five times, twice drove home more than 100 RBIs, played on five 
World Championship teams (1936, 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1941), and made the 
American League All-Star team in 1936 and 1939. George Selkirk was inducted 
into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983, its initial year, and 
was later inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.[1] A native 
of Huntsville, Ontario, Selkirk batted left-handed and threw right-handed, 
standing 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighing 182 pounds (83 kg) (13 
stone). He earned the nickname "Twinkletoes" for his distinctive way of 
running on the balls of his feet. During his nine years of Major League 
Baseball service, all with the Yankees, he appeared in 846 games and hit 
.290 (.265 in 21 World Series games), with 108 regular-season home runs 
and 810 hits. After military service in World War II (in the United States 
Navy, despite his Canadian citizenship), Selkirk managed at the Class A 
and Triple-A levels for the Yankees, and at Triple-A in the farm system 
of the Milwaukee Braves. He then worked as the player personnel director 
for the Kansas City Athletics (1957–59) and field coordinator of player 
development of the Baltimore Orioles (1960–62) before becoming the second 
general manager in the history of the second Washington Senators club (now 
the Texas Rangers) in the autumn of 1962. The Senators were chronically 
short of funds and never developed a strong farm system, forcing Selkirk 
to acquire players (such as the great slugger Frank Howard) through trades 
and fill out the roster with waiver-price acquisitions. Nonetheless, Washington 
improved every year from 1963 through 1967, but when the team's field manager, 
Gil Hodges, departed for the New York Mets after the '67 campaign, the 
Senators regressed and fell back into the American League basement. The 
death of one of the club's owners forced the sale of the team in the autumn 
of 1968, and Selkirk was fired during the transition. He then returned 
to the Yankees as a scout. George Selkirk died at age 79 in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida. His successful career as a player, and the respect he earned as 
a general manager, earned Selkirk a place in the Canadian Baseball Hall 
of Fame. He was, arguably, the greatest Canadian-born baseball player of 
the first half of the 20th century. Selkirk is mentioned in August Wilson's 
1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning play, "Fences." The protagonist, Troy, confident 
that he can do better than white ballplayers in the majors, alludes to
