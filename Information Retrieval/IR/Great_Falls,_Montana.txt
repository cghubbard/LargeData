Great Falls is a city in and the county seat of Cascade County, Montana, 
United States.[4] The 2015 census estimate put the population at 59,638.[3] 
The population was 58,505 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city 
of the Great Falls, Montana Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses 
all of Cascade County and has a population of 82,278.[5] Great Falls was 
the largest city in Montana from 1950 to 1970, when Billings surpassed 
it. Great Falls remained the second largest city in Montana until 2000, 
when it was passed by Missoula.[6] Since then Great Falls has been the 
third largest city in the state.[7] Great Falls takes its name from the 
series of five waterfalls in close proximity along the upper Missouri River 
basin that the Lewis and Clark Expedition had to portage around over a 
ten-mile stretch; the effort required 31 days of arduous labor during the 
westward leg of their 1805-06 exploration of the Louisiana Purchase and 
to the Pacific Northwest Coast of the Oregon Country. Each falls sports 
a hydroelectric dam today, hence Great Falls is nicknamed "the Electric 
City". Currently there are two undeveloped parts of their portage route; 
these are included within the Great Falls Portage, a National Historic 
Landmark. The city is home to the C. M. Russell Museum Complex, the University 
of Great Falls, Great Falls College Montana State University, Giant Springs, 
the Roe River (claimed to be the world's shortest river), the Montana School 
for the Deaf and the Blind, the Great Falls Voyagers minor league baseball 
(formerly known as the Great Falls White Sox and before that as the Dodgers 
and Giants respectively) team, and Malmstrom Air Force Base. The local 
newspaper is the Great Falls Tribune. A Coldwell Banker Home Price Comparison 
Index listed Great Falls as the most affordable area of 348 markets in 
the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The first human beings to live in the 
Great Falls area were Paleo-Indians who migrated into the region between 
9,500 BCE and 8,270 BCE.[8][9] The earliest inhabitants of North America 
entered Montana east of the Continental Divide between the mountains and 
the Laurentide ice sheet.[10] The area remained only sparsely inhabited, 
however.[11] Salish Indians would often hunt bison in the region on a seasonal 
basis, but no permanent settlements existed at or near Great Falls for 
much of prehistory.[11] Around 1600, Piegan Blackfeet Indians, migrating 
west, entered the area, pushing the Salish back into the Rocky Mountains 
and claiming the site now known as Great Falls as their own.[11] The Great 
Falls location remained the tribal territory of the Blackfeet until long 
after the United States claimed the region in 1803.[12][13] Meriwether 
Lewis was the first white person to visit the area, which he did on June 
13, 1805, as part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[14][15] York, an African 
American slave owned by William Clark and who had participated in the Expedition, 
was the first black American to visit the site of the future city.[16] 
Following the return passage of Lewis and Clark in 1806,[17] there is no 
record of any white person visiting the site of the city of Great Falls 
until explorer and trapper Jim Bridger reached the area in 1822.[12] Bridger 
and Major Andrew Henry led a fur-trading expedition to the future city 
location in April 1823 (and were attacked by Blackfeet Indians while camping 
at the site).[18] British explorer Alexander Ross trapped around Great 
Falls in 1824.[19] In 1838, a mapping expedition sent by the U.S. federal 
government and guided by Bridger spent four years in the area.[12] Margaret 
Harkness Woodman became the first white woman to visit the Great Falls 
area in 1862.[20] The Great Falls of the Missouri River marked the limit 
of the navigable section of the Missouri River for non-portagable watercraft,[21] 
and the non-navigability of the falls was noted by the U.S. Supreme Court 
in its 2012 ruling against the State of Montana on the question of streambed 
ownership beneath several dams situated at the site of the falls.[22] The 
first steamboat arrived at future site of the city in 1859.[23] Politically, 
the future site of Great Falls passed through numerous hands in the 19th 
century. It was part of the unincorporated frontier until May 30, 1854, 
when Congress established the Nebraska Territory.[24] Indian attacks on 
white explorers and settlers dropped significantly after Isaac Stevens 
negotiated the Treaty of Hellgate in 1855, and white settlement in the 
area began to occur.[12] On March 2, 1861, the site became part of the 
Dakota Territory.[25] The Great Falls area was incorporated into the Idaho 
Territory on March 4, 1863,[26] and then into the Montana Territory on 
May 28, 1864.[11] It became part of the state of Montana upon that territory's 
admission to statehood on November 8, 1889.[11] Great Falls was founded 
in 1883. Businessman Paris Gibson visited the Great Falls of the Missouri 
River in 1880, and was deeply impressed by the possibilities for building 
a major industrial city near the falls with power provided by hydroelectricity.[27][28][29][30] 
He returned in 1883 with friend Robert Vaughn and some surveyors and platted 
a permanent settlement the south side of the river.[12][27][28] The city's 
first citizen, Silas Beachley, arrived later that year.[12] With investments 
from railroad owner James J. Hill and Helena businessman Charles Arthur 
Broadwater, houses, a store, and a flour mill were established in 1884.[12][27][28][29][30] 
The Great Falls post office was established on July 10, 1884, and Paris 
Gibson was named the first postmaster.[31] A planing mill, lumber yard, 
bank, school, and newspaper were established in 1885.[27][30] By 1887 the 
town had 1,200 citizens, and in October of that year the Great Northern 
Railway arrived in the city.[27][29][30] Great Falls was incorporated on 
November 28, 1888. Black Eagle Dam was built in 1890, and by 1912 Rainbow 
Dam and Volta Dam (now Ryan Dam) were all operating.[12][27][30] Great 
Falls quickly became a thriving industrial and supply center and, by the 
early 1900s, was en route to becoming one of Montana's largest cities. 
The rustic studio of famed Western artist Charles Marion Russell was a 
popular attraction, as were the famed "Great Falls of the Missouri", after 
which the city was named. A structure billed as the "world's tallest smokestack" 
was completed in 1908 by the city's largest employer, the Anaconda Copper 
Mining Company's smelter, measuring 508 feet (155 m) tall. The Big Stack 
immediately became a landmark for the community. The Big Stack's 'sister' 
stack in Anaconda was suffering from cracking and it was decided to remove 
the support bands from the upper half of the Big Stack and send them to 
Anaconda. This action proved to be the Big Stack's ultimate demise since 
the cracks it suffered from rapidly worsened. Citing public safety concerns 
due to the stack's continual deterioration of its structural integrity 
it was slated for demolition on September 18, 1982. In an interesting twist 
of fate the demolition crew failed to accomplish the task on the first 
try; the two worst cracks in the stack ran from just above ground level 
to nearly 300 feet up. As the 600 lbs of explosives were set off (which 
was to create a wedge in the base so it would fall almost vertically into 
a large trench for the rubble) the cracks 'completed themselves' all the 
way to the ground—effectively severing the stack into two-thirds and one-third 
pieces. Much to the delight of the spectating community, the smaller of 
the two pieces remained standing, but the failed demolition only solidified 
the safety issue whereas the community cited the event as the stack's defiance. 
The demolition team who had planted the charges was recalled and several 
hours later they returned and finished the demolition, after packing another 
400 lbs of explosives into the smaller wedge. During World War II the Northwest 
Staging Route passed through the city on which planes were delivered to 
the USSR according to the Lend-Lease program. Great Falls prospered further 
with the opening of a nearby military base in the 1940s, but as rail transportation 
and freight slowed in the later part of the century, outlying farming areas 
lost population, and with the closure of the smelter and cutbacks at Malmstrom 
Air Force Base in the 1980s, its population growth slowed. The economy 
of Great Falls has suffered from the decline of heartland industry in recent 
years much like other cities in the Great Plains and Midwest. Great Falls 
is located at 47°30′13″N 111°17′11″W﻿ / ﻿47.50361°N 111.28639°W﻿ / 47.50361; 
-111.28639 (47.503657, −111.286299),[32] near several waterfalls on the 
Missouri River. It lies near the center of Montana on the northern Great 
Plains. It lies next to the Rocky Mountain Front and is about 100 miles 
(160 km) south of the Canada–US border. The city of Great Falls lies atop 
the Great Falls Tectonic Zone, an intracontinental shear zone between two 
geologic provinces of basement rock of the Archean period which form part 
of the North American continent.[33] The city lies at the southern reach 
of the Laurentide ice sheet, a vast glacial sheet of ice which covered 
much of North America during the last glacial period. Approximately 1.5 
million years ago, the Missouri River flowed northward into a terminal 
lake.[34][35] The Laurentide ice sheet pushed the river southward.[34][36] 
Between 15,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE, the Laurentide ice sheet blocked the 
Missouri River and created Glacial Lake Great Falls.[8][36][37] About 13,000 
BCE, as the glacier retreated, Glacial Lake Great Falls emptied catastrophically 
in a glacial lake outburst flood.[8] The current course of the Missouri 
River essentially marks the southern boundary of the Laurentide ice sheet.[38] 
The Missouri River flowed eastward around the glacial mass, settling into 
its present course.[34] As the ice retreated, meltwater from Glacial Lake 
Great Falls poured through the Highwood Mountains and eroded the mile-long, 
500-foot-deep (150 m) Shonkin Sag—one of the most famous prehistoric meltwater 
channels in the world.[39] Great Falls is also situated on a fall line 
unconformity in the Great Falls Tectonic Zone,[40] as well as atop the 
Kootenai Formation, a mostly nonmarine sandstone laid down by rivers, glaciers, 
and lakes in the past.[41][42] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 22.26 square miles (57.65 km2), of which, 
21.79 square miles (56.44 km2) is land and 0.47 square miles (1.22 km2) 
is water.[1] Great Falls has a cold semi-arid climate Köppen climate classification 
(BSk), with a notable amount of summer precipitation occurring in the form 
of thunderstorms. Winters are very cold, long and often snowy, though periods 
of chinook winds do cause warm spells and raise the maximum temperature 
above 50 °F (10 °C) on an average of twelve days[dubious – discuss] during 
three months of 2015-2016[43][not in citation given][dubious – discuss] 
In the absence of such winds, shallow cold snaps are common; there is an 
average of 20.8 nights with a low of 0 °F (−17.8 °C) or colder and 44 days 
failing to top freezing. The wettest part of the year is the spring. Summers 
are hot and dry, with highs reaching 90 °F (32.2 °C) on nineteen days per 
year, though the diurnal temperature variation is large and easily exceeds 
30 °F (16.7 °C).[44] Freak early and late summer snowfalls such as a two-day 
total of 8.3 in (21.1 cm) in August 1992 can occur, although the median 
snowfall from June to September is zero and on average the window for accumulating 
(0.1 in or 0.25 cm) snowfall is October 2 thru May 13.[44] The average 
first and last freeze dates are September 21 and May 21, respectively, 
allowing a growing season of 122 days, although, excepting for July, a 
freeze has occurred in every month of the year. Extreme temperatures range 
from −49 °F (−45.0 °C) on February 15, 1936 to 107 °F (41.7 °C) on July 
25, 1933. As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 58,505 people, 25,301

Operations Group provides the forces to launch, monitor and secure the 
wing's Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and missile alert facilities 
(MAF). These ICBMs and MAFs are dispersed over the largest missile complex 
in the Western Hemisphere, an area encompassing some 23,000 sq mi (60,000 km2) 
(approximately the size of the state of West Virginia). The group manages 
a variety of equipment, facilities, and vehicles worth more than $5 billion. 
Great Falls International Airport is home to the Montana Air National Guard's 
120th Airlift Wing. The 120AW is composed of C-130 Hercules (C-130H) cargo 
aircraft and associated support personnel. Great Falls is also home to 
the 889th Army Reserve Unit. The 819th Red Horse rapid deployment unit 
is also located on Malmstrom AFB Great Falls has a symphony orchestra, 
founded in 1959, which generally offers multiple concert series throughout

James Galway, Christopher Parkening and Evelyn Glennie.[51] The community 
also is notable for the unique Sip 'n Dip Lounge, a tiki bar located downtown 
in the O'Haire Motor Inn. Built in 1962, it features an indoor swimming 
pool visible through a window in the bar where women dressed as "mermaids" 
swim underwater. In 2003, GQ Magazine rated the lounge as one of the top 
10 bars in the world,[52] and the #1 bar in the world "worth flying for".[53] 
With the added feature of an octogenarian piano player named "Piano Pat," 
noted for her "unusual covers" of songs by Frank Sinatra and other performers 
of the 1960s, Frommer's travel guide calls it "one of the kitschiest, wackiest, 
and flat-out coolest nightspots, not just in Montana, but in the entire 
West."[54] The Four Seasons Arena is a multi-purpose indoor sports and 
exhibition arena located in the city of Great Falls, Montana, in the United 
States. Constructed in 1979, it served primarily as an ice rink until 2005. 
The failure of the practice rink's refrigeration system in 2003 and the 
management's decision to close the main rink in 2006 led to the facility's 
reconfiguration as an indoor sports and exhibition space. As of May 2011 
it is the largest exhibition, music, and sports venue in the city. For 
the 1979–80 WHL season, Great Falls and the Four Seasons Arena was the 
home of the Great Falls Americans hockey team (see below). The team was 
2-25 before folding. Great Falls has a rich baseball history with the Voyagers. 
Formerly called the White Sox, Dodgers and Giants, baseball players such 
as Pedro Martínez, José Offerman, and Raúl Mondesí have spent time in Great 
Falls with the team. Since 1988, the team has won the Pioneer League championship

Ex Express provide service to the city with mainline (large) jet aircraft. 
Numerous motion pictures have been filmed in and around Great Falls, Montana. 
These movies include: The Mariana UFO Incident occurred in August 1950 
in Great Falls. Nicholas "Nick" Mariana, the general manager of the Great 
Falls "Electrics" minor-league baseball team, and his secretary observed 
two "bright, silvery spheres" move rapidly over the city's empty baseball 
stadium. Mariana used his camera to film the objects; the film was one 
of the first ever taken of a suspected UFO. The incident received widespread 
national publicity and is regarded as one of the first great UFO incidents 
in the United States. In 2007, the Great Falls White Sox were renamed as 
the Great Falls Voyagers to commemorate this event. The team logo features 
a green alien in a flying saucer. Great Falls has one sister city, as designated 
by Sister Cities International (SCI): Great Falls travel guide from Wikivoyage
