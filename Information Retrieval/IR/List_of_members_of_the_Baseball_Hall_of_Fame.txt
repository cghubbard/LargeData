The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York 
honors individuals who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving 
the sport, and is the central point for the study of the history of baseball 
in the United States and beyond, displaying baseball-related artifacts 
and exhibits. Elections of worthy individuals to be honored by induction 
into the hall of fame commenced in 1936, although the first induction ceremonies 
were not held until the hall opened in 1939.[1] Through the elections for 
2016, a total of 312 people have been inducted, including 217 former major 
league players, 28 executives, 35 Negro League players and executives, 
22 managers, and 10 umpires. Each is listed showing his primary position; 
that is, the position or role in which the player made his greatest contribution 
to baseball according to the Hall of Fame. According to the current rules, 
players must have at least 10 years of major league experience to be eligible 
for induction. In addition, they must be retired for at least five years 
if living, or deceased for at least six months. Players meeting these qualifications 
must pass through a screening committee, and are then voted on by the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Each writer may vote for up to 
10 players; to be admitted into the Hall of Fame, a player must be approved 
by 75% of those casting ballots.[2] Players receiving less than 5% approval 
are removed from future BBWAA ballots.[1] The rules, as revised in July 
2016, allow that all individuals eligible for induction but not for the 
BBWAA ballot—players who have not been approved by the BBWAA election process 
within 15 years of their retirement, umpires, managers, pioneers, and executives—may 
be considered by one of four voting bodies that have taken over the role 
of the former Veterans Committee, based on the era in which each individual 
candidate made his greatest contribution to the sport.[3] On a few occasions, 
exceptions have been made to the guidelines in place at the time: Lou Gehrig 
was elected in 1939 following his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;[1] 
Roberto Clemente was elected shortly after his death in 1972; and Addie 
Joss was elected in 1978 even though he completed only nine seasons before 
his death.[4] Between 1971 and 1977, nine players from the Negro Leagues 
were inducted by a special Negro Leagues Committee, which was given the 
task of identifying worthy players who played in the Negro Leagues prior 
to the breaking of baseball's color line. Since 1977, players from the 
Negro Leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine 
more individuals have been approved by that body.[5] In 2005, the Hall 
announced the formation of a Committee on African-American Baseball, which 
held a 2006 election for eligible figures from the Negro Leagues and earlier 
19th-century teams;[6] 17 additional Negro League figures were chosen in 
that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.[7]

on the inductee's Hall of Fame plaque (if applicable; those inducted as 
executives are shown without caps, and many early players are depicted
