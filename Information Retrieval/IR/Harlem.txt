/ 40.8090333; -73.9483722 Harlem is a large neighborhood in the northern 
section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Since the 1920s, Harlem 
has been known as a major African-American residential, cultural and business 
center. Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658,[5] it is 
named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has 
been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant 
population shifts accompanying each cycle.[6] African-American residents 
began to arrive en masse in 1905, with numbers fed by the Great Migration. 
In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem were the focus of the "Harlem 
Renaissance", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American 
black community. However, with job losses in the time of the Great Depression 
and the deindustrialization of New York City after World War II, rates 
of crime and poverty increased significantly. Harlem's African-American 
population peaked in the 1950s.[7] In 2008, the United States Census found 
that for the first time since the 1930s, less than half of residents were 
black, and black residents only counted for 40% of the population.[7] Since 
New York City's revival in the late 20th century, long-time residents of 
Harlem have been experiencing the effects of gentrification and new wealth. 
Harlem is located in Upper Manhattan, often referred to as Uptown by locals. 
It stretches from the East River in the east, to the Hudson River to the 
west; and between 155th Street in the north, where it meets Washington 
Heights, and an uneven boundary along the south that runs along either 
96th Street east of Fifth Avenue or 110th Street west of Fifth Avenue. 
Central Harlem is bounded by Fifth Avenue on the east, Central Park on 
the south, Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Avenue and Edgecombe Avenue on 
the west, and the Harlem River on the north.[8] A chain of three large 
linear parks—Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park and Jackie Robinson Park—are 
situated on steeply rising banks and form most of the district's western 
boundary. On the east, Fifth Avenue and Marcus Garvey Park, also known 
as Mount Morris Park, separate this area from East Harlem. The bulk of 
the area falls under Manhattan Community Board No. 10.[2] In the late 2000s, 
South Harlem, emerged from area redevelopment, running along Frederick 
Douglass Boulevard from West 110th to West 138th Streets.[9][10] The West 
Harlem neighborhoods of Manhattanville and Hamilton Heights comprise part 
of Manhattan Community Board No. 9. The two neighborhoods' area is bounded 
by Cathedral Parkway (110th Street) on the South; 155th Street on the North; 
Manhattan/Morningside Ave/St. Nicholas/Bradhurst/Edgecome Avenues on the 
East; and Riverside Park/the Hudson River on the west. Morningside Heights 
is located in the southern most section of West Harlem. Manhattanville 
begins at roughly 123rd Street and extends northward to 135th Street. The 
northern most section of West Harlem is Hamilton Heights.[3] East Harlem, 
also called Spanish Harlem, within Manhattan Community Board 11, is bounded 
by East 96th Street on the south, East 142nd Street on the north, Fifth 
Avenue on the west, and the Harlem River on the east.[4] The New York City 
Police Department patrols six precincts located within Harlem. The areas 
of West Harlem are served by the 30th Precinct,[11] and the 26th Precinct,[12] 
the areas of Central Harlem are served by the 28th[13] and 32nd Precincts,[14] 
and the areas of East Harlem are served by the 23rd[15] and 25th Precincts.[16] 
The New York City Fire Department operates 9 firehouses in Harlem, organized 
into 2 Battalions. The following fire companies are quartered in Harlem: 
Engine 35, Engine 37, Engine 47, Engine 58, Engine 59, Engine 69, Engine 
80, Engine 84, Engine 91, Ladder 14, Ladder 23, Ladder 26, Ladder 28, Ladder 
30, Ladder 34, Ladder 40, and the Chiefs of the 12th and 16th Battalions. 
Harlem is represented by New York's 13th congressional district, the New 
York State Senate's 30th district, the New York State Assembly's 68th and 
70th districts, and the New York City Council's 7th, 8th, and 9th districts. 
Before the arrival of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem 
(originally Haarlem) was inhabited by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who 
along with other Native Americans, most likely Lenape[17] occupied the 
area on a semi-nomadic basis. As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem 
flatlands.[18] Between 1637 and 1639, a few settlements were established.[19][20] 
During the American Revolution, the British burned Harlem to the ground.[21] 
It took a long time to rebuild, as Harlem grew more slowly than the rest 
of Manhattan during the late 18th century.[22] After the American Civil 
War, Harlem experienced an economic boom starting in 1868. The neighborhood 
continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those 
coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian.[23] The Metro-North Railroad,[24] 
as well as the Interborough Rapid Transit and elevated railway lines,[25] 
helped Harlem's economic growth, as they connected Harlem to lower and 
midtown Manhattan. The Jewish and Italian demographic decreased, while 
the black and Puerto Rican population increased in this time.[26] The early 
20th-century Great Migration of blacks to northern industrial cities was 
fueled by their desire to leave behind the Jim Crow South, seek better 
jobs and education for their children, and escape a culture of lynching 
violence; during World War I, expanding industries recruited black laborers 
to fill new jobs, thinly staffed after the draft began to take young men.[27] 
In 1910, Central Harlem was about 10% black. By 1930, it had reached 70%.[28] 
Starting around the time of the end of World War I, Harlem became associated 
with the New Negro movement, and then the artistic outpouring known as 
the Harlem Renaissance, which extended to poetry, novels, theater, and 
the visual arts. So many blacks came that it "threaten[ed] the very existence 
of some of the leading industries of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama."[29] 
Many settled in Harlem. By 1920, central Harlem was 32.43% black. The 1930 
census revealed that 70.18% of Central Harlem's residents were black and 
lived as far south as Central Park, at 110th Street.[30] However, by the 
1930s, the neighborhood was hit hard by job losses in the Great Depression. 
In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment 
prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black 
New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic 
service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic 
groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 
1950. Several riots happened in this period, including in 1935 and 1943. 
There were major changes following World War II. In the late 1950s and 
early 1960s, Harlem was the scene of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood 
tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of 
Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other 
groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords to improve the 
quality of housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against 
rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices 
in line with existing rent control regulations.[31] The largest public 
works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest 
concentration built in East Harlem.[32] Typically, existing structures 
were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that 
would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those 
available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted 
the construction of new projects.[33] From the mid-20th century, the terrible 
quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, 
about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, 
and 80% tested under grade level in math.[34] In 1964, residents of Harlem 
staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central 
Harlem, 92% of students stayed home.[35] In the post-World War II era, 
Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks,[36] but it 
remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly 
black America.[37][38] By the 1970s, many of those Harlemites who were 
able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of safer streets, 
better schools and homes. Those who remained were the poorest and least 
skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the federal 
government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, health 
care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects 
over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement.[39] The city began 
auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 
1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in 
the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, 
the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling 
it (by lottery) below market value.[40] After the 1990s, Harlem began to 
grow again. Between 1990 and 2006 the neighborhood's population grew by 
16.9%, with the percentage of blacks decreasing from 87.6% to 69.3%,[30] 
then dropping to 54.4% by 2010,[41] and the percentage of whites increasing 
from 1.5% to 6.6% by 2006,[30] and to "almost 10%" by 2010.[41] A renovation 
of 125th Street and new properties along the thoroughfare[42][43] also 
helped to revitalize Harlem.[44] In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West 
Harlem was the focus of the "Harlem Renaissance", an outpouring of artistic 
work without precedent in the American Black community. Though Harlem musicians 
and writers are particularly well remembered, the community has also hosted 
numerous actors and theater companies, including the New Heritage Repertory 
Theater,[45] National Black Theater, Lafayette Players, Harlem Suitcase 
Theater, The Negro Playwrights, American Negro Theater, and the Rose McClendon 
Players.[46] The Apollo Theater opened on 125th Street on January 26, 1934, 
in a former burlesque house. The Savoy Ballroom, on Lenox Avenue, was a 
renowned venue for swing dancing, and was immortalized in a popular song 
of the era, "Stompin' At The Savoy". In the 1920s and 1930s, between Lenox 
and Seventh Avenues in central Harlem, over 125 entertainment places operated, 
including speakeasies, cellars, lounges, cafes, taverns, supper clubs, 
rib joints, theaters, dance halls, and bars and grills.[47] 133rd Street, 
known as "Swing Street", became known for its cabarets, speakeasies and 
jazz scene during the Prohibition era, and was dubbed "Jungle Alley" because 
of "inter-racial mingling" on the street.[48][49] Some jazz venues, including 
the Cotton Club, where Duke Ellington played, and Connie's Inn, were restricted 
to whites only. Others were integrated, including the Renaissance Ballroom 
and the Savoy Ballroom. In 1936, Orson Welles produced his black Macbeth 
at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem.[50] Grand theaters from the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries were torn down or converted to churches. Harlem 
lacked any permanent performance space until the creation of the Gatehouse 
Theater in an old Croton aqueduct building on 135th Street in 2006.[51] 
From 1965 until 2007, the community was home to the Harlem Boys Choir, 
a touring choir and education program for young boys, most of whom are 
black.[52] The Girls Choir of Harlem was founded in 1989, and closed with 
the Boys Choir.[53] Harlem is also home to the largest African American 
Day Parade which celebrates the culture of African diaspora in America. 
The parade was started up in the spring of 1969 with Congressman Adam Clayton 
Powell, Jr. as the Grand Marshal of the first celebration.[54] Arthur Mitchell, 
a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, established Dance Theatre 
of Harlem as a school and company of classical ballet and theater training 
in the late 1960s. The company has toured nationally and internationally. 
Generations of theater artists have gotten a start at the school. Manhattan's 
contributions to hip-hop stems largely from artists with Harlem roots such 
as Big L, Kurtis Blow and Immortal Technique. Harlem is also the birthplace 
of popular hip-hop dances such as the Harlem shake, toe wop, and Chicken 
Noodle Soup. Harlem is currently experiencing a gourmet renaissance with 
new dining hotspots popping up uptown around Frederick Douglass Boulevard.[55] 
At the same time, some residents are fighting back against the powerful 
waves of gentrification the neighborhood is experiencing. On October 17, 
2013, residents staged a sidewalk sit-in to protest a five-days-a-week 
farmers market that would shut down Macombs Place at 150th Street.[56] 
Religious life has historically had a strong presence in Black Harlem. 
The area is home to over 400 churches.[57] Major Christian denominations 
include Baptists, Pentecostals, Methodists (generally African Methodist 
Episcopalian, or "AME"), Episcopalians, and Roman Catholic. The Abyssinian 
Baptist Church has long been influential because of its large congregation, 
and recently wealthy on account of its extensive real estate holdings. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built a chapel on 128th 
Street in 2005. Previously the Church had had a branch meeting around the 
corner in a former Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall. As of 2015 there are 
3 LDS Wards meeting at the Harlem Chapel. Many of the area's churches are 
"storefront churches", which operate in an empty store, or a basement, 
or a converted brownstone townhouse. These congregations may have fewer 
than 30–50 members each, but there are hundreds of them.[58] Others are 
old, large, and designated landmarks. Especially in the years before World 
War II, Harlem produced popular Christian charismatic "cult" leaders, including 
George Wilson Becton and Father Divine.[59] Mosques in Harlem include the 
Malcolm Shabazz Mosque No. 7 (formerly Mosque No. 7 Nation of Islam, and 
the location of the 1972 Harlem Mosque incident), the Mosque of Islamic 
Brotherhood and Masjid Aqsa. Judaism, too, maintains a presence in Harlem 
through the Old Broadway Synagogue. A non-mainstream synagogue of black 
Jews known as Commandment Keepers, was based in a synagogue at 1 West 123rd 
Street until 2008. Many places in Harlem are New York City Landmarks, listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places, or are otherwise prominent: 
Like most neighborhoods in New York, the demographics of Harlem's communities 
have changed rapidly throughout the history of New York. In 1910, 10% of 
Harlem's population was black but by 1930, they had become a 70% majority.[7] 
The period between 1910 and 1930 marks a huge point in the great migration 
of African Americans from the South to New York. This point also marks 
an influx from downtown Manhattan neighborhoods where blacks were feeling 
less welcome, to the Harlem area.[7] The black population in Harlem peaked 
in 1950 with a 98% share of the population (population 233,000). As of 
2000, Central Harlem had a black community comprising 77% of the population; 
however, the majority of African Americans moved out as more and more immigrants 
began to move in.[64] Central Harlem is the most famous section of Harlem 
and thus is commonly referred to simply as Harlem. Central Harlem is home 
to the famous Apollo Theater. In 2010, the population of Central Harlem 
was at 115,000 according to a regional census.[65] Central Harlem is home 
to the Mount Morris Park neighborhood. In 2010, the population of West 
Harlem was at 110,193 according to a regional census.[66] West Harlem, 
consisting of Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Hamilton Heights, 
as a whole is predominately Hispanic. African Americans make up about a 
quarter of the West Harlem population.[3] However, Morningside Heights 
has a large number of White Americans.[67] Morningside Heights is known 
as the "Academic Acropolis of New York". Educational institutions in the 
neighborhood include The City College Of New York, Columbia University, 
Barnard College, and New York Theological Seminary. In 2010, the population 
of East Harlem was at 120,000.[68] East Harlem originally formed as a predominately 
Italian American neighborhood, but its demographics have changed over the 
years. and it is now known as a predominately Hispanic neighborhood. Italian 
Harlem formed when Southern Italian immigration began in the late 19th 
century.[69] Italian Harlem is notable as the founding location of the 
Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated Italian 
organized crime in New York City as part of the Mafia (or Cosa Nostra).[70] 
The area began its transition from Italian Harlem to Spanish Harlem when 
Puerto Rican migration began after World War II.[71] This community of 
stateside Puerto Ricans is notable for its contributions to Salsa music. 
In recent decades, many Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants have also settled 
in East Harlem.[72] East Harlem is also known as El Barrio and today is 
predominantly Hispanic, though with a significant Black presence.[71] The 
area suffers from the highest violent crime rate in Manhattan.[73] Harlem 
suffers from unemployment rates higher than the New York average (generally 
more than twice as high)[74] and high mortality rates as well. In both 
cases, the numbers for men have been consistently worse than the numbers 
for women. Unemployment and poverty in the neighborhood resisted private 
and governmental initiatives to ameliorate them. During the Great Depression, 
unemployment in Harlem went past twenty percent and people were being evicted 
from their homes.[75] In the 1960s, uneducated blacks could find jobs more 
easily than educated ones could, confounding efforts to improve the lives 
of people who lived in the neighborhood through education.[76] Land owners 
took advantage of the neighborhood and offered apartments to the lower-class 
families for cheaper rent but in lower class conditions.[77] As of 1999, 
179,000 housing units were available for the citizens of Harlem.[78] Housing 
activists in Harlem state that, even after residents were given vouchers 
for the Section 8 housing that was being placed, many were not able to 
live there and had to find homes elsewhere or become homeless.[78] Infant 
mortality was 124 per thousand in 1928 (12.4%) .[79] By 1940, infant mortality 
in Harlem was 5% (one infant in 20 would die), and the death rate from 
disease generally was twice that of the rest of New York. Tuberculosis 
was the main killer, and four times as prevalent among Harlem citizens 
than among the rest of New York's population.[79] A 1990 study of life 
expectancy of teenagers in Harlem reported that 15-year-old women in Harlem 
had a 65% chance of surviving to age 65, about the same as women in India. 
Fifteen-year-old men in Harlem, on the other hand, had a 37% chance of 
surviving to age 65, about the same as men in Angola.[80] Infectious diseases 
and diseases of the circulatory system were to blame, with a variety of 
contributing factors, including consumption of the deep-fried foods traditional 
to the South, which may contribute to heart disease. In the early 20th 
century, Harlem was a stronghold of the Italian Mafia. As the ethnic composition 
of the neighborhood changed, black criminals began to organize themselves 
similarly. However, rather than compete with the established mobs, gangs 
concentrated on the "policy racket", also called the numbers game, or bolita 
in East Harlem. This was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could 
be played, illegally, from countless locations around Harlem. According 
to Francis Ianni, "By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, 
several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city 
blocks and across three or four avenues."[81] By the early 1950s, the total 
money at play amounted to billions of dollars, and the police force had 
been thoroughly corrupted by bribes from numbers bosses.[82] These bosses 
became financial powerhouses, providing capital for loans for those who 
could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions, and 
investing in legitimate businesses and real estate. One of the powerful 
early numbers bosses was a woman, Madame Stephanie St. Clair. The popularity 
of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the state lottery, 
which has higher payouts and is legal. The practice continues on a smaller 
scale among those who prefer the numbers tradition or who prefer to trust 
their local numbers bank to the state. Statistics from 1940 show about 
100 murders per year in Harlem, "but rape is very rare".[83] By 1950, essentially 
all of the whites had left Harlem and by 1960, much of the black middle 
class had departed. At the same time, control of organized crime shifted 
from Jewish and Italian syndicates to local black, Puerto Rican, and Cuban 
groups that were somewhat less formally organized.[81] At the time of the 
1964 riots, the drug addiction rate in Harlem was ten times higher than 
the New York City average, and twelve times higher than the United States 
as a whole. Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York 
City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. Property crime was pervasive, and 
the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the 
children in Harlem grew up with one parent, or none, and lack of supervision 
contributed to juvenile delinquency; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate 
among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 
50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.[84] Injecting heroin 
grew in popularity in Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s, though the use 
of this drug then leveled off. In the 1980s, use of crack cocaine became 
widespread, which produced collateral crime as addicts stole to finance 
their purchasing of additional drugs, and as dealers fought for the right 
to sell in particular regions, or over deals gone bad.[85] With the end 
of the "crack wars" in the mid-1990s and with the initiation of aggressive 
policing under mayors David Dinkins and subsequently Rudolph Giuliani, 
crime in Harlem plummeted. In 1981, 6,500 robberies were reported in Harlem; 
robberies dropped to 4,800 in 1990 during David Dinkins' mayoralty.[citation 
needed] By 2000, only 1,700 robberies were reported, and by 2010, only 
1,100 were reported. There have been similar changes in all categories 
of crimes tracked by the New York City Police Department.[86] In the 32nd 
Precinct, which services Central Harlem above 127th Street, for example, 
between 1990 and 2013, the murder rate dropped 89.4%, the rape rate dropped 
67.5%, the robbery rate dropped 74.2%, burglary dropped 93.4%, and the 
total number of crime complaints dropped 77.6%.[87] In 1977, Isiah Robinson, 
president of the New York City Board of Education, was quoted as saying 
that "the quality of education in Harlem has degenerated to the level of 
a custodial service."[45] Currently the New York City Department of Education 
operates district public schools. As of May 2006[update], Harlem was the 
heart of the charter schools movement in Manhattan; of the 25 charter schools 
operating in Manhattan, 18 were in Harlem.[88] In 2010, about one age-eligible 
Harlem child in five was enrolled in charter schools.[89] The New York 
Public Library operates the Harlem Branch Library at 9 West 124th Street,[90] 
the George Bruce Library at 518 West 125th Street,[91] the 115th Street 
Branch Library at 203 West 115th Street,[92] and the 125th Street Branch 
Library at 224 East 125th Street, near Third Avenue.[93] The New York College 
of Podiatric Medicine, City College of New York, and Touro College of Osteopathic 
Medicine, are all located in Harlem. The Harlem River separates the Bronx 
and Manhattan, necessitating several spans between the two New York City 
boroughs. In East Harlem, the Wards Island Bridge, also known as the 103rd 
Street Footbridge, connects Manhattan with Wards Island. The Triboro Bridge 
is a complex of three separate bridges that offers connections between 
Queens, Manhattan (Harlem), and the Bronx.[94] Public transportation service 
is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This includes 
the New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations, as well as a 
Metro-North commuter rail stop at East 125th Street, connecting Westchester 
County with New York City. Some Bronx local routes also serve Manhattan, 
to provide customers with access between both boroughs.[95] Subway routes
