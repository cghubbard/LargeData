Danny Lynn Jackson (born January 5, 1962 in San Antonio, Texas) is an American 
former baseball pitcher who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) from 1983 to 1997. He played for the Kansas City Royals of the American 
League and the Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia 
Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals and the San Diego Padres all of the National 
League. A key member of the World Series winning Royals in 1985, Jackson 
made one of the most important starts in Royals history in the American 
League Championship Series. Trailing the Blue Jays three games to one and 
facing elimination, Jackson tossed a complete game shutout and kept the 
Royals alive. Two weeks later, in the '85 World Series, Jackson again took 
the ball with the Royals trailing three games to one in a Game Five, and 
again Jackson led the Royals to a crucial victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Jackson's 1.04 post-season ERA with the Royals is the lowest in team history 
(min 10 IP). After disappointing seasons in 1986 and 1987, Jackson, along 
with √Ångel Salazar, was traded to Cincinnati for Kurt Stillwell and Ted 
Power. He was elected to the National League All-Star team twice (1988 
and 1994). He led the National League in wins in 1988 with 23 and, with 
18-game winner Tom Browning, combined for the best pitching tandem in baseball 
that season. Jackson's great 1988 season went largely unnoticed because 
of the outstanding season turned in by the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser. Jackson 
also played in three World Series for three teams: the 1985 Kansas City
