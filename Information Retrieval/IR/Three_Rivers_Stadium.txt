Three Rivers Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium located in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, from 1970 to 2000. It was home to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National 
Football League (NFL). Built as a replacement for Forbes Field, which opened 
in 1909, the US$55 million ($355.5 million today) multi-purpose facility 
was designed to maximize efficiency. Ground was broken in April 1968 and 
an oft behind-schedule construction plan lasted for 29 months.[5] The stadium 
opened on July 16, 1970 when the Pirates played their first game. In the 
1971 World Series, Three Rivers Stadium hosted the first World Series game 
played at night. The following year the stadium was the site of the Immaculate 
Reception. The final game in the stadium was won by the Steelers on December 
16, 2000. Three Rivers Stadium also hosted the Pittsburgh Maulers of the 
United States Football League and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers 
football team for a single season each.[6][7] After its closing, Three 
Rivers Stadium was imploded in 2001, and the Pirates and Steelers each 
moved into newly built stadiums: PNC Park and Heinz Field, respectively. 
A proposal for a new sports stadium in Pittsburgh was first made in 1948; 
however, plans did not attract much attention until the late 1950s.[8] 
The Pittsburgh Pirates played their home games at Forbes Field, which opened 
in 1909,[9] and was the second oldest venue in the National League (Philadelphia's 
Connie Mack Stadium was oldest, having opened only two months earlier than 
Forbes). The Pittsburgh Steelers, who had moved from Forbes Field to Pitt 
Stadium in 1964, were large supporters of the project.[8] For their part, 
according to longtime Pirates announcer Bob Prince, the Pirates wanted 
a bigger place to play in order to draw more revenue.[10] In 1958, the 
Pirates sold Forbes to the University of Pittsburgh for $2 million ($16.4 
million today). The university wanted the land for expanded graduate facilities.[10] 
As part of the deal, the university leased Forbes back to the Pirates until 
a replacement could be built.[11] An early design of the stadium included 
plans to situate the stadium atop a bridge across the Monongahela River. 
It was to call for a 70,000 seat stadium with hotels, marina and even 100 
lane bowling alley.[12] Plans of the "Stadium over the Monongahela" were 
eventually not pursued.[13] A design was presented in 1958 which featured 
an open center field design—through which fans could view Pittsburgh's 
"Golden Triangle".[14] A site on the city's Northside was approved on August 
10, 1958, due to land availability and parking space,[14] the latter of 
which had been a problem at Forbes Field.[8] The same site had hosted Exposition 
Park, which the Pirates had left in 1909.[15] The stadium was located in 
a hard-to-access portion of downtown, making it hard in later years to 
get in before games and leave after games.[10] Political debate continued 
over the North Side Sports Stadium and the project was often behind schedule 
and over-budget.[14] Arguments were made by commissioner (and former Allegheny 
County Medical Examiner) Dr. William McCelland that the Pirates and Steelers 
should fund a higher percentage of the $33 million project ($241.1 million 
today). Due to lack of support, however, the arguments faded.[14][16] Ground 
for Three Rivers Stadium was broken on April 25, 1968.[14] Due to the Steelers' 
suggestions, the stadium's design was changed to enclose center field.[14] 
Construction continued, though it became plagued with problems such as 
thieves stealing materials from the building site.[14] In November 1969, 
Arthur Gratz asked the city for an additional $3 million ($19.4 million 
today), which was granted.[17] In January 1970, the opening target date 
of the stadium was set for May 29; however, because of a failure to install 
the lights on schedule, opening day was pushed back to July 16.[17] The 
stadium was named in February 1969 for to its location at the confluence 
of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which forms the Ohio River.[18][19] 
It would sometimes be called The House That Clemente Built after Pirates' 
right-fielder Roberto Clemente.[20] In their first game after the All-Star 
Break in 1970, the Pirates opened the stadium against Cincinnati on Thursday, 
July 16.[21][22] The team donned new uniform designs for the first time 
that day, a similar plan was for new "mini-skirts" for female ushers however 
the ushers union declined the uniform change for female workers.[23] A 
parade was held before opening ceremonies. The expansive parking lot, both 
Pirates and Steelers team offices, the Allegheny Club (VIP Club) and the 
press boxes and facilities were not opened until weeks later due to extended 
labor union work stoppages. Instead of allowing cars to park, the team 
instructed fans to park downtown and walk to the stadium over bridges or 
take shuttle buses. The opening of Three Rivers marked the first time the 
Pirates allowed beer to be sold in the stands during a game since the early 
1960s.[23] Three Rivers Stadium was similar in design to other stadiums 
built in the 1960s and 1970s, such as Riverfront Stadium, the Houston Astrodome, 
and Busch Memorial Stadium, which were designed as multi-purpose facilities 
to maximize efficiency.[24][25] Due to their similar design these stadiums 
were nicknamed "cookie-cutter" or "concrete doughnuts" ballparks.[10] The 
sight lines were more favorable to football; almost 70% of the seats in 
the baseball configuration were in fair territory.[10] It originally seated 
50,611 for baseball,[10] but several expansions over the years brought 
it to 58,729.[26] In 1993, the Pirates placed tarps on most of the upper 
deck to create a better baseball atmosphere, reducing capacity to 47,687.[10][27][28] 
Three Rivers was the first multi-purpose stadium and the first in either 
the NFL or MLB to feature Tartan Turf, which was installed from opening 
day.[29] It was replaced by a number of other surfaces including AstroTurf.[30] 
It had a dirt skin infield on the basepaths for baseball through 1972,[21] 
until converted to "sliding pits" at the bases for 1973.[31] Renovations 
for the start of the 1983 baseball season included the initial placement 
of AstroTurf, the center field Stewart-Warner scoreboard being removed 
and replaced with new seating—while a new Diamond Vision scoreboard with 
a White Way messageboard was installed at the top of the center field upper 
deck—and the outfield fence being painted blue.[32][33] The field originally 
used "Gamesaver vacuum vehicles" to dry the surface, though they were replaced 
by an underground drainage system.[30] In 1975, the baseball field's outfield 
fences were moved ten feet (3 m) closer to home plate, in an attempt to 
boost home run numbers.[30] The bullpens were moved to multiple locations 
throughout the stadium's history; however, their first position was also 
their final one—beyond the right-field fence.[30] A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
story in 1970 stated that the new stadium boasted 1,632 floodlight bulbs.[34] 
Due to Three Rivers Stadium's multi-purpose design, bands including Led 
Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, and The Who hosted concerts at 
the venue.[35][36] On August 11, 1985,[37] Bruce Springsteen and the E 
Street Band hosted the largest concert in Pittsburgh history, when they 
performed for 65,935 on-lookers.[38] And in 1992, the Pittsburgh Penguins 
celebrated their second Stanley Cup victory at the Stadium.[36] The stadium 
hosted various Jehovah's Witnesses conventions, including international 
conventions in 1973 and 1978, and a centennial conference in 1984. A Billy 
Graham Crusade took place at Three Rivers in June, 1993.[39] The venue 
also served as the premiere of the 1994 Disney film Angels in the Outfield 
which, despite being based around the then-Disney owned California Angels, 
paid homage to the original 1951 film, which featured the Pirates in "heavenly" 
need.[40] Three Rivers Stadium had a beverage contract with Coca-Cola throughout 
its history. It was during the Steelers' stay in Three Rivers that the 
now famous "Mean Joe" Greene Coke commercial aired, leading to a longstanding 
relationship between the two. When Heinz Field opened, Coca-Cola also assumed 
the beverage contract for that stadium (the Pirates signed a deal with 
Pepsi for PNC Park before signing with Coke again in 2014), and also became 
the primary sponsor for the Steelers' own hall of fame, the Coca-Cola Great 
Hall. After the initial 10-year contract expired, Heinz Field contracted 
with Pepsi for exclusive pouring rights, breaking a 50-year tradition with 
the Steelers. In September 1991, planning began to build a new baseball 
park for the Pittsburgh Pirates.[41] As talks continued, a proposal to 
re-model Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football stadium was made.[42] 
However, Steelers ownership did not support the idea, stating that a new 
venue would be needed for the franchise to remain competitive.[43] On July 
9, 1998, the Allegheny Regional Asset District board approved an $809 million 
plan which would fund the Pirates' PNC Park and the Steelers' Heinz Field.[44] 
Ground was broken for the new stadiums in 1999.[45][46] On October 1, 2000, 
the Pirates were defeated 10–9 by the Chicago Cubs in their final game 
at Three Rivers Stadium.[28] After the game, former Pirate Willie Stargell 
threw out the ceremonial last pitch.[47] Two months later on December 16, 
2000, the Steelers concluded play at Three Rivers Stadium, with a 24-3 
victory over the Washington Redskins.[48] Three Rivers Stadium was imploded 
on February 11, 2001 at 8:03 a.m. on a chilly 21 °F (−6 °C) day. Over 20,000 
people viewed the implosion from Point State Park. Another 3,000-4,000 
viewing from atop Mount Washington and an uncounted number of people viewed 
the demolition from various high points across the city. Mark Loizeaux 
of Controlled Demolition, Inc. pushed the button that set off the 19-second 
implosion, while Elizabeth and Joseph King pushed the "ceremonial old fashioned 
dynamite plunger".[49] The demolition cost $5.1 million and used 4,800 pounds 
of explosive.[50][51] With the newly constructed Heinz Field only 80 feet 
away, effects from the blast were a concern. Doug Loizeaux, vice president 
of Controlled Demolition, Inc., was happy to report that there was no debris 
within 40 feet of Heinz Field. At the time of the demolition, Three Rivers 
Stadium still had $27.93 million in debt ($37.4 million today), some of 
it from the original construction but the rest from renovations in the 
mid-1980s, bringing more criticism to the public funding of sports stadiums. 
The debt was finally retired by 2010.[52][53] Like most stadiums demolished 
during this time whose replacements were located nearby (including the 
Civic Arena over a decade later), the site of Three Rivers Stadium mostly 
became a parking lot. Much like the Pittsburgh Penguins would do with the 
site of Civic Arena, the Steelers retained development rights to the site 
of Three Rivers, and would later build Stage AE on portions of the site, 
as well as an office building that hosts the studios for Root Sports Pittsburgh, 
the headquarters of StarKist Tuna, and the regional headquarters of Del 
Monte Foods. On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the Immaculate 
Reception, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Franco 
Harris made the reception in the parking lot.[54] In 2015, the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette moved into a new office building also built on a portion on 
the site after 53 years in the former Pittsburgh Press building and more 
than two centuries in Downtown.[55] In 2011, the Pittsburgh Tribune Review 
reported that the Three Rivers Stadium website was still active, 11 years 
after the facility's demolition.[56] In 2015, the newspaper revisited the 
issue and reported again that the website remained active, 14 years after 
demolition.[57] The Pitt Panthers played at Three Rivers Stadium on multiple 
occasions. The Panthers played a full home schedule here during the 2000 
season. The Panthers went 7-3 in the stadium. They played here in the following 
games: 1975: #10 Penn State 7 vs #17 Pitt Panthers 6 1976: Penn State 7 
vs #1 Pitt Panthers 24 1982: #5 North Carolina 6 vs #1 Pitt Panthers 7 
1998: West Virginia 52 vs Pitt Panthers 14 2000: Kent State 7 vs Pitt Panthers 
30 2000: Penn State 0 vs Pitt Panthers 12 2000: Rutgers 17 vs Pitt Panthers 
29 2000: Boston College 26 vs Pitt Panthers 42 2000: North Carolina 20 
vs Pitt Panthers 17 2000: West Virginia 28 vs Pitt Panthers 38 Three Rivers 
Stadium opened on July 16, 1970, but the Pirates lost 3–2 to the Cincinnati 
Reds in front of 48,846 spectators.[27][58] The first pitch was thrown 
by Dock Ellis—a strike—to Ty Cline.[59] The first hit in the stadium was 
by Pittsburgh's Richie Hebner, in the bottom of the first inning.[59] The 
Pirates lifted their local blackout policy so that local fans could see 
the inaugural game.[60] The Pirates' lowest season of attendance was 1985, 
at an average of 9,085.[61] The average attendance would peak in 1991, 
when the Pirates averaged 25,498 per game.[61] Game one of the 1970 NLCS, 
at Three Rivers Stadium, was the first postseason baseball game to be played 
on an artificial surface.[13] The following season, the Pirates advanced 
to the World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. Three Rivers Stadium 
hosted game four, in which the Pirates defeated the Orioles in the first 
night game in the history of the World Series.[13] Pittsburgh hosted its 
third All-Star Game in 1974. The National League won the game 7–2 and the 
Pirates' Ken Brett was the winning pitcher.[62] In 1979, the Pirates again 
won a World Championship, yet again defeating the Baltimore Orioles in 
a seven-game World Series. Games 3, 4 and 5 of the Series were played at 
Three Rivers. 15 years later, the midsummer classic returned in 1994. With 
59,568 in attendance, the largest crowd to ever attend a baseball game 
at the stadium,[27] the National League won 8-7 in the 10th inning. On 
July 6, 1980, the Pirates beat the Chicago Cubs 5-4 in 20 innings—the most 
innings ever played at the stadium. The longest game at the stadium was 
played on August 6, 1989, when Jeff King hit a walk-off home run 5 hours 
and 42 minutes into the 18-inning contest, as the Pirates once again beat 
the Cubs 5-4.[63] On September 30, 1972, Pirates' right-fielder Roberto 
Clemente got his 3,000th hit at Three Rivers Stadium, three months before 
his death.[13] Bobby Bonilla hit one of the only 13 home runs ever hit 
into the upper deck of Three Rivers Stadium, and one of the six to the 
right-field side. Willie Stargell is the all-time leader in upper deck 
shots at the stadium, hitting four of the remaining five right-field blasts; 
Mark Whiten hit the other. The left-field upper deck had been reached by 
Jeff Bagwell twice, and Bob Robertson, Greg Luzinski, Howard Johnson, Glenallen 
Hill and Devon White (his home run struck the facade) once each.[64] "No 
matter what happens, when they tear Three Rivers down, a monument ought 
to be built there. Even if they end up building a hockey rink there, they 
should put some kind of a monument to that area where the Immaculate Reception 
took place." The Pittsburgh Steelers played their first game in Three Rivers 
Stadium on September 20, 1970—a 19–7 loss to the Houston Oilers.[28] Throughout 
their 31 seasons in Three Rivers Stadium, the Steelers posted a record 
of 182–72, including a 13-5 playoff record, and defeated every visiting 
franchise at least once from the stadium's opening to close, enjoying perfect 
records there against seven teams. The Steelers sold out every home game 
from 1972 through the closing of the stadium, a streak which continues 
through 2008.[66] The largest attendance for a football game was on January 
15, 1995, when 61,545 spectators witnessed the Steelers lose to the San 
Diego Chargers.[28] On December 23, 1972, Three Rivers Stadium was site 
to the Immaculate Reception, which became regarded as one of the greatest 
plays in NFL history.[65] Three Rivers Stadium hosted seven AFC Championship 
Games from 1972 to 1998;[28][67] the Steelers won four.[68] In the 1995 
AFC Championship game, the Steelers' Randy Fuller deflected a Hail Mary 
pass intended for Indianapolis Colts receiver Aaron Bailey as time expired, 
to send the franchise to their 5th Super Bowl.[67][67] A Steelers symbol 
recognized worldwide, The Terrible Towel debuted on December 27, 1975 at 
Three Rivers Stadium. The Steelers would move to Heinz Field after it was
