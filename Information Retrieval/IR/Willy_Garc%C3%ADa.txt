High School in Cayey, Puerto Rico.[45] After signing for $253,000, Ortiz 
reported to the GCL Twins where he did well, hitting .274 with two home 
runs and 27 RBIs over 48 games.[46] Daniel was forced to miss the 2009 
season after undergoing left knee surgery during the offseason[47] and 
as a result, his stock dropped dramatically from a high-round draft selection 
to a player still playing in a Rookie League two seasons after being drafted. 
Ortiz did little to change that perception over the next two years, hitting 
.259 with 11 homers and 43 RBIs over 62 games with the Elizabethton Twins 
in 2010 and .239 with 10 homers and 71 RBIs the following year with Low-A 
Beloit. For the 2012 season, Ortiz began the year back with the Snappers 
but quickly proved that he was a changed player, hitting .299 with 8 runs 
and 13 RBIs through only 22 games and earning himself a spot on the midseason 
Midwest League all-star team.[48] This production was enough to warrant 
a promotion and Ortiz started the month of May with the High-A Fort Myers 
Miracle. Over the rest of the season, Ortiz continued to hit for both average 
and power, finishing with a .269 batting average, eight home runs and 35 
RBIs. Ortiz was promoted again to begin the 2013 year, playing for the 
Double-A New Britain Rock Cats. Though at 23 he was 1.4 years younger than 
the average Double-A player, Ortiz proved that he was where he belonged, 
hitting a career high 12 home runs to go along with a .258 batting average 
and 60 RBIs. In 2014 Ortiz remained with the Rock Cats and absolutely tore 
up the Eastern League for 48 games, and he owned a .500 SLG%, a .325 AVG, 
and 31 RBIs before an early-June call up to the Rochester Red Wings. In 
only 55 games since his promotion, Ortiz has hit 7 home runs, driven in 
29 runs, recorded a slugging percentage of .456, and owns a respectable 
.257 batting average, all in a league where he is a full three years younger 
than the average player.[49] He signed a minor league contract with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in December 2015.[50] José Osuna (born December 12, 
1992) is a Venezuelan professional baseball outfielder and first baseman 
in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Osuna signed with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates as an international free agent in December 2009.[51] The Pirates 
added him to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season.[44] Ángel Luis 
Sánchez (born November 28, 1989) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher 
in Minor League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates' organization. He signed 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 2010 and played 
with the Great Lakes Loons in the Midwest League in 2011, where he was 
8–4 in 20 games (16 starts) with a 2.82 ERA. He was promoted to the Rancho 
Cucamonga Quakes in 2012 where he struggled a bit, going 6–12 with a 6.58

with Josh Wall and Steve Ames) for Ricky Nolasco. He was added to the Marlins 
40-man roster on November 20, 2013.[52] The Tampa Bay Rays claimed Sánchez
