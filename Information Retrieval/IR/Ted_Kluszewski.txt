As player As coach Theodore Bernard "Big Klu" Kluszewski (September 10, 
1924 – March 29, 1988) was an American professional baseball player from 
1947 through 1961. He spent most of his 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) 
career playing for the Cincinnati Reds as a first baseman. Kluszewski was 
a National League (NL) All-Star for four seasons. He had a .298 lifetime 
batting average, hitting over.290 three-times and over .300 seven-times. 
In 1954, he was the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) runner-up (he had a .326 
batting average, led the NL in home runs (49), RBI (141), and fielding 
average (.996)). In 1959, Kluszewski was traded late in the season to the 
Chicago White Sox from the Pittsburgh Pirates. He batted .297 and did not 
commit any errors in 31 games for Chicago which helped the "Go Go" White 
Sox of the 1950s clinch the American League pennant. In 1962, he was inducted 
into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. Ted Kluszewski was born in Argo, 
Illinois a few miles west of Chicago and was of Polish descent. He played 
football and graduated from Argo Community High School, and was discovered 
at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana where he played football 
(team was 9-0-1) as well as baseball (he hit .443 in 1945). Due to wartime 
travel restrictions, the Cincinnati Reds, who normally held spring training 
in Tampa, Florida, were forced to train at Indiana University from 1943 
to 1945. Kluszewski, then a student at the university, drew the attention 
of Reds' groundskeeper Matty Schwab. Schwab saw Kluszewski hitting balls 
over an embankment near the baseball diamond that none of the Reds players 
was able to get near. Cincinnati Reds scouts were sufficiently impressed, 
but Kluszewski, who was also a standout tight end on the Hoosier football 
squad, did not immediately sign, because he did not want to endanger his 
collegiate football eligibility. Instead, he signed after graduating in 
1946. After batting .325 and .377 in two minor league seasons, he was called 
up to Cincinnati in 1947 and became the Reds' starting first baseman at 
the end of 1948. Soon after the 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), 240-pound (108.8 kg) 
Ted Kluszewski joined the Reds in 1947, he cut off the sleeves of his uniform, 
much to the chagrin of the Reds' front office, an action he took because 
the tight sleeves constricted his large biceps and shoulders and interfered 
with his swing. "They got pretty upset, but it was either that or change 
my swing — and I wasn't about to change my swing", said Kluszewski.[this

of Fame manager Leo Durocher was asked to name five of the strongest players 
in baseball; he complied. When it was pointed out that he had left Ted 
Kluszewski off his list, Durocher said: "Kluszewski? I'm talking about 
human beings!"[this quote needs a citation] Kluszewski was named to the 
National League All-Star roster from 1953 through 1956, and was a career 
.298 hitter with 279 home runs and 1,028 RBI in 1,718 games. In ten of 
his fifteen major league seasons, Kluszewski walked (492) more often than 
he struck out (365). In 1955, he hit 47 homers while striking out 40 times. 
No player since has hit 40 homers and struck out 40 or fewer times in the 
same season (Barry Bonds missed duplicating this feat by one strikeout 
in 2004). "Big Klu" enjoyed his most productive years from 1953 through 
1956, with home run totals of 40, 49, 47 and 35. He had more home runs 
than strikeouts each of those years, the only player in major league history 
to hit 35 or more homers in four seasons in which he had fewer strikeouts 
than home runs.[1] Only three other major league ballplayers have done 
this even twice: Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Johnny Mize. He also drove 
in over 100 base runners each year in that four-year span, including a 
league-leading 141 RBIs in 1954. Kluszewski hit over .300 seven times while 
with the Reds, finishing in the top ten in the league in batting average 
each of those years. Kluszewski also led National League first basemen 
in fielding percentage five straight years (1951–1955), a major league 
record. When he left the Reds after the 1957 season, he was considered[by 
whom?] to have been the greatest left-handed hitter and one of the best 
fielding first baseman in club history.[2] Kluszewski's injuries had begun 
taking their toll; Kluszewski was limited to playing just four full seasons 
in his fifteen-year career and would eventually spend his last four major 
league seasons after he left the Reds as a part-time player. His Reds uniform 
number 18 was retired by the Reds in 1998.[2] He was traded to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates before the 1958 season. In 1958, he played in 100 games for the 
Pirates and hit .292 with 88 hits and 37 RBIs. In 1959, he played in 60 
games for the Pirates before he was traded in August to the Chicago White 
Sox who were in a close pennant race. On August 25, 1959, his trade to 
the White Sox for two players gave manager Al López's first place White 
Sox team the much needed additional hitting power to help the Sox win the 
American League Pennant. The White Sox faced the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
the World Series. In the series first game at Chicago's Comiskey Park, 
Kluszewski, who had grown up in the Chicago area, hit two home runs and 
drove in five in an 11–0 rout of the Dodgers. However, the Dodgers would 
win the next four out of five games to win the series with pitching that 
neutralized many of the Sox players. Kluszewski hit a high .391 with 3 
HR and 10 RBI in the series. Automobile mogul Jim Moran offered a free 
car to any White Sox player who hit a home run in that World Series. As 
he recalled in an Oct. 21, 2005 interview with Mike Downey of the Chicago 
Tribune, Moran ended up giving Kluszewski three original 1960 Ford Falcons. 
During that '59 season, Sox owner Bill Veeck introduced, for the first 
time in the major leagues, a team uniform with the players' last name on 
the backs of their jerseys. During a road trip to New York, Ted Kluszewski 
became the first player to appear in a game with his name misspelled, with 
a backwards "z" and an "x" instead of the second "k".[3] When Major League 
Baseball expanded in 1960, Kluszewski was left unprotected in the expansion 
draft and selected by the Los Angeles Angels. In 1961, Kluszewski played 
his final season hampered by back and leg problems. On April 11, the season's 
opening day and playing against the Baltimore Orioles at Memorial Stadium, 
he belted two home runs for the Angels off Milt Pappas as the Angels defeated 
the Orioles 7-2. He finished the season hitting .243 with 15 home runs 
and 39 RBIs in 107 games. After retiring as a player, Kluszewski was a 
hitting coach under Sparky Anderson with the Cincinnati Reds during their 
outstanding teams in the 1970s. In 1979, he became the Reds' minor league 
hitting instructor, a position he held until 1986, when he suffered a massive 
heart attack and underwent emergency bypass surgery. He retired afterward. 
Kluszewski died on March 29, 1988 in Cincinnati at age 63. 1962: Ted Kluszewski 
is inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum. 1974: Ted 
Kluszewski was inducted into the National Polish- American Sports Hall 
of Fame[4] 1976: Esquire magazine article by sportswriter Harry Stein featured 
an "ALL Time All-Star Argument Starter" consisting of five ethnic baseball 
teams. Kluszweski was the first baseman on Stein's Polish team. 1981: "Ted 
Kluszewski" is in first line of the chorus to Terry Cashman's song, "Talkin' 
Baseball", a musical tribute to baseball. 1998: On July 18, Kluszewski's 
number 18 was retired by the Cincinnati Reds at a pregame ceremony at Cinergy 
Field. His widow, Elenor Guckel, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before 
the game between the San Diego Padres and the Cincinnati Reds. 2003: Great 
American Ball Park, the home of the Cincinnati Reds, opened on March 31. 
Before the inaugural game, the Reds dedicated a bronze statue of Kluszewski 
on the Crosley Terrace area outside the main gate. Statues of Crosley Field 
era stars Ernie Lombardi, Joe Nuxhall, and Frank Robinson were erected
