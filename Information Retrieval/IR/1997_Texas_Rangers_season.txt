The Texas Rangers 1997 season involved the Rangers finishing 3rd in the 
American League west with a record of 77 wins and 85 losses. Despite not

over 2.945 million fans, which would be the franchise's best until 2011. 
On a somber note, the club would lose long-time radio broadcaster Mark 
Holtz to leukemia during the season; however, in his final game in May 
the Rangers won, allowing him to sign off one final time with his trademark
