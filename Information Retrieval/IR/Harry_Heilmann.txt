Harry Edwin Heilmann (August 3, 1894 – July 9, 1951), nicknamed "Slug" 
due to his lack of speed, was an American baseball player and radio announcer. 
He played professional baseball for 19 years between 1913 and 1932, including 
17 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Detroit Tigers (1914, 1916–1929) 
and Cincinnati Reds (1930, 1932). He was a play-by-play announcer for the 
Tigers for 17 years from 1934 to 1950. Heilmann won four American League 
batting championships, securing the honors in 1921, 1923, 1925 and 1927. 
He appeared in 2,147 major league games, including 1,525 games as a right 
fielder and 448 as a first baseman and compiled a career batting average 
of .342, the 12th highest in major league history, and third highest among 
right-handed batters. At the time of his retirement in 1932, Heilmann ranked 
sixth in major league history with 542 doubles and eighth with 1,540 RBIs. 
He remains one of only five players in American League history to hit .400 
for a season, having accomplished the feat in 1923 with a .403 batting 
average. At his peak from 1921 to 1927, Heilmann compiled a .380 batting 
average, .452 on-base percentage, .583 slugging percentage, and averaged 
116 RBIs, 41 doubles, 11 triples, and 104 runs scored per season. After 
retiring from baseball, Heilmann ran unsuccessfully for the office of Detroit 
City Treasurer and operated a semipro baseball team in 1933 and, in 1934, 
began a career as a radio broadcaster. From 1934 to 1941, he was play-by-play 
announcer on the Michigan Radio Network covering parts of Michigan located 
outside metropolitan Detroit. From 1942 to 1950, he was the exclusive radio 
voice of the Tigers throughout the state. Heilmann died from lung cancer 
in July 1951. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
six months later in January 1952. Heilmann was born in San Francisco in 
1894.[1] His father, Richard W. Heilmann, was born in 1860 at Sacramento, 
California, the son of an Irish mother and a father from Saxony.[2][3][4] 
His mother, Mary (McVoy) Heilmann, sometimes referred to as Mollie, was 
born in 1864 in County Roscommon, Ireland.[3][5] Harry was the couple's 
fourth surviving child, having an older sister, May, and two older brothers, 
Richard, Jr., and Walter.[6][7] Heilmann's father operated a soap business,[8] 
ran as a Republican for the office of Supervisor of San Francisco's Ninth 
Ward in 1896,[9] and died in June 1897 at age 36.[7] As a boy in the 1890s 
and continuing at least through the time of the 1900 Census, Heilmann lived 
with his family at 708A Brannan Street in what is now the South of Market 
district of San Francisco.[10][8][7][11] Heilmann was 12 years old at the 
time of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake that killed approximately 3,000 
persons and left nearly 75% of the city's population homeless and living 
in refugee camps.[12][13] Heilmann's older brother, Walter, was a gifted 
athlete who attended Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory (Then "Sacred Heart 
College") in San Francisco. On June 3, 1908, a year after the city's devastation 
by earthquake, Walter died at age 16 while on a sailboat excursion with 
three schoolmates to visit the battleship USS Connecticut in drydock at 
the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, near the present site of Candlestick 
Park. The boat capsized in a squall, and Walter drowned while trying to 
swim to shore; the other three boys were rescued.[14][15][6] As of 1910, 
Heilmann was living with his mother at 112 Sixteenth Street in the Dogpatch 
neighborhood of San Francisco.[5] Heilmann followed his older brother to 
Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory,[1] where he played football, track 
and field, and basketball, but not baseball.[16] He graduated from Sacred 
Heart in 1912 at age 17 with a collegiate certificate.[17] After graduating 
from Sacred Heart, Heilmann worked as a bookkeeper for the Mutual Biscuit 
Company.[16] Heilmann appeared in a semipro baseball game in 1913 for a 
team from Hanford, California. While playing for Hanford, he was signed 
by a scout for the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL).[16] 
After being signed by the Beavers, Heilmann was assigned to the Portland 
Colts of the Northwestern League. He compiled a .305 batting average in 
122 games for the Colts.[18] In September 1913, Heilmann was drafted by 
the Detroit Tigers. He made his major league debut with the Tigers on May 
16, 1914, and played in 68 games that year, batting .225 and committing 
six errors in 31 games in the outfield (29 games in center field) for an 
.870 fielding percentage.[1] For the 1915 season, the Tigers sent Heilmann 
to the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Heilmann 
missed the latter portion of the season after suffering from dizzy spells.[19] 
Before the health problems sidelined him, Heilmann appeared in 98 games 
for the Seals and compiled a .364 batting average and .544 slugging percentage 
with 23 doubles and 12 home runs.[1] His .364 batting average led the PCL 
for the 1915 season.[20] Heilmann returned to the Tigers in 1916 and appeared 
in 136 games, including 30 games at first base and 77 as an outfielder. 
Although his .282 batting average was low by the standards he would set 
later, he ranked among the American League leaders with 30 doubles (seventh 
best), 73 RBIs (seventh again) and 43 extra base hits (eighth).[1] He also 
became a favorite in Detroit for his actions off the field. On July 25, 
1916, he saved a woman whose vehicle had rolled into the Detroit River, 
diving in to the water to rescue her, although two others died in the accident.[21] 
His heroic act was reported in the national press, and he was loudly applauded 
at the next day's game.[22] He continued to improve at the plate in 1917, 
once again ranking among the American League leaders with 86 RBIs (fourth), 
five home runs (seventh) and 11 triples (eighth); but he was called "Slug" 
due to his notoriously slow running and difficulties in the field.[1] In 
1917, the Tigers tried playing him in right field (95 games), center field 
(28) and first base (27), but he was not particularly good at any of those 
positions. In 1918, Heilmann appeared in 79 games for the Tigers, 40 in 
right field and 37 at first base, compiling a .276 batting average.[1] 
In mid-July 1918, he left the Tigers to enlist in the United States Navy 
during World War I.[23] He served as a quartermaster on submarines off 
the West Coast of the United States.[24] He returned to the Tigers in 1919 
and had his best season to date, ranking among the American League leaders 
with a .320 batting average (10th best), .477 slugging percentage (seventh), 
93 RBIs (fourth), 53 extra base hits (fourth again), 15 triples (second), 
256 total bases (fifth), 172 hits (sixth) and eight home runs (eighth). 
He had another strong year in 1920 with a .309 average, 41 extra base hits 
and 89 RBIs, but he continued to fall short in the field in those two years. 
Detroit manager Hughie Jennings made him the Tigers' starting first baseman, 
and he led the league in errors at that position both years, including 
31 in 1919 for a .979 fielding percentage.[1] In 1921, Heilmann appeared 
in 149 games, including 145 as the Tigers' starting right fielder. He won 
his first batting title, compiling a .394 batting average to outpace his 
manager and teammate Ty Cobb who hit .389.[25] Unofficial figures released 
in October showed Cobb as the batting champion,[26] but official figures 
released in December showed Heilmann to be the champion.[27] He was the 
first right-handed batter to win the American League batting title since 
Nap Lajoie in 1905.[28] Heilmann also led the American League in 1921 with 
237 hits and ranked second behind Babe Ruth with 139 RBIs, 365 total bases, 
a .606 slugging percentage, 292 times on base, a 7.3 offensive wins above 
replacement (WAR) rating, and 159 runs created. He also ranked among the 
league leaders with a .444 on-base percentage (third behind Ruth and Cobb), 
43 doubles (third behind Tris Speaker and Ruth), and 76 extra base hits 
(third behind Ruth and Bob Meusel).[25] Heilmann's batting average in 1921 
was 85 points higher than his 1920 average and 101 points higher than his 
career average prior to 1921.[1] Some attributed Heilmann's dramatic improvement 
to the tutelage of Ty Cobb, who took over as the Tigers' manager in 1921.[29] 
Others attributed Heilmann's improvement to the "live-ball era" that started 
in 1920 and forced outfielders to spread out and play deeper, allowing 
more of Heilmann's line drives to fall into the wider gaps. However, Frank 
G. Menke attributed his improvement to having learned the game, noting 
that the "lively ball" failed to account for the fact that those who outhit 
Heilmann from 1914 to 1920 were no longer outhitting him. Menke observed: 
"There is nothing picturesque, nothing highly colored, nothing bombastic 
or spectacular about his methods. He is not a grandstander -- not theatrical. 
And because he isn't, he does not get the acclaim and the plaudits which 
men, less wonderful, but better showmen, achieve for themselves."[30] Though 
primarily a line-drive hitter, Heilmann could also hit for power. His 19 
home runs in 1921 ranked fifth in the American League, and he ranked among 
the league leaders in home runs 11 times. On July 8, 1921, Heilmann hit 
a home run off "Bullet Joe" Bush that traveled over the center field fence 
in Detroit and "actually made the patrons gasp in astonishment."[31] Heilmann's 
home run was widely reported to have traveled 610 feet, eclipsing Babe 
Ruth's longest home run of 465 feet.[32][33] Detroit's grounds keeper was 
more conservative, reporting that no measurement was made, but estimating 
that it traveled more than 500 feet.[31] In a column published after the 
1921 season, Grantland Rice rated Heilmann as the premier scholar in the 
American League's School of Swat, ahead of Cobb and Ruth.[34] The entire 
Tiger lineup hit remarkably well in 1921. In addition to Heilmann and Cobb's 
1-2 finish for the batting title, Detroit's third outfielder, Bobby Veach, 
was also among the league's best at .338.[25] The 1921 Tigers finished 
the season with a team batting average of .316, the highest in American 
League history and second highest in major league history.[35] However, 
true to the baseball adage that good pitching beats good hitting, the 1921 
Tigers lacked good pitching and finished in sixth place, 27 games behind 
the pennant-winning Yankees.[36] The 1921 season marked the start of a 
seven-year stretch in which Heilmann compiled a .380 batting average, .452 
on-base percentage, .583 slugging percentage, and averaged 116 RBIs, 41 
doubles, 11 triples, 15 home runs, and 104 runs scored.[1] Heilmann was 
known as a line drive hitter who clubbed the ball harder than any batter 
of his era with the exception of Babe Ruth.[37] His one major handicap 
as a player was a lack of speed that led to his being known by the nickname 
"Slug". He was long known as "one of the slowest men in baseball."[38] 
Hall of Fame sports writer Tommy Holmes noted: "Heilmann was never much 
faster than an ice wagon on the base paths. Without doubt, he is the slowest 
moving great hitter who ever lived."[37] According to Holmes, Ty Cobb's 
speed added 50 hits a year to his output, while Heilmann's lack of speed 
robbed him of infield hits.[37] Sportswriter Harry Grayson later wrote 
that Heilmann's inability to beat out infield hits was the one thing that 
kept Heilmann from matching Rogers Hornsby as the greatest right-handed 
batter in baseball history.[24] In February 1922, Heilmann refused to sign 
his contract, demanding to be paid $15,000.[39] On March 3, 1922, Heilmann 
signed a contract for $12,500 with the Tigers, agreeing to report to spring 
training the following week.[40][41] His spring training was then interrupted 
again in late March when he returned to Detroit to be with his wife for 
the birth of their son on March 28, 1922.[42] By late June, Heilmann was 
batting .387 and battling George Sisler for the American League batting 
championship.[43] On August 26, 1922, Heilman's season came to an end when 
he sustained a complete break of his collarbone when he crashed into Frank 
Brower while trying to beat out an infield hit.[44] Heilmann had to have 
his collarbone rebroken and reset, and it was then discovered that Heilmann 
had also broken his shoulder. The injuries were so severe that Heilmann 
remained hospitalized until a week before the end of the season,[41] and 
even after leaving the hospital, he feared he might never play again.[45] 
Despite missing the last five weeks of the season, Heilmann hit a career 
high 21 home runs, fourth in the American League, and also ranked among 
the league leaders with a .356 batting average (fourth), a .432 on-base 
percentage (fifth) and a .598 slugging percentage (fourth).[1] In January 
1923, while preparing for spring training and recuperating from his collar 
and shoulder injuries, Heilmann took up handball and quickly developed 
a reputation as one of the best players in the country.[46][47] Heilmann's 
efforts at handball also helped him shed excess weight, reporting in spring 
training at 200 pounds, 30 pounds less than he had reported in 1922.[48] 
During the 1923 season, Heilmann won his second batting title, hitting 
.403 for the season, edging out Babe Ruth who hit .393.[49][50] Heilmann 
in 1923 became the fourth American League player to hit .400 or more for 
a season, joining Ty Cobb, Nap Lajoie and George Sisler.[51] Only one other 
American League player, Ted Williams in 1941, has accomplished the feat 
since 1923. In addition to winning the 1923 batting crown, Heilmann had 
one of his best seasons as a slugger. He finished second to Ruth in on-base 
percentage (.481), slugging percentage (.632) and wins above replacement 
(9.3). He also ranked among the American League leaders with 115 RBIs (third), 
211 hits (third), 18 home runs (third), 121 runs scored (fourth), 331 total 
bases (fourth), 44 doubles (fourth), and 73 extra base hits (fourth).[52] 
Despite hitting over .400, he finished third in the 1923 American League 
Most Valuable Player voting behind Ruth and Eddie Collins.[53] Heilmann 
in 1923 denied Ruth a Major League Baseball Triple Crown for the second 
time; Ruth led the league in home runs and RBIs in both 1921 and 1923, 
but was edged out in batting average in both years by Heilmann.[25][49] 
In 1926, another Tiger, Heinie Manush, won the batting title to deny Ruth 
the triple crown a third time.[54] Heilmann worked as a life insurance 
agent during the off-season in the 1920s. On October 16, 1923, after Babe 
Ruth had received his World Series winner's share‚ Heilmann‚ who was friends 
with Ruth despite having beaten him for the batting title‚ sold Ruth a 
$50‚000 life insurance policy.[citation needed] In 1924, Heilmann's batting 
average dropped by 56 points to .346, which ranked sixth in the American 
League. Despite the "slump" in batting average, Heilmann led the league 
with 45 doubles and ranked second behind Babe Ruth with a .533 slugging 
percentage, a 6.4 wins above replacement rating among position players, 
and 130 runs created. He also ranked among the league leaders with 304 
total bases (third), 71 extra base hits (third), 16 triples (third), 107 
runs scored (fourth), 278 times on base (fourth), a .428 on-base percentage 
(fifth), and 114 RBIs (fifth).[55] He appeared in 145 games as the Tigers' 
starting right fielder in 1924 and had his best defensive season, leading 
the league with 31 outfield assists; he never had more than 18 in any other 
season. He also led the league's right fielders with 263 putouts. Heilmann 
finished ninth in the voting for the 1924 American League Most Valuable 
Player award.[1] In 1925, Heilmann appeared in 150 games, 147 as Detroit's 
starting right fielder, and won his third batting title, this time in a 
close race with Tris Speaker. Going into the final day of the season, Heilmann 
trailed Speaker and needed a strong performance to pass him. On the last 
day, the Tigers played a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns, and 
Heilmann had six hits, including a home run, in nine at bats.[56] Heilmann 
finished with a .393 average, four points higher than Speaker.[57] He was 
again among the American League leaders in most offensive categories, with 
293 times on base (first), a 7.1 offensive wins above replacement rating 
(first), 134 RBIs (tied for first), 225 hits (third), a .457 on-base percentage 
(fourth), 326 total bases (fourth), a .569 slugging percentage (fifth), 
40 doubles (fifth), and 64 extra base hits (fifth).[57] Despite his accomplishments, 
the 1925 American League MVP award went to Roger Peckinpaugh, who hit almost 
100 points below Heilmann and had 70 fewer RBIs than Heilmann but whose 
Senators repeated as pennant winners.[58] In 1926, Heilmann appeared in 
141 games, 133 as the Tigers' starting right fielder, and compiled a .367 
batting average, .445 on-base percentage, and .534 slugging percentage.[1] 
Heilmann ranked fourth in batting average in the American League, and the 
Detroit outfield took three of the top four spots in the batting race, 
as center fielder Heinie Manush won the batting crown with a .378 average, 
and left fielder Bob Fothergill finished third with a .367 average.[54] 
Heilmann's .445 on-base percentage was second best in the American League, 
and he once again hit more than 100 RBIs and finished fifth in American 
League MVP voting.[1] On August 8, 1926, the Tigers held a Harry Heilman 
Day at which Detroit Mayor John W. Smith presented Heilmann with a $5,000 
Cadillac sports sedan, donated by Lawrence Fisher of Fisher Body, in front 
of a crowd of 40,000 spectators at Briggs Field.[59][60] In 1927, Heilmann 
again appeared in 141 games, 135 as the starter in right field.[1] He won 
his fourth and final batting crown with a .398 batting average in a close 
race with Al Simmons who hit .392.[61] On August 13, Simmons led Heilmann 
by 26 points, .393 to .367, but Heilmann took the lead after totaling 27 
hits in 11 games in the latter half of August. He then slumped in early 
September to fall behind Simmons and trailed by one point going into the 
last day of the season.[62] On the final day of the season, in a doubleheader 
at Cleveland, Heilmann had seven hits in nine at bats, including two home 
runs and three doubles, to add seven points to his average and overtake 
Simmons to win the batting championship.[62][63] He also ranked among the 
league leaders with a .475 on-base percentage (second), 120 RBIs (third), 
201 hits (third), 50 doubles (third), 73 extra base hits (third), .616 
slugging percentage (fourth), 311 total bases (fourth) and 106 runs scored 
(fifth).[1] Despite winning his fourth batting title, Heilmann still finished 
second in the American League MVP voting, this time behind Lou Gehrig of 
the Murderers' Row 1927 Yankees.[64] When a reporter reminded him that 
he had won batting titles every odd-numbered year from 1921 to 1927, Heilmann 
replied: "Mr. Navin [Detroit owner] gives me contracts on a two-year basis. 
I always bear down real hard when a new contract is coming up."[65] In 
1928, Heilmann appeared in 151 games for the Tigers, 125 as the team's 
starting right fielder and 24 as the starting first baseman. He compiled 
a .328 batting average, 70 points lower than his 1927 average of .398, 
but still seventh best in the American League. He also ranked among the 
American League leaders with 107 RBIs (fifth), 62 extra base hits (fifth), 
283 total bases (fifth), 14 home runs (sixth), a .507 slugging percentage 
(eighth), 183 hits (eighth), and 38 doubles (eighth).[1] In 1929, Heilmann 
was suspended in the spring for "indifferent training" and then finished 
the season on the bench.[66] He ended up appearing in 125 games, 111 as 
the team's starting right fielder, and compiled a .344 batting average, 
ninth best in the American League. He again ranked among the league leaders 
with 120 RBIs (fifth), a .565 slugging percentage (seventh), 41 doubles 
(seventh), and a .412 on-base percentage (ninth).[1] In October 1929, the 
Tigers offered Heilmann on waivers to the other American League teams, 
but he went unclaimed, as no team was willing to pay the waiver price of 
$7,500. He was then sold by the Tigers to the Cincinnati Reds for a sum 
reported to be somewhat under $25,000.[66][67] During the 1930 season, 
Heilmann appeared in 142 games with the Reds, 106 as the team's starting 
right fielder and 19 at first base. He compiled a .333 batting average 
and .416 on-base percentage, the highest on the Cincinnati club in 1930. 
He also totaled 68 extra base hits, 19 home runs and 91 RBIs and ranked 
among the American League leaders with 43 doubles (seventh) and 64 bases 
on balls (eighth). While not previously known for his fielding, his 2.78 
range factor in 1930 remains the second highest in major league history 
for a right fielder.[68] In March 1931, Heilmann was incapacitated by arthritis 
in his right wrist.[69] The arthritis was so severe that he was hospitalized 
for a time in the spring.[70] He ended up missing the entire 1931 season. 
In January 1932, Heilmann was reported by the Reds to be in "great shape".[71] 
He trained himself in Hot Springs and reported in late February that he 
believed himself ready.[72] However, he appeared in only 15 games for the 
Reds, primarily as a pinch hitter and in five games as the team's starting 
first baseman. He compiled a .258 batting average in 31 at bats and appeared 
in his last major league game on May 31, 1932.[1] He was released by the 
Reds on June 6, 1932. It was reported at the time that his arthritic wrist 
had "lost its snap, and the power of his bat and throwing arm was gone."[73] 
Heilmann worked in the insurance business in Cincinnati while he played 
for the Reds.[74] After retiring from baseball in 1932, Heilmann returned 
to Detroit and continued there in the insurance business.[75] He also ran 
in 1933 for the office of Detroit City Treasurer, losing decisively to 
Charles L. Williams by a margin of 138,478 votes for Williams to 68,695 
for Heilmann.[76] He also played sandlot baseball briefly for the Tool 
Shop team in the Detroit Amateur Baseball Federation.[74] On June 4, 1933, 
a crowd of more than 20,000 spectators watched Heilmann's return to baseball, 
as Heilmann had an RBI single in the first inning and made a "big league 
catch" in right field before a thunderstorm forced the cancellation of 
the game in the second inning.[77] After a few games with Tool Shop, Heilmann 
organized his own team, known as Harry Heilmann's All-Stars and consisting 
of former major league players, including Bobby Veach, Oscar Stanage, "Leaping 
Mike" Menosky, Marty Kavanagh, and Frank Fuller, which played games throughout 
Michigan and Ohio in July, August and September 1933, including a game 
against an African-American team from Akron.[78][79][80][81][82] In 1934, 
Heilman was hired by WXYZ to handle the play-by-play responsibility on 
broadcasts of Detroit Tigers games for the Michigan Broadcast Network. 
At the start of the 1934 season, he was paired with Harold True, but became 
a solo broadcaster by the end of the season and thereafter.[83] During 
the Tigers' 1935 championship season, Heilmann broadcast all home games 
for the Tigers, while out-of-town games were relayed by telegraph with 
play-by-play being read by Bob Longstreet from the WXYZ studio in the Maccabees 
Building.[84][85] In the fall of 1934, Heilmann also began broadcasting 
a football highlights show on Saturday evenings on the WXYZ and the Michigan 
Radio Network.[86] In 1936, he also broadcast out-of-town Tigers games 
on CKLW radio.[87] He also began broadcasting a sports interview show on 
WXYZ in 1936.[88] In 1937, Heilmann further expanded his radio responsibilities 
with a daily recap of the day's baseball games, broadcast at 5:30 p.m. 
on WXYZ.[89] In 1938, he continued his broadcasts of Tigers home and out-of-town 
games on WXYZ,[90][91][92] and added a 12:45 p.m. interview show with the 
fan on the street, broadcast Monday through Saturday on WXYZ.[93] As his 
popularity grew, Heilmann expanded outside the sports realm in 1939 with 
a new interview program co-hosted with WXYZ staff announcer John (Johnny) 
Slagle. The program was titled "Town Meeting" and was broadcast at 12:45 p.m. 
on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on WXYZ and the Michigan Radio Network.[94] 
In the fall of 1939, Heilmann also joined Carl Gensel on broadcasts of 
Michigan State Spartans football games.[95] Through the 1941 season, Heilmann 
was part of an unusual broadcasting arrangement. Heilmann's broadcasts 
anchored the Michigan Radio Network that stretched across Michigan, while 
Ty Tyson did play-by-play separately on WWJ for metropolitan Detroit. In 
the years of competing broadcasts, it took time for Heilmann to develop 
a following. One reporter noted: "A raspy voice, and Eastern accent and 
the contrast with Tyson's polished delivery irritated some who listened 
to Harry. There was no such thing as a Tiger fan who liked both announcers 
-- you were either a Tyson fan or a Heilmann fan, never both.[96] In 1942, 
the Tigers gave exclusive broadcast rights to WXYZ with Heilmann as the 
sole announcer. From 1942 until 1950, Heilmann became the exclusive radio 
voice of the Tigers in Detroit and throughout Michigan. He was the voice 
of the Tigers in 1940 and 1945 when the Tigers won the American League 
pennant and won the 1945 World Series over the Chicago Cubs. He became 
known for his gift as a story-teller and for his knowledge of the game. 
In 1951, Detroit Free Press sports editor Lyall Smith described Heilmann's 
broadcasting style: "In an era when radiomen frequently went into hysterics 
and fabricated spine-tingling situations, Harry was content to inform his 
listeners merely what actually happened on the diamond. These factual accounts 
were interspersed with tips on inside baseball and stories from his vast 
fund of diamond lore."[97] Baseball historian Marc Okkonen grew up listening 
to Heilmann's broadcasts and later recalled Heilmann's tendency to drop 
the letter "r" from the end of words, referring to Hal Newhouser as "Newhousa" 
and Bob Feller as "Fellah". He also recalled that one of Heilmann's sponsors 
was a fly spray called Bugaboo; when an outfielder would catch a fly ball, 
Heilmann would proclaim, "Bugaboo! Another dead fly!"[98] Okkonenen also 
recalled Heilmann's most memorable line, uttered after outstanding plays, 
when he would remain silent to emphasize the crowd noise and say, "Listen 
. . . to the voice of baseball."[98] In March 1946, Heilmann sustained 
five broken ribs and a broken chest bone in an automobile accident in Florida 
during spring training. Despite the injuries, he broadcast the Tigers games 
from opening day forward during the 1946 season.[99] On September 11, 1948, 
the Tigers held a Harry Heilmann Day at Briggs Stadium.[100] He was honored 
between games of a double-header and presented with a solid gold pass for 
all games played at Briggs Stadium.[101][102] Heilmann was married on October 
5, 1920, to Mary H. Maynes, commonly known as Mae.[103] They had a daughter, 
Mary Ellen, and a son, Harry, Jr., and lived in Detroit.[104][105] Heilmann 
was ill for much of the winter after the 1950 season. On March 14, 1951, 
he collapsed at the Tigers' spring training camp in Lakeland, Florida. 
He was hospitalized at Morrell Hospital in Lakeland, and the Detroit Free 
Press reported two days later that he was in critical condition with a 
lung condition.[106] At the end of March, after two weeks in the Lakeland 
hospital, the Tigers' owner Walter O. Briggs flew Heilmann back to Detroit 
on his private plane. Heilmann was taken by ambulance from the airport 
to Henry Ford Hospital, where he remained hospitalized.[107][108] He remained 
hospitalized through the month of April,[109] and Ty Tyson was selected 
to fill in for Heilmann on Tiger broadcasts during Heilmann's illness.[110] 
Heilmann was released from the hospital and returned home in May 1951.[111] 
On June 1, 1951, he was greeted warmly by the crowd when he and his wife 
attended a game at Briggs Stadium.[112] He also returned briefly to the 
Tiger broadcasts in early June, sharing the duties with Tyson and Paul 
Williams.[113][114] Heilmann was hospitalized again at Henry Ford Hospital 
in Detroit on June 24 as his condition worsened, and he died there on July 
9, 1951.[104][65] It was only after his death that it was disclosed that 
the nature of his illness was lung cancer.[65][115] Detroit mayor Albert 
Cobo recalled that Heilmann's radio broadcasts made him "almost a member 
of the family" to Detroiters.[104] Team owner Walter Briggs recalled Heilmann 
as one of his closest friends and said, "I doubt whether the death of any 
other person in the State of Michigan could cause more genuine regret."[116] 
The 1951 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played in Detroit on the 
day after Heilmann died and began with a moment of silence in his honor.[117][118] 
Heilmann's funeral mass was celebrated by Father Charles Coughlin at the 
Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Michigan. He was buried at the 
Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.[119][120] Over the course 
of his major league career, Heilmann appeared in 2,147 games, including 
1,525 games as a right fielder and 448 as a first baseman. He compiled 
a career batting average of .342 with a .410 on-base percentage and a .520 
slugging percentage.[1] Heilmann's notable accomplishments include the 
following: In the weeks prior to Heilmann's death, Ty Cobb led a campaign, 
supported by Arthur Daley of The New York Times and H. G. Salsinger of 
The Detroit News, to hold a special election so that Heilmann could be 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame before his death.[129][130] Heilmann 
had received 87 of 167 ballots cast (52.1%) in 1950 and 153 of 226 ballots 
cast (67.7%) in 1951, below the 75% threshold.[131][132] Heilmann died 
before action could be taken on the proposed special election, but on January 
31, 1952, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced that Heilmann would be inducted 
that summer, having garnered 203 of the 234 (86.8%) votes cast.[133] He 
was represented by his widow at the induction ceremony in July 1952.[134] 
Heilmann has continued to be recognized as one of the greatest players
