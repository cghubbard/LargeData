The Northwestern League was a minor league baseball league that operated 
from 1883 to 1884, and again from 1886 to 1887.[1] It was founded by Elias 
Matter in 1883. The original teams in the Northwestern League were the 
Peoria Reds, the Toledo Blue Stockings, the Fort Wayne Hoosiers, the Saginaw 
Greys, and teams from Bay City, Michigan; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Quincy, 
Illinois; and Springfield, Illinois. The Blue Stockings won the championship. 
In 1884, teams from Evansville, Indiana; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, 
Minnesota; Muskegon, Michigan; St. Paul, Minnesota; Stillwater, Minnesota; 
Terre Haute, Indiana; and Winona, Minnesota joined the league. The new 
teams included the original Minneapolis Millers. Springfield and Toledo 
had left the league after the 1883 season. Bay City disbanded from the 
league on July 22, and started a chain reaction. Evansville left on July 
30, and Grand Rapids and Muskegon followed suit on August 2. The season 
ended when the Millers disbanded on September 3. St. Paul and Milwaukee 
left for the Union Association on September 27. In 1886, the league was 
recreated when teams from Duluth, Minnesota; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; St. 
Paul, Minnesota, Milwaukee, and Oshkosh, Wisconsin were added to the league. 
In 1887, teams from Des Moines, Iowa; La Crosse, Wisconsin; and St. Paul 
joined the Northwestern League. Only 2 teams had left the league. Oshkosh 
won the championship. The Northwestern league was disbanded after the 1887
