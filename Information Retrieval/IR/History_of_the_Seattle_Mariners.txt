The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in 
Seattle, Washington. Enfranchised in 1977, the Mariners are a member of 
the Western Division of Major League Baseball's American League. Safeco 
Field has been the Mariners' home ballpark since July 1999. From their 
1977 inception until June 1999, the club's home park was the Kingdome. 
Before being awarded a team in Major League Baseball, Seattle had been 
a staple of the Pacific Coast League dating back to the late 19th century. 
The first attempt to land a major league team failed when a bid by William 
Daley to move the Cleveland Indians to Seattle in 1965 fell apart.[1] In 
late 1967, Daley, by then having sold the Indians, led a consortium to 
win a franchise in the 1969 expansion. That team became the Seattle Pilots.[1] 
The Seattle Pilots, amidst a bevy of financial problems, were sold and 
relocated to Milwaukee for the 1970 season and became the Milwaukee Brewers. 
The Mariners were created as a result of a lawsuit. In 1970, in the aftermath 
of the Pilots' purchase and relocation to Milwaukee by future Commissioner 
of Baseball Bud Selig, the City of Seattle, King County, and the state 
of Washington (represented by then-State Attorney General Slade Gorton) 
sued the American League for breach of contract.[2] Confident that Major 
League Baseball would return to Seattle within a few years, King County 
built the multi-purpose Kingdome, which would become home to the NFL's 
expansion Seattle Seahawks in 1976. The Pilots lawsuit continued until 
1976. At trial, the American League offered to give Seattle an expansion 
baseball franchise in return for dropping the suit,[2] and details were 
ironed out over the next year. To keep the league with an even number of 
teams, a formal expansion proceeding was held, with a second team, the 
Blue Jays, being awarded to the city of Toronto (also allowing both leagues 
to place a team in Canada, the National League's Montreal Expos having 
been established in 1969). The new Seattle team, to begin play in 1977, 
would be owned by entertainer Danny Kaye, along with Stanley Golub, Walter 
Schoenfeld, Lester Smith, James Stillwell, Jr. and James A. Walsh. The 
name "Mariners" was chosen by club officials in August 1976 from over 600 
names submitted by 15,000 entrants in a name-the-team contest.[3] The Mariners 
played their first game on April 6, 1977, to a sold-out crowd of 57,762 
at the Kingdome, losing 7–0 to the California Angels.[4] The first home 
run in team history was hit on April 10, 1977, by designated hitter Juan 
Bernhardt.[5] That year, star pitcher Diego Seguí, in his last major league 
season, became the only player to play for both the Pilots and the Mariners. 
The Mariners finished with a 64–98 record, echoing the record the 1969 
Pilots once held. In 1979, Seattle hosted the 50th Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game. After the 1981 season, the Mariners were sold to California 
businessman and future U.S. Ambassador to Spain George Argyros. Despite 
having stars such as Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry (nicknamed the 
"Ancient Mariner"), 1984 American League Rookie of the Year Alvin Davis, 
two-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner Harold Reynolds, three-time 
American League strikeout leader Mark Langston, and shortstop and team 
captain Spike Owen on their rosters, the Mariners teams of the late 1970s 
and the entirety of the 1980s were characterized by perennial non-achievement, 
gaining a reputation for poor performances, low attendance, and losing 
records. Moreover, the team's ownership again changed hands after the 1988 
season, as Argyros sold the club to a group headed by communications magnate 
Jeff Smulyan. However, the 1989 rookie season of center fielder Ken Griffey, 
Jr., acquired with the first overall pick of the 1987 amateur draft, gave 
fans hope that a change of fortunes might be on the horizon. The Mariners 
finished with a losing record in 1990 to start off the decade.[6] After 
yet another dismal performance in 1990, the Mariners managed their first 
winning season in 1991, finishing 83–79 under manager Jim Lefebvre. Though 
it was the team's best season up to that point, it was only good enough 
for a fifth-place finish in the seven-team American League West in which 
no team finished under .500, and Lefebvre was fired after 1991. The team 
hired Bill Plummer as Lefebvre's replacement for the 1992 season, but he 
too was let go after a 98-loss campaign in 1992. After several years of 
relocation threats by owner Jeff Smulyan, in the middle of the 1992 season 
the Mariners were purchased by a group of Seattle-area businessmen, led 
by Nintendo chairman Hiroshi Yamauchi.[7] The purchase was initially opposed 
by baseball officials, who objected to a team being owned by a non-North 
American entity. Eventually, they allowed the sale, provided that the team's 
presidency and chairmanship remained in the hands of American partners. 
In 1993, the Mariners donned their current uniforms. During the 1992–93 
offseason, the Mariners hired manager Lou Piniella, who had led the Cincinnati 
Reds to victory in the 1990 World Series. Mariner fans embraced Piniella,[8] 
and he would helm the team from 1993 through 2002, winning two American 
League Manager of the Year Awards along the way. The Mariners' fortunes 
began to improve in 1994. Beginning in the late 1980s, the team had added 
a core of strong players built around center fielder Ken Griffey, Jr., 
pitcher Randy Johnson, third baseman Edgar Martínez, and right fielder 
Jay Buhner. On July 19, 1994, four 15-pound ceiling tiles fell from the 
Kingdome roof onto the field and into the stadium's seating bowl. The incident 
led to uncertainty over whether the Kingdome was fit for use as a major 
league stadium, and may well have ultimately been a factor leading to the 
construction of Safeco Field. Unable to play at the venue while repairs 
were being executed, the Major League Baseball Players' Association rejected 
the idea of playing games at Cheney Stadium in Tacoma or BC Place in Vancouver, 
feeling that games should not be played in non-MLB venues. This forced 
the Mariners to play their next 20 games on the road over the span of 21 
days. The long trip began miserably as the Mariners started off 2–8, but 
rebounded to win nine of their next ten games, leaving them just 2 games 
behind the division-leading Texas Rangers when a players' strike was called 
on August 12 that resulted in the cancellation of the rest of the season. 
Many players felt the time together on the road and the overcoming of the 
adversity faced that season fed directly into the success the team would 
achieve in the 1995 season.[9] The extended roadtrip resulted in a peculiarity, 
in which the first game in a series with the Boston Red Sox – which was 
supposed to be in Seattle – was rained out; if one still counts this as 
a home game, it would mark the first – and so far only – home rainout in 
Mariners history (Safeco Field has a retractable roof, so games can either 
be played indoors or outdoors, always indoors when it is raining). Although 
pitchers Randy Johnson, Bill Risley, and Bobby Ayala combined for an opening-day 
three-hit shutout, the Mariners' 1995 season started off on a bad note 
overall, as Griffey sustained a major early-season injury. Despite this 
loss, the Mariners continued to play fairly well, guided by Piniella. In 
mid-August, however, the Mariners appeared to be out of contention, 13 
games behind the first-place California Angels. In September, a ballot 
measure for a new stadium for the M's was shot down by King County voters. 
However, luck would turn their way that month. The tide turned with a September 
winning streak marked by late-inning comeback wins, which led to their 
most-known slogan "Refuse to Lose." Combined with an absolute collapse 
by the Angels, this opened the way for the Mariners to end up tied with 
the Angels for first place at the end of the regular season, forcing a 
one-game playoff. The playoff pitted Johnson against Angels ace Mark Langston, 
whom, incidentally, the Mariners had traded for Johnson in 1989. Langston 
ended up on the seat of his pants at homeplate failing to tag out Luis 
Sojo who came all the way around after clearing the bases with a ball that 
got by the Angels first baseman, J. T. Snow, rattled around underneath 
California's bullpen bench, and resulted in a hurried and errant cut-off 
throw from Langston. The Mariners won the tiebreaker game 9–1 and clinched 
their first-ever trip to the playoffs. The Mariners had won 25 of their 
last 36 games. The Mariners lost the first two games of the 1995 American 
League Division Series against the New York Yankees, but managed to win 
the next two at home and force a decisive Game 5. Down 5–4 in the bottom 
of the 11th inning, the most memorable moment in Mariners history took 
place. Edgar Martínez hit a game-winning double off Yankee ace Jack McDowell, 
scoring Joey Cora and Griffey to win the game 6–5 and advance to the American 
League Championship Series. "The Double", as Martínez's clutch hit has 
since been called by Mariners fans, is credited as being "the moment that 
saved baseball in Seattle" by generating newly refreshed interest in the 
team and making a new, baseball-only stadium possible. Soon after, the 
Washington State Legislature approved funding for what would eventually 
become Safeco Field, a retractable-roof stadium, built near the Kingdome 
(which itself would be demolished in 2000, with the Seahawks' new stadium, 
now known as CenturyLink Field, now occupying the same site). Mariner commentator 
Dave Niehaus' call on the play is still remembered by many Mariner fans:[10] 
The quote is featured in a tribute song, "My Oh My", released in December 
2010 by Seattle rapper Macklemore after Niehaus died of a heart attack 
in November. On April 8, 2011, Mariners Opening Day, Macklemore performed 
the song in honor of Niehaus. Although the Mariners' championship run was 
halted in the ALCS by another up-and-coming club, Mike Hargrove's Cleveland 
Indians, who won the series 4 games to 2, 1995 is remembered as "The Magical 
Season" and "The Miracle Mariners of 1995" with "The Double" still considered 
by many the greatest moment in Mariners history.[11] In 1996, the Mariners, 
led by Griffey, rookie shortstop Alex Rodriguez, and sluggers Jay Buhner 
and Edgar Martínez, won a then-team record 85 games, but missed the playoffs. 
The offense set the all-time record for most home runs by a team in a season, 
but ultimately the Mariners' inconsistent pitching, exacerbated by a midseason 
injury to Randy Johnson, doomed the team.[12] The Mariners hit a Major-league 
record 264 home runs and won a division title again in 1997, but were defeated 
in the 1997 American League Division Series 3 games to 1 by the Baltimore 
Orioles. They were again hurt by a lack of pitching depth to complement 
the strong offense,[13] which was led by Griffey, who won the MVP award, 
a first for both him and the Mariners. In 1998 and 1999, the Mariners had 
losing records due primarily to their lack of pitching depth. Randy Johnson 
was traded at the 1998 July non-waiver trading deadline to the Houston 
Astros after GM Woody Woodard publicly stated he did not intend on offering 
Johnson (who was a free agent following the 1998 season) a long-term contract.[14] 
Johnson subsequently requested to be traded. He had been inconsistent during 
the first half of the season; some fans and press thought he had been trying 
to force a trade through malaise.[15] Strong pitching from aces Jeff Fassero 
and Jamie Moyer was not enough to fully offset the loss, and the bullpen's 
struggles continued. Midway through the 1999 season, the Mariners moved 
to Safeco Field. After the 1999 season, Ken Griffey, Jr. requested and 
attained a trade to the Cincinnati Reds, leaving Alex Rodriguez as the 
face of the franchise at the beginning of the high-expectation Safeco Field 
era, which was during the years 2000–03. 2000 was a return to respectability 
for the Mariners. They finished half a game behind the Oakland Athletics 
in the AL West, as they played only 161 games. The tiebreaking rules had 
already awarded the division crown to Oakland, so the rained out 162nd 
game was not made up, and the Mariners were declared wild card winners. 
While Ken Griffey, Jr. was no longer patrolling center or anchoring the 
middle of the batting order, his replacement, Mike Cameron, was noted for 
his solid hitting and exceptional glovework (he would go on to win two 
Gold Gloves with the team). Alex Rodriguez replaced Junior as the face 
of the franchise in 2000. Edgar Martínez continued his steady hitting in 
the cleanup spot, putting up a career high in homers. Both finished in 
the top six in MVP voting.[16] A key addition to the team occurred when 
the Mariners signed the one-time AL Batting Champion John Olerud, a Washington 
State University graduate and Seattle native, to play first base. Olerud 
would enjoy some of his best seasons in Seattle, and played a huge part 
in the team's success the following year. Jamie Moyer, Freddy García, and 
Aaron Sele anchored what was easily the most successful rotation in Seattle 
since the departure of Randy Johnson. Closer Kazuhiro Sasaki, previously 
a star for the Japanese Yokohama BayStars, won the AL Rookie of the Year 
award. Stolen base king and former MVP Rickey Henderson was acquired midseason 
and filled longtime needs in left field and in the leadoff slot. The Mariners 
swept the Chicago White Sox in the ALDS, but lost to the New York Yankees 
in six games in the ALCS. The following offseason was one of the most significant 
in Mariners history, as Rodríguez was up for free agency. Ultimately, Rodríguez 
was lost to the Texas Rangers for what was then the richest contract ever 
in professional sports. However, the Mariners were able to weather the 
loss by adding Japanese superstar Ichiro Suzuki and slick-fielding, power-hitting 
second base veteran Bret Boone. In 2001, the addition of Ichiro and a career 
season by Boone helped the Mariners to tie the record for most wins in 
the modern era. This was despite the loss of Rodriguez, who would be greeted 
on his return to Safeco with Monopoly money dropped by unusually irate 
Seattle fans, and on subsequent returns by incessant booing.[17] The 2001 
Mariners led the major leagues in winning percentage all season long, easily 
winning the American League West division championship, breaking the 1998 
Yankees American League single-season record of 114 wins, and matching 
the Major League Baseball record for single-season wins of 116 set by the 
Chicago Cubs in 1906. At the end of the season, Ichiro won the AL MVP, 
AL Rookie of the Year, and one of three outfield Gold Glove Awards, becoming 
the first player since the 1975 Boston Red Sox's Fred Lynn to win all three 
in the same season. He has been the subject of several books (including 
one released in the summer of 2001 that consists solely of his zen-like 
quotations). The Mariners also hosted the All-Star Game in July of that 
year, and had a league-leading and team record eight All-Stars: RF Ichiro 
Suzuki, DH Edgar Martínez, CF Mike Cameron, 2B Bret Boone, 1B John Olerud, 
and pitchers Freddy Garcia, Kazuhiro Sasaki, and Jeff Nelson. The Mariners 
pulled off a come-from-behind 3–2 series win over the Cleveland Indians 
in the Division Series to advance to the American League Championship Series 
to have a rematch with the New York Yankees, but succumbed to the Yankees 
for the second year in a row in the ALCS, 4 games to 1. Interestingly enough, 
they went 116–46 in the regular season, but just 4–6 in the postseason. 
The Mariners started the 2002 season hot (they were on pace to win 100+ 
games again well into the summer), but they missed out on the playoffs. 
This was widely attributed to their failure to find a substantial contributor 
at the trade deadline[18] and hot streaks by the Anaheim Angels and Oakland 
Athletics in the later months of the season. Ultimately, the Angels won 
the World Series as the Mariners won 93 games, which was still the second 
best total in their history. At the end of the season, manager Lou Piniella 
left the Mariners to manage his hometown Tampa Bay Devil Rays, reportedly 
due to his anger with management; Piniella believed that management was 
more concerned with the bottom line than acquiring quality players.[19] 
The Mariners signed Bob Melvin to be their new manager. The local press 
speculated that a first year manager (especially someone more even-tempered 
than the fiery Piniella) would be easier for the front office and ownership 
to control.[20] The Mariners again got off to an excellent start in the 
2003 season. They contended all season long and reached the same record 
as in 2002, but were again beaten to the playoffs by their division rival 
Oakland Athletics, highlighted by a six-game losing streak in late August 
that saw their lead evaporate, which they would never recover. Their failure 
to make the playoffs was again blamed on management's inability to bring 
in a bat at the trading deadline and the aging roster's decline. Notably, 
the debate was started by pitcher Jeff Nelson, who was himself traded after 
criticizing the front office's deadline inactivity.[21] General manager 
Pat Gillick became a consultant midway through the offseason to make room 
for new GM Bill Bavasi. With the exception of the 1998 and 1999 seasons, 
the Mariners had been annual challengers for the AL West title from 1995 
through 2003. The 2004 season, however, saw the fall of the Mariners from 
contention. With an aging roster, the Mariners went into the All-Star Break 
with a 9-game losing streak, and a 32–54 season record (.372) 17 games 
behind the first-place Texas Rangers. After the All-Star break, unable 
to ignore the dreadful state of their team, the Mariners gave the team 
a complete overhaul, trading Freddy García to the Chicago White Sox for 
Miguel Olivo, Jeremy Reed, and Mike Morse and moving aging and struggling 
players away from center stage (most notably, releasing Gold Glover and 
fan favorite John Olerud) and inserting over a dozen minor league call-ups 
into the 25-man roster. The season's end was enlivened by Ichiro breaking 
George Sisler's single season record of 257 hits (finishing with 262) and 
by events honoring the retirement of Mariner icon Edgar Martínez. Just 
days after the end of the season, the Mariners fired manager Bob Melvin. 
On October 20, 2004, the Mariners announced the signing of Mike Hargrove, 
who had led the Cleveland Indians past the Mariners in the 1995 ALCS, as 
their new manager. In the offseason, the Mariners and Bavasi surprised 
fans and the local press by signing two premier free agents, third baseman 
Adrián Beltré and first baseman Richie Sexson, ending some accusations 
from fans that the organization was only willing to make piecemeal signings 
and trades.[22] On November 26, 2004, the owner of the Mariners changed: 
Hiroshi Yamauchi sold his 54 % stake to Nintendo of America.[23] Despite 
several personnel changes and free-agent signings after the 2004 season, 
the team stayed at the bottom of the divisional standings throughout the 
2005 season and finished in last place, though they improved their record 
by six games compared to the previous year. The brightest spot of the season 
was the emergence of 19-year-old Venezuelan pitching prospect Félix Hernández, 
who became the youngest major leaguer to debut since José Rijo entered 
the league with the New York Yankees in 1984. Sexson also played very well, 
hitting 39 home runs and 121 RBI. Stars Ichiro and Beltre, however, did 
not reach their high levels of offensive production from 2004, and 2B Bret 
Boone was released before the All-Star break. Along with Hernández, two 
rookie middle infielders became part of the Mariners' long term plans: 
Cuban defector and shortstop Yuniesky Betancourt and Venezuelan second 
baseman and former top prospect José López became the next season's starters. 
However, the Mariners' rotation beyond Hernández and the aging Jamie Moyer 
was poor, and the Mariners suffered the embarrassment of having the most 
suspendees under MLB's new drug testing policy,[24] notably pitcher Ryan 
Franklin and IF/OF Mike Morse. During the 2005–2006 off-season, Ichiro 
spoke out and criticized the team's attitude, pointing out its lack of 
leadership and manager Hargrove's failure to harness players.[25] The Mariners 
began the 2005–2006 off-season by signing star Japanese catcher Kenji Johjima 
to a 3-year deal and left-handed starter Jarrod Washburn (formerly of division 
rival Los Angeles) to a 4-year deal. Designated hitter Carl Everett and 
outfielder Matt Lawton also joined the team, although both would finish 
the season out of baseball. The Mariners entered the All-Star Break 2.5 
games out of first place in the AL West with a 43–46 record. Despite remaining 
in contention within the AL West through July, a disastrous 0–11 road trip 
in mid-August signaled the end of the Mariners' playoff hopes, leaving 
them in last place, where they would finish the season. Pitcher Jamie Moyer 
was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for a pair of minor league prospects, 
and weeks later bench coach Ron Hassey and administrative coach Dan Rohn—whom 
many viewed as a prime candidate to replace Hargrove as manager[26]—were 
removed from their positions with the team. At season's end, the Mariners 
had only narrowly avoided losing 90 games for the third consecutive year. 
While the team entered the 2006–2007 off-season with some young talent 
in key positions, many questions remained as to the consistency of their 
offense and, more importantly, the strength of their starting pitching 
staff. The 2007 season began with a sense of muted optimism.[27][28] While 
the team had a busy off-season in terms of changes to the roster, fans 
questioned player transactions that moved young, potential-filled players 
(Rafael Soriano, Chris Snelling) in favor of veterans who have suffered 
injuries in recent seasons (José Guillén, José Vidro, Horacio Ramírez) 
or who have achieved mediocre success in the past with other clubs (Miguel 
Batista, Jeff Weaver).[29] These transactions followed CEO Howard Lincoln's 
remarks at the completion of the 2006 campaign that GM Bill Bavasi and 
manager Mike Hargrove were on his "hot seat" and needed to produce more 
wins in 2007.[28] Further magnifying the need to win was outfielder Ichiro 
Suzuki's suggestion at the beginning of spring training that he may have 
an interest in testing free-agency waters when his contract is completed 
at the end of the season if the Mariners continue to struggle on the field.[30] 
After two and a half seasons with the Mariners and while guiding the team 
to a 44–33 record in the 2007 season, Mike Hargrove unexpectedly announced 
before the July 1, 2007 game against the Toronto Blue Jays that the game 
would be his last as the Mariners' manager. Hargrove said that he could 
no longer provide the commitment from himself that he was expecting of 
his players and coaches. Bench coach John McLaren was announced as Hargrove's 
replacement.[31] On July 13, Ichiro Suzuki signed a 5-year, $90 million 
contract with the Mariners that extended to 2012.[32] With minor league 
prospect Adam Jones playing well and a fairly consistent offense and pitching 
staff, the 2007 Mariners were back in contention in the AL West and AL 
Wild Card races. However, a 3–15 stretch late in the season effectively 
ended the Mariners' 2007 playoff hopes. The Mariners were mathematically 
eliminated from contention on September 24.[33] One highlight during this 
stretch, however, was the home run that gave Ichiro Suzuki 200 hits for 
his seventh consecutive 200-hit season; Ichiro is only the third player 
in MLB history with seven consecutive 200-hit seasons, and the first to 
do it in his first seven seasons.[34] Heading into the 2008 season, the 
Mariners hoped to capitalize on their 2007 success by bolstering their 
roster to position themselves to once again challenge the Angels for the 
AL West championship. They dramatically transformed their pitching staff, 
adding free agent Carlos Silva and trading a package of players led by 
George Sherrill and Adam Jones to the Baltimore Orioles on February 8 for 
Érik Bédard. Other additions included outfielder Brad Wilkerson and infielder 
Miguel Cairo, as well as a new coaching staff under McLaren featuring former 
MLB managers Jim Riggleman, Sam Perlozzo, Lee Elia, and pitching coach 
Mel Stottlemyre. Also added to the major league coaching staff was bullpen 
coach Norm Charlton, a member of the 1995, 1997, and 2001 AL West title 
teams, as well as Eddie Rodriguez, previously manager of the Mariners' 
Class AA minor league affiliate. Hitting coach Jeff Pentland remained as 
the only coach hired under Hargrove. Despite their offseason additions, 
the 2008 Mariners featured one of the league's worst offenses. In April, 
the club attempted to solve some of its offensive woes by designating Wilkerson 
and pinch hitter Greg Norton for assignment.[35] The offensive struggles, 
in concert with defensive lapses and inconsistent pitching from both the 
bullpen and the starting rotation, led the team to last place by the end 
of April despite an Opening Day payroll of nearly $117 million.[36] On 
June 8, the Mariners held the worst record in baseball with a .349 winning 
percentage, and were on pace for 105 losses and the worst record in team 
history. Hitting coach Pentland was fired on June 9 and was replaced by 
Lee Elia, who was previously the Mariners' hitting instructor from 1993–1997.[37] 
Following a 1–5 homestand, general manager Bill Bavasi was dismissed on 
June 16 and replaced by Lee Pelekoudas on an interim basis.[38] Pelekoudas 
had held various front office positions with the Mariners since 1980, most 
recently as vice president/assistant general manager. The purge continued 
on June 19, when John McLaren was dismissed from his position and replaced 
by bench coach Jim Riggleman.[39] Personnel moves of that sort were not 
limited to coaches and front office personnel in 2008, as Richie Sexson 
and José Vidro were released in July and August, respectively. On September 
1, the Mariners were the first team in baseball mathematically eliminated 
from the playoffs. They finished the season with 101 losses, only one fewer 
than the MLB-worst Washington Nationals. The 2008 Mariners became the first 
team in major league history to have a payroll of $100 million or more 
while accumulating 100 or more losses. 2008 did have a handful of noteworthy 
achievements, however: On June 23, pitcher Félix Hernández hit a grand 
slam off of the New York Mets' Johan Santana, becoming the first pitcher 
in franchise history to hit a home run, as well as the first AL pitcher 
to hit a grand slam since 1971 (and the first ever in modern Interleague 
play).[40] On September 1, third baseman Adrián Beltré became the fourth 
Mariner to hit for the cycle. Beltré's cycle came hours after Stephen Drew 
of the Arizona Diamondbacks hit for the cycle, marking the second time 
in MLB history – and the first since 1920 – that two players accomplished 
the feat on the same day. On September 17, Ichiro tied Willie Keeler's 
record of 8 consecutive 200-hit seasons, matching a mark that has stood 
since 1901.[41] On October 22, 2008 the Mariners announced the hiring of 
Jack Zduriencik, formerly scouting director of the Milwaukee Brewers, as 
their general manager.[42] Weeks later, on November 18, the team named 
Oakland Athletics bench coach Don Wakamatsu as its new field manager. Wakamatsu 
and Zduriencik hired an entirely new coaching staff for 2009, which included 
former World Series MVP John Wetteland as bullpen coach. The off-season 
also saw a litany of roster moves, headlined by a 12-player, 3-team trade 
that included sending All-Star closer J. J. Putz to the New York Mets and 
brought 5 players—including prospect Mike Carp and outfielder Endy Chávez 
from New York and outfielder Franklin Gutierrez from the Cleveland Indians—to 
Seattle. Many of the moves, like the free agent signing of Mike Sweeney, 
were made in part with the hope of squelching the clubhouse infighting 
that plagued the Mariners in 2008.[43] On February 18, the Mariners signed 
Ken Griffey, Jr. to a one-year contract, returning him to the city where 
he played from 1989–1999 and was named a member of the All-Century Team. 
Griffey was re-issued his old uniform number, 24, which had not been issued 
to any on-field personnel since his February 2000 trade to Cincinnati. 
On April 15, Griffey hit his 400th home run in a Mariners uniform, becoming 
the only player to hit 400 home runs with one club (Seattle) and 200 with 
another (Cincinnati). On March 31, Ichiro was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list for the first time in his Major League career, after being diagnosed 
with a bleeding ulcer; on April 15, he hit a grand slam in the first game 
upon his return from the DL. On April 16, Ichiro recorded his 3,086th hit 
in a combined career between Nippon Professional Baseball and Major League 
Baseball, breaking the record among Japanese-born professional players 
previously held by Isao Harimoto, who attended the game in Seattle. On, 
September 16, Ichiro hit his 200th hit for the ninth consecutive season, 
eclipsing the record held by "Wee" Willie Keeler.[44] On October 4, the 
final game of the year, Félix Hernández continued his Cy Young candidacy, 
and won his 19th game, the 85th for the Mariners. Mariners legend Ken Griffey, 
Jr. hit a single in the 8th inning and was lifted for pinch-runner Michael 
Saunders, to a long standing ovation, in what was then thought to be the 
final at-bat of his Hall of Fame career. The Mariners became the 13th team 
in MLB history to have a winning season after losing 100+ games the previous 
season. After the final out, fans saluted the much-improved Mariners, having 
won 24 more games than the year before. The team took a victory lap around 
the park in return, which ended with the team carrying Griffey (and eventually 
Ichiro) on their shoulders, before leaving the field. Among their 85 victories, 
an MLB season-high 35 were 1-run triumphs, as well as 13 walk-off wins. 
As of November 11, 2009, it was announced that Griffey would return to 
the Mariners for the 2010 campaign with a similar contract to that of 2009. 
He looked to make $2 million with an additional $3 million in incentives. 
The Mariners showed that they wanted to contend in the A.L. West by signing 
Chone Figgins to a four-year, $36 million contract,[45] and by trading 
prospects to the Philadelphia Phillies for former Cy Young Award winner 
Cliff Lee.[46] Seattle continued to be aggressive during the 2009–2010 
offseason trading pitcher Carlos Silva and cash to the Chicago Cubs for 
outfielder Milton Bradley. On June 2, 2010 Ken Griffey, Jr. announced his 
retirement after 22 MLB seasons.[47] Griffey ended his career with 630 
home runs, fifth-highest in MLB history, 10 Gold Gloves, and one Most Valuable 
Player Award.[48] On August 10, 2010 the Mariners fired field manager Don 
Wakamatsu along with bench coach Ty Van Burkleo, pitching coach Rick Adair 
and performance coach Steve Hecht. Daren Brown, the manager of the AAA 
affiliate Tacoma Rainiers, took over as interim field manager. Roger Hansen, 
the former Minor League catching coordinator, was promoted to bench coach. 
Carl Willis, the former Minor League pitching coordinator, was promoted 
to pitching coach.[49] On October 19, 2010 the Mariners hired former Cleveland 
Indians manager Eric Wedge as their new manager. Carl Willis was retained 
as pitching coach. This came after a 61–101 season where many experts predicted 
in the preseason the Mariners would finish 1st or 2nd in their division. 
This tied the record for worst season with the 2008 team. On December 6, 
2013 the Seattle Mariners came to an agreement with former Yankee superstar 
second baseman Robinson Canó. The contract was to last for 10 years at 
approximately $240 million, making Cano the third highest paid baseball 
player in history, trailing Alex Rodriguez' 10-year, $275 million deal 
in 2008, and tied with Albert Pujols' 10-year, $240 million deal in 2012. 
In 2014, the Mariners had their first winning season since 2009, putting 
up a 87–75 record, and stayed in playoff contention until the final game 
of the season, when the Oakland Athletics beat the Texas Rangers to clinch 
the second Wild Card spot in the American League. Félix Hernández broke 
a major league record by having sixteen straight games with at least seven 
innings pitched and giving up two or less earned runs. Hernandez also came 
in second in American League Cy Young Award voting, with Corey Kluber of 
the Cleveland Indians edging Felix by ten voting points.[50] Kyle Seager 
won the first Gold Glove of his career at third base.[51] In 2016, Nintendo 
of America will sell most of its franchise shares to First Avenue Entertainment,
