The Missouri Sports Hall of Fame is located in Springfield, Missouri, United 
States. Founded by Springfield businessman John Q. Hammons[1] in 1994, 
the Hall of Fame showcases over 4,000 items of sports memorabilia[2] and 
exhibits related to Missouri amateur and professional athletics. The two-story, 
32,000 square foot building also features a number of interactive presentations 
that allow visitors to experience auto racing in the NASCAR simulator, 
step into the batters box against a Major League Baseball pitcher, throw 
football passes, and much more.[3] Adjacent to the Hall is the Legends 
Walk of Fame, a plaza-like outdoor setting featuring busts and statuary 
of notable Show-Me state sports figures honored with the yearly Legends 
Award.[2] In order to be considered for the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame 
an individual or team must have Nominees are presented to a selection board 
who then choose which will be inducted into the Hall. As the number of 
inductees has steadily grown each year, a series of regional events is 
held around the state rather than having all new inductees travel to Springfield. 
Individuals are the most common inductees although in some instances entire 
teams that have performed in an exemplary manner or businesses that have 
been strong supporters of athletics in Missouri have also been enshrined
