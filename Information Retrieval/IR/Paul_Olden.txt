Paul Olden is the current public address announcer for the New York Yankees 
at Yankee Stadium. He has been the announcer since the Yankees moved to 
their new ballpark in 2009. Born in Chicago, Olden moved with his family 
to Los Angeles as a child.[1] He attended Dorsey High School and Los Angeles 
City College. Olden was formerly a radio and television play-by-play announcer 
for the Yankees, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, California Angels, Cleveland Indians, 
Philadelphia Eagles, UCLA Bruins, Los Angeles Rams, New York Jets and New 
Jersey Nets.[2] Olden was the target of Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy 
Lasorda's infamous and profanity laden "Dave Kingman tirade" in 1978, in 
which Lasorda ranted at Olden (who worked at Los Angeles radio station 
KLAC at the time) when he asked him about Kingman having hit three home 
runs against the Dodgers that day.[3] He was also the PA announcer for 
12 consecutive Super Bowls from 1994 to 2005.[4] Olden replaced Jim Hall, 
who replaced Bob Sheppard, who had been the Yankees announcer since 1951.[5][6]
