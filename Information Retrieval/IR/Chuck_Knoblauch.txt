Edward Charles "Chuck" Knoblauch (/ˈnɒblɔːk/; born July 7, 1968) is a retired 
Major League Baseball player. He played all or part of twelve seasons in 
the majors, from 1991 until 2002, for the Minnesota Twins (1991–97), New 
York Yankees (1998–2001) and Kansas City Royals (2002). He played mostly 
as a second baseman before moving to left field for his last two seasons. 
Born in Houston, Texas, Knoblauch came from a baseball family, as his uncle 
Eddie Knoblauch and father Ray Knoblauch played and managed in the minor 
leagues between the late 1930s and mid-1950s.[1] He was drafted in the 
18th round of the 1986 amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, but 
did not sign. Then, Knoblauch went on to play college baseball for Texas 
A&M University in College Station, where he was a second team All-American. 
He later played on the 1989 team that finished the season with 58 wins, 
which is the highest total in school history.[2] Knoblauch was drafted 
by the Minnesota Twins in the 1st round of the 1989 MLB draft. Knoblauch 
won the American League Rookie of the Year award and a World Series ring 
as a member of the 1991 Minnesota Twins. In Game 7 of the World Series, 
Knoblauch attempted to deceive Lonnie Smith by appearing to start a double 
play on a Terry Pendleton double (causing Smith to get only to 3rd base 
when he might have scored for the Atlanta Braves). Smith claimed that he 
lost track of the ball, and that Knoblauch's decoy with shortstop Greg 
Gagne had little to do with his base-running. During the 1994–96 seasons, 
Knoblauch batted .312, .333, and .341, won the AL Gold Glove Award at second 
base in 1997, and became renowned for his speed—stealing over 40 bases 
in three consecutive seasons. After the 1997 season, Knoblauch was traded 
to the Yankees in exchange for four players (including two future All-Stars, 
Eric Milton and Cristian Guzmán) and US$3 million. Once a popular player 
in Minnesota, his very outspoken request to be traded away from the Twins 
ensured he would be roundly jeered on every successive trip to the Metrodome. 
This included throwing hot dogs, beer bottles, and golf balls at Knoblauch 
during a visit to the Metrodome in 2001.[3] Knoblauch's arrival in New 
York was greeted with wide anticipation. Buster Olney, then with the New 
York Times and now one of ESPN's premier baseball analysts, predicted that 
Knoblauch and Derek Jeter would form the greatest double play combination 
in history.[4] Though he struggled early on with the team, he hit a career-high 
17 home runs as the Yankees won a then-American League record 114 games. 
In the 1998 postseason against the Cleveland Indians, Knoblauch committed 
a serious blunder, arguing with an umpire as play continued. Instead of 
chasing down the ball that was in play, Knoblauch argued with the umpire 
as Enrique Wilson scored from first base, giving Cleveland a 2–1 lead in 
the 12th inning. The Indians would go on to win the game, 4–1. A New York 
newspaper called him "Blauch-head."[5] However, Knoblauch recovered and 
was an important factor in the World Series victory over the San Diego 
Padres, and the 1999 win over the Atlanta Braves. In Game 3 of the 1999 
series, Knoblauch scored the game's first run, and also hit a dramatic 
two-run home run in the eighth inning to tie the score, with the Yankees 
eventually winning in the 10th. In the 2001 World Series, Game 5, Knoblauch 
scored the winning run, having led off with a single and scoring on a single 
by his replacement at 2nd base, Alfonso Soriano. This game became known 
as "Deja Vu—It ain't over til it's over—All Over Again" game, the second 
consecutive night that the Yankees tied in the bottom of the 9th with two 
outs, and then won in extra innings. The Yankees won the American League 
pennant every year he was with the team, winning three World Series championships. 
Towards the end of his career, Knoblauch's performance at the plate grew 
worse, with many observers believing he was preoccupied by his fielding 
troubles and trying too hard to hit home runs. Knoblauch was benched in 
the final game of the 2001 World Series (he hit just .056), and left for 
Kansas City as a free agent in the offseason. Knoblauch played in just 
80 games in left field for the Royals, batting a meager .210, and the team 
declined to offer him a new contract the following year. In 2003, having 
failed to gain a job with a major league team, Knoblauch announced his 
retirement. Once considered one of the game's best fielders (in fact, ESPN 
personalities nicknamed him "Fundamentally Sound" Chuck Knoblauch), Knoblauch's 
play deteriorated shortly into his Yankee career; his errors at second 
doubled from 13 in 1998 to 26 the following year; none of these was a throwing 
error. In 2000, he began to have difficulty making accurate throws to first 
base, a condition sometimes referred to in baseball as "the yips" or "Steve 
Sax Syndrome" in more recent years. Knoblauch tried various solutions to 
his problem, but his throwing would not improve. He made fifteen errors 
in less than half a season in 2000, including ten throwing miscues. (During 
one game, an errant throw sailed into the stands and hit sportscaster Keith 
Olbermann's mother in the head.)[6] After making three throwing errors 
in six innings of the Yankees' 12–3 loss to the Chicago White Sox, on 15 
June 2000, Knoblauch voluntarily left the game. He then left Yankee Stadium 
in his street clothes while the game was still in progress.[7] He was back 
at second the next day, but, stumping commentators, fans, and himself, 
Knoblauch never fully recovered his throwing accuracy, especially after 
missing most of the month of August with an injury. Knoblauch returned 
to the Yankees in September, but was often used as a designated hitter 
in lieu of playing second; he was exclusively a DH in the Yankees' run 
to a World Series title. Finally, in 2001, he was reassigned to left field 
by manager Joe Torre, never to return to his old position. On September 
25, 2009, an officer from the Memorial Villages Police Department, near 
Houston, was told by Knoblauch's common-law wife, Stacey Victoria Stelmach, 
that he hit and choked her. A police officer's affidavit[8] alleged that 
"redness around her neck and swelling near her eye [were] consistent with 
her statement."[8] On September 29, 2009, the Harris County, Texas District 
Attorney charged Knoblauch with assaulting a family member by choking, 
a third-degree felony in Texas.[8][9] Knoblauch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
assault in connection with the case on March 16, 2010.[10] The couple was 
reportedly going through a divorce.[11] On July 24, 2014, the 46-year-old 
Knoblauch was charged with assault of a family member, Cheri Knoblauch, 
whom he divorced in 2012.[12] Because of this incident, the Twins canceled 
their planned induction of Knoblauch into the Twins Hall of Fame.[13] A 
four-time All-Star, in his career Knoblauch batted .289 with 98 home runs 
and 615 runs batted in. He stole 25 or more bases in 10 of his 12 seasons, 
finishing with 407 in his career – including 276 with the Twins, the most 
for the team since its move from Washington in 1961. In December 2007, 
Knoblauch was included in the Mitchell Report which provided detailed evidence 
that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his career. In the Mitchell 
report, Brian McNamee states that he procured Human Growth Hormone (HGH) 
from Kirk Radomski for Knoblauch in 2001 when he served as the New York 
Yankees assistant strength coach. McNamee states that during the season, 
he injected Knoblauch seven to nine times with HGH. McNamee states that 
Knoblauch paid Radomski for the drugs through him or Jason Grimsley, and 
also believed that Knoblauch obtained HGH from Grimsley. Knoblauch did 
not respond to a request to meet with the Mitchell investigators to discuss 
the allegations.[14] On December 20, 2007 Knoblauch was also named in Jason 
Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as an alleged user of HGH. Knoblauch and 
Grimsley were teammates on the 1999–2000 New York Yankees.[15] On January 
11, 2008, the New York Times published a rare look at Chuck Knoblauch's 
post-baseball life. The article painted Knoblauch's outlook on baseball 
and The Mitchell Report as being apathetic. As he has been retired for 
5 years, he expressed "bewilderment at his inclusion" in the report and 
stated that "I have nothing to defend and I have nothing to hide at the 
same time." As of January 2008, Chuck Knoblauch owned a condominium in 
Houston, and a house in the Houston area, and was not interested in returning 
to professional baseball in any capacity.[16][17] On January 22, 2008, 
Knoblauch was subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating steroids 
in baseball after he failed to respond to an invitation to give a deposition 
by the January 18, 2008 deadline.[18] On January 23, the Associated Press 
reported that federal marshals had as yet been unable to find Knoblauch 
to serve him with the subpoena.[19] On January 28, 2008, it was reported 
that the congressional subpoena had been withdrawn after Knoblauch agreed 
to give a deposition on February 1, 2008.[20] Knoblauch has admitted to 
using human growth hormone: "I did HGH. It didn't help me out. It didn't 
make me any better. I had the worst years of my career from a batting average 
standpoint. And I got hurt. So there was no good that came out of it for
