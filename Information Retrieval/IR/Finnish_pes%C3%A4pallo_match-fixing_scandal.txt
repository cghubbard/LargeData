Finnish pesäpallo match-fixing scandal was a match fixing scandal in Finland 
that involved a large number of players, managers and other team officials 
of the pesäpallo (the Finnish form of baseball) league Superpesis. On 11 
and 13 August 1998 players and managers of eight teams fixed five different 
matches. All games were on the betting list of Finnish national betting 
agency Veikkaus. Matches were of two last rounds on the Superpesis regular 
season and they were meaningless for the teams. Four matches out of five 
ended on a high odds draw after two periods.[1] The scam was unveiled a 
year later. Finnish police interrogated 460 persons involving the scandal. 
Most of them were never accused due to lack of evidence or for the reason 
that they were only lucky gamblers who had a hint on the results of meaningless 
games. Over 30 people were sentenced to fines or discharged. They caused 
Veikkaus losses of at least 14 million Finnish marks (2,3 million euros).[1][2] 
All teams involved were relegated two levels down in the league system 
and Veikkaus decided to ban all pesäpallo matches for six years. The agency 
started taking bets again in 2005. Betting a draw was not allowed until 
2009.[3] The Finnish pesäpallo association lost a part of its state financing. 
The common interest on pesäpallo, which is considered to be the national 
game of Finland, was decreasing for many years. However, in last few years 
the game has managed to increase its popularity among Finnish sports spectators.
