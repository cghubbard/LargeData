The 1924 Summer Olympics (French: Les Jeux olympiques d'été de 1924), officially 
known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport 
event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France. It was the second 
time Paris hosted the games, after 1900. The selection process for the 
1924 Summer Olympics consisted of six bids, and Paris was selected ahead 
of Amsterdam, Barcelona, Los Angeles, Prague, and Rome. The selection was 
made at the 20th IOC Session in Lausanne in 1921.[1] The cost of the Games 
of the VIII Olympiad was estimated to be 10,000,000₣. With total receipts 
at 5,496,610₣, the Olympics resulted in a hefty loss despite crowds that 
reached 60,000 people at a time.[2] 126 events in 23 disciplines, comprising 
17 sports, were part of the Olympic program in 1924. The number of events 
in each discipline is noted in parentheses. Seventeen sports venues were 
used in the 1924 Summer Olympics. Stade de Colombes served as the final 
venue for the 1938 FIFA World Cup between Italy and Hungary. A total of 
44 nations were represented at the 1924 Games. Germany was still absent, 
having not been invited by the Organizing Committee.[24] China (although 
did not compete), Ecuador, Haiti, Ireland, Lithuania, and Uruguay attended 
the Olympic Games for the first time while the Philippines competed for 
first time in an Olympic Games as a nation though it first participated 
in 1900 Summer Olympic Games also in this city. Latvia and Poland attended 
the Summer Olympic Games for the first time (having both appeared earlier 
at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix). These are the top ten nations 
that won medals the 1924 Games. The last surviving competitor of the 1924 
Summer Olympics was Croatian swimmer Ivo Pavelić, who died on 22 February
