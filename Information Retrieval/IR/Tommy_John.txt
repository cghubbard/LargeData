Thomas Edward John Jr. (born May 22, 1943) is a former pitcher in Major 
League Baseball whose 288 career victories rank as the seventh highest 
total among left-handers in major league history. He is also known for 
the revolutionary surgery, now named after him, which was performed on 
a damaged ligament in his pitching arm.[1] Well over half of John's career 
wins came after his surgery. John was an outstanding basketball player 
at Gerstmeyer High School in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he held the city 
single game scoring record. Choosing baseball when he realized he would 
not go on to play professional basketball, John signed with the Cleveland 
Indians and made his major league debut at twenty years-old in 1963. Following 
two partial seasons with the Indians, John showed occasional excellence 
during seven respectable years as a starting pitcher with the Chicago White 
Sox. However, it was a trade before the 1972 season to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for mercurial slugger Dick Allen that began a skein of John's most 
famous years, first with the Dodgers and subsequently with the New York 
Yankees, where he posted a pair of 20-win seasons and was twice an All-Star. 
John was also named an All-Star in 1968 with the White Sox and 1978 with 
LA. He played in all three Yankees vs. Dodgers World Series of his era 
(1977, 1978 and 1981), having switched over to the Yankees by the time 
the Dodgers won the Series in 1981. John was a soft throwing sinkerball 
pitcher whose technique resulted in batters hitting numerous ground balls 
and induced double plays. In the middle of an excellent 1974 season, John 
had a 13–3 record as the Dodgers were en route to their first National 
League pennant in eight years, before he permanently damaged the ulnar 
collateral ligament in his pitching arm, leading to a revolutionary surgical 
operation. This operation, now known as Tommy John surgery, replaced the 
ligament in the elbow of his pitching arm with a tendon from his right 
forearm. The surgery was performed by Dr. Frank Jobe on September 25, 1974, 
and it seemed unlikely he would ever be able to pitch again, as he spent 
the entire 1975 season in recovery. John would work with teammate and major 
league pitcher Mike Marshall (who had a Ph.D. in kinesiology) and was said 
to know how to help pitchers recover from injuries and taught John a completely 
different way to pitch where he would not turn his leg and go straight 
to the plate which eliminated the chance of him hurting his knee and arm, 
and he returned to the Dodgers in 1976. His 10–10 record that year was 
considered "miraculous" but John went on to pitch until 1989, winning 164 
games after his surgery—forty more than before and one fewer than all-time 
great Sandy Koufax won in his entire career. After Phil Niekro's retirement, 
John spent 1988 and 1989 as the oldest player in the major leagues. In 
1989, John matched Deacon McGuire's record for most seasons played in a 
Major League Baseball career with 26 seasons played, later broken by Nolan 
Ryan.[2] In 1986, Mark McGwire got two hits off him;[3] McGwire's father 
was John's dentist. John said of this, "When your dentist's kid starts 
hitting you, it's time to retire!"[4] Tommy John went on to pitch three 
more seasons.[5] In 2009, in his 15th and final year of eligibility for 
election into the Baseball Hall of Fame John received only 31.7% of the 
vote.[6] He needed at least 75% in order to be elected. He could still 
enter the Hall if he were selected by the Veterans Committee. On the June 
22, 2012 edition of The Dan Patrick Show, Patrick and longtime baseball 
commentator Bob Costas discussed the impact the Tommy John surgery has 
had on the game, "You could make a case for" John being awarded the Buck 
O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award. John did commentary on select games 
during WPIX's final year of broadcasting Yankee baseball in 1998. In the 
June 24, 1985 edition of ABC's Monday Night Baseball, John served as color 
commentator alongside Tim McCarver for a game between the Chicago White 
Sox and Oakland Athletics. He also guest-hosted the Mike and Mike ESPN 
Radio program on June 26, 2008. It is unknown if he will continue any similar 
work for the network in the future. On December 17, 2006, John was named 
manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish in the Atlantic League, an independent 
minor league in the Northeast. Tommy John resigned as manager of the Bridgeport 
Bluefish on July 8, 2009, to pursue a "non-baseball position" with Sportable 
Scoreboards.[7] In two-and-a-half years of managing, he compiled a 159–176 
won-lost record with Bridgeport. In 2012, he was the spokesman for Tommy 
John's Go-Flex, a joint cream for older athletes and doing a national radio 
tour to promote this product as well as talk about life as a minor league 
coach, his years in the Major Leagues and to educate younger pitchers on 
the importance to take care of their arms.[8] In 2013 the initial Tommy 
John surgery, John's subsequent return to pitching success, and his relationship 
with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Frank Jobe, who developed the procedure, was 
the subject of an ESPN 30 for 30 Shorts documentary.[9] Tommy married the 
former Sally Simmons on July 13, 1970. They are parents of four children—Tamara, 
Tommy III, Travis, and Taylor. In 1981, when Travis was two years old, 
he fell 37 feet from a third-floor window in his family's New Jersey vacation 
house, bounced off the fender of a car and then lay in a coma for 17 days. 
He later made a full recovery.[10] On March 9, 2010, Taylor John, age 28, 
died as the result of a seizure and heart failure apparently due to an 
overdose of prescription drugs.[11] As a 10-year-old in 1992, Taylor's 
singing and acting talents had landed him a role in Les Misérables on Broadway. 
He made news by taking time off from the stage, however, to play baseball 
at Federal Little League in Fort Lauderdale, Florida[12] In 1998, Tamara 
John married Chicago Bears long snapper Patrick Mannelly.[13] Tommy's oldest 
son, Tommy John III, was an All-Southern Conference designated hitter for 
the Furman University Paladins in 1999; he later spent two seasons in the 
independent minor leagues as a pitcher for the Tyler Roughnecks and Schaumburg 
Flyers.[14] Tommy III was a 4-year letterman for the Paladins, leading 
the team in complete games a pitcher in 1997 (3 games), in home runs (9) 
in 1999 and is one of 3 Furman players in 113 years of varsity baseball 
to hit for the cycle, doing so on April 1, 2000 vs the Appalachian State 
Mountaineers.[15] In 1979, John's collegiate alma mater Indiana State University, 
named him a Distinguished Alumnus.[16] On January 4, 2009 John and his 
wife separated. Their marriage was dissolved July 24, 2013. On October 
24, 2013, the Terre Haute, Indiana Parks Department honored John with the 
dedication of a baseball diamond at the Spencer F. Ball Park baseball complex 
where John's last non-professional game was played in 1961, when he was
