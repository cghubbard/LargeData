George Edward "Stump" Wiedman (February 17, 1861 – March 2, 1905) was an 
American professional baseball player from 1880 to 1893. He played nine 
years in Major League Baseball, principally as a right-handed pitcher and 
outfielder, for five different major league clubs. He appeared in 379 major 
league games, 279 as a pitcher and 122 as an outfielder, and his longest 
stretches were with the Detroit Wolverines (288 games, 1881–85, 1887) and 
the Kansas City Cowboys (51 games, 1886). As a pitcher, he compiled a 101-156 
(.393) win–loss record with a 3.61 earned run average (ERA) in 2318 1⁄3 
innings pitched. He led the National League in 1881 with a 1.80 ERA and 
totaled 45 wins in the 1882 and 1883 seasons. He pitched more innings for 
the Wolverines (1,654) than any other pitcher in the club's history. Wiedman 
was born in Rochester, New York, in 1861.[1] He attended Rochester University 
and was a pitcher on the baseball team there in 1880.[2] He also played 
for the Hop Hitters Club of Rochester, with Buck Ewing as his catcher.[2] 
Wiedman made his major league debut with the Buffalo Bisons on August 26, 
1880. In the final weeks of the 1880 season, Wiedman started 13 games for 
the Bisons and appeared in another four games as a relief pitcher. He compiled 
a 0–9 record and 3.40 earned run average (ERA) in 113 2⁄3 innings pitched.[1] 
Wiedman began the 1881 season with the Washington Nationals, then joined 
the Albany, New York, club in July 1881.[2] After the Albany team folded, 
Wiedman joined the Detroit Wolverines and brought his catcher Sam Trott 
with him.[2][3] Wiedman and Trott made their debut for Detroit on September 
3, 1881, a 4-3 loss against Buffalo.[3] Wiedman started 13 games for Detroit 
in the last month of the season, compiling an 8-5 record and 1.18 ERA in 
115 innings pitched. He led the National League in ERA and had the lowest 
WHIP rating (walks + hits per inning pitched) at 1.043.[1] Wiedman had 
another strong year in 1882, winning 25 games, pitching 411 innings and 
43 complete games with a WHIP rating of 1.046 (4th best in the National 
League).[1] On August 17, 1882, he was the losing pitcher in one of the 
great pitching duels in baseball history. Monte Ward was the pitcher for 
the Providence Grays, and he and Wiedman held the game scoreless through 
17 innings. Wiedman allowed only seven hits but lost the game in the 18th 
inning on a home run by Old Hoss Radbourn, who was playing in right field.[2] 
While he won 25 games in 1882, Wiedman also ranked among the league leaders 
with 20 losses. Wiedman lost at least 20 games for five consecutive seasons 
from 1882 to 1886, ranking among the league leaders in losses for each 
of those seasons.[1] Wiedman also appeared 88 games as an outfielder for 
the Wolverines during the 1883 and 1884 seasons. He scored 58 runs, had 
50 RBIs, and compiled a .175 batting average during those seasons.[1] Applying 
the sabermetric Wins Above Replacement (WAR) model, Wiedman earned negative 
ratings of -1.6 and -1.7 in 1883 and 1884.[1] In 1887, Wiedman returned 
to the Wolverines, where he went 13–7, helping them to the 1887 National 
League pennant.[1] Over the course of six seasons, Wiedman pitched more 
innings for the Wolverines (1,654) than any other pitcher in the club's 
history.[4] After the 1885 season, Wiedman was released by the Wolverines 
to league control and then obtained by the newly formed Kansas City Cowboys. 
He appeared in 51 games as a starting pitcher for the Cowboys, including 
48 complete games, and also appeared in three games as an outfielder. He 
compiled a win-loss record of 12-36 (.250) and a -1.4 WAR rating with a 
4.52 ERA in 427-2/3 inning pitched. He led the National League in both 
losses (36) and earned runs allowed (549).[1] His 36 losses in 1886 is 
tied for ninth highest in major league history.[5] The Kansas City club 
compiled a 30-91 record and disbanded after the 1886 season.[6] In early 
August 1887, Wiedman was sold by Detroit to the New York Metropolitans 
for a price estimated at between $800 and $1,000.[1] Wiedman started 12 
games for the Metropolitans in the last half of the 1887 season and compiled 
a 4-8 record with a 4.64 ERA.[1] At the end of the 1887 season, the Metropolitans 
sold Wiedman to the New York Giants. Wiedman appeared in one game for the 
Giants in 1887 and two games in 1888. He compiled a 1-2 record and 2.77 
ERA in his three games with the Giants. He played in his last major league 
game with the Giants on July 5, 1888, at age 27.[1] Although his major 
league career ended in 1888, Wiedman continued to pitch in the minor leagues. 
He compiled a 10-4 record for the Toronto Canucks in 1884.[7] He remained 
in Canada in 1885, playing for the Hamilton Hams of the International League. 
He concluded his professional baseball career in 1893 with the Providence 
Clamdiggers of the Eastern League.[7] After retiring from baseball, Wiedman 
worked as an umpire for a time, including one season as an umpire in the 
National League. He then became a saloon operator in Rochester, New York. 
His first venture in the saloon business was the firm of Coughlin & Weidman. 
He later formed a partnership with his brother-in-law, Michael "Silk" O'Loughlin, 
a well-known umpire. Wiedman and O'Loughlin operated a saloon for several 
years at 158 State Street in Rochester. That establishment was sold in 
approximately 1903, after which Wiedman and O'Loughlin conducted business 
at another location.[2][8] By early 1905, Wiedman developed a tumor which 
was believed to be throat cancer. He traveled to New York City where he 
met with medical specialists and underwent an operation that resulted in 
his death. He died in a New York hospital in March 1905 at age 44.[8] He 
was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Rochester, New York.[1] In an 
obituary, the Sporting Life wrote: "Weidman was a clean-cut, honest and 
well behaved ball player, and a credit to his profession at all times.
