Ervin "Pete" Fox (March 8, 1909 – July 5, 1966) was an American professional 
baseball player from 1930 to 1946. He played 13 seasons in Major League 
Baseball, principally as a right fielder, for the Detroit Tigers from 1933 
to 1940 and the Boston Red Sox from 1941 to 1945. Though his given name 
was Ervin, Fox became known as "Pete" in 1932 when fans in Beaumont, Texas, 
dubbed him "Rabbit" in reference to his speed, with the nickname reportedly 
evolving into "Peter Rabbit" and then simply "Pete". Fox compiled a .298 
career batting average and finished among the American League leaders in 
batting average four times—8th in 1935 (.321), 10th in 1937 (.331), 9th 
in 1943 (.288), and 6th in 1944 (.315). His .321 average in 1935 was third 
highest on the Tigers team that defeated the Chicago Cubs in the 1935 World 
Series. Fox also ranked among the American League leaders in stolen bases 
on seven occasions between 1934 and 1944. Fox was born in Evansville, Indiana, 
in 1909, the son of a fire captain.[1] He graduated from Bosse High School 
in Evansville.[2] After graduating from high school, Fox worked at a furniture 
factory in Evansville and played sandlot baseball.[1] Fox began his professional 
baseball career in 1930 with the Evansville Hubs of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa 
League. After only seven games with the Hubs, Fox was sent to the Wheeling 
Stogies of the Mid-Atlantic League.[1] He appeared in 106 games for the 
Stogies in 1930, compiling a .339 batting average with 24 doubles, 15 triples, 
and 14 home runs in 422 at bats.[3] After a strong showing with Wheeling, 
Fox was recalled to Evansville for the 1931 season.[1] He hit .302 with 
33 doubles, 12 triples, and 8 home runs in 490 at bats.[3] Fox spent the 
1932 season playing for the Beaumont Exporters team that won the Texas 
League pennant. His teammates in Beaumont that year included Hank Greenberg, 
Schoolboy Rowe, Elden Auker, and Flea Clifton.[4] Each of these players 
would play together on Detroit's 1934 and 1935 pennant-winning teams. Fox 
led the Texas League in 1932 with a .357 batting average.[1] He also hit 
23 doubles, 11 triples, and 19 home runs for Beaumont.[3] Fox, whose first 
name was actually Ervin, also won the nickname "Pete" while playing for 
Beaumont. Due to Fox's speed, Beaumont fans began calling him "Rabbit" 
which then reportedly evolved into "Peter Rabbit" and then simply "Pete".[1] 
In 1933, Fox joined the Detroit Tigers and became the team's regular center 
fielder, starting 116 games at the position.[2] He compiled a .288 batting 
average with 26 doubles, 13 triples, and 7 home runs in his rookie season.[2] 
Fox was one of three rookies for Detroit in 1933, along with Hank Greenberg 
and Marv Owen, who would be consistent starters for the 1934 and 1935 pennant-winning 
teams. In 1934, the Tigers acquired left fielder Goose Goslin, Jo Jo White 
took over as the team's center fielder, and Fox became the team's starting 
right fielder. In his first season in right field, Fox struggled at the 
plate with a .285 batting average, but he led the American League with 
four outfield double plays.[2] The 1934 Tigers won the American League 
pennant, and Fox set a major league record by hitting six doubles in the 
1934 World Series in a losing effort against the St. Louis Cardinals.[1] 
The 1935 season was a breakout season for Fox as he helped lead the Tigers 
to an American League pennant and a World Series championship over the 
Chicago Cubs. After Fox began the season with a batting slump, a trade 
that would have sent Fox to another team fell through. Fox began hitting 
at a torrid pace after word of the trade became public. He had hitting 
streaks of 29 and 17 games and had eight hits and 10 runs batted in a double 
header against the St. Louis Browns on June 30, 1935.[1][5] The Sporting 
News in a front page profile in late July 1935 credited Fox with being 
the Tigers' spark plug: "Super work on the part of a single player often 
provides the winning accelerant for a team which otherwise might remain 
close to mediocrity in the result column. . . . This season it has been 
Ervin (Pete) Fox, little outfielder, who has supplied the winning spark, 
with a recent run of 29 games in which he hit safely having witnessed the 
definite upswing of Mickey Cochrane's Bengals."[6] During the 1935 season, 
Fox ranked among the American League's leaders in multiple offensive and 
defensive categories. His .321 batting average was eighth best in the league 
(third best on the Tigers behind Hank Greenberg and Charlie Gehringer), 
and his .513 slugging percentage was fifth best in the league.[2] He also 
ranked sixth in runs scored (116), eighth in stolen bases (14), second 
in times hit by a pitch (6), and fourth in range factor among right fielders 
(1.90).[2] During the six-game 1935 World Series win over the Chicago Cubs, 
Fox led both teams with ten hits and a .385 batting average. The Sporting 
News called Fox "the individual hitting star of the series."[7] In 1936, 
the Tigers acquired future Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Al Simmons 
to play alongside another future Hall of Fame outfielder Goose Goslin. 
The reconfiguration of the outfield, combined with multiple injuries, resulted 
in Fox losing his position as the team's starting right fielder. Fox suffered 
an "attack of lumbago" in early May, a sprained finger in July, and was 
called home from a road trip in August when his five-month son became ill.[8][9] 
Gee Walker became the Tigers' starting right fielder and Fox was relegated 
to a backup role, starting only 49 games in right field in 1936. He compiled 
a .305 batting average in 220 at bats.[2] In 1937, with Simmons and Goslin 
having left the Tigers, Fox returned to the starting lineup, playing 105 
games in right field, 28 in center field, and 11 in left field. Fox responded 
to his starting assignment with career bests in batting average (.331) 
and doubles (39).[2] Along with Fox's outstanding season, Detroit second 
baseman Charlie Gehringer won the 1937 batting championship with a .371 
average and first baseman Hank Greenberg added a team record 183 RBIs. 
The 1937 Tigers compiled a 89-65 record and finished in second place behind 
the New York Yankees.[10] The 1937 Tigers tied a major league record with 
four players (Fox, Gehringer, Greenberg, and Gee Walker) each compiling 
200 or more hits.[11] Fox began the 1938 season at a torrid pace with the 
bat. By early May, Fox was batting .451.[12] Although his average dipped 
to .293 by the end of the 1938 season, Fox compiled a career high with 
96 RBIs.[2] Fox also ranked among the American League leaders in stolen 
bases (5th with 16), hits (10th with 186), and triples (7th with 10). Defensively, 
he led all American League outfielders in games played (155) and fielding 
percentage (.994) during the 1938 season.[2] Fox remained the Tigers' starting 
right fielder in 1939. He compiled a batting average of .295, and his 2.28 
range factor in 1939 led all American League right fielders.[2] In 1940, 
Fox and Bruce Campbell alternated as Detroit's right fielder. The Tigers 
won the 1940 pennant, but Campbell started all seven games in the 1940 
World Series between the Cincinnati Reds and Tigers. Fox did have one pinch 
hit at bat in the 1940 Series. In three World Series, Fox played 14 games 
and batted .327 in 55 at bats. On December 12, 1940, the Boston Red Sox 
purchased Fox from the Tigers for a sum reported to be slightly in excess 
of the waiver price.[2][13] The sale of Fox was reported to be a source 
of "genuine regret" among Detroit fans, and Detroit sports writer Sam Greene 
wrote that Fox had "undeniable appeal as a steady, hard-working craftsman."[13] 
Greene also wrote in The Sporting News that Fox had been overshadowed in 
Detroit by superstars Hank Greenberg, Charlie Gehringer, Goose Goslin, 
and Mickey Cochrane, and noted that it is "often said of Fox that he was 
'the most under rated' player among the Battling Bengals."[13] Fox was 
a backup outfielder for the Red Sox during the 1941 and 1942 seasons, appearing 
in 62 games as an outfielder in 1941 and 71 games in 1942. In 1943, the 
Red Sox lost outfielders Ted Williams and Dom DiMaggio to military service, 
making room for Fox to emerge as the Red Sox starting right fielder in 
1943. He was an All-Star in the 1944 season, in which he batted .315 (6th 
best in the league) with 37 doubles.[2] In 1946, Fox played for the Oakland 
Oaks of the Pacific Coast League under manager Casey Stengel. He appeared 
in 57 games for the Oaks, compiling a .258 batting average.[3] After his 
playing career ended, Fox served as a manager for minor league baseball 
teams in Pawtucket (New England), Waterloo (Three-I) and Hot Springs (Cotton 
States). He also served as a scout for the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White 
Sox. He retired from baseball in the early 1950s after his vision deteriorated 
due to the development of cataracts.[14] He subsequently worked as a manufacturer's 
representative in Detroit. Fox was married in 1927 to Betty Stuteville.[15] 
They had two sons, Donald and James. Don became a pitcher in the Boston 
Red Sox organization, and James became an all-city football player at his 
father's alma mater, Bosse High School.[14] In 1966, Fox died in Detroit, 
Michigan at 57, of cancer. He was interred at Detroit's Woodlawn Cemetery.[2] 
In 1980, Fox was posthumously inducted into the Indiana Baseball Hall of
