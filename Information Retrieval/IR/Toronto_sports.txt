The City of Toronto has a long history of sport. It is home to a number 
of clubs, including: the Granite Club (est. 1836), the Royal Canadian Yacht 
Club (est. 1852), the Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club (est. pre-1827), 
the Argonaut Rowing Club (est. 1872), Toronto Argonauts football club (est. 
1873), the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club (est. 1881), and the Badminton and 
Racquet Club (est. 1924).[1] A number of historic venues have been developed 
in Toronto such as: Christie Pits (est. 1899), Ricoh Coliseum (est. 1921), 
Varsity Arena (est. 1926), Maple Leaf Gardens (est. 1931). Toronto has 
teams in nearly every major professional sport, including the Toronto Blue 
Jays (MLB), Toronto Argonauts (CFL), Toronto Raptors (NBA), Toronto Rock 
(NLL), Toronto FC (MLS), and the Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL). Throughout 
the sports world, Toronto is perhaps best known for the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
Although Toronto has not won a Stanley Cup since 1967, the city is renowned 
as a hockey town. Air Canada Centre (home of the Leafs, Raptors, and Rock) 
and Rogers Centre (home of the Blue Jays) are located in the downtown core 
and are within walking distance from one another via Bremner Boulevard. 
The Rogers Centre was the first stadium to have a fully retractable motorized 
roof. BMO Field (home of the Argonauts and Toronto FC) and Ricoh Coliseum 
(home of the Toronto Marlies) are located at Exhibition Place, situated 
just outside the downtown core, while also being within walking distance 
from one another. The city is known for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the 
National Hockey League, a team with passionate support in the city, and 
the most financially successful sport franchise in the country. The team 
built Maple Leaf Gardens, a sporting venue which served as the home arena 
for the Maple Leafs, and was also used for cultural and other events. Since 
1999, they have played in the Air Canada Centre. The team's roots stretch 
back to the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association, the 
predecessor to the NHL. The NHA was founded in 1909 without any teams from 
Toronto. In 1911, the Mutual Street Arena was being built and Ambrose O'Brien, 
who had operated four NHA franchises but decided to get out of the business, 
sold two of his franchises to Toronto-based groups. The Toronto Hockey 
Club purchased one, which would become known as the Blueshirts, and a second 
was sold to a group affiliated with the Tecumseh Lacrosse Club for $500 
cash and promissory notes for $2,000 which would be called the Toronto 
Tecumsehs. They were scheduled to begin play in the 1911-12 season, but 
construction delays led to the two Toronto teams being dropped from the 
schedule and they instead began play in 1912-13. After a year of play, 
the Tecumsehs were sold and renamed the Toronto Ontarios. The following 
year the team was purchased by Eddie Livingstone, who renamed them the 
Toronto Shamrocks in January 1915. Later that year, Livingstone purchased 
the Blueshirts giving him ownership of two NHA teams, but after the Pacific 
Coast Hockey Association raids left him with only enough players for one 
team, he transferred Shamrocks players to the Blueshirts and only the Blueshirts 
competed in the 1915–16 NHA season. When Livingstone failed to sell the 
Shamrocks, the NHA seized the franchise, which was left dormant for the 
year before being reactivated in 1916–17, awarding it to a Canadian military 
team, the Toronto 228th Battalion. When the regiment was ordered overseas 
in February 1917, the team was forced to withdraw. That left the NHA with 
an odd number of teams, and as a result the team owners, who wanted Livingstone 
out of the league, decided to suspend operations of the Blueshirts for 
the remainder of the season. Following the end of the season, Toronto was 
reinstated, with the condition that the club was to be sold within 60 days. 
However, Livingstone obtained a court order to prevent the sale.[6] Before 
the start of the 1917–18 season, the NHA owners announced that the league 
would not operate in the 1917–18 season. About two weeks later, all of 
the owners except Livingstone announced that they were creating a new league, 
the National Hockey League. Livingstone was not invited to participate 
in the new league. However, the other teams wished to continue a team in 
Toronto, and also needed a fourth team to balance the schedule. Accordingly, 
Livingstone's landlord, the Toronto Arena Company, was given a temporary 
franchise in the NHL and leased Livingstone's Torontos players for the 
inaugural 1917–18 NHL season.[7] Although the team had no official name, 
it was made up mostly of former Blue Shirts and ss a result, the newspapers 
still called the team the Blue Shirts or the Torontos, as they always had.[8] 
The Arena Company had originally promised to return the Toronto players 
to Livingstone if no transfer could be arranged. Instead, before the 1918–19 
season, it formed a new club, which was known as the Toronto Arenas.[9] 
This new franchise was separated from the Arena Company. The dispute with 
Livingstone forced the Arena Company into bankruptcy. The Arenas were sold 
to a group headed by Charles Querrie for $5000, who renamed them the Toronto 
St. Patricks. In 1927, with the team in trouble financially due to Querrie 
having lost a lawsuit to former Livingstone, Querrie put the St. Pats up 
for sale and agreed in principle to sell them for $200,000 to a group that 
would move the team to Philadelphia.[10] However, Conn Smythe persuaded 
Querrie that civic pride was more important than money and put together 
a syndicate that bought the St. Pats. Smythe himself invested $10,000 of 
his own money and his group contributed $75,000 up front and a further 
$75,000 due 30 days later, with minority partner Jack Bickell retaining 
his $40,000 share in the team.[10][11] The deal was finalized on Valentine’s 
Day,[11] and the new owners quickly renamed the team the Toronto Maple 
Leafs.[12]:85–86 When the World Hockey Association, a rival league to the 
NHL, awarded Doug Michel an Ontario-based franchise in 1971 for $25,000 
to play in the WHA's inaugural 1972–73 season,[13] Toronto was one of several 
cities under consideration as home for the team. Harold Ballard, owner 
of the Maple Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens, offered to rent the arena to 
the team, but Michel found the rent excessive.[14][15] He then tried to 
base the team in Hamilton, but the city did not have an appropriate venue.[15] 
Michel settled on Ottawa and the team became the Ottawa Nationals. However, 
after a season at the Ottawa Civic Centre, the team decided to relocate 
and played their home playoff games at Maple Leaf Gardens. During this 
time, the team was referred to as the Ontario Nationals. The team moved 
to Toronto permanently for the following season after being sold to John 
F. Bassett, son of former Leafs part-owner John Bassett.[13] Future Leafs 
owner Steve Stavro was a minority shareholder.[13] They were renamed the 
Toronto Toros in June 1973. However, they could only attract a fraction 
of the attendance numbers the competing Leafs drew. In their inaugural 
season, they played out of Varsity Arena, but played the next two seasons 
out of Maple Leaf Gardens. The team played their final game in Toronto 
in 1976, after which a drop in attendance and onerous lease terms at the 
Gardens forced them to relocate to Birmingham, Alabama as the Birmingham 
Bulls.[16] There have been numerous attempts to establish a second NHL 
team in the Greater Toronto Area or nearby Hamilton. The latter briefly 
had the Hamilton Tigers in the NHL from 1920, when local interests purchased 
and relocated the Quebec Bulldogs, until 1925 when they folded. In 2003, 
the Toronto Roadrunners of the American Hockey League played their inaugural 
season out of a renovated Ricoh Coliseum in Exhibition Place. They served 
as a farm club for the NHL's Edmonton Oilers. After a season of bad attendance, 
the team relocated to Edmonton, Alberta. However, with the Ricoh Coliseum 
vacated, a new tenant for the facility was found with the Maple Leafs relocating 
their AHL farm team, the St. John's Maple Leafs, from St. John's, Newfoundland 
and Labrador to Toronto as the Toronto Marlies in 2005. Toronto has also 
hosted various international hockey tournaments, hosting parts of the 1972 
and 1974 Summit Series, parts of the 1976 and 1991 Canada Cups, parts of 
the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, and parts of the 2015 World Junior Ice Hockey 
Championship. Toronto is also home to the CWHL (Canadian Women's Hockey 
League) Toronto Furies. A professional women's hockey team. Professional 
baseball has had a presence in the city at the minor league level since 
1896 with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA International League. It was 
in a game against the Leafs on September 4, 1914 at Hanlan's Point Stadium 
where Babe Ruth hit his first ever professional home run[17] while also 
pitching a complete game one-hitter for the visiting Providence Grays. 
Hall of famer Sparky Anderson was also a member of the Leafs as both a 
player and a manager.[17] Toronto interests long pursued a major league 
team for the city. Toronto was proposed as the home for a National League 
(NL) team by Albert Spalding when he was established the league in 1876.[17] 
Exhibition games were played by both the NL and American League (AL) of 
Major League Baseball (MLB) in Toronto in the 1910s.[18] Member of Parliament 
Bernard Rickart Hepburn was granted a Toronto franchise by the Federal 
League,[19][20] a rival major league to the NL and AL, for its inaugural 
season in 1914,[20][21][22] after the franchise was revoked from Cleveland.[23][24] 
But after speculation the franchise would be returned to Cleveland[24][25] 
or moved to Cincinnati,[26][27][28] it was transferred to Brooklyn to become 
the Brooklyn Tip-Tops prior to playing a game in Toronto.[29][30] Hepburn 
cited his inability to find a park to play at in short notice as the reason 
the team didn't launch.[20] However, he secured an agreement with the league 
which granted him the rights to a team for the following season.[20] Though 
Toronto would be proposed as the new home to the Kansas City Packers Federal 
League franchise for the 1915 season,[31] no team ever came to fruition 
in the city. Toronto interests put forward a bid to buy the Washington 
Nationals to move them to Toronto in 1918 when there was discussion of 
the team relocating.[18][32][33][34] The following year it was reported 
that there were plans for the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and New 
York Yankees, which were dissatisfied with the President of the AL Ban 
Johnson, to break away and form their own new major league, which would 
include Toronto.[35] In 1922 a Toronto group attempted to purchase the 
Boston Red Sox to relocate them to Toronto.[36][37] The owner of the Boston 
Braves, Lou Perini, tried to sell his team to Toronto interests in the 
early 1950s before relocating them to become the Milwaukee Braves.[38] 
While owning the Maple Leafs baseball team, Jack Kent Cooke set his sights 
on bringing MLB to Toronto. He made a bid on the St. Louis Browns in 1953,[39] 
but the team was sold to a competing group which relocated them to become 
the Baltimore Orioles the following season.[40] The AL considered Toronto 
as a potential home for the Philadelphia Athletics before they became the 
Kansas City Athletics in 1955,[41][42] after Cooke bid on them,[43] but 
the city's lack of a major league venue was an obstacle to acquiring a 
team.[40][41] Cooke unsuccessfully bid on the Detroit Tigers in 1956,[43][44][45] 
reportedly to move them to Toronto.[38] In 1957 he submitted a bid for 
a NL expansion team for Toronto.[43][46][47][48] In 1958, Cooke offered 
to withdraw from Toronto if the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were considering 
relocating, moved to the city, in exchange for partial ownership of the 
club.[49][50][51][52] That same year it was reported that Toronto was one 
of the cities that the owner of the Washington Senators was considering 
relocating his team to.[53] In 1959 Cooke became one of the founding owners 
in the Continental League, a proposed third major league of baseball, getting 
a team for Toronto for a fee of $50,000,[54] but the league disbanded a 
year later without ever staging a game. Cooke later applied to the AL for 
a Toronto expansion team in 1960, but found the expansion terms too onerous,[55][56][57][58] 
and considered purchasing the Cincinnati Reds for Toronto in 1961 after 
their owner died.[59] In 1967, with mounting losses, the owner of the baseball 
Maple Leafs sough a buyer to keep the team in Toronto.[60][61] Maple Leaf 
Gardens Limited, owner of the Maple Leafs of the NHL, considered purchasing 
the team,[60][61][62][63] but the deal ultimately fell apart due to concerns 
about the team's home, Maple Leaf Stadium, which needed up to $250,000 
in repairs and whose owner wanted $4 million to purchase it.[61][62] Harold 
Ballard, part owner of MLGL, said that the company's interest was due in 
part to help position itself to go after a MLB franchise for Toronto.[61][62] 
The team was subsequently relocated out of Toronto to Louisville, Kentucky. 
In 1967 a Toronto group was one of six to submit a bid for a NL expansion 
team.[64][65] In 1971, Howard Webster, chairman of the Globe and Mail, 
made an offer to purchase the San Diego Padres and relocate them to Toronto 
but it was refused.[38][66] In early 1974, MLGL announced plans to build 
a new baseball stadium in Toronto,[67] but the city ultimately decided 
to renovate Exhibition Stadium to make it suitable for baseball.[68][69] 
Later that year a group called Canadian Baseball Co. led by Sydney Cooper 
submitted an application to both the AL and NL for a franchise.[70][71][72] 
Cooper had previously been part of Webster's group.[70] At the time it 
was reported that there were at least four groups bidding for a Toronto 
team, including ones led by Labatt Brewing Company, MLGL[71] and Robert 
Hunter, the former President of the International League Maple Leafs, in 
addition to Canadian Baseball Co.[70][72][73][74] Lorne Duguid, vice-president 
of Hiram Walker Distillers and MLGL executive, led MLGL's bid.[71] In 1975 
the owner of the Baltimore Orioles stated that he was in negotiations to 
sell his team to a Toronto group.[75] The following January, San Francisco 
Giants owner Horace Stoneham agreed to sell the team for $13.25 million 
to a group headed by Labatt intending to relocate it to Toronto. The team 
would have begun play in the 1976 season at Exhibition Stadium, and be 
called the Toronto Giants.[76] However the plan to move the Giants was 
quashed by a U.S. court.[77] The MLGL group also bid on the Giants, with 
Ballard stating that they had offered $15 million for the team,[78] after 
having previously negotiated with the owners of the Baltimore Orioles, 
Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians[79] and Oakland Athletics in their 
attempt to acquire a team for Toronto.[80] The Labatt group then pursued 
a NL expansion team, but when the NL only agreed to consider expanding 
in March 1976, while the AL voted to grant Toronto a team,[81][82] they 
switched gears. A second Toronto group backed by Carling O'Keefe also applied 
for the AL expansion team.[81][82][83] Less than a week later, the AL awarded 
the team to the Labatt group, which included Webster, and the Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), for $7 million.[81][84][85][86] A few 
days later the NL had their own vote on expanding to Toronto and Washington, 
but while receiving a majority support of 10-2 it failed to pass due to 
lack of unanimity and was put off for two weeks.[83][87][88] The NL objected 
to the AL's expansion in to Toronto, arguing that the NL was a better match 
for the city with a natural rivalry with the Montreal Expos, and asked 
baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn to intervene so they could reconsider 
their own expansion plans.[87][88] Kuhn requested a moratorium on the AL's 
expansion plans,[89][90] but a second non-unanimous vote by the NL on expanding 
to Toronto[87][91][92] left Toronto uncontested to the AL. The Toronto 
Blue Jays inaugural campaign was in 1977 with Exhibition Stadium chosen 
as the site for the team's home games. Built in the 1950s, it was rebuilt 
in 1976 to satisfy the requirements for baseball. In 1989, the team moved 
to the newly built SkyDome (now known as the Rogers Centre). Although the 
team performed poorly, placing last in the American League East for each 
of its first three years, successful drafting and team management resulted 
in improved performance that led to the team's first pennant in 1985, and 
culminated with consecutive World Series victories in 1992 and 1993. The 
city is also home to the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball club of the Intercounty 
Baseball League. Toronto has also hosted parts of the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic. Although not as historically entrenched in Toronto culture as 
other sports, basketball does have significant milestones in the city. 
The first major professional basketball game in the city was an exhibition 
between the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons and Rochester Royals of the National 
Basketball League at the Gardens in 1946.[93][94][95] The first game of 
the professional Basketball Association of America, forerunner of the National 
Basketball Association (NBA), was contested at Maple Leaf Gardens (MLG) 
between the Toronto Huskies and the New York Knickerbockers on November 
1, 1946.[96] However, the Huskies folded after the league's inaugural season 
follow losses thought to total $60,000.[97] Numerous exhibition and regular 
season NBA and American Basketball Association (ABA) games were held at 
both MLG and SkyDome over the years,[98][99][100][101][102][103] including 
a total of 16 regular season Buffalo Braves games at MLG from 1971-75[104] 
in an attempt to gauge the city's interest in a full-time team.[105] Ruby 
Richman, the former coach of Canada's national basketball team, working 
with the head of Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL) Harold Ballard, pursued 
a number of existing ABA and NBA teams to relocate to the city in the 1970s.[106][107][108] 
Richman had a tentative agreement to purchase both the Miami Floridians 
and Pittsburgh Condors of the ABA with the plan to merge them into a single 
Toronto-based team, but the deal fell through.[106] Later Richman held 
negotiations with the Detroit Pistons, which were seeking $5 million for 
the franchise, but pulled out when the price was raised to $8.25 million.[106] 
MLGL attempted to purchase the Braves for $8.5 million and relocate them 
to Toronto in 1974,[106][109][110] and again several times later,[106][111][112][113] 
with Carling O'Keefe also considering purchasing the team in 1976,[114] 
but the owners eventually chose to move the team to San Diego.[115][116] 
When Toronto was awarded an expansion NBA franchise in 1974 for the 1975-76 
season[107][117][118] MLGL was one of three groups to bid for the rights 
to the team,[107][117][119][120] but the club never materialized since 
no group was able to secure funding for the expansion fee of at least $6.15 
million.[109][121][122] MLGL attempted to purchase and relocate the Houston 
Rockets in 1975, which were seeking $8 million for the team, but the teams 
lease ultimately prevented a relocation.[106][108][123] In 1976 MLGL attempted 
to buy the Atlanta Hawks.[111][118] In 1979 a Toronto group which included 
Balard again pushed for an expansion franchise, but lost out to the Dallas 
Mavericks.[124][125] Toronto interests considered purchasing and relocating 
the Kansas City Kings in 1979.[126] In 1983, Cleveland Cavaliers owner 
Ted Stepien stated that "the chances are 999-to-1" that his team would 
be relocated and renamed the Toronto Towers, playing their games in MLG,[127] 
with Carling O'Keefe thought to be involved financially in the deal,[128] 
but he ultimately sold it to a local group.[129] A Toronto group which 
included Bill Ballard, son of Harold, and Basketball Hall of Famer Wilt 
Chamberlain submitted an application and $100,000 deposit for a NBA expansion 
franchise for MLG in 1986, but of the six cities to apply[130][131] Toronto 
was not one of the four which were successful.[132] Larry Tanenbaum attempted 
to purchase and relocate the Denver Nuggets to Toronto in 1991, but the 
team could not get out of its lease at the McNichols Arena. Tanenbaum later 
pursued the New Jersey Nets and San Antonio Spurs unsuccessfully.[133][134] 
Ultimately, the NBA awarded an expansion franchise to John Bitove, over 
Tanenbaum's group which had partnered with the Maple Leafs[135] and a third 
group led by Bill Ballard and Michael Cohl,[136] and the Toronto Raptors 
joined the NBA for the 1995–96 season, giving the city its own team once 
again. The franchise was one of two Canadian expansion teams announced 
by the NBA in 1993, the other being the Vancouver Grizzlies, which moved 
south of the border to Memphis after the 2000–01 season. The Toronto Tornados 
of the minor league Continental Basketball Association played in the city 
from 1983-85 before being relocated to Pensacola, Florida in the middle 
of their third season to become the Pensacola Tornados. Toronto has also 
hosted parts of the 1994 FIBA World Championship. Toronto hosted the 2016 
NBA All-Star Game weekend February 12–14, 2016. Toronto is home to the 
oldest professional football team in North America, the Toronto Argonauts, 
who have won the Grey Cup championship a record 15 times. Toronto has also 
played host to the Grey Cup Championship 46 times, more than any other 
city and most recently the 100th Grey Cup in 2012, which was won by the 
home town Argonauts. The Argos were founded in 1873 by the Argonaut Rowing 
Club, and is referred to colloquially as the Boatmen in honour of that 
heritage. The team is also known as the double blue because of the franchise 
colours (Oxford blue and Cambridge blue); the colour blue has become emblematic 
of the city and most of its sport franchises. The Argos also draw the highest 
per-game attendance of any sports team in Toronto and draw the second highest 
per-game TV ratings nationally of any Toronto-based sports team (after 
the Maple Leafs hockey club). In the early 1970s, Maple Leaf Gardens Limited 
announced plans to apply for a second Canadian Football League team to 
be based in Toronto which would play at Varsity Stadium, but the proposal 
never went anywhere.[137][138][139] During his tenure as owner of the Hamilton 
Tiger-Cats, Ballard repeatedly threatened to move the franchise to Varsity 
Stadium,[140] but the move was vetoed by the Argos.[141] Toronto also has 
a long history with American football. The first professional U.S. football 
team to play a home game in Toronto was the Los Angeles Wildcats of the 
American Football League of 1926, the first major competitor to the National 
Football League for the dominance of professional football. While the Wildcats 
nominally represented Los Angeles, California, frequent travel to the west 
coast still posed a major obstacle so the team was instead a traveling 
team based in Illinois and played most of its games in the home stadiums 
of its opponents, with the exception of the Toronto game. The Wildcats 
lost the regular season game to the New York Yankees (which would join 
the National Football League (NFL) the following year) 28-0 in front of 
10,000 fans at Maple Leaf Stadium on 8 November 1926.[142] The NFL has 
had a presence in Toronto since 1959 when the Argonauts hosted three NFL 
teams in a three-season span. The nearby Hamilton Tiger-Cats also hosted 
a game against the Buffalo Bills, then an American Football League team. 
Several decades later, the American Bowl and later the Bills Toronto Series 
brought both preseason and regular season games to the Rogers Centre.[1][2] 
There have been several failed attempts to establish a professional American 
football franchise in Toronto in the past. A Toronto group submitted a 
bid for an American Football League expansion team for the city in 1960, 
the expansion fee set at $125,000, with plans to play in the league's second 
season in the following year.[143][144][145] Toronto interests continued 
pursuing an AFL team for several years,[146] with the league naming the 
city as a potential expansion market in 1965.[147] In 1964 a Toronto group 
applied for a United Football League franchise,[148][149][150] but ultimately 
withdrew their bid for a team.[151] Following the season, a Toronto group 
attempted to purchase the Canton Bulldogs of the UFL to relocate them to 
Toronto.[152][153] When the Continental Football League was established 
for the 1965 season with former UFL teams, the Quebec Rifles of the UFL 
were admitted and transferred to Toronto to become the Toronto Rifles due 
to a lack of a suitable facility in Montreal.[152][154][155][156] The Rifles 
competed in the Continental League from 1965–67, but the owners pulled 
out in the middle of their final season after having lost a reported $400,000 
in their final full season.[157] The league took over the club and planned 
to have it play all of its games on the road, but several weeks later the 
team folded.[158][159] During John Bassett's ownership of the Argonauts 
from the late 1950s to early 1970s, he entertained various machinations 
for bringing American football to Toronto, including moving the Argos to 
the NFL or bringing an NFL team to the city alongside the Argos.[160][161][162] 
Other CFL team owners were steadfastly against Bassett's moves and almost 
rescinded his franchise in 1974.[163] His son John F. Bassett obtained 
a World Football League franchise for the city in the league's inaugural 
season of 1974, which he named the Toronto Northmen, but in response the 
Canadian government proposed the Canadian Football Act, a bill that would 
have banned US football leagues from playing in Canada to protect the CFL 
from competition.[141][164] The bill forced Bassett to move the club to 
Memphis where they became the Memphis Southmen.[165] When the legislation 
died without being approved before the 1974 Canadian federal election, 
Bassett again attempted to put a team in Toronto for the 1975 season.[166][167][168][169] 
There were plans to establish a United States Football League franchise 
in Toronto in 1983 being pushed by John F. Bassett, but again the Canadian 
government warned against it and the idea was dropped.[141][170] The XFL 
considered expanding to Toronto for 2002, but ultimately folded after its 
inaugural season in 2001.[171][172][173] There have been efforts to bring 
an NFL team to Toronto for more than 40 years.[174] As of 2014, it has 
been widely reported that Toronto interests, including Larry Tanenbaum, 
part owner of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), and Edward Rogers 
III, Deputy Chairman of Rogers Communication, are attempting to acquire 
a NFL franchise in hopes of moving it to Toronto.[175][176][177][178] There 
were numerous attempts to bring the Arena Football League to Maple Leaf 
Gardens in the 1990s.[179] The city was considered by the league for a 
1996 and 1997 expansion club, with John Bitove, owner of the Toronto Raptors, 
one of several groups interested in owning the team.[180][181][182] MLSE 
held negotiations with the Arena League on acquiring a $4–7 million expansion 
franchise for 1999 to coincide with the opening of their new building the 
ACC.[183][184] Several other groups also considered putting a club in the 
ACC following its opening.[185][186] In 2000, the New England Sea Wolves 
were purchased by a group led by Rogers Communication and relocated from 
Hartford, Connecticut, becoming the Toronto Phantoms the following year.[187] 
However, the team lasted only two seasons before folding when the Arena 
League switched its regular season window from the summer to the spring.[188] 
Toronto has also hosted the Vanier Cup Championship 41 times, the most 
out of any host city, serving as its exclusive host from its inception 
in 1965 until 2003. In 2004, Canadian Interuniversity Sport began accepting 
bids from other cities to host the event. Since then, Toronto has won 2 
additional bids to host Vanier Cup Championships in 2007 & 2012 to coincide 
with both the 95th & 100th Grey Cups being played during the same weekend 
in the city. Toronto was also host to a series of NCAA football bowl games 
called the International Bowl between 2007 and 2010. Toronto was granted 
an expansion team in the Lingerie Football League, called the Toronto Triumph. 
The Triumph began in 2011 and played their games at the Ricoh Coliseum. 
The league is legitimate indoor football, played by women dressed in lingerie. 
The popularity of soccer reflects the city's demographics; Toronto is a 
multicultural city with a large immigrant population that has long-established 
roots with the game. Toronto has had teams in a number of first division 
soccer leagues of the United States. The Toronto Greenbacks were members 
of the North American Soccer Football League for its two years of existence 
in 1946-47.[189][190] In 1967, two rival leagues began play: the United 
Soccer Association (USA) and National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). 
Both leagues had Toronto-based clubs with Toronto City (owned by future 
owner of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Steve Stavro) joining the USA 
and the Toronto Falcons in the NPSL and both playing their games at Varsity 
Stadium.[191][192] Following the merger of the two leagues for the 1968 
season only the Falcons survived, with Stavro selling his team back to 
the league for $160,000.[193][194] However, the Falcons only played a single 
year in the newly founded North American Soccer League (NASL) with losses 
reported to be up to $500,000 before folding.[195] The following year, 
Toronto City was invited to join the NASL.[196] Subsequently, the Toronto 
Metros joined the NASL in 1971,[197] and though they were renamed the Toronto 
Metros-Croatia in 1975 following the purchase of 50% of the club for $250,000 
by the Toronto Croatia of the National Soccer League,[198] and again in 
1979 to the Toronto Blizzard following the acquisition of 85% of the team 
by Global Television Network for $2.6 million,[199][200] the team played 
until the NASL folded in 1984. In 1994, then part owner of the SkyDome 
Labatt considered purchasing a team in Major League Soccer (MLS), the new 
top US league, to play at the stadium.[201] In 2004, then Toronto Argonauts 
owners Howard Sokolowski and David Cynamon considered bringing a MLS team 
to the city in connection with negotiations on the construction of a new 
stadium to jointly house the Argos and soccer,[202] but when BMO Field 
was ultimately built the Argos were excluded for the deal.[201] In 2007, 
Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment launched Toronto FC in MLS as its first 
international team. Toronto has also hosted professional indoor soccer 
teams. The Metros-Croatia fielded a team in NASL's indoor league from 1975–76,[203] 
as did the Blizzard in 1980-82.[204] The Major Indoor Soccer League considered 
putting a team in Toronto in 1987.[205] In 1988 the American Indoor Soccer 
Association (AISA) granted Toronto a franchise which was to play its games 
at Hamilton, Ontario's Copps Coliseum,[206] but the team never launched. 
The Toronto Shooting Stars competed in the National Professional Soccer 
League, as the AISA had renamed itself, during the 1996-97 season, but 
the ownership of the franchise collapsed just 3 games in, forcing the league 
to take control of the team's operations for the remainder of the season.[207] 
After losses of nearly $1 million, the team suspended operations and never 
returned to play.[208][209] An application was made for a new NPSL Toronto 
team in 1998.[210] The NPSL returned to Toronto with the Toronto ThunderHawks 
for the 2000–01 season, playing at the Hershey Centre in Mississauga, Ontario.[211] 
When the NPSL disbanded in the summer of 2001 and reorganized as the Major 
Indoor Soccer League, the ThunderHawks were admitted to the new league 
under the condition that they would suspend operations for the 2001–02 
season to work on the business side of the franchise and return to active 
competition for the 2002–03 season.[212] However, the team never returned 
from this temporary suspension of operations. Toronto has also been home 
to numerous minor pro soccer teams. The Toronto Blizzard played in the 
Canadian Soccer League from 1987 to 1992 and the American Professional 
Soccer League in 1993 before folding following the United States Soccer 
Federation's decision to reject the APSL's bid for sanctioning as a first 
division league in favour of a competing bid from the group that would 
found MLS. The Blizzard were replaced in the APSL by the Toronto Rockets 
in 1994, but they to folded prior to the following season. The A-League, 
as the APSL was then known, awarded Toronto another team to begin play 
in 1997.[213][214] When the A-league and USISL Select League merged for 
the 1997 season, the Toronto expansion team, which was named the Toronto 
Lynx, debuted in the combined league, which carried on the A-League name. 
The Lynx would play in the A-League until 2004. When the league was renamed 
the USL First Division, they continued their membership. However, in 2007, 
with the arrival of TFC to the city, the Lynx dropped down to the fourth 
USL Premier Development League, in which they have competed ever since. 
Toronto hosted parts of the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. Toronto also hosted 
the 2010 Major League Soccer championship match between FC Dallas and Colorado 
Rapids (Colorado defeated Dallas 2-1). It was the first time the MLS cup 
took place outside of the United States. The Ontario Rugby league competition 
has 2 Toronto based teams in the Toronto Centurions and Toronto City Saints 
the other 2 teams which make up the competition are Brantford Broncos and 
Oakville Crusaders not too far from Toronto.[215] In 2014, Toronto investors 
submitted an application for a professional rugby league franchise in the 
British/French League 1, the third-tier of the RFL league system. It was 
announced in 2016 that the Toronto Wolfpack would join the Rugby Football 
League's League One from April 2017, becoming the first professional transatlantic 
sports team.[216] The team will play at Toronto's 9,600 seat Lamport Stadium,[217] 
with the goal of earning promotion to the top-tier Super League.[218][219] 
The Canada national rugby league team, nicknamed the Wolverines, are also 
based at Lamport Stadium. The semi-pro rugby union team the Toronto Rebellion 
(formerly the Renegades and Xtreme) played in the Rugby Canada Super League 
from 1999 to 2007 and the Rugby Canada National Junior Championship in 
2009. The team hosted games at Markham, Ontario's Fletcher's Fields in 
the north of the Greater Toronto Area. The team was replaced by the Ontario 
Blues of the Canadian Rugby Championship in 2009, who play their games 
at various locations across the province including Fletcher's Fields. In 
2016, the United States based PRO Rugby league stated that it was considering 
expanding to Toronto,[220] though the plans fell through.[221] The Toronto 
Rock, which operate in the National Lacrosse League, were founded in 1998 
as the Ontario Raiders in Hamilton. The following year, the team moved 
to Toronto proceeded to finish first every year from 1999 to 2005 and won 
the league championship in five of those seven seasons. The city previously 
had several professional box lacrosse teams. A team named the Toronto Maple 
Leafs competed in the first season of the professional International Lacrosse 
League at the Arena Gardens.[222][223] Following the season, a new franchise 
was awarded to Conn Smythe on behalf of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. (MLGL),[224][225] 
which was also named the Toronto Maple Leafs, with the 1931 Maple Leafs 
being renamed the Tecumsehs.[222][225] Both teams played at the newly opened 
Maple Leaf Gardens.[226][227] Smythe pulled out following the season due 
to financial losses,[228] and the league didn't play the following year. 
Toronto also had a team in the American Box Lacrosse League in 1932.[229][230][231] 
The Toronto Maple Leafs competed in the inaugural season of the National 
Lacrosse Association in 1968 at the Gardens.[232] Stafford Smythe and Harold 
Ballard, part owners of the NHL Maple Leafs, were two of the five founding 
partners of the club,[233] but financial difficulties forced MLGL to take 
over ownership midway though the season.[232][234][235] The NLA suspended 
operations prior to the following season.[235][236] However, the eastern 
division of the NLA reconstituted itself as the Eastern Professional Lacrosse 
Association, in which the Maple Leafs competed in 1969.[237][238][239] 
By 1970 the pro league league had disbanded. The Toronto Shooting Stars 
joined the professional National Lacrosse League (unrelated to the modern 
NLL) for its inaugural season in 1972.[240][241] When a new professional 
league launched as the National Lacrosse League (again unrelated to today's 
NLL) in 1974, the Toronto Tomahawks were included as a charter franchise. 
The Shooting Stars continued as an amateur team in the Ontario Lacrosse 
Association,[242][243] but folded following the 1974 season.[244] The Tomahawks 
were sold following the 1974 season,[245][246] and received league approval 
to move the team to Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Long Island, New 
York.[247][248] However, ultimately it was decided to relocate the team 
to Boston to become the Boston Bolts for the start of the 1975 NLL season,[244][249][250] 
with the Rochester Griffins becoming the Long Island Tomahawks.[244][249][251] 
In 2009, the Toronto Nationals of Major League Lacrosse was established, 
with much of the roster of the Rochester Rattlers, which would be suspended, 
being transferred to the new Nationals' team. However, the name, colours, 
and history stayed behind in Rochester to potentially be used by a future 
MLL team.[252] In their inaugural year in Toronto, the Nationals went on 
to win the Steinfeld Cup. In 2011, the team relocated to Hamilton, Ontario, 
and after the 2013 season the team announced they would not field a team 
the following season. The Caribbean Premier League professional Twenty20 
cricket league has discussed it's desire to place a franchise in Toronto.[253][254] 
Toronto currently has seven different Australian rules football teams called 
the Broadview Hawks, High Park Demons, Central Blues, Etobicoke Kangaroos, 
Lakeshore Rebels, Toronto Downtown Dingos, and the Toronto Eagles. There 
are two more Ontario Australian Football League teams in the surrounding 
areas, the Hamilton Wildcats and the Guelph Gargoyles. The city hosts the 
Honda Indy Toronto in July which is a street circuit that runs through 
Exhibition Place and Lake Shore Boulevard. Historically, the city played 
host to the 1958 Jim Mideon 500, a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing event. 
Legendary NASCAR athlete Lee Petty won this race defeating his son Richard 
in his Cup Series debut. Canadian Tire Motorsports Park, located approximately 
100 km east of Toronto in the community of Bowmanville, hosts a United 
SportsCar Championship and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race yearly, 
along with various other events. The track also hosted Formula One's Canadian 
Grand Prix from 1961 to 1977 (except for 1968 and 1970). The Canada Masters, 
currently sponsored as the Rogers Cup, is an annual tennis tournament held 
in Canada. The men's competition is an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event 
on the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tour. The women's competition 
is a Premier 5 event on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour. The 
events alternate from year-to-year between the cities of Montreal and Toronto. 
In odd-numbered years, the men's tournament is held in Montreal, while 
the women's tournament is held in Toronto, and vice versa in even-numbered 
years. The competition is played on hard courts. Ultimate is a team sport 
played with a flying disc. The object of the game is to score points by 
passing the disc to members of your own team, on a rectangular field approximately 
the size of a soccer field, until you have successfully completed a pass 
to a team member in the opposing teams end zone. In the 1970s, Ken Westerfield 
introduced disc sports including ultimate north of the 49th parallel at 
the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships and by creating the Toronto Ultimate 
League (Club).[255] Since 1998, Canada has been ranked number one in the 
World Ultimate Rankings, several times in all divisions (including Open 
and Women's) according to the World Flying Disc Federation.[256] In 2013, 
as a founding partner, the Toronto Ultimate Club presented Canada's first 
semi-professional ultimate team the Toronto Rush, to the American Ultimate 
Disc League (AUDL).[257][258] They finished their first season undefeated 
18-0 and won the AUDL Championships.[259][260][261] Disc ultimate has become 
one of today's fastest growing sports.[262] In 2015, the International 
Olympic Committee (IOC) granted full recognition to the World Flying Disc 
Federation (WFDF) for flying disc sports including ultimate.[263][264] 
Horse racing is currently done at the Woodbine Racetracks. Woodbine Racetrack 
in the northwestern suburb of Rexdale in Toronto, Ontario is the only horseracing 
track in North America which stages, or is capable of staging, thoroughbred 
and standardbred horseracing programs on the same day. Woodbine hosts two 
of the three legs of the Canadian Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing—the 
opening Queen's Plate on its Polytrack synthetic dirt course, and the closing 
Breeders' Stakes on grass. Toronto has submitted bids to host the Summer 
Olympic Games five times over the years: 1960, 1964, 1976, 1996 and 2008.[265] 
The closest it came to winning the games was in 2008, when it finished 
second to Beijing by a vote of 56-22. Varsity Stadium, home of the Argonauts, 
hosted some soccer games of the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 2009, Toronto 
submitted a bid to host the Pan American Games and Parapan American Games, 
subsequently winning both of them for 2015. After successfully hosting 
both the 2015 Pan American Games & 2015 Parapan American Games, the city 
briefly considered another Olympic bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics,[265] 
but on September 15, 2015, Toronto Mayor John Tory announced that the city 
would not be a candidate for a bid.[266] Due to their geographic locations, 
Toronto has an intense sports rivalry with many cities around the Great 
Lakes. For football, Toronto has a rivalry with Hamilton (begun in 1873[267] 
and is heightened during the Labour Day Classic), Ottawa and as far as 
Montreal. In hockey, Toronto's rivals include the Montreal Canadiens the 
Ottawa Senators (often dubbed the "Battle of Ontario"), and the Detroit
