Henry Eugene Bearden (September 5, 1920 – March 18, 2004) was an American 
left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Cleveland 
Indians, Washington Senators, Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Browns and Chicago 
White Sox between 1947 and 1953. He is best known for his pitching heroics 
during his rookie season, 1948, when he led the Indians to the American 
League pennant and World Series championship. Born in Lexa, Arkansas, and 
raised in Tennessee, Bearden was listed at 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall 
and weighed 198 pounds (90 kg). Bearden's rookie season was all the more 
remarkable because, five years earlier, he had been seriously injured in 
battle in World War II. Serving in the United States Navy aboard the USS Helena 
in the Pacific Theater of Operations, he was working in the engine room 
of the light cruiser when it was struck by three Japanese torpedoes on 
July 6, 1943, during the Battle of Kula Gulf.[1] Forced to abandon ship 
as the Helena sank, Bearden fell from a ladder on the deck and sustained 
a fractured skull and a crushed kneecap; hospitalized until early 1945, 
he underwent surgeries that inserted metal plates in his head and knee 
to treat his injuries.[1][2] In a 1949 autobiographical article published 
in The Sporting News' Official Baseball Register, Bearden declined to discuss 
his wartime experience, saying: "I was just another gob, luckier than many, 
because I met up with a doctor who is, to me, the best orthopedic surgeon 
in the business."[3] Bearden had been a pitcher in the lower levels of 
minor league baseball before the war. Despite 18 and 17 victory seasons 
in the Class D Florida East Coast League in 1940–41, he had bounced between 
three organizations before joining the military. In 1945, just months after 
his release from the hospital, he returned to baseball and won 15 games 
in the Class A Eastern League. Promoted to the Triple-A Oakland Oaks in 
1946, he learned to throw the knuckleball under manager Casey Stengel[2] 
and had another 15-victory season. He would become primarily a knuckleball 
pitcher, although he also threw a fastball, slider, curveball and an occasional 
screwball.[4] On December 6, 1946, the New York Yankees, who held Bearden's 
big-league rights, traded him in a five-player deal to the Indians. Bearden 
couldn't stick with Cleveland in 1947; he was roughed up by the lowly St. 
Louis Browns in his only MLB appearance on May 10. Sent to the Triple-A 
Baltimore Orioles of the International League, he jumped the team after 
two defeats and refused to return until Indians' owner Bill Veeck agreed 
to loan Bearden back to the Oakland Oaks.[3] He then won 16 games for Stengel 
in the PCL. Bearden earned a place on the 1948 Indians' roster out of spring 
training but did not appear in a game until May 8. He proceeded to win 
six of his first seven starting assignments, with four complete games and 
two shutouts, on May 22 and June 8 against the Boston Red Sox, who would 
battle the Indians and Yankees down to the wire for the 1948 AL title. 
By September 1, Bearden had fashioned a 13–6 won-loss record with an earned 
run average of 2.74. Bearden lost his first September start, on the sixth 
against the White Sox, then won his next seven starts and also hurled effectively 
in relief. With Bearden pitching complete game shutouts on September 28 
and October 2, the Indians and Red Sox finished in a flatfooted tie for 
the league championship on Sunday, October 3. For the one-game playoff, 
set for Fenway Park on Monday, October 4, Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau 
went with Bearden as his starting pitcher, and on only one day of rest, 
Bearden pitched another complete game triumph, shutting down the power-hitting 
Red Sox on only five hits and one earned run. Cleveland won, 8–3, behind 
Boudreau's four hits and two home runs. The win gave Bearden 20 victories 
(against seven defeats) and the 1948 AL earned-run average championship 
(2.47). But Bearden was not finished. In the 1948 World Series against 
the Boston Braves, he threw a complete game, five-hit shutout in Game 3, 
defeating the Braves 2–0 on October 8. An excellent-hitting pitcher, he 
helped his own cause at bat by getting two hits (including a double) in 
three at bats, and scored a run. Then, in Game 6 on October 11, he preserved 
the Indians' Series-clinching win for starter Bob Lemon. He allowed two 
inherited runners to score in the eighth inning but shut the door on the 
Braves, earned the save and was charged with no runs allowed himself, finishing 
the game as Cleveland won 4–3 to become world champions. Sixty years later, 
his rookie season of 1948 was rated as the top overall rookie season of 
any athlete of a Cleveland professional sports franchise in The Great Book 
of Cleveland Sports Lists.[5] In addition to his ERA title, he finished 
among the top ten American League pitchers in victories (second), shutouts 
(second, with six), winning percentage (second), fewest hits per innings 
pitched (third), walks plus hits per inning pitched (fourth), wins above 
replacement (fifth), innings pitched (seventh), complete games (eighth), 
and finished eighth in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting. 
But despite his stellar season, Bearden was not named "Rookie of the Year." 
Only one award was given in the Major Leagues at the time, and Alvin Dark 
of the National League Boston Braves was its recipient.[2] The Cy Young 
Award for the most outstanding pitcher would not be instituted until after 
the 1956 season. 1948 was Bearden's only season as an effective big-league 
pitcher. In 1949, he fell to 8–8 (5.10), and his wildness increased: he 
led the AL in wild pitches (with 11) and walked 92 men with only 41 strikeouts. 
His performance continued to decline in 1950, and the Indians placed him 
on waivers; he was picked up by Washington in August. Then, from 1951–53, 
he bounced from the Senators to the Tigers, Browns and White Sox. Apart 
from his 1948 brilliance, Bearden won only 25 of 56 decisions, and allowed 
604 hits and 329 walks in 558 2⁄3 innings pitched, with an earned run average 
of 4.59. He threw only two shutouts after 1948. Overall he compiled a 45–38 
win-loss mark and 3.96 earned run average in 193 games pitched in the Majors, 
with 791 hits and 435 bases on balls allowed, and 259 strikeouts, in 788 
1⁄3 innings of work. Growing up near Memphis, Tennessee, he idolized Lou 
Gehrig[6] and was a polished, left-handed hitter who often played first 
base during his minor league career. As a big-leaguer, he compiled a .236 
lifetime batting average with 68 total hits, four home runs and 32 runs 
batted in, and was sometimes used as a pinch hitter. In 1952, as a St. 
Louis Brown, Bearden collected 23 hits and batted .354. He resumed his 
minor league career in the top-level Pacific Coast League and American 
Association after 1953 and won 18 games for the 1955 San Francisco Seals. 
During his active career, he lived in California and during his off-seasons 
worked in the motion picture industry as both an extra and backstage crew 
member.[3] After his 1957 retirement, he was involved in a number of business 
ventures and was a youth baseball coach.[2] Bearden died in Alexander City,
