The 2008 Chicago Cubs season was the 137th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 133rd in the National League and the 93rd at Wrigley Field. The season 
began at home on March 31 against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Cubs were 
champions of the National League Central Division for the second year in 
a row, accumulating 97 regular season wins—the most since 1945. It was 
the first time since 1908 that the Cubs made postseason appearances in 
consecutive seasons.[1] At the All-Star break in July, the Cubs led the 
NL Central and were tied with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for the 
best record in the major leagues.[2] They tied a National League record 
with eight players selected to the All-Star team.[3] On September 20, the 
Cubs clinched the NL Central championship with a 5–4 win over the St. Louis 
Cardinals.[4] Despite their regular season success, the team did not advance 
past the first round of the playoffs; they were swept 3–0 by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers in the National League Division Series. Lou Piniella, in his second 
year as the Cubs' manager, won the National League's Manager of the Year 
Award in 2008. In addition, catcher Geovany Soto won the 2008 National 
League Rookie of the Year Award.[1] In 2007, Ernie Banks had requested 
that Evanston, Illinois native Eddie Vedder write the Cubs a song, and 
in August 2008 Vedder recorded "All the Way", which was released on September 
18, 2008.[5] During the season, a new version of "Go, Cubs, Go" was recorded 
and released by the Manic Sewing Circle,[6] although the original 1984 
Steve Goodman version became the official Cubs victory song.[7] The Chicago 
Cubs were eliminated from the playoffs after Los Angeles won the series,
