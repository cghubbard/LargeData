The Pan American Baseball Confederation (Confederación Panamericana de 
Béisbol or COPABE), is the governing body of baseball within the Americas. 
Talks of the need of a baseball confederation in the Americas sparked with 
the founding of the Confederation of European Baseball back in the 1950s, 
although it was not until 1984, during the World Cup played in Cuba, that 
12 countries of the Americas finally voted in favor of a formation of a 
confederation. The first ever Confederaciòn Panamericana de Béisbol (COPABE) 
executive meeting was held on March 1985, and 11 countries participated 
in its first ever Congress on March 15. The Congress saw the election of 
Oswaldo Matias Flores (Cuba) as the first president of the organization. 
On October 5, 1987, the first Pan American Championship was played (Cuba 
won the tournament). The day after the final game of the tournament was 
held, the Congress elected Edwin Zerpa Pizzorno (Venezuela) as the next 
president of the organization. In the late 1980s and early 1990s COPABE 
concentrated on developing tournaments at the youth level all over the 
Americas. Since the rankings were first released by the International Baseball 
Federation (IBAF) until 2014, Cuba had maintained its position as the top 
national baseball team in the world, and by extension the top-ranked team 
in the Pan American Baseball Confederation. With the teams of United States, 
Cuba, Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela, COPABE is the most represented confederation
