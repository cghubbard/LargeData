David Brown (born June 9, 1895)[1] was a left-handed pitcher in Negro league 
baseball. Considered one of the better pitchers in negro league history, 
he was also known for serious off-the-field problems. His career came to 
a premature end when he became a fugitive after allegedly killing a man 
in 1925. Brown was born in Leon County, Texas.[1] He had a good curveball 
and excellent control. He was also a good fielder and had outstanding speed 
but was a weak hitter. Brown played with the Dallas Black Giants in 1917 
and 1918.[2] He was regarded as a "timid nice guy" who did not cause trouble, 
but during his time with the Dallas Black Giants he was involved in a highway 
robbery.[3] Although Brown was reported to have become a fugitive, Rube 
Foster agreed to pay $20,000 for Brown's parole and he became a member 
of Foster's Chicago American Giants.[3][4] Brown became the ace of the 
American Giants as they dominated negro league baseball in the early 1920s. 
From 1920 through 1922, he posted a 29-8 record in league games.[3] His 
11-3 record led them to a pennant win in 1921 including three victories 
in a playoff with the Bacharach Giants.[3][5] His 8-3 record contributed 
to another pennant in 1922.[6] In the winter following the 1922 season, 
Brown joined Oscar Charleston for the first season of the Cuban League's 
Santa Clara Leopardos.[7] For the 1923 season, Brown left Rube Foster's 
American Giants for the brand new Eastern Colored League. Foster voiced 
his displeasure, pointing out that Brown had been paroled to him and that 
he had promised Brown's mother to take care of him. He pointed out that 
the public would vilify him if he revoked.[4] Brown posted a losing record 
in his first season with the New York Lincoln Giants but he and Charleston 
returned to Cuba the following winter and helped Santa Clara compile one 
of the best records in Cuban baseball history.[8][9] His second season 
with the Lincoln Giants improved on the first and he defeated "Cannonball" 
Dick Redding and the Brooklyn Royal Giants to win the New York City championship.[3] 
Brown's career came to an abrupt end in 1925. He went to a bar one night 
with Frank Wickware and Oliver Marcelle.[8][10] Marcelle was a third baseman 
with a reputation for trouble off the field.[10] A fight erupted at the 
bar, possibly involving cocaine, and Brown killed one of the participants. 
Wickware and Marcelle were questioned the next day at the ballpark, but 
Brown had disappeared.[8] The FBI searched for Brown but he was never officially 
seen again. Rumors abounded that he continued playing baseball under the 
alias "Lefty Wilson" with semi-professional teams through the Midwestern 
United States. Lefty Wilson toured with Gilkerson's Union Giants in 1926,[11] 
a white team in Bertha, Minnesota in 1927 and 1928, and he was rumored 
to have played in Sioux City, Iowa in 1929 and Little Falls, Minnesota 
in 1930. More unsubstantiated rumors claimed that Brown died under mysterious 
conditions in Denver, Colorado in 1930.[8] However, Lefty Wilson shows 
up again pitching for the Gilkerson's Union Giants again in 1932. In 1927, 
a Pittsburgh Courier column solicited opinions for the best black baseball 
player of all time. On April 2, John Henry Lloyd announced his list which 
included Dave Brown.[12] When the Pittsburgh Courier announced a similar
