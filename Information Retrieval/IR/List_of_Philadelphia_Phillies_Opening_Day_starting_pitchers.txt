The Philadelphia Phillies are a Major League Baseball franchise based in 
Philadelphia. They play in the National League East division. Also known 
in early franchise history as the "Philadelphia Quakers",[1] the Phillies 
have used 72 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 128 seasons. 
The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening 
Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often 
given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[2] 
though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might 
not start on Opening Day.[3] Where decisions are known, the 72 starters 
have a combined Opening Day record of 33 wins, 40 losses and 20 no decisions (33–40–20); 
where decisions are unknown, the team's record was 17–19. No decisions 
are awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the 
starting pitcher has left the game. It can also result if a starting pitcher 
does not pitch five full innings, even if his team retains the lead and 
wins.[4] Hall of Fame left-handed pitcher Steve Carlton has the most Opening 
Day starts for the Phillies, with 14,[5] compiling a record of 3–9–2. He 
is followed by Robin Roberts (twelve starts; 5–6–1), Chris Short (six starts; 
3–1–2), and Curt Schilling (five starts; 2–0–3). Grover Cleveland Alexander 
also made five Opening Day starts for the Phillies, equal to Schilling; 
however, no information on his decisions in those games is available. The 
team's record in his five Opening Day starts is 4–1. Roberts holds the 
Phillies' record for most wins in Opening Day starts with five. Art Mahaffey 
has the best record in Opening Day starts for the franchise; though many 
players have won their only Opening Day start, Mahaffey started and won 
two Opening Day games, for a winning percentage of 1.000; Roy Halladay 
also has a 1.000 winning percentage, with two wins and a no decision in 
three starts. Conversely, George McQuillan is the only player to have a 
.000 winning percentage in more than one Opening Day start (0–2–0 in two 
starts). Brett Myers has a .000 winning percentage in his three starts, 
but has accumulated two no decisions (0–1–2). Carlton has the most Opening 
Day losses for the team, with nine. The Phillies have played in six home 
ballparks. Their best overall Opening Day record is at Shibe Park (also 
known as Connie Mack Stadium), where they won 11 Opening Day games out 
of 14 played there (11–3). The team also owned an 8–17 Opening Day record 
at Baker Bowl (initially known as the Philadelphia Baseball Grounds), with 
1 tie. Recreation Park's Opening Day record is 1–2, while Veterans Stadium 
has the lowest winning percentage (.200), with 2 wins and 8 losses. The 
Phillies currently play at Citizens Bank Park, where they are 1–5 on Opening 
Day. The Phillies have played in seven World Series championships in their 
history, winning in 1980 and 2008. Carlton won his Opening Day start against 
the Montreal Expos in 1980,[6] while Myers received a no-decision against 
the same franchise (now the Washington Nationals) in 2008, a game that 
the Phillies eventually lost,[7] and lost the opening game against the 
Atlanta Braves in 2009. Carlton also started Opening Day in 1983,[8] the 
year that the Phillies lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.[9] 
Alexander started Opening Day in 1915,[10] the Phillies' first World Series 
appearance,[1] while Roberts started the first game of 1950,[11] and Terry
