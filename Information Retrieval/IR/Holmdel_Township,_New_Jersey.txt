Holmdel Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 16,773,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 992 (+6.3%) from the 15,781 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 4,249 (+36.8%) from the 11,532 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] Holmdel Township was formed by an act of the New 
Jersey Legislature on February 23, 1857, from portions of Raritan Township 
(now Hazlet).[21] The origin of the township's name is unclear, with some 
sources indicating that it was named for the Holmes family, who were early 
settlers of the area, while others point to Dutch language words Holm and 
Del, meaning "pleasant valley".[22][23] Holmdel is located 15 miles (24 km) 
west of the Jersey Shore. The township is notable, among other things, 
for its historical and present connection to Bell Labs. Important evidence 
for the Big Bang was discovered at a Bell Labs facility in Holmdel by Arno 
Penzias and Robert Wilson, both of whom won the Nobel Prize in Physics 
for their work here.[24] Holmdel's picturesque beauty, proximity to New 
York City and main highways, award-winning public schools, large homes, 
rich history, PNC Bank Arts Center, and the presence of many high paying 
jobs within commuting distance led the township to be ranked the #1 "Six-Figure 
Town" by Money magazine and CNN for 2009.[25] The earliest work on radio 
astronomy was conducted by Bell Labs engineer Karl Guthe Jansky in 1931 
in Holmdel.[26][27][28] In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson 
of Bell Labs discovered evidence for cosmic microwave background radiation 
while performing research with the Holmdel Horn Antenna, earning them the 
Nobel Prize in Physics.[29] The PNC Bank Arts Center is a 10,800-seat outdoor 
amphitheatre concert venue located in Holmdel. PNC Financial Services agreed 
to a deal in 1996 under which it would pay $9.2 million for the naming 
rights, as part an effort by the Parkway Authority to avoid toll increases, 
a deal that was extended for another five years in 2006.[30][31] The facility, 
which originally opened in 1968, was commissioned by the Garden State Parkway 
Authority at a cost of $6.75 million and built based on a design by architect 
Edward Durell Stone.[32][33] Adjacent to it is the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial, which opened on May 7, 1995.[34] In 1977, Bruce Springsteen wrote 
and recorded many of his songs from his album Darkness on the Edge of Town 
in an old farmhouse in Holmdel.[35] VoIP provider Vonage Holdings, Inc., 
moved its world headquarters from Edison to Holmdel in November 2005, occupying 
the building that formerly housed Prudential Property Casualty & Insurance.[36] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total
