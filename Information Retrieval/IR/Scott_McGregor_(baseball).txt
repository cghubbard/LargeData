Scott Houston McGregor (born January 18, 1954) is a former Major League 
Baseball player, a pitcher who spent his entire career with the Baltimore 
Orioles from 1976 to 1988. He is the pitching coach for the Aberdeen IronBirds. 
McGregor grew up in southern California and played baseball at El Segundo 
High School with future Hall of Famer George Brett.[1] He was in the New 
York Yankees' organization until June 1976, when he was part of a ten-player 
deal.[2] McGregor was selected to the American League All-Star team in 
1981. He won 20 games in 1980 and was solid in two postseasons with the 
Orioles in 1979 and 1983. McGregor sent the Orioles to the World Series 
by clinching the 1979 ALCS with a Game 4 shutout of the California Angels. 
He also pitched a complete game victory in Pittsburgh in Game 3 of the 
World Series. Despite taking the loss in Game 7, McGregor yielded only 
two runs in 8 innings to Willie Stargell and the eventual champion Pirates. 
In the 1983 postseason, McGregor allowed only two runs in the openers of 
the ALCS and World Series, but lost both games by scores of 2-1 to the 
White Sox and Phillies, respectively. However, in Game 5, he shut out the 
Phillies in a complete game to end the series, four games to one. After 
the 1983 World Series, he remained a starting pitcher on the Orioles for 
the next five seasons and made his final appearance on April 27, 1988. 
McGregor was named interim Orioles bullpen coach in late 2013 replacing 
Bill Castro who was promoted to pitching coach. He did not return in 2014.
