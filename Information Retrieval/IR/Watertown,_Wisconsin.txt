Watertown is a city in Dodge and Jefferson counties in the US state of 
Wisconsin. Most of the city's population is in Jefferson County. Division 
Street, several blocks north of downtown, marks the county line. The population 
of Watertown was 23,861 at the 2010 census.[6] Of this, 15,402 were in 
Jefferson County, and 8,459 were in Dodge County. Watertown is the largest 
city in the Watertown-Fort Atkinson micropolitan area, which also includes 
Johnson Creek and Jefferson. Watertown was first settled by Timothy Johnson, 
who built a cabin on the west side of the Rock River in 1836. He was born 
in Middleton, Middlesex County, Connecticut, on the 28th of June, 1792.[7] 
A park on the west side of the city is named in his honor. The area was 
settled to utilize the power of the Rock River, which falls 20 feet (6.1 m) 
in two miles (two 10-foot (3.0 m) dams). In contrast, the Rock River falls 
only 34 feet (10 m) in 58 miles (93 km) upstream from Watertown.[8] The 
water power was first used for sawmills, and later prompted the construction 
of two hydroelectric dams, one downtown (where the river flows south) and 
one on the eastern edge of the city (where the river flows north). In the 
1850s, German immigrants arrived in Watertown from Germany. These people 
were fleeing revolutions and turmoil in Germany, which often saw pogroms 
against the wealthy. It was deemed better to be poor or middle class in 
America than it was to be wealthy in Germany, as a result most of the German 
immigrants who arrived in Watertown brought with them the trappings of 
the German middle class, including a proclivity for classical music, the 
Latin language and ornate furniture. Unlike other instances in other parts 
of the country in which they faced discrimination and xenophobia, they 
were welcomed with open arms by the English-Puritan descended "Yankee" 
population of Watertown and Jefferson County as a whole. This warm reception 
led to chain migration, which in turn greatly increased the German population 
of the region. Culturally they had much in common with the New England 
derived population, for instance both groups unanimously opposed slavery 
and both had a pronounced love for commerce and industry. Economically 
both communities would thrive in Watertown for the entirety of the 19th 
century, not facing any measurable economic hardships until the Great Depression 
in the following century.[9] A canal from Milwaukee to the Watertown area 
was once planned, but was replaced by railroad before any work had been 
completed, other than a dam in Milwaukee.[10] The territorial legislature 
incorporated the Milwaukee and Rock River Canal company in 1836, but the 
plan was abandoned in 1848. The canal would have provided a waterway between 
the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, but even if completed, it may 
not have seen much success because railroads had already become the preferred 
mode of transportation. In 1853, a plank road was completed from Milwaukee 
to Watertown.[11] After plank roads were no longer used, the route was 
replaced by highway (Wisconsin Highway 16) and a railroad. A street named 
"Watertown Plank Road" survives in Milwaukee. It is referred to in the 
"Plank Road Brewery" family of beers, produced by Miller Brewing Company 
in Milwaukee. There was an influx of German immigrants in the late 19th 
century. The city is the home of the first kindergarten in the United States, 
started in 1856 by Margarethe Schurz, wife of statesman Carl Schurz; the 
building that housed this kindergarten is now located on the grounds of 
the Octagon House Museum in Watertown. Growth of the city was substantially 
hampered when Watertown issued almost half a million dollars in bonds to 
support the building of two railroads to town to encourage further growth: 
the Chicago & Fond du Lac Company and the Milwaukee, Watertown & Madison 
Road.[12] The success of the plank road convinced residents that a railroad 
would be even more beneficial, and bonds were issued from 1853 to 1855. 
The Milwaukee and Watertown Railroad, as it was called before it extended 
to Madison, was completed in 1855, only the second line in the state.[13] 
Soon after, the two railroads went bankrupt in the Panic of 1857. The bonds 
were sold by the original investors to out-of-town speculators at a small 
fraction of their face value. Since the railroads were never built and 
did not produce revenue, the city was unable to pay off the bonds. Moreover, 
the city did not feel compelled to do so because the creditors (those who 
held the bonds) were not only from out of town, but weren't even the original 
holders. Yet the creditors exerted so much pressure on the city to pay 
off the bonds that Watertown effectively dissolved its government so that 
there was no legal entity (the government as a whole or officers) that 
could be served a court order to pay or appear in court. The case was not 
resolved until 1889, when it had risen all the way to the Supreme Court 
of the United States, which essentially dismissed the case of the creditors. 
A small amount remained to be paid, and this was not paid off until 1905, 
half a century later.[14] Watertown is located in southeastern Wisconsin, 
approximately midway between Madison and Milwaukee, at 43°12'N 88°43'W 
(43.193, −88.724).[15] According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
city has a total area of 12.51 square miles (32.40 km2), of which, 12.11 
square miles (31.36 km2) is land and 0.40 square miles (1.04 km2) is water.[1] 
Small communities in the immediate area (e.g., within the school district) 
include Richwood, Lebanon, Old Lebanon, Sugar Island, Pipersville, Concord, 
Ebenezer, and Grellton. The Rock River flows through Watertown in a horseshoe 
bend before heading south and west on its way to the Mississippi River. 
The city originally developed inside the horseshoe, though it has long 
since grown beyond. Silver Creek adjoins the river in the city, as does 
a short creek on the west side. The most notable geographical feature is 
a high density of drumlins, long hills formed by the glaciers of the Wisconsin 
glaciation as they retreated northwards. Hills in the area are elongated 
in the north-south direction. As of the census of 2010, there were 23,861
