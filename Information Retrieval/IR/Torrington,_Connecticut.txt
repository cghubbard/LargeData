Torrington is the largest city in Litchfield County, Connecticut and the 
Litchfield Hills region. It is also the core city of the largest micropolitan 
area in the United States.[1] The city population was 36,383 according 
to the 2010 census. Torrington is a former mill town, as are most other 
towns along the Naugatuck River Valley. It is currently[when?] competing[citation 
needed] with the neighboring city of Winsted to re-create a pleasant Main 
Street environment.[clarification needed] Downtown Torrington is home to 
the Nutmeg Conservatory for the Arts, which trains ballet dancers and whose 
Company performs in the Warner Theatre, a 1,700 seat auditorium built in 
1931 as a cinema by the Warner Brothers film studio. Downtown Torrington 
also hosts the largest Lodge of Elks in New England. Elks Lodge #372 supports 
many community activities and events. Torrington has two radio stations, 
WAPJ 89.9 FM, operated by the non-profit Torrington Community Radio Foundation, 
and WSNG 610 AM, owned by Buckley Broadcasting. There is a University of 
Connecticut regional campus in Torrington. The 100-acre campus is located 
in a quiet rural setting on the western outskirts of the city, and consists 
of the M. Adela Eads Classroom Building and the Litchfield County Cooperative 
Extension Service Building. Torrington has two daily newspapers. The "Republican-American," 
which circulates a Litchfield County edition and has a bureau on Franklin 
Street, and The Register Citizen, a Journal Register Company publication 
that serves Torrington and Winsted, in addition to most of the Northwest 
Corner. Charlotte Hungerford Hospital has also developed into an important 
health care resource for the area. In 2008, Torrington was named by Bizjournals 
as the number one "Dreamtown" (micropolitan statistical area) out of ten 
in the United States to live in.[2] Torrington was first settled in 1735 
by Ebenezer Lyman, Jr., of Durham, Connecticut.[3] Its early settlers resided 
on the hills west of the Naugatuck River where the first school, church, 
store, and tavern were constructed. Later, the eastern hill known as Torringford 
was settled, as it provided the best farmland. Torrington was given permission 
to organize a government and incorporate as a town in October 1740. The 
fast moving waters of the Naugatuck River were used to power early nineteenth-century 
industries. Industrial growth skyrocketed when Frederick Wolcott constructed 
a woolen mill in 1813. The mill attracted a large workforce and created 
demands for goods, services, and housing. Israel Coe and Erastus Hodges 
began the construction of two brass mills on the Naugatuck River in 1834. 
This event sparked the beginning of the brass industry in Torrington, which 
later would spread throughout the entire Naugatuck Valley. In 1849, the 
Naugatuck Valley railroad was completed, connecting Torrington with other 
population centers, ending its isolation, and stimulating further industrial 
growth. Soon, Torrington was producing a variety of metal products, including 
needles, brass, hardware, bicycles, and tacks. Torrington's growing industrial 
plants attracted English, Irish, and German immigrants throughout the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries. Between 1880 and 1920, Torrington's population 
exploded from 3,000 to 22,000 as immigration from southern and eastern 
Europe increased; most immigrants during this period were Poles, Czechs, 
Slovaks, and Italians. Torrington was chartered as a city in 1923. In 1955, 
a massive flood destroyed much of the downtown area and other property 
in the region when Hurricane Connie and Hurricane Diane caused local rivers 
to overflow. Torrington is home to several state parks, one of which is 
the very popular Burr Pond State Park. In 1851, Milo Burr placed a dam 
across the confluence of several mountain streams impounding water for 
power. The tannery and three active sawmills erected downstream consumed 
the finest pines and oaks for miles around to meet the needs of lumber 
production. The clearings became homesites, and Connecticut's industrial 
leadership was further strengthened. Burr Pond was designated as a state 
park in 1949. The pond itself has several small inlets and islands. The 
shore is rocky and there are deep drop-offs in several places, but the 
pond only has a maximum depth of thirteen feet. Fish species present include 
largemouth bass, chain pickerel, black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, 
pumpkinseed, and brown bullhead. Gail Borden, discoverer of the process 
of milk preservation by evaporation and condensation, built the world's 
first condensed milk factory here, in 1857. The new milk product proved 
to be of great value, particularly to the Union Army during the Civil War. 
Fire destroyed the mill in 1877. A bronze tablet marks its site, just below 
the falls. Torrington is the birthplace of abolitionist John Brown. In 
the year 2000, the Torrington Historical Society acquired the property 
in merger with the John Brown Association. Plans are now being formulated 
to improve visitor services and to construct interpretive trails on the 
property. http://www.torringtonhistoricalsociety.org According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 40.4 square miles (104.6 km²). 
Approximately 39.8 square miles (103.1 km²) of it is land and 1.5 km² (0.6 
sq mi or 1.41%) of it is water. The eastern and western sides of the city, 
at its borders, are at the tops of peaks, while the downtown and central 
sections of the city are in the Naugatuck River Valley. This provides some 
interesting views from the higher locations, with the city lights as a 
backdrop below. Due to the lack of suitable highways and bypass routes 
in an East/West direction, crossing the city requires driving down into 
the valley and back up the other side. As of the census[6] of 2000, there 
were 35,202 people, 14,743 households, and 9,125 families residing in the 
city. The population density was 884.7 people per square mile (341.6/km²). 
There were 16,147 housing units at an average density of 405.8 per square 
mile (156.7/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 93.03% White, 2.15% 
Black or African American, 0.20% Native American, 1.83% Asian, 0.02% Pacific 
Islander, 1.31% from other races, and 1.47% from two or more races. Hispanic 
or Latino of any race were 3.30% of the population. There were 14,743 households 
out of which 28.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.7% 
were married couples living together, 10.3% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 38.1% were non-families. 32.1% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average 
family size was 2.96. In the city the population was spread out with 23.0% 
under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 22.0% from 
45 to 64, and 17.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
39 years. For every 100 females there were 93.9 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 89.0 males. The median income for a household 
in the city was $41,841, and the median income for a family was $54,375. 
Males had a median income of $37,702 versus $28,418 for females. The per 
capita income for the city was $21,406. Torrington is planning to revitalize 
its downtown area in an effort to attract residents and visitors to the 
city's shopping and cultural opportunities. These redevelopment plans are 
still in discussion and are not yet completed. The City of Torrington will 
receive $500,000 for improvements and streetscape enhancements to Torrington’s 
Main Street and downtown. The grant, which will flow through the state, 
will be designated for downtown improvements on the east side of Main Street 
and will include, among other enhancements, new sidewalks. A $750,000 grant 
for downtown improvements secured earlier in 2012 for the west side of 
Main Street will make similar improvements. The following ideas have been 
discussed: The historic restoration and renovation to downtown Coe Memorial 
Park were completed in the beginning of 2004. The Coe Memorial Park Subcommittee 
and the City of Torrington, worked closely with Ferrero Hixon Associates, 
to restore the Park to a Victorian walking park, much as it was when it 
was first gifted to the Town in 1906. These renovations included new sidewalks 
and paths, and the relocation of memorials and monuments. In 2005, award 
winning horticulturist, Gwenythe B. Harvey, owner of the firm The Garden 
Goddess, LLC, was hired to redefine, design and upgrade existing garden 
areas. Coe Memorial Park's Botanical Gardens has since become a well-known 
tourist destination.[7] Torrington hopes to attract a wide variety of merchants 
into its downtown setting. Empty and abandoned buildings would be converted 
into a mix of retail, office, and residential space. A potential plan discusses 
the possibility of a national clothing retailer or bookstore chain constructing 
a location at the top of Water Street on the site of the Kelley Bus Company. 
This plan had come under fire by some because it involves the demolition 
of the former Torrington railroad station, which is considered by many 
to be historical. Despite this, the 113-year-old former Torrington railroad 
station was demolished, as a safety hazard, on January 4, 2011. The historical 
society was able to save a few pieces, including the ticket window and 
some of the terra-cotta ornaments from the outside of the building. A Big 
Y supermarket and a Lowe's Home Improvement store opened in the summer 
of 2009 on Winsted Road. A parking garage is slated to be constructed in 
the heart of downtown on either Main Street or Water Street. The municipal 
parking lot next to the Torrington Library would also serve as a downtown 
parking area. Because the downtown redevelopment project emphasizes pedestrian 
access, brick sidewalks lined with trees, benches, and bike racks would 
be constructed along Main Street.[8] To relieve congestion, the city plans 
to convert the Main Street/Water Street/East Main Street downtown intersection 
into a "+" shape, rather than its current criticized setup. The city expects 
to convert Main Street into a one-way road with parking lining one side 
of the street. The neighboring Prospect Street would also be converted 
into a one-way road with traffic flowing in the opposite direction. Most 
of the roads are in medium to poor condition and filled with pot holes.[9] 
Main Street Marketplace (MSMP) was created in 2009 by founders Steve Criss, 
Rose Ponte, Jessica Hodorski and the 2009 ACT Commissioners. The original 
idea for MSMP was to create an event to bring families together downtown 
to support the local merchants. Since 2009, MSMP brings in about 3,000 
visitors a night, has 40-45 exhibitors, 15-20 food vendors, non-profit 
exhibitors, and a variety of different types of performers every night.[10] 
It is an 8-week event that runs consecutively during the summer on Thursday 
nights from 5 to 9 o'clock. Main Street is shut down and the marketplace 
extends from Water Street to Alvord Street. The City of Torrington typically 
collects 100% of taxes owed through the use of private tax collectors. 
The 2004 General Fund budgetary fund balance was $5.8 million. The City 
has bonded debt outstanding of $36.8 million for governmental activities 
and $4.2 million for business type (WPCA). All current outstanding bonded 
debt will be retired by the year 2021 (current estimate). Torrington's 
bond rating is A1. In 2004, total revenue was $88,444,157: Property Taxes 
(64.40%), Board of Education Grants (23.44%), Federal & State Grants (7.06%), 
General Government (3.67%), Public Safety (0.64%), Public Works (0.53%), 
Invest Income (0.26%), and Recreation (0.01%). Total expenditures and encumbrances 
were $88,679,873: Board of Education (53.41%), Public Safety (12.97%), 
Pension & Miscellaneous (10.58%), Public Works (8.34%), Debt Services (7.69%), 
General Government (3.49%), Public Health & Social Services (1.99%), Operating 
Transfers Out (0.85%), Recreation (0.40%), Second Part Budget (0.29%). 
The number of violent crimes recorded by the FBI in 2003 was 139. The number 
of homicides was 0. The violent crime rate was 3.9 per 1,000 people. In 
1984-1985 Torrington's Police Department was sued by Tracey Thurman, who 
was nearly killed in 1983 by her estranged husband Charles "Buck" Thurman. 
In Thurman v. City of Torrington (finalized 1985), the federal court levied 
a $2.3 million judgment against the city for refusing to enforce its previous 
restraining orders because the perpetrator was married to the victim. Thurman's 
abuse, attempted murder and lawsuit were later depicted in a 1989 made-for-TV 
movie A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story, starring Nancy McKeon. 
In March 2013, Torrington received a degree of national notoriety for a 
statutory rape case involving three teen-aged boys accused of sexually 
assaulting two 13-year-old girls.[11] Joan Toribio and Edgar Gonzalez, 
both 18, were among the accused. Both were popular high school football 
players, who claimed that the encounters were consensul.[11] The third 
male, underage himself, was not named. Several dozen Torrington High School 
students rallied around the accused and allegedly aggressively bullied 
the victims online.[12] One of the victims was called a “hoe” on her Facebook 
page[13] and blamed for "ruining the lives" of the accused. Despite receiving 
national criticism, Torrington High School students continued to use social 
media to support the defendants, posting online photos while diminishing 
the validity and severity of the victim’s claims.[13] Three primary state 
highways meet in downtown Torrington: Route 8, Route 4, and Route 202. 
Other major roads include Route 183 and Route 272. The city is served by 
buses of the Northwestern Connecticut Transit District.[14] Baseball The 
Torrington Titans play in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League of New 
England. They played their inaugural season in the Atlantic Collegiate 
Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league. After leading the 
ACBL in attendance in 2010, the team was sold to the Carminucci Sports 
Group (CSG), which transferred their affiliation to the Futures League. 
CSG owns both the Brockton Rox of the professional Can-Am League, and fellow 
Futures League affiliate the Martha's Vineyard Sharks. The Titans play 
their home games at Fuessenich Park. In 2009, an organization called Our 
Baseball Haven, introduced a unique concept and proposal through which 
a collegiate baseball team could once again call Torrington its home. The 
concept, called "crowdsourcing" was supported by some five hundred individuals 
and the Peekskill (NY) Robins of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League 
(ACBL) were moved to Torrington and their name changed to the Torrington 
Titans. The Titans capped their successful 2010 inaugural season by winning 
the Kaiser Division. The Torrington Twisters were a member of the New England 
Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) from 1997-2008. Torrington twice played 
host to the league All-Star Game (1998, 2008) and generally placed high 
in their division each season. The organization shipped out in the middle 
of the night to Massachusetts in 2008 leaving bitter feelings by the community 
with both the NECBL and the ownership group. A professional baseball team 
once located in the city was known as the Torrington Braves, and were a 
member of the Colonial League. After just one season, 1950, they disbanded. 
Running The Torrington Road Race is a five-mile (8 km) run, which coincides 
with Donor's Week in August. Starting at Coe Memorial Park, the course 
extends to the farther reaches of the valley, including Riverside Avenue, 
Migeon Avenue, Prospect Street and others. The race, which started in 1972, 
primarily includes runners from around Connecticut and has also attracted 
some runners each year from Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
High School Sports In 2006, the Torrington High School Men's Basketball 
team captured their first Connecticut State Championship since 1944, beating 
rival high school Holy Cross of Waterbury. Anthony (Tony) Turina was the 
teams head coach. This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature 
differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes 
severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification 
system, Torrington has a humid continental climate, abbreviated "Dfb" on
