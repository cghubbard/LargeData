The 1922 New York Yankees season was the 20th season for the Yankees in 
New York and their 22nd overall. The team finished with a record of 94 
wins and 60 losses, to win their second pennant in franchise history, by 
a single game over the St. Louis Browns. New York was managed by Miller 
Huggins. Their home games were played at the Polo Grounds. In the 1922 
World Series, the Yankees again lost to their landlords, the New York Giants, 
4 games to none with one tied game. The final game of the Series was also 
the Yankees' final game as a tenant in the Polo Grounds. During the season, 
they had begun construction of their new home, Yankee Stadium, which would 
open in 1923. The Yankees started the season without their star, Babe Ruth, 
who was serving a suspension due to breaking the rule (along with several 
other Yankees) against World Series participants barnstorming. Although 
Commissioner Landis refused to back down on his enforcement of the rule, 
he did repeal the seemingly absurd rule by the end of the 1922 season.
