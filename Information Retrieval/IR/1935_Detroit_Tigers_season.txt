The 1935 Detroit Tigers won the 1935 World Series, defeating the Chicago 
Cubs 4 games to 2. The season was their 35th since they entered the American 
League in 1901. It was the first World Series championship for the Tigers. 
As the 1934 Detroit Tigers won a club-record 101 games, the team made few 
changes in the off-season to alter their winning combination. Hall of Famer 
Mickey Cochrane returned as the team's manager and catcher. Known as "Black 
Mike", Cochrane is considered one of the greatest catchers of all time. 
In 1935, he hit .319 (9th in the AL) with a .452 on-base percentage (3rd 
in the AL), 96 walks (4th in the AL), 93 runs scored, and 33 doubles. Aside 
from his contributions as a player, Cochrane was invaluable as a manager 
and leader. Charlie Gehringer later said: "When Mickey was managing the 
Tigers from behind the plate I can't remember him ever fouling up anything. 
Seemed like he made snap judgments that always worked out well, especially 
in '34 and '35."[1] The Detroit infield of the 1934–1935 seasons was one 
of the best-hitting combinations in MLB history. With Hank Greenberg at 
first, Charlie Gehringer at second, Billy Rogell at shortstop, and Marv 
Owen at third, the 1934 Tigers infield collected 462 RBIs (139 by Greenberg, 
127 by Gehringer, 100 by Rogell, and 96 by Owen) and 179 doubles (63 by 
Greenberg, 50 by Gehringer, 34 by Owen and 32 by Rogell). "Hammerin' Hank" 
Greenberg led the major leagues with 170 RBIs in 1935—the eighth highest 
single season total in major league history. The second highest RBI total 
in the AL that year was Lou Gehrig's 119—51 fewer than Hank. Greenberg 
also led the major leagues in 1935 with 36 home runs, 98 extra base hits, 
389 total bases, and 159 runs created. He also hit for average, with a 
.328 batting average (7th in the AL), .411 on-base percentage (6th in the 
AL), and .628 slugging percentage (2nd in the AL). Greenberg was named 
the American League's Most Valuable Player for 1935. Charlie Gehringer 
also had a terrific season, hitting .330 for the year (5th best in the 
AL). He was also among the league leaders with 123 runs (2nd in the AL), 
201 hits (5th in the AL), 125 runs created (5th in the AL), 306 total bases 
(6th in the AL), 19 home runs (8th in the AL), and 108 RBIs (9th in the 
AL). Gehringer also led AL second basemen with 489 assists and a .985 fielding 
percentage. Gehringer finished 6th in the AL MVP voting in 1935. Known 
for his consistency as a hitter and fielder, Gehringer was given the nickname 
"The Mechanical Man" by Yankee pitcher Lefty Gomez.[2] Mickey Cochrane 
joked that "Charlie says `hello' on Opening Day, `goodbye' on closing day, 
and in between hits .350."[3] Shortstop Billy Rogell hit .275 and scored 
88 runs in 1935 while drawing 80 walks. Rogell also led AL shortstops with 
104 double plays and a .971 fielding percentage. Rogell and Gehringer played 
over 1,000 games together as the Tigers' double play combination. Rogell's 
fiery demeanor was a stark contrast to the calm, quiet demeanor of Gehringer. 
Once, after both failed to cover second on a steal attempt, Mickey Cochrane 
charged out from behind the plate shouting at Rogell and Gehringer. As 
reported in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract: "Rogell, astonished, 
looked at Gehringer to see if he was going to say anything. Gehringer, 
of course, had nothing to say. 'Goddamn you,' yelled Rogell. 'Don’t you 
come charging out here telling me how to play shortstop. You go back there 
and do the catching, and I’ll play shortstop. If I’m not good enough, you 
can find someone else.' Cochrane went back to his own position." Marv Owen 
was the one Tiger starter whose performance dropped off significantly from 
1934 to 1935. In 1934, Owen had batted .317 with 96 RBIs and finished 9th 
in the AL MVP voting. In 1935, his average dropped 54 points to .263, and 
his RBI production fell to 71. Owen is remembered for a famous incident 
in Game 7 of the 1934 World Series. Joe Medwick tripled in the 6th inning 
with the Cardinals ahead by 7 runs. He slid hard into Owen at third, knocking 
him down. The two fought, and Detroit fans pelted Medwick with fruit and 
garbage when he returned to left field. As the fan reaction escalated, 
Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered Medwick removed from the game. 
Owen batted just .069 (2–29) in the 1934 World Series and .050 (1–20) in 
the 1935 World Series. He set a post-season record for the most consecutive 
plate appearances between hits with 31. Rounding out the infield was utility 
infielder Flea Clifton. Clifton played in 43 games during the 1935 regular 
season, with a .255 batting average. However, when Hank Greenberg broke 
his wrist in Game 2 of the 1935 World Series, Marv Owen moved to first 
base, and Clifton stepped in as the starting third baseman. Clifton was 
0-for-16 with 4 strikeouts in the Series. Clifton had been teammates with 
Hank Greenberg in the minor leagues, and the two became friends. In his 
autobiography, Greenberg joked about Clifton's unusual diet: "On the road, 
he used to eat nothing but doughnuts and bananas. He said they were cheap 
and filling and stretched his meal money. Flea was the only ballplayer 
who could show a profit on $1-a-day meal money."[4] In the outfield, Hall 
of Famer Goose Goslin played in left field. Pete Fox played in right field. 
The speedy Jo-Jo White and Gee Walker shared responsibility for center 
field, with White playing in 98 games. Pete Fox led the way among the outfielders, 
batting .321 with 116 runs scored, 38 doubles, and 15 home runs. Fox also 
had a 29-game hitting streak in June and July. During the hitting streak, 
Fox drove in 10 runs in a double-header against the St. Louis Browns.[5] 
During the six-game 1935 World Series, Fox also led the team in hits (10), 
RBIs (4), and batting average (.385). Goose Goslin had a good year with 
109 RBIs, 172 hits, and 34 doubles. After leading the Washington Senators 
to American League pennants in 1924, 1925, and 1933, owner Clark Griffith 
traded Goslin to Detroit before the 1934 season. Griffith told Goose he 
simply couldn't afford to pay his salary. With stars Goslin, Gehringer 
and Greenberg, the 1934 and 1934 Tigers became known as the "G-Men." Goslin 
was the hero of the 1935 World Series, as he drove in the winning run in 
Games 6. With the game tied 3–3, Goslin came to bat in the bottom of the 
9th inning with two outs and Mickey Cochrane on 2nd base. Goslin hit a 
walk-off single to right, scoring Cochrane, as the Tigers won the Series. 
Center fielder Jo-Jo White led the team with 19 stolen bases and also contributed 
12 triples. White's real first name was Joyner, but he was called "Jo-Jo" 
because of the way he pronounced his native state of Georgia. Hank Greenberg, 
who was raised in the Bronx was rommates with White, and according to Greenberg 
the two of them "used to fight the Civil War every night." Greenberg recalled 
a game in which White stole home with Greenberg at bat: "He deprived me 
of a good chance at an RBI, and he did it deliberately because he knew 
it would burn me up."[6] The Tigers fourth outfielder, Gee Walker played 
45 games in center field but also covered 29 games in left and 11 games 
in right. Known as "The Madman from Mississippi", Walker was a fiery competitor 
and a clown. He hit over .300 for the 1935 Tigers, but his reputation for 
being inattentive and overzealous on the basepaths drew the ire of manager 
Mickey Cochrane. During the 1934 World Series, he was picked off first 
while arguing with the Cardinals' bench. On another occasion, he tried 
to steal a base while the batter was being given an intentional walk. The 
pitching staff was led by starters Tommy Bridges, Schoolboy Rowe, Alvin 
Crowder, and Elden Auker. Tommy Bridges was the only 20-game winner with 
a record of 21–10. In 34 starts, Bridges threw 23 complete games. He led 
the American League with 163 strikeouts, and his 3.51 ERA was 6th best 
in the league. He finished the season 11th in the American League MVP voting. 
In a nationwide poll, Bridges was named the No. 2 sports hero of 1935, 
behind Notre Dame football player Andy Pilney.[7] Elden Auker, a 24-year-old 
underhand pitcher out of Kansas A&M, also had a big year for the 1935 Tigers. 
Auker led the American League in win percentage (.720) with a record of 
18–7. During the 1935 World Series, Auker was interviewed by a young Cubs 
broadcaster, Ronald Reagan. When they met after Reagan had been elected 
Governor of California, Reagan told him, "You probably won't remember me, 
but I'll remember you as long as I live." The 1935 radio interview, Reagan 
said, "was my first big break."[8] After making a big splash in 1934 with 
an American League record 16 consecutive wins, Schoolboy Rowe had another 
big year in 1935. Schoolboy had become a fan favorite not only for his 
pitching performance in 1934 but for his nationally publicized romance. 
While appearing on the Eddie Cantor radio show, Rowe famously asked his 
fiancee, "How'm I doing, Edna honey?" The line endeared Schoolboy to the 
nation, and also resulted in relentless teasing from opposing players and 
fans. Schoolboy and Edna married after the 1934 season and had their first 
child during the 1935 season. Schoolboy led the league in 1935 with six 
shutouts and finished the season with a 19–13 record in 34 starts. Despite 
a 2.51 ERA in the 1935 World Series, Rowe had a 1–2 record. He was the 
losing pitcher in Game 1, despite striking out 8 batters, pitching a complete 
game and allowing only 2 earned runs. In Game 3, Rowe got the win, pitching 
4 innings in relief. But Game 5 was another tough loss, as Schoolboy threw 
a complete game and allowed 2 earned runs, but the Tigers scored only once. 
The Tigers' #4 starter was 36-year-old Alvin Crowder, who served in the 
U.S. Army during its occupation of Siberia after World War I.[9] Crowder, 
known as "General", was 16–10 in his 32 starts. The General pitched a complete 
game in Game 4 of the 1935 World Series for a 2–1 victory. Crowder pitched 
in three World Series consecutively (1933–1935), posting a record of 1–2 
with 3.81 ERA in 26 innings pitched. The Tigers' main reliever in 1935 
was Chief Hogsett, who appeared in 40 games, finishing 30, with an ERA 
of 3.54. When Hogsett would take the mound at Navin Field, Detroit fans 
greeted him with "war whoops." Hogsett later reported that, while he was 
"one-thirty-second Cherokee on my mother's side", he got the nickname in 
the minor leagues when he "roomed with a full-blooded Kiowa Indian and 
the nickname just kind of stuck."[10] Detroit's final regular season record 
was 93–58, placing them three games ahead of the second place New York 
Yankees. For the season, the 1935 Tigers outscored their opponents 919 
to 665. After losing the 1934 World Series in a close seven-game series 
with the Gashouse Gang from St. Louis, the Detroit Tigers were determined 
to win the first baseball championship for the City of Detroit since the 
Detroit Wolverines won the National League pennant in 1887. The season 
started out poorly. Schoolboy Rowe lost on Opening Day, and the Tigers 
were 2–9 after two weeks of play. At the end of April, the Tigers were 
in last place. By the end of May, the Tigers had started to turn things 
around but still had a mediocre 20–18 record. On June 25, 1935, the Yankees 
were in first place, and the Tigers were still playing unexceptionally 
with a record of 33–28. However, the Tigers got red hot after that, going 
35–10 between June 26 and August 15, 1935. During that period, they put 
together win streaks of 10 games (June 30 to July 7) and 9 games (July 
31 to August 11). On July 26, 1935, the Tigers passed the Yankees and moved 
into first place. The team remained hot through Labor Day, having a record 
of 85–44 on September 7, 1935. But the Tigers' bats went cold for the last 
three weeks of the season, as the team went 8–14 to end the season. Despite 
having a ten-game lead over the Yankees on September 8, 1935, the Tigers 
let the Yankees back into the race, eventually winning by three games. 
On September 21, 1935, the Tigers clinched the American League pennant 
by winning both games of a double-header against the St. Louis Browns. 
Tommy Bridges won the opener, 6–2, and Elden Auker pitched a complete game 
shutout to win the second game, 2–0. After clinching the pennant, the Tigers 
finished the season by losing 6 of their last 7 games. [8] [9] [10] [11]

featured the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago Cubs, with the Tigers winning 
in six games for their first championship in five World Series appearances. 
They had lost in 1907, 1908, 1909, and 1934. The Cubs had the better regular 
season record and had a 21-game win streak during the pennant stretch. 
The Tigers, on the other hand, went 8–14 in their last 22 games. Based 
on momentum, it appeared the Cubs would roll past the Tigers. The Cubs 
won Game 1, 3–0, on 4-hit shutout by pitcher Lon Warneke. Schoolboy Rowe 
took the loss. The Tigers evened the Series in Game 2, with an 8–3 win, 
but the Tigers lost Hank Greenberg who fractured his left wrist when colliding 
with Cubs catcher Gabby Hartnett. Greenberg had tried to score from first 
on a single. He finished the game, but he developed severe pain on the 
train ride to Chicago that night, and x-rays revealed fractures of two 
bones in his wrist. Greenberg was sidelined for the rest of the Series, 
and Mickey Cochrane was left to decide who could replace Greenberg. Initially, 
Cochrane decided to play first base himself and have backup catcher Ray 
Hayworth take over at catcher. But Tigers owner Frank Navin ordered Cochrane 
to move third baseman Marv Owen to first base and play utility infielder 
Flea Clifton at third base. Cochrane disagreed, as Clifton was the weakest 
hitter on the team, and Owen was in a slump. Navin insisted, and Owen went 
one for twenty in the Series, while Flea went 0-for-16 in the Series. In 
Game 3, the Cubs tied the game in the bottom of the 9th, but the Tigers 
won it with an unearned run in the 11th inning. In the 3rd inning, umpire 
George Moriarty (who had played for the Tigers from 1909 to 1915) called 
Phil Cavarretta out in a close play at second base. When the Cubs protested, 
Moriarty verbally abused the Cubs, and ejected Cubs' manager Charlie Grimm 
and player Bill Jurges. After the game, Grimm said: "If a manager can't 
go out and make a decent kick, what the hell is the game coming to? I didn't 
swear at him but he swore at us."[11] Coach Roy Johnson accused Moriarty 
of making improper reflections on the Cubs' ancestry. Judge Landis later 
levied $200 fines on Moriarty‚ Grimm‚ and Jurges for their conduct in the 
World Series. In Game 4, Alvin Crowder pitched a 2–1 complete game victory. 
The Tigers won on an unearned run in the 6th inning. In Game 5, Cubs' pitcher 
Lon Warneke kept the Cubs alive with 6 innings of shutout ball for his 
2nd win. The Cubs won 3–1 on a 2-run home run by Chuck Klein off losing 
pitcher Schoolboy Rowe. In Game 6, Tommy Bridges pitched a complete game 
victory to win the Series for Detroit. With the score tied 3–3 in the top 
of the 9th inning, Bridges gave up a leadoff triple to Stan Hack, but retired 
the next three batters without the runner on third scoring. In the bottom 
of the 9th, Goose Goslin drove in the winning run with 2 outs. After the 
game, manager Mickey Cochrane said the following of Bridges' gutsy performance: 
"A hundred and fifty pounds of courage. If there ever is a payoff on courage 
this little 150- pound pitcher is the greatest World Series hero."[7] Delirious 
Detroit fans rushed onto Navin Field in celebration after Goslin's game-winning 
hit. The celebration spilled out onto Michigan Avenue and Trumbull. People 
from throughout Detroit flooded the central city in a celebration that 
newspapers reported went on until three in the morning. For a few hours, 
the worries of the Great Depression were gone and the only thing that mattered 
was the Tigers. Detroit owner Frank Navin, then 64 years old, had been 
running the organization for 30 years and had seen four of his teams win 
American League pennants, only to lose four World Series. On November 13, 
1935, five weeks after the Tigers finally won the World Series, Navin suffered 
a heart attack while riding a horse and died.[12] When the Tigers won the 
1935 World Series, the City of Detroit was mired in the Great Depression, 
which had hit Detroit and its industries particularly hard. But with the 
success of the Tigers and other Detroit athletes in 1935, Detroit's luck 
appeared to be changing, as the City was dubbed the "City of Champions."[13] 
Detroit's "champions" included Detroit's "Brown Bomber", Joe Louis, the 
heavyweight boxing champion; native Detroiter Gar Wood who was the champion 
of unlimited powerboat racing and the first man to go 100 miles per hour 
on water; Eddie "the Midnight Express" Tolan, a black Detroiter who won 
gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter races at the 1932 Summer Olympics. 
The Detroit Lions also won the 1935 NFL Championship Game, and the Detroit 
Red Wings won the 1935–36 Stanley Cup championship, but the biggest celebration 
came when the Tigers won the World Series, as the "City of Champions" moniker 
took hold. Baseball was hugely popular in Detroit during the Great Depression, 
as attendance at Navin Field in 1934 and 1935, accounted for nearly 25 
percent of baseball's total paid attendance. Note: G = Games played; AB
