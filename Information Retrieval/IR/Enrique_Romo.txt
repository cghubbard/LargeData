Enrique Romo Navarro (born July 15, 1947 in Santa Rosalía, Baja California 
Sur, Mexico) is a former relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played 
for the Seattle Mariners (1977–78) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1979–82). Romo 
batted and threw right-handed. He is the younger brother of Vicente Romo, 
who also pitched in the majors. In a six -season career, Romo posted a

his rookie season, he led the Mariners with 16 saves. He was traded to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1978 season in a multi-player deal which 
brought, among others, the infamous Mario Mendoza to the Mariners. His 
most productive season came in 1979 for World Champion Pittsburgh, when 
he had a 10–5 mark with a 2.99 ERA including career-highs in games (84)
