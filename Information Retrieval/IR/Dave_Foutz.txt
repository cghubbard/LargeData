As player As manager David Luther Foutz (September 7, 1856 – March 5, 1897) 
was a Major League Baseball player for 13 seasons. He played multiple positions, 
including pitcher, from 1884 to 1896, compiling a 147–66 career record, 
as well as first base and outfield. From 1893 to 1896, he was the player-manager 
of the Brooklyn Bridegrooms. David Luther Foutz was born in Carroll County, 
Maryland on September 7, 1856, the son of Solomon Augustus Foutz and Miriam 
Cook.[1] Always known as Dave, he was asthmatic all his life. When he was 
21 Foutz drifted out to Leadville, Colorado and worked for a while in the 
lead mines. While in Leadville, Foutz started playing baseball, pitching 
for the Leadville Blues, an amateur team. Shortly after, he signed with 
the Bay City, Michigan minor league team, where he played until 1884.[2][3] 
By 1884, Foutz's talent had been spotted by Chris von der Ahe, the owner 
of the American Association St. Louis Browns. He wanted Foutz's contract 
so badly he bought the entire Bay City, Michigan franchise.[4] Before joining 
the major league, Foutz acquired a reputation as a gambler and drinker, 
figuring if he was going to die young, he would enjoy himself before.[5] 
As a player, Dave Foutz was often called "Scissors" and other nicknames, 
due to his tall (6 foot 2 inch) and thin (161 pounds) build.[2] His first 
six seasons in the major leagues were spent in the American Association 
with the St. Louis Browns, all the while suffering from asthma. With the 
Browns he became their powerhouse right hander who pitched St. Louis to 
four straight American Association pennants. Along the way, Foutz built 
up an impressive record and on April 10, 1885, in an exhibition game, Foutz 
pitched a no-hitter to defeat the St. Louis Maroons, 7-0. Later on June 
3, 1886, Foutz pitched a shutout against Brooklyn in what became a 19-0 
rout.[4] But on August 14, 1887 while pitching against the Cincinnati Reds 
for St. Louis, Foutz was hit by a ball and suffered a broken thumb on his 
throwing hand.[4][6] Sidelined for nine weeks, when Foutz eventually returned 
to pitching‚ he was ineffective and his pitching career was virtually ended. 
While he was pitching, Foutz won 114 games over a four-year span from 1884–1887, 
with a career high of 41 in 1886. He ended up with a 147-66 record, which 
is a .690 percentage and is tied for third-best ever. Leading up to the 
1888 season, Foutz made the news, when Chris von der Ahe, owner of the 
St. Louis Browns, sold the contracts for the not fully recovered Foutz, 
along with pitcher "Parisian Bob" Caruthers, and catcher Doc Bushong. The 
sale was to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and their owner, Charlie Byrne who 
paid, what was then, the enormous sum of $19,000 for the trio.[7][8] After 
the injury, Foutz pitched little for Brooklyn but helped the team to the 
1889 American Association pennant and the 1890 National League flag. In 
both seasons, he was the regular first baseman. Later for four seasons 
(1893–96), Foutz was a playing manager, but Brooklyn never finished higher 
than fifth and Foutz was forced to resign in October 1896 after the end 
of the 1896 season.[9][10] Foutz is still remembered for one great play, 
that probably occurred in the game on September 3, 1886, where he picked 
off a runner unassisted. He was playing for the St. Louis Browns, who were 
facing the Louisville Colonels.[11][12] Apparently orchestrated by a signal 
from Albert Doc Bushong, catcher, with Charles Comiskey playing first base. 
On base, the runners for the Louisville Colonels were Pete Browning on 
first and John Kerins on second. "(During) Sunday's game between St. Louis 
(and) Louisville, and in the presence of 6,000 persons, Foutz played the 
sharpest trick ever seen on the ball field. Browning was on first base 
and Kerins on second, with no one out. Pete played far off from the base, 
while Comiskey took a stand back into right field. Pete had his back turned 
toward second base, and was keeping an eye on the movements of Comiskey, 
while he eagerly pranced back and forth to show the crowd that he was not 
afraid to steal off a bag. Foutz pretended not to watch Browning, but suddenly 
Bushong signaled, and Foutz dashed over toward first base with the ball 
in hand, touching Browning before the latter knew what had happened. Such 
a play was never before seen, and the spectators howled with delight. Pete 
was mighty mad, and, as he has a faculty for being caught napping, the 
play was doubly embarrassing." The Sporting News, September 13, 1886 In 
1889, Foutz married 28-year-old Minnie M Glocke and they lived in Brooklyn. 
Afterwards, he and his wife were constant companions and Foutz appeared 
to settle down from his younger days.[5] But six years later, in 1895 Foutz's 
wife was institutionalized in an insane asylum and likely remained there 
until she died in 1898.[13][14] Never in good health, in January 1896, 
Foutz became dangerously ill with pneumonia and barely recovered.[15] After 
he was released from the Bride Grooms, in October 1896, Foutz was considered 
for a manager in the minor leagues or as a possible umpire, but by January 
1897, he was too ill to work and was under a doctor's care.[16][17] On 
March 5, 1897, David Luther Foutz died at his mother's home in Waverly, 
a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, of an asthma attack. He was buried in 
the Loudon Park Cemetery, in Baltimore City, Maryland.[14] News papers 
reported his funeral was a sad and somber affair, attended by many former 
teammates and baseball players. Also in attendance were executives from 
the National League as well as his old Brooklyn and St. Louis ball clubs.[18]
