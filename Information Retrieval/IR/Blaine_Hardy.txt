Blaine Patrick Hardy (born March 14, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Hardy attended Edmonds-Woodway High School in Edmonds, Washington, graduating 
in 2005.[1] He then enrolled at Lewis–Clark State College, where he played 
for the school's college baseball team. Lewis–Clark won the National Association 
of Intercollegiate Athletics World Series championship in 2008.[2] The 
Kansas City Royals selected Hardy in the 22nd round of the 2008 MLB Draft. 
The Royals released Hardy during spring training in 2013.[3] Hardy signed 
with the Detroit Tigers in April 2013, and they assigned him to the Erie 
SeaWolves of the Class AA Eastern League. Hardy finished with a 2–2 record 
and a 1.63 earned run average (ERA) as a reliever before he was promoted 
to the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League. He was pressed 
into duty as a starting pitcher due to a pitching shortage, but performed 
well.[3] He finished the season with an 8–3 record and a 1.67 ERA between 
Double-A Erie and Triple-A Toledo.[4] Hardy was a non-roster invitee to 
spring training, and impressed as he competed for a role as the team's 
long reliever.[4][5] The Tigers reassigned him to minor league camp towards 
the end of spring training.[6] On June 15, 2014, the Detroit Tigers purchased 
Hardy's contract from Triple-A Toledo, and he was added to the 25-man roster.[7] 
Hardy made his major league debut for the Detroit Tigers the next day in 
a game against the Kansas City Royals, pitching two scoreless innings, 
allowing one hit, walking two and striking out two.[8] He performed well 
in his first major league season, posting a 2.54 ERA in 39 innings pitched. 
On August 23, 2015, Hardy's homerless streak of 84 2⁄3 innings ended after 
allowing a home run to Mike Napoli. This was the longest active homerless 
innings streak in the major leagues. The last time Hardy had allowed a 
home run was to Jason Castro on June 27, 2014. Hardy holds the franchise 
record for the most appearances by a left-hander without allowing a home 
run, at 87, and was two appearances away from tying Bernie Boland's record 
for 89 homerless appearances.[9] He would finish the season with a 3.08 
ERA, while striking out 55 batters in 61 1⁄3 innings. He appeared in a 
team-high 70 games in 2015. On May 12, 2016, Hardy was optioned to the 
Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens.[10] Blaine throws a fastball in the 88–91 MPH 
range that he will occasionally cut for late movement. His most effective 
pitch is an upper-70s curveball, which has yielded most of his strikeouts
