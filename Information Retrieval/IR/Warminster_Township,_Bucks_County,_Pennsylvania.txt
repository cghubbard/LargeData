its borders were formally established in 1711. It was originally part of 
Southampton Township, which was founded in 1682 by William Penn.[2] Warminster 
was named after a small town in the county of Wiltshire, at the western 
extremity of Salisbury Plain, England.[3] Warminster, Pennsylvania was 
mostly settled by English and Scotch-Irish after William Penn received 
a grant of land in the area from King Charles, II.[2] Warminster began 
as a small farming community and remained that way throughout most of its 
history. As recently as 1955, the township had no residential subdivisions 
and only one housing complex, Lacey Park on Street Road, the site where 
the Battle of Crooked Billet occurred during the Revolutionary War that 
resulted in a resounding defeat for George Washington's troops.[2] Warminster's 
Craven Hall is included in the National Register of Historic Places listings 
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Warminster's most significant historical 
figure was William Tennent, an outspoken religious leader and educator.[2] 
Warminster's Naval Air Warfare Center, previously called the Johnsville 
Naval Air Development Center and then the Naval Air Development Center, 
operated from World War II until it closed in 1996. Its site was acquired 
by the U.S. Navy from the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation in 1943. The 
Center initially served as a weapons development and airplane testing facility. 
It then became a training center for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space 
programs. The facility developed a prototype "black box," best known as 
the indestructible recorder of cockpit conversations and information in 
the event of a crash.[4][5] Warminster Township is 3.7 miles northwest
