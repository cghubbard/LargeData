Kenneth Lauren "Ken" Burns[1] (born July 29, 1953)[1] is an American filmmaker, 
known for his style of using archival footage and photographs in documentary 
films. His most widely known documentaries are The Civil War (1990), Baseball 
(1994), Jazz (2001), The War (2007), The National Parks: America's Best 
Idea (2009), Prohibition (2011), The Central Park Five (2012), and The 
Roosevelts (2014). He was also executive producer of both The West (1996, 
directed by Stephen Ives), and Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies (2015, 
directed by Barak Goodman).[2] Burns' documentaries have been nominated 
for two Academy Awards and have won Emmy Awards, among other honors. Burns 
was born on July 29, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lyla Smith 
(née Tupper) Burns,[3] a biotechnician,[4] and Robert Kyle Burns, at the 
time a graduate student in cultural anthropology at Columbia University 
in Manhattan.[3] The documentary filmmaker Ric Burns is his younger brother.[5][6] 
He is a distant relative of Scottish poet Robert Burns.[7][8] Burns's academic 
family moved frequently. Among places they called home were Saint-Véran, 
France; Newark, Delaware; and Ann Arbor, where his father taught at the 
University of Michigan.[4] Burns's mother was found to have breast cancer 
when Burns was 3 and died when he was 11,[4] a circumstance that he said 
helped shape his career; he credited his father-in-law, a psychologist, 
with a signal insight: "He told me that my whole work was an attempt to 
make people long gone come back alive."[4] Well-read as a child, he absorbed 
the family encyclopedia, preferring history to fiction. Upon receiving 
an 8 mm film movie camera for his 17th birthday, he shot a documentary 
about an Ann Arbor factory. He graduated from Pioneer High School in Ann 
Arbor in 1971.[9] Turning down reduced tuition at the University of Michigan, 
he attended Hampshire College, an alternative school in Amherst, Massachusetts, 
where students are graded through narrative evaluations rather than letter 
grades and where students create self-directed academic concentrations 
instead of choosing a traditional major.[4] He worked in a record store 
to pay his tuition.[4] Studying under photographers Jerome Liebling and 
Elaine Mayes and others, Burns earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in film 
studies and design[10] in 1975. Upon graduation, he, Mayes and college 
classmate Roger Sherman founded Florentine Films in Walpole, New Hampshire. 
The company's name was borrowed from Mayes' hometown of Florence, Massachusetts. 
Another Hampshire College graduate Buddy Squires subsequently succeeded 
Mayes one year later in 1976.[11] Burns worked as a cinematographer for 
the BBC, Italian television, and others, and in 1977, having completed 
some documentary short films, he began work on adapting David McCullough's 
book The Great Bridge, about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.[10] 
Developing a signature style of documentary filmmaking in which he "adopted 
the technique of cutting rapidly from one still picture to another in a 
fluid, linear fashion [and] then pepped up the visuals with 'first hand' 
narration gleaned from contemporary writings and recited by top stage and 
screen actors",[12] he made the feature documentary Brooklyn Bridge (1981), 
which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary and ran on 
PBS in the United States. Following another documentary, The Shakers: Hands 
to Work, Hearts to God (1984), Burns was Oscar-nominated again for The 
Statue of Liberty (1985). Burns went on to a long, successful career directing 
and producing well-received television documentaries and documentary miniseries 
on subjects as diverse as arts and letters (Thomas Hart Benton, 1988), 
mass media (Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio, 1991), sports (Baseball, 
1994, updated with 10th Inning, 2010), politicians (Thomas Jefferson, 1997), 
music (Jazz, 2001), literature (Mark Twain, 2001), war (the 15-hour World 
War II documentary The War, 2007), environmentalism (The National Parks, 
2009) and the Civil War (the 11-hour The Civil War, 1990, which All Media 
Guide says "many consider his 'chef d'oeuvre'").[12] In 1982, Burns married 
Amy Stechler, with whom he had two daughters, Sarah and Lily;[10] the marriage 
ended in divorce. As of 2011, Burns resides in Walpole, New Hampshire, 
with his second wife, Julie Deborah Brown,[13] whom he married on October 
18, 2003.[13] They have two daughters, Olivia and Willa Burns. In 2014 
Burns appeared in Henry Louis Gates's Finding Your Roots where he discovered 
startling news that he is a descendant of a slave owner from the Deep South, 
in addition to having lineage tracing back to Colonial Americans of Loyalist 
allegiance during the American Revolution. [14] Burns is a longtime supporter 
of the Democratic Party, with almost $40,000 in political donations.[15] 
In 2008, the Democratic National Committee chose Burns to produce the introductory 
video for Senator Edward Kennedy's August 2008 speech to the Democratic 
National Convention, a video described by Politico as a "Burns-crafted 
tribute casting him [Kennedy] as the modern Ulysses bringing his party 
home to port."[16][17] In August 2009, Kennedy died, and Burns produced 
a short eulogy video at his funeral. In endorsing Barack Obama for the 
U.S. presidency in December 2007, Burns compared Obama to Abraham Lincoln.[18] 
He said he had planned to be a regular contributor to Countdown with Keith 
Olbermann on Current TV.[19] Burns is the recipient of more than 20 honorary 
degrees.[citation needed] The Civil War has received more than 40 major 
film and television awards,[citation needed] including two Emmy Awards, 
two Grammy Awards, the Producer of the Year Award from the Producers Guild 
of America, a People's Choice Award, a Peabody Award, a duPont-Columbia 
Award, a D. W. Griffith Award, and the $50,000 Lincoln Prize. As of 2010, 
there is a Ken Burns Wing at the Jerome Liebling Center for Film, Photography 
and Video at Hampshire College.[20] In 2004, Burns received the S. Roger 
Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award 
given out annually by Jefferson Awards.[21] In 2012, Burns received the 
Washington University International Humanities Medal.[22] The medal, awarded 
biennially and accompanied by a cash prize of $25,000, is given to honor 
a person whose humanistic endeavors in scholarship, journalism, literature, 
or the arts have made a difference in the world. Past winners include Turkish 
novelist Orhan Pamuk in 2006, journalist Michael Pollan in 2008, and novelist 
and nonfiction writer Francine Prose in 2010.[23] In 2013, Burns received 
the John Steinbeck Award, an award presented annually by Steinbeck's eldest 
son, Thomas, in collaboration with the John Steinbeck Family Foundation, 
San Jose State University, and The National Steinbeck Center.[24] Burns 
was the Grand Marshal for the 2016 Pasadena Tournament of Roses' Rose Parade 
on New Year's Day in Pasadena, California.[25] The National Endowment for 
the Humanities selected Burns to deliver the 2016 Jefferson Lecture, the 
U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities, 
on the topic of race in America.[26] In 2016 he also gave a commencement 
speech for Stanford University criticizing Donald Trump.[27] Burns frequently 
incorporates simple musical leitmotifs or melodies. For example, The Civil 
War features a distinctive violin melody throughout, "Ashokan Farewell", 
which was performed for the film by its composer, fiddler Jay Ungar. One 
critic noted, "One of the most memorable things about The Civil War was 
its haunting, repeated violin melody, whose thin, yearning notes seemed 
somehow to sum up all the pathos of that great struggle."[28] Burns often 
gives life to still photographs by slowly zooming in on subjects of interest 
and panning from one subject to another. For example, in a photograph of 
a baseball team, he might slowly pan across the faces of the players and 
come to rest on the player who is the subject of the narrator. This technique, 
possible in many professional and home software applications, is termed 
"The Ken Burns effect" in Apple's iPhoto, iMovie and Final Cut Pro X software 
applications. Burns stated in a 2009 interview that he initially declined 
to have his name associated with the software because of his stance to 
refuse commercial endorsements. However, Apple chief Steve Jobs negotiated 
to give Burns Apple equipment, which Burns donated to nonprofit organizations.[29] 
As a museum retrospective noted, "His PBS specials [are] strikingly out 
of step with the visual pyrotechnics and frenetic pacing of most reality-based 
TV programming, relying instead on techniques that are literally decades 
old, although Burns reintegrates these constituent elements into a wholly 
new and highly complex textual arrangement."[10] In a 2011 interview, Burns 
stated that he admires and is influenced by filmmaker Errol Morris.[30]
