Troy Eugene Percival (born August 9, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher and current head coach at UC Riverside. He gained fame as a closer. 
During a 14-year baseball career, he pitched from 1995–2009 for four different 
teams, pitching primarily with the California/Anaheim Angels. He was also 
an integral part of that franchise's 2002 World Series championship team. 
Percival currently ranks 10th in career saves. He started playing baseball 
at Moreno Valley Youth Federation (MVYF) and was coached by Bill Yearsley 
in his early years. Percival played on the Moreno Valley High School baseball 
team, before attending the University of California, Riverside, where he 
played college baseball for the Highlanders from 1987–1990.[1] He was then 
drafted by the California Angels in the 6th round of the 1990 amateur draft 
as a catcher. He batted .203 in his only season as a catcher with the Boise 
Hawks and was converted to a pitcher when coaches noticed that his return 
throws to the mound were actually faster than the pitches he caught. He 
made his Major League debut as a reliever in 1995, and was mostly used 
as a setup man for Lee Smith. He was coached by his father Richard Percival 
for all of his childhood years. In 1996, he became the regular closer for 
the Angels and had 36 saves with 100 strikeouts in 74 innings. He is one 
of only six pitchers in the Angels' 44-year history to strike out at least 
100 batters in a season without starting a game. The others are Mark Clear 
(105, 1980), DeWayne Buice (109, 1987), Bryan Harvey (101, 1991) Scot Shields 
(109, 2004) and Francisco Rodríguez (123, 2004). He had a career-high 42 
saves in 1998, and enjoyed his best season in 2002 with a 4-1 record, 40 
saves, 68 strikeouts, and a 1.92 ERA. That year en route to winning the 
World Series he was 7 for 7 in save opportunities, tying John Wetteland 
for most saves in one postseason (since tied by Brad Lidge, Koji Uehara 
and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 but blew one on the 8th opportunity). 
A four-time All-Star, Percival compiled a 29-38 record with a 2.99 ERA 
in 586.2 innings for the Angels. His 355 saves put him at 8th on the all-time 
list in Major League Baseball. However, his strikeouts per nine innings 
have gone down considerably from when he was an elite closer. In 2001, 
his K/9 rate was 11.08. In 2002, 10.86. In 2003, 8.76. And in 2004, it 
dropped all the way to 5.98. His fastball, once clocked consistently at 
96 -100 MPH, was down to about 92 - 93 MPH in 2004, due to a degenerative 
hip condition that first appeared in 2003, which forced him to alter his 
pitching delivery. Percival's contract with the Angels expired in 2004 
and he became a free agent at the end of that season. Rather than bring 
Percival back, the Angels decided to turn to young phenom Francisco Rodríguez 
to close, motivated largely by Rodriguez's much lower price tag and concerns 
about Percival's age and health. The Angels offered to negotiate a reduced 
role (at a correspondingly reduced salary) for Percival to return as a 
setup man, but Percival decided to seek opportunities elsewhere that would 
allow him to remain a closer. Percival signed with the Detroit Tigers as 
a free agent for the 2005 season. However, after a mediocre start to his 
career at Comerica Park, during which he converted 8 saves from 11 opportunities 
and posted an ERA of 5.76, Percival suffered a serious injury to his right 
forearm in early July. The severity of the injury ended his season, as 
well put the rest of his career in doubt. After attempting to recuperate, 
Percival reported to spring training for the Tigers in 2006. However, on 
his first outing he again suffered significant pain and left the team. 
After spending the entire 2006 season on the Tigers' disabled list and 
working for the team as an advance scout, Percival's contract with the 
Tigers expired at the end of the 2006 season. Though he didn't pitch a 
game during the Tigers' run to the American League Championship, the team 
voted Percival a ring and a full playoff share. Appreciative of this gesture, 
he used the money to buy a suite at Comerica Park for his teammate's wives. 
In November and December 2006, during his time off from baseball, Percival 
funded and himself built a new clubhouse at the Riverside Sports Complex, 
the home venue of his college baseball program, UC Riverside.[2] On January 
19, 2007, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim hired Percival as a special 
assignment pitching instructor. However, believing his arm to have finally 
healed, he requested his release from his minor league coaching contract 
to pursue a comeback. Percival signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals 
and joined the big league team on June 26, 2007.[3][4][5] Percival was 
the fourth member of the 2002 championship Angels team to play for the 
2007 Cardinals, joining David Eckstein, Scott Spiezio, and Adam Kennedy, 
as well as former Angels teammate Jim Edmonds. Percival made his first 
appearance in the Majors since 2005 on June 29, 2007, against the Cincinnati 
Reds. He struck out the first batter he faced, David Ross, and was also 
credited with the win. On November 29, 2007, he signed a two-year, $8 million 
contract with the Tampa Bay Rays. The contract contains up to $4 million 
in performance-based incentives.[6] Percival was the team's primary closer 
in 2008. On May 22, 2009, a day after allowing 2 runs in 1/3 of an inning 
against the Oakland Athletics, Percival was placed on Tampa Bay's disabled 
list, and has not pitched since. On August 11, 2009 he announced that he 
was likely to retire, and would cease his attempts at coming back from 
his current injury. From 2010 to 2012, Percival was a volunteer pitching 
coach at Riverside Polytechnic High School.[7] On September 24, 2012, Percival 
was hired as head varsity baseball coach at his alma mater, Moreno Valley 
High School.[8] On July 26, 2014, he was named head coach of the UC Riverside
