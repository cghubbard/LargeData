David Mark Eckstein (/ˈɛkʃtaɪn/; born January 20, 1975) is a retired American 
professional baseball player who was an infielder in Major League Baseball 
for ten seasons. He played college baseball for the University of Florida, 
and has played professionally for the Anaheim Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, 
Toronto Blue Jays, Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres. Eckstein 
won the 2006 World Series Most Valuable Player Award. Eckstein played baseball 
all four years at Seminole High School in Sanford, Florida. He was a two-time 
all-state selection, and a prominent member of a state championship team. 
He was also a member of the National Honor Society and the Fellowship of 
Christian Athletes. Eckstein was voted "Most Helpful" in the Class of 1993. 
In addition, Eckstein played American Legion Baseball for Post 53.[1] At 
the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, Eckstein was a walk-on 
player for coach Joe Arnold's Florida Gators baseball team in the fall 
of 1994; he later earned an athletic scholarship. A standout in the Southeastern 
Conference (SEC), he was a first-team All-SEC selection in 1995 and 1996, 
a first-team All-American in 1996, a three-time SEC Academic Honor Roll 
selection (1995–1997), and the first two-time Academic All-American in 
Gators baseball history. Eckstein was a member of the 1996 Gators squad 
that finished third in the College World Series. He was inducted into the 
University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a "Gator Great" in 2007.[2][3] 
Eckstein also played for the Harrisonburg Turks of the Valley Baseball 
League in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Eckstein was drafted by the Boston Red 
Sox in the 19th round of the 1997 amateur draft, and selected off waivers 
by the Anaheim Angels on August 16, 2000. During the 2002 championship 
year, he led the major leagues with three grand slams, including grand 
slams in back-to-back games against the Toronto Blue Jays, one of which 
was a walk-off grand slam leading the Angels to complete the sweep over 
Toronto, at a time when the Angels were 7–14. After the sweep of the Jays, 
the Angels went on to win 20 of their next 23 games.[4] At the end of the 
2004 season, Eckstein was part of a "shortstop merry-go-round," in which 
three free agent shortstops swapped teams: Edgar Rentería went from the 
Cardinals to the Boston Red Sox, Orlando Cabrera went from the Red Sox 
to the Angels, and Eckstein went from the Angels to the Cardinals.[5] In 
his first seven seasons, he amassed 1,079 hits while batting .286. He was 
voted to the National League All-Star team in 2005, along with teammates 
Chris Carpenter, Albert Pujols, Jason Isringhausen and Jim Edmonds. He 
was a late addition to the 2006 All-Star team. In 3,772 regular season 
at-bats, Eckstein struck out only 305 times, with a total of 22 in 2007. 
Eckstein was a fan favorite in St. Louis, who considered him to be a "pesky" 
hitter[6] (he chokes up on the bat about 2 inches[7]). On Mother's Day, 
May 14, 2006, Eckstein was one of more than 50 hitters who brandished a 
pink bat to benefit the Breast Cancer Foundation. As a member of the 2006 
World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals, Eckstein was named the World 
Series MVP. Following a 1–11 start in the first 2 games of the World Series, 
Eckstein went 8 for 22 with 4 RBI and scored 3 runs in the series, including 
going 4-for-5 with three doubles in game 4. The World Series victory with 
the Cardinals made Eckstein one of few[quantify] starting shortstops who 
have won a World Series in both the American and National Leagues. Eckstein 
was brought back in front of over 47,000 fans to throw out the first pitch 
of Game 6 of the World Series in St. Louis on October 27, 2011. On November 
5, 2007, Eckstein became a free agent along with Kip Wells, Troy Percival, 
and Miguel Cairo. On December 13, 2007, he signed a one-year, $4.5 million 
contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 31, 2008, Eckstein was traded 
to the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor league pitcher Chad Beck.[8] On January 
15, 2009, he signed a discounted one-year contract with the San Diego Padres 
on the condition that he would play primarily second base.[9] On August 
22, 2009, the San Diego Padres extended Eckstein's contract through 2010. 
Eckstein did not join a team for the 2011 season. In June, it was reported 
that he received offers from the Padres and other teams, but opted to not 
play baseball. He is working for his wife, actress Ashley Eckstein.[10] 
He officially retired on January 22, 2012.[11] Eckstein became a candidate 
for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum for the 
first time on November 9, 2015.[12] He earned two votes.[13] Eckstein was 
born in Sanford, Florida. He married actress Ashley Drane on November 26, 
2005, at his family church in Sanford, Florida, followed by a reception 
at Walt Disney World.[14] He is a fan of professional wrestling, having 
made public appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling during the 
2006 World Series and on February 11, 2007, he co-managed (along with Tampa 
Bay Rays outfielder Johnny Damon) TNA wrestler Lance Hoyt for his match 
with current White Sox conditioning coach Dale Torborg, managed by Sox 
catcher A.J. Pierzynski at TNA's Against All Odds pay-per-view. His older 
brother, Rick, is the former hitting coach for the Washington Nationals.[10]
