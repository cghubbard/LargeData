Brewery Ommegang is a Belgian brewery located near Cooperstown, New York 
that specializes in Belgian-style ales. Ommegang began brewing Belgian-style 
ales in 1997. Founded by Don Feinberg and Wendy Littlefield, owners of 
Vanberg & DeWulf beer import company, and three family owned Belgian breweries 
including Duvel Moortgat. Ommegang started up in a purpose-built building 
based on a traditional Belgian farmhouse, set on a former 136-acre (0.55 km2) 
hop farm in the Susqehanna River Valley, four miles (6 km) south of Cooperstown, 
New York in the Town of Milford. Since its opening, Ommegang has grown 
rapidly — in early 2005, its owner said they have been unable to meet demand 
for their ales and as a result would add 40 percent to their production 
capacity over the next year. By 2003, the Belgian breweries had all been 
absorbed into large corporations. Feinberg and Littlefield sold their share 
of Ommegang in 2003 to Belgian brewer Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat, brewers 
of the world-renowned Duvel Golden Ale. Duvel Moortgat brewed limited amounts 
of beer for Brewery Ommegang in 2006 to help meet demand, but has not brewed 
any since then. Brewery Ommegang currently distributes its beers in 46 
states and Washington, D.C., including Alaska and Hawaii but excluding 
Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Mississippi. Ommegang has also begun 
exporting to Canada, the US Virgin Islands and Mexico. Each summer, the 
brewery hosts a large beer-tasting event, known as Belgium Comes to Cooperstown. 
The event, which occurs on a Saturday in July or August, includes seven 
hours of unlimited beer sampling of over 200 Belgian and Belgian-style 
beers, followed by food, live music, and a bonfire. The real fun begins 
afterwords, bring a tent and beer to share. On 7 October 2007, Brewery 
Ommegang hosted the inaugural "CX @ Ommegang," a cyclocross race, organized 
by Team SCARR, a cycling team with Brewery Ommegang as their title sponsor. 
Cyclocross is wildly popular in Belgium and a cyclocross race on the grounds 
of a Belgian-style brewery was a natural fit. Well over 150 racers from 
all over New York State registered for the event. The course included a 
hairpin turn inside the main event tent. Ommegang brews six ales full-time: 
Ommegang Abbey Ale and Three Philosophers can be aged for flavoring. Ommegang 
recommends ageing Hennepin up to 3 years, Abbey and Three Philosophers 
up to 5 years. Ommegang brews several one-off beers with a few repeat visits. 
2007: 2008: 2009: 2010: 2011: 2012: 2013: In 2013 Ommegang will make available 
the first in a series of brews based on the HBO TV series Game of Thrones:
