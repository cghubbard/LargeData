The Detroit Tigers are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in 
Detroit, Michigan. They play in the American League Central division. The 
first game of the new baseball season is played on Opening Day, and being 
named the starter that day is an honor, which is often given to the player 
who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] though there 
are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start 
on Opening Day.[2] Since joining the league in 1901, the Tigers have used 
55 different Opening Day starting pitchers. The Tigers have a record of 
55 wins and 59 losses in their Opening Day games.[3] They also played one 
tie game, in 1927.[3][4][5] The Tigers have played in three different home 
ball parks, Bennett Park from 1901 through 1911, Tiger Stadium (also known 
as Navin Field and Briggs Stadium) from 1912 to 1999 and Comerica Park 
since 2000. They had a record of 5 wins and 2 losses in Opening Day games 
at Bennett Park, 19 wins and 22 losses at Tiger Stadium and 3 wins and 
4 losses at Comerica Park, for a total home record in Opening Day games 
of 26 wins and 28 losses.[3] Their record in Opening Day away games is 
26 wins, 31 losses and one tie.[3][4][5] Jack Morris has the most Opening 
Day starts for the Tigers, with 11 consecutive starts from 1980 to 1990. 
Morris had a record of seven wins and four losses in his Opening Day starts. 
George Mullin had ten Opening Day starts for the Tigers between 1903 and 
1913. The Tigers won five of those games and lost the other five. Mickey 
Lolich had seven Opening Day starts between 1965 and 1974. He had a record 
of five wins and two losses in those starts. Justin Verlander has also 
made seven Opening Day starts for the Tigers, between 2008 and 2014. His 
record in those starts is one win and one loss with five no-decisions. 
Other Tiger pitchers with at least three Opening Day starts include Hal 
Newhouser with six, Earl Whitehill and Jim Bunning with four; and Tommy 
Bridges, Frank Lary and Mike Moore with three.[3] The first game the Tigers 
played as a Major League team was on April 25, 1901, against the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[6] Roscoe Miller was the Tigers Opening Day starting pitcher for 
that game, which the Tigers won 14â€“13.[6] The Tigers have played in the 
World Series eleven times, in 1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 
1968, 1984, 2006, and 2012, with wins in four of those: 1935, 1945, 1968 
and 1984.[7] The Tigers Opening Day starting pitchers in those seasons 
were Mullin (1907 and 1909), Ed Siever (1908), Firpo Marberry (1934), Rowe 
(1935), Newsom (1940), Newhouser (1945), Earl Wilson (1968), Morris (1984), 
Kenny Rogers (2006), and Justin Verlander (2012).[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] 
The Tigers won five of those Opening Day games and lost the other five.[3] 
Josh Billings was the Tigers Opening Day starting pitcher in 1928, despite 
being only 20 years old and having only won five Major League games prior 
to the season.[18][19] Bunning, who made four Opening Day starts for the 
Tigers was later elected to the United States Senate.[20] McLain, who made 
two Opening Day starts for the Tigers, was later convicted of embezzlement.[21] 
Bunning and Newhouser have each been inducted into the Baseball Hall of
