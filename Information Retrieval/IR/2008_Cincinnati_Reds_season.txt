The Cincinnati Reds' 2008 season was their 127th in total and their sixth 
in their present home park, Great American Ball Park. The Reds play in 
the National League's central division; their divisional foes were the 
Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, Houston Astros, and 
Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cubs were the defending champions. The Reds had 
not made the playoffs since 1995.[1] The 2008 season was manager Dusty 
Baker's first with the Reds; the 19-year major league veteran outfielder 
from 1968 to 1986 with the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco 
Giants, and Oakland Athletics, previously managed the San Francisco Giants 
from 1993 to 2002 and the Chicago Cubs from 2003 to 2006. He took the entire 
2007 off. Baker replaced Pete Mackanin, who was named the interim manager 
on July 1, 2007, after Jerry Narron, coincidentally hired as an interim 
manager himself,was fired. Baker was the club's first-ever African American 
manager.[2] The season was dedicated to a number of people who died prior 
to the beginning of the season. Primarily, former Reds left-handed pitcher 
and longtime announcer Joe Nuxhall, affectionately known to fans as "The 
Ol' Lefthander", who died on November 15, 2007 of cancer. A patch that 
said "NUXY" was worn on Reds uniforms. Other Reds figures who passed were 
Sheldon "Chief" Bender, a former major league pitcher who developed the 
Reds' minor league farm system in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. Bender 
died on February 27, 2008. He worked with general manager Bob Howsam, who 
had died eight days earlier, to develop the Reds into 1970s powerhouse 
team nicknamed "The Big Red Machine". Just 21 games into the 2008 season, 
the Reds fired 3rd year General Manager Wayne Krivsky and replaced him 
with former St. Louis Cardinals General Manager Walt Jocketty. The Reds 
had at 9â€“12 record, tied for 4th in the NL Central standings at the time 
of the firing. It was the team's worst start since the 2003 season.The 
Reds again stirred up controversy in Cincinnati in late July and early 
August by first trading right fielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who a month earlier 
had hit his 600th home run, to the Chicago White Sox at the trade deadline. 
On their next off day they sent popular left fielder Adam Dunn to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks for two minor leaguers and pitcher Micah Owings. Infielders
