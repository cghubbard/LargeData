Matthew Thomas Cain (born October 1, 1984), nicknamed The Horse,[1] Big 
Daddy, and Big Sugar,[2][3] is an American professional baseball starting 
pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). Cain 
is 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighs 230 pounds (100 kg). He bats 
and throws right-handed. Cain throws five pitches: a four-seam fastball, 
a two-seam fastball, a slider, a curveball, and a changeup.[4] Cain was 
drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round of the 2002 Major 
League Baseball draft out of high school. He advanced quickly through the 
minor leagues and made his debut with the Giants in 2005, becoming the 
youngest player in the National League (NL) that year. In 2006 (his first 
full season), Cain won 13 games and finished tied for fifth in NL Rookie 
of the Year voting. Cain had the 10th-best earned run average (ERA) in 
the NL in 2007, but he finished second in the league with 16 losses due 
to poor run support. In 2009, Cain was named an All-Star for the first 
time in his career; he won 14 games and had a winning record for the first 
time since 2006. Cain only won 13 games in 2010, but he saved his best 
pitching for the playoffs, as he did not allow an earned run any of the 
three playoff games he pitched in as the Giants won their first World Series 
since 1954. In 2011, Cain won 12 games and had a 2.88 ERA. Cain threw the 
22nd perfect game in Major League Baseball history on June 13, 2012. He 
had a 16–5 record during the regular season, and he finished sixth in NL 
Cy Young Award voting. He won every series-clinching playoff game for the 
Giants as they won the 2012 World Series. Cain was born to Tom and Dolores 
Cain in Dothan, Alabama. He lived in Vincent, Alabama, for a year when 
his mother taught at a school nearby.[5] Cain also spent part of his childhood 
in Germantown, Tennessee, where he attended Houston High School.[6] He 
took lessons on how to pitch from Mauro Gozzo, who lived near the Cains 
in Tennessee.[7] As a senior at Houston High School, Cain struck out 83 
batters in 62 innings pitched while recording a 1.03 earned run average 
(ERA). Cain was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the first round 
(25th overall) in the 2002 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft.[8] He began 
his professional career in 2002 with the rookie Arizona League Giants. 
In eight games (seven starts), he had an 0–1 record, a 3.72 ERA, 20 strikeouts, 
and 11 walks in 19 1⁄3 innings pitched. He spent 2003 with the Hagerstown 
Suns of the Single-A South Atlantic League. In 14 starts for the Suns, 
he had a 4–4 record, a 2.55 ERA, 90 strikeouts, and 24 walks in 74 innings 
pitched.[9] Prior to 2004, Cain was ranked the number two prospect in the 
Giants' organization (behind Merkin Valdez) by Baseball America.[10][11] 
Cain spent 2004 with two teams. He began the season with the San Jose Giants 
of the Single-A advanced California League. In 13 starts, he had a 7–1 
record, a 1.86 ERA, 89 strikeouts, and 17 walks in 72 2⁄3 innings pitched. 
In June, he was promoted to the Norwich Navigators of the Double-A Eastern 
League. In 15 starts, he had a 6–4 record, a 3.35 ERA, 72 strikeouts, and 
40 walks in 86 innings pitched.[9] Cain led Giants' minor league prospects 
in wins, strikeouts, and ERA; he was named the Giants' Organizational Player 
of the Year.[12] Baseball America ranked Cain as the 13th-best prospect 
in baseball in 2005, as well as the Giants' top prospect.[10] Cain attended 
spring training in 2005, but he began the season with the Fresno Grizzlies 
of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL).[13] In 26 starts, Cain had 
a 10–5 record and 145 2⁄3 innings pitched. He finished fifth (tied with 
R.A. Dickey and Adam Wainwright) in the PCL in wins and fourth with a 4.39 
ERA (behind Kevin Jarvis's 3.38, Chris Oxspring's 4.03, and Édgar González's 
4.37). He led the league with 176 strikeouts.[14] Cain was called up to 
the Giants on August 26, 2005, to join their rotation.[15] He made his 
major league debut on August 29, at the age of 20 against the Colorado 
Rockies; he gave up only three hits and two runs in five innings but still 
ended up losing the game.[16] He earned his first major league win on September 
4 allowing one run in seven innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks.[17] 
He notched his first complete game, a two-hitter, against the Chicago Cubs 
on September 9.[18] Cain finished his first season with seven starts over 
46 1⁄3 innings in which he posted a 2–1 record, 30 strikeouts, a 2.33 ERA, 
a 0.928 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP), and a minuscule .151 
opponent batting average.[1][12] When he was called up, Cain was the second 
youngest player in the major leagues (Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners 
was the youngest).[16] Cain's 2005 performance was impressive enough that 
manager Felipe Alou named him to the team's 2006 starting rotation before 
spring training began. Cain began the season as the team's fourth starter.[19] 
Entering the season, he was again ranked as the Giants' top prospect by 
Baseball America, which also named him the 10th-best prospect in baseball.[10] 
In 2006, Cain struggled with consistency, but showed signs of dominance 
in several starts, flirting with a no-hitter on more than one occasion.[20][21] 
On April 24, Cain did not allow a base runner until the sixth inning in 
a win over the New York Mets.[22] On May 21, Cain pitched his first complete 
game shutout, a one-hitter against the Oakland Athletics.[23] On June 19, 
Cain pitched 7 2⁄3 innings of no-hit ball against the Los Angeles Angels 
of Anaheim before finally surrendering a single to Chone Figgins.[24] Late 
in the season, Cain increased his chances for Rookie of the Year consideration 
with a run of remarkable pitching.[25] From August 17 to September 14 Cain 
recorded a 5–0 record with an ERA of 0.21. During this streak, he allowed 
just one earned run in 42 innings—and did not allow an earned run in 30 2⁄3 
innings.[21] He led all National League (NL) rookie pitchers with 13 wins, 
179 strikeouts, and 190 2⁄3 innings pitched in 2006. His 2006 record was 
13–12, with a 4.15 ERA.[12] Cain finished in a fifth-place tie with Andre 
Ethier in the NL Rookie of the Year voting.[26] Cain began 2007 as the 
Giants' number two starter.[27] In April, he had a 1.54 ERA with 12 hits 
in 35 innings pitched.[28] On April 22, he pitched a complete game allowing 
one run (in the ninth) and three hits in a 2–1 victory over Arizona. It 
was the third complete game of his young career. Cain's record through 
August 3 was 3–12. He had limited opponents to a batting average of .238 
against him during that stretch. The Giants scored two or fewer runs in 
20 of Cain's first 30 starts.[29] Additionally, the bullpen blew four leads 
behind him.[30] Cain went 4–1 over his next five starts.[28] This stretch 
was bolstered in part by a power surge at the plate by Cain himself. He 
hit his first and second career home runs in these starts, off Tim Redding 
of the Washington Nationals and Cubs' ace Carlos Zambrano.[31][32] In September, 
he had an 0–3 record.[28] Cain finished the season with the 10th-lowest 
ERA in the NL at 3.65. He had a 7–16 record; his 16 losses were second 
in the league (Kip Wells had 17).[33] The Giants went 9–23 in his starts; 
the bullpen lost leads in five of his starts and the team scored 2 runs 
or fewer in 21 of his starts.[34] He had 163 strikeouts and 79 walks in 
200 innings pitched; he led the league with 12 wild pitches.[1] On April 
12, 2008, Cain took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the St. 
Louis Cardinals before allowing a leadoff double to Albert Pujols; he allowed 
two runs in 6 2⁄3 innings and hit a home run against Todd Wellemeyer but 
received a no-decision as the Giants lost 8–7 in 10 innings.[35] He allowed 
two runs in eight innings and hit a home run against Brandon Backe on May 
13, earning the win as the Giants defeated the Houston Astros 4–2.[36] 
He struck out a season-high 11 batters on June 15 while giving up three 
runs in seven innings, but he took the loss as the Athletics beat the Giants 
4–0.[37][38] He threw eight shutout innings on July 1, striking out 10 
and earning the win in a 2–1 victory over the Cubs.[39] On July 24, despite 
battling the flu, Cain threw a shutout, helping the Giants beat the Nationals 
1–0.[40] Cain went 8–14 with a 3.76 ERA. He had 186 strikeouts (tied with 
Ricky Nolasco for eighth in the league) and 217 2⁄3 innings (fifth in the 
league). His 14 losses were tied for fourth in the league with Johnny Cueto, 
Backe, Braden Looper, and Zach Duke (behind teammate Barry Zito's and Aaron 
Harang's 17 and John Lannan's 15); he was one of eight NL pitchers to make 
34 starts.[41] Cain's season record was deceiving, as he received the lowest 
run support in the NL.[12] Cain was the Giants' number three starter in 
2009.[12] He threw six shutout innings and had an RBI single against Mike 
Pelfrey on May 17 in a 2–0 victory over the Mets.[42] In his next start 
on May 23, he threw a complete game, allowing just one run as San Francisco 
defeated the Seattle Mariners 5–1.[43] On June 4, in the second game of 
a doubleheader, he threw a five-inning complete game, allowing one run 
in a 4–1 victory over the Nationals.[44] He allowed one run in a complete 
game against Oakland on June 14, striking out nine as the Giants won 7–1.[45] 
From May 7 through June 14, Cain won seven straight decisions.[12] On July 
5, Cain was announced as an All-Star for the first time in his young career.[46] 
On Cain's final start before the All-Star Game, he was hit by a line drive 
right below his elbow and was forced to miss pitching for the NL All-Star 
Team, although he did still attend and was announced as an All-Star. Duke 
replaced Cain on the NL All-Star team.[47] Cain threw a complete game on 
August 3 against Houston; however, he suffered the loss for the first time 
in his career when throwing a complete game, allowing four runs in a 4–3 
defeat.[48] On September 25, Cain was awarded the Willie Mac Award.[49] 
Cain finished the 2009 season with a 14–8 record in 33 starts. He had a 
2.89 ERA (seventh in the NL), 171 strikeouts, 73 walks, and 217 2⁄3 innings 
pitched (seventh). He was tied for first in complete games thrown (four) 
with teammate Tim Lincecum. He finished ninth in the league with a .636 
winning percentage.[50] He finished the season with a career-high in wins 
and winning percentage.[12] In 2010, Cain was part of a rotation that included 
2008 and 2009 NL Cy Young Award winner Lincecum, 2002 American League Cy 
Young Award winner Barry Zito, Jonathan Sánchez, and Wellemeyer[51] (who 
was replaced midseason by Madison Bumgarner).[52] On May 22, Cain threw 
a complete game and allowed just one run but was charged with the loss 
as Oakland defeated the Giants 1–0.[53] In his next start, on May 28, Cain 
shut out the Diamondbacks, allowing one hit (a double by Mark Reynolds) 
as the Giants won 5–0.[54] In the month of May, Cain pitched into the sixth 
inning or later in all six of his starts while giving up nine earned runs 
on 23 hits with 35 strikeouts and 18 walks in 44 2⁄3 innings pitched with 
an overall record of 3–3 and a 1.81 earned run average.[55] On August 1, 
for the first time in his career, Cain defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 
by throwing 7 2⁄3 scoreless innings in a 2–0 victory.[56] He took a no-hitter 
into the eighth inning on September 26 against Colorado before finally 
allowing a one-out single to Jay Payton; Cain wound up allowing two runs 
while throwing a complete game in a 4–2 victory over the Rockies.[57] For 
the season Cain was 13–11 with a 3.14 ERA, 177 strikeouts, and 61 walks. 
He finished sixth in the league with a 1.08 WHIP and 223 1⁄3 innings pitched. 
He tied for third with four complete games (tied with Ubaldo Jiménez and 
Johan Santana behind Roy Halladay's nine and Wainwright's five), including 
two shutouts (which made him one of seven players in the NL to throw two 
or more shutouts).[58] He tied for 12th in NL Cy Young Award voting with 
Bronson Arroyo.[59] Cain reached the playoffs for the first time in his 
career as the Giants won the NL West to reach the playoffs for the first 
time since 2003. In Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Atlanta 
Braves on October 8, Cain allowed one unearned run in 6 2⁄3 innings but 
received a no-decision as the Giants lost 5–4 in 11 innings.[60] In Game 
3 of the NL Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies on October 
19, he threw seven shutout innings and earned the win in a 3–0 victory 
over the Phillies.[61] The Giants defeated the Phillies in six games.[62] 
On October 28, Cain capped an impressive post-season performance as he 
pitched 7 2⁄3 scoreless innings in Game 2 of the World Series against the 
Texas Rangers (a 9–0 Giants' victory) to become the fifth pitcher to pitch 
at least 20 innings in the postseason without allowing an earned run.[63] 
His total post-season stats of a 2–0 record, with a 0.00 ERA through 21 
1⁄3 innings pitched helped the Giants win their first championship in San 
Francisco.[12] Cain threw a complete game against the Nationals on June 
8, 2011, striking out 11, allowing one run, and hitting an RBI double against 
Yunesky Maya in a 3–1 Giants victory.[64] On June 25, he threw seven shutout 
innings (retiring 14 hitters in a row at one point) and earned the win 
in a 1–0 victory over the Cleveland Indians.[65] On June 30 at Wrigley 
Field, Cain struck out the Chicago Cubs' Koyie Hill for his one-thousandth 
career strikeout, becoming the fifth San Francisco Giants pitcher to reach 
the milestone.[66] Also, he again threw seven shutout innings but received 
a no-decision this time in the Giants' 13-inning, 5–2 loss to the Cubs.[67] 
He was an All-Star for the second time in his career in 2011; however, 
he did not appear in the All-Star Game because he started the final regular 
season game prior to the All-Star contest.[68] He had a 2.64 ERA in 14 
starts after the All-Star break but earned just four wins in that stretch.[69] 
On July 27, Cain allowed an unearned run in seven innings, earning the 
win in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies.[70] Cain had one strikeout and 
one walk in the game, ending his Giants' record (since 1900) of 39 consecutive 
starts with more strikeouts than walks.[12] On September 18, Cain allowed 
five runs (three earned) in five innings and hit his fifth career home 
run against Esmil Rogers, earning the win as the Giants defeated Colorado 
12–5.[71] In 33 starts, Cain had a 12–11 record, 179 strikeouts, and 63 
walks. His 2.88 ERA was eighth in the league, and his 221 2⁄3 innings pitched 
were seventh in the league.[72] He finished eighth in Cy Young Award voting.[73] 
On April 2, 2012, Cain agreed to a five-year contract extension worth a 
guaranteed $112.5 million through 2017 with an option for 2018, at the 
time surpassing Kevin Brown for the largest deal for a right-handed pitcher. 
Cain earned a $5 million signing bonus, and will earn $20 million each 
season from 2013–17. His $21 million option for 2018 will vest automatically 
if he is not on the disabled list to an elbow or shoulder injury in 2017 
and if he reaches 400 innings in 2016 and 2017 combined. If the option 
fails to vest, the Giants can either pick up the $21 million option or 
pay a $7.5 million buyout. Cain was scheduled to become a free agent after 
the 2012 season.[74] On April 13, pitching the Giants' home opener, Cain 
threw a complete game shut out, striking out 11. Facing 28 batters in 9 
innings, one over the minimum, he allowed a single baserunner on a hit 
to James McDonald, the pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.[75] It was the 
third one-hitter of Cain's career.[76] In his next start, on April 18, 
Cain threw another 9 shutout innings using only 91 pitches, dueling Cliff 
Lee of the Phillies who threw 102 pitches over 10 scoreless innings. The 
first 9 innings took only 1 hour and 49 minutes. The Giants went on to 
win in the 11th inning.[77][78][79] Following a dominant first half, Cain 
was selected to the All-Star Game and was chosen by manager Tony La Russa 
to be the NL's starting pitcher. On July 10 at Kauffman Stadium, Cain allowed 
a leadoff single to Derek Jeter before retiring the six remaining hitters 
he faced; he was the winning pitcher in an 8–0 decision.[80] On July 21, 
Cain hit his sixth career home run, off of Phillies' pitcher Cole Hamels 
in the third inning of a 10-inning, 6–5 Giants' victory. Later in that 
inning Hamels hit his first career home run off of Cain, making this the 
first time since 2002 when two pitchers have homered off of each other 
in the same game (Kevin Millwood and Denny Stark were the last to do it).[81] 
Cain had a 16–5 record in 2012. He tied with six other players for sixth 
in the NL in wins, finished fourth with a 2.79 ERA (behind Clayton Kershaw's 
2.53, Dickey's 2.73, and Cueto's 2.78), and finished third with 219 1⁄3 
innings pitched (behind Dickey's 233 2⁄3 and Kershaw's 227 2⁄3). He finished 
eighth with 193 strikeouts, joining teammates Bumgarner and Lincecum among 
the top 10 in the NL in that category. He was one of seven NL players to 
throw two or more shutouts.[82] Cain finished sixth in NL Cy Young Award 
voting.[83] Cain reached the playoffs for the second time in his career 
as the Giants won the NL West after missing the playoffs in 2011. In Game 
1 of the NL Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds on October 6, he 
allowed three runs in five innings and took the loss as the Reds defeated 
the Giants 5–2.[84] In Game 5 on October 11, he began the game with four 
scoreless innings; Cain would allow three runs over 5 2⁄3 innings as the 
Giants won 6–4 to advance to the next round of the playoffs.[85] In Game 
3 of the NLCS against the Cardinals on October 17, Cain allowed three runs 
in 6 2⁄3 innings and was charged with the loss as the Giants lost 3–1.[86] 
On October 29, in Game 7, Cain threw 5 2⁄3 shutout innings and earned the 
win as the Giants won 9–0, marking the second time in the playoffs that 
Cain had won a series-clinching game.[87] In Game 4 of the 2012 World Series 
against the Tigers on October 28, Cain allowed three runs in seven innings, 
earning a no-decision as the Giants won 4–3 in 10 innings to win the World 
Series for the second time in three years.[88] On June 13, 2012, in a 10–0 
victory, Cain threw the 22nd perfect game in MLB history, against the Houston 
Astros, striking-out a career-high 14 batters (tying Sandy Koufax for the 
most strikeouts in a perfect game). It was the first perfect game for the 
Giants franchise (first in San Francisco), the ninth in NL history, the 
fifth no-hitter thrown by MLB pitchers in 2012, and the second perfect 
game of the season after Chicago White Sox pitcher Philip Humber threw 
one on April 21. Cain threw 125 pitches, the most by a pitcher in a perfect 
game, and received the most run support ever for a pitcher throwing a perfect 
game. Cain also singled against Rhiner Cruz and scored in the fifth inning.[89] 
San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, in recognition of the perfect game, presented 
Cain with the key to the city and made a proclamation that June 13 every 
year will be known as "Matt Cain Day".[90] In addition, Cain set a franchise 
record for a single-game score at 101 and is currently the first and only 
Giants pitcher to break the 100 barrier. Cain started on Opening Day for 
the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed 
due to a high pitch count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers 
beat the Giants 4–0.[91] On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before 
giving up nine runs in the third inning and getting removed from the game, 
becoming the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore 
in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3.[92] On August 23 against the 
Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in the pitching arm,[93] 
and was placed on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his career.[94] 
Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the 
first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 
4.00 ERA. Cain started the 2014 season 1–3 with a 3.66 ERA in his first 
eight starts, before being placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right 
hamstring on May 30, 2014.[95] Bruce Bochy stated that after the All Star 
break, Cain would move from the second place in the Giants starting rotation 
to fifth. Bochy added that Cain falling in the order had more to do with 
everyone else's successes than any shortcomings of Cain.[96] On July 4 
at Petco Park, Cain struck out the San Diego Padres' Tommy Medica for his 
1,500th career strikeout, becoming one of just eight Giants pitchers to 
reach that milestone. He also became the fourth Giants pitcher to reach 
the milestone since the franchise relocated to San Francisco in 1958.[97] 
Cain struggled for the remainder of the season before being sidelined due 
to elbow difficulties in July, pitching his last game on July 9, 2014. 
He ended the season with a 2–7 record and a 4.18 ERA. Before undergoing 
surgery on his right elbow to remove bone chips on August 11,[98] Cain 
revealed that he had pitched through bone chips for ten years, but that 
they had never been an issue until then.[99] In late September, Cain underwent 
surgery on his right ankle to remove a bone spur.[100] The Giants acquired 
Jake Peavy a few days before the trade deadline to fill in as a starting 
pitcher[101] and went on to win the 2014 World Series. Cain won his third 
World Series ring in five years. After recovering from elbow surgery, Cain 
gained more range of motion in his pitching arm, saying, "I feel like I'm 
18 again."[102][103] Before he could make his first regular-season start, 
Cain was placed on the disabled list with a flexor tendon strain in his 
right forearm.[104] In only 13 appearances (11 starts) in 2015, Cain went 
2–4 and posted a career-worst 5.79 ERA. He also posted his lowest K/9 of 
his career while allowing more hits than innings pitched. After starting 
the season 1-5, Cain was placed on the disabled list on May 28th with a 
hamstring injury.[105] After missing almost two months due to a hamstring 
injury, the Giants activated Cain off the disabled list on July 20th.[106] 
On July 31 at AT&T Park, in a 3-1 win over the Washington Nationals, Cain 
won his one-hundredth career game by tossing five no-hit innings on ninety-three 
pitches, making him the sixth pitcher in the San Francisco Era and the 
twenty-third pitcher in Giants franchise history to win at least one hundred 
games. Cain is the second Giant on the 2016 season to earn his one-hundredth 
career victory after teammate Johnny Cueto won his on April 26th.[107] 
Cain was left off the Giants 2016 Postseason Roster. [108] Cain features 
a mix of mostly four pitches: a four-seam fastball (90–93 mph), a cutter 
(84–87), a curveball (76–79), and a changeup (83–86). Increasingly, he 
also throws a two-seam fastball at 89–91 mph. Cain leads with his four-seamer, 
throwing it over half the time in his career. His changeup is his secondary 
pitch to left-handed hitters, while he throws cutters as a secondary pitch 
to right-handed hitters. Cain throws curveballs in roughly equal proportions 
to righties and lefties.[4] Cain met his wife Chelsea Williams during spring 
training while she was a student at Arizona State University majoring in 
sociology. At the time Chelsea was waitressing at a local steakhouse. The 
two were married in fall 2009 and had their first child, daughter Hartley, 
in December 2010. The family has homes in Arizona and Tennessee, as well 
as a home in Orinda.[12][109] Cain enjoys hunting as a hobby.[19] Cain 
supports Project Open Hand,[12] and has expressed his support for same-sex 
marriage by appearing in the "No H8" photo campaign opposing California's 
Proposition 8.[110] Footnotes Bibliography Italics denotes post-season perfect game
