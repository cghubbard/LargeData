Julio César Urías Acosta (born August 12, 1996) is a Mexican professional 
baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
The Dodgers signed him on August 23, 2012, shortly after his 16th birthday. 
Urias is the son of Carlos Urias.[1] He played with the Mexico national 
team as a youth, joining them on road trips since the age of 10.[2] The 
Dodgers discovered and signed Urias on the same June 2012 scouting trip 
in Mexico on which they signed Yasiel Puig.[3][4] The Dodgers paid a signing 
fee of $450,000, most of which went to the Diablos Rojos del México of 
the Mexican League.[5] Urías made his professional debut on May 25, 2013, 
for the Great Lakes Loons in the Midwest League as the youngest player 
in the league, striking out six batters over three shutout innings.[6] 
He made a total of 18 starts and finished the season 2–0 with a 2.48 ERA, 
recording 67 strikeouts in 54.1 innings.[2] He spent 2014 with the Rancho 
Cucamonga Quakes of the California League. In 25 appearances (20 of which 
were starts), he was 2–2 with a 2.36 ERA.[4][7] He struck out 109 batters 
while walking only 37.[8] Urías was selected to play for the World team 
at the 2014 All-Star Futures Game[9] and was selected as the Dodgers organizational 
"Minor League Pitcher of the Year" for 2014.[10] He received an invitation 
to attend the team's 2015 major league spring training camp.[11] After 
pitching in two games, for a total of two innings and a 4.50 ERA,[12] he 
was the first to be cut from the roster and was reassigned to the team's 
minor league camp on March 14, 2015.[13] Urías was ranked by MLBpipeline.com 
as the top left-handed pitching prospect in all of baseball entering the 
2015 season.[14] MLB.com ranked him the 8th-best prospect in baseball, 
and Baseball America named him the #10 prospect in 2015.[15][16] The Dodgers 
assigned him to the AA Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League to start the 
2015 season.[17] He was 3–4 with a 2.77 ERA in 13 starts for Tulsa.[18] 
Urias was promoted to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers on August 31, 2015.[19] 
He struggled in his first AAA action, allowing nine runs in 4 1⁄3 innings 
over two starts.[18] He also allowed six runs, including a grand slam homer, 
in just one inning in his one start in the Pacific Coast League playoffs.[20] 
He was again invited to attend Dodgers spring training.[21] He was assigned 
to AAA to begin the season, where he was 4–1 with a 1.10 ERA in seven starts.[18] 
He also had a 27 inning scoreless streak during the month of May for Oklahoma 
City.[22] Urías was promoted to the Dodgers to make his major league debut 
against the New York Mets on May 27, 2016. At only 19 years of age, he 
was the youngest starting pitcher to debut in the Majors since Félix Hernández 
in the 2005 season and the youngest Dodgers starting pitcher to debut since 
18 year old Rex Barney in the 1943 season.[23] He struggled in his debut, 
lasting only 2 2⁄3 innings while allowing five hits, three runs and four 
walks. He did strike out three, including the first batter he faced, Curtis 
Granderson.[24] He was optioned back to AAA after the game.[25] Three days 
later, he was returned to the active roster after starter Alex Wood went 
on the disabled list.[26] Urías made his second start on June 2 against 
the Chicago Cubs. In 5 innings pitched, he gave up 6 runs (5 earned), which 
included 3 home runs. He allowed 8 hits, and struck out 4.[27][28] He picked 
up his first major league win, against the Milwaukee Brewers, on June 28, 
2016, when he allowed two runs on two hits in six innings. He was the first 
teenage Dodger pitcher to throw 100 pitches in a game since Joe Moeller 
in 1962.[29] He pitched in 18 games for the Dodgers, 15 of them starts, 
and was 5–2 with a 3.39 ERA, 84 strikeouts and 31 walks.[30] Urías pitched 
two innings of relief in game five of the 2016 National League Division 
Series, picking up the win. At 20 years, 62 days old he became the youngest 
Dodgers pitcher to ever pitch in the post-season. He was two weeks younger 
than Don Drysdale was in game four of the 1956 World Series. He was also 
the fourth youngest pitcher in MLB post-season history, behind Ken Brett 
(1967 World Series), Bert Blyleven (1970 ALCS), and Don Gullett (1970 NLCS 
and 1970 World Series).[31] He became the youngest pitcher ever to start 
a post-season game when he started game four of the 2016 National League 
Championship Series. He allowed four runs in only 3 2⁄3 innings in the 
game.[32] Urias underwent three surgeries on his left eye during his youth 
to remove a benign mass. As a result, his left eye is nearly closed, but 
he is able to see through it.[4][33] When asked about his eye condition, 
Urias, a devout Roman Catholic,[34] said, "That's how God works. He gave 
me a bad left eye but a good left arm."[4] On May 19, 2015, Urias had an
