PONY Baseball and Softball is a non-profit organization with headquarters 
in Washington, Pennsylvania. Started in 1951,[1] PONY organizes youth baseball 
and softball leagues and tournaments, as over 500,000 players annually 
play PONY in over 4,000 leagues throughout the United States and over 40 
countries world-wide. Membership is open to children from age 4 to 23 and 
the leagues are organized in two-year age brackets with "an-under" programs.[2] 
Inception of the league PONY Baseball and Softball began with organization 
of the Pony League in Washington, Pennsylvania in the summer of 1951. This 
was a transition league for 13-year-old and 14-year-old players designed 
to take graduates of Little League Baseball from that diamond to the regulation-sized 
diamond. Growth of Pony League, primarily by word of mouth, was rapid, 
and by the end of the second season, 1952, the original six teams in Washington 
were joined by 505 others in 106 leagues around the country. A national 
tournament was conducted, and the first Pony League World Series was held 
that year. Lew Hays, among the founders of the Pony League, was named Commissioner 
of the new league when it was incorporated for national organization in 
early 1953 and held that post until 1964 when he was named president. In 
1953, John Laslo, long time Mayor of Martins Ferry, Ohio, visited with 
Hays and discussed organization of a league similar to Pony League for 
15-year-old and 16-year-old players. The purpose was to permit players 
in this age bracket to compete with players of like experience in their 
first years on the regulation diamond. Laslo guided the development of 
Colt League, and in late 1959, Pony League and Colt League were merged 
into a single organization. Growth of the league Bronco League, for 11-year-old 
and 12-year-old players, was organized in 1961 to permit players of this 
age to play the complete game of baseball. With Colt League using the regulation 
diamond with 90 foot base paths, Pony League uses a diamond with 80 base 
paths as a transition between the regulation diamond and the 70 foot diamond 
used in Bronco League. In 1970 the Mustang League was developed in Fort 
Worth, Texas using a diamond with 60 foot base paths, to provide an organizational 
structure for leagues for beginning players, 9-and 10-year-olds. For communities 
using players of 7 and 8 years of age, rules and emblems were developed 
for Pinto League, a very elementary form of baseball. Thorobred League 
was organized in the Tampa, Florida area and became a part of the PONY 
Baseball family in 1973 to provide playing opportunity for those players 
from 17 through 20 years of age who have not entered professional play 
and who retain a desire to participate in a community baseball program. 
In 1977, Thorobred League age limits were expanded to include 21-year-old 
age players, and Palomino League was organized for players 17 and 18. Shetland 
League, an instructional program for 5 and 6-year-olds, was formally adopted 
by PONY for the 1990 season with rules based on the experiences of a number 
of league organizations that had conducted play in this age group for several 
years. While girls are permitted to play in any of the PONY Baseball leagues, 
recognizing that most girls preferred to compete in leagues with other 
girls, PONY Baseball provided Softball for Girls leagues in 1976. Colt 
League provides for girls 16-and-under and Bronco League for those 12-and-under. 
In communities where sufficient players are available, the Colt League 
may consist of players 15 and 16, and a Pony League used for those 13 and 
14. Both Pony and Colt softball leagues used a regulation softball diamond 
with 60 foot base paths in fast pitch. In like manner, if there are enough 
players, the Bronco League may be limited to players of 11 and 12 years 
of age and Mustang League used for those 10-and-under. These leagues for 
younger girls use a softball diamond with a 50 foot base path. Older girls, 
17 and 18, play in the Palomino League on the 65 foot diamond in slowpitch. 
In 1999, the emblems for all leagues were changed to a common emblem with 
a new pony head and the name of each league under it. The Name PONY Baseball 
Inc. is the corporate name under which Shetland League, Pinto League, Mustang 
League, Bronco League, Pony League, Colt League and Palomino League are 
operated in baseball and softball. PONY is taken from the first letters 
of each word in the slogan, "Protect Our Nation's Youth." Originally suggested 
by boys at the Y.M.C.A. in Washington, Pennsylvania, the slogan was "Protect 
Our Neighborhood Youth," and the change to "Nation's" youth was made after 
the original Washington Pony League developed into a national program. 
PONY Presidents Joe Brown (1953-1964) The First President Joe E. Brown, 
comedian, acrobat, actor, a man whose career spanned the entertainment 
world from vaudeville and the silent movies, through the circus, fairs 
and carnivals to the Broadway stage and radio and television, became the 
first president of Pony League when the organization was incorporated in 
1953. He continued in the post until late 1964 when he retired. A one-time 
minor league player, Brown was later part owner of the Kansas City Blues 
and in 1953 did pre-game and post-game radio interviews for the New York 
Yankees. He is the father of Joe L. Brown, former general manager of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates and was instrumental in the settling of the Dodgers 
at Los Angeles after their move from Brooklyn. Likable and gregarious, 
Brown traveled many thousands of miles visiting G.I.s in far sections of 
the globe during World War II and later traveled additional thousands of 
miles telling the story of PONY Baseball hoping to interest adults in organizing 
baseball programs for young people. Lew Hays (1964-1980) One of the group 
who founded the original Washington Pony League, and recognized as the 
principal founder of PONY Baseball/ Softball, Inc. as a national and international 
youth baseball organization, is Lewis W. Hays. At the time of the founding 
of Pony League, Hays was sports editor of The Reporter newspaper, published 
by the Observer Publishing Company of Washington. Having served the office 
of Commissioner on a volunteer basis, while holding down his regular duties 
as sports editor since 1951, he was granted a leave of absence by the Observer 
Company in 1954 to assume leadership of Pony League on a full time basis. 
For thirty years, until his retirement in October 1980, Hays was the chief 
administrator of Pony League and later of PONY Baseball Inc. He served 
as Commissioner until 1964, when, following the retirement of Joe E. Brown, 
he became President. The United States Baseball Federation, (now USA Baseball), 
an organization encompassing all amateur baseball in the United States, 
selected Hays as its Chairman of the Board of Directors from 1976 through 
1993. In that position, he served as a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and helped to have baseball included as a sport in the Olympic Games. When 
he retired, Hays was elected to a life membership on the Board of Directors 
of PONY Baseball/Softball, Inc. Hays passed away in 1994. Abraham Key (1990-Present) 
A one-time player in the Washington, Pennsylvania Pony and Colt Leagues, 
Abraham Key assumed the Presidency of PONY Baseball and Softball in January, 
1995. He joined the staff on a full-time basis after graduating from West 
Virginia University's School of Journalism and School of Business in 1981. 
He had worked five years as a part-time employee while in high school and 
college. Key was elected to the PONY Baseball and Softball Wall of Fame 
in November 1986. Pony has occupied a new headquarters facility since 2005 
in Washington, Pennsylvania.[3] Children at the Washington, Pennsylvania 
YMCA named the organization PONY, which stood for "Protect Our Neighborhood 
Youth." This later became "Protect Our Nation's Youth." [2] In 2009, the 
PONY Baseball and Softball International board of directors formed a new 
division—the Champions League—for children with special needs.[4][5] Baseball
