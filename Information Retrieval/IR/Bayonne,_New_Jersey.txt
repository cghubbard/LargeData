Bayonne (pronounced bay-OWN) /ˌbeɪ ˈjoʊ̯n/[20] is a city in Hudson County, 
New Jersey, United States. Located in the Gateway Region, Bayonne is situated 
on a peninsula located between Newark Bay to the west, the Kill Van Kull 
to the south, and New York Bay to the east. As of the 2010 United States 
Census, the city's population was 63,024,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase 
of 1,182 (+1.9%) from the 61,842 counted in the 2000 Census, which had 
in turn increased by 398 (+0.6%) from the 61,444 counted in the 1990 Census.[21] 
Bayonne was originally formed as a township on April 1, 1861, from portions 
of Bergen Township. Bayonne was reincorporated as a city by an act of the 
New Jersey Legislature on March 10, 1869,[22] replacing Bayonne Township, 
subject to the results of a referendum held nine days later.[23] At the 
time it was formed, Bayonne included the communities of Bergen Point, Constable 
Hook, Centreville, Pamrapo and Saltersville.[24] Bayonne is east of Newark, 
the state's largest city, north of Elizabeth in Union County and west of 
Brooklyn. It shares a land border with Jersey City to the north and is 
connected to Staten Island by the Bayonne Bridge.[25] While somewhat diminished, 
traditional manufacturing, distribution, and maritime activities remain 
a driving force of the economy of the city, and a portion of the Port of 
New York and New Jersey is located there. Originally inhabited by Native 
Americans, the region presently known as Bayonne was claimed by the Netherlands 
after Henry Hudson explored the Hudson River which is named after him. 
According to Royden Page Whitcomb's 1904 book, First History of Bayonne, 
New Jersey, the name Bayonne is speculated to have originated with Bayonne, 
France, from which Huguenots settled for a year before the founding of 
New Amsterdam.[26] However, there is no empirical evidence for this notion, 
which is considered apocryphal. Whitcomb gives more credence to the idea 
that Erastus Randall, E.C. Bramhall and B.F. Woolsey, who bought the land 
owned by Jasper and William Cadmus for real estate speculation, named it 
Bayonne for purposes of real estate speculation, because it was located 
on the shores of two bays, Newark and New York.[27] The city experienced 
strikes that led to significant civil unrest during the Bayonne refinery 
strikes of 1915–1916, in which mostly Polish American workers staged labor 
actions against Standard Oil of New Jersey and Tidewater Petroleum, seeking 
improved pay and working conditions.[28] Four striking workers were killed 
when strikebreakers protected by police fired into a crowd.[29] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 11.082 
square miles (28.702 km2), including 5.804 square miles (15.033 km2) of 
land and 5.278 square miles (13.669 km2) of water (47.62%) was water.[1][2] 
The city is located south of Jersey City on a peninsula earlier known as 
Bergen Neck surrounded by Upper New York Bay to the east, Newark Bay to 
the west, and Kill Van Kull to the south. Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the city include:[30] 
Bergen Point, Constable Hook and Port Johnson.[citation needed] At the

sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.[42] 
The Bayonne Town Center, located within the Broadway shopping district, 
includes retailers, eateries, consumer and small business banking centers. 
The Bayonne Medical Center is a for-profit hospital that anchors the northern 
end of the Town Center. It is the city's largest employer, with over 1,200

in the United States.[43] Bayonne Crossing on Route 440 in Bayonne, includes 
a Lowe's, New York Sports Club, and Wal-Mart.[44] On the site of the former 
Military Ocean Terminal, the Peninsula at Bayonne Harbor includes new housing 
and businesses. One of them, Cape Liberty Cruise Port is located at the 
end of the long peninsula with Royal Caribbean.[45] Also found is a memorial 
park for the Tear of Grief, a monument that is 100 feet (30 m) high and 
weighs 175 short tons (159 t) commemorating September 11th, 2001 and the 
1993 World Trade Center bombing.[46] The firearms manufacturing company

Bay and connect to the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. A plaque unveiled 
on May 2, 2006, for the new Richard A. Rutkowski Park, a wetlands preserve 
on the northwestern end of town that is part of the RiverWalk. Also known 
as the Waterfront Park and Environmental Walkway, it is located immediately 
north of the Stephen R. Gregg Hudson County Park.[49] Hudson River Waterfront 
Walkway is part of a walkway that is intended to run the more than 18 miles 
(29 km) from the Bayonne Bridge to the George Washington Bridge.[50][51] 
In August 2014, the Bayonne Hometown Fair, a popular tourist and community 
attraction that ceased in 2000, was revived by a local business owner and 
resident. The first revived Bayonne Hometown Fair took place from June 
6–7, 2015.[52] The City of Bayonne has been governed within the Faulkner 
Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council 
system of municipal government (Plan C), implemented based on the recommendations 
of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1962,[53] before which it was 
governed by a Board of Commissioners under the Walsh Act. The governing 
body consists of a mayor and a five-member city council, of which two seats 
are elected at-large and three from wards.[7][3][54] As of 2016[update], 
the Mayor of Bayonne is Jimmy Davis, who was elected in a runoff election 
on June 10, 2014, against incumbent Mayor Mark Smith. Members of the Bayonne 
City Council are Council President Sharon Ashe-Nadrowski (At-large), Thomas 
Cotter (First Ward), Salvatore Gullace (Second Ward) and Gary La Pelusa, 
Sr. (Third Ward) and Juan M. Perez (At-large), all of whom are serving 
concurrent terms of office that end on June 30, 2018.[3][55][56] Bayonne 
is split between the 8th and 10th Congressional Districts[58] and is part 
of New Jersey's 31st state legislative district.[10][59][60] Prior to the 
2010 Census, Bayonne had been split between the 10th Congressional District 
and the 13th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting 
Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the 
November 2012 general elections.[61] The split placed 33,218 residents 
living in the city's south and west in the 8th District, while 29,806 residents 
in the northeastern portion of the city were placed in the 10th District.[58][62] 
New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District is represented by Albio Sires 
(D, West New York).[63] New Jersey's Tenth Congressional District is represented 
by Donald Payne Jr. (D, Newark).[64] New Jersey is represented in the United 
States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[65] and Bob Menendez

Assembly), the 31st Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature 
is represented in the State Senate by Sandra Bolden Cunningham (D, Jersey 
City) and in the General Assembly by Nicholas Chiaravalloti (D, Bayonne) 
and Angela V. McKnight (D, Jersey City).[68] The Governor of New Jersey

New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[70] Hudson County is governed 
by a directly elected County Executive and by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, 
which serves as the county's legislative body. Hudson County's Freeholder 
District 1 includes all of Bayonne and a part of Jersey City. As of 2015[update] 
is represented by Kenneth Kopacz[71] The County Executive is Democrat Thomas 
A. DeGise, whose term of office ends December 31, 2015.[72] As of March 
23, 2011, there were a total of 32,747 registered voters in Bayonne, of 
which 17,087 (52.2%) were registered as Democrats, 2,709 (8.3%) were registered 
as Republicans and 12,928 (39.5%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There 
were 23 voters registered to other parties.[73] In the 2012 presidential 
election, Democrat Barack Obama received 66.4% of the vote (13,467 cast), 
ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 32.6% (6,605 votes), and other candidates 
with 1.0% (197 votes), among the 20,454 ballots cast by the city's 34,424 
registered voters (185 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 59.4%.[74][75] 
In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 57.0% 
of the vote here (13,768 cast), ahead of Republican John McCain with 40.6% 
(9,796 votes) and other candidates with 1.2% (283 votes), among the 24,139 
ballots cast by the town's 35,823 registered voters, for a turnout of 67.4%.[76] 
In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 56.0% of 
the vote here (12,402 ballots cast), outpolling Republican George W. Bush 
with 42.2% (9,341 votes) and other candidates with 0.6% (184 votes), among 
the 22,135 ballots cast by the town's 32,129 registered voters, for a turnout 
percentage of 68.9.[77] In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Republican 
Chris Christie received 49.3% of the vote (5,322 cast), ahead of Democrat 
Barbara Buono with 49.1% (5,297 votes), and other candidates with 1.6% 
(169 votes), among the 10,987 ballots cast by the city's 34,957 registered 
voters (199 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 31.4%.[78][79] In the 
2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 53.8% of the 
vote here (7,421 ballots cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 
38.7% (5,333 votes), Independent Chris Daggett with 4.8% (662 votes) and 
other candidates with 1.3% (183 votes), among the 13,781 ballots cast by 
the town's 32,588 registered voters, yielding a 42.3% turnout.[80] The 
Bayonne Municipal Utilities Authority (BMUA) is the second agency to use 
wind power in New Jersey and has built the first wind turbine in the metropolitan 
area.[81][82][83][84][85] Construction of a single turbine tower was completed 
in January 2012.[86][87] It is the first wind turbine created by Leitwind 
to be installed in the United States.[88] In December 2012, the autonomous 
agency entered into a water management agreement with the Bayonne Water 
Joint Venture (BWJV), a partnership between United Water and investment 
firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts.[89] The 40-year concession agreement is 
a public-private partnership between the city and the BWJV in which the 
private partners pay off the BMUA's $130 million debt and take over the 
operations, maintenance, and capital improvement of Bayonne's water and 
wastewater utilities in exchange for a regulated share of the revenue.[90][91][92] 
United Water is managing the operations for the partnership, while KKR 
is providing 90% of the funding.[93] A rate schedule was included in the 
agreement, and it contained an immediate 8.5% utility rate increase (the 
first rate increase since 2006),[89] followed by two years without increases, 
followed by annual increases estimated to range between 2.5% - 4.5%.[91] 
This partnership was sought for several reasons, including the BMUA's debt, 
its shortage of skilled employees, and its lagging rate revenue from years 
without rate increases and reduced demand.[90][94] Part of this reduced 
demand stemmed from the closure of the Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne,[94] 
and the fact that the subsequent plans to redevelop the site with housing 
fell short.[95] The BMUA's $130 million debt that was paid off by the BWJV 
represented over half of Bayonne's overall debt ($240 million) at the time,[91] 
and in March 2013, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the credit rating 
of Bayonne from 'negative' to 'stable', citing the water deal.[93] The 
city of Bayonne is protected on a full-time, around-the-clock basis by 
the 161 professional firefighters of the city of Bayonne Fire Department 
(BFD), which was founded on September 3, 1906, and operates out of five 
fire stations, located throughout the city. The BFD operates a fire apparatus 
fleet of five engines, three ladders, one squad (rescue pumper), one rescue 
truck (part of the Metro USAR Collapse Rescue Strike Team), two fireboats, 
a Multi-Purpose Unit (M.P.U.), a large 4,000-US-gallon (15,000 l; 3,300 imp gal) 
foam tanker truck, a haz-mat truck,and numerous other special, support 
and reserve units. Each piece of apparatus is staffed by three fire fighters 
and a captain. Each platoon works on a 24 hours on, 72 hours off schedule 
and is commanded by a Battalion Chief. The BFD responds to approximately 
17,000 emergency calls annually. The current Chief of Department is Keith 
Weaver.[96] The department is part of the Metro USAR Strike Team, which 
consists of nine North Jersey fire departments and other emergency services 
divisions working to address major emergency rescue situations.[97] The 
Bayonne Board of Education serves students from pre-Kindergarten through 
twelfth grade. As of the 2011-12 school year, the district's 12 schools 
had an enrollment of 9,418 students and 646.0 classroom teachers (on an 
FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 14.58:1.[98] Schools in the 
district (with 2011-12 enrollment data from the National Center for Education 
Statistics[99]) are the 11 elementary schools — Henry E. Harris No. 1[100] 
(grades PreK-8; 636 students), Phillip G. Vroom No. 2[101] (PreK-8; 421), 
Dr. Walter F. Robinson No. 3[102] (PreK-8; 788), Mary J. Donohoe No. 4[103] 
(PreK-8; 485), Lincoln Community School No. 5[104] (PreK-8; 444), Horace 
Mann No. 6[105] (PreK-8; 599), Midtown Community School No. 8[106] (PreK-8; 
1,087), George Washington Community School No. 9[107] (PreK-8; 663), Woodrow 
Wilson School No. 10[108] (PreK-8; 617), John M. Bailey School No. 12[109] 
(PreK-8; 637) and Nicholas Oresko School No. 14[110] (PreK-8; 444) an advanced 
school for gifted and talented students in academics, the arts, and physical 
education; and Bayonne High School[111] (9-12; 2,597).[112][113] Bayonne 
High School is the only public school in the state to have an on-campus 
ice rink for its hockey team.[114] During the 1998-99 school year, Midtown 
Community School No. 8 was recognized with the National Blue Ribbon School 
Award of Excellence by the United States Department of Education.[115] 
During the 2008–09 school year, P.S. #14 was recognized as a Blue Ribbon 
School award, and Washington Community School No. 9 was honored during 
the 2009–10 school year.[116] For the 2004–05 school year, Mary J. Donohoe 
No. 4 School was named a "Star School" by the New Jersey Department of 
Education, the highest honor that a New Jersey school can achieve.[117] 
It is the fourth school in Bayonne to receive this honor. The other three 
are Bayonne High School in 1995–96,[118] Midtown Community School in 1996–97[119] 
and P.S. #14 in the 1998–99 school year.[120] Beginning with the 2006–07 
school year, the Board of Education implemented a dress code for students 
in pre-K through eighth grade. Under this code students wear a school logo 
shirt and a variety of pants, skirts, shorts, and other prescribed items. 
The plan was intended to "increase student identification with their schools 
and the district, eliminate many of the distractions associated with differences 
in social or economic status, allow the children, their teachers and the 
Board of Education to concentrate on shared pursuit of educational excellence 
[and] instill a sense of belonging and school pride".[121][122] The decision 
prompted a battle between the Board and parents upset at the manner in 
which the policy was imposed, the cost of the uniforms, the loss of freedom 
of expression to students in choosing the clothing they wear and issues 
regarding the manner in which the contract was awarded.[123] Private schools 
in Bayonne include All Saints Catholic Academy for grades PreK-8 and the 
co-ed Marist High School for grades 9-12, both of which operate under the 
supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[124][125] The 
Yeshiva Gedolah of Bayonne is a yeshiva high school / Bais Medrash / Kolel 
with 130 students.[126] Holy Family Academy for girls in ninth through 
twelfth grades was closed at the end of the 2012-13 school year in the 
wake of financial difficulties and declining enrollment, having lost the 
support of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia in 
2008.[127] The Bayonne Public Library,[128] one of New Jersey's original 
36 Carnegie libraries,[129] the Bayonne Community Museum,[130] the Bayonne 
Firefighters Museum,[131] and the Joyce-Herbert VFW Post 226 Veterans Museum[132] 
provide educational events and programs. As of May 2010[update], the city 
had a total of 76.55 miles (123.20 km) of roadways, of which 65.78 miles 
(105.86 km) were maintained by the city, 4.82 miles (7.76 km) are overseen 
by Hudson County, 4.04 miles (6.50 km) by the New Jersey Department of 
Transportation and 1.91 miles (3.07 km) are the responsibility of the New 
Jersey Turnpike Authority.[133] The Bayonne Bridge connects south to Staten 
Island over the Kill Van Kull. Kennedy Boulevard is a major thoroughfare 
along the west side of the city from the bridge north to Jersey City and 
North Hudson. The Newark Bay Extension (Interstate 78) of the New Jersey 
Turnpike northbound travels to Jersey City and, via the Holland Tunnel, 
Manhattan. Westbound, the Newark Bay Bridge provides access to Newark, 
Newark Liberty International Airport and the rest of the turnpike (Interstate 
95).[134] Route 440 runs along the east side of Bayonne, and the West Side 
of Jersey City, partially following the old Morris Canal route.[135] Although 
it has traffic lights it is usually the quickest route north-south within 
Bayonne. It connects to the Bayonne Bridge, I-78, and to Route 185 to Liberty 
State Park. Bus transportation is provided on three main north-south streets 
of the city: Broadway, Kennedy Boulevard, and Avenue C, both by the state-operated 
NJ Transit and several private bus lines.[136] The Broadway line runs solely 
inside Bayonne city limits, while bus lines on Avenue C and Kennedy Boulevard 
run to various end points in Jersey City. The NJ Transit 120 runs between 
Avenue C in Bayonne and Battery Park in Downtown Manhattan during rush 
hours in peak direction while the 81 provides service to New Jersey.[137] 
MTA Regional Bus Operations provides bus service between Bayonne and Staten 
Island on the S89 route, which connects the 34th Street light rail station 
and the Eltingville neighborhood on Staten Island with no stops in between. 
It is the first interstate bus service operated by the New York City Transit 
Authority.[138] The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has four stops in Bayonne, 
all originally from the former Central Railroad of New Jersey. They are 
located at 45th Street, 34th Street, 22nd Street, all just east of Avenue 
E, and 8th Street (the southern terminal of the 8th Street-Hoboken Line) 
at Avenue C, which opened in January 2011.[139] For 114 years, the Central 
Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) ran frequent service through the city. Trains 
ran north to the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal in Jersey City. 
Trains ran west to Elizabethport, Elizabeth, and Cranford for points west 
and south. The building of the Aldene Connection by-passed CNJ trains around 
Bayonne so that nearly all trains would either terminate at Newark Pennsylvania 
Station or at Hoboken Terminal. Until August 6, 1978, a shuttle service 
between Bayonne and Cranford retained the last leg of service with the 
CNJ trains.[140] See List of Registered Historic Places in Hudson County, 
New Jersey Bayonne is located within the New York media market, with most 
of its daily papers available for sale or delivery. Local, county, and 
regional news is covered by the daily Jersey Journal. The Bayonne Community 
News is part of The Hudson Reporter group of local weeklies. Other weeklies, 
the River View Observer and El Especialito also cover local news.[145] 
Bayonne-based periodicals include the Bayonne Evening Star-Telegram (B.E.S.T.). 
Bayonne's local culture is served by the Annual Outdoor Art Show, which 
was instituted in 2008, in which local artists display their works.[146] 
Jackie Gleason, a former headliner at the Hi-Hat Club in Bayonne, was fascinated 
by the city and mentioned it often in the television series The Honeymooners.[147] 
Films set in Bayonne include the 1991 film Mortal Thoughts, with Demi Moore 
and Bruce Willis, which was filmed near Horace Mann School and locations 
around Bayonne and Hoboken;[148] the 2000 drama Men of Honor, starring 
Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr.; the 2002 drama Hysterical Blindness; 
and the 2005 Tom Cruise science fiction film War of the Worlds, which opens 
at the Bayonne home of the lead character, and depicts the destruction 
of the Bayonne Bridge by aliens. Films shot in Bayonne include the 2001 
film A Beautiful Mind, scenes of which were filmed at the Peninsula at 
Bayonne Harbor,[149] and the 2008 Mickey Rourke drama The Wrestler, which 
was partially filmed in the Color & Cuts Salon and the former Dolphin Gym, 
both of which are on Broadway in Bayonne.[150][151] The November 16, 2010, 
episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart parodied former Alaska Governor

of a trailer for a fictional reality show called Jason Jones' Bayonne, 
New Jersey, whose portrayal of the city was characterized by prostitution,

Bayonne Mayor Mark Smith criticized the sketch, saying, "Jon Stewart's 
unfortunate and inaccurate depiction of Bayonne represents a lame attempt 
at humor at the expense of a rock solid, all-American community."[153] 
The comic strip Piranha Club (originally "Ernie"), drawn by Bud Grace, 
is set in and around Bayonne.[154] The ABC sci-fi comedy television series, 
The Neighbors, is about a family that moves from Bayonne into a fictional 
gated community, Hidden Hills, that is populated by aliens from another 
planet posing as humans.[155] The Best Show with Tom Scharpling records

Mike Lisk (a.k.a. AP Mike) being a Bayonne native, who tends bar at Massa's

Americans, Egyptian Americans, Dominican Americans, Mexican Americans, 
Salvadoran Americans, Pakistani Americans, Puerto Ricans, amongst others.
