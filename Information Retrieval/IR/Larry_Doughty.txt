Larry Doughty was the General Manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League 
Baseball team, from 1989 to 1991.[1] Doughty then became a scout for the 
Cincinnati Reds, becoming scouting supervisor and later Scouting Director 
for the Reds from 1983 to 1987. He joined the Pittsburgh Pirates as assistant 
general manager to Syd Thrift, along with Cincinnati associate Cam Bonifay 
as his head scout. Doughty replaced Thrift as General Manager of the Pirates 
on November 7, 1988 due to conflict between Thrift and the ownership group. 
The Pirates won division titles in Doughty's third and fourth years, with 
new additions Don Slaught, Zane Smith and Jay Bell. He was criticized,

error) and Mois√©s Alou (for Smith), hurting the farm system. In 1992, the 
club's new president, Mark Sauer, replaced Doughty with Ted Simmons. Doughty 
was a special assistant to the GM for the San Diego Padres in 1993. He 
was the farm director for the Kansas City Royals in 1996 and a VP for player 
personnel in 1998. In 1999-2000, Doughty was a special assistant to the
