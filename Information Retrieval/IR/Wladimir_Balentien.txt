Wladimir Ramon Balentien (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈvladimir balənˈtin]; born 
July 2, 1984) is a Curaçaoan-Dutch professional baseball outfielder with 
the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). He previously 
played in Major League Baseball for the Seattle Mariners and Cincinnati 
Reds. In 2013, he broke the NPB single-season home run record of 55, previously 
held by professional baseball's all-time home run leader Sadaharu Oh, American 
Tuffy Rhodes and Venezuelan Alex Cabrera.[1] Balentien would finish the 
season with 60 home runs. Balentien was signed as an undrafted free agent 
by the Mariners in 2000. He spent his first five professional seasons in 
the minor leagues, playing for the Arizona League Mariners, Wisconsin Timber 
Rattlers, Inland Empire 66ers, San Antonio Missions, and Tacoma Rainiers, 
before being called up in September 2007. In 2007, Balentien was selected 
to the All-Star Futures Game in San Francisco, a result of his .328 batting 
average, 20 home runs, and 66 runs batted in by that point. He was called 
up to the Mariners on September 4, 2007, and played that very night against 
the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Balentien pinch-hit for José Guillén 
in the 8th inning, and hit a two-run double in his first major league at-bat. 
Balentien was invited to spring training with the Mariners in 2008 and 
signed a one-year deal with the team. However, the starting job in right 
field went to Brad Wilkerson, and Balentien was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma 
on March 24. When Wilkerson and first baseman Greg Norton were designated 
for assignment on April 30, Wladimir and Rainiers teammate Jeff Clement 
were called up to the big leagues for a game in Cleveland against the Indians. 
Facing Indians starter Cliff Lee in the top of the 7th inning, Balentien 
hit a three-run homer over the right field fence to end Lee's streak of 
27 scoreless innings pitched. His homer was one of only 12 given up by 
Lee in 2008. On July 25, 2009, Balentien was designated for assignment 
by the Mariners after struggling to make consistent contact. He hit .213 
with 4 home runs and 13 RBIs in 155 at bats to that point in the season. 
Michael Saunders was called up to take his place on the big league roster. 
On July 29, 2009 the Mariners traded Balentien to the Cincinnati Reds for 
reliever Robert Manuel. In his final game with the Reds against Pittsburgh 
Pirates on October 2, Balentien hit the longest home run of that major 
league season, midway up the upper deck in left field with an estimated 
distance of 500 feet. On November 16, 2010, Balentien signed with the Tokyo 
Yakult Swallows in Japan.[2] On August 29, 2013, Balentien hit his 51st 
home run of the 2013 season.[3] With over a month of the regular season 
remaining at that date, many speculated that Balentien could break the 
Nippon Professional Baseball league season record.[4] The record of 55 
home runs in a single season was originally set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964 
and later tied by Tuffy Rhodes and Alex Cabrera. A "Coco Meter" was added 
to Tokyo Swallows homepage so that fans could track his progress through 
the remainder of the season.[5] On September 10, 2013, Balentien hit his 
55th home run.[6] He subsequently broke the record, hitting his 56th and 
57th home runs, on September 15, 2013 at home against the Hanshin Tigers.[7] 
Late in the 2013 season, it was revealed that NPB had secretly introduced 
a livelier baseball, resulting in a marked increase in home runs league-wide.[8] 
Three-term NPB commissioner Ryozo Kato was forced to resign over the scandal 
when the juiced baseball was revealed.[8] Balentien represented the Netherlands
