Steven Michael Stone (born July 14, 1947) is an American former Major League 
Baseball (MLB) player, and current sportscaster and author. Stone pitched 
for four MLB teams between 1971 and 1981. In 1980, he was the AL Cy Young 
Award winner, and an American League All Star, finishing the season with 
a record of 25–7. He was WGN-TV's color commentator for Chicago Cubs broadcasts 
between 1983 and 2004, missing a couple of seasons late in his tenure due 
to health problems. He worked in radio until 2009, when he became the color 
commentator for Chicago White Sox television broadcasts. Stone is Jewish, 
and was born in South Euclid, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb.[1] Stone played 
high school ball at Charles F. Brush High School for baseball Coach Jim 
Humpall. Growing up he also won several tennis championships, was a ping 
pong champion, and a proficient golfer. At Kent State University, Stone 
was an outstanding pitcher and his catcher was Thurman Munson. He was selected 
to the All Mid-American Conference team, and was named team captain as 
a junior.[1] He had a 2.00 ERA in the Cape Cod League in 1968. He also 
starred on the bowling and volleyball teams. He became a Brother in Alpha 
Epsilon Pi[2] Fraternity. He graduated in 1970 with a teaching degree in 
history and government.[3] In 1968 he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians 
in the 16th round of the draft, but did not sign. In February 1969 he was 
drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the fourth round of the draft (secondary 
phase). From 1969–71 Stone pitched in the minor leagues, compiling a 32–24 
record and striking out nearly a batter an inning.[4] Breaking the stereotype 
of ballplayers in his era, Stone said: Charlie Fox (manager of the Giants 
in 1971) felt the only way a ballplayer could perform was to chew tobacco, 
wear a sloppy uniform and, as he put it, not be afraid to get a bloody 
nose, and eat, drink and sleep baseball. I never thought a bloody nose 
was all that comfortable, and tobacco upsets my stomach. I like to eat 
– but not baseball – and I never thought sleeping with the game would be 
all that enjoyable. I think he thought reading hurt your eyes.[5] In November 
1972, after suffering a sore arm, Stone was traded by the Giants with Ken 
Henderson to the Chicago White Sox for Tom Bradley. In 1973 he was fourth 
in the AL in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (7.04), and 8th in hit batsmen 
(7). In December 1973 he was traded by the White Sox with Jim Kremmel, 
Ken Frailing, and Steve Swisher to the Chicago Cubs for Ron Santo. In 1975 
he was 12–8 and pitched 214.3 innings. In November 1976, after suffering 
a torn rotator cuff and undertaking cryotherapy after refusing surgery 
and cortisone injections, he signed as a free agent with the Chicago White 
Sox for $60,000 ($317,000 today), turning down offers from 4 other teams. 
In 1977 he was 15–12. During that year on August 29 Stone gave up a home 
run to Cleveland Indians second baseman Duane Kuiper – Kuiper's only career 
home run in 3,379 at bats. In November 1978, he signed a 4-year, $760,000 
($2,762,000 today) deal as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles, again 
turning down four other offers. In 1979 Stone was 11–7, and was 7th in 
the league in fewest hits allowed per 9 innings pitched (8.37). His best 
year was 1980, when he went 25–7 for the Orioles, won the Cy Young Award 
and The Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award, and came in 9th in the 
AL MVP voting. Stone's relief pitchers did not blow a save for him all 
season until his last start of the year. He led the league in wins and 
won-lost percentage (.781), and was second in games started (37), seventh 
in ERA (3.23), strikeouts (149), hits allowed/9 IP (8.04), and hit batsmen 
(6), and ninth in innings (250.7). He also pitched three perfect innings 
in the All-Star Game that year. "I knew it would ruin my arm. But one year 
of 25–7 is worth five of 15–15." Stone threw as many as 73 curveballs in 
a game at least twice that season, even though he knew he might damage 
his pitching arm.[6] "I used to try not to lose before", Stone said in 
1980. "Now, when I go out, I go out to win every time, and I'm certain 
I am. I try to envision myself literally walking off the mound a winner. 
I allow no negatives in my thinking. When certain ones start creeping in, 
I erase them and make it like a blank blackboard waiting to be filled in 
with things like, 'The team is going to play well, is going to score some 
runs, I'm going to throw strikes, I'm going to win.' "[7] Stone suffered 
from tendinitis in 1981, going 4–7 with a 4.60 ERA, and retired at age 
34.[8] He is considered one of the best Jewish pitchers in major league 
history.[1][9][10][11] Through July 2011, Stone was third among Jewish 
pitchers in career wins (107) and strikeouts (1,065), behind Ken Holtzman 
and Sandy Koufax and directly ahead of Jason Marquis, and ninth in games 
pitched (320), behind Barry Latman.[12] Reminiscing about Sandy Koufax's 
influence on him and others when he was a child, he said, "He gave little 
Jewish boys some hope."[13] In 1983, Stone became a color commentator for 
the WGN television broadcasts of the Chicago Cubs, teaming for 14 years 
with Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray. After Harry Caray's death in February 
1998, Stone was paired with Caray's grandson Chip Caray. Stone left the 
booth due to health reasons in 2000, including a case of coccidioidomycosis,[14] 
and returned to the Cubs booth in 2003 and 2004. Stone refused a contract 
extension as the Cubs color-man after the 2004 season amid a controversy 
involving Cubs players who felt he was being overly critical of their performance. 
Even so, he was a fan favorite. This was apparent at the Cubs' last home 
game of 2004, when, after the game had ended and all the players had left 
the field, nearly everyone left in the stadium looked up to the broadcast 
booth and chanted "Stoney! Stoney!" for several minutes. One reason he 
was so well-liked was his ability to accurately predict what might happen 
in various game situations, explaining to the audience why the strategy 
or pitch would be successful prior to the play. A famous example of this 
was him expressing "I wouldn't pitch to this guy" in a 2004 game, seconds 
before the batter (Adam Dunn) hit a home run off Cubs pitcher Mike Remlinger 
to give the Reds the lead. Stone expressed frustration with Cubs manager 
Dusty Baker for not controlling his players. At one point during the 2004 
season, Kent Mercker called the broadcast booth from the bullpen during 
a game to complain about comments made, also confronting Stone in a hotel 
lobby.[15] Among the comments that reportedly irked Mercker were Chip Caray's 
praise of Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt. It was also reported that 
Mercker and left fielder Moisés Alou shouted at Stone on a team charter 
plane to a road game in 2004, and that Alou tried to have Stone and Caray 
banned from the team charter flights.[16] On September 30, 2004, in the 
wake of a 12-inning loss to the Cincinnati Reds that all but eliminated 
the Cubs, Stone strongly criticized the team. "The truth of this situation 
is [this is] an extremely talented bunch of guys who want to look at all 
directions except where they should really look, and kind of make excuses 
for what happened...This team should have won the wild-card [playoff berth] 
by six, seven games. No doubt about it."[17] The comments stunned manager 
Baker, and were a factor in Stone's resignation as a Cub broadcaster the 
following month.[18] In early 2005 Stone was hired by Chicago radio station 
WSCR to provide commentary and host a weekly talk show, hosted on Mondays 
by Terry Boers and Dan Bernstein, on Tuesdays by Mike North, and on Thursdays 
by Brian Hanley and Mike Mulligan.[19] He was also hired by ESPN to work 
some of that network's baseball telecasts. In early August 2007, Stone 
filled in for Chicago White Sox color commentator Darrin Jackson, while 
Jackson took leave for the birth of his child, during which he successfully 
predicted a walk-off home run by Juan Uribe in extra innings.[20] In October 
2007, Stone called postseason games for TBS, partnered with play-by-play 
announcer Ted Robinson. On March 4, 2008, Stone was named the color commentator 
for White Sox radio broadcasts for the 2008 season on WSCR AM670 The Score, 
replacing Chris Singleton, who moved to ESPN's Baseball Tonight. On September 
13, 2008, Stone accepted the job as the color commentator for the White 
Sox television broadcasts for six years beginning with the 2009 season. 
He said he enjoys being in the booth with Hawk Harrelson, stating that 
he likes his nickname "Stone Pony." Stone also acts as a fill-in play-by-play 
announcer when Harrelson isn't available. In 1999, Stone, along with Barry 
Rozner of the Chicago suburban area Daily Herald, authored Where's Harry?,
