George Albert Hildebrand (September 6, 1878 â€“ May 30, 1960) was an American 
left fielder and umpire in Major League Baseball who played 11 games for 
the 1902 Brooklyn Superbas and later umpired in the American League from 
1913 to 1934. He is often credited as having invented the spitball while 
playing in the minor leagues. He was the umpire in four World Series (1914, 
1918, 1922, 1926), and his 3,331 games as an umpire ranked third in AL 
history when he retired. Born in San Francisco, California, Hildebrand 
began his playing career in 1898. He was playing for Providence in the 
Eastern League in the spring of 1902 when he discovered the effect moisture 
had on a pitched ball; he encouraged pitchers Frank Corridon and Elmer 
Stricklett to try the technique, and Stricklett was believed to be the 
first to use the pitch in a major league game in 1904.[1] Hildebrand worked 
much of his umpiring career in a team with Brick Owens. His most controversial 
decision came in Game 2 of the 1922 World Series, when he ended the game 
on account of darkness after 10 innings with the score tied 3-3, even though 
it did not begin to get dark until a half-hour later; it was widely believed 
that the game could have continued for a few more innings. It was later 
reported that third base umpire Bill Klem had expressed to Hildebrand his 
concern about a long game, recalling Game 2 of the 1914 Series, which had 
ended in almost complete darkness after 14 innings. There was such heavy 
criticism of Hildebrand's decision to end the game that commissioner Kenesaw 
Mountain Landis ordered the game proceeds ($120,000) to be donated to charity.[1] 
Hildebrand was behind the plate on June 21, 1916, when Rube Foster of the 
Boston Red Sox pitched a 2-0 no-hitter against the New York Yankees.[2] 
He was also behind the plate on July 10, 1932 when Johnny Burnett of the 
Cleveland Indians collected a record nine hits in an 18-inning game against 
the Philadelphia Athletics.[3] After retiring from baseball, Hildebrand 
ran a hotel in Brawley, California, and then went into business in Los 
Angeles. He died of heart failure at age 81 at Reseda Hospital in Reseda, 
California, and was survived by his wife Sue and son Albert. He was buried
