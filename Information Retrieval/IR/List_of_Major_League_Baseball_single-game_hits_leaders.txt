This is a list of Major League Baseball players with at least six hits 
in one game. Among the most phenomenal accomplishments of the six-hit performances 
are the following: Larry Twitchell, Sam Thompson and Ian Kinsler each hit 
for the cycle. Shawn Green's six hit game set the Major League record for 
total bases (19) and tied the single-game Major League records for home 
runs (4) and runs scored (6), and extra-base hits (5).[1][2] Twitchell's 
six hit game also featured five extra-base hits. Guy Hecker had six hits 
in a game for which he was a pitcher, a unique feat in professional baseball 
history.[2] Hecker also scored seven runs in his six-hit game, setting 
a professional baseball mark that still stands.[2] Wilbert Robinson and 
Rennie Stennett each recorded seven hits in a nine-inning game. Cal McVey 
had two 6-hit games three days apart.[3] Johnny Burnett holds the record 
with nine hits in a game (18 innings, 11 at-bats).[4] The record for hits 
in a postseason game is five.[2] Far more of the six-hit games have been 
nine-inning affairs than have been extra inning games. However, three of

six-hit games involved 8 at bats, but a dozen extra inning six-hit games 
have entailed at least 8 at bats. Source:[3] As of July 2016[update], there 
were 19 American League players and 25 National League players to have 
recorded at least 6 hits in an extra inning game. Only one National Leaguer 
(Crawford) had more than six hits. Johnny Burnett holds the record with
