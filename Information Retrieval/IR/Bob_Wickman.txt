Robert Joe Wickman (born February 6, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. Wickman played for the New York Yankees (1992–1996), Milwaukee 
Brewers (1996–2000), Cleveland Indians (2000–2006), Atlanta Braves (2006–2007), 
and Arizona Diamondbacks (2007). He batted and threw right-handed. Wickman 
was known to rely on his sinker to save games. During a childhood farming 
accident, Wickman lost part of his index finger on his right hand, to which 
he credited much of the sinking motion on his sinker..[1] At Oconto Falls 
High School, Wickman played football, baseball and basketball, swimming, 
horseback riding, tennis, and table tennis, being named an All-State pick 
in basketball. After high school, he attended University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, 
and was selected by the Chicago White Sox in the 1990 Major League Baseball 
draft (2nd round) and signed by area scout Mike Rizzo.[citation needed] 
In 1992, he was sent by Chicago to the New York Yankees in the same trade 
that brought Steve Sax to the White Sox. Wickman's career with the Yankees 
began with a superb record of 20-5 in his first two seasons (1992–1993), 
including a 14-4 mark in 1993. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, Wickman 
appeared in an American League-high 53 games, all in relief, and posted 
a 3.09 ERA for the league-leading Yankees. Though he slumped to a 4.05 
ERA in 1995, he rebounded to pitch three shutout innings in the Division 
Series against the Seattle Mariners. The Yankees lost that series in five 
games to Seattle. In 1996, the Yankees traded Wickman to the Brewers before 
they won the World Series. After the Yankees won the World Series, they 
gave Wickman a World Series ring for being part of the active roster during 
the 1996 season. Wickman made his first All-Star Game appearance in 2000 
as a member of the Milwaukee Brewers. He was involved in a seven-player 
trade between the Brewers and Cleveland Indians, which would include sending 
Richie Sexson to Milwaukee.[2] On May 7, 2006, Wickman became the Indians' 
all-time franchise leader in saved games with 130, surpassing the record 
previously held by Doug Jones.[3] His 139 saves with the Indians is a club 
record, and his 45 saves on the season in 2005 is tied for second-best 
in team history.[4] On July 20, 2006, Wickman was traded to the Atlanta 
Braves for Single-A Rome catcher Max Ramírez. Wickman then served as Atlanta's 
closer, recording his first save on July 24. On September 20, 2006, Wickman 
signed a one-year $6.5 million contract extension to stay with the Atlanta 
Braves for the 2007 season.[5] On August 24, 2007, after giving up a walk-off 
two run home run to the Reds' Adam Dunn in extra innings, Wickman complained 
to manager Bobby Cox about pitching in non-save situations. Consequently, 
he was released.[6] On September 7, 2007, Wickman signed a contract with 
the Arizona Diamondbacks, a move that signaled that he had backed off his 
disdain for non-save situations, given that the team had an established 
closer in José Valverde.[citation needed] Wickman pitched in 8 games for 
the Diamondbacks, going 0-1 with a 1.35 ERA. He became a free agent after 
the season, subsequently retiring. Wickman ended his career with 511 games
