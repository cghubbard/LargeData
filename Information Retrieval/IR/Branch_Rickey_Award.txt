The Branch Rickey Award is given annually to an individual in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) in recognition of his exceptional community service. The 
award is named in honor of former player and executive Branch Rickey, who 
broke the major league color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson, while 
president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Rickey also created 
the Knothole Gang, a charity that allowed children to attend MLB games.[1] 
The award, created by the Rotary Club of Denver in 1991, was first awarded 
to Dave Winfield in 1992 at their annual banquet.[1][2] Each MLB team nominates 
one individual who best exemplifies the Rotary Club motto: "service above 
self".[3][4] A vote is then conducted by the national selection committee, 
which consists of members of the sports media, previous winners of the 
award, and Rotary district governors in major league cities.[5] Proceeds 
of the banquet benefit Denver Kids, Inc., a charity for at-risk students 
who attend Denver Public Schools.[1] Each winner receives a bronze sculpture 
of a baseball player measuring 24 inches (610 mm), named "The Player", 
designed by sculptor George Lundeen. A larger version of "The Player", 
standing 13 feet (4.0 m) tall, was erected at Coors Field in Denver.[2] 
Winners of the Branch Rickey Award have undertaken different causes. Many 
winners, including Todd Stottlemyre,[6] Jamie Moyer,[7] John Smoltz,[8] 
Torii Hunter,[9] Vernon Wells,[10] and Shane Victorino,[11] worked with 
children in need. Stottlemyre visited and raised money for a nine-year-old 
girl who suffered from aplastic anemia and required a bone marrow transplant,[6] 
while Moyer's foundation raised US$6 million to support underprivileged 
children.[7] Other winners devoted their work to aiding individuals who 
had a specific illness, such as Curt Schilling, who raised money for amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis,[12] and Trevor Hoffman, who lost a kidney as an infant 
and devoted himself to working with individuals with nephropathy.[2] Also, 
some winners devoted themselves to work with major disasters and tragedies. 
Bobby Valentine donated money to charities benefiting victims of the September 
11 attacks,[13] while Luis Gonzalez worked with survivors of Hurricane
