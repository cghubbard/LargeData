Alejandro "Alex" Pompez (May 3, 1890 – March 14, 1974) was an American 
executive in Negro league baseball who owned the Cuban Stars (East) and 
New York Cubans franchises from 1916 to 1950. His family had immigrated 
from Cuba, where his father was a lawyer. Outside of baseball and numbers, 
he had owned and operated a cigar shop in downtown Manhattan. He later 
served as a scout and director of international scouting for the Giants 
franchise in Major League Baseball. He was posthumously inducted into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Pompez was born on May 3, 1890 in Key West, 
Florida, the oldest of four children born to Cuban immigrants Jose and 
Loretta Pompez. His father was a lawyer and cigar manufacturer who had 
connections to Cuban author and dissident Jose Marti. Jose Pompez was on 
the board of directors for the Key West chapter of the Cuban Revolutionary 
Party;[1] he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives as a Republican 
in 1892.[2] He was a state representative until his death until 1897. Alex 
and his family struggled financially after his father willed his estate 
to the insurgency.[3] Alex Pompez owned the Cuban Stars of the Eastern 
Colored League between 1923 and 1928 and the New York Cubans of the Negro 
National League from 1935 to 1951. He also helped organize the first Negro 
League World Series in 1924.[4] He signed numerous Latin American players 
for his Negro league teams, including Martín Dihigo, Minnie Miñoso and 
Alejandro Oms. Several owners in the Negro National League, including Pompez, 
were numbers bankers.[5] Pompez was one of New York's leading numbers bankers 
during the 1920s but was forced to join Dutch Schultz in 1932. His connections 
with Schultz's organization led to his indictment in 1936 for involvement 
in policy rackets when New York County District Attorney Thomas Dewey selected 
him as one of the targets in a crackdown on New York City racketeering. 
Pompez fled to Mexico after being tipped off to his arrest; he was eventually 
arrested by Mexican authorities, but Mexican officials refused to extradite 
him. Pompez decided to return to the U.S. as a state witness in the investigation. 
He is considered the only man who survived after turning informant against 
another racketeer.[6] In 1948, sensing that baseball's integration would 
change the Negro leagues, Pompez arranged for the New York Cubans to become 
a minor league affiliate of the New York Giants.[4] Pompez scouted Latin 
America for the Giants, and they signed several players through Pompez, 
including Camilo Pascual, Tony Oliva and Orlando Cepeda. In 1950, Pompez 
submitted a favorable scouting report to the Giants on Fidel Castro.[7] 
He was hired by the New York Giants to oversee their Latin American operations 
in 1950. [8] Pompez served on the Baseball Hall of Fame's special Committee 
on Negro League Baseball in the early 1970s. He died at age 83 in New York 
City. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. Pompez died in 1974 and
