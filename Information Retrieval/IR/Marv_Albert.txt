Marv Albert (born Marvin Philip Aufrichtig; June 12, 1941) is an American 
sportscaster. Honored for his work as a member of the Basketball Hall of 
Fame, he is commonly referred to as "the voice of basketball". From 1967 
to 2004, he was also known as "the voice of the New York Knicks". Albert 
currently works for Turner Sports, serving as lead announcer for NBA games 
on TNT. In addition to calling both professional and college basketball, 
he has experience announcing other sports such as American football, ice 
hockey, horse racing, boxing, and tennis. Albert has called the play-by-play 
of six Super Bowls, NBA Finals, and seven Stanley Cup Finals. He has also 
called the Wimbledon Tennis Championships for TNT with Jim Courier and 
Mary Carillo. He also worked as a co-host and reporter for two World Series 
(1986 and 1988). Albert was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, where 
he went to Abraham Lincoln High School.[2] While Albert grew up, members 
of his family owned a grocery store on Brighton Beach Avenue between 3rd 
and 4th streets known as Aufrichtig's. He then attended Syracuse University's 
Newhouse School of Public Communications from 1960 through 1963. In 1962, 
he served as the voice of the AAA Syracuse Chiefs. He then graduated from 
New York University in 1965.[3] For 37 years beginning in 1967, Albert 
was the voice of the New York Knicks on radio and television (getting his 
start by being a ball boy for the Knicks before getting his first break 
on New York radio by sportscaster Marty Glickman) before being let go by 
James L. Dolan, the chairman of the MSG Network and Cablevision, after 
Albert criticized the Knicks' poor play on-air in 2004. His son Kenny Albert 
has been a part-time play-by-play announcer for the Knicks since 2009, 
whenever the older Albert's successor Mike Breen (whom he later followed 
on the NBA on NBC broadcasts and now works on ESPN and ABC aside from his 
role at MSG) is unavailable. For a brief period before he resumed his normal 
broadcasting duties following his sexual assault arrest (see below), Albert 
anchored MSG's former nightly sports news report, MSG SportsDesk. Marv 
Albert was the lead play-by-play broadcaster for the NBA on NBC for most 
of its run from 1990 to 2002, calling every NBA Finals during that timeframe 
except for 1998, 1999, and 2000. During this time, Bob Costas had taken 
over the lead job and called the Finals after Marv's arrest for sexual 
assault had brought him national disgrace. Marv resumed his previous position 
for the 2000–2001 season and called Game 4 of the 2002 NBA Finals which 
was the final NBA telecast on NBC. During his time on NBC, Albert continued 
as lead play-by-play man for the New York Knicks on local MSG Network telecasts 
and began calling national games for TNT in 1999 as well. When he regained 
the lead broadcaster position on NBC, he continued to call play-by-play 
for both networks until the end of NBC's coverage in 2002. Albert continues 
to be the lead play-by-play announcer for National Basketball Association 
games on TNT, a position he assumed in 1999. Indeed, TNT has become his 
primary commitment ever since his longtime employer NBC lost the NBA broadcasting 
rights in 2002, and may have played a role in his departure from the Knicks' 
broadcast booth[citation needed]. The Knicks reportedly wanted Albert to 
accept a salary commensurate with his reduced Knicks schedule, but also 
weren't happy about Albert making what Knicks management felt were overly 
critical comments about their team in spite of their losing record. In 
basketball, his most famous call is his simple "Yes!" for a basket, rendered 
in many variations of volume and length depending on the situation; and 
a catchphrase that he began using in his youth when playing pickup games 
with friends. On April 17, 2002, shortly after calling a game between the 
Indiana Pacers and Philadelphia 76ers on TNT, both Albert and color analyst 
Mike Fratello were injured in a limo accident in Trenton, New Jersey. Albert 
sustained facial lacerations, a concussion, and a sprained ankle. The 2002 
NBA Playoffs were scheduled to begin two days later, with Albert scheduled 
to call multiple games that week. Bob Costas filled in those games, and 
Albert returned to call Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals between 
the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings. In 2005, Albert officially became 
the lead play-by-play man for the New Jersey Nets franchise and started 
calling their games on the YES Network, often teaming with Brooklyn native 
and NBA veteran, Mark Jackson. With that, the Nets employed all three Albert 
brothers during the franchise's history; Al started his broadcast career 
with the Nets during their ABA days, while Steve called Nets games during 
the late 1970s and 1980s. Beginning with the 2008–09 season, Albert was 
also paired with his TNT broadcast colleague Mike Fratello on the YES Network. 
However, with the Nets' struggles in the 2009–10 season, Nets management 
relegated Albert to secondary play-by-play, to avoid a similar incident 
while Albert was with the Knicks. Since then Ian Eagle has taken over the 
broadcasts. In 2011, Albert left the YES Network to join CBS Sports for 
NFL and NCAA tournament coverage. Albert hosts a basketball-focused interview 
show on NBA TV, which also airs later on YES. Since 2003, Albert has also 
been providing the play-by-play voice on the NBA Live video-game series 
on EA Sports, a role he fulfilled until NBA Live 10. From 2011 to 2015, 
Albert announced NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament 
games, the result of longtime tournament broadcaster CBS handing off some 
of its coverage to Turner Sports. In February 2016, Albert and Turner Sports 
announced that he would no longer call NCAA Tournament basketball games, 
stating that calling four games in one day during the first round, and 
a total of six matches in three days during the first two rounds, was now 
too much for his 74-year-old voice to handle. Albert said that he "felt 
it was the wiser move to go primarily NBA at this stage".[4] From 1973 
to 1976 Albert called radio broadcasts of New York Giants football games, 
succeeding Marty Glickman after the latter's defection to the New York 
Jets. In addition to the Knicks, Albert had a lengthy tenure (beginning 
in 1965) calling the games of another Madison Square Garden tenant, the 
New York Rangers. He handled the radio call of the Rangers' Stanley Cup–clinching 
victory in 1994. He also famously coined the phrase "Red Light" for radio 
analyst Sal Messina, a former Rangers goaltender. His signature play-by-play 
phrase was "kick save and a beauty." Over his years as the Rangers broadcaster, 
Albert would miss a large number of games for other commitments. Many other 
broadcasters filled in, including several who would serve long stints for 
other NHL teams, including Howie Rose, Mike Emrick and John Kelly, as well 
as brothers Al and Steve. It was Albert's absence from Game 7 of the Rangers–Devils 
Conference Championship game that led to Rose's famed Matteau, Matteau, 
Matteau call. Albert left the Rangers after the 1994–95 season at the same 
time Rose took the job as play-by-play announcer of the New York Islanders. 
Albert's son, Kenny, replaced him, and has been the radio voice of the 
Rangers ever since. Kenny also announces part-time for the NBC Sports Network, 
mostly during Stanley Cup playoff games not involving the Rangers. Albert 
was also the lead play-by-play voice of the Westwood One radio network's 
NFL coverage for several years, calling Monday Night Football as well as 
numerous playoff games and every Super Bowl beginning 2002. On June 4, 
2010, it was announced that Albert would not be continuing his NFL on Westwood 
One duties beyond the 2009 season.[5] On June 6, 2011, it was announced 
that Albert was joining CBS Sports to call play-by-play for The NFL on 
CBS.[6] Albert was usually teamed with Rich Gannon on broadcasts. On May 
29, 2014, it was announced that Albert would step down from calling The 
NFL on CBS and focus on basketball duties for TNT and CBS.[7] Other NBC 
Sports duties that Albert held were play-by-play announcing for the NFL, 
college basketball, horse racing, boxing,[8] NHL All-Star Games, and Major 
League Baseball, as well as hosting baseball studio and pre-game shows. 
He also spent 13 years as the sports director of the network's flagship 
station, WNBC-TV in New York. Albert also called regular-season and playoff 
NHL games for the syndicated NHL Network in the 1976–77 season, and from 
2000 to 2002 he helped call TNT's coverage of the Wimbledon Championships 
tennis tournament. Albert made 126[9] guest appearances on David Letterman's 
late night talk shows for NBC and CBS. Each time Albert appeared, he brought 
with him a group of clips featuring sports bloopers and outstanding plays, 
which he narrated and dubbed the "Albert Achievement Awards". The music 
accompanying the bloopers was "12th Street Rag". Albert was placed as number 
14 on David J. Halberstam's list of Top 50 All Time Network Television 
Sports Announcers on Yahoo! Sports. In 1992, he appeared as himself on 
Roger Waters' rock album Amused to Death, giving a mock commentary on the 
destruction of an oil rig on the song "Perfect Sense, Part II". An "Albert 
Achievement Awards" video was released in 1993. It featured cameos by Mike 
Fratello, Ahmad Rashad, Charles Barkley, David Letterman, O.J. Simpson, 
Bob Costas, and Tom Brokaw. Albert became the first guest commentator in 
MTV's Celebrity Death Match cartoon series. He appeared in the 1998 pilot 
episode before being replaced with Stacey Cornbred. Albert was briefly 
mentioned in the 2006 film Grandma's Boy. Albert also appeared as a special 
guest on The Simpsons, in the Season 20 episode "The Burns and the Bees" 
in 2008. Albert's voice is imitated in the popular video game NBA Jam. 
The announcer was modeled on Albert although there is no mention of Albert 
in the game and was actually voiced by Tim Kitzrow.[10] Albert did play-by-play 
commentary in the video game NFL Quarterback Club '98. In the 1999 episode 
"Tube Steaks" of the CBS sitcom The King of Queens, Doug and his friends 
watch a Knicks-game with Albert's voice commentary. He authored (with Rick 
Reilly) an autobiography, I'd Love to But I Have a Game, in 1993. Albert 
appears in a short scene in the 2015 comedy film Trainwreck.[11] Albert's 
son, Kenny, is also a sports commentator, who calls baseball and football 
for Fox, New York Rangers games on the radio, and has been one of NBC's 
commentators for ice hockey at the Winter Olympics, as well as NBC's NHL 
coverage. His daughter, Denise, is a reporter for NBA TV. Marv has two 
younger brothers who also are announcers. Steve Albert is currently the 
Phoenix Suns play-by-play announcer, and has also called play-by-play for 
several other teams, including the New Orleans Hornets, New Jersey Nets, 
New York Islanders, New York Mets, and Golden State Warriors. Steve is 
best known for his work on Showtime Championship Boxing, notably the Holyfield–Tyson 
bouts. Al Albert was the former play-by-play announcer for USA Tuesday 
Night Fights, the Indiana Pacers and the Denver Nuggets. Al also called 
national NBA games on the USA Network during its brief tenure in the early 
1980s. Albert became the focus of a media frenzy in 1997 when he went on 
trial for felony charges of forcible sodomy.[18] A 42-year-old woman named 
Vanessa Perhach[19] accused Albert of throwing her on a bed, biting her, 
and forcing her to perform oral sex after a February 12, 1997 argument 
in his Pentagon City hotel room. DNA testing linked Albert to genetic material 
taken from the bite marks and from semen in Perhach's underwear.[20] During 
the trial, testimony was presented from another woman, Patricia Masden, 
who told the jury that Albert had bitten her on two different occasions 
in 1993 and 1994 in Miami and Dallas hotels, which she viewed as unwanted 
sexual advances.[21] Masden claimed that in Dallas, Albert called her to 
his hotel room to help him send a fax, only for her to find him wearing 
"white panties and garter belt".[22] Albert maintained that Perhach had 
requested that he bite her and denied her accusation that he'd asked her 
to bring another man into their sexual affair. He described the recorded 
conversation of hers with the police on the night of the incident "an Academy 
Award performance".[19] After tests proved that the bite marks were his, 
he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and battery charges, while the 
sodomy charge was dropped.[18][23] Albert was given a 12-month suspended 
sentence.[24][25] Consequently, NBC – for which Albert worked for over 
20 years – fired him shortly before the 1997–98 NBA season began on The 
NBA on NBC. Bob Costas took over for Albert on the basketball side in the 
1997–98 season before stepping down after the 2000 NBA Finals for Albert's 
return. In addition, Tom Hammond spelled his football duties. It is also 
revealed on a Simpsons DVD commentary that he was to appear in the episode 
"Bart Star" but, due to the scandal, was replaced by Roy Firestone. NBC 
brought Albert back less than two years later, and he was the network's 
main play-by-play man for the 2000–01 and 2001–02 NBA seasons, including 
the Finals. NBC lost the rights to the NBA to ABC following the 2001–02
