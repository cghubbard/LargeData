The 2006 Baltimore Orioles season involved the Orioles finishing 4th in 
the American League East with a record of 70 wins and 92 losses. Following 
the disappointing 2005 season, it was clear major changes needed to be 
made within the Orioles. In the front office, Executive VP Jim Beattie 
was not re-signed, allowing Mike Flanagan to become the sole GM of the 
Orioles. Shortly after, Jim Duquette was hired as Vice President of Baseball 
Operations, which was Flanagan's previous position. Duquette made it clear 
at his signing that he reported to Flanagan, so the "two-headed GM" did 
not exist anymore. The Orioles also fired Assistant General Manager Ed 
Kenney and asked for the resignation of Dave Ritterpusch, Director of Baseball 
Information Systems. There were also drastic changes in the Orioles coaching 
staff. Perlozzo was named the new manager, and unlike Mazzilli, was given 
full freedom to name his coaching staff. Sam Perlozzo led off strong by 
convincing Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone, who had revolutionized the 
careers of many pitchers in Atlanta, to become the pitching coach for the 
Orioles. He retained hitting coach Terry Crowley and first base coach Dave 
Cash. Former base coach and 1983 World Series MVP Rick Dempsey replaced 
Elrod Hendricks as the bullpen coach, with Tom Trebelhorn resuming third 
base coach. Perlozzo rounded out his staff with former Cubs and Phillies 
manager Lee Elia as the bench coach. The roster changes of 2005 were prefaced 
with Peter Angelos' comments: "We are coming back strong next year. I know 
you have heard that tune before, but this time it will literally come true." 
The Orioles allowed Rafael Palmeiro, Sammy Sosa, and B.J. Surhoff to become 
free agents. They also set their wishlist: An everyday first baseman, an 
experienced starter, a closer, a defensive catcher, outfield help, more 
defense, and more speed. However, their offseason moves showed no differences 
from past years. The Orioles were not able to re-sign closer B. J. Ryan, 
who signed a landmark deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. They were also locked 
out in bids to sign first baseman Paul Konerko, outfielder Johnny Damon, 
and starter Paul Byrd. The Orioles chose not to enter the bidding for players 
like A. J. Burnett and Kevin Millwood, whose asking prices were far beyond 
what the Orioles were willing to pay, but they did sign catcher Ramón Hernández. 
Locked out of pursuits to sign top-tier players, the Orioles decided to 
make several moves to allow minor league prospects more time to develop. 
This led to bringing in players like Jeff Conine and Kevin Millar, both 
of whom are known for their positive presence in the clubhouse. On February 
4, 2006, Ricky Bottalico was signed as a Free Agent with the Baltimore 
Orioles.[1] The Orioles also made several trades to bring in needed players. 
They first traded disgruntled reliever Steve Kline for LaTroy Hawkins, 
then traded for outfielder Corey Patterson, who brought speed and defense 
to the outfield, and traded former closer Jorge Julio and John Maine for 
experienced starter Kris Benson.[2] The Orioles also addressed future free 
agents by extending the contract of outfielder Jay Gibbons and third baseman 
Melvin Mora, and recently signed a contract extension with second baseman 
Brian Roberts. The team's Opening Day roster featured top prospect Nick 
Markakis, a potential A.L. "Rookie of the Year", the best young position 
player the Orioles' farm system has produced since Brian Roberts. Markakis 
represents the revival of the Orioles' farm system, which features four 
players listed in Baseball America's 2006 list of the top 100 prospects 
in minor league baseball. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]

and Orioles played each other in Washington on March 31 and in Baltimore 
on April 1. The first match up of the Beltway Series rivalry took place 
on May 19, 2006 during the 2006 regular season, the Orioles won at RFK 
Stadium. This marked first time in 35 years that the Orioles played a regular-season 
game in Washington, as they played the Washington Senators, another team 
in the American League annually from 1954 to 1960. The Orioles continued 
that rivalry with the new Washington Senators from 1961 to 1971. The two 
teams split the season series 3-3 with each time winning two games at home 
and one on the road. Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At Bats;
