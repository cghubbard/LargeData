Gustavus Heinrich Schmelz (September 26, 1850 – October 14, 1925) was an 
American manager in Major League Baseball for the Columbus Buckeyes (1884), 
Cincinnati Red Stockings (1887–89), and Columbus Solons (1890–91) of the 
American Association, and for the St. Louis Maroons (1886), Cleveland Spiders 
(1890) and Washington Senators (1894–97) of the National League. He was 
regarded as a player's manager, but his camaraderie with his players did 
not translate to pennants, as he never finished higher than second place. 
His lifetime managerial record was 624–703 (.470). He died in his birthplace
