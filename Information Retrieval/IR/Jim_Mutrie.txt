James J. Mutrie (June 13, 1851 â€“ January 24, 1938) was an American baseball 
pioneer who was the co-founder and first manager of both the original New 
York Metropolitans and the New York Giants. His career winning percentage 
of .611 was a 19th-century record, and remains the second highest by any 
major league manager with at least 500 wins, trailing only Joe McCarthy's 
mark of .615. Mutrie, nicknamed "Smilin' Jeems" and "Truthful Jim", was 
born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and grew up playing cricket, first playing 
baseball at age 16. He played in the minor leagues from 1877 to 1879.[1] 
In 1880 he moved from New England to New York, where he obtained financial 
backing from August Belmont and John B. Day to start the independent New 
York Metropolitans. At the end of the 1882 season, Day and Mutrie accepted 
offers from both the American Association and the National League to enter 
a New York team; they met their double commitment by entering the Mets 
in the American Association, and acquiring most of the players from the 
Troy Trojans to form the New York Gothams for the National League. Mutrie 
managed the Metropolitans in 1883 and 1884, leading them to the 1884 World 
Series the latter year. In 1885, he switched to managing the Gothams, and 
is credited with giving them their nickname, the Giants. With star players 
such as Buck Ewing, Tim Keefe and Roger Connor, the Giants won National 
League pennants and World Series titles under Mutrie in 1888 and 1889. 
Ewing, Keefe and many other players defected to the Players' League's New 
York Giants in 1890, and the National League Giants under Mutrie slumped 
to sixth and then third place. When the Giants were reorganized after the 
1891 season under new ownership, Mutrie was not retained as manager. After 
leaving baseball, Mutrie operated a hotel in Elmira, New York and a newsstand 
on Staten Island. He died of cancer on Roosevelt Island in New York City
