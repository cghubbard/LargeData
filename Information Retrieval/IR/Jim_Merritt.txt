James Joseph Merritt (born December 9, 1943) is a former left-handed Major 
League Baseball pitcher. Merritt originally signed with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers out of Edgewood High School in West Covina, California, but was 
plucked from their organization by the Minnesota Twins in the 1961 first-year 
draft before pitching a game for his home team. He went 54–45 with a 3.39 
earned run average and 719 strikeouts over four seasons in their farm system 
when he was called up to the majors in 1965 by the first place Twins just 
before World Series rosters were set. He made two appearances in the 1965 
World Series against his former franchise, pitching 3.1 innings and giving 
up one earned run. Merritt got off to a horrible start in 1966. Despite 
a respectable 2.95 ERA, his record stood at 0–6 on July 1 thanks to a lack 
of run support. He turned his season around on July 21 with a three hit 
gem against the Washington Senators in which he struck out twelve and matched 
an American League record with seven strikeouts in a row.[1] He ended the 
season at 7–14 with a 3.38 ERA. He established himself as one of the better 
control pitchers in the AL in 1967 by striking out 161 batters while giving 
up just thirty walks. He also logged the league's fifth lowest ERA at 2.53. 
Following the 1968 season, he was traded even-up to the Cincinnati Reds 
for shortstop Leo Cárdenas.[2] The Reds battled the Dodgers, Atlanta Braves 
and San Francisco Giants for first place in the National League West all 
through the 1969 season. Merritt's sixteenth victory on August 31[3] moved 
his team into a second place tie with the Dodgers, a half game back of 
the Giants. From there, however, things went south for Merritt as he lost 
four of his last five decisions. His final loss of the season, against 
the Houston Astros, eliminated the Reds from playoff contention.[4] On 
May 17, 1970, Merritt held Hank Aaron hitless as he stood one hit shy of 
3000.[5] His record stood at 14–7 with a 3.46 ERA at the 1970 All-Star 
break to earn selection to Gil Hodges' National League squad. He pitched 
two innings, striking out Frank Robinson, and giving up a single to former 
teammate, Harmon Killebrew.[6] He finished the season at 20–12, and edging 
out Gary Nolan for the Johnny Vander Meer Award given each year to the 
Reds' top pitcher. His only career twenty win season was also the first 
twenty win season for a Reds left-handed pitcher since Eppa Rixey in 1925.[7] 
He also clubbed three home runs. The "Big Red Machine" won 102 games and 
coasted to the post season. Merritt won game two of the Reds' three game 
sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1970 National League Championship 
Series,[8] however, Merritt and the Reds were less successful in the World 
Series against the Baltimore Orioles. The O's defeated the Reds in five 
games. Merritt started the decisive game, and gave up three earned runs 
in 1.2 innings of work to take the loss.[9] After starting 1971 with a 
record of 0–8 and a 4.96 ERA, Merritt was moved into the bullpen.[10] He 
lost two games in relief and two more spot starts to bring his record to 
0–11 with a 5.38 ERA on August 3. He won his only game of the season on 
August 21 against the Pirates.[11] His lack of success in 1971 was attributed 
to an elbow injury suffered at the end of the 1970 season.[12] He made 
just four appearances in 1972, and was sent to the Triple-A Indianapolis 
Indians on May 6.[13] He went 4–8 with a 4.33 ERA for Indianapolis. Following 
the season, he was dealt to the Texas Rangers for Jim Driscoll and Hal 
King. Merritt started the 1973 season in the bullpen, but moved into the 
starting rotation in June. Texas lost 105 games in 1973. For his part, 
Merritt was 5–13 with one save and a 4.05 ERA. Over the following two seasons, 
Merritt appeared in 31 more games for Texas without a decision or save. 
He was released on July 17, 1975. Perhaps the most notable moment of his 
Texas Rangers career occurred on August 23, 1973 when Merritt credited 
the three hit shutout he pitched against the Cleveland Indians to the 25 
"Gaylord fastballs" he threw. The following day, AL President Joe Cronin 
fined Merritt for throwing spitters.[14] Merritt led the NL with fifteen 
successful bunts in 1969. For his career, he had four home runs and five 
runs batted in. Merritt held left handed hitters to a .225 batting average.
