Larry Wayne Vanover (born August 22, 1955) is an American professional 
baseball umpire Vanover worked in the National League from 1991 to 1999. 
He did not umpire in 2000 and 2001, and since 2002 has umpired across both 
major leagues. Vanover has umpired in three Division Series (2006, 2013, 
2016), three League Championship Series (2003, 2007, 2011), and the 2016 
World Series. He also has officiated in two All Star Games (1999, 2013) 
and the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Vanover worked in several minor leagues 
before his major league debut in 1993. He officiated in the South Atlantic 
League, Midwest League, Southern League, American Association, Pacific 
Coast League, International League and Venezuelan League.[2] Vanover was 
behind the plate when Marge Schott came on the field just prior to an April 
1996 Astrosâ€“Reds doubleheader and apologized to Vanover for her Opening 
Day comments following the death of umpire John McSherry.[3] The Opening 
Day game had been postponed after McSherry collapsed on the field; he died 
at a local hospital. After the game was postponed, Schott had said, "I 
feel cheated."[4] Vanover was one of 22 umpires who resigned during the 
1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation. The negotiation 
strategy failed when baseball officials simply accepted the resignations 
and hired replacement umpires. After a protracted legal battle, Vanover 
and eight other umpires regained their major league jobs for the 2002 season.[5][6] 
MLB appointed Vanover to serve as crew chief for the 2014 Legend Series 
at Rod Carew Stadium in Panama City, Panama on March 15-16.[7] Vanover 
spent the 2014 season as an interim crew chief while regular crew chief 
Tim McClelland was on the disabled list. He was officially promoted to 
permanent crew chief upon McClelland's retirement prior to the 2015 season. 
He was the home plate umpire for Derek Jeter's final game.[8] Interim (*)
