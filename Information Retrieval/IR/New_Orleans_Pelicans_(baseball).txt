The New Orleans Pelicans or "Pels" were a minor league professional baseball 
team based in New Orleans, Louisiana.[2] Founded in 1865 as an amateur 
social/sporting organization, the Pelicans became a professional franchise 
when they joined the Southern League in 1887. That league operated off-and-on 
until it finally folded in 1899. During that time the team captured three 
pennants: 1887, 1889, and 1896.[3][4] The Pelicans then became a founding 
member of the Southern Association in 1901.[5] From 1887–1900, the team 
played at Sportsman's Park/Crescent City Base Ball Park located at the 
foot of Canal Street near the New Basin Canal (now the Pontchartrain Expressway).[6] 
In 1901, the Pelicans moved to Athletic Park and played there until 1908. 
After the 1908 season the team moved to Pelican Park, which was located 
on South Carrollton Avenue, across from present-day Jesuit High School. 
In 1914, the Pelican Park wooden grandstand was moved by mule teams a quarter-mile 
down South Carrollton Avenue to the intersection with Tulane Avenue in 
Mid-City New Orleans. From 1915 through 1936 the facility was known as 
Heinemann Park after Alexander J. Heinemann, a shareholder in the club 
and owner of the stadium. The name was changed in 1936 to Pelican Stadium 
following the death of Heinemann and team owner Charles Somers. The Pelicans 
played their final game there in 1957. After this, they played for two 
years at City Park Stadium, now called Tad Gormley Stadium, in City Park. 
The franchise was sold to Little Rock at the end of the 1959 season. The 
Southern Association folded after the 1961 season.[7] Notable Pelicans 
included Shoeless Joe Jackson, Jimmy Dygert, Henry "Cotton" Knaupp, Bill 
Lindsay, Zeke Bonura, Gene Freese, and Hall of Famers Dazzy Vance, Joe 
Sewell, Bob Lemon, and Earl Weaver. In Jackson's only season with New Orleans 
(1910), he hit .354 to win the league batting title and led the team to 
the pennant with an 87–53 record. The following year, he would hit .408 
with the American League's Cleveland Naps.[8] In the 1950s, the team was 
associated with the Pittsburgh Pirates and was managed by Danny Murtaugh. 
Other notable Pelican managers included Larry Gilbert and Abner Powell, 
with the latter credited with introducing the perforated "rain check" in 
1889. The Pelicans' name briefly resurfaced during the 1977 season when 
oilman A. Ray Smith moved his Triple-A Tulsa Oilers to New Orleans to play 
in the Superdome. Tony La Russa was the starting shortstop for the team. 
After a single season, the team then moved to Springfield, Illinois, and 
were renamed the Redbirds. On December 4, 2012, it was reported that Tom 
Benson, owner of the NFL's New Orleans Saints and the NBA's New Orleans 
Hornets, would be changing the Hornets' official name to the Pelicans, 
possibly as early as the 2013–2014 NBA season.[9][10] These reports were 
officially confirmed on January 24, 2013, when the newly branded Pelicans 
officially announced the name change and unveiled accompanying logos and 
a blue, gold and red color scheme. One year later, the Hornets name, logo 
and color scheme were reclaimed by the now Charlotte Hornets. The basketball 
Hornets originally came from Charlotte, North Carolina, before relocating 
to New Orleans in 2002. The Pelicans were affiliated with the following
