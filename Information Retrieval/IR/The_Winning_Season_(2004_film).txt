The Winning Season is a 2004 television film with elements of a fantasy 
drama. It chronicles a young boy's dream in 1985 with playing with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates' great Honus Wagner.[1] The film follows the dream to 
the point where the boy is assisting Wagner in his 1909 World Series duel 
with fellow hall-of-famer Ty Cobb. It is adapted from the children's novel 
Honus & Me by Dan Gutman. The film was made by TNT and first broadcast 
on April 4, 2004. Modine prepared for his role as Wagner by playing with 
a minor-league team, the IronBirds in Aberdeen, Maryland, owned by Cal 
Ripken, Jr..[2] Variety condemned the film as "schlocky" and sentimental. 
Their critic found Modine's performance started to wear and Davis brought 
"little conviction", but praised director John Kent Harrison for the performance
