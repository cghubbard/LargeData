Gerald Edward Priddy (November 9, 1919 – March 3, 1980), was an American 
professional baseball player and a second baseman in Major League Baseball 
for 11 years. He played for the New York Yankees (1941–1942), Washington 
Senators (1943, 1946–1947), St. Louis Browns (1948–1949), and Detroit Tigers 
(1950–1953). Priddy appeared in 1,296 major league baseball games. He had 
a career batting average of .265 with 1,252 hits, 612 runs scored, 541 
RBIs, 232 doubles, 624 walks, 639 strikeouts, and 61 home runs. Hall of 
Famer Phil Rizzuto later said of Priddy's playing career: "I'll never understand 
what happened with him, other than bad luck and some injuries. Jerry was 
a better player than I was. He had more power and could play the heck out 
of second base." (Bill Madden, Pride of October, p. 11.) Baseball historian 
Bill James wrote an entire chapter about Priddy in his book The Politics 
of Glory. He concluded that Priddy hit relatively well, was one of the 
greatest defensive players in history, and had "essentially the same skills 
as Mazeroski and Bolling." James ranked Priddy as the 73rd best second 
baseman of all time. (The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, 
p. 525.) Born in Los Angeles, Priddy was signed by the New York Yankees' 
Southern California scouting chief, Bill Essick. In 1938, Priddy was paired 
with shortstop Phil Rizzuto as a double play combination for three years 
in the Yankees' minor league organization. In 1938, Priddy and Rizzuto 
played beside each other on the Norfolk Tars championship team. (Amy Walters 
Yarsinske, Summer on the Southside(Arcadia 1998), p. 63.) [1]. The following 
year, they were promoted together to the American Association's Kansas 
City Blues. With Priddy, Rizzuto, and Vince DiMaggio, the 1939 Blues went 
107–47 and have been ranked as the 12th best minor league team of all-time 
according to MinorLeagueBaseball.com. [2] Rizzuto and the 19-year-old Priddy 
were two of the league's best players in 1939. Priddy hit .333 with 24 
home runs and 107 RBIs, leading the American Association with 44 doubles 
(44); he was second in hits (193), total bases (339), and triples (15), 
third in batting average, and fourth in RBIs. He also led the league's 
second basemen in putouts (372), assists (456), and double plays (126). 
[3] By 1940, the exploits of Priddy and Rizzuto drew attention in New York 
as the Yankees' double play combination of the future. Mel Allen gave regular 
reports about their performance in Kansas City during his New York radio 
broadcasts. Allen predicted they would become "the best the Yankees ever 
had." (Bill Madden, Pride of October: What It Was to Be Young and a Yankee 
[Warner Books 2003], p. 10.) [4] Rizzuto recalled Priddy as: "That huckleberry. 
He was something else. We were close even though we were opposites in a 
lot of ways. He was cocky.... oh he was sure of himself. Me, on the other 
hand, I was shy and always worried. He took me under his wing, but he loved 
playing tricks on me too.... like nailing my shoes to the floor, ripping 
up all my fan letters, all those things." (Bill Madden, Pride of October, 
p. 10.) One book states that Priddy played in the late 1930s with Babe 
Herman's All Stars, a touring team that staged exhibitions against all-stars 
from the Negro Leagues. Charlie Biot, an outfielder who played against 
Priddy, recalled in old age how impressive a ballplayer Priddy was in those 
games. [5] When spring training arrived in 1941, Yankee manager Joe McCarthy 
announced that Rizzuto and Priddy would start at shortstop and second base, 
with Joe "Flash" Gordon moving to first base to make room for Priddy. McCarthy 
said, "We don't want to break up Rizzuto and Priddy, so my plan is to move 
Gordon to first base." (Bill Madden, Pride of October, p. 10.) On April 
14, 1941, Time magazine wrote: "Last year these Keystone Kids led Kansas 
City to its second consecutive pennant and set a new league record for 
double plays: 130. Both are extraordinary hitters, extraordinary fielders." 
[6] After McCarthy announced his plan, Priddy reportedly walked up to the 
future Hall of Famer Gordon, telling him, "I'm the better second baseman. 
I can make the double play better than you. ... do everything better than 
you." (Bill Madden, Pride of October, p. 10.) By the middle of May, Priddy 
was batting only .204, and McCarthy benched him, putting Gordon back at 
second base. Rizzuto recalled that Priddy's disrespect of Gordon got him 
off to a rocky start with the Yankee veterans. As a result, Priddy got 
no sympathy when he failed to live up to expectations and his own cocky 
predictions. In 1941, Priddy batted only .213 in 56 games, while Gordon 
hit 24 home runs and scored 104 runs. In 1942, matters got worse for Priddy, 
as they got better for Gordon. Gordon hit .322 with 103 RBIs and was chosen 
the American League's Most Valuable Player. Priddy played in only 59 games 
in 1942, mostly at third base, and only eight games at his natural second 
base spot. He also fought with manager Joe McCarthy, and during the winter 
of 1942–1943, Priddy complained publicly about his lack of playing time, 
saying that he was being "wasted" by the Yankees. He also asked to be traded. 
On January 29, 1943, Priddy was traded with Milo Candini to the Washington 
Senators for Bill Zuber and cash. That year, Priddy was the Senators' starting 
second baseman. He batted .271 with 31 doubles, 67 walks, and 62 runs scored; 
he finished 16th in the AL MVP voting. Priddy entered the Army in December 
1943 and was not discharged until January 1946. When he returned in 1946, 
Priddy's average dropped to .254 and then dropped even further to .214 
in 1947. As had been the case in New York, Priddy did not get along with 
the Senators' manager, Ossie Bluege. While playing for the Senators in 
1943, Priddy met an 11-year-old Maury Wills. Wills later recalled that 
the Senators had sent Priddy to help with a playground baseball clinic 
in the African-American section of Washington. Wills recalled, "It was 
the very first time I had ever looked a white guy in the eyes." Wills was 
impressed that Priddy didn't just stay for 15 minutes and leave. "The man 
talked to us for at least two hours, and I just couldn't believe it. Priddy 
even singled me out. He told the other kids to move back and said, 'Watch 
this kid.' He bounced a grounder to me, and I got my little feet in place, 
grabbed the ball, and I took a little hop – just like the guys I'd seen 
playing on Sundays. I threw it overhand to him, and the ball made a loud 
pop in his mitt. I still remember what he said: 'Wow!'" [7] Priddy looked 
down at Wills' feet and said, "Hey, kid, you've got a chance to be a good 
baseball player one day. Where's your shoes?" Wills recalled he was barefoot. 
[8] On November 22, 1947, the Senators traded Priddy to the St. Louis Browns 
for Johnny Berardino‚ but Berardino announced he was retiring to devote 
himself to his movie career. Commissioner Happy Chandler cancelled the 
trade, and Berardino then un-retired. Priddy ended up with the Browns anyway, 
as the Senators sold him to the Browns for $25‚000 on December 8, 1947. 
Priddy had two strong seasons for St. Louis. In 1948, he hit .296 with 
a .391 on-base percentage and led the AL's second basemen in putouts, assists, 
double plays, and chances per game. He was 16th in the 1948 AL MVP voting. 
He had another good year in 1949, batting .290 with a .382 on-base percentage 
and finishing 22nd in the AL MVP voting. The Browns' attendance dropped 
to 270,000 in 1949 (compared with more than 2 million in New York and Cleveland), 
and the team was forced to sell their best players to raise $200,000 to 
make ends meet. On December 14, 1949, the Browns traded Priddy to the Detroit 
Tigers for Lou Kretlow and $100,000. (Tom Deveaux, The Washington Senators, 
1901–1971 (McFarland 2001), p. 157.) [9] In 1950, Priddy played a career- 
and AL-high 157 games, all at second base, for Detroit. He hit .277 with 
a .376 on-base percentage, 13 home runs, and 75 RBIs; he was among the 
AL leaders with 104 runs scored (10th), 95 walks (7th), 126 singles (7th), 
253 times on base (10th), 13 sacrifice hits (6th), and 618 at-bats (4th). 
He finished 17th in the 1950 AL MVP voting. Priddy led the league in games 
played again in 1951, but his offensive output dropped to 73 runs scored, 
22 doubles, 8 home runs, and 57 RBIs. In 1952, Priddy's playing time was 
reduced to 75 games, and reduced even further in 1953 to 65 games. Priddy 
played his last major league game on September 27, 1953. Priddy returned 
to the minor leagues after the 1953 season to play and manage for a few 
more years. He later tried his hand as a professional golfer with little 
success. (Mike Robbins, Ninety Feet from Fame: Close Calls with Baseball 
Immortality [Carroll & Graf 2004]) [10] On June 6, 1973, Priddy was arrested 
by the FBI in California and charged with trying to extort $250,000 from 
a steamship company by threatening to put a bomb aboard one of its vessels, 
the Island Princess. He was convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison. 
Phil Rizzuto later said that he could never believe "that whole extortion 
thing." He said: "That wasn't the Gerry I knew. He was outspoken and hotheaded 
... but outside of baseball he was a regular guy. He knew a lot of prominent 
businesspeople. It just didn't make sense. He called me when he got out 
of prison and told me if he'd have to spend one more day in there he'd 
have been a hardened criminal." (Bill Madden, Pride of October, p. 12.) 
In 1980, Priddy died of a heart attack at his home in North Hollywood,
