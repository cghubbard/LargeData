Yulieski Gurriel Castillo (born June 9, 1984) is a Cuban professional baseball 
third baseman for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
previously played for Industriales in the Cuban league. A former member 
of Cuba's national team,[1] Gurriel is primarily a third baseman, though 
he has also played other positions, such as shortstop and second base. 
The son of former Cuban player Lourdes Gurriel, Yulieski was regarded as 
the best player in Cuba in 2006.[2] At the World Baseball Classic in 2006, 
Major League Baseball scouts projected that Gurriel would be a first-round 
draft pick if he were eligible for the draft.[2] Gurriel's contributions 
helped the national team win a gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics and 
World Cup of Baseball championships in 2003 and 2005. During the 2005 World 
Cup, he led all batters with eight home runs. He played second base for 
Cuba in the inaugural 2006 World Baseball Classic,[1] making the final 
out for Cuba in their championship game loss to Japan. He batted .273 in 
the tournament, with a .342 on-base percentage and a .515 slugging percentage. 
Coincidentally, later in the finals of the 2008 Beijing Olympics Tournament, 
he again made the final out by grounding out into a double play against 
South Korea. [3] He played for Cuba again in the 2009 World Baseball Classic 
this time in third base and batted for .333 in the tournament with 2 home 
runs and 6 RBI. On May 11, 2014 Gurriel signed a one-year contract with 
the Yokohama DeNA BayStars.[4] Gurriel had a solid season during the 2004–05 
Cuban National Series, leading the league in hits and runs. However, he 
truly dominated in 2005–06, leading the series in RBIs, runs and triples.[5] 
His 27 home runs, which also led the league, were one short of the record 
of 28.[6] Gourriel's batting average was .327 and his slugging percentage 
was .676. In February 2016, Gurriel and his 22-year-old brother, Lourdes 
Gurriel Jr., defected after competing in the Caribbean World Series in 
the Dominican Republic.[7] In June, Major League Baseball declared Gurriel 
eligible to be signed by a major league team as a free agent.[8] Nearly 
ten years prior, ESPN.com had erroneously reported that Gurriel and another 
Cuban national player, Eduardo Paret, had defected from Cuba and into Colombia.[9] 
Gurriel refuted this claim on August 1, 2006, stating that he returned 
to his home in Cuba immediately after the conclusion of the tournament 
the Cuban national team had been playing in.[10] On July 16, 2016, Gurriel 
signed a five-year, $47.5 million contract with the Houston Astros.[11][12] 
He made his American debut in July with the Gulf Coast Astros of the Rookie-level 
Gulf Coast League, playing in two games. He was then promoted to the Lancaster 
JetHawks of the Class A-Advanced California League. After playing in four 
games for Lancaster, the Astros promoted Gurriel to the Corpus Christi 
Hooks of the Class AA Texas League.[13] He batted 2-for-17 (.118) in five 
games for Corpus Christi, and was promoted to the Fresno Grizzlies of the 
Class AAA Pacific Coast League.[14] He was recalled from Fresno to the 
major league roster on August 21. In his first 19 games with the Astros, 
he batted .344 with three home runs and eight runs batted in, playing mostly 
first and third base defensively.[15] His brother, Lourdes Gurriel Jr.
