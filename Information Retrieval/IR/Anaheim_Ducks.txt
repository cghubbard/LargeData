                         The Anaheim Ducks are an American professional 
ice hockey team based in Anaheim, California. They are members of the Pacific 
Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). 
Since their inception, the Ducks have played their home games at the Honda 
Center. The club was founded in 1993 by The Walt Disney Company as the 
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a name based on the 1992 film The Mighty Ducks. 
Disney sold the franchise in 2005 to Henry and Susan Samueli, who along 
with General Manager Brian Burke, changed the name of the team to the Anaheim 
Ducks before the 2006–07 season. The Ducks have made the playoffs 12 times 
and won five Pacific Division titles (2006–07, 2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15, 
and 2015–16), two Western Conference championships (2002–03 and 2006–07) 
and one Stanley Cup (2006–07). The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim were founded 
in 1993 by The Walt Disney Company. The franchise was awarded by the NHL 
in December 1992, along with the rights to a Miami team that would become 
the Florida Panthers. An entrance fee of $50 million was required, half 
of which Disney would pay directly to the Los Angeles Kings in order to 
share Southern California.[2] On March 1, 1993, at the brand-new Anaheim 
Arena – located a short distance east of Disneyland and across the Orange 
Freeway from Angel Stadium – the team got its name, inspired by the 1992 
Disney movie The Mighty Ducks, based on a group of misfit kids who turn 
their losing youth hockey team into a winning team.[3] Philadelphia-arena 
management specialist Tony Tavares was chosen to be team president,[3] 
and Jack Ferreira, who previously helped create the San Jose Sharks, became 
the Ducks' general manager.[4] The Ducks selected Ron Wilson to be the 
first coach in team history.[5] The Ducks and the expansion Florida Panthers 
team filled out their rosters in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft and the 1993 
NHL Entry Draft. In the former, a focus on defense led to goaltenders Guy 
Hebert and Glenn Healy being the first picks, followed by Alexei Kasatonov 
and Steven King.[6] In the latter, the Ducks selected as the fourth overall 
pick Paul Kariya, who only began play in 1994 but would turn out to be 
the face of the franchise for many years.[7] The resulting roster had the 
lowest payroll of the NHL, with only $7.9 million.[8] Led by captain Troy 
Loney, the Ducks' finished the season 33–46–5, a record-breaking number 
of wins for an expansion team, which the Florida Panthers also achieved. 
The Ducks sold out 27 of 41 home games, including the last 25, and filled 
the Arrowhead Pond to 98.9% of its season capacity. Ducks licensed merchandise 
shot to number one in sales among NHL clubs,[9] helped by their presence 
in Disney's theme parks and Disney Stores.[10] The lockout-shortened 1994–95 
NHL season saw the debut of Paul Kariya, who would play 47 of the team's 
48 games that year, scoring 18 goals and 21 assists for 39 points. The 
Ducks had another respectable season, going 16–27–5. 1995–96 would mark 
a big change for the team, especially for second-year superstar Paul Kariya. 
During the season, he was chosen to play for the Western Conference in 
the 1996 NHL All-Star Game as the lone Ducks representative. At the time 
of his selection, (January 1996), Kariya was ranked 14th in league scoring 
with 51 points (23 goals and 28 assists) over 42 games, and his efforts, 
the Ducks were overall a low-scoring team. Then a midseason blockbuster 
deal with the Winnipeg Jets improved the franchise. The Ducks sent Chad 
Kilger, Oleg Tverdovsky and a third round pick to the Jets in return for 
Marc Chouinard, a fourth round draft pick and right winger Teemu Selanne. 
Following the trade, Ducks centre Steve Rucchin commented, "Paul [Kariya] 
had a lot of pressure on him... He singlehandedly won some games for us 
this year... Now that we have Teemu, there's no way everybody can just 
key on Paul."[11] These three players formed one of the most potent lines 
of their time.[12] Although the trade proved to be an important effort 
in the team, they still finished short of the playoffs, losing the eight 
spot in the West to the Jets based on the number of wins.[13] During the 
1996–97 season, Kariya became team captain following Randy Ladouceur's 
retirement in the off-season,[14] and led the Ducks to their first post-season 
appearance, after recording the franchise's first winning record of 36–33–13, 
good enough for home ice in the first round as the number four seed against 
the Phoenix Coyotes.[15] The Ducks trailed 3–2 going into Phoenix for game 
six. Kariya scored in overtime to force the franchise's first game 7 which 
they won. In the second round, however, they lost to the eventual Stanley 
Cup champion Red Wings in a four-game sweep. After the season, Wilson was 
fired after saying he would like to coach the Capitals.[16] Pierre Page 
succeeded him. The Ducks started out slowly in 1997–98, in part because 
Kariya missed the first 32 games of the season in a contract dispute. He 
came back in December, but on February 1, he suffered a season-ending concussion 
when the Chicago Blackhawks' Gary Suter cross-checked him in the face. 
With Kariya playing only a total of 22 games that season, the Ducks missed 
the playoffs and fired Page.[17] The Ducks followed that season up by finishing 
sixth in the Western Conference in 1998–99 with new head coach Craig Hartsburg. 
However, they were swept by the Detroit Red Wings again, this time in the 
first round. In the 1999–2000 season, the Ducks finished with the same 
amount of points as the previous season, but a much more competitive Western 
Conference had them miss the playoffs by four points behind rival San Jose 
Sharks.[18] Despite this, the Mighty Ducks scored more goals than the conference 
champion Dallas Stars. In the following season, 2000–01, the Ducks ended 
up performing worse, as Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne's point production 
significantly declined from the previous season – Kariya went from 86 points 
to 67 points and Selanne went from 85 points to 57 points. Selanne was 
subsequently dealt to San Jose at the trade deadline for Jeff Friesen, 
Steve Shields and a second round draft pick and head coach Craig Hartsburg 
was fired during the season. The team ended up with a losing record and 
last place in the Western Conference that season. Without Selanne, Kariya's 
numbers continued to drop in the 2001–02 season with new coach Bryan Murray. 
The Mighty Ducks finished in 13th place in the Western Conference. The 
Mighty Ducks did not reach the post-season again until the 2002–03 season 
with coach Mike Babcock. They entered the playoffs in seventh place with 
a 40–27–9–6 record, good enough for 95 points. In the first round, the 
Ducks were once again matched up with the Detroit Red Wings, the defending 
Stanley Cup champions. They shocked the hockey world by sweeping the Red 
Wings in four games. Steve Rucchin scored the series-winning goal in overtime 
in Game 4. In the second round, the Ducks faced the Dallas Stars. Game 
1 turned out to be the fourth-longest game in NHL history, with Petr Sykora 
scoring in the fifth overtime to give the Mighty Ducks the series lead. 
The Ducks would finish off the Stars in Game 6 at home. In the team's first 
trip to the Western Conference Finals, they were matched up against another 
Cinderella team, the sixth-seeded, three-year-old Minnesota Wild. Jean-Sebastien 
Giguere strung together three consecutive shutouts and allowed only one 
total goal in the series in an eventual sweep. The 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, 
to be played against the New Jersey Devils, had some interesting story 
lines. Anaheim forward Rob Niedermayer was playing against his brother 
Scott, while Giguere faced off against fellow French-Canadian goaltender 
Martin Brodeur. The series began with the home team winning the first five 
games. In Game 6 at home, Kariya was knocked out from a hit by Devils captain 
Scott Stevens. However, Kariya would return in the second period and score 
the fourth goal of the game. In an exciting third period, the Mighty Ducks 
defeated the Devils 5–2 to send the series back to New Jersey for Game 
7. Anaheim, however, could not complete their Cinderella run, as they lost 
a hard-fought Game 7 to the Devils 3–0. For his brilliant play during the 
post-season, Giguere was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) of the playoffs. He became only the fifth player in NHL history 
to have won the trophy as a member of the losing team. Giguere posted a 
15–6 record, 7–0 in overtime, with a 1.62 goals against average, a .945 
save percentage and a record 168-minute, 27-second shutout streak in overtime. 
After the season, Kariya promised to bring the Mighty Ducks back to the 
Stanley Cup Final the following year. Kariya, however, left the Ducks in 
the summer and joined former teammate Teemu Selanne on the Colorado Avalanche. 
The 2003–04 season was a season to forget, as Jean-Sebastien Giguere could 
not repeat his stellar goaltending from the previous year. Even with newcomers 
Sergei Fedorov and Vaclav Prospal, the team finished in 12th place in the 
standings with a 29–35–10–8 record. Giguere's stats subsequently declined 
from the previous season, as he only won half the games he did the year 
before, his goals against average increased from 2.30 to 2.62, his save 
percentage went down from .914 to .907 and he went from eight shutouts 
recorded to just three. The team also went from 203 goals to 174. During 
the summer of 2004, as the NHL and the National Hockey League Players' 
Association (NHLPA)'s labor dispute was headed towards a long lockout, 
Disney tried to sell the team but received a low offer of US$40-million, 
less than the franchise's original price. In 2005, Broadcom co-founder 
Henry Samueli of Irvine, California, and his wife, Susan, bought the Mighty 
Ducks from The Walt Disney Company for a reported US$75 million. The Samuelis 
pledged to keep the team in Anaheim. Brian Burke, former Vancouver Canucks 
general manager and president, was appointed GM and executive vice-president 
of the Mighty Ducks on June 20, 2005.[19] In January, Samueli announced 
that the team would be renamed as simply the "Anaheim Ducks" as of the 
following season.[20] On August 1, 2005, former Norris Trophy-winning defenseman 
Randy Carlyle was hired as the seventh coach in team history. Burke was 
familiar with Carlyle's coaching ability, as the latter had coached the 
Manitoba Moose from 1996 to 2001 (International Hockey League) and 2004–05 
(American Hockey League); the Moose had been the Canucks farm club since 
2001. Carlyle replaced Mike Babcock, who later signed on to coach Detroit. 
On August 4, 2005, free agent defenseman Scott Niedermayer signed with 
the Mighty Ducks to play with his brother Rob; Scott Niedermayer was almost 
immediately named team captain. On August 22, Teemu Selanne returned to 
Anaheim after undergoing knee surgery. He led the team in scoring during 
the season with 40 goals and 50 assists for 90 points. He would also record 
his 1,000th NHL point on January 30, 2006. The 2005–06 season also saw 
the emergence of rookies Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Chris Kunitz (Kunitz 
also played for the Ducks in 2003–04, but immediately returned to the Mighty 
Ducks' AHL affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks). On November 15, 2005, 
Anaheim traded Sergei Fedorov and a fifth-round draft pick to the Columbus 
Blue Jackets in exchange for defenseman Francois Beauchemin and forward 
Tyler Wright. The Ducks finished the season with a 43–27–12 record, good 
enough for 98 points and the sixth seed. The Ducks faced the Calgary Flames 
in the Western Conference Quarterfinals and forced a seventh game in Calgary, 
shutting-out the Flames to reach the Conference Semifinals. In an interesting 
playoffs, all the bottom seeds won in the first round, so the Ducks matched-up 
against the seventh-seeded Colorado Avalanche. Goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov 
shined as the Ducks swept the Avalanche in four-straight games, Bryzgalov 
breaking Giguere's scoreless streak record from the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs. 
In the franchise's second Western Conference Finals appearance, they faced 
the eighth-seeded Edmonton Oilers, a series the Ducks would ultimately 
lose in five games. Prior to the 2006–07 season, the Ducks adopted a completely 
new look to go along with their new name; their team colors became black, 
gold and orange, and the logo of a duck-shaped goalie mask was dropped 
in favor of the word "Ducks", with a webbed foot in place of the "D."[21] 
The Ducks traded Joffrey Lupul, Ladislav Smid and a first-round draft pick 
to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for star defenseman Chris Pronger. With 
this trade, solid scoring lines, a shut-down line featuring Rob Niedermayer, 
Samuel Pahlsson and Travis Moen and an enviable defense, the Ducks were 
considered by many to be a Stanley Cup favorite. On November 9, 2006, the 
Ducks defeated the Vancouver Canucks 6–0 at General Motors Place in Vancouver 
to improve their season record to 12–0–4. The win set an NHL open era record 
by remaining undefeated in regulation for the first 16 games of the season, 
eclipsing the previous mark set by the 1983–84 Edmonton Oilers (the record 
has since been broken by the Chicago Blackhawks' 21–0–3 start during the 
2012–13 season). Anaheim were subsequently shut out by the Flames the following 
game, 3–0, ending their streak. On January 16, 2007, the Ducks played in 
their franchise's 1,000th regular season game, and on March 11, the Ducks 
recorded their franchise's 1,000th point with a 4–2 win over the Canucks, 
which improved their franchise all-time record to 423–444–155, with 1,001 
points. On April 7, the Ducks won their first division title in franchise 
history when the Canucks defeated the second-place San Jose Sharks in the 
final game of the season. The Ducks ended the regular season with a 48–20–14 
record and 110 points—both franchise records. Although they had three fewer 
wins than the Nashville Predators, the Ducks won the second seed in the 
West by virtue of winning the Pacific Division title. The Ducks defeated 
the Minnesota Wild in the Conference Quarterfinals in five games and the 
Canucks in the Semifinals, also in five games. Once again, the Ducks faced 
the Detroit Red Wings in the franchise's third trip to the Western Conference 
Finals. In Game 3, Chris Pronger elbowed Tomas Holmstrom and subsequently 
received a one-game suspension for the illegal check. The Ducks, however, 
won Game 4 without Pronger and Game 5 in Detroit, with Teemu Selanne scoring 
the latter game's overtime winner. The Ducks then finished off the Red 
Wings in Game 6 to advance to their second-ever Stanley Cup Final appearance. 
In the Finals, the Ducks won the first two games at home against the Ottawa 
Senators. The Ducks, however, lost Game 3 and Pronger received his second 
one-game suspension, this time for elbowing Dean McAmmond. The Ducks were 
again able to win without Pronger, beating the Senators in Game 4 for an 
opportunity to win the Stanley Cup on home ice in Game 5. On June 6, the 
Ducks defeated the Senators 6–2 at Honda Center to claim their first Stanley 
Cup in franchise history. Travis Moen was credited with the Cup game-winning 
goal. Scott Niedermayer, the only player on the team who had previously 
won a Stanley Cup, was awarded the second Conn Smythe Trophy in Ducks history. 
The Ducks became the first California team, and the first West Coast team 
since the 1925 Victoria Cougars, to win the Stanley Cup. The Ducks began 
their title defense in the 2007–08 season without two fan favorites, Scott 
Niedermayer and Teemu Selanne, who were both contemplating retirement. 
To offset those losses, Burke signed forward Todd Bertuzzi and defenseman 
Mathieu Schneider. During the season, Burke put goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov 
on waivers, where he was picked-up by the Phoenix Coyotes. Free agent signee 
Jonas Hiller then became the back-up to starter Jean-Sebastien Giguere. 
Both Selanne and Niedermayer would ultimately return and the team finished 
with a 47–27–8 record, good enough to earn home ice advantage in the first 
round of the playoffs finishing as the fourth seed in the Western Conference. 
They were eliminated in the quarterfinals in six games by the Dallas Stars. 
In the off-season, Burke bought-out the remaining year on Todd Bertuzzi's 
contract and traded Mathieu Schneider to the Atlanta Thrashers. After an 
extremely slow start to the 2008–09 season, on November 12, 2008, Burke 
resigned to take the same position for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bob Murray 
replaced him as general manager, but the team struggled to make the playoffs 
as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. A bevy of trade deadline 
deals saw the departure of some mainstays from the Cup team, including 
Chris Kunitz, who was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman 
Ryan Whitney; Samuel Pahlsson, who was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets 
for defenseman James Wisniewski; and Travis Moen, who was traded to the 
San Jose Sharks for two prospects. The trades gave the Ducks new life as 
a hot streak to end the season launched the Ducks into the playoffs. Jonas 
Hiller emerged as the new number one goalie during the stretch drive. The 
Ducks defeated the number one seed and Presidents' Trophy-winning San Jose 
Sharks in six games in the first round before being eliminated in the conference 
semi-finals by the eventual Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings 
in seven games. Before the 2009–10 season, the Ducks traded Chris Pronger 
to the Philadelphia Flyers for Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and two first 
round draft picks. Francois Beauchemin and Rob Niedermayer also left via 
free agency for the Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils, respectively. 
The Ducks then signed free agent center and former Montreal Canadiens captain 
Saku Koivu to a one-year deal. Another slow start would doom the Ducks. 
Before the trade deadline, the Ducks traded Giguere to the Toronto Maple 
Leafs for Jason Blake and Vesa Toskala after signing Hiller to a contract 
extension. The trade deadline saw the Ducks trade Ryan Whitney to Edmonton 
for offensive defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, as well as the acquisitions 
of defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes and goalie Curtis 
McElhinney from the Calgary Flames. The Ducks played through frequent injuries 
and picked up play in the second half of the season, but struggled coming 
out of the Olympic break. For the first time since the lockout, the Ducks 
failed to make the playoffs with a 39–32–11 record. The 2010 off-season 
was also busy for the Ducks, as Scott Niedermayer announced his retirement 
in a June press conference. Niedermayer decided to stay a member of the 
Ducks as a team consultant. The Ducks resigned Saku Koivu for two years 
and signed free agent defenseman Toni Lydman to a three-year contract. 
In addition to Lydman, the Ducks were able to get defenseman Cam Fowler 
via the draft, and 35-year-old strong-willed defenseman Andy Sutton signed 
to a two-year deal. Restricted free agent Bobby Ryan was signed to a five-year 
deal. The 2010–11 season did not begin well for the Ducks, who would lose 
their first three games. They maintained a .500 throughout record through 
the first half of the season, but would find their rhythm and finish 47–30–5, 
good for 99 points and fourth place in the Western Conference. Corey Perry 
and Jonas Hiller represented the Ducks at the All-Star Game, and Corey 
Perry went on to have a 50-goal, 98-point season, which won him the Maurice 
"Rocket" Richard Trophy and Hart Memorial Trophy. He became the first-ever 
Duck to win the Hart, as well as the first Richard winner as a Duck since 
Teemu Selanne won the award in 1999. Hiller, however, was injured at the 
All-Star Game and missed the rest of the season. Even though the Ducks 
had a great season led by Perry, Hiller, Selänne, Lubomir Visnovsky and 
Ryan Getzlaf, they would end up losing in the first round of the 2011 playoffs 
to the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators. Before the 2011–12 season began, 
the team mourned the loss of former Mighty Duck Ruslan Salei, who died 
in a plane crash with several other former NHL players of Kontinental Hockey 
League (KHL) club Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. The team wore a black patch with 
his former jersey number, 24, in current team numbering. The Ducks started 
the season with NHL Premiere games in Helsinki and Stockholm. This was 
the third time in franchise history that they started the regular season 
with games in Europe. They lost 4–1 to the Buffalo Sabres in Helsinki but 
defeated the New York Rangers 2–1 after a shootout in Stockholm. After 
a slow start to the season, the Ducks replaced head coach Randy Carlyle 
with former Washington Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau. The rest of 
the season was mostly forgettable, as the Ducks could not get out of the 
hole they dug themselves in the first half of the season, and ultimately 
failed to reach the playoffs in the 2011–12 season. The 2012–13 season 
was shortened to 48 games due to a labor lockout. When play resumed in 
January 2013 after a new collective bargaining agreement was signed, the 
Ducks opened the season by sweeping a two-game Canadian road trip with 
a decisive 7–3 victory against the Vancouver Canucks on January 19, followed 
by a 5–4 decision against the Calgary Flames on January 21. Their home 
opener came on January 25, also against the Canucks, who would prevail 
5–0. The distinction of the Ducks' longest homestand was split between 
two five-game stretches from March 18–25 and from April 3–10. Anaheim's 
lengthiest road trip was a six-game haul from February 6–16. Due to the 
shortened season and the compacted game scheduling, all games were to be 
played against the Ducks' own Western Conference opponents, and no games 
were played against Eastern Conference teams. The Ducks finished the season 
with a 30–12–6 record and would win their second Pacific Division title 
in franchise history. In the Western Conference Quarterfinals, they ended 
up losing to the seventh-seeded Detroit Red Wings in seven games, despite 
holding a 3–2 series lead after Game 5. Entering the 2013–14 season, the 
20th anniversary of the franchise, it was announced that Teemu Selanne 
would be playing in his final NHL season. In the off-season, star forward 
Bobby Ryan was traded to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for forwards Jakob 
Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and Ottawa's first-round pick in the 2014 NHL 
Entry Draft, and the Ducks also signed defenseman Mark Fistric,[22] center 
Mathieu Perreault, and a returning Dustin Penner.[23] Despite a bad start 
suffering a 6–1 mauling at the hands of the Colorado Avalanche, the Ducks 
followed the opener with seven-straight wins, a run which was repeated 
and surpassed twice more during the season, including a franchise-record 
setting 10 consecutive wins from December 6 to 28, 2013. At one point of 
the season, the Ducks won 18 of 19 games, the longest run of one-loss play 
in the NHL for 45 years. A 9–1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on January 
15 saw Anaheim establish a 20–0–2 record at the Honda Center, which matched 
the longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years, as well as setting 
a franchise-record for goals scored in a game (9), and powerplay goals 
scored in a game (6).[24] Dustin Penner was eventually traded to the Washington 
Capitals, and prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Ducks acquired veteran 
defenceman Stephane Robidas from the Dallas Stars. Behind a Hart Trophy-caliber 
season from club captain Ryan Getzlaf, solid depth scoring, a steady if 
unspectacular defence and solid goaltending in the form of Jonas Hiller 
and rookie sensation Frederik Andersen, many felt that the Ducks were primed 
to be a top contender for the Stanley Cup. The Ducks remained towards the 
top of the NHL standings for the entire season, ending the regular season 
with a franchise-best 54–20–8 record (116 points) and eventually finishing 
one point behind the Boston Bruins in the race for the Presidents' Trophy, 
awarded to the team who finishes the regular season with the best record. 
The Ducks secured a second consecutive Pacific Division title and the number 
one seed in the Western Conference. Anaheim faced the eighth-seeded Dallas 
Stars in the Western Conference Quarter-finals, and were victorious in 
six games, marking the first time since 2009 that the Ducks had won a playoff 
series. In the Western Conference Semifinals, the Ducks faced their geographic 
rival and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings for the first 
time ever in the playoffs. In a hotly contested series, the Ducks ultimately 
went down in seven games to their Southern Californian rivals, losing Game 
7 by a score of 6–2 at the Honda Center. On June 27, 2014, the Ducks acquired 
center Ryan Kesler, as well as a third-round pick in 2015, from the Vancouver 
Canucks.[25] In the following season, they would win their third-straight 
Pacific Division title and finish as the top seed in the West with 109 
points. In the 2015 playoffs, they swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first 
round and beat the Calgary Flames in 5 games to set up a Western Conference 
Final against the Chicago Blackhawks. After taking a three games to two 
series lead on the strong play of goaltender Frederik Andersen, the Ducks 
lost the final two games of the series, including Game 7 on home ice. This 
marked the third straight season the Ducks had lost a series in Game 7 
at home after leading the series three games to two.[26] On July 15, 2015, 
the Ducks signed Ryan Kesler to a six-year contract extension totaling 
a reported $41.25 million.[27] Just prior to the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, 
the Ducks sent Emerson Etem and a draft pick to the New York Rangers in 
exchange for speedy left-wing Carl Hagelin. They also traded for Vancouver 
Canucks defenseman Kevin Bieksa, whilst adding veterans Shawn Horcoff, 
Chris Stewart and Mike Santorelli. Entering the 2015–16 NHL season, many 
analysts pegged the Ducks as Stanley Cup favorites. However, scoring struggles 
led to a slow start, with the team still out of a playoff spot in December.[28] 
The team improved afterwards riding the goaltending of John Gibson.[29] 
On March 6, 2016, the Ducks set a franchise record with an 11-game winning 
streak which ended the following night.[30][31] On March 24, 2016, the 
Ducks clinched a playoff spot in a 6–5 overtime loss to the Maple Leafs.[32] 
However, in the first round of the playoffs, they fell in seven games to 
the Nashville Predators, which led to the firing of head coach Bruce Boudreau.[33] 
On June 14, 2016, the Ducks announced that they re-hired former Ducks' 
coach Randy Carlyle.[34] The team's colors were purple and jade until the 
change of ownership in 2006. At this point, they became orange, black and 
gold, with white in place of black for the away jersey. The only exception 
is the alternate jersey, which is mostly orange. Orange, which has become 
one of the team’s primary colors, is in reference to Orange County, where 
Anaheim is located.[35] Founded in 1993, the then-called Mighty Ducks of 
Anaheim were directly named for The Mighty Ducks movies. And until 2005, 
the NHL team and the movie Mighty Ducks shared a logo and colors, too. 
When The Walt Disney Company, which produced the movies and owned the NHL 
team, sold the team in 2005, the name was shortened to its current state, 
“Anaheim Ducks.”[35] The Ducks' logo features a webbed foot forming a "D" 
followed by the other letters in the word "Ducks" in upper-case letters. 
The text itself is gold (which sometimes may appear as bronze as well) 
with orange and black accents (forming a three-dimensional appearance). 
The entire logo is in turn outlined by silver. The City of Anaheim's name 
appears in smaller upper-case print above the team name. The old logo of 
the Ducks prior to the name change featured an old-style goaltender mask, 
shaped to form the appearance of a duck bill. Behind the mask are two intersecting 
hockey sticks, a black circle and a triangle (the color of the triangle 
is either green or gray, depending on how the logo is used). The Ducks 
have officially worn three unique regular jerseys and five unique third 
jerseys in their franchise history: The original jerseys of the Ducks (then 
the Mighty Ducks) used jade green, purple, white and grey as primary colors 
for both the home and away jerseys. The team's dark jerseys were dominantly 
purple in color with diagonal gray and white stripes; the jersey is jade 
green below the stripes, which appear on the arms and waist, and the collar 
is jade and white. The white jerseys were similar, except that the purple 
is replaced mainly with white and the collar is completely purple in color. 
In 1996, shoulders patches were added to both jerseys featuring a forward-facing 
version of the main logo's "duck mask", surrounded by a circle reading 
"Mighty Ducks of Anaheim". The hockey pants also had a jade stripe on the 
sides that was eliminated after the Ducks' 2003 Stanley Cup run and heading 
into the 2003–04 season. About a year after the team was purchased from 
the Walt Disney Company by the Samuelis, Brian Burke initiated a name change 
dropping the "Mighty" after consultation with the fans showed that the 
typical fan had a willingness to update the "Mighty Ducks" name and jersey 
and also a desire to keep part of the traditions of the franchise. Burke 
sought inspiration for the jersey from the United States Military Academy,[citation 
needed] ending up with diagonal gold, white, black and orange stripes down 
the arms and waist with the word "Ducks" on the front. The jersey is similar 
to the team's most recent third jersey prior to the name change. The orange 
pays tribute to Orange County,[36] where Anaheim is located. For the 2007–08 
NHL season, the Ducks, like all NHL teams, changed over to new Reebok Edge 
jerseys. The new team jersey shows only minor modifications from the 2006–07 
season's jerseys, including a small NHL crest just below the neck, and 
a smaller ducks logo on the chest. After the first year of the Edge uniform 
system being in place, the Ducks increased the size of their logo. The 
Ducks would use these uniforms as their primary uniforms until the 2013–14 
season. On June 27, 2014, the Ducks unveiled their new uniforms that were 
based on the 2010–2014 alternate jerseys. Changes to the collar and number 
font were included. The third jerseys of the Ducks were created in 1995, 
1997, 2003, 2010 and 2015. The 1995 jersey was jade green with purple and 
white stripes on the collar and on the end of the sleeves. The logo was 
of team mascot Wildwing wearing a Mighty Ducks jersey while breaking through 
a sheet of ice. The jersey was short-lived; as severe criticism encouraged 
management to retire the jersey at the end of the 1995–96 season.[citation 
needed] The 1997 third jersey came with a rare fourth jersey partner. The 
third was a jade green-colored jersey with silver and purple stripes at 
the shoulders outlined in thin yellow, and a silver stripe at the bottom. 
It had the Mighty Ducks logo in the center of the chest. The fourth jersey 
was much like it. It was white with jade green, purple, and silver stripes 
at the shoulders of the jersey, but no bottom stripe. These jerseys saw 
action until the end of 1999–2000, when they stopped playing with their 
third jerseys, and used only the fourth. At the end of 1999–2000, the fourth 
was also retired. The 2003 third jersey was black with purple and gray 
stripes at the waist and on the sleeves. It had the alternate script logo 
of the present Mighty Ducks and old-style laces at the neck, as well as 
a shoulder patch displaying an interlocking "MD" (for "Mighty Ducks"). 
The popularity of this jersey amongst fans was so great it replaced the 
purple and jade jersey, serving as the home jersey for the last half of 
the 2005–06 season and playoffs. It was dropped following the season as 
the team went to a modified name, new uniforms, and color scheme; however, 
this popular jersey influenced the design of the new jerseys for 2006–07. 
It was the only time in the modern NHL days when a mainly black jersey 
was not worn with black pants; instead, the pants were purple. The 2010 
third jersey was officially unveiled on November 26, 2010, against the 
Chicago Blackhawks, the day after Thanksgiving. The jersey features the 
webbed "D" on the chest with the recolored Mighty Ducks logo on each shoulder. 
It features striping similar to the regular uniforms, and orange is much 
more prominent as a secondary color. In June 2014, the third jersey was 
made as the Ducks' primary home jersey, alongside a white one in the same 
style for away.[37] On October 16, 2015, the Ducks unveiled a brand new, 
orange third jersey when they went up against the Colorado Avalanche. This 
jersey brought back the old Mighty Ducks logo and features a black collar 
with the "Anaheim" wordmark on the left side, the webbed "D" logo on the 
shoulders, and unique stripes that goes along with the teams home socks. 
For their Stadium Series game on January 25, 2014, the Ducks created a 
special jersey. This jersey is primarily orange with black lettering and 
numbers. The chromed Ducks logo, designed for the Stadium Series, is on 
the chest. There are gold, black and white stripes on the sleeves as well 
as black trim around the bottom and sleeves. The jersey has old fashion 
black lace on the neck and also has a unique "OC" logo on the left shoulder 
to represent Orange County where the Ducks are from.[38] The official mascot 
for the Anaheim Ducks is an anthropomorphized duck by the name of Wild 
Wing. He has been the team's mascot since its inaugural season, and his 
name was chosen through fan voting. He wears a Ducks jersey with the number 
93 on the back, referring to the year the Ducks became an NHL team. He 
regularly descends from the rafters of the arena when making his in-game 
entrances.[39] In one such descent the rigging that lowered Wild Wing from 
the rafters malfunctioned leaving the mascot trapped fifty feet above the 
ice for several minutes. Another well known blunder occurred in October 
1995 when Wild Wing, attempting to jump through a "wall of fire", accidentally 
tripped causing the mascot to land on the fire and set his costume ablaze.[40] 
His physical appearance is similar to the duck mask in the original Mighty 
Ducks logo. A bronze statue of Wild Wing was located outside the south 
doors of Honda Center[41] from 1993 to 2012, until construction began on 
the 'Grand Terrace' addition to the arena. When construction was completed 
and the Grand Terrace opened in October 2013, the statue was noticeably 
absent. The mascot's name was also used for the leader of the Ducks, Wildwing 
Flashblade, in Disney's Mighty Ducks cartoon series. During the same time 
in which the team announced a name change as well as change in jersey designs, 
there was an attempt by the team's owners to change or replace the mascot, 
Wild Wing, but was halted after a highly successful petition by fans.[citation 
needed] The Mighty Ducks also used a secondary "mascot", a person (with 
no particular costume) called "The Iceman", during the team's first game 
in 1993. "The Iceman" appeared occasionally in the stands, played an electric 
guitar, and attempted to liven up the crowd. However, "The Iceman" was 
poorly received by fans and was quickly eliminated. This is a partial list 
of the last five seasons completed by the Ducks. For the full season-by-season
