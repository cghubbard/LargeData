The Curse of Billy Penn was a curse used to explain the failure of major 
professional sports teams based in Philadelphia to win championships since 
the March 1987 construction of the One Liberty Place skyscraper, which 
exceeded the height of William Penn's statue atop Philadelphia City Hall.[1] 
The curse apparently ended on October 29, 2008, when the Philadelphia Phillies 
won the 2008 World Series, a year and four months after a statuette of 
the William Penn figure atop City Hall was affixed to the final beam during 
the June 2007 topping-off of the Comcast Center, currently the tallest 
building in the city.[2] Atop Philadelphia City Hall stands a statue of 
William Penn, the city founder and original proprietor of the then-British 
colony of Pennsylvania (meaning "Penn's Woods").[3] For years, a "gentlemen's 
agreement" stated that the Philadelphia Art Commission would approve no 
building in the city which would rise above this statue.[4] This ended 
in March 1987, when a modern steel-and-glass skyscraper, One Liberty Place, 
opened three blocks away. One Liberty Place is taller than City Hall by 
397 feet (121 m), rising 945 feet (288 m) in height compared to the height 
of Penn's hat on City Hall, 547 feet (167 m). Its sister skyscraper, Two 
Liberty Place, at 848 ft (258 m), followed in 1990. Philadelphia sports 
teams had enjoyed a run of success. Major League Baseball's Phillies won 
the 1980 World Series and the 1983 National League pennant; the National 
Hockey League's Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1974 and 1975, 
and appeared in the finals in 1976, 1980, 1985, and 1987; the National 
Football League's Eagles appeared in Super Bowl XV following the 1980 season, 
losing to the Oakland Raiders; and the National Basketball Association's 
76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals, as well as making the finals in 1977, 
1980, and 1982. Before 1980, the Phillies had appeared in only two other 
World Series, in 1915 and 1950, and the Eagles had won no NFC conference 
championships since the 1966 agreement that had created the Super Bowl, 
while the 76ers won NBA titles in both Philadelphia and in their previous 
incarnation, the Syracuse Nationals. Construction on One Liberty Place 
began in 1985, two years after the last championship season in Philadelphia. 
In the 1980 season, all four teams reached the championship round of their 
respective leagues. Ultimately, only the Phillies would win a championship 
that year. After One Liberty Place opened, Philadelphia's franchises began 
a pattern of failures to win a world championship. The Flyers lost the 
Stanley Cup Finals twice, in 1987 to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games 
(although the Oilers were heavily favored), two months after One Liberty 
Place opened, and in 1997, in a four-game sweep by the Detroit Red Wings 
which was considered a collapse as the Flyers had home-ice advantage and 
had dominated the previous three playoff series en route to meeting the 
Red Wings. The Phillies upset the Atlanta Braves to win the NLCS, but then 
lost the 1993 World Series in six games to the Toronto Blue Jays, with 
the Series ending on Joe Carter's walkoff 3-run home run. The 76ers lost 
the 2001 NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games, although the 
defending champion Lakers were favored despite the Sixers having league 
MVP Allen Iverson. The Eagles lost three straight NFC Championship games 
from the 2001 through 2003 seasons, before reaching Super Bowl XXXIX after 
the 2004 season, only to lose to the New England Patriots by three points. 
In fact, the only years that Philadelphia's franchises reached their league's 
championship round after One Liberty Place opened were years that U.S. 
presidents were inaugurated, except for the Flyers in 1987,[5] and losses 
during such years date back to the 76ers loss in 1977.[5] When the Flyers 
played for the 2010 Stanley Cup, The Ottawa Citizen reported that the main 
reason for that lengthy championship drought was because the only years 
the city's teams played for championships during that time were years presidents 
were inaugurated.[5] The city's teams had lost championships during such 
years, beginning with the 76ers themselves in 1977.[5] The exceptions were 
the Phillies in 1983 and the Flyers in 1987.[5] In addition, losses in 
semifinal rounds had occurred eight times since the opening of One Liberty 
Place. Five of these semi-final eliminations were by the Flyers, in 1989, 
1995, 2000, 2004 and 2008. The 2000 team was one win away from a Stanley 
Cup Finals appearance, after leading the eventual champion New Jersey Devils 
3-1 before losing three straight (including Games 5 and 7 at home), the 
2004 team lost Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual 
champion Tampa Bay Lightning, and the 2008 team lost to their cross-state 
rival Pittsburgh Penguins in five games. The Eagles accounted for the other 
three conference-final losses; they lost the NFC Championship Game (the 
winner of which meets the winner of the AFC's corresponding game in the 
Super Bowl) three years in a row from 2001 to 2003, thus becoming the first 
NFL team to do this in either conference since the Dallas Cowboys of 1980–1982, 
losing the last two at home after posting the best record in the NFC. No 
other team in NFL history had lost back-to-back conference title games 
at home since the NFL began its practice in 1975 of awarding home-field 
advantage in postseason play based on regular-season record. During the 
period of the alleged Curse of Billy Penn, Philadelphia sports fans were 
infamous for rude and unsportsmanlike behavior. Fans pelted national TV 
broadcasters with snowballs, ice, and beer during a Cowboys-Eagles game 
in 1989 known as "Bounty Bowl II". On Nov. 10, 1997, an Eagles fan shot 
a flare gun across the field into the stands during a nationally televised 
Monday night game against the San Francisco 49ers. In 1999, Sports Illustrated 
blamed the fans' behavior on their teams' longtime poor quality of play, 
as seen in the 40-year championship drought for the Eagles and the 76ers' 
1972-1973 season, which was the worst in NBA history at 9-73.[6] The curse 
was also said to include Bensalem-Township-based thoroughbred racehorse 
Smarty Jones, who saw his bid for horse racing's Triple Crown disappear 
when he finished second in the 2004 Belmont Stakes behind 36-1 longshot 
Birdstone after victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The 
curse has also been blamed for the death of the thoroughbred horse Barbaro, 
who was owned and bred by a couple from West Grove, Pennsylvania, a borough 
right outside of Philadelphia.[7][8] Though Barbaro won the 2006 Kentucky 
Derby, his leg was dramatically shattered two weeks later during the 2006 
Preakness Stake, leading to the horse's death. Although the curse was not 
generally considered as extending to college sports, two Philadelphia-based 
college basketball teams, the St. Joseph's Hawks and the Villanova Wildcats, 
which had successful seasons in 2004 and 2006 respectively, failed to reach 
the Final Four of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. Both were eliminated 
in the fourth-round Elite Eight matches, with St. Joe's, first seed in 
the East Regional, losing in a close match to Oklahoma State, and Villanova, 
first seed in the Minneapolis Regional, falling to eventual NCAA-champion 
Florida. Villanova won the national championship in 1985, two years before 
the Liberty Place opening. A third Philadelphia team, the Temple Owls, 
has also lost five times in the Elite Eight (1988, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2001). 
Villanova ended the college basketball drought for the Philadelphia teams 
with a national championship in 2016. The curse, however, was apparently 
not extended to professional teams outside of the four major leagues. The 
Philadelphia Wings of the NLL (indoor lacrosse winter league) have won 
six titles since 1989, and the now-defunct Philadelphia Barrage of the 
MLL (outdoor summer lacrosse league) won three championships (2004, 2006, 
and 2007). The AHL's Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers' top minor-league 
affiliate from 1996 to 2009, won the Calder Cup championship in 1998 and 
2005. Additionally, the Philadelphia KiXX of the MISL won their league's 
championship in 2002 and 2007. The AFL's Philadelphia Soul won ArenaBowl 
XXII in 2008 and ArenaBowl XXIX in 2016. The Philadelphia Freedoms, a tennis 
team in the World Team Tennis League, also won titles in 2001 and 2006. 
In spite of the Curse, when Philadelphia sports teams have reached their 
league's championship round, Penn's statue has sometimes been decorated 
to support that team's success. For example, after the Phillies won the 
1993 National League pennant, Penn was fitted with an oversized red Phillies 
baseball cap; when the Flyers went to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, the 
city adorned Penn with an orange-torso-with-white-shoulders Flyers jersey 
(at the time, the combination was the Flyers' road jersey). When the Sixers 
faced the Lakers in the 2001 NBA Finals, Penn's statue was not decorated. 
Pat Croce, president and part-owner of the Sixers, said he would have "decked 
out" the statue had the Sixers won but not before.[9] Penn's statue was 
also left untouched when the Eagles went to Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. On 
June 18, 2007, ironworkers helped raise the final beam in the construction 
of the Comcast Center at 17th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in downtown 
Philadelphia. The Comcast Center is currently the tallest building in the 
city at 975 ft (297.2 m). In an attempt to end the curse, workers John 
Joyce and Dan Ginion attached a small figurine of William Penn to the beam, 
along with the traditional American flag and small evergreen tree.[10] 
After the first William Penn figurine was stolen, it was replaced with 
a smaller 4-inch figure.[2] On October 29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies 
won the 2008 World Series in five games against the Tampa Bay Rays, ending 
the alleged Curse. It was the first major league professional sports title 
for the city of Philadelphia since the 1983 NBA Championship. During the 
TV coverage of parade which occurred two days later, Comcast aired an ad 
congratulating the Phillies which featured the small figurine of William 
Penn standing at the top of the Comcast Center. The city's major professional 
teams have not won a championship since the 2008 World Series. Continued 
occurrence of playoff failures for the city's teams since the Phillies' 
2008 victory may hint that the curse is still alive. The 2008 Eagles barely 
sneaked into the NFL playoffs as the 6th seed on the last week of the season 
and would upset both the Minnesota Vikings and top-seeded New York Giants 
in the playoffs, only to lose the NFC Championship game to the Arizona 
Cardinals. The Eagles have not won a playoff game since this run. The Phillies 
lost the 2009 World Series to the New York Yankees, and then were eliminated 
in the 2010 NLCS and 2011 NLDS despite having the best regular-season record 
in both years. The Phillies experienced a dramatic decline after 2011 which 
eventually forced a rebuild, and they have not returned to the playoffs 
since 2011. The 2009–10 Flyers made the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals as the 
7th seed, after overcoming a 0–3 deficit in the second round of the playoffs 
against the Boston Bruins, and lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games. 
All four of the city's major professional teams would experience a notoriously 
poor combined performance in 2015. In 2015, none of the major professional 
teams made the playoffs, and in the entire calendar year overall the teams 
won, on average, 37.5% of their games. This is the second-worst such mark 
of all time, behind (ironically) Philadelphia's major professional teams
