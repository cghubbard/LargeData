The St. Louis Cardinals 2012 season was the 131st season for the franchise 
in St. Louis, Missouri, the 121st season in the National League, and the 
seventh at Busch Stadium III. The Cardinals made their 25th trip to the 
postseason in 2012 after taking the NL Wild Card title by one game over 
the Atlanta Braves on the last day of the regular season in 2011. They 
began the 2012 season away against the Miami Marlins on April 4. St. Louis 
was coming off a 90–72 (.556) season, a second-place finish in the NL Central, 
the aforementioned wild card berth, and their National League-leading 11th 
World Series championship. In 2012, they finished with an 88–74 (.543) 
record and second place in the NL Central. By virtue of coming in second 
to the Atlanta Braves, they won the second National League Wild Card spot, 
and then beat the Braves in the Wild Card Game. They then played the NL 
East champion Washington Nationals in the NLDS and beat them in five games 
to advance to the NL Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants. 
However, they lost to the Giants in seven games after leading the series 
3 games to 1. On October 31, 2011, Tony La Russa announced his retirement 
after 16 years as manager of the Cardinals. After interviewing several 
candidates, the Cardinals announced, in a press conference on November 
14, that former Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny would be the team's new 
manager, the 49th in team history.[1] At 41, he is the youngest active 
manager in the majors. He holds the catching major league record for consecutive 
errorless games at 252, and for consecutive errorless chances with 1,565. 
On November 16, Matheny and the Cardinals announced the new coaching staff: 
Dave Duncan stayed on as the pitching coach for the 17th year as he was 
the only coach under contract, with third-base coach Jose Oquendo, hitting 
coach and former Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire, and bullpen coach Derek 
Lilliquist. 50-year-old Mike Aldrete moved from assistant hitting coach 
to bench coach. Chris Maloney also 50 years of age, moved from manager 
of the AAA Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League to first-base coach 
in St. Louis; his first time on a major league staff. Former bench coach 
Joe Pettini and first-base coach Dave McKay moved to other roles in baseball 
operations for the team.[2] On December 2, former Cardinals outfielder 
John Mabry was named assistant hitting coach.[3] On December 8, Albert 
Pujols signed a 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Angels worth $254 
million, declining a 10-year $220 million offer by the Cardinals. His old 
contract paid him $111 million over eight years from 2004−2011. Pujols 
departed among the leaders in virtually every major offensive category 
in Cardinals franchise history. At the time of the signing of the contract, 
he was fourth all-time in hits, third in runs and second in total bases, 
doubles, home runs, RBIs and walks. He was behind only Stan Musial in the 
five latter categories. He was seventh in games played and could have climbed 
as high as third with two more seasons in a Cardinals uniform.[4] He was 
paid $14,508,395 in 2011.[5] His former teammates were stunned by his decision.[6] 
On December 10, the team re-signed Rafael Furcal to a two-year deal worth 
$14 mil.[7] On December 12, the Cardinals refused to offer a contract to 
Ryan Theriot, making him a non-tendered free agent. On the same day, utilityman 
[2B/OF] Skip Schumaker accepted a two-year deal worth $3 mil. avoiding 
free agency after 2012. He was paid $4.7 mil. in his just completed two-year 
deal.[8] On December 22, the Cardinals signed outfielder Carlos Beltrán 
to a two-year deal.[9] On March 1, 2012 the Cardinals announced the extension 
of catcher Yadier Molina's expiring $7 mil. contract at the end of 2012, 
for 5 years (with a 6th year $15 mil. option for 2018) for $75 mil., making 
him the second-highest-paid catcher (to Twins catcher Joe Mauer) in all 
of baseball. He leads all catchers with 39 pickoffs since 2005, and has 
thrown out 44% of all basestealers in his eight years. He led all Cardinals 
batters in 2011 with a .305 batting average, starting more games behind 
the plate than any other catcher, and established career-highs with 55 
runs scored, 32 doubles, 14 home runs, and 65 RBIs.[10] On December 15, 
2011, the Cardinals signed 35-year-old lefty reliever J. C. Romero to a 
one-year contract.[11] The Cardinals invited nineteen players to Spring 
training camp.[12] The team finished setting its 25-man roster on March 
30. Placed on the DL were pitcher Chris Carpenter, utilityman Skip Schumaker, 
and outfielder Allen Craig.[13] On Sunday, April 22 at Pittsburgh, the 
Cardinals became the first defending world champion team since the 1922 
New York Giants to open their title defense with six consecutive series 
win.[14] They had a record of 11-5 (.688) during that streak. The series 
streak ended on April 24, with a second consecutive loss to the Cubs in 
Chicago, although winning the final game of the series on April 25. The 
Cardinals announced they would retire former manager Tony La Russa' #10 
prior to the game on May 11. His number will be the 12th retired by the 
Cardinals. He ranks third on the managers' all-time wins list with 2,728. 
1,408 of those came with the Cardinals in his 16-year tenure there, and 
his .544 winning percentage with the team is his best of the three clubs 
he managed in his 33 seasons.[15] On May 14, Carlos Beltrán was named the 
National League Player of the Week for the week of May 7–13 after posting 
six home runs, 13 RBIs, eight runs scored, 30 total bases, and a 1.200 
slugging percentage. He collected hits in five of the six games, homering 
in four of them. This is Beltran's ninth Player of the Week Award and his 
sixth in the National League. He leads the National League with 15 home 
runs, and is second in RBIs, with 32.[16] At home on May 22, Adam Wainwright 
threw his first complete game shutout since August 6, 2010, in a 4−0 victory 
over the San Diego Padres. Wainwright missed the entire 2011 season recovering 
from elbow surgery. It was his ninth career complete game and just his 
third shutout.[17] Johan Santana threw the first no-hitter in New York 
Mets' 51-year history (totaling 8,019 regular season and 74 post-season 
games previously) with an 8−0 shutout over the Cardinals and Adam Wainwright 
at Citi Field on June 1. 27,069 witnessed the no-hitter, with Santana throwing 
a career-high 134 pitches. He walked five, and struck out eight. (box score) 
Left fielder Mike Baxter robbed Yadier Molina with a great catch in the 
seventh inning for the 20th out. Umpire Adrian Johnson ruled a hard grounder 
by former Met Carlos Beltrán (in his first return to New York) down the 
third-base line 'foul' although the ball made a mark on the chalk in the 
sixth inning. Beltran subsequently grounded out to third base on the next 
pitch. The no-hitter was the eighth against the Cardinals in their long 
history, the first time by Hall-of-Famer Christy Mathewson on July 15, 
1901. The previous no-hitter against the Cardinals was by Fernando Valenzuela 
on June 29, 1990 at Dodger Stadium.[18][19] The Cardinals were also the 
first defending World Series champion to be pitched a no-hitter against 
since the Oakland Athletics in their 1990 pennant season.[20][21] On the 
opposite side, Cardinals' pitchers have thrown 10 no-hitters against opponents, 
the last one by Bud Smith against the San Diego Padres on September 3, 
2001. The Padres are now the only present team without a no-hitter. On 
June 7, Jaime García (left-hander), landed on the disabled list after his 
2-inning June 5 start with a left shoulder sprain. He is the eighth player 
on it, one-off the season high of nine—at the same time with the seven 
others which include two starting pitchers (he and Chris Carpenter), two 
relievers (Scott Linebrink and Kyle McClellan), two infielders (Lance Berkman 
and Matt Carpenter), and two outfielders (Jon Jay and Skip Schumaker).[22] 
On June 15, batting against his old team the Kansas City Royals, Carlos 
Beltrán became the first switch-hitter in MLB history to attain 300 home 
runs and 300 stolen bases, with his seventh stolen base in the second inning. 
Seven other hitters also are members of the 300-300 club.[23] Carlos Beltrán 
(of) and Rafael Furcal (ss) won the fan voting to be starters at their 
positions for the 83rd All-Star Game in Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium 
on July 10. Yadier Molina (c) was selected by the players as a reserve 
for his fourth consecutive year; he ranked second in the voting to starter 
Buster Posey. Lance Lynn was also selected by the players as a reserve 
pitcher; his first time going to the All-Star Game. Retired Cardinals' 
manager Tony La Russa will un-retire for the one game. Coaches Derek Lilliquist, 
Jose Oquendo and Mark McGwire will also be participating in the event, 
as all are members of La Russa's All-Star staff. Former St. Louis coaches 
Joe Pettini, Dave McKay and Dave Duncan are members of that coaching staff, 
as well. Beltran is leading the NL with 61 RBIs, and second in home runs 
with 20. He also ranks in the top 10 with a .310 batting average. It will 
be his fourth time as an All-Star fan-vote starter, seventh overall.[24] 
As an added bonus for Beltran, he was also picked to participate in the 
Home Run Derby contest on July 9, the night before the All-Star Game. It 
will be the first time for him in that fan-favorite event.[25] On July 
6, after the passing of Yadier Molina's wife's grandfather, he left the 
team to join his family in Puerto Rico and was put on the bereavement list. 
He will miss the three weekend games and won't participate in the All-Star 
game. Matt Holliday was picked by Tony La Russa to replace him on the roster. 
Bryan Anderson was recalled from AAA-Memphis to replace Molina on the Cardinals' 
roster, with Tony Cruz to start as catcher for the weekend games.[26] After 
the rosters were opened to the fans, voting was held to decide the final 
fan-voted addition to each team. The online balloting was conducted from 
Sunday afternoon, July 1, through Thursday afternoon, July 5. The winners 
of the final vote were David Freese of the St. Louis Cardinals (NL), and 
Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers (AL). Chipper Jones, of the Atlanta Braves, 
was removed from the ballot on July 3 after he replaced Matt Kemp on the 
roster due to Kemp's injury.[27] The 83rd All-Star Game on July 10, at 
Kansas City's Kaufmann Stadium was an 8-0 blowout for the National League, 
its sixth shutout win against two shutout losses for the NL. It made retired 
manager Tony La Russa the first manager to win All-Star Games in both leagues. 
He was 3-0 in the AL, but 0-2 in the NL before this year's game.[28] La 
Russa emphasized this was his final game as a manager.[29][30] On July 
3, the team and disabled pitcher Chris Carpenter decided he will have season-ending 
surgery to repair his thoracic outlet syndrome that has plagued him all 
year with nerve-related shoulder problems. Recovery time is estimated at 
six months, so if done this month he will be ready for spring training 
in February 2013.[31] Surgery is set for July 19, performed by Dr. Gregory 
Pearl in Dallas, Texas.[32] On July 16, Trevor Rosenthal was called up 
for the first time to the major leagues, and made his debut in the eighth 
inning on July 18, the 2,000th player in Cardinals' history. No other franchise 
in baseball has reached 2,000.[33] On July 21, at home against the Cubs, 
a 0−0 tight game started by Jake Westbrook (8-8, after getting the win 
in 7 inn.) was broken in the bottom of the seventh with a 12-run explosion 
by the Cardinals, won by that 12−0 score with 16 hits against only 4 for 
the Cubs. The inning-explosion featured 7 doubles, tying a major-league 
record set by the (NL) 1936 Boston Bees (against the Cardinals at Sportsmen's 
Park, first inning on August 25), 17 batters with 10 hits including a triple, 
2 singles, 2 walks, and a wild pitch. David Freese started the inning with 
an infield single. Allen Craig then got one of his two doubles that inning, 
and the merry-go-round was on. The 12-runs in an inning also tied the highest 
runs in any inning by a Cardinals' team since the 1926 club did it in the 
third inning against the Phillies on September 15. Gameday Recap [34] The 
club got 27 total bases and 9 doubles in the game—the last time they did 
that was on July 12, 1931.[35] The team made a trade on the last day of 
the non-waiver deadline, July 31, sending minor-league third baseman Zack 
Cox to the Miami Marlins for minor-league relief pitcher Edward Mujica.[36] 
On August 3, Lance Berkman went on the disabled list for the third time 
this season with knee problems.[37] Matt Holliday got his 1,500th career 
hit on August 30. Yadier Molina got his 1,000th career hit on September 
4, a rare infield single. Shelby Miller got his first major league win 
as a reliever, in a crucial fourth game of the series, in the 12th-inning 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 16.[38] On September 17, the 
Cardinals announced they were moving their short-season affiliation with 
the Batavia (NY) Muckdogs to the State College (PA) Spikes in the same 
New York–Penn League.[39] On September 19, the Cardinals announced they 
were moving their low-A team from Quad Cities (Iowa) back to Peoria (Illinois) 
where they had the team from 1995–2004, in the Midwest League.[40] On September 
19, David Freese and Yadier Molina hit their 20th home runs of the seasons. 
It marked the first time in Cardinals' history that five players have hit 
20 home runs in a season, with the shutout win against the Houston Astros. 
Carlos Beltrán (29), Matt Holliday (27), and Allen Craig (21) reached 20 
previously.[41] On September 20, the Cardinals went over the 3 million 
attendance figure for the ninth consecutive year.[42] On September 21, 
Chris Carpenter returned to the rotation for the first time this season 
after surgery in July, refuting doctors' predictions of no pitching possible 
in 2012. He faced 22 batters (77 pitches, 47 strikes) in pitching five 
innings, giving up five hits (incl. a double and triple) and two runs, 
hitting one batter, walking one, and striking out two against the Chicago 
Cubs in Chicago, leading 3−2 after the fifth inning, but Fernando Salas 
blew the save for him with two-outs and two strikes in the ninth when leading 
4–2, and the team lost in 11 innings.[42][43][44] "My stuff wasn't as sharp 
as I'd like, it wasn't even as sharp as it's been in those simulated games", 
said Carpenter, who preceded this start with four simulated games. "I did 
the best I could to get as many outs as I could and give us a chance. It 
was fun to go out there. It's definitely something I can build on, and 
hopefully my stuff is sharper as I get out there more often." [45] On September 
23, Pete Kozma hit his first home run. The next game on the 24th he hit 
his second home run. On September 24, closer Jason Motte was named NL Player 
of the Week after saving all five of the Cardinals' wins in the week of 
September 17–23, and is leading the NL in saves with his 40th. He became 
the first closer with the Cardinals to save 40 games since Jason Isringhausen 
in 2004. It was the first time he has won that award, and the first time 
a closer had won it since Huston Street in 2009.[46][47] On October 2, 
despite losing in their 161st game with a chance to clinch in front of 
almost 40,000 fans, the team later clinched the second wild-card spot when 
the Los Angeles Dodgers lost to their arch-rival San Francisco Giants.[48][49] 
For the last game of the season at home on October 3, Shelby Miller, who 
started 2012 as the club's top prospect, made his major league debut as 
a starter against the Cincinnati Reds. He has already had five appearances 
(1-0, 2.35 ERA) in 7.2 IP as a reliever.[50] Infielders Coaches LEAGUE

Sunday, October 14, 2012 – 8:15 p.m. (EDT) at AT&T Park in San Francisco, 
California[59] Game 1 was a nail biter. Carlos Beltrán hit his 14th career 
postseason homer and David Freese also went deep as the Cardinals took 
a 6–4 lead over the San Francisco Giants after six innings of the NL championship 
series opener. Freese hit a two-run homer in the second and Beltrán followed 
with one in the fourth as the Cardinals knocked out Madison Bumgarner with 
six runs in 3 2⁄3 innings. Bumgarner breezed through a perfect first inning 
but ran into trouble in the second when Yadier Molina singled on an 0–2 
pitch with one out. Freese then drove a 3–2 pitch over the wall in left-center 
to give the Cardinals a 2–0 lead. That gave Freese 25 career RBIs in the 
postseason and tied him with Molina for third most ever for the Cardinals. 
Bumgarner then couldn't make it out of the fourth. Descalso doubled and 
scored on Pete Kozma's double. Jon Jay added a two-out RBI single and Beltrán 
ended Bumgarner's night with the homer. George Kontos got out of the fourth 
and Tim Lincecum pitched two hitless innings as he once again excelled 
in his new role out of the bullpen. Lance Lynn struggled to hold onto that 
lead in his first postseason start after 10 career relief appearances. 
After starting the game with three hitless innings, Lynn ran into trouble 
with two outs and a runner on first in the fourth. Hunter Pence and Brandon 
Belt followed with singles to drive in San Francisco's first run. They 
both scored on Gregor Blanco's triple. Brandon Crawford followed with an 
RBI double to make it 6–4 and Lynn left after walking pinch-hitter Aubrey 
Huff. Joe Kelly got out of the jam when second baseman Daniel Descalso 
made a diving stop of Ángel Pagán's grounder up the middle. No runs were 
scored for the remainder of the contest. Monday, October 15, 2012 – 8:07 p.m.
