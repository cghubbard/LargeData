Floyd Clifford "Bill" Bevens (October 21, 1916 – October 26, 1991) was 
a right-handed Major League Baseball pitcher. He stood 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) 
and weighed 210 lb (95 kg). He signed with the New York Yankees at 20 in 
1937, and spent seven seasons in their minor league system, throwing two 
no-hitters for the Wenatchee Chiefs before finally making his major league 
debut with the Yankees on May 12, 1944 at the age of 27. In his third minor 
league season, he pitched his first no-hitter on September 21, 1939, against 
the Tacoma Tigers, winning 8-0 with the only opposing baserunner reaching 
on an error, giving his Wenatchee Chiefs their first playoff win after 
losing the first three games of the series to Tacoma.[1] He pitched four 
years for the Yanks when they finally brought him up to the majors, amassing 
a career record of 40–36 with a 3.08 ERA. His best year was 1946, when 
he went 16–13 and 2.23. Although in the regular 1947 season, his last year 
in the majors, he won only seven and lost 13, in the World Series that 
year he held the Brooklyn Dodgers to one hit in 8 2/3 innings in one of 
the most memorable games in baseball history (see "The Cookie Game"). For 
8 2⁄3 innings in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series Bevens had held the Dodgers 
hitless despite giving up a Series record ten walks. The Yankees were nursing 
a 2–1 lead. With one out to go for the first no-hitter in Series history, 
he walked right fielder Carl Furillo and then (intentionally) pinch-hitter 
Pete Reiser. Dodger manager Burt Shotton sent in Al Gionfriddo to pinch-run 
for Furillo and Eddie Miksis for the injury-slowed Reiser, and aging Cookie 
Lavagetto to pinch-hit for leadoff man Eddie Stanky. With two outs and 
two on in the bottom of the ninth, Lavagetto swung and missed for strike 
one but then on Bevens' second (and last) pitch lined a double off the 
right field wall scoring both runners and winning the game for the Dodgers 
3-2 with their only hit.[2] What became known as "the Cookie game" was 
played on October 3, 1947 and evened the Series at 2–2. On October 6, Bevens 
returned to the mound for 2 2/3 innings of scoreless relief in the deciding 
Game 7, winning the world championship for the Yanks. It was the last major 
league game for the thirty-year-old Bevens. "I do not use anything odd 
or unorthodox. I have a sinker, but it is a natural delivery. Fast ball, 
curve, change, and change in speeds. That is my repertoire." – Bill Bevens 
in Baseball Magazine (June 1947, Daniel M. Daniel) He eventually landed 
another major league job with the Cincinnati Reds in 1952, but was sold 
to the Triple-A Pacific Coast League San Francisco Seals before he could
