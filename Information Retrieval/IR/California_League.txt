The California League is a Minor League Baseball league which operates 
throughout California. it is classified at the Class A-Advanced, three 
steps below Major League Baseball. Most players reach this level in their 
third or fourth year of professional play. All of the current teams are 
playing in stadiums that have been built or extensively renovated since 
1990. League attendance continues to increase each season, with over one 
million fans attending games per year, part of a general nationwide growth 
and expansion to smaller towns, cities and regions below those in the National 
League or American League with minor league baseball at various levels 
of play in growing popularity in the last few decades. The League is divided 
into a Northern Division and a Southern Division. The California League 
will contract from ten to eight teams in the 2017 season as the Bakersfield 
Blaze and the High Desert Mavericks will cease operations.[1] There were 
various attempts in the late 1800s and early 1900s to form a "California 
League" on the West Coast, considering the distance of the two current 
major leagues which generally had teams only in the Northeast and were 
restricted at first until World War I by long distance train travel. The 
first organized California League lasted from 1887–1889, then another followed 
in 1891, and 1893, and finally in 1899–1902. After the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues, an organization of minor leagues was 
formed in 1902, (following the "truce" and agreements between the older 
National League of 1876 and the newly "upstart" American League of 1901), 
the California League operated outside the NAPBL system as an independent 
league in 1902 and again from 1907–1909. This led to huge differences in 
the quality of teams competing with each other. In 1907, the San Francisco 
team was 3-34, while later in 1908 San Francisco was 9-67 and Oakland was 
4-71. Oakland and San Francisco competed in every year of these various 
state leagues, with San Francisco having two teams during 1887-88. The 
current California League was founded in 1941, and included teams in Anaheim, 
Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced, Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, 
and Stockton. The following year, as a result of World War II, the league 
dropped to four teams, then ceased and suspended operations altogether, 
although major league baseball and some minor leagues continued as much 
as possible with limited availability of players during the war years. 
It reorganized and came back in 1946, adding teams in Visalia, San Jose, 
and Ventura by 1947. Further east, Reno, Nevada joined the league in 1955 
with the movement of the old Channel Cities Oilers in Santa Barbara and 
continued as a member for 37 years. Year by Year list of league champions: 
The Los Angeles area, Riverside, San Bernardino, Palm Springs, Yuma (AZ) 
and Las Vegas (NV) were also major league spring training site cities, 
as well possessed California League teams on different occasions. [2] Modesto 
has hosted a California League team longer than any other city, hosting 
a team in all but two of the CL's 65 seasons. In 2016, the California League 
announced the establishment of a league Hall of Fame.[3] There were 15
