Bret Robert Boone (born April 6, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball 
second baseman. During his career Boone was a three-time All-Star, four-time 
Gold Glove winner, and two-time Silver Slugger Award winner. He is a member 
of the Boone family, one of the most recognizable families in baseball. 
Boone was born in El Cajon, California to Susan G. Roel and former major 
league player and manager Bob Boone. He is also the grandson of former 
major leaguer Ray Boone and brother of former major leaguer Aaron Boone, 
as well as the descendant of pioneer Daniel Boone.[1] As a child, Boone 
hung out in the Phillies clubhouse with Pete Rose Jr., his brother Aaron, 
Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw.[2] He is a graduate of El Dorado High School 
and the University of Southern California. In 1992, Boone became the first-ever 
third-generation big-leaguer in baseball history. As a member of an All-Star 
family, he is the son of Bob, a catcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
California Angels and Kansas City Royals (1972–1990) and later a manager 
with the Royals and Cincinnati Reds; his brother Aaron is a third baseman 
who has played with the Reds, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Florida 
Marlins,and Houston Astros. His grandfather Ray was an infielder for the 
Indians, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, Kansas City Athletics, Milwaukee 
Braves and Boston Red Sox (1948–1960). On the last day of the 1998 season, 
the Reds helped him make baseball trivia history by starting the only infield 
ever composed of two sets of brothers: first baseman Stephen Larkin, second 
baseman Bret Boone, shortstop Barry Larkin, and third baseman Aaron Boone. 
Boone started his playing career with the Seattle Mariners where he set 
the club record for home runs in a season by second baseman in 1993 (12 
in 76 games)[3] but was traded that same year to the Cincinnati Reds along 
with Erik Hanson. In 2001 Boone returned to the Seattle Mariners, the organization 
with which he came up from 1990 to 1993.[4] Now an All-Star—having averaged 
21 home runs a year from 1998 through 2000, twice reaching a career high 
in doubles (at 38, in 1998 and 1999) -- Boone's superior play continued 
as he led the league in runs batted in (141), while producing a batting 
average of (.331). He also broke the Mariners' team record of home runs 
for a second baseman with his 37 home runs while hitting 37 doubles. Boone 
started in the All Star Game in Seattle, received a Silver Slugger Award 
and finished third in the AL MVP voting. His Mariners paced the league 
with a record 116 wins, earning the AL West championship and advancing 
to the ALCS, tying the all-time team record for wins in a season with the 
1906 Chicago Cubs. The following year Boone won a Gold Glove for his defense 
and continued to show the power he had demonstrated the previous years, 
hitting 24 home runs with 34 doubles. On May 2, 2002, Boone and teammate 
Mike Cameron became the first teammates to each hit two home runs in a 
single inning, doing so in the first inning against the White Sox. With 
local media and behind the scenes he was famous for his humorous behavior. 
Boone took up not one but three lockers, as Erick Walker notes, "one for 
him, another with a nameplate above that read 'Boone's friend' and a third 
with a nameplate that read 'Boone's friend's friend' that was scattered 
with about 100 bats."[5] He was designated for assignment by the Seattle 
Mariners on July 3, 2005, and later traded on July 11 to Minnesota for 
cash and a player (minor league pitcher Andy Baldwin) to be named later. 
Minnesota released Boone on August 1 after only 14 games, where the second 
baseman struggled with a .221 batting average, with 7 home runs and 37 
RBI in 88 games for the Mariners and Twins. On January 4, 2006, Boone signed 
a minor league contract with the New York Mets. He received an invitation 
to spring training, but on March 1, only a few days into spring training, 
he announced his initial retirement from baseball, citing a lack of passion 
for the game.[6] On February 18, 2008, Boone came out of retirement and 
signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals.[7] At first 
he was assigned to the minor league camp, but after five days, he was invited 
to the team's major league spring training camp.[8] On March 21, 2008, 
Boone was reassigned to minor league camp after hitting .189 and began 
the season with the Columbus Clippers, the Nationals Triple-A affiliate.[9] 
He had hoped to get signed by a major league club, and left the Clippers 
in late April to work out on his own. However, on May 28, he once again 
announced his retirement.[10] On March 9, 2010, he was named manager of 
the Victoria Seals of the Golden Baseball League. On May 27, 2010, after 
managing just four games, the Seals announced Boone was leaving the team 
permanently to deal with "family matters". Bret Boone had his best years 
as a Seattle Mariner, where he is still a fan favorite. He finished his 
career with a .266 batting average, 252 home runs and 1,021 RBI in 1,780 
games in 14 Major League seasons. He was a three-time All-Star, four-time 
Gold Glove winner, and participated in 2 Home Run Derbies. Jose Canseco, 
in his book "Juiced", accused Boone of steroid use, saying that in a 2001 
spring training game he was stunned at Boone's physique, and the two chatted 
about what Boone was taking. However, Boone has denied taking steroids, 
or having any such conversation with Canseco, pointing out that he never 
played against Canseco during the 2001 spring training.[11] Despite Boone's 
claim that he never played against Canseco in the spring of 2001, his Seattle 
Mariners did in fact play the Anaheim Angels six times during spring training 
of that year.[12] However, Canseco never reached second base in any of 
those games, where the conversation is alleged to have occurred.[13] Canseco
