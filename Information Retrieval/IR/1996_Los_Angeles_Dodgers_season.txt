KABC Vin Scully, Ross Porter, Rick Monday The 1996 season saw the Dodgers 
remain atop the standings most of the season. However, longtime manager 
Tommy Lasorda suffered a heart attack in mid-season and had to step down. 
Bill Russell, Lasorda's bench coach and a former Dodger player, was chosen 
to manage the rest of the season. The Dodgers went into the final weekend 
of the season with a two-game lead on the San Diego Padres, needing only 
to win one of the final three games with the Padres to clinch the National 
League Western Division crown. However, the Padres swept the Dodgers and 
they limped into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. 1996 Los Angeles Dodgers
