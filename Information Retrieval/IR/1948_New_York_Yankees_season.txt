The 1948 New York Yankees season was the team's 46th season in New York 
and its 48th overall. The team finished with a record of 94–60, finishing 
2.5 games behind the Cleveland Indians and 1.5 games behind the second-place 
Boston Red Sox. New York was managed by Bucky Harris. The Yankees played 
their home games at Yankee Stadium. The fractional games-behind came about 
due to the frenzied pennant race, which saw the Yankees, Red Sox and Indians 
all battling it out to the end. The Yankees fell just a little short, and 
the Red Sox and Indians finished in a tie for first at 96–58. They held 
a one-game playoff, which counted as part of the regular season, so the 
Indians' victory raised their record to 97–58, and dropped the Red Sox 
to 96–59. The Yankees did not renew Bucky Harris' contract after the season, 
opting instead to hire Casey Stengel starting in 1949. This move raised 
some eyebrows, but Stengel had just led the Oakland Oaks to the Pacific 
Coast League pennant in 1948, demonstrating that with good talent, he had 
a good chance to succeed. The Yankees were about to begin the most dominating 
stretch of their long dynasty. On July 26, 1948, Babe Ruth attended the 
premiere of the film The Babe Ruth Story, a biopic about his life. William 
Bendix portrayed Ruth. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital 
for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually 
became worse, and in his last days, scores of reporters and photographers 
hovered around the hospital. Only a few visitors were allowed to see him, 
one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball, 
Ford Frick. "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big 
man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard", 
Frick said years later. On August 16, the day after Frick's visit, Babe 
Ruth died at age 53. His body lay in repose in Yankee Stadium. His funeral 
was two days later at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. Ruth was then 
buried in the Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven in Hawthorne, New York. At 
his death, the New York Times called Babe Ruth, "a figure unprecedented 
in American life. A born showman off the field and a marvelous performer 
on it, he had an amazing flair for doing the spectacular at the most dramatic 
moment."[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Coaches
