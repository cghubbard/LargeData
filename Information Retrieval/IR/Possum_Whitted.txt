George Bostic "Possum" Whitted (February 4, 1890 – October 16, 1962) was 
an outfielder and third baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals (1912–14), 
Boston Braves (1914), Philadelphia Phillies (1915–19), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1919–21) and Brooklyn Robins (1922). Whitted was born in Durham, North 
Carolina. In 1914, Whitted was a member of the Braves team that went from 
last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win 
a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[1] The team 
then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics 
in the 1914 World Series. He played for the Phillies in 1915, which won 
the National League Pennant. He was the first rookie in history to start 
at every position (except pictcher and catcher) during the season. In 11 
seasons he played in 1,025 games and had 3,630 at bats, 440 runs, 978 hits, 
145 doubles, 60 triples, 23 home runs, 451 RBI, 116 stolen bases, 215 walks, 
.269 batting average, .313 on-base percentage, .361 slugging percentage, 
1,312 total bases and 180 sacrifice hits. He died in Wilmington, North 
Carolina at the age of 72 from complications from a hip injury sustained 
in a fall. As a United States Army Sergeant First Class in the Quartermaster 
Corps during World War I, he was buried at the Wilmington National Cemetery.[2]
