WCIU-TV, virtual channel 26 (UHF digital channel 27), is an independent 
television station located in Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is the 
flagship television station of Weigel Broadcasting, and is a sister station 
to MeTV owned-and-operated station WWME-CD (channel 23) and fellow independent 
outlet WMEU-CD (channel 48), both fellow Weigel properties that are respectively 
relayed on the station's second and third digital subchannels. All three 
stations share studio facilities located on Halsted Street (between Washington 
Boulevard and Madison Street) in the Greektown neighborhood; WCIU's transmitter 
is located atop the Willis Tower on South Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop. 
Founded by John J. Weigel,[1] the station first signed on the air on February 
6, 1964, and has been owned by Weigel Broadcasting since its inception. 
WCIU has spent much of its history carrying multi-ethnic entertainment 
programming. At its sign-on, channel 26 operated as an independent station. 
Local businessman Howard Shapiro, who founded appliance store chain C.E.T. 
(Chicago Engineers for Television) and held a minority interest in the 
station, took over Weigel Broadcasting and WCIU in 1966.[2] From the late 
1960s until 1985, WCIU carried religious programs during the early morning 
hours. The station ran The Stock Market Observer – a business news block 
similar in format to the present-day cable channel CNBC – from about 8:00 
a.m. to 3:30 p.m. each weekday; the service broadcast from the trading 
floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, with WCIU originally maintaining studio 
facilities at the top floor of the Chicago Board of Trade Building on West 
Jackson Boulevard. After 5:00 p.m. each weekday, the station ran Spanish 
language entertainment programming – including controversial bullfighting 
matches – from the Spanish International Network (the forerunner to Univision). 
During the weekend, WCIU ran a blend of religious programs, Spanish language 
programs, paid programming and various other ethnically-oriented shows. 
From 1966 to 1970, the station aired Kiddie A-Go-Go, a children's puppet 
and dance program which was hosted by Elaine Mulqueen.[3] Several popular 
musical groups performed on the show, including The Four Seasons and New 
Colony Six.[4] In 1970, channel 26 became the birthplace of the groundbreaking 
African American music program Soul Train, hosted by its creator (and then-WCIU 
station employee) Don Cornelius. The show later entered into national syndication 
and moved production to Los Angeles the following year, although WCIU continued 
to produce a local version of Soul Train exclusively for the Chicago market 
until 1976, initially and simultaneously with the Los Angeles-based version, 
with Cornelius himself as host, succeeded by Clinton Ghent, the main producer 
under Cornelius.[5][6] After WXXW (channel 20, allocation now occupied 
by PBS member station WYCC) – the second-to-last television station in 
the market that continued to broadcast in black-and-white – went dark in 
1974, channel 26 remained the only television station in Chicago that still 
broadcast its programming in monochrome. Just prior to the Christmas season 
of 1974, the station installed and tested color transmission equipment, 
which broadcast on a low-power relay station located in Lincoln Park. In 
November 1974, the color and black-and-white signals traded transmitter 
facilities for the remainder of the holiday season; on December 31, 1974, 
the translator was taken offline as channel 26 started to broadcast in 
color full-time. In the summer of 1985, the SIN affiliation moved to WSNS-TV 
(channel 44); WCIU, meanwhile, became affiliated part-time with NetSpan 
– which would eventually evolve into Telemundo – shortly thereafter. Later 
in the 1980s, Weigel Broadcasting expanded coverage of WCIU-TV to areas 
of western Illinois, northwest Indiana and southeastern Wisconsin through 
translator stations. In 1983, the station signed on W55AS (channel 55, 
now WBME-CD on channel 41) to relay WCIU's programming into the Milwaukee 
market. In 1987, WCIU launched two additional translators, W33AR (channel 
33, now WFBN-LD) in Rockford, Illinois (which was converted into a simulcast 
of sister station WYTU-LD (channel 63) in Milwaukee in August 2012, to 
provide Telemundo programming into the Rockford market, as WSNS provides 
weak to rimshot signal coverage to that area; Telemundo eventually moved 
to the station's second subchannel to accommodate TouchVision, followed 
by H&I currently) and W12BK (channel 69, now MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYS-LD) 
in South Bend, Indiana. On October 13, 1988, WSNS-TV announced that it 
would switch its affiliation to Telemundo after that station's affiliation 
agreement with Univision concluded on December 31; two months later on 
December 16, WCIU – whose contract with Telemundo was set to expire the 
following month – signed an affiliation agreement with Univision, returning 
the station to that network after two years. The two stations switched 
affiliations on January 10, 1989.[7][8] In 1993, Univision asked WCIU to 
drop all of its English-language programming, including Stock Market Observer, 
and carry the network's programming full-time. WCIU refused, which led 
Univision to purchase then-English language independent station WGBO-TV 
(channel 66) from Combined Broadcasting for $35 million on January 10, 
1994, with the intent of moving its programming there the following January. 
That summer, Howard Shapiro hired Neal Sabin – former program director 
at WPWR-TV (channel 50) – as WCIU's vice president and general manager, 
who decided to remake WCIU into a general entertainment independent station. 
On December 31, 1994, WCIU switched to an English language general entertainment 
format full-time and rebranded as "The U".[9][10][11][12][13][14] Upon 
the conversion, channel 26 picked up most of WGBO's syndicated programming 
inventory, along with newly purchased shows that were not carried by any 
of the other Chicago stations; it also moved its remaining ethnic programming 
to low-powered sister station WFBT-CA (channel 23, now WWME-CD).[13] Channel 
26's programming began to feature mostly classic sitcoms and drama series 
(such as The Munsters, Gilligan's Island, Hogan's Heroes, The Rockford 
Files and Leave It to Beaver). The station also revived the horror/sci-fi 
movie showcase Svengoolie, which had previously run in the market on WFLD 
(channel 32) in two different incarnations between 1973 and that station's 
conversion into a Fox owned-and-operated station in 1986; Rich Koz – who 
reprised the role he previously played in WFLD's Son of Svengoolie for 
WCIU's revival of the showcase – also co-hosted the station's New Year's 
Eve relaunch celebration on December 31, 1994, alongside controversial 
talk show host Morton Downey Jr. (who himself hosted a short-lived talk 
show on the station, Downey, which briefly aired nationally on CNBC later 
in 1995) and served as one of the "U'z Guys," a group of hosts for various 
blocks of the station's programming.[2][14] Initially, the station continued 
to run the Stock Market Observer from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and entertainment 
programming in all other weekday timeslots and throughout much of the broadcast 
day on weekends. WCIU then added a weekday block of children's programs 
from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. in March 1995. On February 19, 1995, WCIU signed 
a multi-year agreement with The WB to carry the network's children's program 
block, Kids' WB, upon its debut on September 9, 1995. The WB's primary 
affiliate in the market, WGN-TV (channel 9), opted not to carry the block 
and continued to run its morning newscast and an afternoon sitcom block 
in the time slots where Kids' WB would normally air on other WB affiliates 
(ironically, WGN's superstation feed for cable providers outside of the 
Chicago area and satellite providers nationwide carried Kids' WB programming, 
in addition to The WB's prime time schedule). The agreement also allowed 
WCIU to carry WB prime time programming in the event that WGN-TV chose 
to pre-empt it in order to air Cubs, White Sox and Bulls evening games.[15][16] 
In order to make room for the Kids' WB block, the full Stock Market Observer 
broadcast moved to WFBT-CA as "WebFN", a joint venture between Weigel and 
Bridge Information Systems (which also aired on Milwaukee sister station 
WMLW-CA), on September 9. The weekday business news programming was then 
reduced to a 3½-hour block from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., a move panned 
by some viewers; although it cited that Weigel had "no intention of killing" 
the program, Sabin cited the program's niche format and limited ratings 
and revenue for the block's shift to WFBT, in order for channel 26 to carry 
more profitable entertainment programming.[17][18] "WebFN" would eventually 
feature several anchors formerly employed with WMAQ radio (670 AM) after 
that station was replaced by sports talk outlet WSCR in 2000. In the spring 
of 1995, WCIU and sister station WFBT-CA (channel 23, now WWME-CD) moved 
their operations from the Chicago Board of Trade building into a 64,000 
square feet (1.5 acres) studio facility at 30 North Halsted Street in Chicago's 
Near West Side community.[19] By the late 1990s, WCIU began adding more 
recent sitcoms; the station began to add more syndicated first-run talk 
and reality shows onto its daytime lineup in 2000. In September 2002, WCIU 
dropped the afternoon children's block, reducing children's programming 
to the morning hours. In September 2004, the station dropped the Kids' 
WB weekday and Saturday blocks, which moved to WGN-TV, resulting in that 
station clearing the entire WB network schedule for the first time. Classic 
sitcoms gradually disappeared from WCIU's schedule between 2001 and 2004 
(some of these programs would find their way onto WFBT when it began running 
a classic television programming block called "Me-TV", which would become 
that station's full-time format under the callsign WWME-CA on January 1, 
2005). Early in 2005, the business news format was scaled back to include 
only the existing syndicated program First Business, which Weigel had assumed 
production responsibilities for in 2003 after WebFN went bankrupt.[20] 
That program continued until the end of 2014 under Weigel ownership, and 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange took over responsibilities for the program 
after that; it is currently known as Business First AM with Angela Miles 
and now airs locally on the City Colleges-owned public television station 
WYCC (channel 20). The station's digital channel is multiplexed: In July 
2008, Weigel Broadcasting announced the creation of This TV, a national 
subchannel network operated as a joint venture between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
and Weigel.[24] This TV officially launched with WCIU as its flagship station 
(airing on digital subchannel 26.5) on November 1, 2008.[25] This TV moved 
to the third digital subchannel of WGN-TV on November 1, 2013, as a result 
of the May 13, 2013 announcement that WGN owner Tribune Broadcasting would 
acquire Weigel's 50% ownership interest in This TV.[26][27] Bounce TV (which 
was already carried on WWME-CD 26.2) began to occupy This TV's former subchannel, 
moving from WWME 23.2 to WCIU 26.5. On December 1, 2010, WCIU dropped its 
ethnic programming service FBT on digital subchannel 26.6 and replaced 
it a simulcast of the station's main channel. Two weeks later on December 
15, the 26.6 subchannel was dropped and its programming was shifted to 
digital channel 26.2 (replacing a simulcast of sister station WWME-CA, 
which moved to WCIU digital subchannel 26.3) where it continued to simulcast 
most of WCIU's main programming. In addition, PSIP channel 48.1 was discontinued 
(to be later used by the digital signal of WMEU-CA) while 23.1 reverted 
to being the virtual channel number for WWME-CA (23.2 was also discontinued 
at that time; it has since been restored, and now serves as an affiliate 
of Heroes & Icons). On January 4, 2011, MGM and Weigel Broadcasting announced 
plans to turn the MeTV format that originated on sister station WWME-CA 
into a national network.[28][29] The national MeTV service launched on 
WWME and WCIU digital subchannel 26.3 on December 15, 2010. The following 
day on January 5, digital subchannel 26.2 was relaunched with its own general 
entertainment format, branded as "The U Too".[22][23] The service features 
some time-shifted programming from WCIU's main channel, including some 
syndicated programs not seen in the Chicago market prior to the format 
conversion. It also broadcast a handful of DePaul Blue Demons and other 
basketball games from the "old" Big East Conference; "The U Too" currently 
serves as the over-the-air broadcaster of WNBA games from the Chicago Sky 
and AHL hockey games from the Chicago Wolves.[30][31] From January 10, 
2011 to September 2013, The U Too subchannel was also simulcast on the 
analog signal of WWME-CA until The U Too began broadcasting in high definition 
on WMEU-CD channel 48.1 (the 26.2 version of the U Too signal remains in 
16:9 standard definition widescreen). Currently, WWME-CA's analog signal 
simulcasts Heroes & Icons as aired on digital subchannel 26.4. On June 
12, 2009, the date of the federally mandated switch from analog to digital 
television for full-power stations, WCIU-TV shut down its analog signal. 
The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 
27.[32] However, through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers 
are displaying WCIU-TV's virtual channel as 26. From June 13, 2009 to January 
9, 2011, WCIU-TV's main programming was simulcast on sister station WWME-CA 
(channel 23) to provide a nightlight service as the low-power station continued 
to operate an analog signal. From June 13 to July 12, 2009, the station 
ran newscasts from WMAQ-TV and WGN-TV for viewers that either were not 
ready for the digital transition or had problems receiving WGN and WMAQ's 
signals after the June 12 digital transition.[33] WWME-CA continues to 
operate an analog signal on UHF channel 23, which is currently affiliated 
with sister network Heroes & Icons.[34] Syndicated programs broadcast on 
WCIU-TV (as of September 2016[update]) include The Jerry Springer Show, 
America's Court with Judge Ross, Judge Alex, The Verdict With Glenda Hatchett, 
T.D. Jakes, Dr. Phil, and The Steve Wilkos Show. WCIU-TV serves as the 
flagship station for Judge Mathis which is taped in Chicago. WCIU-TV also 
carries the Go Time syndication E/I block, as did to other Weigel Broadcasting 
stations that carrying the E/I syndication block. The station has broadcast 
many locally produced programs over the years; among them include Ultrascope 
(a program sponsored by Sears that was used to sell UHF-capable televisions 
and boxes within their Chicago area stores, and featured a format similar 
to Music Choice featuring a clock/album cover display and album audio which 
aired daily from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), Ted and the Angel (a talk show 
hosted by Ted Weber and Angel Tompkins from 1967 to 1968, which was nominated 
for a Regional Emmy Award in its first year; Weber later hosted two other 
WCIU programs, Ted Weber In Old Town and The C.E.T. Amateur Hour). The 
Homework Show (1995–2006), U Dance with B96 (an American Bandstand-style 
music/dance show hosted by DJs from WBBM-FM, 1995–1997),[2] Stooge-A-Palooza 
(a showcase of Three Stooges shorts with Rich Koz, 2003–2010),[35] Soul 
Train (1970–1976, local version only; nationally syndicated version from 
Los Angeles was seen from 1971 to 2006, locally on WBBM-TV and later, WGN-TV),[35] 
The Bob Lewandowski Show, (1964–1995), Outdoor Sportsman (1978–1985; originally 
aired on WSNS-TV, it was produced and hosted by local outdoorsman Joe Wyer), 
Stock Market Observer (1968–2000), WebFN (2000–2003, replaced the Stock 
Market Observer), Kiddie-A-Go-Go (1964–1967), Western Theatre with Two 
Ton Baker (1964–1965), Marty Faye Show, The Chicago Party (c. 1982), Eddie 
Korosa's Polka Party (c. 1978) and First Business (a business news program 
which Weigel took over production in 2003, replacing WebFN, and syndicated 
nationally through MGM Television until 2014).[20] Current local programs 
seen on WCIU include the horror/sci-fi film showcase Svengoolie (which 
is syndicated to MeTV and other Weigel stations), religious program Rock 
of Ages and the children's program Green Screen Adventures (which also 
syndicated to MeTV, This TV and other Weigel stations).[36] On July 8, 
1999, WGN-TV and WCIU-TV entered into a programming arrangement involving 
sports coverage, which allowed channel 26 to carry select Chicago Bulls 
basketball and White Sox baseball games, and a handful of Cubs baseball 
games that are produced by and contracted to air on WGN-TV, due to that 
station's network affiliation contracts (with The CW and previously The 
WB) that limit the number of programming preemptions that WGN-TV is allowed 
on an annual basis, and rights restrictions enforced by the NBA which limited 
the number of Bulls telecasts aired on WGN's national superstation feed 
WGN America – prior to that channel's removal of WGN-produced programs 
upon its conversion into a basic cable channel in December 2014 – to fifteen 
games per season.[37][38][39][40][41] Sports broadcasts on WCIU were previously 
branded under the "BullsNet", "CubsNet" and "SoxNet" banners until 2010, 
when they were rebranded under the umbrella title WGN Sports on The U. 
In 2011, all White Sox, Bulls and Cubs games televised on WCIU began to 
be syndicated to local stations in central Illinois and Iowa through the 
"WGN Sports Network" service. Prior to this, select Bulls games aired by 
WCIU and WGN had been simulcast to many of these same stations. In April 
2006, WCIU began broadcasting White Sox, Cubs and Bulls home games in high 
definition, with away games following suit in April 2008. In February 2015, 
Weigel Broadcasting discontinued its agreement with Tribune Broadcasting 
to carry Cubs and White Sox telecasts produced by WGN, so as to not have 
the game broadcasts conflict with the WLS-TV-produced primetime newscast 
on WCIU (with WPWR-TV taking over as an overflow feed for WGN).[42] As 
of the 2010 NFL season, WCIU has served as a local over-the-air broadcaster 
of NFL games involving the Chicago Bears that are televised by ESPN's Monday 
Night Football. WLS-TV (channel 7), WCIU's news partner, is an owned-and-operated 
station of ABC (itself a sister network to ESPN through ABC parent The 
Walt Disney Company's majority ownership of the cable network), but has 
chosen to exercise its right of first refusal to carry MNF games, deferring 
most games aired since 2010 in order to air Dancing with the Stars (due 
to the program's popularity and the structure of its live voting requirements) 
during that program's fall season. WCIU began airing a Saturday block of 
adult mature cartoons, they currently air the re-runs of American Dad!, 
The Cleveland Show, King of the Hill, Family Guy and Bob's Burgers. Other 
shows that aired as part of The U'z Toons were Futurama and South Park. 
The block originally aired all Saturday long beginning at 1:00 pm Central 
time. In September 2016, they began airing the block beginning at 3:00pm. 
Alongside the Stock Market Observer, WCIU's first standalone local news 
programming effort debuted in 1968, when it launched a half-hour weeknight 
10:00 p.m. newscast titled A Black's View of the News, a program focusing 
on news relevant to Chicago's African American community and commentary. 
The program – which served as a launching pad for eventual Soul Train host 
Don Cornelius – was cancelled in 1982.[35] In September 2009, WCIU debuted 
You and Me This Morning, a weekday morning program featuring a broad mix 
of entertainment news, lifestyle features and weather forecasts. The program 
– which effectively maintains a lighter format, which does not incorporate 
conventional general news segments – originally aired in the form of locally 
produced inserts of varying length interspersed within what otherwise was 
a three-hour block of syndicated programming on WCIU and classic television 
series on WWME-CA from 6:00 to 8:00 a.m.[43][44] Although it trails behind 
the WGN Morning News on WGN-TV and Good Day Chicago on WFLD (as well as 
the early-morning newscasts on WMAQ-TV, WLS-TV and WBBM-TV that the first 
hour of the program also competes against) in the ratings, viewership for 
the program has increased since its debut; in particular, its ratings doubled 
from an average of 40,000 viewers in May 2012 to 73,000 in May 2014. You 
& Me This Morning expanded into a full three-hour program (running from 
6:00 to 9:00 a.m.) on September 8, 2014.[45][46][47][48] On December 14, 
2014, WCIU entered into a news share agreement with ABC owned-and-operated 
station WLS-TV to produce a weeknight-only 7:00 p.m. newscast for channel 
26. Titled ABC 7 Eyewitness News at 7:00 on The U, the program debuted 
on January 12, 2015 as the third prime time newscast among the Chicago 
market's commercial television stations, behind the longer established 
in-house 9:00 p.m. newscasts on WGN-TV and Fox owned-and-operated station 
WFLD (channel 32). With the news share agreement, WLS-TV became the fifth 
ABC-owned station to produce a newscast for a separately owned station 
in its home market (along with existing programs produced by ABC O&Os in 
Raleigh, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles for WLFL, WPHL-TV, 
KOFY-TV and KDOC-TV in the respective markets, and a since-cancelled newscast 
produced by KFSN-TV for KAIL in Fresno).[49][50] 1Carried on a digital
