Jay Stuart Bell (born December 11, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball 
shortstop who played for the Cleveland Indians (1986–88), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1989–96), Kansas City Royals (1997), Arizona Diamondbacks (1998–2002) 
and New York Mets (2003). He was most recently the bench coach for the 
Cincinnati Reds, and was the bench coach for the New Zealand national baseball 
team that competed in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[1] Bell played his 
high school baseball at J.M. Tate High School, located in Cantonment, Florida. 
Originally a first-round pick of the Minnesota Twins in 1984, Bell made 
129 errors over his first three minor-league seasons. The following year 
he was traded to the Cleveland Indians in a deal that brought starter Bert 
Blyleven to the Twins. When he finally reached the majors in 1986, he faced 
Blyleven in his first major-league at-bat. During this moment, Bell ripped 
the first pitch he saw from Blyleven for a home run.[2] Bell maintained 
his reputation as one of the best shortstops in the 1990s.[citation needed] 
His range was only average but he had a great knowledge of the hitters 
and positioned himself well. He won a Gold Glove Award in 1993, breaking 
a string of thirteen straight National League Gold Gloves at shortstop 
by Ozzie Smith. It was also the first Gold Glove by a Pirate shortstop 
since Gene Alley's back-to-back honors in 1966 and 1967. Though mostly 
a singles and doubles hitter at first, Bell was also an expert at bunting. 
Bell did show early signs of his power potential hitting 21 home runs in 
1997 and 20 in 1998. A trial switch to second base at end of the '98 season 
became a permanent move the next spring. Bell belted 36 of his 38 homers 
from his new position, a total exceeded only by Rogers Hornsby, Davey Johnson 
and Ryne Sandberg among second basemen. One of those round-trippers, was 
a sixth-inning grand slam off the Oakland Athletics pitcher Jimmy Haynes 
on the final game before the All-Star break, that won $1 million for an 
Arizona fan, Gylene Hoyle, who had correctly predicted the batter and the 
inning for a bases-loaded blast.[3] In the 2001 World Series, Bell scored 
the series winning run in Game 7 on a Luis Gonzalez bloop-single, then 
what would become an iconic image was Bell clapping his hands over his 
head and then running into Diamondbacks third baseman Matt Williams' arms. 
In his career, Bell batted for .265, with 195 home runs, 868 runs batted 
in, 1,123 runs scored, 1,964 hits, 394 doubles, 67 triples and 91 stolen 
bases. As a player, Bell was well known for wearing eyeglasses on the field. 
After the 2006 season, Bell retired as bench coach of the Arizona Diamondbacks 
in order to spend more time with his family, who are located in Phoenix, 
Arizona and Tampa, Florida. He currently has a ballfield named after him 
in Phoenix, called Jay Bell Field. He became eligible for the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, 
and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received 0.4% of the vote 
and dropped off the ballot. Currently, Bell serves as a member of the advisory 
board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization 
dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League 
players through financial and medical difficulties. In 2012 he served as 
the hitting coach for the Mobile Bay Bears, the Double-A affiliate of the 
Diamondbacks. Bell was hired as the hitting coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on October 31, 2012.[1] On November 11, 2013, Bell was named bench coach 
of the Cincinnati Reds. On October 22, 2015, it was announced that the
