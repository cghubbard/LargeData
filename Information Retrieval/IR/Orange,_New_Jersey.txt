The City of Orange is a township in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 30,134,[8][9][10] 
reflecting a decline of 2,734 (-8.3%) from the 32,868 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 2,943 (+9.8%) from the 29,925 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] Orange was originally incorporated as a township 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 27, 1806, from portions 
of Newark Township. Portions of the township were taken on April 14, 1834, 
to form the now-defunct Clinton Township. On January 31, 1860, Orange was 
reincorporated as a town. Portions of the town were taken to form South 
Orange Township (April 1, 1861, now known as Maplewood), Fairmount (March 
11, 1862, now part of West Orange), East Orange Township (March 4, 1863) 
and West Orange Township (April 10, 1863). On April 3, 1872, Orange was 
reincorporated as a city.[20] In 1982, the city was one of four Essex County 
municipalities to pass a referendum to become a township, joining 11 municipalities 
that had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than 
a dozen Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships 
in order take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated 
townships a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per 
capita basis.[21][22][23][24][25] The city derives its name from William 
III of England[26] or William IV, Prince of Orange.[27] Orange is often 
joined with neighboring East Orange, South Orange and West Orange and referred 
to as part of "the Oranges". Orange had its origins in Connecticut's New 
Haven Colony. In 1666, a group of 30 of New Haven's families traveled by 
water to found "a town on the Passayak" River. They arrived on territory 
now encompassing Newark, the Oranges, and several other municipalities. 
The area was situated in the northeast portion of a land grant conveyed 
by King Charles II of England to his brother James, Duke of York. In 1664, 
James conveyed the land to two proprietors, Lord John Berkeley and Sir 
George Carteret. Since Carteret had been Royal Governor of the Isle of 
Jersey, the territory became known as "New Jersey." Orange was initially 
a part of the city of Newark, but it was originally known as "Newark Mountains". 
On June 7, 1780, the townspeople of Newark Mountains officially voted to 
adopt the name Orange.[28] At the time, there was a significant number 
of people in favor of secession from Newark. However, this would not occur 
until November 27, 1806, when the territory now encompassing all of the 
Oranges was finally detached. On April 13, 1807, the first government was 
elected, but not until March 13, 1860 was Orange officially incorporated 
as a city. Immediately, the new city began fragmenting into smaller communities, 
primarily because of local disputes about the costs of establishing paid 
police, fire, and street departments. South Orange was organized on January 
26, 1861; Fairmount (later to become part of West Orange) on March 11, 
1862; East Orange on March 4, 1863; and West Orange (including Fairmount) 
on March 14, 1863.[20] Orange is located on the Newark and Mount-Pleasant 
Turnpike, the main road from Newark to Morristown, and ultimately to Easton, 
Pennsylvania. The town became a busy thoroughfare for travelers, and hotels 
abounded. Initially, the stagecoach was the primary method of transportation. 
Omnibuses of the Eclipse and the Morris & Newark Lines serviced Orange. 
The Morris and Essex Railroad arrived in Orange in November 1836, its first 
cars drawn by horses. On October 2, 1837, the first steam locomotive appeared, 
and the horses were, with minor exception, relegated to pasture. The "M&E" 
later became a part of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W), 
which exists today as New Jersey Transit's Morristown Line. Trolley cars 
appeared much later, with the Orange and Newark Horse Car Railroad Company 
running its first car up Main Street in May 1862. The Orange Crosstown 
Line, eventually extending from Morris Street, Orange, to Bloomfield, was 
started in June 1888. (The first electric trolley in the State of New Jersey 
operated over a section of this line.) Eventually, all of the trolleys, 
and the buses that replaced them, became part of the sprawling Public Service 
Coordinated Transport System. Orange was an industrial city from the outset. 
Early settlers found a profuse growth of hemlock trees, an ideal supply 
of tannic acid for the tanning industry, and boot and shoemaking factories 
soon flourished. Orange was once the hatmaking capital of the United States. 
The industry can be traced there to 1792. By 1892, 21 firms were engaged 
in that trade, employing over 3,700 people in plants that produced about 
4.8 million hats, which had a combined value in excess of $1 million. Several 
brothers founded the "No-Name Hat Company" in Orange before one of them 
moved on to make fedoras in Philadelphia under the family name, "Stetson." 
By 1921, however, only five hatmaking firms were left, many having departed 
for places such as Norwalk and Danbury, Connecticut.[29] By 1960, all had 
left. Beer was a major revenue producer in Orange beginning in the early 
1900s, when the three Winter Brothers of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, arrived 
in the city and built the first brewery. The Orange Brewery was constructed 
in 1901 at a reported cost of $350,000. The production of beer ceased with 
prohibition in 1920, and after the repeal of the Volstead Act in 1933, 
the brewery was sold to John F. Trommers of Philadelphia. Trommers brewed 
beer under that label until 1950, when the concern was again sold to Liebmann 
Breweries, Incorporated, which bottled Rheingold Beer. Eventually, after 
several additional owners, the plant was closed permanently in 1977. Other 
notable firms located in Orange were the Monroe Calculating Company, manufacturers 
of the patented adding machines of the same name, and the Bates Manufacturing 
Company, producers of office accessories such as staplers and stampers. 
The United States Radium Corporation was a notorious resident of Orange. 
This firm refined ore and extracted the radium used to make luminous paint 
for dials and hands of watches and other indicators. It was only years 
later that the terrible carcinogenic effects of this material became known, 
and the polluted site of the factory became a thorn in the side of the 
city.[30] Orange has produced such notables as baseball's Monte Irvin and 
heavyweight boxer Tony Galento. Actor William Bendix lived and worked here 
for a short while. Presidents, presidential candidates, and governors visited. 
Orange threw a grand party on its 100th anniversary, and another when it 
turned 150. Once a multi-ethnic, economically diverse city, Orange suffered 
indirectly from the 1967 riots in Newark (even though Newark and Orange 
do not share a border) and directly from the construction of Interstate 
280 through the heart of the downtown area, triggering middle-class "white 
flight" from aging industrial towns to the new automobile suburbs being 
built in western Essex County and elsewhere. By the end of the 1970s, Orange 
had many of the urban ills normally associated with larger cities. In 1982, 
citizens voted overwhelmingly to change the designation of Orange from 
a city to a township, thereby making it eligible for federal Revenue Sharing 
funds.[25] In 1985, the State of New Jersey named Orange as a State Urban 
Enterprise Zone, creating tax breaks and investment incentives.[25] This 
program has since been phased out.[31] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the township had a total area of 2.201 square miles (5.700 km2), 
including 2.199 square miles (5.694 km2) of land and 0.002 square miles 
(0.005 km2) of water (0.09%).[1][2] At the 2010 United States Census, there

for females. The per capita income for the borough was $19,816 (+/- $1,027). 
About 16.2% of families and 18.1% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 24.6% of those under age 18 and 20.6% of those age 65 or 
over.[45] As of the 2000 United States Census[16] there were 32,868 people, 
11,885 households, and 7,642 families residing in the township. The population 
density was 14,903.7 people per square mile (5,742.3/km2). There were 12,665

As part of the 2000 Census, 75.10% of Orange's residents identified themselves 
as being African American, one of the highest percentages of African American 
people in the United States, and the fourth-highest in New Jersey (behind 
Lawnside at 93.60%, East Orange at 89.46%, and Irvington at 81.66%) of 
all places with 1,000 or more residents identifying their ancestry.[46] 
Orange has a large Haitian American population, with 11.4% of residents 
identifying themselves as being of Haitian ancestry, the highest of any 
municipality in New Jersey and the eighth-highest in the United States.[47] 
Although still a small percentage of total residents, Orange and East Orange 
have the largest concentrations of Guyanese Americans in the country. In 
the 2000 Census, 2.9% of Orange residents identified as being of Guyanese 
ancestry. While Queens and Brooklyn had larger populations in terms of 
raw numbers, Orange and East Orange (with 2.5%) had the highest percentages 
of people of Guyanese ancestry as a portion of the total population of 
all places in the United States.[48] Orange is governed within the Faulkner 
Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council 
form of municipal government, with a directly elected mayor and a City 
Council consisting of four ward representatives and three at-large representatives. 
Councilmembers are elected to serve four-year terms of office in non-partisan 
elections on a staggered basis with the four ward seats and the three at-large 
seats coming up for election on an alternating cycle every two years.[6]
