Merle Reid Harmon (June 21, 1926 – April 15, 2009[1]) was an American sportscaster 
who was the play-by-play voice for five Major League Baseball teams, two 
teams in the American Football League and the World Football League's nationally 
syndicated telecaster. Harmon also owned a chain of sporting good clothing 
stores. Born and raised in Salem, Illinois, Harmon served with the United 
States Navy in the Pacific during World War II. After the conflict ended, 
he attended Graceland College on the G.I. Bill, earning an Associate of 
Arts degree in 1947.[2] He graduated from the University of Denver with 
a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio & television broadcasting and marketing 
in 1949.[3] He began his broadcasting career later that same year with 
the Topeka Owls, a minor league baseball team in the Kansas–Oklahoma–Missouri 
League. For two years beginning in 1953, Harmon broadcast University of 
Kansas football and basketball games as the first-ever voice of the KU 
Radio Network.[4] In 1954, he called baseball for the Kansas City Blues 
of the American Association, moving to the major league Kansas City Athletics 
the following year after that franchise's relocation from Philadelphia. 
He replaced By Saam, who returned to being the Phillies' main voice. Harmon 
first did Athletics play-by-play on KMBC-AM with Larry Ray (1955–56)[5][6] 
and Ed Edwards (1957–58),[7][8] then later on WDAF radio and television 
with Bill Grigsby (1959–61).[9][10][11] He was fired after the 1961 season 
by Charlie Finley, who had purchased the ballclub the previous year, for 
refusing to participate in a campaign intended to spite the sports editor 
of the Kansas City Star.[12] Harmon's first experience on national television 
came in 1961 when he was hired by ABC Sports to anchor various studio shows 
and call college football games. He, along with Chris Schenkel and Keith 
Jackson, were the play-by-play announcers for the network's baseball Game 
of the Week in 1965. His broadcast partner was Jackie Robinson.[12] He 
became the primary broadcaster for the Milwaukee Braves in 1964, succeeding 
Earl Gillespie who resigned to become the sports director at WITI-TV. After 
two years working alongside Tom Collins (1964) and Blaine Walsh (1964–65) 
on WEMP-AM,[13][14] Harmon was not retained by the Braves, which moved 
to Atlanta and selected Milo Hamilton, a voice more recognized in the new 
market, instead. Harmon joined Herb Carneal and Halsey Hall for Minnesota 
Twins broadcasts on WCCO-AM and WTCN-TV from 1967 to 1969.[12] He had replaced 
Ray Scott, who was designated the lead National Football League announcer 
on CBS Harmon also lent his talents to professional football, reteaming 
with Grigsby to call Kansas City Chiefs games in 1963, its first season 
after moving from Dallas. He became the voice of the New York Jets for 
the next nine years, first on WABC-AM (1964–70), then on WOR-AM (1971–72). 
His broadcast partners were Otto Graham (1964–65), Dick Young (1966–67) 
and Sam DeLuca (1968–1972). The highlight of Harmon's time with the Jets 
was the team's run to the Super Bowl Championship in 1968, which included 
the Heidi Game and victories over the Oakland Raiders and Baltimore Colts 
in the American Football League Championship Game and Super Bowl III respectively.[15] 
In 1970, Harmon became lead announcer for the Milwaukee Brewers and continued 
in that role through the remainder of the decade, teaming with Bob Uecker. 
He also went into business during this period with Merle Harmon's Fan Fair, 
a chain of retail stores devoted to licensed sports merchandise. It grew 
to 140 stores nationwide before he sold the business in 1996. Harmon was 
also the play-by-play voice for the World Football League's Thursday night 
Game of the Week telecasts on TVS in 1974, the circuit's only complete 
season. He was joined in the broadcast booth by regular game analyst Alex 
Hawkins and various guest commentators, who included George Plimpton, Burt 
Reynolds and McLean Stevenson.[citation needed] From 1980–1982, Harmon 
worked for NBC Sports, calling regional NFL, MLB, and college basketball 
action and contributing to the weekly Sportsworld anthology series. He 
was also slated to work on the network's coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics 
in Moscow, before the U.S. boycott of those Games. In 1988, Harmon returned 
to call several September NFL telecasts for NBC while the network's regular 
announcers were working that year's Summer Olympics in Seoul. Prior to 
his retirement from broadcasting, Harmon worked on Texas Rangers telecasts, 
first on KXAS-TV (1982–1984), then on Home Sports Entertainment (HSE) (1984–1989). 
During his eight seasons with the Rangers, he worked alongside Steve Busby 
(1982–85), Mark Holtz (1984), Norm Hitzges (1986–89), Bob Carpenter (1986–88) 
and Greg Lucas (1989).[16] Harmon called Southwest Conference college-football 
telecasts for the regional broadcaster Raycom Sports in the early 1980s, 
frequently paired with former Oklahoma head football coach Bud Wilkinson.[17] 
He called the 1985 and 1986 Liberty Bowl broadcasts for Raycom as well. 
Harmon made a cinematic appearance, playing one of the two NCAA Finals 
announcers in the 2006 feature film Glory Road.[18] Prior to his death, 
he was an active member of the National Speakers Association, and self-published 
his book, Stories, a collection of humorous adventures from his broadcasting 
career. He was a successful keynote speaker at numerous conferences and 
association meetings. Harmon died of pneumonia at a hospital in Arlington,
