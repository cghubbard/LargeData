Héctor Headley López Swainson (born July 9, 1929 (possibly April 8, 1932)) 
is a former left fielder and third baseman in Major League Baseball who 
played for the Kansas City Athletics and New York Yankees from 1955 to 
1966.[1] He is notable as the first black manager at the AAA baseball level, 
as the third outfielder on the Maris/Mantle Yankees, and as the Kansas 
City Athletics franchise hitting streak record holder. López was on World 
Series Championship teams for the Yankees in 1961 and 1962. In various 
seasons, he finished among the top 10 American League hitters in hits, 
runs batted in, runs scored, doubles, triples, slugging percentage, sacrifice 
flies, sacrifice hits, games played, times hit by pitch and at bats. He 
was also known for his hustle, his clutch hitting and poor fielding. López 
was the second Panamanian-born major league baseball player and continues 
to be one of the country's most revered world champion athletes. Although 
Humberto Robinson (102 games played/5 seasons) debuted in the major leagues 
22 days earlier than López, López (1,450 games played/12 seasons) was the 
first of the 49 major leaguers born in Panama to have an extensive career.[2] 
He was the first Panamanian-born major leaguer to finish in the top 10 
in any official statistical category (sacrifice hits, 1956); first to lead 
his league in any official statistic (sacrifice flies, 1958); first to 
play in the World Series (with the 1960 Yankees); and the first to win 
a World Championship (with the 1961 Yankees). He was an infielder for the 
Athletics, and later was often the third outfielder on the Maris/Mantle 
Yankees of the early and mid-1960s. López had his most successful season 
in 1959, but continued to contribute effectively during the early 1960s 
during their pennant successes. The utility player divided his career almost 
equally between infield and outfield positions. After retiring from baseball, 
he went on to become a groundbreaking manager in minor league baseball 
as the first to break the baseball color line as a black manager at the 
AAA level for the Buffalo Bisons and then served in various international 
managerial and coaching positions. Born in Colón, Panama, López grew up 
in Colón and the neighboring Panama Canal Zone. He held a part-time job 
at an American military base bowling alley. He was a high school track 
star whose father had been a pitcher for the Panama national baseball team. 
As a high school athlete, he played semipro baseball for US$100 per month 
in Colón. After he graduated from high school he signed to play with St. 
Hyacinthe of the Canadian Provincial League who also employed Clifford 
"Connie" Johnson.[3] Prior to the 1952 season, López was acquired by the 
Philadelphia Athletics from the Drummondville Cubs of the Class-C Provincial 
League for $1,500 ($13,389 today).[1] In 1954, López won baseball's Triple 
Crown in the Winter League.[4] Throughout his professional career, he played 
in the Panama winter league where he won three batting titles and regularly 
led the league in home runs.[5] López developed in the A's farm system, 
and when the team relocated to Kansas City in 1955 he was recalled to the 
major league club. López made his major league debut in 1955.[1] That season 
he finished second to Carlos Paula among rookies in batting average and 
was overshadowed by American League strikeout-leading pitcher Herb Score 
for the Rookie of the Year.[5] He usually played second or third base during 
his time with the Athletics. During his rookie season, he finished third 
on the team in home runs, trailing only Gus Zernial (30) and Vic Power 
(19). He tied Jim Finigan for third on the team in RBIs with 68, trailing 
only Zernial and Power, who had 84 and 76, respectively.[6] López was the 
team's regular third baseman, and was the youngest regular starter on the 
team. In 1956, the team finished with a 52–102 record, but López had a 
career-high 153 hits.[1] He also set then-career highs in home runs (18) 
and runs batted in (69).[7] In his early years, black and white players 
did not room together on the road, so he roomed with Vic Power even though 
Power's closest friend on the team was Clete Boyer.[8] In 1957, he had 
a 22-game hitting streak, that is the All-time Kansas City Athletics team 
record for the thirteen seasons the franchise played there.[9] He earned 
a position in the top-10 in the American League in both games played and 
at bats in 1956 and 1958, as well as leading the AL in sacrifice flies 
and times grounded into double plays in 1958. López also was in the top 
10 in doubles and runs scored in 1958 and in sacrifice hits in 1956.[1] 
On June 26, 1958, López hit three home runs in a game against the Washington 
Senators.[10] During his career with the Athletics, he hit .278 with 67 
home runs and 269 RBIs, and scored 298 runs. However, his talents were 
wasted on a team that never finished above 6th place. On May 26, 1959, 
he was traded with Ralph Terry to the New York Yankees for Johnny Kucks, 
Tom Sturdivant, and Jerry Lumpe.[1] For all his offensive skills, López 
led American League third basemen in errors in each of his four full seasons 
in Kansas City.[11] Baseball writer and Kansas City Athletics fan Bill 
James wrote that López was as bad a defensive player as you would ever 
want to see.[12] The Authors of The Great American Baseball Card Flipping, 
Trading and Bubble Gum Book wrote of López's defense "I would like to go 
on record right here and now as declaring Hector López the all-time worst 
fielding major league ballplayer."[13] In his first season with the Yankees 
after being traded, he played 35 games in the outfield, the first time 
in his career he played more than 20 outfield games. He still played 76 
games at third base for the team. In his 33 games with Kansas City at the 
start of the 1959 Major League Baseball season, he had played exclusively 
at second base.[1] In his next five seasons with the Yankees from 1960 
to 1964, he mostly played in the outfield as he was part of five consecutive 
pennant winners.[14] During his time with the Yankees, he was often the 
third outfielder of the Maris/Mantle Yankees that won two of the five consecutive 
World Series they played in from 1960 to 1964. He logged the most games 
in left field during the back-to-back World Series Championship seasons 
of 1961 & 1962 (129 vs. Berra-109, Tresh-43).[15][16] During the five pennant 
years, with Roger Maris playing right field and Mickey Mantle playing center 
field, López logged 406 games in left field. This was the most by any Yankee 
during this period (Tom Tresh-195, Yogi Berra-129).[17][18][19] López is 
one of eleven Yankees to have been on these five consecutive pennant winners 
and along with Whitey Ford, Elston Howard, Bobby Richardson, & Clete Boyer 
is one of seven Yankees to have been part of the entire Maris/Mantle Yankee 
era. In 1965 and 1966, he made the majority of his outfield appearances 
in right field. However, in 1965 Mantle did not play center field.[20] 
Mantle did return to center field for the majority of his appearances in 
1966 (the final year of the Maris/Mantle Yankees and the final year of 
López' career).[21] In 1959, he finished in the top 10 in slugging percentage, 
hits, doubles and RBI. In 1960 he was among the top 10 in triples and sacrifice 
hits.[1] During the 1961 World Series, López replaced Mantle (who only 
had six Series at bats)[22] in Game 4 and recorded a 2-run single on the 
way to a 7–0 victory. In Game 5, which was the Series-clinching game, he 
homered and tripled, driving in five runs, and caught Vada Pinson's fly 
ball for the final out of the Series.[23] His three for seven, 7 run batted 
in performance continues to be remembered by New Yorkers as a highlight 
of the series.[11][24] López was the manager of the Buffalo Bisons in 1969. 
This made him the first black manager at the AAA level. This was six years 
before Frank Robinson became the first black manager in the major leagues.[25] 
López was one of three black men (along with Sam Bankhead and Gene Baker) 
to manage in the minor leagues in the twenty-five years after Jackie Robinson 
broke the color barrier in 1947.[26] In 1990, he coached Malverne High 
School of Malverne, New York in Nassau County on Long Island in addition 
to working in the parks department in the Town of Hempstead. López has 
also managed in Venezuela and been a player-manager in Panama.[25] He was 
the manager of the Panama national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic.[27] He paved the way as a role model for the first three Panamanian 
Major League All-Stars, Ben Oglivie and Manny Sanguillén also from Colón, 
and Rod Carew a Colonense born in neighboring Gatun.[2] López recorded 
many firsts among Panamanian baseball players; he was the first regular 
major leaguer,[28] since 1955 was his rookie season, whereas Robinson did 
not qualify as a rookie until 1958 (the season in which he recorded his 
50th career inning pitched) and Webbo Clarke, who also debuted in 1955, 
never qualified as a rookie. López' 1955 rookie season, when he batted 
.290,[1] was also the first by a Panamanian to qualify for baseball's statistical 
leadership by recording the minimum number of plate appearances or innings 
pitched. Thus, although he was not the first to appear in the major leagues, 
he was in a sense the first Panamanian everyday player. None of the other 
major leaguers born in Panama who played in the 1950s (Robinson, Clarke, 
Pat Scantlebury, Tom Hughes)[2] played in the major league postseason, 
which then only included the World Series, before López did so with the 
1960 Yankees. No other Panamanian was part of a World Series champion before 
López with the 1961 Yankees. He was the first Panamanian to record many 
statistical accomplishments, such as a stolen base, home run, double, triple, 
walk or strikeout. His 1956 season was the first by a Panamanian with more 
than 150 hits, more than 25 doubles, 90 runs scored, or more than 60 walks. 
His 1959 season was the first with more than 20 home runs or 90 runs batted 
in. López twice had .350 on-base percentages, but in each season he recorded 
over 400 plate appearances without recording the qualifying number for 
unofficial league leadership. Thus, his career high on-base percentage 
in a season in which he qualified for statistical leadership was .347 in 
1956. He was the first to finish among the top 10 in his league in each 
of the aforementioned statistical categories, and the first to lead his 
league in any official statistical batting category (sacrifice flies in 
1958). López was the first Panamanian to accumulate a sufficient number 
of career appearances to qualify for career statistical leadership (which 
depending upon the source is based on 3000, 4000 or 5000 at bats), although 
his career .269 batting average, .330 on-base percentage and .415 slugging 
percentage are not historically significant.[1] He also represented Panama 
in the 1960 Caribbean Series and tied with Félix Torres and Herman Davis 
for the tournament home run leadership.[29] He continues to be considered 
a legendary world champion who represented the country. In 2006, he was 
cited by professional basketball coach, Joseph Clarke, as ranking alongside 
such noted Panamanian sports personalities as Ismael Laguna, Roberto Durán, 
and Mariano Rivera as Panamanian World Champions.[30] López has two sons.[25] 
Ever since López' performances with the Yankees, the team has had a huge 
following in Panama.[31] Lopez retired following the 1966 season at the 
age of 36. That year, he also participated in his first Old-Timers' Day. 
He has returned to the annual event every year (totaling 50 years as of
