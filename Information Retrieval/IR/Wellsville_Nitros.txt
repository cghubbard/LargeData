The Wellsville Nitros are a collegiate summer baseball team based in Wellsville, 
New York. The Nitros play as a member of the New York Collegiate Baseball 
League. The Nitros consider themselves a revival of an extensive organized 
baseball tradition in Allegany County, New York. In 1942, the Wellsville 
Yankees were established as members of the minor-league "PONY League" (now 
known as the New York–Penn League). The team changed names (and affiliations) 
numerous times in its 23 seasons of existence, being variously known as 
the Senators (1950), Rockets (1951–52), Braves (1953–61) and Red Sox at 
various points in its existence; although the team typically held the name 
of the parent club with which it was affiliated, the professional team 
also used the name Wellsville Nitros from 1947 to 1949, an apparent reference 
to nitroglycerin or trinitrotoluene, both explosives used in natural gas 
exploration (the Nitros' logo includes a flaming derrick). The New York–Penn 
League left Wellsville after the 1965 season; the former Wellsville franchise 
is still active, now playing as the Connecticut Tigers. Wellsville's PONY/NYPL 
franchise won the league title in 1943, 1956, 1959 and 1960. They played 
all of their games at Tullar Field, which was mostly destroyed in the flooding 
associated with Hurricane Agnes in 1972 and rebuilt as a smaller facility. 
The current version of the Nitros was founded in 1998 by John Rigas. Rigas, 
the founder and CEO of Adelphia Communications Corporation and owner of 
the Buffalo Sabres, founded the team as a way to restore organized baseball 
to Wellsville.[1] Shortly after Rigas was embroiled in an embezzlement 
scandal that ultimately led to his imprisonment, he gave up the team, which 
rebranded as the Allegany County Nitros after the team relocated to the
