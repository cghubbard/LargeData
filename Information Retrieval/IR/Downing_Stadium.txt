Downing Stadium, previously known as Triborough Stadium and Randall's Island 
Stadium, was a 22,000-seat stadium in New York City. It was renamed Downing 
Stadium in 1955 after John J. Downing, a director at the New York City 
Department of Parks and Recreation.[1] Built on Randalls Island in the 
East River as a WPA project, 15,000 attendees witnessed Jesse Owens compete 
at the stadium in the Men's Olympic Trials on July 11, 1936, the opening 
night of the new facility.[2][3] Downing Stadium also hosted the Women's 
Olympic Trials in 1964.[1] Triborough Stadium served as one of two home 
stadia of the football New York Yankees of the second AFL (along with Yankee 
Stadium) in 1936 and 1937. The first televised American football game was 
held at Triborough on September 30, 1939, as Fordham took on Waynesburg. 
NYU's football team also played its last two seasons at Triborough in 1951 
and 1952.[4] In 1966, the Continental Football League's Brooklyn Dodgers, 
unable to find a suitable field in Brooklyn (Ebbets Field had been torn 
down in 1960), played their home games at Downing. (Coincidentally, the 
football Dodgers wound up playing under the same lights used at Ebbets, 
as they had been moved to Randalls Island upon the older stadium's destruction.)[5] 
The club would play only three games at Downing before the league took 
over the franchise and shifted their remaining home games elsewhere. Eight 
years later, Downing Stadium became the home of the New York Stars of the 
WFL;[6] like the Dodgers, the Stars left the stadium before the season 
ended, shifting to Charlotte. Randalls Island was the site of two international 
soccer matches: the USA team played Scotland on Randalls Island on June 
19, 1949, with the Scots winning, 4-0, with 17,000 in attendance;[7] on 
May 27, 1964, the English squad crushed the Americans, 10–0, in front of 
just 5,062 fans.[8] The New York Cosmos of the NASL moved to Downing in 
1974. On June 15, 1975, Pele made his NASL debut against the Dallas Tornado, 
with the field spray-painted green to look better on television; CBS carried 
the game live.[9] In 1976, the Cosmos moved out, back to Yankee Stadium 
(where they had spent their debut season in 1971); for years afterward, 
the words "COSMOS SOCCER" remained on the stadium to be seen from the nearby 
highway viaduct on the Triborough Bridge). Downing's last pro soccer tenant 
were the New York Centaurs of the A-League in 1995. The site was considered 
for a 48,000-seat capacity soccer specific stadium, based on the design 
of the City of Manchester Stadium, had the New York City bid for the 2012 
Summer Olympics been successful. The plan was shelved when New York lost 
out to London. The stadium was also used for some Negro League baseball 
games in the 1930s; it was the home of the New York Black Yankees in 1938. 
The stadium also played host to the All Blacks several times, in the course 
of larger tours to Europe. They last played a New York Metropolitan selection 
in October 1972, beating their hosts 41–9.[10] In October 1997, Downing 
played host to a Gaelic football match between Cavan and Kerry; the game 
was moved to New York in order to commemorate the 1947 All Ireland Final 
between the same teams played at the Polo Grounds.[11] In 1938, the stadium 
hosted the Carnival of Swing, one of the first large outdoor jazz festivals. 
After the triumph of Woodstock the previous year, the three-day New York 
Pop Festival tried to re-create its success in New York City, opening on 
Randalls Island on July 17, 1970. Unfortunately, the concert was a bust, 
as half the big name lineup failed to show up (although Jimi Hendrix performed 
a memorable set). What's more, the festival was picketed by several radical 
groups: some of the protesters demanded that a portion of the ticket sales 
go to worthy causes (even threatening the box office), while others wanted 
everyone to get in free. (This was partially accomplished when thousands 
of concert-goers literally crashed through the gates.)[12] Once the stadium 
stopped being a major sports venue, Downing was used largely for concerts, 
serving as a venue for rock concerts such as Pearl Jam and the Tibetan 
Freedom Concert. The stadium was torn down in 2002 in order to be replaced 
by a newer complex, Icahn Stadium, which was completed in 2004. Coordinates:
