[12] The Yankees were part of Washington baseball history. The Senators 
played their final game in Washington at RFK Stadium and their opponents 
were the Yankees. Fan enmity came to a head in the game on September 30. 
Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying because the security 
guards left early in the game, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to 
around 25,000. The Senators led 7-5 with two outs in the top of the ninth. 
Just then, fans poured onto the field. A teenager scooped up first base 
and ran away. With no security guards in sight, the game was forfeited 
to the Yankees, 9-0. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
