Braves Field was a baseball park in the Northeastern United States, located 
in Boston. Today the site is home to Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston 
University. The stadium was home of the Boston Braves of the National League 
from 1915–1952, prior to the Braves' move to Milwaukee in 1953. The stadium 
hosted the 1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the 1915 and 1916 
World Series home games for the Boston Red Sox, and the 1948 World Series. 
Braves Field was the site of Babe Ruth's final season, playing for the 
Braves in 1935.[1][2] From 1929 to 1932, the Boston Red Sox played select 
regular season games periodically at Braves Field.[3] On May 1, 1926, Braves 
Field hosted the longest baseball game in history – 26 Innings. The game 
ended in a 1-1 tie.[4] Braves Field was also home to multiple professional 
football teams between 1929 and 1948, including the first home of the National 
Football League (NFL) franchise that became the Washington Redskins. The 
pro football Braves played at the ballpark in their inaugural season of 
1932, then were at Fenway Park for four seasons as the Boston Redskins 
before the move south in 1937 to Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. Located 
on Commonwealth Avenue at Babcock Street, the baseball field was aligned 
northeast, much as the Red Sox' home, Fenway Park has been since it opened 
in April 1912. Most of the stadium was demolished in 1955, but significant 
portions of the original structure still stand and make up part of the 
Nickerson Field sports complex on the campus of Boston University. While 
built for baseball and having a rich baseball history, Braves Field briefly 
served as host for football teams. Braves Field was one of two homes (with 
Fenway Park) of the Boston Bulldogs of the first American Football League 
(in 1926) and the Boston Shamrocks of the second AFL (in 1936 and 1937). 
The National Football League's Pottsville Maroons were sold and relocated 
to Braves Field in 1929 as the Boston Bulldogs. In 1932, Braves Field became 
home of the football Boston Braves, a National Football League expansion 
franchise, owned by George Preston Marshall. The next year, after a 4-4-2 
season, the Boston Braves Football franchise moved to Fenway Park and changed 
its name to the Redskins.[5] In 1937 the franchise relocated and become 
today's Washington Redskins.[6] Later, the Boston Yanks played a few games 
at Braves Field when Fenway Park was unavailable. Before the Braves became 
the first modern-era franchise to relocate, in 1952, the Boston Braves 
franchise had been in Boston since 1871. Before Braves Field, the franchise 
had played at South End Grounds, with play at Congress Street Grounds in 
1894 while South End Grounds was rebuilt following the May 5, 1894 Roxbury 
Fire .[7] Shortly after the Boston Red Sox opened Fenway Park in 1912, 
Braves owner James Gaffney purchased the former Allston Golf Club, one 
mile west of Fenway Park to build a new park for the Braves. Construction 
of the $600,000 Braves Field began on March 20, 1915 and was completed 
before the end of the 1915 season.[8][9] The park was constructed entirely 
of steel (approx 750 tons) and an estimated 8 million pounds of concrete.[10] 
Braves Field officially opened on August 18, 1915 with 46,000 in attendance 
to see the Braves defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1.[11] Braves Park was 
the largest stadium built in that era, with 40,000 capacity and a trolley 
system leading to the park.[3] Braves Field was nicknamed The Wigwam by 
fans. Later it was nicknamed The Bee Hive and the name changed to National 
League Park,from 1936–1941, a period during which the owners changed the 
nickname of the team to the Boston Bees. The renaming of the team and stadium 
were both eventually dropped. During this span, it hosted the fourth Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game in 1936. With its capacity to hold more fans 
than Fenway Park, Braves Field was used by the Red Sox in the 1915 and 
1916 World Series; with Braves Field still under construction, the Braves 
had used Fenway Park for their World Series Title in 1914. Looking at design, 
James Gaffney, wanted to see the game played in a wide open field conducive 
to allowing numerous inside-the-park home runs. Thus, the stadium was built 
in what was, at the time, the outskirts of Boston, in a large rectangular 
plot, contrasting with the cozy and lopsided block containing Fenway Park. 
The stands were almost entirely in foul territory, leaving little in the 
outfield to which players could hit a home run into – with the fences over 
400 feet (120 m) away down the lines and nearly 500 feet (150 m) to dead 
center, hitting the ball over the outer fences was all but impossible during 
the dead-ball era. A stiff breeze coming in from center field across the 
Charles River further lessened any chances of seeing home runs fly out 
of the park.[12] The only possible target in the outfield was a small bleacher 
section, which came to be known as The Jury Box after a sportswriter noticed 
during one slow mid-week game that there were only twelve individuals sitting 
in the 2,000-seat stand. Ty Cobb visited the park and commented, "Nobody 
will ever hit a ball out of this park."[12] The large foul ground area 
further favored the pitchers. It took seven years and a livelier ball before 
a batter hit a home run that cleared the outer wall on the fly. New York 
Giants catcher, Frank Snyder, hit the first major league home run in the 
history of Braves Field in 1922 when he cleared the left field foul pole.[12] 
Meanwhile, it remained a pitchers' park, perhaps never more so than on 
May 1, 1920, when Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Leon Cadore and Braves pitcher 
Joe Oeschger locked horns for a pair of complete-game performances that 
went on for a still-record 26 innings. After all that work, the game ended 
in a 1-1 tie, called on account of darkness. At the advent of the lively 
ball era, it became clear that the fans were unhappy with Gaffney's vision 
of how baseball should be played, and inner fences were built, and regularly 
moved, being moved in and out based on whims. Later, the ownership of the 
team even went so far as to shift the entire field in a clockwise direction 
(towards right field) at one point. One year after opening Braves Field, 
Gaffney had sold the Braves, but kept Braves Field. Gaffney and his heirs 
then leased the stadium out to Braves owners until 1949, when his heirs 
sold it back to the Braves for approx. $750,000.[3] On Sunday, September 
21, 1952, the Brooklyn Dodgers defeated the Braves 8-2 before 8,822 fans 
in the final Major League game at Braves Field. Roy Campanella hit the 
last home run to help Joe Black defeat a Braves team with 20 year-old rookie 
Eddie Mathews hitting 3rd.[13] After purchasing the Braves from Bob Quinn 
in 1945, owner Lou Perini, citing low attendance, moved the Braves to Milwaukee 
just prior to the 1953 season, leaving Braves Field vacant. The Braves 
had drawn less than 300,000 fans in 1952, after drawing over 1 million 
in 1947,1948 and 1949. Milwaukee had been the site of the Braves' Minor 
League team, the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Braves had earlier blocked 
an attempt by the St. Louis Browns to move to Milwaukee.[14][15] With the 
Braves gone, Boston University quickly purchased the former home of the 
Braves on July 30, 1953, renaming it Boston University Field and utilizing 
it for their student athletes, a usage that remains today.[16] The remaining 
scoreboard was sold and was moved to Kansas City Municipal Stadium.[17] 
The old ballpark was used as-is until 1955, when Boston University reconfigured 
the stands and the grounds. The remodel, replaced all but the pavilion 
grandstand at the end of the right field line, which was retained as the 
seating core of a football, soccer, field hockey, and track-and-field stadium. 
The stadium was initially called "Boston University Field" and later renamed 
Nickerson Field. Along with the pavilion, the original outer wall was retained, 
though a portion of that wall along what is now Harry Agganis Way was replaced 
with wrought iron fencing in 2008. The stadium's ticket office was converted 
into the Boston University police station. The rest of the stadium structure 
was replaced by dormitories covering the former main grandstand; and the 
Case Physical Education Center, which houses Walter Brown Arena and Case 
Gym in the vicinity of what was the left field pavilion along Babcock Street. 
Of the demolished Jewel Box ballparks, Braves Field has the largest proportion 
of visible remnants still standing, as no other former ballpark has any 
portion of its seating still in use. World Series games were played at 
Braves Field in 1915, 1916, and 1948. The Boston Red Sox played their home 
games in the 1915 and 1916 World Series at the new Braves Field, as its 
capacity at the time was larger than Fenway Park, while the Braves hosted 
three games of the 1948 World Series. The Red Sox defeated the Philadelphia 
Phillies 4 games to 1 to win the 1915 World Series. On Monday, October 
11, the Red Sox won Game 3 at Braves Field 2-1 in front of 42,300. The 
next day, the Red Sox won Game 4 in front of 41,096, also 2-1.[18] As a 
young pitcher on the Red Sox, Babe Ruth only appeared in the series once, 
as a pinch hitter, going 0-1 in Game 1.[19] The following year, the Red 
Sox played the Brooklyn Robins in the 1916 World Series. In Game 1, the 
Red Sox defeated Brooklyn 6-5 at Braves Field in front of 36,117. On Monday, 
October 9, Boston left-hander Babe Ruth pitched against Sherry Smith in 
front of 47,373.[20] Ruth and Smith dueled for 14 innings, before Ruth 
and the Red Sox won in the bottom of the 14th 2-1. The Red Sox won their 
second consecutive World Series with a 4-1 victory in Game 5 at Braves 
Field, with 43,620 in attendance.[21] In 1948, the Boston Braves captured 
the National League pennant with 91 wins. The Braves then played the Cleveland 
Indians in the World Series, losing 4 games to 2. Two future Hall-of-Famers 
led their teams as Managers, Lou Boudreau of Indians and Billy Southworth 
leading the Braves.[22] The 1948 Braves were led by pitchers Johnny Sain 
and Hall-of-Famer Warren Spahn. In Game 1, on October 6, Sain beat Bob 
Feller of the Indians 1-0 at Braves Field in front of 40,135. The Indians 
took Game 2 4-1, the next day at Braves Field, with Bob Lemon beating Spahn 
with 39,633 in attendance.[22] Game 2 also made television history when 
a live broadcast of the game was shown to passengers of the B&O Railroad's 
train traveling between Washington, D.C. and New York City.[23] The Braves 
and Indians returned to Boston for Game 6 on Monday October 11, 1948. The 
Indians defeated the Braves 4-3 in front of 40,103 to capture the championship.[22] 
On July 7, 1936 the 1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played 
at Braves Field, with 25,566 in attendance.[24] The National League defeated 
the American League 4-3 in the 4th All-Star game, featuring over 20 future 
Major League Baseball Hall of Fame members. Lefty Grove and Dizzy Dean 
were the starting pitchers for managers Joe McCarthy of the New York Yankees 
and Charlie Grimm of the Chicago Cubs.[25] Lou Gehrig hit a home run for 
the American League, batting behind rookie Joe DiMaggio in the lineup. 
Among others, Luke Appling, Bill Dickey, Joe Cronin, Schoolboy Rowe, Jimmie 
Foxx, Rick Ferrell, Earl Averill and Charlie Gehringer were selected for 
the American League. The National League roster included Billy Herman, 
Joe Medwick, Gabby Hartnett, Arky Vaughn, Goose Goslin, Leo Durocher, Ernie 
Lombardi, Mel Ott and carl Hubbell.[24] On Saturday, May 1, 1920, at Braves 
Field, the Boston Braves and Brooklyn Robins played 26 complete innings 
in a game that ended in a 1-1 tie, called due to darkness by Home Plate 
Umpire Barry McCormick.[4][26] The longest Innings game in Major League 
history. Starting pitchers, Leon Cadore (Brooklyn) and Joe Oeschger (Boston), 
both pitched the entire game in front of 4,500 fans. The 26 innings by 
both pitchers set an unbroken record and it is estimated conservatively 
that each threw at least 300 pitches.[27] Oeschager threw 21 consecutive 
scoreless innings in the game, Cadore threw 20. Second baseman Charlie 
Pick of the Braves went 0-11, the worst single day at the plate in MLB 
history.[26] Cadore faced 95 Braves hitters, while Oeschager faced 90 hitters.[26] 
Brooklyn and the Braves met again on Monday, May 3, after an off-day for 
the Braves. That game lasted another 19 Innings, a 2-1 Boston win.[28] 
In between, on Sunday, May 2, Brooklyn played at home against Philadelphia 
(4-3 Brooklyn win) in a game that went 13 innings.[29] This gave Brooklyn 
58 Innings in 3 days and 3 games.[26] There were four no hitters pitched 
at Braves Field. (None was a Perfect Game.): There were only two 3-HR games 
at Braves Field.[3] As noted above the fences were moved repeatedly throughout 
the ballpark's existence, sometimes within a given season. 1915–21 Left
