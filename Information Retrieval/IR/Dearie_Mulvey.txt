Elizabeth Marie "Dearie" Mulvey (née McKeever; June 1898 – November 24, 
1968) was the co-owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League from 
1938 through 1950, then 25 percent minority owner through her death, with 
her husband, James Mulvey. In 1938, she inherited one-quarter share of 
the club from her father Stephen McKeever's estate. In 1950, Walter O'Malley 
assumed majority control of the Dodgers. The Mulvey's minority share was 
purchased by O'Malley in 1975, 17 years after the team moved from Brooklyn 
to Los Angeles. She died at White Plains, New York in 1968 after recent 
years of declining health. She was survived by her husband and 3 children.[1]
