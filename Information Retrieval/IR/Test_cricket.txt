Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered 
its highest standard. Test matches are played between national representative 
teams with "Test status", as determined by the International Cricket Council 
(ICC). The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which may 
last up to five days (or longer in some historical cases). It is generally 
considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and 
endurance.[1][2][3] The name Test stems from the long, gruelling match 
being a "test" of the relative strengths of the two sides.[4] The first 
officially recognised Test match began on 15 March 1877, between England 
and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), where Australia won 
by 45 runs.[5] A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was 
held in Melbourne from 12 to 17 March 1977, in which Australia beat England 
by 45 runs—the same margin as that first Test.[6] In October 2012, the 
International Cricket Council recast the playing conditions for Test matches, 
permitting day/night Test matches.[7] The first day/night game took place 
between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, on 27 
November 2015.[8] Test matches are the highest level of cricket although, 
statistically, their data forms part of first-class cricket. Matches are 
played between national representative teams with "Test status", as determined 
by the International Cricket Council. As of December 2014[update], ten 
national teams have Test status, the most recently promoted being Bangladesh 
in 2000. Zimbabwe's Test status was voluntarily suspended, because of poor 
performances between 2006 and 2011; it returned to competition in August 
2011.[9] In January 2014, during the historic ICC meeting in Dubai, the 
pathway for new potential test nations was laid out with the winners of 
the next round of the ICC Intercontinental Cup playing a 5-day match against 
the bottom rank test nation. If the Associate team defeats the test nation, 
then they could be added as the new test country and be given full membership. 
A list of matches, defined as "Tests", was first drawn up by Australian 
Clarence Moody in the mid-1890s. Representative matches played by simultaneous 
England touring sides of 1891–92 (in Australia and South Africa) and 1929–30 
(in the West Indies and New Zealand) are deemed to have "Test status". 
In 1970, a series of five "Test matches" was played in England between 
England and a Rest of the World XI. These matches, originally scheduled 
between England and South Africa, were amended after South Africa was suspended 
from international cricket because of their government's policy of apartheid. 
Although initially given Test status (and included as Test matches in some 
record books, including Wisden Cricketers' Almanack), this was later withdrawn 
and a principle was established that official Test matches can only be 
between nations (although the geographically and demographically small 
countries of the West Indies have since 1928 been permitted to field a 
coalition side). Despite this, in 2005, the ICC ruled that the six-day 
Super Series match that took place in October 2005, between Australia and 
a World XI, was an official Test match. Some cricket writers and statisticians, 
including Bill Frindall, ignored the ICC's ruling and excluded the 2005 
match from their records. The series of "Test matches" played in Australia 
between Australia and a World XI in 1971/72 do not have Test status. The 
commercial "Supertests" organised by Kerry Packer as part of his World 
Series Cricket enterprise and played between "WSC Australia", "WSC World 
XI" and "WSC West Indies" from 1977 to 1979 have never been regarded as 
official Test matches. There are currently ten Test-playing teams, representing 
individual nations except for England and the West Indies. Test status 
is conferred upon a country or group of countries by the International 
Cricket Council. Teams that do not have Test status can play in the ICC 
Intercontinental Cup, specifically designed to allow non-Test teams to 
play under conditions similar to Tests. The teams are listed below with 
the date of each team's Test debut: In 2009, Ireland stated its intention 
to apply for Full Membership of the ICC with the aim of achieving Test 
status,[11] and restated its intention in 2012, but the 2012 plan aims 
to achieve Test status by 2020.[12] In 2014, the ICC announced the introduction 
of the ICC Test Challenge, which will see the holder of the Intercontinental 
Cup play a pair of two five-day match series against the lowest ranked 
test-playing nation every four years, starting in 2018.[13] In May 2016, 
ICC announced that it is contemplating the idea of two-tiers in Test match 
cricket.[14] ICC hopes that this will help them draw more crowd and generate 
more revenue from the matches played between top tier teams. Promotion 
and relegation could be introduced into Test cricket as early as 2019, 
if ICC has it this way. This will give opportunities to more countries 
like Afghanistan and Ireland to play test cricket. On 7 September 2016, 
the ICC withdrew the proposal for a two-tier system.[15] In October 2016, 
ICC started contemplating a different kind of Two-Tier system for Test 
match cricket. This structure will be similar to Baseball-style structure, 
where there will be two conferences of six teams each. Each team will play 
against all teams in their conference over a period of two years, with 
a Test Championship play-off between the toppers of both conferences at 
the end of the defined period. This structure will remove the non-equity 
that was a drawback of the initially proposed Two-tier system.[16] A standard 
day of test cricket consists of 3 sessions of 2 hours each, the breaks 
between sessions being 40 minutes for lunch, and 20 minutes for tea. However 
the times of sessions and intervals may be altered in certain circumstances: 
if bad weather or a change of innings occurs close to a scheduled break, 
the break may be taken immediately; if there has been a loss of playing 
time, for example because of bad weather, the session times may be adjusted 
to make up the lost time; if the batting side is nine wickets down at the 
scheduled tea break, then the interval may be delayed until either 30 minutes 
has elapsed or the team is all out;[17] the final session may be extended 
by up to 30 minutes if 90 or more overs have not been bowled in that day's 
play (subject to any reduction for adverse weather);[18] the final session 
may be extended by 30 minutes (except on the 5th day) if the umpires believe 
the result can be decided within that time.[19] In the early days of Test 
cricket, matches were played for four days. Until the 1980s, it was usual 
to include a 'rest day,' often a Sunday. There have also been 'Timeless 
Tests', which did not end after a predetermined maximum time. In 2005, 
Australia played a six-day match against a World XI, which the ICC sanctioned 
as an official Test match even though the match reached a conclusion on 
the fourth day. There have been attempts by the ICC, the sport's governing 
body, to introduce day-night Test matches.[20] In 2012, The International 
Cricket Council passed playing conditions that allowed for the staging 
of day-night Test matches.[7] The first day-night Test took place during 
New Zealand's tour to Australia in November 2015.[8] Test cricket is played 
in innings (the word denotes both the singular and the plural). In each 
innings, one team bats and the other bowls (or fields). Ordinarily four 
innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls 
twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains 
and the match referee toss a coin; the captain who wins the toss decides 
whether his team will bat or bowl first. In the following scenarios, the 
team that bats first is referred to as Team A and their opponents as Team 
B. Usually the teams will alternate at the completion of each innings. 
Thus, Team A will bat (and Team B will bowl) until its innings ends, and 
then Team B will bat and Team A will bowl. When Team B's innings ends, 
Team A begin their second innings, and this is followed by Team B's second 
innings. The winning team is the one that scores more runs in their two 
innings. A team's innings ends in one of the following ways:[21] If, at 
the completion of its first innings, Team B's first innings total is 200 
or more fewer than Team A's, the captain of Team A may (but is not required 
to) order Team B to have their second innings next. This is called enforcing 
the follow on.[22] In this case, the usual order of the third and fourth 
innings is reversed: Team A will bat in the fourth innings. It is rare 
for a team forced to follow on to win the match. In Test cricket it has 
only happened three times, although over 285 follow-ons have been enforced: 
Australia was the losing team on each occasion, twice to England, in 1894 
and in 1981, and once to India in 2001.[23] If the whole of the first day's 
play of a test match has been lost because of bad weather or other reasons 
like bad light, then Team A may enforce the follow on if Team B's first 
innings total is 150 or more fewer than Team A's. During the 2nd test between 
England and New Zealand at Headingley, Leeds, 24–28 May 2013, England batted 
first after the first day was lost because of rain.[24] New Zealand, batting 
second, scored 180 runs fewer than England, meaning England could have 
enforced the follow on, though chose not to. This is similar to four-day 
first class cricket, where the follow on can be enforced if the difference 
is 150 runs or fewer. If the Test is 2 days or fewer then the "follow-on" 
value is 100 runs. After 80 overs, the captain of the bowling side may 
take a new ball, although this is not required.[25] The captain will usually 
take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball 
generally favours faster bowlers who can make it bounce more variably. 
The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin 
bowlers, or those using reverse swing. The captain may delay the decision 
to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because 
the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings 
last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take 
another new ball. A Test match may end in one of six results: Test cricket 
is almost always played as a series of matches between two countries, with 
all matches in the series taking place in the same country (the host). 
Often there is a perpetual trophy that is awarded to the winner, the most 
famous of which is the Ashes contested between England and Australia. There 
have been two exceptions to the bilateral nature of Test cricket: the 1912 
Triangular Tournament, a three-way competition between England, Australia 
and South Africa (hosted by England), and the Asian Test Championship, 
an event held in 1998–99 and 2001–02. The number of matches in Test series 
has varied from one to seven.[32] Up until the early 1990s,[33] Test series 
between international teams were organised between the two national cricket 
organisations with umpires provided by the home team. With the entry of 
more countries into Test cricket, and a wish by the ICC to maintain public 
interest in Tests in the face of the popularity of one-day cricket, a rotation 
system was introduced that sees all ten Test teams playing each other over 
a six-year cycle, and an official ranking system (with a trophy held by 
the highest-ranked team). In this system, umpires are provided by the ICC. 
An elite panel of eleven umpires has been established, and the panel is 
supplemented by an additional International Panel that includes three umpires 
named by each Test-playing country. The elite umpires officiate almost 
all Test matches (usually not a Test involving their home country); the 
International Panel is only employed when the cricketing calendar is filled 
with activity, or for one-day internationals (ODIs). Sides designated as 
"England" began to play in the late 18th century, but these teams were 
not truly representative. Early international cricket was disrupted by 
the French Revolution and the American Civil War. The earliest international 
cricket match was between USA and Canada, on 24 and 25 September 1844.[34] 
This has never been officially considered a "Test match". Tours of national 
English sides abroad took place, particularly to the USA, Australia and 
New Zealand. The Australian Aborigines team became the first organised 
overseas cricketers to tour England in 1868. Two rival English tours of 
Australia were proposed in the early months of 1877, with James Lillywhite 
campaigning for a professional tour and Fred Grace for an amateur one. 
Grace's tour fell through and it was Lillywhite's team that toured New 
Zealand and Australia in 1876–77. Two matches against a combined Australian 
XI were later classified as the first official Test matches. The first 
match was won by Australia, by 45 runs, and the second by England. After 
reciprocal tours established a pattern of international cricket, The Ashes 
was established as an ongoing competition during the Australian tour of 
England in 1882. Surprisingly beaten, a mock obituary of English cricket 
was published in the Sporting Times the following day: the phrase "The 
body shall be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia" prompted the subsequent 
creation of the Ashes urn. The series of 1884–85 was the first to be held 
over five matches: Shaw, writing in 1901, considered the side to be "the 
best ever to have left England". The first Test series not to involve Australia 
occurred in 1888–89, as an understrength England side toured South Africa.
