Patrick Brian "Pat" Burrell (born October 10, 1976), nicknamed "Pat the 
Bat,"[1] is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played 
in Major League Baseball. Standing 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm) tall and weighing 
235 pounds (107 kg; 16.8 st), he batted and threw right-handed. He played 
with the Philadelphia Phillies, the Tampa Bay Rays, and the San Francisco 
Giants. Burrell attended the University of Miami, where he won the Golden 
Spikes Award in 1998. In 1998, he was the first overall draft pick by the 
Phillies. After two years in the minors, Burrell was called up by the Phillies 
in 2000, and he finished fourth in voting for the National League Rookie 
of the Year Award. After hitting 27 home runs in 2001 (the first of eight 
straight years in which he would hit at least 20), he hit a career-high 
37 home runs in 2002 and finished 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award 
voting. In 2003, he signed a six-year contract with the Phillies but batted 
a career-low .209 with 21 home runs. In 2004, he batted .257 with 24 home 
runs but missed several games with a wrist injury. He hit 32 home runs 
in 2005 and finished seventh in NL MVP Award voting after he set a career 
high with 117 RBI. In 2006, he batted .258 with 29 home runs and 95 RBI 
but was benched for a few games due to a slump after April. He batted .256 
with 30 home runs in 2007 as the Phillies reached the playoffs for the 
first time in his career. Burrell hit a home run in the playoffs as the 
Phillies were swept in the first round. In 2008, he hit 33 home runs as 
the Phillies reached the playoffs again, winning the World Series. After 
the 2008 season, Burrell became a free agent. He signed a two-year deal 
with the Tampa Bay Rays to be their designated hitter, and he batted .221 
with 14 home runs in 2009. After he batted .202 with two home runs in his 
first 24 games of the 2010 season, he was designated for assignment by 
the Rays. He became a free agent and signed with the San Francisco Giants 
several days later. He took over as the Giants' left fielder and hit 18 
home runs in 96 games for the Giants as they made the playoffs. Burrell 
did not have a hit in the World Series, striking out eleven times in fifteen 
plate appearances, but he got his second World Series ring as the Giants 
won it. Following the year, he signed a one-year deal to return to the 
Giants in 2011. He lost his left field job in 2011, and he batted .230 
with a career-low 7 home runs in 92 games in addition to suffering a career-ending 
foot injury. He filed for free agency on October 30, 2011 and later signed 
a 1-day contract in 2012 to finish his career with the Phillies. On May 
19, 2012 against the Red Sox, Burrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch 
and subsequently retired. He is currently a special assignment scout for 
the Giants and an assistant to general manager Brian Sabean.[2] Burrell 
attended San Lorenzo Valley High School in Felton, California, as a freshman.[3] 
After his freshman year, he transferred to Bellarmine College Preparatory 
in San Jose, where he played baseball and football. In the football program, 
playing quarterback, Burrell competed against Tom Brady, who played for 
rival Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, California.[4] He decided 
to concentrate on baseball in his senior year, however,[4] and he was named 
the California Coaches Association Player of the Year after he batted .369 
with 11 home runs.[5] After graduating from high school in 1995, Burrell 
was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 43rd round of the 1995 Major League 
Baseball (MLB) Draft.[1] Instead of signing, he chose to attend the University 
of Miami, where he played third base and was a teammate of Aubrey Huff.[6] 
As a freshman, he was selected as a First-Team All-American by Baseball 
America and the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. He was also named the Most 
Outstanding Player of the 1996 College World Series, joining Dave Winfield 
and Phil Nevin as the only players to win the award without winning the 
series. In his sophomore year, he was again named a First-Team All-American 
by Baseball America and the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper but also by the 
Sporting News this year. He was named Baseball America's Summer Player 
of the year in 1997.[5] In 1998, as a junior, he won the Golden Spikes 
Award as the best player in college baseball.[7] That year, he was drafted 
by the Philadelphia Phillies with the first overall pick in the 1998 MLB 
draft.[6] Burrell finished his college career with 61 home runs, 187 runs 
batted in (RBI), and 170 walks in 162 games.[5] His .442 batting average 
was seventh all-time by an NCAA player, and his slugging percentage of 
.888 was second only to Pete Incaviglia.[5] In February 2008, Burrell was 
inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.[8] On July 24, 
1998 Burrell and the Phillies agreed to a five-year contract with a $3.15 
million signing bonus.[9] Upon signing, Burrell was assigned to the single-A 
advanced Clearwater Phillies of the Florida State League, and he was moved 
to first base because Scott Rolen, Philadelphia's third baseman in the 
major leagues, had just won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year 
Award.[6][10][11] With Clearwater in 1998, Burrell batted .303 with 7 home 
runs and 30 RBI in 37 games.[11] Entering the 1999 season, Burrell was 
named the top prospect in the Phillies' organization by Baseball America, 
and they also named him baseball's 19th best prospect.[11][12] He spent 
most of the season with the Double-A Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, 
batting .333 with 28 home runs and 90 RBI in 117 games.[11] He was named 
to the Eastern League's post-season All-Star team and won the Eastern League 
Rookie of the Year Award.[5] He also played 10 games with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Red Barons of the Triple-A International League, batting .152 with 1 home 
run and 4 RBI.[11] In addition to playing first base, he was used as an 
outfielder with both teams.[11] Burrell was named the Phillies' top prospect 
and the second-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America in 2000.[11][12] 
He began the season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[11] Playing first base 
and the outfield, he batted .294 with 4 home runs and 25 RBI in 40 games.[11] 
On May 23, 2000, Burrell was called up by the Philadelphia Phillies.[13] 
On May 24, he replaced Kevin Jordan (who had been filling in for injured 
Opening Day first baseman Rico Brogna) as the Phillies' first baseman.[14][15][16] 
Making his major league debut that day, he had two hits (his first coming 
against Octavio Dotel) and two RBI in a 9–7 victory over the Houston Astros.[17] 
The following day, he hit his first career home run in a 10–6 loss to Houston.[18] 
On June 20, with the Phillies trailing 2–1 against the New York Mets, he 
hit a home run against Mets' closer Armando Benítez to make the score 2–2 
in an eventual 3–2 victory for Philadelphia.[19] The next day, Burrell 
had five RBI, two home runs, and his first career grand slam in a 10–5 
victory for Philadelphia.[20] On July 2, he had four hits and two RBI in 
a 9–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[21] He remained the Phillies' 
first baseman when Brogna returned in July.[16] He had five RBI, two home 
runs, and a grand slam on August 8 in a 10–4 victory over the San Diego 
Padres.[22] On August 9, newly acquired outfielder Travis Lee was moved 
to first base, and Burrell was moved to left field for the rest of the 
year.[14][23][24] On September 21, he had a game-winning walk-off single 
against Rick White in a 6–5 victory against the Mets.[25] He finished the 
season with 18 home runs, 79 RBI, and a .260 batting average in 111 games, 
and he had the fourth most votes for the NL Rookie of the Year Award.[26] 
On April 14, 2001, Burrell hit a game-winning home run in the sixth inning 
of a 2–1 victory over the Atlanta Braves.[27] He had a game-winning two-RBI 
double in the ninth inning as the Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs, 6–3, 
on April 17.[28] From May 19 to June 2, he had a career-high 14-game hitting 
streak.[5] During the streak, on May 28, he hit a game-winning two-run 
home run against Benítez in the tenth inning of a 5–3 win over the Mets.[29] 
He hit a home run and had four RBI the next day as the Phillies beat the 
Mets, 7–3.[30] He hit a game-winning three-run home run on July 4 in a 
4–1 victory over the Atlanta Braves.[31] On July 20, he had a home run 
and five RBI (including the game-winner) as the Phillies beat the Mets, 
10–1.[32] He hit home runs in three straight games from July 31 to August 
2.[33] On August 10, as the Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10–5, 
he hit his third career grand slam.[34] He had a home run and three RBI 
in the final game of the season in a 4–1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.[35] 
Burrell finished the season with 27 home runs, 70 RBI, and a .258 batting 
average in 155 games. His 18 assists led NL outfielders and tied with Raúl 
Mondesí for most in the major leagues.[5] However, his 162 strikeouts were 
the third-highest total in Phillies' history at the time, and they currently 
are the ninth-highest total.[36] Burrell hit a leadoff walk-off home run 
on April 7, 2002, in the 11th inning of a 3–2 victory over the Florida 
Marlins.[37] Three days later, on April 10, Burrell hit a two-run walk-off 
home run in the 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7–5 victory over the 
Braves.[38] He was the first player in the major leagues to hit two such 
home runs in a four-day period since Albert Belle did it in 1995, and he 
was the first Phillie to hit two such in a season since Von Hayes hit two 
in 1989.[5] In May, he hit eight home runs, the most by a Phillie in May 
since teammate Mike Lieberthal hit eight in 1999.[5] From June 2 through 
June 16, he had an 11-game hitting streak, his longest of the season.[5] 
During the streak, on June 2, he tied a career-high with five RBI in an 
18–3 victory over the Montreal Expos.[39] Burrell had 22 home runs by the 
All-Star break, the most by a Phillie since Mike Schmidt had 31 by the 
1979 All-Star break.[5] On July 15, he hit a game-winning three-run home 
run against Matt Herges in an 11–8 victory over Montreal.[40] He had two 
home runs, five RBI, and a grand slam in a 7–6 loss to the Dodgers on August 
9.[41] On August 30, Burrell had three RBI (including the game-winner) 
in a 7–5 victory over the Mets.[42] He had his one hundredth RBI that day, 
becoming the first Phillie with 100 RBI by August 31 since Greg Luzinski 
did it in 1977.[5] Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost 
every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), 
and games (157).[5] He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI 
in a season.[5] His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI 
were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127).[5] 
He was 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting.[43] On February 3, 
2003, Burrell signed a six-year, $50 million contract with the Phillies.[44] 
He had two home runs and five RBI (including the game-winner) on April 
9 in a 16–2 victory over the Braves.[45] The home runs both came against 
Greg Maddux, making Burrell the sixth player to hit two home runs in a 
game against Maddux (and the first since Rolen did it in 2001).[5] On May 
20, he hit two home runs and had four RBI in an 11–7 victory over the Mets.[46] 
On August 9, Burrell hit a game-tying solo home run and a game-winning 
two-run home run in the 8th and 10th innings of an 8–6 victory over the 
San Francisco Giants.[47] He hit two home runs (including his 100th) on 
August 22 in a 9–4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[48] On September 
28, he had the final hit in Veterans Stadium (a single against Jason Marquis) 
in a 5–2 loss to Atlanta.[5][49] Burrell endured a season-long slump, and 
he was occasionally benched for a few games (often in favor of Ricky Ledée) 
by Phillies' manager Larry Bowa.[5][48][50] In 146 games, he batted .209 
with 21 home runs and 64 RBI. However, his 21 home runs were still the 
second-highest total on the Phillies (teammate Jim Thome led the NL with 
47).[5][51] Burrell had four hits and three RBI on April 27, 2004, in a 
7–3 victory over the Cardinals. He also made a leaping catch to take a 
home run away from Rolen, and he threw out Pujols trying to score from 
third base on a single by Édgar Rentería.[52] On May 2, Burrell hit his 
first career pinch-hit home run: a two-run game-tying home run in the ninth 
inning against Matt Mantei of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Phillies won 
the game, 6–5, in extra innings.[5][53] On May 14, Burrell had four RBI 
(including the game-winner) in a 6–4 victory over the Colorado Rockies.[54] 
He had four RBI again on May 18 (including two home runs) in an 8–7 victory 
over the Dodgers.[55] On July 30, he hit two home runs in a 10–7 loss to 
the Cubs.[56] On August 3, Burrell strained his left wrist during batting 
practice, and he was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time 
in his career the next day.[57] He was originally scheduled to have season-ending 
surgery on August 13, but after getting a second opinion from Dr. Tom Graham, 
he decided to postpone the surgery and attempt to come back before the 
season ended.[58] On September 3, he was activated from the disabled list.[59] 
In 127 games, Burrell batted .257 with 24 home runs and 84 RBI.[5] On April 
9, 2005, Burrell had four hits and five RBI in a 10–4 victory over the 
Cardinals.[60] He won the first NL Player of the Week Award of the 2005 
season on April 10 after accumulating 15 RBI in the first week of the season.[61] 
On May 12, he had four hits in a 7–5 loss to Cincinnati.[62] He hit a three-run 
game-winning home run on May 22 in a 7–2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.[63] 
He won another Player of the Week Award that day after he batted .500 with 
two home runs and eight RBI during the week, becoming the first Phillies 
player to win the award twice in a season since Hayes won it twice in 1986.[64] 
On June 5, his solo home run against Mike Koplove was the game-winner in 
a 7–6 victory over Arizona.[65] Four days later, he hit two home runs and 
had four RBI in a 10–8 victory over the Texas Rangers.[66] On June 11, 
he hit a game-winning three-run home run in a 7–5 victory over the Milwaukee 
Brewers.[67] He hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 13–7 victory over 
Florida on July 14.[68] On July 30, he had four hits and two RBI in an 
8–7 victory over Colorado.[69] On August 9, he had four RBI, including 
a go-ahead three-run home run against Steve Schmoll in an 8–4 victory over 
the Dodgers.[70] His three-run home run against Jake Peavy on August 12 
provided all of the Phillies' runs in a 3–2 victory over San Diego.[71] 
He had four RBI on September 9 in a 12–5 victory over the Marlins.[72] 
Two days later, he had four RBI again (including a three-run home run against 
Ismael Valdez) in an 11–1 victory over Florida.[73] Burrell finished the 
season batting .281 with 32 home runs in 154 games, and he set career highs 
in walks (99) and RBI (117).[5] His 32 home runs led the Phillies, and 
his 117 RBI were second only to Andruw Jones' 128 (Pujols also had 117).[5][74] 
On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders 
in errors, with seven, and the lowest fielding percentage among them, at 
.972.[75] Burrell finished seventh in voting for the NL MVP award,[76] 
and he was the co-winner of the Mike Schmidt MVP Award (along with Chase 
Utley).[77] In April 2006, Burrell batted .300 with seven home runs.[78] 
From April 14 to 27, he had 13 RBI in 11 games.[5] However, he batted .249 
for the rest of the season, and in June Philles' manager Charlie Manuel 
began benching him occasionally (often in favor of David Dellucci).[78][79] 
On May 1, Burrell hit a game-winning solo home run in an 8–5 victory over 
Florida.[80] On May 7, he had three RBI, including a two-run home run against 
Matt Morris as the Phillies defeated the Giants, 9–5.[81] On June 9, he 
had three RBI, including a two-run home run against Gary Majewski, but 
the Phillies lost, 9–8, to the Washington Nationals.[82] The next day, 
he hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 6–2 victory over the Nationals.[83] 
On June 15, he hit two home runs and had three RBI against Steve Trachsel, 
but the Phillies lost to the Mets, 5–4.[84] He had four hits and four RBI 
in a 14–6 victory over the Giants on July 15.[85] On August 22, his RBI 
double in the sixth inning was the game-winning RBI in a 6–3 victory over 
the Cubs.[86] His first inning grand slam against Roger Clemens on September 
15 provided all of the Phillies' runs in a 4–3 victory over Houston.[87] 
On September 20, his fielder's choice was the game-winning RBI in a 6–2 
victory over the Cubs.[88] He hit two home runs, had four RBI, and set 
a career high with four runs scored on September 29 in a 14–2 victory over 
Florida.[89] In 144 games, Burrell finished the season batting .258 with 
29 home runs and 95 RBI.[5] Burrell became the Phillies' longest tenured 
player in 2007 with the departure of Lieberthal via free agency.[90] He 
hit only one home run in April but had a .292 batting average.[91] On April 
6, he homered and had four RBI (including the game-winner) in an 8–2 victory 
over Florida.[92] He began to slump after April, batting .157 over the 
next two months. Once again, Manuel began benching him, using Greg Dobbs, 
Jayson Werth, or Michael Bourn in left field.[91][93][94][95] On May 11, 
Burrell hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 7–2 victory over the Cubs.[96] 
Werth was injured at the end of June, however, and Burrell reclaimed his 
starting job by batting .435 in July, with six home runs and 22 RBI.[91][97] 
From July 1 through the end of the season, he batted .300 with 22 home 
runs and 65 RBI, starting the final 75 games of the season for the Phillies 
in left field.[5][91] On July 14, he had four RBI in a 10–4 victory over 
St. Louis.[98] Three days later, Burrell hit his 200th career home run 
in a 15–3 victory over the Dodgers.[99] He had a 14-game hitting streak 
from July 22 to August 5, tying his career high.[5] On August 17, in an 
11–8 victory over the Pirates, Burrell got his 1,000th career hit, a two-run 
home run.[100] At the end of August, the Phillies faced the Mets, whom 
they trailed in the NL East by six games, for a four-game series. In the 
first game of the series, on August 27, Burrell hit a game-winning two-run 
home run in a 9–2 victory.[101] Two days later, in the third game of the 
series, he hit a solo home run and had a sacrifice fly (the game-winning 
RBI) against Óliver Pérez in a 3–2 victory.[102] He hit two home runs in 
the fourth and final game of the series as the Phillies won 11–10 to sweep 
the Mets.[103] On September 21, his two-run home run against Shawn Hill 
provided the game-winning RBI in a 6–3 victory over Washington.[104] Burrell 
finished the 2007 regular season batting .256 with 30 home runs, 97 RBI, 
and 114 walks (a career high) in 155 games. Burrell, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy 
Rollins became the second trio of Phillies with 30 or more home runs (and 
the first since 1929).[105] On defense, he led major league outfielders 
in errors, with 10, and his .948 fielding percentage was the lowest among 
left fielders.[106][107] In 2007, the Phillies won the NL East and reached 
the playoffs for the first time since 1993 and the first time in Burrell's 
career.[5][108][109] Burrell hit a home run against Jeff Francis in the 
first game of the NL Division Series (NLDS) but had only one other hit 
in the series as the Phillies were swept by the Colorado Rockies.[110][111] 
Burrell batted .326 in April 2008, with 8 home runs and 24 RBI.[112] He 
hit two home runs on April 7 (including the game-winner) against Bronson 
Arroyo in a 5–3 victory over Cincinnati.[113] On April 24, his two-run 
double against David Riske provided the game-winning RBI in the Phillies' 
3–1 victory over Milwaukee. With the double, Burrell got his 23rd and 24th 
RBI of the month, breaking Hayes' team record for most RBI in April (22).[114] 
After batting .227 in May (with five home runs), Burrell batted .256 with 
six home runs in June.[112] His walk-off two-run home run with two outs 
in the tenth inning gave the Phillies a 6–5 victory over San Francisco 
on May 2.[115] On May 22, Burrell hit a game-winning pinch-hit home run 
in a 7–5 victory over Houston.[116] On June 3, he hit a game-winning two-run 
home run in a 3–2 victory over Cincinnati.[117] He followed up his performance 
in June by hitting .304 in July with seven home runs, but he slumped over 
the final two months, batting .191 with seven home runs.[112] He hit a 
game-winning three-run home run on July 13 in a 6–3 victory over Arizona.[118] 
On August 15, his home run helped the Phillies defeat the Padres 1–0.[119] 
Two days later, he hit a game-winning home run in a 2–1 victory over the 
Padres.[120] He had five RBI (including a game-winning three-run home run 
against Clayton Kershaw) in a 9–2 victory over the Dodgers on August 23.[105] 
Burrell finished the season batting .250 with 33 home runs (tied for ninth 
in the NL), 86 RBI, and 102 walks (third in the NL) in 157 games, and the 
Phillies won the NL East for the second straight year.[5] In Game 4 (the 
final game) of the NLDS against the Brewers, Burrell hit two home runs 
(a three-run game-winning home run against Jeff Suppan and a solo home 
run against Guillermo Mota) in a 6–2 victory that gave the Phillies their 
first playoff series victory since 1993.[121] Four days later, in the first 
game of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run 
in a 3–2 victory over the Dodgers.[122] After going hitless in his first 
14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of 
the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). 
Burrell was then replaced by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the 
game's winning run in the 4–3 victory as the Phillies won their first World 
Series since 1980.[123] After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the 
Phillies' World Series parade.[124] Burrell filed for free agency on November 
6.[125] On December 16, the Phillies signed left fielder Raúl Ibañez to 
a three-year contract, ending Burrell's tenure in Philadelphia.[126] Burrell's 
104 double plays grounded into were the seventh-most in Phillies history, 
and his 1,273 strikeouts were second only to Schmidt. However, Burrell 
was fifth in walks (785), eighth in RBI (827), and fourth in home runs 
(251) as a Phillie. His eight straight seasons with at least 20 home runs 
were topped only by Schmidt.[36] On January 5, 2009, the Tampa Bay Rays 
signed Burrell to a two-year, $16 million contract. They planned to use 
him as their designated hitter.[127] Burrell got a standing ovation when 
he returned to Philadelphia for an exhibition series on April 3 and 4.[128] 
On April 9, Burrell flew to Philadelphia to join the Phillies as they received 
their World Series rings in a pregame ceremony. After the ceremony, he 
flew back to Boston for the Rays' game against the Boston Red Sox.[129] 
On May 17, Burrell was placed on the disabled list (retroactive to May 
12) with a neck strain.[130] He was activated from the DL on June 11.[131] 
On June 24, he hit a game-winning two-run home run and had three RBI in 
a 7–1 victory over the Phillies.[132] On July 7, he hit a walk-off two-run 
home run in the 11th inning of a 3–1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.[133] 
On September 2, he had a game-winning RBI single in an 8–5 victory over 
Boston.[134] He had four RBI against Jason Berken (including a three-run 
home run) on September 15 in a 10–5 loss to Baltimore.[135] Burrell slumped 
throughout the 2009 season, and he finished the year batting .221 in 122 
games. He set or tied career-lows in hits (91), home runs (14), RBI (64), 
and walks (57).[5] Burrell hit a game-winning two-run home run in the 12th 
inning of a 3–1 victory over Boston on April 17, 2010.[136] On April 27, 
he hit a game-winning three-run home run in an 8–6 victory over the Oakland 
Athletics.[137] In his first 24 games of the season, Burrell batted .202 
with two home runs and 13 RBI. On May 15, he was designated for assignment 
and replaced on the Rays' roster by Hank Blalock.[138] Four days later, 
he became a free agent after clearing waivers.[139] On May 29, 2010, the 
San Francisco Giants signed Burrell to a minor league contract and assigned 
him to the triple-A Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League.[140] 
After batting .313 with one home run and six RBI in five games, he was 
called up to the Giants on June 4 to replace John Bowker, who was optioned 
to Fresno.[141] The next day, he took over from Aubrey Huff (who moved 
over to right field) as the Giants' left fielder.[142][143] On July 31, 
with the Giants trailing 1–0 to the Dodgers in the eighth inning, Burrell 
hit a two-run home run to give the Giants a 2–1 victory.[144] On August 
6, he hit a game-winning sacrifice fly in the 11th inning of a 3–2 victory 
over Atlanta.[145] Three days later, the Giants faced the Chicago Cubs 
for a four-game series. In the first game of the series, Burrell hit a 
walk-off sacrifice fly in the 11th inning of a 4–3 victory.[146] In the 
third game, he had three RBI (including a game-winning home run in the 
eighth inning against Justin Berg) in a 5–4 victory.[147] In the finale, 
Burrell hit two home runs (including a grand slam) and had five RBI in 
an 8–7 victory.[148] On August 17, Burrell returned to Philadelphia for 
his first regular season game there as a member of the opposing team, and 
he received a standing ovation. He hit a home run in his first at bat of 
the game, but the Giants lost, 9–3.[149] With the Giants in 2010, Burrell 
batted .266 with 289 at-bats, 18 home runs, and 51 RBI in 96 games as the 
Giants won the NL West and advanced to the playoffs for the first time 
since 2003. Burrell's 2010 totals were 373 at-bats, 94 hits, 20 home runs, 
and 64 RBI in 120 games.[5] In Game 2 of the NLDS against Atlanta on October 
8, Burrell hit a three-run home run in a 5–4 loss.[150] On October 16, 
in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Phillies, he had an RBI double against 
Roy Halladay. Nate Schierholtz then pinch-ran for him, scoring the winning 
run in the Giants' 4–3 victory.[151] In the World Series, Burrell struck 
out eleven times in thirteen at-bats, had no hits, and was benched for 
Game 4.[111] However, the Giants won the World Series in five games, and 
Burrell received his second championship ring.[152] On November 1, Burrell 
filed for free agency.[1] A month later, on December 3, he signed a one-year, 
$1 million contract to return to the Giants in 2011.[153] In his first 
20 games of 2011, Burrell batted .270 with five home runs and eight RBI.[154] 
On April 18, he hit a game-winning three-run home run in an 8–1 victory 
over Colorado.[155] After batting .172 with one RBI over his next 12 games, 
he was replaced as the Giants' left fielder by Cody Ross, who was replaced 
as the Giants' right fielder by Schierholtz.[154][156][157] On May 4, Burrell 
had a game-winning RBI single in a 2–0 victory over the Mets.[158] In the 
first game of a doubleheader against the Cubs on June 28, Burrell had a 
home run and three RBI in a 13–7 victory.[159] He had a game-winning RBI 
single on July 7 in a 2–1 victory over San Diego.[160] On July 15, Burrell 
was placed on the disabled list with a potentially career-ending foot injury.[161][162] 
He returned from the DL on August 31, but he was not able to start regularly 
upon returning.[163] For the final game of the year (a 6–3 loss to Colorado 
on September 28), Burrell started in left field after asking Giants' manager 
Bruce Bochy to put him in the lineup since it was potentially his final 
game.[164] He finished the year batting .230 with career-lows in games 
(92), at bats (183), hits (42), home runs (seven), and RBI (21).[5] On 
October 30, he filed for free agency.[1] Burrell signed a one-day contract 
with the Philadelphia Phillies on May 19, 2012, so he could officially 
retire as a Phillie.[165] It was announced on February 28, 2015 that Burrell 
will be inducted onto the Phillies Wall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted 
on Friday, July 31. He stated, "I always knew that the fans were behind 
me, even through the tough times. When David (Montgomery) called and told 
me I had been voted in by the fans, it was overwhelming." He was the 37th 
inductee to the Wall of Fame. Burrell showed a penchant for hitting home 
runs against the New York Mets. In 2007, Burrell hit four home runs in 
a four-game series sweep against the Mets in late August.[166] In total, 
he hit 42 home runs against the Mets through the 2011 season, his highest 
total against any team,[167] which ranked fifth all-time in home runs hit 
against the franchise at the time of his departure from Philadelphia[168] 
(he has since fallen to sixth, having been passed by Chipper Jones.) Batting 
.264 at the Phillies' home parks against a .228 mark at Shea Stadium, Burrell 
nonetheless enjoyed playing in New York, citing the atmosphere and memorable 
home runs against Mets pitchers, including two in back-to-back games against 
then-closer Armando Benítez.[168] As of 2015, he is a special assignment 
scout for the Giants, based in Scottsdale, Arizona.[169] Pat had an English 
Bulldog named Elvis who was featured in the Phillies 2008 World Series
