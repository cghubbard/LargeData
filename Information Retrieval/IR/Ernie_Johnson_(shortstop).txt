Ernest Rudolph Johnson (April 29, 1888 – May 1, 1952) was a Major League 
Baseball shortstop. A native of Chicago, he played for the Chicago White 
Sox (1912, 1921–23), St. Louis Terriers (Federal League 1915), St. Louis 
Browns (1916–1918), and New York Yankees (1923–1925). In between, he spent 
1920 with the Salt Lake City Bees as their player-manager. Johnson took 
over the White Sox shortstop job from the recently banned Swede Risberg 
in 1921. He hit .295 and was fourth in the American League with 22 stolen 
bases. In 1922 his batting average dropped to .254 and he had the dubious 
distinction of leading the league in outs (494). He was acquired by the 
Yankees via waivers on May 31, 1923 and he batted .447 for them in a limited 
role. He played in two games of the 1923 World Series against the New York 
Giants and scored the series-deciding run as a pinch runner in game number 
six. Johnson spent the next two years with New York in a part-time role, 
batting .353 and .282. On October 28, 1925 at age 37, Johnson was sent 
to the St. Paul Saints of the American Association as part of a multi-player 
trade. Johnson's career totals for 813 games include 697 hits, 19 home 
runs, 256 runs batted in, 372 runs scored, a .266 batting average, and 
a slugging percentage of .350. After Johnson's playing career, he spent 
several years as a manager in the minor leagues. He managed the Portland 
Beavers from 1926 until 1928 and the Seattle Indians from 1929 until 1933. 
After that, he worked for the Boston Red Sox as an advance scout until 
his death in 1952. His son was former major league second baseman Don Johnson.
