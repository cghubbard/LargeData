The 2014 Los Angeles Dodgers season was the 125th for the franchise in 
Major League Baseball, and their 57th season in Los Angeles. On April 30, 
the Dodgers picked up their 10,000th win since joining the National League 
in 1890. They proceeded to win their second straight NL West championship 
but lost in four games to the St. Louis Cardinals in the Division Series. 
Several players had excellent years: Adrian Gonzalez led the major leagues 
in runs batted in; Dee Gordon led the major leagues in stolen bases and 
triples and Clayton Kershaw led the major leagues in earned run average 
and wins. In addition, both Kershaw and Josh Beckett pitched no-hitters 
during the season. Kershaw won the NL Cy Young Award and the NL MVP Award, 
making him the first National League player to win both awards in the same 
season since Bob Gibson in 1968. After the 2013 season, the Dodgers ended 
their broadcast agreements with Prime Ticket and KCAL-TV. They entered 
into an agreement with Time Warner Cable to start their own regional sports 
network, to be called SportsNet LA, to begin with the 2014 season. This 
marked the end of over-the-air broadcasts of Dodger games, which had begun 
in 1949.[1] On October 12, 2013, they announced that they would not be 
retaining the broadcasting team of Steve Lyons and Eric Collins who had 
worked road games for the team since 2005 (Lyons) and 2009 (Collins).[2] 
On December 2, 2013, the team announced that former Dodger Nomar Garciaparra 
would be part of the new broadcast team.[3] On December 8, it was announced 
that Orel Hershiser would also be joining the broadcast team as a television 
game analyst for road games and that Alanna Rizzo would be joining the 
pre and post game shows.[4] On December 11, Jerry Hairston, Jr. announced 
that he was retiring from baseball to join the Dodgers pre and post game 
broadcasting team.[5] On January 22, 2014, it was announced that KLAC radio 
announcer Charley Steiner would move to the TV booth to call road games 
with Hershiser, while Garciaparra would call road radio broadcasts with 
Rick Monday. Vin Scully, in his 65th year with the Dodgers, would continue 
to call all home telecasts as well as road games from Arizona and San Francisco.[6] 
The new network officially launched on February 25, 2014.[7] However, a 
season long dispute between Time Warner Cable and other content providers, 
most notably DirecTV, led to the new channel only being available in homes 
that were served by Time Warner Cable itself.[8] In September 2014, it 
was announced that in response to the lack of carriage for SportsNet LA, 
the Dodgers' final six games of the regular season would be aired by local 
independent station KDOC-TV—an over-the-air channel that is carried by 
all major television providers in the region.[9] As a result of their lack 
of distribution carriage for the 2014 season, the Dodgers saw a 70% drop 
in television ratings compared to the previous season when they were on 
Prime Ticket and the poorest cable performance by the team since at least 
the mid-1990s. The ratings for Dodger games were second lowest in the Majors, 
ahead of only the Houston Astros, who had similar issues with their cable 
provider, CSN Houston.[10] On October 21, 2013, the team announced that 
Head Athletic Trainer Sue Falsone, the first woman to hold that position 
in a Major sport, would be stepping down to pursue other opportunities.[11] 
The following day, the team fired bench coach Trey Hillman, who had been 
on the staff since 2011.[12] The team also announced that they had chosen 
to pick up the options on pitching coach Rick Honeycutt, and base coaches 
Davey Lopes and Tim Wallach, bringing them back for 2014.[13] On November 
11, the team announced that Wallach would be promoted to the vacant bench 
coach position and that AAA Albuquerque manager Lorenzo Bundy would become 
the new third base coach. They also confirmed that manager Don Mattingly 
and the rest of the coaching staff would be retained for 2014.[14] Mattingly 
agreed to a three-year extension on January 7.[15] On October 31, 2013, 
several Dodgers automatically became free agents the morning after the 
2013 World Series ended. They included pitchers J. P. Howell, Carlos Mármol, 
Ricky Nolasco, Edinson Vólquez, and Brian Wilson, third baseman Juan Uribe 
and utility players Jerry Hairston, Jr., Nick Punto, Skip Schumaker, and 
Michael Young.[16] The same day, the Dodgers declined their 2014 options 
on second baseman Mark Ellis and pitcher Chris Capuano, making them both 
free agents as well.[17] Utility player Elián Herrera was claimed off waivers 
by the Milwaukee Brewers on November 5.[18] On November 20, relief pitcher 
Shawn Tolleson was claimed off waivers by the Texas Rangers.[19] On December 
3, the Dodgers chose not to tender a contract to arbitration-eligible pitcher 
Ronald Belisario, making him a free agent.[20] On October 23, 2013, the 
Dodgers traded OF Alex Castellanos to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for 
minor league OF Jeremy Hazelbaker and cash.[21] The Dodgers acquired RHP 
Seth Rosin from the New York Mets on December 12, 2013, after the Mets 
selected him from the Philadelphia Phillies in the Rule 5 draft.[22] On 
October 22, 2013, the Dodgers announced the signing of Cuban middle-infielder 
Alexander Guerrero to a four-year deal, worth $32 million with incentives.[23] 
On November 25, the Dodgers announced the signing of pitcher Dan Haren 
to a one-year, $10 million contract, that included a vesting player option 
for 2015.[24] On December 5, the Dodgers re-signed relief pitcher Brian 
Wilson to a one-year, $10 million contract, that included a player option 
for 2015[25] and on December 14, they agreed to terms with third baseman 
Juan Uribe on a two-year, $15 million, extension.[26] On December 17, relief 
pitcher J. P. Howell re-signed on a two-year, $11.25 million, contract.[27] 
The team added to an already deep bullpen on December 23, by agreeing to 
separate one-year contracts with Jamey Wright and Chris Perez.[28] On January 
15, 2014, the Dodgers agreed to a seven-year, $215 million, contract extension 
with pitcher Clayton Kershaw. The deal was the largest contract for a pitcher, 
eclipsing Justin Verlander's deal from the previous year.[29] Spring training 
for the 2014 Dodgers began on February 8 when pitchers and catchers reported 
to Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Arizona.[30] On the first day of camp, 
the team also announced that they had signed left handed pitcher Paul Maholm 
to a one-year contract.[31] Maholm would compete with Josh Beckett, who 
missed most of the previous season with an injury, for the fifth starter 
spot.[32] On February 22, the Dodgers signed Cuban shortstop Erisbel Arruebarrena 
to a 5-year $25 million contract and designated infielder Justin Sellers 
for assignment.[33] Due to Major League Baseball scheduling the Dodgers 
to open the season with a couple of games in Sydney, Australia on March 
22, the team had an abbreviated spring training.[34] Starting pitcher Zack 
Greinke injured his calf in his first spring training start, and was ruled 
out for the opening series.[35] Outfielder Matt Kemp, recovering from off-season 
ankle surgery, spent most of the spring training rehabbing and was also 
ruled out for the opening series.[36] On March 9, the team announced that 
Clayton Kershaw and Hyun-jin Ryu would start the two games in Australia 
against the Arizona Diamondbacks.[37] The Dodgers primary position battle 
in spring training was for the second base job, left open by the departure 
of the 2013 starter Mark Ellis. Cuban defector Alexander Guerrero was the 
favorite to land the spot at the start of camp, but concerns about his 
defense opened up the competition. Dee Gordon, who had primarily played 
shortstop in the past as well as non-roster candidates Justin Turner and 
Chone Figgins got time at the position during camp.[38] At the end of camp, 
both Turner and Figgins had their contracts purchased and were added to 
the 40 man roster, while reliever Javy Guerra was designated for assignment.[39] 
The team had a record of 6–10–5 during the Cactus League schedule, which 
concluded on March 16, when the team left Arizona to fly to Australia.[40] 
This season, Major League Baseball scheduled the Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks 
to open the season with a two-game series at the Sydney Cricket Ground 
in Australia. As a result, both teams began spring training earlier than 
usual and played abbreviated Cactus League schedules before flying to Australia 
for the series.[41] Several members of the Dodgers organization expressed 
their dislike of the way the trip would impact their normal-preseason routine 
and their concern over the travel. As a result, the media started portraying 
the Dodgers in a negative light, contrasted with the Diamondbacks seemingly 
supportive stance on the trip.[42] A few days before the start of the series, 
the Dodgers played an exhibition game against the Australian national baseball 
team.[43] Clayton Kershaw made his fourth straight opening day start for 
the Dodgers, joining Don Drysdale, Don Sutton, Fernando Valenzuela and 
Ramón Martínez as the only Dodgers to do so.[44] He allowed a run for the 
first time in 25 opening day innings, but still struck out seven in 6.2 
innings for the 3–1 win. Scott Van Slyke homered and doubled to pace the 
offense.[45] In the second game, Hyun-jin Ryu pitched five scoreless innings 
while striking out five. Yasiel Puig was 3 for 5 with an RBI double, Dee 
Gordon had three hits, an RBI and scored twice and Juan Uribe also had 
three hits and an RBI. The bullpen struggled and let the Diamondbacks get 
back into the game after trailing by seven runs, but the Dodgers won 7–5 
to sweep the two game opening series.[46] The Dodgers returned to Los Angeles 
to play the Freeway Series, three exhibitions against the Los Angeles Angels.[47] 
During that period, they discovered that Kershaw had a sore back, which 
would keep him from starting the domestic opener, and sent him to the disabled 
list for the first time in his career.[48] When the season resumed, on 
March 30, at Petco Park, Hyun-jin Ryu pitched another seven shutout innings 
as the Dodgers pulled ahead 1–0. However, the bullpen faltered as Brian 
Wilson allowed three runs in the eighth without recording an out and the 
team lost 3–1 to the San Diego Padres.[49] A 2-run homer by Yasiel Puig 
led the Dodgers to a 3–2 win the next day as Zack Greinke picked up his 
first win of the season.[50] Dan Haren made his Dodgers debut on April 
3, allowing one unearned run on four hits with six strikeouts and no walks 
in a 5–1 win against the Padres.[51] The Dodgers returned to Dodger Stadium 
for their home opener on April 4. However, Ryu was hit hard and the San 
Francisco Giants jumped to an early 8–0 lead after the second inning and 
held on to win 8–4.[52] A three-run homer by Pablo Sandoval and 10 strikeouts 
by Madison Bumgarner led the Giants to a 7–2 rout of the Dodgers the next 
day.[53] Zack Greinke struck out eight in 10 innings on April 6 and the 
Dodgers got two-home run games from both Matt Kemp and Hanley Ramírez to 
beat the Giants 6–2 in the final game of the series.[54] A walk-off double 
by Carl Crawford in the 10th inning gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win over the 
Detroit Tigers on April 8.[55] Josh Beckett returned from the disabled 
list to make his first start of the season on April 8. He struggled but 
the Dodgers came from behind to send the game into extra innings only to 
lose 7–6 in 10 innings.[56] The Dodgers traveled to Chase Field to play 
the Diamondbacks on April 11. Adrian Gonzalez was 3 for 4 with 5 RBI and 
a homer as the Dodgers won 6–0 in the opener of the series.[57] Greinke 
picked up his third win of the season when he pitched 5⅓ innings while 
allowing only one run and striking out eight the next night. Gonzalez hit 
a two-run homer in the game. The Dodgers won 8–5, despite Brandon League 
allowing three runs to score in the ninth.[58] Gonzalez, Kemp and Juan 
Uribe all homered as the Dodgers completed the sweep of the Diamondbacks 
8–6.[59] The Dodgers next dropped the opener of a three-game series at 
AT&T Park to the Giants in 12 innings.[60] The Giants also won the next 
game, 2–1, despite an effective start by Paul Maholm, who allowed only 
one run in six innings.[61] Ryu pitched seven scoreless innings in the 
series finale as the Dodgers won 2–1, he became the fist Dodger pitcher 
since Orel Hershiser in 1988 to pitch four consecutive scoreless road starts.[62] 
The Dodgers returned home on April 18 for another series with the Diamondbacks. 
They lost the first game of the series 4–2 in 12 innings. This was the 
third straight home extra innings game, matching the longest streak at 
Dodger Stadium (the last of which was in 1982 against the Braves).[63] 
A three-run homer by Andre Ethier paced the team the next day as they won 
8–6.[64] Puig hit a 3-run homer in a 4–1 win in the series finale.[65] 
Cliff Lee dominated the Dodgers 7–0 as the Philadelphia Phillies came to 
town next.[66] A costly error in the 10th inning led to a 3–2 loss the 
next night.[67] Greinke picked up his 4th win while striking out 11 in 
seven-plus innings on April 23. Puig tripled and Hanley Ramírez hit a homer 
and double to pace the offense in the 5–2 win over the Phillies.[68] Brian 
Wilson allowed four runs in the ninth inning as the Phillies took the final 
game of the series, 7–3.[69] Josh Beckett was brilliant on April 25 against 
the Colorado Rockies, striking out six and allowing only two runs in eight 
innings. However, the Dodgers dropped another extra innings contest, 5–4.[70] 
Kemp and Gonzalez both homered in the Dodgers 6–3 the next day.[71] Ryu 
was pounded in the final game of the homestand and the Dodgers lost to 
the Rockies 6–1.[72] The Dodgers went back on the road, to cold and wet 
Minnesota, where the first game of the series against the Minnesota Twins 
on April 29 was postponed because of the poor weather, rescheduled as part 
of a double-header two days later.[73] The action got back under way on 
April 30 at Target Field as Zack Greinke improved to 5–0 on the season 
and the Dodgers racked up their 10,000th win since joining the National 
League with a 6–4 victory.[74] Yasiel Puig and Juan Uribe had four hits 
each and Dan Haren picked up his fourth win of the season (with no losses) 
in the Dodgers 9–4 victory in game one of the doubleheader against the 
Twins on May 1.[75] The Dodgers called up minor league pitcher Red Patterson 
to start the second game of the doubleheader. Solo homers by Scott Van 
Slyke and Drew Butera in the 12th inning led to a 4–3 win and a sweep of 
the inter-league series.[76] The Dodgers traveled to Miami for a series 
against the Marlins at Marlins Park. The tired team fell behind 6–0 in 
the opener, staged a late rally but lost 6–3.[77] On May 3, Dee Gordon 
had five hits and three steals and Carl Crawford hit a two-run homer in 
the 11th inning to give the Dodgers a 9–7 win.[78] A walk-off double by 
Jeff Baker gave the Marlins a 5–4 win in the last game of the series.[79] 
The Dodgers sat through a three-hour rain delay in the middle of their 
series opener against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park only to 
lose 4–0 when the offense took a day off.[80] Clayton Kershaw returned 
from the disabled list and pitched seven scoreless innings while striking 
out nine in the Dodgers 8–3 win.[81] Dan Haren lost for the first time 
in the final game of the road trip, as the Dodgers offense was stymied 
by Stephen Strasburg and they lost 3–2.[82] The Dodgers returned home to 
drop the opener of a four-game series against the Giants, 3–1, in 10 innings 
as the struggling bullpen walked three batters in that inning.[83] The 
losing streak hit three games in a row as Madison Bumgarner stymied their 
offense in another 3–1 defeat.[84] The Dodgers won the next game in the 
series, 6–2 thanks to a strong effort from lead-off hitter Dee Gordon. 
He had two hits, scored two runs, stole three bases and had the tie-breaking 
RBI double in the seventh inning.[85] The Dodgers staged a late inning 
comeback to send the series finale into extra innings but the bullpen faltered 
again and they lost 7–4.[86] A 3-run homer by Puig carried the Dodgers 
to a 6–5 victory over the Marlins on May 12.[87] Josh Beckett picked up 
his first win since September 30, 2012, the next day, as the Dodgers defeated 
the Marlins 7–1.[88] Paul Maholm was awful the next day, giving up 10 runs 
on 11 hits as the team was blown out 13–3.[89] Back on the road against 
the Diamondbacks, Puig and Van Slyke each homered and Greinke picked up 
his league leading seventh run in the 7–0 win.[90] On May 17, Kershaw had 
the shortest start of his career, lasting only 1⅔ innings and allowing 
seven runs in what became an 18–7 loss.[91] Poor defense contributed to 
a 5–3 loss in the series finale.[92] The team next traveled to Citi Field 
for a series against the New York Mets. They won the opener 9–4 as Adrian 
Gonzalez had three hits, including a tie-breaking home run.[93] He homered 
again the next day, as did Puig and Hanley Ramírez as Hyun-jin Ryu came 
off the disabled list to beat the Mets 4–3.[94] However they lost the series 
finale, 5–3.[95] Kershaw rebounded to pitch six shutout innings, sandwiched 
around a 45-minute rain delay, as the Dodgers won the opener of a series 
from the Philadelphia Phillies, 2–0, at Citizens Bank Park.[96] More shoddy 
defense led to a 5–3 defeat the next day.[97] The Dodgers ended the road 
trip with a 6–0 win over the Phillies as Josh Beckett pitched his first 
career no hitter, and the first by a Dodger pitcher since Hideo Nomo in 
1996.[98] The Dodgers returned home on Memorial Day and Ryu took a perfect 
game into the 8th inning against the Cincinnati Reds before allowing a 
lead-off double to Todd Frazier. The bullpen again struggled, and the Reds 
closed the gap before the Dodgers held on to win 4–3.[99] Andre Ethier 
homered, tripled and drove in four runs in the 6–3 win over the Reds on 
the 27th as Grienke struck out 11 in his 7⅔ innings.[100] Brandon Phillips 
hit a two-run homer in the 1st inning and the Reds held on to defeat the 
Dodgers 3–2 as the series wrapped up.[101] They lost again the next day, 
6–3, to the Pittsburgh Pirates.[102] The Dodgers were shut down by Francisco 
Liriano in a 2–1 loss the following day.[103] Hanley Ramírez woke up the 
Dodgers offense by going 4 for 4 with 2 homers and 5 RBI as the Dodgers 
routed the Pirates 12–2 to finish the month of May with a 15–15 record.[104] 
June started off with a loss as Andrew McCutchen was 3 for 4 with two doubles 
and a home run in the Pirates 5–3 win over the Dodgers.[105] Clayton Kershaw 
struck out nine while allowing only two runs in eight innings on June 2 
against the Chicago White Sox and the Dodgers scored five unearned runs 
in the bottom of the sixth thanks to two White Sox errors to win 5–2.[106] 
Two home runs, including a two-run blast by José Abreu, gave the White 
Sox a 4–1 win in the second game of the series.[107] Two solo homers by 
the White Sox allowed them to beat the Dodgers, who only got two hits in 
the game, 2–1, as the homestand came to an end.[108] Dee Gordon had three 
hits, including two triples, in the Dodgers 7–2 win over the Colorado Rockies 
at Coors Field on June 6. He was the first Dodgers player with two triples 
in a game since Rafael Furcal in 2010.[109] Tim Federowicz hit a three-run 
homer the next day, but the Dodgers still lost 5-4 in 10 innings on a walk-off 
triple by Brandon Barnes.[110] The final game of the Rockies series was 
called off after 5½ innings because of rain but the Dodgers were credited 
with a 6–1 win. Clayton Kershaw struck out nine batters in the five innings, 
becoming the first pitcher in Major League history to record four straight 
games of exactly nine strikeouts. The game was the Dodgers first regulation 
game called before nine innings since a 2004 game that was also at Coors 
Field.[111] Scott Van Slyke hit two home runs and drove in four on June 
9 as the Dodgers beat the Cincinnati Reds 6–2 at Great American Ball Park.[112] 
Josh Beckett threw six shutout innings and the Dodgers racked up 12 hits 
in a 6–1 win over the Reds after a two-hour rain delay before the second 
game of the series.[113] The Dodgers struck out 12 times, managed only 
four hits, and were shut out 5–0 by Johnny Cueto on June 11[114] and wound 
up with a series split after dropping a day game the following day, 4–1.[115] 
The team returned home on June 13 and Kershaw allowed only one run in seven 
innings while striking out seven and Matt Kemp homered as they beat the 
Arizona Diamondbacks 4–3.[116] A two-run homer by Dee Gordon and a three-run 
double by Dan Haren helped the Dodgers to a 6–4 win the next night.[117] 
Sloppy defense and base running errors contributed to a 6–3 loss in the 
last game of the series, on Father's Day.[118] Gordon was 4 for 4 and scored 
twice in the Dodgers 6–1 win over the Rockies the next night.[119] Matt 
Kemp moved into sixth place on the Dodgers all time homer list on June 
18, passing Raúl Mondesí with his 164th, as the team won 4–2.[120] On June 
18, Kershaw pitched a complete game no-hitter against the Rockies and struck 
out a career-high 15 batters in the process. The Dodgers won 8–0. Combined 
with Beckett's earlier no-hitter, they were the first two Dodgers to throw 
no-hitters in the same season since Carl Erskine and Sal Maglie in 1956.[121] 
The Dodgers next traveled down the freeway to open a three-game series 
against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park. Kenley Jansen blew the save 
and the game by allowing three runs in the ninth inning and the Padres 
walked off with a 6–5 win.[122] Beckett pitched seven shutout innings while 
allowing only four hits and striking out eight in the Dodgers 4–2 win in 
the next game.[123] Hyun-jin Ryu only allowed one run in six innings as 
the Dodgers won the series finale 2–1.[124] The Dodgers next lost the opener 
of an interleague series at Kauffman Stadium against the Kansas City Royals, 
5–3.[125] In his next start, Kershaw pitched eight more shutout innings 
while striking out eight batters in a 2–0 win.[126] They finished off the 
road-trip with a 5–4 win over the Royals, where the winning road scored 
when A. J. Ellis was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the top of 
the eighth.[127] Back at Dodger Stadium, Josh Beckett engaged in a pitcher's 
duel with Adam Wainwright of the St. Louis Cardinals in a game that remained 
scoreless until a pinch hit RBI single by Justin Turner in the bottom of 
the eighth gave the Dodgers their one run in a 1–0 win.[128] The Cardinals 
won the next night, 3–1, as the offense again sputtered.[129] Zack Greinke 
picked up his 10th win of the season on June 28, when he struck out 10 
in seven innings. The Dodgers offense exploded for 15 hits and nine runs 
as they picked up a 9–1 win.[130] In the series finale, Kershaw struck 
out 13 in seven innings and extended his scoreless streak to 28 consecutive 
innings, the longest streak in Dodgers history since Orel Hershiser's record 
breaking 1988 season. The Dodgers won 6–0 to move into a share of first 
place with the Giants.[131] The next night, Dan Haren allowed only one 
hit in seven shutout innings and Clint Robinson's first major league hit 
drove in the game's only run as the Dodgers beat the Cleveland Indians 
1–0. After falling 9½ games back at the start of the month, the Dodgers 
ended the month of June with a half game lead over the Giants in the division.[132] 
The Dodgers started July by being blown out by the Indians 10–3. They left 
10 men on base, including stranding the bases loaded three times and hitting 
into a triple play.[133] Hyun-jin Ryu allowed only two runs and two hits 
the next day, but the bullpen allowed three runs in the top of the eighth 
and the Dodgers lost 5–4.[134] Zack Greinke allowed only two runs (one 
earned) in eight innings on July 3 at Coors Field and a Juan Uribe RBI 
single in the top of the ninth gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win over the Rockies.[135] 
On the fourth of july, Clayton Kershaw allowed only two hits and no runs 
in eight innings while striking out eight in the team's 9-0 win.[136] Dan 
Haren struck out a season high eight batters on July 5, but also allowed 
a season high eight runs and 10 hits. The Dodgers scored five runs in the 
fifth in an attempted comeback but fell one run short in an 8-7 loss.[137] 
The Dodgers cruised to an 8-2 win in the series finale behind Josh Beckett's 
five scoreless innings. However, he walked three in the game which ended 
the Dodgers MLB record streak for consecutive starts with no more than 
two walks at 39.[138] After the game, the Dodgers learned that they had 
four players selected to the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. 
Kershaw and Greinke were selected to the team, the fourth straight selection 
for Kershaw. Yasiel Puig was voted as a starter by the fan voting and Dee 
Gordon was selected as a reserve.[139] Hyun-jin Ryu was unable to get out 
of the third inning as he allowed seven runs on ten hits and the Dodgers 
were pounded by the Detroit Tigers 14-5 at Comerica Park.[140] Max Scherzer 
out dueled Greinke in a battle of former Cy Young Award winners and the 
Dodgers ended their road trip with a 4-1 loss to the Tigers.[141] Back 
home, Kershaw pitched a three-hit complete game against the San Diego Padres 
on July 10. However, he allowed a run to score for the first time in nearly 
a month. He had pitched 41 consecutive scoreless innings, the third longest 
in Dodgers history behind Orel Hershiser and Don Drysdale. The Dodgers 
won 2-1.[142] However, they lost 6-3 the next night as the bats were unable 
to solve rookie Jesse Hahn and Dan Haren struggled.[143] In the following 
game, Paul Maholm started for the Dodgers in place of the injured Josh 
Beckett and pitched six scoreless innings. Ian Kennedy pitched eight scoreless 
for the Padres to match him. A walk-off sacrifice fly by A. J. Ellis in 
the ninth led to the only run of the game in the Dodgers 1–0 victory.[144] 
They won the following game, also 1-0, and the Dodgers headed into the 
All-Star break with the top record in the National League, 54-43.[145] 
They resumed play on July 18 after the break with a 3–2 loss to the St. 
Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium.[146] The next game, Grienke gave up four 
runs in the first inning and the Dodgers were shut down by Joe Kelly and 
lost 4–2.[147] Kershaw struck out eight in seven innings in his next start, 
but allowed a costly two-run homer to Peter Bourjos. However, this time 
the Dodgers came back and won the game on a ninth-inning single by Adrian 
Gonzalez, 4–3.[148] The Dodgers next traveled to Pittsburgh to open a three-game 
series at PNC Park. Hanley Ramírez and Yasiel Puig were both held out of 
most of the series against the Pirates due to injuries suffered in the 
Cardinals series. Still, Ryu pitched well in game one and the team won 
5–2.[149] Josh Beckett returned to the rotation after a brief stint on 
the disabled list but allowed four runs in only 3 2/3 innings and another 
bullpen implosion led to a 12–7 loss in the next game.[150] Dan Haren lost 
his fourth straight start on July 23 as the Dodgers dropped the final game 
of the series 6–1.[151] The Dodgers next traveled to AT&T Park for a crucial 
series against the San Francisco Giants. In the opener, Puig hit three 
triples, tying a franchise record set by Jimmy Sheckard in 1901. His 11 
total bases in the game were career highs and the most by a Dodger since 
Kevin Elster has 12 in 2000. Zack Greinke struck out 10 in seven scoreless 
innings and the Dodgers cruised to an 8–1 win.[152] Kershaw followed that 
up with a two-hit shutout for a 5–0 win.[153] The Dodgers completed the 
sweep over the Giants with a 4–3 victory on July 27.[154] The team returned 
home on July 29 to play the Atlanta Braves. Puig had four hits in five 
at-bats and Matt Kemp hit two home runs in the Dodgers' 8–4 win to secure 
the team's first four-game winning streak of the season. The Dodgers had 
nine extra base hits in the game, the most since September 18, 2006.[155] 
In the next game, Kemp homered again and also hit a walk-off single in 
the 10th inning as the Dodgers won 3–2. Greinke struck out 13 in eight 
innings in the game, while walking only one.[156] Kershaw pitched a nine 
strikeout complete game as the Dodgers swept the Braves 2–1 to end July 
with a six-game winning streak.[157] Dan Haren's struggles continued as 
the calendar moved into August. He allowed seven runs in 4 1/3 innings 
as the Dodgers were blown out by the Chicago Cubs, 8–2, to snap the winning 
streak.[158] Hanley Ramírez hit a walk-off homer the next day as the Dodgers 
won 5–2 in extra innings.[159] Matt Kemp hit his fifth home run in six 
games on August 3, but poor pitching from Josh Beckett and several relief 
pitchers led to a 7–3 loss to the Cubs.[160] The Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim jumped out to a quick lead in the first inning and Garrett Richards 
pitched a complete game shutout in their 5–0 win over the Dodgers in the 
opener of the next series.[161] Juan Uribe hit a three-run homer the next 
night and the Dodgers won on a walk-off grounder by Andre Ethier for a 
5–4 win.[162] The series switched to Angel Stadium of Anaheim the following 
day and after five terrible starts that had fans calling for his head, 
Dan Haren picked up his first win in over a month, as the Dodgers won 2–1. 
He allowed only three hits in 7 1/3 innings.[163] The Dodgers finished 
off the interleague series when Hyun-jin Ryu combined with two relievers 
on a two hit shutout as they won 7–0.[164] After struggling in his last 
few starts, an MRI revealed that Josh Beckett had aggravated his injured 
hip and he returned to the disabled list. The Dodgers traded for Roberto 
Hernández, who started the opener of a series against the Milwaukee Brewers 
at Miller Park on August 8. He was solid, allowing only two runs over six 
innings, but a defensive meltdown in the seventh led to a disappointing 
9–3 loss.[165] Zack Greinke allowed four runs in six innings the next day 
and the Dodgers lost 4–1.[166] Clayton Kershaw allowed only one run in 
eight innings as the Dodgers avoided the sweep with a 5–1 win. He upped 
his personal win streak to 11 games, the longest win streak by a Dodger 
starter since Orel Hershiser in 1985.[167] Another recent trade acquisition, 
Kevin Correia started for the Dodgers at Turner Field against the Atlanta 
Braves on August 11. He allowed only one run in six innings while the Dodgers 
offense came up with enough runs in a 6–2 win.[168] Another good performance 
by Dan Haren led to a 4–2 win the next day.[169] The Braves took the next 
game in the series, 3–2, after the Dodgers hit into a game-ending double 
play with the bases loaded in the ninth.[170] Dee Gordon scored four runs 
and stole two bases as the Dodgers won the series with a 6–4 victory on 
August 14.[171] The Dodgers returned home for another series against the 
Brewers. A bullpen meltdown led to a 6–3 loss in the first game, with the 
Brewers scoring five of the runs in the eighth inning.[172] In the next 
game, Kershaw pitched a complete game, striking out ten and allowing only 
five hits.. however two of the hits were homers and the team lost 3–2. 
It was Kershaw's first loss in 14 starts.[173] Dan Haren lasted just three 
innings as the Brewers finished off a three-game series sweep of the Dodgers 
with a 7–2 rout in the series finale.[174] Carl Crawford had three hits 
in three at-bats with a home run and a stolen base as the Dodgers ended 
their three-game losing streak with an 8–6 win over the San Diego Padres 
on August 19.[175] Three Dodgers errors contributed to a 4–1 defeat the 
next day,[176] but they won the final game of the series 2–1. Kershaw allowed 
only one run and three hits in eight innings while striking out 10 and 
a 2-run homer by Justin Turner in the 8th inning gave the Dodgers their 
first win of the season while trailing after the seventh inning.[177] Haren 
bounced back, allowing only one run in seven innings as the Dodgers beat 
the New York Mets 6–2 on August 22.[178] Adrian Gonzalez hit a three-run 
homer and had a season high five RBI in the Dodgers 7–4 win the following 
day.[179] Kevin Correia unraveled in the third inning and allowed five 
runs thanks to two homers. The Dodgers were blown out 11–3 in the game.[180] 
A couple of replay challenges helped the Dodgers put up six runs in the 
fourth inning as they beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 9–5 at Chase Field 
on August 26.[181] Kershaw picked up his 16th win of the season the following 
day, and Kenley Jansen recorded his 100th career save as the Dodgers won 
3–1 to sweep the brief two game series.[182] The team then dropped the 
opening of a series against the Padres at Petco Park, 3–2 in 12 innings.[183] 
In the second game, the team squandered a strong start by Zack Greinke 
and lost again in extra innings, on a walk-off hit by Alexi Amarista in 
the 10th inning.[184] Hyun-jin Ryu came off the disabled list on August 
31 and pitched seve strong innings and Adrian Gonzalez had four hits as 
the Dodgers avoided the sweep with a 7–2 win.[185] The Dodgers began the 
month of September by hosting the Washington Nationals for a three-game 
series in a matchup of the teams with the top two records in the National 
League. In the first game, the Nationals hit four home runs off of Roberto 
Hernández, including two by Denard Span and they beat the Dodgers 6–4.[186] 
Clayton Kershaw struck out eight batters the next night in eight innings, 
while allowing only a solo home run by Bryce Harper as the Dodgers won 
4–1. In the process, Kershaw moved past the 200 strikeout mark for the 
fifth straight season, joining Sandy Koufax as the only Dodger pitchers 
to accomplish that,[187] and just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have 
at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, 
Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).[188] Kenley Jansen allowed 
three runs in the ninth to blow his save opportunity and the Nationals 
came back to defeat the Dodgers 8–5 in a 14 inning marathon. This was the 
Dodgers longest game of the year.[189] After a much needed day off, they 
returned to action on September 5 with a 2–1 victory over the Diamondbacks. 
Dan Haren allowed one run on four hits in six innings and Matt Kemp homered 
in the win.[190] Three hits and a key RBI single by Dee Gordon and a 2 
RBI double by Hanley Ramírez helped the Dodgers win the next game, 5–2.[191] 
Adrian Gonzalez homered twice and drove in six runs as the Dodgers completed 
the sweep of the Diamondbacks with a 7–2 win on September 7.[192] Kershaw 
picked up his 18th win when he allowed only one earned run in eight innings 
as the Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 9–4.[193] The Dodgers four-game 
winning streak was snapped as Hanley Ramírez committed a couple of errors 
in the second inning and Roberto Hernández only lasted three innings as 
they lost the game 6–3.[194] The Dodgers finished off the home stand with 
a 4–0 shutout of the Padres. Carl Crawford had four hits in four at-bats 
in the game with three doubles. That tied the Dodgers record for most doubles 
in a game, a mark last accomplished by Matt Kemp in 2011. Dan Haren pitched 
seven scoreless innings to pick up his 13th win and this was the first 
time the Dodgers had four starters with 13 or more wins since 1985 when 
Orel Hershiser, Fernando Valenzuela, Jerry Reuss and Bob Welch reached 
that mark.[195] The Dodgers, holding a two-game lead in the division, traveled 
up the coast to begin a key three game series against the team trailing 
them in the standings, the San Francisco Giants, at AT&T Park. Hyun-jin 
Ryu was tagged for four runs in the first before leaving the game with 
shoulder irritation in a contest the Dodgers lost 9–0.[196] Hanley Ramírez 
did hit a double in the game which gave the Dodgers four players with at 
least 30 doubles (Gonzalez, Kemp and Puig were the others) for the first 
time since 2003 (Shawn Green, Paul Lo Duca, Jolbert Cabrera and Adrián 
Beltré).[197] The Dodgers came back the next night and got even. They scored 
four runs in the first to knock Tim Hudson out of the game and cruised 
to a 17–0 victory. Zack Greinke allowed only four hits in six scoreless 
innings and also hit a double and a two-run homer. The game was the Dodgers 
most lopsided victory and most one-sided shutout against the Giants since 
the teams moved to the West Coast in 1958. The Dodgers had the most hits 
(24) by any team in AT&T Park history and the most hits by an opponent 
against the Giants since 1932. Dee Gordon also picked up his 60th stolen 
base in the game, the first Dodger to reach that mark since Juan Pierre 
in 2007.[198] The two opposing shutouts equalled the largest consecutive 
shutout run differential since a game between the Chicago White Stockings 
and the Washington Nationals on May 27–28, 1886.[199] Kershaw picked up 
his 19th win the following day, pitching eight innings while allowing two 
runs and striking out nine. He became the first Dodger starter to last 
at least eight innings in seven straight starts since Orel Hershiser in 
1988. Matt Kemp hit a two run home run in the 4–2 win, the 177th of his 
career, tying Mike Piazza for fourth on the all-time L.A. Dodger list.[200] 
They next traveled to Coors Field and blew out the Rockies 11–3.[201] The 
following night, the Dodgers outhit the Rockies 16–9 but were unable to 
bring many runs in and lost 10–4 as they stranded 10 runners on base.[202] 
In the final game of the series, Carlos Frías became the first pitcher 
in the modern era to allow 10 hits without getting at least three outs. 
The Dodgers were pounded 16–2.[203] The Dodgers fell behind the Chicago 
Cubs in the next game, at Wrigley Field, but used a five run seventh inning 
to come back and win the game 8–4.[204] The Dodgers scored six times in 
the first inning of the next game and A. J. Ellis his two home runs en 
route to a 14–5 victory over the Cubs. Kershaw picked up his 20th win of 
the season, joining Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale and Claude Osteen as the 
only L.A. Dodger pitchers to have multiple 20 win seasons. Kershaw also 
joined Pedro Martínez as the only pitchers to win 20 games in less than 
30 starts.[205] The Dodgers clinched a playoff berth later that night when 
the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Milwaukee Brewers.[206] Adrian Gonzalez 
hit two home runs with five RBI in the September 20 game against the Cubs 
to pull out to a 6–2 lead but the bullpen faltered and the Cubs, led by 
two homers by Chris Coghlan came back to win 8–7.[207] Matt Kemp homered 
with four hits and four RBI as the Dodgers finished up their last road 
trip of the regular season with a 8–5 victory over the Cubs.[208] The Dodgers 
returned home on September 22 with a 4 1/2 game lead in the division to 
begin their final homestand of the season against the second place Giants 
before a crowd of 53,500, the largest in the Majors in 2014. Dan Haren 
allowed only one hit (a leadoff home run by Gregor Blanco) in his seven 
innings of work but the Dodgers defense coughed up three errors and the 
team failed to get a hit after the sixth inning. The Giants eventually 
won 5–2 in 13 innings.[209] In the following game, Grienke pitched eight 
innings and Justin Turner hit two home runs as the Dodgers won 4–2 to cut 
their magic number to one.[210] Clayton Kershaw struck out 11 while only 
allowing one run in eight innings and the Dodgers jumped on the Giants 
and won 9–1 on September 24 to clinch their second straight National League 
West division championship and home field advantage in the Divisional Round 
of the playoffs.[211] With the team resting several regulars the next game, 
Scott Elbert picked up his first win in two years and the Dodgers beat 
the Rockies 7–4.[212] Scott Van Slyke had two hits, two steals and scored 
the winning run on a wild pitch in the 12th inning as the Dodgers beat 
the Rockies 6–5 in the second to last game of the regular season.[213] 
Juan Uribe managed the team in the season finale and they hit three home 
runs to finish off the Rockies 10–5. The Dodgers finished the regular season 
with a record of 94–68.[214] The Dodgers took on the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the Division Series. This was the fourth meeting of the two clubs in 
the post-season in the last ten years, with the Cardinals having eliminated 
the Dodgers most recently in the 2013 National League Championship Series.[215] 
In the first game, the Dodgers took a 6–1 lead, thanks to A. J. Ellis who 
had four hits, including a home run. Clayton Kershaw, who only allowed 
two hits in the first six innings (two solo homers), hit the wall in the 
seventh. The Cardinals loaded the bases on three singles and then Matt 
Carpenter cleared the bases with a double to give the Cardinals the lead. 
A three-run home run by Matt Holliday off relief pitcher Pedro Báez put 
the game away, though the Dodgers did mount a rally to make the final score 
10–9. Kershaw with 10 strikeouts joined Sandy Koufax as the only Dodgers 
in history with multiple 10 strikeout games in the post-season, though 
he was also the first pitcher in history to allow eight runs while striking 
out 10.[216] In game two, Zack Greinke shut out the Cardinals on two hits 
over seven innings, while striking out seven. Carpenter again provided 
the key blow for the Cardinals, with a two-run homer off reliever J. P. 
Howell in the eighth to tie up the game. Matt Kemp hit a solo homer in 
the bottom of the eighth to give the Dodgers back the lead and Kenley Jansen 
closed it out for a 3–2 win and even the series.[217] Hyun-jin Ryu made 
the start for the Dodgers at Busch Stadium in Game 3, his first appearance 
since leaving a game against the Giants with an injury on September 12. 
He pitched well, allowing only one run (on another Carpenter homer) and 
four hits in six innings. However, the Dodgers were also only able to push 
across one run against Cardinals starter John Lackey. For the third straight 
game, the bullpen faltered. This time it was Scott Elbert who allowed a 
two-run homer to Kolten Wong, the difference maker in the 3–1 loss.[218] 
In game four, Kershaw started on three-days rest and pitched a one-hit 
shutout threw the first six innings. The Dodgers took a 2–0 lead but in 
a repeat of the first game, it fell apart in the seventh. Matt Adams came 
up with two on and hit and three-run homer that was the decisive blow. 
The Cardinals won 3–2 and eliminated the Dodgers in the post-season for 
the second straight year.[219] Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches List
