Frank DeHass Robison (1852 â€“ September 25, 1908) was an American businessman, 
best known as a baseball executive. He was the organizer of the Cleveland 
Spiders franchise, and owned or part-owned the club throughout its existence, 
from its founding in 1887 as the Cleveland Blues until 1899. Along with 
his brother, Stanley Robison, he was also co-owner of the St. Louis Perfectos/Cardinals 
baseball team of the National League from 1899 through 1911.[1] After briefly 
attending Delaware University, Robison went into business with his father-in-law, 
Charles Hathaway, operating streetcars in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1887, he 
used funds from this business to start up a baseball team, the Cleveland 
Blues (called the Forest Citys in some sources). He continued to operate 
in both areas for the next two decades, including financing the construction 
of League Park in 1889, and the formation of the Cleveland City Railway 
Company in 1893.[1] In 1899, the Robison brothers were responsible for 
the worst Major League Baseball team in history, the 1899 Cleveland Spiders. 
Before the season, the Robisons purchased the bankrupt St. Louis Browns 
from Chris von der Ahe and renamed them the Perfectos. During the single 
season in which they owned both the Spiders and Perfectos, the brothers 
transferred the best players of both franchises to St. Louis, leaving the 
Spiders with a team that finished with a record of 20-134, the worst full-season 
record ever for a major league baseball team. Following this debacle (and 
a similar one involving the Baltimore Orioles and Brooklyn Superbas), the 
practice of allowing the same owners to run multiple teams was outlawed.[1] 
Following Robison's death in 1908, Stanley Robison became sole owner of 
the Cardinals until his death in 1911, when the franchise was bequeathed
