The Boston Red Sox' 2003 season included the Red Sox attempting to win 
the American League East division, the ALDS, and the American League pennant. 
The Sox settled for the AL Wild Card and entered the first round against 
the Oakland Athletics. Despite losing the first two games in Oakland, Boston 
rebounded with two dramatic wins in the late innings at Fenway Park to 
even the series. When the series returned to Oakland, the Red Sox held 
off a late Oakland charge to win the series in five games. In doing so, 
they joined the 1995 Mariners and 1999 Boston Red Sox as the only teams 
to come back to win a best-of-five ALDS since the playoff expansion in 
1994. The stage was set for a classic showdown with their longtime division 
rival New York Yankees. The teams split the first two games in the Bronx 
before the real drama unfolded in Game 3 at Fenway Park. A highly anticipated 
matchup between Sox ace Pedro Martínez and former Sox' pitcher Roger Clemens 
turned ugly early on. Karim García was hit in the back by a Martinez fastball. 
Words were exchanged and Martínez threateningly gestured towards Yankee 
catcher Jorge Posada. When Garcia was forced out at second, he slid hard 
into Todd Walker. The following inning, Manny Ramírez took exception to 
a high Clemens pitch and charged the mound. Both benches cleared, but the 
resulting brawl turned surreal when 72-year-old Yankee bench coach Don 
Zimmer charged Martínez. Pedro sidestepped and threw Zimmer to the ground. 
After the thirteen-minute delay, Clemens struck out Ramírez and proceeded 
to pitch effectively as the Yankees took a 2-1 series lead. The Red Sox 
won Game 4, but the Yankees won Game 5 to takes the series' lead back to 
New York. But Boston proved resilient, and their offense came alive for 
the first time in the series to the tune of nine runs on sixteen hits to 
force a seventh game. With a 4-0 lead early on and Martínez, Boston appeared 
to be on the brink of winning the pennant. But more late-inning drama unfolded 
when the Yankees tied the game with three eighth-inning runs off Martínez, 
sending the game on into the October night. Yankee closer Mariano Rivera 
pitched three scoreless innings, and in the bottom of the eleventh, Aaron 
Boone turned on the first offering from Tim Wakefield and sent it into 
the frenzied bleachers of Yankee Stadium, sending the Yankees on to the 
World Series for the fifth time in six years. This game further cemented 
the legend many believed was The Curse of the Bambino. Despite the crushing 
loss, all was not lost on the Red Sox' season. They led the Major leagues 
in nearly all offensive categories, including runs scored (961), batting 
average (.289), on-base percentage (.360), and perhaps most impressively, 
a .491 team slugging percentage, which set a new record previously held 
by the 1927 Yankees.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
