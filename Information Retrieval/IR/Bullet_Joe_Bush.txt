Leslie Ambrose "Bullet Joe" Bush (November 27, 1892 – November 1, 1974) 
was a pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Red Sox, New York 
Yankees, St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, Pittsburgh Pirates, and 
New York Giants. He is credited with having developed the forkball pitch.[1] 
Bush helped the Athletics win the 1913 World Series and the 1914 American 
League pennant, the Red Sox win the 1918 World Series, the Yankees win 
the 1922 AL pennant and 1923 World Series and the Pirates win the 1927

he won 15 games; the entire team won only 36 during what was then a Major 
League-worst 36-117 (.235 won-loss percentage) season. This was 41.7% of 
the team's total wins. On August 26 of that season, Bush no-hit the Cleveland 
Indians 5-0 at Shibe Park; a first inning, leadoff walk to Jack Graney 
was the only thing that kept him from a perfect game. Bush finished fourth
