Purple, white           The Syracuse Stars was a 19th-century American 
baseball team, as well as the name of the minor league baseball teams which 
preceded it, based in Syracuse, New York. They played their home games 
at Newell Park. (They were unrelated to the Syracuse Stars of the American 
Association, who played for one year, in 1890.) Established as an independent 
team in 1877, the Stars joined the International Association for the 1878 
season. They finished second to the pennant-winning Buffalo Bisons, and 
following the season both teams jumped to the National League, a devastating 
blow for the IA, which lasted just two more seasons. The Stars lone year 
in the NL, 1879, was not so successful. The team had a record of 22 wins 
and 48 losses, and did not finish their season, folding on September 10.[1] 
They were 7th in the 8-team National League, ahead of the 19-56 Troy Trojans, 
who also did not complete their schedule. The club officially disbanded 
at the end of the season. Mike Dorgan managed 43 of the Stars' games (with 
a 17-26 record). Bill Holbert managed on an interim basis for one game 
(a loss) and the season was closed out by Jimmy Macullar, who managed the 
final 26 games (5-21). The team had a combined batting average of .227.
