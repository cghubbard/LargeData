Home:Purple     , Gold      Hunter College High School is an American secondary 
school for intellectually gifted students located on Manhattan's Upper 
East Side in New York City, New York. It is administered by Hunter College, 
a senior college of the City University of New York, and by the New York 
City Department of Education. There is no tuition fee and it is publicly 
funded. According to the school, "students accepted to Hunter represent 
the top one-quarter of 1% of students in New York City, based on test scores."[1] 
Hunter is noted for sending a very large percentage of students to the 
Ivy League and other top-ranked colleges and universities. It is ranked 
as the top public high school in the United States by both The Wall Street 
Journal and Worth magazine.[2][3][4] The New York Times calls Hunter "the 
prestigious Upper East Side school known for its Ivy League-bound students" 
and "the fast track to law, medicine and academia."[5] The Washington Post 
calls Hunter "legendary."[6][7][8] Publicly available data indicate that 
Hunter has the highest average SAT score, the highest average ACT score 
and the highest percentage of National Merit Finalists of any school in 
the nation, public or private.[9][10] Hunter was established in 1869 as 
The Female Normal and High School, a private school to prepare young women 
to become teachers. The original school was composed of an elementary and 
a high school. A kindergarten was added in 1887, and in 1888 the school 
was incorporated into a college. The high school was separated from what 
would become Hunter College in 1903. In 1914, both schools were named after 
the Female Normal School's first president, Dr. Thomas Hunter.[11] It was 
almost closed by Hunter College President Jacqueline Wexler in the early 
1970s. Hunter was an all-girls school for the first 78 years of its existence, 
with the official name Hunter College High School for Intellectually Gifted 
Young Ladies. The prototypical Hunter girl was the subject of a song entitled 
"Sarah Maria Jones," who, the lyrics told, had "Hunter in her bones." In 
1878, Harper's Magazine published an approving article about the then-new 
school: The school became co-ed in 1974 as a result of a lawsuit by Hunter 
College Elementary School parents, a development which was described by 
the New York Daily News with the headline "Girlie High Gets 1st Freshboys." 
In January 1982, the school was featured in a New York Magazine article 
entitled "The Joyful Elite."[12] Hunter was the subject of the 1992 book 
Hunter College Campus Schools for the Gifted: The Challenge of Equity and 
Excellence published by Teachers' College Press.[13] The high school has 
occupied a number of buildings throughout its history, including one at 
the East 68th Street campus of the College (1940–1970). For several years 
in the 1970s, it was housed on the 13th and 14th floors of an office building 
at 466 Lexington Avenue (at East 46th Street). Since 1977, it has existed 
in a building designed to resemble the armory which previously existed 
on the site at East 94th Street between Park and Madison Avenues on the 
Upper East Side. Formerly, this was the site of the 94th Street Armory; 
today, part of the armory's facade (including two large towers) stretches 
for the entire block of Madison Avenue in front of the school. The greater 
part of the armory building has been demolished. Because of its design, 
including narrow windows, Hunter is affectionately called "The Brick Prison."[14][15][16][unreliable 
source?] The building contains both the high school (grades 7 - 12) and 
the elementary school (K - 6), which are collectively known as the Hunter 
College Campus Schools. Dr. Tony Fisher is the principal of the high school. 
Dean Ketchum is the principal of the elementary school and is the Director 
of the Campus Schools. Sonya Mosco is the deputy director of the Campus 
Schools. Admission to the high school is only granted in seventh grade, 
and is a two-step procedure. Students from the five boroughs of New York 
City with strong scores on standardized tests are eligible to take the 
Hunter College High School Entrance Exam in the January of their sixth 
grade school year. Eligible students must first meet Hunter's standards 
in reading and mathematics proficiency on fifth grade standardized exams, 
namely public school students must score at the 90th percentile (statewide) 
or above on both the New York State reading test and math tests, and private 
and parochial school students must score in the 90th percentile (of all 
of the private school students in the country) or above on both the reading 
and math tests administered by their schools.[17] Note that this results 
in an eligible pool of much less than 10% of New York City fifth graders 
for two reasons. The first is that much fewer than 10% of New York City 
public school students score above the statewide 90th percentile on either 
test. The second reason is that a student must score in the top 10% on 
both reading and math tests (so for example, a student scoring in the 99% 
percentile in math and the 89% percentile in reading will not be eligible 
to sit for the test, even though his overall score is in the 95th percentile). 
Thus, of about 65,000 fifth-graders in New York City, only 2,500 will be 
eligible to take the test. Most of those, between 2,000 and 2,300, do sit 
for the test and of those, between 182 and 185 are offered admission. Thus, 
"students accepted to Hunter represent the top one-quarter of 1% of students 
in New York City, based on test scores."[1] For example, in 2015, 182 (8.8%) 
of 2064 test takers were offered admission.[18] Approximately 45 students 
from Hunter College Elementary School also enter the 7th grade class each 
year.[1] Beginning with incoming students in the 2010–2011 school year, 
elementary school students must make 'satisfactory progress' by fifth grade 
in order to gain admission to the high school.[19] Prior to this, students 
at Hunter College Elementary School were guaranteed admission into the 
high school. In total, an entering 7th grade class contains approximately 
225 students, known as "Hunterites," about 200 of whom end up graduating 
from the school. Those who leave go to other magnet schools, private schools, 
local public schools or leave the city. Some of those who leave are expelled, 
usually for low grades. The total enrollment from grades 7 through 12 is 
approximately 1,200 students.[1] Author and alumnus Chris Hayes in "Twilight 
of the Elites: America After Meritocracy" highlights the ways in which 
the school's sole reliance on the one test for admissions reproduces societal 
inequalities. Namely, students whose families cannot afford intensive test 
prep courses are less likely to earn competitive scores on the entrance 
exam. As a result, in recent years, the number of African-American students 
admitted to the school has been increasingly non-proportionate to their 
presence in the public school system. Hayes quotes Hunter College High 
School's 2010 graduate Justin Hudson's commencement speech: "If you truly 
believe that the demographics of Hunter represent the distribution of intelligence 
in this city then you must believe that the Upper West Side, Bayside and 
Flushing are intrinsically more intelligent than the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant 
and Washington Heights, and I refuse to accept that." [20] In light of 
Hunter's academic excellence, The Wall Street Journal ranked it as the 
top public school in the nation and noted that it is a feeder to Ivy League 
and other elite colleges.[2][21] Worth magazine likewise ranked Hunter 
as the top public school in the country.[4] The New York Times calls Hunter 
"the prestigious Upper East Side school known for its Ivy League-bound 
students" and "the fast track to law, medicine and academia."[5] The Washington 
Post calls Hunter "legendary."[6][7][8] Publicly available data indicate 
that Hunter has both the highest average SAT score and the highest average 
ACT score of any school in the nation, public or private, though complete 
data is needed to be conclusive.[1][22] Hunter offers "a wealth of opportunities 
for brilliant kids" according to the New York Post.[23] All Hunter students 
pursue a six-year program of study. The curriculum is a college preparatory 
program that provides a liberal arts education. The majority of subjects 
are accelerated such that high school study begins in the 8th grade and 
state educational requirements are completed in the 11th. During the 12th 
grade, students take electives, have the option to attend courses at Hunter 
College (for transferable credit), undertake independent academic studies, 
and participate in internships around the city. Students in grades 7 and 
8 are required to take courses in communications and theater (a curriculum 
that includes drama, storytelling, and theater). Students in grades 7–9 
must take both art and music, each for half a year, and then choose one 
to take in tenth grade. One of the four available foreign language courses 
(French, Latin, Chinese, or Spanish) must be taken each year in grades 
7–10, and AP language electives are offered through the 12th grade. A year 
each of biology, chemistry, and physics must be completed in addition to 
the introductory science classes of life science and physical science in 
the 7th and 8th grades, respectively. During 7th and 8th grades, students 
must also participate in the school's science fair; the fair is optional 
for older students. After the introductory 7th grade social studies course, 
5 semesters (spanning two and a half years) of global studies must be completed, 
then 3 semesters of American history. A series of English and mathematics 
courses are taught from 7th through 11th grades. (The math curriculum is 
split into a track of "honors" and a track of "extended honors" classes 
for students of different strengths after 7th grade). If students pass 
a placement test, they are able to skip a grade and attend classes of a 
higher grade (for example, a student who passes the test in 7th grade and 
is currently in 8th grade can take 9th grade "extended honors" mathematics.) 
Two semesters of physical education are taught each year, including swimming 
in the 8th grade (held at Hunter College). In 9th grade, students are required 
to take a CPR course for one semester. Starting in their junior year, students 
are allowed to take a limited number of electives and Advanced Placement 
courses. The senior year, however, is free of mandated courses except for 
a year of physical education electives and courses to fulfill leftover 
educational requirements. Hunter's English Department incorporates reading 
dense novels and writing analytical papers beginning in the 7th grade. 
Students have historically graduated with strong writing and reading comprehension 
skills, reflected by the school's high average SAT scores in Critical Reading 
and Writing, and by the number of students who have earned recognition 
by the Scholastic Writing Awards.[citation needed] Upper-level electives 
and advanced placement courses are offered by all six academic departments. 
Advanced placement courses include: AP Computer Science, AP Calculus AB 
and BC, AP Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, AP Psychology, AP European 
History, AP Chemistry, AP Physics C, AP Biology, AP Statistics, AP Spanish, 
AP French and AP Latin (Virgil). The English Department previously offered 
AP English and Literature but has since replaced it with the elective Advanced 
Essay Writing. Other electives include: Intro to African-American Studies, 
"Race, Class, and Gender", International Relations, US Constitutional Law, 
Classical Mythology, Photography, Astrophysics, Advanced Art History I 
& II, Organic Chemistry, Creative Writing, Joyce's Ulysses, Shakespeare's 
Comedies & Romance/Shakespeare's Tragedies & Histories, and Physiology. 
Hunter's AP offerings are currently being evaluated by the Faculty and 
Curriculum Committee. The class of 2013 took 366 AP tests (~1.8 per student) 
with an average score of 4.5.[24] There were 87 faculty members in 2013. 
89% had advanced degrees. Many teachers are scientists, writers, artists, 
and musicians. A good number come to Hunter with university-level teaching 
experience. The student/faculty ratio is 13:1, much lower than the city's 
other selective public schools (e.g. Stuyvesant = 22:1). Nearly 99% of 
Hunter's classes of 2002 through 2005 went directly on to college, and 
about 25% of these students accepted admission into an Ivy League school.[2] 
Worth Magazine reported that 9.4% of Hunter's classes of 1998 through 2001 
attended Harvard, Yale or Princeton (the highest rate of any public school 
in the nation).[4] In 2006–2007, 73 of the graduating seniors were accepted 
into at least one Ivy League school, constituting approximately 40% of 
the whole class. In the graduating class of 2015, out of about 190 students, 
Hunter received 89 total acceptances from the Ivy League, and ultimately, 
56 students (~30%) matriculated into one of the eight Ivy League schools. 
There are six guidance counselors serving the student population. Each 
junior and senior is assigned a college guidance counselor. Hunter students 
win many honors and awards during their high school careers,[25] including 
numerous Scholastic Writing Awards. Hunter wins approximately 23% of all 
New York State Scholastic Art & Writing Awards. 74 members of the Class 
of 2013 (38%) were National Merit or National Achievement Scholarship Semifinalists.[1] 
Of particular fame are the winners of the Regeneron Science Talent Search 
(formerly Intel and Westinghouse STS)- the first-place winner in 2005 was 
Hunter senior David L. V. Bauer ('05), while the 1991 winner was Adam Cohen 
('97, now a professor in the Chemistry and Physics Departments at Harvard). 
In addition, two of New York State's four 2005 Presidential scholars were 
Hunter College High School seniors. Sandra Fong ('08) represented the United 
States in the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. She competed in the 
rifle shooting competition. Publicly available data indicate that Hunter 
has both the highest average SAT score and the highest average ACT score 
of any school in the nation, public or private, though complete data is 
needed to be conclusive. For the graduating class of 2012, the average 
SAT score was a 2207.[22] The class of 2013 averaged 2200[1] on the test 
and the class of 2016 averaged 2208. The class of 2013 scored an average 
of 32.6 on the ACT.[1] Hunter has an extremely large number and high quality 
of extra- and co-curricular offerings for a small school: 28 varsity teams, 
14 co-curricular organizations, 5 music groups, 4 theater groups, student 
government, 22 publications and approximately 60 clubs. Clubs cater to 
a very wide variety of interests, from politics to film and music to knitting. 
Clubs and organizations at Hunter are all student-run, with faculty members 
as advisers. During club open house members of the student body have the 
opportunity to spend their lunch time meeting representatives of clubs 
and can sign up for them.[1] The General Organization (G.O.) represents 
the student body. The executive board is made up of tenth through twelfth 
graders, elected by the student body, and comprises six members: president, 
administrative vice president, activities vice president, treasurer, publicity 
secretary, and recording secretary. These officers organize school activities 
and communicate with the administration and faculty, frequently becoming 
involved in school policy. The G.O. organizes school-wide events such as 
Spirit Day, a school-wide outdoor recreation day usually held in October, 
and Carnival, held at the end of the school year. Term Councils are grade 
governing bodies. They elect two senators for each grade to represent their 
ideas to the General Organization. They plan grade-wide events such as 
dances and fundraisers, as well as the Semiformal and Prom. Students can 
choose to further pursue their academic interests through school activities 
such as the National Economics Challenge, Hunter United Nations Society 
(HUNS), Fed Challenge (economics), Mock Trial, Debate Team, Math Team, 
the Hunter Chess and Go Teams, Quiz Bowl, Science Bowl, History Bowl, First 
Robotics, and the Washington Seminar. The Economics Challenge (run by the 
Council for Economic Education) team was formed in 2013 by two juniors 
and one sophomore, who subsequently led the Hunter team to become National 
Champions of the David Ricardo division in their inaugural year. The Hunter 
Chess Team is famous nationwide for winning numerous tournaments and championships. 
The Washington Seminar on Government in Action was introduced in the 1950s; 
students selected for this program research public policy issues throughout 
the year. They arrange meetings with various public figures in Washington, 
D.C., and then meet with them for questioning and discussion regarding 
their researched issue during a three-day trip in May. The Mock Trial team 
was the top team from New York City in 2015. The debate team is completely 
student run and yet is still nationally recognized and attends various 
tournaments throughout the year including tournaments at prestigious universities 
such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton. The Middle School debate team is a 
top-ranked team, that among other accomplishments took the top three spots 
at the Middle School Public Debate Program (MSPDP)'s National Invitational 
Tournament at Claremont McKenna College in 2013.[26] Hunter's Quiz Bowl 
team was started in 2006, does similarly well, and was nationally ranked 
in its inaugural year. The Quiz Bowl team went on to gain the title of 
national champions at the 2012 PACE National Scholastics Competition and 
at the 2016 High School National Championship Tournament. The History Bowl 
team has also gained the title of national champions by taking part in 
the 2012 National History Bee and Bowl during its second year. The Robotics 
team, started in 2009, takes part in First Robotics Competition (FRC) and 
has since seen victory, winning the Chesapeake regional in 2012. The Science 
Bowl team has placed 4th and 9th at the National Science Bowl championships 
in 2011 and 2012. Students with substantial musical training can choose 
to enroll in the String Ensembles, Band, and/or Chorus groups. In 2002, 
the music groups toured in Spain, performing a number of collaborative 
pieces. They toured Greece in 2006 and Budapest in 2008. The string ensembles 
are divided into "Strings" and "Chamber Orchestra", the latter being a 
much more selective group. They have performed a number of both contemporary 
and traditional pieces. The band is a woodwind-brass-percussion ensemble, 
and their focus is mainly on contemporary music, though they sometimes 
branch off into classical pieces such as Mozart's Horn Concerto in E Flat. 
Chorus is divided into the concert choir and the chamber choir. The concert 
choir is a larger group than the chamber choir, and consists of members 
from the tenth to twelfth grades. There is also a selective jazz chorus, 
founded by former music teacher Campbell Austin, which focuses solely on 
jazz and pop. The Jazz Band performs arrangements of jazz music. Students 
may also audition for Junior Orchestra (grades 7–8, except in special cases) 
or Senior Orchestra (grades 9–12, except in special cases), which perform 
in the two semi-annual concerts at Hunter, the Winter Concert and the Spring 
Concert. The concerts for the Junior Orchestra and Senior Orchestra are 
divided into two distinct concerts, the "Middle School Concert" and the 
"Winter (or Spring) concert", respectively. Hunter's sports teams are extremely 
competitive given the school's size; several, including both Girls' and 
Boys' Volleyball, Swimming, Fencing, Golf, Tennis, and Lacrosse are usually 
among the top 10 in the city. The number of varsity teams- 31 -that compete 
in the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) is also exceptional number 
given the school's size.[27][28] These sports are cross-country (boys' 
and girls' varsity), soccer (boys' varsity, junior varsity and middle school 
and girls' varsity and middle school), swimming (boys' and girls' varsity 
and co-ed middle school), volleyball (boys' varsity and girls' varsity, 
junior varsity and middle school), golf (coed and girls' varsity), basketball 
(boys have two middle school teams, one junior varsity team, and one varsity 
team, while the girls' have one middle school and one varsity team), indoor 
track (boys' and girls' varsity, middle school, and recently it was extended 
to the elementary school as well), outdoor track (boys' and girls' varsity, 
middle school and elementary), baseball (boys' middle school and varsity), 
softball (girls' middle school and varsity), lacrosse (boys' and girls' 
varsity and junior varsity), tennis (boys' and girls' varsity), ultimate 
(boys' and girls' varsity), bowling (boys' varsity), fencing (boys' and 
girls' varsity), badminton (boys' and girls' varsity), handball (coed varsity) 
and wrestling (boys' and girls' varsity and co-ed middle school). Many 
teams are called "Hunter Hawks" because the school mascot is a hawk.[29] 
Some exceptions, however, are the boys' volleyball team (Hunter Hitmen), 
the girls' volleyball team (Headhunters), the girls' swim team (Hunter 
Duckies), and the Ultimate Frisbee teams (Hunter Halcyons). In the 1983–84 
school year, the Hunter Heat, Hunter's bowling team, finished as the top 
team in Manhattan, Staten Island, and the Bronx, losing to Cordozo High 
School (number one team in Queens and Brooklyn) in the PSAL city championship. 
Benjamin Sobel ('12) bowled for Ohio State University after great success 
in the high school level, both in PSAL and nationally.[30] In 1984 the 
boys' cross country team, in its second year in existence, defeated George 
Washington High School for the Manhattan Championship. The boys' X-C team 
upset a George Washington squad that had not lost the Manhattan X-C championship 
in twelve years. In 1988 and 1995, the boys' volleyball team won the New 
York City PSAL title. In more recent years, a few teams have made runs 
at the city championship. During the 1998–2001 era, an unusual concentration 
of athletic talent led the basketball team deep into the PSAL playoffs 
for 3 consecutive seasons. In 2005, the boys' volleyball team finished 
4th in the city, the girls' soccer team reached the playoff semifinals, 
and co-ed fencing finished 3rd in the city. In 2008 the girls middle school 
soccer team were undefeated in the entire season and won the league. In 
the winter of 2005, co-ed fencing captured the city title. This was quickly 
followed, on November 22, 2005, with the Hunter Girls Varsity Volleyball 
team's defeat of JFK High School to become the New York City Champions. 
Boys' and girls' swimming were also successful in 2005. The boys' swimming 
team defeated its rival, Bronx Science, breaking a 15-year dry spell against 
the school. The girls had the first ever tie in PSAL Playoff history against 
Brooklyn Technical High School (47–47). The win was later awarded to Hunter. 
In 2009 Hunter's girls swim team beat rival school Bronx Science for the 
first time in nine years by six points. During the 2005–2006 school year, 
the girls' volleyball team won the PSAL city championship after many years 
of falling short of the championship, losing in the semifinals and finals. 
The girls' and boys' tennis teams also did well in the 2006 season, with 
the girls' team ranked 4th in the city, and the boys' team ranked 7th. 
In 2008, the tennis team reached the A division finals but lost to top-seeded 
Beacon. In the winter of 2006 the boys' fencing team won the PSAL city 
championship for the second year in a row, beating rival school Stuyvesant 
in the finals. It has since captured the silver medal in winter 2008, losing 
to Stuyvesant in the final, and the bronze medal in winter 09, again losing 
to Stuyvesant, after beating them twice during an undefeated regular season 
to win the division championship. It proceeded win the city championship 
again in 2011, followed by bronze in 2012, and silver in 2013. Following 
another undefeated season, the team took first place in 2014, winning in 
a single-touch tie-breaker against rival Brooklyn Technical High School.[31] 
In the 2009-2014 seasons, the Girls' Varsity Fencing Team won five consecutive 
PSAL championships.[32] Hunter's varsity baseball and basketball teams 
were relegated to the B Division at the beginning of the 2006–07 school 
year, and reacted well to these changes. Both teams made deep playoff runs, 
with basketball losing in the second round, and baseball upsetting the 
second seeded team and losing in the quarterfinals. In the spring of 2008, 
the baseball team lost in the second round of the playoffs to eventual 
finalist and top-seeded Bayard Rustin. In the 2008–2009 school year, the 
varsity basketball team rejoined the A division and achieved an impressive 
undefeated record. At the beginning of the 2007–08 school year, Hunter's 
boys varsity soccer team also moved to the B Division of the PSAL, and 
finished the season with a 7–1 record, culminating in a heartbreaking playoff 
loss. In 2010, Hunter's boys varsity soccer team, under the lead of returning 
Coach Asumana Randolph, defied all odds by winning their division, and 
winning the first round of playoffs in overtime, a game which in past seasons 
has been the last. They went on to win the quarter finals, playing the 
defending champion, Queens Vocational, and also to win semi-finals. Hunter 
continued their streak to the championship, where they played Monroe Campus 
and won in a shut out; 3–0, becoming the first Hunter Boys' soccer team 
to win the PSAL championship. A rough game, the championship was won at 
the cost of broken leg of Captain Emmett Kim, who was injured while scoring 
a goal. Standout Julian Ricardo also was injured, tearing his ACL, but 
continued to play on. Coach Asumana Randolph, ecstatic about the magnificent 
season, promised the team an African dinner; motivation which helped them 
push through each playoff round. In 2011, both the Boys' and Girls' varsity 
lacrosse teams won the PSAL Bowl Division Championships. In 2013 Boys' 
Lacrosse won the City Championship against Tottenville.[33] That season, 
prior to winning the City Championship, they were ranked third overall 
among all city schools, both public and private (after first-ranked Dalton 
and second-ranked Tottenville).[34] In the 2012 season, the Boys' Middle 
School Soccer Team were the Citywide PSAL Champions winning the finals 
against Salk.[35] The Athletic Association (AA) is an organization of varsity 
athletes that promotes school spirit and the interests of student athletes. 
The AA organizes intramural tournaments, sells Hunter apparel, and promotes 
sporting events. The AA coordinates and executes Sports Banquet and the 
annual Junior-Senior football games during Spirit Day as well. Hunter has 
many student publications, including What's What, the official school newspaper 
since 1922, and its rival independent paper, The Observer. Weekly circulations 
include "What's G.O.ing On", a joint presentation of the G.O. and What's 
What. The Eclectic is Hunter's fully online student publication. Student-produced 
magazines include Argus (poetry and prose), The Hunter Economist (political 
and economic commentary), Chapter 11 (satire), Tapestry (science fiction 
and fantasy), Radicals (math), The Desk (literary magazine for lower-termers), 
Annals (the school's yearbook), The Idealist (social justice), The Leading 
Strand (science), F-Stop (photography), Hunter Political Magazine, E magazine 
(popular culture and fashion magazine), Rewind Magazine (movies and media), 
Playback (music magazine), "Storyboard" (graphic stories), "Artillery" 
(student art), T.H.A.T. Theatre Review (theater), "Food For Thought" (recipes, 
restaurant reviews, and food-interest stories), and Polyglot (foreign language 
literature). The Hunter theater program is an active one, often with a 
season of four main-stage productions and many other showcase productions. 
In a season of four main-stage productions, they normally fall into these 
categories: a Shakespeare play; a Musical (Musical Repertoire, often referred 
to as REP); Hunter Classics, for students in grades 7 through 9; and the 
Brick Prison Playhouse, showcasing several student-written plays. There 
are likewise two Theater Production Practicum (TPP) showcases, with student-directed 
one-act plays (through the class TPP), as well as a 7th grade play festival. 
Many cultural clubs also produce performances highlighting their culture. 
Students at Hunter often enjoy various social events that are sponsored 
by the school administration, faculty and the student-run General Organization. 
These include: Several formal dances are arranged throughout the year: 
Several classes and extracurricular groups hold annual trips outside of 
New York City. International trips include the bi-annual AP Art History 
trip, the Shakespeare Etc. club trip, and trips taken by various school-run 
musical groups (such as Jazz Band or Chorus). Notable alumni include:[36] 
Hunter is an open campus, allowing students to go outside during lunch 
and free periods. Coordinates: 40°47′8.92″N 73°57′14.04″W﻿ / ﻿40.7858111°N
