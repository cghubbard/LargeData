Leslie M. O'Connor (August 31, 1889 – January 20, 1966)[1] was an American 
lawyer and professional baseball executive. He was the assistant to the 
Commissioner of Baseball from January 1921 until the death of Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis on November 25, 1944; then he filled the void as 
acting commissioner (technically, as chairman of the Major League Advisory 
Council) until the election of Happy Chandler as Landis' successor on April 
24, 1945. After spending another six months in the commissioner's office 
as Chandler's top assistant, O'Connor became general manager of the Chicago 
White Sox of Major League Baseball from November 1945[2] through November 
1948, and he later served as president of the Pacific Coast League.[3] 
Born in Chicago, Illinois, O'Connor was admitted to the bar and served 
in World War I as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps.[1] When 
Landis was appointed Commissioner in the wake of the 1919 Black Sox Scandal, 
O'Connor became his top administrator for 24 seasons until Landis' sudden 
death in 1944. As Landis' right-hand man, he was involved in investigations, 
writing Landis' decisions and keeping records.[1] After five months as 
acting commissioner—as head of the three-man council that included league 
presidents Ford Frick and Will Harridge—during the waning months of World 
War II, O'Connor stepped aside for Chandler and was his top aide during 
the transition until after the 1945 baseball season.[4] He then was named 
general manager of the White Sox by team owner Grace Comiskey and held 
that post for three losing campaigns. After the White Sox lost 101 games 
and finished last in the eight-team American League in 1948, O'Connor stepped 
down and was succeeded by Frank Lane. He remained in baseball, however, 
as a member of the Major-Minor League Executive Council, and then as legal 
counsel for and president of the top-level Pacific Coast League. As PCL 
president from 1956 through 1959, he was in office during the tumultuous 
shift of the Dodgers and Giants from New York City to Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, which resulted in a significant alteration of the PCL map.[3]
