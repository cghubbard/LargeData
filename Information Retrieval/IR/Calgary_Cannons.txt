The Calgary Cannons were a minor league baseball team located in Calgary, 
Alberta, Canada for 18 seasons, from 1985 until 2002. They were a member 
of the AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) and played at Foothills Stadium. 
The Cannons displaced the Calgary Expos, who played in the rookie level 
Pioneer League from 1977 until 1984. The team was previously known as the 
Salt Lake City Gulls before being relocated to Calgary. Following the 2002 
season, the team moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and are now known as 
the Isotopes. The Cannons played 2,538 regular season games in Calgary, 
compiling a record of 1,225–1,308. They qualified for the playoffs five 
times: 1985, 1987, 1989, and 1991 as an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners, 
and 1998 as an affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. They reached the PCL 
Championship Series three times, in 1987, 1991, and 1998, though they never 
won a title. More than 400 Major League players wore a Cannons jersey, 
including Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martínez, Danny Tartabull and Jim Abbott. 
Of those, 11 remain active in the majors as of 2011. Two players pitched 
no hitters with the Cannons: Frank Wills in 1985, and Erik Hanson in 1988. 
In 1985, Tartabull led all professional baseball players with 43 home runs. 
Russ Parker had operated a rookie-level Pioneer League team, the Calgary 
Expos, since 1977. In 1983, the opportunity to move up to AAA presented 
itself when the Salt Lake City Gulls were put up for sale. In December 
1983, Parker purchased an option to buy the Gulls with the intention of 
moving the team to Calgary for the 1985 season. The Pacific Coast League 
approved the sale in May 1984, and reconstruction of Foothills Stadium 
began.[1] More than 500 names were submitted in a name the team contest. 
Five finalists were selected: Stallions, Outlaws, Stetsons, Chinooks and 
Cannons. The Cannons name was selected by a panel of local media representatives. 
The name was unique, as at the time, no professional or collegiate team 
in North America used the name.[2] The Cannons began play in 1985 as the 
AAA affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. Their first game was played April 
11, 1985 against the Phoenix Giants. The Cannons won 6–2, led by Danny 
Tartabull's home run, the first in Cannons history.[3] Following a 6–2 
opening road-trip, Calgary's home opener was scheduled for April 19. It 
was snowed out, however, as were attempts to play the following two days.[4] 
On their fourth attempt, the Cannons finally played their first home game 
on April 22 against the Tucson Toros. Parker threw the ceremonial first 
pitch out to Calgary's mayor, Ralph Klein.[5] Led by Mickey Brantley's 
four-hit game, the Cannons won 7–6 to send the crowd of 4,313 who braved 
the near-freezing temperatures home happy.[6] The Cannons were a success 
at the gate, drawing 272,322 fans in 63 openings.[7] The season was also 
a success on the field. The Cannons won the first half pennant in the North 
Division with a 37–32 record, earning a trip to the playoffs.[8] The Cannons 
entered their North Division playoff series against the Vancouver Canadians 
without Tartabull, however, as he was recalled by the Mariners before the 
first game of the series.[7] Tartabull's loss was significant, as he led 
all of professional baseball with 43 home runs.[9] Calgary lost their best 
of five series to Vancouver in three games.[10] The first no-hitter by 
a Cannons pitcher was hurled by Frank Wills on May 31, 1985 against the 
Tacoma Tigers in a seven-inning game.[11] Three years later, Erik Hanson 
pitched the second no-hitter in Cannons history on August 21, 1988, posting 
a 5–0 victory over the Las Vegas Stars. Hanson walked only one batter in 
the seven-inning game.[12] Calgary again made the playoffs in 1987, finishing 
atop the North Division second half standings with a record of 46–25. The 
Cannons' overall record of 84–57 would ultimately stand as the best record 
the team compiled in Calgary.[8] The Cannons lost the first two games of 
the Northern Division Championship Series against the Tacoma Tigers on 
the road before returning to Calgary to sweep the final three games of 
the series. Parker described the game five victory as "the biggest moment 
in Calgary baseball history."[13] The Cannons faced the Albuquerque Dukes 
in the Pacific Coast League Championship Series. After splitting the first 
two games in Calgary,[14] the Cannons dropped the next two in Albuquerque 
as the Dukes won their fourth PCL championship in ten years.[15] The Cannons 
made their third playoff appearance in five years in 1989 by winning the 
second-half pennant with a record of 42–29. The record represented a worst-to-first 
result for Calgary, as the club finished last in the PCL North in the first 
half with a 28–43 record.[8] The Guns faced the Vancouver Canadians in 
a rematch of the 1985 North Division Final. As in 1985, Vancouver swept 
Calgary in three games.[16] 1991 marked the fourth playoff appearance for 
the Cannons, who posted a 45–24 record in the second half.[8] The Cannons 
swept the Portland Beavers in three games to claim the second Northern 
Division pennant in franchise history. They also won their first playoff 
road-games in team history in setting up a championship clash with the 
Tucson Toros.[17] Calgary won the first two games of the best-of-five series 
at home over Tucson, giving them three chances to win the title.[18] The 
Cannons, however, dropped the final three games in Tucson, losing the title 
in the process.[19] In the fifth game, the Cannons were forced to start 
Dennis Powell on two days rest after the Mariners unexpectedly recalled 
intended starter Dave Fleming prior to the game. The move left Russ Parker 
"upset" and "dumbfounded".[20] The relationship between the Mariners and 
Cannons was never the same.[21] In 1993, Calgary's Foothills Stadium was 
identified by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues 
as one of several minor league facilities requiring renovations to meet 
new standards. The Cannons were given a deadline of April 1, 1995 to complete 
renovations, or the team would be forced to relocate.[22] The Cannons and 
the City of Calgary engaged in a protracted battle over who would pay for 
the renovations. Renovations finally began in the fall of 1994 and were 
completed on time.[23] The 1994 season saw the brief appearance of Alex 
Rodriguez in a Cannons uniform. The first-overall draft pick of the Mariners 
in 1993, Rodriguez vaulted through the Mariners organization in 1994, starting 
with the Appleton Foxes in Class A, then the AA Jacksonville Suns. Rodriguez 
was then promoted to the Mariners, playing 17 major league games before 
being optioned to Calgary to complete the season.[24] Following the 1994 
season, the Cannons and Mariners parted ways, as Seattle moved its AAA 
team to nearby Tacoma. The Cannons signed an affiliation agreement with 
the Pittsburgh Pirates,[23] which lasted for three seasons. In 1998, the 
Cannons became the AAA affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. The 1998 Cannons 
qualified for the playoffs for the first time in seven seasons, doing so 
in dramatic fashion. Calgary clinched its third North Division pennant 
on September 3, 1998, defeating the Canadians 4–3 when Kevin Roberson hit 
a pinch-hit, two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning. The victory 
was the Cannons' 11th straight, and occurred before a crowd of 8,976, both 
franchise records.[25] In the playoffs, the Cannons defeated the Fresno 
Grizzlies in five games to win the Pacific Conference championship, earning 
their third trip to the PCL Championship Series in team history.[26] After 
dropping the first game of the final at home to the New Orleans Zephyrs, 
Calgary rebounded with 12–8 and 5–2 wins, the latter in New Orleans, to 
move within one game of winning the title.[27] However, as in 1991, the 
Cannons were unable to clinch the title, falling 8–1 and 4–3 in New Orleans 
as the Zephyrs won the title.[28] After the season, the Cannons switched 
major league teams for a final time, and became the Florida Marlins affiliate 
for the final four years in Calgary. Citing six years of financial losses, 
Parker signed a letter of intent to sell the Cannons to a group from Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, in January 2001.[29] It was not the first time Parker had considered 
such a sale. He backed out of a similar sale to a Portland, Oregon– based 
group at the last minute in 1999.[30] The sale, which would see the team 
play in Calgary in 2001, then relocate to Albuquerque for the 2002 season, 
was contingent on voters in New Mexico supporting a referendum to pay for 
a new ballpark.[31] Parker argued that the Cannons no longer made economic 
sense in Calgary. Foothills Stadium was badly outdated. The Canadian dollar 
was at record lows against the American dollar, placing the team at a disadvantage 
in a league that was American-based. Poor weather was also blamed, especially 
early in the season, leading to lower attendance.[32] The new ballpark 
in Albuquerque was approved; however, construction delays pushed the relocation 
of the team back a year. The Cannons 18th, and final, season took place 
in 2002. The Cannons' final game was played on September 2, 2002, against 
the Edmonton Trappers. It ended in a wild 14–13 victory over Calgary's 
provincial rival before a sellout crowd of 8,512. The Cannons scored four 
runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the game, with the winning 
run scored on a strikeout/wild pitch. The team left the field to the song 
Happy Trails while the cannon in right field that had been fired every 
time a Calgary player hit a home run fired off a 21-gun salute.[33] The 
team began play as the Albuquerque Isotopes in 2003, named after a Simpsons 
episode where Homer Simpson attempted to prevent the Springfield Isotopes 
from relocating to Albuquerque.[34] In Calgary, two new teams began play 
at Foothills Stadium. The Calgary Outlaws of the independent Canadian Baseball 
League lasted only a half-season before the entire league folded. The Calgary 
Dawgs of the Western Major Baseball League operated as a college summer 
league team. The Calgary Vipers of the independent North American League 
was the most recent team to represent Calgary, but folded at the end of 
the 2011 season. Note: the PCL abandoned the split-season format beginning 
in the 1998 season as the league expanded to 16 teams following the dissolution 
of the American Association. Over 400 Cannons players also played in the 
Major Leagues.[35] Of them, the following players played at least parts 
of ten or more seasons at the Major League level or remain active as of 
the 2011 season. Eleven former Cannons remain active in the Majors. The 
status of Foothills Stadium, formerly known as Burns Stadium, was a consistent 
story throughout the Cannons history. The ballpark's owner, the City of 
Calgary, risked scuttling the move of the Gulls to Calgary by choosing 
to reassess the feasibility of AAA baseball in Calgary in 1984. Council 
ultimately voted to support Parker, agreeing to a seven-year lease and 
$1.5 million to renovate Foothills, one of the PCL's conditions on approving 
the relocation.[36] In the Cannons early years, Foothills was regarded 
as a park with good atmosphere. Mel Kowalchuck of the Edmonton Trappers 
described the park in 1988: "They provide a good atmosphere at the park. 
Seating's good, and so is the field. The lighting, concessions, parking 
... everything's good."[37] Renovations to Foothills again became a major 
issue in 1993, when the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues 
demanded that the Cannons upgrade Foothills to AAA standards.[38] The Cannons 
and the city fought a protracted battle to see who would pay the majority 
of the $2 million renovation costs. The debate also included the Alberta 
government.[39] Parker argued that if council did not choose to pay the 
majority of the renovation costs that he would sell or relocate the team. 
Groups representing Portland, Oregon, Fresno and Sacramento, California 
all expressed interest in the team.[38] Unable to reach an agreement with 
the city, the Cannons then turned to the federal government in March 1994, 
making a pitch for a federal infrastructure grant to help pay for renovations.[22] 
Renovations to Foothills Stadium finally began following the 1994 season.[23] 
As other teams built new ballparks throughout the 1990s, Foothills' lack 
of luxury boxes, small clubhouses and open concourse became a growing concern 
for Parker. By 1998, he was arguing the need for a new stadium, or a major 
renovation of Foothills at a cost of $20 million.[40] Despite numerous 
efforts to convince city council to help renovate Foothills, Parker was 
unable to secure support for the project. When the Cannons were sold and 
relocated in 2002, Foothills Stadium was regarded as one of the major reasons
