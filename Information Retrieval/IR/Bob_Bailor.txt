Robert Michael Bailor (born July 10, 1951) is a former Major League Baseball 
player best known for being the first player selected by the Toronto Blue 
Jays in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. Bailor was born 
in Connellsville, Pennsylvania, the fifth of Robert and Agnes Bailor's 
six children. His family name was Bialkowski when they first arrived in 
the United States of America from Poland. Robert was an engineer for the 
Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, hauling coal, iron ore and limestone, and Agnes 
was a stay-at-home mom. In August 1963, Connellsville won the Pennsylvania 
state Little League title. He did not play high school ball, as neither 
Connellsville High School nor Geibel Catholic High School (the school he 
attended) had a baseball team. He did, however, play basketball in high 
school, and set the team record for most points in a game. Bailor played 
baseball with the Connellsville American Legion team. Among his teammates 
were future Seattle Mariners pitcher Bob Galasso and first baseman Jim 
Braxton, who went on to have an eight-year career in the National Football 
League with the Buffalo Bills. It was through the American Legion that 
Bailor caught the eye of Baltimore Orioles scout Jocko Collins.[1] Bailor 
signed with the Orioles upon graduation from Geibel Catholic in 1969. He 
was immediately a utility player, playing the outfield, second base, third 
base, shortstop and even pitching for one game in his first professional 
season with the Bluefield Orioles. In 1971 with the Aberdeen Pheasants, 
Bailor led the Class A Northern League with a .340 batting average. In 
1972, he led the Class A California League with 63 stolen bases. Eventually, 
he began playing more and more shortstop by the time he debuted with the 
Baltimore Orioles in September 1975. He started both games of a September 
28 doubleheader with the New York Yankees, one at short and the other at 
second, and collected his first major league hit off Larry Gura in the 
second game.[2] He returned to the triple A Rochester Red Wings in 1976, 
and again received a call up to the majors that September. In total, Bailor 
batted .288 with twelve home runs and 201 runs batted in over seven seasons 
in the Orioles' farm system. He was three-for-thirteen with no home runs 
or RBIs at the major league level. After the Seattle Mariners selected 
Ruppert Jones from the Kansas City Royals with the first overall pick in 
the expansion draft, the Toronto Blue Jays made Bailor the second overall 
pick.[3] Despite the fact that he did not have an everyday position, Bailor 
appeared in 122 games, and logged 523 plate appearances his rookie season 
in Toronto. He led the team in hits, (154) stolen bases (15), runs scored 
(62), and his .310 batting average set an expansion team record.[4] He 
had ten assists from the outfield in just 537 innings, and was named to 
the Topps Rookie All-Star team at shortstop despite the fact that he only 
appeared in 53 games at short. On April 20, the New York Yankees' Sparky 
Lyle struck Bailor out for the first time in his major league career.[5] 
Bailor had batted a record 51 times before striking out for the first time.[6] 
In 1978 & 1979, Bailor emerged as the Jays' regular right fielder, though 
he still played many different positions. In 1978, he drove in a career 
high 52 runs while striking out only 21 times in 621 at-bats. He was named 
the Blue Jays Player of the Year for the first two years of the franchise's 
existence.[7] Bailor's production declined in 1979, as he batted only .229 
with 1 HR and 38 RBI in 130 games, however, his fifteen assists from right 
field tied Dwight Evans for the most in the American League. In 1980, Bailor 
lost his job in right field to Lloyd Moseby, and was used as a fourth outfielder. 
He also appeared in three games as a relief pitcher, allowing two earned 
runs in 2.1 innings pitched. On December 12, the Blue Jays traded Bailor 
to the New York Mets for pitcher Roy Lee Jackson. Bailor spent a month 
on the disabled list with a rib cage injury, and was used sparingly his 
first season in New York City, appearing in 51 games and logging just 81 
at-bats.[8] He went into Spring training 1982 competing for either of the 
two middle infield positions,[9] and began the season competing with Wally 
Backman and Tom Veryzer for playing time at second base. With both Bailor 
and Backman batting over .300 at the end of May, Bailor began seeing more 
playing time at short and third. He ended the season with 404 plate appearances, 
his most since 1979. He also stole a career high 20 bases, and led the 
National League with an 87% stolen base percentage. He began the 1983 season 
as the Mets' starting shortstop, and hit the only home run of his Mets 
career on April 13 against the Philadelphia Phillies' Sid Monge.[10] A 
sore left rib cage muscle landed Bailor on the disabled list at the start 
of May, and opened the door for Jose Oquendo to take over at shortstop. 
When Bailor returned later in the month, he was used more as a back-up 
infielder. For the season, he appeared in 118 games, his highest total 
since 1979. On December 8, Bailor was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in a deal that was very unpopular with Mets fans at the time. He and pitcher 
Carlos Diaz were shipped to the Dodgers for Sid Fernandez and Ross Jones.[11] 
Bailor's first season in Los Angeles started late and ended early due to 
injuries. He dislocated his left shoulder during Spring training, causing 
him to miss the first month of the 1984 season. He then tore the cartilage 
in his right knee during batting practice on August 12 requiring arthroscopic 
surgery that pretty much ended his season.[12] He ended the season hitting 
.275 with 0 HR and 8 RBI in just 65 games. In 1985, Bailor hit .246 with 
0 HR and 7 RBI in 74 games with Los Angeles, helping the team reach the 
post-season. In the 1985 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, Bailor got 
into two games, going hitless in one at-bat, as the Dodgers lost to the 
Cardinals. On April 2, 1986, the Dodgers released Bailor. Bailor's .310 
batting average with the expansion Toronto Blue Jays broke Rusty Staub's 
record[clarification needed] set in 1969 with the Montreal Expos (.302). 
The two were teammates on the New York Mets from 1981 to 1983. Bailor wore 
number 4 with the Mets, Staub's number during his first tenure with the 
club (1972â€“1975). Though he proved to be one of the great utility players 
of his era, Bailor never liked the term. "It sounds like a guy who changes 
light bulbs."[13] Shortly after his release from the Dodgers, Bailor was 
offered a player-coach position with Toronto's triple A affiliate, the 
Syracuse Chiefs. He turned the position down in order to spend time with 
his newborn child, Robert Michael, Jr. A year later, he accepted a position 
with the organization managing the Florida State League's Dunedin Blue 
Jays.[14] Bailor later went on to manage Syracuse from 1988 to 1991, and 
was named International League Manager of the Year as he led the Chiefs 
to a first-place finish.[15] From 1992 until 1995, Bailor served as a coach
