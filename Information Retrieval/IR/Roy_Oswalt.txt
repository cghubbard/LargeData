Roy Edward Oswalt (/ˈoʊzwɑːlt/; born August 29, 1977) is an American former 
professional baseball pitcher who played for the majority of his career 
with the Houston Astros. He also played for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
the Texas Rangers, and the Colorado Rockies. Oswalt was selected by the 
Astros in the 1996 MLB draft. He made his major league debut with the club 
in 2001 and finished with a win–loss record of 14–3. He was back-to-back 
20-game winner in both 2004 and 2005. He helped the Astros to their first 
World Series appearance in 2005. He was named Most Valuable Player of the 
2005 National League Championship Series (NLCS). When he left the Astros 
in 2010 his wins (143) and strikeout total (1,593) was second in franchise 
history to Joe Niekro (144) and Nolan Ryan (1,866). He is a three-time 
All-Star, selected from 2005 to 2007. As of the 2012 season his career 
strikeout total was in the top 100 all-time. As a member of Team USA, Oswalt 
won a gold medal in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Oswalt was born and raised 
in Weir, Mississippi, the son of Billy Joe and Jean Oswalt. Billy was a 
Vietnam War veteran and logger. Roy grew up with his older brother, Brian, 
and their older sister, Patricia.[1] Jean was an avid baseball fan and 
taught her kids about the game.[2] Oswalt grew up rooting for the Atlanta 
Braves.[1] Oswalt joined the Weir High School football team as a quarterback 
and the baseball team as a pitcher. He could throw in the mid 80s with 
good control, but his relatively slight stature (5'10", 150 lbs.) scared 
away scouts.[2] Oswalt reflected, "I always heard that I was too small."[1] 
Weir itself was very small in size, making it difficult for scouts to hear 
about Oswalt. Nonetheless, he was recruited to join the baseball team at 
Holmes Community College.[2] Oswalt was spotted by only one major league 
scout, James Farrar of the Houston Astros. Convinced that Oswalt's anonymity 
kept him hidden from other teams, the Astros allowed him to drop into the 
23rd round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. By this point, Oswalt 
had drawn the attention of the Mississippi State Bulldogs, for whom he 
had long wanted play. The Astros enticed Oswalt with a $500,000 signing 
bonus,[2] and he signed with the club on May 18, 1997.[3] In 1997, Oswalt 
played rookie ball in the Gulf Coast League, where he gave up only two 
runs in five starts. He was then called up to the Auburn Doubledays of 
the New York–Penn League, where he went 2–4 the rest of the way.[2][4] 
He split 1998 between the same two teams. In 16 innings of work with the 
Gulf Coast Astros, he struck out 27 batters and walked just one. He was 
promoted again to Auburn, where he recorded the league's fourth-lowest[citation 
needed] ERA (2.18). In 1999, when Oswalt was with the Class A Michigan 
Battle Cats in the Midwest League, he suffered an apparently serious shoulder 
injury. After a month of pain in his upper shoulder, Oswalt was convinced 
that his shoulder was torn. Shortly thereafter, he was checking the spark 
plug wires on his pickup truck. He touched one of the spark plug wires, 
causing the truck's engine to start. The truck's electric current flowed 
through Oswalt's body, and consequently the muscles in his hand tightened 
on the spark plug wire. Unable to let go of it, Oswalt grasped the wire 
for almost one minute. Oswalt then claimed his foot slipped off the truck's 
bumper and he was finally "thrown off." After the electric shock, Oswalt 
told his wife that his shoulder's condition improved and that he no longer 
felt any pain. According to Sports Illustrated, he reported it thus to 
his wife: "My truck done shocked the fire out of me, and my arm don't hurt 
no more."[5] Apparently, the electric charge loosened accumulated scar 
tissue in the shoulder. Oswalt claims he has not felt any pain in his shoulder 
since the incident.[6] He finished 1999 with 143 strikeouts and a club-high 
13 wins. Oswalt began 2000 with the Class A Kissimmee Cobras of the Florida 
State League, going 4–3 with a 2.98 ERA before a player injury on Class 
AA Round Rock Express of the Texas League led to his promotion. Oswalt 
was only expected to pitch a few games and had been given a round-trip 
ticket. But after striking out 15 batters in his first start with the Express, 
manager Jackie Moore tore up his ticket. Nolan Ryan, owner of the Express 
and Oswalt's idol, admired his calm demeanor and his aggressiveness so 
much that he successfully lobbied to keep Oswalt on the roster, where he 
would go 11–4 with a 1.94 ERA, and recording 141 strikeouts over 19 games 
(18 starts). It was here that he met pitching coach Mike Maddux, who counseled 
the young Oswalt to be economical in his pitch selection by throwing more 
breaking balls and inducing groundouts early in the count. As a result 
of his success at Round Rock, Oswalt was selected to play on the U.S. Olympic 
baseball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In Olympic baseball competition, 
Oswalt pitched in the semi-finals against South Korea, a game that the 
U.S. won with a walk-off home run by Doug Mientkiewicz en route to their 
gold medal finish. Oswalt struck out ten and allowed two runs (1.38 ERA) 
in his two starts.[7] In 2001, Oswalt started the season with the Triple-A 
New Orleans Zephyrs, where he went 2–3 before being called up to the major 
leagues when left-hander Wayne Franklin was optioned down.[4] Oswalt finished 
his rookie campaign in 2001 with a 14–3 record and a 2.73 ERA, including 
a 12–2 mark with a 2.82 ERA in his 20 starts. He finished second in voting 
for National League Rookie of the Year, losing unanimously to Albert Pujols. 
He also placed fifth in Cy Young Award voting, which was won by Randy Johnson. 
He won the Sporting News NL Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award. He pitched 
24 consecutive scoreless innings before giving up a home run to Andrés 
Galarraga of the San Francisco Giants. The 2002 season was another step 
forward for Oswalt, who finished the season with a 19–9 record, striking 
out a career-high 208 batters and finishing with an ERA of 3.01. He tied 
with Éric Gagné for fourth in Cy Young voting, losing once again to Johnson.[8] 
From July 27 to September 8, he won a then-club record 9 straight starts 
before getting a no-decision in an extra innings' Astros loss to the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Injuries plagued Oswalt in 2003, but he still recorded 
a 10–5 record over 21 starts. He started a team no-hitter against the New 
York Yankees on June 11. Oswalt left after one inning, and 5 more Astros 
continued to no-hit the Yankees. He rebounded in 2004 with the first 20-win 
season of his career, the only National League (NL) pitcher to do so that 
year. He went 20–10 despite a career-high 3.49 ERA, and struck out 206 
batters. He finished third in Cy Young Award voting, behind his teammate 
Roger Clemens and, once again, Randy Johnson.[9] He also made his first 
postseason appearance, going 1–0 with a 4.19 ERA in three starts and one 
relief appearance. He threw two complete-game shutouts during the season, 
both against the Milwaukee Brewers. He led all NL starters with the fastest 
average fastball, at 94.0 miles per hour (151.3 km/h).[10] He won the Darryl 
Kile Award. In 2005, Oswalt threw a career-high 241 2⁄3 innings, striking 
out 184 batters and only walking 48 on the way to his second consecutive 
20-win season — the first Astro to do so since Joe Niekro in 1979–80. He 
notched a 20–12 record, including a career-best 10-game winning streak 
from April 10 to July 26, with a 2.94 ERA, and was named to his first Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game as the National League All-Star Final Vote 
winner. He was fourth in Cy Young Award balloting, won by Chris Carpenter. 
In the postseason that year, Oswalt started 4 games and went 3–0. His two 
seven inning one-run performances netted him the NLCS MVP award, including 
a three-hit seven strikeout game in Game 6. Oswalt went 15–8 in 2006 and 
was named to his second consecutive All-Star team and his final ERA led 
NL (2.94), and also struck out 166 batters while walking 38. On August 
29, 2006, Oswalt's 29th birthday, he signed a five-year extension with 
the Astros totaling $73 million with an option for a 6th year.[11] He again 
finished fourth in Cy Young Award voting, won by Brandon Webb. On September 
18, while pitching against the Cincinnati Reds, Oswalt recorded his 1,000th 
strikeout, becoming the eighth player in Astros history to reach the milestone. 
Before the 2007 season, Roy Oswalt received the second-highest Pitcher 
Player Value Ranking from Sports Illustrated Baseball Preview Edition. 
He was rated the best in the NL ahead of Brandon Webb and Chris Carpenter, 
and was only below the 2006 Triple Crown winner Johan Santana. On July 
5, 2007, it was announced Oswalt would replace an injured John Smoltz on 
the National League All-Star team, making it Oswalt's third consecutive 
All-Star game appearance. He did not pitch in the All-Star Game, however. 
On August 13, 2007, Sports Illustrated named Oswalt as one of the top five 
pitchers (along with Santana, Roy Halladay, Jake Peavy, and Justin Verlander).[12] 
On September 26, 2007, it was reported that Oswalt was suffering from pain 
in his left side and it was decided to shut him down for the remainder 
of the season so as not to risk a more serious injury.[13] He finished 
the 2007 season throwing 212 innings, his fourth consecutive year of 200 
or more innings pitched, a 14–7 record, an ERA of 3.18 and 154 strikeouts. 
Although he started off the 2008 season slowly (0–3, 9.00 ERA), a solid 
second half helped Oswalt reach his highest win total since 2005. Oswalt 
was able to accomplish this despite landing on the disabled list on July 
19 for the first time since 2006. He also set an Astros team record with 
32 1⁄3 scoreless innings.[14] He finished the 2008 season throwing 208 
2⁄3 innings, his fifth consecutive year of 200 or more innings pitched, 
a 17–10 record, an ERA of 3.54 and 165 strikeouts. Oswalt is one of 10 
major league pitchers who won at least 11 games in each year from 2004 
to 2008.[citation needed] In 2009, Oswalt played for the United States 
in the World Baseball Classic, appearing in two games. He was the winning 
pitcher in the contest versus the Netherlands, but was pulled from the 
semifinal against Japan in the fourth inning after giving up 6 runs. On 
July 29, Oswalt was dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies for J. A. Happ and 
two minor league players, center fielder Anthony Gose, and shortstop Jonathan 
Villar, playing for Class-A Advanced and Class-A, respectively.[15][16] 
On August 24, Oswalt became the first Phillies pitcher to field in a non-pitching 
position in 39 years. In a game against the Astros, Phillies' first baseman 
Ryan Howard was ejected after arguing a checked swing to end the top of 
the 15th inning. Out of offensive reserves, the Phillies moved left fielder 
Raúl Ibañez to first base and sent Oswalt to play left field. Oswalt acquired 
one putout in the outfield, but later hit into the final out of the Phillies 
loss by grounding out in the bottom of the 16th inning. The previous Phillies 
pitcher to play a position was Bill Wilson, who played third base for one-third 
of an inning on August 6, 1971.[17] On September 12, Oswalt pitched his 
first complete game as a Phillie in a 3–0 win against the New York Mets, 
allowing four hits and striking out six. In the 2010 NLDS, Oswalt pitched 
Game 2 of the Phillies' three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds; he gave 
up 4 runs in 5 innings, but the Phillies came back to win 7–4. In the 2010 
NLCS against the San Francisco Giants, Oswalt won Game 2 by allowing only 
1 run in 8 innings. Oswalt entered Game 4 in the bottom of the ninth inning, 
attempting to preserve a tie game, but took the loss. In Game 6, Oswalt 
allowed 2 runs in 6 innings but left with the game tied; the Giants later 
broke the tie to win that game and the series. Going into the 2011 season, 
the Phillies' top four pitchers (Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Oswalt, and Cole 
Hamels) were widely touted as constituting one of the best starting rotations 
in history.[18] After a strong start to the 2011 season, Oswalt took a 
leave of absence from the Phillies on April 27, 2011, citing "personal 
reasons", namely to check on his family and home after a series of devastating 
tornadoes in Mississippi.[19] He later spent several weeks on the disabled 
list due to a back injury. Overall, his season was considered to be disappointing, 
perhaps due to his back problems.[18] In the 2011 NLDS, Oswalt started 
Game 4 with the Phillies leading the St. Louis Cardinals 2 games to 1 and 
needing only one more win to advance. Oswalt allowed 5 runs in 6 innings 
and took the loss. The Phillies also lost Game 5 and were eliminated from 
the playoffs. After the 2011 season for the Phillies, the team declined 
his option, thus making him a free agent. Oswalt was regarded as one of 
the top starters on the free agent market and was courted by several teams. 
ESPN's Jayson Stark reported that Oswalt, only 34 years old and up to that 
point an elite pitcher, was holding out for the hope of a large salary 
from a team relatively close to his hometown of Weir, Mississippi.[20] 
However, several of the teams on Oswalt's list were not interested, and 
Stark reported that Oswalt's performance in 2011 prevented other teams 
from offering the money he expected.[20] On May 29, it was reported that 
Oswalt had signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers.[21] To get 
back to form, Roy started four games in the Rangers' minor league system; 
three games for the Triple-A Round Rock Express and one for the Double-A 
Frisco RoughRiders. Throughout the four starts, he went 1–1 with a 5.87 
ERA. On June 20, the Rangers announced that Oswalt would make his first 
start with the major league club on Friday, June 22, a home game against 
the Colorado Rockies. In his debut with the Rangers, Oswalt pitched 6 2⁄3 
innings. He collected 6 strikeouts, while surrendering 9 hits and one earned 
run. He received an ovation from the crowd as he exited. On July 31, the 
Rangers moved Oswalt to the bullpen after the acquisition of Ryan Dempster.[22] 
On August 23, Oswalt made a spot start against the Tampa Bay Rays to give 
Matt Harrison an extra day of rest. However, he was removed after two innings 
with soreness in his elbow. On September 11, he was diagnosed with a right 
forearm strain and did not throw for several days. His first appearance 
since the injury was on September 24 in a game against the Oakland Athletics. 
He pitched two scoreless innings of relief. The next day, he pitched 1.1 
innings.[23] Oswalt agreed to a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies 
on May 2, 2013.[24] He made his Rockies debut on June 20 against the Washington 
Nationals, pitching 5 innings and giving up 4 earned runs on 9 hits with 
11 strikeouts. Oswalt retired after the season and went to work for his 
former agent.[25][26] Oswalt, along with former teammate Lance Berkman 
signed a one-day contract with Houston to officially retire as an Astro 
on April 5, 2014.[27] Oswalt threw the following five pitches:[28] Oswalt's 
repertoire and approach evolved over time. His changeup was originally 
a rarely used circle change. However, in 2010, he changed the grip to make 
it more similar to a "fosh" grip. Originally a fastball-curveball pitcher, 
Oswalt made his changeup part of his standard repertoire.[29][30] He threw 
it only 4% of the time in 2008, but that jumped to 19% by 2011.[28] He 
says it also helped compensate for slightly reduced fastball velocity as 
a result of his age.[30] His curveball was a common 2-strike offering, 
and his changeup was frequently used in those counts to right-handed hitters. 
He also often used the change as a substitute for a fastball when he was 
behind in the count.[28] He liked to work his fastball high in the strike 
zone: "It's often the best pitch for me to throw to a guy who is sitting 
on a fastball. If I throw it high, a lot of times he'll swing and not catch 
up to it."[30][31] Oswalt had good control throughout his career. He appeared 
in the top 10 in the National League in BB/9 rate seven times, as well 
as six times in strikeout-to-walk ratio. He also finished four seasons 
without making an error.[32] Oswalt was known as one of the faster workers 
in baseball in terms of time between pitches.[33][34] Oswalt is married, 
and has three daughters.[1][35] He is a hobbyist of deer hunting. He has 
won Weir's buck hunting contest multiple times, thanks in part to the 1,000-acre
