Charles Henry Root (March 17, 1899 – November 5, 1970) was an American 
right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs for 
sixteen seasons from 1926 through 1941. He holds the club record for games, 
innings pitched, and career wins with 201. He was the last player born 
in the 19th century to pitch in a Major League game. Born in Middletown, 
Ohio, Root began his career on April 18, 1923 with the St. Louis Browns. 
On October 1, 1932, he threw the pitch that Babe Ruth allegedly predicted 
he would hit into the seats in the 1932 World Series at Wrigley Field in 
Chicago (see: Babe Ruth's called shot). Root, however, insisted that Ruth 
had not pointed to the bleachers. His best season was in 1927, where, despite 
a 3.76 ERA, he won 26 games. He had a career-low 2.60 ERA in 1933 while 
winning 15 games. He went to four World Series with the Cubs and lost all 
four. He died at age 71 in Hollister, California. As quoted by Baseball

tools in his baseball arsenal." According to his daughter Della, two days 
before his death he told her, "I gave my life to baseball, and I'll only 
be remembered for something that never happened". He is frequented referenced 
as a source of the name used for "root" system accounts under *BSD operating
