Everett is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States, 4 
miles (6.4 km) north of Boston. The population was 41,668 at the time of 
the 2010 United States Census. Everett was the last city in the United 
States to have a bicameral legislature,[2] which was composed of a seven-member 
Board of Aldermen and an eighteen-member Common Council. On November 8, 
2011, the voters approved a new City Charter that will change the City 
Council to a unicameral body with eleven members - six ward councilors 
and five councilors-at-large; an event that provoked an emotional response 
from many Everett residents. The new City Council was elected during the 
2013 City Election. Everett was originally part of Charlestown, and later 
Malden. It separated from Malden in 1870.[3] In 1892, Everett changed from 
a town to a city. On December 13, 1892, Alonzo H. Evans defeated George 
E. Smith to become Everett's first Mayor.[4] The city was named after Edward 
Everett,[5] who served as U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator, the 15th Governor 
of Massachusetts, Minister to Great Britain, and United States Secretary 
of State. He also served as President of Harvard University.[6] 1971, Distrigas
