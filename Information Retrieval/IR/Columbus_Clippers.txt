(1971–76), Columbus has been represented in the highest levels of minor 
league baseball since 1902, at first in the American Association (1902–54)

Jets, was the transplanted Ottawa Athletics which moved to Columbus in 
1955. While playing for its first two seasons as the top farm club of the 
Kansas City Athletics, the Jets spent the next 14 years as a top affiliate 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates (whose owner, John Galbreath, hailed from Columbus).
