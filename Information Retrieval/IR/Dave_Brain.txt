David Leonard "Dave" Brain (January 24, 1879 – May 25, 1959) was an infielder/outfielder 
in Major League Baseball who played for the Chicago White Sox (1901), St. 
Louis Cardinals (1903–1905), Pittsburgh Pirates (1905), Boston Beaneaters/Doves 
(1906–1907), Cincinnati Reds (1908) and New York Giants (1908). Brain batted 
and threw right-handed. He was born in Hereford, England. The English-born 
Brain was an unreliable fielder who showed some power with his bat and 
good speed on the basepaths. In 1903 for the St. Louis Cardinals he stole 
21 bases and hit 15 triples, including two three-triple games to become 
the only player in National League history to perform the feat twice in 
a season.[1] But his accomplishments were overshadowed by his 67 errors 
– 41 at shortstop and 22 at third base. In 1904 Brain played around the 
infield, hitting 24 doubles with 12 triples and 18 stolen bases, and also 
posted a career-high with 72 runs batted in. In 1905 he divided his playing 
time between St. Louis and the Pittsburgh Pirates, and played the next 
two seasons with the Boston teams of the National League. Brain led the 
league batters with 10 home runs in 1907, but he will never hit another 
home run. He played his last major league season in 1908, appearing in 
27 games with the Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants. In a seven-season 
career, Brain was a .252 hitter with 27 home runs and 303 RBI in 679 games.
