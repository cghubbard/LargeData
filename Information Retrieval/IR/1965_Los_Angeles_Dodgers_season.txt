KFI Vin Scully, Jerry Doggett The 1965 Los Angeles Dodgers finished the 
regular-season with a 97–65 record, which earned them the NL pennant by 
two games over their arch-rivals, the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers 
went on to win the World Series in seven games over the Minnesota Twins. 
The Dodgers won the World Series in 1963, but injuries and poor play saw 
them fall to 6th place in 1964. Despite their weak offense and the trade 
of power hitting Frank Howard for Claude Osteen during the off season, 
they were expected to contend in 1965 with their strong pitching. However, 
one month into the season, they lost their best hitter Tommy Davis when 
he fractured his ankle sliding into second base. Most experts thought this 
ended any hope the Dodgers had of winning the pennant. To replace Davis, 
the club called up journeyman Lou Johnson; his infectious cheerful attitude 
and knack for timely hitting helped keep the club in contention. The National 
League pennant race was a thriller, with 6 teams (the Dodgers, Giants, 
Pirates, Reds, Braves, and Phillies) in contention throughout a summer 
that saw the Dodgers, Giants, Braves, and Reds all take their turns in 
first place. With these 6 teams tightly bunched heading into September, 
the Giants went on a 14-game winning streak to take a 4 1/2 game lead with 
two weeks to play. Then the Dodgers went on a 13-game winning streak, and 
won 14 of their last 15 games to win the pennant by 2 games over the Giants. 
The Dodgers were led by shortstop Maury Wills with 94 stolen bases, Sandy 
Koufax (26–8, 2.04 E.R.A. and a then record 382 strikeouts), and Don Drysdale 
(23–12, 2.77 E.R.A.) Drysdale also chipped in with 7 home runs and was 
the club's only .300 hitter. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G

Albuquerque This was the first Major League Baseball draft. The Dodgers 
drafted 30 players this year in the June draft and an additional 2 in the 
August Legion draft. The first player the Dodgers ever drafted was a shortstop 
from Bakersfield High School named John Wyatt. He played in the teams farm 
system through 1970 but never advanced past Class-A. The most notable player 
drafted this year was Tom Seaver, who was picked in the 10th round from 
the University of Southern California, but he did not sign with the team 
and re-entered the draft the following year, where he was selected by the 
New York Mets. [7] [8] The August Legion Draft was for College players
