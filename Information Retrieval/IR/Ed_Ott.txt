Nathan Edward Ott (born July 11, 1951 in Muncy, Pennsylvania) is an American 
former professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League 
Baseball as a catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates and California Angels 
between 1974 and 1981.[1] He was a left-handed batter and threw right-handed.[1] 
Ott, who is unrelated to Hall of Famer Mel Ott, began his Major League 
career as a right fielder with the Pirates in 1974.[2] He converted to 
playing catcher in 1975, backing up Manny Sanguillén and Duffy Dyer.[3] 
The Pirates traded Sanguillen to the Oakland Athletics before the 1977 
season, and new Pirates manager Chuck Tanner installed Ott into a platoon 
role alongside Dyer. He played in 104 games that year while hitting for 
a .264 batting average.[4] His batting average improved to .269 in 1978 
while appearing in 112 games.[1] Ott platooned with catcher Steve Nicosia 
in 1979, and had his best season with a .273 batting average along with 
7 home runs, 51 runs batted in and a career-high .994 fielding percentage, 
second only to Gene Tenace among National League catchers.[1][5] Led by 
future Hall of Fame inductee, Willie Stargell, the 1979 Pirates won the 
National League Eastern Division pennant, then defeated the Cincinnati 
Reds in the 1979 National League Championship Series, before winning the 
1979 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles.[6][7] During the seven-game 
series, Ott posted a .333 batting average along with 3 runs batted in.[8] 
With young catcher Tony Peña ready to take over the catching duties, the 
Pirates traded Ott to the California Angels in April 1981.[9] Ott had a 
down year in '81 batting just .217. He tore his rotator cuff in '82 and 
missed the entire year. After 16 minor league games spread across the '83 
and '84 seasons, Ott retired. In an eight-year major league career, Ott 
played in 567 games, accumulating 465 hits in 1,792 at bats for a .259 
career batting average along with 33 home runs and 195 runs batted in.[1] 
He posted a .983 career fielding percentage.[1] Known as a tough, no-nonsense 
player, Ott was a former wrestler who was not afraid to use those skills 
on a baseball diamond. In an August 12, 1977, game against the New York 
Mets, Ott slid hard into Mets' second baseman Felix Millán trying to break 
up a double play.[10] Millán shouted at Ott and hit him with a baseball 
in his hand, and Ott answered by slamming him hard to the turf at Three 
Rivers Stadium, severely injuring his shoulder and essentially forcing 
him into retirement.[11] Ott later became a coach with the Houston Astros, 
serving under manager and former Pirates team mate Art Howe, from 1989 
to 1993, where he is remembered for his role in an on-field altercation 
against the Cincinnati Reds. In 1991, Reds reliever Rob Dibble (part of 
the Reds "nasty boys" bullpen) ignited a brawl when he threw a pitch behind 
the back of the Astros' Eric Yelding late in the game of a 4–1 Reds loss. 
A melee ensued and the 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) 230 lb. Dibble wound up on the 
bottom of a pile with the relatively diminutive Ott having put Dibble in 
such a choke hold that Dibble's face turned blue.[12][13] Ott was named 
manager of the Sussex Skyhawks of the Canadian-American Association of 
Professional Baseball for the 2010 season.[14] He currently resides in 
Forest, Virginia.[15] He is currently a coach of The New Jersey Jackals
