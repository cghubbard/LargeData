The 2017 Los Angeles Dodgers season is the 128th for the franchise in Major 
League Baseball, and their 60th season in Los Angeles, California. They 
will be trying to win their fifth straight NL West Championship. The day 
after the 2016 World Series several Dodgers instantly became free agents: 
Pitchers Kenley Jansen, Brett Anderson, Rich Hill, Jesse Chavez, Joe Blanton 
and J. P. Howell, second baseman Chase Utley, third baseman Justin Turner 
and outfielder Josh Reddick.[1] On November 9, relief pitcher Chin-hui 
Tsao was outrighted to the minors and removed from the 40 man roster.[2] 
On November 7, 2016, the Dodgers traded catcher Carlos Ruiz to the Seattle 
Mariners for pitcher Vidal Nuño[3] and on November 11, they traded infielder/outfileder 
Howie Kendrick to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for first baseman/outfielder 
Darin Ruf and minor leaguer Darnell Sweeney.[4] Through games of [month]
