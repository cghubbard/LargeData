As player As manager Paul Leo Molitor (born August 22, 1956), nicknamed 
"Molly" and "The Ignitor", is an American former Major League Baseball 
(MLB) player and current manager of the Minnesota Twins, who is in the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. During his 21-year baseball career, he played for 
the Milwaukee Brewers (1978–1992), Toronto Blue Jays (1993–1995), and Minnesota 
Twins (1996–1998). He was known for his exceptional hitting and speed. 
He made seven All-Star Game appearances and was the World Series MVP in 
1993. Molitor grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota 
before beginning his MLB career. Molitor served as a coach for the Seattle 
Mariners and the Twins after his retirement as a player. In 2004, he was 
elected to the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, becoming 
one of the first players enshrined after spending a significant portion 
of his career as a designated hitter. He was a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. On November 3, 2014, Molitor was announced as 
the 13th manager for the Minnesota Twins.[1][2] Molitor was born in Saint 
Paul, Minnesota. After graduating from Cretin High School,[3] he was selected 
in the 28th round of the 1974 free agent draft as a pitcher by the St. 
Louis Cardinals, but opted instead to attend college at the University 
of Minnesota. He was a three-year starter for the Golden Gophers, earning 
All American honors as a shortstop for his sophomore and junior years. 
Between his junior and senior seasons, Molitor suffered a broken jaw. With 
his jaw wired shut for eight weeks, Molitor lost 40 pounds.[4] After his 
junior year in college, he was selected third overall in the 1977 Major 
League Baseball draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. He signed with the Brewers 
and began his professional career in Iowa, playing for the Class A Burlington 
Bees of the Midwest League.[5] In 64 games with Burlington, Molitor hit 
for a .346 batting average, 8 home runs, 50 runs batted in (RBI) and 14 
stolen bases.[6] Molitor began as a shortstop, then moved to second base 
when Robin Yount returned from a brief injury. He made his MLB debut in 
1978, playing in 125 games and hitting .273 with 6 home runs, 45 RBI and 
30 stolen bases.[7] In 1981, he spent time at center field and right field 
to avoid the injuries associated with infield play.[8] Molitor was moved 
to third base before the 1982 season. Molitor was part of a young Milwaukee 
Brewers team that lost the 1982 World Series in seven games to the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Molitor batted .355 during the series. In Game 1, he had 
five hits, a World Series record. During the 1982 season, he hit .302 and 
led the American League (AL) with 136 runs scored. Molitor struggled with 
injuries for much of his early career, being placed on the disabled list 
six times between 1980 and 1986. In 1984, Molitor struggled with elbow 
problems, played in only 13 games and ultimately underwent surgery in an 
attempt to salvage his career.[4] He played in 140 games in 1985, hitting 
.297 with 10 home runs and 48 RBI. He followed that with a .281 average, 
9 home runs and 55 RBI in 1986.[7] That year he suffered a hamstring injury, 
returned for a few days, then reinjured it.[9] He played in 105 games that 
season.[7] Molitor attracted national media attention in 1987 during his 
39-game hitting streak. Near the end of the streak, columnist Mike Downey 
wrote that "the amazing thing about Paul Molitor's recent bat-o-rama is 
not that he has hit in 33 straight games but that he has played in 33 straight 
games."[9] The streak ended with Molitor in the on-deck circle when Rick 
Manning got a game-ending hit to beat the Cleveland Indians on August 26, 
1987. Fans booed Manning for driving in the winning run and thus depriving 
Molitor of one last chance to reach 40 games. The streak stands as the 
fifth-longest in modern-day baseball history, and remains the longest since 
Pete Rose's 44-game hit streak in 1978.[10] Although Molitor wanted to 
remain with Milwaukee when he became a free agent after the 1992 season, 
the franchise offered him a one-year contract with a $900,000 pay cut (to 
$2.5 million), while the Toronto Blue Jays offered a three-year, $13 million 
($21,000,000 in current dollar terms) deal, leading to his signing with 
the Blue Jays. Agent Ron Simon said, "I was also talking with Milwaukee, 
but it became clear to us that Milwaukee didn't have the same kind of interest 
in signing Molitor, perhaps because of their financial situation."[11] 
Molitor quickly became an offensive juggernaut. He hit .332 with 22 home 
runs and 111 RBI.[7] Returning to the playoffs for the first time since 
1982,[12] he was a key part of the Blue Jays' second World Championship. 
Molitor hit 2 doubles, two triples, and 2 home runs in the series earning 
the World Series MVP Award and tied a World Series record by batting .500 
(12-for-24) in the six-game series. In 1993, Molitor led the AL in plate 
appearances (725) and hits (211).[7] In 1994, a strike-shortened season, 
Molitor hit .341 and led the AL in games played (115) and singles (107). 
He also stole 20 bases that season without ever being caught, one short 
of Kevin McReynolds' 1988 major league record of 21.[13] Molitor's average 
dropped to .270 in 1995, his lowest mark in more than ten years.[7] He 
left the Blue Jays after the 1995 season, and joined his hometown Minnesota 
Twins for the final three seasons of his career, where he acquired his 
3,000th hit. He was the first player to reach the 3,000 hits plateau with 
a triple. Molitor was relishing the opportunity to play with Twins superstar 
Kirby Puckett, but Puckett developed career-ending glaucoma during spring 
training in 1996 and never played again. In 1996, Molitor became the second 
40-year-old, after Hall of Famer Sam Rice, to have a 200-hit season, leading 
the league with 225, while also leading the league in singles with 167. 
Molitor also remains the last MLB player to drive in 100 or more runs in 
a season while hitting fewer than 10 home runs (9 HR, 113 RBIs).[14] Molitor 
hit .305 in 1997, his twelfth season to finish with a batting average higher 
than .300. In 1998, he hit .281 with 4 home runs, 69 RBI and 9 stolen bases. 
Other than his very brief 1984 season, the 1998 season was the first in 
Molitor's career in which he did not reach double-digit stolen base totals.[7] 
He retired in December, saying, "My heart tells me I've done what I can 
do on the field and in this game", Molitor said. "I'm happy to leave it 
playing my last season in a Twins uniform... Now I'm going to redirect 
my efforts to find out what else the future holds."[15] After retiring 
as a player, Molitor remained with the Twins as a bench coach for three 
seasons. He was considered a leading candidate to manage the team when 
Tom Kelly retired after 2001, but he declined in part because the Twins 
were still being targeted for potential contraction. Molitor was a hitting 
coach with the Mariners in 2004. Molitor joined the Twins coaching staff 
in 2014 to oversee baserunning, bunting, infield instruction, and positioning. 
He also assisted with in-game strategy. The Twins hired Molitor to fill 
their manager vacancy for the 2015 season, and introduced him in a press 
conference on November 4, 2014.[16] Molitor's lifetime statistics include 
2,683 games played, 1,782 runs scored, 3,319 hits, 234 home runs, 1,307 
runs batted in, a .306 batting average, and 504 stolen bases. His 3,319 
hits rank him ninth all-time. In addition, he batted .368 in five postseason 
series, and was an all-star seven times. Molitor recorded these statistics 
while missing nearly 500 games due to various injuries throughout his career. 
In 1999, Molitor ranked No. 99 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players, and he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Molitor was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic 
Hall of Fame in 1999. On June 11, 1999, the Brewers retired Molitor's uniform 
number 4. During the ceremony at Milwaukee County Stadium, Molitor announced 
that if he went into the Hall of Fame, he would do so as a Brewer. On January 
6, 2004, he was elected to the Hall in his first year of eligibility, with 
85.2% of the votes. True to his word, he joined Robin Yount as the only 
Hall of Famers to be depicted on their plaques with Brewers caps. At the 
time of his induction, Molitor was the hitting coach for the Seattle Mariners.[17] 
Molitor is one of five players in major league history with at least 3,000 
hits, a .300 lifetime batting average, and 500 stolen bases. The other 
four are Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, and Eddie Collins, and Ichiro Suzuki. Only 
Ichiro played beyond 1930. Molitor is the only player ever to accomplish 
those feats and hit at least 200 home runs. Molitor is also the first player 
in World Series history to have at least two home runs, two doubles, and 
two triples in one series (1993). He is a member of an exclusive club, 
hitting .300 or better in full season across three decades (1970s, 80s, 
and 90s). During the early years of his career, Molitor began using cocaine 
and cannabis. During the trial of a drug dealer in 1984, Molitor admitted 
that he had used drugs.[18] Many years later, he said, "There are things 
you're not so proud of — failures, mistakes, dabbling in drugs, a young 
ballplayer in the party scene. Part of it was peer pressure. I was young 
and single, and hung around with the wrong people... You learn from it. 
You find a positive in it. It makes you appreciate the things that are 
good."[19] He stopped using drugs in 1981, and has since visited schools 
to lecture about the dangers of drug use.[17] During his Hall of Fame induction 
speech, Molitor mentioned his difficult family relationships. He admitted 
that he had a son in Toronto – conceived in between marriages – that he
