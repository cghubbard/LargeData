As Player As Manager Hiromichi Ishige (石毛 宏典, born September 22, 1956 in 
Asahi, Chiba) is a retired Japanese professional baseball player[1] and 
manager in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. He played most of his 
career for the Seibu Lions. The 1986 Pacific League Most Valuable Player, 
Ishige was a seven-time Best Nine Award-winner, and a ten-time Gold Glove 
winner. A 14-time All-Star, Ishige left a fabulous track record in 16 years 
as a shortstop and third baseman in the Pacific League. Ishige was drafted 
by the Lotte Orions in the third round of the 1974 NPB draft, but went 
to college instead. He won a Tokyo Metropolitan University League batting 
title and made six Best Nines in college. He was then picked in the first 
round of the 1980 NPB draft by the Seibu Lions. Ishige made the All-Star 
team as a rookie with Seibu and would make it all 14 seasons he was with 
them. He hit .311/.380/.531 that first year with 21 homers and 25 steals 
(in 34 tries). He won a Gold Glove, made his first Best Nine and won Rookie 
of the Year honors. Ishige's production slipped to a .259/.337/.401 line 
in 1982 though he stole 22 in 26 tries and won a Gold Glove and Best Nine. 
He hit .296/.321/.370 in his first Japan Series, to help Seibu take the 
1982 Series but was thrown out in two of three steal attempts. In 1983, 
Ishige hit .303/.593/.503 with 29 steals in 34 tries, hit 16 homers, scored 
86 runs, won another Gold Glove, earned a third Best Nine spot and tied 
Yutaka Fukumoto and Hiromi Matsunaga for the PL lead with 7 triples. He 
hit .276/.276/.379 as Seibu won another Japan Series, but was 0 for 1 in 
steals. The next year, Ishige batted .259/.338/.498 with 91 runs, 26 homers 
and 26 steals (in 36 tries); Keijiro Yumioka beat him out for the Best 
Nine that time. While he only stole 11 bases (in 14 tries) in 1985, Ishige 
remained a potent offensive force, chipping in at a .280/.386/.508 clip 
with 96 runs, 27 homers and 88 walks. His 26 doubles led the league and 
he won another Gold Glove and Best Nine. In the 1985 Japan Series, Hiromichi 
hit .208/.296/.583 with 3 home runs in a losing effort. Ishige won his 
MVP in 1986,[2] when he batted .329/.386/.531, won another Gold Glove at 
short, scored 91 runs, drove in 89, smacked 27 home runs and stole 19 bases. 
He set a Nippon Pro Baseball record by leading off eight games with home 
runs and set a Seibu club record with a 23-game hitting streak. He hit 
.297/.297/.405 as Seibu won a hard-fought 1986 Japan Series over the Hiroshima 
Carp. In '87, Hiromichi hit .269/.331/.370 in an off-year but still won 
a Gold Glove and made the Best Nine. He batted .348/.423/.652 in the 1987 
Japan Series to win his fourth ring. That winter, he assumed chairmanship 
of the board of directors of the Japan Professional Baseball Players Association, 
replacing Hiromitsu Ochiai; two years later, Akinobu Okada would take the 
role. The 31-year-old had his third and last 20-20 year in 1988 (21 HR, 
22 SB in 26 tries; he would never hit 20 homers again) and batted .283/.364/.441 
and won his 7th Gold Glove. He had his best Series, the 1989 Japan Series, 
hitting .389/.389/.944 with 3 HR, 5 runs and 6 RBI in five games to win 
the Series MVP award. In '89, Ishige stole 28 in 33 tries for his final 
20-steal season and batted .270/.395/.428. He drew 98 walks, a career-best 
and led the PL in that category. Ishige hit .298/.364/.429 in 1990 and 
was 7 for 8 in steals. Now a third baseman, he fielded .991, a Pacific 
League record for the position. He went 1 for 12 in the 1990 Japan Series 
but drew four walks as his club won a sixth Series. At one point, he had 
hit in 17 straight games in a Japan Series, a record. In '91, the veteran 
still produced at a .269/.331/.424 rate and he hit .280/.333/.440 in the 
1991 Japan Series, Seibu's seventh victory in his time with the club. He 
won his first Gold Glove in three years. In 1992, Ishige batted .297/.359/.413, 
won a Gold Glove and made his seventh Best Nine, the first in five years. 
He hit .240/.286/.440 as Seibu took the 1992 Japan Series for their eighth 
Series win in his 12 seasons, marking it as the greatest Pacific League 
dynasty ever[citation needed] — other key contributors in the run had included 
Koji Akiyama, Kimiyasu Kudoh, Hisanobu Watanabe, Orestes Destrade, Kazuhiro 
Kiyohara, Taigen Kaku, Osamu Higashio, and Tetsuya Shiozaki. Ishige was 
the captain of the team during the last stretch of Series victories at 
least. Destrade recalls that Ishige was the team's motivator.[citation 
needed] Ishige continued to produce as the 36-year-old put up a .306/.389/.479 
batting line in 1993, won his last Gold Glove and made his final Best Nine. 
He hit .304/.385/.304 in the 1993 Japan Series as Seibu fell in 7 games 
to the Yakult Swallows to end their dynastic run. In '94, Hiromichi hit 
.266/.335/.397 and made his last All-Star appearance. He went 1 for 12 
with three walks in the 1994 Japan Series. Leaving Seibu after 14 All-Star 
seasons and 8 titles in 14 years, Ishige moved on to the Fukuoka Daiei 
Hawks, where the 38-year-old hit .200/.260/.275 to signal that his glory 
days were definitely gone. Fellow faded star Matsunaga was the primary 
third baseman that year. In 1996, Ishige concluded his playing career by 
going 3 for 23 for Daiei. Overall, Ishige hit .283/.362/.450 in 7,570 plate 
appearances, cracked 236 homers and stole 243 in 314 tries. Through 2006, 
Hiromichi ranks 25th all-time in NPB in runs (1,049, 10 behind Matsunaga), 
18th in sacrifice bunts (218; manager Masahiko Mori often had him bunt 
as he felt Ishige hit into too many double plays in the clutch. Destrade, 
on the other hand, described him as a timely player who drove in key runs,[citation 
needed] showing how different perceptions of "clutch play" can be) and 
22nd in strikeouts (1,127). With one more year as a regular, he likely 
would have been in the top 30 in walks as well.[citation needed] After 
retiring as a player, Ishige was a minor league manager for Seibu for two 
years then spent a year as a commentator for NHK in 1999. When manager 
Akira Ohgi was let go after the 2001 season, the Orix BlueWave hired Ishige 
to replace him as manager. The club fell from above-.500 in '01 to 50-87-3 
and last place. The next year, they started poorly and Ishige lambasted 
high-strikeout sluggers Fernando Seguignol and Scott Sheldon. After a 7-12-1 
start, Ishige was let go and they brought in Leon Lee as the new manager, 
the first African-American manager in NPB history. Lee fared no better 
with the sorry lot and they finished last again. In 2005, Ishige founded 
the independent Shikoku Island League (now known as Shikoku Island League
