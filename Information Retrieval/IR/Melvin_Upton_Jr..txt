Melvin Emanuel Upton Jr. (born August 21, 1984), formerly known as B. J. 
Upton,[1] is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Toronto 
Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has also played in MLB for 
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays / Rays, Atlanta Braves, and San Diego Padres. 
Upton played with his brother, Justin Upton, as members of the Atlanta 
Braves and San Diego Padres. Melvin and Justin are the only two brothers 
in MLB history to be selected in the no. 1 and 2 slots of the draft (in 
separate years). The Upton brothers are also the first brothers to make 
it into the 20–20 club (both have hit 20 home runs and have 20 stolen bases 
in a season). Before high school, Upton played on the same travel baseball 
team as several other MLB players, including Mark Reynolds, David Wright, 
and Ryan Zimmerman.[2] Upton is a graduate of Greenbrier Christian Academy.[3] 
As a member of the 2001 Team USA Junior National team, Upton batted .462 
(12-for-26) in nine games. The team went 9–2 and won the Silver Medal in 
Cuba that year. In 2002, Upton was named a first-team All-American by Baseball 
America, batting .641 (50-for-78) with 11 doubles, 4 triples, 11 home runs, 
and 32 RBIs during his senior year at Greenbrier.[4] Upton was drafted 
second overall as a shortstop in the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by 
Tampa Bay out of Greenbrier Christian Academy in Chesapeake, Virginia. 
He was widely considered a very polished prospect able to hit for both 
power and average. Upton was ranked as the # 21 prospect in baseball before 
the 2003 season by Baseball America, and as the # 2 prospect a year later 
in 2004.[5] In both 2004 and 2005, Upton was the starting shortstop in 
the All-Star Futures Game. In 2003, Upton committed 56 errors, leading 
the minor leagues. He made his major league debut on August 2, 2004, becoming 
the youngest Ray ever and the youngest player in the major leagues in 2004. 
In that game against the Boston Red Sox, he went 1–3 with a walk, with 
his hit being a seventh-inning single. His younger brother, Justin, was 
taken with the top overall choice of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft, 
making them the highest-drafted siblings of all time.[6] In 2004 he started 
16 games at shortstop, 11 at third base, and 1 in left field.[7] In 2006, 
he had 48 starts, all at third base.[7] In 2007, Upton emerged from spring 
training as the Rays' starting second baseman. On June 8, Upton was forced 
to leave a game against the Florida Marlins early due to a strained left 
quadriceps.[8] The injury forced him out of action until July 13. Before 
the injury, he was batting .320/.396/.545 with 9 home runs. Starting 48 
games at second base in 2007, he committed 12 errors, fifth in the league 
for the year.[7] Although he played mostly second base until the injury, 
Upton became the team's starting center fielder upon returning. In 2007, 
he had 24 home runs, and was 22 out of 30 in stolen base attempts. He was 
one of only 6 batters in the AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen 
bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, Ian Kinsler, Grady Sizemore, 
and Curtis Granderson. During the 2008 season, Upton was twice disciplined 
by Rays manager Joe Maddon for lack of hustle. On August 6, Upton was held 
out of the lineup for failing to run out a ground ball the night before.[9] 
On August 15, Upton was benched in the sixth inning for not running out 
a double play ball. He was replaced by Justin Ruggiano. A few days later, 
Upton hit a ball to left field that bounced off the wall. From the crack 
of the bat, Upton reacted to it as a home run, dropping the bat and casually 
jogging down the first base line. He then tried to stretch it into a double 
and was thrown out by the left fielder. He was not benched for this incident, 
however. Joe Maddon was interviewed and called it "just a mental mistake".[10] 
Upton hit .273 with just nine home runs and 44 stolen bases in 2008 (second 
in the AL; while he led the AL in times caught stealing, with 16).[11] 
However, he would become one of the team's post-season heroes, as he hit 
7 home runs in the three post-season series' Tampa Bay played in. During 
the 2008 American League Division Series against the Chicago White Sox, 
Upton hit three home runs and drove in four runs. Against the Boston Red 
Sox in the 2008 ALCS he hit four home runs and drove in 11. In game 5 of 
the World Series, Upton stole second base and scored a crucial game tying 
run moments before the game was suspended due to torrential rain. It resumed 
two nights later and the Rays lost the World Series to the Philadelphia 
Phillies, 4 games to 1. Upton became the first player of the Tampa Bay 
Rays to hit for the cycle, doing so on October 2, 2009.[12] In 2009, he 
batted .241, his 42 stolen bases were third in the league (as he was caught 
a third-most 14 times), and his 152 strikeouts were fifth in the AL.[7] 
During the Rays' June 27, 2010, home game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
Upton loafed after a ball hit by Rusty Ryal into left-center field, allowing 
a double to become a triple.[13] At the end of that half inning, Evan Longoria 
approached Upton in the dugout, obviously to mention his displeasure with 
Upton's effort. Upton immediately at the criticism and argued face-to-face 
with Longoria, repeatedly pointing a finger in his face, until Longoria 
walked away while Rays player Willy Aybar grabbed Upton by the waist and 
took him away from the scene. In 2010, he batted .237, his 164 strikeouts 
were second in the American League, and his 42 steals were fifth.[7] On 
September 11, 2011, Upton hit his first grand slam in a game against the 
Boston Red Sox.[14] On August 3, 2012, Upton hit his 100th career home 
run. His brother, Justin Upton would hit his 100th career home run the 
same day.[15] On September 9, 2012, Upton had his first three home run 
game in a game against the Texas Rangers.[16] In the final game of the 
2012 season, Upton hit a base hit into left and was taken out of the game 
for his final appearance for the Rays.[17] During the 2012–2013 offseason, 
Upton entered free agency where he signed a five-year, $75.25 million contract 
with the Atlanta Braves. This contract was the largest free agent contract 
ever by the Braves, surpassing the 15 million dollar-a-year deal they inked 
with starting pitcher Derek Lowe in the offseason before the 2009 season.[18] 
He and his brother hit back to back home runs on April 23, 2013 against 
the Colorado Rockies, which was the first time brothers hit back to back 
home runs since 1938.[19] Upton's offensive output suffered in 2013. He 
batted just .184 with 26 RBI in 126 games, and had the second-highest strikeout 
rate among hitters with at least 400 plate appearances.[20] Baseball Reference 
put his offensive value at −1.3 wins above replacement.[21] On April 26, 
2014, Upton recorded his 1,000th career hit in a game against the Cincinnati 
Reds on an infield single that deflected off the glove of Reds pitcher 
Mike Leake, who attempted to make a play on the ball.[22] On August 8, 
the Uptons both hit home runs in the same game for the fifth time, setting 
a new Major League record for brothers. The Uptons previously shared the 
record for homering in the same game on four occasions with Vladimir and 
Wilton Guerrero and Jason and Jeremy Giambi.[23] Upton missed spring training 
in 2015 due to left foot inflammation.[24] On April 4, 2015, Upton was 
placed on the disabled list due to his ongoing foot problems. On April 
5, 2015, Upton was traded to the San Diego Padres along with Craig Kimbrel 
in exchange for Carlos Quentin, Cameron Maybin, outfield prospect Jordan 
Paroubeck, pitching prospect Matt Wisler, and the 41st overall pick in 
the 2015 MLB draft.[25] This once again reunited him with his brother Justin, 
who had also been traded to the Padres in December of 2014.[26] Upton was 
activated on June 7 after missing the start of the season with an injured 
foot.[27] Upton soon began making starts in center field, which had been 
primarily manned by Wil Myers and Will Venable earlier in the season. Upton 
finished 2015 with a .259 batting average and five home runs in 87 games, 
including 47 starts in center field.[7] In 2016, Upton hit .256 with 16 
home runs, 45 RBI, and 20 stolen bases in 92 games before being traded.[7] 
On July 26, 2016, Upton was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays, along with 
cash considerations, for minor league pitcher Hansel Rodriguez.[28] His 
first at-bat as a member of the Blue Jays came on July 26, against the 
San Diego Padres. He came in to pinch-hit for Justin Smoak and grounded 
into a fielder's choice.[29] Upton would go on to appear in 57 games for 
Toronto, and hit .196 with four home runs and 16 RBI. He also recorded 
seven stolen bases, including the 300th of his career.[7] Until 2015, Upton 
went by the initials "B. J.", which stood for "Bossman Junior". Upton's 
father, Manny, was nicknamed "Bossman". Upton stated his desire to use 
his actual name was a result of teammates and fans knowing him as B.J. 
and feeling the name was irrelevant to him away from the ballpark. Upton 
spoke with his family members about using his birth name full time, before 
filing the paperwork with the Major League Baseball office.[30][31][32]
