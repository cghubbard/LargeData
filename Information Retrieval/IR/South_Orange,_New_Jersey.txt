South Orange, officially the Township of South Orange Village, is a suburban 
township in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United 
States Census, the village's population was 16,198,[9][10][11] reflecting 
a decline of 766 (-4.5%) from the 16,964 counted in the 2000 Census, which 
had in turn increased by 574 (+3.5%) from the 16,390 counted in the 1990 
Census.[21] Seton Hall University is located in the township. "The time 
and circumstances under which the name South Orange originated will probably 
never be known," wrote historian William H. Shaw in 1884, "and we are obliged 
to fall back on a tradition, that Mr. Nathan Squier first used the name 
in an advertisement offering wood for sale" in 1795.[22] Other sources 
attribute the derivation for all of The Oranges to King William III, Prince 
of Orange.[23] Of the 565 municipalities in New Jersey, South Orange Village 
is one of only four with a village type of government; the others are Loch 
Arbour, Ridgefield Park and Ridgewood.[24] South Orange Village dates back 
to May 4, 1869, when it was formed within South Orange Township (now Maplewood). 
On March 4, 1904, the Village of South Orange was created by an act of 
the New Jersey Legislature and separated from South Orange Township.[25] 
In 1978, the village's name was changed by referendum to "The Township 
of South Orange Village" , becoming the first of more than a dozen Essex 
County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order take 
advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships 
a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.[26][27][28] 
What is now South Orange was part of a territory purchased from the Lenape 
Native Americans in 1666 by Robert Treat, who founded Newark that year 
on the banks of the Passaic River. The unsettled areas north and west of 
Newark were at first referred to as the uplands. South Orange was called 
the Chestnut Hills for a time.[22] There are two claimants to the first 
English settlement in present-day South Orange. In 1677 brothers Joseph 
and Thomas Brown began clearing land for a farm in the area northwest of 
the junction of two old trails that are now South Orange Avenue and Ridgewood 
Road. A survey made in 1686 states, "note this Land hath a House on it, 
built by Joseph Brown and Thomas Brown, either of them having an equal 
share of it" located at the present southwest corner of Tillou Road and 
Ridgewood Road. Minutes of a Newark town meeting of September 27, 1680, 
record that "Nathaniel Wheeler, Edward Riggs, and Joseph Riggs, have a 
Grant to take up Land upon the Chesnut Hill by Raway River near the Stone 
House". The phrasing shows that a stone house already existed near (not 
on) the property. Joseph Riggs (seemingly the son of Edward Riggs) had 
a house just south of the Browns' house, at the northwest corner of South 
Orange Avenue and Ridgewood Road, according to a road survey of 1705. The 
same road survey locates Edward Riggs's residence near Millburn and Nathaniel 
Wheeler's residence in modern West Orange at the corner of Valley Road 
and Main Street.[22] Wheeler's property in South Orange extended east of 
the Rahway River including the site of an old house now known as the "Stone 
House", standing on the north side of South Orange Avenue just to the west 
of Grove Park. By 1756 or earlier this property was owned by Samuel Pierson. 
A survey of adjoining property in 1767 mentions "Pierson's house" forming 
accidentally the earliest documentation of a house on the property, which 
may be much older. Bethuel Pierson, son of Samuel, lived in this house 
and when he inherited it in 1773/74 he was said to live "at the mountain 
plantation by a certain brook called Stone House Brook." Sometime during 
his ownership (he died in 1791) "Bethuel Pierson had a stone addition added 
to his dwelling-house, which he caused to be dedicated by religious ceremonies". 
This would appear to be the stone-walled portion of the "Stone House".[22] 
Stone House Brook runs west along the north side of the east-west road, 
past the "Stone House" and joining the Rahway River at about the location 
of the Brown and Riggs houses already noted. The oldest parts of the Pierson 
house are the oldest surviving structure in South Orange. A deed of 1800 
locates a property as being in "the Township of Newark, in the Parish of 
Orange, at a place called South Orange", marking the end of the name Chestnut 
Hills. Orange had been named after the ruler of England, William of Orange. 
Most of modern South Orange became part of Orange Township in 1806, part 
of Clinton Township in 1834, and part of South Orange Township in 1861. 
Gordon's Gazetteer circa 1830 describes the settlement as having "about 
30 dwellings, a tavern and store, a paper mill and Presbyterian church".[29] 
A country resort called the Orange Mountain House was established in 1847 
on Ridgewood Road in present-day West Orange, where guests could enjoy 
the "water cure" from natural spring water and walk in the grounds that 
extended up the slope of South Mountain. The hotel burned down in 1890. 
The only remnants today are the names of Mountain Station and the Mountain 
House Road leading west from it to the site of the hotel.[30] South Orange 
could be reached by the Morris and Essex Railroad which opened in 1837 
between Newark and Morristown. As of 1869, the M&E became part of the main 
line of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad which ran from Hoboken 
to Buffalo with through trains to Chicago.[31][page needed] The Montrose 
neighborhood was developed after the Civil War. Its large houses on generous 
lots attracted wealthy families from Newark and New York City during the 
decades from 1870 to 1900.[32] The Orange Lawn Tennis Club was founded 
in 1880 at a location in Montrose, and in 1886 it was the location of the 
first US national tennis championships. The club moved to larger grounds 
on Ridgewood Road in 1916. Major tournament events were held at the club 
throughout the grass court era, and even into the mid-1980s professional 
events would occasionally be held there. What is now the Baird Community 
House was up until about 1920 the clubhouse for a golf course that encompassed 
what is now Meadowlands Park. Until regrading was performed during the 
1970s, the outline of one of the course's sand traps was still visible 
near the base of Flood's Hill, a spot that has historically been one of 
the favorite sleigh riding spots in Essex County. The construction of Village 
Hall in 1894 and the "old" library building in 1896 indicate how the village 
was growing by that date.[30] Horsecar service from Newark and Morristown 
started in 1865, running via South Orange Avenue to the station. Electric 
trolley cars began running the line in 1893 and by about 1900 a branch 
of this line also ran down Valley Street into Maplewood. Another separate 
trolley line, eventually dubbed the "Swamp Line", ran from the west side 
of the station north through what is now park land and along Meadowbrook 
Lane into West Orange where it ended at Main St.[33] An old postcard photo 
shows a station shelter at Montrose Ave. The DL&W rebuilt the railroad 
through town in 1914-1916, raising the tracks above street level and opening 
new station buildings at South Orange and Mountain Station. In September 
1930, a frail Thomas Edison (he would die about a year later) inaugurated 
electric train service on the M&E between Hoboken and South Orange, with 
further extensions of service to Morristown and Dover being initiated over 
the coming months.[34][page needed] The South Orange Library Association 
was organized by William Beebe, president of the Republican Club, where 
on November 14, 1864, a group of men and women met. Books were donated 
and the library was established in a corner room on the second floor of 
the Republican Club where it remained until 1867 when it was moved to a 
second floor room of the building next door on South Orange Avenue, near 
Sloan Street. It stayed there until 1884, when the building, with the library 
still on its second floor, was moved by horses up South Orange Avenue to 
the northwest corner of Scotland Road. Although supported as yet only by 
members' dues and a few gifts of money which were put into an endowment 
fund, in 1886 a new association was formed to establish a free circulating 
library and reading room which took over the loan books and other property 
of the old association. It was during this period, before Village Hall 
was built, that Village Trustees met in the Library's room. On May 1, 1889, 
the library was moved to a ground floor space at 59 South Orange Avenue. 
At an annual meeting in 1895, Library Trustees considered the question 
of obtaining a library building and Eugene V. Connett's offer of a library 
site on the corner of Scotland Road and Taylor Place, with condition that 
$7,500 be subscribed, was accepted and the subscription was met. On May 
8, 1896, the library was moved into the building on that corner. A referendum 
held on April 27, 1926, showed that citizens had voted ten to one in favor 
of the town taking over full support of the library. It thereupon became 
"The South Orange Public Library." In February, 1929, the Village Trustees 
passed an ordinance providing funds to construct a rear wing on the library 
and to provide a Children's Room in the basement, book stacks and a balcony 
on the floor above, together with rehabilitation work on the older part 
of the building. In November 1968, the new library building on the corner 
of Scotland Road and Comstock Place was dedicated. Good transportation 
and a booming economy caused South Orange and neighboring towns to begin 
a major transformation in the 1920s into bedroom communities for Newark 
and New York City. Large houses were built in the blocks around the Orange 
Lawn Tennis club, while in other areas, especially south of South Orange 
Avenue, more modest foursquare houses were constructed. The only large 
area not developed by 1930 was the high ground west of Wyoming Avenue. 
There were two rock quarries within the village supplying trap rock for 
construction. Kernan's operated as late as the 1980s at the top of Tillou 
Road. The town's other larger businesses were lumber and coal yards clustered 
around the railroad station that supplied them. The town's business district 
is still located in the blocks just east of the station. The old Morris 
and Essex Railroad is operated today by NJ Transit. Midtown Direct, initiated 
in 1996, offers service directly into Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, 
and has since caused a surge in real estate prices as the commute time 
to midtown dropped from about 50 minutes to 35, as the service eliminated 
the need for passengers to transfer to PATH trains at Hoboken. As a result, 
demand for commuter parking permits in lots adjoining the train and bus 
stations is extremely high, with a waiting list as long as five years for 
commuter parking spots.[35] South Orange has a number of places listed 
on the State and National Historic Registers. The village is one of only 
a few in New Jersey to retain gas light street illumination (others include 
Riverton, Palmyra and Glen Ridge). The gaslight, together with the distinctive 
Village Hall, has long been the symbol of South Orange. Many of the major 
roads in town do have modern mercury vapor streetlights (built into gaslight 
frames), but most of the residential sections of the town are still gas-lit. 
A proposal to replace all the gaslights in town with electric streetlights 
was explored as both a cost-saving and security measure during the 1970s. 
And although the changeover to electric was rejected at the time, the light 
output of the lamps was increased to provide more adequate lighting. There 
have been claims that South Orange has more operating gaslights than any 
other community in the United States. In 2010, the village initiated a 
project that would automatically shut the lamps in the morning and light 
them at dusk, as part of an effort to save as much as $400,000 each year 
in energy costs for the 1,438 gas lamps across the village.[41] Architecture 
is extremely varied. Most of the town is single-family wood-framed houses, 
however, there are a few apartment buildings from various eras as well 
as townhouse-style condominiums of mostly more recent vintage. Houses cover 
a range that includes every common style of the Mid-Atlantic United States 
since the late nineteenth century, and in sizes that range from brick English 
Cottages to giant Mansard-roofed mansions. Tudor, Victorian, Colonial, 
Ranch, Modern, and many others are all to be found. Most municipal government 
structures date from the 1920s, with a few being of more modern construction. 
Many residents commute to New York City, but others work locally or in 
other parts of New Jersey. South Orange has a central business district 
with restaurants, banks, and other retail and professional services. There 
are a few small office buildings, but no large-scale enterprise other than 
Seton Hall University. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
township had a total area of 2.857 square miles (7.401 km2), including 
2.855 square miles (7.395 km2) of land and 0.002 square miles (0.006 km2) 
of water (0.08%).[1][2] South Orange is bordered by the Essex County municipalities 
of Maplewood, Newark, West Orange, Orange, and East Orange. South Orange 
also comes close to bordering both Livingston and Millburn.[42] The East 
Branch of the Rahway River, which originates in West Orange, flows through 
the entire length of the township. Most of the time it is a trickle but 
flows can be heavy after rain.[43] In the past it would occasionally overflow 
its banks and flood low-lying parts of town an issue that was addressed 
by United States Army Corps of Engineers flood control projects that remediated 
the problem in the mid-1970s.[44] The western part of the town sits on 
the eastern slope of South Mountain (elevation <660 feet (201 m)), leveling 
into a small valley near the central business district. At the top of the 
slope, the western edge of the town runs along the eastern border of South 
Mountain Reservation. South Orange contains the historic Montrose district, 
Newstead, Tuxedo Park, and Wyoming sections.[45] Seton Hall University 
is located in the southeast quadrant of the township.[46] South Orange 
is on the boundary between regions with a humid subtropical and humid continental 
climate. South Orange is a wealthy and relatively diverse township and 
has one of the largest Jewish communities in Essex County, along with nearby 
Livingston and Millburn.[56] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 
16,198 people, 5,516 households, and 3,756 families residing in the township. 
The population density was 5,672.8 per square mile (2,190.3/km2). There 
were 5,815 housing units at an average density of 2,036.5 per square mile 
(786.3/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 60.19% (9,750) White, 
28.66% (4,642) Black or African American, 0.14% (23) Native American, 5.16% 
(836) Asian, 0.01% (1) Pacific Islander, 1.77% (287) from other races, 
and 4.07% (659) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race 
were 6.13% (993) of the population.[9] There were 5,516 households, of 
which 35.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.1% were 
married couples living together, 10.3% had a female householder with no 
husband present, and 31.9% were non-families. 24.3% of all households were 
made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years

age of 18, 15.2% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 27.2% from 45 to 64, 
and 10.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.2 years. 
For every 100 females there were 93.7 males. For every 100 females age 
18 and over, there were 90.4 males.[9] The Census Bureau's 2006-2010 American 
Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median 
household income was $123,373 (with a margin of error of +/- $7,803) and 
the median family income was $147,532 (+/- $9,218). Males had a median 
income of $86,122 (+/- $7,340) versus $71,625 (+/- $9,896) for females. 
The per capita income for the township was $49,607 (+/- $4,022). About 
2.5% of families and 7.8% of the population were below the poverty line, 
including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 4.5% of those age 65 or over.[57] 
As of the 2000 United States Census[18] there were 16,964 people, 5,522 
households, and 3,766 families residing in the township. The population 
density was 5,945.3 people per square mile (2,298.2/km2). There were 5,671 
housing units at an average density of 1,987.5 per square mile (768.3/km2). 
The racial makeup of the township was 60.41% White, 31.30% African American, 
0.09% Native American, 3.89% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.57% from 
other races, and 2.71% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any 
race were 4.93% of the population.[54][55] There were 5,522 households 
out of which 33.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 55.2% 
were married couples living together, 10.0% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 31.8% were non-families. 25.2% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 9.8% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.69 and the average 
family size was 3.26.[54][55] In the township the population was spread 
out with 22.3% under the age of 18, 17.5% from 18 to 24, 26.1% from 25 
to 44, 22.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older. 
The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 92.3 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.1 males.[54][55] The 
median income for a household in the township was $83,611, and the median 
income for a family was $107,641. Males had a median income of $61,809 
versus $42,238 for females. The per capita income for the township was 
$41,035. About 1.9% of families and 5.3% of the population were below the 
poverty line, including 2.6% of those under age 18 and 5.4% of those age 
65 or over.[54][55] The township has a municipal swimming pool open to 
all residents. In most area communities, municipal pool memberships are 
restricted or costly, but the pool in South Orange was built on land willed 
by a wealthy resident to the town for common use and under the terms of 
the deal the pool had to remain inexpensive for the residents. Residents 
may purchase a Photo I.D. badge for an annual fee of $35, which provides 
access to the South Orange Community Pool and full access to all other 
community facilities and programs;[58] non-residents may use the pool for 
a small fee on a per visit basis on a guest pass that must be purchased 
by a resident. The original pool, built in the 1920s, is among the first 
free community pools to be built in the United States, and was replaced 
by an Olympic-size pool in 1972.[59] The South Orange River Greenway is 
currently under construction. The River Greenway will be a promenade for 
bicyclists and pedestrians that will connect part of West Third Street 
in South Orange with West Parker Avenue in Maplewood. Several buildings 
will be removed near the South Orange Department of Public Works facility 
to make way for the River Greenway.[60] The Baird, located in Meadowland 
Park, is the center for the South Orange Department of Recreation and Cultural 
Affairs, housing the department's administrative offices. Most of the department's 
programs are housed in The Baird or in adjoining Meadowland Park. The center 
offers arts programs, including the Pierro Gallery of South Orange, The 
Theater on 3, and other arts spaces, along with preschool and other educational, 
arts and recreational programming.[37] The Baird hosts events together 
with SOPAC, including the long-running Giants of Jazz concert series.[61][62] 
The Pierro Gallery of South Orange, located within The Baird and operating 
as part of the South Orange Department of Recreation and Cultural Affairs, 
encourages community involvement in the visual arts and exhibits the non-commercial 
works of contemporary artists working in the field, in addition to providing 
arts education and serving local artists. Exhibitions often include the 
work of area artists, with a juried "Essex Exposed" exhibition conducted 
twice each year offering materials created by artists from Essex County.[63] 
South Orange Performing Arts Center (SOPAC) is located at 1 SOPAC Way, 
located next to the South Orange station. The performance venue is a 415-seat 
proscenium theater, with a five-screen Clearview Cinemas movie theater, 
and a dance studio/rental space in the same complex.[64] SOPAC presents 
music, family, dance, theater, and comedy programs throughout the year. 
Artists and companies who have performed at SOPAC include Paquito D'Rivera, 
the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Olympia Dukakis, Richie Havens, Yo-Yo Ma, James 
Marsters, Eddie Palmieri, Madeleine Peyroux, Paula Poundstone, Anoushka 
Shankar, Phoebe Snow, Angie Stone, Sweet Honey in the Rock, Dionne Warwick, 
and Nancy Wilson. In partnership with Seton Hall University, SOPAC has 
presented Seton Hall Arts Council events, including a Classical Concert 
Series, Jazz 'n the Hall, and Seton Hall Theatre—student theater productions. 
The plans for SOPAC were first conceived in the mid-1990s as part of an 
effort by the village to develop the downtown area. Seton Hall University 
partnered with SOPAC and construction in August 2004. The complex opened 
in November 2006 to the general public, with Paula Poundstone performing 
at the opening and cellist Yo-Yo Ma performing later that month.[65] Founded 
in 1949, the South Orange Symphony is a full-sized symphony orchestra made 
up of volunteer amateur and semi-professional musicians with a wide range 
of musical backgrounds led by a professional conductor. The ensemble plays 
repertoire that covers the full range of classical literature from the 
18th century to today, and presents three free concerts each year in Sterling 
Hall at the South Orange Middle School.[66] South Orange provides the usual 
facilities for a municipality of this size; fire, police, a library of 
over 90,000 volumes, a municipal pool, a recreation center, parks, baseball 
diamonds, tennis courts, trash and yard waste removal provided by contractors, 
Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV, among others. 
As noted above, the school board is shared with adjacent Maplewood. South 
Orange is governed under a Special Charter granted by the New Jersey Legislature 
by a six-member board of trustees and a village president (equivalent to 
a mayor), all unpaid positions. Trustees are elected in nonpartisan elections 
on an at-large basis to staggered four-year terms of office with three 
trustee seats up for election every two years.[7] Local political parties 
are formed on an ad-hoc basis, generally focused on key issues of local 
concern; national political parties do not officially participate in township 
elections. As of 2016[update], the Village President of South Orange is 
Sheena Collum, whose term of office ends in May 16, 2019.[3] Members of 
the Board of Trustees are Walter Clarke (2017), Jeffrey DuBowy (2017; appointed 
to serve an unexpired term of office), Deborah Davis Ford (2019), Howard 
Levison (2019), Mark Rosner (2019) and Steve Schnall (2017).[67][68][69][70] 
In the May 2015 municipal election, Sheena Collum was elected as Village 
President, making her the first woman to serve in the position, while Deborah 
Davis Ford, Howard Levison and Mark Rosner ran unopposed and won new terms 
of office on the Board of Trustees.[71] In June 2015, Jeffrey DuBowy was 
appointed to fill balance of the term for the seat vacated by Sheena Collum 
expiring 2017 that became vacant after she took office as Village President.[72][73] 
With three incumbents not running for re-election in the May 2013 election, 
the slate of Walter Clarke, Sheena Collum and Stephen Schnall running together 
as South Orange 2013 were elected to four-year terms, with the support 
of Village President Alex Torpey.[74] In the municipal election held in 
May 2011, with fewer than 10% of the registered voters casting ballots, 
23-year-old Alex Torpey was elected as the youngest Village President in 
the history of South Orange by a margin of 14 votes, while trustees Deborah 
Davis Ford, Howard Levison and Mark Rosner were re-elected to four-year 
terms of office, having run unopposed.[3][75][76] In the 2009 elections 
with two incumbents not running for re-election, Michael Goldberg was elected 
to another four-year term, along with newcomers Janine Bauer and Nancy 
Gould, by a nearly 2-1 margin.[77][78] South Orange is located in the 10th 
Congressional District[79] and is part of New Jersey's 27th state legislative 
district.[10][80][81] Prior to the 2010 Census, South Orange had been split 
between the 8th Congressional District and the 10th Congressional District, 
a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect 
in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[82] 
New Jersey's Tenth Congressional District is represented by Donald Payne 
Jr. (D, Newark).[83] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate 
by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[84] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 
2019).[85][86] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 
27th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Richard Codey (D, Roseland) and in the General Assembly 
by Mila Jasey (D, South Orange) and John F. McKeon (D, West Orange).[87] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[88] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[89] 
Essex County is governed by a directly-elected County Executive, with legislative 
functions performed by the Board of Chosen Freeholders.[90] As of 2014[update], 
the County Executive is Joseph N. DiVincenzo, Jr.[91] The county's Board 
of Chosen Freeholders consists of nine members, four elected on an at-large 
basis and one from each of five wards, who serve three-year terms of office 
on a concurrent basis, all of which end December 31, 2014.[90][92][93] 
Essex County's Freeholders are Freeholder President Blonnie R. Watson (at 
large; Newark),[94] Freeholder Vice President Patricia Sebold (at large; 
Livingston),[95] Rufus I. Johnson (at large; Newark),[96] Gerald W. Owens 
(At large; South Orange, filling the vacant seat after the resignation 
of Donald Payne, Jr.)[97] Rolando Bobadilla (District 1 - Newark's North 
and East Wards, parts of Central and West Wards; Newark),[98] D. Bilal 
Beasley (District 2 - Irvington, Maplewood and Newark's South Ward and 
parts of West Ward; Irvington),[99] Carol Y. Clark (District 3 - East Orange, 
Newark's West and Central Wards, Orange and South Orange; East Orange)[100] 
and Leonard M. Luciano (District 4 - Caldwell, Cedar Grove, Essex Fells, 
Fairfield, Livingston, Millburn, North Caldwell, Roseland, Verona, West 
Caldwell and West Orange; West Caldwell),[101] and Brendan W. Gill (District 
5 - Belleville, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge, Montclair and Nutley; Montclair).[102][103][104] 
Constitutional elected countywide are County Clerk Christopher J. Durkin 
(West Caldwell, 2015),[105] Sheriff Armando B. Fontoura (2015)[106] and 
Surrogate Theodore N. Stephens, II (2016).[107][92][108] As of March 23, 
2011, there were a total of 12,266 registered voters in South Orange Village, 
of which 6,536 (53.3%) were registered as Democrats, 969 (7.9%) were registered 
as Republicans and 4,755 (38.8%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There 
were no voters registered to other parties.[109] In the 2012 presidential
