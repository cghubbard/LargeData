Albert Peter "Lefty" Leifield (September 5, 1883 – October 10, 1970), was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher from 1905–1920. He played for the St. Louis 
Browns, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Chicago Cubs. In 1905, Leifield was the 
ace of the Western League's Des Moines Underwriters, winning 26 games to 
help the Underwriters take the pennant. In September, Pittsburgh Pirates 
owner Barney Dreyfuss purchased his contract for $2,500. Leifield pitched 
a shutout in his major league debut. From 1906 to 1911, Leifield stayed 
in the Pittsburgh starting rotation, winning 15 or more games each season. 
In 1909, he went 19-8 to help the Pirates win the National League pennant. 
He was traded to the Chicago Cubs in 1912. On July 4,1906, in the first 
game of a doubleheader at the Pirates Exposition Park, Leifield lost a 
double one-hitter to Mordecai Brown and the Chicago Cubs, 1-0 (1 of only 
5 double one-hitters in major league history, 4 since 1901). Leifield had 
a no-hitter going into the 9th inning but gave up a run on a hit and an 
error. Leifield's own single was the only hit for the Pirates. After being 
released in 1913, Leifield returned home, and then went to San Francisco,
