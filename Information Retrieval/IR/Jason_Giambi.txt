Jason Gilbert Giambi (/dʒiˈɑːmbi/; born January 8, 1971) is an American 
former professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter. In his 
Major League Baseball (MLB) career, which began in 1995, he played for 
the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Colorado Rockies and Cleveland 
Indians. Giambi was the American League MVP in 2000 while with the Athletics, 
and is a five-time All-Star who led the American League in walks four times, 
in on-base percentage three times, and in doubles and in slugging percentage 
once each, and won the Silver Slugger Award twice. He took performance-enhancing 
drugs during his career, for which use he publicly apologized.[1] Giambi 
was named one of the Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by Men's Fitness.[2] 
Giambi attended Sacred Heart Middle School in Pittsburgh. He then attended 
South Hills High School in his native West Covina, where he was a three-sport 
standout. Giambi was on the baseball team, whose roster also included his 
brother Jeremy and three other future Major Leaguers and teammates: infielder 
Shawn Wooten, pitchers Aaron Small and Cory Lidle. He batted .386 during 
his three years of varsity baseball, leading his team to the state finals 
as a senior. He was voted MVP in both baseball and basketball. In American 
football, he was an All-League quarterback. Giambi was selected in the 
43rd round (1,118th overall) by the Milwaukee Brewers during the 1989 MLB 
draft. He did not sign and went on to attend college. Giambi attended Long 
Beach State University, where he played college baseball for the Long Beach 
State 49ers baseball team. Giambi played collegiate summer baseball for 
the Alaska Goldpanners, in the Alaska Baseball League.[citation needed] 
The Oakland Athletics selected Giambi in the second round of the 1992 Major 
League Baseball draft. He started his career that year with the short season 
single A Northwest League's Southern Oregon A's, where he hit .317 in 13 
games. He was a member of the fourth place United States national baseball 
team at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The Athletics invited Giambi to 
spring training in 1993.[3] He then spent the 1993 season playing for the 
Modesto A's, the Oakland Athletics' single A farm team. Giambi also played 
for the Huntsville Stars in the Southern League. Giambi made his major 
league debut with the Athletics in 1995. Originally used occasionally as 
an outfielder, third baseman, and first baseman, Giambi assumed the full-time 
first base job upon the trade of Mark McGwire to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1997. Giambi led the team in 1998 with 27 home runs, 110 runs batted 
ins and a .295 batting average. In 1999, Giambi hit .315 with 33 homers, 
105 walks (2nd in the league), and 123 RBIs (6th). He came in 8th in MLB 
Most Valuable Player Award voting. In the 2000 season he led the league 
in on-base percentage (.476; leading the majors) and walks (137; a personal 
high and still the most walks in the AL since 1991). He hit .333 (7th in 
the league) with 43 homers (2nd; a career high), 137 RBIs (4th; a career 
high), 108 runs (10th), and a .647 slugging percentage (3rd). Giambi narrowly 
won the American League Most Valuable Player Award over Frank Thomas. His 
2001 season was nearly identical. He led the league for the second year 
in a row in both on-base percentage (.477; a career best, and still the 
highest OBP in the AL since 1995) and walks (129). He also led the league 
in slugging percentage (.660; a career best), doubles (47; a career high), 
times on base (320), and extra base hits (87). He batted .342 (2nd in the 
American League; a career high) with 38 homers (7th), 109 runs (6th), and 
120 RBIs (8th). He was second in the league in intentional walks (24), 
the only time in his career that he was in the top 10 in this category. 
He finished a close second in MVP voting to Ichiro Suzuki, and won the 
Silver Slugger Award. Both years, he led the Athletics to the post-season, 
both times losing in the American League Division Series to the New York 
Yankees in five games. On December 13, 2001, Giambi signed a 7-year $120-million 
deal with the New York Yankees. In line with Yankee team rules, Giambi 
cut his long hair and shaved his goatee.[4] The signing upset many Athletics 
fans, who felt betrayed by the departure of their team leader. Giambi became 
an object of the A's fans' wrath whenever New York visited Oakland. During 
a game on May 14, 2005, he was hit with a beer thrown by an unruly fan 
on his way back to the dugout.[5] Giambi continued slugging with New York 
in 2002. He led the league for the 2nd consecutive year in times on base 
(300), had 109 walks (2nd), was 3rd in the league with both a .435 obp 
and 15 HBP, had 41 home runs (4th), 120 runs (4th; a career high), and 
a .598 slugging percentage (4th), knocked in 122 runs (5th), and batted 
.314 (6th). He came in 5th in AL MVP voting, and again won the Silver Slugger 
Award. He also hit an "ultimate grand slam"—a walk-off grand slam against 
the Twins in a rain-soaked extra-inning game, that won that game 13–12. 
Although his average dipped to .250 in 2003, he led the league in walks 
(129) for the 3rd time in his career and in HBP (21) and percent of plate 
appearances that were walks (19.4%),[6] maintained an extremely high on-base 
percentage (.412; 3rd in the league), hit 41 home runs (4th), and had 107 
RBIs (8th). He was also second in the major leagues in fly ball percentage 
(52.0%).[7] He remained one of the most patient hitters in the majors. 
At the same time, he also led the league in strikeouts (140), the only 
season that he has even been in the top 10 in the league in that category. 
On July 30, 2004, test results confirmed that Giambi had a benign tumor, 
which placed him on the disabled list. He was treated for the tumor, and 
returned to the team and played in a game on September 14. That year, Giambi 
was voted in as the starting first baseman in the 2004 MLB All-Star Game 
despite finishing the year with a .208 batting average and just 12 home 
runs. Towards the middle of the 2005 season, Giambi saw a resurgence in 
his career. On July 31, he hit his 300th career home run off of Esteban 
Yan of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. This was his 14th home run of 
the month, tying Mickey Mantle for the Yankee record for home runs in July.[8] 
Giambi ended the 2005 season leading the major leagues in walk percentage 
(20.6%)[9] and leading the American League in walks for the 4th time in 
his career (109), and in OBP for the 3rd time in his career (.440, as well 
as in fly ball percentage (47.7%);[10] second in MLB to Todd Helton), and 
had an OPS of .975, placing him 5th in the AL. He hit 32 homers (10th in 
the league), the 7th time in his career in which he has hit 30 or more, 
and was 4th in HBP (19) and at-bats per home run (13.0). Giambi was named 
the AL Comeback Player of the Year. In 2006, Giambi was named the American 
League Player of the Month for April, hitting .344 with 9 home runs and 
driving in 27 runs. However, he was left off the 2006 American League All-Star 
roster. He finished the season leading the majors in walk percentage (19.8%)[11] 
and leading the league in % Pitches Taken (64.4), 2nd in walks (110), hbp 
(16), and pitches seen per PA (4.37), 5th in at bats per home run (12.1), 
6th in on-base percentage (.416), 7th in home runs (37) and slugging percentage 
(.558), 8th in intentional walks (12), and 9th in RBIs (113), despite playing 
in only 139 games (half of them at DH, and half at 1B) for the 2nd year 
in a row. He performed the unusual feat of having as many RBIs as hits, 
and for the 3rd time in his career had more walks than strikeouts. Giambi's 
numbers were down precipitously in the 2007 season due to an injury, in 
which he hit just .236 with 14 home runs and 39 RBIs. He played in just 
83 games, 53 of which as a designated hitter. Giambi got off to a horrible 
start in the 2008 season, hitting below .200 for more than a month. However, 
by June he had turned his season around and become one of the team's most 
productive players. On September 3, 2008, Giambi walked into a bathroom 
door in his hotel room while in Florida before playing against the Tampa 
Bay Rays. The accident caused him to split his eyelid open but he played 
through the injury later that night and went one for four with one RBI, 
helping the Yankees win game 2 of the series.[12] On September 21, 2008, 
Giambi recorded the final hit in Yankee Stadium, when he drove in Brett 
Gardner with an RBI single. Giambi ended the season with a home run every 
14.3 at-bats, beating out Alex Rodriguez to lead the team by a small margin. 
He was also one of only three players to hit a home run while pinch hitting 
in 2008, and the only one to do it twice.[13] However, on November 4, 2008, 
the Yankees declined their option on Giambi for the 2009 season making 
him a free agent.[14] On January 6, 2009, Giambi agreed to sign with the 
Oakland Athletics.[15] He officially re-joined the A's the next day, and 
was given his old No. 16 jersey.[16] Giambi hit his first home run since 
returning to the Athletics on April 25, 2009.[17] On May 23, 2009, Giambi 
hit his 400th career home run in an 8–7 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
He was placed on the disabled list on July 20. At the time he had the lowest 
batting average in the majors, and 4th-lowest slugging percentage in the 
American League. On August 7, 2009, he was released by the A's.[18] Looking 
for a veteran bat to help their playoff push, the Rockies agreed to a deal 
with Giambi on August 23, 2009. He was assigned to their AAA affiliate, 
the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Giambi chose to wear the number 23 for his 
jersey's number. His first RBI with the Rockies came in the form of a bases 
loaded walk in his first plate appearance on September 1, 2009,[19] after 
being promoted to the club upon roster expansion earlier that day. That 
year he had many clutch hits which kept the Rockies in contention for the 
National League Wild Card. He quickly became a fan favorite in Colorado.[20] 
On January 23, 2010, Giambi reached an agreement to return to the Colorado 
Rockies. On September 12 Giambi hit a walk-off home run against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks, extending the winning streak for the Rockies to 10 games. 
The Colorado Rockies announced on January 17, 2011 a deal to put Giambi 
in the team's minor league organization with a spring training invite for 
the 2011 season. Giambi made the 2011 Opening Day roster out of spring 
training.[21] On May 19, 2011, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Giambi 
hit three home runs in one game, the first such game for him of his career. 
The three home runs came in his first three at-bats. Giambi is also the 
second oldest player to accomplish the feat; at age 41, Stan Musial was 
the oldest player to hit three home runs in one game on July 8, 1962.[22] 
Giambi became a free agent after the 2012 season and was a finalist for 
the Rockies major league managerial opening, which eventually went to Walt 
Weiss. Giambi was offered the position of Colorado's hitting coach but 
turned it down. [23] The Cleveland Indians signed Giambi to a minor league 
contract on February 9, 2013.[24] Giambi made the Indians major league 
roster following spring training.[25] On July 29, 2013, Giambi became the 
oldest player to hit a walk-off home run.[26] He broke his own record for 
oldest player to hit a walk-off home run in a season saving win for the 
Indians against the White Sox on September 24, 2013.[27] Giambi was re-signed 
by the Indians on October 31, 2013 to a one-year minor league deal. The 
deal includes an invitation to Spring training. Giambi was hit by an Edwin 
Jackson pitch on March 7, 2014. This resulted in a broken rib, and Giambi 
missed the first 18 games of the season.[28] He was activated on April 
21.[29] On August 2, 2014 Giambi gave up his 25 jersey number to Jim Thome 
to have it unofficially retired by the Indians, Giambi switched his jersey 
number to 72 that day. On the jersey that he gave to Thome, Giambi put 
down a message to Thome saying " Jim, It was an honor to be the last person 
to wear your uniform number in Cleveland Indians history! – Jason Giambi" 
It was kept a secret from the fans, the players, Thome himself and his 
family, happening after Thome signed the 1-day contract and threw out the 
1st pitch. On February 16, 2015, Giambi announced his retirement.[30] Late 
in 2003, Giambi was named by FBI officers investigating the Bay Area Laboratory 
Co-operative (BALCO) as being one of the baseball players believed to have 
received anabolic steroids from trainer Greg Anderson.[31] In December 
2004, the San Francisco Chronicle reported it had seen Giambi's 2003 grand 
jury testimony in the BALCO investigation. The newspaper said that in his 
testimony, Giambi admitted to using several different steroids during the 
off-seasons from 2001 to 2003, and injecting himself with human growth 
hormone during the 2003 season.[32] In a press conference prior to the 
2005 season, Giambi apologized publicly to the media and his fans, though 
he did not specifically state what for. The lawyer who illegally leaked 
the testimony later pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 2 and a half years 
in prison.[33] Giambi apologized again on May 16, 2007, this time specifically 
for using steroids, and urged others in the sport to do the same.[34] "I 
was wrong for using that stuff", he told USA Today. "What we should have 
done a long time ago was stand up—players, ownership, everybody—and said, 
'We made a mistake.'" When asked why he used steroids, Giambi responded: 
"Maybe one day I'll talk about it, but not now." Giambi did speak with 
George J. Mitchell, after being forced to do so by Bud Selig. Subsequently, 
in December 2007, the Mitchell Report included Giambi along with his brother 
Jeremy Giambi, who also admitted to using steroids during his career.[35] 
The prosecution in the Barry Bonds perjury case indicated they intended 
to call both Jason and Jeremy Giambi to testify against Bonds in his March 
2009 trial.[36] Giambi married Kristian on February 2, 2002. His wife is 
the designer and owner of a lingerie and loungewear company called Brulee. 
Giambi is one of the owners of Casa Cielo (also owned by Scott Deskins 
of SCC Development in Austin, Texas) in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It is an 
18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) home on top of the Pedregal sign. He has 
a brother, former major-leaguer Jeremy Giambi, and a sister named Julie. 
He makes his home in Henderson, Nevada. Giambi has appeared as the featured 
athlete on the cover of several video games throughout his career. Giambi 
has also been featured as a playable character in Backyard Baseball 2001
