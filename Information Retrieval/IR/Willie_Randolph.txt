As player As manager As coach As player As coach Willie Larry Randolph 
(born July 6, 1954) is an American former Major League Baseball second 
baseman and manager. During an 18-year baseball career, he played from 
1975 to 1992 for six different teams, most notably the New York Yankees 
where he won back to back world titles against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
He has joined ESPN as a postseason baseball analyst, beginning in September 
2013. He will mainly be on Baseball Tonight, and provide updates during 
Monday and Wednesday night September network telecasts. At the end of his 
playing career, he ranked fifth in major league history in games at second 
base (2,152), ninth in putouts (4,859), seventh in assists (6,336), eighth 
in total chances (11,429), and third in double plays (1,547). Upon retiring 
as a player, he joined the Yankees as a coach for eleven years. He later 
served as manager of the New York Mets from 2005 to June 2008. Randolph 
grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Samuel J. Tilden High 
School, where he was a star athlete and was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in the 7th round of the 1972 draft. He made his major league debut in 1975, 
and was, at age 21, the sixth-youngest player in the National League. In 
December 1975 he was traded by the Pirates with Ken Brett and Dock Ellis 
to the Yankees for Doc Medich.[1] Randolph spent 13 of his 18 seasons as 
a player with the Yankees and was co-captain of the Yankees with Ron Guidry 
from 1986 to 1988. He later played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1989–90), 
Oakland Athletics (1990), and Milwaukee Brewers (1991), finishing his career 
with the New York Mets in 1992. He was selected to six All-Star teams over 
his career. As a career number 2 hitter in the order, he made use of his 
skills as bunter and a patient hitter who drew more than 80 walks seven 
times. Randolph was also an outstanding defensive player, known especially 
for his ability to turn the double play. However, he never received the 
Gold Glove Award, which was perennially awarded to his equally sure-handed 
and more acrobatic and wide-ranging contemporaries: Frank White of the 
Kansas City Royals and Lou Whitaker of the Detroit Tigers. He was the Yankees' 
starting second baseman on the 1977 and 1978 World Series Championship 
teams. In 1980 Randolph led the league in walks (119) and was second in 
the AL in on-base percentage (.427), eighth in stolen bases (30) and ninth 
in runs (99), and won the Silver Slugger Award at second base in the AL. 
He also batted .332 leading off the inning, and .340 with men in scoring 
position. In 1987 he batted .305 and led the league in at bats per strikeout 
(18.0), and was fourth in the AL in OBP (.411) and ninth in walks (82). 
He also batted .366 in tie games, and .345 in games that were late and 
close. In December 1988 he signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Randolph led the Dodgers in battling average and hits in 1989, 
making his sixth All-Star team. In May 1990 he was traded by the Dodgers 
to the defending-world champion Oakland Athletics for Stan Javier. Later 
that year, Randolph and the A's won the American League pennant, but were 
swept by the NL-champion Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. In April 
1991 he signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. That year, Randolph 
was second in the AL on-base percentage (.424) and third in batting average 
(.327). He batted .373 with runners in scoring position. In December 1991 
he signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1992, at 37 years 
old he was the eighth-oldest player in the NL. In his last career game 
with the Mets, the team's second baseman of the future Jeff Kent moved 
to make his start at shortstop to allow Randolph to play his final game 
at second base.[citation needed] Randolph was a Yankees base and bench 
coach for 11 seasons, interviewing intermittently for managing jobs with 
other teams. In 2004, Randolph was named Mets manager for the 2005 season, 
despite never having managed before at any level of baseball. He became 
the eighth person to play for and later manage the Mets, joining Gil Hodges, 
Yogi Berra, Joe Torre, Bud Harrelson, Roy McMillan, Dallas Green, and Bobby 
Valentine (as well as interim manager Mike Cubbage).[2] Randolph earned 
his first win as a manager on April 10, 2005, defeating the Atlanta Braves 
2–1.[3] The win halted a five-game losing streak to start the 2005 season. 
He then guided the Mets to five straight additional victories, giving the 
Mets their first six-game winning streak since August 2003. Randolph ended 
his first season as manager of the 2005 Mets with an 83–79 record, the 
first time the franchise had finished above .500 since 2001, and 12 games 
better than the prior season. That record got them a tie for third place 
in the National League East. In 2006, Randolph managed the Mets to a league-best 
97–65 record (which also tied for the best record in the majors with the 
crosstown Yankees) and the NL East Division title (the team's first division 
championship since 1988). The Mets came within one game of reaching the 
World Series, losing the seventh game of the NL Championship Series to 
the eventual world champion St. Louis Cardinals. Randolph was the first 
manager in major league history to have his team's record improve by at 
least 12 games in each of his first two seasons (excluding seasons following 
strike-shortened seasons). He came in second place in the 2006 NL Manager 
of the Year voting, losing to Florida Marlins manager Joe Girardi. On January 
24, 2007, Randolph signed a three-year, $5.65 million contract extension 
with the Mets. He had a club option for 2010 worth an additional $2.5 million.[4] 
In 2007, Randolph was managing the Mets when they had one of the worst 
collapses in major league history. Holding a seven-game first-place lead 
in the NL East with only 17 games to play, the Mets finished 5–12 and lost 
the division to the Philadelphia Phillies, who went 13–4 in the same timespan.[5] 
In 2008, Randolph's job security steadily decreased after a disappointing 
start to the season and inconsistent performance through mid-June. On June 
17, 2008, less than two hours after the Mets' 9–6 road victory over the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Randolph was fired, along with pitching 
coach Rick Peterson and first base coach Tom Nieto. He and his coaches 
were replaced by interim manager Jerry Manuel and coaches Ken Oberkfell, 
Dan Warthen, and Luis Aguayo.[6] The team's record at the time of the firing 
was 34–35, which was 6½ games behind the Phillies in the National League 
East. After 2008, the Mets did not have another winning season until 2015. 
After the 2008 season, Randolph was interviewed by the Milwaukee Brewers 
for their managerial position. Although he was one of the three finalists, 
the job ultimately went to Ken Macha, and Randolph was given the bench 
coach position, which he held until November 2010.[7] According to Brewers 
GM Doug Melvin, Randolph was asked to be Macha's bench coach because Randolph 
had experience managing against National League teams, versus Macha's American 
League experience. On November 23, 2010, Randolph was named as the final 
piece to Buck Showalter's coaching staff for the 2011 Baltimore Orioles. 
Randolph assumed the position of bench coach replacing Jeff Datz.[8][9] 
In June 2011, Randolph switched places with John Russell, becoming Baltimore's 
third-base coach. Randolph and the Orioles parted ways after the 2011 season. 
On November 26, 2012, it was announced Randolph would be the third base 
coach in the World Baseball Classic for Team USA.[10] On February 16, 2015, 
the Yankees announced that they would honor Randolph with a plaque in Monument 
Park on June 20, 2015.[11] On October 21, 2015, Randolph was named as the 
manager of Team USA for the inaugural 2015 WBSC Premier12.[12] Randolph 
currently resides in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey with his wife Gretchen.[13] 
He has four children in their 20s named Taniesha, Chantre, Andre, and Ciara 
Randolph delivered the commencement address to Fordham University's 2007 
graduating class, of which his daughter Ciara was a member. That same day, 
he managed the second game in a three-game series against the Yankees.[14]
