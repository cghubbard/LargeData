The Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is 
the award given annually to the Major League Baseball players judged to 
have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding 
position in both the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), 
as voted by the managers and coaches in each league.[1] Managers are not 
permitted to vote for their own players.[1] Additionally, a sabermetric 
component provided by Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) accounts 
for approximately 25 percent of the vote.[2] Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded 
each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the 
nine positions in each league. In 1957, the baseball glove manufacturer 
Rawlings created the Gold Glove Award to commemorate the best fielding 
performance at each position.[3] The award was created from a glove made 
from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base.[4] Initially, 
only one Gold Glove per position was awarded to the top fielder at each 
position in Major League Baseball;[3] however, separate awards were given 
for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.[5][6] For the 
first four seasons of the award (1957 to 1960), individual awards were 
presented to left fielders, center fielders, and right fielders. From 1961 
through 2010, the phrase "at each position" was no longer strictly accurate, 
since the prize was presented to three outfielders irrespective of their 
specific position.[7] Any combination of outfielders, often three center 
fielders, could win the award in the same year.[8][9] Critics called for 
awarding a single Gold Glove for each individual outfield position, arguing 
that the three outfield positions are not equivalent defensively.[9] Starting 
in 2011, separate awards for each outfield position were once again presented.[8] 
In the 1985 American League voting, a tie for third-place resulted in the 
presentation of Gold Glove Awards to four outfielders (Dwayne Murphy, Gary 
Pettis, Dwight Evans and Dave Winfield); this scenario was repeated in 
the National League in 2007 (Andruw Jones, Carlos Beltrán, Aaron Rowand, 
and Jeff Francoeur). Before SABR's involvement in the voting process, The 
Boston Globe writer Peter Abraham said the Fielding Bible Awards "are far 
more accurate (and accountable)" than the Gold Glove awards since statistics 
are used along with the opinions of an expert panel. The Gold Gloves are 
selected by managers and coaches that may have seen a player as few as 
six times during the season.[10] Bill Chuck of Comcast SportsNet New England 
wrote that Gold Glove voters frequently counted only errors to determine 
winners.[11] Geoff Baker of The Seattle Times said the votes for the Gold 
Gloves rely largely on a player's past reputation.[12] The Associated Press 
wrote that "some fans have viewed the Gold Gloves as mostly a popularity 
contest, even suggesting that a player's performance at the plate helped 
draw extra attention to his glove."[13] After winning the AL Gold Glove 
at first base in both 1997 and 1998, Rafael Palmeiro won again in 1999 
with the Texas Rangers while only appearing in 28 games as a first baseman; 
he played in 128 games as a designated hitter that season, resulting in 
a controversy.[11][14][15][16] Derek Jeter, winner of five Gold Gloves, 
believes that many defensive factors cannot be quantified.[17] In 2013, 
Rawlings collaborated on the Gold Glove Award with SABR, who provided the 
SABR Defensive Index (SDI) to add a sabermetric component to the selection 
process. The index accounted for 25 percent of the vote, while managers 
and coaches continued to provide the majority.[2] Afterwards, Jay Jaffe 
of Sports Illustrated wrote that the Gold Gloves "appear to have significantly 
closed the gap on their more statistically-driven counterparts."[18] SABR 
and FiveThirtyEight believed that the impact to the voting results by SDI, 
which is also included on the voters' ballots, went beyond its 25 own percent 
weight and also influenced the managers' and coaches' voting.[19] The most 
Gold Gloves ever won by one player is 18 by pitcher Greg Maddux. He won 
13 consecutive awards from 1990 to 2002, all in the National League.[20] 
Brooks Robinson has the most wins as a third baseman, with 16 Gold Gloves,[21] 
and is tied for the second-highest total overall with pitcher Jim Kaat, 
who won his 16 awards consecutively.[22] Iván Rodríguez has won the most 
Gold Gloves as a catcher, with 13 career awards in the American League.[23] 
Ozzie Smith has 13 wins at shortstop; he and Rodríguez are tied for the 
fourth-highest total among all winners.[24] Among outfielders, Roberto 
Clemente and Willie Mays, who played primarily right field and center field, 
respectively, are tied for the lead with 12 Gold Gloves.[25][26] Keith 
Hernandez, the leader at first base, has won 11 times,[27] and Roberto 
Alomar leads second basemen with 10 wins.[28] Other players with 10 or 
more wins include shortstop Omar Vizquel (11),[29] catcher Johnny Bench 
(10),[30] third baseman Mike Schmidt (10),[31] and outfielders Ken Griffey 
Jr., Ichiro Suzuki, Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline (10 each).[32][33][34][35] 
The only player to win Gold Gloves as an infielder and outfielder is Darin 
Erstad, who won Gold Gloves as an outfielder in 2000 and 2002 and as a 
first baseman in 2004, all with the Anaheim Angels.[36] The only other 
player to win Gold Gloves at multiple positions is Plácido Polanco, who 
won at second base (2007, 2009 AL) and third base (2011 NL).[37] Family 
pairs to win Gold Gloves include brothers Ken and Clete Boyer (third base),[38][39] 
brothers Sandy Alomar, Jr. (catcher) and Roberto Alomar (second base),[28] 
Bengie and Yadier Molina (catcher),[40][41] father and son Bobby and Barry 
Bonds (outfield),[42][43] and father and son Bob (catcher) and Bret Boone 
(second base).[44][45] In 2016, Rawlings announced it would begin awarding 
a gold glove annually to a female fastpitch softball player in the National 
Pro Fastpitch league. NPF coaches and managers vote for a winner (excluding 
those on their respective teams). This award is in addition to the collegiate 
and high school awards added in 2007, its 50th anniversary.[46] On February 
20, 2007, Major League Baseball and Rawlings announced that an all-time 
Gold Glove Team would be named during the 50th anniversary of the first 
Gold Glove Awards.[47] Rawlings asked 70 baseball reporters, former players 
and former managers to select 50 names for the ballot, from an initial 
selection of 250 names.[48] The team was selected by fans, who voted at 
the Rawlings Gold Glove website, at United States Postal Service offices, 
and at sporting goods stores. The results were announced at the 2007 Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game.[49] In the history of the Gold Glove Award, 
there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders,[50] 
that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend 
upon each other for the majority of double plays. The most common type 
of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit 
towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally 
the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second 
base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force 
that runner out, and then throws the ball to the first baseman to force 
out the batter for the second out.[51] Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves 
with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe 
Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati 
Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford 
and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016. Since 1957, 
there have been five Gold Glove batteries. The pitcher and catcher, collectively 
known as the battery, are the only two players on the field involved in 
every pitch. In particular, the pitcher and catcher control the running 
game with tools such as pickoffs or the strength of the catcher's throwing 
arm.[75] The first pitcher and catcher on the same team to win Gold Gloves 
in the same year were Jim Kaat and Earl Battey, with the Minnesota Twins 
in 1962. Only two pairs of batterymates have won Gold Gloves together more 
than once: Iván Rodríguez and Kenny Rogers won with the Texas Rangers in 
2000, and again with the Detroit Tigers in 2004 and 2006. Yadier Molina 
and Adam Wainwright matched the feat, winning in both 2009 and 2013. In 
2011, Rawlings added an annual Platinum Glove Award awarded to the best
