The Ligue de Baseball Senior Majeur du Québec (LBMQ) is a semi-professional 
summer baseball league in the Canadian province of Quebec. It is the highest 
level of non-professional baseball in the province of Quebec. The league 
is the result of the 2002 amalgamation of several men's senior elite level 
baseball teams in the province of Quebec. The league from Montreal, the 
Ligue de Baseball Senior de Montréal, merged with those of the Quebec City 
and Trois-Rivières areas. There were originally ten teams, five from the 
Montreal area, four from Quebec City and one from Trois-Rivières. A year 
later, the senior-level league teams from the Estrie and Bas-Saint-Laurent 
leagues joined bringing the total up to 15. In 2009, the league became 
the sole senior elite baseball league in Quebec when the Ligue de Baseball 
Senior Majeur du Québec folded, and its four teams joined the LBEQ.[1] 
In 2004, the LBSEQ became the first in Quebec to use wooden baseball bats 
exclusively. Other competitive levels of play in Quebec have since followed 
suit (senior, junior and midget).[1] In its seven years of existence, the 
LBSEQ has represented Quebec in the Baseball Canada Senior Men's Championship 
each year and has earned four medals. These were a bronze in 2002, a gold 
in 2003, a bronze in 2004 and a silver in 2008.[1] The LBSEQ a well traveled 
league has also participated in various tournaments outside of Quebec. 
In 2008, they played in the 4 Nations Cup in Liège against professional 
teams from Belgium and England. In 2009, the LBSEQ participated in a tournament 
in Rouen, France hosted by the local team Les Huskies (Rouen, France) along
