The Long Beach State 49ers are the athletic teams that represent California 
State University, Long Beach. The 49ers compete in 19 sports teams and 
compete in NCAA Division I. Long Beach State is a founding member of the 
Big West Conference, and also competes in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation 
for sports not sponsored by the Big West. In the realm of sports the school 
is referred to as "Long Beach State." The official name of Long Beach State 
sports teams is "The 49ers" in honor of the year the university was founded 
and for the prospectors of the California Gold Rush one hundred years before 
then. Unofficially, "The Beach" is used to refer to Long Beach State and 
its sports teams as it is the only university on the West Coast with the 
word "Beach" in its name. One can see the cheer "Go Beach!" written on 
many CSULB products around campus and on the large water tower near the 
entrance to the campus. The school colors have been black and gold since 
2000, when they were changed by a student referendum (after George Allen 
changed the football uniform colors) from the original brown and gold.[2] 
Long Beach State sponsors teams in eight men's and eleven women's NCAA 
sanctioned sports:[3] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate 
Sports As of July 2, 2015, Long Beach State has won 4 NCAA national team 
championships.[4] Below are six national championships that were not bestowed 
by the NCAA. Below are five national club team championships won at the 
highest collegiate level. The Beach has several rival schools when it comes 
to sports. In addition to being located in close proximity to each other, 
Long Beach State and CSUF have competed heavily as conference rivals in 
baseball more than 20 years. More recently, specifically since 2006, Long 
Beach State and UC Irvine have participated in the annual "Black and Blue 
Rivalry Series." In this challenge, each school earns points for its collective 
conference championships and head-to-head victories against each other 
(across all NCAA sports in which both schools participate). The totals 
are added up at the end of the season and a winner is declared. Both schools 
are currently tied 2-2. Finally, Long Beach State also has a long-standing 
"beach school" rivalry with UC Santa Barbara. Unlike all other Long Beach 
State sports teams, the baseball team unofficially goes under the moniker 
"The Dirtbags." After the hiring of Dave Snow as head coach in 1989, the 
LBSU baseball team has become one of the most successful teams in the school's 
athletic history. The Dirtbags are consistently ranked in the national 
top 35 and have appeared in 17 of the last 20 NCAA tournaments. Along the 
way, the team has won 9 Big West conference championships, hosted 4 NCAA 
regionals (plus 1 super regional), and appeared in 4 College World Series 
(1989, 1991, 1993 and 1998).[5] The Dirtbags nickname referred to a gritty, 
team first style of play taught by Coach Snow and subsequent coaches. Mike 
Weathers became 'Dirtbag' head coach in 2001. Upon Weather's retirement, 
he was succeeded by assistant Troy Buckley in 2010. The school has also 
produced a number of prominent professional players over the years, including 
former American League MVP Jason Giambi, former American League Rookie 
of the Year Bobby Crosby, and all-star and 2008 American League Rookie 
of the Year Evan Longoria. Many more ex-Dirtbags have participated in the 
prestigious MLB All-Star Futures game, such as rookie phenomenons Jered 
Weaver, Troy Tulowitzki and Danny Espinosa. Nine Long Beach State baseball 
alumni were playing in the big leagues during 2013.[6] The baseball team 
plays off campus at Blair Field in Recreation Park (center of city; 1.7 
miles off campus). Opened in 1956 and remodeled in 2002, Blair Field has 
been the full-time Long Beach State home field since 2003. The stadium 
seats 2,800 and has been seen frequently in movies, TV shows and commercials 
for generations. The site of a baseball field since Connie Mack had the 
Philadelphia A's trained there in the 1920s, virtually every high school, 
American Legion, Connie Mack and collegiate baseball play from the Long 
Beach/Lakewood area has played at the corner of 10th Street and Park Avenue 
for 90 years. The CSULB men's basketball team has also enjoyed success 
in recent times. In the 2006-07 season, the 49ers finished with a 24-8 
(12-2) record, the Big West conference championship, and the school's first 
trip to the NCAA tournament in 12 years. Star guard Aaron Nixon was named 
Big West player of the year, as well as being selected as an AP Honorable 
Mention All-American. On April 6, 2007, it was announced that Dan Monson 
(formerly of Gonzaga University and the University of Minnesota) would 
become Long Beach State's next head Men's Basketball Coach, succeeding 
Larry Reynolds. The women's basketball team had its greatest success during 
the 1980s when coached by Joan Bonvicini for 12 years. During that time 
the team went 325-71. The 49ers won 10 Big West Conference titles, made 
10 straight NCAA appearances, had 12 consecutive winning seasons, and never 
won fewer than 24 games in a season. Bonvicini guided the 49ers to Final 
Four appearances in 1987 and 1988. James Ennis played his freshman season 
at Oxnard College, a junior college in Oxnard, California, and his sophomore 
season at Ventura College, a junior college in Ventura, California. In 
2011, he signed with Long Beach State, where he became a two-year starter. 
As a junior, Ennis averaged 10 points and 4.1 rebounds per game and helped 
lead the 49ers to Big West Conference regular season and conference titles. 
Ennis was named honorable mention all-conference at the close of the season. 
With the departure of conference player of the year Casper Ware, Ennis 
became the go to player for the 49ers in 2012–13. He responded by averaging 
16.5 points and 6.7 rebounds per game and leading the 49ers to another 
regular season Big West championship. At the end of the season, Ennis was 
named Big West Player of the Year and an AP honorable mention All-American. 
Following the close of his senior year, Ennis was named to the Reese's 
College All-Star Game, where he led the East team in scoring with 13 points, 
including a pair of baskets that clinched the game. Long Beach State competed 
in Division I football for a number of years (1969–91), producing a number 
of professional players, including Terrell Davis and Mike Horan, among 
others. George Allen, the famed Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins 
coach, had a short one-year tenure at Long Beach State. Long Beach State 
discontinued its football program after the 1991 season due to budget constraints. 
Prior to going Division I in 1969 the football team competed in the old 
"College Division" of the NCAA from 1955 through 1968. Long Beach State 
women's tennis team ('Beach Tennis') won the first of a conference record 
12 consecutive Big West tennis titles in 2002 to reach their first NCAA 
tournament. The team has appeared in the conference title match every year 
since 2001. The 2014 team went undefeated in league play and then captured 
an 11th Big West tournament championship by reaching a record fourteenth 
consecutive conference final and then defeating rival UC Irvine for an 
tenth time in the championship match. 'Beach Tennis' has qualified for

is named after 49er alumnus Terry Rhodes following his $1.25 million gift 
to the women's tennis program. Mr. Rhodes' gift is the largest single sport

was founded in the fall semester of 1957, and continues to be one of the 
oldest, continuous, collegiate sports on campus. The team is currently 
run through the office of Club Sports & Recreation, but has been a part 
of the CSULB athletic department in past years. An attempt to bring the 
sport back into the athletic department failed in 2008 when the Beach Legacy 
Referendum was voted down by students. Beach Crew rows in Marine Stadium 
and Alamitos Bay of Long Beach. The team operates two boat bays of the 
Pete Archer Rowing Center, which is about 5 blocks south of the CSULB campus. 
The team was co-founded by Bill Lockyer, a local businessman of Long Beach, 
and Dr. Ludwig Spolyar, a campus activities adviser. Lockyer, who coached 
for over a decade, was succeeded by Ed Graham in 1970. Spolyar was appointed 
the duty to gather students from campus who expressed interest in the sport. 
Spolyar became the de facto coach in the 1956 season. After a successful 
run with UCLA and Orange Coast College, the team was officially founded 
the next year. The team's first racing shell was donated by Orange Coast 
College and the first set of oars by UCLA. A women's team was formed in 
1973 by coach Stephen Buchan and has continued since then. Beach Crew is 
a member of the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association (WIRA), whose 
participants are mostly non-Pac-10 schools on the West Coast. The team 
is a founding member of the American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA), 
the national collegiate organization whose members are not eligible to 
compete in the National NCAA Championships or the Intercollegiate Rowing 
Association Championships. The team is currently coached by Robert Edwards, 
Jonathan Flietstra, Ian Simpson, and Megan Smith.[11] The team has an active
