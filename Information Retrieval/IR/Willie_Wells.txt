Negro leagues Mexican League As Manager Willie James Wells (August 10, 
1906[1] â€“ January 22, 1989), nicknamed "The Devil," was an American baseball 
player. He was a shortstop who played from 1924-48 for various teams in 
the Negro leagues and in Latin America. Wells was a fast baserunner who 
hit for both power and average. He was at his finest with his glove, committing 
almost no errors and having the speed to run down anything that came in 
his direction. He is widely considered the best black shortstop of his 
day. He also taught Jackie Robinson how to turn a double play.[2] Wells 
was also notable as being the first player to use a batting helmet, after 
being hit and getting a concussion while playing with the Newark Eagles. 
(His first helmet was a construction helmet.) He is a member of the baseball 
halls of fame in the United States, Cuba and Mexico. Wells was born in 
Austin, Texas. He attended Anderson High School in Austin. Wells first 
played professional baseball in 1923, playing one season for the Austin 
Black Senators of the Texas Negro League, a minor league for the Negro 
National League.[2] He briefly attended Samuel Huston College in Austin 
before he was called up to the St. Louis team in the NNL. He entered the 
NNL with the St. Louis Stars in 1924, playing for the Stars until the franchise 
dissolved after the 1931 season. In 1926 he hit 27 home runs, a Negro League 
single-season record. From 1932 to 1935 he played for the Chicago American 
Giants and played for the Newark Eagles from 1936 to 1939. While a player 
with the Eagles, Wells was part of the "Million Dollar Infield," consisting 
of Wells, Ray Dandridge, Dick Seay, and Mule Suttles.[3]:p.55 He played 
in Mexico in 1940 and 1941, where he said that he experienced democracy, 
acceptance and freedom. Wells was nicknamed El Diablo by Mexican fans for 
his extraordinary intensity and the English translation ("The Devil") followed 
him as a nickname in the United States.[2] He returned to the Negro Leagues 
in 1942 as a player-manager for the Eagles and then went back to Mexico 
for the 1943 and 1944 seasons. Returning to the U.S. in 1945, Wells played 
for various Negro league teams through the 1950 season. He then went to 
Canada as a player-manager for the Winnipeg Buffaloes of the Western Canadian 
Leagues, remaining there until his retirement from playing baseball in 
1954. Wells returned to the U.S. and continued with the sport as manager 
of the Birmingham Black Barons. After his baseball career, Wells was employed 
at a New York City deli before returning to his birthplace of Austin to 
look after his mother. He died of congestive heart failure in Austin in 
1989.[2] Wells was originally buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Austin, Texas, 
and was re-interred in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1997 for his 
play in the Negro leagues. He has also been inducted into the Mexican Professional 
Baseball Hall of Fame and the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] Known statistics: 
.319 career batting average, .510 slugging percentage, 98 home runs, 644 
runs scored, 399 runs batted in, and 756 games played.[4] Stella Lee Wells, 
Willie's daughter, created a scholarship fund honoring her father, called 
the Stella and Willie Wells Scholarship Fund. The fund awards scholarships
