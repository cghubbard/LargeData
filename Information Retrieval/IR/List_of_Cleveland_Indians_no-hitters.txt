The Cleveland Indians are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Cleveland, 
Ohio. They play in the American League Central division. Also known in 
their early years as the "Cleveland Blues" (1901), "Cleveland Broncos" 
(1902), and "Cleveland Naps" (1903–14),[1] pitchers for the Indians have 
thrown 14 no-hitters in franchise history.[2] A no-hitter is officially 
recognized by Major League Baseball only "when a pitcher (or pitchers) 
allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at 
least nine innings. In a no-hit game, a batter may reach base via a walk, 
an error, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, 
or catcher's interference."[3] No-hitters of less than nine complete innings 
were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several 
rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form.[4] No-hitters 
are rare, but only one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher 
accomplish the feat.[a] Two perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, 
have been thrown in Indians history.[5] As defined by Major League Baseball, 
"in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the 
game."[3] These feats were achieved by Addie Joss on October 2, 1908 and 
by Len Barker on May 15, 1981. Bob Rhoads threw the first no-hitter in 
Indians history on September 18, 1908; the most recent no-hitter was thrown 
by Barker on May 15, 1981.[5] No left-handed pitchers have thrown no-hitters 
in franchise history while all were by right-handers. Nine no-hitters were 
thrown at home and five on the road. They threw four in April, two in May, 
two in June, three in July, two in September, and one in October. The longest 
interval between no-hitters in franchise history was between the games 
pitched by Barker and incumbent pitcher, encompassing almost 30 years from 
May 15, 1981 till present. Conversely, the shortest interval between no-hitters 
was between the games pitched by Rhoads and Joss, encompassing merely 14 
days from September 18, 1908 till October 2, 1908.[5] They no-hit the Chicago 
White Sox the most, which occurred thrice, which were no-hit by Joss (in 
1908 and 1910) and Bob Feller (in 1940). There is one no-hitter which the 
team allowed at least a run, which was done by Rhoads in 1908. The most 
baserunners allowed in a no-hitter were by Feller (in 1940) and Don Black 
(in 1947), who each allowed six. Of the 14 no-hitters, five have been won 
by a score of 1–0, more common than any other results. The largest margin 
of victory in a no-hitter was a 9–0 win by Wes Ferrell in 1931. The smallest 
margin of victory was a 1–0 wins by Joss in 1908 and 1910, Feller in 1940 
and 1946, and Dennis Eckersley in 1977; and 2–1 win by Rhoads in 1908. 
The umpire is also an integral part of any no-hitter. The task of the umpire 
in a baseball game is to make any decision "which involves judgment, such 
as, but not limited to, whether a batted Ball is fair or foul, whether 
a pitch is a strike or a Ball, or whether a runner is safe or out… [the 
umpire's judgment on such matters] is final."[6] Part of the duties of 
the umpire making calls at home plate includes defining the strike zone, 
which "is defined as that area over homeplate (sic) the upper limit of 
which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders 
and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the 
hollow beneath the kneecap."[6] These calls define every baseball game 
and are therefore integral to the completion of any no-hitter.[7] 11 different 
umpires presided over each of the franchise's 14 no-hitters. The manager 
is another integral part of any no-hitter. The tasks of the manager is 
to determine the starting rotation as well as batting order and defensive 
lineup every game. Managers choosing the right pitcher and right defensive 
lineup at a right game at a right place at a right time would lead to a 
no-hitter.[citation needed] 11 different managers have led to the franchise's
