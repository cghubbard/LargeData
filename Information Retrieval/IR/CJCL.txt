CJCL (branded on-air as Sportsnet 590, The Fan) is a Canadian sports radio 
station in Toronto, Ontario. Owned and operated by Rogers Media, a division 
of Rogers Communications, CJCL's studios are located at the Rogers Building 
at Bloor and Jarvis in downtown Toronto, while its transmitters are located 
near Grimsby atop the Niagara Escarpment. Programming on the station includes 
local sports talk radio shows during the day; CBS Sports Radio overnight; 
and live broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays baseball, Toronto Raptors basketball, 
Toronto Maple Leafs hockey, Toronto FC soccer, and Buffalo Bills football. 
The station first aired on February 21, 1951 as AM 1400 CKFH, a news and 
sports station owned by legendary Canadian broadcaster Foster Hewitt (the 
"FH" of the call sign).[1] The station moved to the 1430 AM frequency in 
1960, increasing power first to 5,000, then 10,000 and finally 50,000 watts. 
CKFH would begin playing Top 40 music in 1966, then move to a country music 
format in 1975. The station was subsequently sold to Telemedia in 1981, 
when it adopted its current CJCL call sign and switched to an adult contemporary 
format. In 1983, the station briefly adopted talk radio programming, but 
returned to its music format within a few months, with increased emphasis 
on oldies. CJCL was flagship of the Telemedia network, and as such broadcast 
Toronto Blue Jays baseball games (with Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth calling 
the action) followed by hours of talk after the game. The station has been 
the home of the Blue Jays for most of its history (with exception of a 
hiatus from 1998-2002, when CHUM-AM aired their games). As the 1980s progressed 
and the winning Blue Jays became more popular, the sports features became 
CJCL's profit centre. Encouraged by the newfound success of sports radio 
in the United States, in 1992, the year the Blue Jays won their first World 
Series, CJCL would drop non-sports programming altogether on September 
4, and become "The Fan 1430", becoming the first all-sports station in 
Canada. The station's nickname may have been inspired by WFAN in New York 
City, the first sports radio station in the world that led to the creation 
of sports radio stations everywhere. In 1994, Telemedia acquired CKYC from 
Rogers Communications, and on February 6, 1995, at noon, the two stations 
switched frequencies, with "The Fan" moving to 590 AM (subsequently becoming 
"The Fan 590") and CKYC moving to 1430 AM (where it operates today as multilingual 
station CHKT). CJCL was itself acquired by Rogers Media in 2002. In January 
2011, CJCL became known as "Sportsnet Radio The Fan 590", the move coming 
as part of a co-branding initiative with its television counterpart Rogers 
Sportsnet,[2] amid indications that rival TSN was preparing to launch a 
competing sports radio station, TSN Radio 1050.[3] The station's on air 
identity was then changed to "Sportsnet 590 The Fan" in October 2011. The 
Fan 590 is the flagship station for the following teams' radio broadcasts:
