As player As manager Wesley Noreen Westrum (November 28, 1922 – May 28, 
2002) was an American professional baseball player, coach, manager, and 
scout. He played for 11 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball for 
the New York Giants from 1947 to 1957.[1] He was known as a superb defensive 
catcher.[2] He served as the second manager in the history of the New York 
Mets, replacing Casey Stengel in 1965 after the latter fractured his hip 
and was forced to retire.[3] A native of Clearbrook, Minnesota, Westrum 
was a stalwart defensive player for the New York Giants (1947–57) and, 
in his prime, a powerful right-handed hitter, although he had trouble making 
contact and hit for a low .217 career batting average. He began his major 
league career as the Giants' reserve catcher, playing behind Walker Cooper.[4] 
When Cooper was traded in 1949, Westrum shared the catching duties with 
Ray Mueller for the remainder of the season.[4] He became the full-time 
catcher for the Giants in 1950, leading National League catchers with a 
.999 fielding percentage, 31 baserunners caught stealing, a 54.4% caught 
stealing percentage and 71 assists, and finished second to Roy Campanella 
with 608 putouts.[4][5] Westrum was a key player for the Giants’ during 
the remarkable 1951 pennant race in which the Giants, 13 games behind the 
Brooklyn Dodgers on August 12, fought back to win 16 games in a row and 
finished the season tied with the Dodgers for first place.[6][7] Westrum 
contributed 20 home runs with 70 runs batted in, and led National League 
catchers in baserunners caught stealing.[1][4][8] The two teams met in 
the 1951 National League tie-breaker series in which the Giants' season 
was climaxed by Bobby Thomson's Shot Heard 'Round the World, a three-run 
home run in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 5–4 win of the third and 
final playoff game.[6][7][9] Afterwards, the Giants would lose to the New 
York Yankees in the 1951 World Series.[10] His 1952 season was plagued 
by injuries and he only managed to hit for a .220 batting average in 114 
games, although he still managed to finish second to Del Rice among catchers 
in assists.[1][11] Westrum remained the Giants' starting catcher throughout 
the 1954 season, catching all four games in the 1954 World Series against 
the Cleveland Indians.[12] Injuries continued to take their toll, and by 
1955, Ray Katt had replaced him as the starting catcher.[4] When the Giants 
moved to San Francisco in 1958, he was offered a role as a third-string 
catcher or as a coach.[4] He decided to retire as a player at the age of 
34, and accepted the coaching job.[4] In an eleven-year major league career, 
Westrum played in 919 games, accumulating 503 hits in 2,322 at bats for 
a .217 career batting average along with 96 home runs, 315 runs batted 
in, and a .356 on-base percentage.[1] He ended his career with a .985 fielding 
percentage.[1] In the 1950 season, he committed only one error in 139 games 
played, and had 21 double plays, the 11th highest season total for a catcher.[13][14] 
Westrum's 1950 fielding percentage of .999 stood as a National League record 
for catchers, until it was surpassed by Charles Johnson in 1997.[15] He 
made the National League All-Star teams in 1952 and 1953.[16][17] Westrum's 
49.29% career caught stealing percentage ranks 21st all-time among major 
league catchers.[18] He played more games as a catcher than any other player 
in Giants history (902).[19] Westrum was pictured on the cover of the first 
issue of Sports Illustrated on August 16, 1954, along with Milwaukee Braves 
star Eddie Mathews. Westrum served as the Giants' bullpen coach and them 
became their first base coach through the 1963 season.[2] He joined the 
Mets as a coach in 1964, and became pitching coach in July 1965 after the 
release of Warren Spahn. Westrum was named the Mets' manager when Stengel 
was injured on August 30, 1965, and stepped down as skipper of the perennial 
last-place club.[13] The Mets fared no better under Westrum in 1965, losing 
48 of the 67 games under his leadership.[3] But his 1966 club escaped the 
basement for the first time in the Mets' five-year history when it finished 
ninth in the ten-team National League, posting a record of 66 wins and 
95 losses, a 16-game improvement over the previous season.[3] The Mets 
were slowly developing an array of young pitchers in the minor leagues; 
however, apart from Tom Seaver, none arrived in time to help Westrum in 
1967, when New York again finished tenth and last. Westrum resigned with 
11 games to go in the season.[20] Coach Salty Parker managed the team for 
the remaining games of the 1967 season, and Gil Hodges was named manager 
for 1968. Westrum then rejoined the Giants, who eventually gave him a second 
managing opportunity in July 1974 when he succeeded Charlie Fox with the 
club in fifth place. He was not able to post a winning record in his 1½ 
years as San Francisco's manager, although he came close when his team 
finished one game under .500 in 1975 and in third place in the National 
League Western Division. That marked his last year as a major league manager, 
although Westrum stayed in the game as a scout for the Atlanta Braves for 
many years.[13] His final record as a manager: 260 wins, 366 losses (.415).[3] 
Westrum died at the age of 79 in Clearbrook, Minnesota on May 28, 2002.[2]
