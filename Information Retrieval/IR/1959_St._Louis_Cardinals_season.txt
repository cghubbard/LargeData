The 1959 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 78th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 68th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
71–83 during the season and finished seventh in the National League, 16 
games behind the NL pennant and World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The 
Cardinals played the league's best baseball from early May into late July, 
during which time they went 40–30. In the end, pitching failed the Redbirds. 
Their 4.34 ERA was ranked worst in the National League. There were some 
bright spots to the season. Larry Jackson and Lindy McDaniel, who found 
success and saved 15 games after an early-season move to the bullpen, each 
won a team-high 14 games. Also, third baseman Ken Boyer won a Gold Glove 
this year. Right fielder Joe Cunningham led the National League in on-base 
percentage at .453 and batted .345 to finish second to Hank Aaron for the 
National League batting title. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos
