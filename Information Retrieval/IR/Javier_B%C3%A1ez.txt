Ednel Javier "Javy" Báez (born December 1, 1992) is a Puerto Rican professional 
baseball infielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Born in Puerto Rico, Báez attended high school in Jacksonville, Florida, 
and starred for his school's baseball team. The Cubs selected Báez with 
the ninth overall selection of the 2011 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut 
on August 5, 2014. He is the first player for the Cubs to steal home in 
a postseason game since Jimmy Slagle in 1907. On October 2016, Báez was 
named NLCS co-MVP alongside left-handed starter Jon Lester as the Chicago 
Cubs clinched their 2016 National League pennant. Born and raised in Puerto 
Rico, Báez moved to Florida in 2005 along with his mother and siblings, 
three brothers and a sister.[1] The move was so that his sister, Noely, 
could get medical treatment for her spina bifida condition.[2] In Puerto 
Rico he and his two brothers, Gadiel and Rolando, became familiar with 
the sport through their father, Ángel Luis Baez who, before his death when 
Javier was ten, heavily influenced their life and was responsible for their 
interest in baseball.[2] The brothers would later immortalize this interest 
by getting tattoos of Major League Baseball's logo, which symbolized that 
"baseball has been in [their] lives forever."[2] Rolando was the first 
to become a professional baseball player, being drafted by the San Diego 
Padres in 2002.[3] As a middle school student, it took time for Javier 
to adapt because he was unable to fluently speak or understand English.[1] 
Báez eventually learned the language through trial and error in a process 
that lasted for three years, memorizing words before knowing their actual 
meaning.[1] Báez played the last two years of his secondary education for 
Arlington Country Day School (ACD) in Jacksonville, Florida. His coach 
at ACD, Ron Dickerson, noted that initially scouts were not impressed by 
him, noting his talent, but not believing he could become a star.[1] Dickerson 
emphasized that Báez's work ethic was responsible for positioning him as 
a real prospect.[1] As a sophomore he had a .463 batting average with 38 
hits, of which nine were doubles and 13 were home runs.[4] Making 82 plate 
appearances in 25 games, he also gathered 60 runs batted in (RBIs). By 
the time that his junior season was over, Báez was a highly rated Aflac 
All-American.[1] In his senior season, he recorded 64 hits in 83 at-bats 
to gather an average of .771, which included 20 doubles and 22 home runs. 
In total, Báez recorded 52 RBIs in 30 games.[4] During his time at ACD, 
he never played a position steadily. After working at second base, Báez 
was moved to shortstop once the team lost a player.[5] Besides these positions, 
he also played as a center fielder and as a catcher.[6] The Chicago Cubs, 
led by Jim Hendry, selected Báez in the first round, with the ninth overall 
selection, of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft.[3][7] He began his 
professional career by playing shortstop for the Arizona Cubs of the Rookie-level 
Arizona League, where he only played in three games, recording three hits, 
including two doubles, in 12 at-bats and two stolen bases.[8] Promoted 
to the Boise Hawks of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League, Báez recorded 
one single in six at bats across two games.[9] On September 29, 2011, he 
was selected third overall by the Leones de Ponce in the Liga de Béisbol 
Profesional Roberto Clemente's (LBPRC) rookie draft, but has yet to play 
there due to the Cubs' limitations.[10] Before the 2012 season, MLB.com 
rated Báez as the 62nd best prospect in baseball.[11] He remained with 
the Cubs in extended spring training with other prospects, participating 
in 26 games and hitting 6 doubles, 3 triples and 8 home runs, with 28 RBI, 
11 stolen bases, and 23 strikeouts in 94 plate appearances.[12] He made 
his regular season debut with the Peoria Chiefs of the Class A Midwest 
League.[13] He was promoted to the Daytona Cubs of the Class A-Advanced 
Florida State League (FSL).[13] Baseball America included Báez in two of 
its "Best Tools" lists, naming him the "Most Exciting Player in the Midwest 
League" and the "Best Defensive Infielder" in the Chicago Cubs system.[14] 
Before the 2013 season, MLB.com rated Báez as the 16th best prospect in 
baseball.[15] The Cubs invited him to join their major league team in spring 
training, competing in the Cactus League. Báez hit four home runs in five 
at-bats over the course of two games,[16] including in an unofficial exhibition 
game against the Japanese national baseball team that was preparing for 
the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[17][18] He concluded spring training with 
a .298 batting average and 10 RBIs.[19] Báez returned to the Daytona Cubs 
to open the 2013 season. On June 10, 2013, Báez hit four home runs in one 
game, becoming the second player to do so in the history of the FSL.[20] 
Báez was named one of the five finalists in the fan vote for the final 
spot on the World Team's roster for the 2013 All-Star Futures Game, but 
he finished second to Carlos Correa.[21] On July 6, 2013, the Cubs promoted 
Báez to the Tennessee Smokies of the Class AA Southern League after displaying 
more plate discipline and walking more often during the previous month.[22] 
Báez was named to both the FSL and Southern League All-Star teams at the 
conclusion of the season.[23][24] The Cubs named him their Minor League 
Player of the Year, closing the season as the top-ranked prospect in the 
team's system and third overall in the Southern League.[25][26] On October 
28, 2013, Báez won the MiLBY Award for Best Minor League Game of the Year, 
recognizing his four-home run game.[27] The Cubs invited Báez to spring 
training in 2014. An injury suffered by Starlin Castro allowed him regular 
playing time. To increase his versatility, Báez began practicing at second 
base and third base.[28] He was reassigned to Minor League camp during 
the final week of spring training.[29] Bothered by a back injury, he opened 
his participation with the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League 
(PCL) immersed in a slump, with his only hit in 20 at bats being the first 
home run of the season.[30][31] During the second week of the season, Báez 
had his first multi-hit game and hit a second home run before being placed 
on the seven-day disabled list with an ankle sprain. Báez slumped following 
his return, and his batting average fell below .150 in May, while his strikeout-to-walk 
ratio worsened. With a more patient approach at the plate, Báez began a 
hitting streak on May 16, 2014. On May 26, 2014, Báez was named the PCL 
Player of the Week for the previous week.[32] On May 22, 2014, the Cangrejeros 
de Santurce of the LBPRC signed Báez by exploiting a legal loophole that 
allowed players to be considered free agents unless properly signed within 
three years of being drafted.[33] However, the Leones de Ponce quickly 
reclaimed his local player rights, claiming that they had approached him 
with the intent of formalizing a contract but that the "extreme fatigue" 
clause of the Winter League Agreement had interfered.[34] On August 5, 
the Cubs promoted Báez to the major leagues.[35] In his debut that day, 
he hit his first career home run; the game-winner in the 12th inning victory 
against the Colorado Rockies, becoming the first player since Miguel Cabrera 
in 2003 to hit an extra innings home run in his debut.[36] In his third 
game, Báez hit two home runs, becoming the first player since Joe Cunningham 
in 1954 to hit three home runs in his first three MLB games.[37] On August 
18, 2014, Báez hit his fifth home run in 14 games, joining Jason Kipnis 
as the only other second baseman to do so in the last 100 years.[38] On 
September 2, Castro injured himself in an awkward slide at home plate and 
did not return for the remainder of the year.[39] Báez finished the season 
at shortstop. In 52 games with the Cubs in 2014, Báez struck out 95 times 
while batting .169 with 5 stolen bases, 9 home runs, and 20 RBI. After 
a rough Spring Training, mostly due to a high number of strikeouts, the 
Cubs optioned Báez to Triple-A on March 30, 2015.[40] He was then called 
up as a part of September call-ups on September 1. Báez hit his first home 
run of the season September 4 in a win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[41] 
His three-run home run in the second inning of game 4 of the National League 
Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals helped the Cubs to a 6-4 
win as they advanced to the National League Championship Series.[42] On 
May 8, in the last game of a four-game series at Wrigley Field, Báez hit 
a solo home run in the bottom of the 13th inning to lead the Cubs to a 
4-3 victory and a four-game sweep of the Washington Nationals.[43] On June 
28, Báez hit a grand slam in the 15th inning to lead the Cubs in a win 
over the Cincinnati Reds. On October 7, in Game 1 of the 2016 National 
League Division Series against the San Francisco Giants, Báez hit a solo 
home run off Giants starter Johnny Cueto in the 8th inning to account for 
the only run in a 1-0 Cubs victory. It was the first 1-0 win in a playoff 
game for the Cubs since game 4 of the 1906 World Series against the Chicago 
White Sox. In Game 4, Báez drove in Jason Heyward to cap off a four-run 
rally in the top of the ninth, sending the Cubs to the 2016 National League 
Championship Series with a 6-5 victory.[44] On October 15, 2016, during 
the first game of the 2016 National League Championship Series against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, Baez stole home in the second inning. He was the 
first Cub to do this in a postseason game since 1907 when Jimmy Slagle 
accomplished this against the Detroit Tigers in game four of the 1907 World 
Series. Baez is also only one of 19 players in baseball history to steal 
home in a playoff game. [45] Báez and Jon Lester were named NLCS co-MVPs, 
after Báez hit .318 with five RBIs, four doubles, and two stolen bases 
in the series, including three hits and three RBIs in Game 5.[46] Báez's 
sister died on April 8, 2015, aged 21. She had spina bifida and he was 
very close to her. Báez took a leave of absence from the Iowa Cubs to help
