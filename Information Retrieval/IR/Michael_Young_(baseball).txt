Michael Brian Young (born October 19, 1976) is an American former professional 
baseball infielder who played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Originally a second baseman, the versatile Young was a five time All-Star 
at shortstop, once at third base, and once as a combination designated 
hitter and utility infielder. He was the 2005 American League batting champion. 
Young played baseball in high school at Bishop Amat Memorial High School 
and in college at University of California, Santa Barbara (UC-Santa Barbara). 
He was originally drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 1994, but elected 
to return to college and was eventually drafted in 1997 by the Toronto 
Blue Jays. After spending several seasons in the minor leagues with the 
Blue Jays, Young was traded to the Rangers where he spent over a decade. 
While with the Rangers, he set several club records in offensive statistic 
categories including runs scored and total bases. In 2016, Young was inducted 
into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. Young attended Bishop Amat Memorial 
High School[1] in La Puente, California, followed by the University of 
California, Santa Barbara, to which he later donated money to refurbish 
the school's baseball field.[2] Young was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles 
in the 25th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft but did not sign. 
Three years later the Toronto Blue Jays selected him in the fifth round 
of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. Young signed with the Blue Jays, 
who traded him in 2000 with pitcher Darwin Cubillán to the Rangers for 
Esteban Loaiza while Young was still in their minor league system.[3] Young 
made his professional debut in 1997 with the St. Catharines Blue Jays in 
the New York–Penn League (NY-Penn) (short-season A). Among his achievements 
in the NY-Penn League were a 16-game hitting streak, tying for fifth in 
the league with 48 RBIs, and tying for third in the league with 136 total 
bases. In 1998, he spent the season with the Hagerstown Suns of the South 
Atlantic League. Playing second base, he led all players at his position 
in fielding percentage. 1999 would be an all-star season for Young. Playing 
for the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Florida State League, he earned spots 
on both the midseason and postseason all star teams by leading the league 
in doubles and finishing fourth in batting average and hits, .313 and 155 
respectively. After the regular season, he played for the Rancho Cucamonga 
Quakes in the California Fall League. He split 2000 between Double-A and 
Triple-A and, on July 19, was traded to the Rangers. The Rangers purchased 
his contract on September 27 and he played the final five games of the 
season in the majors making his debut as a pinch runner. Though he began, 
2001 in Triple-A, he was recalled to the majors on May 25 and did not return 
to the minors at all during the season.[4] Young reached the Majors briefly 
in 2000, playing 2nd and getting two at-bats. He hit .249 in 106 games 
as a second baseman in 2001. In 2002, Young placed second in fielding among 
second basemen with a .988 fielding percentage. In 2003, Young was 3rd 
in the league in hits with 204, and led all second baseman with a batting 
average of .306. Young had a fielding percentage of .987. After signing 
a new contract,[5] Young moved to shortstop, filling the hole left by the 
departure of regular Ranger's shortstop Alex Rodriguez in 2004, to make 
room for newly acquired second baseman Alfonso Soriano. He was second in 
the American League in hits with 216 and at bats with 690, fourth in runs 
with 114, and ninth in batting with an average of .313.[6] He spent 89 
games hitting in the leadoff spot, the last time in his career that he 
hit leadoff prior to 2013.[7] Young won the AL batting title in 2005 with 
an average of .331, and was first in MLB in hits with 221. He was second 
in AL in at bats with 668, and his 114 runs were fifth-best in the AL. 
Young also established a career-high in home runs with 24. Young's 91 RBIs 
placed him second among all shortstops in the AL.[8] On February 14, 2006, 
Young and Rangers teammate Mark Teixeira were selected to the United States 
roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic.[9] At the conclusion of the 
2006 MLB All-Star Game held at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Young was awarded 
the Ted Williams Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVP Award after hitting 
a game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning.[10] Young led the American 
League in fielding percentage at shortstop with .981. Young also played 
all 162 games of the 2006 season.[11] In March 2007, Young agreed to an 
$80 million contract extension that would have kept him with the Rangers 
until 2013.[12][13] Young finished the 2007 season with a batting average 
of .315, which led the Rangers and was 11th-highest in the AL. Young also 
led the Rangers with 94 RBIs and was second among all shortstops in the 
AL. Young was second on the team and tied a career high in stolen bases 
with 13. Young's 201 hits were 4th in the AL, and marked the 5th consecutive 
200-hit season, joining Ichiro Suzuki and Wade Boggs as the only players 
to do so since 1940 and just the second middle infielder, along with Charlie 
Gehringer, to have accomplished that feat. Young played in the longest 
All-Star game in history. He drove in the game-winning RBI at the 2008 
MLB All-Star Game after four hours and 40 minutes of playing time. Also, 
in 2008 Young won the Gold Glove at shortstop for the American League. 
In 2009, Young moved to third base to make room for shortstop prospect 
Elvis Andrus.[14] The Rangers did not consult Young on this, and he requested 
a trade. He subsequently rescinded the request.[15] On April 19, 2009, 
Young hit his first career walk-off home run, off Royals pitcher Kyle Farnsworth.[16] 
Young was voted on the AL 2009 All Star team by the players. On June 16, 
2010, Young hit a ground ball up the middle to collect his 1,748th career 
hit, and pass Iván Rodríguez to become the Rangers' career leader in hits.[17] 
On defense, in 2010 he tied for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, 
with 19, and had the lowest fielding percentage among them, at .950.[18] 
During the 2010–11 offseason, Young said that the Rangers had "misled and 
manipulated" him and requested a trade.[19] The Rangers, having acquired 
free agent third baseman Adrián Beltré, planned to have Young be the team's 
primary designated hitter as well as a utility infielder, and see time 
at first base for the first time in his career. He was a 2011 American 
League All Star.[20] On August 7, 2011, Young hit an infield single against 
Josh Tomlin of the Cleveland Indians for his 2,000th career hit.[21] In 
2011, Young batted .338 (3rd in the American League) with 11 home runs, 
primarily splitting his time between DH (69 games), third base (40 games), 
and first base (36 games).[20] He tied with Adrian Gonzalez for the AL 
lead in hits (213), and was 5th in RBIs (106) and sacrifice flies (9), 
8th in on-base percentage (.380), and 10th in doubles (41).[20] After Young 
struggled in the 2012 season, the Rangers asked Young if he desired a trade, 
as they planned to cut his playing time for the 2013 season. Young did 
not request one, but the Rangers began to pursue a trade, and eventually 
traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies.[15] Since being traded in 2012, 
the Rangers have not issued Young's uniform number 10 to any player or 
coach leading some to believe that the Rangers may one day retire #10 in 
honor of Michael Young. At the time of his departure from the team, Young 
lead the Rangers in several stat categories including games played (1774), 
hits (2178), doubles (406), triples (55), runs scored (1057), at bats (7221), 
strikeouts (1132), extra-base hits (632), and total bases (3210).[22] He 
was third all time in runs batted in (RBIs) with 962 and sixth all time 
in home runs with 172.[22] He also held several single-season records including 
most multi-hit games (70 in 2004), most hits (221 in 2005), doubles (52 
in 2006), and at bats and plate appearances in 2006 (691 and 748 respectively).[22] 
Young agreed to waive his no-trade clause and on December 9, 2012, was 
traded to the Phillies in exchange for pitcher Josh Lindblom and minor 
league pitcher Lisalverto Bonilla. The deal reunited him with former teammates 
Laynce Nix, Cliff Lee and Mike Adams.[23][24] The Phillies were monitoring 
Young for some time prior to his acquisition. Their former Hall of Fame 
third baseman Mike Schmidt said, "we got a Derek Jeter kind of player on 
our team all of a sudden ... He's two or three Michael Young years away 
from being a Hall of Famer, first ballot maybe." Phillies general manager 
Rubén Amaro, Jr. and manager Charlie Manuel also were fond of Young and 
made him a target headed into the Winter Meetings. Once they agreed to 
a deal, Young had to approve it, which he did, later mentioning that he 
would only have done so to go to a winning team like the Phillies. The 
Phillies viewed Young as a stop-gap to get them to top prospect Cody Asche.[25] 
In 126 games with the Phillies, he hit .276 with 8 homers and 42 RBI. However, 
the Phillies did not turn out to be the "winning team" that Young had expected. 
On August 31, the Phillies' record stood at 62–74, and they were 21½ games 
out of first place and 14 games out of the last available playoff spot. 
He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Upon leaving Philadelphia, Young 
released a statement in which he thanked the Phillies and said that he 
"had a blast" playing in Philadelphia and that he would recommend it "in 
a heartbeat" to any other player.[26] Phillies players, namely younger 
players such as Darin Ruf and Cody Asche, commented that they loved having 
a veteran like Young to whom they could look up and seek advice from. Ruf 
said, "He was the type of guy to come up to a younger guy like myself or 
Cody and tell us a thing or two about what he thinks we need to do and 
how he thinks we could prolong our careers. He was just a great teammate 
to have around."[27] On August 31, 2013, he was traded to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for minor league pitcher Rob Rasmussen.[28] In the last year of 
his contract, Young again waived his no-trade clause in order to join his 
hometown team for an expected playoff run.[29] Young was acquired to be 
a backup infielder and provide a veteran presence on the team.[30] Young 
made his Dodgers debut on September 1, 2013 pinch hitting in a game against 
the Colorado Rockies.[31] He appeared in 21 games for the Dodgers at a 
variety of positions and hit .314. After initially considering some offers 
as a free agent, Young chose to announce his retirement from baseball on 
January 31, 2014.[32][33] On November 5, 2014, Young was hired by the Texas 
Rangers as a special assistant to general manager Jon Daniels. He was key 
in the offseason acquisition of Outfielder Ian Desmond in 2016.[34] On 
July 30, 2016, Young was inducted into the Texas Rangers Baseball Hall 
of Fame in a pregame ceremony before the team's matchup with the Kansas 
City Royals.[35] Young's mother is of Mexican descent. Young met his wife 
Cristina, also of Mexican descent, while in high school. They have three 
sons named Mateo, Emilio, and Antonio respectively. Young is a cousin of 
former WBO Light Welterweight boxing champion Zack Padilla.[36][37] Another 
of his cousins, Jason Young, also played minor league baseball. Young is 
also a philanthropist. He and his wife are sponsors of the Wipe Out Kids' 
Cancer campaign.[38] In 2006, Young began the Young Heroes Scholarship 
Program, and in 2010, the Michael Young Family Hispanic Scholarship Program 
was established. In July 2011, Young and his wife announced the launch 
of the Michael Young Family Foundation, a charity which supports the involvement 
of children's health in all areas: physical social, mental, and educational.[39] 
Young is represented by baseball agent Dan Lozano.[40] Young is a two-time 
winner of the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award winning in 2008 and 2011.[41] 
He is one of only three players who have won multiple times (John Smoltz
