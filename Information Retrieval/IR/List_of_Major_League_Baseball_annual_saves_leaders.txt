The following is a list of annual leaders in saves in Major League Baseball 
(MLB), with separate lists for the American League and the National League. 
The list also includes several professional leagues and associations that 
were never part of MLB. In baseball, a save is credited to a pitcher who 
finishes a game for the winning team under prescribed circumstances. Most 
commonly a relief pitcher ("reliever") earns a save by entering in the 
ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs 
and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead.[1] 
The statistic was created by Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to "measure the effectiveness 
of relief pitchers" and was adopted as an MLB official statistic in 1969.[2][3] 
The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date. 
MLB recognizes the player or players in each league[a] with the most saves 
each season. In retrospect, the five saves by Jack Manning meant he led 
the National League in its inaugural year, while Bill Hoffer was the American 
League's first saves champion with three.[4] Mordecai Brown was the first 
pitcher to record at least 10 saves in a season. Dan Quisenberry, Bruce 
Sutter, Firpo Marberry, and Ed Walsh are the only pitchers to lead the 
league in saves five times (though Marberry and Walsh did so before 1969). 
Sutter is also tied with Harry Wright, Dan Quisenberry and Craig Kimbrel 
for the most consecutive seasons leading the league in saves with four.
