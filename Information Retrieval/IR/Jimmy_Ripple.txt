He played eight seasons for the Montreal Royals, parts of two for the Rochester 
Red Wings, and the same for the Toronto Maple Leafs, all of the International 
League. In 1956, he elected into the International League Hall of Fame. 
James Albert Ripple was born on October 14, 1909 in Export, Pennsylvania.[1] 
He made his first appearance in professional baseball at the age of 19 
for the class-C Jeannette Jays of the Middle Atlantic League for the start 
of the 1929 minor league baseball season.[2] He played in 104 games for 
the Jays, hitting 24 triples, and 14 home runs, while batting .336, before 
being promoted to the Montreal Royals of the Class-AA International League 
for the remainder of the season.[2] For the next six years, through the 
1935 season, he remained with the Royals, playing as a starting outfielder.[2] 
During that span he appeared in at least 130 games each season, hitting 
for a career highs with 21 home runs in 1932, and a .333 batting average 
in 1935.[2] On June 22, 1935, Ripple was sold by Montreal to the New York 
Giants of the National League, and made his first appearance for the major 
league team on April 20, 1936.[1] Platooning with Hank Leiber,[3] Ripple 
started 74 games in center field for the Giants and appeared in 96 games 
total in 1936, and had a .305 batting average, seven home runs, and 47 
RBIs. The Giants won the National League pennant, and met the New York 
Yankees of the American League in the 1936 World Series.[4] Although the 
Yankees won the series four games to two, Ripple played in five of the 
six games played, starting four in center field and had a batting average 
of .333.[1][4] In game three, he hit a home run in the fifth inning off 
Bump Hadley to score the Giants only run in a 2–1 defeat.[5] In 1937, Ripple's 
playing time increased to 121 games, and his 100 starts were split between 
center and right field, and with the expanded role, he established career 
highs in all major batting categories except for home runs, which dipped 
to five.[1] At the conclusion of the 1937 season, he Giants won the National 
League pennant, and met the New York Yankees again in the World Series.[6] 
The Yankees defeated the Giants for the second consecutive year, winning 
four games to one in this series.[6] Ripple played in right field for all 
five games, collecting five hits in 17 at bats for a .294 batting average.[1] 
Ripple's playing time in 1938 increased further for the 1938 season, up 
to 134 games, of which most of them were in right field.[1] Although his 
role was expanded, his offensive output suffered a significant drop in 
comparison of his first two seasons with the Giants. His batting average 
dipped to .261, and he surpassed just one statistical career high with 
10 home runs.[1] Ripple's play suffer more in 1939, and was batting .228 
after playing in just 66 games for Giants, he was traded to the Brooklyn 
Dodgers on September 8 for a player to be named later, which was later 
revealed to be Ray Hayworth.[1] However, this move improved his play, and 
he had a .330 batting average in 28 games to close out the season.[1] For 
the 1940 season, the Dodgers assigned Ripple to their class-AA International 
League team, the Montreal Royals.[2] His return to the Royals resulted 
in another successful minor league season as he had a .305 batting average 
in 110 games played.[1][2] In August, the Dodgers promoted him to the majors 
for a seven-game stretch, then placed him on waivers.[1] The Cincinnati 
Reds claimed Ripple off waivers from the Dodgers on August 28, 1940, and 
they made him their regular left fielder for the remainder of the pennant 
run.[1] In 32 games for the Reds that season, he batted .307, while helping 
the team win the 1940 National League pennant.[1] Following the regular 
season, the Reds met the Detroit Tigers in the 1940 World Series, who they 
defeated in four games to three in a seven-game series.[7] In game two, 
he hit a 2-run home run off Schoolboy Rowe to give the Reds a 2-run lead 
in their eventual 5–3 win to tie the series at one game win each.[8] Ripple 
began the 1941 season with the Reds, playing in 38 games. However, he was 
hitting just .216, so the Reds sold him to the St. Louis Cardinals on June 
21, who then designated him to their International League team, the Rochester 
Red Wings.[1][2] He played in 52 games to complete the season, batted .378, 
hit five home runs, and had 22 RBIs.[2] In 1942, his batting average dropped 
to .249 through 78 games, and he was transferred to the Toronto Maple Leafs 
who were unnafiliated with a major league team.[2] He remained with the 
Maple Leafs into the 1943 season, who were now affiliated with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, his contract was later bought by the Philadelphia Athletics of 
the American League, and they promoted him to their major league club.[1][2] 
He appeared in 32 games for the Athletics that season, batted .238, and 
played his last major league game on September 12, 1943.[1] His major league 
career hitting totals include a .282 batting average, 28 home runs, 236 
RBIs, and 510 hits in 554 games played.[1] His last minor league season 
occurred in 1944, when he played for several class-AA teams: the Louisville 
Colonels of the American Association (an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox), 
the San Francisco Seals and Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League.[2] 
After 12 minor league seasons, and 1412 games, Ripple totalled 1507 hits, 
with 128 home runs and .301 batting average.[2] For his high level of play 
during his minor league baseball career, he was named to the International 
League Hall of Fame in 1956. He died at the age of 49 in Greensburg, Pennsylvania 
of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, and is interred at Eastview Cemetery
