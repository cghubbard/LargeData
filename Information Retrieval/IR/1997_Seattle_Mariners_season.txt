The Seattle Mariners 1997 season was their 21st since the franchise creation, 
and ended the season finishing 1st in the American League West, finishing 
with a record of 90-72. For the second straight regular season, they led 
the AL in runs scored (925) and shattered the all-time record for most 
home runs hit by a team in one season (set at 257 by the Baltimore Orioles 
just one season earlier) with 264. Five Mariners scored at least 100 runs 
and six hit at least 20 home runs. In addition, the Mariners pitching staff 
struck out 1,207 batters during the regular season: more than any other 
AL team. In 1997, Randy Johnson set an American League record for left-handers 
by striking out nineteen batters in a 4-1 loss to the Oakland A's on June 
24.[8] On August 8 he matched the feat by setting down nineteen Chicago 
White Sox.[8] Johnson posted a 20-4 record with 291 strikeouts and an ERA 
of 2.28. He finished second in the Cy Young balloting to Toronto's Roger 
Clemens.[8] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
