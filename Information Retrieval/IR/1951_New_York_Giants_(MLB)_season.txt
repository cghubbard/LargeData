The 1951 New York Giants season was the franchise's 69th season and saw 
the Giants finish the regular season in a tie for first place in the National 
League with a record of 96 wins and 58 losses. This prompted a three-game 
playoff against the Brooklyn Dodgers, which the Giants won in three games, 
clinched by Bobby Thomson's walk-off home run, a moment immortalized as 
the Shot Heard 'Round the World.[1] The Giants, however, lost the 1951 
World Series to the New York Yankees in six games. The Giants had trained 
in Phoenix since 1947 In 1951, the team swapped spring training sites with 
the New York Yankees, with the Yankees moving to Phoenix and the Giants 
training at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was a one-year 
arrangement and the Giants would return to Phoenix in 1952.[2] Center fielder 
Willie Mays made his major league debut in a game against the Philadelphia 
Phillies on May 25.[6] He went on to win the 1951 National League Rookie 
of the Year Award. Outfielder Monte Irvin led the league in RBI with 121. 
Five players on the 1951 Giants team went on to become major league managers.[7] 
Eddie Stanky (1952), Bill Rigney (1956), Alvin Dark (1961), Wes Westrum 
(1965) and Whitey Lockman (1972).[7] In June, future NFL Hall of Famer 
Andy Robustelli was offered a tryout with the New York Giants. The Giants 
offered Robustelli a $400 contract to play with Class AA Knoxville.[8] 
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] After a slow start, the team went 50–12 
over their final 62 games to complete one of the biggest comebacks in major 
league history. Longstanding rumors that the Giants engaged in systematic 
sign stealing during the second half of the 1951 season were confirmed 
in 2001. Several players told the Wall Street Journal that beginning on 
July 20, the team used a telescope, manned by coach Herman Franks in the 
Giants clubhouse behind center field, to steal the finger signals of those 
opposing catchers who left their signs unprotected. Stolen signs were relayed 
to the Giants dugout via a buzzer wire.[9] Joshua Prager, the author of 
the Journal article, outlined the evidence in greater detail in a 2008 
book.[10] He noted that sign stealing, then as now, is not specifically 
forbidden by MLB rules and, moral issues aside, "...has been a part of 
baseball since its inception".[11] At the end of the season, they were 
tied with their arch-rivals, the Dodgers, for first place in the League, 
prompting a three-game playoff for the pennant. The Giants had home field 
advantage for the series. The first game of the series was played at Ebbets 
Field. Jim Hearn started for the Giants against Ralph Branca for the Dodgers. 
Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson homered for the Giants, powering them to 
a 3–1 win. Andy Pafko hit a home run for the only Dodgers run.[12] The 
series moved to the Polo Grounds for game two. Sheldon Jones took the mound 
for the Giants against the Dodgers' Clem Labine. Jones was pulled in the 
third inning despite giving up just two runs, one of which was a Jackie 
Robinson homer. However, the game went downhill from there, as the Dodgers 
abused relievers George Spencer and Al Corwin for eight more runs, while 
Labine pitched a six-hit shutout for a 10–0 shellacking. Pafko hit his 
second homer of the series, while Gil Hodges and Rube Walker added home 
runs of their own.[13] Game three was also held at the Polo Grounds. Sal 
"The Barber" Maglie was on the mound for New York, while Brooklyn called 
on Don Newcombe. After Maglie walked two batters in the top of the first, 
Jackie Robinson singled home the game's first run. The score remained 1–0 
until the bottom of the seventh. In that inning, Monte Irvin led off with 
a double for the Giants. He was bunted over to third, and scored on a sacrifice 
fly by Bobby Thomson.[14] In the top of the eighth, the Dodgers came roaring 
back with three runs off Maglie. A pair of singles, a wild pitch, and two 
more singles made the score 4–1 Dodgers. Newcombe set down the Giants in 
order in the bottom of the eighth, while Larry Jansen did the same in relief 
of Maglie.[14] In the bottom of the ninth, Alvin Dark led off with a single, 
and Don Mueller followed with another. After Monte Irvin popped out to 
first base, Whitey Lockman lined a double to left-center field, scoring 
Dark and putting Mueller on third. Dodger manager Chuck Dressen summoned 
game 1 starter Ralph Branca in to relieve Newcombe, despite having only 
had one day's rest. On his second pitch, Bobby Thomson drove a pitch to 
deep left field for a walk-off home run to clinch the pennant for the Giants.[14] 
This home run, hit at 3:58 p.m. EST on October 3, 1951, came to be known 
as the "Shot Heard 'Round the World". The phrase shot heard 'round the 
world is from a classic poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, originally used to 
refer to the first clash of the American Revolutionary War and since used 
to apply to other dramatic moments, military and otherwise. In the case 
of Thomson's home run, it was particularly apt as U.S. servicemen fighting 
in the Korean War listened to the radio broadcast of the game. Thomson's 
homer, and the Giants' victory, are also sometimes known as the Miracle 
of Coogan's Bluff. Polo Grounds Infielders Other batters Coaches Note:
