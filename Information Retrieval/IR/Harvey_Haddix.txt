Harvey Haddix, Jr. (September 18, 1925 – January 8, 1994) was a Major League 
Baseball left-handed pitcher who played with the St. Louis Cardinals (1952–56), 
Philadelphia Phillies (1956–57), Cincinnati Redlegs (1958), Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1959–63) and Baltimore Orioles (1964–65). Haddix was born in Medway, 
Ohio, located just outside Springfield. He was nicknamed "The Kitten" in 
St. Louis for his resemblance to Harry "The Cat" Brecheen, a left-hander 
on the Cardinals during Haddix's rookie campaign.[1] Haddix is likely best 
known for pitching 12 perfect innings in a game against the Milwaukee Braves 
on May 26, 1959; the Pirates lost the game in the 13th. Haddix enjoyed 
his best season in 1953 pitching for St. Louis. He compiled a 20-9 record 
with 163 strikeouts, a 3.06 ERA, 19 complete games and six shutouts. After 
five-plus seasons with the Cardinals, he was traded to the Phillies. He 
also pitched for Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and finished as an effective 
reliever with the Orioles.[1] He was on the Pirate team that won the 1960 
World Series, and was the winning pitcher of Game Seven as a reliever, 
the Pirates winning the game on Bill Mazeroski's walk-off home run in the 
bottom of the ninth. Haddix will always be remembered for taking a perfect 
game into the 13th inning against the Milwaukee Braves on May 26, 1959. 
Haddix retired 36 consecutive batters in 12 innings essentially relying 
on two pitches: fastball and slider.[2][3] However, Braves pitcher Lew 
Burdette was also pitching a shutout.[1] A fielding error by third baseman 
Don Hoak ended the perfect game in the bottom of the 13th, with the leadoff 
batter for Milwaukee, Félix Mantilla, reaching first base. Mantilla later 
advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Eddie Mathews, which was followed 
by an intentional walk to Hank Aaron. Joe Adcock then hit an apparent home 
run, ending the no-hitter and the game. However, in the confusion, Aaron 
left the basepaths and was passed by Adcock for the second out and the 
Braves won 2-0. Eventually the hit was changed from a home run to a double 
by a ruling from National League president Warren Giles; only Mantilla's 
run counted, for a score of 1-0, but the Pirates and Haddix still lost.[1][4][5] 
Haddix's 12 2/3-inning, one-hit complete game, against the team that had 
just represented the NL in the previous two World Series, is considered 
by many to be the best pitching performance in major league history.[1][6] 
Mazeroski later said of Haddix's dominance in the game, "Usually you have 
one or two great or spectacular defensive plays in these no-hitters. Not 
that night. It was the easiest game I ever played in."[1] After the game, 
Haddix received many letters of congratulations and support, as well as 
one from a Texas A&M fraternity which read, in its entirety on university 
stationery, "Dear Harvey, Tough shit." "It made me mad", recounted Haddix, 
"until I realized they were right. That's exactly what it was."[1][7][8][9] 
In 1991, Major League Baseball changed the definition of a no-hitter to 
"a game in which a pitcher or pitchers complete a game of nine innings 
or more without allowing a hit;" the rule's formalization had the effect 
of proclaiming Adcock's drive singularly fatal to Haddix's no-hit bid, 
irrespective of the score or the game's ultimate outcome. Despite his having 
thrown more perfect innings than anyone in a single game, Haddix's game 
was taken off the list of perfect games. Haddix's response was "It's O.K. 
I know what I did."[1] Some years later, Milwaukee's Bob Buhl revealed 
that the Braves pitchers had been stealing signs from Pittsburgh catcher 
Smoky Burgess, who was exposing his hand signals due to a high crouch. 
From their bullpen, Braves pitchers repeatedly repositioned a towel to 
signal for a fastball or a breaking ball, the only two pitches Haddix used 
in the game. Despite this assistance, the usually solid Milwaukee offense 
managed just the one hit.[1][10] All but one Milwaukee hitter, Aaron, took 
the signals.[1] Over his 14-year career, Haddix had a 136-113 record with 
1,575 strikeouts, a 3.63 ERA, 99 complete games, 21 shutouts, 21 saves, 
and 2,235 innings pitched in 453 games (285 as a starter).[11] He was in 
the spotlight in the 1960 World Series against the Yankees. After winning 
Game 5 as a starter, Haddix was a reliever in Game 7 and won when Bill 
Mazeroski hit his famous home run.[1] Harvey Haddix later followed his 
namesake Brecheen into the ranks of major league pitching coaches, working 
with the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, 
and Pirates. He died from emphysema in 1994 in Springfield, Ohio, at the 
age of 68.[1][12] Haddix's near-perfect game is memorialized by The Baseball 
Project, whose song, "Harvey Haddix", appears on their debut album, Volume 
1: Frozen Ropes and Dying Quails (2008). Haddix Field, the little league
