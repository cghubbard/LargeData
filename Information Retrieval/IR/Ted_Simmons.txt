Ted Lyle Simmons (born August 9, 1949 in Highland Park, Michigan) is an 
American former professional baseball player and coach.[1] A switch-hitter, 
Simmons was a catcher for most of his Major League Baseball career with 
the St. Louis Cardinals (1968–80), the Milwaukee Brewers (1981–85) and 
the Atlanta Braves (1986–88).[1] Although he was often overshadowed by 
his contemporary, Johnny Bench, Simmons is considered one of the best hitting 
catchers in Major League baseball history.[2] While he didn't possess Bench's 
power hitting ability, he hit for a higher batting average.[3] A volatile 
competitor with an intense desire to win, Simmons once fought with teammate 
John Denny during a game at Busch Memorial Stadium, in the runway between 
the club house and the dugout.[4] Simmons was selected by the St. Louis 
Cardinals as their first round pick in the 1967 Major League Baseball draft.[5] 
He made his major league debut with the Cardinals, appearing in two games 
during the 1968 pennant-winning season, while playing most of the year 
in the minor leagues.[1] Simmons spent another year in Triple-A baseball 
before returning to the major leagues in 1970 where he platooned alongside 
catcher Joe Torre.[6] In 1971, the Cardinals converted Torre into a third 
baseman and Simmons took over as their starting catcher, posting a .304 
batting average with 7 home runs and 77 runs batted in.[1][7] He finished 
16th in balloting for the 1971 National League Most Valuable Player Award 
as the Cardinals finished in second place behind the Pittsburgh Pirates 
in the National League Eastern Division.[8][9] Simmons refused to sign 
a contract for the amount of salary offered by the Cardinals in 1972, electing 
to play without a contract.[10] He ultimately signed a contract well into 
the season during which he was recognized as one of the top catchers in 
the league by earning a spot as a reserve on the 1972 National League All-Star 
team.[11] He finished the year with a .303 batting average with 16 home 
runs and 96 runs batted in, breaking Walker Cooper's team record for RBIs 
by a catcher and, set the team record for home runs by a catcher, previously 
held jointly by Gene Oliver and Tim McCarver.[1][10] His defense began 
to improve as well, posting a .991 fielding percentage and leading National 
League catchers in assists and in putouts.[12] Despite the Cardinals finishing 
the season in fourth place, Simmons would finish in 10th place in the National 
League Most Valuable Player Award balloting.[13][14] Simmons continued 
to produce offensively in 1973 with a .310 batting average, along with 
13 home runs and 91 runs batted in.[1] He also led the league's catchers 
in putouts and finished second in assists, earning his second All-Star 
berth as the Cardinals again finished the season in second place.[15][16] 
In 1975, Simmons hit 18 home runs along with 100 runs batted and posted 
a career-high .332 batting average, finishing second in the National League 
batting championship behind Bill Madlock.[1][17] He also set a National 
League single-season record for most hits by a catcher with 188.[1][3] 
He finished in 6th place in the National League Most Valuable Player Award 
balloting as the Cardinals ended the season in fourth place.[18][19] Simmons 
broke Johnny Bench's nine-year stranglehold as the starting catcher for 
the National League All-Star team when he was elected to be the starting 
catcher for the National League in the 1978 All-Star Game.[20] Simmons 
led the Cardinals in RBIs every year from 1972 until 1978.[21] He had another 
strong year in 1980, hitting .303 with 21 home runs and 98 runs batted 
in to win the inaugural Silver Slugger Award which is awarded annually 
to the best offensive player at each position.[1][22] After feuding with 
Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog, Simmons was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers 
in December 1980.[23][24] His batting averaged fell to .216 in his first 
season in the American League but, he rebounded in 1982 with a .269 batting 
average with 23 home runs and 96 runs batted and led American League catchers 
with a .995 fielding percentage in 121 games.[1][25] The Brewers clinched 
the American League Eastern Division title, then defeated the California 
Angels in the 1982 American League Championship Series.[26] Simmons met 
his old team, the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1982 World Series, hitting 
two home runs before the Brewers lost in a seven-game series.[27] Simmons 
had one more good year in 1983 when he hit for a .308 batting average with 
13 home runs and 108 runs batted in and earned his eighth and final All-Star 
berth.[1][28] His batting average fell to .221 in 1984 and in March 1986 
he was traded to the Atlanta Braves.[1][24] He spent three seasons with 
the Braves as a utility player and pinch hitter before retiring as a player 
in 1988.[1] In a twenty-one-year major league career, Simmons played in 
2,456 games, accumulating 2,472 hits in 8,680 at bats for a .285 career 
batting average along with 248 home runs, 1,389 runs batted in and a .348 
on-base percentage.[1] He ended his career with a .986 fielding percentage.[1] 
An eight-time All-Star, he batted above .300 seven times, reached 20 home 
runs six times, and eight times exceeded 90 runs batted in. He switch-hit 
home runs in a game three times and established a since-broken National 
League career record for home runs by a switch-hitter (182).[23][29] Simmons 
held major league records for catchers with 2,472 career hits and 483 doubles, 
since broken by Iván Rodríguez. He ranks second all-time among catchers 
with 1,389 runs batted in and 10th with 248 home runs.[23] He caught 122 
shutouts in his career, ranking him eighth all-time among major league 
catchers.[30] In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, 
baseball historian Bill James ranked Simmons 10th all-time among major 
league catchers.[31] In 1992, Simmons was hired as general manager of the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. He served in that position for only a year, retiring 
after suffering a heart attack in June 1993. In Spring training 1992 Simmons 
had agreed to trade left fielder Barry Bonds to the Atlanta Braves, but 
backed out when Pirates manager Jim Leyland threatened to quit. He also 
was Director of Player Development for both the Cardinals and San Diego 
Padres, and a scout at the Major League level for the Cleveland Indians. 
He was named the bench coach for the Milwaukee Brewers starting with the 
2010 season. On September 15, 2010, he was reassigned to another position 
within the organization.[34] In November 2008 Simmons was named bench coach 
for the Padres under manager Bud Black, replacing Craig Colbert.[35] He 
was hired on November 5, 2010 as a senior advisor to general manager Jack 
Zduriencik of the Seattle Mariners.[36] Simmons rejoined the Braves in
