Jason Scott Marquis (/mɑːrˈkiː/; born August 21, 1978) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago 
Cubs, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, Arizona Diamondbacks, San 
Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins and Cincinnati Reds. As a 12-year-old, Marquis 
pitched his team to third place in the Little League World Series with 
a no-hitter. He is one of only a few ballplayers to have played in both 
a Little League World Series and a Major League World Series.[1] He also 
pitched his high school team to consecutive New York City baseball championships. 
Marquis was drafted in the first round out of high school by the world 
champion Atlanta Braves, and reached the majors as a 21-year-old in 2000. 
As a major leaguer, Marquis won 11 or more games for six straight years 
through 2009, and also started 28 or more games in each of the years 2004–09. 
His 65 wins from 2004 to 2008 ranked 7th among N.L. pitchers.[2] He pitched 
on a World Series champion in 2006, and was an All-Star in 2009. Through 
2011, in his career in games that were late and close, Marquis held batters 
to a .228 batting average.[3] He also excelled with the bat, winning the 
Silver Slugger Award in 2005. Marquis was born in Manhasset, New York, 
and grew up in Staten Island, New York's Arden Heights neighborhood, where 
he attended Paulo Intermediate School 75.[1] His mother works for the New 
York City Board of Education, and has a teaching degree, while his father 
owns a check cashing business in Brooklyn.[4] He was a New York Yankees 
fan growing up, and Don Mattingly was his favorite player.[4] Marquis, 
who is Jewish, grew up in a Conservative Jewish home, attended Hebrew school, 
and observes the major Jewish holidays.[5][6][7] "My mother was a bit more 
stricter with our Jewish upbringing", said Marquis, "given that her parents 
were Holocaust survivors."[8] Marquis was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 
75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards, published 
in affiliation with Fleer Trading Cards and the American Jewish Historical 
Society, commemorating the Jewish Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008.[9] 
He joined, among other Jewish major leaguers, Brad Ausmus, Kevin Youkilis, 
Ian Kinsler, Ryan Braun, Gabe Kapler, Scott Feldman, John Grabow, Craig 
Breslow, Jason Hirsh, and Scott Schoeneweis.[10] Through 2014, he was third 
all-time in career wins and strikeouts (behind Ken Holtzman and Sandy Koufax 
in both categories) among Jewish major league baseball players.[11] Marquis 
starred in Little League Baseball on the South Shore Little League team 
that finished second in the US, and third in the world, in the Little League 
World Series in 1991.[4][12] He led his team to a victory in the first 
round over Chad Pennington and his Ohio team, as Marquis celebrated his 
13th birthday by throwing a three-hitter, striking out 11, not allowing 
a walk, and adding three hits and three RBIs.[13] His team lost to California 
in the US final on ESPN, as Marquis was relegated to shortstop because 
Little Leaguers weren't allowed to pitch two days in a row.[14] Marquis 
then led his team to victory over Canada in the third-place game, throwing 
a no-hitter.[4] "Playing in front of that many people at that time in my 
life made me realize this is what I wanted to do with my life", said Marquis, 
"and I was going to work my hardest to get it."[4] As of October 2008, 
he was one of 31 Little League World Series players to have reached the 
major leagues.[15] His bar mitzvah had a baseball theme, as his parents 
surprised him with a replica scoreboard, 15 or 20 feet wide by 15 feet 
tall, of the game line from his Little League World Series no-hitter against 
Canada.[4] "When I was a freshman [in high school] I was 5' 2", and everyone 
thought I was too small to play", Marquis said. "But it was always my dream 
to play major league baseball, and I've always worked very hard at it."[16] 
As a 6' 1" junior and senior, however, Marquis threw a 93 miles per hour 
fastball, a curveball that was nearly unhittable at the high school level, 
and a changeup.[17] He pitched the Tottenville High School Pirates to two 
consecutive New York City Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) titles. 
The first was a Pirates (22–1) championship in 1995 over the George Washington 
Trojans (32–3), 3–2 at Shea Stadium, capping a season in which he posted 
an 11–0 record while striking out 86 batters in 61 innings.[16][18] The 
second championship was in 1996 when the Pirates were 33–1; again over 
the George Washington Trojans (41–2). He pitched his team to a 5–1, 7-inning 
complete game victory in which he struck out 15 batters and did not allow 
any earned runs, while he himself hit a two-run triple, at Yankee Stadium.[19] 
That capped a season in which he was 14–1 with a 0.40 ERA, and struck out 
150 in 79 innings, while as a batter he tied a school season record with 
11 home runs, drove in 45 runs, and batted .468.[16] He received the Iron 
Horse Award as the top baseball player in the PSAL, The New York Daily 
News Player of the Year Award, and was named 1st team High School All-American.[16][20][21] 
Anthony McCarron of The New York Daily News touted him as "perhaps the 
city's best high school player since ... Manny Ramirez", and Baseball America 
ranked him the 39th-highest prospect in the nation.[22][23] He also played 
basketball at Tottenville, and on the academic side was a member of the 
National Honor Society.[24][25] One of his classmates at Tottenville was 
Chicago Bears defensive end Adewale Ogunleye.[26] The right-hander originally 
signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Miami, which offered 
him a scholarship.[16] The day of the 1996 draft, he was pitching in a 
high school playoff game, so his mother stayed home to wait for the phone 
call, and then showed up at his game in the second inning.[4] She relayed 
the message that he had been drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first 
round, the 35th selection overall.[4] Marquis was excited, and his team 
won the game and went on to win the city championship.[4] He then opted 
out of his letter of intent, and signed with the Braves on July 18, 1996, 
for a reported $600,000 ($907,000 today) signing bonus.[24][27] In 1996 
Marquis began his pro career with the Danville Braves (Rookie Advanced) 
in the Appalachian League, going 1–1 with a 4.63 ERA in 7 games.[24][28] 
He had 24 strikeouts and gave up 7 walks in 23 innings.[29] The next year 
he tied for the South Atlantic League lead with a team-record 14 victories 
for the Macon Braves, as he went 14–10 with a 4.38 ERA, tied for second 
in the league with 28 starts, and was named the Braves' fifth-rated prospect 
by Baseball America.[24][25][28][30] "He's like a man on a mission to get 
to the big leagues", said Mark Ross, the Macon pitching coach. "He's doing 
great."[27] In 1998 he began the season as youngest pitcher in the Carolina 
League, but won only 2 of 22 starts for Class A Danville 97s, as he went 
2–12 and struck out 135 in 114.2 innings, while walking only 41.[24][25] 
Marquis began the 1999 season at Class A Myrtle Beach Pelicans of the Carolina 
League, where he opened the season by firing 20.0 consecutive scoreless 
innings.[25] Marquis was named Baseball America Carolina League Player 
of the Week for the period April 15–21, as he pitched 10.0 innings, striking 
out 11.[31] He allowed only one earned run in 6 starts (3–0, 0.28 ERA) 
before being promoted on May 10 to the Double-A Greenville Braves, and 
was named the Braves' sixth-rated prospect by Baseball America.[25][28] 
With Greenville he went 3–4, 4.58 in 12 starts. He spent much of the summer 
on the disabled list (DL) with a sore elbow, a tender right shoulder, and 
a pulled oblique stomach muscle.[24][29] In 2000 Baseball America named 
him the Braves' fifth-rated prospect, and he split time between Double-A 
Greenville (going 4–2 with a 3.57 ERA), the Triple-A Richmond Braves, and 
Atlanta (15 games in relief; a 5.01 ERA).[25][28][29] Marquis spent much 
of 2003 back in the minors, where his overall record at Richmond was 8–4, 
with a 3.35 ERA in 15 games (all starts).[25] Marquis was called up to 
the majors by the Braves in June 2000, at the age of 21 the 10th-youngest 
player in the NL,[32] after the Braves demoted struggling closer John Rocker 
for threatening a reporter.[24] He made his debut on June 6, 2000, in relief 
of Tom Glavine against the Toronto Blue Jays.[24] "Getting that first call 
and running out to the mound", said Marquis, "I promise you I didn't feel 
my legs at all."[4] He was later sent back down to AAA Richmond, but was 
recalled again in September. During the 2000 season he appeared strictly 
in relief, finishing 7 games in his 15 appearances, and winning 1. He became 
a starting pitcher in 2001, joining a celebrated staff with Greg Maddux, 
Tom Glavine, and Kevin Millwood. The 9/11 attack that interrupted the season 
also led to the death of one of his Little League World Series teammates, 
Michael Cammarata, a firefighter. "It's tough knowing that people died 
who were part of your life at one point", Marquis said. Marquis was the 
starting pitcher for the Braves in the first game played in New York City 
after 9/11.[33] In his first year as a starter, Marquis held batters to 
a .145 batting average with runners in scoring position, and 2 out. The 
club's front office made it clear that he was off-limits in trade talks, 
saying: "He's going to be a big-time No. 1 pitcher. You don't give up an 
arm like that."[34] He maintained a spot on the rotation again in 2002 
as the fifth starter, behind Maddux, Glavine, Millwood, and Damian Moss. 
In 2003, the Braves revamped their starting rotation with the acquisitions 
of Mike Hampton, Russ Ortiz, Shane Reynolds, and the promotion of Horacio 
Ramírez from AA. Marquis was sent to the bullpen. He was upset about being 
sent to the bullpen, and requested to be sent to the minors where he could 
be a starting pitcher, and observed by scouts from other organizations. 
Ultimately, he split his season, making only 2 starts in 21 appearances 
for Atlanta, while starting 15 games for Richmond in AAA. On December 13, 
2003, Marquis was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals along with relief pitcher 
Ray King and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright for outfielder J. D. Drew 
and catcher Eli Marrero. Looking back years later, Marquis said: "I was 
pretty young ... and I think it really shook me, to realize that nothing 
was forever."[35] Marquis became a full-time starter in 2004 with the Cardinals, 
and came under the wing of pitching coach Dave Duncan who observed that 
Marquis "always had a devastating skinner (sinker), and ... needs to get 
back to it more." "It's just the pitch I had growing up, and I got away 
from it", Marquis said.[36] He stole a base against former Atlanta Braves 
teammate and mentor Greg Maddux on May 3, who also stole a base in the 
same game.[25] It marked the first time since June 11, 1950, when Warren 
Spahn of the Braves and Bob Rush of the Cubs pulled it off, that opposing 
pitchers stole a base in the same game.[37][38] Marquis strung together 
a Cardinals' season-high 11-game winning streak from May 31 – September 
4, the longest by a Cards pitcher since 1985 when John Tudor also won 11 
straight games.[25] He had a shutout streak of 18⅓ innings from August 
24 – September 10.[39] On the business side, the Cardinals players elected 
him their # 2 representative to the Major League Baseball Players Association.[40] 
For the season, Marquis posted a career-best 15–9 record, with a 3.71 ERA 
and a career-high 138 strikeouts, for the National League champions. He 
was 2nd in the NL in ground ball/fly ball ratio (2.17), tied for 5th in 
percentage of strikes that were "looking" (31%), 6th in pitches per start 
(104), 8th in won-lost percentage (.682), 9th in wins (15), and tied for 
10th in double plays induced (21).[3][25] He held batters to a .198 batting 
average with runners in scoring position,[37] and a .163 batting average 
with 2 outs and runners in scoring position.[3] Marquis tossed a scoreless 
inning of relief in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series at Boston, and Manager 
Tony La Russa tabbed Marquis to start Game 4. He turned in the best performance 
of any Cardinals starter in the series, pitching 6 innings and giving up 
3 runs.[6][37] He was bested, however, by Boston pitcher Derek Lowe, who 
threw shutout ball for 7 innings to win the series for the Red Sox.[41] 
"Whether you lose 100 games or win 100 games and go to the World Series, 
the last day of the season you're still looking around and saying, 'The 
season is over? What do I do now?' " said Marquis as he stuffed jerseys 
into a duffel bag. "It's hard to handle."[42] After the season he was a 
member of MLB's roster for the Japan All-Star Series from November 5–14, 
and appeared in two games out of the bullpen, allowing three earned runs 
in 6.2 innings.[25] Marquis had an up-and-down season in 2005. Although 
he started the season strong, he slid into a personal 7-game losing streak. 
It ended on August 27, 2005, when Marquis pitched a 2-hitter against the 
Washington Nationals, for his first career shutout. Overall Marquis posted 
a 13–14 record, with a 4.13 ERA in 207 innings pitched.[37] He appeared 
in 33 games, starting 32, and completing 3 (6th in the NL). He gave up 
the second-lowest percentage of line drives in the NL (17.3%), induced 
29 double plays (T-4th in the league), and was 4th with 1.26 GIDP/9 IP.[25][43] 
In the postseason he worked out of the bullpen in the NLCS, after not being 
used in the Division Series, and pitched in three games, finished with 
a 3.38 ERA.[25] In January 2006, Marquis and the Cardinals agreed to a 
1-year contract for $5.15 million, avoiding salary arbitration.[44] The 
season started off well for Marquis, as on July 23 he became the first 
NL pitcher to win 12 games, raising his record to 12–7.[45] But Marquis 
followed with a losing second half of the season. Pitching in the starting 
rotation all year, Marquis finished 14–16, but with a 6.02 ERA, the 2nd-worst 
in baseball among players who qualified for the ERA title (Joel Piñeiro, 
of the Seattle Mariners, finished last with a 6.36 ERA). He led the majors 
in runs allowed (136), and led the NL in losses (16) and home runs allowed 
(35). He also had the two worst game scores in the NL, a game against the 
White Sox on June 21 in which he gave up 13 earned runs in 5 innings as 
Tony La Russa left him in to save a weary bullpen, and one against the 
Braves 3 weeks later in which Marquis allowed 12 earned runs in 5 innings.[46] 
"Obviously, those were tough pills to swallow", Marquis said. "I took one 
for the team."[47] On the other hand, in games that were late and close, 
he held batters to a .188 batting average.[3] Marquis was on the Cardinals 
roster for their first-round playoff matchup against the San Diego Padres, 
but did not make an appearance in the series and was not included on the 
roster for either the NLCS or for the 2006 World Series, which the Cardinals 
won. "Obviously, I'm very disappointed", he said.[48] "[The] year was a 
little bittersweet", he said. "Because you bust your butt for three years 
for a manager, you give it your all and don't complain, and you contribute 
so much in the regular season, then to have it taken away in the postseason 
... But managers are going to make their decisions. You really can't question 
them or change them because they're going to do what they want anyway. 
You have to go out there and work hard and be thankful for what you have."[4] 
His teammates still voted him a full playoff/World Series share.[49] He 
was also given a World Series ring.[50] In December 2006 Marquis signed 
a 3-year contract with the Chicago Cubs worth $21 million.[6] With the 
Cubs, he wore his favorite # 21, the number formerly worn by ex-Cubs slugger 
Sammy Sosa, who coincidentally hit his 600th home run against Marquis.[6] 
This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, 
including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.[51] On May 
9, Marquis completed a three-hit shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
defeating them 1–0. He had a perfect game going into the 6th inning, retiring 
the first 16 batters he faced, but Pirates shortstop Don Kelly broke it 
up with a single. The game took only 2 hours and 6 minutes. Marquis struck 
out 5, and needed only 109 pitches to complete the game. "His ball was 
diving and darting. He was awesome", said teammate Jacque Jones.[52] The 
win improved Marquis' record to 5–1, and dropped his ERA to 1.70, 3rd-best 
in the NL. After the game, Marquis highlighted his consistency as being 
the key to his turnaround. "My delivery is as consistent as it's ever been. 
I feel like I'm repeating the same delivery over and over again and that's 
the reason, I really believe, for the success."[53] Yom Kippur, the Jewish 
day of atonement, was September 21, and Marquis was glad to be slated to 
pitch the day prior in a day game, as he expected to be done before sundown. 
"I look at it that religion is an important part of my life, but so is 
family and baseball", Marquis said. "To me, family takes precedent [sic] 
over all aspects of my life. Baseball and religion fall into place, and 
I try not to make one more important than the other." Marquis did have 
to pitch on the holiday when he was with the Braves. It was his turn, and 
he did not want to throw the rotation out of order. "I pitched, went to 
temple the next morning", Marquis said. "It was a day game. Bobby [Cox, 
Atlanta manager] allowed me to show up late. It turned out well."[54][55] 
In 2007 Marquis was 12–9, with a 4.60 ERA. He was tied for 2nd in the league 
in shutouts (1), was 5th in the league in hit batsmen (13), had the 5th-lowest 
batting average in the NL of balls hit into play against him (.280), and 
had the 8th-highest ground ball percentage (49.5%).[56] He kept batters 
to a .229 batting average in games that were late and close.[37] On March 
24, 2008, it was announced he would be the Cubs' fifth starter for the 
2008 season.[57] Historically, Marquis' numbers during the second half 
of the season were not as good as his numbers during the first half, but 
thanks to smart managing by Lou Piniella, Marquis and Rich Harden, newly 
acquired from the Oakland Athletics on July 8, rotated their starts for 
a time, and Marquis posted a winning month of August, going 3–1 with a 
3.90 ERA. It was his second-lowest ERA after a 3.81 ERA in July. He finished 
the season 11–9, with a 4.53 ERA, and held batters to a .192 batting average 
with 2 outs and runners in scoring position.[3] On September 26, 2008, 
the Cubs post-season roster was announced, and Marquis was granted a roster 
spot as a reliever.[58] Marquis thereby reached the playoffs in all nine 
of his major league seasons through 2008.[59] He made one appearance against 
the Dodgers in Game 1 of the National League Division Series, when he pitched 
the top of the ninth inning. In it he gave up a solo home run to Russell 
Martin for the Dodgers' seventh and final run of the game — one they'd 
win by a final score of 7–2.[60] On January 6, 2009, Marquis was traded 
to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Luis Vizcaíno.[61] General Manager 
Dan O'Dowd said: "We like (Marquis') athleticism, age and durability."[35][62] 
During the off-season, Marquis tweaked his delivery to improve his release 
point by staying over the rubber longer in his balance point, allowing 
his arm to catch up, resulting in a 2 to 3 inches longer stride, and leaving 
him on top of the ball and throwing downhill.[63][64] Reporters attributed 
his first-half success to his new delivery and his high ground ball ratio.[65][66] 
On June 30 Marquis pitched a 2-hit, 0-walk, 17-ground-ball-outs, 86-pitch 
shutout to become the first 10-game winner in the NL. A reporter for MLB.com 
called it "one of the best pitching performances in Rockies history", and 
Rob Neyer of ESPN described Marquis that night as "Bob Gibson, Orel Hershiser, 
and Greg Maddux all rolled into one".[67][68] He beat the LA Dodgers, which 
had the best record in the major leagues, and outpitched their ace Chad 
Billingsley 3–0 in a matchup of pitchers leading the league in wins. It 
was his third career shutout, and his second complete game of the season. 
He also drove in two of his team's three runs.[69] "That was something 
special, as good as I have seen in my 7½ years behind this desk", said 
Rockies manager Jim Tracy.[70] On July 5, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, 
who managed the NL squad, chose Marquis to be on the NL All Star team, 
the fifth Rockies pitcher to be an All Star.[71][72] "This is something 
... I'll cherish the rest of my life", said Marquis.[73] The next day Marquis 
followed up his shutout of the Dodgers with 8 shutout innings in a 1–0 
victory over the Nationals, for a major-league-leading 11th win.[74] He 
became the third pitcher in club history to win 11 games before the All 
Star break, the team record, joining Shawn Chacón (2003) and Aaron Cook 
(2008).[75] At the 2009 All Star Game, Marquis (a former Cardinal) received 
one of the biggest ovations during pregame introductions of any non-Cardinal 
player, and then warmed up in the ninth inning but never did enter the 
game.[76] He received a $75,000 bonus for making the team, and he and teammate 
Brad Hawpe bought 30 bats and 50 All Star Game shirts for the Rockies players, 
and Marquis purchased game jerseys for all the coaches, trainers, and clubhouse 
staff. "I want them to know how much they are appreciated", he said. "They 
helped us get here."[77] On August 19, Marquis joined Adam Wainwright as 
the only 14-game winners in the NL, and tied for the major league lead.[78] 
In 2009, Marquis was 2nd in the NL in ground ball outs induced (353) and 
ground balls induced (408), tied for 2nd in double plays induced (28), 
3rd in ground ball percentage (55.6%), 3rd-lowest in pitches per plate 
appearance (3.53), tied for 4th in wins (15), 8th in innings pitched (216.0) 
and home runs per 9 innings pitched (.625), 4th-lowest in pitches per inning 
(15.0; of NL pitchers with 160 or more innings), and tied for 6th in shutouts 
(1).[3][79][80][81] At the plate, Marquis tied for 3rd in the major leagues 
among pitchers in runs scored (7), and tied for 6th in doubles (3) and 
RBIs (8).[82] Marquis is one of only six major league pitchers who won 
at least 11 games in each year from 2004 to 2009,[83] the others being 
CC Sabathia, Derek Lowe, Johan Santana, Javier Vázquez, and John Lackey. 
He never started fewer than 29 games during that span.[84] When the Rockies 
qualified for the post-season in 2009, it marked the 10th time in 10 years 
(every year of his major league career) that the team for which he pitched 
made the playoffs.[85] He became the first player in baseball history to 
have been on a playoff team in each of the first 10 years of his career 
while playing for at least three different teams.[86] After the 2009 season 
Marquis became a free agent. The Rockies offered him arbitration,[87] but 
he rejected their offer of a one-year, non-guaranteed deal for the possibility 
that he will receive a multi-year deal.[88] On December 22, 2009, Marquis 
signed a 2-year, $15 million contract with the Washington Nationals for 
the 2010 and 2011 seasons.[89] Marquis had 3 starts early in the 2010 season 
for the Nationals, posting an 0–3 record with a 20.52 ERA before being 
placed on the 15-day DL on April 22, 2010, with bone chips in his right 
elbow.[90] He returned to action on August 8, 2010.[91] He was much improved 
upon returning from his injury, but still finished the season a disappointing 
2–9 with a 6.60 ERA. Marquis started 20 games for the Nationals in 2011, 
going 8–5 with a 3.95 ERA.[92] On July 30, 2011, Marquis was traded to 
the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor league infielder Zach Walters.[92][93] 
On August 14, Marquis had his fibula broken by a comebacker and was out 
for the remainder of the season. Marquis signed a one-year, $3 million 
contract with the Minnesota Twins on December 22, 2011.[94] He was designated 
for assignment in May, after posting an 8.47 ERA in his seven starts.[95] 
On May 26, 2012, Marquis was released, allowing him to sign with any team. 
Marquis signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on May 
29, 2012, and was assigned to their Double-A affiliate in San Antonio. 
After one minor league start, he was promoted to the major league club 
and made his first start as a Padre on June 7 at home against the San Francisco 
Giants. Marquis recorded his 1000th career major league strikeout on June 
18 against Ian Kinsler of the Texas Rangers in the second inning of an 
interleague game at Petco Park.[96] The highlight game of Marquis' season 
was a 2-hit shutout pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 11. 
Marquis took a no-hitter into the 7th inning before it was broken up by 
a Travis Snider infield single.[97] On August 21, Marquis took a comebacker 
off the heel of his glove hand, breaking his wrist.[98] Although Marquis 
continued to pitch in the game, the broken wrist ended his 2012 season. 
Marquis finished with a 6–7 record and 4.04 ERA in 15 starts for the Padres, 
with 79 strikeouts and 29 walks. Marquis also upheld his reputation as 
a good hitter in 2012, collecting 9 hits, including 3 doubles, in 32 at-bats. 
The Padres re-signed Marquis in the off-season to a one-year, $3 million 
contract.[99] He opened the season as the fourth starter in the rotation. 
Marquis started the 2013 season with a 9–5 record, including winning eight 
straight decisions from April 28 to June 15. In July he suffered a complete 
tear of his ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and had Tommy 
John surgery, which ended his season.[100] He finished with a 4.05 ERA 
and 72 strikeouts in his 20 starts, but was leading the league with 68 
walks at the time of his injury. On June 3, 2014, Marquis signed a minor 
league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.[101] He was released from 
his contract after coming off the DL in late August.[102][103] On January 
21, 2015, he signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds.[104][105] 
In March 2015, Reds manager Bryan Price announced Marquis would be in the 
Reds' pitching rotation.[106] In May 2015, Marquis batted eighth in the 
lineup, the first Reds pitcher to bat higher than ninth since pitcher Red 
Lucas batted seventh for the Reds on September 7, 1933.[107] He was designated 
for assignment on June 5, 2015. He was 3–4 with a 6.46 ERA in nine starts.[108] 
When there was talk in the off-season about an Israeli team being fielded 
in the World Baseball Classic, Marquis said if it came about he would definitely 
be interested in playing to represent his heritage.[6] In September 2012 
Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic 
qualifier due to being active on a major league team. Israel was unable 
to qualify for the tournament, making it so Marquis was unable to pitch 
for Israel. Marquis pitched in the qualifying round for Israel at the 2017 
World Baseball Classic qualifier.[109] During the opening game of the qualifiers 
Marquis started and threw 41 pitches over 3 innings, while giving up 2 
hits and 1 earned run, while recording a strikeout and a walk.[110] Under 
World Baseball Classic rules any pitcher who throws over 50 pitches cannot 
pitch again for four days, therefore by pulling Marquis before reaching 
this limit, enabled Israel to utilize Marquis again in the tournament. 
Marquis again started for the final game of the qualifier and threw 43 
pitches over four perfect innings, while recording 5 strikeouts.[111] Following 
his four perfect innings Marquis stated "I try to approach every opportunity 
I get with as much passion as I can, it was definitely our goal to win 
this qualifier and get to the main event."[112] Marquis relies mostly on 
his sinker. He throws it harder than most pitchers, gets plenty of movement 
on the pitch, and throws it down in the strike zone as he tries to induce 
hitters to hit ground balls. He also relies heavily on a sharp slider. 
In his career with Atlanta, the Braves system steered Marquis to also throw 
a four-seam fastball in the mid- to high-90s, but in St. Louis he began 
to gravitate toward instead using a sinking two-seam fastball that he had 
thrown as a teenager, which he still threw in the mid-90s.[113] In addition, 
he throws an excellent occasional overhand tight curve ball, and a changeup 
which has good action.[24][114][115] Marquis, the 144th Jewish player in 
major league history, is sixth all-time in strikeouts among Jewish major 
leaguer pitchers and seventh in wins, trailing among others Sandy Koufax, 
Ken Holtzman, and Steve Stone in both categories.[116][117][118] In 2009 
he became the second Jewish pitcher to notch at least ten victories in 
six consecutive seasons, joining Koufax.[6][119] Marquis is an excellent 
hitter for his position. Though not unheard of for pitchers, Marquis is 
sometimes called upon to pinch hit, something that is extraordinarily rare 
for a modern-day pitcher. He constantly hits off the tee in batting cages.[37] 
His baserunning speed has also led to him being used as a pinch-runner.[120] 
"Watch Marquis take batting practice", wrote John Schlegel for MLB.com, 
"and you think you're watching a left-handed slugger. He can ping baseballs 
off the bleachers with the best of them. Watch him run up the first-base 
line with the speed of an outfielder and the intensity of a linebacker, 
and you can't believe he's a pitcher."[121] In 2005 he achieved two career-highs: 
a .310 batting average, and a .460 slugging percentage. In 87 at bats he 
had 27 hits, including 9 doubles, a triple, and a home run as he both scored 
10 runs and drove in 10 runs. He was the first pitcher to bat over .300 
since Mike Hampton batted .344 in 2002 (minimum of 50 at bats).[37] His 
27 hits were the most by a big-league pitcher since Rick Rhoden had 28 
in 1984, and 24 came as a pitcher and 3 as pinch-hitter.[122] His 10 extra-base 
hits were the highest extra-base hit total by a pitcher since 1986, when 
Rhoden had 10.[123] For his hitting, Marquis won the 2005 NL Pitcher Silver 
Slugger Award. His first three home runs were hit off of Wandy Rodríguez, 
Brian Lawrence, and Javier Vázquez. In 2008 he hit a career-high 2 homers 
as he again drove in 10 runs, this time in 59 at bats.[25] He belted his 
fourth home run on September 6, against Cincinnati's Gary Majewski at the 
Great American Ballpark.[124] On September 22, he hit his first career 
grand slam, off of New York Mets rookie Jon Niese at Shea Stadium. That 
night he was also credited with five RBIs — four of which came with his 
grand slam — in a career-high performance.[125] It was the first grand 
slam by a Jewish pitcher since Saul Rogovin of the Detroit Tigers hit one 
in 1950 off Eddie Lopat of the Yankees.[126] In 441 at bats through 2008 
Marquis had a .206 career batting average, with 25 doubles, 2 triples, 
5 home runs, 50 runs scored, 40 RBIs, 23 sacrifice hits, and a .306 slugging 
percentage — 9th-best of all pitchers with at least 100 at bats.[127] He 
had a .276 career batting average, in 59 plate appearances, with 2 outs 
and runners in scoring position. With the bases loaded, through August 
2008 he was a career .364 batter, with a .500 on-base percentage and an 
.818 slugging percentage. In 26 at bats as a pinch hitter, he had a .231 
batting average. Summarizing his approach to hitting, Marquis said: "I'm 
not going up as a pitcher with a bat. I'm going up as a hitter."[128] Marquis 
exhibited a better range factor at pitcher than the league average every 
year of his career, through 2009.[3] Marquis and his wife, Debbie (née
