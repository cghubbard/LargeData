Oliver Perry Caylor (December 14, 1849 – October 19, 1897) was an American 
baseball newspaper columnist for The Cincinnati Enquirer and the Cincinnati 
Commercial before becoming one of the principal figures in the founding 
of the American Association in 1881 as well as the catalyst in the formation 
of the modern-day Cincinnati Reds. Caylor was also a manager for the Cincinnati 
Red Stockings of the American Association, succeeding the original manager, 
Pop Snyder. His stint with the team was mixed, since he finished in second 
place in his 1885 debut season, but the following year, he finished with 
a losing record (65–73) and in fifth place. Caylor resigned after the 1886 
season due in large part to his combative nature that put him at odds with 
the press and new club ownership. Caylor moved to Philadelphia where he 
began writing for the Sporting Life. The New York Metropolitans then hired 
him as their manager on June 11, 1887, with Caylor inheriting a team with 
a 9–28 record. He was fired in the off-season by new owner Charlie Byrne 
after finishing the season with a dismal 35–60 record and a seventh-place 
finish. Caylor's career as a manager was over with an overall managerial 
record of 163–182 (.472 winning percentage). Caylor moved to Carthage, 
Missouri, where he proceeded to start The Daily Democrat newspaper. In 
1890, he would move back to New York City after being hired by Albert Spalding 
to be the editor for the New York Sporting Times. Caylor died in Winona, 
Minnesota at age 47 and was buried in Dayton, Ohio, the city of his birth.
