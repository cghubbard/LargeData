Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, the 12th most populous 
city in the United States and the largest city by area in the contiguous 
United States.[7] It is the county seat of Duval County,[8] with which 
the city government consolidated in 1968. Jacksonville was named after 
Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and 
seventh President of the United States. People from Jacksonville may be 
called "Jacksonvillians" or "Jaxsons" (also "Jaxons").[5][6] Consolidation 
greatly expanded Jacksonville to encompass the metropolitan population; 
with a population of 868,031 in 2015, it is the most populous city proper 
in Florida[9] and the Southeast.[10] Jacksonville is the principal city 
in the Jacksonville metropolitan area. With a population of 1,573,606 in 
2015, it is the fourth largest metropolitan area in Florida, after Miami, 
Tampa and Orlando. [11] Jacksonville is in the First Coast region of northeast 
Florida and is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River, 25 miles (40 km) 
south of the Georgia state line and 340 miles (550 km) north of Miami. 
The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast. 
The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was 
the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European 
settlements in what is now the continental United States. Under British 
rule, settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, 
known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and the Cow Ford to the British. 
A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States 
gained Florida from Spain. Harbor improvements since the late 19th century 
made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port. Its riverine 
location has two United States Navy bases and Jacksonville Port, Florida's 
third largest seaport.[12] The two US Navy bases, Blount Island Command 
and the nearby Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, form the third largest military 
presence in the United States.[13] Jacksonville's economy depends on, services: 
banking, insurance, healthcare and logistics. As with much of Florida, 
tourism is also important, particularly golf related.[14][15] Kingdom of 
France 1562–1565 Spanish Empire 1565–1763 Great Britain 1763–1783 Spanish 
Empire 1783-1821  United States 1821-1861 Confederate States of America 
1861-1862  United States 1862-Present The area of the modern city of Jacksonville 
has been inhabited for thousands of years. On Black Hammock Island in the 
national Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, a University of North 
Florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the United 
States, dating to 2500 BC.[16] In the 16th century, the beginning of the 
historical era, the region was inhabited by the Mocama, a coastal subgroup 
of the Timucua people. At the time of contact with Europeans, all Mocama 
villages in present-day Jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom 
known as the Saturiwa, centered around the mouth of the St. Johns River.[17] 
One early map shows a village called Ossachite at the site of what is now 
downtown Jacksonville; this may be the earliest recorded name for that 
area.[18] French Huguenot explorer Jean Ribault charted the St. Johns River 
in 1562 calling it the River of May because he discovered it in May. Ribault 
erected a stone column near present-day Jacksonville claiming the newly 
discovered land for France.[19] In 1564, René Goulaine de Laudonnière established 
the first European settlement, Fort Caroline, on the St. Johns near the 
main village of the Saturiwa. Philip II of Spain ordered Pedro Menéndez 
de Avilés to protect the interest of Spain by attacking the French presence 
at Fort Caroline. On September 20, 1565, a Spanish force from the nearby 
Spanish settlement of St. Augustine attacked Fort Caroline, and killed 
nearly all the French soldiers defending it.[20] The Spanish renamed the 
fort San Mateo, and following the ejection of the French, St. Augustine's 
position as the most important settlement in Florida was solidified. The 
location of Fort Caroline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of 
the fort was established on the St. Johns River in 1964.[21] Spain ceded 
Florida to the British in 1763 after the French and Indian War, and the 
British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. 
The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole 
called Wacca Pilatka and the British called the Cow Ford; these names ostensibly 
reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there.[22][23][24] 
The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits 
as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area 
prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish.[25] Britain 
ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat 
in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued 
to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 
1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan 
a town, laying out the streets and plats. They soon named the town Jacksonville, 
after Andrew Jackson. Led by Isaiah D. Hart, residents wrote a charter 
for a town government, which was approved by the Florida Legislative Council 
on February 9, 1832. During the American Civil War, Jacksonville was a 
key supply point for hogs and cattle being shipped from Florida to aid 
the Confederate cause. The city was blockaded by Union forces, who gained 
control of the nearby Fort Clinch. Though no battles were fought in Jacksonville 
proper, the city changed hands several times between Union and Confederate 
forces. The Skirmish of the Brick Church in 1862 just outside Jacksonville 
proper resulted in the first Confederate victory in Florida.[26] However, 
Union forces captured a Confederate position at the Battle of St. Johns 
Bluff leading to the Union occupation of Jacksonville in 1862. In February 
1864 Union forces left Jacksonville and confronted a Confederate Army at 
the Battle of Olustee resulting in a Confederate victory. Union forces 
then retreated to Jacksonville and held the city for the remainder of the 
war. In March 1864 a Confederate cavalry confronted a Union expedition 
resulting in the Battle of Cedar Creek. Warfare and the long occupation 
left the city disrupted after the war.[27] During Reconstruction and the 
Gilded Age, Jacksonville and nearby St. Augustine became popular winter 
resorts for the rich and famous. Visitors arrived by steamboat and later 
by railroad. President Grover Cleveland attended the Sub-Tropical Exposition 
in the city on February 22, 1888 during his trip to Florida.[28] This highlighted 
the visibility of the state as a worthy place for tourism. The city's tourism, 
however, was dealt major blows in the late 19th century by yellow fever 
outbreaks. In addition, extension of the Florida East Coast Railway further 
south drew visitors to other areas. From 1893 to 1938 Jacksonville was 
the site of the Florida Old Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Home with 
a nearby cemetery.[29] On May 3, 1901, downtown Jacksonville was ravaged 
by a fire that started as a kitchen fire. Spanish moss at a nearby mattress 
factory was quickly engulfed in flames and enabled the fire to spread rapidly. 
In just eight hours, it swept through 146 city blocks, destroyed over 2,000 
buildings, left about 10,000 homeless and killed 7 residents. The Confederate 
Monument in Hemming Park was one of the only landmarks to survive the fire. 
Governor Jennings declare martial law and sent the state militia to maintain 
order. On May 17 municipal authority resumed in Jacksonville.[30] It is 
said the glow from the flames could be seen in Savannah, Georgia, and the 
smoke plumes seen in Raleigh, North Carolina. Known as the "Great Fire 
of 1901", it was one of the worst disasters in Florida history and the 
largest urban fire in the southeastern United States. Architect Henry John 
Klutho was a primary figure in the reconstruction of the city. The first 
multi-story structure built by Klutho was the Dyal-Upchurch Building in 
1902.[31][32] The St. James Building, built on the previous site of the 
St. James Hotel that burned down, was built in 1912 as Klutho's crowning 
achievement.[33] In the 1910s, New York–based filmmakers were attracted 
to Jacksonville's warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, 
and cheap labor. Over the course of the decade, more than 30 silent film 
studios were established, earning Jacksonville the title of "Winter Film 
Capital of the World". However, the emergence of Hollywood as a major film 
production center ended the city's film industry. One converted movie studio 
site, Norman Studios, remains in Arlington; It has been converted to the 
Jacksonville Silent Film Museum at Norman Studios.[34] During this time, 
Jacksonville also became a banking and insurance center, with companies 
such as Barnett Bank, Atlantic National Bank, Florida National Bank, Prudential, 
Gulf Life, Afro-American Insurance, Independent Life and American Heritage 
Life thriving in the business district. The U.S. Navy also became a major 
employer and economic force during the 1940s, with the construction of 
three naval bases in the city. Jacksonville, like most large cities in 
the United States, suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl 
after World War II. The construction of highways led residents to move 
to newer housing in the suburbs. After World War II, the government of 
the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public 
building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon 
Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, 
civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic 
sense of civic pride. However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent 
wave of middle class "white flight" left Jacksonville with a much poorer 
population than before. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic 
white,[35] declined from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.[36] Much of the 
city's tax base dissipated, leading to problems with funding education, 
sanitation, and traffic control within the city limits. In addition, residents 
in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services, 
such as sewage and building code enforcement. In 1958, a study recommended 
that the city of Jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities in order 
to create the needed tax base to improve services throughout the county. 
Voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums 
between 1960 and 1965. On December 29, 1963 the Hotel Roosevelt fire killed 
22 people making it the highest one-day death toll in Jacksonville.[37] 
One year later on September 10, 1964 Hurricane Dora made landfall near 
St. Augustine causing major damage to buildings in North Florida. Hurricane 
Dora was the first hurricane to make a direct hit to North Florida.[38] 
In the mid-1960s, corruption scandals began to arise among many of the 
city's officials, who were mainly elected through the traditional old boy 
network. After a grand jury was convened to investigate, 11 officials were 
indicted and more were forced to resign. Jacksonville Consolidation, led 
by J. J. Daniel and Claude Yates, began to win more support during this 
period, from both inner city blacks, who wanted more involvement in government, 
and whites in the suburbs, who wanted more services and more control over 
the central city. In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools 
lost their accreditation. This added momentum to proposals for government 
reform. Lower taxes, increased economic development, unification of the 
community, better public spending and effective administration by a more 
central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government. 
When a consolidation referendum was held in 1967, voters approved the plan. 
On October 1, 1968, the governments merged to create the Consolidated City 
of Jacksonville. Fire, police, health & welfare, recreation, public works, 
and housing & urban development were all combined under the new government. 
In honor of the occasion, then-Mayor Hans Tanzler posed with actress Lee 
Meredith behind a sign marking the new border of the "Bold New City of 
the South" at Florida 13 and Julington Creek.[39] The consolidation created 
a 900 square mile entity. The Better Jacksonville Plan, promoted as a blueprint 
for Jacksonville's future and approved by Jacksonville voters in 2000, 
authorized a half-penny sales tax. This would generate most of the revenue 
required for the $2.25 billion package of major projects that included 
road & infrastructure improvements, environmental preservation, targeted 
economic development and new or improved public facilities.[40] The NFL 
awarded Jacksonville an NFL franchise called the Jacksonville Jaguars on 
November 30, 1993.[41] In 2005, Jacksonville hosted Super Bowl XXXIX that 
was seen by an estimated 86 million viewers.[42] In October 2016, Hurricane 
Matthew caused major flooding and damage to Jacksonville, Jacksonville 
Beach, Atlantic Beach and Neptune Beach, the first such damage in the area 
since 2004.[43] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city 
has a total area of 874.3 square miles (2,264 km2), making Jacksonville 
the largest city in land area in the contiguous United States; of this, 
86.66% (757.7 sq mi or 1,962 km2) is land and ; 13.34% (116.7 sq mi or 
302 km2) is water. Jacksonville surrounds the town of Baldwin. Nassau County 
lies to the north, Baker County lies to the west, and Clay and St. Johns 
County lie to the south; the Atlantic Ocean lies to the east, along with 
the Jacksonville Beaches. The St. Johns River divides the city. The Trout 
River, a major tributary of the St. Johns River, is located entirely within 
Jacksonville. The state of Florida, including Jacksonville, is a huge flat 
plateau with a high water table, and surface lakes are very shallow.[44] 
The United States Geological Survey states that the highest point in Jacksonville 
is only 40 feet (12.2 meters) above sea level, making the area susceptible 
to flooding and storm surge.[45] Soil composition is primarily sand and 
clay rather than limestone, so very few sinkholes develop; however deep, 
large diameter sinkholes do occur.[46] There are more than 500 neighborhoods 
within Jacksonville's vast area.[47] These include Downtown Jacksonville 
and its surrounding neighborhoods, including LaVilla, Brooklyn, Riverside 
and Avondale, Springfield, Eastside, and San Marco.[48] Additionally, greater 
Jacksonville is traditionally divided into several amorphous areas, comprising 
large parts of Duval County. These are Northside, Westside, Southside, 
and Arlington, as well as the Jacksonville Beaches.[49] There are four 
municipalities that have retained their own governments since consolidation; 
these are Baldwin and the three Jacksonville Beaches towns of Atlantic 
Beach, Neptune Beach, and Jacksonville Beach.[50] Four of Jacksonville's 
neighborhoods, Avondale, Ortega, Springfield, and Riverside, have been 
identified as U.S. historic districts and are in the National Register 
of Historic Places.[51] LaVilla Brooklyn Southbank Springfield San Marco 
Ortega Avondale Riverside The tallest building in Downtown Jacksonville's 
skyline is the Bank of America Tower, constructed in 1990 as the Barnett 
Center. It has a height of 617 ft (188 m) and includes 42 floors.[52][53] 
Other notable structures include the 37-story Wells Fargo Center (with 
its distinctive flared base making it the defining building in the Jacksonville 
skyline),[54][55] originally built in 1972-74 by the Independent Life and 
Accident Insurance Company, and the 28 floor Riverplace Tower which, when 
completed in 1967, was the tallest precast, post-tensioned concrete structure 
in the world.[56][57] Laura Street Trio (1902-1912) The Carling (1925) 
11 East Forsyth (1926) Aetna Building (1955) Riverplace Tower (1967) Wells 
Fargo Center (1974) EverBank Center (1983) Bank of America (1990) Jacksonville 
is interesting from an architectural view with fourteen buildings on the 
document, "Florida Architecture: 100 places, 100 years", compiled by the 
Florida chapter of the American Institute of Architects.[58] Like much 
of the south Atlantic region of the United States, Jacksonville has a humid 
subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with mild weather during winters and 
hot and humid weather during summers. Seasonal rainfall is concentrated 
in the warmest months from May through September, while the driest months 
are from November through April. Rainfall averages around 52 inches (1,300 mm) 
a year.[59] Due to Jacksonville's low latitude and coastal location, the 
city sees very little cold weather, and winters are typically mild and 
sunny. Summer thunderstorms with torrential but brief downpours are common. 
Mean monthly temperatures range from around 53 °F (12 °C) in January to 
82 °F (28 °C) in July. High temperatures average 64 to 92 °F (18 to 33 °C) 
throughout the year.[60] High heat indices are common for the summer months 
in the area, with indices above 110 °F (43.3 °C) possible. The highest 
temperature recorded was 104 °F (40 °C) on July 11, 1879 and July 28, 1872.[61] 
It is common for thunderstorms to erupt during a typical summer afternoon. 
These are caused by the rapid heating of the land relative to the water, 
combined with extremely high humidity. During winter, there can be hard 
freezes during the night. Such cold weather is usually short lived, as 
the city averages only 10 to 15 nights at or below freezing and around 
5 days where the high does not rise above 50 °F (10 °C).[62] The coldest 
temperature recorded at Jacksonville International Airport was 7 °F (−14 °C) 
on January 21, 1985. Jacksonville has recorded three days with measurable 
snow since 1911, most recently a one-inch snowfall in December 1989[63] 
and flurries in December 2010.[64] Jacksonville has suffered less damage 
from hurricanes than most other east coast cities, although the threat 
does exist for a direct hit by a major hurricane. The city has only received 
one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871; however, Jacksonville has experienced 
hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms 
crossing the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing 
to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing past the area.[65] The 
strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only 
recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. 
The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished 
to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson 
Scale. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay 
which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness 
for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated 
by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of 
the area. These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. 
Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During 
Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and later demolished. 
The rebuilt pier was later damaged by Fay, but not destroyed. Tropical 
Storm Bonnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado 
in the process.[66] On May 28, 2012, Jacksonville was hit by Tropical Storm 
Beryl, packing winds up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) which made landfall 
near Jacksonville Beach. Jacksonville is the most populous city in Florida, 
and the twelfth most populous city in the United States. As of 2010[update], 
there were 821,784 people and 366,273 households in the city. Jacksonville 
has the country's tenth-largest Arab population, with a total population 
of 5,751 according to the 2000 United States Census.[74][75] Jacksonville 
has Florida's largest Filipino American community, with 25,033 in the metropolitan 
area as of the 2010 Census. Much of Jacksonville's Filipino community served 
in or has ties to the United States Navy.[76] As of 2010[update], those 
of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 7.7% of Jacksonville's population. 
Out of the 7.7%, 2.6% Puerto Rican, 1.7% Mexican, and 0.9% were Cuban.[77] 
As of 2010[update], those of African ancestry accounted for 30.7% of Jacksonville's 
population, which includes African Americans. Out of the 30.7%, 1.8% were 
Subsaharan African, 1.4% were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American (0.5% 
Haitian, 0.4% Jamaican, 0.1% Other or Unspecified West Indian, 0.1% Bahamian, 
0.1% Barbadian), and 0.6% were Black Hispanics.[77][78][79] As of 2010[update], 
those of (non-Hispanic white) European ancestry accounted for 55.1% of 
Jacksonville's population. Out of the 55.1%, 10.4% were German, 10.2% Irish, 
8.8% English, 3.9% Italian, 2.2% French, 2.0% Scottish, 2.0% Scotch-Irish, 
1.7% Polish, 1.1% Dutch, 0.6% Russian, 0.5% Norwegian, 0.5% Swedish, 0.5% 
Welsh, and 0.5% were French Canadian.[79] As of 2010[update], those of 
Asian ancestry accounted for 4.3% of Jacksonville's population. Out of 
the 4.3%, 1.8% Filipino, 0.9% were Indian, 0.6% Other Asian, 0.5% Vietnamese, 
0.3% Chinese, 0.2% Korean, and 0.1% were Japanese.[79] In 2010, 6.7% of 
the population considered themselves to be of only American ancestry (regardless 
of race or ethnicity.)[78][79] And 0.9% were of Arab ancestry, as of 2010[update].[79] 
As of 2010[update], there were 366,273 households out of which 11.8% were 
vacant. 23.9% of households had children under the age of 18 living with 
them, 43.8% were married couples, 15.2% had a female householder with no 
husband present, and 36.4% were non-families. 29.7% of all households were 
made up of individuals and 7.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size was 2.55 and the average family 
size was 3.21. In the city, the population was spread out with 23.9% under 
the age of 18, 10.5% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 26.2% from 45 
to 64, and 10.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
35.5 years. For every 100 females there were 94.1 males. For every 100 
females age 18 and over, there were 91.3 males.[79][80] In 2010, the median 
income for a household in the county was $48,829, and the median income 
for a family was $59,272. Males had a median income of $42,485 versus $34,209 
for females. The per capita income for the county was $25,227. About 10.5% 
of families and 14.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
20.4% of those under age 18 and 9.9% of those aged 65 or over.[81] In 2010, 
9.2% of the county's population was foreign born, with 49.6% being naturalized 
American citizens. Of foreign born residents, 38.0% were born in Latin 
America, 35.7% born in Asia, 17.9% were born in Europe, 5.9% born in Africa, 
1.9% in North America, and 0.5% were born in Oceania.[79] As of 2010[update], 
87.1% of Jacksonville's population age five and over spoke only English 
at home while 5.8% of the population spoke Spanish at home. About 3.3% 
spoke other Indo-European languages at home. About 2.9% spoke Asian languages 
or Pacific Islander languages/Oceanic languages at home. The remaining 
0.9% of the population spoke other languages at home. In total, 12.9% spoke 
another language other than English.[79] As of 2000, speakers of English 
as a first language accounted for 90.60% of all residents, while those 
who spoke Spanish made up 4.13%, Tagalog 1.00%, French 0.47%, Arabic 0.44%, 
German 0.43%, Vietnamese at 0.31%, Russian was 0.21% and Italian made up 
0.17% of the population.[82] Jacksonville has a diverse religious population. 
The largest religious group is Protestant. According to the Association 
of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), in 2010 the Jacksonville metropolitan 
area had an estimated 365,267 Evangelical Protestants, 76,100 Mainline 
Protestants, and 56,769 Black Protestants, though figures for the latter 
were incomplete. There were around 1200 Protestant congregations in various 
denominations.[83] Notable Protestant churches include Bethel Baptist Institutional 
Church and First Baptist Church, the city's oldest Baptist churches. The 
Episcopal Diocese of Florida has its see at St. John's Cathedral, the current 
building dating to 1906. Jacksonville is part of the Catholic Diocese of 
St. Augustine, which covers seventeen counties in North Florida.[84] ARDA 
estimated 133,155 Catholics attending 25 parishes in the Jacksonville metropolitan 
area in 2010.[83] One notable Catholic church in Jacksonville is the Basilica 
of the Immaculate Conception, a minor basilica added to the National Register 
of Historic Places in 1992.[85][86] There are also two Eastern Catholic 
parishes, one of the Syriac Catholic Church and one of the Maronite Church.[87] 
According to ARDA, in 2010 there were 2520 Eastern Orthodox Christians 
representing four churches in the Eastern Orthodox communion, as well as 
congregations of Syriac Orthodox, Armenian Apostolic, Ethiopian Orthodox, 
and Coptic Orthodox Christians.[83] ARDA also estimated 14,886 members 
of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and 511 
Unitarian Universalists in 2010.[83] There were an estimated 8,581 Muslims 
attending seven mosques, the largest being the Islamic Center of Northeast 
Florida.[83][88] The Jewish community, which numbered 6,028 in 2010,[83] 
is largely centered in the neighborhood of Mandarin.[89] There are five 
Orthodox, two Reform, two Conservative, and one Reconstructionist synagogues. 
The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute teaches courses for the community.[83][90] 
ARDA also estimated 4,595 Hindus, 3,530 Buddhists and 650 Bahá'ís in the 
Jacksonville area in 2010.[83] First Baptist Church of Jacksonville Basilica

Episcopal Church Jacksonville's location on the St. Johns River and the 
Atlantic Ocean proved providential in the growth of the city and its industry. 
Jacksonville has the largest deepwater port in the South (as well as the 
second-largest port on the U.S. East coast) and a leading port in the U.S. 
for automobile imports, as well as the leading transportation and distribution 
hub in the state. However, the strength of the city's economy lies in its 
broad diversification. While the area once had many thriving dairies such 
as Gustafson's Farm and Skinner Dairy, this aspect of the economy has declined 
over time. The area's economy is balanced among distribution, financial 
services, biomedical technology, consumer goods, information services, 
manufacturing, insurance and other industries. Jacksonville is a rail, 
air, and highway focal point and a busy port of entry, with Jacksonville 
International Airport, ship repair yards and extensive freight-handling 
facilities. Lumber, phosphate, paper, cigars and wood pulp are the principal 
exports; automobiles and coffee are among imports. The city's manufacturing 
base provides just 4.5% of local jobs, versus 8.5% nationally.[91] According 
to Forbes in 2007, Jacksonville, Florida ranked 3rd in the top ten U.S. 
cities to relocate to find a job.[92] Jacksonville was also the 10th fastest 
growing city in the U.S.[93] Jacksonville is home to many prominent corporations 
and organizations, including the headquarters of four Fortune 500 companies: 
CSX Corporation, Fidelity National Financial, Fidelity National Information 
Services and Southeastern Grocers.[94] Interline Brands is based in Jacksonville 
and is currently owned by The Home Depot.[95] The Florida East Coast Railway, 
Swisher International, Inc., and the large short line railroad holding 
company RailAmerica are also based in Jacksonville. In 2008, Jacksonville 
had approximately 2.8 million visitors who stayed overnight, spending nearly 
$1 billion. Research Data Services of Tampa was commissioned to undertake 
the study, which quantified the importance of tourism. The total economic 
impact was $1.6 billion and supported nearly 43,000 jobs, 10% of the local 
workforce.[96] Cecil Commerce Center is located on the site of the former 
Naval Air Station Cecil Field which closed in 1999 following the 1993 Base 
Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision. Covering a total area of 22,939 
acres (92.83 km2), it was the largest military base in the Jacksonville 
area. The parcel contains more than 3% of the total land area in Duval

markers on Interstate 95.[98] The Port of Jacksonville, a seaport on the 
St. Johns River, is a large component of the local economy. Approximately 
50,000 jobs in Northeast Florida are related to port activity and the port 
has an economic impact of $2.7 billion in Northeast Florida:[99] Jacksonville 
is home to multiple military facilities, and with Naval Submarine Base 
Kings Bay nearby gives Jacksonville the third largest naval presence in 
the country.[13] Only Norfolk, Virginia and San Diego, California are bigger.

airport located 4 miles (6.4 km) south of the central business district. 
Approximately 23,000 civilian and active-duty personnel are employed on 
the base. There are 35 operational units/squadrons assigned there and support 
facilities include an airfield for pilot training, a maintenance depot 
capable of virtually any task, from changing a tire to intricate micro-electronics 
or total engine disassembly. Also on-site is a Naval Hospital, a Fleet 
Industrial Supply Center, a Navy Family Service Center, and recreational

operational composition is unique, with a busy harbor capable of accommodating 
34 ships and an 8,000-foot (2,400 m) runway capable of handling any aircraft 
used by the Department of Defense. Until 2007, it was home to the aircraft 
carrier USS John F. Kennedy, which locals called "Big John". In January 
2009, the Navy committed to stationing a nuclear-powered carrier at Mayport 
when the official Record of Decision was signed. The port will require 
approximately $500 million in facility enhancements to support the larger 
vessel, which will take several years to complete.[102] The carrier is 
projected to arrive in 2019, however an amphibious group is coming sooner.[103]

Boats, and 47-foot (14 m) Motor Life Boats. The Florida Theatre, opened 
in 1927, is located in downtown Jacksonville and is one of only four remaining 
high-style movie palaces built in Florida during the Mediterranean Revival 
architectural boom of the 1920s. Amity Turkish Cultural Center was established 
in 2006 as one of the major Dialogue and Cultural organizations in Jacksonville. 
Theatre Jacksonville was organized in 1919 as the Little Theatre and is 
one of the oldest continually producing community theatres in the United 
States. Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly the 5 Points Theatre and Riverside Theatre,

gardens begun by Ninah Cummer.[115] The Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville 
(MOCA Jacksonville) is a contemporary art museum funded and operated as 
a "cultural resource" of the University of North Florida. Tracing its roots 
back to the formation of Jacksonville's Fine Arts Society in 1924, it opened 
its current 60,000-square-foot (6,000 m2) facility next to the Main Library 
downtown in 2003. The museum features eclectic permanent and traveling 
exhibitions and a collection of over 700 works.[115] Alexander Brest, founder 
of Duval Engineering and Contracting Co., was also the benefactor for the 
Alexander Brest Museum and Gallery on the campus of Jacksonville University. 
The exhibits are a diverse collection of carved ivory, Pre-Columbian artifacts, 
Steuben glass, Chinese porcelain and Cloisonné, Tiffany glass, Boehm porcelain

The end of the indoor shopping mall may be indicated by the opening of 
The St. Johns Town Center in 2005 and the River City Marketplace, on the 
Northside in 2006. Both of these are "open air" malls, with a similar mix 
of stores, but without being contained under a single, enclosed roof. According 
to the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC), only one enclosed 
mall has been built in the United States since 2006.[123] The Avenues, 
Orange Park Mall, and St. Johns Town Center are all owned by Simon Property 
Group; Regency is owned by General Growth Properties; River City Marketplace

is also home to several minor league-level teams. The Jacksonville Jumbo 
Shrimp, a class Double-A baseball team, have played in Jacksonville continuously 
since 1970, longer than any other Double-A team has been in its city, and 
are the top-selling franchise in the Southern League.[126][127] The Jacksonville

The Jacksonville Armada FC is a soccer team that began play in the North 
American Soccer League (NASL) in 2015.[134] College sports, especially 
college football, are popular in Jacksonville. The city hosts the Florida–Georgia 
game, an annual college football game between the University of Florida 
and the University of Georgia, and the Gator Bowl, a post-season college 
bowl game. Jacksonville's two universities compete in NCAA Division I: 
the University of North Florida Ospreys and the Jacksonville University 
Dolphins, both in the Atlantic Sun Conference.[135][136] Jacksonville operates 
the largest urban park system in the United States, providing facilities 
and services at more than 337 locations on more than 80,000 acres (320 km2) 
located throughout the city.[137] Jacksonville enjoys natural beauty from 
the St. Johns River and Atlantic Ocean. Many parks provide access for people 
to boat, swim, fish, sail, jetski, surf and waterski. Several parks around 
the city have received international recognition. Hemming Plaza is Jacksonville's 
first and oldest park. It is downtown and surrounded by government buildings. 
Riverside Park and Memorial Park are the city's second and third oldest 
parks (respectively), and located in the historic Riverside area. Tree 
Hill Nature Center is a nature preserve and environmental education center 
located five minutes from Downtown Jacksonville. The Jacksonville Arboretum 
& Gardens broke ground on a new center in April 2007 and held their grand 
opening on November 15, 2008. The Veterans Memorial Wall is a tribute to 
local servicemen and women killed while serving in US armed forces. A ceremony 
is held each Memorial Day recognizing any service woman or man from Jacksonville 
who died in the previous year. The Treaty Oak is a massive, 250-year-old 
tree at Jessie Ball DuPont Park in downtown. Office workers from nearby 
buildings sit on benches to eat lunch or read a book in the shade of its 
canopy. The Friendship Fountain has been one of Jacksonville's most recognizable

Park Friendship Fountain Statue in Memorial Park Treaty Oak Jacksonville-Baldwin 
Rail Trail Confederate Park Hanna Park Jacksonville Riverwalk The most 
noteworthy feature of Jacksonville government is its consolidated nature. 
The Duval County-Jacksonville consolidation eliminated any type of separate 
county executive or legislature, and supplanted these positions with the 
Mayor of Jacksonville and the City Council of the City of Jacksonville, 
respectively. Because of this, voters who live outside of the city limits 
of Jacksonville but inside Duval County are allowed to vote in elections 
for these positions and to run for them. In fact, in 1995, John Delaney, 
a resident of Neptune Beach, was elected mayor of the city of Jacksonville. 
Jacksonville uses the Mayor-Council form of city government, also called 
the Strong-Mayor form, in which a mayor serves as the city's Chief Executive 
and Administrative officer. The mayor holds veto power over all resolutions 
and ordinances made by the city council and also has the power to hire 
and fire the head of various city departments. The current mayor is Lenny 
Curry, who assumed office on July 1, 2015.[138] The past mayor was Alvin 
Brown.[139] Jacksonville and Duval County historically maintained separate 
police agencies: the Jacksonville Police Department and Duval County Sheriff's 
Office. As part of consolidation in 1968, the two merged, creating the 
Jacksonville Sheriff's Office (JSO). The JSO is headed by the elected Sheriff 
of Jacksonville, currently Mike Williams, and is responsible for law enforcement 
and corrections in the county. In 2010, Duval County's crime rate was 5,106 
per 100,000 people, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. 
The county's murder rate had been the highest among Florida's counties 
with a population of 500,000 or more for eleven years in 2009, leading 
to widespread discussion in the community about how to deal with the problem. 
In 2010 Duval County's violent crime rate decreased by 9.3% from the previous 
year, with total crime decreasing 7.3%, putting the murder rate behind 
that of Miami-Dade County.[140] Some government services remained—as they 
had been before consolidation—independent of both city and county authority. 
In accordance with Florida law, the school board continues to exist with 
nearly complete autonomy. Jacksonville also has several quasi-independent 
government agencies which only nominally answer to the consolidated authority, 
including electric authority, port authority, transportation authority, 
housing authority and airport authority. The main environmental and agricultural 
body is the Duval County Soil and Water Conservation District, which works 
closely with other area and state agencies. Federally, most of the city 
is in the 4th district, represented by Republican Ander Crenshaw. Most 
of central Jacksonville is in the 5th district, represented by Democrat 
Corinne Brown. The 4th and 5th districts are some of the most gerrymandered 
districts in the country.[141] Jacksonville is home to a number of institutions 
of higher education. The University of North Florida (UNF), opened in 1972, 
is a public institution and a member of the State University System of 
Florida. Former mayor John Delaney has been president of UNF since 2003. 
Jacksonville University (JU) is a private institution founded in 1934. 
Edward Waters College, established in 1866, is the oldest college in Jacksonville 
and the state's oldest historically black college. Florida State College 
at Jacksonville is a state college and a member of the Florida College 
System, offering two-year associate's degrees as well as some four-year 
bachelor's degrees. The University of Florida has its second campus of 
the J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center in Jacksonville.[15][142] Other 
colleges and universities in Jacksonville include Florida Coastal School 
of Law and Jones College.[143] Also in the area are St. Johns River State 
College, a state college with campuses in Clay, St. Johns, and Putnam Counties, 
and Flagler College in St. Augustine.[144] University of North Florida 
Jacksonville University Florida State College at Jacksonville Florida Coastal 
School of Law Edward Waters College Jones College Public primary and secondary 
schools in Jacksonville and Duval County are administered by Duval County 
Public Schools, which is governed by an elected, seven-member Duval County 
School Board. In the 2009–2010 school year the district enrolled 123,000 
students. It administers 172 total schools, including 103 elementary schools, 
25 middle schools, 19 high schools, 3 K–8 schools, and 1 6–12 school, as 
well as 13 charter schools and a juvenile justice school program.[145] 
Of these, 62 are designated magnet schools.[145] Three of Jacksonville's 
high schools, Stanton College Preparatory School, Darnell-Cookman School 
of the Medical Arts and Paxon School for Advanced Studies regularly appear 
at the top of Newsweek magazine's annual list of the country's top public 
high schools, coming in respectively at #3 #7, and #8 in the 2010 edition.[146] 
Five other schools, Douglas Anderson School of the Arts (#33), Mandarin 
High School (#97), Duncan U. Fletcher High School (#205) Sandalwood High 
School (#210), and Englewood High School (#1146) were also included in 
the list.[146] The Roman Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine operates a number 
of Catholic schools in Jacksonville, including two high schools, Bishop 
Kenny High School and Bishop John J. Snyder High School.[147] Other private 
schools in Jacksonville include Arlington Country Day School, the Bolles 
School, Trinity Christian Academy, and the Episcopal School of Jacksonville.[148] 
The Jacksonville Public Library had its beginnings when May Moore and Florence 
Murphy started the "Jacksonville Library and Literary Association" in 1878. 
The Association was populated by various prominent Jacksonville residents 
and sought to create a free public library and reading room for the city.[149] 
Over the course of 127 years, the system has grown from that one room library 
to become one of the largest in the state. The Jacksonville library system 
has twenty branches, ranging in size from the 54,000 sq ft (5,000 m2) West 
Regional Library to smaller neighborhood libraries like Westbrook and Eastside. 
The Library annually receives nearly 4 million visitors and circulates 
over 6 million items. Nearly 500,000 library cards are held by area residents.[150] 
On November 12, 2005, the new 300,000 sq ft (30,000 m2) Main Library opened 
to the public, replacing the 40-year-old Haydon Burns Library. The largest 
public library in the state, the opening of the new main library marked 
the completion of an unprecedented period of growth for the system under 
the Better Jacksonville Plan.[151] The new Main Library offers specialized 
reading rooms, public access to hundreds of computers and public displays 
of art, an extensive collection of books, and special collections ranging 
from the African-American Collection to the recently opened Holocaust Collection.[149]

moviemakers were attracted to Jacksonville's warm climate, exotic locations, 
excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of 
"The Winter Film Capital of the World". Over 30 movie studios were opened 
and thousands of silent films produced between 1908 and the 1920s, when 
most studios relocated to Hollywood, California. Since that time, Jacksonville 
has been chosen by a number of film and television studios for on-location 
shooting. Notable motion pictures that have been partially or completely

its large population, Jacksonville has always been a medium-sized market 
because the surrounding suburbs and rural areas are not much larger than 
the city itself. It is served by television stations affiliated with major 
American networks including WTLV (NBC/Justice Network), WJXX (ABC/NBC Weather 
Plus), WJAX-TV (CBS/GetTV), WFOX-TV (Fox/MyNetworkTV/Me-TV), WJCT (PBS),

radio market in the United States,[155] and is dominated by the same two 
large ownership groups that dominate the radio industry across the United 
States: Cox Radio[156] and iHeartMedia.[157] The dominant AM radio station 
in terms of ratings is WOKV 690AM, which is also the flagship station for

The Jacksonville Housing Authority (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency 
responsible for public housing and subsidized housing in Jacksonville. 
The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 
to create an effective, community service oriented, public housing agency 
with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to 
provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income 
families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal 
was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve 
their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help 
residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with HabiJax 
to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle 
and become successful, productive, homeowners and taxpayers. The TaxExemptWorld.com 
website, which compiles Internal Revenue Service data, reported that in 
2007, there are 2,910 distinct, active, tax exempt/non-profit organizations 
in Jacksonville which, excluding Credit Unions, had a total income of $7.08 
billion and assets of $9.54 billion.[159] There are 333 charitable organizations 
with assets of over $1 million. The largest share of assets was tied to 
Medical facilities, $4.5 billion. The problems of the homeless are addressed 
by several non-profits, most notably the Sulzbacher Center and the Clara 
White Mission. Basic utilities in Jacksonville (water, sewer, electric) 
are provided by JEA (formerly the Jacksonville Electric Authority). According 
to Article 21 of the Jacksonville City Charter, JEA is authorized to own, 
manage and operate a utilities system within and outside the City of Jacksonville. 
JEA is created for the express purpose of acquiring, constructing, operating, 
financing and otherwise have plenary authority with respect to electric, 
water, sewer, natural gas and such other utility systems as may be under 
its control now or in the future.[160] People's Gas is Jacksonville's natural 
gas provider. Comcast is Jacksonville's local cable provider. AT&T (formerly 
BellSouth) is Jacksonville's local phone provider, and their U-Verse service 
offers TV, internet, and VoIP phone service to customers served by fiber-to-the-premises 
or fiber-to-the-node using a VRAD. The city has a successful recycling 
program with separate pickups for garbage, yard waste and recycling. Collection 
is provided by several private companies under contract to the City of 
Jacksonville. The Jacksonville Skyway is an automated people mover connecting 
Florida State College at Jacksonville downtown campus, the Northbank central 
business district, Convention Center, and Southbank locations. The system 
includes 8 stops connected by two lines. The existing train is a UMIII 
monorail built by Bombardier. The guideway consists of concrete beams which 
rest atop an unusually large support structure not used in most monorail 
systems. Maximum speed for the train is 48 km/h (30 mph).[161] A monorail 
was first proposed in the 1970s as part of a mobility plan hoping to attract 
interest from the Urban Mass Transit Administration's Downtown Peoplemover 
Program. The initial study was undertaken by the Florida Department of 
Transportation and Jacksonville's planning department, who took the Skyway 
project to the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA) in 1977. Following 
further development and a final 18-month feasibility study, the UMTA selected 
Jacksonville as one of seven cities to receive federal funding for an automated 
people mover. Two other related projects are Miami's Metromover and Detroit's 
People Mover. UMTA's approved plan called for the construction of a 2.5-mile 
(4.0 km) Phase I system to be built in three segments. Amtrak, the national 
passenger rail system, provides daily service from the Jacksonville Amtrak 
Station on Clifford Lane in the northwest section of the city. Two trains 
presently stop there, the Silver Meteor and Silver Star. Jacksonville was 
also served by the thrice-weekly Sunset Limited and the daily Silver Palm. 
Service on the Silver Palm was cut back to Savannah, Georgia in 2002. The 
Sunset Limited route was truncated at San Antonio, Texas as a result of 
the track damage in the Gulf Coast area caused by Hurricane Katrina on 
August 28, 2005. Service was restored as far east as New Orleans by late 
October 2005, but Amtrak has opted not to fully restore service into Florida. 
Jacksonville is the headquarters of two significant freight railroads. 
CSX Transportation, owns a large building on the downtown riverbank that 
is a significant part of the skyline. Florida East Coast Railway also calls 
Jacksonville home. Jacksonville is served by Jacksonville International 
Airport (IATA: JAX, ICAO: KJAX, FAA LID: JAX), 13 miles north of downtown, 
with 82 departures a day to 27 nonstop destination cities. Airports in 
Jacksonville are managed by the Jacksonville Aviation Authority (JAA). 
Smaller aircraft use Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport (IATA: CRG, ICAO: 
KCRG, FAA LID: CRG) in Arlington, Herlong Recreational Airport (ICAO: KHEG, FAA 
LID: HEG) on the Westside, and Cecil Airport (IATA: VQQ, ICAO: KVQQ, FAA 
LID: VQQ), at Cecil Commerce Center. The state of Florida has designated 
Cecil Airport a space port, allowing horizontal lift spacecraft to use 
the facility. Public seaports in Jacksonville are managed by the Jacksonville 
Port Authority, known as JAXPORT. Four modern deepwater (38 ft) seaport 
facilities, including America's newest cruise port, make Jacksonville a 
full-service international seaport. In FY2006, JAXPORT handled 8.7 million 
tons of cargo, including nearly 610,000 vehicles, which ranks Jacksonville 
2nd in the nation in automobile handling, behind only the Port Authority 
of New York and New Jersey.[162] The 20 other maritime facilities not managed 
by the Port Authority move about 10 million tons of additional cargo in 
and out of the St. Johns River. In terms of total tonnage, the Port of 
Jacksonville ranks 40th nationally; within Florida, it is 3rd behind Tampa 
and Port Everglades. In 2003, the JAXPORT Cruise Terminal opened, providing 
cruise service for 1,500 passengers to Key West, Florida, the Bahamas, 
and Mexico via Carnival Cruise Lines ship, Celebration, which was retired 
in April 2008. For almost five months, no cruises originated from Jacksonville 
until September 20, 2008, when the cruise ship Fascination departed with 
2,079 passengers.[163] In Fiscal year 2006, there were 78 cruise ship sailings 
with 128,745 passengers.[164] A JaxPort spokesperson said in 2008 that 
they expect 170,000 passengers to sail each year.[165] Jacksonville Fire 
and Rescue operates a fleet of three fireboats.[166] Its vessels are called 
on to fight approximately 75 fires per year.[167] Several regional transportation 
projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on 
Jacksonville freeways. A $152 million project to create a high-speed interchange 
at the intersection of Interstates 10 and 95 began in February 2005, after 
the conclusion of Super Bowl XXXIX. Construction was expected to take nearly 
six years with multiple lane flyovers and the requirement that the interchange 
remain open throughout the project. The previous configuration utilized 
single lane, low speed, curved ramps which created backups during rush 
hours and contributed to accidents.[168] Also, construction of 9B, future 
Interstate 795 (Florida), is currently underway (July 2013). Interstate 10 
(I-10) and I-95 intersect in Jacksonville, forming the busiest intersection 
in the region with 200,000 vehicles each day.[169] I-10 ends at this intersection 
(the other end being in Santa Monica, California). Additionally, State 
Road 202 (SR 202, J. Turner Butler Boulevard) connects Jacksonville to 
the beaches. I-95 has a bypass route, I-295, which encircles the downtown 
area. The major interchange at I-295 and SR 202 was finally completed on 
December 24, 2008. SR 9B is under construction and will connect I-295's 
southeast corner to the Bayard Area.[170] SR 9B will be called I-795 when 
it is completed. U.S. Highway 1 (US 1) and US 17 travel through the city 
from the south to the north, and US 23 enters the city running concurrently 
with US 1. In downtown, US 23 splits from US 1 and quickly runs to its 
southern terminus. The eastern terminus of US 90 is in nearby Jacksonville 
Beach near the Atlantic Ocean. US 23's other end is in Mackinaw City, Michigan. 
There are seven bridges over the St. Johns River at Jacksonville. They 
include (starting from furthest downstream) the Napoleon Bonaparte Broward 
Bridge (Dames Point) (which carries Interstate 295 Eastern Beltway traffic), 
the John E. Mathews Bridge, the Isaiah D. Hart Bridge, the John T. Alsop 
Jr. Bridge (Main Street), the St. Elmo W. Acosta Bridge, the Fuller Warren 
Bridge (which carries I-95 traffic) and the Henry Holland Buckman Bridge 
(which carries I-295 North/South traffic). Also, next to the Acosta Bridge 
is a large jackknife railroad bridge built in the 1920s by Henry flagler's 
FEC railroad. Beginning in 1953, tolls were charged on the Hart, Mathews, 
Fuller Warren and the Main Street bridges to pay for bridge construction, 
renovations and many other highway projects. As Jacksonville grew, toll 
plazas created bottlenecks and caused delays and accidents during rush 
hours. In 1988, Jacksonville voters chose to eliminate toll collection 
and replace the revenue with a ½ cent local sales tax increase. In 1989, 
the toll booths were removed. The Mayport Ferry connects the north and 
south ends of State Road A1A between Mayport and Fort George Island, and 
is the last active ferry in Florida. The state of Florida transferred responsibility 
for ferry operations to JAXPORT on October 1, 2007. A 1992 map of downtown
