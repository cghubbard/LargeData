As player As manager Kenton Lloyd "Kent" Boyer (May 20, 1931 – September 
7, 1982) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) third baseman, coach 
and manager who played on the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, Chicago 
White Sox, and Los Angeles Dodgers for 15 seasons, 1955 through 1969. He 
was inducted into the Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2014.[1] Boyer was an All-Star 
for seven seasons (11 All-Star Game selections)[a], a National League (NL) 
Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a Gold Glove winner five seasons. He was 
named the NL MVP in 1964 after batting .295 with 185 hits and leading the 
NL with 119 runs batted in, and leading the Cardinals to the World Series 
title. He hit over .300 for five seasons and hit over 20 home runs for 
eight seasons. He became the 2nd third baseman to hit 250 career home runs, 
retiring with the third highest slugging average by a third baseman (.462); 
he was the 3rd third baseman after Pie Traynor and Eddie Mathews to drive 
in 90 runs eight-times, and remains the only Cardinal since 1900 to hit 
for the cycle twice. When Boyer hit 255 home runs, he was 2nd to Stan Musial 
(475) with Cardinal career home runs; he held the team record for a right-handed 
hitter from 1962 until Albert Pujols passed him in 2007. Boyer also led 
the NL in double plays five-times and in fielding average once, and retired 
among the all-time leaders in games (6th, 1,785), assists (6th, 3,652) 
and double plays (3rd, 355) at third base. In 2014, Boyer appeared for 
the second time on the Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[2] 
for possible National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration. None of the 
ten candidates on the ballot were elected for the 2015 induction. The Committee 
meets every three years to consider retired players who played from 1947 
to 1972. Born in Liberty, Missouri, Boyer grew up in Alba, Missouri as 
the fifth of 14 children, and third oldest son, of marble cutter Chester 
Vern Boyer (1903–81[3]) and his wife, the former Mabel Agnes Means (1907–71[4]), 
including sons Cloyd (born 1927), Wayne (born 1929), Ken, Lynn (born c. 
1935), Clete (1937–2007), Ronnie (born 1944) and Lenny (1946–2013[5]) and 
daughters Juanita Woodmansee, Leila, Dolores Webb, Pansy Schell, Shirley 
Lockhart, Bobbi McNary and Marcy Layton. He attended Alba High School. 
All seven boys played professional baseball, with two of his brothers also 
reaching the major leagues: older brother Cloyd was a pitcher for the Cardinals 
in the early 1950s, and younger brother Clete became a third baseman for 
the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. After signing with the Cardinals 
in 1949, Boyer was initially assigned to the Rochester Red Wings, where 
his brother Cloyd was his teammate, but Ken appeared in no games before 
the organization opened a roster spot for him at a lower level, where the 
Cardinals initially tried him as a pitcher.[6] With the Lebanon Chix of 
the North Atlantic League in 1949, he posted a record of 5 wins against 
1 loss with a 3.42 earned run average (ERA) in 12 games, batting .455; 
the following year, with the Hamilton Cardinals of the PONY (Pennsylvania 
– Ontario – New York) League, he posted a record of 6–8 with a 4.39 ERA 
in 21 games while hitting .342. After seeing him hit so well, the Cardinals 
shifted him to third base, and he batted .306 for the Omaha Cardinals of 
the Western League in 1951. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1951 to 
1953, he batted .319 with 21 home runs and 116 runs batted in (RBI) for 
the champion Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League in 1954. He joined the 
Cardinals after they traded Ray Jablonski following the 1954 season. Boyer 
made his major league debut with the Cardinals on April 12, 1955 in a 14–4 
road loss to the Chicago Cubs, hitting a two-run homer in the eighth inning 
off Paul Minner as his first hit, and batted .264 with 62 RBI his rookie 
season. In 1956, he received his first of seven NL All-Star selections 
and started at third base (first of five starts at third base) batting 
cleanup for the National League All-Star team; he finished the season with 
a .306 batting average, 26 home runs and 98 RBI, and led NL third basemen 
in assists (309) and double plays (37). He was shifted to center field 
in 1957 to allow rookie Eddie Kasko to break in at third, and led all NL 
outfielders in fielding percentage, but returned to third base in 1958, 
winning the first of four consecutive Gold Gloves and again collecting 
90 RBI while batting .307 and scoring 100 runs for the first time. That 
year he also became the Cardinals' regular cleanup hitter, a role he would 
hold regularly for the remainder of his time with the club. His 41 double 
plays in 1958 equalled the second-highest total in NL history to that point, 
and fell just two short of Hank Thompson's 1950 league mark; he also led 
the league in putouts (156). He became the Cardinal team captain in 1959, 
and compiled a 29-game hitting streak from August 10 to September 12 of 
that year, during which he batted .350 with eight home runs and 23 RBI;[7] 
it was the longest hitting streak in the major leagues since Musial's 30-game 
run in 1950. Boyer finished 10th in the MVP voting that season after batting 
.309 with 28 home runs and 94 RBI, and began a run of six consecutive All-Star 
selections, starting the second of the two 1959 games; he again led the 
NL with 32 double plays. In 1960–61 Boyer led the Cardinals in batting 
average (.304 and .329), home runs (32 and 24), runs (95 and 109), RBI 
(97 and 95) and total bases (310 and 314), and finished 6th and 7th in 
the MVP voting. He led the league with 37 double plays in 1960, and with 
346 assists in 1961. He was also named the NL's Player of the Month for 
September 1960 after batting .385. He hit for the cycle, with an additional 
single, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 14, 1961 against 
the Cubs, becoming the first player in history to complete the cycle with 
a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th inning for a 6–5 victory; 
his RBI double in the 9th inning had tied the game. In that game he also 
joined Musial as the only Cardinals to hit two walk-off home runs in a 
season in two different years; Boyer also had two walk-off homers in 1958 
(May 31 and June 11; he was the fourth Cardinal to hit two extra-inning 
walk-off homers in a season, with both leading off the bottom of the 12th 
inning) and a previous one in 1961 on August 8.[8] On September 19, 1962, 
Boyer broke Rogers Hornsby's team record for home runs by a right-handed 
hitter with his 194th career round-tripper, a 2-run shot off Billy O'Dell 
in the first inning of a 7–4 loss to the San Francisco Giants. He finished 
the season with 98 RBI, equaling his career best to that point, and started 
both All-Star games, also leading the league in double plays for the last 
time with 34. On June 7, 1963, Boyer became the second Cardinal to hit 
200 career homers, connecting off Al Jackson in the 4th inning of a 3–2 
road loss to the New York Mets. He was again named to the NL All-Star starting 
lineup, increased his RBI season total to 111 that year, and won his fifth 
Gold Glove award. Boyer had his best season in 1964, keeping the Cardinals 
alive for much of the season as he batted .350 in May and .342 in July, 
and starting for the NL in his last All-Star appearance. On June 16, he 
became the 19th player in major league history to hit for the cycle twice, 
and the seventh to hit for a natural cycle, in a 7–1 road victory against 
the Houston Colt .45s. Boyer's productivity early in the season kept the 
team in contention, although they were still only 54–51 and tied for fifth 
place on August 4; they fell 11 games out of first place by August 23, 
but mounted one of the great comebacks in history, overtaking the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the final weeks to win the NL pennant by a single game; Boyer 
batted .400 in five September games against the Phillies. He enjoyed his 
career highlight against the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series, 
hitting a grand slam in Game 4 off pitcher Al Downing to give the Cardinals 
a 4–3 victory; the home run came after Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson 
misplayed Dick Groat's double play ground ball, which would have ended 
the inning without any damage done. His brother Clete, playing in his fifth 
consecutive Series with the Yankees, later conceded that he was privately 
thrilled for his brother because it was Ken's first Series. Then, in the 
decisive Game 7, he collected three hits (including a double and a home 
run), and scored three runs as St. Louis clinched the World Championship 
7–5, their first title since 1946. Clete also homered in that game, the 
only time in World Series history that brothers have homered in the same 
game.[9] Boyer earned National League MVP honors after hitting .295 with 
24 home runs and leading the league with 119 RBI, becoming the first NL 
third baseman to do so since Heinie Zimmerman in 1917; he was also honored 
as The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year, and received the 
Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for character and integrity. It was also his 
seventh consecutive season of 90 or more RBI, tying Pie Traynor's major 
league record for third basemen. Boyer hit exactly 24 home runs in each 
of 4 consecutive years (1961–1964) (32 homers in 1960 and 13 homers in 
1965) to set a record for most consecutive years with the same home run 
total and at least 20 home runs; the record was tied by Fred Lynn of the 
California Angels and Baltimore Orioles (23 each year from 1984 to 1987). 
On July 10, 1965, Boyer hit his 250th home run off Dick Ellsworth in the 
9th inning of a 5–3 road loss to the Cubs, and on September 28 he became 
the fifth Cardinal to drive in 1,000 runs, in the 9th inning of a 9–1 road 
win against the Giants. After 11 years with the Cardinals, Boyer began 
to suffer back problems in 1965, but still led the league in fielding percentage 
(.968) for the only time in his career; after batting just .260 with 13 
homers and 75 RBI. In October 1965, Boyer was traded to the New York Mets 
for Al Jackson and third baseman Charley Smith. With the downtrodden Mets, 
he was stuck on a losing team but managed to achieve several more career 
milestones. On May 13, 1966, he scored his 1,000th run in a 5–4 17-inning 
loss to the Giants; he ended the year batting .266 with 14 home runs and 
61 RBI. On May 10, 1967, he collected his 2,000th career hit, a single 
off Milt Pappas in the 4th inning of a 7–4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, 
and on May 20 he hit his 300th career double off Nelson Briles in an 11–9 
loss to the Cardinals. On July 27, 1967, with Boyer batting .235, the Mets 
traded him to the Chicago White Sox along with second baseman Sandy Alomar, 
in exchange for third baseman Bill Southworth, whose career ended after 
he spent the remainder of the year in the minors, and catcher J. C. Martin. 
Boyer hit .261 over the rest of the season, but the White Sox released 
him on May 2, 1968 after he batted only .125 in 10 games. Boyer signed 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 10, 1968, he hit .271 in his return 
to the NL, and appeared in his 2,000th game on September 7 in a 4–2 loss 
at Cincinnati. Boyer returned to the Dodgers in 1969, but was used almost 
exclusively as a pinch hitter; he appeared in his last game on August 9, 
1969, a 4–0 loss to the Cubs, grounding out as a pinch hitter in the 9th 
inning. After batting just .206 in 25 games that season, Boyer felt that 
his playing career was over and desired to become a coach; the Dodgers 
encouraged him to return as a player for the 1970 season, feeling that 
young players would be more likely to listen to him as a veteran player 
than as a coach, but Boyer chose to retire. In his 15-year MLB career, 
Boyer was a .287 hitter with 2,143 hits, 282 home runs and 1,141 RBI, 1,104 
runs scored, 318 doubles, 68 triples and 105 stolen bases in 2,034 games 
played; he also batted .348 with two home runs in his seven All-Star and 
ten All-Star Game appearances (played in 7/8 games in 1959–62).[10] His 
career slugging average of .462 ranked third among players with at least 
1,000 games at third base, behind Eddie Mathews (.509) and Ron Santo (then 
at .478), and among NL players he trailed only Mathews in assists and double 
plays at third base. Upon Clete's retirement in 1971, the Boyers' 444 career 
home runs (282 by Ken, 162 by Clete) were the fourth most in major league 
history by two brothers, behind Hank and Tommie Aaron (768) and the separate 
pairings of Joe DiMaggio with his brothers Vince (486) and Dom (448).[11] 
Boyer's 12 career walk-off hits for the Cardinals remain a record for any 
player since 1950, equaled only by Lou Brock and Albert Pujols.[12] On 
April 28, 2007, Pujols broke his Cardinals record for right-handed hitters 
with his 256th career home run, in an 8–1 loss to the Cubs; he had tied 
the mark six days earlier with a 3-run homer in the 12th inning at Chicago. 
Boyer became a manager in the Cardinals' minor league system, first leading 
the Arkansas Travelers of the Texas League in 1970. He returned to the 
Cardinals as a coach under former teammate Red Schoendienst in 1971–72, 
then went back to managing in the minors, leading the Gulf Coast League 
Cardinals (1973), Tulsa Oilers of the American Association (1974–76), and 
Rochester Red Wings of the International League (1977–78); he won a league 
title with Tulsa in 1974. Among the players he developed in the minors 
were Keith Hernandez, Garry Templeton, Mike Easler, Tito Landrum, and Larry 
Herndon. Boyer was named manager of the Cardinals in early 1978, after 
Vern Rapp was fired with the team at 6–11 (Jack Krol served as interim 
manager for two games), and posted a 62–81 record. The following year St. 
Louis finished in third place at 86–76, but Boyer was dismissed 51 games 
into the 1980 season with a record of 18–33; Krol again served a game as 
interim manager before Whitey Herzog took over the reins. Boyer finished 
with a 166–190 record in three seasons. He was scheduled to return to Rochester 
for the 1981 season, but lung cancer forced him to give up the job. Boyer 
became eligible for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1975, at a 
time when the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) had only 
elected one third baseman in thirty elections (Traynor in 1948); despite 
his 512 home runs, Mathews had received just 32% of the vote in 1974. Boyer 
fared no better in the voting than most other star third basemen, and received 
less than 5% of the vote every year before being dropped from consideration 
after the 1979 vote. After several years of complaints about overlooked 
candidates, Boyer was one of three players restored to the ballot in 1985, 
along with Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood and fellow third baseman Ron 
Santo – who had himself received less than 4% of the vote in his only year 
on the ballot in 1980. For four years, Boyer outpaced Santo in the voting, 
peaking at 25.5% of the vote in 1988; but popular support for Santo grew 
afterward, and he outdrew Boyer every year afterward until Boyer's eligibility 
expired after the 1994 vote. Santo received 43% of the vote in his final 
year in 1998. Boyer has since been a candidate on the Veterans Committee 
ballot in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Boyer appeared again on the Golden Era 
Committee (replaced the Veterans Committee in 2010 and votes every 3 years) 
ballot of 10 candidates from the 1947–1972 era, in 2011 and 2014. Ron Santo's 
nomination (the only candidate elected in 2011) in 2012 has led to suggestions 
that Boyer's chances of election to the Hall of Fame have increased, but 
in each of the two elections, Boyer fell short by 9 of the 12 required 
votes for Hall of Fame election. None of the 10 candidates (three of the 
nine player candidates including Boyer were MVP winners) were elected by 
the Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee in 2014. Boyer was inducted into 
the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.[13] In 2014, the Cardinals announced 
Boyer among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. 
Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[1] 
Ken Boyer married Kathleen Oliver in April 1952.[6] The couple had four 
children – Susie, David (born December 28, 1955), Danny, and Janie – but 
eventually divorced; David was drafted by the Cardinals in 1974 and played 
in their farm system until 1978. Boyer died from cancer in St. Louis, Missouri 
on September 7, 1982 at the age of 51; he had undergone laetrile treatments 
in Mexico in an attempt to fight the disease. He was survived by twelve 
of his thirteen siblings, and by his four children. He was buried in Friends 
Cemetery in Purcell, Missouri. His #14, which he wore throughout his career
