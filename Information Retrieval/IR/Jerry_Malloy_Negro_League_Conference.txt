The Jerry Malloy Negro League Conference (JMNLC)[1] is an annual conference 
sponsored by Negro Leagues Committee (NLC), a standing committee of the 
Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.[2] 
As of 2016, the NLC has held nineteen conferences in various cities known 
for their history in hosting Negro League baseball teams. The JMNLC is 
the first and remains the only such event dedicated exclusively to the 
examination of black baseball history. The objective of the conference 
and committee is to encourage the study and research of Negro League baseball, 
pre-Negro League baseball, African-Americans in baseball, and the positive 
influence on American society by the elimination of racial barriers. This 
national conference attracts scholars, historians, collectors, social activists, 
and fans of the game. The Conference focus includes scholarly, literary, 
and educational components. The Conference has been an annual SABR event 
since 1998, and was named in memory of Jerry Malloy (1946â€“2000) after his 
death. Malloy was a journalist and was considered by his peers in SABR 
to be a skilled authority on 19th century black baseball. Malloy was an 
important member of the Negro Leagues Committee and a respected researcher 
and historian. Admission to the conference is open to all. The 2016 conference 
is being held in Kansas City, Missouri, July 7-9.[1] Past conferences have 
been held in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (1998, 2000, 2003), Kansas City, 
Missouri (2001, 2006), Chicago, Illinois (2005, 2008), Atlantic City, New 
Jersey (1999), Memphis, Tennessee (2002), Cleveland, Ohio (2004, 2012), 
Portsmouth, Virginia (2007), Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (2009, 2015), Birmingham, 
Alabama (2010), Indianapolis, Indiana (2011), Newark, New Jersey (2013) 
and Detroit, Michigan (2014). Since 2004, the conference has also included 
an update on the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project. The SABR 
Negro Leagues Committee announces the following awards during the conference: 
Between ten and 14 research presentations are given at every conference, 
ranging from historical research to statistical studies to entertaining 
stories, covering any subject related to the history of African-American 
baseball. A trivia contest (related to Negro leagues history) with prizes 
for the winner is held, and two auctions (one silent, one live) are conducted. 
Fundraising is also done to help pay to mark the graves of former Negro 
league players. The effort, known as the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker 
Project has provided a headstone for more than 30 players since 2004. An 
authors panel is held, and book signings are done afterward. A bus tour 
is done of most host cities, citing the memorable spots related to that 
city's Negro leagues history, and an awards banquet is held in which the 
four named awards are announced, plus two $2,500 youth scholarships, based 
upon submitted essays, and two $1,000 library grants. A seminar on Negro 
leagues history is held during the conference for education professionals, 
and an academic journal, based on presentations made during the conference, 
is published later in the year in partnership with McFarland & Company.
