Nolan James Arenado (/ɛərəˈnɑːdoʊ/; born April 16, 1991) is an American 
professional baseball third baseman for the Colorado Rockies of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He made his Major League debut on April 28, 2013, at the 
age of 22. An exceptionally skilled defender, he has achieved the Rawlings 
Gold Glove Award in each of his first four MLB seasons and is also a winner 
of the Fielding Bible and Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Awards for 
his position. In 2015, Arenado earned his first All-Star selection and 
Silver Slugger Award while leading the National League in home runs and 
runs batted in. Arenado attended El Toro High School in Lake Forest, California, 
where he played shortstop on the school's baseball team[1] with fellow 
future major leaguer Austin Romine.[2] In 2008, his junior year, El Toro 
won the California Interscholastic Federation Southern Section championship.[3] 
He was named to the Los Angeles Times' All-Star team after leading his 
division with a .456 batting average, 32 runs batted in (RBI), and 33 runs 
scored.[4] As a senior in 2009, Arenado had a .517 batting average, a .615 
on-base percentage (OBP), five home runs (HR), 14 doubles, and a triple,[5] 
and was again named to the Los Angeles Times' All-Star team.[6] He committed 
to attend Arizona State University on a baseball scholarship.[1] The Colorado 
Rockies selected Arenado in the second round with the 59th overall selection 
of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft.[7] Rather than attend Arizona 
State, he signed with the Rockies, and made his professional debut with 
the Casper Ghosts of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, where he batted .300.[5] 
In 2010, Arenado played for the Asheville Tourists of the Class A South 
Atlantic League, where he posted a .308 batting average and 41 doubles.[5] 
Prior to the 2011 season, Baseball America named Arenado the Rockies' third-best 
prospect and the 80th-best overall.[8][9] Playing for the Modesto Nuts 
of the Class A-Advanced California League, Arenado, along with Wilin Rosario 
represented the Rockies at the 2011 All-Star Futures Game, following a 
strong first half, where he had a .283 batting average with six home runs 
and 42 RBI.[10] He finished the season with a .298 batting average and 
20 home runs, leading the minor leagues with 122 RBI.[11] Later in the 
year, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the Arizona Fall League 
(AFL) after hitting .388 with six home runs and 33 RBI.[12][13] In 163 
games combined in the California League and AFL in 2011, Arenado hit .315 
with 201 hits, 155 RBI, 26 home runs and 44 doubles.[14] Playing for the 
Tulsa Drillers of the Class AA Texas League in 2012, he was again named 
to appear in the All-Star Futures Game.[11] He finished the year with a 
.285 batting average, 12 home runs and 56 RBI.[5] Despite a strong spring 
training showing in 2013, the Rockies optioned Arenado to the Colorado 
Springs Sky Sox of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) to start the 
season.[15] After starting with a .364 batting average, a 1.059 on-base 
plus slugging percentage (OPS), three home runs, and 21 RBI with Colorado 
Springs, Colorado designated Chris Nelson for assignment and promoted Arenado 
in his place on April 28.[16] He went 0-for-3 in his debut against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field. In his second game, against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, he recorded his first three major league hits, including 
his first home run in a 12–2 win.[17] In his sixth game, he hit first major 
league grand slam and second career home run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher 
David Price. On October 29, 2013, Arenado became the first rookie to win 
a Rawlings Gold Glove Award at third base since 1957.[18] In his first 
big league season, Arenado slashed .267/.301/.405 with 10 home runs and 
52 RBI. The first mult-home run game of Arenado's career occurred on April 
5, 2014, against Brandon McCarthy of the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 9–4 
Rockies win.[19] On May 8, Arenado broke the Rockies franchise hit streak 
record, which Michael Cuddyer set the previous season, by hitting safely 
in 28 consecutive games.[20] On May 23, he suffered a mallet fracture of 
his left middle finger on a headfirst slide into second base in a game 
against the Atlanta Braves, and was subsequently placed on the 15-day disabled 
list (DL).[21] Arenado missed 37 games due to the fracture, returning on 
June 28. He earned his first career National League (NL) Player of the 
Week Award for the week ending August 24. He batted .545 with a 1.645 OPS 
and 12 hits, three doubles, one triple, two home runs, three RBI, and six 
runs scored.[22] Due to a chest contusion and early onset pneumonia, Arenado 
missed additional time at the end of the season. On the year, he batted 
.287/.328/.500, hitting 18 HR and driving in 61 runs. He won his second 
Gold Glove Award despite playing just 111 games. In 2015, Arenado earned 
his second NL Player of the Week Award on June 28, hitting a major league-leading 
three mult-home runs games in six games, seven home runs and 14 RBI. He 
also scored 10 times, second-highest in the major leagues.[23] He became 
an MLB All-Star for the first time as a National League reserve at Great 
American Ball Park in Cincinnati. At the time his selection was announced, 
he was fifth in the majors in home runs with 24 and led in RBI with 68. 
He had hit more home runs in road games than at Coors Field (15 to nine), 
more RBI (37 to 31) and posted higher on-base (.318 to .309) and slugging 
(.615 to .580) percentages.[24][25] Playing against the San Francisco Giants 
on September 5, Arenado homered in his sixth consecutive game, breaking 
the Rockies' team record of five which Dante Bichette and Larry Walker 
shared.[26] He won his first NL Player of the Month in September, batting 
.339 and leading the major leagues with 11 HR, 32 RBI, and 79 total bases. 
He collected an NL-leading 38 hits and was second in the league with .705 
SLG.[27] For the season, Arenado tied Bryce Harper for the NL home run 
title with 42,[28] and led the National League with 130 RBI and 354 total 
bases. In addition, he batted .287 with a .323 OBP, .575 SLG, 43 doubles 
and 13 intentional walks on his way to winning his first Silver Slugger 
Award for third basemen.[29] He was the first Rockies player to lead the 
NL in home runs since Walker hit 49 in 1997 and the first to lead the majors 
in RBI since Andrés Galarraga with 150 in 1996. Additionally, Arenado set 
a major league record for extra base hits by a third baseman in one season 
with 89, surpassing Chipper Jones' total of 87 in 1999.[27] On defense, 
he won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award,[30][31] and, for the first 
time, was the major league-wide winner for third baseman of the Fielding 
Bible[32] and the Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Awards.[33] He became 
the second Rockies player to win the Fielding Bible at any position, following 
shortstop Troy Tulowitzki.[32] The Colorado Sports Hall of Fame named Arenado 
the winner of their Professional Athlete of the Year Award for 2015.[34] 
Arenado finished eighth in the voting for the National League MVP award, 
behind Harper, Paul Goldschmidt, Joey Votto, Anthony Rizzo, Andrew McCutchen, 
Jake Arrieta and Zack Greinke. Arenado and the Rockies avoided salary arbitration 
on January 15, 2016, agreeing to a one-year, $5 million contract, a raise 
from $512,000 in 2015.[35] He was named NL co-Player of the Week with Harper 
for April 18 after leading the NL with four home runs and 12 RBI. He carried 
an .852 SLG, led the NL with 23 total bases, and tied for second with seven 
runs scored.[36] Arenado made his second All-Star Game, played at Petco 
Park in San Diego.[37] He hit his 100th career home on run on August 8, 
making him the youngest player in franchise history to do so, at just under 
age 25 years and four months.[38] He became the second player aged 25 and 
younger within the previous 75 seasons to drive in 125 runs in successive 
seasons.[39] Overall, in 160 games, Arenado finished the year with a .294 
batting average, 182 hits, 35 doubles, 6 triples, an NL-leading 41 home 
runs, 116 runs scored, an MLB-leading 133 RBI, 82 extra base hits, 352 
total bases, 68 walks (double the amount from 2015), 10 intentional walks, 
a .362 OBP, a .570 SLG and a .932 OPS. Arenado won his fourth Gold Glove 
at third base, becoming the first third baseman in MLB history to win four 
Gold Gloves in his first four seasons, as well as his second Silver Slugger. 
Nolan Arenado will play for Team USA in the 2017 World Baseball Classic.[40] 
Notes: Through 2015 season. Per Baseball-Reference.com. Arenado's father 
is Cuban and his mother is Puerto Rican.[41] Arenado's brother, Jonah, 
plays baseball in the San Francisco Giants' organization.[42] Formerly, 
Arenado's agent was Scott Boras; however, as of November 2015, it was Joel 
Wolfe of Wasserman Media Group.[43] When asked who his favorite player 
is, Arenado named former Rockie Matt Holliday. He noted that he attempted 
to mimic his swing, "because he stayed through the ball so much."[44] Longtime 
Dodgers play-by-play announcer Vin Scully autographed the bat with which 
Arenado his his 40th home run of 2016, during Scully's last season of broadcasting,
