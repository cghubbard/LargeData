Jerome A. Neudecker (August 13, 1930 – January 11, 1997) was a Major League 
Baseball umpire who worked in the American League from 1966 to 1985. He 
wore number 6 when the league adopted uniform numbers in 1980. Born in 
Marine, Illinois, Neudecker attended Johnson's Umpire School, run by former 
NL umpire Steamboat Johnson. After attending the umpire school, Neudecker 
began working in the Georgia–Florida League in 1950. In 1951, he moved 
to the Evangeline Baseball League.[1] While serving in the Air Force, stationed 
in Valdosta, Georgia, Neudecker returned to the Georgia-Florida league 
in 1954 and 1955. In 1956, he began work in the South Atlantic League, 
before returning to the Air Force and serving until 1960.[1] Neudecker 
resumed working in the South Atlantic League in 1960 and continued on through 
1962. The league's name was then changed to the Southern League, and Neudecker 
continued umpiring there through 1965, before being called up to the American 
League at the end of the 1965 season.[1] Neudecker worked in three All-Star 
Games (1966, 1972 and 1976) four American League Championship Series (1970, 
1974, 1977 and 1981) and two World Series (1973 and 1979). He was the home 
plate umpire in Game 7 of the 1979 Series, which the Pittsburgh Pirates 
won after Willie Stargell's sixth-inning home run gave them a 2-1 lead 
and propelled them to a third straight victory over the Baltimore Orioles, 
who had led the Series three games to one. Neudecker also officiated in 
four no-hitters, including being the home plate umpire for two: Joe Horlen's 
on September 10, 1967 [2] and Catfish Hunter's perfect game on May 8, 1968.[3] 
Neudecker was the last full-time Major League umpire to use a "balloon" 
chest protector. (Bill Deegan, who had quit during the 1980 season, wore 
this chest protector during two umpire strikes: on Opening Day, 1991, and 
for two games during the 1995 season.) After his retirement, his chest 
protector was sent to the Baseball Hall of Fame.[4] Neudecker became the 
assistant supervisor of American League umpires in 1986, working under 
Marty Springstead. At the time of his death, he was working in the Baseball 
Umpire Development program.[5] Neudecker died of cancer at age 66 at Fort 
Walton Beach, Florida, and was buried there at Beal Memorial Cemetery.[6][7]
