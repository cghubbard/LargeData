John Edwin Blanchard (February 26, 1933 – March 25, 2009) was a professional 
baseball player who played in the Major Leagues primarily as an outfielder 
and catcher from 1955 and 1959–1965. Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Blanchard 
attended DeLaSalle High School before transferring to Central High School, 
where he played football and basketball in addition to baseball. He played 
semi-professional baseball in Iowa before being signed by the New York 
Yankees to a professional contract. After three seasons of playing in the 
minor leagues, and a two-year period in which he served in the U.S. Army, 
Blanchard played briefly for the Yankees in 1955. It took Blanchard four 
years to return to the major leagues, but he gained playing time in 1960 
due to injuries to the Yankees' top two catchers.[1] Sportswriter Bill 
Madden called Blanchard "probably the most famous third-string catcher 
in baseball history."[2] Blanchard remained with the Yankees through 1965, 
mainly serving as a backup catcher, and played 93 games during the team's 
World Series-winning 1961 season, hitting 21 home runs.[3] Among those 
were four home runs in consecutive at-bats during a three-game span, a 
total that set a major league record.[4] A defensive liability for the 
Yankees for most of his career, Blanchard is probably best known for his 
play in the 1961 World Series. He hit 2 home runs in that series against 
the Cincinnati Reds and batted .400 for the entire series.[5] In his career, 
Blanchard appeared in the World Series 5 times for the Yankees and holds 
the Major League record with ten World Series pinch-hit at-bats. Blanchard 
was the catcher who called the pitch that Bill Mazeroski hit for the first-ever 
series ending home run off Ralph Terry in the 1960 World Series in which 
the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the heavily favored Yankees. Blanchard 
was traded to the Kansas City Athletics in 1965, as part of a three-player 
transaction. He remained with the team until September 1965, when his contract 
was sold to the Milwaukee Braves. After 10 games with the Braves in 1965, 
Blanchard did not play baseball in 1966; a comeback attempt in 1968 was 
unsuccessful.[1] For his major league career, he played in 516 games, posting 
a .239 batting average, hitting 67 home runs, and driving in 200 runs.[3] 
Blanchard died of a heart attack in North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale, 
Minnesota on March 25, 2009.[6] His funeral was held at The Church of St. 
Mary of the Lake in Plymouth, Minnesota on Monday March 30, 2009 at 11:00AM.
