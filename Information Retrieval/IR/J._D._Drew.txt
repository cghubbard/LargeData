David Jonathan "J. D." Drew (born November 20, 1975) is a former American 
Major League Baseball right fielder. He is a left-handed hitter, and began 
his major league career in 1998 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He is the 
brother of two other major league players, Stephen and Tim. Drew attended 
Florida State University, where he played under head coach Mike Martin. 
At Florida State, he was the winner of the 1997 Dick Howser Trophy and 
the 1997 Golden Spikes Award, was named the 1997 Collegiate Baseball Player 
of the Year, the 1997 Sporting News Player of the Year, and was a consensus 
All-American (1997). He also was named the 1997 ACC Player of the Year. 
He was a 1996 member of Team USA. Drew was First Team in 1996, Freshman 
All-American in 1995 and was named to the College World Series All Tournament 
Team in 1995. He was the first player in college baseball history to hit 
30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season. He set a Florida State 
record by batting .455 in 1997 while becoming one of only three players 
in college baseball history to have 100 hits, 100 runs and 100 RBIs. During 
his college career, Drew broke 17 school and conference records. The Philadelphia 
Phillies made Drew the second overall pick after pitcher Matt Anderson 
in the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. Drew and his agent Scott Boras 
chose not to sign with the Phillies, insisting Drew would not sign for 
less than $10 million. The Phillies had no plan to pay an unproven player 
this amount of money, and despite Boras' warnings, drafted Drew nonetheless. 
They offered him $2.6 million.[1] Consequently, Drew ended up playing for 
the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. Boras had Drew 
sign with the Northern League because of a loophole in the rules of the 
MLB Amateur Draft.[2] After playing for St. Paul in the 1997 season, Drew 
was selected in the first round of the draft, fifth overall in 1998 by 
the St. Louis Cardinals. In June he signed a $7 million contract,[1] then 
hit .316 through 26 games with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. He was recalled 
by the Cardinals and made his debut on September 8, 1998 (the game in which 
teammate Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris' single-season home run record). 
His first at bat, in the 6th inning, ended in a strikeout, and he finished 
the night 0-for-2. He ended up going 15-for-36 (.417) during 1998, with 
five home runs. On August 9, on what would have been Drew's first game 
in Philadelphia, he sat out, citing a bruised right hand. In an attempt 
to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, 
which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, 
however, and he was booed and heckled throughout batting practice. The 
only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders 
in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice.[3] On 
August 10, 1999, in Drew's first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, 
he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. 
The Phillie Phanatic got into the act, dropping two large trash bags marked 
with dollar signs in the outfield between innings.[4] Drew struggled to 
stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. 
Louis. In his book Three Nights in August, Buzz Bissinger mentions former 
manager Tony La Russa's frustration with Drew's lack of passion. La Russa 
tells Bissinger that it seems Drew has decided to "settle for 75%" of his 
talent, in large part because of his enormous contract.[5] On December 
13, 2003, Drew was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with catcher Eli 
Marrero for starting pitcher Jason Marquis, relief pitcher Ray King, and 
rookie prospect Adam Wainwright.[6] There, he had the best season of his 
career while finally managing to stay healthy. In 2004, he displayed excellent 
power, patience, and defense hitting .305 with 31 home runs, 118 walks, 
and 93 RBI, finishing 6th in the MVP voting. In December 2004, Drew signed 
a five-year, $55 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers,[7] which 
included an escape clause after the second year. Roughly halfway through 
the 2005 season, Drew's season was again cut short after being hit on the 
wrist by a pitch from Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher Brad Halsey. On September 
18, 2006, Drew was part of only the fourth-ever set of back-to-back-to-back-to-back 
home runs with fellow Dodgers Jeff Kent, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson.[citation 
needed] In 2006, Drew exercised his contract opt-out clause, forgoing $33 
million over the next 3 years to become a free agent. The Dodgers' General 
Manager Ned Colletti said in a teleconference that he was "surprised how 
it came down. Everything we had heard, everything that had been written 
led us to believe the player loved being here."[8] This was especially 
a surprise since a few days before, Drew had told an LA Times columnist 
on how happy he was in LA and that he was looking forward to the upcoming 
2007 season. Drew had a very good season, batting .284 with 20 home runs 
and 100 RBIs. On January 26, 2007, Drew officially signed a five-year contract 
with the Red Sox worth $70 million. Drew's revised contract had a clause 
that allowed the Red Sox to opt out of Drew's five-year contract after 
three or four years if Drew has extensive injuries due to a previously 
existing problem in his right shoulder. Drew was again part of a set of 
four consecutive home runs on April 22, 2007, in a game against the New 
York Yankees, this time joining with Manny Ram√≠rez, Mike Lowell, and Jason 
Varitek. He is the only player to participate twice in a string of four 
straight home runs, and he was the second player to go deep in each instance. 
Drew finished the 2007 season with a .270 batting average, 11 home runs, 
and 64 RBI.[9] On October 20, 2007, Drew hit a grand slam in Game 6 of 
the 2007 ALCS with the Red Sox facing elimination. The home run, along 
with brother Stephen Drew's for the Arizona Diamondbacks, marks the third 
time that two brothers have both hit home runs in the same postseason. 
In 2008, Drew hit the 2nd longest home run in Fenway Park history, at 500 
feet, which was also the longest in 2008; he finished with a .280 average, 
with an OBP of .408 and a slugging percentage of .519.[10] At the end of 
June, Drew was named the AL Player of the Month after hitting .337 and 
hitting 12 home runs while taking over for David Ortiz's three-spot in 
the lineup while he was on the disabled list.[11] Drew was officially announced 
as an A.L. All-Star reserve on July 6. This was Drew's first All-Star game 
appearance. He hit a 2-run homer in his first at-bat as an All-Star en 
route to winning the game's MVP award. In what was to become the longest 
All-Star Game time-wise in MLB history, the American League (and Drew's 
Red Sox) manager Terry Francona, having almost run out of pitchers, contemplated 
putting Drew, a former high school hurler, on the mound to close the game. 
"I'd have been ready", Drew said. "I've had an opportunity to throw a lot 
in the outfield. I don't know if I would have gotten anyone out, but I'd 
have thrown something up there."[12] Drew later visited the 15-day disabled 
list, spending from August 27 to September 8 on the DL with a strained 
lower back. On October 3, in Game 2 of the 2008 American League Division 
Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Drew hit a go-ahead two-run 
home run. On October 16, in Game 5 of the American League Championship 
Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, Drew helped to bring the Red Sox back 
from a late-inning seven-run deficit with a two-run home run in the eighth 
inning and then delivered the walk-off hit in the ninth. The Game 5 comeback, 
sparked by Drew, is the second-biggest in postseason history and is the 
largest for a team on the brink of elimination. However, the Red Sox lost 
to the Rays in the seventh game. After the 2009 season, Drew's statistics 
began to decline. That year, he hit .279 with an .392 OBP while hitting 
24 home runs and 68 RBI. The following year, he hit .255 with 22 home runs 
with 68 RBI. However, he played in 139 games, his highest total since 2007 
when he joined Boston. In 2011, Drew hit .222 with 4 home runs and 22 RBI. 
He played in 81 games and had a .315 OBP. Drew retired from professional 
baseball at the end of the 2011 season. Drew's younger brother, Tim, was 
also drafted in the first round in 1997, making them the first brothers 
drafted in the first round of the Major League Baseball Draft in the same 
year.[citation needed] J.D., Tim, and their brother Stephen have all been 
on MLB rosters. Drew married his girlfriend Sheigh, on November 10, 2001,
