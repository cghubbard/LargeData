Champaign (English /ˌʃæmˈpeɪn/) is a city in Champaign County, Illinois, 
United States. The city is 135 miles (217 km) south of Chicago, 124 miles 
(200 km) west of Indianapolis, Indiana, and 178 mi (286 km) northeast of 
St. Louis, Missouri. The United States Census Bureau estimates the city 
was home to 84,513 people as of July 1, 2014.[3] Champaign is the tenth-most 
populous city in Illinois, and the state's fourth-most populous city outside 
of the Chicago metropolitan area. Champaign is notable for sharing the 
campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign with its sister 
city of Urbana. Champaign is also the home of Parkland College which serves 
about 18,000 students during the academic year.[4] Due to the university 
and a number of well known technology startup companies, it is often referred 
to as the hub, or a significant landmark, of the Silicon Prairie. Champaign 
houses offices for Abbott, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Caterpillar, Deere 
& Company, Dow Chemical Company, IBM, State Farm, and Intel all of which 
are Fortune 500 companies, and for Sony.[5] Champaign was founded in 1855, 
when the Illinois Central Railroad laid its rail track two miles (3 km) 
west of downtown Urbana. Originally called "West Urbana", it was renamed 
Champaign when it acquired a city charter in 1860. Both the city and county 
name were derived from Champaign County, Ohio.[6] During February 1969, 
Carl Perkins joined with Bob Dylan to write the song "Champaign, Illinois", 
which Perkins released on his album On Top.[7] The band Old 97's took another 
Bob Dylan song, "Desolation Row", and combined its melody with new lyrics 
to make a new song "Champaign, Illinois", which they released with Dylan's 
blessing on their 2010 album The Grand Theatre Volume One. It achieved 
considerable popularity. The two "Champaign, Illinois" songs are not similar 
to each other, except that Bob Dylan was involved in both of them. On September 
22, 1985, Champaign hosted the first Farm Aid concert at the University 
of Illinois' Memorial Stadium. The concert drew a crowd of 80,000 people 
and raised over $7 million for American family farmers. In 2005, Champaign-Urbana 
(specifically the University of Illinois) was the location of the National 
Science Olympiad Tournament, attracting young scientists from all 50 states. 
The city also hosts the state Science Olympiad competition every year. 
The University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign once again hosted the National 
competition on May 20–22, 2010. In 2013, Champaign was rated fifth best 
place in the United States for a healthy work-life balance.[8] According 
to the 2010 census, Champaign has a total area of 22.457 square miles (58.16 km2), 
of which 22.43 square miles (58.09 km2) (or 99.88%) is land and 0.027 square 
miles (0.07 km2) (or 0.12%) is water.[9] Champaign is located on relatively 
high ground, providing sources to the Kaskaskia River to the west, and 
the Embarras River to the south. Downtown Champaign drains into Boneyard 
Creek, which feeds the Saline Branch of the Salt Fork Vermilion River.[10] 
Champaign shares a border with the neighboring city of Urbana; together 
they are home to the University of Illinois. Champaign, Urbana, and the 
bordering village of Savoy form the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area 
also known as Champaign-Urbana. It may also be colloquially known as the 
"Twin Cities" or Chambana.[citation needed] The following diagram represents 
localities within a 35 miles (56 km) radius of Champaign. The city has 
a humid continental climate, typical of the Midwestern United States, with 
hot summers and cold, moderately snowy winters. Temperatures exceed 90 °F 
(32.2 °C) on an average of 24 days per year, and typically fall below 0 °F 
(−17.8 °C) on six nights annually.[11] The record high temperature in Champaign 
was 109 °F (42.8 °C) in 1954, and the record low was −25 °F (−31.7 °C), 
recorded on four separate occasions − in 1899, 1905, 1994 and 1999.[12]

List of mayors:[17] The representative body of Champaign is known as the 
City Council. Currently, the City Council is composed of three At-Large 
members and one member from each of the five council districts located 
within the city limits. As of July 2016, its members are: Tom Bruno (At-Large), 
Will Kyles (At-Large), Matthew Gladney (At-Large), Clarissa Fourman (District 
1), Michael LaDue (District 2), Angie Brix (District 3), Greg Stock (District 
4), and Paul Faraci (District 5).[18] Scott Bennett (D) represents Champaign 
in the Illinois Senate while Carol Ammons (D) represents Champaign in the 
Illinois House of Representatives. Rodney L. Davis (R) serves Illinois's 
13th congressional district, which includes Champaign, in the United States 
House of Representatives. In addition to the University of Illinois, Champaign 
is also home to Parkland College. Herff Jones, formerly the Collegiate 
Cap and Gown, also forms part of the city's industrial base. The city also 
features a large technology and software industry mostly focusing on research 
and development of new technologies. The Research Park, located in southern 
Champaign and backed by the University of Illinois, is home to many companies, 
including Riverbed Technology, Citrix Systems, Abbott Laboratories, Dow 
Innovation Center, Intelligent Medical Objects, Yahoo! and the State Farm 
Research Center.[19][20] Numerous other software and technology companies 
also have offices in Champaign including AMD, Intel, IBM, Amdocs, Infobright, 
Instarecon, Phonak, Power World, Caterpillar Simulation Center, and Volition, 
Inc.. The largest high technology employer is Wolfram Research, with more 
than 400 employees in Champaign.[21] The United States Army Corps of Engineers 
maintains the Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) in Champaign. 
Champaign is also home to nationally recognized record labels, artist management 
companies, booking agencies and recording studios. Polyvinyl Records, Undertow 
Music, Parasol Records, Great Western Record Recorders, Pogo Studios, and 
Nicodemus Booking Agency are all based in Champaign. In April 2011, the 
Christian Science Monitor named Champaign-Urbana one of the five cities 
leading the economic turnaround based on jobs; the information sector added 
over 300 jobs within a year and unemployment dropped 2.1%.[22] According 
to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[23] the top employers 
in the city are: Other major employers include Jimmy John's, Futaba Corporation, 
and Horizon Hobby. The Champaign City Building serves as the City Hall 
and is a recognizable landmark. The building replaces the original city 
building, which sat on the same site until 1937. In the 1980s, part of 
the downtown Champaign area (Neil St.) was closed to vehicular traffic 
to create a pedestrian mall, but this short-lived experiment was scrapped 
when business declined. As part of a revitalization effort, One Main Development 
constructed two new mixed-use buildings: One Main and M2 on Neil. The City 
of Champaign gave $3.7 million in tax incentives for the building of M2 
and agreed to pay nearly $11 million for a new parking deck.[24] This growth 
in downtown Champaign coincided with the larger growth of the "north Prospect" 
shopping district on the city's northern boundary. The growth in the north 
Prospect area relied, in part, on leapfrogging, moving out to the countryside 
and developing more remote farm land that eventually connects to the main 
development. Given the overwhelming success of such suburban shopping areas 
nationally, new development within any city center represented an alternative 
to the dominant movement out and away from the cities. In April 2007, One 
Main Development broke ground on M2 on Neil, a nine-story, $40 million, 
mixed-use project – the largest ever for downtown Champaign – located at 
the corner of Neil and Church Street. M2 on Neil features retail and office 
space, and 50 upscale condominiums. The project was expected to be complete 
in late 2008, but experienced delays in construction, partially due to 
$5 Million in mechanics liens filed against One Main Development,[25] as 
well as a large fire on an adjacent property that caused substantial facade 
damage to M2.[26] Construction on the commercial shell and core and the 
residences was completed in the Summer of 2009. New condo owners began 
moving into M2 in April 2009, and 13 of 51 have sold. The property began 
offering condos for rent with flexible lease periods in early 2010. 25,000 
(of a total 100,000) square feet of office space was complete and occupied 
by the Enclave at M2 in July 2009. The remaining commercial space in the 
building is build-to-suit space and is completed as new tenants move in. 
The first ground-floor tenant, a branch of local BankChampaign, opened 
its doors in November 2009.[27] In November 2010, construction began on 
the anchor retail tenant, Destihl. The restaurant and brewpub opened in 
Spring 2011, and two other restaurants opened in ground-floor space in 
Fall 2011. In mid-2011, the second floor was rendered vacant once again 
with the sudden evacuation of Mezolink, after Mezolink's partner was indicted 
in a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scheme.[28] The City of Champaign 
has constructed a six-story parking structure on Hill Street adjacent to 
M2, intended to service the greater Downtown; it was completed in May 2009.[29]

website.[30] The Art Theater Co-op, which shows critically acclaimed independent 
and foreign films, was built in 1913 as the Park Theatre. It has since 
undergone several changes in name and repertoire, including a phase from 
1969 to 1986, in which it showed adult films.[31] The theater is the only 
single-screen movie theater still in existence operating daily as a movie 
theater in Champaign-Urbana, and is the nation's first co-operatively owned 
art movie theater.[32] The historic Virginia Theatre is a recently restored 
1525-seat movie theater, dating back to the 1920s. It has an ornate, Spanish 
Renaissance-influenced interior, full stage and dressing rooms, and an 
elaborate Wurlitzer pipe organ. It hosts Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film 
Festival[33] and has a single 56' x 23' screen. The theater does not have 
a daily show schedule, but schedules special screenings and live performances 
several times each month. Located along Green Street, this commercial district 
serves as the entertainment and retail center for students at the University 
of Illinois. This area has been undergoing change since 2002 with the completion 
of a new $7 million streetscape project. Campustown is now attracting new 
retail and entertainment stores as well as serving as the center for new 
construction projects. Several new projects opened in 2008 including the 
18-story Burnham 310 high-rise and grocery store at 4th and Springfield, 
and a new 24-story apartment building called 309 Green.[34] The newly renamed 
Tower at 3rd (formerly Champaign Hilton, Century 21, Quality Inn, University 
Inn, Presidential Tower) is located in the University District and is over 
twenty stories high. A hotel until 2001, it currently houses student apartments.[35] 
A new 14-story apartment complex will be completed by fall 2014 at the 
intersection of 6th and Green streets (site of the former Gameday Spirit).[36] 
A 12-story, mixed-use complex consisting of a hotel, apartments and parking 
is scheduled to be completed by August 2015. The mixed-use complex is reported 
to consist of two towers which will be connected by a skywalk. A 27-story 
apartment building is planned at 308 East Green Street.[37] This high-rise 
is reported to have an automated parking vault which will be operated by 
an elevator.[38] There are 60 parks, 11 trails, and 14 facilities within 
the city of Champaign, totaling over 654 acres (2.65 km2).[39] The University 
of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign fields ten men and eleven women varsity 
sports. Built from 1922–1923, Memorial Stadium was named in honor of the 
students and faculty members who died overseas during World War I. Since 
opening in 1923, Memorial Stadium has been home to Illinois Fighting Illini 
football. The stadium also was the temporary home of the NFL's Chicago 
Bears for the 2002 season while its regular venue Soldier Field was being 
renovated. Originally Assembly Hall, the State Farm Center is home to the 
Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball and Illinois Fighting Illini 
women's basketball teams. It holds the annual Broadway Series, which features 
popular musicals. During its history, the city has been home to several 
separate minor league baseball clubs. The first in 1889 was a shared club 
between Champaign and Logansport, Indiana called the Logansport/Champaign-Urbana 
Clippers. The Clippers played for one season in the Illinois–Indiana League 
before folding.[46] The city hosted its second team, the Champaign-Urbana 
Velvets from 1911–1914 who played in the Illinois–Missouri League until 
the league disbanded after 1914.[47] The city's most recent minor league 
team was the Champaign-Urbana Bandits who played during the single 1994 
season of the Great Central League.[48] The Bandits played at Illinois 
Field. Prior to holding postseason play, the league folded. Twice Champaign 
was also home to a Collegiate Summer Baseball League team. The city's Champaign 
County Colts were a founding member of the Central Illinois Collegiate 
League from 1963–1964. In 1990 the Colts were revived as the Champaign-Urbana 
Colts until the team folded in 1996. The more recent club played its home 
games at Illinois Field.[49] In October 2014, the Midwest Professional 
Basketball Association announced the creation of the Champaign Swarm as 
one of its founding members, scheduled to begin play at the Dodds Athletic 
Center in January 2015. The city of Champaign is served by Champaign Unit 
4 School District. Unit 4 administers both Champaign Central High School 
and Champaign Centennial High School. Champaign is also served by two private 
high schools. The larger of the two is a Roman Catholic High school, St. 
Thomas More High School which is located on the city's far northwest side. 
The school opened in 2000 and is the newest charter of the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Peoria. The other is Judah Christian School, which is located 
just south of I-74 on Prospect Avenue. Judah Christian opened in 1983 and 
serves about 120 9th- 12th grade students. The entire school's pre-K through 
12th grade enrollment is a little more than 500 students. Located within 
Champaign are two institutions of higher education, the University of Illinois 
at Urbana–Champaign and Parkland College. Champaign is served by I-57, 
I-72, I-74, two railroad lines, and the University of Illinois operated 
Willard Airport (CMI). Interstate Highways Interstate 57 Interstate 72 
Interstate 74 US Highways US 45 US 150 Illinois Highways Route 10 Champaign 
is served by Willard Airport (CMI) which is operated by the University 
of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The airport is currently served by American 
Airlines offering daily flights to Chicago O'Hare International Airport 
and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Housed at the Willard Airport 
was the University of Illinois Institute of Aviation, which was forced 
to close for the 2013–2014 academic year due to university budget cuts 
after 60 years of operation. The local bus system, which is supported by 
the taxpayers of the Champaign-Urbana Mass Transit District (MTD) and the 
University of Illinois, serves Champaign, Urbana, Savoy, and surrounding 
areas. The C-U MTD has twice been named as the best local transit system 
in the United States.[50] In 1999, a newly designed intermodal transportation 
center, aptly named Illinois Terminal by historic reference to the defunct 
electric interurban rail line that once ran through Champaign, was completed 
and serves as a central facility for intercity passenger rail, bus services 
as well as the MTD's local bus network. Amtrak provides service to Champaign-Urbana 
by Train 58/59, the City of New Orleans, Train 390/391, the Saluki Train 
392/393, the Illini. The former Illinois Central Railroad line — now part 
of the Canadian National system — runs north to south through the city. 
A spur line from the Canadian National line provides service to several 
large industries, including two large food processing plants, on the west 
edge of Champaign and two grain elevators in outlying communities to the 
west. The Norfolk Southern operates an east to west line through Champaign. 
The NS line connects industries in eastern Urbana to the Norfolk Southern 
main line at Mansfield, Illinois, west of Champaign. The line now operated 
by Norfolk Southern is the former Peoria & Eastern Railway, later operated 
as part of the Big Four (Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway), 
New York Central, Penn Central, and Conrail systems, being sold by Conrail 
to Norfolk Southern in 1996. Construction of the line was begun by the 
Danville, Urbana, Bloomington and Pekin Railroad. This short-lived entity 
became part of the Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway before 
the railroad was completed. Greyhound Lines, Peoria Charter Coach Company 
and Suburban Express bus companies provide intercity bus service to Champaign.[51] 
NOAA Weather Radio station WXJ76 transmits from Champaign and is licensed 
to NOAA's National Weather Service Central Illinois Weather Forecast Office 
at Lincoln, broadcasting on a frequency of 162.550 mHz (channel 7 on most 
newer weather radios, and most SAME weather radios). The station activates 
the SAME tone alarm feature and a 1050 Hz tone activating older radios 
(except for AMBER Alerts, using the SAME feature only) for hazardous weather 
and non-weather warnings and emergencies, along with selected weather watches, 
for the Illinois counties of Champaign, Coles, DeWitt, Douglas, Edgar, 
Ford, Moultrie, Piatt, and Vermillion. Weather permitting, a tone alarm 
test of both the SAME and 1050 Hz tone features are conducted every Wednesday 
between 11 AM and Noon.  This article incorporates text from a publication
