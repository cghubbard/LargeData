As coach José Alexander "Alex" Cora (born October 18, 1975) is a Puerto 
Rican professional baseball coach and former infielder who currently is 
the bench coach for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He was a baseball analyst for ESPN and played college baseball at the University 
of Miami. Cora was drafted in the 12th round of the 1993 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Minnesota Twins, but did not sign a contract and decided instead 
to play collegiate baseball at the University of Miami. While there, Cora 
was named to the College World Series all-tournament team in both 1995 
and 1996. He led the team to the title game in 1996, a game they lost to 
Louisiana State University. Having been rated by Baseball America as the 
best collegiate defensive player going into the 1996 draft, Cora was once 
again drafted, this time by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round. 
Cora made his major league debut on June 7, 1998 for the Dodgers, and spent 
the next seven years in Los Angeles, batting .246 with 27 home runs and 
173 RBIs. During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second and shortstop. 
During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers 
moved the aging Mark Grudzielanek to second base. With the emergence of 
César Izturis in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the Chicago Cubs 
in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the 
Dodgers as their primary second baseman. On May 12, 2004, Cora had an 18-pitch 
at-bat against Chicago Cubs starting pitcher Matt Clement. Facing a 2–1 
count, Cora fouled off 14 straight pitches before finally hitting a home 
run. It is the third longest documented at-bat since baseball statisticians 
began keeping track of pitch counts in the mid-1980s. So much time elapsed 
that Cora's brother Joey joked that he and Jay Fritz were watching the 
game at a restaurant ordering their first beer during the first pitch, 
and, by the time Cora homered, Cora and Fritz were "so drunk that we had 
to call a cab to take us home."[1] During the 2004 offseason, Cora signed 
as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians, where he appeared in 49 games, 
with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base. He batted .205 with 
a home run and 8 RBIs. On July 7, 2005, Cora was traded to the Boston Red 
Sox for infielder Ramón Vázquez. In Boston, Cora was originally intended 
to provide a suitable backup for shortstop Édgar Rentería. With the trade 
of Rentería to the Atlanta Braves before the start of the 2006 season, 
Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop until the 
Red Sox acquired Álex González. Also, Cora batted .238 with one home run 
and 18 RBIs. Cora has played in the two longest nine-inning games in MLB 
history. The first was a 4-hour, 27-minute game on October 5, 2001 between 
the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants. The second game, and the longest 
on record, was a 4-hour, 45-minute game on August 18, 2006, in the second 
game of a double header between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees. During 
his years with Boston he was used mostly as a pinch- runner. However, he 
did well in his hitting as used in the game as the Red Sox shortstop. On 
January 22, 2009, Cora signed a one-year deal with the New York Mets. After 
the 2009 season, Cora re-signed with the Mets for another year, with an 
option for 2011 as well, on November 30, 2009.[2] He was released on August 
7, 2010.[3] In his time with the Mets, he appeared in 144 games, with a 
.234 batting average. On August 17, 2010, he signed a minor league contract 
with the Texas Rangers, and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate Oklahoma 
City. The Rangers released Cora on September 7. Despite only playing with 
the Rangers for 6 days, the Rangers ownership still rewarded Alex with 
an AL Championship ring. In January 2011, it was reported that the Nationals 
agreed to sign Cora to a minor league contract.[4] He appeared in 91 games 
for the Nationals, batting only .224. Following the 2011 season, Cora played 
winter ball in Puerto Rico, after which he announced his retirement from 
baseball.[5] However, he changed his mind shortly after, and agreed to 
a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals on February 5, 2012.[6] 
After batting .208 with one RBI in 24 plate appearances in spring training, 
Cora was released by the defending World Series champions on March 25, 
2012.[7] During spring training of 2012, Alex Cora signed a minor league 
contract with the Detroit Tigers. He was released from the organization 
before the start of the regular season. Cora retired again after batting 
just .111 in Spring training. Cora is married to Nilda Cora and has 2 children; 
Jeriel and Camila. Cora represented Puerto Rico at both the 2006 and 2009 
World Baseball Classics. Currently, Cora is the General Manager of the 
Puerto Rico national baseball team which will participate in the 2017 World 
Baseball Classic. [8] In February 2013, Cora was hired to work as a color 
analyst for baseball on ESPN and ESPN Deportes.[9] Cora lives in Caguas, 
Puerto Rico during the off-season. He has a daughter Camila, and stepson 
Jeriel. His older brother is Joey Cora, a former MLB utility player and
