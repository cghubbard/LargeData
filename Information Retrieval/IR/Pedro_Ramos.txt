Pedro Ramos Guerra (born April 28, 1935, in Pinar del RÃ­o, Cuba) is a retired 
Major League pitcher with a 15-year career from 1955 to 1967, and again 
from 1969 to 1970. He played for the Washington Senators, Minnesota Twins, 
Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and the expansion Senators, all of 
the American League, and the Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates 
and Cincinnati Reds, all of the National League. He was elected to the 
American League All-Star team in 1959. He also led the league in losses 
four times in 1958 with 18, 1959 with 19, 1960 with 18 and in 1961 with 
20. On April 11, 1961, Ramas became the first Twins pitcher to earn a victory 
after defeating the New York Yankees.[1] A starter most of his career, 
Pete Ramos became an unexpected sensation in September 1964 after being 
traded from the Indians to the Yankees for $75,000 and two players to be 
named later (after the season, the Indians received Ralph Terry and Bud 
Daley). In 13 appearances for the Yankees, all in relief, Ramos saved eight 
games and posted a 1.25 earned-run average as the Yankees barely held off 
the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles down the pennant stretch. In 
21 innings, Ramos struck out 21 batters and, amazingly, walked none. Unfortunately 
for the Yankees, because the trade came after August 31, Ramos was not 
eligible to pitch in the World Series, which New York lost in seven games 
to the Bob Gibson-led St. Louis Cardinals. As a Senator in his second big-league 
season, Ramos surrendered one of the more memorable home runs in the career 
of Yankees slugger Mickey Mantle. On May 30, 1956, at Yankee Stadium. Mantle 
tore into a Ramos pitch and nearly drove it out of Yankee Stadium, hitting 
the facade of the top deck in right field. In their heyday, Ramos and Mantle 
were considered among the fastest runners in the major leagues. Mantle 
and Ramos raced with Ramos stumbling at the start, Mantle winning. Ramos 
was one of only nine players to don the uniform of both the original and 
expansion Washington Senators teams, the others being Don Mincher, Camilo 
Pascual, Johnny Schaive, Roy Sievers, Zoilo Versalles, Hal Woodeshick,
