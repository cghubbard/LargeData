Marcos Scutaro, better known as Marco Scutaro,[1] (/ˈskuːtəroʊ/; born October 
30, 1975) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder. He bats 
and throws right-handed. Scutaro made his MLB debut with the New York Mets 
in 2002. Since then, he has also played for the Oakland Athletics, Toronto 
Blue Jays, Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies and San Francisco Giants. Scutaro 
was named the most valuable player of the 2012 National League Championship 
Series while with the Giants. Scutaro was one of the primary subjects of 
the 2005 documentary "A Player to be Named Later."[2] Scutaro was born 
in San Felipe, Yaracuy, Venezuela.[1] He is of Italian descent.[3] He began 
playing baseball at age six.[4] Scutaro originally signed with the Cleveland 
Indians as an amateur free agent on July 26, 1994. As a teenager, Scutaro 
considered fellow Venezuelan Omar Vizquel his favorite player and would 
often watch Vizquel at spring training.[4][5] Scutaro was traded by the 
Indians to the Milwaukee Brewers on August 30, 2000, as the "player to 
be named later" in a trade that had sent Kane Davis, Paul Rigdon and Richie 
Sexson to the Brewers for Jason Bere, Bob Wickman and Steve Woodard on 
July 28. Scutaro was in the 2005 documentary film "A Player To Be Named 
Later" which followed various players from Indianapolis Indians, the Triple-A 
affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers, for one season. He was waived at the 
start of the 2002 season by the Brewers who needed to make room for Nelson 
Figueroa on its roster.[6] Scutaro was claimed off waivers by the New York 
Mets on April 5, 2002. He batted .336 with 20 doubles, 7 home runs, 25 
runs batted in (RBI) and 39 runs scored in 79 games with the Tides. He 
was also selected to the International League squad for the Triple-A All-Star 
Game that summer.[6] Scutaro's first promotion to the majors came on July 
19 when the Mets recalled him from the Norfolk Tides to replace the injured 
Joe McEwing. Scutaro introduced himself to Mets manager Bobby Valentine 
that afternoon while the latter was eating lunch at the hotel in Cincinnati 
where the team was staying. Valentine reciprocated the greeting without 
knowing who Scutaro was. After completing his meal, Valentine inquired 
about why Scutaro was lingering. "I just got called up", Scutaro responded.[6] 
Scutaro was again selected off waivers, this time by the Oakland Athletics, 
on October 9, 2003.[7] Scutaro landed a starting second baseman position 
after Mark Ellis had a season-ending shoulder injury during 2004 spring 
training. In 2004, Scutaro reached career highs in batting average (.273), 
runs batted in (43), runs (50), hits (124), doubles (32), at bats (455) 
and games played (137). He played multiple positions, including second 
base, shortstop, third base, and left field. Because of his Italian heritage,[8] 
Scutaro was given the option of playing for either Italy or Venezuela in 
the 2006 World Baseball Classic. He chose to play for Venezuela as a utility 
infielder. He again represented Venezuela in the 2009 World Baseball Classic 
and 2013 World Baseball Classic. Venezuela won the bronze medal in 2009, 
but in 2013 earned an early exit after a loss to Puerto Rico 6–3. However, 
Venezuela won against newcomers Spain to earn a direct qualification for 
the 2017 World Baseball Classic. On November 18, 2007, Scutaro was traded 
to the Toronto Blue Jays for minor league pitchers Kristian Bell and Graham 
Godfrey.[9] Scutaro was the Jays' third baseman for at least a month, after 
teammate Scott Rolen injured a finger, and then Scutaro returned to a starter's 
role after teammate David Eckstein injured his right hip flexor on May 
6. Shortly after Eckstein's return, Eckstein and Blue Jays teammate Aaron 
Hill collided trying to catch a fly ball. Hill suffered from concussion-like 
symptoms, and Scutaro filled in at second base. Scutaro was the starting 
shortstop for the Blue Jays in 2009, and had his best season to date, achieving 
career highs in almost every offensive category: 12 home runs, 60 runs 
batted in, 35 doubles, 235 total bases, 162 hits, 100 runs, 14 stolen bases, 
and 90 walks in 574 at-bats. On December 3, 2009, Scutaro agreed to a two-year, 
$11 million deal with the Boston Red Sox. The deal also included a third-year 
mutual option.[10] On April 12, 2010, Scutaro recorded the first hit in 
Target Field history on a single up the middle in the first inning off 
Minnesota Twins starter Carl Pavano. Soon after, Scutaro was caught stealing 
second base, making him the first out recorded at the Twins' new ballpark. 
In his first season with the team, Scutaro set a number of career highs, 
including games (150), at-bats (632), hits (174) and doubles (38) while 
suffering for much of the season with a right shoulder injury which forced 
him out of practice.[11] Prior to the 2012 season, the Red Sox and Scutaro 
agreed to exercise their mutual contract option. Then, on January 21, 2012, 
Scutaro was traded to the Colorado Rockies for pitcher Clayton Mortensen.[12] 
On July 27, 2012, Scutaro was traded, along with cash considerations, to 
the San Francisco Giants for infielder Charlie Culberson.[13] In a game 
against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium on August 8, 2012, Scutaro 
drove in a career high seven runs including a grand slam.[14] He hit .306 
for the regular season, including .362 as a Giant, helping the Giants win 
the National League West title. He was awarded the NLCS MVP after tying 
the NLCS record with 14 hits and also batting .500 (14 for 28) with six 
runs scored and four runs batted in during the seven game series against 
the Cardinals.[15] On October 28, in the tenth inning of Game 4 of the 
2012 World Series, Scutaro drove in Ryan Theriot for the winning run, as 
the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers.[16] After the 2012 season, Scutaro 
and the Giants agreed to a 3-year, $20 million contract which became official 
on December 7, 2012.[17] In 2013, Scutaro was the starting second baseman, 
with Tony Abreu and Nick Noonan as his main backups. In 81 games in the 
first half, Scutaro hit .316/.367/.400 with 2 HR, 22 RBI and 37 R, and 
he was named to the 2013 MLB All-Star Game. Scutaro played his last game 
of 2013 on September 15, and was officially shut down on September 24.[18] 
He underwent surgery on September 27 that inserted a pin in his left pinkie 
correcting his mallet finger, an injury he suffered on June 11 against 
the Pirates when he was hit by Tony Watson.[19] In 127 games in 2013, he 
hit .297/.357/.369 with 2 HR, 31 RBI and 57 R. Scutaro started the 2014 
season on the disabled list with back problems. He played in five games 
in July before his back issues forced him to return to the disabled list 
for the remainder of the season.[20] On December 19, 2014, Scutaro underwent 
back surgery that some reports indicated could end his career.[21][22] 
The Giants designated him for assignment on January 21, 2015, and he was 
removed from the 40-man roster.[23][24] On January 28, 2015, Scutaro was 
released by the Giants.[25] The Giants re-signed Scutaro to a major league 
contract on June 17 and placed him on the 60-day disabled list. He continued 
to rehabilitate his injury with the Giants, not with the intention of playing, 
but "in hopes of maintaining a quality of life and be pain-free with his
