The Yale Bulldogs are the athletic teams of Yale University. The school 
sponsors 35 varsity sports. The school has won two NCAA national championships 
in women's fencing, four in men's swimming and diving, 21 in men's golf 
and one in men's hockey. Major leaguers pitcher Craig Breslow (Oakland 
A's and Boston Red Sox) and catcher Ryan Lavarnway (Boston Red Sox/Los 
Angeles Dodgers), among others, played baseball for the Bulldogs. Breslow 
led the Ivy League with a 2.56 ERA in 2002.[2] Lavarnway led the NCAA in 
batting average (.467) and slugging percentage (.873) in 2007, set the 
Ivy League hitting-streak record (25), and through 2010 held the Ivy League 
record in career home runs (33).[3] In August 2012, Breslow and Lavarnway, 
playing for the Red Sox, became the first Yale grads to be Major League 
teammates since 1949.[4] The football team has competed since 1876. They 
have won nineteen national championships when the school competed in what 
is now known as the FBS.[5] They are perhaps best known for their rivalry 
with Harvard, known as "The Game". Twenty one former players have been 
inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The men's golf team has 
won 21 collegiate team championships (all except 1943 were bestowed by 
the National Intercollegiate Golf Association): 1897, 1898 (spring),[6] 
1902 (spring), 1905–13, 1915, 1924–26, 1931–33, 1936, 1943. They have crowned 
13 individual champions: John Reid, Jr. (1898, spring), Charles Hitchcock, 
Jr. (1902, fall), Robert Abbott (1905), W. E. Clow, Jr. (1906), Ellis Knowles 
(1907), Robert Hunter (1910), George Stanley (1911), Nathaniel Wheeler 
(1913), Francis Blossom (1915), Jess Sweetser (1920), Dexter Cummings (1923, 
1924), Tom Aycock (1929). Both are records. They have won nine Ivy League 
championships since the League championship was started in 1975: 1984–85, 
1988, 1990–91, 1996–97, 2003, 2011.[7] The Yale Men's Ice Hockey team is 
the oldest existing intercollegiate hockey program, having played its first 
game in 1896 against Johns Hopkins (a 2–2 tie).[8] The team competes in 
the ECAC Hockey League (ECACHL); in addition the Ivy League also crowns 
a champion for its members that field varsity ice hockey. The Bulldogs 
(coached by Keith Allain) won the 2013 NCAA National Championship in Pittsburgh 
with a 4–0 shutout of Quinnipiac University. Before the NCAA began its 
tournament in 1959, the annual national champion was declared by the Intercollegiate 
Association Football League (IAFL) — from 1911 to 1926 — and then the Intercollegiate 
Soccer Football Association (ISFA), from 1927 to 1958. From 1911 to 1958, 
Yale won four national championships. As of July 2, 2015, Yale has 28 NCAA 
team national championships.[9] † The NCAA started sponsoring the intercollegiate 
golf championship in 1939, but it retained the titles from the 41 championships 
previously conferred by the National Intercollegiate Golf Association in 
its records. Yale rugby plays college rugby in Division 1 in the Ivy Rugby 
Conference. Yale Rugby was founded in 1875, making it one of the oldest 
rugby teams in North America.[10][11] President George W. Bush played rugby
