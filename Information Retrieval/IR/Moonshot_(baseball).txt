In baseball, a moonshot is referred to as a home run that travels a great 
distance vertically, while only barely clearing the fences. The name "Moonshot" 
comes from Wally Moon whose home runs would be referenced in newspapers 
as "Moon Shots".[1] Most of Moon's home runs came at the L.A. Coliseum 
and gained (perhaps overstated[2]) recognition for hitting home runs to 
the opposite field,[3] where the distance of the fence was merely 251 feet 
from home plate, but towered 42 feet high - for comparison, Fenway Park's 
famous Green Monster is 37 feet tall. Another definition[who?] comes from 
the trajectory of the ball as it travels high and deep into the night sky,
