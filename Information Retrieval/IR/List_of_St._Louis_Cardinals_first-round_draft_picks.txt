The St. Louis Cardinals are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in St. Louis, Missouri. They play in the National League Central division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Cardinals have selected 
74 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning amateur 
baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball 
clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous 
season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving 
the first pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous 
off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 
74 players picked in the first round by St. Louis, 38 have been pitchers, 
the most of any position; 30 of them were right-handed, while 8 were left-handed. 
Eight outfielders, eight third basemen, six shortstops, six first basemen, 
five catchers, and two second basemen were taken as well. The team also 
drafted one player, Leron Lee (1966), who played as an infielder.[3] 16 
of the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, 
and Texas and Arizona follow with seven and six players. The Cardinals 
have not drafted any players from their home state of Missouri.[3] Three 
of the Cardinals draft picks have won World Series rings with the team. 
Braden Looper (1996) and Chris Duncan (1999) were both members of the major 
league roster when the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series.[4] Lance Lynn 
was with the 2011 Champion team. None of the Cardinals' first-round picks 
have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and no picks have won the 
Cy Young Award. Todd Worrell (1982) is the only first-round pick of the 
Cardinals to earn the MLB Rookie of the Year award with the team, winning 
it in 1986.[5] The Cardinals have never held the first overall pick in 
the draft, and have only held a top five pick three times. The highest 
pick the Cardinals have held was the third overall pick, which they used 
on Looper in 1996.[3] The Cardinals have made 18 selections in the supplemental 
round of the draft and 27 compensatory picks since the institution of the 
First-Year Player Draft in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided 
when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][6][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[7] As the Cardinals have signed all of their first-round picks, they
