prospect by both MLB.com and Baseball America. Hanson made his MLB debut 
on May 17, 2016. On July 14, 2009, the Pittsburgh Pirates signed Hanson 
as an international free agent for a $90,000.[1] In 2010, Hanson played 
his first year of rookie-level Minor League Baseball as a member of the 
Gulf Coast League Pirates.[2] In the 68 games he played in 2010, Hanson 
hit .324 with 28 runs batted in, 7 triples, and 20 stolen bases.[2] In 
2011, Hanson again played for the GCL Pirates. In 52 games, Hanson hit 
.263 with 35 RBIs, 7 triples, and 24 stolen bases.[2] Hanson's 7 triples 
led the Gulf Coast League in 2011.[3] In July 2012, Hanson was named the 
40th-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America in their Midseason Top 
50 Prospects List.[4] Hanson spent the 2012 season with the Pirates' Class 
A affiliate, the West Virginia Power of the South Atlantic League. Hanson 
had a strong season for the Power. He played 124 games and hit .309 with 
16 home runs, 62 runs batted in, 13 triples, 39 stolen bases, 55 walks, 
and 99 runs scored.[2] He was named an All-Star.[5] Prior to the 2013 season, 
Hanson was ranked as the 54th-best prospect in baseball by MLB.com,[6] 
and the 61st-best prospect by Baseball America.[7] Hanson began the 2013

In August 2014, the Pirates announced that they would be moving Hanson, 
primarily a shortstop, to second base.[10] At the time of the announcement, 
Hanson had committed 61 errors in 227 games in 2013 and 2014.[10] Larry 
Broadway, the Pirates' Director of Minor League Operations, indicated that 
the move was to increase Hanson's versatility, saying, "we still believe 
he can play shortstop and believe he will play shortstop for us at some 
point in the future. Adding this dimension to his game will give him additional 
opportunity to impact our organization at the Major League level when he 
is ready."[10] Hanson spent the entire 2015 season with the Pirates' Triple-A 
affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians. Hanson played 117 games for the Indians 
and hit .263 with 6 home runs, 43 runs batted in, and 12 triples.[2] Hanson 
also stole 35 bases, tying his personal best from 2012.[2] Entering the

organization,[11] and the 6th-best prospect amongst second basemen.[12] 
Hanson began the 2016 season with the Indianapolis Indians.[13] On May

Marte went on paternity leave.[13][14][15] Pirates manager Clint Hurdle 
said that Hanson would return to the minors when Marte returned.[13] Hurdle 
noted that Hanson would likely be recalled again later in the season, but 
still had yet to prove himself in Triple-A.[13] Hanson said that, when 
he called his mother to tell her the news, she accidentally hung up and 
celebrated, while Hanson waited in silence for nearly 10 minutes.[13] On 
May 17, Hanson made his big league debut, striking out in a pinch-hit appearance.[16] 
On May 18, Hanson recorded his first MLB hit. Entering the game in the
