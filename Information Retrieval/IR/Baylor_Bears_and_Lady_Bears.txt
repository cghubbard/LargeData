The Baylor Bears (variously Baylor or BU) are the sports teams of Baylor 
University. Baylor's men's sports teams are named the Bears, and some women's 
teams are named the Lady Bears. These teams participate in Division I of 
the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as one of the only 
two private schools to serve as members of the Big 12 Conference. Prior 
to joining the Big 12, Baylor was a member of the Southwest Conference 
from their charter creation in 1914 until its dissolution in 1996. Baylor 
is also a founding member of the Big 12 Conference. The mascots of Baylor 
University are two live black bears named Judge Joy and Judge Lady.[2] 
American black bears roamed the majority of Texas in considerable abundance 
during Baylor's founding in 1845, and bears could still be found throughout 
many areas of the state until the 1940s. Baylor's official school colors 
are green and gold. These colors were picked in 1897 after a group of students, 
returning to campus on a train after an out of town tournament, looked 
out the window at the wild Texas spring flowers and remarked that the vivid 
yellow and green colors made a "lovely combination." When the students 
returned to Waco, the color combination of "green and gold" was recommended 
and readily adopted by the student body. During the 2011–2012 season, Baylor 
set an NCAA record for most combined wins in the four major collegiate 
sports: baseball, men's and women's basketball, and American football. 
Baylor competes in the following 17 varsity sports: The Baylor American 
football team opened the new $250 million McLane Stadium, located on the 
current campus on the banks of the Brazos River, for the 2014 season. The 
opening of McLane Stadium, with a capacity of 45,000, returned Baylor football 
games to the campus for the first time since 1935. The Bears played their 
previous 64 seasons at Floyd Casey Stadium (known as Baylor Stadium until 
1988), a 50,000-seat venue located a few miles away from campus. The Bears 
compete in the Big 12 Conference are currently playing their 116th year 
of college football competition during the 2014 season. Over the program's 
history, the Bears have been to 20 bowl games and won or tied for 5 major 
conference titles. The football program experienced a period of success 
lasting from the 1970s to the mid-1990s during the tenure of head coach 
Grant Teaff. Since becoming a founding member of the Big 12 in 1996, Baylor 
had its best season coming in 2013 when they finished with an 8–1 conference 
record and 11–1 overall. In 2004, Baylor defeated its first ranked opponent 
since 1998, #16 ranked Texas A&M, by a score of 35–34 in overtime on a 
two-point conversion.[3] In 2005 the team opened 3–0 for the first time 
since 1996 and finished 5–6; Baylor also won its first Big 12 road game 
at Iowa State. Also despite a disappointing 4–8 record in 2006, the Bears 
swept the Big 12 North portion of its conference schedule and won 3 conference 
games in a season for the first time since joining the Big 12 in 1996. 
On November 18, 2007, Baylor fired football coach Guy Morriss and announced 
on November 28, 2007 that former University of Houston head coach Art Briles 
as the new coach. During the 2010 season, Briles led Baylor to finish with 
a 7–5 regular season record.[4] The 2010 season was a breakthrough for 
the Baylor Bears even though they suffered an early season loss to rival 
TCU. Baylor earned an invitation to the Texas Bowl in Houston after finishing 
the regular season with a 7–5 record. The Bears subsequently lost the Texas 
Bowl to Illinois, however. In the regular season the Bears victories included 
Big 12 conference wins over Kansas and Kansas St, as well as road wins 
over Colorado and Texas. Building on their 2010 winning season, the 2011 
Baylor Bears went on to a 9–3 (6–3 Big XII) regular season, finishing with 
five straight wins including wins against #5 Oklahoma, #25 Texas Tech, 
and #22 Texas. These wins helped place Robert Griffin III at the top of 
the Heisman Trophy voting; he became the first Baylor player to win the 
award and the first Baylor player since Don Trull in 1963 to factor significantly 
in the voting. The Bears celebrated their successful season with a 2nd 
consecutive bowl appearance by being selected for the Valero Alamo Bowl 
in San Antonio. The Bears went on to beat the Washington Huskies 67–56, 
finishing the 2011 season with a 10–3 record and ranked #19 by the BCS 
& Coaches Poll. During the 2012 season, Baylor shocked the college football 
world by soundly beating #1 Kansas State 52–24 in Waco. (Kansas State had 
dropped its two previous meetings in Waco 47–42 in 2010 and 17–3 in 2006.) 
A 12-yard Florence touchdown rush in the first quarter gave Baylor a 14–7 
lead which was never relinquished. The Baylor defense highlighted the game 
with a stout goal-line stand in the 4th quarter and intercepted Heisman 
hopeful Collin Klein three times, the last in the endzone to set up an 
80-yard touchdown run by Lache Seastrunk. The victory over Kansas State 
represented the program's first and only win to date over a #1 ranked team 
and sparked a 3-game win streak for Baylor (with a 52–45 overtime victory 
over Texas Tech in Cowboys Stadium and a 41–34 victory in Waco over #23 
Oklahoma State). The conclusion of Baylor's 8–5 2012 campaign marked the 
first time since 1949–51 that the Bears have enjoyed three consecutive 
seasons with 7+ wins. On December 2, Baylor accepted a berth in the Holiday 
Bowl, sending the Bears to a third consecutive bowl for the first time 
in program history. Baylor easily defeated the #17-ranked UCLA Bruins in 
the Holiday Bowl on December 27, 2012 by a final margin of 49–19 after 
jumping out to a 21–0 lead early in the 2nd quarter. Lache Seastrunk (RB) 
and Chris McAllister (DE) were named Offensive Player and Defensive Player 
of the game respectively. Coach Art Briles has led the Bears to a record 
of 11–1 in November and December the past 2 seasons which includes 2 bowl 
wins. Baylor's baseball team is led by Steve Smith, who has coached the 
team since the 1995 season. During his tenure, the program has achieved 
success rarely seen before his arrival. In the 14 seasons from 1998 to 
2012, Coach Smith led the team to 12 NCAA Regional appearances (1998, 1999, 
2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012), 4 NCAA Super 
Regional appearances (1999, 2003, 2005, 2012), 3 regular season conference 
titles (2000, 2005, 2012) and a College World Series appearance (2005). 
The Bears hosted an NCAA Regional in 1999, 2000, 2005, and 2012 in addition 
to hosting a NCAA Super Regional in 1999, 2005, and 2012. Since the inception 
of the Big 12 Conference, Baylor is one of only two teams (Baylor & Oklahoma) 
to have qualified for the Big 12 Tournament every year. The Baylor Lady 
Bears won the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship in 2005. 
Coached by Kim Mulkey, the Lady Bears defeated the Spartans of Michigan 
State University 84–62. Mulkey became the first women's coach and only 
the third coach in history to win an NCAA Division I basketball championship 
as both a player and a coach, joining Dean Smith and Bob Knight. In 8 of 
her 9 years as head coach, Mulkey has guided the Lady Bears to the NCAA 
Tournament. In 2010, Mulkey returned the Lady Bears to the Final Four, 
where they lost in the national semifinals to eventual champion UConn. 
In 2011, the Lady Bears won the Big 12 regular season and tournament titles 
along with making it all the way to the Elite Eight before being knocked 
out of the tournament by rival and eventual national champion Texas A&M. 
In 2012, they finished a perfect 40–0, became the first men's or women's 
college basketball team to finish 40–0, and won their second national NCAA 
Women's Division I Basketball Championship. In 2013, the Lady Bears won 
both the Big 12 regular season and tournament titles and made it to the 
Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament before falling to Louisville in one 
of the biggest upsets in the history of the women's tournament. The men's 
basketball program was plagued by a scandal in 2003. Patrick Dennehy, a 
player for the team, was murdered by Carlton Dotson, a former Baylor player 
who had been kicked off the team. Then-coach Dave Bliss was forced to resign 
amidst allegations that he had made financial payments to four players 
while also making public statements that had characterized Dennehy as a 
drug dealer. The school placed itself on probation, limited itself to 7 
scholarships for two years, and imposed a post-season ban for the 2004–05 
academic year. Additionally, the NCAA further punished the team by initiating 
a non-conference ban for the 2005–2006 season and extending the probationary 
period during which the school would have limited recruiting privileges. 
The 2005 Bears were hindered by only having 7 scholarship players and recorded 
only one win in conference play. In spite of these challenges, head coach 
Scott Drew was able to put together a 2005 signing class ranked No. 7 nationally 
by HoopScoop. The 2006 Bears included Aaron Bruce, the highest scoring 
freshman in the NCAA in 2005, and Mamadou Diene, rated one of the top 10 
centers for the 2007 NBA draft. The program's recovery culminated in 3 
straight postseason appearances: an at-large NCAA Men's Tournament berth 
in March 2008, an NIT championship game appearance in March, 2009, and 
a trip to the NCAA tournament's Elite Eight in March, 2010. Baylor would 
make another trip to the Elite Eight in 2012 before losing to eventual 
national champion Kentucky. The Bears would follow up their elite eight 
run by winning the 2013 NIT title after beating Iowa in the final game 
at Madison Square Garden. Baylor men's teams won five conference championships 
in the former Southwest Conference (1932, 1946, 1948, 1949, 1950). The 
Bears reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 1946 and the Final 
Four in 1948 and 1950. The 1948 team advanced to play the Kentucky Wildcats 
for the NCAA championship, but fell 58–42 to Adolph Rupp's first national 
championship team. Both the men and women call the Ferrell Center home, 
which was built in 1988. Previously they played in the Heart of Texas Coliseum. 
An non-exhaustive list of BU players who played in the NBA include Vinnie 
Johnson, David Wesley, Michael Williams, Terry Teagle, and Brian Skinner. 
Ekpe Udoh was selected with the #6 pick in the 2010 NBA Draft by the Golden 
State Warriors. In 2004, the Bears men's tennis team won the NCAA Division 
I Men's Tennis Championship, Baylor University's first NCAA national team 
title. The team made it back to the Championship game in 2005 but lost 
the national title match to UCLA. The team has won 11 conference regular 
season titles in the past 13 years, including 9 straight conference regular 
season championships dating from 2000 to 2009. The team has won the conference 
tournament title 8 times in the past 9 years. The Baylor tennis team has 
the most conference titles and best winning percentage of any Big 12 tennis 
team. Baylor's most notable sports program is undoubtedly its track and 
field team, producing nine Olympic gold medals, 36 NCAA championships, 
and 606 All-Americas performances. A majority of the All-Americans coming 
under the 42-year tenure of head coach Clyde Hart. The greatest standout 
of the track program has been its men's 4 × 400 relay team, which has sent 
teams to the NCAA finals in each of the past 28 years. Baylor track and 
field has also produced three Olympic gold medalists: Michael Johnson, 
Jeremy Wariner and Darold Williamson. Baylor grads won gold in the 400 
meter dash at three consecutive Olympics (Johnson in '96 and '00, then 
Wariner in '04). In 2005, Clyde Hart became Director of Track & Field, 
and Todd Harbour took over as head coach of Baylor's track and field and 
cross country squads. Baylor University Rugby Football Club plays in Division 
1-A in the Allied Rugby Conference, a conference composed mostly of schools 
from the Big 12 South, against its traditional rivals such as Texas, Texas 
Tech, and Texas A&M. Baylor is led by head coach Nick Lane.[5] Baylor has 
had success in various competitions, including winning the 2009 Cowtown 
Rugby Tournament in Fort Worth, Texas.[6] The Year of the Bear (in Baylor 
parlance, Añodeloso, a takeoff of the popular Diadeloso festival) is the 
name given to the 2011–2012 year in Baylor Athletics. The year started 
out on a potentially ominous note due to the turmoil surrounding the Big 
12 Conference after it lost its third member in two years (by the end of 
the year, it would lose a fourth member) and the real potential for the 
conference to disband. Baylor was not being considered by any major conference 
as a potential member due to its poor overall football performance as a 
Big 12 member (the 2010 season was the first year that the program finished 
at .500 in conference play, and only the second time that it had not finished 
last or tied for last in its division). But the Year of the Bear would 
start with an upset when the Baylor Bears football team defeated former 
Southwest Conference rival (and later Big 12 rival) TCU (which was coming 
off an undefeated season and No. 2 ranking the prior year) 50–48. The win 
would catapult junior quarterback Robert Griffin III into the Heisman spotlight. 
The Bears finished the season at 10–3 (at that time, tied for the most 
wins in school history) and a No. 12 final ranking, with six straight wins 
to close the season, including another upset along the way – this time 
at the hands of then No. 5 Oklahoma, a program it had never defeated in 
20 previous tries – and a win in the 2011 Valero Alamo Bowl led by Griffin, 
who won the 2011 Heisman Trophy and National Player of the Year honors. 
While the football team finished strong, the men's and women's basketball 
teams started strong. The men's team would start with 17 straight wins 
en route to a 30–8 season (the best in school history), a berth in the 
NCAA Elite Eight (its second in three seasons) and a No. 10 final ranking. 
The women's team would win the program's second national title, becoming 
the first basketball program – men's or women's – to finish 40–0. Center 
Brittney Griner would win National Player of the Year while coach Kim Mulkey 
would win National Coach of the Year. The baseball team would win 49 games 
(one shy of its all-time best), including a school-record 24-game winning 
streak. At one point it reached the No. 1 ranking for two weeks (a program 
first), but it finished in the NCAA Super Regionals and a No. 9 ranking. 
Baylor's four major programs (American football, men's and women's basketball, 
and baseball) would finish with an NCAA record 129 wins during the year 
(and an overall record of 129–28 for a winning percentage of .822) and 
Baylor would be the only school to have all four programs ranked at the 
end of their respective seasons (football No. 12, men's basketball No. 
10, women's basketball No. 1 and baseball No. 9). The football and men's 
& women's basketball programs also set NCAA records with a combined 80 
wins between them, including a stretch from Nov. 1, 2011 to Jan. 16, 2012, 
when the three programs had 40 consecutive wins between them.[7] The Year 
of the Bear earned Baylor attention across the nation. Sports reporter 
Jim Rome (who had derided the program earlier, referring to it as "scrubby 
little Baylor" among other things) said, "Well, not only do they belong 
in the Big 12, they're running the Big 12."[8] Baylor has won 3 NCAA team 
national championships.[9] Below is one national team title that was not 
bestowed by the NCAA: Baylor won its first team NCAA title in 2004 as the 
men's tennis team defeated UCLA in the championship game. They narrowly 
lost to UCLA in the 2005 national championship match the following year. 
The Lady Bears won the school's two championships in women's basketball, 
in 2005 and 2012. During the 2011–2012 season, Baylor set an NCAA record 
for most combined wins in the four major collegiate sports: baseball, men's 
and women's basketball, and American football.[10] Baylor has won 39 NCAA 
individual championships. Appropriately branded "Quartermile U", Baylor 
has won 20 national titles in the 4 × 400 meter relay Baylor has won 100 
conference titles, 67 of which are from the Big 12, and the other 33 from 
the Southwest Conference: In recent years, Baylor renewed its historic 
rivalry with Texas Christian University. TCU and Baylor had the nation's 
longest "continuous game" rivalry until the series was temporarily stopped 
in 1995 upon the SWC's demise, as the schools went to different conferences. 
The series is still is one of the most prolific rivalries in college football, 
with the first match being played in 1899 and the two teams having played 
over a century's worth of games.[22] The TCU–Baylor rivalry originated 
in 1899 when both schools were located in Waco. The two schools are only 
separated by an hour-and-twenty-minute drive on I-35 and both are private 
universities. Baylor and the University of Texas are natural rivals, located 
only a hundred miles apart in central Texas. Both schools were founding 
members of the Southwest Conference and have played over 100 games against 
each other. Texas leads the series 74–26. Baylor's fortunes changed in 
2010 as Heisman-trophy winning quarterback Robert Griffin III led the Bears 
to their first win over Texas since 1997. The Baylor–Texas A&M rivalry 
was known as the Battle of the Brazos, as the Brazos River runs near both 
campuses (which are approximately 90 miles apart). The series began in 
1899 and was played until 2011, with only a few brief breaks in the 1920s 
and during World War II. With Texas A&M accepting an invitation to join 
the Southeast Conference in 2012, the rivalry has been discontinued with 
no current indication if the rivalry might resume in the future. Baylor 
University was one of the first universities in the United States to stage 
a homecoming celebration. The Baylor homecoming event was launched in November 
1909 as a way to reconnect Baylor alumni with current students. Thousands 
of Alumni traveled from all over Texas and throughout the South to take 
part in the festivities. The first homecoming weekend event included a 
football game, bonfire, concerts, speeches, a reception, a class reunion, 
and a pep rally. The Homecoming event is continued every year and the annual 
tradition is now over 100 years old. The Baylor Line is one of the first 
aspects of Baylor spirit to which freshmen are introduced. The Baylor Line 
is made entirely of freshmen and is the core of Baylor spirit and tradition. 
Students wear a gold football jersey with the number of their graduation 
year and a nickname on the back. Before each American football game the 
Baylor Line gathers at one end of Floyd Casey Stadium and waits for the 
signal to make a 'mad dash' down the field to create a giant human tunnel 
through which the football team runs through to enter the stadium. After 
that, students rush the sidelines and stand in an exclusive Baylor Line 
section behind the opponents' bench where students watch the game, cheer 
the Bears to another victory, and sometimes heckle the opposing team. The 
Baylor Line was organized almost 50 years ago and was an all-male organization 
until 1993, when women were allowed to join. At its inception, the Baylor 
Line was a group of freshmen men who lined the front of Baylor's student 
section for the express purpose of protecting Baylor women from the other 
teams' fans. The jersey colors of the Line were originally rotated between 
Baylor green (in odd numbered years) and Baylor gold (in even numbered 
years), but in the interest of having a more substantial looking student 
section the decision was made to use gold every year starting around 1999. 
Baylor's official school colors are green and gold. The colors were picked 
in 1897 after a group of students, returning to campus on a train after 
an out of town tournament, looked out the window at the wild Texas spring 
flowers and remarked that the vivid yellow and green colors made a "lovely 
combination." When the students returned to Waco, the color combination 
of "green and gold" was recommended and heartily adopted by the student 
body. Baylor keeps two adult American black bears, Joy and Lady, on campus 
in their natural habitat enclosure as mascots for the university. The first 
live bear was a gift from the troops of the 107th Engineers, which was 
a unit of the 32nd Infantry Division stationed at Camp MacArthur in Waco. 
The soldiers were based in the city during World War I and are said to 
have given the live bear to a former Baylor President after a poker game. 
The bears are brought to the stadium by the Baylor Chamber spirit group 
on game days and they attend pre-game events and stay to be the living 
symbol of the university at the games. However, since 2010 the bears are 
no longer allowed at American football games on leashes. The USDA informed 
Baylor officials that they would no longer be permitted to bring the bears 
to games per Federal Code of Regulations 2.131(c)(1)which states "During 
public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk 
of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or 
barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure 
the safety of the animals and the public." In the fall of 2005, the university 
finished renovation and construction of the Bill and Eva Williams Bear 
Habitat, a $1 million facility which includes a thirteen-foot (four-metre) 
waterfall, three pools, two dens, grass, and eye-level viewing. The facility 
is a United States Department of Agriculture- licensed Class C Zoo. It 
was formally dedicated on Oct. 28, 2005 In January 1927 a bus carrying 
the Baylor basketball team collided with the Sunshine Special train in 
Round Rock, Texas. Ten members of the traveling party were killed and many 
others were injured in the accident. Each year at homecoming the story 
of the Immortal Ten is told again to the new freshman class at the Freshman 
Mass Meeting. The names of the ten are called out. In 1996, the senior 
class provided initial funding to create and place an Immortal Ten statue 
on campus. Fund raising and discussions about where to place the statues 
continued off and on over the ensuing years. Finally, on June 22, 2007, 
the statues, which were sculpted by Bruce R. Greene, were unveiled. The 
Immortal Ten memorial was officially dedicated during Homecoming on Nov. 
2, 2007 in Traditions Square.[23][24][25][26][27] In 1931, Mrs. Enid Markham, 
wife of music professor Robert Markham, wrote lyrics that were presented 
in chapel in November and soon sanctioned as the official school song. 
The "Good Old Summer Time" tune was rearranged to fit Mrs. Markham's "Baylor 
Line" by Baylor Band Director Donald I. Moore. Before kickoff and after 
each game's conclusion Baylor fans sing the university alma mater 'That 
Good Old Baylor Line' while holding their "Bear paws" in the air. ♫ That 
Good Old Baylor Line! ♫ That Good Old Baylor Line! We’ll march forever 
down the years, As long as stars shall shine. We’ll fling our Green and 
Gold afar To light the ways of time, And guide us as we onward go; That 
Good Old Baylor Line! Words Copyright 1952 by Enid Eastland Markham Baylor's 
fight song (Old Fight!) was written in 1940 after a group of students wrote 
to various famous musicians asking for their help in creating a fight song 
for the university. Two Brothers, Fred and Tom Waring, volunteered to help. 
Together the pair wrote "Bear Down Baylor Bears", this song was then performed 
by the Pennsylvanians on the Warings' live national NBC radio broadcast 
("The Chesterfield Pleasure Time Radio Show") on December 20, 1940. Eventually, 
two students Dick Baker '50, and Frank Boggs '48, decided to rewrite the 
song to make it easier for students to sing. The wrote the new song lyrics 
on a weekend in 1947 and the completed song was introduced outside of old 
Brooks Hall near Minglewood Bowl that fall. Bear down you Bears of Old 
Baylor U We're all for you! GO BEARS! We're gonna show dear old Baylor 
spirit through and through! GO BEARS! Come on and fight them with all your 
might you bruins bold And win all our victories for the Green and Gold! 
B! A! Y! L! O! R! BAYLOR! BEARS! FIGHT! Come on and fight them with all 
your might you bruins bold And win all our victories for the Green and 
Gold! B-A-Y-L-O-R BAYLOR BEARS FIGHT! Coordinates: 31°32′41″N 97°07′09″W﻿
