NPB MLB MLB records Baseball achievements Ichiro Suzuki (鈴木 一朗, Suzuki 
Ichirō?, born October 22, 1973), often referred to mononymously as Ichiro 
(イチロー, Ichirō?), is a Japanese professional baseball outfielder for the 
Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has spent the bulk of 
his career with two teams: the Orix Blue Wave of Nippon Professional Baseball 
(NPB) in Japan, where he began his professional career, and the Seattle 
Mariners of MLB in the United States. After playing for the Mariners, he 
played two and a half seasons in MLB with the New York Yankees. Ichiro 
has established a number of batting records, including MLB's single-season 
record for hits with 262. He had 10 consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest 
streak by any player in history. Between his major league career in both 
Japan and the United States, Ichiro has the most hits by any player in 
top tier professional leagues. In his combined playing time in NPB and 
MLB, Ichiro received 17 consecutive selections both as an All-Star and 
Gold Glove winner, won nine league batting titles and been named Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) four times. While playing in NPB, he won seven consecutive 
batting titles and three consecutive Pacific League MVP Awards. In 2001, 
Ichiro became the first Japanese-born position player to be posted and 
signed to an MLB club.[1] He led the American League (AL) in batting average 
and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL MVP. 
Ichiro is the first MLB player to enter the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame 
(The Golden Players Club). He is a ten-time MLB All-Star and won the 2007 
All-Star Game MVP Award for a three-hit performance that included the event's 
first-ever inside-the-park home run. Ichiro won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award 
in each of his first ten years in the majors, and has had an American League 
record seven hitting streaks of 20 or more games, with a high of 27. Ichiro 
also leads all active players in singles with 2,440 and in stolen bases 
with 507. He is also noted for his longevity, continuing to produce at 
a high level with batting, slugging, and on-base percentages above .300 
in 2016 while approaching 43 years of age. On August 7, 2016, Ichiro made 
the 3000th hit of his MLB career, becoming only the 30th player ever to 
do so. In total he has over 4,300 hits in his career. On October 4th, the 
Marlins exercised their 2017 option with Ichiro. The move will guarantee 
Ichiro $2 million dollars in 2017, and includes a further team option for 
2018. Ichiro grew up in the town of Toyoyama, a relatively small town just 
outside Nagoya.[2][3][4] At the age of seven, Ichiro joined his first baseball 
team and asked his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki (鈴木宣之), to teach him to be a 
better player. The two began a daily routine which included throwing 50 
pitches, fielding 50 infield balls and 50 outfield balls, and hitting 500 
pitches, 250 from a pitching machine and 250 from his father.[5] As a little 
leaguer in Toyoyama,[6] Ichiro had the word "concentration" (集中, shūchū?) 
written on his glove. By age 12, he had dedicated himself to pursuing a 
career in professional baseball, and their training sessions were no longer 
for leisure, and less enjoyable.The elder Suzuki claimed, "Baseball was 
fun for both of us", but Ichiro later said, "It might have been fun for 
him, but for me it was a lot like Star of the Giants," a popular Japanese 
manga and anime series about a young baseball prospect's difficult road 
to success, with rigorous training demanded by the father. According to 
Ichiro, "It bordered on hazing and I suffered a lot."[7] When Ichiro joined 
his high school baseball team, his father told the coach, "No matter how 
good Ichiro is, don't ever praise him. We have to make him spiritually 
strong."[8] When he was ready to enter high school, Ichiro was selected 
by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya's Aikodai Meiden 
(ja:愛工大名電) High School. Ichiro was primarily used as a pitcher instead 
of as an outfielder, owing to his exceptionally strong arm. His cumulative 
high school batting average was .505, with 19 home runs. He built strength 
and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy 
shovel, among other regimens. These exercises helped develop his wrists 
and hips, adding power and endurance to his thin frame. Despite his outstanding 
numbers in high school, Ichiro was not drafted until the fourth and final 
round of the professional draft in November 1991, because many teams were 
discouraged by his small size of 5 ft 9 1⁄2 in (177 cm) and 124 pounds 
(56 kg).[9] Years later, Ichiro told an interviewer, "I'm not a big guy 
and hopefully kids could look at me and see that I'm not muscular and not 
physically imposing, that I'm just a regular guy. So if somebody with a 
regular body can get into the record books, kids can look at that. That 
would make me happy."[10] Ichiro made his Pacific League debut in 1992 
at the age of 18, but he spent most of his first two seasons in the farm 
system because his then-manager, Shōzō Doi, refused to accept Ichiro's 
unorthodox swing. The swing was nicknamed 'pendulum' (振り子打法, Furiko Dahō?) 
because of the pendulum-like motion of his leg, which shifts his weight 
forward as he swung the bat, and goes against conventional hitting theory. 
Even though he hit a home run off Hideo Nomo, who later won a National 
league Rookie of the Year Award as a Dodger, Ichiro was sent back to the 
farm system on that very day. In his second career game, he recorded his 
first ichi-gun hit in Japan's Pacific League against Hawks pitcher Keiji 
Kimura.[11] In 1994 he benefited from the arrival of a new manager, Akira 
Ōgi, who played him every day in the second spot of the lineup. He was 
eventually moved to the leadoff spot for the Blue Wave, where his immediate 
productivity dissolved any misgivings about his unconventional swing. He 
set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits, the first player ever 
to top 200 hits in a single season. Five other players have since done 
so: Matt Murton, Norichika Aoki (twice), Alex Ramírez, Tsuyoshi Nishioka 
and Shogo Akiyama, . Ichiro's record was eventually surpassed in 2010 by 
former major leaguer Matt Murton, who had 214 hits in a 144-game season. 
Also, in 2015, current Saitama Seibu Lions Outfielder Shogo Akiyama had 
216 hits in a 143-game season. Ichiro's 210 hits had come in a 130-game 
season. Ichiro's .385 batting average was a Pacific League record and won 
the young outfielder the first of a record seven consecutive batting titles. 
Ichiro also hit 13 home runs and had 29 stolen bases, helping him to earn 
his first of three straight Pacific League MVP (Most Valuable Player) awards. 
It was during the 1994 season that he began to use his given name, "Ichiro", 
instead of his family name, "Suzuki", on the back of his uniform. Suzuki 
is the second most common family name in Japan, and his manager introduced 
the idea as a publicity stunt to help create a new image for what had been 
a relatively weak team, as well as a way to distinguish their rising star. 
Initially, Ichiro disliked the practice and was embarrassed by it; however, 
"Ichiro" was a household name by the end of the season and he was flooded 
with endorsement offers. In 1995 Ichiro led the Blue Wave to its first 
Pacific League pennant in 12 years. In addition to his second batting title, 
he led the league with 80 RBI, 25 home runs, and 49 stolen bases. By this 
time the Japanese press had begun calling him the "Hit Manufacturing Machine" 
(安打製造機, Anda Seizōki?). The following year with Ichiro winning his third 
straight MVP award the team defeated the Central League champion, Yomiuri 
Giants, in the Japan Series. Following the 1996 season playing in an exhibition 
series against a visiting team of Major League All-Stars kindled Ichiro's 
desire to travel to the United States to play in the Major Leagues. In 
November 1998 Ichiro participated in a seven-game exhibition series between 
Japanese and American all-stars. Ichiro batted .380 and collected seven 
stolen bases in the series, winning praise from several of his MLB counterparts 
including Sammy Sosa and Jamie Moyer (who would become his teammate with 
the Mariners). In 2000 Ichiro was still a year away from being eligible 
for free agency, but the Blue Wave was no longer among Japan's best teams. 
Because the team would probably not be able to afford to keep him, and 
would lose him without compensation in another year, Orix allowed him to 
negotiate with Major League clubs. Ichiro used the posting system, and 
the Seattle Mariners won the right to negotiate with him with a bid of 
approximately $13 million.[12] In November, Ichiro signed a three-year, 
$14 million contract with the Seattle Mariners. In his nine seasons in 
Japan, Ichiro had 1,278 hits, a .353 career batting average, and won seven 
Golden Glove Awards. Ichiro's time in the Japanese baseball leagues matured 
him as a player and a person, and he often credits it for his current success. 
Due to an agreement between Japanese baseball and MLB, Ichiro was not allowed 
to play in the United States before 2001.[13] His move to the US was viewed 
with some interest because he was among the first Japanese position players 
to play for an MLB team. In the same way that many Japanese teams had considered 
the 18-year-old Ichiro too small to draft in 1992, many Americans believed 
he would prove too frail to succeed against Major League pitching or endure 
the longer 162-game season. Ichiro made an auspicious debut with Seattle, 
and in the Mariners' eighth game revealed his tremendous throwing arm by 
gunning down Oakland's Terrence Long, who had tried to advance from first 
to third on a teammate's single to right field. That play would be dubbed 
"The Throw" by Japanese media covering Ichiro's progress.[14] After expressing 
no preference as to a uniform number, Ichiro was issued #51 by the Mariners. 
He was initially hesitant because it had previously been worn by pitching 
star Randy Johnson. To avoid insulting Johnson, Ichiro sent a personal 
message to the pitcher promising not to "bring shame" to the uniform. His 
trepidation was unfounded, as he had a remarkable 2001 season, accumulating 
a rookie-record 242 hits, the most by any MLB player since 1930. His perennial 
Gold Glove fielding led Safeco's right field to be dubbed "Area 51". With 
a .350 batting average and 56 stolen bases, Ichiro was the first player 
to lead his league in both categories since Jackie Robinson in 1949. The 
season included hitting streaks of 25 and 23 games, an appearance on the 
cover of Sports Illustrated, and intense media attention on both sides 
of the Pacific. Fans from Japan were taking $2,000 baseball tours, sometimes 
flying in and out of the U.S. just to watch Ichiro's games. More than 150 
Japanese reporters and photographers were given media access. Safeco Field's 
sushi stands began selling "Ichirolls".[15] Aided by Major League Baseball's 
decision to allow All-Star voting in Japan, Ichiro was the first rookie 
to lead all players in voting for the All-Star Game. That winter, he won 
the American League Most Valuable Player and the Rookie of the Year awards, 
becoming only the second player in MLB history (after Fred Lynn) to receive 
both honors in the same season. Ichiro is also the only player in major 
league history to have won an MVP, Rookie of the Year, Gold Glove Award, 
Silver Slugger Award, all while starting in the All-Star Game in the same 
season.[citation needed] 2001 had been an exceptionally successful regular 
season for the Seattle Mariners as a team, as they matched the 1906 Chicago 
Cubs' Major League record of 116 wins.[16] In his only postseason appearance 
with the Mariners, Ichiro continued his hot hitting into the playoffs, 
batting .600 in the ALDS against the Cleveland Indians. However, Seattle's 
stellar season ended against the New York Yankees in the ALCS, as Ichiro 
was held to a .222 average. Yankees manager Joe Torre had emphasized to 
his pitchers, "Do not let Ichiro beat you. He is the key to Seattle's offense." 
Informed of this assessment, Ichiro said, "If that is true, it would give 
me great joy. I don't believe he is right."[10] Ichiro finished his second 
year in American baseball with 208 total hits, making him the first Mariners 
player ever with two consecutive seasons of 200+ hits. He got off to a 
hot start in 2002, but a late-season slump drove his batting average down 
to .321, 29 points below his batting average as a rookie. He was the sixth 
player in MLB history to start a career with two 200-hit seasons. Ichiro 
finished the season second in the AL in hits, fourth in batting average, 
and fourth in steals. Ichiro led the major league All-Star balloting for 
the second straight year. Although the Mariners had a 93–69 record, that 
was good for only a third-place finish in the AL West. In 2003, Ichiro 
became just the third player in history to begin his career with three 
200-hit seasons, by garnering 212. He again finished in the top ten for 
hits, batting average, steals and runs, and, again, a late season slump 
brought his average down almost 40 points (to .312). Ichiro was elected 
to his third All Star game in the three years he had been in the league, 
and he was again the vote leader in both leagues. However, the second-place 
Mariners again fell short of the playoffs. Ichiro had his best offensive 
season to date in 2004, highlighted by his breaking of George Sisler's 
84-year-old record for most hits (257) in a season. An increase in games 
played benefited Ichiro, as he accumulated only 251 hits through the first 
154 games of the season. Ichiro recorded 50 hits in four different months 
of the year (September and October are combined by MLB for this computational 
purpose), becoming the first player ever to have four in a season. With 
51 hits in August 2001, Ichiro joined Pete Rose as the only players with 
five 50-hit months in a career.[citation needed] On May 21, Ichiro recorded 
his 2,000th professional hit. His 200th hit of 2004 came in just his 126th 
game. By the end of September, with one three-game series remaining, Ichiro's 
hit total stood at 256—one shy of Sisler. Ichiro singled off the Rangers' 
Ryan Drese on October 1 to tie Sisler's record. In the third inning, on 
a 3–2 count, Ichiro singled up the middle for his 258th hit of the year, 
which Ichiro later called "the greatest moment of my baseball career".[17][18] 
He was greeted by a swarm of teammates, and a standing ovation from the 
fans. Sisler's daughter, Francis Sisler Drochelman attended the game, and 
was greeted by Ichiro after his hit.[19] Ichiro finished the 2004 season 
with a record 262 hits, giving him the single-season records for both the 
United States and Japanese baseball.[citation needed] In July 2009, while 
in St. Louis for his ninth All-Star appearance, Ichiro made a trip to Sisler's 
grave. He later told reporters, "There's not many chances to come to St. 
Louis. In 2004, it was the first time I crossed paths with him, and his 
family generously came all the way to Seattle. Above all, it was a chance. 
I wanted to do that for a grand upperclassman of the baseball world. I 
think it's only natural for someone to want to do that, to express my feelings 
in that way. I’m not sure if he's happy about it."[20] From 2001 to 2004, 
Ichiro had more hits (924) than anyone in history over any four-year period, 
breaking the record of 918 that Bill Terry accumulated from 1929 to 1932, 
however, Terry played in 34 fewer games than Ichiro during their respective 
four-year spans.[21] He would later surpass his own mark by recording 930 
hits from 2004 to 2007. During one 56-game stretch in 2004, Ichiro batted 
over .450. By comparison, Joe DiMaggio batted .408 during his record-setting 
56-game hitting streak. Ichiro batted over .400 against left-handed pitching 
in 2004. During the off-season, then-manager Bob Melvin's contract was 
not extended and the Mariners brought in Mike Hargrove as the new manager 
with a contract through 2007. Ironically, it was Hargrove who predicted 
that Ichiro would be no better than "a fourth outfielder on [an American] 
major league team" back when Ichiro was still in Japan.[22] Speculation 
started that Hargrove and Ichiro did not get along very well in the season.[23] 
In 2005, Ichiro had his second worst year in his MLB career to date, collecting 
only 206 hits (the lowest total of his career to that point). However, 
he reached the plateau of a .300 batting average, 100+ runs, 30+ steals 
and 200+ hits for the fifth straight season. That allowed Ichiro to become 
the first player to collect 200 hits per season in each of his first five 
years in the Major Leagues. Only Willie Keeler, Wade Boggs, Chuck Klein, 
Al Simmons, and Charlie Gehringer had had five consecutive 200-hit seasons 
at any point in their careers. During the season he accumulated 1,000 career 
hits, reaching the career milestone faster than any other player in MLB 
history.[24] Ichiro hit a career-high 15 home runs. In the off-season, 
Ichiro played himself in Furuhata Ninzaburō, a Japanese Columbo-like TV 
drama that he loves. In the drama, he kills a person and is arrested. Ichiro 
played for the Japan national baseball team in the inaugural World Baseball 
Classic in March 2006. During the March 15 Japan-Korea game Ichiro was 
booed by a few spectators during every at-bat, reportedly in response to 
a previous statement that he wanted "to beat South Korea so badly, that 
the South Koreans won't want to play Japan for another 30 years."[25] That, 
however, was an incorrect translation mostly spread to the public through 
ESPN. Ichiro was variously quoted as saying "I want to win in a way that 
the opponent would think, 'we cannot catch up with Japan for the coming 
30 years'. We should not merely win the games."[26] Japan would later beat 
Korea in the playoffs and win the tournament after defeating Cuba in the 
finals, 10–6.[27] For the tournament, Ichiro had twelve hits including 
a home run, seven runs, and four stolen bases. Ichiro's 2006 season got 
off to an unexpected start, with the outfielder hitting as low as .177 
in the season's third week. He quickly rebounded, finishing the season 
with a .322 average (sixth in the AL and 11th in the majors). Ichiro's 
224 hits led the majors, and he recorded 110 runs and 45 stolen bases. 
Ichiro was caught stealing only twice in 2006, for a 96% success rate. 
His 1,354 career U.S. hits topped Wade Boggs' record for the most hits 
in any six-year period.[28] In his sixth year in the majors, Ichiro collected 
his sixth Gold Glove Award, and a sixth All-Star Game selection. He also 
won a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding MLB right fielder.[29] 
Ichiro began wearing high stocking baseball pants in the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic.[30] In May and June, Ichiro hit in 25 consecutive games, breaking 
the previous Seattle Mariners record set by Joey Cora in 1997.[31][32] 
Ichiro broke Tim Raines' American League record by stealing 41 consecutive 
bases without being caught.[33] Ichiro extended the record to 45; the major 
league record of 50 belongs to Vince Coleman.[34] On July 10, 2007, he 
became the first player to hit an inside-the-park home run in any MLB All-Star 
Game after an unpredictable hop off the right field wall of AT&T Park in 
San Francisco. It was the first inside-the-park home run of Ichiro's professional 
career.[35] Ichiro was a perfect 3-for-3 in the game and was named the 
Most Valuable Player in the American League's 5–4 victory. 2007 marked 
the end of Ichiro's second contract with the Mariners, and he initially 
told MLB.com that he would likely enter the free agent market, citing the 
team's lack of success in recent years. However, in July Ichiro signed 
a five-year contract extension with Seattle.[36] The deal was reported 
to be worth $90 million, consisting of a $17 million annual salary and 
$5 million signing bonus.[37] The Associated Press reported that Ichiro's 
contract extension defers $25 million of the $90 million at 5.5% interest 
until after his retirement, with payments through 2032. Other provisions 
in Ichiro's contract include a yearly housing allowance of more than $30,000, 
and four first-class round-trip tickets to Japan each year for his family. 
He is provided with either a new Jeep or Mercedes SUV, as well as a personal 
trainer and interpreter. On July 29, 2007, Ichiro collected his 1,500th 
U.S. hit, the third fastest to reach the MLB milestone behind Al Simmons 
and George Sisler.[38] Ichiro had 213 hits in 2008, his eighth straight 
200-hit season. This tied the 107-year-old record set by Wee Willie Keeler. 
Typically, Ichiro was among baseball's leaders in reaching base on an error 
(14 times in 2008, more than any other batter in the AL), and in infield 
hits (his 56 were the most in the majors).[39][39] Ichiro has amassed more 
than 450 infield hits in his U.S. career. Detroit third baseman Brandon 
Inge told the New York Times, "I wish you could put a camera at third base 
to see how he hits the ball and see the way it deceives you. You can call 
some guys’ infield hits cheap, but not his. He has amazing technique."[40] 
In May 2008, Ichiro stole two bases, giving him a career total of 292, 
surpassing the previous Seattle Mariners team record of 290 set by second 
baseman Julio Cruz. Cruz, who now does Spanish-language broadcasts of Mariners 
games, was watching from the broadcast booth as Ichiro broke his record.[41][42] 
On July 29, 2008 Ichiro became the second-youngest player to amass 3,000 
top-level professional hits (1,278 in Japan + 1,722 in the U.S.) after 
Ty Cobb He also became just the second Japanese professional to get 3,000 
hits (Nippon Professional Baseball's record holder is Isao Harimoto, with 
3,085 hits).[43] By 2008, it had emerged in the media that Ichiro was known 
within baseball for his tradition of exhorting the American League team 
with a profanity-laced pregame speech in the clubhouse prior to the MLB 
All-Star Game.[44] Asked if the speech had had any effect on the AL's decade-long 
winning streak, Ichiro deadpanned, "I’ve got to say over 90 percent." Minnesota 
first baseman Justin Morneau describes the effect: "If you’ve never seen 
it, it's definitely something pretty funny. It's hard to explain, the effect 
it has on everyone. It's such a tense environment. Everyone's a little 
nervous for the game, and then he comes out. He doesn’t say a whole lot 
the whole time he's in there, and all of a sudden, the manager gets done 
with his speech, and he pops off." Boston's slugger David Ortiz says simply, 
"It's why we win." Despite struggling uncharacteristically during most 
of the tournament, Ichiro provided the game-winning hit in the Championship 
game against South Korea. With two outs in the top of the tenth inning, 
he broke a 3–3 tie with a two-run single. This would prove to be the margin 
of victory in Japan's 5–3 defeat of South Korea. Ichiro ended the night 
4-for-6, and is now 6-for-10 in WBC championship games. Ichiro began his 
2009 season by going on the disabled list for the first time in his career. 
He had a bleeding ulcer, which team doctor Mitch Storey said may have been 
caused in part by the stress of playing in the World Baseball Classic.[45] 
After missing 8 games, Ichiro debuted on April 15 and went 2-for-5 against 
the Angels, including a grand slam for his 3,085th career hit. The home 
run matched Isao Harimoto's Japanese record for career hits, and Harimoto 
had been flown out to Seattle to witness the event.[46] Ichiro surpassed 
the record the following night. Ichiro was named #30 on the Sporting News' 
2009 list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball, voted upon by 
a 100-person panel of experts and former stars. In May and June, Ichiro 
surpassed his own franchise record with a 27-game hitting streak.[47] Ichiro 
went on to record 44 hits in June 2009, his 20th career month with 40 or 
more hits. The previous players to have accomplished this were Stan Musial 
in the NL and Lou Gehrig in the AL. On September 6 against the Oakland 
A's, Ichiro collected his 2,000th MLB hit on the second pitch of the game, 
a double along the first base foul line. He is the second-fastest player 
to reach the milestone, behind Al Simmons. On September 13 against the 
Texas Rangers, Ichiro collected his 200th hit of the season for the ninth 
consecutive year, setting an all-time major league record. Ichiro recorded 
210 hits with Orix in 1994, thereby giving him a total of ten 200 hit seasons 
in his professional career. With two outs in the bottom of the 9th inning, 
September 18, Ichiro hit a walk-off, two-run home run against Yankees closer 
Mariano Rivera, scoring Michael Saunders in one of the more memorable victories 
of the season. His homer made a winner out of Félix Hernández, who was 
in line for the loss despite having allowed only one run in 9 innings pitched.[48] 
On September 26, 2009, Ichiro was ejected from a game for the first time 
in his professional career. Arguing that a strikeout pitch from Toronto's 
David Purcey had been outside, Ichiro used his bat to draw a line on the 
outer edge of the plate, and was immediately tossed by umpire Brian Runge. 
He was the only Mariner to be ejected from a game all season.[49][50] The 
ejection may have hurt Ichiro's chances regarding an esoteric record: the 
longest playing streak without going hitless in consecutive games. Ichiro's 
stretch was at 180 games, the longest in the majors since Doc Cramer went 
191 consecutive games without back-to-back 0-fers in 1934–35. Ichiro went 
hitless in the following afternoon's game. Ichiro again led the majors 
in hits in 2009, with 225.[51] In spite of hitting ground balls at a rate 
of 55 percent, he grounded into only one double play all season, in the 
April 15th game, his 1st game played in 2009.[52] He won his second Fielding 
Bible Award as the best fielding right fielder in MLB.[53] Ichiro's 32 
career leadoff home runs rank ninth all time. Nevertheless, in 2009, Ichiro 
told The New York Times: After playing in the season opener against the 
Oakland Athletics, Ichiro became eligible for Hall of Fame consideration, 
by playing in his tenth MLB season.[55] On June 5, 2010, Ichiro scored 
his 1,000th career MLB run against the Angels on Franklin Gutierrez's RBI 
groundout. He is the third Mariner in history to reach that milestone. 
On September 1, 2010, Ichiro also collected his 2,200th hit, a leadoff 
infield single against Cleveland Indians pitcher Josh Tomlin. During the 
August 2010 series against the New York Yankees, Ichiro traveled to the 
Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York, to pay his respects at the grave 
of Hall-of-Famer "Wee Willie" Keeler.[56] On September 23, Ichiro hit a 
single to center field against Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Shawn Hill to 
become the first MLB player in history to reach the 200 hit mark for 10 
consecutive seasons. This feat also tied him with Pete Rose for the most 
career seasons of 200+ hits, and he surpassed Ty Cobb for most career seasons 
of 200+ hits in the AL. He finished the season with 214 hits, topping the 
MLB in that category. Ichiro also finished the season "ironman" style, 
playing in all 162 games. Only Ichiro and Matt Kemp did so for the 2010 
season. This was Ichiro's 3rd season playing in all 162 games. Also, Ichiro 
was nominated for the This Year in Baseball Award.[57] Ichiro finished 
first or second in hits in all of his first 10 MLB seasons. Ichiro won 
his tenth consecutive Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 2010, tying Ken Griffey 
Jr., Andruw Jones and Al Kaline, and trailing only Roberto Clemente and 
Willie Mays (twelve each) for major league outfielders.[58][59] Ichiro 
also won his second consecutive and third overall Fielding Bible Award 
for his statistically based defensive excellence in right field.[60] On 
April 2, 2011 Ichiro broke the Seattle Mariners' all-time career hits record 
with his 2,248th hit in the 9th inning versus the Oakland Athletics, overtaking 
the team's previous leader Edgar Martínez.[61] 2011 marked the first time 
in Ichiro's 11 seasons that he failed to make the all star team. He batted 
under .300 (.277) before the all star break for the first time in his career. 
On July 10, manager Eric Wedge did not start Ichiro, ending his then-major 
league-best active streak of 255 consecutive starts. Ichiro followed with 
an 11-game hitting streak, but Wedge noted "it's not that easy to give 
that guy a day off" due to Ichiro's iconic stature.[62] On August 22, Ichiro 
hit his 35th career leadoff homer, tying him for 6th place with Bobby Bonds.[63] 
Ichiro finished the season batting a career-low .272 with 184 hits, the 
first time in his 11-year MLB career he did not record 200 hits. It was 
also his first season not playing in the All-Star game, as well as his 
first season not winning a Gold Glove.[64] On June 19, 2012, Ichiro led 
off a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks with a single to center field, 
the 2,500th hit of his MLB career. Ichiro reached the milestone in the 
fourth-fewest games in major league history, after Al Simmons, Ty Cobb, 
and George Sisler.[65] In a 13-inning road loss to the Oakland A's on July 
8, Ichiro was placed second in the batting order and responded by going 
2 for 6 to bring his season batting average to .261 heading into the All-Star 
break.[66] In the previous night's game, Ichiro recorded two hits to break 
a career-worst 0 for 23 hitless streak.[67] Ichiro had also been tried 
at the three-spot in the batting order[68] during a season for which he 
earned $18 million. Former teammate Jay Buhner stated he felt Ichiro was 
the recipient of too much blame for the Mariners' difficulties but "at 
the same time, they need help desperately." Buhner stated that if Ichiro 
were awarded a three-year contract extension for somewhere between $35 
million and $40 million, "I'd vomit. I mean, really, no offense. No offense, 
we've got to get this organization turned around. You can't be spending 
all the money on one guy."[69] With a contract extension with the Mariners 
unknown, Ichiro stated, "It's going to go both ways. It can't just come 
from the player. It's got to come from the team, too. If the team is saying 
they need you, you're necessary, then it becomes a piece. But if it's just 
coming from the player, it's not going to happen."[70] Ichiro's agent, 
Tony Attanasio, said, "He knows that the club has to grow. He knows they 
have to play the younger guys and get them more playing time. The only 
way he knows to do that is to move on. He doesn't want to stop playing. 
He wants to continue."[71] Ichiro approached the Mariners to ask for a 
trade at midseason in 2012, as he felt guilty for taking a roster spot 
from a younger player while his team was in a rebuilding process. His first 
choice was to play for the New York Yankees. The Mariners traded him to 
the Yankees for minor league pitchers D. J. Mitchell and Danny Farquhar 
on July 23. Seattle also received cash in the trade. Ichiro left Seattle 
hitting .261 with a .288 on-base percentage (OBP), four home runs, 28 RBIs 
and 15 stolen bases in 95 games. His first game as a Yankee was played 
the night of the trade, at Safeco Field against the Mariners.[72][73][74][75] 
Before the trade was consummated, Ichiro agreed to the Yankees' conditions, 
which stated that they would play Ichiro primarily in left field, bat him 
at the bottom of the lineup, and occasionally sit him against left-handed 
pitching.[76] Ichiro would go on to hit safely in his first 12 games as 
a Yankee, tying a record set by Don Slaught.[77] Ichiro hit his first home 
run as a Yankee, and the 100th of his career, on July 30 against the Baltimore 
Orioles.[78] For the week ending September 23, Ichiro was named AL Player 
of the Week after hitting .600 (15-for-25) with three doubles, two home 
runs, five RBI, seven runs scored and six stolen bases in six games. He 
led all MLB players in batting average, hits, steals and OBP (.630).[79] 
In 67 games with New York, Ichiro batted .322 with a .340 OBP, 28 runs, 
five home runs and 27 RBIs. With his improved performance, the Yankees 
at times batted him second and also started him against left-handers.[75] 
Ichiro performed well in his first playoff appearance since the beginning 
of his career. Against the Baltimore Orioles in the 2012 ALDS, Ichiro ran 
home on a ball hit by Robinson Canó. Despite the ball beating him to the 
plate, Orioles catcher Matt Wieters had difficulty tagging Ichiro, who 
evaded multiple tag attempts by jumping over and around Wieters. In Game 
1 of the 2012 ALCS, Ichiro hit his first career postseason home run; however, 
the Yankees lost the series to the Detroit Tigers in only 4 games. On December 
19, 2012, Ichiro finalized a $13 million deal for two years with the Yankees.[80] 
On June 25, 2013, Ichiro hit a walk-off home run against Rangers pitcher 
Tanner Scheppers with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Earlier 
in the game, three of his teammates had led off the fourth, fifth and sixth 
innings with home runs, so all of the Yankees' runs in the game were provided 
by solo home runs. On August 21, 2013, Ichiro collected his 4,000th professional 
career hit with a single off Toronto Blue Jays pitcher R.A. Dickey; becoming 
the seventh player in professional baseball history known to have reached 
the mark after Pete Rose, Ty Cobb, Julio Franco, Hank Aaron, Jigger Statz, 
and Stan Musial. Jake Beckley and Sam Crawford may also have hit 4,000, 
but data for some of their minor league seasons is missing.[81][82] On 
July 10, 2014, Ichiro collected his 2,800th MLB hit off of Cleveland Indians 
pitcher Scott Atchison in the top of the eighth inning at Progressive Field. 
On August 9, 2014, Ichiro hit a single in a game, again against the Indians, 
to pass George Sisler on the all-time hit list with his 2,811th hit. Ichiro 
had previously broken Sisler's single season hit record in 2004. On January 
23, 2015, Ichiro agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Miami 
Marlins.[83] The Marlins originally planned for him to be their fourth 
outfielder, but he finished the season with 439 plate appearances due to 
team injuries—primarily Giancarlo Stanton, who suffered a season-ending 
injury on June 26.[13][84] On April 25, Ichiro scored his 1,310th major 
league run, which, combined with the 658 runs he scored in Japan, surpassed 
the record for runs scored by a Japanese player set by Sadaharu Oh.[85] 
On June 18, he was batting .294 after playing in 64 of the Marlins' 68 
games, but his average fell to .229 by season's end.[13] On August 14 at 
Busch Stadium, Ichiro singled off St. Louis Cardinals starter John Lackey 
to earn his 4,192nd top-level hit, passing Ty Cobb.[86] On July 29, Ichiro 
recorded his 2,900th major league hit against Washington Nationals pitcher 
Doug Fister.[87] On August 18, Ichiro had his first four-hit game since 
2013.[88] On August 31, against the Atlanta Braves, Ichiro scored his 2,000th 
professional run when combining his runs scored in MLB (1,342) and in Japan's 
NPB (658).[89] On September 5, Ichiro recorded his 100th right field assist 
in the major leagues.[90] In the season finale against the Philadelphia 
Phillies on October 4, he made his major league pitching debut, completing 
the final inning and allowing one run and two hits in a 7–2 loss.[91] On 
October 6, 2015, Ichiro and the Marlins agreed on a one-year, $2 million 
contract for the 2016 season. The deal also comes with a $2 million club 
option for 2017.[92] He stole his 500th career MLB base on April 29, 2016, 
against the Milwaukee Brewers, and led off the game with a single against 
Zach Davies to move ahead of Frank Robinson into 33rd place on the all-time 
hit list, also the 2,944th of his career. That milestone stolen base made 
him one of eight players in MLB history with at least 500 stolen bases 
and 2,900 hits.[93] On June 15, Ichiro recorded his 4,257 career hit, breaking 
Pete Rose's all-time record for hits in top tier professional baseball.[94] 
Rose commented that "I’m not trying to take anything away from Ichiro, 
he’s had a Hall of Fame career, but the next thing you know you’ll be counting 
his high school hits".[95] This was in response to the Japanese media labeling 
Ichiro as the "Hit King", claiming that Ichiro should be considered to 
be the all-time hits leader when his hits in Japan are included.[95] On 
August 7, 2016, Ichiro collected the 3,000th hit of his MLB career when 
he hit a triple off the right field wall at Coors Field playing against 
the Colorado Rockies. He is just the second player to reach that milestone 
by way of a triple.[96] On the last day of the season, October 2, 2016, 
Ichiro played in his 2,500th MLB game. Ichiro and Pete Rose are the only 
two players in MLB history to have accomplished playing in 2500 games in 
their first 16 seasons. [97] [98] After the 2016 season, the Marlins exercised 
their option on Ichiro's contract for the 2017 season, and added an option 
for the 2018 season.[99] Sportswriter Bruce Jenkins, writing in the San 
Francisco Chronicle, described Ichiro's distinctive style of play: While 
he is known for his hitting ability, he does not draw many walks. In 2004, 
when he set the single-season record for hits, his low walk total (49) 
led to him being on base a total of 315 times. It was the 58th-most times 
a player has reached base in a season and short of the major league record 
of 379 set by Babe Ruth in 1923.[101] Ichiro has a home run batting stroke 
that he displays in batting practice, but not in games.[62][101] The New 
York Times criticized his inability to improve his power when his Mariner 
teams were often low-scoring while noting that he also did not steal bases 
as frequently as Rickey Henderson or Tim Raines.[101] Ichiro, however, 
once commented, "If I'm allowed to hit .220, I could probably hit 40 [home 
runs], but nobody wants that."[62] Ichiro has long been interested in pitching 
professionally. He has a 88 mph fast ball, and a slider in the mid 80 mph 
range.[102] On the final day of the 2015 season on October 4, he pitched 
one complete inning at the end of the game, allowing one run and two hits.[91] 
Ichiro is noted for his work ethic in arriving early for his team's games, 
and for his calisthenic stretching exercises to stay limber even during 
the middle of the game. Continuing in Seattle the custom he began in Japan, 
he used his given name ( written in Romaji ) on the back of his uniform 
instead of his family name, becoming the first player in Major League Baseball 
to do so since Vida Blue; the custom was not continued following his trade 
to the Yankees in 2012, as the Yankees do not include players' names on 
their jerseys. However, upon joining the Marlins in 2015, he resumed using 
his given name on the back of his uniform. In addition to being a ten-time 
Gold Glove winner, Ichiro is a ten-time All-Star selection from 2001 to 
2010. His success has been credited with opening the door for other Japanese 
players like former Yomiuri Giants slugger Hideki Matsui, former Fukuoka 
SoftBank Hawks catcher Kenji Johjima, former teammate So Taguchi, and former 
Seibu Lions infielder Kazuo Matsui to enter the Major Leagues. Ichiro's 
career is followed closely in Japan, with national television news programs 
covering each of his at-bats, and with special tour packages arranged for 
Japanese fans to visit the United States to attend his games. Ichiro's 
agent Tony Attanasio described his client's status: "When you mail Ichiro 
something from the States, you only have to use that name on the address 
and he gets it [in Japan]. He's that big."[10] Ichiro performs in TV commercials 
in Japan for ENEOS.[103] His likeness is used as the basis of the character 
"Kyoshiro" in the anime and manga Major.[citation needed] When he first 
came to the U.S., he especially enjoyed trips to Kansas City to talk with 
Buck O'Neil, a former Negro Leagues star who went on to become MLB's first 
black coach. When O'Neil died in 2006, Ichiro sent a very large memorial 
wreath to the funeral service. The following year, he visited the Negro 
Leagues Baseball Museum while on a road trip to Kansas City, and made what, 
as of 2016, remains the largest contribution ever made to the museum by 
an active MLB player.[104] When Ichiro was traded to the Yankees in July 
2012, Ben Gibbard (of band Death Cab for Cutie and longtime Mariners fan) 
posted his tribute song, "Ichiro's Theme", on his SoundCloud page.[105][106] 
The Japanese name "Ichiro" is often written 一郎, meaning "first son". Ichiro's 
name, however, is written with a different character, 一朗, so that his name 
roughly means "brightest, most cheerful". He has an elder brother, Kazuyasu 
Suzuki, who is a fashion designer. Ichiro married Yumiko Fukushima (福島弓子, 
Fukushima Yumiko?), a former TBS TV announcer,[107] on December 3, 1999, 
at a small church in Santa Monica, California. They have no children. They 
have a pet dog (Shiba Inu) named "Ikkyu",[108] a combination of "Ichi" 
(一?) of "Ichiro" and "Yumi" (弓?) of "Yumiko", which can be vocalized "kyu" 
as well. The couple resided in Issaquah, Washington during the season while 
he played in Seattle, and now live during the season in Miami Beach.[104] 
On March 18, 2011, Ichiro donated ¥100 million ($1.25 million) to the Japanese 
Red Cross for earthquake and tsunami relief efforts.[109] Since November 
2000, Nobuyuki Suzuki, Ichiro's father, has run the Ichiro exhibition room 
named "I-fain" in Toyoyama, Ichiro's hometown. It exhibits a wide variety 
of Ichiro memorabilia, including personal items from his childhood and 
up-to-date baseball gear.[2][6] Ichiro is the honored chairman of the Ichiro 
Cup, a 6-month long boys' league tournament with more than 200 teams, held 
in Toyoyama and surrounding cities and towns since 1996. Ichiro watches 
the final game and attends its awards ceremony every year.[110][111] Italics
