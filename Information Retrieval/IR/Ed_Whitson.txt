Eddie Lee Whitson (born May 19, 1955) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher best remembered for his short and turbulent stint with the New 
York Yankees in the mid-1980s. He batted and threw right-handed. Whitson 
was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the sixth round of the 1974 Major 
League Baseball draft out of Unicoi County High School in Erwin, Tennessee. 
He went 32-41 with a 3.56 ERA in four seasons as a starting pitcher in 
the Pirates' farm system before making his d√©but with the Pirates as a 
September call-up in 1977. He went 1-0 with a 3.45 ERA. His one win came 
on September 17, when he made an emergency start against the Montreal Expos 
in place of Jerry Reuss, who was a late scratch.[1] Whitson split the 1978 
season between the Pirates and their triple A affiliate, the Columbus Clippers. 
He made seven starts with Columbus, however, was used strictly out of the 
bullpen by Pirates manager Chuck Tanner, going 5-6 with a 3.27 ERA as a 
relief pitcher, and earning four saves. The Pirates were in fourth place, 
6.5 games back of the Montreal Expos on June 28, 1979, when they sent Whitson, 
reliever Al Holland, and minor-league pitcher Fred Breining to the San 
Francisco Giants for third baseman Bill Madlock, utilityman Len Randle, 
and pitcher Dave Roberts. Madlock batted .328, and was a key member of 
the "We Are Family" Pirates that surged from fourth place to win the division 
by two games over the Expos, and go on to win the 1979 World Series over 
the Baltimore Orioles. For his part, Whitson was 2-3 with a 4.37 ERA splitting 
time between the bullpen and starts for the Pirates. Upon his arrival in 
San Francisco, Whitson was added to his new team's starting rotation. He 
went 5-8 with a 3.95 ERA. Whitson began the 1980 season with an 0-5 record 
and 5.06 ERA. However, he bounced back, going 7-3 with a 2.32 ERA over 
his next thirteen starts to earn his only National League All-Star nomination 
(he did not appear in the game). He finished the season 11-13 with a 3.10 
ERA, and making a career high 34 starts and pitching 211.2 innings. Injuries 
limited Whitson to just 22 starts in 1981, resulting in a 6-9 record and 
4.02 ERA. Following the season, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians 
for infielder Duane Kuiper. Whitson was converted back into a reliever 
with Cleveland, going 1-1 with a 4.41 ERA in that role. He made his first 
start for the Indians in the first game of a double header with the Milwaukee 
Brewers on August 1, 1982, pitching six innings and giving up just one 
run to earn the win.[2] He remained in the starting rotation for the remainder 
of the season, compiling a 3-1 record and 2.22 ERA. Following the season, 
he was traded to the San Diego Padres for Juan Eichelberger and Broderick 
Perkins. In 1983, Whitson was 2-6 with a 4.73 ERA when Padres manager Dick 
Williams demoted him to the bullpen. He found his way back in the starting 
rotation by the end of the season, and was 3-0 with a 2.20 ERA upon his 
return. For the season, he was 5-7 with a 4.30 ERA and one save. Whitson 
had a career year in 1984, going 14-8 with a 3.24 ERA. The Padres ran away 
with the National League West by twelve games over the Atlanta Braves to 
face the Chicago Cubs in the 1984 National League Championship Series. 
The Cubs won the first two games in Chicago. Facing elimination, Whitson 
pitched a gem, holding the Cubs to five hits and one run in eight innings.[3] 
The Padres went on to win games four and five of the NLCS[4] to face the 
Detroit Tigers in the World Series. Whitson started game two, lasting only 
two-third of an inning, giving up three runs on five hits. The Padres actually 
came back and won the game, as Andy Hawkins and Craig Lefferts both pitched 
brilliantly out of the bullpen, holding the Tigers to two hits and no runs 
from that point forward.[5] It was, however, San Diego's only win as the 
Tigers went on to win the 1984 World Series four games to one.[6] Whitson 
became a free agent following the 1984 season, and signed a five-year contract 
with the New York Yankees worth $4.4 million with a sixth-year option.[7] 
Whitson got off to a terrible start in New York, going 1-6 with a 6.23 
ERA in his first eleven starts, and soon became a focal point for heckling 
Yankee fans. He began receiving verbal abuse and hate mail, and refused 
to let his wife, Kathleen, attend home games at Yankee Stadium.[8] On June 
11, 1985, after giving up five hits and one run against the Toronto Blue 
Jays in Yankee Stadium, Whitson retired the next 19 batters he faced. Fans 
began to cheer Whitson during the game, and although the game was lost 
by the bullpen in extra innings, Whitson left the game to a standing ovation 
in the tenth.[9][10] From there, Whitson turned his season around, going 
9-1 with a 4.55 ERA over his next sixteen starts. The Yankees were just 
2.5 games back of the first place Blue Jays in the American League East 
when Toronto came to town for a crucial four game series on September 12. 
With the Blue Jays taking two of the first three games, Yankees manager 
Billy Martin handed Whitson the ball for the fourth game. Whitson gave 
up four earned runs in just two innings as the Jays won the game 8-5 to 
take a 4.5 game lead in the division.[11] Martin lifted Whitson from his 
next scheduled start on September 20. On September 22, while at a hotel 
bar in Baltimore, Maryland, Whitson and Martin got into a heated argument 
that spread to other parts of the hotel and resulted in a broken ulna in 
Martin's right arm and a bruised right side, while Whitson suffered a cracked 
rib and a split lip.[12] Whitson did not pitch again for the remainder 
of the season, finishing with a 10-8 record and 4.88 ERA. After the season, 
Martin was fired, which many Yankee fans suspected was because of his altercation 
with Whitson.[13] Whitson was used both as a starter and out of the bullpen 
by new manager Lou Piniella in 1986. He was 4-0 despite a high 7.36 ERA 
out of the bullpen, and 1-2 with an 8.71 ERA as a starter. Knowing that 
Whitson wanted out of New York, the Yankees traded Whitson back to the 
Padres for reliever Tim Stoddard on July 9, 1986.[14] Used primarily as 
a starter, Whitson went 11-20 with a 4.89 ERA his first season and a half 
back in San Diego, largely due to the fact that he led the league in home 
runs allowed in 1987 with 36. Still traumatized by his experience in New 
York, Whitson received a death threat prior to a scheduled start against 
the New York Mets at Shea Stadium in 1987. He made the start, after being 
escorted to the stadium by National League President A. Bartlett Giamatti 
and his security team. He was pulled from the game in the fourth inning 
after giving up six runs.[15] However, he extracted some revenge on his 
home turf just two weeks later, beating the Mets 1-0 in San Diego.[16] 
He settled down in 1988, improving to 13-11, and lowering his ERA to 3.77 
while allowing only seventeen home runs. His two best seasons were 1989, 
where he won a career-high 16 games and with an impressive 2.66 ERA, and 
1990, where he went 14-9 with a career-best 2.60 ERA, and hit his only
