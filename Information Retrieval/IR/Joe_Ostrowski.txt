Joseph Paul Ostrowski (November 15, 1916 – January 3, 2003) was a Major 
League Baseball pitcher. He played all or part of five seasons in the majors, 
from 1948-1952, for the St. Louis Browns and New York Yankees. Ostrowski 
did not enter professional baseball out of college, instead opting to teach 
for three years, leading to his being nicknamed "Professor" and "Specs" 
as a player. He was finally picked up at the age of 25 by the Boston Red 
Sox as an amateur free agent in 1941. The 6', 180 lb. left-hander began 
his professional career that season with the Centreville Red Sox. After 
missing the 1943-45 seasons while serving in the military during World 
War II, he played the 1946-47 seasons for the Louisville Colonels, the 
Red Sox' top farm team. In November 1947, he was part of an eight-player 
trade sending him to the Browns. After starting the season in the minors 
with the Toledo Mud Hens, Ostrowski made his MLB debut on July 18, 1948 
with the Browns. He was traded to the Yankees on June 15, 1950 as part 
of a seven-player trade, and pitched for them through 1952. After pitching
