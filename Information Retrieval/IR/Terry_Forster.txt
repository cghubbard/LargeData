Terry Jay Forster (born January 14, 1952) is a retired left-handed relief 
pitcher who played for 16 seasons in the Major Leagues. He played for five 
teams in his career and recorded 127 saves during his time in the majors. 
Forster grew up in California and attended Santana High School in Santee, 
California. A talented pitcher at the high school level, he was made a 
second round draft pick by the Chicago White Sox in the 1970 MLB Amateur 
Draft.[1] Forster rapidly ascended to the big league level, making the 
White Sox's opening day roster in 1971 after only 10 games at the single-A 
level in the minor leagues.[2] He recorded a 3.99 ERA and hit .400 (2 for 
5) as a 19-year-old. He became Chicago's top relief pitcher in 1972 and 
saved 29 games, which ranked second in the American League that season. 
After splitting time between the bullpen and the starting rotation in 1973, 
Forster returned primarily to the bullpen in 1974 and led the American 
League in saves with 24. He then missed most of 1975 with an arm injury, 
which allowed teammate Rich Gossage to become the league leader in saves 
that season. In 1976, new White Sox manager Paul Richards decided to put 
Forster in the starting rotation. The experiment backfired, as Forster 
responded with a 2-12 record. At the end of the season he was traded, along 
with Gossage, to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Richie Zisk and 
Silvio Mart√≠nez. Forster was subsequently reunited with Chuck Tanner, who 
had managed him while with the White Sox. In the 1977 season, Forster compiled 
a 4.43 ERA and hit .345 (10 for 29) with Pittsburgh. After the season, 
Forster became a free agent, eventually signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
He recorded a 1.93 ERA while saving 22 games for Los Angeles in 1978. He 
appeared in the World Series for the Dodgers, as they lost to the New York 
Yankees. After the Series, he had bone chips removed from his elbow and 
his next three seasons were shortened by injuries. He was healthy for the 
Dodgers' postseason run in 1981, which culminated in him winning a World 
Series ring after the Dodgers defeated the Yankees in the 1981 World Series. 
Fully healthy in 1982, he pitched well coming out of the bullpen. On October 
3, 1982, in the last regular season game started by Dodgers ace Fernando 
Valenzuela, Forster yielded a seventh-inning, three-run homer to the San 
Francisco Giants' Joe Morgan which proved to be the winning margin in a 
5-3 Giants win. The loss by the Dodgers propelled the Atlanta Braves to 
the 1982 National League West Division title. Forster became a free agent 
and signed with the Atlanta Braves for the 1983 season. He had an efficient 
three seasons, compiling an ERA of under 3.00 in each of those seasons. 
While with the Braves, he gained notice for his weight problem. The 6'3" 
Forster reportedly weighed 270 pounds while with Atlanta. David Letterman 
gave the left-hander national notoriety in 1985, when he referred to the 
lefty as a "fat tub of goo" on his Late Night show. Forster later appeared 
as a guest on Letterman's show following the comments; he ate a sandwich 
as he entered the set after Letterman introduced him.[3] He also recorded 
a novelty song called "Fat Is In".[4] The Braves released Forster shortly 
before the start of the 1986 season, but he was signed by the California 
Angels two weeks after his release. He finished the year with a 3.51 ERA 
in 41 appearances, but was not part of the Angels' roster for the ALCS. 
This was Forster's last season in the major leagues, although he did play 
minor league baseball in the Minnesota Twins organization in 1987.[5] Forster 
was also an excellent hitter, something usually not associated with relief 
pitchers. His .397 lifetime batting average (31 hits in 78 at bats) is 
the highest for any major leaguer in history with either 50 at bats or
