Masaichi Nagata (永田 雅一, Nagata Masaichi?, 21 January 1906 – 24 October 
1985) was a Japanese film producer and baseball executive. Born in Kyoto, 
Nagata attended the Ōkura Kōtō Shōgyō Gakkō (now Tokyo Keizai University), 
but left before graduating.[1] He joined the Nikkatsu studio in 1925 and, 
after working as a location manager, rose to become head of production 
at the Kyoto studio.[2] Experiencing conflicts with the Nikkatsu president, 
he left the company in 1934, taking many Nikkatsu stars with him, to form 
Daiichi Eiga.[2] While short-lived, that studio created such masterpieces 
as Kenji Mizoguchi's Sisters of the Gion (1936) and Osaka Elegy (1936). 
When Daiichi Eiga folded, Nagata became head of the Kyoto studio of Shinkō 
Kinema until the government reorganized the industry during World War Two. 
Against a government plan to combine the fiction film companies into two 
studios, Nagata fought hard for the alternative option of creating a third 
studio.[3] His efforts resulted in the creation of the Daiei Motion Picture 
Company, where he first served as an executive.[2] He rose to become president 
in 1947 and, apart from a brief period when he was purged by Occupation 
authorities, remained in that position until 1971.[1] Under his reign, 
Daiei produced Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) and entered it in the Venice 
Film Festival, where it won the grand prize and became the first Japanese 
film to win an international award,[4] thus introducing Japanese cinema 
to the world. Nagata also spurred the production of Teinosuke Kinugasa's 
Gate of Hell (1953), the first Japanese color film to be shown abroad, 
earning both an honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film[5] 
and the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.[6] Nagata also produced 
such renowned films as Mizoguchi's Ugetsu (1953) and Sansho the Bailiff 
(1954), as well as Jokyo (which was entered into the 10th Berlin International 
Film Festival[7]). On the popular front, Nagata's Daiei was also known 
for such successful film series as the Zatoichi films starring Shintaro 
Katsu, the Sleepy Eyes of Death series featuring Raizō Ichikawa, and the 
Gamera movies. Due to the decline of the film industry, and Nagata's extravagant 
expenditures, Daiei went bankrupt in 1971,[1] but he continued as an independent 
producer for some years after that. He produced more than 160 films during 
his career.[8] During the age when many Japanese film studios owned professional 
baseball teams, Nagata served as owner first of the Daiei Stars, and then 
of the Daimai Orions when the Stars merged with the Mainichi Orions in 
1958.[1] He promoted the two-league system, helped build Tokyo Stadium, 
and became the first president of the Pacific League in Japan.[9] He was
