Run batted in (plural runs batted in, abbreviated RBI) is a statistic in 
baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows 
a run to be scored (except in certain situations like when an error is 
made on the play). Prior to the 1920 Major League Baseball season, runs 
batted in were not an official statistic. Nevertheless, the RBI statistic 
was tabulated—unofficially—from 1907 through 1919 by baseball writer Ernie 
Lanigan, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. [1] Common 
nicknames for an RBI include "ribby", "rib", and "ribeye". The plural of 
RBI is generally "RBIs", although some commentators use "RBI" as both singular 
and plural, as it can also stand for "runs batted in".[2][3][4][5] The 
official rulebook of Major League Baseball states in Rule 10.04: (a) The 
official scorer shall credit the batter with a run batted in for every 
run that scores: (b) The official scorer shall not credit a run batted 
in (c) The official scorer's judgment must determine whether a run batted 
in shall be credited for a run that scores when a fielder holds the ball 
or throws to a wrong base. Ordinarily, if the runner keeps going, the official 
scorer should credit a run batted in; if the runner stops and takes off 
again when the runner notices the misplay, the official scorer should credit 
the run as scored on a fielder's choice. The perceived significance of 
the RBI is displayed by the fact that it is one of the three categories 
that comprise the triple crown. In addition, career RBIs are often cited 
in debates over who should be elected to the Hall of Fame. However, critics, 
particularly within the field of sabermetrics, argue that RBIs measure 
the quality of the lineup more than it does the player himself since an 
RBI can only be credited to a player if one or more batters preceding him 
in the batting order reached base (the exception to this being a solo home 
run, in which the batter is credited with driving himself in).[6][7] This 
implies that better offensive teams—and therefore, the teams in which the 
most players get on base—tend to produce hitters with higher RBI totals 
than equivalent hitters on lesser-hitting teams.[8] Totals are current
