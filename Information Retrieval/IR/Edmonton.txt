Edmonton i/ˈɛdməntən/ is the capital of Alberta, Canada. Edmonton is on 
the North Saskatchewan River and is the centre of the Edmonton Capital 
Region, which is surrounded by Alberta's central region. The city had a 
population of 899,447 in the 2016 municipal census,[12] is Alberta's second-largest 
city and Canada's fifth-largest municipality. This population represents 
66 percent of the total 2015 population of 1,363,300[13] within the Edmonton 
census metropolitan area (CMA), Canada's fifth-largest CMA by population. 
Edmonton is the most northern North American city with a metropolitan population 
over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an Edmontonian.[14] 
Edmonton's historic growth has been facilitated through the absorption 
of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North Edmonton, West 
Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place)[15] and a series of annexations ending 
in 1982.[16] Edmonton serves as the northern anchor of the Calgary–Edmonton 
Corridor.[17] Known as the "Gateway to the North",[18] the city is a staging 
point for large-scale oil sands projects occurring in northern Alberta 
and large-scale diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories.[19] 
Edmonton is a cultural, governmental and educational centre. It hosts a 
year-round slate of festivals, reflected in the nickname "Canada's Festival 
City".[1] It is home to North America's largest mall, West Edmonton Mall 
(the world's largest mall from 1981 until 2004),[20] and Fort Edmonton 
Park, Canada's largest living history museum.[21] The earliest known inhabitants 
settled in the area that is now Edmonton around 3,000 BC and perhaps as 
early as 12,000 BC, when an ice-free corridor opened as the last glacial 
period ended and timber, water, and wildlife became available in the region.[22] 
In 1754, Anthony Henday, an explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), 
may have been the first European to enter the Edmonton area.[23] His expeditions 
across the Canadian Prairies were mainly to seek contact with the aboriginal 
population for establishing the fur trade, as competition was fierce between 
the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. By 1795, Fort Edmonton 
was established on the river's north bank as a major trading post for the 
Hudson's Bay Company.[24] The new fort's name was suggested by John Peter 
Pruden after Edmonton, London, the home town of both the HBC deputy governor 
Sir James Winter Lake, and Pruden. In 1876, Treaty 6, which includes what 
is now Edmonton, was signed between the Aboriginal peoples in Canada (or 
First Nations) and Queen Victoria as Queen of Canada, as part of the Numbered 
Treaties of Canada.[25] The agreement includes the Plains and Woods Cree, 
Assiniboine, and other band governments of First Nations at Fort Carlton, 
Fort Pitt and Battle River. The area covered by the treaty represents most 
of the central area of the current provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.[26] 
The coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to southern Alberta in 
1885 helped the Edmonton economy, and the 1891 building of the Calgary 
and Edmonton (C&E) Railway resulted in the emergence of a railway townsite 
(South Edmonton/Strathcona) on the river's south side, across from Edmonton. 
The arrival of the CPR and the C&E Railway helped bring settlers and entrepreneurs 
from eastern Canada, Europe, U.S. and other parts of the world. The Edmonton 
area's fertile soil and cheap land attracted settlers, further establishing 
Edmonton as a major regional commercial and agricultural centre. Some people 
participating in the Klondike Gold Rush passed through South Edmonton/Strathcona 
in 1897. Strathcona was North America's northernmost railway point, but 
travel to the Klondike was still very difficult for the "Klondikers", and 
a majority of them took a steamship north to the Yukon from Vancouver.[27] 
Incorporated as a town in 1892 with a population of 700 and then as a city 
in 1904 with a population of 8,350,[28] Edmonton became the capital of 
Alberta when the province was formed a year later, on September 1, 1905.[29] 
In November 1905, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) arrived in Edmonton, 
accelerating growth.[30] During the early 1900s, Edmonton's rapid growth 
led to speculation in real estate. In 1912, Edmonton amalgamated with the 
City of Strathcona, south of the North Saskatchewan River; as a result, 
the city extended south of the North Saskatchewan River for the first time.[31] 
Just prior to World War I, the boom ended, and the city's population declined 
from more than 72,000 in 1914 to less than 54,000 only two years later.[32] 
Many impoverished families moved to subsistence farms outside the city, 
while others fled to greener pastures in other provinces.[33] Recruitment 
to the Canadian army during the war also contributed to the drop in population.[34] 
Afterwards, the city slowly recovered in population and economy during 
the 1920s and 1930s and took off again during and after World War II. The 
Edmonton City Centre Airport opened in 1929,[35] becoming Canada's first 
licensed airfield.[36] Originally named Blatchford Field in honour of former 
mayor Kenny Blatchford, pioneering aviators such as Wilfrid R. "Wop" May 
and Max Ward used Blatchford Field as a major base for distributing mail, 
food, and medicine to Northern Canada; hence Edmonton's emergence as the 
"Gateway to the North". World War II saw Edmonton become a major base for 
the construction of the Alaska Highway and the Northwest Staging Route.[37] 
Edmonton is located on the North Saskatchewan River, and sits at an elevation 
of 671 metres (2,201 ft).[29] Edmonton is the most northerly city in North 
America with a metropolitan population of over one million. It is at the 
same latitude as Hamburg (Germany), Dublin (Ireland), Manchester (United 
Kingdom), and Magnitogorsk (Russia). North as it is, it is south of the 
geographic centre of Alberta, which is located near the Hamlet of Fort 
Assiniboine.[38] The terrain in and around Edmonton is generally flat to 
gently rolling, with ravines and deep river valleys, such as the North 
Saskatchewan River valley.[39] The Canadian Rockies are located about 220 km 
(140 mi) to the southwest. The North Saskatchewan River originates at the 
Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park and bisects the city. Before 
the construction of two reservoirs near the mountains, it would sometimes 
flood Edmonton's river valley, most notably in the North Saskatchewan River 
flood of 1915. It empties via the Saskatchewan River, Lake Winnipeg, and 
the Nelson River into Hudson Bay.[40] It runs from the southwest to the 
northeast and is fed by numerous creeks throughout the city, such as Mill 
Creek, Whitemud Creek and Blackmud Creek; this creates numerous ravines, 
some of which are used for urban parkland.[41] Edmonton is within the Canadian 
Prairies Ecozone.[42] Aspen parkland, surrounds the city and, acts a transitional 
area from the prairie to the south and boreal forest in the north.[43] 
However, the aspen woods and forests in and around Edmonton have long since 
been reduced by farming and other human activities, such as oil and natural 
gas exploration.[44] Edmonton has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate 
classification Dfb)[45] It falls into the NRC Plant Hardiness Zone 4a.[46] 
The city has milder winters than either Regina[47] or Winnipeg,[48] both 
further south of Edmonton in latitude. Its average daily temperatures range 
from a low of −10.4 °C (13.3 °F) in January to a summer peak of 17.7 °C 
(63.9 °F) in July.[49] With average maximum of 23.1 °C (73.6 °F) in July, 
and minimum of −14.8 °C (5.4 °F) in January.[50] Annually, temperatures 
can exceed 30 °C (86 °F) for an average of four to five days anytime from 
late April to mid-September and fall below −20 °C (−4 °F) for an average 
of 28 days. The highest temperature recorded within the City of Edmonton 
was 37.2 °C (99.0 °F), on June 29, 1937. [51] On July 2, 2013, a record 
high humidex of 43 was recorded, due to an unusually humid day with a temperature 
of 33.9 °C (93.0 °F) and a record high dew point of 23 °C (73.4 °F).[52][53] 
The lowest overall temperature ever recorded in Edmonton was −49.4 °C (−56.9 °F), 
on January 19 and 21, 1886.[54] On January 26, 1972, the temperature was 
recorded at −48.3 °C (−54.9 °F) and at -61 with the wind chill, making 
it the lowest temperature including the wind chill ever recorded in Edmonton.[55] 
Typically, summer lasts from late June until early September, and the humidity 
is seldom uncomfortably high. Winter lasts from November to March, and 
varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short 
and highly variable. Edmonton's growing season is from May 9 to September 
22;[49][56] Edmonton averages 135-140 frost free days a year.[49][57] At 
the summer solstice, Edmonton receives seventeen hours and three minutes 
of daylight, with an hour and forty-six minutes of civil twilight.[58] 
On average Edmonton receives 2,299 hours of bright sunshine[59] per year 
and is one of Canada's sunniest cities.[49] The summer of 2006 was a particularly 
warm one for Edmonton, as temperatures reached 29 °C (84 °F) or higher 
more than 20 times during the year, from as early as mid-May and again 
in early September. The winter of 2011–12 was particularly warm; from December 
22, 2011, till March 20, 2012, on 53 occasions Edmonton saw temperatures 
at or above 0.0 °C (32.0 °F) at the City Centre Airport.[60][61][62][63] 
Edmonton has a fairly dry climate. On average, it receives 476.9 millimetres 
(18.78 in) of precipitation, of which 365.7 millimetres (14.40 in) is rain 
and 111.2 millimetres (4.38 in) is the melt from 123.5 centimetres (48.6 in) 
of snowfall per annum.[49] Precipitation is heaviest in the late spring, 
summer, and early autumn. The wettest month is July, while the driest months 
are February, March, October, and November.[49] In July, the mean precipitation 
is 91.7 mm (3.61 in).[49] Dry spells are not uncommon and may occur at 
any time of the year. Extremes do occur, such as the 114 mm (4.49 in) of 
rainfall that fell on July 31, 1953.[49] Summer thunderstorms can be frequent 
and occasionally severe enough to produce large hail, damaging winds, funnel 
clouds, and occasionally tornadoes. Twelve tornadoes had been recorded 
in Edmonton between 1890 and 1989,[64] and eight since 1990.[65] A F4 tornado 
that struck Edmonton on July 31, 1987, killing 27, was unusual in many 
respects, including severity, duration, damage, and casualties.[citation 
needed] It is commonly referred to as Black Friday due both to its aberrant 
characteristics and the emotional shock it generated.[66] Then-mayor Laurence 
Decore cited the community's response to the tornado as evidence that Edmonton 
was a "city of champions," which later became an unofficial slogan of the 
city.[1][67] A massive cluster of thunderstorms occurred on July 11, 2004, 
with large hail and over 100 mm (4 in) of rain reported within the space 
of an hour in many places.[68] This "1-in-200 year event" flooded major 
intersections and underpasses and damaged both residential and commercial 
properties. The storm caused extensive damage to West Edmonton Mall; a 
small glass section of the roof collapsed under the weight of the rainwater, 
causing water to drain onto the mall's indoor ice rink. As a result, the 
mall was forced to undergo an evacuation as a precautionary measure.[69] 
Edmonton is at the centre of Canada's sixth largest census metropolitan 
area (CMA),[6] which includes Edmonton and 34 other municipalities in the 
surrounding area.[71] Larger urban communities include Sherwood Park (an 
urban service area within Strathcona County), the cities of St. Albert, 
Leduc, Spruce Grove and Fort Saskatchewan, and the towns of Stony Plain, 
Beaumont, Morinville, and Devon.[72] Major employment areas outside of 
Edmonton but within the CMA include the Nisku Industrial Business Park 
and the Edmonton International Airport (including a planned inland port 
logistics support facility in support of the Port Alberta initiative)[73] 
in Leduc County, the Acheson Industrial Area in Parkland County, Refinery 
Row in Strathcona County and Alberta's Industrial Heartland[74] within 
portions of Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County and Sturgeon County.[75] 
Alberta's Industrial Heartland also extends beyond the CMA's northeastern 
boundary[17] into a portion of Lamont County.[75] The individual economic 
development interests and costs of service delivery in certain municipalities 
within the region has led to intermunicipal competition, strained intermunicipal 
relationships and overall fragmentation of the region. Although several 
attempts have been made by the City of Edmonton to absorb surrounding municipalities[76] 
or annex portions of its neighbours,[77] the city has not absorbed another 
municipality since the Town of Jasper Place joined Edmonton on August 17, 
1964[78] and the city has not annexed land from any of its neighbours since 
January 1, 1982.[79] After years of mounting pressure in the early 21st 
century, the Province of Alberta formed the Capital Region Board (CRB) 
on April 15, 2008.[80] The CRB consists of 24 member municipalities – 22 
of which are within the Edmonton CMA and two of which are outside the CMA. 
The City of Edmonton subsequently announced in March 2013 its intent to 
annex 156 square kilometers of land (including the Edmonton International 
Airport) from Leduc County.[81] Edmonton is divided into 375 neighbourhoods[82] 
within 7 geographic sectors – a mature area sector, which includes neighbourhoods 
that were essentially built out prior to 1970,[83] and 6 surrounding suburban 
sectors.[84] Edmonton's Downtown is located within the city's mature area 
or inner city.[84] It and the surrounding Boyle Street, Central McDougall, 
Cloverdale, Garneau, McCauley, Oliver, Queen Mary Park, Riverdale, Rossdale, 
Strathcona and University of Alberta form Edmonton's Central Core.[83] 
Oliver and Garneau are the city's most populated and most densely populated 
neighbourhoods respectively. The mature area sector also contains the five 
former urban municipalities annexed by the city over its history – Beverly, 
Jasper Place, North Edmonton, Strathcona and West Edmonton (Calder).[16][84] 
Larger residential areas within Edmonton's six suburban sectors,[84] each 
comprising multiple neighbourhoods,[85] include: Heritage Valley, Kaskitayo, 
Riverbend, Terwillegar Heights and Windermere (southwest sector); The Grange, 
Lewis Farms and West Jasper Place (west sector); Big Lake (northwest sector); 
Castle Downs, Lake District and The Palisades (north sector); Casselman-Steele 
Heights, Clareview, Hermitage and Pilot Sound (northeast sector); and Ellerslie, 
The Meadows, Mill Woods and Southeast Edmonton (southeast sector).[86] 
Mill Woods is divided into a town centre community (Mill Woods Town Centre)[87] 
and eight surrounding communities[88] – Burnewood, Knottwood, Lakewood, 
Millbourne, Millhurst, Ridgewood, Southwood, and Woodvale[89][90] – each 
having between two and four neighbourhoods.[85] Several transit-oriented 
developments (TOD) have begun to appear along the LRT line at Clareview, 
with future developments planned at Belvedere (part of the Old Town Fort 
Road Redevelopment Project).[91] Another TOD, called Century Park,[92] 
is being constructed at the site of what was once Heritage Mall, at the 
southern end of the LRT line. Century Park will eventually house up to 
5,000 residents.[93] The Edmonton City Centre Airport is planned to be 
redeveloped into a sustainable community of 30,000 people comprising a 
transit-oriented mixed use town centre, townhouses, low, medium and high 
rise apartments, neighbourhood retail and service uses, and a major park.[94] 
Edmonton has four major industrial districts – the Northwest Industrial 
District, the Northeast Industrial District, the Southeast Industrial District 
and the emerging Edmonton Energy and Technology Park,[95] which is part 
of Alberta's Industrial Heartland.[96] The northwest, northeast and southeast 
districts each have smaller industrial areas and neighbourhoods within 
them.[85][95] The city has established 12 business revitalization zones 
– 124 Street and Area, Alberta Avenue, Beverly, Downtown, Chinatown and 
Little Italy, Fort Road and Area, Inglewood, Kingsway, North Edge, Northwest 
Industrial, Old Strathcona and Stony Plain Road.[97] The population of 
the City of Edmonton according to its 2016 municipal census is 899,447, 
a 7000240000000000000♠2.4% change from its 2014 municipal census population 
of 877,926.[8] The 2016 census captured more detailed demographic information 
on residents, including age and gender, marital status, employment status, 
length of residency, prior residence, employment transportation mode, citizenship, 
school residency, economic diversity, city resource access, highest educational 
attainment, household language and income, as well as dwellings and properties, 
including ownership, structure and status.[119] Per its municipal census 
policy,[120] the city's next municipal census is scheduled for 2018. In 
the 2011 Census, the City of Edmonton had a population of 812,201 living 
in 324,756 of its 348,672 total dwellings, an 11.2 percent change from 
its 2006 population of 730,372. With a land area of 684.37 km2 (264.24 sq mi), 
it had a population density of 1,186.8/km2 (3,073.8/sq mi) in 2011.[5] 
The census also reported that 50.2 percent of the population (407,325) 
was female while 49.8 percent (404,875) was male. The average age of the 
city's population was 36.0 years while there was an average 2.5 people 
per household.[121] The Edmonton census metropolitan area (CMA) has the 
sixth-greatest population of CMAs in Canada and the second-greatest in 
Alberta, but has the largest land area in Canada. It had a population of 
1,159,869 in the 2011 Census compared to its 2006 population of 1,034,945. 
Its five-year population change of 12.1 percent was second only to the 
Calgary CMA between 2006 and 2011. With a land area of 9,426.73 km2 (3,639.68 sq mi), 
the Edmonton CMA had a population density of 123.0/km2 (318.7/sq mi) in 
2011.[6] Statistics Canada's latest estimate of the Edmonton CMA population, 
as of July 1, 2013, is 1,289,564.[122] The Edmonton population centre is 
the core[123] of the Edmonton CMA. This core includes the cities of Edmonton, 
Fort Saskatchewan and St. Albert, the Sherwood Park portion of Strathcona 
County, and portions of Parkland County and Sturgeon County.[124] The Edmonton 
population centre, the fifth-largest in Canada, had a population of 960,015 
in 2011, an 11.3 percent increase over its 2006 population of 862,544.[9] 
In 2006, people of European ethnicities formed the largest cluster of ethnic 
groups in Edmonton. These included ethnicities mostly of English, Scottish, 
German, Irish, Ukrainian, Polish, and French origin.[125] According to 
the 2006 census, the City of Edmonton was 71.8 percent White and 5.3 percent 
Aboriginal, while visible minorities accounted for 22.9 percent of the 
population.[126] According to the 2001 census, 31.2 percent of Edmonton 
residents are Protestant and 29.4 percent are Catholic. 5.5 percent belong 
to other Christian denominations, 2.9 percent are Muslim, 0.6 percent are 
Jewish, 5.1 percent are adherents of other religions, and 24.4 percent 
profess no religion.[127] A Bahá'í Centre is located in Edmonton.[128] 
The first mosque established in Canada – the Al-Rashid Mosque, founded 
by Abdullah Yusuf Ali – is situated in Edmonton.[129] The Baitul Hadi Mosque 
is the only Ahmadiyya mosque in the city. Edmonton also hosts a Maronite 
Catholic church, on 76 Avenue/98 Street, with services in English on Saturdays 
and Arabic on Sundays. The Lebanese community also has a Druze Community 
Centre on the north side of the city. The Edmonton Alberta Temple of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was dedicated on December 11, 
1999. The Hindu Community in Edmonton is served by the Hindu Society of 
Alberta[130] (North Indian Temple) and the Maha Ganapathy Society of Alberta 
(South Indian Temple).[131] The Sikh community in Edmonton is served by 
four gurdwaras. The Jewish Community in Edmonton is served by Jewish Federation 
of Edmonton.[132] The region is served by five synagogues.[133] Edmonton 
is also home to two of Alberta's five Unitarian Universalist congregations 
– the Unitarian Church of Edmonton[134] and the Westwood Unitarian Congregation;[135] 
the other three are located in Calgary, Lethbridge, and Red Deer.[136] 
Edmonton is the major economic centre for northern and central Alberta 
and a major centre for the oil and gas industry. As of 2014, the estimated 
value of major projects within the Edmonton Capital Region was $57.8-billion, 
of which $34.4-billion are within the oil and gas, oil sands and pipeline 
sectors.[137] Edmonton traditionally has been a hub for Albertan petrochemical 
industries, earning it the nickname "Oil Capital of Canada" in the 1940s.[138] 
Supply and service industries drive the energy extraction engine, while 
research develops new technologies and supports expanded value-added processing 
of Alberta's massive oil, gas, and oil sands reserves. These are reported 
to be the second-largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia.[139] Much of 
the growth in technology sectors is due to Edmonton's reputation as one 
of Canada’s premier research and education centres. Research initiatives 
are anchored by educational institutions such as the University of Alberta 
(U of A) as well as government initiatives underway at the Alberta Research 
Council and Edmonton Research Park. The U of A campus is home to the National 
Institute for Nanotechnology.[140] During the 1970s and 1980s, Edmonton 
became a major financial centre, with both regional offices of Canada's 
major banks and locally based institutions opening.[141] However, the turmoil 
of the late-1980s economy radically changed the situation. Locally based 
operations such as Principal Trust and Canadian Commercial Bank[142] would 
fail, and some regional offices were moved to other cities. The 1990s saw 
a solidification of the economy, and Edmonton is now home to Canadian Western 
Bank, the only publicly traded Schedule I chartered bank headquarters west 
of Toronto.[143] Other major financial centres include ATB Financial, Servus 
Credit Union (formerly Capital City Savings), TD Canada Trust and Manulife 
Financial.[144] Edmonton has been the birthplace of several companies that 
have grown to international stature.[145] The local retail market has also 
seen the creation of many successful store concepts, such as The Brick, 
Katz Group, AutoCanada, Boston Pizza, Pizza 73, Liquor Stores GP (which 
includes Liquor Depot, Liquor Barn, OK Liquor, and Grapes & Grains), Planet 
Organic, Shaw Communications, Empire Design, Running Room, Booster Juice, 
Earl's, Fountain Tire and XS Cargo.[146] Edmonton's geographical location 
has made it an ideal spot for distribution and logistics. CN Rail's North 
American operational facility is located in the city, as well as a major 
intermodal facility that handles all incoming freight from the port of 
Prince Rupert in British Columbia.[147] Edmonton is home to several shopping 
malls, including Canada's first mall, Westmount Centre; and the largest 
mall in North America, West Edmonton Mall, which is also considered to 
be the 10th largest mall in the world.[148][149] Other mentionable malls 
include Bonnie Doon Shopping Centre, Edmonton City Centre (a combination 
of the former Edmonton Centre and Eaton Centre malls), Southgate Centre, 
Kingsway Mall, Northgate Centre, Abbotsfield Mall, Londonderry Mall, and 
Mill Woods Town Centre.[150] Edmonton also has many big box shopping centres 
and power centres. Some of the major ones include South Edmonton Common 
(North America's largest open air retail development),[151] Skyview Power 
Centre, Terra Losa Centre, Oliver Square, Southpark Centre, The Meadows, 
Christy's Corner, and Westpoint. In 2008, construction started on the Windermere 
power centre.[152] In contrast to suburban centres, Edmonton has many urban 
retail locations. The largest of them all, Old Strathcona, includes many 
independent stores between 99 Street and 109 Street on Whyte Avenue and 
area.[153] In around the downtown of Edmonton, there are a small handful 
of shopping districts, such as previously mentioned Edmonton City Centre 
mall, Jasper Avenue and 104 Street. Near Oliver, 124 Street is home to 
a significant number of retail stores. Edmonton is the Canadian testing-ground 
for many American retailers, such as Bath & Body Works and Calvin Klein.[154] 
Many events are anchored in the downtown Arts District, centred around 
Churchill Square (named in honour of Sir Winston Churchill). On the south 
side of the river, the University district and Whyte Avenue contain theatres, 
concert halls, and various live music venues. The Francis Winspear Centre 
for Music[155] was opened in 1997 after years of planning and fundraising.[156] 
Described as one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in Canada, 
it is home to the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and hosts a wide variety 
of shows every year. It seats 1,932 patrons and houses the $3-million Davis 
Concert Organ, the largest concert organ in Canada.[157] Across 102 Avenue 
is the Citadel Theatre, named after The Salvation Army Citadel in which 
Joe Shoctor first started the Citadel Theatre Company in 1965. It is now 
one of the largest theatre complexes in Canada, with five halls, each specializing 
in different kinds of productions.[158] In 2015, the Citadel Theatre also 
became home to Catalyst Theatre. On the University of Alberta grounds is 
the 2,534-seat Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, which were undertaken 
over a year of heavy renovations carried out as part of the province's 
2005 centennial celebrations. Both it and its southern twin in Calgary 
were constructed in 1955 for the province's golden jubilee and have hosted 
many concerts, musicals, and ballets. The Edmonton Opera uses the Jubilee 
as its base of operations. On the front of the building is a quote from 
Suetonius' Life of Augustus: "He found a city built of brick – left it 
built of marble." The Old Strathcona neighbourhood is home to the Theatre 
District, which holds the ATB Financial Arts Barns (headquarters of the 
Edmonton International Fringe Festival), The Walterdale Playhouse, and 
the Varscona Theatre (base of operations for several theatre companies, 
including Teatro la Quindicina, Shadow Theatre, Die-Nasty, Plane Jane Theatre, 
and Grindstone Theatre!). Edmonton was named cultural capital of Canada 
in 2007.[159][160] The Ukrainian Dnipro Ensemble of Edmonton, along with 
other Ukrainian choirs such as the Ukrainian Male Chorus of Edmonton, helps 
preserve the Ukrainian musical culture within the parameters of the Canadian 
multicultural identity in Edmonton.[161] Edmonton plays host to several 
large festivals each year, contributing to its nickname, "Canada's Festival 
City".[1] Downtown Edmonton's Churchill Square host numerous festivals 
each summer. The Works Art & Design Festival, which takes place from late 
June to early July, showcases Canadian and international art and design 
from well-known award-winning artists as well as emerging and student artists. 
The Edmonton International Street Performer's Festival[162] takes place 
in mid-July and showcases street performance artists from around the world. 
Edmonton's main summer festival is K-Days, formerly Klondike Days, Capital 
Ex and originally the Edmonton Exhibition.[163] Founded in 1879, the Edmonton 
Exhibition was originally an annual fair and exhibition that eventually 
adopted a gold rush theme, becoming Klondike Days in the 1960s.[163] Northlands, 
the operators, renamed the festival to "Edmonton's Capital Ex" or "Capital 
Ex" in 2006.[163] In 2012, Edmonton Northlands conducted a poll to rename 
the festival that resulted in changing the name to "K-Days".[163] Activities 
include carnival rides and fairways, music, trade shows, and daily fireworks.[164] 
Since 1960, the Sourdough Raft Races have also been a popular event.[165] 
Later in November, Edmonton plays host to the Canadian Finals Rodeo and 
Farmfair; this is a significant event in Canada's rodeo circuit and second 
only to the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas in prestige.[166] The Edmonton 
International Fringe Festival, held in mid-August, is the largest fringe 
theatre festival in North America and second only to the Edinburgh Fringe 
Festival worldwide.[167] In August, Edmonton is also host to the Edmonton 
Folk Music Festival, one of the most successful and popular folk music 
festivals in North America.[168] Another major summer festival is the Edmonton 
Heritage Festival, which is an ethnocultural festival that takes place 
in Hawrelak Park on the Heritage Day long weekend.[169] Many other festivals 
exist, such as Interstellar Rodeo,[170] the Free Will Shakespeare Festival, 
the Dragon Boat Festival,[171] the Whyte Avenue Art Walk, and the Edmonton 
International Film Festival. In the city's early days, music was performed 
in churches and community halls. Edmonton has a history of opera and classical 
music performance; both genres historically have been supported by a variety 
of clubs and associations. Edmonton's first major radio station, CKUA, 
began broadcasting music in 1927.[172] The city is a centre for music instruction; 
the University of Alberta began its music department in 1945, and MacEwan 
University opened a jazz and musical theatre program in 1980. Festivals 
of jazz, folk, and classical music are popular entertainment events in 
the city.[173] The Edmonton Symphony Orchestra has existed under various 
incarnations since 1913. In 1952, the Edmonton Philharmonic and the Edmonton 
Pops orchestras amalgamated to form the 60-member modern version. The Orchestra 
performs at the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.[174] The city also has 
a vibrant popular music scene, across genres including hip-hop, reggae, 
R&B, rock, pop, metal, punk, country and electronica. Notable past and 
present local musicians include Robert Goulet,[175] Tommy Banks, Stu Davis, 
Tim Feehan, Cadence Weapon, Kreesha Turner, The Smalls, SNFU, Social Code, 
Stereos, Ten Second Epic, Tupelo Honey, Mac DeMarco, Shout Out Out Out 
Out, Purity Ring, The Wet Secrets, and numerous others.[176] There are 
several key areas of nightlife in the city of Edmonton. The most popular 
is the Whyte Avenue (82 Avenue) strip, located between 109 Street and 99 
Street; it has the highest number of heritage buildings in Edmonton,[177] 
and the nightlife (bars, clubs, and restaurants) are located throughout, 
but mostly west of Gateway Boulevard (103 Street). Once the heart of the 
town of Strathcona (annexed by Edmonton on February 1, 1912), it fell into 
disrepair during the middle of the 20th century.[178] Beginning in the 
1970s, a coordinated effort to revive the area through the establishment 
of a business revitalization zone has produced an area rich with restored 
historical buildings and pleasant streetscapes.[97] Its proximity to the 
University of Alberta has led to a high number of establishments ranging 
from restaurants and pubs to trendy clubs while hosting a wide variety 
of retail and specialty shops during the day. This area also contains two 
independent movie theatres: the Garneau and Princess theatres, as well 
as several live theatre, music, and comedy venues.[179] Downtown Edmonton 
has undergone a continual process of renewal and growth since the mid-1990s. 
Many buildings were demolished during the oil boom, starting in the 1960s 
and continuing into the 1980s, to make way for office towers. As such, 
there have always been numerous pub-type establishments, as well as many 
hotel lounges and restaurants. The past decade has seen a strong resurgence 
in more mainstream venues. Edmonton also has a high demand for pub crawl 
tours in the city. Various clubs are also to be found along Edmonton's 
main street, Jasper Avenue. The Edmonton City Centre mall also houses an 
Empire Theatres movie theatre, featuring nine screens. The nonprofit Metro 
Cinema[180] shows a variety of alternative or otherwise unreleased films 
every week. West Edmonton Mall holds several after-hour establishments 
in addition to its many stores and attractions. Bourbon Street has numerous 
eating establishments; clubs and casinos can also be found within the complex. 
Scotiabank Theatre (formerly known as Silver City), at the west end of 
the mall, is a theatre that features twelve screens and an IMAX.[20] Edmonton's 
river valley constitutes the longest stretch of connected urban parkland 
in North America, and Edmonton has the highest amount of parkland per capita 
of any Canadian city; the river valley is 22 times larger than New York 
City's Central Park.[181] The river valley is home to various parks ranging 
from fully serviced urban parks to campsite-like facilities with few amenities. 
This main "Ribbon of Green" is supplemented by numerous neighbourhood parks 
located throughout the city, to give a total of 111 km2 (27,400 acres) 
of parkland.[181] Within the 7,400 ha (18,000 acres), 25 km (16 mi)-long 
river valley park system, there are 11 lakes, 14 ravines, and 22 major 
parks, and most of the city has accessible bike and walking trail connections.[182] 
These trails are also part of the 235 km (146 mi) Waskahegan walking trail. 
The City of Edmonton has named five parks in its River Valley Parks System 
in honour of each of "The Famous Five".[183] Edmonton's streets and parklands 
also contain one of the largest remaining concentrations of healthy American 
elm trees in the world, unaffected by Dutch elm disease, which has wiped 
out vast numbers of such trees in eastern North America. Jack pine, lodgepole 
pine, white spruce, white birch, aspen, mountain ash, Amur maple, Russian 
olive, green ash, basswood, various poplars and willows, flowering crabapple, 
Mayday tree and Manitoba maple are also abundant; bur oak, silver maple, 
hawthorn and Ohio buckeye are increasingly popular. Other introduced tree 
species include white ash, blue spruce, Norway maple, red oak, sugar maple, 
common horse-chestnut, McIntosh apple, and Evans cherry.[184] Three walnut 
species – butternut, Manchurian walnut, and black walnut – have survived 
in Edmonton.[185] Several golf courses, both public and private, are also 
located in the river valley; the long summer daylight hours of this northern 
city provide for extended play from early morning well into the evening.[186] 
Golf courses and the park system become a winter recreation area during 
this season, and cross-country skiing and skating are popular during the 
long winter. Four downhill ski slopes are located in the river valley as 
well, two within the city and two immediately outside.[187] A variety of 
volunteer opportunities exist for citizens to participate in the stewardship 
of Edmonton's parkland and river valley. Volunteer programs include River 
Valley Clean-up, Root for Trees, and Partner in Parks.[188] River Valley 
Clean-up engages volunteers to pick up hundreds of bags of litter each 
year. There are many museums in Edmonton of various sizes.[189] The largest 
is the Royal Alberta Museum (RAM), which was formerly known as the Provincial 
Museum of Alberta until it was renamed in honour of Queen Elizabeth II's 
2005 Alberta centennial visit. The RAM houses over 10 million objects in 
its collection and showcases the culture and practices of the diverse aboriginal 
tribes of the region. The main building, overlooking the river valley west 
of the city centre in the Glenora neighbourhood, was opened in 1967 and 
is now in the early stages of large-scale redevelopment.[190] The Telus 
World of Science is located in the Woodcroft neighbourhood northwest of 
the city centre. It opened in 1984 and has since been expanded several 
times. It contains five permanent galleries, one additional gallery for 
temporary exhibits, an IMAX theatre, a planetarium, an observatory, and 
an amateur radio station. The Edmonton Valley Zoo is in the river valley 
to the southwest of the city centre.[191] The Alberta Aviation Museum, 
located in a hangar at the City Centre Airport, was built for the British 
Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Its collection includes both civilian and 
military aircraft, the largest of which are a Boeing 737 and two CF-101 
Voodoos. It also has one of only 3 BOMARC missiles in Canada. The Prince 
of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre[192] is home to the Loyal Edmonton Regiment 
Military Museum. The museum is dedicated to preserving the military heritage 
and the sacrifices made by the people of Edmonton and Alberta in general. 
The museum features two galleries and several smaller exhibits. The collection 
includes historic firearms, uniforms, souvenirs, memorabilia, military 
accoutrements, as well as a large photographic and archival collection 
spanning the pre-World War One period to the present. The museum features 
an exhibit on the role of the 49th Battalion, CEF in Canada's Hundred Days 
Offensive. The Telephone Historical Centre is a telephone museum also located 
in the Prince of Wales Armouries Heritage Centre. In addition to a collection 
of artifacts tracing the history of the telephone, the museum has its own 
theatre featuring a brief film led by the robot Xeldon.[193] The Alberta 
Railway Museum[194] is located in the rural northeast portion of the city. 
It contains a variety of locomotives and railroad cars from different periods, 
and includes a working steam locomotive. Since most of its exhibits are 
outdoors, it is only open between Victoria Day and Labour Day. Fort Edmonton 
Park, Canada's largest living history museum, is located in the river valley 
southwest of the city centre. Edmonton's heritage is displayed through 
historical buildings (many of which are originals moved to the park), costumed 
historical interpreters, and authentic artifacts. In total, it covers the 
region's history from approximately 1795 to 1929 (represented by Fort Edmonton), 
followed chronologically by 1885, 1905, and 1920 streets, and a recreation 
of a 1920s midway. A steam train, streetcars, automobiles and horse-drawn 
vehicles may be seen in operation (and utilized by the public) around the 
park. The John Walter Museum and Historical Area (c. 1875 to 1901) is on 
the Canadian Register of Historic Places.[195] The University of Alberta 
operates its own internal Museums and Collections service.[196] The Art 
Gallery of Alberta (AGA) is the city's largest single gallery. Formerly 
housed in an iconic 1970s Brutalist building designed by Don Bittorf,[197] 
the AGA collection had over 5,000 pieces of art. The former AGA building 
was demolished in July 2007 to make way for construction of a new facility 
designed by Randall Stout. It was estimated to cost over $88-million and 
the amount that Edmonton City Council donated towards its construction 
was met with some controversy. The AGA officially opened on January 31, 
2010.[198] Independent galleries can be found throughout the city, especially 
along the 124 Street/Jasper Avenue corridor, known as the "gallery walk".[199] 
Edmonton has a number of professional sports teams,[200] including the 
Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, Edmonton Oilers of the 
National Hockey League, Edmonton Energy of the International Basketball 
League, and FC Edmonton of the North American Soccer League. Junior sports 
clubs include the Edmonton Huskies and Edmonton Wildcats of the Canadian 
Junior Football League and the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey 
League. Venues for Edmonton's professional and junior sports teams include 
Commonwealth Stadium (Eskimos), Argyll Velodrome, Rogers Place (Oilers 
and Oil Kings), Edmonton Ballpark (Prospects), the Universiade Pavilion 
(Energy), and Clarke Stadium (FC Edmonton, Huskies and Wildcats). Edmonton's 
teams have rivalries with Calgary's teams and games between Edmonton and 
Calgary teams are often referred to as the Battle of Alberta. Past notable 
hockey teams in Edmonton include: the original junior hockey incarnation 
of the Edmonton Oil Kings, with multiple league and national Memorial Cup 
championships playing in the Western Hockey League; the Edmonton Flyers, 
with multiple Lester Patrick Cups and one national Allan Cup, and; the 
Edmonton Roadrunners of the American Hockey League. Other past notable 
sports teams include; the Edmonton Grads, a women's basketball team with 
108 local, provincial, national, and international titles and the world 
champions for 17 years in a row; the Edmonton Trappers, a Triple-A level 
baseball team with multiple division and league titles in the Pacific Coast 
League, and; the Edmonton Rush, a box lacrosse team with one league championship. 
Local university-level sports teams include the U of A Golden Bears, the 
U of A Pandas, the NAIT Ooks, and the MacEwan Griffins. Local amateur teams, 
among others, include the Edmonton Gold of the Rugby Canada Super League 
and two flat track roller derby leagues: Oil City Roller Derby[201] and 
E-Ville Roller Derby.[202] From 2005 to 2012, Edmonton hosted an annual 
circuit on the Indy Racing League known as the Edmonton Indy. In addition, 
Castrol Raceway hosts regular sprint car and a national IHRA events at 
their facility next to Edmonton International Airport.[203] Other past 
sporting events hosted by Edmonton include the 1978 Commonwealth Games, 
the 1983 World University Games (Universiade), the 2001 World Championships 
in Athletics, the 2002 World Ringette Championships, the 2005 World Master 
Games,[204] the 2006 Women's Rugby World Cup, the 2007 and 2014 FIFA U-20 
Women's World Cup, the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup,[205] and the CN Canadian 
Women's Open. Edmonton shared hosting duties with Calgary for the 2012 
World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. In 1892 Edmonton was incorporated 
as a town. The first mayor was Matthew McCauley, who established the first 
school board in Edmonton and Board of Trade (later Chamber of Commerce) 
and a municipal police service.[206] Due to mayor McCauley's good relationship 
with the federal Liberals this helped Edmonton to maintain political prominence 
over Strathcona, a rival settlement on the south bank of the North Saskatchewan 
River.[206] Edmonton was incorporated as a city in 1904 and became the 
capital of Alberta in 1905. Unions and radical organizations such as the 
Industrial Workers of the World struggled for progressive social change 
through the early years, with the first reformer, James East, being elected 
in 1912, followed by the first official Labour alderman, James Kinney, 
the following year. Many thousands of workers participated in the Edmonton 
general strike of 1919 and a strong block of Labour representatives were 
on council after the next election: James Kinney, James East, Sam McCoppen, 
Joe Clarke and Rice Sheppard. Labour representation on city council would 
become a near-majority in 1929, and, during the Great Depression, a full 
majority from 1932 to 1934.[207] Jan Reimer became the city's first female 
mayor, when she was elected in 1989.[208] Edmonton is represented by a 
mayor and 12 councillors—one for each of the 12 wards. On July 22, 2009 
City Council adopted an electoral system that divides Edmonton into 12 
wards, instead of the previous two for each of six wards. This system came 
into effect with the following election in October 2010.[209] The most 
recent election was held in October 2013, and elected members to a four-year 
term. Edmonton is the capital of the province of Alberta and holds all 
main provincial areas of government such as the Provincial Legislature 
of Alberta. The Edmonton region is represented by 20 MLAs, one for each 
provincial electoral district. Many of these boundaries have been changed, 
adjusted and renamed while the city has grown.[210] In the current 29th 
Alberta Legislature all of Edmonton's districts are represented by members 
from the governing Alberta New Democratic Party.[211] Six of these members 
are cabinet ministers while one of them is also the Premier of Alberta, 
Rachel Notley.[212] The city's police force, the Edmonton Police Service, 
was founded in 1892, and had approximately 1,400 officers in 2012.[213] 
Edmonton experienced a decrease in crime in the 1990s, an increase in the 
early 2000s,[214] and another downturn at the end of the decade. The Edmonton 
census metropolitan area (CMA) had a crime severity index of 84.5 in 2013, 
which is higher than the national average of 68.7.[215] Its crime severity 
index was the fifth-highest among CMAs in Canada behind Regina, Saskatoon, 
Kelowna and Vancouver.[215] Edmonton had the fourth-most homicides in 2013 
at 27.[215] Edmonton is home to 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (1 
CMBG), the Regular Force army brigade group of Land Force Western Area 
of the Canadian Army. Units in 1 CMBG include Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal 
Canadians), 1 Combat Engineer Regiment, two of the three regular force 
battalions of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, and various 
headquarters, service, and support elements. Although not part of 1 CMBG, 
408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron and 1 Field Ambulance are located with 
the brigade group. All of these units are located at Lancaster Park, immediately 
north of the city. From 1943, as CFB Namao (now CFB Edmonton/Edmonton Garrison), 
it was a major air force base.[216] In 1996, all fixed-wing aviation units 
were transferred to CFB Cold Lake. The Canadian Airborne Training Centre 
had been located in the city in the 1980s. The move of 1 CMBG and component 
units from Calgary occurred in 1996 in what was described as a cost-saving 
measure.[217] The brigade had existed in Calgary since the 1950s, and Lord 
Strathcona's Horse had traditionally been a Calgary garrison unit dating 
back to before World War I. Edmonton also has a large army reserve element 
from 41 Canadian Brigade Group (41 CBG), including The Loyal Edmonton Regiment 
(4th Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry); 41 Combat 
Engineer Regiment; HQ Battery, 20th Field Artillery Regiment; and B Squadron 
of The South Alberta Light Horse, one of Alberta's oldest army reserve 
units. Despite being far from Canada's coasts, Edmonton is also the home 
of HMCS Nonsuch,[218] a naval reserve division. There are numerous cadet 
corps[219] of the different elements (naval, army and air force) within 
Edmonton as well. Edmonton is a major air transportation gateway to northern 
Alberta and northern Canada.[29] The Edmonton International Airport (EIA) 
is the main airport serving the city. The EIA provides passenger service 
to destinations in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. 
The EIA is located within Leduc County, adjacent to the City of Leduc and 
the Nisku Industrial Business Park. With direct air distances from Edmonton 
to places such as London in Europe being shorter than to other main airports 
in western North America,[220] Edmonton Airports is working to establish 
a major container shipping hub called Port Alberta.[221] Edmonton serves 
as a major transportation hub for Canadian National Railway, whose North 
American operations management centre is located at their Edmonton offices. 
It is also tied into the Canadian Pacific Railway network, which provides 
service from Calgary to the south and extends northeast of Edmonton to 
serve Alberta's Industrial Heartland. Inter-city rail passenger rail service 
is provided by Via Rail's premier train, the Canadian, as it travels between 
Vancouver, British Columbia, and Toronto, Ontario. Passenger trains stop 
at the Edmonton railway station three days a week in both directions. The 
train connects Edmonton to multiple stops in British Columbia, Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario.[222] The Edmonton Transit System (ETS) 
is the city's public transit agency, operating the Edmonton Light Rail 
Transit (LRT) line as well as a fleet of buses.[223] Approximately one-third 
of people in the Edmonton Capital Region (mostly from Edmonton proper) 
use ETS per day (354,440[224][225] out of 1,034,945[226]). There are approximately 
280,000 ETS bus riders on average per day.[224] From the 1990s to early 
2009, Edmonton was one of two cities in Canada still operating trolley 
buses, along with Vancouver. On June 18, 2008, City Council decided to 
abandon the Edmonton trolley bus system[227] and the last trolley bus ran 
on May 2, 2009.[228][229] Scheduled LRT service began on April 23, 1978, 
with five extensions of the single line completed since.[230] The original 
Edmonton line is considered to be the first "modern" light rail line in 
North America (i.e., built from scratch, rather than being an upgrade of 
an old system). It introduced the use of German-designed rolling stock 
that subsequently became the standard light rail vehicle of the United 
States.[230] The Edmonton "proof-of-payment" fare collection system adopted 
in 1980 – modelled after European ticket systems – became the North American 
transit industry's preferred approach for subsequent light rail projects.[231] 
The four-year South LRT extension was opened in full on April 24, 2010, 
which sees trains travelling to Century Park[232] (located at 23 Avenue 
and 111 Street), making stops at South Campus and Southgate Centre along 
the way.[232] A line to the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology in 
north-central Edmonton using the same high floor technology of the existing 
system opened September 6, 2015. Edmonton is also expanding the LRT to 
Mill Woods (the southeast) by 2020 and to Lewis Farms (the west) thereafter 
using low floor technology. A largely gridded system forms most of Edmonton's 
street and road network.[233] The address system is mostly numbered, with 
streets running south to north and avenues running east to west. In built-up 
areas built since the 1950s, local streets and major roadways generally 
do not conform to the grid system. Major roadways include Kingsway, Yellowhead 
Trail (Highway 16), Whitemud Drive and Anthony Henday Drive, and the city 
is connected to other communities elsewhere in Alberta, British Columbia, 
and Saskatchewan via the Yellowhead Highway to the west and east and the 
Queen Elizabeth II Highway (Alberta Highway 2) to the south.[234][235] 
There is an extensive multi-use trail system for bicycles and pedestrians 
throughout the city; however, most of this is within the river valley parkland 
system.[236] Edmonton's first power company established itself in 1891 
and installed streetlights along the city's main avenue, Jasper Avenue. 
The power company was bought by the Town of Edmonton in 1902 and remains 
under municipal ownership today as EPCOR. Also in charge of water treatment, 
in 2002 EPCOR installed the world's largest ultraviolet (UV) water treatment 
or ultraviolet disinfection system at its E.L. Smith Water Treatment Plant.[237] 
The Edmonton Composting Facility, the largest of its type in the world, 
is also the largest stainless steel building in North America.[238] By 
2016, the city anticipates that it will divert more than 90 percent of 
the city's household waste from the landfills.[238][239] Among the innovative 
uses for the city's waste includes a Christmas tree recycling program. 
The trees are collected each January and put through a woodchipper; this 
material is used as an addition to the composting process. In addition, 
the wood chips absorb much of the odour produced by the compost by providing 
a biofilter element to trap odour causing gaseous results of the process.[240] 
Together, the Waste Management Centre and Wastewater Treatment plant are 
known as the Edmonton Waste Management Centre of Excellence. Research partners 
include the University of Alberta, the Alberta Research Council, the Northern 
Alberta Institute of Technology, and Olds College.[241] There are four 
main hospitals serving Edmonton: University of Alberta Hospital, Royal 
Alexandra Hospital, Misericordia Community Hospital, and Grey Nuns Community 
Hospital.[242] Other area hospitals include Sturgeon Community Hospital 
in St. Albert, Leduc Community Hospital in Leduc, Westview Health Centre 
in Stony Plain, and Fort Saskatchewan Community Hospital in Fort Saskatchewan. 
Dedicated psychiatric care is provided at the Alberta Hospital. The Northeast 
Community Health Centre offers a 24-hour emergency room with no inpatient 
ward services. The University of Alberta Hospital is the centre of a larger 
complex of hospitals and clinics located adjacent to the university campus 
which comprises the Stollery Children's Hospital, Mazankowski Alberta Heart 
Institute, Cross Cancer Institute, Zeidler Gastrointestinal Health Centre, 
Ledcor Clinical Training Centre, and Edmonton Clinic. Several health research 
institutes, including the Heritage Medical Research Centre, Medical Sciences 
Building, Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research, and Li Ka 
Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation, are also located at this site. 
A similar set-up is also evident at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, which 
is connected to the Lois Hole Hospital for Women and Orthopaedic Surgery 
Centre. All hospitals are under the administration of Alberta Health Services, 
although Misericordia and Grey Nuns are run separately by Covenant Health.[243] 
Edmonton has three publicly funded school boards (districts) that provide 
kindergarten and grades 1–12. The vast majority of students attend schools 
in the two large English language boards: Edmonton Public Schools, and 
the separate Edmonton Catholic School District.[244] Also, since 1994, 
the Francophone minority community has had their own school board based 
in Edmonton, the Greater North Central Francophone Education Region No. 
2, which includes surrounding communities. The city also has a number of 
public charter schools that are independent of any board. All three school 
boards and public charter schools are funded through provincial grants 
and property taxes. Some private schools exist as well, including Edmonton 
Academy,[245] Progressive Academy[246] and Tempo School.[247] The Edmonton 
Society for Christian Education[248] and Millwoods Christian School (not 
part of the former) used to be private schools; however, both have become 
part of Edmonton Public Schools as alternative programs.[249][250] Both 
the Edmonton Public Schools and the Edmonton Catholic School District provide 
support and resources for those wishing to homeschool their children.[251] 
Those post-secondary institutions based in Edmonton that are publicly funded 
include Concordia University College of Alberta, MacEwan University, The 
King's University College, NorQuest College, the Northern Alberta Institute 
of Technology (NAIT) and the University of Alberta (U of A).[252] The publicly 
funded Athabasca University and the University of Lethbridge[252] also 
have campuses in Edmonton.[253][254] The U of A is a board-governed institution[255] 
that has an annual revenue of over one billion dollars.[256] In 2011/12, 
the university had over 38,000 students enrolled within nearly 400 undergraduate, 
graduate and professional programs, as well as over 15,000 students enrolled 
in its faculty of extension.[257] The U of A is also home to the second-largest 
research library system in Canada.[258] In 2010/11, MacEwan University 
had a total student population of over 43,000 students, including nearly 
14,000 full-time students, enrolled in programs offering bachelor's degrees, 
university transfers, diplomas and certificates.[259] NAIT has an approximate 
total of 61,200 students enrolled in more than 200 programs[260] while 
NorQuest College has approximately 8,500 students enrolled in various full-time, 
part-time and continuing education programs.[261] Other post-secondary 
institutions within Edmonton include Taylor University College and Seminary[262] 
and Yellowhead Tribal College, a First Nations college.[263] Edmonton has 
seven local broadcast television stations shown on basic cable TV or over-the-air, 
with the oldest broadcasters in the city being CTV (1961) and CBC (1954).[264] 
Most of Edmonton's conventional television stations have made the switch 
to over-the-air digital broadcasting. The cable television providers in 
Edmonton are Telus (for IPTV) and Shaw Cable. Twenty-one FM and eight AM 
radio stations are based in Edmonton.[265] Edmonton has two large-circulation 
daily newspapers, the Edmonton Journal and the Edmonton Sun. The Journal, 
established in 1903 and owned by the Postmedia Network, has a daily circulation 
of 112,000, while the Sun, established in 1978 and owned by Sun Media, 
has a circulation of 55,000.[266] The Journal no longer publishes a Sunday 
edition as of July 2012.[267] There is one free daily newspaper in the 
city, Metro.[268] The magazine Vue Weekly is published on a weekly basis 
and focuses on alternative news.[269] The Edmonton Examiner is a city-wide 
community based paper also published weekly.[270] There are also a number 
of smaller weekly and community newspapers. Edmonton has five sister cities, 
with one American city listed by Sister Cities International.[271][272]
