Travis Calvin Jackson (November 2, 1903 – July 27, 1987) was an American 
baseball shortstop. In Major League Baseball (MLB), Jackson played for 
the New York Giants from 1922 through 1936, winning the 1933 World Series, 
and representing the Giants in the MLB All-Star in 1934. After his retirement 
as a player, Jackson managed in minor league baseball through to the 1960 
season. Jackson was discovered by Kid Elberfeld at a minor league baseball 
game at the age of 14. Elberfeld signed Jackson to his first professional 
contract, and recommended him to John McGraw, manager of the Giants. His 
exceptional range at shortstop led to the nickname "Stonewall."[1] Jackson 
was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. Jackson was 
born in Waldo, Arkansas on November 2, 1903. He was the only child of William 
Jackson, a wholesale grocer, and his wife, Etta, who named their son after 
William B. Travis, a Lieutenant Colonel who died at the Battle of the Alamo.[2] 
His father bought him a baseball when he was three years old, and they 
often played catch together.[3] Jackson's uncle took him to a game of the 
Little Rock Travelers, who played minor league baseball in the Class-A 
Southern Association, when Jackson was 14 years old. At the game, Jackson's 
uncle introduced him to Kid Elberfeld, telling Elberfeld that his nephew 
was a talented baseball player.[2] Elberfeld observed Jackson in an impromtu 
work out, and asked Jackson to contact him when he was ready to begin his 
professional career.[2][3] Jackson attended Ouachita Baptist University 
in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, where he starred on the college baseball team.[4] 
He injured his knee in college, and this injury would recur during Jackson's 
career.[4] Following Jackson's collegiate career, Elberfeld signed Jackson 
to his first contract, and he played for Little Rock in 1921 and 1922.[2] 
Jackson committed 72 errors during the 1922 season, which he considered 
the "world record for errors".[4] "I guess I set a world record for errors. 
I had a pretty good arm, see, but I didn't have much control. A lot of 
those were double errors — two on the same play, a boot and then a wild 
throw. The people in the first-base and right-field bleachers knew me. 
When the ball was hit to me they scattered. 'Watch out! He's got it again.'" 
Despite this, Elberfeld recommended Jackson to John McGraw, manager of 
the New York Giants of the National League (NL), who was entitled to a 
Travelers' player as he had lent a player to the team in 1922.[4] McGraw 
signed Jackson to a contract on June 30, effective at the end of the Southern 
Association's 1922 season.[5] Jackson debuted in MLB with the Giants on 
September 22, 1922, appearing in three games. With Dave Bancroft and Heinie 
Groh, the Giants starting shortstop and third baseman respectively, sidelined 
with injuries in during the 1923 season, Jackson drew notice as a fill-in.[6] 
McGraw was confident enough in Jackson's abilities to trade Bancroft before 
the 1924 season, choosing Jackson to be the Giants' starting shortstop.[7][8] 
Though there was doubt that Jackson could adequately replace Bancroft,[9][10] 
Jackson played in 151 games during the 1924 season[11] and hit .302 with 
11 home runs. The Giants lost the 1924 World Series to the Washington Senators, 
with Jackson committing a key error in Game 7, which contributed to Washington's 
victory.[12] Jackson was considered one of the best active shortstops in 
baseball during his career;[13] he led NL shortstops with a .970 fielding 
percentage in 1931.[4] However, he missed considerable playing time in 
his career due to injuries and illnesses. Jackson reinjured his knee in 
1925,[4] missed significant time as a result of his knee during the 1926 
season,[14] and had surgery for appendicitis during the 1927 season.[15] 
He missed time with mumps in 1930[16] and influenza in 1932,[17] and he 
continued to battle knee problems, missing much of the 1932 and 1933 seasons.[18] 
Jackson was said to "at 28, already [have] one foot in the minors".[19] 
Despite this, manager Bill Terry said that Jackson would "make or break" 
the 1933 season.[18] Though Jackson fell behind Blondy Ryan on the team's 
depth chart during the season,[20] he returned in the 1933 World Series, 
which the Giants won over the Senators.[21] Terry stayed with Jackson as 
the Giants' starting shortstop for the 1934 season,[1] in which he drove 
in 101 runs, and was named to appear in the 1934 MLB All-Star Game.[22] 
He played as a third baseman in his final two seasons,[23] serving as team 
captain,[21] although he struggled in the 1936 World Series,[24] which 
the Giants lost to the New York Yankees.[25] After the season, the Giants 
requested waivers on Jackson, in order to assign him to the minor leagues.[26] 
Jackson was regarded as one of the premier defensive shortstops in the 
league. He batted over .300 six times, including a career-high .339 in 
the 1930 season,[4] and hit 21 home runs in 1929. He was on four NL pennant-winning 
teams and one World Series champion (1933). Jackson finished his MLB career 
with 135 home runs and a .291 batting average.[4] Jackson signed a three-year 
contract with the Jersey City Giants of the Class-AA International League 
after the 1936 season. The team, which the Giants had purchased to become 
their farm team that offseason, was moved from Albany, New York, with Jackson 
to serve as player-manager.[27][28] Jackson's knees prevented him from 
appearing in many games with Jersey City as a player,[2] but he remained 
as the team's manager until July 1938, when he was replaced with Hank DeBerry. 
The Giants brought Jackson back to MLB as a coach for the remaining 18 
months on his contract, succeeding Tommy Clarke, who became a scout.[29][30][31] 
Jackson missed the next five baseball seasons as he battled tuberculosis,[4] 
eventually returning to manage in the Boston Braves/Milwaukee Braves system 
for the Jackson Senators in the Class-B Southeastern League in 1946.[32] 
Jackson returned to the Giants to coach in 1947 and 1948,[30][33] receiving 
his unconditional release following the 1948 season.[34] Returning to the 
Braves' minor league system, Jackson managed the Tampa Smokers of the Class-B 
Florida International League in 1949, but resigned in July during a losing 
streak.[35] He managed the Owensboro Oilers of the Class-D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee 
League in 1950, and began the 1951 season managing the Bluefield Blue-Greys 
of the Class-D Appalachian League, but was reassigned to the Hartford Chiefs 
of the Class-A Eastern League when Hartford manager Tommy Holmes was named 
Braves' manager.[36] Jackson managed the Appleton Papermakers of the Class-D 
Wisconsin State League in 1952 and 1953, Lawton Braves of the Class-D Sooner 
State League from 1954 through 1957, Midland Braves of the Class-D Sophomore 
League in 1958,[32] Eau Claire Braves of the Class-C Northern League in 
1959,[37] and Davenport Braves of the Class-D Midwest League in 1960.[32] 
Jackson and his wife, Mary, had two children, Dorothy Fincher and William 
Travis Jackson, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.[4] Jackson 
died of Alzheimer's Disease in 1987.[4] Jackson was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1982.[4] Despite his record and 
achievements, defensive standouts were overshadowed by power hitters in 
Hall of Fame balloting.[38] He was also inducted in the Arkansas Hall of
