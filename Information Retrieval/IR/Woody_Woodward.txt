William Frederick "Woody" Woodward (born September 23, 1942) is a former 
professional baseball player, college baseball coach, and general manager. 
He played all or part of nine seasons in Major League Baseball, primarily 
as a shortstop, but is better known for his tenure as general manager of 
the Seattle Mariners. Woodward played baseball at Coral Gables Senior High 
School and led the team to the 1960 Class AA state title.[1] He attended 
Florida State University, where he played for the Florida State Seminoles 
baseball team. In 1963 he was named third-team All-American and was named 
to the College World Series all-tournament squad.[2] During his Major League 
Baseball career, Woodward played for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves (1963–68) 
and the Cincinnati Reds (1968–71). A shortstop and second baseman, Woodward 
appeared in 880 games with 517 hits. He had a career .236 batting average 
with one home run and 148 runs batted in. On July 10, 1970, Woodward hit 
his only major league home run in 2,423 plate appearances, a two-run shot 
off Ron Reed against the Atlanta Braves.[3] Afterwards Woodward was quoted 
as saying, "If I hit one home run per every seven seasons, it will take 
me 4,998 seasons to catch Babe Ruth."[4] He played in four games of the 
1970 World Series, which the Reds lost to the Baltimore Orioles in five 
games, with Woodward totaling one hit in five at bats.[5] Woodward was 
involved in a bizarre incident on September 4, 1971. During a game against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, a sack of flour fell out of the sky and landed 
approximately 10 feet from where Woodward was standing.[6] After a brief 
stint as Reds TV commentator, Woodward returned to FSU from 1975 to 1978 
as head baseball coach, where his teams earned three NCAA tournament bids 
and one College World Series bid.[7] After working as an assistant general 
manager for both the Cincinnati Reds and New York Yankees, Woodward was 
named the general manager of the New York Yankees in October 1986. His 
resignation at the end of the 1987 season lead to a flurry of moves as 
then-manager Lou Piniella was promoted to general manager, and (for the 
fifth time) Billy Martin was named Yankees manager. The Philadelphia Phillies 
hired Woodward as general manager in October 1987, and fired him in June 
1988 In July 1988 he became the general manager of the Seattle Mariners, 
working there until his retirement at the end of 1999. During his tenure, 
the Mariners made the playoffs in 1995 and 1997. His draft picks included 
Alex Rodriguez, Jason Varitek, Derek Lowe, Bret Boone and Raúl Ibañez. 
Perhaps his most notable trade was in 1989, acquiring Randy Johnson from 
the Montreal Expos (or trading away one of the greatest hitters in history, 
David Ortiz after being told not to trade him).[8] In January 2009 the 
Mariners hired him to work as a part-time scout.[9] He is a 1981 inductee 
of the Florida State University Athletic Hall of Fame.[10] He is a cousin
