Thomas Michael "Tom" Glavine (born March 25, 1966) is an American retired 
professional baseball player. A pitcher, Glavine played in Major League 
Baseball for the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets. He was the MVP of the 
1995 World Series as the Braves beat the Cleveland Indians. With 164 victories 
during the 1990s, Glavine earned the second highest amount of wins as a 
pitcher in the National League, second only to teammate Greg Maddux's 176. 
He was a five-time 20-game winner and two-time Cy Young Award winner, and 
one of only 24 pitchers (and just 6 left-handers) in major league history 
to earn 300 career wins. On January 8, 2014, it was announced that he was 
voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, in his first year of eligibility 
with 91.9%.[1] Glavine also played ice hockey alongside baseball. He was 
drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft, after scoring 
47 goals and 47 assists in 23 high school games. Glavine was born in Concord, 
Massachusetts and raised in Billerica, Massachusetts. Glavine attended 
Billerica Memorial High School, where he was an excellent student and a 
letterman in ice hockey as well as baseball. He was a four-year member 
of the honor roll and the National Honor Society. In hockey, as a senior, 
he was named the Merrimack Valley's Most Valuable Player. In baseball, 
he led his team to the Division I North Title and the Eastern Massachusetts 
Championship as a senior. Glavine graduated from high school in 1984 with 
honors. He was elected to the Billerica Memorial/Howe High School Athletic 
Hall of Fame in 1993. Glavine was drafted by both the Los Angeles Kings 
in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft (in the 4th round, 69th overall—two rounds 
ahead of future National Hockey League star Brett Hull and five rounds 
ahead of Luc Robitaille, both 2009 Hockey Hall of Fame inductees), and 
the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball organization in the 2nd round 
of the 1984 amateur baseball draft. Glavine elected to play baseball and 
made his major league debut on August 17, 1987. Glavine had mixed results 
during his first several years in the majors, compiling a 33–43 record 
from 1987 to 1990, including a 17-loss performance in 1988. His fortunes 
turned around in 1991, when he won 20 games and posted a 2.55 earned run 
average. It was his first of three consecutive seasons with 20 or more 
wins, and saw him earn his first National League Cy Young Award. Glavine 
was the ace of the 1991 Braves' starting rotation that also included Steve 
Avery, Charlie Leibrandt, and another future NL Cy Young Award winner, 
John Smoltz. His season helped ensure a dramatic reversal in the Braves' 
competitive fortunes as they won the National League pennant and earned 
a trip to the World Series, though they lost to the Minnesota Twins in 
seven games. In an era of the diminishing 20-game winner (there were none 
in the majors in 2006 and 2009), Glavine became the last major league pitcher 
to win 20 games in three consecutive years (1991–1993). Atlanta, long thought 
of as a perennial cellar dweller, was lifted in the 1990s into one of the 
most successful franchises in the game on the strength of its stellar pitching 
staff and solid hitting. After the Braves acquired Greg Maddux from the 
Chicago Cubs in 1993, Glavine, Maddux, and Smoltz formed one of the best 
pitching rotations in baseball history. Among them, they won seven Cy Young 
Awards during the period of 1991 to 1998. Glavine won his second Cy Young 
Award in 1998, going 20–6 with a 2.47 ERA. Years later, after Glavine joined 
the Mets and Maddux played for the San Diego Padres, the three (along with 
Smoltz who still pitched for Atlanta) all recorded wins on the same day, 
June 27, 2007. The Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in 6 games in 
the 1995 World Series, and Glavine was named the Series MVP. He won two 
games during that series: Game 2 and Game 6. In Game 6, he pitched eight 
innings of one-hit shutout baseball. In addition to the championship won 
with the Braves in 1995, he also went to four other World Series with the 
team (in 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1999) in which the team lost to the Minnesota 
Twins, Toronto Blue Jays, and New York Yankees twice, respectively. In 
2003, Glavine left Atlanta to play for the rival New York Mets, signing 
a four-year, $42.5 million deal. Glavine's performance had slumped in the 
second half of 2002 and he was ineffective in his two postseason starts, 
so Atlanta refused to guarantee a third year on his contract. Glavine's 
first year as a Met was poor. For the first time since 1988, he failed 
to win 10 games, also posting his first losing record in that span, 9–14. 
He also allowed his first and only career grand slam, hit by José Vidro 
of the Expos on September 19. Glavine did get to enjoy a personal highlight 
at the end of the season, however, when the Mets called up his brother 
Mike to join the team. Glavine began 2004 well, highlighted by a May 23 
one-hit shutout of the Colorado Rockies and selection to the National League 
All-Star team. However, he struggled again during a second half marred 
by losing front teeth in a car accident while riding in a taxicab. He went 
on to post a slightly better record, though still a losing one, going 11–14. 
He started off 2005 slowly, but rebounded after advice from pitching coach 
Rick Peterson, who encouraged Glavine to begin pitching inside more often 
(including a change up in) and incorporate a curveball in his repertoire. 
Glavine's turnaround helped him earn National League Pitcher of the Month 
in September. He finished the season with a 13–13 record and a respectable 
3.53 ERA. The Mets' faith in Glavine was rewarded when he returned to his 
old form during the 2006 season. He finished one victory shy of the NL 
lead in wins and was selected to the All-Star team. That season Tom Glavine 
became the first Mets left-hander in nearly 30 years to start at least 
thirty games in four consecutive seasons. Glavine and the Mets got a scare 
in August 2006. His pitching shoulder was tested for a blood clot because 
he was suffering from coldness in his left ring finger. This was originally 
thought to be a symptom of Raynaud's syndrome, which had been diagnosed 
in 1990. According to the pitcher, "Doctors... picked something up when 
they did the ultrasound." The results of that new test showed the problem 
could be treated with medicine, and Glavine resumed pitching on September 
1, against the Houston Astros. Glavine finished the 2006 season with a 
fine 15–7 record and a 3.82 ERA, as the Mets won the National League Eastern 
Division, allowing him to make his first playoff appearance since leaving 
the Braves. He started Game 2 of the Division Series against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, pitching six shutout innings and surrendering only four hits to 
pick up the win, as the Mets went on to sweep the series from the Dodgers. 
He then started Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against 
the St. Louis Cardinals, pitching seven shutout innings to pick up the 
win, helped by Carlos Beltrán's two-run home run. Glavine's postseason 
scoreless innings streak ended in his next start. He suffered the loss 
in Game 5 while the Mets went on to drop the series to the Cardinals in 
seven games. Glavine re-signed with the Mets for the 2007 season, needing 
only 10 wins to reach 300 wins for his career. He started his fourth Opening 
Day game as a Met in the 2007 season. On August 5, 2007, Glavine won his 
300th game, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on ESPN's Sunday 
Night Baseball. In the game, he also was 1 for 2 with a run batted in and 
a walk. He pitched 6⅓ innings and won 8–3, bringing his lifetime record 
to 300–197. Glavine is the 23rd pitcher to win 300 games, and the fifth 
left-handed pitcher to do so, joining Eddie Plank, Lefty Grove, Warren 
Spahn, and Steve Carlton. Randy Johnson has since won his 300th game on 
June 4, 2009, becoming the 24th pitcher and 6th left-hander to do so. On 
September 30, 2007, Glavine started the final game of the Mets' 2007 regular 
season against the Florida Marlins. The Mets, tied with the Philadelphia 
Phillies, needed a win to either win the division or force a playoff game 
with the Phillies for the division. Unfortunately, Glavine made one of 
the worst starts of his career, allowing seven runs while recording only 
one out, with the Mets being eliminated from playoff contention with an 
8–1 loss.[2] Glavine declined a one-year, $13 million contract option for 
the 2008 season with the Mets on October 5, 2007, ending his time as a 
New York Met. However, he did collect a $3 million buyout when he declined 
the $13 million option.[3] On November 18, 2007, Glavine rejoined the Braves, 
seemingly bringing his career full circle, with a 1-year contract worth 
$8 million. On April 18, 2008, Glavine was placed on the disabled list 
(DL) for the first time in his 22-year career.[4] On May 14, 2008, Glavine 
won his first game with the Atlanta Braves since September 19, 2002. This 
was also his 304th win, and it occurred while the Atlanta Braves were playing 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. Coincidentally, both his win on September 
19, 2002 and May 14, 2008, were against the Phillies.[5] On August 14, 
2008, Glavine appeared in his final game. He started against the Chicago 
Cubs, and he gave up 7 runs in only 4 innings. A few days later, he was 
placed on the disabled list because of a recurring shoulder injury. On 
February 19, 2009, Glavine agreed to return to Atlanta by signing a $1 million, 
one-year contract that included another $3.5 million in possible bonuses 
based on roster time.[6] However, the Braves released Glavine on June 3, 
2009, as he was completing his rehab assignment.[7] On June 20, Glavine 
announced he wouldn't pitch for the rest of the season.[8] On February 
11, 2010, he officially retired from the sport, having strongly hinted 
at that decision throughout the past few months. On the date of his retirement, 
Glavine agreed to take a job as a special assistant to Braves president 
John Schuerholz starting in the 2010 season. He would also serve as a guest 
analyst for some Braves games on SportSouth and Fox Sports South. The Braves 
retired Glavine's # 47 on August 6, 2010. Glavine, a left-hander, gradually 
lost velocity over the latter part of his career. Even at the end of his 
career, he was an effective starting pitcher in the National League due 
to his excellent control and deception, switching speeds, and locating 
pitches off the outside corner of the strike zone. His most common approach 
was to begin by locating his circle changeup off the outside corner, then 
follow with alternating fastballs and changeups to confuse the hitter. 
While batters frequently make contact with his pitches, the substantial 
movement he places on them makes drives very soft, resulting in easily 
fielded ground balls and fly outs. Glavine's consistency is also highlighted 
by his durability; since his first full year in 1988, he started at least 
25 games every year and never being placed on the disabled list until his 
final season—at age 42. In addition to his excellent changeup and well-controlled 
fastball, Glavine has a plus-curve ball, a slider, and a tailing two-seam 
fastball. Despite being a left-handed pitcher, Glavine was often more effective 
against right-handed batters. Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully noted that 
this attribute is likely due to Glavine pitching from the extreme right 
edge of the pitching rubber. Like longtime Atlanta teammate Greg Maddux, 
Glavine was one of the better-hitting pitchers of his generation. He has 
a career .186 batting average—decent for a modern pitcher—and has hit over 
.200 in nine seasons, with a career best of .289 in 1996. He has a good 
eye, drawing a high number of walks (for a pitcher), which combined with 
his hits have given him a career on-base percentage of .244. Because Glavine 
gets on base almost a quarter of the time he bats, opposing pitchers have 
never been able to treat him as an automatic out in the lineup. In 2004, 
Glavine walked as often as he struck out (10 times each), another remarkable 
feat for a pitcher. Glavine is also an excellent bunter. His 201 sacrifice 
bunts prior to 2007 ranked second among active players at the time, only 
behind Omar Vizquel. Glavine has four Silver Slugger Awards, ranking him 
second all-time for pitchers behind Mike Hampton, while being the most 
among Cy Young Award Winners and Hall of Famer pitchers.[9] Glavine is 
known for a calm, unemotional personality, even during rough outings. Starting 
in 1991, Tom Glavine served as the Atlanta Braves team representative to 
the Major League Baseball Players Association, succeeding former NL Most 
Valuable Player and Braves icon Dale Murphy in the position. Prior to and 
during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Tom Glavine was heavily 
involved in negotiations between the union and team owners and was frequently 
interviewed and quoted in the press about the talks. Ultimately, the strike 
caused the cancellation of the 1994 World Series and lasted 7½ months. 
When play resumed in 1995, Glavine was frequently booed by Braves fans 
for his role in the players' union and was criticized for it in the local 
Atlanta press. Glavine currently serves as the National League players' 
representative.[10] In 2005, along with several Mets teammates, Glavine 
served as a spokesman for Volunteers of America's "Operation Backpack" 
program. The program helped equip over 7,000 homeless school children with 
backpacks full of necessary school supplies. An additional 3,000 back packs 
were sent to Houston to help Katrina victims. In 2007, Glavine supported 
the Rally Foundation through the Money in the Mitt 300 Challenge to support 
childhood cancer care by selling Vineyard Vines Rally Ties to commemorate 
his historic 300th win in an effort to raise $300,000. 300 signed ties 
were to be sold for $1,000 each. In 2008, Glavine released a charity wine 
called "Cabernet Glavingnon" to raise funds for CURE Childhood Cancer, 
an organization founded to help conquer childhood cancer through research, 
education and support of patients and their families. Since 1992, Glavine 
has partnered with the Georgia Transplant Foundation to host the annual 
"Spring training" event, raising more than 4.3 million dollars for transplant 
candidates, recipients, and their families, in the state of Georgia In 
2011, Glavine became a color commentator for Atlanta Braves baseball games. 
Glavine and his wife Christine have five children. They live in Johns Creek, 
Georgia, and Glavine coaches his sons' baseball and hockey teams. Glavine 
is a Roman Catholic and has done a recorded piece for Catholic Athletes 
for Christ. Glavine is known for being humble about his accomplishments 
and an avid golfer, so a good friend, Jack Kennedy, gifted Glavine six 
dozen golf balls that display his uniform number, 47, on one side and the 
number of losses he had in his career on the other, 203. The gift was given 
around the time Glavine received the phone call that he would be a first-ballot
