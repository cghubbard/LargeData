The Commissioner's Trophy is presented each year by the Commissioner of 
Baseball to the Major League Baseball team that wins the World Series. 
Recent trophy designs contain flags representing each team in North America's 
top two leagues, the National League and the American League.[1][2] The 
two participating teams in that year's World Series were previously represented 
by two press pins set on the base of the trophy. It is the only championship 
trophy of the four major sports in North America that is not named after 
a particular person[3] (contrasting with the National Hockey League's Stanley 
Cup,[4] the National Football League's Vince Lombardi Trophy,[5] and the 
National Basketball Association's Larry O'Brien Trophy).[6] Although it 
was named in 1985, the trophy was first awarded in 1967, when the St. Louis 
Cardinals defeated the Boston Red Sox.[7] Before then the World Series 
champion did not receive an official trophy.[8] A new Commissioner's Trophy 
is created each year, much like the Lombardi Trophy and the O'Brien Trophy. 
In contrast, hockey's Stanley Cup is passed from champion to champion.[9] 
Before 1997, the trophy was presented in the winners locker room. Since 
then the presentation occurs on the field if the champion clinches the 
title in their home stadium.[8] Since its inception, the only year that 
the Commissioner's Trophy has not been awarded was 1994, when the players' 
strike ended the season on August 11, resulting in the cancellation of 
the entire post-season.[10] The New York Yankees have won the most Commissioner's 
Trophies, winning seven World Series wins since 1967.[11] The St. Louis 
Cardinals have won four trophies, a National League record.[11] The current 
trophy was redesigned by Tiffany & Co. in 1999 and first presented in the 
2000 World Series. The original trophy was designed by Lawrence Voegele, 
of Owatonna, Minnesota.[9] The trophy is 24 inches (61 cm) tall, excluding 
the base, and has a diameter of 11 inches (28 cm).[1] It weighs approximately 
30 pounds (14 kg)[12] and is made of sterling silver. The trophy features 
30 gold-plated flags, one for each of the Major League teams. The flags 
rise above a silver baseball which is covered with latitude and longitude 
lines, symbolizing the world.[9] The baseball also contains 24-karat vermeil 
stitching.[1] The base contains an inscription copy of the signature of 
the commissioner,[1] as well as the words "Presented by the Commissioner 
of Baseball".[12] The new design was presented at the conclusion of the 
2000 World Series, won by the New York Yankees.[11] The trophy from the 
1983 World Series; this side-angle view shows the inscriptions on the team 
flags. Note the pins in the base below the baseball signifying the two 
participating teams on the 1984 World Series Trophy. The current design 
of the Commissioner's Trophy, won by the Boston Red Sox in the 2007 World
