Negro league baseball Cuban Winter League Baseball Cristóbal Torriente 
(November 16, 1893 – April 11, 1938) was a Cuban outfielder in Negro league 
baseball with the Cuban Stars, All Nations, Chicago American Giants, Kansas 
City Monarchs and Detroit Stars. He played from 1912 to 1932. Torriente 
was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. A native of 
Cienfuegos, Cuba, Torriente played in his homeland from 1913–1927 and holds 
the record for the highest career batting average in Cuban winter league 
history (.352). He earned two batting titles and hit as high as .402. In 
1920, his team, Almendares, played a nine-game series against the New York 
Giants. The Giants added Babe Ruth for this tour of Cuba. Torriente outhit 
Ruth in most categories and Almendares beat the Giants, five games to four. 
Along with Martín Dihigo and José Méndez, Torriente is considered one of 
the greatest baseball players from Cuba. He was one of the first class 
of inductees of the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. Torriente played 
much of the summer of 1915 and 1916 for the "Western" Cuban Stars team 
until an argument arose with the St. Louis manager in 1916. He tracked 
down former teammate and friend José Méndez and was hired by J. L. Wilkinson 
to play for his All Nations just before a big series with C. I. Taylor's 
Indianapolis ABCs and Rube Foster's Chicago American Giants.[1] Torriente 
would play several years for both teams. Torriente played on the great 
Chicago American Giants teams of 1918–1925. Torriente led the American 
Giants to Negro National League pennants from 1920 to 1922 while batting 
.411, .338, and .342 for these seasons. He won the batting title in 1920 
and in 1923 with a .412 average. Torriente was traded to the Kansas City 
Monarchs in 1926 and led the team with a .381 batting average. He retired 
from the Negro leagues with a career .331 average. Torriente was primarily 
a pull hitter, though he could hit with power to all fields. He had a stocky 
and slightly bowlegged build, but was known for deceptive power and a strong, 
accurate arm from center field. Indianapolis ABC's manager C.I. Taylor 
stated, "If I see Torriente walking up the other side of the street, I 
would say, 'There walks a ballclub.'" In the 2001 book The New Bill James 
Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Torriente as the 67th greatest 
baseball player ever. Torriente was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 2006. Torriente was notorious for his love of the nightlife and this 
caused him disputes with team management throughout his career. Torriente 
was sent to the bench in front of 8,000 spectators in 1915 after he "kicked 
to an Umpire." He put on his street clothes and sat on the bench, then 
Umpire Goekle sent him to the bleachers, and sent an officer of the law 
after him.[4] In 1923, he was sent out of the game in the third inning 
after objecting to Umpire Gholson's call at second base. He reportedly 
used "awful" language, then threw dirt on the Umpire's "newly creased trousers."[2] 
His temper caused him to walk off the Monarchs in 1926 after a dispute 
involving a stolen diamond ring. After baseball, Torriente lived for a 
short time in Ybor City, Florida and faded into obscurity. He died in New 
York City at age 44, after a long battle with alcoholism and tuberculosis.
