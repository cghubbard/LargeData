The 1920 New York Yankees season was the 18th season for the Yankees in 
New York and their 20th overall. The team finished with a record of 95â€“59, 
just 3 games behind the American League champion Cleveland Indians. New 
York was managed by Miller Huggins. Home games were played at the Polo 
Grounds. The Yankees of 1920 were the first team in the history of Major 
League Baseball to have an attendance of more than one million fans.[1] 
The year started with a bang on January 5, when the Boston Red Sox sold 
their star pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees for $125,000. 
The sub-headline in The New York Times the next day read, "Highest Purchase 
Price in Baseball History Paid for Game's Greatest Slugger." This deal 
would live in infamy for generations of Boston fans, and would vault the 
Yankees from respectability (80 wins in 1919) to pennant contention. The 
Indians won the pennant despite a horrific incident at the Polo Grounds 
on August 16. Yankees pitcher Carl Mays, another of several ex-Red Sox 
players who had come the Yankees' way, used a "submarine" (underhand) pitching 
style. He threw one up and in on Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman, who tended 
to crowd the plate and apparently never saw the ball coming. Chapman suffered 
a severe skull fracture, and died the following morning.[2] Mays was absolved 
of any wrongdoing, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his 
life. Meanwhile, the Indians rallied around the memory of their shortstop, 
and won the season. However, with Ruth leading the Yankees, and with his 
stunning total of 54 home runs, nearly doubling his own major league record 
from just the previous year, New York finished just a game behind the second-place 
Chicago White Sox and three behind the Indians. Ruth's 54 home runs marked 
an end to the dead-ball era, and ushered in a new style of play with an 
emphasis on power hitting. The Yankees had once been the "poor relations 
of the Polo Grounds", as Lamont Buchanan characterized them in The World 
Series and Highlights of Baseball. But the Giants had faded a bit in the 
late 1910s while the Yankees had grown stronger. The Yankees were now poised 
to take the next step to beginning the greatest dynasty in professional 
sports. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters Note:
