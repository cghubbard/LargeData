As player As manager Fielder Allison Jones (August 13, 1871 â€“ March 13, 
1934) was an American center fielder and manager in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He was best known as the player-manager of the World Series champion 
1906 Chicago White Sox, a team who succeeded in spite of such poor offense 
that they were known as the "Hitless Wonders". Born in Shinglehouse, Pennsylvania, 
Jones was an outfielder who entered professional baseball in the Oregon 
State League in 1893.[1] Jones's major league playing career began with 
the Brooklyn Bridegrooms in 1896. In 1901, he joined the Chicago White 
Sox in the new American League. Jones managed the "Hitless Wonders" in 
the 1906 World Series, which was the White Sox' first World Series win. 
That year, the White Sox had a team batting average of only .230.[2] Jones 
was head coach for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team in 1910, going 
13-4-1 and winning the Northwest championship.[3] Six years after his last 
game with the White Sox, he joined the St. Louis Terriers of the newly 
formed Federal League, where he served as a player-manager before the league 
folded. He had one last stint as a manager with the St. Louis Browns, but 
his earlier success with the White Sox eluded him, as his St. Louis teams 
never finished above fifth place. He died of heart disease in Portland,
