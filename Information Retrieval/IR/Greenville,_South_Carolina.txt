Greenville (/ˈɡriːnvɪl/; locally /ˈɡriːnvəl/) is the county seat of Greenville 
County in the upstate region of the state of South Carolina, in the United 
States.[2] The city's mayor is Knox White, who has served as the mayor 
of Greenville since December 1995.[3] With a population of 64,579 as of 
2015,[4] it is the sixth-largest municipality in the state. The population 
of the surrounding area was 400,492 as of 2010,[5] making it the third-largest 
urban area in South Carolina as well as the fastest growing. Greenville 
is the largest city in the Greenville-Anderson-Mauldin Metropolitan Statistical 
Area. The MSA had a population of 874,869 in 2015,[6] making it the largest 
in South Carolina and the third largest in the Carolinas. Greenville is 
the largest city in the Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson Combined Statistical 
Area. According to United States Census Bureau, the CSA had a population 
of 1,426,625 as of 2015,[7] making it the largest CSA in the state. The 
CSA, a 10-county region of northwestern South Carolina, is known as "The 
Upstate". Greenville is located approximately halfway between Atlanta and 
Charlotte, North Carolina along Interstate 85, and its metropolitan area 
also includes Interstates 185 and 385. Greenville has gained recognition 
in various national publications such as CNN Money, which ranked Greenville 
as one of the "Top 10 Fastest Growing Cities in the U.S." Bloomberg named 
Greenville the 3rd Strongest Job Market, 2010; and Forbes named Greenville 
the 13th Best City for Young Professionals. The land of present-day Greenville 
was once the hunting ground of the Cherokee which was forbidden to colonists. 
A settler named Richard Pearis married a Cherokee woman and received about 
100,000 acres (40,000 ha) from the Cherokee around 1770. Pearis established 
a plantation on the Reedy River called the Great Plains in present-day 
downtown Greenville. The American Revolution divided the South Carolina 
country between the Loyalists and Patriots. Pearis supported the Loyalists 
and together with their allies the Cherokee attacked the Patriots. The 
Patriots retaliated by burning down Pearis' plantation and jailing him 
in Charleston. Pearis never returned to his plantation but Paris Mountain 
is named after him.[8] The Treaty of Dewitt's Corner in 1777 ceded almost 
all Cherokee land, including present-day Greenville, to South Carolina.[9] 
Greenville County was created in 1786 and was named for its physical appearance.[10] 
Lemuel J. Alston came to Greenville County in 1788. Alston bought 400 acres 
(160 ha) and a portion of Pearis' former plantation. In 1797 Alston used 
his land holdings to establish a village called Pleasantburg where he also 
built a stately mansion. Vardry McBee purchased Alston's land in 1816 who 
then leased the Alston mansion for a summer resort. McBee decided to make 
the mansion his home in 1835 until his death in 1864. Considered to be 
the father of Greenville, McBee donated land for many structures such as 
churches, academies and a cotton mill. Furman University was funded by 
McBee who helped bring the university to Pleasantburg from Winnsboro, South 
Carolina in 1851. In 1853 McBee and other Greenville County leaders funded 
a new railroad called the Greenville and Columbia Railroad. Pleasantburg 
boomed to around 1,000 in the 1850s due to the growth of McBee's donations 
and the attraction of the town as a summer resort for visitors.[11][12] 
In 1831 Pleasantburg was incorporated as Greenville.[13] Greenville in 
the 1850s favored the Union until events such as John Brown's raid on Harpers 
Ferry and Abraham Lincoln's election persuaded the town to vote secession 
in 1860. During the American Civil War Pleasantburg became a town for refugees 
fleeing from the Union Army. The town supplied food, clothing, and firearms 
to the Confederacy. Greenville saw no action from the war until 1865 when 
Federal troops came through the town looking for President Jefferson Davis 
of the Confederacy. In June 1865 Andrew Johnson appointed Greenville County 
native Benjamin Franklin Perry as Governor of South Carolina.[11] In February 
1869, Greenville's town charter was amended by the S. C. General Assembly 
establishing Greenville, the town, as a city. Construction boomed in the 
1870s such as the establishment of a bridge over the Reedy River, new mills 
on the river and new railroads. The Greenville News was established in 
1874 as Greenville's first daily newspaper. Southern Bell installed the 
first telephone lines in the city. The most important infrastructure that 
came to the city were cotton mills. Prominent cotton mill businesses operated 
near Greenville making it a cotton mill town. By 1915 Greenville became 
known as the "Textile Center of the South."[11] During World War I, Greenville 
served as a training camp center for Army recruits. After World War I commercial 
activity expanded with new movie theaters and department stores. The Mansion 
House was demolished and replaced with the Poinsett Hotel in 1925.[11] 
The Great Depression hurt the economy of Greenville forcing mills to lay 
off workers. Furman University and the Greenville Women's College also 
struggled in the crippling economy forcing them to merge in 1933. The Textile 
Workers Strike of 1934 caused such an uproar in the city and surrounding 
mill towns that the National Guard had to subdue the chaos. The New Deal 
established Sirrine Stadium and a new Greenville High School. The Greenville 
Army Air Base was established in 1942 during World War II contributing 
to the further growth of Greenville.[11] The last lynching in the South 
Carolina occurred in Greenville on February 16, 1947, when Willie Earle, 
accused of stabbing a cab driver, was taken from his jail cell by mob and 
murdered. Thirty-one men were tried and acquitted of the crime.[14] After 
World War II Greenville's economy surged with the establishment of new 
downtown stores and the expansion of the city limits. Furman University 
doubled its student population and moved to a new location. Higher education 
facilities such as Bob Jones University in 1947 and Greenville Technical 
College in 1962 were established in Greenville. The Greenville–Spartanburg 
International Airport was established in nearby Greer in 1962. The economy 
of Greenville finally waned in the 1970s leaving a void in downtown Greenville 
due to the flight of many retailers. Mayor Max Heller revitalized downtown 
Greenville by establishing the Greenville County Museum of Art and the 
Hughes Main Library. Main Street was then converted into a two-lane road 
lined with trees and sidewalks.[15] Greenville was one of the sites of 
the 2016 clown sightings. Greenville is located at 34°50′40″N 82°23′8″W﻿

roughly equidistant between Atlanta (120 miles [190 km] southwest), and 
Charlotte, North Carolina. Greenville is in the foothills of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains, a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains 
range, and includes many small hills. Sassafras Mountain, the highest point 
in South Carolina, is in northern Pickens County, which adjoins Greenville 
County to the west. Many area television and radio station towers are on 
Paris Mountain, the second most prominent peak in the area, less than seven 
miles (11 km) from downtown Greenville. According to the United States 
Census Bureau, Greenville has a total area of 26.1 square miles (68 km2), 
of which 26.1 square miles (68 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) 
is water. Greenville is located in the Brevard Fault Zone and has had occasional 
earthquakes, though they are minor. Greenville, like much of the Piedmont 
region of the southeastern United States, has a humid subtropical climate 
(Köppen Cfa), with four distinct seasons; the city is part of USDA Hardiness 
zone 7b/8a.[17] Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily 
average of 42.2 °F (5.7 °C). On average, there are 59 nights per year that 
drop to or below freezing, and only 1.3 days that fail to rise above freezing.[18] 
April is the driest month, with an average of 3.36 inches (85 mm) of precipitation. 
Summers are hot and humid, with a daily temperature average in July of 
79.9 °F (26.6 °C). There are an average 43 days per year with highs at 
or above 90 °F (32 °C).[18] Official record temperatures range from 107 °F 
(42 °C) on July 1, 2012, down to −6 °F (−21 °C) on January 30, 1966; the 
record cold daily maximum is 19 °F (−7 °C) on December 31, 1917, while, 
conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 80 °F (27 °C) on July 12, 
1937, the last of three occasions.[18] The average window for freezing 
temperatures is November 4 thru April 1, allowing a growing season of 217 
days.[18] Precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than spring 
[18] and, on average, Greenville receives 47.2 inches (1,200 mm) of precipitation 
annually, which is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, although 
summer is slightly wetter; annual precipitation has historically ranged 
from 31.08 in (789 mm) in 2007 to 72.53 in (1,842 mm) in 1908.[18] In addition, 
there is an average of 4.7 inches (11.9 cm) of snow, occurring mainly from 
January thru March, with rare snow occurring in November or April. More 
frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain occur in the Greenville 
area; seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts as recently 
as 2011–12 to 21.4 in (54 cm) in 1935–36.[18] These storms can have a major 
impact on the area, as they often pull tree limbs down on power lines and 
make driving hazardous. The city of Greenville adopted the Council-Manager 
form of municipal government in 1976.[21] The Greenville City Council consists 
of the mayor and six council members. The mayor and two council members 
are elected at-large while the remaining council members are chosen from 
single-member districts. Greenville Municipal Court handles criminal misdemeanor 
violations, traffic violations, and city ordinance violations.[22] The 
Greenville Police Department was established in 1845 as the Greenville 
Police Force. By 1876 the Greenville Police Force became the Greenville 
Police Department. In 1976 the Greenville Police Department moved into 
the Greenville County Law Enforcement Center with the Greenville County 
Sheriff's Department. The Greenville Police Department serves Greenville 
with around 241 employees with 199 sworn officers.[23] As the largest city 
in the Upstate, Greenville offers many activities and attractions. Greenville's 
theaters and event venues regularly host major concerts and touring theater 
companies. Four independent theaters present several plays a year. The 
Greenville County School District is the largest school district in the 
state of South Carolina and ranked the 49th largest district in the United

economy was formerly based largely on textile manufacturing, and the city 
was long known as "The Textile Capital of the World." In the last few decades, 
favorable wages and tax benefits have lured foreign companies to invest 
heavily in the area. The city is the North American headquarters for Michelin, 
AVX Corporation, Ameco, CertusBank, and Scansource. In 2003, the International 
Center for Automotive Research was created, establishing CUICAR as the 
new model for automotive research. The Center for Emerging Technologies 
in mobility and energy was opened in 2011, hosting a number of companies 
in leading edge R&D and the headquarters for Sage Automotive. When the 
former Donaldson Air Force Base closed, the land became the South Carolina

area, much of Greenville County including Mauldin and Simpsonville, and 
a portion of Pickens County via a connector to Clemson. Community leaders 
are in the early planning stages for a comprehensive transit system that 
will help ease the high traffic volume on interstates and roadways. Considerations 
include the expansion of the current Greenlink bus routes. Greenville has
