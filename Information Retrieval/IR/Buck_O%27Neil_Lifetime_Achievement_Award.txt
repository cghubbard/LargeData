The Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award is an award presented by the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame every three years to honor an individual 
who enhances baseball's positive image on society, who broadens the game's 
appeal, and whose integrity and dignity are comparable to the namesake 
of the award, John Jordan "Buck" O'Neil.[1][2] There have been three recipients 
of the award since its inception in 2008. In 2008, the Hall of Fame dedicated 
a life-size bronze statue of O'Neil near the entrance of its museum. With 
the statue are a list of recipients of the award and a plaque that summarizes 
O'Neil's contributions to the game of baseball.[1][3][2][4] A smaller statue 
is given to each honoree at the induction ceremony during Hall of Fame
