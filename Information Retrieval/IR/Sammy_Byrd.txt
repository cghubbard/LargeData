Samuel Dewey Byrd (October 5, 1906 â€“ May 11, 1981) was an American professional 
baseball player and professional golfer.[1][2][3] Known as "Sammy" or "Sam", 
Byrd was born in Bremen, Georgia but grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. He 
played Major League Baseball from 1929 to 1936 for the New York Yankees 
and Cincinnati Reds. He was called "Babe Ruth's Legs", a reference to the 
fact that he often would appear as a pinch runner at the end of games toward 
the latter part of Ruth's career. In 1936, Byrd quit baseball to pursue 
a career in professional golf. He won six events on the PGA Tour between 
1942 and 1946. He lost the final of the 1945 PGA Championship to Byron 
Nelson, 4 & 3, in match play. He is the only person to have played in a 
World Series and competed in golf's Masters Tournament. He made one appearance 
in the 1932 World Series (game 4) while playing for the New York Yankees 
- as a defensive replacement for Babe Ruth - in the bottom of the 9th inning. 
He finished twice in the top 10 at the Masters: third in 1941 and fourth 
in 1942. During his last appearance in 1948 he tallied the highest score 
ever at the second hole recording a 10. He finished the round with a 12-over-par 
84.[citation needed] Byrd was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of 
Fame in 1974.[4] He died in Mesa, Arizona in 1981 at the age of 74 from 
undisclosed causes. this list is probably incomplete Note: Byrd never played
