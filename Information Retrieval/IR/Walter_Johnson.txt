As player As manager Walter Perry Johnson (November 6, 1887 – December 
10, 1946), nicknamed "Barney" and "The Big Train", was a Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher. He played his entire 21-year baseball career for 
the Washington Senators (1907–1927). He later served as manager of the 
Senators from 1929 through 1932 and for the Cleveland Indians from 1933 
through 1935.[1] One of the most celebrated and dominating players in baseball 
history, Johnson established several pitching records, some of which remain 
unbroken nine decades after retiring from baseball. He remains by far the 
all-time career leader in shutouts with 110,[2] second in wins with 417, 
and fourth in complete games with 531. He held the career record in strikeouts 
for nearly 56 years, with 3,508, from the 1927 end of his career until 
the 1983 season, when three players (Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan and Gaylord 
Perry) finally passed the mark. Johnson was the only player in the 3,000 
strikeout club (achieved 22 July 1923) for 51 years (less 5 days) when 
Bob Gibson recorded his 3,000th strikeout on 17 July 1974. Johnson led 
the league in strikeouts a Major League record 12 times—one more than current 
strikeout leader Nolan Ryan—including a record eight consecutive seasons.[3] 
In 1936, Johnson was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its 
"first five" inaugural members. His gentle nature was legendary, and to 
this day he is held up as an example of good sportsmanship, while his name 
has become synonymous with friendly competition. Walter Johnson was the 
second of six children born to Frank Edwin Johnson (1861–1921) and Minnie 
Olive Perry (1867–1967) on a rural farm four miles west of Humboldt, Kansas.[4] 
Although he was sometimes said to be of Swedish ancestry and referred to 
by sportwriters as the "The Big Swede", Johnson's ancestors came from the 
British Isles.[5] Soon after he reached his fourteenth birthday, his family 
moved to California's Orange County in 1902. The Johnsons settled in the 
town of Olinda, a small oil boomtown located just east of Brea.[6] In his 
youth, the young Walter Johnson split his time between playing baseball, 
working in the nearby oil fields, and going horseback riding.[6] Johnson 
later attended Fullerton Union High School where he struck out 27 batters 
during a 15-inning game against Santa Ana High School.[6] He later moved 
to Idaho, where he doubled as a telephone company employee and a pitcher 
for a Weiser-based team in the Idaho State League. Johnson was spotted 
by a talent scout and signed a contract with the Washington Senators in 
July 1907 at the age of nineteen. Johnson won renown as the premier power 
pitcher of his era. Ty Cobb recalled his first encounter with the rookie 
fastballer: "On August 2, 1907, I encountered the most threatening sight 
I ever saw in the ball field. He was a rookie, and we licked our lips as 
we warmed up for the first game of a doubleheader in Washington. Evidently, 
manager Pongo Joe Cantillon of the Nats had picked a rube out of the cornfields 
of the deepest bushes to pitch against us. ... He was a tall, shambling 
galoot of about twenty, with arms so long they hung far out of his sleeves, 
and with a sidearm delivery that looked unimpressive at first glance. ... 
One of the Tigers imitated a cow mooing, and we hollered at Cantillon: 
'Get the pitchfork ready, Joe—your hayseed's on his way back to the barn.' 
... The first time I faced him, I watched him take that easy windup. And 
then something went past me that made me flinch. The thing just hissed 
with danger. We couldn't touch him. ... every one of us knew we'd met the 
most powerful arm ever turned loose in a ball park."[7] In 1917, a Bridgeport, 
Connecticut munitions laboratory recorded Johnson's fastball at 134 feet 
per second, which is equal to 91.36 miles per hour (147.03 km/h), a velocity 
which was virtually unique in Johnson's day, with the possible exception 
of Smoky Joe Wood. Johnson, moreover, pitched with a sidearm motion, whereas 
power pitchers are normally known for pitching with a straight-overhand 
delivery. Johnson's motion was especially difficult for right-handed batters 
to follow, as the ball seemed to be coming from third base. His pitching 
mechanics were superb, generating powerful rotation of his shoulders with 
excellent balance.[8] In addition to his fastball, Johnson featured an 
occasional curveball that he developed around 1913 or 1914.[9] He batted 
and threw right-handed. The overpowering fastball was the primary reason 
for Johnson's exceptional statistics, especially his fabled strikeout totals. 
Johnson's record total of 3,508[10] strikeouts stood for more than 55 years 
until Nolan Ryan, Steve Carlton, and Gaylord Perry (in that order) all 
surpassed it in 1983. Johnson, as of 2015, ranks ninth on the all-time 
strikeout list, but his total must be understood in its proper context. 
Among his pre-World War II contemporaries, only two men finished within 
one thousand strikeouts of Johnson: runner-up Cy Young with 2,803 (705 
strikeouts behind) and Tim Keefe at 2,562 (946 behind). Bob Feller, whose 
war-shortened career began in 1936, later ended up with 2,581. As a right-handed 
pitcher for the Washington Nationals/Senators, Walter Johnson won 417 games, 
the second most by any pitcher in history (after Cy Young, who won 511). 
He and Young are the only pitchers to have won 400 games.[11] In a 21-year 
career, Johnson had twelve 20-win seasons, including ten in a row. Twice, 
he topped thirty wins (33 in 1912 and 36 in 1913).[12] Johnson's record 
includes 110 shutouts, the most in baseball history. Johnson had a 38–26 
record in games decided by a 1–0 score;[13] both his win total and his 
losses in these games are major league records. Johnson also lost 65 games 
because his teams failed to score a run.[13] On September 4, 5 and 7, 1908, 
he shut out the New York Highlanders in three consecutive games. Three 
times, Johnson won the triple crown for pitchers (1913, 1918 and 1924). 
Johnson twice won the American League Most Valuable Player Award (1913, 
1924),[2] a feat accomplished since by only two other pitchers, Carl Hubbell 
in 1933 and 1936 and Hal Newhouser in 1944 and 1945. His earned run average 
of 1.14 in 1913 was the fourth lowest ever at the time he recorded it; 
it remains the sixth-lowest today, despite having been surpassed by Bob 
Gibson in 1968 (1.12) for lowest ERA ever by a 300+ inning pitcher. It 
could have been lower if not for one of manager Clark Griffith's traditions. 
For the last game of the season, Griffith often treated the fans to a farce 
game. Johnson actually played center field that game until he was brought 
in to pitch. He allowed two hits before he was taken out of the game. The 
next pitcher – who was actually a career catcher – allowed both runners 
to score. The official scorekeeper ignored the game, but later, Johnson 
was charged with those two runs, raising his ERA from 1.09 to 1.14. For 
the decade from 1910–1919, Johnson averaged 26 wins per season and had 
an overall ERA of 1.59. Johnson won 36 games in 1913, 40% of the team's 
total wins for the season. In April and May, he pitched 55.2 consecutive 
scoreless innings, still the American League record and the third-longest 
streak in history. In May 1918, Johnson pitched 40 consecutive scoreless 
innings; he is the only pitcher with two such 40+ inning streaks.[14] Although 
he often pitched for losing teams during his career, Johnson finally led 
the Washington Nationals/Senators to the World Series in 1924, his 18th 
year in the American League. Johnson lost the first and fifth game of the 
1924 World Series, but became the hero by pitching four scoreless innings 
of relief in the seventh and deciding game, winning in the 12th inning. 
Washington returned to the World Series the following season, but Johnson's 
experience was close to the inverse: two early wins, followed by a Game 
Seven loss. On October 15, 1927, Johnson's request for an unconditional 
release from the club was granted. [15] Although his Hall of Fame plaque 
reads that he pitched 'for many years with a losing team,' during his career 
the Senators finished in the first division 11 times, and the second division 
10 times. In Johnson's first five seasons, Washington finished last twice 
and next-to-last three times. But they finished second in the American 
League in both 1912 and 1913, which were Johnson's two 30-win seasons. 
Then, for the next decade, they typically finished in the middle of the 
pack before their back-to-back pennants. Johnson was a good hitter for 
a pitcher, compiling a career batting average of .235, including a record 
.433 average in 1925. He also made 13 appearances in the outfield during 
his career. He hit over .200 in 13 of his 21 seasons as a hitter, hit three 
home runs in 1914, and hit 12 doubles and a triple in 130 at bats in 1917. 
Johnson finished his career with 23 home runs, the ninth-highest total 
for a pitcher in Major League history. Johnson had a reputation as a kindly 
person, and made many friends in baseball. As reported in The Glory of 
Their Times, Sam Crawford was one of Johnson's good friends, and sometimes 
in non-critical situations, Johnson would ease up so Crawford would hit 
well against him. This would vex Crawford's teammate Ty Cobb, who could 
not understand how Crawford could hit the great Johnson so well. Johnson 
was also friendly with Babe Ruth, despite Ruth's having hit some of his 
longest home runs off him at Griffith Stadium. In 1928, he began his career 
as a manager in the minor leagues, taking up residence at 32 Maple Terrace, 
Millburn, New Jersey, and managing the Newark Bears of the International 
League. He continued on to the major leagues, managing the Washington Nationals/Senators 
(1929–1932), and finally the Cleveland Indians (1933–1935). His managing 
record was 529–432, with his best team managed being in 1930, when the 
team finished 94—60, 8 games out of first place. In seven seasons, he had 
five winning seasons, with the only two losing seasons being at the beginning 
of his tenure with Washington and Cleveland, though his teams did not come 
close to winning the pennant, finishing 12 games behind in his last season. 
Johnson also served as a radio announcer on station WJSV for the Senators 
during the 1939 season.[16] Johnson was one of the first five players elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936. Johnson, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, 
Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner were known as the "Five Immortals" because they 
were the first players chosen for the Baseball Hall of Fame.[17] Walter 
Johnson retired to Germantown, Maryland. A lifelong Republican and friend 
of President Calvin Coolidge, Johnson was elected as a Montgomery County 
commissioner in 1938. His father-in-law was Rep. Edwin Roberts, a Republican 
member of the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1940 Johnson ran for a 
congressional seat in Maryland's 6th district, but came up short against 
the incumbent Democrat, William D. Byron, by a total of 60,037 (53%) to 
52,258 (47%).[18] Joseph W. Martin, Jr., before he was the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949 and 1953 to 1955, 
recruited Johnson to run for Congress. "He was an utterly inexperienced 
speaker", Martin later said. "I got some of my boys to write two master 
speeches for him – one for the farmers of his district and the other for 
the industrial areas. Alas, he got the two confused. He addressed the farmers 
on industrial problems, and the businessmen on farm problems."[19] At 11:40 pm, 
Tuesday, December 10, 1946[20] Johnson died of a brain tumor in Washington, 
D.C., five weeks after his 59th birthday, and was interred at Rockville 
Union Cemetery in Rockville, Maryland.[21][22] He was also called "Sir 
Walter", "the White Knight", and "The Gentle Johnson" because of his gentlemanly 
sportsmanship, and "Barney" after auto racer Barney Oldfield (he got out 
of a traffic ticket when a teammate in the car told the policeman Johnson 
was Barney Oldfield).[26] In 1999, The Sporting News ranked Johnson number 
4 on its list of Baseball's 100 Greatest Players, the highest-ranked pitcher.[27] 
Later that year, he was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team. In 1985 Jonathan Richman recorded the song "Walter Johnson", which 
dwelt on Johnson's personality and behaviour as an exemplar of what can 
be good in sport.[28] In 2015, he along with Nap Lajoie, Christy Mathewson 
and Cy Young were named the "Greatest Pioneers Group." They were voted 
for by baseball fans online as part of the Franchise Four competition and 
were "selected as the most impactful players". The results were announced 
at the 2015 MLB All-Star Game.[29] Johnson's gentle nature was legendary, 
and to this day he is held up as an example of good sportsmanship, while 
his name has become synonymous with friendly competition. This attribute 
worked to Johnson's disadvantage in the case of fellow Hall of Famer Ty 
Cobb. Virtually all batters were concerned about being hit by Johnson's 
fastball, and many would not "dig in" at the plate because of that concern. 
Cobb realized that the good-hearted Johnson was privately nervous about 
the possibility of seriously injuring a batter. Almost alone among his 
peers, Cobb would actually stand closer to the plate than usual when facing 
Johnson.[30] Career Statistics: Pitching Note that official MLB stats show 
3,508 career strikeouts, with 70 in his first (1907) season. Stats at the 
websites of Baseball Hall of Fame, ESPN, Baseball Reference and Baseball 
Cube (see "External Links", below) all show 3,509 career strikeouts, with 
71 in his first season. This has resulted in minor differences seen in 
references to Johnson's record when reading media and Wikipedia articles 
of other 3000 strikeout club pitchers. Hitting * Strikeouts not counted
