The Carolina League is a Minor League Baseball affiliation which operates 
along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. It is classified as a "Class 
A-Advanced" league. The organization that later became the Carolina League 
formed in 1945, just as World War II was ending, and consisted of only 
two teams based in southern Virginia. Historically, however, as many as 
12 teams in a given year have competed in the Carolina League. Today, the 
league consists of ten teams in a region stretching from Delaware to South 
Carolina, and is divided into a Northern Division and a Southern Division. 
The league originated in the vicinity of Raleigh, North Carolina, and has 
since branched out. A few of the many Carolina League players who have 
gone on to star in the Major Leagues are: Johnny Bench (Peninsula, 1966), 
Wade Boggs (Winston-Salem, 1977), Barry Bonds (Prince William, 1985), Rod 
Carew (Wilson, 1966), Dock Ellis (Kinston, 1965), Dwight Evans (Winston-Salem, 
1971), Dwight Gooden (Lynchburg, 1983), Zack Greinke (Wilmington, 2003), 
Andruw Jones (Durham, 1996), Chipper Jones (Durham, 1992), Willie McCovey 
(Danville, 1956), Joe Morgan (Durham, 1963), Dave Parker (Salem, 1972), 
Tony PÃ©rez (Rocky Mount, 1962), Andy Pettitte (Prince William, 1993), Jorge 
Posada (Prince William, 1993), Darryl Strawberry (Lynchburg, 1981), Bernie 
Williams (Prince William, 1988), and Carl Yastrzemski (Raleigh, 1959). 
Director and screenwriter Ron Shelton's 1988 film Bull Durham, starring 
Kevin Costner, Tim Robbins, and Susan Sarandon, depicted a fictionalized 
account of the Durham Bulls, at that time a Carolina League team (they 
have since become a Class AAA team in the International League). Before 
he began making films, Shelton had a five-year minor league career in the 
Baltimore Orioles' organization, which included a stint in the Carolina 
League. On August 22, 2016, it was announced that the Carolina League would 
add two expansion teams for the 2017 season to fill two vacant spots at 
the High-A level previously occupied by the California League's Bakersfield 
Blaze and High Desert Mavericks franchises, which ceased operations at 
the end of the 2016 season. One team has been confirmed for Kinston, North 
Carolina as an affiliate of the Texas Rangers and will be known as the 
Down East Wood Ducks. The second team is likely headed to Fayetteville, 
North Carolina, pending approval.[1] For league awards, go to the league
