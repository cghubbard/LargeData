The 2015 Chicago Cubs season was the 144th season for the franchise, the 
140th in the National League and the 100th at Wrigley Field. They began 
the season on April 5, 2015 in a first-ever night game home opener against 
the St. Louis Cardinals at partially renovated Wrigley Field, and finished 
on October 4, 2015 on the road against the Milwaukee Brewers. The Cubs 
finished the season with the third-best record in baseball (97–65) which 
was also the third-best in their division, finishing one game behind the 
Pittsburgh Pirates (98–64) and three games behind the division winner, 
the rival St. Louis Cardinals (100–62). As a result, they qualified for 
the second wild card spot for the 2015 postseason and defeated the Pirates 
in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game and faced the Cardinals in the 
Division Series. The Cubs defeated St. Louis in four games and advanced 
to play the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. It 
was the Cubs' first appearance in the NLCS since 2003. However, they were 
swept in four games and were unable to make it to their first World Series 
since 1945. In 2015, Forbes valued the Cubs at $1.8 billion, ranking them 
17th out of all sports franchises in the world, and the fifth highest in 
all MLB.[1] The Cubs attendance for the regular season was 2,959,812, up 
over 300,000 from the previous year.[2] On Monday, September 29, one day 
after the conclusion of the 2014 season, a $575 million four-year renovation 
project to Wrigley Field was begun. The bleachers in left and right field 
were expanded, the stadium was extended further onto both Waveland and 
Sheffield Avenues, and seven new outfield signs were installed along with 
a 5,700-square-foot jumbotron scoreboard in the left field bleachers and 
a 2,400 square foot video scoreboard in the right field bleachers. The 
parking lots along Clark Street were excavated for underground players' 
locker rooms and lounges.[3][4] The Cubs decided not to retain Mike Brumley 
as the assistant hitting coach. Bill Mueller, the hitting coach, resigned 
over the decision. On October 9. 2014 John Mallee, formerly the Astros 
hitting coach, was hired as his replacement. Eric Hinske was the assistant 
hitting coach and Doug Dascenzo was signed to replace him as first base/outfield 
coach.[15] In late October 2014, quality assurance coach Jose Castro resigned 
to work with Atlanta Braves hitting coach Kevin Seitzer.[16] On October 
31, the Cubs fired first year manager Rick Renteria.[17] On Monday, November 
3, The Cubs announced the signing of Joe Maddon to a five-year contract 
as manager of the team.[18] Former Cub Henry Blanco was hired to be the 
quality assurance coach on November 22.[19] At the start of the 2015 season, 
Brandon Hyde went from 2014 season bench coach to first base and Doug Dascenzo 
was the outfield coach. Dave Martinez was bench coach. On February 24, 
2015, Manny Ramirez was hired as a batting consultant, splitting time between 
Chicago and AAA Iowa.[20] Also, Kevin Youkilis was given a part-time job 
as a scouting and player development consultant. In June 2014, the Cubs 
announced an end to their radio play-by-play history on WGN (720-AM) radio 
which dated back to 1924. In a new partnership with CBS Radio, the radio 
broadcast of their games moved to WBBM (780-AM) for the 2015 season.[21] 
The Cubs finalized a new television broadcast agreement with long-time 
over-the-air carrier WGN-TV (Channel 9), in which the station will carry 
a reduced slate of 45 games per season. The team also signed a new broadcast 
agreement with ABC-owned station WLS-TV (Channel 7), in which they will 
show 25 games annually;[22] this deal replaced WCIU-TV as the Cubs' secondary 
over-the-air television outlet. Both agreements with WLS and WGN will run 
through the end of the 2019 season. Play-by-play announcer Len Kasper and 
color commentator Jim Deshaies will become employees of the Cubs rather 
than WGN-TV.[23] As a result of a new programming strategy implemented 
by Tribune Media for WGN America, the cable superstation will no longer 
televise Cubs games (as well as that of the Chicago White Sox and Bulls) 
to a national audience, as of January 2015. This marks the end of a 36-season 
run of Cubs games televised on the national version of WGN-TV. The Chicago 
Cubs have created affiliate stations to complement the 2015 television 
and radio schedule.[24] At the conclusion of the first month of the season 
the Cubs had a record of 12–8. It was their first winning April since the 
2008 season. They led the National League in stolen bases with 25, were 
third in on-base percentage with .329, and sixth in acquiring walks with 
71.[32] The pitching staff allowed the fewest walks in the National League 
with 41, they were third in WHIP with 1.15, fifth in striking out opposing 
batters with 181, sixth in opposing players batting average with .240, 
sixth in earned run average with 3.71 and allowed only 14 home runs against 
them.[33] During the month, the Cubs played in three extra-inning ballgames, 
winning all three.[34] At the end of the first two months of the season 
the Cubs had a record of 26–22. It was the first winning two-month period 
since the end of the 2008 season. They were third in the National League 
in stolen bases with 46 and second at receiving walks at 192. They did, 
however, lead the league in striking out at 541. The pitching staff allowed 
the second fewest walks in the National League with 140, they were third 
in WHIP, third in striking out opposing batters, sixth in opposing players 
batting average with .246, fifth in earned run average with 3.72, and allowed 
56 home runs against them.[38] Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches In
