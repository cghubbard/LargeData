Glenn Geffner, a Miami native, is a radio play-by-play announcer for the 
Miami Marlins. Geffner joined the Marlins radio broadcast team in 2008. 
Geffner partners with Dave Van Horne on the Marlins Radio Network. In addition 
to his play-by-duties, Glenn hosts the Marlins pre- and post-game shows. 
Geffner joined the Marlins after spending five seasons with the Boston 
Red Sox. In addition to calling more than 100 regular season games on radio 
for the 2007 World Champion Red Sox—plus the dramatic seven-game American 
League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians and the club’s 
World Series sweep of the Colorado Rockies—Geffner hosted the weekly “Red 
Sox Insider” talk show on 50,000-watt Red Sox Radio Network affiliate WTIC

New England Sports Network’s (NESN) package of Red Sox Minor League telecasts. 
He also served as a reporter and occasional host for the “Red Sox Report” 
television show, airing weekly throughout the year on NESN. Raised in South 
Florida, Geffner graduated from Miami Palmetto Senior High School and began 
his broadcasting career while a student at Northwestern University's Medill 
School of Journalism, calling Wildcats baseball, football and basketball. 
He was later the voice of the Rochester Red Wings, then the Triple-A International 
League affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, and made his Major League debut 
broadcasting games for the San Diego Padres during a six-season stay in 
San Diego (1997-2002), which he began as the club's Director of Public 
Relations. After filling in on both Padres radio and television broadcasts—and 
hosting daily Spring Training and weekly regular season “Padres Report” 
television shows for several seasons—he transitioned into a full-time broadcasting 
role with the Padres. In San Diego, Geffner partnered with Hall of Fame 
broadcaster Jerry Coleman before joining the Red Sox prior to the 2003
