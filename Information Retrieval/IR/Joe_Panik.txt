(MLB). He stands at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) and weighs 190 pounds (86 kg). 
Panik bats left and throws right.[1] Panik attended John Jay High School 
in Hopewell Junction, New York. He went to college at St. John's University, 
where he played college baseball for the St. John's Red Storm baseball 
team, playing in the Big East Conference. Panik compiled a .398 batting 
average with 19 doubles, 10 home runs and 57 runs batted in (RBI) during 
his junior season, ranking tenth among college baseball players with a 
.509 on-base percentage (OBP). Panik played the first game at Citi Field 
in a preseason game between St. John's University and Georgetown on March 
29, 2009. Panik earned All-America honors from the American Baseball Coaches 
Association (ABCA), Baseball America and Louisville Slugger. Panik was 
also a finalist for the Brooks Wallace Award, an honor given to the nation's 
top shortstop. He was also a first team ABCA All-Northeast Region honoree, 
a first team All-Big East selection, and the Red Storm Most Valuable Player.[2] 
Out of St. John's, the Giants drafted Panik in the first round (29th overall) 
of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft.[3] Panik made his professional 
debut with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Class A-Short Season Northwest 
League. He led the league with a .341 batting average, 49 runs scored, 
54 RBI and a .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for Salem-Keizer, winning the 
league's Most Valuable Player award.[4] He was rated the tenth best second 
base prospect prior to the 2012 season[5] and was invited to spring training.[4] 
Panik spent the 2012 season with the San Jose Giants of the Class A-Advanced 
California League, batting .297 with 27 doubles, seven home runs, and 76 
RBI in 130 games.[6] In 2013, Panik was promoted to the Richmond Flying 
Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League, where he was moved to second 
base and recorded a .333 on-base percentage and 27 doubles, four triples, 
four homers.[7] In 2014, Panik started the season with the Fresno Grizzlies 
of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he hit .321, with five home 
runs, 45 RBIs, and 50 runs scored in 74 games.[8] Panik made his MLB debut 
on June 21, 2014, pinch-hitting for the pitcher in the 8th inning and drawing 
a walk against Arizona Diamondbacks relief pitcher Matt Stites in a game 
the Giants won 6–4.[9] Panik's first Major League start came the next day, 
June 22, 2014, when he batted seventh and played second base. In his second 
at-bat in that game he registered his first MLB hit.[10] Panik hit his 
first home run on August 22, 2014 against Doug Fister of the Washington 
Nationals. It was a 3-run home run (one of Panik's 4 hits that night), 
which gave the Giants the lead in a game they eventually won 10–3.[11] 
On October 16, 2014, in the 2014 National League Championship Series, Panik 
hit a two-run home run in Game 5 to help lead the Giants to an eventual 
6–3 victory over the Cardinals to advance to the 2014 World Series against 
the Royals.[12] On October 29, 2014, in Game 7 of the World Series, the 
Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 3–2 to win the series. In the bottom 
of the third inning with a runner on first, Panik made a diving stop on 
a ball up the middle and flipped the ball with his glove to shortstop Brandon 
Crawford to get the lead runner out. Crawford then threw to first to try 
to get a sliding Eric Hosmer out. Initially, Hosmer was called safe on 
the play but after a three-minute replay review, the call was overturned 
for the 4–6–3 double play. It was the first ever overturned call in the 
World Series since the replay review system was implemented,[13] and the 
double play was regarded by multiple sportswriters as one of the most spectacular 
plays in World Series history.[14][15][16][17] In the 2014 regular season, 
Panik played in 73 games and recorded 269 at bats. He scored 31 runs and 
82 hits. He had 10 doubles and 2 triples along with one home run. Panik 
also recorded 18 runs batted. He was walked 16 times and struck out 33 
times. He did not steal any bases. He finished with a .305 average and 
an on base percentage of .343.[18] On April 5, Panik was named to the opening 
day 25-man roster.[19] On April 22, 2015, Panik hit a walk-off sacrifice 
fly in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers 
3–2.[20] Panik hit another walk-off nine days later on May 1, a pinch-hit, 
bases-loaded single against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[21] On May 
3, in a 5–0 win over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Panik batted second 
and homered off of Jered Weaver right after Nori Aoki homered to start 
the game. It was the first time the Giants started off a game with consecutive 
home runs since 1964.[22] On July 6, Panik was selected as a reserve player 
for the 2015 All Star Game.[23] On August 3, Panik was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list with lower back inflammation.[24] He returned for three games 
in September before he was shut down for the season.[25] For the 2015 season, 
Panik batted .312, with 8 home runs, 37 RBIs, and 59 runs scored.[26] After 
the season, Panik revealed that the "back inflammation" was actually a 
stress fracture of the L5 vertebra and that it had fully healed by December.[27] 
Panik and his fiancée, Brittany Pinto, have known each other since they 
were children.[28] He has participated in a baseball clinic hosted by Matt 
Barnes at the Newtown, Connecticut Youth Academy for elementary school 
students in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[29]
