Edward James "Doc" Stewart (January 26, 1877 – November 18, 1929) was an 
American football, basketball, and baseball player, coach, and college 
athletics administrator. He was also the founder, and player-coach of the 
Massillon Tigers professional football team. Stewart was the son of a Methodist 
minister and had played football and basketball at Mount Union College, 
located in Alliance, Ohio. He had attended medical school at Case Western 
Reserve University, located in Cleveland, where he played on the baseball 
team. In the early 1900s, Stewart organized a pro football team in Massillon, 
Ohio called the Massillon Tigers. Ed, a young and ambitious editor of the 
city newspaper The Evening Independent, was named as the team's first coach. 
At this time, Massillon was involved in a rivalry with the cross-county, 
Canton Bulldogs. Both teams spent lavish amounts of money to bring in ringers 
from out of town.[3] Prior to the 1906 season, a news story in The Plain 
Dealer alleged that the Bulldogs were financially broke and could not pay 
its players for that final game. Many Canton followers believed the story 
had originated in Massillon as a trick to discredit their team and make 
it tougher for Canton to recruit players for 1906. Since Stewart had newspaper 
connections, he was believed by Canton to have planted the story. The Tigers 
had won every "Ohio League" championship from 1902 to 1906. In 1906, Stewart 
was promoted from coach to the Tigers' manager. Sherburn Wightman, who 
was coached by Amos Alonzo Stagg, was named the team's new coach. In 1906, 
Stewart was a figure in a betting scandal between the two clubs. The Canton 
Bulldogs-Massillon Tigers Betting Scandal was the first major scandal in 
professional football. It was more notably the first known case of professional 
gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. It refers to an allegation 
made by a Massillon newspaper charging the Bulldogs' coach, Blondy Wallace, 
and Tigers end, Walter East, with conspiring to fix a two-game championship 
series between the two clubs. When the Tigers won the second and final 
game of the series and were named pro football's champions, Wallace was 
accused of throwing the game for Canton.[4] However, through the Massillon 
Independent, Stewart charged that an actual attempt was made to bribe some 
of the Tiger players and that Wallace had been involved. Stewart never 
stated that either the first or second Canton-Massillon game was fixed. 
Instead his accusation was that an attempt had been made to bribe some 
Massillion players before the first game. According to Stewart, Tiny Maxwell 
and Bob Shiring of Massillon had been solicited to throw the first game 
by East. Maxwell and Shiring then reported the offer to Wightman and the 
scandal ended before it began. East was then released by the Tigers. Only 
then was Wallace named by Stewart of being East's accomplice. The scandal 
was said to have ruined professional football in Ohio until the mid 1910s. 
However, some others argue that the expense of placing all-star teams on 
the field each week also put a damper on the sport. The Canton Morning 
News put a $20,000 price tag on the Massillon Tigers 1906 team, while many 
speculate that the Bulldogs roster probably cost even more. Stiil others 
contend that the games involving top teams such as Canton and Massilon 
were too one-sided and lacked excitement. Many towns in Ohio still fielded 
clubs over the next several years, however these new pros consisted more 
of sandlotters, with only the occasional ringer. A second incarnation of 
the Bulldogs would be established in 1911 and would later go on to win 
two championships in the National Football League.[5] Stewart's first collegiate 
head coaching position was as the head football coach at Mount Union College. 
He coached one season there and posted a 9–2 record.[6] Stewart was also 
the head coach of the Mount Union men's basketball team for one season. 
He coached the team for one season posting a record of 18–3 in the 1907–08 
season.[7] In 1909, Stewart was hired as the head men's basketball coach 
at Purdue University just days before the season began. He led the team 
to a record of 8–4, their first winning season in four years.[8] From 1911 
to 1916, Stewart was the head coach of the men's basketball team at Oregon 
State, then known as Oregon Agricultural College. In his five seasons as 
the head basketball coach at OAC, Stewart posted a record of 67–33.[9] 
While at Oregon State, he also coached the Oregon State Beavers baseball 
team during the 1912 season. He coached the team to a 5–9 record.[10] Pulling 
the triple threat for Oregon State, Stewart also coached the Oregon State 
Beavers football team from 1913 to 1915. In football he compiled a 15–5–5 
record.[11] From 1916 to 1917, Stewart was the head coach of the University 
of Nebraska football team. In his two seasons at the helm, he led the team 
to the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association title each 
year and posted an 11–4 record overall.[6] After the conclusion of the 
1917 football season, Stewart took over as head basketball coach and remained 
in that capacity from 1917 to 1919. He coached the Cornhuskers to a 17–14 
record over those two seasons.[12] In the spring of 1921, Stewart became 
the head baseball coach at Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina. 
That spring was a busy one for Stewart as he also coached the track and 
field team and ran spring practice for football, all while coaching the 
baseball team. He coached the baseball team for just the 1921 season and 
the track program from 1921 to 1923.[13] In the fall of 1921, Stewart coached 
his first season of football at Clemson. He remained there for two seasons, 
the 1921 and 1922 seasons, and compiled a 6–10–2 record.[6] As soon as 
the football season of 1921 ended, Stewart jumped into his 4th head coaching 
role at Clemson at coached the basketball team. He coached the basketball 
from 1921 to 1923. In his two seasons at the helm, he led Clemson to a 
19–19 record.[13] University of Texas Athletic Director L. Theo Bellmont 
hired Stewart from Clemson to lead both the Longhorn football and basketball 
programs in 1923. A medical school graduate, a piano enthusiast, a former 
sportswriter, a one-time automobile dealership owner, and a veteran coach, 
E.J. Stewart quickly became a popular figure across diverse segments of 
the University population. His oratory eloquence landed him an open job 
offer from the head of the UT English Department, should he ever decide 
to quit coaching and desire other work. Some have speculated that Stewart's 
devotion to his varied non-athletic interests was the root cause of his 
football and basketball teams' decline in performance over his tenure.[14] 
He led the Longhorn football team to an 8–0–1 record during the 1923 season; 
his following teams finished with records of 5–3–1, 6–2–1, and 5–4.[6] 
Stewart led the Longhorn basketball team to a perfect 23–0 mark and a Southwest 
Conference championship during the 1923–24 season, but his subsequent teams 
finished 17–8, 12–10, and 13–9.[15] This decline in his teams' performance 
resulted in the popular Stewart's controversial dismissal following the 
1926–27 season. He ended his career at University of Texas at El Paso where 
he compiled a 5–6–3 record.[6] On November 18, 1929, Stewart was shot and 
killed by a deer-hunting companion.[16] He was interred at Lakeview Cemetery 
in Cleveland. Pound sign (#) denotes interim head coach. Pound sign (#)
