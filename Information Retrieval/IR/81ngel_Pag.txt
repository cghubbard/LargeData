Ángel Manuel Pagán[1] (born July 2, 1981) is a Puerto Rican professional 
baseball left fielder who is a free agent. Raised in Río Piedras, Puerto 
Rico, he began playing baseball at age six. Pagán's original contract in 
Major League Baseball (MLB) was with the New York Mets, but he was transferred 
to the Chicago Cubs when they bought his contract. Pagán was subsequently 
traded back to the Mets prior to the 2008 season. On December 5, 2011, 
he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for Andrés Torres and Ramón Ramírez. 
Pagán was given the nickname "El Caballo Loco" (Spanish for "Crazy Horse") 
by his Mets teammates.[2] While primarily a center fielder throughout his 
career, Pagan has since transitioned to left field in 2016. Ángel Manuel 
Pagán was born and raised in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. His mother, Gloria, 
was a fan of baseball and played in a men's fastpitch softball league.[3] 
The family lived in a crowded apartment with his brother and sister, and 
the energetic Pagán did not have space to run. His mother hoped to direct 
Pagán's high level of energy into a constructive outlet, and encouraged 
the child to play the sport.[3] He joined a tee ball team at age six, and 
continued playing throughout childhood. Baseball helped him avoid the dangers 
of his neighborhood; he recalls, "It was tough to come out of that place 
a good person. Selling drugs or something. It was a bad neighborhood. A 
lot of my friends couldn't survive that world. But [my mother] made me 
strong enough to forget about that path and go to the positive one."[3] 
He also developed interests in basketball and boxing, "But there was something 
about baseball", he said. "I fell in love with the sport."[3] The Mets 
showed early interest, making him their 4th round pick in the 1999 Amateur 
draft. After failing to come to terms, Pagan played ball at Indian River 
State College in Florida, eventually coming to terms with the Mets the 
day before they would have lost signing rights. He spent 5 seasons in the 
Mets farm system before the Chicago Cubs acquired him.[4] On January 25, 
2006, the Cubs purchased Pagán's contract from the Mets. Pagán made his 
major league debut with the Cubs on April 3, 2006, but was injured early 
in the season and missed two and a half months. On July 2, 2006, his 25th 
birthday, Pagán hit his first and second career home runs in a game against 
the crosstown rival Chicago White Sox. Pagán was the first person in Major 
League history to hit his first two career home runs on his birthday. (The 
second person was Stephen Cardullo in 2016.)[5] Pagán returned in May 2007, 
being recalled in place of Matt Murton, who had struggled somewhat and 
was not getting regular at-bats. Pagán then became a regular outfielder 
and enjoyed modest success until his season was cut short due to a bout 
with colitis. On June 2, 2007, Pagán was called out at third base trying 
to move up after a wild pitch, which led to Lou Piniella's most infamous 
meltdown. Pagán had lost a considerable amount of weight and strength due 
to illness. Chicago general manager Jim Hendry was afraid Pagán would not 
be ready to start the 2008 season on time, thus prompting the trade to 
New York. On January 5, 2008, Pagán returned to the Mets in a trade for 
two minor-league players. He began the year as the starting left fielder 
for the Mets because Moisés Alou was injured and on the disabled list.[6] 
When Alou returned from the DL in May, he took over the starting job in 
left field from Pagán. On May 7, 2008, Pagán made a spectacular catch in 
foul territory, falling into the stands, in Los Angeles against the Dodgers 
while playing left field. Although he originally stayed in the game, Pagán 
was later removed with left shoulder pain. The injury eventually caused 
Pagán to be placed on the disabled list. Pagán was undergoing rehabilitation 
in the GCL and was expected to be on the active roster after the All-Star 
break. However, he left a rehab start with the Brooklyn Cyclones feeling 
pain when batting from the right side. Pagán had season-ending surgery 
on his shoulder on July 29, 2008.[7] On June 1, 2009, Pagán was placed 
on the 15-Day DL with a right groin strain. The next day, the Mets activated 
2B Alex Cora to fill Pagán's spot on the roster. On August 1, 2009, Pagán 
hit a grand slam for his first home run since mid-2007 and first for the 
New York Mets, leading to the win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. On August 
5, 2009, he went 3-for-4 against the Cardinals, with a home run, triple, 
and single, missing the cycle by just a double. On August 23, 2009, he 
hit 2 home runs (one of which was inside the park) against Pedro Martínez 
and the Philadelphia Phillies. On October 4, 2009, Pagán went four-for-four 
against the Houston Astros, falling a home run shy of a cycle. Pagán was 
not the 2010 Opening Day center fielder (the nod went to newly acquired 
Gary Matthews, Jr.), despite making a strong case in 2009. Due to Matthew's 
poor performance, Pagán shortly found himself back in the starting lineup 
and quickly established himself as a quality everyday player. On May 19, 
2010, Pagán started a triple play from center field in the 5th inning against 
the Washington Nationals on a ball hit by Cristian Guzmán. After catching 
the bloop hit, his momentum carried him right into the infield and he threw 
the ball in. Since the baserunners each advanced a base, had Pagan opted 
to run the ball in himself, he could have recorded an unassisted triple 
play and would have been the first ever outfielder to do so. He hit an 
inside-the-park home run in the same game, the first in Nationals Park 
history. On June 22. 2010, Pagán fell one home run short of a cycle. With 
the return of Carlos Beltrán as the starting center fielder on July 15, 
2010, Pagán became the starting right fielder for the Mets, replacing Jeff 
Francoeur. He finished the year batting .290, with 11 home runs and 69 
RBI. He had 168 base hits in 579 at bats on the season. He hit 31 doubles, 
7 triples and stole 37 bases. His first career hit by a pitch came on September 
4, 2010, against the Chicago Cubs. All facets of Pagán's game improved 
in 2010, most notably his ability to make smart decisions while running 
the bases. With the uncertainty of Beltran's health as well as his range, 
the speedy Pagán was inserted into the starting center fielder position 
for the 2011 season. Beltran was moved over to right field by manager Terry 
Collins. He was placed on the DL on April 21, 2011, due to a rib injury. 
On May 27, 2011, he came back from the DL as the club sent down Fernando 
Martínez and DFA'd Pat Misch and they brought up Dale Thayer. For the season, 
on defense he led all major league center fielders in errors, with 10, 
and had the lowest fielding percentage, at .968. On July 20, Pagán hit 
a 10th-inning walk-off home run off the railing of the second deck (named 
the Pepsi Porch in Citi Field) against closer Fernando Salas to help the 
Mets win 6-5 over the St. Louis Cardinals. On December 7, 2011, he was 
traded to the San Francisco Giants for Andrés Torres and Ramón Ramírez.[8] 
On January 16, 2012, Pagán signed a one-year deal with the San Francisco 
Giants worth $4.85 million to avoid his final year of arbitration. His 
deal included incentives of an additional $50,000 for 550, 600 and 650 
plate appearances. With 659 plate appearances in 2012, Pagán earned a salary 
of $5 million that year.[9] Pagán holds the Giants record for a home hitting 
streak at 28 games.[10] This breaks Mike Donlin's record of 26 consecutive 
home games with at least one hit from 1905–1906, back when the team was 
in New York. On September 15, 2012, Pagán broke the San Francisco Giants 
record for the most triples in a season, with 13. He finished the regular 
season with 15 triples,[10] which led the National League in triples. Pagan 
finished 32nd in NL MVP voting; his teammate Buster Posey won it. In 2012, 
Pagán was vital to the Giants reaching the 2012 World Series and was the 
lead-off hitter for the Giants throughout most of the postseason. On December 
3, Pagán signed a 4-year $40 million contract with San Francisco, pending 
a physical examination.[11] The contract became official on December 7, 
2012.[12] On May 25, with the Giants trailing 5-4 in the bottom of the 
tenth inning versus the Colorado Rockies, Pagán hit a walk-off inside-the-park 
home run off of reliever Rafael Betancourt.[13] It was the third inside-the-park 
home run of Pagán's career. However, Pagán injured his left hamstring during 
the game and was placed on the 15-day disabled list, effective May 28.[14] 
On June 20, Pagán re-injured his left hamstring while on rehab assignment 
with the Class-A Advanced San Jose Giants against the Stockton Ports.[15] 
On June 25, he underwent surgery to repair a torn tendon in his left hamstring, 
and he did not join the Giants again until August 30, missing 82 games.[16] 
Pagán finished the season batting .282/.334/.414 in 71 games with 5 home 
runs and 30 RBIs. Pagán hit .300/.342/.389 in 96 games for the Giants in 
2014. He missed 44 games from June 15 to August 7 with back inflammation. 
On September 25, Pagán underwent season-ending surgery to repair a bulging 
disk and inflamed nerve in his back. While on the disabled list the Giants 
won the World Series. [17] In 2015, Pagán hit .262/.303/.332 with 27 extra-base 
hits in 133 games, notching a career-low .635 OPS.[18] Dealing with knee 
problems all season, Pagán was placed on the disabled list in August with 
right patella tendinitis.[19] After the season, Pagán underwent arthroscopic 
surgery on his right knee.[20] After three injury-riddled seasons and advanced 
metrics that suggested worsening defense, the Giants moved Pagan to left 
field to make way for Denard Span.[21] Pagan had not played left field 
since 2010, but accepted the transition, leading the team in batting average 
at .315 in April. A strained left hamstring kept Pagan out for thirty games, 
but he recovered by batting .350 for the month of June. He would go hitless 
in his first 10 July at-bats before his fourth home run of the season on 
Independence Day, already topping his totals from each of the past two 
seasons. Pagán was part of the Puerto Rico national baseball team during 
the 2013 World Baseball Classic. He led the team to the Finals, where they 
lost against Dominican Republic. Pagán finished the tournament with a batting 
average of .364 (12-33) to lead his team.[22] Pagán has a wife, Windy, 
and two daughters: Briana and Suil Angelina.[23][24] On May 7, 2009, Pagán 
was arrested in Port St. Lucie, Florida for traffic violations. It was 
reported that Pagán, who was driving with a suspended license, was originally 
stopped for speeding, but after a license check, troopers learned Pagán 
has several warrants out for his arrest for failure to pay traffic fines.[25]
