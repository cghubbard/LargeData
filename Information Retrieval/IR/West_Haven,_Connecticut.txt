West Haven is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. At 
the 2010 census, the population of the city was 55,564.[1] Settled in 1648, 
West Haven (then known as West Farms) was a part of the original New Haven 
Colony. In 1719, it became the separate parish of West Haven, but was still 
officially a part of New Haven until 1822. During the American Revolution, 
West Haven was the frequent launch and arrival point for raiding parties 
on both sides of the war. On July 5, 1779, the British invaded New Haven 
Harbor and came ashore in West Haven and East Haven. Thomas Painter, a 
teenaged militiaman watching for the approaching British ships while standing 
atop Savin Rock, is depicted on the city seal. The main commercial street, 
Campbell Avenue, is named for British Adjutant William Campbell, at the 
time an ensign in the Third Guards, who rescued the Reverend Noah Williston, 
the local Congregational minister and outspoken revolutionary, from being 
bayoneted by British and Hessian troopers, after he broke his leg trying 
to escape his captors. Campbell then ordered the soldiers to help the minister 
back to the parsonage and had the regimental surgeon set his leg. Campbell 
is also credited with keeping the troops in reasonably good order during 
their march through the village and reportedly had two soldiers arrested 
after a local woman accused them of stealing her jewelry. Campbell was 
killed hours later atop Allingtown Hill on his way to New Haven by a local 
farmer-turned defender. Campbell is buried in the Allingtown section of 
town off Prudden Street. Patriot victims of the invasion are buried in 
the Christ Church and First Society Cemetery. A historical headstone marks 
Campbell's approximate gravesite and is maintained by the West Haven Historical 
Society. While West Haven again attempted to incorporate as its own town 
in 1784, that attempt failed, primarily due to the protests of neighboring 
Milford, which opposed North Milford becoming part of the new town. West 
Haven and North Milford tried again in 1786 and 1787 with the same result. 
The two finally joined to become Orange (incorporated as a town in 1822). 
In 1921, West Haven split from Orange to become a separate town. It was 
incorporated as a city in 1961 and is known as "Connecticut's Youngest 
City",[2] but it is ironically one of the state's oldest settlements. The 
Savin Rock section of West Haven was the site of the Savin Rock Amusement 
Park, which began in the late 19th century as a regionally renowned seaside 
resort. It evolved into a general amusement park in the 20th century and 
eventually closed in the 1960s. The park ran along the west side of the 
New Haven Harbor beachfront and is today a walk and bike path. Several 
restaurants remain as last reminders of the area including Jimmies, Turk's 
of Savin Rock, both for their seafood and split hot dogs and Mike's Apizza 
& Restaurant. West Haven has a mayor-council form of government. Edward 
M. O’Brien, the city's eleventh mayor, was elected in 2013. There are three 
independent fire districts served by the First Fire Taxation (Center), 
West Shore and Allingtown Fire Districts. Over the years there have been 
unsuccessful efforts made to consolidate the fire districts, each of which 
levies its own tax rate. In 1986, West Haven observed the Bicentennial 
of the United States Constitution. During the year-long celebrations, the 
mayor and council passed numerous resolutions to encourage community involvement, 
including naming the official ship of West Haven—the U.S. Navy destroyer 
USS Edson (DD-946)—and the city's official flower, the daylily. Public 
schools included curriculum on the Constitution from K-12, and school children 
were released from class to participate in a Constitution Day parade up 
Campbell Avenue.[citation needed] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 11.0 square miles (28.5 km²), of which 10.8 square 
miles (28.1 km²) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.4 km²), or 1.54%, is water. 
West Haven has 3.5 miles (5.6 km) of publicly accessible beaches, which 
is one-quarter of the publicly accessible beaches in Connecticut. The hilly 
Allingtown district of the city is home to the University of New Haven. 
West Haven is located in the south-central portion of Connecticut's 3rd 
congressional district. The city is bound on the southwest by the Oyster 
River (the boundary between West Haven and Milford since colonial times), 
northwest by Orange, north by New Haven and northeast by the West River, 
which divides West Haven and New Haven. To the east is New Haven Harbor 
and to the south is Long Island Sound. The three significant neighborhoods 
in West Haven correspond to the three fire districts. As communities, not 
all sections of the city fit neatly into these divisions. For example, 
the southeast corner, while part of the Center aka First Fire Taxation 
District, is not contiguous to the central business district. As of the 
census[5] of 2000, there were 52,360 people, 21,090 households, and 13,117 
families residing in the city. The population density was 4,832.0 people 
per square mile (1,865.0/km²). There were 22,336 housing units at an average

living together, 15.6% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 37.8% were non-families. 31.0% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 10.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 3.06. In 
the city the population was spread out with 23.1% under the age of 18, 
9.7% from 18 to 24, 31.2% from 25 to 44, 21.8% from 45 to 64, and 14.2%

the city was $21,121. About 6.6% of families and 8.8% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 11.8% of those under age 18 and 
6.0% of those age 65 or over. West Haven was a shipping and industrial 
center, known for its buckle shops and, later, Armstrong Rubber Co. The 
Armstrong Rubber factory now sits empty, except for a few small businesses 
renting space within. Coleco (originally Connecticut Leather Company- later 
the toy/video game manufacturer), and Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of 
United Technologies, also had operations in West Haven. Bayer Pharmaceuticals 
North America, a branch of Bayer AG, based in Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, 
Germany, had a plant in West Haven, but the company announced in 2006 that 
it was shutting its operations in the city, affecting about 1,000 workers. 
The 137-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer campus comprises 17 buildings, mostly 
in West Haven but partly in Orange. In 2007, Yale University purchased 
the entire campus for biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other life sciences 
research.[6] During the early 2000s, Walmart established a store in West 
Haven. Long a blue-collar and middle-class bedroom community of New Haven, 
West Haven has had financial problems since the 1990s. West Haven is home 
to the University of New Haven, a U.S. Veterans Affairs hospital, and Yale 
Field, a baseball park for the Yale University teams and formerly the home 
field for minor league baseball teams. The Yale Bowl, the home field of 
the Yale Bulldogs, is in New Haven, near the West Haven border. The West 
Haven High School football team was ranked first in the state and fifth 
in the nation in 1968. West Haven is also home to Notre Dame High School, 
which is a Roman Catholic all-boys school. Interstate 95, Route 34 (also 
known as Derby Avenue), and U.S. Route 1 (the Boston Post Road) run through 
West Haven, between Orange and New Haven. Route 162, which both begins 
and ends at Route 1, starts in Orange, passes through West Haven, and ends 
in Milford. A north-south state road, Route 122, begins in New Haven, comprising 
Forest Road, a stretch of Campbell Avenue and First Avenue up to the junction 
with I-95. Route 745 begins at that point, turns west at Elm Street and 
continues into New Haven, ending at Route 10 (Ella T. Grasso Boulevard). 
Public transportation is provided by Connecticut Transit New Haven bus 
service. West Haven Center is served by the various B routes (main service 
along Campbell Avenue). The B4 service continues to Saw Mill Road and Bull 
Hill Lane; the B5/B6 services run along Jones Hill Road and terminate at 
the Baybrook Shopping Center near Oyster River; the B7 service continues 
to Savin Rock via Second Avenue. The J routes run along the West Haven 
shore towards Milford. The O route serves the areas along Route 1. The 
M route serves the Veterans Affairs Hospital. A rail line, used by Metro-North 
Railroad and Amtrak, runs through West Haven. In 2010, the Connecticut 
Department of Transportation began building a new Metro-North station in 
West Haven, across from the former Armstrong factory. It was opened August 
18, 2013.[7] Tweed New Haven Regional Airport is the closest facility offering
