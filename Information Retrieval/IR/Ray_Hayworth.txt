Raymond Hall Hayworth (January 29, 1904 â€“ September 25, 2002) was a catcher 
in Major League Baseball. From 1926 through 1945, Hayworth played for the 
Detroit Tigers, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants and St. Louis Browns. 
He batted and threw right-handed. A native of High Point, North Carolina, 
Ray Hayworth was a solid defensive catcher but a modest hitter. Hayworth, 
who worked in baseball for more than 50 years, spent 15 seasons in the 
majors, almost all of it with the Detroit Tigers. He played with Ty Cobb 
in 1926, Hayworth's rookie season, and Cobb's final season in Detroit. 
Hayworth was a member of two World Series teams with Detroit in 1934 and 
1935. He set an American League record for most consecutive chances by 
a catcher without an error at 439, from September 2, 1931 to August 29, 
1932, and his glove is exhibited in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The record 
was later broken by Hall of Famer Yogi Berra. Hayworth also had two stints 
with the Brooklyn Dodgers and played briefly for the New York Giants and 
St. Louis Browns. He posted a .265 career batting average with five home 
runs and 238 RBI in 699 games played. Following his playing career, Hayworth 
worked for several teams, including the Chicago Cubs, the Milwaukee and 
Atlanta Braves and the Montreal Expos. Hayworth retired from baseball in 
1973. After that, he threw out the ceremonial first ball in the last game 
played at Tiger Stadium on September 27, 1999. Hayworth died in Salisbury, 
North Carolina, at age of 98. At the time of his death, he was the oldest 
surviving major league player.[1] His younger brother, Red Hayworth, also 
was a major league catcher, and his grandson, J. D. Hayworth, was a Republican 
Party member of the United States House of Representatives from Arizona
