Darrel Lee Chaney (born March 9, 1948, in Hammond, Indiana) is an American 
former player/announcer in Major League Baseball who played for the Cincinnati 
Reds and Atlanta Braves from 1969 to 1979. In the early 1980s he worked 
for the Braves as an announcer along with Ernie Johnson, Skip Caray and 
Pete van Wieren. He was on the Atlanta Braves Radio Network as well as 
WTBS-TV. Chaney was a graduate of Morton High School in Hammond, Indiana, 
where he was a three-sport athlete and an All-American football player 
and was named the Northwest Indiana Times Athlete of the Year in 1966.[1][2] 
His wife Cindy is also from Hammond and is a graduate of George Rogers 
Clark High School.[1] He had several football scholarship offers from Big 
Ten schools but signed with Ball State University because there he could 
play both football and baseball. However, he was selected by the Reds in 
the second round of the 1966 draft and signed for a $6,000 bonus.[3] Although 
a light-hitting infielder in the minor leagues, he broke through and led 
the Southern League with 23 home runs in 1968, earning him a spot on the 
Reds' roster in 1969, when he shared the shortstop position with Woody 
Woodward and Chico Ruiz. Chaney continued with the Reds in the 1970s but 
after the emergence of Dave Concepci√≥n was primarily a reserve. He played 
in three World Series for the Reds' "Big Red Machine" teams, in 1970 and 
1972 and on the World Series-winning team of 1975.[4] Chaney was traded 
to Atlanta after the 1975 season and in 1976 batted .252 with one home 
run and 50 RBI as the Braves' regular shortstop. Over the next three seasons, 
however, he was unable to hold the job against competition from two other 
players, and was released at the end of the 1979 season. In 915 career 
games, Chaney hit for a .217 batting average, with 14 home runs, 190 runs 
batted in, 237 runs scored, 458 hits, 75 doubles, 17 triples and 19 stolen 
bases. Chaney is a past Chairman of the Board of the Major League Alumni 
Marketing (MLAM) and a Sr. Vice President of Sales and Marketing at a retail 
services organization.[5] He is a Christian and a motivational speaker; 
Dan Hettinger has written a biography of Chaney entitled Welcome to the 
Big Leagues . . . Every Man's Journey to Significance.[6] He lives in Sautee
