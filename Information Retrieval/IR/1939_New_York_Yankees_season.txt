The 1939 New York Yankees season was the team's 37th season in New York, 
and its 39th overall. The team finished with a record of 106–45, winning 
their 11th pennant, finishing 17 games ahead of the Boston Red Sox. New 
York was managed by Joe McCarthy. The Yankees played their home games at 
Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they beat the Cincinnati Reds in 4 
games. This marked the first time any team had won four consecutive World 
Series. The 1939 New York Yankees are one of only three teams (the 1927 
and 1998 Yankees being the others) to ever finish the regular season with 
over a .700 winning percentage, lead the league in runs scored and fewest 
runs allowed, and go on to sweep the World Series. The 1939 Yankees are 
the only team to ever outscore their regular season opponents by over 400 
runs (967–556). On June 21, the New York Yankees announced first baseman 
Lou Gehrig's retirement and proclaimed July 4, 1939, "Lou Gehrig Appreciation 
Day" at Yankee Stadium. Between games of the Independence Day doubleheader 
against the Washington Senators, the poignant ceremonies were held on the 
diamond. In its coverage the following day, The New York Times said it 
was "Perhaps as colorful and dramatic a pageant as ever was enacted on 
a baseball field [as] 61,808 fans thundered a hail and farewell".[1] Dignitaries 
extolled the dying slugger and the members of the 1927 Yankees World Championship 
team, known as "Murderer's Row", attended the ceremonies. New York Mayor 
Fiorello La Guardia called Gehrig "the greatest prototype of good sportsmanship 
and citizenship" and Postmaster General James Farley concluded his speech 
by predicting, "For generations to come, boys who play baseball will point 
with pride to your record."[1] Yankees manager Joe McCarthy, struggling 
to control his emotions, then spoke of Lou Gehrig, with whom there was 
a close, almost father and son-like bond. After describing Gehrig as "the 
finest example of a ballplayer, sportsman, and citizen that baseball has 
ever known", McCarthy could stand it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, 
the manager said, "Lou, what else can I say except that it was a sad day 
in the life of everybody who knew you when you came into my hotel room 
that day in Detroit and told me you were quitting as a ballplayer because 
you felt yourself a hindrance to the team. My God, man, you were never 
that." The Yankees retired Gehrig's uniform number "4", making him the 
first player in history to be afforded that honor. Gehrig was given many 
gifts, commemorative plaques, and trophies. Some came from VIPs; others 
came from the stadium's groundskeepers and janitorial staff. Footage of 
the ceremonies shows Gehrig being handed various gifts, and immediately 
setting them down on the ground, because he no longer had the arm strength 
to hold them. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note:
