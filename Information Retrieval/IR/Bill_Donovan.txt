As Player As Manager William Edward Donovan (October 13, 1876 – December 
9, 1923), nicknamed Wild Bill, was an American right-handed pitcher and 
manager in Major League Baseball. He played eighteen seasons with the Washington 
Senators (1898), Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1902), Detroit Tigers (1903–12; 
1918), and New York Yankees (1915–16). Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, 
Donovan won his "Wild Bill" nickname while playing for Hartford in the 
minors. When Hartford teammate Cy Seymour was returned to the Major Leagues 
after throwing wildly over a fence behind home plate, Donovan walked nine 
consecutive batters. Donovan received a $10 fine and a new nickname.[1] 
Donovan served as the head football coach at Georgetown University in 1898, 
leading the Hoyas to a record of 7–3.[2] Donovan made his major league 
debut on April 22, 1898. During his first three seasons, he was a seldom 
used reliever on Superbas teams that won consecutive National League pennants, 
in 1899 and 1900. With the departure of pitchers Joe McGinnity and Gus 
Weyhing from the team after the 1900 season, Donovan became a starting 
pitcher of 38 games, posting a 25–15 won–loss record with a 2.77 earned 
run average (ERA) in 351 innings. Donovan moved to the American League's 
Detroit Tigers in 1903, where he would continue his pitching success alongside 
teammates George Mullin, Sam Crawford, and later Ty Cobb. In the 1907 season, 
the team won the American League pennant behind Donovan's league-leading 
winning percentage of .862, in which he went 25–4, a mark that remains 
the highest single-season winning percentage in Tigers history.[citation

ERA. Donovan also became the first pitcher to lose consecutive deciding 
games in the World Series in 1908–09.[citation needed] On May 7, 1906, 
Donovan accomplished a rare feat even for the best base stealers. He stole 
second base, third, and on the front end of a double steal, took home in 
the fifth inning of an 8–3 victory over Cleveland. He also hit a triple 
in the same game.[3] An arm injury ended Donovan's career in 1912.[4] Donovan 
was player–manager for the Yankees from 1915 to 1917 and a coach for the 
Tigers in 1918. He made several spot appearances for the Yankees and Tigers, 
including one final start on the last day of the 1918 season, which he 
won.[5] He later served as manager of the Philadelphia Phillies for part 
of the 1921 season, being replaced after 44 games by Kaiser Wilhelm. Donovan 
was accused of having some knowledge of the attempt to throw the 1919 World 
Series but was vindicated by commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and received 
an apology from his accuser, William Baker, president of the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[1] In December 1923, while traveling on the 20th Century Limited 
train to Chicago for Major League meetings, Donovan, the New Haven manager, 
died when the train wrecked in Forsyth, New York.[6] New Haven president 
George Weiss had swapped berths with Donovan and escaped with a minor injury. 
Phillies owner William F. Baker (the man who accused him of wrongdoing 
in the Black Sox scandal) was also on the train, but he was unhurt.[3] 
In 378 career games, Donovan had a 186–139 won–loss total and threw 2964⅔
