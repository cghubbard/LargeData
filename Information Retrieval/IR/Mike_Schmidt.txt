Michael Jack Schmidt (born September 27, 1949) is an American former professional 
baseball third baseman who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Philadelphia Phillies. Schmidt was a twelve-time All-Star and a 
three-time winner of the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player award 
(MVP), and he was known for his combination of power hitting and strong 
defense: as a hitter, he compiled 548 home runs and 1,595 runs batted in 
(RBIs), and led the NL in home runs eight times and in RBIs four times. 
As a fielder, Schmidt won the National League Gold Glove Award for third 
basemen ten times. Schmidt was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1995 and is often considered the greatest third baseman in baseball history.[1][2] 
Having an unusual batting stance, Schmidt turned his back somewhat towards 
the pitcher and rocked his rear end back-and-forth while waiting for a 
pitch. By standing far back in the batter's box, he made it almost impossible 
to jam him by pitching inside. Schmidt was one of the best athletes of 
his era; teammate Pete Rose once said, "To have his body, I'd trade him 
mine and my wife's, and I'd throw in some cash."[3] Upon graduation from 
Fairview High School in Dayton, Ohio in 1967, Schmidt attended Ohio University 
in Athens, where he joined Beta Theta Pi fraternity.[4] He led the Ohio 
Bobcats baseball team to the College World Series in 1970,[5] and was selected 
as the shortstop for the 1970 College Baseball All-America Team. Schmidt 
was drafted by the Phillies in the second round (30th overall) of the 1971 
Major League Baseball draft. On June 11, 1971, Schmidt was signed by Phillies 
scout Tony Lucadello, who had followed him since he played Little League 
Baseball.[6] Six days later, Schmidt made his professional debut in an 
exhibition game between the Phillies and their Double-A affiliate the Reading 
Phillies in Reading, Pennsylvania. Schmidt played the whole game at shortstop 
for the big-league Phillies, hitting a game-winning home run against his 
future Reading teammates.[7] Schmidt stayed in Reading, spending the rest 
of the 1971 season at the Double-A level. In 1972, he was promoted to the 
Triple-A Eugene Emeralds of the Pacific Coast League. Along with shortstop 
and third base, Schmidt also played second base during his time in the 
minor leagues. Schmidt spent two seasons in the Phillies' farm system, 
where he batted .263 with 34 home runs and 122 runs batted in. After playing 
most of the 1972 season for Triple-A Eugene, he was called up to the Phillies 
in September, and made his major league debut against the New York Mets 
on September 12.[8] Four days later, in Philadelphia on September 16, Schmidt 
ended Montreal Expos pitcher Balor Moore's streak of 25 scoreless innings 
pitched with his first career home run.[9] Following the 1972 season, the 
Phillies dealt third baseman Don Money to the Milwaukee Brewers to open 
a spot for Schmidt in their infield. While he batted only .196 with 136 
strikeouts during his first full season in 1973, Schmidt demonstrated his 
power potential by hitting 18 home runs. The next year, 1974, Schmidt's 
batting average climbed to .282 and he received the first of his twelve 
All-Star nods.[10] On June 10, in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, Schmidt 
hit a ball off of Houston Astros' pitcher Claude Osteen that looked like 
a sure home run. The ball hit a public address speaker suspended 117 feet 
above and 329 feet away from home plate, falling into centerfield. By the 
ground rules, it remained in play and Schmidt was held to just a single, 
with the runners on first and second each advancing just one base. It is 
believed that had the ball not hit the speaker, it would have traveled 
beyond 500 feet.[11] For the season, Schmidt finished sixth in National 
League Most Valuable Player balloting as he batted .282 with 116 RBIs and 
a league-leading 36 home runs to help the Phillies avoid a last-place finish 
in the National League East for the first time since 1970. His 404 assists 
in 1974 remains a record for third basemen. He also filled in at shortstop 
and first base. Schmidt's batting average hovered below .200 through May 
1975. Solid months of July and August saw his average rise to .249 by the 
end of the season as he led the league in home runs for the second year 
in a row with 38. Schmidt started the 1976 season by hitting twelve home 
runs in Philadelphia's first fifteen games, including four in one game 
on April 17,[12] a feat accomplished only 16 times in the history of major 
league baseball. For the season, Schmidt drove in 107 runs, and led the 
league in home runs for the third year in a row (38), and won his first 
of ten Gold Gloves to lead the Phillies to their first division crown since 
division play started in 1969. The Phillies captured the NL East crown 
three years in a row; however, they were swept by Cincinnati's "Big Red 
Machine" in 1976, and lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. 
On December 5, 1978, the Phillies signed Pete Rose as a free agent, temporarily 
making Rose the highest-paid athlete in team sports with a four-year, $3.2-million 
contract. With Rose on board, the Phillies were early favorites to repeat 
as division winners in 1979.[citation needed] Instead, the Phillies finished 
the season at 84–78, and in fourth place in NL East. For his part, Schmidt 
broke the club record for home runs in a season with 45, eclipsing Chuck 
Klein's 43 hit in 1929. On October 3, 1980, the Phillies went into Montreal 
tied with the Expos for first place in the NL East. With a sacrifice fly 
in the first, and a solo home run in the sixth, Schmidt led the Phillies 
to a 2–1 victory to capture first place.[13] A day later, Schmidt hit his 
48th home run of the season in the 11th inning to give the Phillies the 
6–4 extra innings victory over the Expos, and clinch the division.[14] 
His 48 home runs broke his own team record, and led the National League 
by a margin of thirteen over his nearest competitor. Coupled with a league-leading 
121 RBIs, Schmidt was a unanimous choice for the National League's Most 
Valuable Player Award. The Phillies defeated the Houston Astros in the 
1980 National League Championship Series[15] to reach the World Series 
for the third time in franchise history. Though Schmidt had just a career 
.191 post-season batting average with no home runs and five RBIs, his bat 
came alive in the 1980 World Series, hitting two homers and driving in 
seven runs against the Kansas City Royals. The Phillies beat the Royals 
in six games to win the first World Series in franchise history, and Schmidt 
won the World Series MVP Award. Following the World Series, Schmidt and 
four of his Phillies teammates appeared on Family Feud for one week in 
1980. He, Larry Bowa, Garry Maddox, Dick Ruthven and Del Unser took on 
five members of the Kansas City Royals: Dennis Leonard, Dan Quisenberry, 
Paul Splittorff, John Wathan and Willie Wilson. Schmidt's best season may 
have been the strike-shortened 1981 season. His 31 home runs were seven 
more than anyone else in the league. He also led the NL in runs scored, 
RBIs, total bases and walks, and set personal highs in batting average, 
on-base percentage and slugging percentage. He won his second consecutive 
MVP award, this time with 96% of the vote. The Phillies led the NL East 
by 3.5 games when the 1981 Major League Baseball strike hit. As a result, 
the Phillies were named NL East champions for the first half of the season; 
however, they lost to the second-half champion Montreal Expos in the 1981 
National League Division Series. In 1983, in celebration of the team's 
100th anniversary, Schmidt was voted by fans the greatest player in the 
history of the franchise. That year, he led the league in home runs for 
the sixth time in his career to lead the Phillies back to the postseason. 
Schmidt led his team with a .467 batting average and scored five runs as 
they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1983 National League Championship 
Series. It was, however, a much different story against the Baltimore Orioles 
in the 1983 World Series. The Phillies were held to a .195 team batting 
average; Schmidt went just 1-for-20 with a single. Following the 1983 season, 
Pete Rose left the Phillies as a free agent and signed with the Montreal 
Expos. With a hole at first base, the Phillies played Tim Corcoran and 
Len Matuszek in a platoon system during the 1984 season. Neither player 
provided the offensive spark Rose did, and so a change was in order. Early 
in the 1985 season, Schmidt agreed to move to first base (starting from 
late May) through the end of the season with Rick Schu assuming third base 
duties. The Phillies finished with a record below .500 for the first time 
since 1974. In 1986, the Phillies moved outfielder Von Hayes to first base 
and shifted Schmidt back to third base. He responded by winning his third 
MVP award, a record for third basemen,[16] with a league-leading 37 home 
runs and 119 RBIs. Trailing the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–5 in the top of the 
ninth inning at Three Rivers Stadium on April 18, 1987, Schmidt hit his 
500th career home run, a three-run shot off of Don Robinson. It put the 
Phillies in front 8–6, and ended up being the game-winner.[17] Injuries 
to Schmidt's rotator cuff caused him to miss the last month and a half 
of the 1988 season. He returned healthy for the 1989 season, however, after 
a poor start, Schmidt suddenly chose to announce his retirement in San 
Diego, on May 29. Although he typically demonstrated little emotion on 
the field (and was known as "Captain Cool" by many in Philadelphia sports 
circles), Schmidt surprised many[who?] with an emotional, and occasionally 
tearful, retirement speech. His last game was May 28, 1989, against the 
San Francisco Giants.[18] Despite his own perceived subpar start and subsequent 
retirement on May 29, fans once again voted Schmidt to be the starting 
third basemen for the NL All-Star team. He decided not to play, but he 
did participate in the game's opening ceremony in uniform.[19] Over his 
career Schmidt set a vast array of hitting and fielding records. In addition 
to his MVP Awards, Schmidt won ten Gold Gloves, led the league in home 
runs eight times, in RBIs four times, OPS five times, and walks four times. 
He was named to twelve All-Star teams. He is the Phillies all-time leader 
in games played, at-bats, plate appearances, runs scored, home runs, RBI, 
walks, strikeouts, total bases, runs created, sacrifice flies, outs, Adj. 
Batting Runs, Adj. Batting Wins, Extra Base Hits, Times On Base, and Power-Speed 
number. Schmidt's 548 home runs are the most ever hit by a player who spent 
his entire career with just one team. Schmidt opted, at first, to pursue 
a more private lifestyle after his career, rather than to become a manager 
or coach. He has written a number of articles on baseball for CBS and regularly 
participates in charity golf tournaments. The Sporting News named Schmidt 
"The Player of the Decade" of the 1980s, in their January 29, 1990 issue. 
His uniform number 20 was retired by the Phillies before a game at Veterans 
Stadium on May 26, 1990. That same season, Mike was inducted as a member 
of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame (he had previously been inducted 
as the third baseman for the Phillies' Centennial Team in 1983). In 1991, 
he and Nolan Ryan were inducted into the Peter J. McGovern Little League 
Museum's Hall of Excellence (established in 1988), thereby becoming only 
the second and third MLB players inducted into the Hall. In 1995 (on his 
first ballot), Schmidt was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
with what was at the time the fourth highest voting percentage ever, 96.52%.[20] 
In 1997, Schmidt was elected as the starting third-baseman by the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America to the Major League Baseball All-Time Team. 
The event was celebrated at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game 
in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1999, he ranked number 28 on The Sporting News's 
list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[21] the highest-ranking third 
baseman, and the highest-ranking player whose career began after 1967. 
Later that year, he was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century 
Team as the starting third-baseman. The event was celebrated at the 1999 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Boston, Massachusetts. Schmidt was 
honored with a statue outside the third-base gate at Citizens Bank Park 
in 2004. On September 27, 2006, Schmidt was announced as the Phillies representative 
for the DHL Hometown Heroes promotion, beating-out Steve Carlton, Richie 
Ashburn, Robin Roberts and Chuck Klein as most outstanding player in the 
Phillies history. On July 14, 2015, Schmidt was named one of the Phillies 
"Franchise Four" as voted by the fans, along with Steve Carlton, Richie 
Ashburn and Robin Roberts. Schmidt has publicly expressed his thoughts 
on various baseball controversies. He has been a vocal advocate for the 
reinstatement of Pete Rose to baseball. In July 2005, he appeared on Bob 
Costas' HBO show Costas Now to discuss steroids, and said, "Let me go out 
on a limb and say that if I had played during that era I would have taken 
steroids... We all have these things we deal with in life, and I'm surely 
not going to sit here and say to you guys, 'I wouldn't have done that.'" 
In his 2006 book, Clearing the Bases: Juiced Players, Monster Salaries, 
Sham Records, and a Hall of Famer's Search for the Soul of Baseball, he 
somewhat recanted that statement, saying that he understood the desire 
to get a competitive advantage even though he could not condone breaking 
the rules to do so. Starting in 2002, Schmidt works with the Phillies as 
a hitting coach during each Spring training. In October 2003, Schmidt was 
named the manager of the Phillies' Single A Florida State League affiliate, 
the Clearwater Threshers. He managed them for just the 2004 season, then 
resigned. In 2009, he served as third base coach for Team USA in the World 
Baseball Classic. In 2001, Schmidt began sponsoring an annual fishing tournament 
known as the Mike Schmidt Winner's Circle Invitational at Old Bahama Bay 
in West End, Grand Bahama Island. The first event raised $27,000, and has 
since raised over $1.5 million for cystic fibrosis.[22] In 2008, Schmidt 
released a wine called Mike Schmidt 548 Zinfandel, a reference to his 548 
career home runs, with proceeds also going to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.[23] 
NBC used Schmidt as a guest analyst (Marv Albert served as the pregame 
host) for Game 1 of the 1989 NLCS. Schmidt subsequently, did on-field reporting 
throughout the series. Schmidt also provided periodic commentary (albeit, 
taped prior to the playoffs) for ABC during the 1988 NLCS. Schmidt spent 
the 1990 season as a color analyst with the Phillies broadcast team on 
the now-defunct PRISM network, where he was partnered with play-by-play 
announcer Jim Barniak, and was known to be very candid and honest with 
his commentary. He returned to the booth again starting in 2014, serving 
as a color analyst for the Phillies' Sunday home games on Comcast SportsNet 
Philadelphia.[24] In 2015, Schmidt added Saturday home games to his schedule, 
creating a "Weekends with Schmidt" format. On March 16, 2014, Schmidt disclosed 
that he battled stage-3 melanoma cancer during the summer of 2013, but
