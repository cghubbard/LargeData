North Stamford is section of Stamford, Connecticut, USA, north of the Merritt 
Parkway. Often hilly and wooded, it is less densely developed than the 
rest of the city, containing about one-third of the land area within the 
city [1] but only about 12% of the total population (per the 2000 Census).[2][3] 
North Stamford was a village until 1949, when it became part of the City 
of Stamford.[1] To the southeast is the Springdale section of Stamford, 
to the south is the Turn of River section and to the southwest is the Westover 
section of Stamford. To the west is the "back country" of Greenwich and 
to the north is Pound Ridge, New York. To the east is New Canaan. High 
Ridge Road, in the area just south of the Merrit Parkway, is the largest 
shopping district near North Stamford. A shopping plaza and some surrounding 
stores are also nearby on Newfield Avenue, and downtown Springdale also 
offers nearby stores. When Stamford's population began to grow during and 
after World War II, 30,000 new residents arrived from 1940 to 1960. "North 
Stamford developed with one- and two-acre zoning, looking just like Wilton 
or New Canaan," Janice Green, the manager of the William Pitt Real Estate 
office, told The New York Times in 1989. "Executives moved up there who 
had no connection with the factories and ethnic working-class neighborhoods 
downtown."[4] City reservoirs are located in North Stamford, as are the 
Bartlett Arboretum and the Stamford Historical Society headquarters and 
museum. Also in the neighborhood is the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 
a 118-acre (0.48 km2) facility on Scofieldtown Road. The museum works with 
schools in Stamford, Bridgeport, Norwalk, Darien and Greenwich, and more 
than 10,000 students visit every year. In 2007 the museum and nature center 
started working with Aquarion, a water utility serving much of Fairfield 
County, in a program meant to educate children about water ecology and 
watershed protection.[5] Buttonwood Manor, a Colonial-style house on an 
estate of 8 acres (32,000 m2), is in North Stamford. The original main 
house was built by Jacob Stevens in 1809, then sold it in 1821 to Gould 
Raymond. For 77 years the Raymond family farmed the land. By 1926 Mary 
Stella Tisdale Atwood had bought the house from Otto Sarrach and began 
restoring it. She sold the estate to William E. Stevenson, a Gold Medal 
winner in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris (setting a new world record 
of 3:16.0 as member of the American 400-meter relay team) and later a president 
of Oberlin College. While Stevenson and his wife were in England running 
American Red Cross operations in World War II, they rented the house to 
Dorothy Fields, a lyricist.[6] North Stamford contains numerous old cemeteries 
from the nineteenth century and before, some quite small and often with 
gravestones bearing elaborate engravings and even poetry.[7] These old 
cemeteries are in North Stamford:[7] The Stamford Fire Rescue Department's 
Fire Station #'s 8 and 9 serve the neighborhood, as well as the Turn of 
River Volunteer Fire Department Station #'s 1 and 2 and the Long Ridge
