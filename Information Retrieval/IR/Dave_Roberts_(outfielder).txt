As player As coach As manager David Ray Roberts (born May 31, 1972) is 
a former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder and current manager of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played for five Major League teams over a ten-year 
career, and then coached for the San Diego Padres before being named Dodgers 
manager for the 2016 season. Although he played for the Boston Red Sox 
for only part of one season, his most notable achievement as a player was 
a key stolen base in the 2004 ALCS that ignited the Red Sox' drive to their 
curse-breaking championship that year. Roberts batted and threw left-handed. 
Roberts was born in Naha, Okinawa to Eiko and Waymon Roberts, a United 
States Marine stationed in Japan. He also has a younger sister named Melissa.[1] 
His childhood was spent moving from one military base to another before 
settling in San Diego, California.[1] Roberts attended Vista High School 
as a freshman and was the MVP of the junior varsity baseball team.[2] He 
transferred to Rancho Buena Vista High School when it opened the following 
year, where he was a standout in football, basketball, and baseball.[2] 
In football, he was a three-year starter at quarterback; as a senior, he 
helped lead his team to the San Diego Section Class 3A championship.[3] 
Roberts was recruited to play football for the Air Force Academy as an 
option quarterback, but declined because he wanted to play baseball.[2] 
Roberts decided to attend UCLA and joined the Bruins baseball team as a 
walk-on outfielder after impressing coaches with his speed and enthusiasm.[2] 
He hit .331 as a sophomore with 36 stolen bases[4] and as a junior he hit 
.296 with 28 steals.[4] The Cleveland Indians drafted him in the 47th round 
of the 1993 MLB draft.[5] He was disappointed with being drafted so low, 
behind seven other UCLA juniors, and his coach told him that he needed 
to improve his defense, and that his weak throwing arm was hurting his 
draft stock.[2] He improved by getting to the ball quicker and was able 
to lead the Bruins in outfield assists as a senior,[2] while also hitting 
.353 with 45 steals.[4] He left UCLA as the school's all-time stolen-base 
leader and graduated with his Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1995.[6] 
Roberts was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 28th round of the 1994 
MLB Draft[7] and signed with them on June 9, 1994.[8] He began his career 
with the Jamestown Jammers, the Tigers short-season class "A" team in the 
New York–Pennsylvania League. Roberts hit .292 with 12 steals for the Jammers, 
who won the division title with a 42–32 record.[9][10] For the 1995 season, 
he was promoted to play for the Lakeland Tigers in the Florida State League, 
where he hit .303 in 92 games with 30 stolen bases, fourth best in the 
league.[10][11] In 1996, Roberts was assigned to the Visalia Oaks of the 
California League. The Oaks were a co-op team made up of players from several 
organizations. He was frustrated with the assignment and thought about 
quitting baseball but his father talked him out of it.[12] In 126 games, 
he hit .272 with 65 stolen bases,[10] which led all of minor league baseball 
and he scored 112 runs, tops in the Cal League.[11] He appeared in three 
games for the AA Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League at the end of 
the season and had two hits in nine at-bats.[10] He also hit a three-run 
home run in the 15th inning to help the Suns win game 1 of their playoff 
series.[13] The following season, he remained at Jacksonville and played 
in 105 games for them, with a .296 average and 23 steals.[10] In 1998, 
Roberts once again began the season with the Suns. He played in 69 games 
and hit .326 with 21 stolen bases[10] and was named to the Southern League 
mid-season all-star team.[11] In June 1998, Roberts and Tim Worrell were 
traded to the Cleveland Indians for Gerónimo Berroa.[14] Roberts was traded 
just prior to the Southern League all-star game and played in the game 
wearing an Indians hat even though the Indians did not have a Southern 
League team at the time.[11] He was assigned to the Akron Aeros of the 
Eastern League where he batted .361 in 56 games with 28 steals.[10] He 
was promoted to the Buffalo Bisons, the Indians Triple-A team in the International 
League late in the season.[15] He had only two hits in fifteen at-bats 
for the Bisons[10] but remained with the team in the playoffs, as the Bisons 
won their first Governors' Cup in nearly 40 years[16] and made it to the 
Triple-A World Series.[15] Roberts would later say that his promotion to 
Buffalo was exciting to him because he realized he was getting close to 
the big leagues and his time there really allowed him to become a better 
ballplayer.[15] Roberts was a non-roster invitee at Indians spring training 
in 1999 but was assigned to Buffalo to start the season.[11] In 89 games 
for the Bisons, he had a .271 batting average with 39 steals.[10] He earned 
International League all-star honors for the season.[16] He had his contract 
purchased by the Indians on August 7, 1999[11] and he made his major league 
debut batting leadoff and playing center field for the Indians against 
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In his debut he had three hits in five at-bats 
and stole a base, though he was also picked off once.[17] His first MLB 
hit was a double to center field in his second at-bat, off of Bobby Witt 
of the Devil Rays in the second inning.[17] He hit his first home run, 
on August 30 off of Ramón Ortiz of the Anaheim Angels.[18] On September 
24, he hit a grand slam homer off of John Hudek of the Toronto Blue Jays.[19] 
Overall, he was in 41 games for the Indians in 1999 and hit .238 with two 
homers, 12 RBI and 11 stolen bases.[8] He also appeared in two games of 
the 1999 American League Division Series (ALDS), going hitless in three 
at-bats.[20] Roberts spent most of 2000 back in the minors with Buffalo, 
where he had a .292 average in 120 games with a career high 13 homers, 
55 RBI and 39 steals.[10] He also was second in the league with 93 runs 
scored.[11] He was called up to the Indians briefly from May 26–29 and 
then was called up when rosters expanded in September.[11] In 19 games 
for the Indians, he had only two hits in 10 at-bats while being used primarily 
as a late-game defensive replacement.[21] After the season, he had surgery 
on his left shoulder to repair a torn labrum and fraying around his rotator 
cuff, which caused him to begin the following season on the 60-day disabled 
list.[11] When he returned on June 24, he was optioned back to the Bisons[11] 
where he hit .303 in 62 games.[10] His 97 career steals in parts of four 
seasons in Buffalo ranks as the tops in franchise history and he would 
eventually be selected to the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame.[16] He was 
again recalled to the majors in September and had four hits in 12 at-bats 
in 15 games for the Indians.[8] In parts of three seasons with Cleveland, 
he hit .242 in 75 games.[8] On December 22, 2001, Roberts was traded to 
the Los Angeles Dodgers for minor league pitchers Christian Bridenbaugh 
and Nial Hughes.[22] The 2002 season with the Dodgers was Roberts's first 
full season on a major league roster and he was the Dodgers leadoff hitter 
and starting center fielder. He finished the season with a .277 batting 
average in 127 games with 45 stolen bases.[23] He missed the final seven 
games of the regular season with a partially torn oblique.[11] In 2003, 
Roberts only appeared in 107 games due to neck and hamstring injuries[11] 
and hit .250 while stealing 40 bases[8] He was the 10th Dodgers player 
in history with consecutive 40 steal seasons and committed his first career 
error on April 22 against the Cincinnati Reds, snapping a streak of 406 
attempts without an error.[11] He began the 2004 campaign with the Dodgers 
and hit .253 in 68 games with 33 steals[11] despite missing most of May 
with a strained hamstring.[11] On July 31, 2004, the Dodgers traded Roberts 
to the Boston Red Sox for minor league outfielder Henri Stanley.[24] He 
played in 45 games for the Red Sox and hit .256.[8] However, Roberts made 
a large contribution to the 2004 Red Sox' post-season, even though he did 
not play in the 2004 World Series. Most notable was his stolen base against 
the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series Game 4. The 
Red Sox were facing elimination in the bottom of the ninth inning, down 
4 runs to 3. Kevin Millar drew a walk from Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. 
Roberts, who had not played in ten days, came in to pinch run with Bill 
Mueller now at the plate. Rivera checked Roberts three times (the last 
of which almost picked the runner off) before throwing a pitch to Mueller. 
On the next pitch, Roberts stole second base, just beating the throw from 
Yankee catcher Jorge Posada. Mueller followed with a single, Roberts scored, 
and the Sox went on to win in twelve innings and began their run of eight 
straight wins, culminating in Boston's first World Series title since 1918.[25][26] 
In 2006, the event was recognized as a Memorable Moment in Red Sox history 
by the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.[27] The Red Sox traded Roberts to the 
San Diego Padres on December 20, 2004 in exchange for outfielder Jay Payton, 
infielder Ramón Vázquez, minor league pitcher David Pauley and cash.[28] 
Roberts played center field for the Padres in 2005, hitting .275 in 115 
games.[8] and then moved to left field when they acquired Gold Glove winner 
Mike Cameron from the New York Mets before the 2006 season.[29] That 2006 
season, Roberts established career highs with a .293 batting average, 49 
steals, and 13 triples,[8] the latter mark tying Tony Gwynn's 19-year single-season 
franchise record.[11] In the 2006 National League Division Series, Roberts 
hit .438 to lead the Padres, though they still were eliminated from the 
playoffs by the St. Louis Cardinals.[30] In December 2006, Roberts signed 
with the San Francisco Giants. The Giants, trying to acquire a center fielder, 
first tried to sign Gary Matthews, Jr. and Juan Pierre, but both players 
passed on the Giants in favor of other teams. Roberts agreed to a 3-year, 
$18-million deal with the team in early December 2006. The Giants backloaded 
the deal, agreeing to pay Roberts $5 million in 2007 and $6.5 million in 
2008 and 2009.[31] Roberts' career with the Giants got off to a slow start 
because of injury. He spent most of May and early June on the disabled 
list. Roberts was batting only .216 before he went on the disabled list, 
but his swing had been hampered by the bone chips and spurs in his elbow 
that required surgery.[32] He finished the season, hitting .260 in 114 
games with 31 stolen bases.[8] Continually bothered by injuries, he only 
played in 52 games in 2008, hitting a career low .224 with only five steals.[8] 
On March 5, 2009 Roberts was released by the Giants, despite the team still 
owing him the last year of his contract.[33] Roberts had above-average 
knowledge of the strike zone. He had little power, but was a spray hitter 
who used raw speed to get on base and stretch singles to doubles. Once 
on base, he commonly "manufactured" runs by employing such tactics as stealing 
second base, moving to third on a grounder, and coming home on a sacrifice 
fly. When he was healthy, Roberts was widely known as one of the best base 
stealers in baseball[citation needed]. From 2002 to 2006, Roberts had 195 
steals, as well as an 81 percent success rate, both of which were the second-best 
in the majors among base stealers with 175 steals just behind stolen base 
king Rickey Henderson in the career stolen base rate rankings. Roberts 
had exceptional range in the outfield, but his below-average arm occasionally 
allowed his opponents to take extra bases on him.[citation needed] In May 
2009, Roberts retired from baseball and joined NESN as a studio analyst 
and occasional color commentator for Red Sox telecasts.[34] After one season 
as a broadcaster, he left the network to join the Padres as a Baseball 
Operations Special Assistant, where he would work with players in the organization 
on outfield defense, base running and bunting.[35] On October 18, 2010, 
Roberts replaced Rick Renteria as the Padres' first base coach when Rentería 
was promoted to bench coach.[36] When Rentería was named manager of the 
Chicago Cubs after the 2013 season, Roberts once again succeeded him, named 
as manager Bud Black's bench coach for the 2014 campaign.[37] On June 15, 
2015, Roberts filled in as the Padres' manager for one game when Black 
was fired after starting 2015 at 32–33 and six games behind in the National 
League West.[38] The Padres lost that game 9–1 to the Oakland Athletics.[39] 
Pat Murphy was named as the new manager the next day and Roberts returned 
to his bench coach role for the rest of the season.[40] On November 23, 
2015, Roberts was named the Los Angeles Dodgers' new manager.[41] The Dodgers 
set a Major League Baseball record in Roberts' first year by placing 28 
different players on the disabled list throughout the season, as well as 
setting the record for the most pitching changes (606) in a single season. 
Despite the injuries, the Dodgers clinched their 4th consecutive NL West 
title on September 25, 2016 and advanced to the NLCS. He was selected as 
the Sporting News National League Manager of the Year[42] and was voted 
by the Baseball Writers' Association of America as the National League 
Manager of the Year.[43] Roberts married his high school girlfriend, Tricia, 
in 1997. They have two children, Cole and Emmerson.[45] The Robertses, 
along with former teammate Rich Aurilia and friends John and Noelle Micek, 
have been partners in Red Stitch Winery, based in Cardiff, California, 
since 2008.[45] In March 2010, Roberts was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.[46] 
By June 2011, after receiving treatments for lymphoma, Roberts reported
