The Chicago Cubs are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Chicago, 
Illinois. They play in the National League Central division. Since the 
institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Cubs have selected 60 players in 
the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player Draft",[1] 
the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball 
players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to 
its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's 
standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first 
pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season 
may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of the 60 players 
picked in the first round by the Cubs, 30 have been pitchers, the most 
of any position; 24 of these were right-handed, while 6 were left-handed. 
Sixteen players picked in the initial round were outfielders, while eight 
shortstops, two catchers, and one player each at first base, second base, 
and third base were also taken.[3] The Cubs drafted 25 players out of high 
school, and 32 out of college. Chicago has drafted eleven players from 
high schools or colleges in the state of California, with six more coming 
from Texas and five from Indiana. The Cubs have also taken three players 
from their home state of Illinois.[3] The Cubs have not won a World Series 
championship since 1908,[4] and no pick has been elected to the Hall of 
Fame. The Cubs' first-round selection in 1995—Kerry Wood—won the MLB Rookie 
of the Year award with the franchise in 1998, his first season in the Major 
Leagues.[5] Kris Bryant became the second Cubs first-round selection to 
win the MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 2015.[6] One pick—1985 selection 
Rafael Palmeiro—is a member of both the 3,000 hit club and the 500 home 
run club.[7] The Cubs have held the first overall pick in the draft only 
once, in 1982, when they selected Shawon Dunston.[3] The Cubs have received 
13 compensatory picks, including nine selections made in the supplemental 
round of the draft since the institution of the First-Year Player Draft 
in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly 
valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][8][V] or, more recently, 
if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[9] As the 
Cubs have signed all of their first-round picks, they have never been awarded
