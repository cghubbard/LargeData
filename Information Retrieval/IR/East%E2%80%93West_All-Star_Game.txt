The East-West All-Star Game was an annual all-star game for Negro league 
baseball players. The game was the brainchild of Gus Greenlee, owner of 
the Pittsburgh Crawfords. In 1933 he decided to match the Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game with Negro league players. Newspaper balloting was 
set up to allow the fans to choose the starting lineups for that first 
game, a tradition that continued through the series' end in 1962. Unlike 
the white All-Star game which is played near the middle of the season, 
the Negro All-Star game was held toward the end of the season. Because 
league structures were shaky during the Great Depression and also because 
certain teams (notably the Kansas City Monarchs and the Homestead Grays) 
sometimes played entirely independent of the leagues, votes were not counted 
by league, but by geographical location. Hence, the games were known as 
the East-West All-Star Games. Votes were tallied by two of the major African-American 
weekly newspapers of the day, the Chicago Defender and the Pittsburgh Courier. 
All games were held at Comiskey Park in Chicago unless otherwise noted.
