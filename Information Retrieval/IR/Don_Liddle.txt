Donald Eugene Liddle (May 25, 1925 – June 5, 2000) was an American left-handed 
pitcher in professional baseball who played four seasons in the Major Leagues 
for the Milwaukee Braves, New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals from 
1953 through 1956. Born in Mount Carmel, Illinois, he batted left-handed, 
stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 165 pounds (75 kg). Liddle 
is most remembered as the man who, in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, 
threw the pitch to Vic Wertz that resulted in The Catch — Giant center 
fielder Willie Mays' historic back-to-home-plate, over-the-shoulder grab 
of Wertz' long drive with two men on base in the deepest part of center 
field at the Giants' home field, the Polo Grounds. Had the ball fallen 
safely, the opposition Cleveland Indians would have taken the lead 4–2 
late in the game. But Mays' catch preserved a 2–2 tie, the Giants won the 
game in extra innings, and swept the Series in four straight contests. 
Wertz was the only batter Liddle faced that day. Reportedly, he commented 
after the game was over in the locker room, "Well, I got my man", joking 
about his good fortune and Mays' athletic performance.[citation needed] 
Liddle later started and won the decisive Game 4 in Cleveland, pitching 
6 2⁄3 innings and giving up only one earned run. Earlier in 1954, Liddle 
was part of a pivotal, five-player trade, coming to the Giants with fellow 
left-handed pitcher Johnny Antonelli from the Braves in exchange for 1951 
playoff hero Bobby Thomson. Antonelli won 21 games for the 1954 Giants, 
leading them to the National League pennant, and topped the Senior Circuit 
in earned run average. Liddle appeared in 117 Major League games played, 
54 as a starting pitcher. In 427 2⁄3 innings, he gave up 397 hits and 203 
bases on balls, striking out 198. He retired from baseball after the 1957 
season, which he spent in minor league baseball. Liddle died, aged 75,
