Linus Reinhard Frey [Junior] (August 23, 1910 – September 13, 2009) was 
an infielder in Major League Baseball who played from 1933 through 1948 
for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1933–1936), Chicago Cubs (1937, 1947), Cincinnati 
Reds (1938–1943, 1946), New York Yankees (1947–1948), and New York Giants 
(1948). He was born in Saint Louis, Missouri. Frey began his career as 
a switch hitter and continued to bat from both sides of the plate until 
the end of 1938. Starting in 1939, he batted exclusively from the left 
side of the plate. He started at shortstop with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 
1933 and switched to second base after leading the National League in errors 
in 1935 (44) and 1936 (51). Traded to the Chicago Cubs before the 1936 
season he developed as a competent second baseman. Frey enjoyed his best 
years with the Cincinnati Reds, helping them to reach two consecutive World 
Series in 1939 and 1940, after hitting .291 with 11 home runs and 95 runs 
(1939) and leading the National League with 22 stolen bases (1940) while 
scoring 102 runs. Five days before the 1940 World Series against Detroit, 
Frey injured his foot when he dropped the iron lid of the dugout water 
cooler on it. Eddie Joost replaced him at second base for the series. A 
three-time All-Star (1939, 1941, 1943) Frey also led the NL second basemen 
twice each in fielding percentage and double plays (1940 and 1943). After 
missing two full seasons while serving in World War II, his career faded. 
In 1947 he divided his playing time between the Cubs and the New York Yankees, 
and he was a member of the Yankees team that won the 1947 World Series. 
He played his final game with the New York Giants in 1948. In a 14-season 
career, Frey was a .269 hitter with 61 home runs, 549 RBI, 848 runs, 105 
stolen bases, and a .359 on-base percentage in 1,535 games played. In 1961 
Frey was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, and in 1969, as 
part of the franchise's 100th anniversary, was selected the Reds all-time 
second baseman. Frey died in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, at the age of 99. At 
the time of his death, he was recognized as the second-oldest living major 
league ballplayer, the oldest living All-Star, and the last living player
