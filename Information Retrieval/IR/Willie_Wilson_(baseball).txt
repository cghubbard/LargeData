Willie James Wilson (born July 9, 1955) is a former professional baseball 
player. He played nineteen seasons in Major League Baseball for the Kansas 
City Royals, Oakland Athletics, and Chicago Cubs. He was an outfielder 
known for his speed and ability as an effective leadoff hitter. Wilson's 
career total of 668 stolen bases currently ranks him in 12th place all-time 
among major leaguers. Wilson was a highly regarded high school baseball, 
football, and basketball player while growing up in Summit, New Jersey 
where he attended Summit High School.[1] Wilson was drafted out of high 
school after spurning a University of Maryland football scholarship.[2] 
The Kansas City Royals picked him in the first round of the 1974 draft. 
He started his professional career with the Gulf Coast Royals. He moved 
up to class-A in 1975 for the Waterloo Royals, leading the 1975 Midwest 
League champions in both RBIs and stolen bases,[3] and in 1976 played for 
the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. He earned a September call-up in 1976, 
playing in 12 games. He was mostly used as a pinch runner or defensive 
replacement, but did start one game on the penultimate day of the season. 
He had just six at bats, getting one hit and stealing two bases. Wilson 
began the 1977 season at Triple-A Omaha. In what turned out to be his last 
minor league action (not counting a stunt appearance in 2009), he batted 
.281 with 74 stolen bases. He was again called up in September, this time 
receiving more substantial playing time, batting .324 in 34 at bats with 
6 steals. 1978 was Wilson's first full season in the majors. He split the 
left field job with Tom Poquette, Clint Hurdle and Joe Zdeb, getting the 
most playing time at the position among the four, while also backing up 
Amos Otis in center field. Overall, he played in 127 games, but had just 
198 at bats while batting .217. Despite his limited playing time, he finished 
fifth in the American League with 46 stolen bases. He also appeared in 
three games in the 1978 American League Championship Series against the 
New York Yankees, starting Game Four. Wilson started the 1979 season as 
the Royals' fourth outfielder, but by mid-May he had established himself 
as the team's starting left fielder. He batted .315 and led the league 
in stolen bases with 83 and singles with 148, while also finishing seventh 
in hits and third in triples. On defense, he led the league in range factor 
and putouts and finished second in assists among left fielders. In 1980, 
Wilson started the year as the starting center fielder when Amos Otis opened 
the season on the disabled list, and acquitted himself well, posting an 
above-average range factor and making just one error in 195 total chances 
for the year in center. He moved back to left when Otis returned in late 
May, and wound up leading the league in several categories. His 705 official 
at bats were a major league record until it was surpassed by Jimmy Rollins 
in 2007.[4] He also led the league in hits, runs scored, triples, and singles, 
and finished second in steals with 79. He won both the Gold Glove and Silver 
Slugger Awards, and was fourth in the AL MVP voting, his best finish. In 
the 1980 American League Championship Series, Wilson batted .308 and tied 
George Brett for the team lead in runs batted in with four as the Royals 
swept the Yankees in three straight games. In the 1980 World Series, Wilson 
batted just .154 and struck out against Tug McGraw for the final out of 
the Royals six-game loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. This strikeout was 
Wilson's 12th of the Series, breaking the record of 11 held jointly by 
Eddie Mathews and Wayne Garrett in the 1958 and 1973 World Series, respectively. 
Ryan Howard would break Wilson's record by striking out 13 times in the 
2009 World Series. Wilson's batting average slipped to .303 in the strike-shortened 
1981 season, and most of his other numbers were off from the previous two 
seasons as well. In the 1981 American League Division Series against the 
Oakland A's, he batted .308, but failed to score a run, steal a base, or 
get an extra-base hit in the three-game sweep. In 1982, Wilson bounced 
back to bat .332 and win the AL batting title, the first switch hitter 
to do so since Mickey Mantle in 1956. Although the Royals missed the playoffs 
for the first time since 1979, Wilson made his first American League All-Star 
team that year and winning his second Silver Slugger Award. He led the 
league in singles for the fourth year in a row and in triples for the second 
time in three seasons. In 1983, Wilson moved to center field in June when 
the club decided to shuffle their outfield, moving long-time center fielder 
Otis to right field, and moving Pat Sheridan and Leon Roberts, who had 
been sharing right field, over to left. In the midst of the shuffle, Wilson 
had his worst season at the plate to date, batting just .276. Although 
he still finished third in the league with 59 stolen bases and made the 
All-Star Team for the second time, his on-base percentage and slugging 
percentage also hit what were to that point career lows at .316 and .352 
respectively. However, Wilson's problems in 1983 were not limited to on-field 
issues. After the end of the 1983 season, Wilson found himself in a drug 
scandal along with teammates Willie Aikens, Vida Blue, and Jerry Martin. 
All four pleaded guilty to misdemeanor drug charges (attempting to purchase 
cocaine) on November 17.[5] They became the first active major leaguers 
to serve jail time,[citation needed] serving 81 days at the Fort Worth, 
Texas, Federal Correctional Institution. He was suspended by commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn for the entire 1984 season, but the suspension was reduced on 
appeal and he was able to return on May 15.[5] The Royals traded or released 
the other three,[6] with only Wilson returning to the Royals, and he hit 
.301 and stole 47 bases after his return. In 1985, Wilson batted .278 and 
led the league in triples for the third time with a career-high 21. He 
also gained a measure of redemption from the albatross of his 1980 World 
Series performance, hitting .310 against Toronto in the 1985 ALCS and .367 
against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1985 World Series, which was their 
first and only World Championship until 2015. Wilson remained a fixture 
in the outfield for the Royals over the next five seasons. Although his 
bat wasn't what it was in the early part of his career, he still led the 
league twice more in triples and continued to finish in the top ten in 
steals, a run of eleven seasons that lasted until 1988, and may have continued 
if he didn't miss chunks of the 1989 and 1990 season to injuries. He also 
continued to play well defensively, leading the league in fielding percentage 
among center fielders in 1987, and among all outfielders in 1990, when 
he finished the year without a single error. Wilson left the Royals following 
the 1990 season as a free agent, and he was signed by the Oakland Athletics. 
There, he took over the role of Félix José, who had been traded late in 
1990, as the fourth outfielder behind Rickey Henderson, Dave Henderson 
and Jose Canseco. He played 113 games, including at least 19 at all three 
outfield positions, and batted .238. In 1992, Dave Henderson missed most 
of the season with a hamstring injury,[7] leaving Wilson as the starting 
center fielder. He played in 132 games, his most since 1988, and batted 
.270. In his first playoff action since the 1985 World Series, he stole 
seven bases in the 1992 ALCS against the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Lou Brock's 
record for steals in one post-season (Brock stole seven bases each in the 
1967 and 1968 World Series). He batted just .227, however, and the A's 
lost the series in six games. Wilson became a free agent again after the 
1992 season, and he signed with the Chicago Cubs. He started 1993 in a 
center field platoon with Dwight Smith, later splitting time with Sammy 
Sosa when the latter wasn't playing in right field. He batted .258, but 
managed just seven stolen bases—a career-low for a full season—and he began 
the 1994 season on the bench behind Tuffy Rhodes. After playing just 17 
games that year, he was released on May 16, ending his major league career. 
Wilson retired with a .285 career batting average and 668 stolen bases, 
which ranks 12th all-time.[8] For his career, Wilson hit 13 inside-the-park 
home runs, the most of any major league player playing after 1950.[9] Wilson 
coached in the Toronto Blue Jays system in 1995 and 1997. He was elected 
to the Royals Hall of Fame in 2000. In 2003, Wilson was named field manager 
of the London Monarchs Baseball Club in the fledgling Canadian Baseball 
League, but the league folded halfway through the 2003 season. Wilson also 
came out of retirement in 2009, signing a one-day contract with the Kansas 
City T-Bones, an independent minor league team playing in the Northern 
League. He currently runs The Willie Wilson Baseball Foundation in Kansas
