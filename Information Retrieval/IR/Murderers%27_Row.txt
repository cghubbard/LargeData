Murderers’ Row were the baseball teams of the New York Yankees in the late 
1920s, widely considered one of the best teams in history. The nickname 
is in particular describing the first six hitters in the 1927 team lineup: 
Earle Combs, Mark Koenig, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel, and Tony Lazzeri. 
The term was originally coined in 1918 by a sportswriter to describe the 
pre-Babe Ruth Yankee lineup of 1918. A 1918 newspaper article described 
it: "New York fans have come to know a section of the Yankees' batting 
order as 'murderers' row.' It is composed of the first six players in the 
batting order—Gilhooley, Peckinpaugh, Baker, Pratt, Pipp, and Bodie. This 
sextet has been hammering the offerings of all comers."[1] The term was 
initially associated with the beginning of Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig Yankee 
teams in the mid-1920s, and is commonly recognized to refer specifically 
to the core of the 1927 Yankee hitting lineup. Owner Jacob Ruppert is the 
man most often credited with building the team, although general manager 
Ed Barrow may have had as much to do with it. In a game of a July series 
against the Washington Senators, the Yankees beat their opponents 21–1, 
and prompted Senators' first baseman Joe Judge to say, "Those fellows not 
only beat you but they tear your heart out. I wish the season was over."[2] 
The 1927 season was particularly spectacular by baseball standards for 
the Yankees. After losing in the 1926 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, 
they went 110–44 the next year, winning the A.L. pennant by 19 games and 
sweeping the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1927 World Series. Only four teams 
have won more regular season games: the 1906 Chicago Cubs and the 2001 
Seattle Mariners with 116, the 1998 Yankees with 114 and the 1954 Cleveland 
Indians with 111. However, the 1998 Yankees and 2001 Mariners played in 
162-game schedules. Both the Cubs and the Indians lost in the World Series, 
while the Mariners lost to the Yankees in the 2001 ALCS. The 1998 Yankees 
went 11–2 in the playoffs, sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series. 
The 1927 Yankees batted .307, slugged .489, scored 975 runs, and outscored 
their opponents by a record 376 runs. Center fielder Earle Combs had a 
career best year, batting .356 with 231 hits, left fielder Bob Meusel batted 
.337 with 103 RBIs, and second baseman Tony Lazzeri drove in 102 runs. 
Gehrig batted .373, with 218 hits, 52 doubles, 18 triples, 47 home runs, 
a then record 175 RBIs, slugged at .765, and was voted A.L. MVP. Ruth amassed 
a .356 batting average, 164 RBIs, 158 runs scored, walked 137 times, and 
slugged .772. Most notably, his 60 home runs that year broke his own record 
and remained the Major League mark for 34 years until Roger Maris broke 
it by one with 61; however, just like the 1998 Yankees and 2001 Mariners, 
this was done in a 162-game schedule, a fact that Commissioner Ford Frick 
wanted noted when the single-season home run record was to be referenced.[3] 
The pitching staff led the league in ERA at 3.20, and included Waite Hoyt, 
who went 22–7, which tied for the league lead, and Herb Pennock, who went 
19–8. Wilcy Moore won 16 as a reliever. The 1927 Yankees would eventually 
send six players along with manager Miller Huggins and president Ed Barrow 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame; only the 1928 Yankees had more with nine 
players along with Huggins and Barrow. Three other Yankee pitchers had 
ERAs under 3.00 that season. After sweeping the Pirates in the Series, 
the Yankees repeated the feat by sweeping the Cardinals in the 1928 World 
Series. The Yankees remain the only team to ever sweep the World Series 
in consecutive years; the Yankee teams of 1938–1939 and 1998–1999 repeated 
the feat. The term "Murderers' Row" is commonly used as a descriptor for 
teams with formidable talent.[4][5] During the 2006 ALDS, Detroit Tigers 
manager Jim Leyland referred to the 2006 Yankees as "Murderers' Row and 
Cano" since the entire lineup consisted of players such as Johnny Damon, 
Derek Jeter, Bobby Abreu, Gary Sheffield, Hideki Matsui, Alex Rodriguez, 
Jason Giambi, Jorge Posada and new second baseman Robinson Canó all of 
whom would have multiple All-Star game appearances over their careers. 
Despite Leyland's nomenclature, the team did not have the success of the 
original 1927 team as they were defeated by the Tigers in that series. 
In 2016, ESPN announced 1927: The Diary of Myles Thomas, part a new genre 
of storytelling known as "real-time historical fiction."[6] The core of 
the project is a historical novel in the form of a diary of Myles Thomas, 
written by Douglas Alden, complemented by a wealth of fact-based content 
from the season, all published along the same timeline as the events unfolded 
almost 90 years ago. Through Myles Thomas’s diary entries, additional essays 
and real-time social-media components (including Twitter[7]) “re-living” 
that famous Yankees season, the goal is to explore the rarefied nexus of 
baseball, jazz and Prohibition — defining elements of the remarkable world 
that existed in 1927. The diary runs the length of the full 1927 season,
