MLB NPB Andruw Rudolf Jones (Papiamento pronunciation: [ˈandruw ˈdʒonz]; 
born April 23, 1977) is a Curaçaoan professional baseball outfielder and 
designated hitter. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) most notably 
for the Atlanta Braves. Jones also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
Texas Rangers, Chicago White Sox, and New York Yankees, and in Nippon Professional 
Baseball (NPB) for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Jones was a noted 
defensive specialist for most of his career and won the Rawlings Gold Glove 
Award for outfielders every year from 1998 through 2007. Jones also had 
an elite arm in addition to fielding. He appeared in the All-Star Game 
five times, and he won both the Hank Aaron Award and a Silver Slugger Award 
for outfielders in 2005. In 2002, he was the inaugural National League 
(NL) All-Star Final Vote winner. While primarily a center fielder throughout 
his career, Jones transitioned to designated hitter and fourth outfielder 
role for the Rangers, White Sox, and Yankees. Jones made his debut during 
the 1996 season with the Atlanta Braves. In the 1996 World Series, Jones 
became the youngest player ever to hit a home run in the postseason, and 
just the second player ever to homer in his first two World Series at bats. 
The following season, Jones batted .231 with 18 home runs and finished 
5th in voting for Rookie of the Year. In 1998, Jones batted .271 with 31 
home runs. In 1999, he batted .275 with 26 home runs, 84 RBIs. Jones batted 
.303 with 36 home runs and 104 runs batted in (RBIs) in 2000, making his 
first All-Star team. Jones started to draw many comparisons to Willie Mays 
and was considered the best center fielder in baseball outside of Ken Griffey 
Jr. The following season, Jones again blasted over 30 home runs and drove 
in 104 runs but his average dipped to .251 while his strikeouts increased. 
Jones played better in 2002 and 2003 and made the All-Star team in both 
seasons. However, Jones struggled in 2004 and failed to hit at least 30 
home runs for the first time since 1999. His strikeouts begun to exceed 
100 regularly. However, in 2005, he led the league with 51 home runs and 
also led the NL with 128 RBIs. He finished 2nd to Albert Pujols for National 
League MVP. Critics argued his batting average being low was the main reason 
he finished 2nd. His average continued to dip and strikeouts raised. In 
2006, Jones batted .262 with 41 home runs and 129 RBI. In 2007, in his 
last season with the Braves, Jones had the worst season of his career. 
He batted just .222 with 26 home runs and 94 RBIs. Having gained weight 
and alleged as being lazy, friction emerged on Jones and his future status 
with Atlanta. During his time with Atlanta, Jones became one of the youngest 
in MLB history to reach 300 home runs. After the 2007 season, Jones signed 
with the Los Angeles Dodgers as a free agent to a 2-year deal, worth $36.2 
million. However, Jones struggled with the Dodgers, batting just .158 with 
3 home runs and 14 RBIs. Shortly after the season, Jones was released by 
the Dodgers. Since then, Jones has played for the Texas Rangers, Chicago 
White Sox, and New York Yankees. While with the White Sox, Jones belted 
his 400th career home run. Jones was born on April 23, 1977 in the capital 
city of Willemstad on the Caribbean island nation of Curaçao. By the age 
of 11, Jones was on a youth select team that traveled all the way to Japan 
to play in a tournament. He could handle any position on the field, but 
because of his powerful arm, Jones often found himself at catcher or third 
base. He switched to the outfield a couple of years later. Stories of Andruw's 
early accomplishments are the stuff of legend. As a 13-year-old, playing 
for his father's Royal Scorpions team, he sent a ball screaming over 400 
feet to the tennis court of a nearby hotel. In the same game, Andruw came 
up again and hit the hotel. By his early teens, he was competing against 
adults. He even played on Curaçao's national team in the Latin American 
Games. By the time Andruw turned 15, he was the best player on the island. 
He had yet to be discovered, however, for Curaçao was still well off the 
beaten path for major league scouts—even though countryman Hensley Meulens 
had done well in the New York Yankee farm system. Jones signed with the 
Atlanta Braves organization as a free agent in 1993 at the age of 16.[1] 
Jones would be promoted to Danville of the Appalachian League after only 
27 games with the Braves farm team in West Palm Beach, Florida. Jones would 
play for Class-A Macon in 1995. In his first at bat, he belted a homer. 
He would finish the season with 25 home runs and 100 runs batted in. Jones 
also led the South Atlantic League with 56 steals. His outstanding season 
was capped off when he was named Minor League Player of the Year. The Braves 
brought Jones up to Atlanta on August 15, 1996, when he was just 19 years 
old. In his first career Major League game, Jones went 1 for 5 with a run 
batted in and a runs scored. In his second game, he went 2 for 5 with a 
home run and a triple. He had his first multi-homer game against the Reds 
on August 22. He spent his early time in the majors playing in right field 
because established center fielders Marquis Grissom and Kenny Lofton were 
already entrenched in the position. He would finish the season batting 
.217 with 5 home runs and 13 RBIs. In the National League Championship 
Series against the Cardinals, Jones batted .222 with a home run and 3 RBIs. 
The Braves would win the Series and advance to the World Series. In Game 
1 of the 1996 World Series on October 20, 1996, Jones was able to demonstrate 
his talents on the national stage. He connected for two home runs to left 
field on his first two at bats as the Braves routed the New York Yankees 
12–1. Jones became the youngest player ever to homer in the World Series[2] 
at the age of 19 years, 180 days, breaking Mickey Mantle's record of 20 
years, 362 days – on what would have been Mantle's 65th birthday. Jones 
joined Gene Tenace as the only other player to hit home runs in his first 
two World Series at bats. Tenace did it in 1972 with the Oakland Athletics. 
Jones was selected to the Braves' post-season roster in 1996. During the 
1996 World Series he became the youngest player in history to hit a home 
run in the World Series at the age of 19. Jones became the Braves' everyday 
right fielder in 1997. Jones hit his first home run of the season against 
Jeff McCurry of the Rockies. Jones had his first multi-homer game against 
the Cubs on July 22. On August 31, Jones went 3 for 3 with a home run and 
5 runs batted in a game against the Boston Red Sox. Jones finished his 
rookie season with a .231 batting average, 18 home runs, and 70 runs batted 
in. Jones also showed his speed by stealing 20 bases. He finished 5th in 
Rookie of the Year voting. In 1998, he moved to center field nearly full-time, 
and had a much more encouraging season. His average improved to .271, he 
hit 31 homers, and stole 27 bases. He hit his 30th home run of the season 
against Florida on September 13. He also won his first of ten straight 
Gold Glove Awards. In the 1998 National League Division Series, Jones went 
0 for 9 but did draw 3 walks. The Braves would win the series against the 
Cubs. In the 1998 NLCS against the San Diego Padres, Jones batted .273 
with a home run and 2 RBIs. However, The Braves would lose the series in 
6 games. Whether he was in the batter's box or gliding under a fly ball 
to make an easy basket catch, Jones played the game in a very relaxed manner.[3] 
This temporarily earned him the ire of manager Bobby Cox in June 1998 in 
an incident in which Cox pulled Jones out of a game, in the midst of an 
inning, because he felt Jones had lazily allowed a single to drop in center 
field. Jones would go on to hit .271 with 31 home runs and 90 runs batted 
in. Jones would also steal 27 bases. Still just 22 years old, Jones had 
similar numbers in 1999, and though he was a dependable (he played all 
162 games that season) and a good player, many began to wonder if or when 
he would live up to the potential that they believed he possessed. He had 
a moderate-breakout season with his bat in 2000 with career highs up until 
that point in batting average (.303), home runs (36), and RBIs (104). He 
also earned his first All-Star Game appearance. He would also led the National 
League in Plate Appearances (729) and At Bats (656). Jones would struggle 
in the National League Division Series against the Cardinals. He would 
go 1 for 9 with a home run. The Braves would lose the series. However, 
in 2001, Jones' batting average fell and his strikeouts went up. Jones 
finished with 34 home runs and 104 RBIs but his average dropped to only 
.251 and he struck out 142 times. By now, Jones had gained nearly 30 pounds 
since arriving at the Major Leagues, greatly diminishing his speed on the 
basepaths (he would not steal more than 11 bases after 2001).[4] He maintained 
a similar batting performance in 2002, but was still playing superb defense. 
He would hit 35 home runs and 94 RBIs. Jones would have some great games 
in September. On September 7, he belted 2 home runs in his last 2 at-bats. 
In his first 2 at-bats on September 10, he belted 2 more home runs. He 
became the 11th player in history to homer in 4 straight at-bats. Then 
on September 25, Jones belted 3 home runs against the Phillies. Jones became 
the first Braves player to hit 3 home runs in a game since Jeff Blauser 
did it in 1992. Jones was named to his second All Star team. In 2003, with 
the power-hitting Gary Sheffield in the line-up, Jones achieved a new career 
high-water mark in RBIs, with 116. Jones would make his third All Star 
team and later homer in the game. The American League would beat the National 
League, 7–6. Unfortunately, he took a step backward in 2004 when he hit 
fewer than 30 homers and struck out 147 times. During the season, Jones 
was the subject of trade rumors.[5][6] Prior to the 2005 season, Jones 
increased his workout regimen and, following advice given by Willie Mays, 
widened his batting stance.[7] The result was his most productive offensive 
season ever. After Chipper Jones went down with an injury early in 2005, 
Jones would carry the Braves. By the All Star break, Jones was leading 
the National League in home runs with 27. Jones was named to the All Star 
team, the fourth of his career. Jones would hit his 40th home run of the 
season on August 23 in a loss against the Cubs. It marked the first time 
in his career that he hit at least 40 home runs in a season. Jones became 
the first Braves hitter to hit 40 home runs in a season since Javy Lopez 
did it in 2003. On September 14, 2005, Jones hit his 300th career home 
run which went 430 feet (130 m) off Philadelphia Phillies reliever Geoff 
Geary in a 12–4 Phillies win.[8] The ball landed in the upper deck in left 
field at Citizens Bank Park.[9] Jones became the first hitter since Alex 
Rodriguez (57) and Jim Thome (52) to hit at least 50 home runs in a season. 
Jones also became the 12th player in history to hit 300 home runs before 
his 30th birthday. Jones hit a major league-leading 51 home runs, surpassing 
Hank Aaron's and Eddie Mathews' single-season club record, and winning 
the Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[10] He also led the National League with 
a career-high 128 RBI. Jones' torrid hitting in the summer, especially 
while teammate Chipper Jones was out with an injury, helped carry the Braves 
to their 14th consecutive division championship. He finished just behind 
St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman Albert Pujols in the 2005 NL MVP vote. 
In the 2005 National League Divisional Series against the Houston Astros, 
Jones hit .471 with a home run and 5 RBIs. However, the Astros would take 
the series, 3–1. Before the 2006 season, Jones played in the World Baseball 
Classic for the Netherlands. Jones started the season by hitting a home 
run off a pitch from Derek Lowe. Jones finished the game by going 2 for 
4 with a home run, 4 runs batted in, a strikeout, and a base on balls. 
The Braves won the game, 11–10. From April 16 through April 19, Jones homered 
in 4 consecutive games. During that stretch, he batted .438 with 5 home 
runs and 8 runs batted in. Jones finished the month of April with a .281 
average, 8 home runs and 23 runs batted in (RBI). Jones would match his 
career high with 6 runs batted in on July 18 against the Cardinals. He 
also went 5 for 5 with 2 home runs. On August 29, in a game against the 
Giants, Jones drove in 3 runs, which gave him his 1000th career RBI.[citation 
needed] On September 26, in a game against the New York Mets, Jones hit 
his 40th home run of the season. He became the first hitter in Atlanta's 
history to have consecutive seasons of at least 40 homers. Jones finished 
the 2006 season with 41 home runs and 129 RBIs. Jones also became more 
selective at the plate (82 walks, as compared to 64 the prior season), 
which helped him score 107 runs during 2006, an increase of 12 over the 
prior year and his most in a single season since 2000. He won his ninth 
consecutive Gold Glove award. The Braves would go on to finish with a 79–83 
record and missed the postseason for the first time since 1990. Coming 
into the last year of his contract with the Braves, many fans and sports 
analysts alike felt that 2007 would be the last year in which Jones would 
be a Brave, mostly because of his potential value on the market that the 
Braves would not be able to afford. Jones, however, had an unexpectedly 
poor start to the season, striking out 51 times in 41 games and carrying 
a batting average in the low .200s for the majority of April and May. On 
April 30, Jones hit a three-run walk-off home run against the Philadelphia 
Phillies. On May 28, Jones hit his 350th career homer off Chris Capuano. 
After the All-Star break, Jones continued to have productive power numbers; 
however, his batting average remained poor. He was honored with a Fielding 
Bible Award as the best fielding center fielder in MLB.[11] Jones finished 
the 2007 season with 26 home runs and 94 RBIs. On the downside, Jones hit 
only .222 and struck out a career high 138 times. On October 2, the Braves 
announced they would not be bringing Jones back for the 2008 season.[12] 
On December 5, 2007, Jones agreed to a two-year deal with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, worth $36.2 million.[13] After showing up out of shape and over 
20 pounds overweight, he continued to struggle, hitting below .200 for 
most of the season. Additionally, he had only 10 hits in 116 at-bats with 
runners in scoring position. Due to his lack of production, Jones was dropped 
to eighth in the Dodger line-up. This was the first time since 1998 that 
Jones had hit eighth in any line-up. Jones was put on the disabled list 
for the first time in his entire career on May 25, 2008. He had knee surgery 
after injuring his knee during batting practice earlier that day.[14] On 
July 27, 2008, the Dodgers manager Joe Torre benched Jones and said that 
he would only be used as a spot starter in the future. At that time, Jones 
had a .166 batting average, two home runs and 12 RBIs combined with an 
incredible 68 strikeouts in 187 at-bats.[15][16] On September 13, 2008, 
Jones was put on the 60-day disabled list, putting an end to his very disappointing 
season with the Dodgers. Jones finished the season with a .158 batting 
average, just three home runs, and 14 RBI. He was not seen in the dugout 
during any of the postseason games, nor the celebrations in the locker 
rooms, since he had been removed from the playoff roster and sent home 
for the winter.[17] Jones stated that he did not wish to return to the 
Dodgers in 2009, saying that the Los Angeles fans did not give him a fair 
chance. During the 2009 off-season, the Dodgers reached an agreement with 
Jones to trade or release him before spring training in exchange for a 
deferral of some of the remaining money due on his contract. On January 
15, 2009, Jones was officially released by the Dodgers.[18] On February 
8, 2009, Jones signed a one-year minor league contract with the Texas Rangers; 
the deal paid him $500,000 for making the major league team, and offered 
$1 million in incentives.[19] Jones reportedly turned down a similar offer 
from the New York Yankees to compete for their center field job[20] and 
expressed an interest in staying with the Rangers even though he would 
likely not be a starter.[21] He earned the Rangers' final roster spot.[22] 
He was originally intended to be a pinch-hitter for the Rangers, but found 
a starting outfield role due to an injury to Josh Hamilton.[22] Jones would 
go 3 for 5 in his Rangers debut with a RBI and 2 runs scored. In his next 
game, Jones went 2 for 3 and scored 2 runs. He also hit his first home 
run as a member of the Rangers in the seventh inning off of Danys Báez. 
By the end of April, Jones was batting .344 with 3 home runs and 6 runs 
batted in.[16] Jones was also faced with an opportunity to play against 
his old club, the Dodgers. Jones would play 2 games against them on June 
13 and 14, homering in each game. On July 4, Jones went 2 for 5 with a 
home run and 4 runs batted in against the Rays. On July 8, in a game against 
the Angels, Jones hit 3 home runs and drove in 4 runs in an 8-1 win. It 
was his second career 3-homer game. Jones had a chance to hit his fourth 
home run of the game in his final 2 at-bats, but he popped out and struck 
out. "I was thinking about it. I tried. I just didn’t get it done," Jones 
said. "I’m just happy we won."[23] Jones ultimately hit only .214 for the 
season, but did have 17 home runs in 82 games.[16] On November 25, 2009, 
Jones signed a $500,000 deal for 2010 with up to an additional $1 million 
in performance bonuses. Unlike what he had done with the Braves and Dodgers 
in previous seasons, Jones showed up to camp in shape, a full 30 pounds 
under his previous weight.[24] On April 23, 2010, Jones hit two home runs 
on his 33rd birthday, including a walk-off to help the White Sox win 7–6 
over the Seattle Mariners. On July 11, he hit his 400th career home run.[25] 
He finished the year with nineteen home runs in 278 at-bats. He scored 
41 runs, had 48 RBI and 64 base hits in 107 games, the most games he has 
appeared in since 2007. On January 20, 2011, Jones and the New York Yankees 
agreed to a contract for the 2011 season for $2 million, with an additional 
$1.2 million in performance bonuses.[26][27] In his first Yankees at-bat 
on April 5, 2011, Jones hit a home run over the left field wall at Yankee 
Stadium off the Minnesota Twins' Brian Duensing. Jones finished the season 
with a .247 average, 13 home runs and 33 runs batted in. He became a free 
agent after the World Series. Jones re-signed with the Yankees for the 
2012 season on December 30, 2011. The deal is a one-year deal worth $2 
million. He was slated to be a backup. However, due to Brett Gardner's 
DL stint, Jones received more starts than anticipated. Jones played very 
well in the first half of the season hitting 12 home runs in his first 
62 games, including three over the course of a double header in Boston, 
but in August and September he hit only .139 with two home runs over his 
final 32 games.[28] On December 7, 2012, Jones agreed to a one-year ¥300 
million (approximately US$3.5 million) contract with the Tohoku Rakuten 
Golden Eagles of Japan's Pacific League.[29][30][31] He finished the regular 
season with 26 home runs in 478 at-bats. He scored 81 runs, had 94 RBI, 
116 base hits and 105 walks in 143 games, helping Eagles to clinch their 
first Pacific League Championship. His steady performance would continue 
in post-season, including two home runs in the 2013 Pacific League Climax 
Series and one in the 2013 Japan Series respectively, which played a key 
role in the Eagles' Japan Series win. After the season, Jones re-signed 
with Rakuten for the 2014 season, agreeing to a one-year contract worth 
¥400 million (approximately US$3.8 million).[32] In his two years with 
Rakuten, Jones hit 50 home runs and played primarily at designated hitter, 
however he played 48 games at first base, far more than the eight he played 
in his career before coming to Japan. Since playing in Japan, Jones attempted 
comebacks in both the 2015 and 2016 MLB seasons.[33][34] He officially 
retired from baseball in February 2016 and was hired by the Braves as a 
special assistant later that month.[35][36] As at end of the 2012 season, 
Jones owned a career .254 average, with 434 home runs, and 1,289 runs batted 
in. He currently ranks at 40 on the career home run list. However, Jones' 
weakness has been hitting against the breaking ball and hitting for good 
average. Only once in his career has Jones batted .300 or better (he batted 
.303 in 2000), and since 2007 – the year he turned 30 – he has hit just 
.214. Jones was also known for his speed early in his career. In fact, 
his speed earned him the last playoff spot on the Braves' roster in 1996. 
Jones stole 20+ bases from 1997 to 2000. However, his speed declined as 
he hit for more power. Jones has not stolen at least 10 bases since he 
stole 11 in 2001. This could also be contributed to a noticeable weight 
gain with Jones. Also, since 2000 due to his power numbers going up, he 
has been almost trained to hit only fastballs. Jones also owned the lowest 
batting average (since broken by Jose Bautista in 2010), slugging percentage, 
on-base percentage, and runs scored in a season for a hitter that belted 
50+ home runs in a season. Jones hit 51 in 2005 but batted just .263, with 
a .575 slugging, .347 on base, and 95 runs scored. From 1998 to 2007, Jones 
won 10 consecutive Gold Gloves. His 10 Gold Gloves for an outfielder ranks 
him in a tie for second with Al Kaline, Ichiro Suzuki, and Ken Griffey 
Jr. for most Gold Gloves won by an outfielder. Jones is also one of five 
center fielders to record at least 400 putouts in a season six times. The 
others are Willie Mays, Richie Ashburn, Kirby Puckett, and Max Carey. Being 
born in Curaçao allowed Jones to be eligible for the Netherlands national 
baseball team during their participation in the inaugural World Baseball 
Classic in 2006. Jones would later join the team again for the 2013 World 
Baseball Classic. Two years later, in 2015, Jones was selected to play 
with the National Dutch team as a first baseman for the 2015 Premier 12. 
He later announced that those were his final games as a player.[37] Jones 
is married to Nicole Derick. They are the parents of one son, Druw, and 
one daughter, Madison. He has one daughter, Andrianna, with April Caraway. 
Early on the morning of Christmas Day, 2012, Jones was arrested for battery 
after police officers responded to a domestic disturbance call between 
him and his wife Nicole in suburban Atlanta. He was released on $2,400 
bond late that morning.[38] Nicole Jones filed for Divorce in early January
