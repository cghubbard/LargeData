Richard Allen Helling (born December 15, 1970) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher. Helling attended Lakota High School in Lakota, North 
Dakota for three years, before graduating from Shanley High School in Fargo, 
North Dakota. He was a letterman in football, basketball, and baseball. 
In football, he was a three-time All-Conference honoree. Helling played 
college ball at Stanford University. While there he joined Delta Tau Delta 
International Fraternity. He was selected by the Texas Rangers in the 1st 
round of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft. Writer Chuck Klosterman 
describes Rick Helling as his personal archenemy.[1] Helling was an early 
critic of performance-enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball, warning 
the Players Union as early as 1998 that drugs were a problem in the sport; 
he served as a Union Executive Board Member from 1999 to 2007.[2] Helling 
was a member of two World Series Championship teams: the 1997 World Series 
Champion Florida Marlins and the 2003 World Series Champion Florida Marlins. 
Despite being traded to the Texas Rangers earlier in the 1997 season, which 
meant he did not participate in the Marlins' World Series win that year, 
he was awarded a World Series ring by his former teammates because of his 
half-season contribution. In 1998 he won five straight games on the road; 
no Texas pitcher matched that accomplishment until Scott Feldman surpassed 
it in 2009.[3] Helling had his best season in 1998 going 20–7, tying for 
the American League lead in wins with David Cone and Roger Clemens. His 
11 road victories in 1998 set a club record, later matched by Vicente Padilla 
(2008) and surpassed by Feldman (2009).[4][5][6] In 1999, Helling started 
35 games for the Rangers, going 13-11 while leading the majors with 41 
home runs allowed. In 2000, Helling broke a 30-year-old record by giving 
up 66 doubles. One year later, he broke his record by allowing 68 doubles. 
In 2001, Helling led the majors in hits allowed (256), earned runs (124) 
and home runs allowed (38). Helling signed a one-year deal with the Diamondbacks 
in 2002.[7][8][9] In his lone season with Arizona, Helling went 10-12 in 
30 starts. After the season, Helling signed with the Baltimore Orioles.[10][11] 
Helling spent half the season in Baltimore before being traded back to 
the Florida Marlins. Helling did not pitch in 2004 due to injury. On June 
20, 2006, Helling struck out three batters on nine pitches—Curtis Granderson, 
Plácido Polanco and Iván Rodríguez—in the first inning of a 10–1 loss to 
the Detroit Tigers, thereby becoming the 38th pitcher in major league history 
to throw an immaculate inning. On February 5, 2007, he announced his retirement 
to spend more time with his family.[12] On March 17, 2009, he was hired 
as a special assistant to the head of the Major League Baseball Players 
Association, Donald Fehr.[13] He currently resides in Minneapolis–Saint
