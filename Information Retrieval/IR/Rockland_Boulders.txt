The Rockland Boulders are an American independent professional baseball 
team based in Pomona, New York in Rockland County.They are a member of 
the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball, also known 
as the Can-Am League. The team was one of three teams joining the league 
for the 2011 season, joining former Atlantic League champions the Newark 
Bears and New York State League team the New York Federals. The Boulders 
played their first game on May 26, 2011, against the Bears at Bears & Eagles 
Riverfront Stadium. The team played their first home game at Provident 
Bank Park on June 16 defeating the Brockton Rox, 3-1 in front of a sold-out 
crowd. The "Boulders" name refers to Rockland County's plethora of boulders 
in its landscape. The team's primary color, blue, alludes to the former 
Brooklyn Dodgers, which held their spring training events at Bear Mountain 
State Park during the 1940s. The red honors the neighboring Rockland County 
Fire Training Center. Boulder Bird is the official team mascot and "disco" 
Seth Cantor is the teams play-by-play announcer. On May 26, 2011 the Boulders 
won their first official game by a score of 11-5 over the Newark Bears 
after coming back from a 4-1 deficit. On July 24, 2011, in the bottom of 
the ninth inning with two outs, Joe Hage (23) hit a walk-off grand slam 
at Le Stade Municipal in Quebec City, Canada to give Rockland a 7-4 win 
over the Quebec Capitales. It was the first grand-slam in Boulders history. 
On September 4, 2011, the Boulders announced they had signed former New 
York Mets player Howard Johnson to a two-game contract to play alongside 
his son, Glen. Both games were played against the Newark Bears.[1] Although 
the Boulders played their first 20 games away due to construction of the 
new stadium, they finished their inaugural season second in the league 
with an attendance of 123,518 tickets sold. The Rockland Boulders signed 
their first three players Tommy Giles, Eric Flynn and Ryan Mollica, from 
Suffern in its history in March, 2011. Of these three, Mollica remained 
and played in 86 games. On August 22, 2013, Boulder's pitcher Charlie Law 
pitched a complete game no-hitter defeating the New Jersey Jackals with 
the first no-hitter in franchise history. On July 7, 2014, Outfielder Jerod 
Edmondson singled off Ryan Bollinger of the Trois-Rivieres Aigles in the 
top of the fourth inning at Trois-Rivières, breaking the all-time Can-Am 
League record for career hits. His 700 career hits breaks the record previously 
held by current Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Chris Colabello.[2] On August 
25, 2014, the Boulders beat the Trois-Riveres Aigles and clinched the playoffs 
for the first time in the franchise's history. The Boulders will play the 
New Jersey Jackals the first round.[3] On September 2, 2014 The best-of-7 
Parkway Series between the Rockland Boulders (Palisades Interstate Parkway) 
and the New Jersey Jackals (Garden State Parkway) began. The Boulders captured 
their first league championship beating New Jersey 4 games to 2.[4] The 
Rockland Boulder's new Palisades Credit Union Park, originally known as 
Provident Bank Park (name change was announced on Monday, April 25, 2016) 
voted on by the league's eight field managers and media representatives 
as the 2011 Can-Am League Playing Surface of the Year, contains 4,500 seats, 
16 luxury and 11 loge boxes. The dimensions of the playing field are 323 
foot left-field line, power alleys of 383 feet leading to the 403 foot 
center wall and 313 foot right-field line. The park also includes a 34-foot 
x 52 foot scoreboard, as well as a 75-foot ribbon sign board. Other features 
include special hearing-impaired seating with loudspeakers installed under 
each seat, Kids Zone playground, and community rooms beside food courts 
and kiosks. The park also contains an indoor batting cage used by players 
to warm up prior to games and is open to the public during the game. Baseball 
fans that visit Palisades Credit Union Park may notice a similarity to 
Camden Yards, Fenway Park, and Citi Field as the park is partly designed 
after those stadiums. On September 4, 2011, the Rockland Boulders played 
to the largest crowd in its inaugural season - 6,300 fans - to see former 
New York Met Howard Johnson become one of the few players to have the opportunity 
to play in a professional game with their son. In 2012 the Boulders led 
the league in attendance with 161,375 fans. On August 17, 2014, the team 
drew 6,239 fans. The Boulders have three radio stations that provide broadcasts 
of their games. The stations are WNBR 1260 AM, WLNA 1420 AM, and WRCR 1600 
AM.[5] The Boulders games are also available to watch online on the Can-Am 
league TV website and some games on Optimum channel 78 in Rockland County 
or FIOS channel 1. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches
