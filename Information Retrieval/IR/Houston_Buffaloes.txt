The Houston Buffaloes, Houston Buffalos, or Buffs were an American minor 
league baseball team, and were the first minor league team to be affiliated 
with a Major League franchise, which was the St. Louis Cardinals. The club 
was founded in 1888, and played in the Texas League at various levels throughout 
the majority of its existence. From 1959 through 1961, the team played 
in the American Association at the Triple-A level as an affiliate of the 
Chicago Cubs. The Buffaloes derived their nickname from Buffalo Bayou, 
the principal waterway through Houston. The team's last home was Buffalo 
Stadium, built in 1928. Before that, they played at West End Park from 
1905–1928, and at Herald Park prior to that. The Houston Buffaloes were 
purchased by the Houston Sports Association in 1961 to obtain Houston-area 
territorial rights for the Major League Houston Colt .45s (known since 
1965 as the Houston Astros). Several of those associated with the Buffaloes 
continued with the major league team including manager Harry Craft. The 
Buffaloes organization then ended their relationship with the Cubs, and 
became a Triple-A affiliate of the Colt. 45s. For the 1962 season they 
were reorganized and moved to become the Oklahoma City 89ers, which are 
known today as the Oklahoma City Dodgers. On April 11, 1861, a baseball 
team in Houston was organized at a meeting held in the Palmer Building 
above J.H. Evans' dry goods store.[1] The team was simply known as the 
"Houston Base Ball Club".[2] However, it is unknown if the Houston Base 
Ball Club played any games. The American Civil War began shortly thereafter, 
and there was a great lack of organized sports during this time.[1] Following 
the war, a newspaper article in The Daily Telegraph was published that 
detailed the first baseball game by a Houston team.[1] The Houston Stonewalls 
defeated the Galveston Robert E. Lees at the site of the San Jacinto Battleground 
in what was dubbed as the Texas "State Championship" on April 21, 1868 
(San Jacinto Day). The Stonewalls uniform was described as consisting of 
a red cap, white flannel shirt, and black pants. In 1884, a league of primarily 
amateur teams was organized by Samuel L. Haine known as the "Texas League".[3] 
The Houston Nationals represented the city along with Galveston, Dallas, 
Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Waco. Although 2–3 players per team were paid, 
most of the league players were strictly amateur. Houston's first professional 
baseball club was officially organized by a large group of local leaders 
on December 31, 1887.[4] Judge E. P. Hill served as president.[4] The Houston 
Buffaloes began their first season in 1888 under the name "Houston Babies". 
The unusual name stemmed from the fact that they were the last to join 
the new Texas League.[5] Uniform colors were described as "maroon and light 
blue" in a news article.[6] The Houston Babies played their first game 
ever against the Cincinnati Red Stockings at Houston Base Ball Park on 
March 6, 1888 in exhibition play, where they lost by a score of 8–2.[7] 
The first game of the Texas League was played between Houston and the Galveston 
Giants in Houston on April 1, 1888, in which the Babies proved to be victorious 
in a 4–1 score.[8] This first season was financially difficult for the 
Texas League, and although the season was scheduled to last from April 
through mid-October 1888, Houston, along with every other team by this 
point, was forced to bow-out by early September.".[9] On July 23, 1888, 
during mid-season, the team was completely reorganized at an evening meeting 
of stockholders at Houston City Hall. Robert Adair, who had served as financial 
secretary and Texas League president until this point,[4] purchased the 
majority stake in the club for $1,000 USD which was effective the next 
day.[10] Samuel Haine was then replaced as general manager by Pat Farrell.[11] 
1889 was a productive season for Houston. Coming from San Antonio to the 
Magnolia City as manager of the team was John McCloskey. McCloskey had 
been the chief founder of the Texas League the year prior,[12] and helped 
the club attain their first finish as champions of the league.[13] Renamed 
as the "Mud Cats", Houston was still not without financial difficulty. 
Despite winning the Texas League in play, the Mud Cats were withheld the 
pennant until they paid their overdue membership fees for the season. McCloskey 
remained with Houston for the next season, but in 1891, the Texas League 
did not play due to an inability to get financial backing.[14][15] Without 
a league to play, Houston did not field a team. Despite McCloskey's return 
to Houston, a second title for the team, and a successful reorganization 
of the Texas League for 1892, the league remained unstable. The next two 
seasons it ceased to exist, and the club followed suit. 1895 saw the return 
of the Houston ball club. With McCloskey moving to manage his hometown 
Louisville Colonels of the National League, Houston promoted player Ollie 
Pickering to manage the team. Pickering was known for having hit the most 
singles in a single game in 1892, and originated the "Texas Leaguer" term.[16] 
A pattern of continuously changing names persisted, and the 1895 Houston 
team named themselves the "Magnolias" after the nickname of the city.[17] 
Following the season, a group of Houston businessmen consisting of President 
John Henry Kirby, Vice-President Si Packard, and Secretary/Treasurer Sam 
Taub, created the Houston Baseball Association, and took ownership of the 
team. With a history of financial instability in Houston's previous years, 
the Houston Baseball Association's purpose was to support and maintain 
the club. The next season heralded more change for the team, as Pickering 
was called up to the big league by former manager McCloskey to play for 
the Louisville Colonels. The 1896 season was the first in which the club 
would be known by the name of the "Houston Buffaloes".[18] First baseman 
Charlie "Jugger" Shaffer took over as manager, and the Buffaloes claimed 
their third league title. From 1900 through 1902 Houston did not field 
a team, as the Texas League was again plagued by instability. However, 
in November 1902, new owner Claude Rielly revived the club when another 
league was formed for the next season.[19] The club decided to continue 
as a member of the new rival to the Texas League known as the South Texas 
League along with Galveston, Beaumont, and San Antonio. Finishing with 
a 3rd-place league record for the 1903 season, Houston hired Wade Moore 
during the 1904 season, who had led San Antonio to the league title as 
a manager prior. For this season, the club continued as the "Lambs".[20] 
Although performing well for the beginning, the team discovered that their 
home stadium, the Houston Base Ball Park would be demolished in the middle 
of their season.[21] Evicted by June 1904, the team was forced to move 
to an old horseracing track near Harrisburg Boulevard known as Harrisburg 
Park.[22] At the time, the city's streetcars did not reach to this part 
of Houston, and fans were forced to ride the rest of the way in horse-drawn 
carts. With such a hassle for fans, attendance dropped dramatically, and 
the club was quickly losing money with rent to the racetrack.[21] Instead 
of maintaining a home field in Houston, the team eventually opted to finish 
the rest of its season on the road, but Houston was ordered by league president 
Bliss Gorham to continue playing at home. Rielly complied, but by this 
time, the team became popularly known as the "Wanderers" in the local newspapers.[21] 
1905 marked a point of stabilization for the franchise as reflected by 
the team's name, which remained as the "Houston Buffaloes" until their 
demise. A stark contrast from the previous season, the Buffaloes began 
playing in a brand new ballpark known as "West End Park". Under Wade Moore, 
the team took the 1905 South Texas League championship, which was their 
first since 1896. On October 27, 1908, Claude Rielly officially sold the 
Houston Buffaloes to Otto Sens and J. Doak Roberts.[23] With new ownership, 
veteran big leaguer Hunter Hill, who had played with the St. Louis Browns 
and Washington Senators, was hired as a first-year manager.[24] The 1909 
season started with an exhibition series between the Buffaloes and Hill's 
former team, the St. Louis Browns. Hill then led the team to two consecutive 
Texas League pennants for the 1909 and 1910 seasons. It was the first time 
that Houston claimed back-to-back championships in its history. In 1919, 
the St. Louis Cardinals purchased an eighteen percent stake in the Houston 
Buffaloes,[25] and in 1921 purchased a majority stake in the club. This 
made Houston the first affiliated minor league baseball club. From 1921–58, 
the Buffaloes were an important farm team of the Cardinals at the Class 
A, A1 and AA levels. During that period, star players such as brothers 
Dizzy Dean and Paul Dean, Solly Hemus, Vinegar Bend Mizell, Hal Epps, Don 
Gutteridge, Al Papai, Joe Medwick, Frank O. Mancuso, Harry Brecheen and 
Howie Pollet prepped in Houston on their way to the major leagues. 1928 
was another landmark season for the ball club. With stars like on the roster 
like Red Worthington, Carey Selph, George Watkins, Ray Powell, Bubber Jonnard, 
Heinie Schuble, Tex Carleton, and Frank Snyder, the Houston Buffaloes took 
the Texas League championship that year. Pitcher Bill Hallahan led the 
league in strikeouts that season with a 2.25 ERA. They then progressed 
to their first ever interleague Dixie Series against the Southern Association 
champions, the Birmingham Barons where they won that series as well. West 
End Park was sold to the Houston Independent School District in 1928, and 
the Buffaloes moved into a brand new Buffalo Stadium on the opposite end 
of town. The Buffaloes and Buffalo Stadium were depicted in the 1952 film 
The Pride of St. Louis detailing Hall of Fame pitcher Dizzy Dean's minor 
league career with the Houston team. In the 1931 season, led by former 
Cardinals outfielder Joe Schultz, Sr., the Buffaloes' had 108 regular-season 
victories (in 159 games) and won the Texas League championship.[26] The 
Buffaloes' most notable period came between 1939–41, when, as a Cardinal 
farm managed by Eddie Dyer and laden with talent, they won three straight 
Texas League pennants, winning 97, 105 and 103 regular-season games in 
the process. In addition to the Texas League championship pennants, the 
Buffaloes also won the Dixie Series against the Southern Association champions 
in 1928 (4–2 over the Birmingham Barons), 1947 (4–2 over the Mobile Bears), 
1956 (4–2 over the Atlanta Crackers), and 1957 (4–2 over the Atlanta Crackers). 
From 1950 until the Buffs' final outing in 1961, veteran radio broadcaster 
Loel Passe was the "Voice of the Buffs". During the 1959 season, a young 
television reporter with ABC affiliate KTRK-TV, Dan Rather, sat in with 
Passe as the play-by-play announcer for the Buffs' radio broadcast. Then 
in the final season of the Houston Buffaloes, Passe was joined in the booth 
by Ford Frick Award winner Gene Elston who went on to lead the broadcast 
for the Colt .45s and Houston Astros from 1962 to 1986. In 1959, the Buffs 
severed ties with the Cardinals to move up to the Triple-A level, and then 
began an affiliation with the Chicago Cubs. At the same time, the City 
of Houston, through a group of local business leaders known as the "Houston 
Sports Association", was selected as one of the eight members of a planned 
"third major league", the Continental League, but plans eventually fell 
through after team owner Marty Marion could not come to an agreement to 
sell the team.[27] The Continental League as a whole folded in August 1960, 
and Marion sold the team to a group led by William Hopkins on August 16, 
1960.[28] However, on October 17, 1960, the National League granted an 
expansion franchise to the Houston Sports Association in which their team 
could begin play in the 1962 season. According to the Major League Baseball 
Constitution, the Houston Sports Association was required to obtain territorial 
rights from the Houston Buffaloes in order to play in the Houston area, 
and again negotiations began to purchase the team.[29][30] Eventually, 
the Houston Sports Association purchased the Houston Buffaloes from William 
Hopkins on January 17, 1961.[31][32] The purchase price for the team was 
$393,000 USD.[33] Additionally, the HSA was forced to pay $200,000 USD 
to the American Association because of their removal from the league.[33] 
The Buffs played one last minor league season as the top farm team of the 
Chicago Cubs in 1961 before being succeeded by the city's NL club, the 
Colt .45s (known since 1965 as the Houston Astros). Many of those associated 
with the Houston Buffaloes organization were allowed by the ownership to 
continue in the major league. Manager Harry Craft, who had joined Houston 
in 1961, remained in the same position for the team until the end of the 
1964 season.[34] General manager Spec Richardson also continued with the 
organization as business manager, but was later promoted again to the same 
position with the Astros from 1967 until 1975. Although most players for 
the major league franchise were obtained through the 1961 Major League 
Baseball expansion draft, Buffs players J.C. Hartman, Pidge Browne, Jim 
Campbell, Ron Davis, Dave Giusti, and Dave Roberts were chosen to continue 
as major league ball players at some point throughout the 1962 season. 
In 1963, Aaron Pointer was promoted as well. Similarly, the radio broadcasting 
team remained with the new Houston major league franchise. Loel Passe worked 
alongside Gene Elston as a color commentator until he retired from broadcasting 
in 1976. Elston continued with the Astros until 1986. After being purchased 
by Houston's major league club, the Buffaloes organization served as their 
Triple-A affiliate, but were reorganized and moved to become the Oklahoma 
City 89ers,[35] which have been known since 2014 as the Oklahoma City Dodgers.[36] 
Eventually, the Astros sold the team to Tulsa businessman, P. C. Dixon, 
in November 1970.[37] However, Oklahoma City remained affiliated with the 
Astros through the 1972 season.[38] Beginning in the 2011 season, the Oklahoma 
City club again became the Astros' Triple-A affiliate, but that affiliation 
ended three years later. The Houston Buffaloes had many associated with 
them who were inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame including 
Dizzy Dean who played for the team from 1930–1931, "Ducky" Joe Medwick 
who played from 1931–1932, Chick Hafey who played for 1924, Jim Bottomley 
who played for 1921, and Tris Speaker who played for 1907. Commentator 
Gene Elston, who worked with the Buffaloes in 1961, was awarded the Ford 
C. Frick Award in 2006. Prior to 1919, it was not a practice of Minor League 
teams to be affiliated with Major League clubs. In 1959, Houston became 
independent of any Major League club, but became affiliates of the Chicago 
Cubs for their last two seasons. It was common at one time for higher level
