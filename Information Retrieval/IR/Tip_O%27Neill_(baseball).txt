James Edward "Tip" O'Neill (May 25, 1858 – December 31, 1915) was a Canadian 
professional baseball player from approximately 1875 to 1892. He began 
playing organized baseball in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and later played 
ten seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a left fielder, but 
also as a pitcher, for four major league clubs. While playing with the 
St. Louis Browns (later renamed the Cardinals) from 1884 to 1889, O'Neill 
helped the club compile a 516–247 record while also winning four pennants 
and the 1886 World Series. O'Neill won two American Association batting 
championships during those years and became the second person in major 
league history to hit for a triple crown, leading the league in 1887 with 
a .435 batting average, 14 home runs and 123 runs batted in (RBIs). He 
also rewrote the major league record book, establishing new records in 
at least eight categories, including the highest batting average (originally 
.492, adjusted to .435), on-base percentage (.490) and slugging percentage 
(.691), and the most hits (225), runs scored (167), doubles (52), extra 
base hits (84), and total bases (357) in a single season. His adjusted 
.435 batting average in 1887 remains the second highest in major league 
history. O'Neill has been dubbed "Canada's Babe Ruth"[1] and was posthumously 
inducted into both the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and the Ontario Sports 
Hall of Fame. Each year since 1984, the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame 
has presented the Tip O'Neill Award to the best Canadian baseball player. 
O'Neill was born in 1858 at Springfield, Ontario, Canada, a village in 
Southwestern Ontario that was later incorporated into the city of Malahide.[2] 
While O'Neill was a boy, his family moved approximately 30 miles northeast 
to Woodstock, Ontario, where his parents operated a hotel.[1] In 1875, 
O'Neill began playing organized baseball in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada,[3] 
and became known as "The Woodstock Wonder."[2] He also traveled with barnstorming 
teams.[1] In 1881, he reportedly played in Detroit,[3] and in 1882, he 
played for the New York Metropolitans in the League Alliance.[4] O'Neill 
made his major league debut on May 5, 1883, as a pitcher for New York Gothams 
(later renamed the Giants) of the National League. Shortly after his major 
league debut, The Sporting Life wrote: "O'Neill, the New York change pitcher, 
seems to have but one element of effectiveness in his delivery, viz.: fast 
and slow. This is a very weak reliance nowadays, as batsmen have only to 
note the speed of the ball and wait for a good one. O'Neill's delivery 
is wild and erratic -- hard work for the catcher and busy work for the 
field."[5] O'Neill appeared in 19 games as a starting pitcher for the Gothams 
and compiled a win–loss record of 5–12 and a 4.07 earned run average (ERA).[2] 
In 1884, O'Neill joined Charlie Comiskey's St. Louis Browns (later renamed 
the Cardinals) of the American Association. He was signed by Comiskey to 
replace pitcher Tony Mullane, who left the Browns after the 1883 season.[6] 
O'Neill compiled an 11–4 win-loss record with a 2.68 ERA and led the league 
with a .733 winning percentage as pitcher.[2] However, his arm reportedly 
"went back on him" during the 1884 season, requiring him to switch from 
pitching to playing in the outfield.[3] He ended up playing 64 games as 
an outfielder in 1884 and was exclusively an outfielder thereafter.[2] 
In 1885, O'Neill missed much of the season, suffering an injury on June 
10 and not returning to the lineup until September 3.[7] Despite the injury, 
O'Neill established himself as the Browns' best batter, hitting .350 in 
52 games,[2] nearly 80 points higher than any other player on the team.[8] 
The 1885 Browns won the American Association pennant with a 79-33 record 
and tied the Chicago White Stockings in the 1885 World Series.[8] O'Neill 
scored four runs but hit .208 in his first World Series.[2] O'Neill played 
his first full season as a position player in 1886 and became one of the 
most valuable players in baseball. He appeared in 138 games, all as an 
outfielder, and led the league with 107 runs batted in (RBIs). He was also 
among the league leaders with a .328 batting average (5th), .385 on-base 
percentage (5th), .440 slugging percentage (6th), 190 hits (2nd), 255 total 
bases (2nd), 45 extra base hits (5th), and a 4.9 Wins Above Replacement 
(WAR) rating (2nd among position players).[2] O'Neill's hitting helped 
lead the Browns to the American Association pennant with a 93-46 record.[9] 
The team also went on to defeat the Chicago White Stockings of the National 
League in the 1886 World Series. O'Neill hit .400 with a .500 on-base percentage, 
five runs scored, five RBIs, two home runs and two stolen bases in the 
World Series.[2] In 1887, O'Neill rewrote the major league batting record 
book in just 124 games. That year, he won the American Association triple 
crown with a .435 batting average, 14 home runs and 123 RBIs.[2] His batting 
average was originally recorded at .492, bases on balls having been counted 
as hits during that season. At the time of his death in 1915, his unadjusted 
.492 average was recorded as the highest in major league history.[6] Subsequently, 
batting averages for the 1887 season were adjusted by removing bases on 
balls from the calculations. Even after that adjustment, O'Neill's 1887 batting 
average of .435 was a major league record until 1894 when Hugh Duffy established 
the current major league record by hitting .440.[10] O'Neill's adjusted 
average for 1887 remains the second highest single season batting average 
in major league history.[11] O'Neill's batting performance in 1887 also 
established new single season, major league records in at least seven other 
categories, including the highest on-base percentage (.490),[12] slugging 
percentage (.691),[13] most hits (225),[14] runs scored (167),[15] doubles 
(52),[16] and extra base hits (84),[17] and total bases (357).[18] He also 
led all position players across Major League Baseball in 1887 with a 6.9 
WAR rating.[19] O'Neill's hitting in 1887 helped lead the Browns to their 
third consecutive American Association pennant with a 95-40 record.[20] 
The Browns lost the 1887 World Series to the Detroit Wolverines, as O'Neill 
hit .200 in 65 at bats against Detroit's pitching in the World Series.[2] 
In 1888, O'Neill won his second consecutive American Association batting 
title by hitting .335. He also ranked among the league leaders in multiple 
hitting categories for the third consecutive year with a .390 on-base percentage 
(2nd), .446 slugging percentage (3rd), 177 hits (1st), 236 total bases 
(3rd), 98 RBIs (4th), and 225 times on base (3rd).[1][2] With O'Neill again 
leading the club in hitting, the Browns won their fourth consecutive pennant 
in 1888 with a 92-43 record.[21] The Browns lost the 1888 World Series 
to the New York Giants, though O'Neill compiled a .349 on-base percentage 
with eight runs, 11 RBIs and two home runs in his final World Series.[2] 
O'Neill had his fifth consecutive strong season as a batter in 1889. He 
appeared in 134 games in the outfield and compiled a .335 batting average, 
the second highest in the American Association. He again ranked among the 
league leaders in multiple batting categories with a .419 on-base percentage 
(4th), .478 slugging percentage (4th), 179 hits (4th), 255 total bases 
(3rd), 33 doubles (4th), nine home runs (5th), 110 RBIs (3rd), and 50 extra 
base hits (3rd).[2] The Browns compiled a 90-45 record in 1889 but finished 
in second place, two games behind the Brooklyn Bridegrooms.[22] In O'Neill's 
first six seasons with the Browns from 1884 to 1889, he appeared in 656 games, 
scored 585 runs, compiled a WAR rating of 22.5, and hit .347 with a .407 
on-base percentage, .498 slugging percentage, 925 hits, and 538 RBIs.[2] 
During those six seasons, he was the Browns' dominant hitter and helped 
the club win four pennants and compile a record of 516 wins and 247 losses.[23] 
O'Neill followed Charlie Comiskey to the Players' League in 1890, appearing 
in 137 games as an outfielder for Comiskey's Chicago Pirates. He hit .302 
in the Players' League with a .377 on-base percentage. He led the league 
in games played and ranked second with 647 plate appearances and seventh 
with 174 hits and 244 times on base.[2] O'Neill followed Comiskey back 
to the Browns in 1891. He appeared in 127 games in the outfield and was 
among the league leaders with a .323 batting average (3rd), .404 on-base 
percentage (6th), .451 slugging percentage (8th), 166 hits (6th), 232 total 
bases (6th), 28 doubles (3rd), 10 home runs (4th), 95 RBIs (6th) and 42 
extra base hits (8th).[2] In 1892, Charlie Comiskey jumped to the Cincinnati 
Reds of the National League, and O'Neill again followed Comiskey. In nine 
of ten years of O'Neill's career, he played on teams managed by Comiskey.[24] 
O'Neill appeared in 109 games as an outfielder for the Reds in 1892. At 
the start of spring training, Ban Johnson, then the Cincinnati correspondent 
to The Sporting News, expressed hope that O'Neill would help the Reds to 
a pennant: "Tip O'Neill is big, hearty and strong, and gives promise of 
doing great things for the club in the near-approaching campaign for pennant 
honors."[25] However, his batting average in 1892 dropped 72 points from 
the prior season to .251, his lowest season since his rookie year as a 
pitcher in 1883.[2] O'Neill began the season slow, but in mid-May, Comiskey 
expressed confidence that O'Neill would "come back to his old form after 
a while."[26] The following month, the New York Sun reported that O'Neill 
was one of the most frequent recipients of Comiskey's mid-game "lecture, 
without any curtain."[27] By mid-July, The Sporting Life reported: "Tip 
O'Neill has lately been playing so poorly that the Cincinnati cranks have 
soured on him."[28] He appeared in his last major league game on August 
30, 1892, at age 34.[2] In December 1892, Comiskey told The Sporting News 
that O'Neill had left the club without permission and had not been heard 
from since. However, Comiskey added: "If he can play ball for me as well 
as he did at St. Louis I should like to have him. Last year Tip was in 
poor health, and that is the reason I assigned for his weak stick work."[29] 
Over 10 major league seasons, O'Neill appeared in 1,052 games (1,022 as 
an outfielder) and made 4,712 plate appearances and compiled a .326 batting 
average, .392 on-base percentage, and .458 slugging percentage. He totaled 
879 runs scored, 1,385 hits, 222 doubles, 92 triples, 52 home runs, 757 
RBIs, 161 stolen bases, 420 bases on balls, and 1,947 total bases.[2] O'Neill 
is one of only 15 players in baseball history to have won the Major League 
Baseball Triple Crown. Of the 14 triple crown winners who are eligible 
for the Baseball Hall of Fame (Miguel Cabrera is not yet eligible), O'Neill 
and Paul Hines are the only two who have not been inducted. At the end 
of the 2013 season, O'Neill's .326 career batting average was the 36th 
highest in major league history.[30] Of the 35 players with higher career 
batting averages than O'Neill, only five eligible players (Dave Orr [.342], 
Pete Browning [.341], Jake Stenzel [.337], Riggs Stephenson [.336] and 
Mike Donlin [.332])[31] have not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. Shortly after O'Neill retired from baseball, The Sporting Life reported 
in July 1893 that he was "making book" at Sheepshead Bay, a horse racing 
track in New York City.[32] He also worked as a "big league umpire" and 
as a scout for various baseball clubs, including the Chicago White Sox.[3][33] 
He moved to Montreal, Quebec where he lived with his brother and assisted 
in acquiring a minor league baseball club for the city.[1][6] On New Year's 
Eve 1915, O'Neill died suddenly at age 57 while riding on a streetcar in 
Montreal.[3] The cause of death was an "attack of heart disease."[33] He 
was buried at St. Mary Cemetery in Woodstock, Ontario.[2] In 1983, O'Neill 
was posthumously honoured as one of the first inductees of the Canadian 
Baseball Hall of Fame. The Canadian Hall each year presents the Tip O'Neill 
Award to "the player judged to have excelled in individual achievement 
and team contribution while adhering to baseball's highest ideals."[1] 
He has also been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.[34] A municipal 
baseball field in Woodstock, Ontario is named Tip O'Neill Field in his 
honour.[35] James "Tip" O'Neill was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall 
of Fame in 1997.[36] During the late 19th century and early 20th century, 
there were several other athletes who went by the name "Tip" O'Neill. In 
1898, O'Neill wrote to The Sporting Life to correct a report that he was 
managing a baseball team in Montgomery, Alabama. He noted: "It seems strange 
that every ball player whose name happens to be O'Neill should call himself 
Tip. One Tip died in London, Can., a few years ago, and when I would meet 
friends that I had not met for some time they would take me for a ghost. 
The Chicago "Record" last spring had me dying of consumption."[37] The 
confusion of "Tip" O'Neills continues as some sources erroneously state 
that O'Neill served as the president of the Western League, a minor league 
based in the Midwestern United States.[34] To the contrary, the individual 
who served as president of the Western League was Norris "Tip" O'Neill.[38] 
Years later, the future American politician and Speaker of the House, Thomas 
"Tip" O'Neill (1912–94), was given the nickname "Tip" as a boy, due to
