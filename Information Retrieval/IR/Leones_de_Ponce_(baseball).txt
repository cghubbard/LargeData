This article is about the Ponce baseball team. For the basketball team 
of the same name, see Ponce Lions (basketball). The Leones de Ponce (English: 
Lions) was a baseball team in the Puerto Rico Professional Baseball League. 
The organization is based in the municipality of Ponce, Puerto Rico. The 
team plays at the Francisco Montaner Stadium. Contrary to popular belief, 
the name Leones comes from their team owner being photographed with a whip 
as if taming lions.[6] At one time, the "legendary" team scored a continuous 
run of thirteen championships.[4] The team's owner is Héctor “Tito” Gracia, 
and former baseball player with the Leones himself.[4] The team's colors 
are red and white. As of 2009, the Leones won 11 LBPPR league championships, 
including four straight from 1942–1945, as follows: 1941/1942 · 1942/1943 
· 1943/1944 · 1944/1945 · 1946 /1947 · 1968/1969 · 1969/1970 · 1971/1972 
· 1981/1982 · 2003/2004 · 2008/2009 After the suspension of the 2007-2008 
season, the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico reestablished itself, 
while doing several changes to its format. The Leones chose Eduardo Pérez, 
son of Tony Pérez, to coach the team during the season.[5] The Leones were 
the first team to surpass twenty victories during the regular season, eventually 
concluding in the first place.[7] For his team’s performance, Eduardo Pérez 
won the award for "Manager of the Year",[8] while Jorge Padilla was selected 
the league's Most Valuable Player.[8] After concluding the first two stages 
of the playoffs undefeated, the Leones were joined by the Lobos de Arecibo 
in the final bracket. In the final series, the team won the first game, 
before losing the second in Arecibo.[9][10] The Leones then won three consecutive 
games, including the decisive contest before 15,000 fans in Ponce.[11][12] 
With this streak, the team finished with a 12-1 record in the final month 
of action, including the latter part of the regular season.[13] With this 
victory, Eduardo Pérez became the first son of a Major League Baseball 
Hall of Famer to win a championship in a professional baseball league.[14] 
After beginning the 2009-10 season with three consecutive losses, the Leones 
defeated the Criollos to win their first game.[15] On November 20, 2009, 
the Gigantes defeated the team, scoring 17 hits.[16] On November 25, 2009, 
the Indios defeated the Leones to win their fourth game of the season.[17] 
In their next game, the Leones defeated Carolina.[18] On November 28, 2009, 
the Leones defeated the Gigantes del Cibao in inter-league action.[19] 
On November 30, 2009, Ramón Martínez began practicing with the Leones, 
marking his return to the league since 2001-02.[20] In 1972, the Leones 
won their first Caribbean Series championship at Santo Domingo, gathering
