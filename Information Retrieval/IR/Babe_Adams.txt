Charles Benjamin "Babe" Adams (May 18, 1882 – July 27, 1968) was an American 
right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1906 to 1926 who 
spent nearly his entire career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Noted for his 
outstanding location control, his career average of 1.29 walks per 9 innings 
pitched was the second lowest of the 20th century; his 1920 mark of 1 walk 
per 14.6 innings was a modern record until 2005. He shares the Pirates' 
franchise record for career victories by a right-hander (194), and holds 
the team mark for career shutouts (47); from 1926 to 1962 he held the team 
record for career games pitched (481). Adams was born in Tipton, Indiana. 
As a child, he moved to Mount Moriah, Missouri, where baseball was popular. 
After he was discovered by a Missouri-based scout in 1904, he was signed 
to play minor league baseball with the Parsons Preachers of the Missouri 
Valley League in 1905.[1] He made his MLB debut on April 18, 1906 with 
the St. Louis Cardinals, taking the loss in a 4-inning start, but did not 
pitch again for them. In September 1907 his contract was sold to the Pirates. 
After going 12–3 with a 1.11 earned run average (ERA) in the 1909 regular 
season, his first full year, Adams became the star of the 1909 World Series 
after being named the surprise starter of Game 1 following a tip by National 
League president John Heydler that Adams' style was similar to that of 
an AL pitcher against whom the Detroit Tigers had had difficulty. He won 
three complete game victories – each of them a six-hitter. With a shutout 
in Game 7, Adams became the first rookie in World Series history to start 
and win Game 7, which has only been repeated once in baseball history by 
John Lackey in 2002. He was also the only member of that team who would 
be on the Pirates' World Series champions in 1925. He later won 20 games 
in both 1911 and 1913. An off year in 1916 that saw his ERA rise to 5.72 
got him farmed out to the Western Association, but late in 1918 he found 
his stride again and rejoined the Pirates, where he stayed until 1926. 
Adams was known as an excellent control pitcher. On July 17, 1914, he pitched 
an entire 21-inning game against the New York Giants without allowing a 
single walk, surrendering only 12 hits, but losing 3–1 on Larry Doyle's 
home run in the top of the 21st; it is the longest game without a walk 
in Major League history. Rube Marquard also went the distance for New York 
to gain the victory, allowing two walks. In 1920, Adams allowed only 18 
walks in 263 innings. In his career Adams won 194 games and lost 140. His 
ERA was 2.76. His last game was on August 11, 1926; he was released days 
later after joining a group of players who requested that former manager 
and team vice president Fred Clarke, who had been openly criticizing manager 
Bill McKechnie, not be permitted to sit on the bench. He would never play 
another major league game. Adams later managed in the minor leagues, farmed 
in Mount Moriah, Missouri, and worked as a reporter and foreign correspondent 
during World War II and the Korean War. Adams died of throat cancer in
