The Toronto Blue Jays are a professional baseball team based in Toronto, 
Ontario, and a member of Major League Baseball's (MLB) American League 
East Division. Since June 5, 1989, the Blue Jays have played in the Rogers 
Centre (called the "SkyDome" until February 2, 2005).[1] Before that, they 
played at Exhibition Stadium.[2] The name "Blue Jays" was chosen via a 
contest in 1976 from among more than 4,000 suggestions.[3] The Blue Jays 
made their MLB debut during the 1977 baseball season, as an expansion team.[3] 
They first made the playoffs in 1985, by capturing the American League 
East Division, but lost the American League Championship Series (ALCS) 
in seven games to the Kansas City Royals.[4] The team returned to the playoffs 
in 1989, where they lost to the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS in five games,[5] 
and again in 1991, where once more the Blue Jays were defeated in the ALCS 
in five games, this time by the Minnesota Twins.[6] In 1992, the Blue Jays 
became the first Canadian-based team to win the Commissioner's Trophy,[7] 
with a pair of six-game victories over Oakland in the ALCS and the Atlanta 
Braves in the World Series.[8] In 1993, they repeated their success, with 
another pair of six-game victories over the Chicago White Sox in the ALCS 
and the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series.[9] After 1993, the Blue 
Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs for 21 consecutive seasons, until 
clinching a playoff berth in 2015. Note: The statistics are current as 
of the end of the 2016 Major League Baseball season. The following table 
describes the Blue Jays' MLB winâ€“loss record by decade. These statistics
