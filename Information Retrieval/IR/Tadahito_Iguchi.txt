Tadahito Iguchi (井口 資仁, Iguchi Tadahito?, born December 4, 1974 in Nishitōkyō, 
Tokyo, Japan) is a Japanese second baseman currently playing for the Chiba 
Lotte Marines. As a member of the Chicago White Sox in 2005, he became 
the second Japanese-born player to win the World Series. Iguchi began playing 
in high school and after graduating in 1993, went to Aoyama Gakuin University 
where he distinguished himself by hitting the Tohto University Baseball 
League record of eight home runs in a season and winning the triple crown. 
He was a member of Japanese National Team in 1996 Summer Olympics that 
won the silver medal. He was the first pick in the 1996 draft by Fukuoka 
Daiei Hawks. In his debut year of 1997, he hit a grand slam in the first 
game of his professional career. He suffered a shoulder injury in the 2000 
season and had a surgery which ended his season. He recovered fully in 
2001 hitting 30 home runs and leading the league with a personal best 44 
stolen bases. In 2003, he hit over .300, had over 100 RBI and led the league 
in steals. He left Fukuoka Daiei after the 2004 season to play for the 
Chicago White Sox. During the 2005 MLB season, he had a .278 batting average 
with 15 home runs and 15 stolen bases. In the 2005 Divisional Series, he 
hit a go-ahead 3-run home run in Game 2 against the Boston Red Sox.[1] 
In 2006, Iguchi had two multi-homer games, both times hitting a grand slam 
(during the 20 May 2006 game involving a bench-clearing brawl) and another 
home run. On July 27, 2007, he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies 
for pitcher Michael Dubee. He was the first Asian-born player to join the 
Phillies.[2] On December 18, 2007, Iguchi signed a one-year deal with the 
San Diego Padres.[3] He was released on September 1, 2008.[4] On September 
5, 2008, the Phillies signed Iguchi, making it his second stint with the 
team.[5] Because he was acquired after September 1, he was ineligible for 
the team's postseason roster, so he was not with the team when they bested 
the Tampa Bay Rays in the World Series, although he received a World Series 
ring. On January 19, 2009, he returned to Japan to play for the Chiba Lotte 
Marines.[6][7] He is the only player to have ever been a member of two 
different World Series championship teams, the 2005 Chicago White Sox and 
2008 Philadelphia Phillies and two or more different Japan Series championship 
teams – including the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in 1999 and 2003 and the Chiba
