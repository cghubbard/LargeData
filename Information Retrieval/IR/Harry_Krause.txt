Harry William "Hal" Krause (July 12, 1888 – October 23, 1940) was a Major 
League Baseball player. He was a pitcher over parts of five seasons (1908–1912) 
with the Philadelphia Athletics and Cleveland Naps. He led the American 
League in earned run average in 1909 while playing for Philadelphia. For 
his career, he compiled a 36–26 record, with a 2.50 ERA and 298 strikeouts. 
Krause was born in San Francisco, California, and attended Saint Mary's 
College of California. He started his professional baseball career in 1907. 
In 1908, at the age of 19, Krause ventured east. He went 17–4 in the Tri-State 
League and joined the Athletics.[1] Krause made an immediate impact in 
the major leagues. He started out 1909 with a 10-game winning streak, which 
included six shutouts. He finished the season 18–8 with a league-leading 
1.39 ERA. It is the lowest ERA ever for an American League rookie.[2] Krause 
didn't pitch as often or as well in 1910 and 1911. He had arm trouble early 
in 1910 which forced him to miss some time, but pitched well enough in 
1911 that he was considered for use in the 1911 World Series, although 
he wasn't needed.[3] The 1912 Reach Guide credits him with helping carry 
the pitching burder for the 1911 team while stars Jack Coombs and Chief 
Bender were less effective than usual early in the season.[4] In 1912, 
he came down with a sore arm, pitched badly in six games, and then went 
to the minor league Toledo Mud Hens. He went 13–4 with Toledo.[1] The following 
season, he returned to the west coast and joined the Portland Beavers of 
the Pacific Coast League. In 1913 and 1914, Krause won a total of 39 games 
with ERAs below 2.30. He had an off year in 1915, however, and played in 
the Western League in 1916. He went back to the PCL in 1917 with the Oakland 
Oaks. Krause spent 12 years in Oakland. In his first season there, he set 
career-highs in wins and innings pitched in the long PCL season, going 
28–26 with a 2.35 ERA in 428.2 innings. He continued to pitch well for 
the Oaks over the next decade, becoming a fixture in the starting rotation 
and winning over 20 games two more times. In 1928, he joined the Mission 
Reds, where he finished his playing career.[1] Krause won a total of 249 
games in the PCL over 16 seasons.[2] He is also a member of the Pacific 
Coast League Hall of Fame. In October 1940, Krause was involved in a car 
accident.[5] He died eight days later. He was survived by his wife, Marie.[6]
