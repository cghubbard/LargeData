Robert Lewis Thomson (born August 16, 1963) is a Canadian bench coach for 
the New York Yankees. He previously served as bench coach during the 2008 
season, and third base coach from 2009 - 2014. He has also served as Major 
League Field Coordinator for the organization. Thomson was selected by 
the Detroit Tigers in the 32nd round of the 1985 draft from the University 
of Kansas. He played catcher and third base in the Tigers' minor league 
system until 1988, when he became a minor league coach for the team. In 
1990, Thomson joined the Yankees organization as a third base coach for 
the team's Class-A affiliate in Fort Lauderdale. He moved into the front 
office in 1998 as a Field Coordinator, and became Director of Player Development 
in 2000. Prior to the 2003 season, he was named Vice President of Minor 
League Development, and was named to the Major League coaching staff in 
November of the same year. On September 27, 2006, Thomson took over as 
first base coach in place of Tony Peña, who learned before the game that 
his father had died. He filled in at the position for four games, as Peña 
returned in time for the season finale on October 1. On April 4, 2008, 
Yankees manager Joe Girardi fell ill with a respiratory infection[1] and 
designated Thomson to manage that night's game against the Tampa Bay Rays.[2] 
It was Thomson's first major league game as a manager and he became the 
first Canadian to manage a Major League game since George Gibson for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates in 1934; the Yankees lost 13–4.[3][4]Thomson also managed 
the April 5 game due to Girardi's illness.[5] He served as the team's third 
base coach for six seasons. Prior to the 2015 season, he was named bench 
coach along with a series of coaching changes. During his time as third 
base coach, Thomson was regularly criticized for sending runners home who 
routinely were thrown out at home plate.[6] In 2014, the Yankees were tied 
with the Angels for the AL lead with 21 players thrown out at home.[7][8]
