The 7th Micronesian Games was held August 1â€“10 in Palau.[1] Initially, 
the 7th Games were to be hosted in Majuro, Marshall Islands;[2] however, 
in April 2008, the organisers announced that the Games could be "scaled 
down", with a number events cancelled due to a lack of facilities in Majuro.[3] 
In May 2008, the Marshall Islands announced that it was withdrawing from 
hosting the competition.[4] The hosting of the Games was subsequently awarded 
to Palau.,[5] which previously hosted the 1998 Games. The Games were officially 
opened by the President of the Republic of Palau, Johnson Toribiong. He 
participated at the first Micronesian Games 1969 in baseball, but for the 
Mariana Islands (now Northern Mariana Islands) team.[6] Before opening 
the Games, he also took part at this year's torch relay during the opening 
ceremony in the stadium. Torch lighter was wrestler Elgin Loren Elwais, 
who participated for Palau at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[7] Participants
