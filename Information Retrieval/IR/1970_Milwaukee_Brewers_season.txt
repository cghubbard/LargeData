The 1970 Milwaukee Brewers season was the second season for the franchise. 
The team finished fourth in the American League West with a record of 65 
wins and 97 losses, 33 games behind the Minnesota Twins. This was the team's 
inaugural season in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, after spending its first year 
of existence in Seattle, Washington. During the offseason, Dewey Soriano, 
president of the financially strapped Seattle Pilots, crossed paths with 
Bud Selig, a Milwaukee car dealer who had been working to bring baseball 
back to Milwaukee since the Braves (of which he'd been a minority owner) 
left for Atlanta after the 1965 season. They met in secret for over a month 
after the end of the season, and during Game 1 of the World Series, Soriano 
agreed to sell the Pilots to Selig for $10 million to $13 million (depending 
on the source). Selig would then move the team to Milwaukee and rename 
it the Brewers. However, the owners turned it down in the face of pressure 
from Washington's two senators, Warren Magnuson and Henry (Scoop) Jackson, 
as well as state attorney general Slade Gorton. MLB asked Soriano and chairman 
William Daley to find a local buyer. Local theater chain owner Fred Danz 
came forward in October 1969 with a $10 million deal, but it fizzled when 
the Bank of California called in a $4 million loan it had made to Soriano 
and Daley for startup costs. In January 1970, Westin Hotels owner Eddie 
Carlson put together a nonprofit group to buy the team. However, the owners 
rejected the idea almost out of hand since it would have devalued the other 
clubs' worth. A more traditional deal came one vote short of approval. 
After a winter and spring full of court action, the Pilots reported for 
spring training under new manager Dave Bristol unsure of where they would 
play. The owners had given tentative approval to the Milwaukee group, but 
the state of Washington got an injunction on March 17 to stop the deal. 
Soriano immediately filed for bankruptcy — a move intended to forestall 
any post-sale legal action. At the bankruptcy hearing a week later, general 
manager Marvin Milkes testified there was not enough money to pay the coaches, 
players and office staff. Had Milkes been more than 10 days late in paying 
the players, they would have all become free agents and left Seattle without 
a team for the 1970 season. With this in mind, Federal Bankruptcy Referee 
Sidney Volinn declared the Pilots bankrupt on March 31 — seven days before 
Opening Day — clearing the way for them to move to Milwaukee. The team's 
equipment had been sitting in Provo, Utah, with the drivers awaiting word 
on whether to drive toward Seattle or Milwaukee. Coincidentally, Milwaukee 
had gained its previous team under circumstances similar to some of those 
surrounding this move. The Braves had moved from Boston to Milwaukee only 
a few weeks before the 1953 season was to start. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
