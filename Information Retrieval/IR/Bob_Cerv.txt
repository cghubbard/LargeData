Robert Henry Cerv (born May 5, 1925) is a former American baseball player. 
Prior to his professional career, he was a collegiate baseball and basketball 
player at the University of Nebraska. He was born in Weston, Nebraska Cerv 
signed with the New York Yankees in 1950 and was a little-used reserve 
outfielder on the Yankee teams of the early 1950s. According to sportswriter 
Robert Creamer, interviewed for the Ken Burns film Baseball, one afternoon, 
Yankees manager Casey Stengel approached Cerv in the Yankees' dugout, sat 
down nearby, and commented "There's not many people that know this, but 
one of us has been traded to Kansas City." Following the 1956 season, Cerv 
was sold to the Kansas City Athletics, where he became a regular. His best 
season was 1958, when he hit .305, hit 38 homers, and had 104 RBIs, was 
elected to the American League All-Star team, beating out Ted Williams 
for the starting spot. He also finished 4th in the MVP voting that year. 
He did all of this while playing injured part of the season. Cerv also 
participated in the Home Run Derby, where he defeated Frank Robinson. He 
followed up in 1959 with 20 homers and 87 RBIs. Cerv still holds Kansas 
City's major league record for home runs with 38. In May 1960 Cerv was 
traded back to the Yankees for Andy Carey.[1] Following the 1960 season, 
he was drafted by the Los Angeles Angels in the expansion draft.[2] In 
May 1961 he was traded back to the Yankees,[3] where he was a substitute 
and pinch hitter. In June 1962 he was sold to the Houston Colt .45s,[4] 
who released him in August.[5] In his career Cerv had 105 home runs, including 
12 pinch hit homers. He also had a .276 batting average in his career with 
624 hits in 2261 at bats. Following Cerv's big league career, he coached 
college baseball at Southeast Missouri State College and John F. Kennedy 
College in Wahoo, Nebraska where he also coached the men's basketball team.
