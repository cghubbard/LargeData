Bowling refers to a series of sports or leisure activities in which a player 
rolls or throws a bowling ball towards a target. It is one of the major 
forms of throwing sports. In pin bowling variations, the target is usually 
to knock over pins at the end of a lane. When all the pins are knocked 
down on the first roll, this is a strike. In target variations, the aim 
is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible. The pin version 
of bowling is often played on a flat wooden or other synthetic surface 
(which can be oiled in different patterns for different techniques),[1] 
while in target bowling, the surface may be grass, gravel or a synthetic 
surface.[2] The most common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, nine-pin, 
candlepin, duckpin and five-pin bowling, while in target bowling, bowls, 
skittles, kegel, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque, and boules, both indoor 
and outdoor varieties are popular. Today the sport of bowling is played 
by 100 million people in more than 90 countries worldwide (including 70 
million in the United States),[3] and continues to grow through entertainment 
media such as video games for home consoles and handheld devices.[4] The 
earliest known forms of bowling date to ancient Egypt[5] and the ancient 
Roman empire. Remnants of balls used at the time were found among artifacts 
in ancient Egypt going back to 3200 BC [6] Balls were made using the husks 
of grains, covered in material such as leather, and bound with string. 
Other balls made of porcelain or even plastic have also been found, indicating 
that these were rolled along the ground rather than thrown due to their 
size and weight.[6] Some of these resemble the modern day jack used in 
target bowl games. Bowling games of different forms are also noted by Herodotus 
as an invention of the Lydians in Asia Minor.[7] About 2,000 years ago 
a similar game evolved between Roman legionaries entailing the tossing 
of stone objects as close as possible to other stone objects, which eventually 
evolved into Italian Bocce, or outdoor bowling.[8] About 400 AD bowling 
began in Germany as a religious ritual to cleanse oneself from sin by rolling 
a rock into a club (kegel) representing the heathen, causing bowlers to 
be called keglers.[9] In 1299 the oldest known bowling green for target 
style bowling to survive to modern times was built, Master's Close (now 
the Old Bowling Green of the Southampton Bowling Club) in Southampton, 
England; it is still in use.[10] In 1325 laws were passed in Berlin and 
Cologne limiting bets on lawn bowling to five shillings.[9] In 1366 the 
first official mention of bowling in England was made when King Edward 
III banned it as a distraction to archery practice.[11] In the 15th-17th 
centuries lawn bowling spread from Germany into Austria, Switzerland, and 
the Low Countries, with playing surfaces made of cinders or baked clay.[9] 
In 1455 lawn bowling lanes in London were first roofed-over, turning bowling 
into an all-weather game.[9] In Germany they were called kegelbahns, often 
attached to taverns and guest houses. In 1463 a public feast was held in 
Frankfurt, Germany, with a venison dinner followed by lawn bowling.[9] 
In 1511 English King Henry VIII (an avid bowler) banned bowling for the 
lower classes, imposing a levy for private lanes to limit them to the wealthy.[12] 
Another English law passed in 1541 (repealed in 1845) prohibited workers 
from bowling except on Christmas, and only in their master's home and in 
his presence. In 1530 he acquired Whitehall Palace in central London as 
his new residence, having it extensively rebuilt complete with outdoor 
bowling lanes, indoor tennis court, jousting tiltyard, and cockfighting 
pit. About 1520 Protestant Reformation founder Martin Luther set the number 
of pins (which varied from 3 to 17) at nine, and built a bowling lane next 
to his home for his children, sometimes rolling a ball himself.[9][13] 
On 19 July 1588 English Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Drake allegedly was playing 
bowls at Plymouth Hoe when the arrival of the Spanish Armada was announced, 
replying "We have time enough to finish the game and beat the Spaniards 
too."[14] In 1609 Dutch East India Company explorer Henry Hudson discovered 
Hudson Bay, bringing Dutch colonization to New Amsterdam (later New York); 
Hudson's men brought some form of lawn bowling with them.[9] In 1617 English 
King James I published Declaration of Sports, banning bowling on Sundays 
but permitting dancing and archery for those first attending an Anglican 
service, outraging Puritans; it was reissued in 1633 by his successor Charles 
I, then ordered publicly burned in 1643 by the Puritan Parliament. In 1670 
Dutchmen liked to bowl at the Old King’s Arms Tavern near modern-day 2nd 
and Broadway in New York City.[15] In 1733 Bowling Green in New York City 
was built on the site of a Dutch cattle market and parade ground, becoming 
the city's oldest public park to survive to modern times. In 1819 New York 
writer Washington Irving made the first mention of ninepin bowling in American 
literature in his story Rip Van Winkle. On 1 January 1840 Knickerbocker 
Alleys in New York City opened, becoming the first indoor bowling alley.[16] 
In 1841 the state of Connecticut banned nine-pin bowling to stop gambling, 
causing ten-pin bowling to be created to get around the law.[5] In 1846 
the oldest surviving bowling lanes in the United States were built as part 
of Roseland Cottage, the summer estate of Henry Chandler Bowen (1831-1896) 
in Woodstock, Connecticut. The lanes, now part of Historic New England's 
Roseland Cottage House Museum contain Gothic Revival architectural elements 
in keeping with the style of the entire estate.[17] In 1848 the Revolutions 
of 1848 resulted in accelerated German immigration to the U.S., reaching 
5 million by 1900, bringing their love of beer and bowling with them; by 
the late 19th century they made New York City a center of bowling. In 1848 
the Scottish Bowling Association for lawn bowling was founded in Scotland 
by 200 clubs; it was dissolved then refounded in 1892. In 1864 Glasgow 
cotton merchant William Wallace Mitchell (1803–84) published Manual of 
Bowls Playing, which became a standard reference for lawn bowling in Scotland.[18] 
In 1875 the National Bowling Association (NBA) was founded by 27 local 
clubs in New York City to standardize rules for ten-pin bowling, setting 
the ball size and the distance between the foul line and the pins, but 
failing to agree on other rules; it was superseded in 1895 by the American 
Bowling Congress.[19] In 1880 Justin White of Worcester, Massachusetts 
invented Candlepin Bowling. In the 1880s Brunswick Corporation (founded 
1845) of Chicago, Illinois, maker of billiard tables began making bowling 
balls, pins, and wooden lanes to sell to taverns installing bowling alleys; 
it left the bowling business in 2014. On 9 September 1895 the modern standardized 
rules for ten-pin bowling were established in New York City by the new 
American Bowling Congress (ABC) (later the United States Bowling Congress), 
who changed the scoring system from a maximum 200 points for 20 balls to 
a maximum 300 points for 10 balls, and set the maximum ball weight at 16 
lbs. and pin distance at 12 inches. The first ABC champion (1906-1921) 
was Jimmy Smith (1885-1948).[20] In 1927 Mrs. Floretta "Doty" McCutcheon 
(1888-1967) defeated Smith in an exhibition match, founding a school that 
taught 500,000 women how to bowl.[21][22][23] In 1993 women were allowed 
to join the ABC. In 2005 the ABC merged with the Women's International 
Bowling Congress (WIBC) et al. to become the United States Bowling Congress 
(USBC). The ABC initially used bowling bowls made of Lignum vitae hardwood 
from the Caribbean, which were eventually supplanted by the Ebonite rubber 
bowling ball (1905) and the Brunswick Mineralite rubber ball (1914). In 
1980 urethane bowling balls were introduced by Ebonite.[24] In the early 
1890s Duckpin bowling was invented in Boston, Massachusetts, spreading 
to Baltimore, Maryland about 1899. In 1903 the English Bowling Association 
was founded by cricketer W. G. Grace. On 1 January 2008 it merged with 
the English Women's Bowling Association to become Bowls England. In 1903 
D. Peifer of Chicago, Illinois invented a handicap method for bowling.[25] 
In 1905 Rubber Duckpin bowling was invented by Willam Wuerthele of Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, catching on in Quebec, Canada. Rules for target bowls evolved 
separately in each of the other countries that adopted the predominantly 
British game. In 1905 the International Bowling Board was formed;[26] its 
constitution adopted the laws of the Scottish Bowling Association, with 
variations allowed at the individual country level.[27] In September 1907 
the Victorian Ladies' Bowling Association was founded in Melbourne, Victoria, 
Australia, becoming the world's first women's lawn bowling association. 
In 1909 the first ten-pin bowling alley in Europe was installed in Sweden, 
but the game failed to catch on in the rest of Europe until after World 
War II. Meanwhile, ten-pin bowling caught on in Great Britain after hundreds 
of bowling lanes were installed on U.S. military bases during World War 
II.[9] In 1913 the monthly Bowlers Journal was founded in Chicago, Illinois, 
continuing to publish to the present day. In late 1916 the Women's International 
Bowling Congress (WIBC) (originally the Woman's National Bowling Association) 
was founded in Saint Louis, Missouri, merging with the United States Bowling 
Congress in 2005. In 1920-1933 Prohibition in the U.S. caused bowling alleys 
to disassociate from saloons, turning bowling into a family game and encouraging 
women bowlers.[23] On 2 October 1921 the annual Petersen Open Bowling Tournament 
(a.k.a. The Pete) was first held in Chicago, Ill., becoming bowling's richest 
tournament of the day. In 1998 it was taken over by AMF.[28] In 1926 the 
International Bowling Association (IBA) was formed by the U.S., Sweden, 
Germany, Netherlands, and Finland, holding four world championships by 
1936.[9] On 21 March 1934 the National Bowling Writers Association was 
founded in Peoria, Illinois by four bowling journalists; in 1953 it changed 
its name to the Bowling Writers Association of America.[29] On 20 August 
1939 the National Negro Bowling Association was founded in Detroit, Michigan, 
dropping Negro from the title in 1944 and opening membership to all races, 
reaching 30,000 members in 2007.[30] In 1947 the Australian Women's Bowling 
Council was founded, holding the first Australian women's national lawn 
bowling championship in Sydney in 1949, which was won by Mrs. R. Cranley 
of Queensland. On 18 April 1948 the Professional Women Bowling Writers 
(PWBW) was founded in Dallas, Texas, admitting men in 1975. On 1 January 
2007 it merged with the Bowling Writers Association of America.[31] About 
1950 the Golden Age of Ten-Pin Bowling began, in which professional bowlers 
made salaries rivaling those of baseball, football, and hockey players; 
it ended in the late 1979s. In 1950-1951 the ABC and WIBC opened membership 
to blacks.[30] In 1951 the first ABC Masters tournament was held, becoming 
one of the four majors in 2000. In 1952 the Fédération Internationale des 
Quilleurs (FIQ) was founded in Hamburg, Germany to coordinate international 
amateur competition in nine-pin and ten-pin bowling. In 1954 the first 
FIQ World Bowling Championships were held in Helsinki, Finland. In 1979 
the International Olympic Committee recognized it as the official world 
governing body for bowling. In 2014 it changed its name to World Bowling. 
In 1952 American Machine and Foundry (AMF) of Brooklyn, N.Y. began marketing 
automatic Pinsetter machines, eliminating the need for pinboys and causing 
bowling to rocket in popularity, making the 1950s the Decade of the Bowler. 
In 1954 Steve Nagy (1913-1966) became the first person to bowl a perfect 
300 game on TV on NBC-TV's "Championship Bowling".[32][33][34] The PBA 
later named its sportsmanship award after him. In 1958 the Professional 
Bowlers Association (PBA) was founded in Akron, Ohio by Don Carter, Dick 
Weber, Dick Hoover, Buzz Fazio, Carmen Salvino, Glenn Allison et al., reaching 
4,300 members in 14 countries worldwide. In 1975 Earl Anthony became the 
first PBA member with $100,000 yearly earnings, and the first to reach 
$1,000,000 total earnings in 1982. In 2000 it was purchased by former executives 
of Microsoft, who moved the PBA headquarters to Seattle, Washington. On 
28 November 1960 the first PBA Championship in Memphis, Tennessee was won 
by Don Carter. In 2002 it was renamed the PBA World Championship, awarding 
the Earl Anthony Trophy to the winner. In 1960 the Professional Women's 
Bowling Association (PWBA) was founded as the first professional women's 
bowling association; it went defunct in 2003. In 1960 the National Bowling 
League (NBL) was founded to compete with the PBA, signing name players 
including Billy Welu and Buzz Fazio, but failing to sign top star Don Carter, 
after which failure to get a TV contract caused it to fold after its first 
championship in 1962. In 1962 the PBA Tournament of Champions was founded, 
sponsored in 1965-1993 by Firestone Tire. In 1962 the American Wheelchair 
Bowling Association (AWBA) was founded in Louisville, Kentucky by Richard 
F. Carlson.[35] On 3–10 November 1963 the Fifth FIQ World Bowling Championships 
in Mexico City, Mexico were attended by 132 men and 45 women (first time) 
from 19 nations, and featured the debut of Team USA, which won seven of 
the eight gold medals.[36] On 25 November 1963 Sports Illustrated published 
the article A Guy Named Smith Is Striking It Rich, revealing that PBA stars 
made more money than other professional sports stars. "With more than $1 
million in prizes to shoot for, the nation's top professional bowlers are 
rolling in money."[37] Too bad, after the number of bowling alleys in the 
U.S. zoomed from 65,000 in 1957 to 160,000 in 1962, the U.S. bowling industry 
boom hit a brick wall in 1963, but this was compensated for by a new boom 
in Europe and Japan, making 10-pin bowling an international sport.[38] 
In 1964 "Mr. Bowling" Don Carter became the first athlete to sign a $1 
million endorsement contract, a multi-year deal with Ebonite International. 
In 1964 Marion Ladewig, 9-time winner of the Bowling Writers Association 
of America Female Bowler of the Year Award became the first Superior Performance 
inductee into the WIBC Hall of Fame. In 1965 the AMF Bowling World Cup 
was established by the FIQ. On 27 January 1967 the Japan Professional Bowling 
Association (JPBA) was founded in Tokyo, Japan. In 1971 the U.S. Open was 
founded by the PBA. In 1978 National Negro Bowling Association pioneer 
J. Elmer Reed (1903–83) became the first African-American to be inducted 
into the ABC Hall of Fame.[39] On 16 December 1979 Willie Willis won the 
Brunswick National Resident Pro Tournament in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
becoming the first African-American bowling champion in the PBA in a non-touring 
event. In 1980 he became the first African-American in the Firestone Tournament 
of Champions, placing 13th.[40] On 27 February 1982 Earl Anthony won the 
Toledo Trust PBA National Championship, becoming the first bowler to reach 
$1 million in career earnings. In 1982 the Young American Bowling Alliance 
was formed from a merger of the American Junior Bowling Congress, the Youth 
Bowling Association, and the collegiate divisions of the ABC and WIBC.[41] 
In 1982 the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, Australia added women's 
bowls to the events. On 22 November 1986 George Branham III (1962-) became 
the first African-American to win a PBA national touring event, the Brunswick 
Memorial World Open in Chicago, Illinois. On 18 September 1988 the 1988 
Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea featured ten-pin bowling as a demonstration 
sport. In the 1992-1993 season the ABC introduced resin bowling balls, 
causing perfect 300 scores to increase by 20%.[42] In 1995 the first Best 
Bowler ESPY Award was presented. In 1995 the National Bowling Stadium in 
Reno, Nevada opened, becoming known as the Taj Mahal of Tenpins. On 2 February 
1997 Jeremy Sonnenfeld (1975-) bowled the first officially sanctioned 900 
series of three straight perfect 300 games at Sun Valley Lanes in Lincoln, 
Nebraska, becoming known as "Mr. 900".[43] In 1998 the World Tenpin Masters 
10-pin bowling tournament was established. In 2000 the Weber Cup, named 
after Dick Weber was established as 10-pin bowling's equivalent to golf's 
Ryder Cup, with Team USA playing Team Europe in a 3-day match. On 31 March 
2004 Missy Bellinder (1981-) (later Parkin) became the first woman member 
of the PBA.[44] In 2004 the Brunswick Euro Challenge was founded for amateur 
and pro 10-pin bowling players from Europe, Asia, and the U.S.[45] On 24 
January 2010 Kelly Kulick (1977-) became the first female to win the PBA 
Tournament of Champions and the first female to win a PBA national tour 
event. In November 2012 after league bowling dropped from 80% to 20% of 
their business, AMF Bowling Centers of Richmond, Virginia filed for Chapter 
11 bankruptcy for the second time (first in 2001), merging in 2013 with 
upscale New York-based bowling center operator Bowlmor (which didn't support 
league bowling) in an attempt to turn league bowling around, growing from 
276 centers in 2013 to 315 in 2015. In 2013 the PBA League was founded, 
composed of permanent 5-person teams, with an annual draft.[46] Bowling 
games can be distinguished into two general classes: Five main variations 
are found in North America, varying especially in New England and parts 
of Canada: Another form of bowling is usually played outdoors on a lawn. 
At outdoor bowling, the players throw a ball, which is sometimes eccentrically 
weighted, in an attempt to put it closest to a designated point or slot 
in the bowling arena. Included in the outdoor category: Bowling is an anaerobic 
type of physical exercise, similar to walking with free weights. Bowling 
helps in burning calories and works muscle groups not usually exercised. 
The flexing and stretching in bowling works tendons, joints, ligaments, 
and muscles in the arms and promotes weight loss. While most sports are 
not suitable for elderly people, it is possible to practice bowling very 
well at advanced ages.[citation needed] Technological innovation has made 
bowling accessible to members of the disabled community. In 1948, bowling 
lanes were first built in the ground floor of the West Wing of the U.S. 
Presidential residence, the White House, as a birthday gift for then President 
Harry S. Truman, in the location of the 2010s White House Situation Room.[48] 
The lanes were moved to the Old Executive Office Building in 1955 to make 
way for a mimeograph room.[48] In 1969, friends of then U.S. President 
Richard M. Nixon, said to be an avid bowler, had a new one-lane alley built 
in an underground space below the building's North Portico.[48] Blackball, 
a 2003 comedy film about a young bowls player, based upon Griff Sanders.[49] 
Bowling is the main theme in the JDrama The Golden Bowl.[50] On 28 January 
1950 the painting Bowling Strike by George Hughes (1907-1989)[51] appeared 
on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post.[52] In 1982 American expressionist 
painter LeRoy Neiman produced a famous painting of PBA star Earl Anthony's
