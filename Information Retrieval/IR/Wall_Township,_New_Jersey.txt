Wall Township is a township in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's population was 26,164,[9][10][11] 
reflecting an increase of 903 (+3.6%) from the 25,261 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 5,017 (+24.8%) from the 20,244 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[20] Wall Township was formally incorporated as a township 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 7, 1851. Over the years, 
portions of the township have been taken to form North Spring Lake (May 
1884), Ocean Beach (March 9, 1885, now Belmar), Manasquan (December 30, 
1887), Spring Lake (March 14, 1892), Sea Girt (March 29, 1917), Brielle 
(April 10, 1919), South Belmar (March 12, 1924, now Lake Como) and Spring 
Lake Heights (March 19, 1927).[21][22] Wall Township was named for General 
Garret D. Wall (1783-1850), a lawyer who commanded a Trenton volunteer 
company during the War of 1812 and was stationed at Sandy Hook. Wall served 
five years as clerk of the New Jersey Supreme Court and as quartermaster 
general of the state for more than 20 years before being chosen to represent 
the state in the United States Senate from 1835 to 1841.[23][24][25] The 
Greenville Cemetery was established in 1734, when a casualty of the French 
and Indian War was buried there. The original structure of the Glendola 
Protestant Bible Church was built in 1776; The congregation dedicated a 
new church in 1964. Allaire Village dates back to 1822, when James P. Allaire 
purchased what became known as the Howell Works in Wall, and though it 
was the largest producing bog iron manufacturing site in New Jersey by 
1836, the ironworks were shut down in 1846. The village and surrounding 
acres were later preserved and gifted to the State of New Jersey to form 
Allaire State Park as a memorial to Hearst editor Arthur Brisbane, the 
last private owner of the site, who purchased the land in 1907 and built 
a palatial residence on that property that would later serve as the Arthur 
Brisbane Child Treatment Center. The Brisbane family donated the property 
to the State of New Jersey to establish Allaire State Park and the Historic 
Village at Allaire. Allaire Village Inc., a non-profit organization, is 
licensed by the State of New Jersey to operate the site now known as "The 
Historic Village at Allaire." The Allgor-Barkalow Homestead at 1701 New 
Bedford Road was constructed in 1840, although some accounts indicate construction 
of part of the building began in the 18th century. The building now houses 
the museum of the Old Wall Historical Society. The Blansingburg schoolhouse 
at Sea Girt Avenue opened in 1855; The building was relocated in 1999 to 
the Allgor-Barkalow Homestead Museum property for refurbishing.[26] Wall 
Township was formed in 1851, from portions of Howell Township.[21] The 
newly formed Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, with its home 
office in England, purchases a 93-acre (380,000 m2) farm around 1900 that 
became the site of the company's receiver equipment for commercial transatlantic 
radio operation. The Marconi signal site was abandoned in 1924, but it 
was later occupied by the Ku Klux Klan until they were ejected in March 
1928. The United States Army purchased the Marconi site in November 1941 
and named it Camp Evans.[27][28] The Allenwood Hospital, located at Squankum 
and Allenwood Roads, opened in January 1921 as a sanatorium for tuberculosis 
patients. In 1957, a 16-room building is dedicated to Geraldine L. Thompson, 
who served as president of the hospital's board of managers. In the 1960s, 
the facility becomes an annex to the John L. Montgomery Medical Home in 
Freehold Township, a county-run nursing home, and was renamed the Geraldine 
L. Thompson Care Center.[29] In 1940, Edward I. Brown used an old World 
War I tank converted into a bulldozer to clear land for an airport that 
he turned into what is now Monmouth Executive Airport after completing 
his service in the United States Navy as a pilot during World War II; The 
airport was sold by the Brown family in 2007 to a private equity firm, 
despite lengthy attempts by Monmouth county to acquire the facility.[30] 
The Roadside Diner, formerly the Circle Diner and Rusty's, was delivered 
to its Route 34 site by the Silk City Diner Co. in the 1940s. The diner 
was used for filming of a scene for the 1983 movie Baby It's You and appears 
on the cover of the 1994 Bon Jovi album Cross Road: 14 Classic Grooves, 
as well as having been featured in the 2008 music video for "Girls in Their 
Summer Clothes" by Bruce Springsteen.[31][32] Wall High School opened in 
September 1959, while Wall Intermediate School opened in 1967.[citation 
needed] Interstate 195 was extended into Wall Township in 1981, giving 
direct high-speed access to Trenton.[citation needed] A suit filed by the 
American Civil Liberties Union in December 1999 against the township over 
a holiday display that included a nativity scene and a Hannukah menorah, 
contending that the religious symbols violate the constitutional separation 
of church and state was dismissed by a judge who ruled that the organization 
had filed its suit too close to the start of the holiday season.[33] The 
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling in 
April 2001 vacating the decision of the district court in the case that 
the township's holiday display as modified in 2000 to include other seasonal 
decorations did not violate the Establishment Clause or the New Jersey 
Constitution and ruling that the ACLU lacked standing to file the case.[34] 
Even though many of the surrounding towns sprung out of Wall Township, 
the only ZIP code that exclusively serves areas of Wall is Allenwood, but 
even it relies solely on a Post-office box system for regular mail services.[35] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total 
area of 31.737 square miles (82.198 km2), including 30.673 square miles 
(79.443 km2) of land and 1.064 square miles (2.755 km2) of water (3.35%).[1][2]

which is the oldest form of government in New Jersey, having been first 
established in 1798, and enhanced by the Township Act of 1989. The five-member 
Township Committee is elected directly by the voters at-large in partisan 
elections to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with 
either one or two seats coming up for election each year as part of the 
November general election in a three-year cycle.[7][55] Each year, at the 
annual reorganization meeting, the Township Committee selects one of its 
members to preside as mayor for the year, and another to serve as deputy 
mayor. It is the only form of government in which the mayor is not elected 
directly by the voters of the municipality. Wall is one of 11 Monmouth 
County municipalities that use the Township form of government.[7][56]

Dominick DiRocco was appointed later that month to fill the vacant seat 
expiring in December 2016 and won election to serve the balance of the 
term of office.[63] Wall Township is served by three fire districts and 
three first aid squads.[64] Wall Fire Company # 1, the first volunteer 
fire company to serve the township, was created in December 1909. Today 
the company remains all volunteer and serves the residents of the West 
Belmar section of town, also known as Wall Fire District # 1.[65] Glendola 
Fire Company was formed, also known as Wall Fire District #2, in May 1931. 
Wall First Aid was formed in September 1939 and is known as Wall Township 
First Aid & Rescue Squad. South Wall Fire-Rescue, the township's third 
fire district, was established in 1946. It responds to calls for service 
in the south end of town. Wall Community First Aid Squad 52-22 was established 
on November 15, 1960.[66] Wall Township also has a paid EMS squad (52-23)
