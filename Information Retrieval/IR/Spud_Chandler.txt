Spurgeon Ferdinand "Spud" Chandler (September 12, 1907 – January 9, 1990) 
was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League 
Baseball as a right-handed starting pitcher and played his entire career 
for the New York Yankees from 1937 through 1947. He was named the American 
League's Most Valuable Player in 1943 after anchoring the team's pitching 
staff with 20 wins and only 4 losses as New York won its third consecutive 
pennant; his 1.64 earned run average in that season was the lowest by any 
major league pitcher between 1920 and 1967, and remains a Yankees team 
record. In eleven seasons, he never suffered a losing record; with a total 
of 109 wins and 43 losses, his career winning percentage of .717 is the 
highest of any pitcher with at least 100 victories since 1876. Chandler 
was born in Commerce, Georgia to Leonard Ferdinand Chandler (1871–1942) 
and Olivia Catherine Hix (1872–1957),[1] and attended the University of 
Georgia. He played football as a halfback, throwing a touchdown pass to 
help defeat Yale in a 1929 game dedicating a new stadium. He also pitched 
for the baseball team and competed on the track team. He was a brother 
of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity and graduated with a degree in agriculture. 
He spent five seasons in the Yankees organization after signing with the 
team, his favorite since boyhood. Chandler finally made his major league 
debut at age 29 on May 6, 1937, and went 7-4 that season with a 2.84 ERA 
and six complete games (including two shutouts). The following year he 
was 14-5, and in 1939 he was 3-0 in 11 relief appearances. Although the 
Yankees won the World Series in each of those years, Chandler did not appear 
in the postseason. Bothered by injuries during his early career, after 
records of 8-7 and 10-4 in 1940 and 1941 he improved further to 16-5 in 
1942, finishing third in the AL with a 2.38 ERA and earning his first of 
four All-Star selections. He was the All-Star Game's winning pitcher in 
1942. Chandler had one start in the World Series each year, but lost both 
times, as the Yankees won in 1941 and lost in 1942. His greatest year came 
in 1943. In addition to his outstanding ERA, he led the league with 20 
wins in 30 starts, as well as 20 complete games and five shutouts. In 253 
innings pitched, he gave up 46 earned runs, allowing only five home runs. 
Chandler's 134 strikeouts were third in the league, and equalled his combined 
total of the previous two seasons. He made the AL All-Star team for the 
second time. Chandler finally had a successful World Series, pitching two 
complete game victories, including a shutout in the final Game 5, as the 
Yankees defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. Winning the MVP award, he beat 
out Luke Appling of the Chicago White Sox. Chandler remains the only Yankee 
pitcher to win the Most Valuable Player award. After one start in 1944, 
he entered World War II military service with the Army for nearly all of 
the next two seasons. He returned in 1946 with another All-Star season, 
going 20-8 with a 2.10 ERA (2nd in the league to Hal Newhouser) and a career-high 
138 strikeouts. That year he also had 20 complete games for the second 
time in his career. He earned his last All-Star selection in 1947, but 
finished the year with only a 9–5 record as injuries ended his career at 
age 40. He pitched for the last time in the historic 1947 World Series 
against the Brooklyn Dodgers, pitching two relief innings in a Game 3 loss. 
In four World Series, he had a 2–2 record with a 1.62 ERA, 16 strikeouts, 
and 1 shutout. Over his career Chandler was 109-43 in 211 games (109 complete, 
26 shutouts), with a 2.84 ERA. He had 614 career strikeouts and gave up 
64 home runs and 1327 hits. As a hitter, he had a batting average of .201, 
with a .234 on-base percentage; he had 110 hits in 548 at bats in his career, 
and on July 26, 1940 had two home runs including a grand slam. He later 
managed in the minor leagues, became pitching coach with the Kansas City 
Athletics in 1957–58, and scouted for several teams before retiring in 
1984. He was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1969 and 
into the Franklin County Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. Chandler died at 
age 82 in South Pasadena, Florida. He was married and had two sons. Chandler
