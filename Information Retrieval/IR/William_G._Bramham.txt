William Gibbons Bramham (July 13, 1874 – July 8, 1947) was a baseball executive, 
lawyer and politician, whose most significant role was as president of 
the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues from 1933 through 
1946. Bramham was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Centennial 
Commission in 1937.[1] Judge Bramham carried his judicial title during 
four different decades in baseball despite never having sat upon a bench. 
His law school classmates bestowed it to honor his dignified manner, a 
demeanor that had undoubtedly served him well in baseball circles. In between, 
Bramham was a member of the Republican Party, serving as a delegate to 
the Republican National Convention from North Carolina in 1924, 1928, and 
1932, and assuming the position of Republican State Chair in 1925.[2][3] 
Born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, Bramham was the second of six siblings 
born to James Goss Bramham and Rosa Mason Cooke.[1] Bramham graduated from 
University of North Carolina and was admitted as a lawyer in Durham, North 
Carolina before showing his interest in baseball, as he helped stabilize 
the ballgame in the state in 1902 and was largely responsible for the creation 
of the Durham Tobacconists club, precursor to the legendary Durham Bulls.[4] 
After that, Bramham presided over the North Carolina State League from 
1916 to 1917; the Piedmont League, from its inception in 1920 until 1932; 
the South Atlantic League from 1924 through 1930; the Virginia League from 
1925 to 1928, and the Eastern Carolina League in 1928 and 1929.[5] During 
this time, Bramham accumulated enough experience as organizer and was well-versed 
in factors caused by the Great Depression, which led him to create stability 
in the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, now known 
as Minor League Baseball, the governing body for all professional baseball 
teams in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean that are affiliated 
with Major League Baseball through their farm systems.[6] After the historical 
Wall Street Crash of 1929, only 25 minor league circuits were able to finish 
the regular season that year. That number dwindled to 21 in 1930 and 16 
in 1932. From there, the administrative duties were put in the hands of 
an executive committee for a period of one year, with orders to survey 
conditions and report back with recommendations and specific requests for 
changes.[7] At the Winter Meetings of 1932, Bramham was appointed as the 
third president of the NAPBL. Bramham treated it as a great opportunity, 
instead of a misfortune, and provided the strong leadership that the baseball 
industry needed to survive and eventually prosper in the 1930s, despite 
the turbulent financial times.[7] The NAPBL office had been in Auburn, 
New York, since the organization was founded in 1901, but Bramham moved 
them to Durham, North Carolina, where he had a thriving law practice and 
was active in statewide Republican politics. Only five leagues committed 
to operate in 1933, but 14 actually opened and finished the season.[7] 
As a result, Bramham soon found out that he had a full-time job and gave 
up his law business to devote all his energy to the organization during 
14 years. That started an upward trend for the NAPBL guided by Bramham, 
which reached a peak of 43 leagues just prior to the start of World War 
II, as he inherited 14 leagues and 102 clubs, but turned over 52 leagues 
and 388 clubs to his successor George Trautman in 1947.[6][7] One of the 
most significant reforms instituted by Bramham during these years was designed 
to eliminate the so-called "shoestring operators", who often did not have 
the financial support to survive a full season. Bramham insisted that new 
owners show moral integrity and back up their operations with guaranty 
deposits, and he rigidly held all NAPBL clubs to this standard. This led 
to improved stability and sounder policies, making it easier to bring in 
new investors.[7] Bramham also was a strong backer of his umpires, protecting 
them from physical and verbal attacks from both uniformed and non-uniformed 
personnel. Among other of his ideas, he implemented by the mid-1930s a 
school of instruction for club business managers, and displays of promotional 
ideas at the Winter Meetings.[7] After that Bramham faced an even bigger 
hurdle, as was the start of World War II conflict. This not only drained 
the game of achievements, as ballplayers marched off to serve their country, 
but also created severe restrictions on the game through gas rationing 
and electrical power, travel cutbacks and the elimination of night games 
in coastal areas on both sides of the country.[6][7] Despite the war threat, 
41 NAPBL circuits operated in 1941, but many of them soon suspended operations. 
The number was down to 31 in 1942 and fall to just nine in 1943. But Bramham 
had one more major battle to fight during his term of office. Late in 1943, 
when he opted to run for reelection, there were rumors of a possible floor 
fight at the Winter Meetings. It would hinge on the issue of the existing 
NAPBL treasury upwards of $250,000. Some leagues, with operations suspended, 
wanted to divide up the money and liquidate the fund. The key issue was 
whether or not the suspended leagues or only those still active had the 
right to vote. Bramham prevailed, keeping the treasury intact for post-war 
operations, and was elected to a new five-year term as president. But time 
and responsibilities decreased his health, and was forced to announce his 
retirement on the eve of the 1946 Winter Meetings. Bramham was retained 
as a consultant to the new president Trautman, but he died a few months 
later.[7] Judge Bramham died in Durham, North Carolina in 1947, just five 
days before his 73rd birthday. He was survived by his wife Ninnon Marie 
(née Umstead) Bramham (1878–1964) and his son Winfrey Peyton Bramham (1899–1966).[8]
