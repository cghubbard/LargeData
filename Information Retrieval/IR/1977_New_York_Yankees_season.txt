WPIX The 1977 New York Yankees season was the 75th season for the Yankees 
in New York and the 77th season overall for the franchise. It culminated 
in the 21st World Series championship in franchise history, and its first 
under the ownership of George Steinbrenner. The season was brought to life 
years later in the book, turned drama-documentary, The Bronx is Burning. 
The Yankees signed Reggie Jackson to a five-year contract, totaling US$2.96 
million, on November 29, 1976. Upon arriving in New York, Jackson asked 
for uniform number 9, which he had worn in Oakland and Baltimore. However, 
that number was being worn by third baseman Graig Nettles. So, noting that 
then-all-time home run leader Hank Aaron had just retired, Jackson asked 
for and received number 44, Aaron's number. The team finished in first 
place in the American League East with a record of 100-62, finishing 2Â½ 
games ahead of the Baltimore Orioles to win their second AL East title. 
In the ALCS, they beat the Kansas City Royals in 5 games. In the World 
Series, they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 6 games. New York was 
managed by Billy Martin. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. [1] [2]

Yankees also hosted the All-Star Game, held on July 19. Four Yankees were 
in the game: Willie Randolph and Reggie Jackson were in the starting lineup 
at second base and outfield, while pitcher Sparky Lyle and third baseman 
Graig Nettles were part of the roster as reserves. The National League 
defeated the American League 7-5. Infielders Other batters Coaches Jackson's 
first season with the Yankees, 1977, was a difficult one. Although team 
owner George Steinbrenner and several players, most notably catcher and 
team captain Thurman Munson and outfielder Lou Piniella, were excited about 
his arrival, Martin was not. Martin had managed the Tigers in 1972 when 
Jackson's A's beat them in the playoffs. Jackson was once quoted as saying 
of Martin, "I hate him, but if I played for him, I'd probably love him." 
The relationship between Jackson and his new teammates was strained due 
to an interview with SPORT magazine writer Robert Ward. During spring training 
at the Yankees' camp in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Jackson and Ward were 
having drinks at a nearby bar. Jackson's version of the story is that he 
noted that the Yankees had won the pennant the year before, but lost the 
World Series to the Reds, and suggested that they needed one thing more 
to win it all, and pointed out the various ingredients in his drink. Ward 
suggested that Jackson might be "the straw that stirs the drink." But when 
the story appeared in the May 1977 issue of SPORT, Ward quoted Jackson 
as saying, "This team, it all flows from me. I'm the straw that stirs the 
drink. Maybe I should say me and Munson, but he can only stir it bad." 
Billy Martin feuded publicly with both Yankee owner George Steinbrenner 
and star outfielder Reggie Jackson. In one especially infamous incident, 
on June 18, 1977, in the middle game of what would prove to be a three-game 
series sweep by the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Martin pulled Jackson 
off the field in mid-inning for failing to hustle on a ball hit to the 
outfield. The extremely angry and highly animated Martin had to be restrained 
by his coaches from getting into a fight with Jackson in the dugout during 
the nationally-televised Saturday afternoon game. Jonathan Mahler wrote 
a bestselling book entitled Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning 
about the turmoil in New York City in 1977, including the Son of Sam, the 
blackout, and how Yankees season rallied the people of New York. The book 
was adapted for an ESPN miniseries, The Bronx Is Burning Note: Pos = Position;
