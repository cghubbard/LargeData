Gregory Eugene Gross (born August 1, 1952), is a former professional baseball 
player who played in the Major Leagues from 1973–1989, playing for the 
Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, and Philadelphia Phillies. He was formerly 
the hitting coach of the Philadelphia Phillies, being dismissed on October 
3, 2012. He is now a coach for the Reno Aces, the Class AAA affiliate of 
the Arizona Diamondbacks. Gross was best known for his clutch pinch-hits 
as a Phillie, and holds the Phillies career record in pinch hits with 117.[1] 
He also ranks fifth on Major League Baseball's all-time list in career 
pinch hits with 143.[2] Born in York, Pennsylvania, Gross graduated from 
Red Land High School in Lewisberry.[3] On June 4, 1970, Gross was selected 
by the Houston Astros in the fourth round of the free agent draft.[4] He 
led the league in hits in 1970 while playing for Covington in the Appalachian 
League, batting .351. He also tied for the league lead in double plays 
by outfielders. In 1971, Gross was promoted to the Columbus Astros of the 
Southern League, where he played outfield and first base. In 1972, Gross 
played most of the season at Columbus, and was promoted later on in the 
season to the Oklahoma City 89ers, which was the Astros' AAA farm club. 
In 1973, Gross started the season with the Denver Bears, which by that 
point had become the Astros' new AAA farm club. The Astros decided to call 
up Gross to the major leagues late in 1973. On September 5, 1973, Gross 
made his major league debut with the Astros, going 0-for-1 as a pinch hitter 
in a 9-3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Gross finished the season going 9-for-39 
for a .231 average. In 1974, Gross became the Astros' starting right fielder 
and leadoff hitter, playing in 156 games and batting .314. Gross was named 
the Sporting News' National League Rookie Player of the Year and finished 
second in the voting for National League Rookie of the Year.[5] Gross also 
finished the season with a .393 on-base percentage, giving him one of the 
highest on-base percentages of any rookie since 1970. In 1974, Gross also 
set a major league record for most times caught stealing in a rookie season 
with 20. In 1975 and 1976, Gross continued to be a starting outfielder 
for the Astros, hitting .294 and .286, respectively. On December 8, 1976, 
the Astros traded Gross to the Chicago Cubs for Julio González.[4] In 1977, 
Gross hit his first major-league home run, connecting a total of five times 
while hitting .322 in 115 games. After a busy 1978 season, Gross was traded 
by the Cubs on February 23, 1979 to the Philadelphia Phillies with Manny 
Trillo and Dave Rader for Jerry Martin, Barry Foote, Ted Sizemore, Derek 
Botelho and Henry Mack. Gross established himself as a key platoon outfielder 
and first baseman for the Phillies, getting to play in the 1980 League 
Championship Series (he went 3-for-4—all pinch hits—with 1 RBI in 4 games), 
the 1980 World Series (he went 0-for-2 in 4 games), the 1983 League Championship 
Series (he went 0-for-5 in 4 games with a run scored), and in the 1983 
World Series (he went 0-for-6 in 2 games). And, Gross was an invaluable 
pinch hitter as well. In 1982, he led the league in pinch hits with 19. 
Gross has said he had hoped to be a full-time player for the Phillies in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s, but the Phillies just had too many other 
talented outfielders, namely Bake McBride, Greg Luzinski, Garry Maddox, 
and Lonnie Smith. "I...didn't figure I should be playing part-time at that 
point in my career," Gross told the San Diego Union-Tribune in an article 
that appeared on March 18, 1991. "But they had those three guys and I knew 
they should be playing ahead of me. Plus, they were winning and that changes 
your thinking a lot. Before, I was playing on second-division teams and 
we were out of it pretty early. But when you get your first taste of winning, 
when you're in the playoffs and the World Series, you want more of it." 
In addition, Gross acknowledged in an interview in 2007 the difficulty 
of being a starting player when he was neither fast nor a power hitter. 
"The cycle that baseball was in back then, with the AstroTurf and everything, 
centered on the stolen base or the home run, and I did neither of those," 
Gross told The Patriot-News of Harrisburg in an article that was published 
on April 8, 2007. "It was just a matter of survival. You made the best 
out of it. The big break for me was when I got onto a real good club." 
Gross remained with the Phillies through the 1988 season, in which he hit 
just .203 in 133 at-bats but posted the unusual statistic of striking out 
just 3 times during the entire season. In fact, in Gross' entire career 
of 3,745 at-bats, Gross struck out just 250 times. On April 5, 1989, Gross 
rejoined the Houston Astros as a free agent, hitting .200 for the season 
largely in a pinch-hitting role.[4] Despite his historic success as a prolific 
pinch-hitter, Gross struggled as a pinch-hitter with the Astros in 1989, 
hitting just .184 (7-for-38). In October 1989, as part of a rebuilding 
movement, the Astros told Gross and many other veterans—including Bob Forsch, 
Rick Rhoden, Dan Schatzeder, Terry Puhl and Harry Spilman—that they would 
not negotiate new contracts with them before the free agent filing period, 
which was to begin after the 1989 World Series, if at all. On November 
2, 1989, Gross filed for free agency. Gross had hoped to be invited to 
a major-league club for a tryout in 1990. After a lockout by the owners 
in early 1990, Gross never received a single tryout, and he wound up sitting 
out the 1990 season. Gross again tried to extend his baseball career. On 
February 7, 1991, the San Diego Padres announced that they had invited 
Gross to spring training. Gross came to spring training at the recommendation 
of his old teammate and then-Phillies coach Larry Bowa, who had asked then-Padres 
manager Greg Riddoch to invite Gross to camp. "I love this game so much," 
Gross told the Los Angeles Times in an article that appeared on February 
28, 1991. "I can't leave it alone. It's not the money. It's not the attention. 
It's just being around this game. And I'm not going to cheat myself from 
playing as long as someone will let me." On March 30, 1991, the Los Angeles 
Times reported that Gross had made the Padres as a pinch-hitter. However, 
on April 5, 1991, the Padres cut Gross, choosing instead to sign Mike Aldrete 
to its final roster spot. The move ended Gross' major-league career. Several 
weeks later, there was reported interest in Gross by the Boston Red Sox, 
according to a May 14, 1991 article in the Boston Globe, but nothing ever 
materialized. "I've enjoyed my career, I really have," Gross told the San 
Diego Union-Tribune in March 1991. "There've been frustrations, sure, but 
the good times and being at this level of the game outweigh any of the 
negatives. I wanted to play every day, sure, but it didn't work out for 
me. But I found that niche and it worked out. Probably, if I'd been an 
everyday player, I wouldn't have lasted this long. I'd rather have the 
longevity." Both in 1986 and in 1989, Gross was called to the pitcher's 
mound during blowouts. On June 8, 1986, Gross pitched the final two-thirds 
of the eighth inning in a 12-0 Phillies loss to the Montreal Expos. Gross 
gave up a double to Andrés Galarraga, and then struck out Casey Candaele 
and Herm Winningham to end the rout.[6] And on May 21, 1989, Gross took 
the mound in the ninth inning of what wound up being a 17-5 loss by the 
Astros to the Pittsburgh Pirates. In that game, Gross had relieved shortstop 
Craig Reynolds, who had pitched the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, 
Gross gave up three hits and two earned runs. However, he also struck out 
José Lind swinging.[7] "The worst part is how close you are to the batter 
after you throw the ball," Gross told the Sporting News in its June 5, 
1989 issue. "I throw batting practice, but you've got the screen. I was 
looking for a way to sneak the screen out there." After his baseball career 
ended, Gross worked as a color commentator for several games for SportsChannel 
Philadelphia in 1991. He dabbled in real estate and coached at Malvern 
Prep High School.[8] He returned to professional baseball on February 6, 
1995, when the Colorado Rockies announced that Gross would make his debut 
as a professional coach with the Rockies' AA New Haven Ravens minor-league 
affiliate in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1995, Gross worked as a first-base 
coach for the Ravens, and then stayed with the club for the 1996 season 
as well. On October 24, 1996, the Rockies promoted Gross to become the 
Rockies' roving minor-league hitting instructor. He served in that capacity 
in 1997 through 2000. Gross quit the Rockies at the end of the 2000 season 
to become a bench coach for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2001. In 2002, 
Gross became the Phillies' hitting instructor. He remained the Phillies' 
hitting instructor through 2004.[9] On January 3, 2005, Gross became the 
hitting instructor for the Phillies' Class-A Batavia Muckdogs minor league 
team.[10] On December 22, 2005, Gross was named the 2006 hitting coach 
for the Phillies' high-A Clearwater Threshers minor-league team.[11] On 
November 28, 2006, Gross was named the hitting coach for the Phillies' 
Reading Phillies minor-league team.[12] Then, on December 13, 2007, Gross 
was named the 2008 hitting coach for the Phillies' Triple-A Lehigh Valley 
IronPigs minor league team.[13] On July 22, 2010, it was announced he would 
take over as hitting coach for the Philadelphia Phillies. On October 3, 
2012, Greg was fired from his position of hitting coach by the Philadelphia 
Phillies when they decided not to renew his contract for the 2013 season.[14] 
Gross has two children, Megan and Michael, and lives in West Chester, Pennsylvania.[15] 
Gross is honored annually by the AGA with the Greg Gross Open (GGO) golf 
tournament held at the Anetsberger Golf Club in Northbrook, IL. The 2008 
GGO will be held August 2. The reigning GGO champ is Scott Strangberg of 
Racine, Wisconsin. Greg Gross is now with Arizona Diamondback Organization 
as he is currently the Reno Aces Triple A Hitting Coach for 2013 season.[16]
