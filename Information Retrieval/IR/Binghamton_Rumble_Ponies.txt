Binghamton Mets (1992–2016) The Binghamton Rumble Ponies are an American 
minor league baseball team based in Binghamton, New York. The team, which 
plays in the Eastern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the New York 
Mets major-league club. The Rumble Ponies play in NYSEG Stadium, located 
in Binghamton. Prior to moving to Binghamton for 1992, the franchise played 
in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, from 1987 to 1991 as the Williamsport Bills. 
The team was an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians in 1987 and 1988, and 
was affiliated with the Seattle Mariners during the 1989 and 1990 seasons 
before being purchased by the New York Mets in 1991. The Bills franchise 
was actually two separate franchises. After the 1988 season, the original 
owners moved the Bills to Hagerstown, Maryland, while the Eastern League 
franchise based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, moved back to Williamsport 
before the 1989 season. It was the latest in a long series of moves for 
the Pittsfield franchise, which was originally based in Williamsport in 
1976 and later moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, from 1977 through 1978 
and then Buffalo, New York, from 1979 through 1984. The current franchise 
is planning to change the team's name effective for the 2017 season and 
is committed to staying in Binghamton for the foreseeable future.[1] The 
team held a name-the-team contest on its website from May 17th to June 
1st; the finalists were the Bullheads (for the bullhead catfish abundant 
in the nearby Susquehanna River), Gobblers (for the rich hunting culture 
of the area, as well as the turkeys in Binghamton), Rocking Horses (for 
the Triple Cities' nickname as the "Carousel Capital of The World"), Rumble 
Ponies (also a carousel tribute), Stud Muffins (for the collections of 
carousel horses in Binghamton), and Timber Jockeys (for everyone who rides 
the carousels).[2][3] On November 3, 2016, the team announced that they 
would be rebranding as the Binghamton Rumble Ponies and released a new 
logo. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches 7-day disabled
