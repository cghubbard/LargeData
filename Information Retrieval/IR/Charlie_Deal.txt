Charles Albert Deal (October 30, 1891 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania – September 
16, 1979 in Covina, California), was a professional baseball player who 
played third base in the Major Leagues from 1912 to 1921. He would play 
for the Chicago Cubs, Boston Braves, St. Louis Browns, St. Louis Terriers, 
and Detroit Tigers.[1] In 1914, Deal was a member of the Braves team that 
went from last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team 
to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[2] The 
team then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia 
Athletics in the 1914 World Series. When his request for a salary increase 
for 1915 was rejected, Deal jumped to the Federal League, playing for the 
St. Louis Terriers.[3] Deal only played 65 games for the Terriers, due 
to being hospitalised with a bout of typhoid fever.[4] In 1917 Deal led 
the National League in sacrifice hits with 29. He also proved to be very 
reliable defensively, leading National League third baseman in fielding 
three years in a row (1919–1921).[5] Deal then played for several teams 
in the Pacific Coast League in the mid-1920s, before ending his career
