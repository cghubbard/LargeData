New York State Route 80 (NY 80) is a west–east New York State Route located 
within Onondaga, Madison, Chenango, Otsego, Herkimer, and Montgomery counties 
in New York. Its western terminus is located at a junction with NY 175 
in the city of Syracuse in Onondaga County, from which it actually runs 
in a north–south direction for 20 miles (32 km). The eastern terminus is 
located at a junction with NY 5 in the village of Nelliston in Montgomery 
County. The route is signed north–south within Montgomery County. Most 
of NY 80 between Sherburne and Cooperstown follows the routing of the Second 
Great Western Turnpike, a 19th-century toll road. Although NY 80 follows 
an east–west alignment for most of its routing, two sections, located on 
its western and easternmost ends, are either signed as north–south (as 
is the case in Montgomery County) or physically oriented from north to 
south (such as in central Onondaga County). NY 80 begins at an intersection 
with NY 175 in southern Syracuse. The route, named Valley Drive, proceeds 
south through a largely residential area of Syracuse, following the path 
of Onondaga Creek through the area. 1 mile (1.6 km) to the south of NY 175 
(and 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the interchange between Interstate 81 and 
Interstate 481), NY 80 intersects NY 173 (the old path of the Seneca Turnpike) 
near the southern city limits. Past NY 173, NY 80 parallels U.S. Route 11, 
I-81, and Onondaga Creek as all four head south out of Syracuse. At the 
city line, NY 80 becomes South Onondaga Road. In Onondaga, south of Syracuse, 
NY 80 briefly enters the Onondaga Nation Territory, cutting across the 
northwestern corner of the reservation before turning to follow the western 
edge of the territory. NY 80 leaves to the southwest shortly after to serve 
South Onondaga and intersect U.S. Route 20 at Lords Corners. Past US 20, 
NY 80 continues south to Otisco (coming within 3 miles (5 km) of Otisco 
Lake), then curves southeast to the Tully hamlet of Vesper before turning 
fully to the east as it enters the village of Tully. Just west of Tully, 
NY 80 intersects NY 11A, US 11, and NY 281 on opposite sides of an overpass 
carrying I-81 over NY 80. Here, all three routes, plus County Route 134 
(CR 134) to the southwest, act as frontage roads for I-81 exit 14. US 11 
joins NY 80 east of the interchange, following the route into Tully. US 11 
heads south at the village center; NY 80, however, continues eastward, 
overlapping NY 91 near Fabius and NY 13 in western Madison County. Past 
NY 13, NY 80 continues southeast to Georgetown, where it meets NY 26. The 
two routes conjoin and head south into Chenango County before separating 
shortly after crossing the county line. Within Chenango County, NY 80 largely 
follows an east–west routing with a slight curve to the southeast. Incorporated 
municipalities 80 passes through within Chenango County include Smyrna, 
Sherburne, and New Berlin. East of Smyrna, NY 80 continues east, then curves 
to the southeast as it approaches the Otsego County line, delimited by 
the Unadilla River. After crossing over the Chenango River and into Sherburne, 
NY 80 intersects NY 12 and begins to follow the old path of the Second 
Great Western Turnpike across Central New York. The route continues east 
to Columbus, where NY 80 separates from the old routing of the turnpike 
and heads southeast to intersect NY 8 north of New Berlin. NY 80 turns 
south onto NY 8, overlapping the route to New Berlin, where the routes 
split at the village center. Outside of New Berlin, NY 80 heads northeast 
to Burlington, rejoining the routing of the Second Great Western Turnpike 
just west of an intersection with NY 51 in West Burlington. NY 80 turns 
north onto NY 51, creating a brief, 1-mile (1.6 km) long concurrency between 
the two routes. NY 51 and NY 80 split soon after, with NY 51 continuing 
onward toward Utica. NY 80 heads due east from NY 51 to Otsego, where it 
meets NY 205. NY 205 joins NY 80 eastward into a small valley surrounding 
Oaks Creek, where the two routes meet NY 28. While NY 205 terminates here, 
NY 80 joins NY 28, following the route east across the creek and through 
the hamlet of Fly Creek. To the east of Fly Creek, NY 28 and NY 80 ascend 
in elevation for a short distance prior to descending into a valley home 
to both the southern tip of Otsego Lake and the historic village of Cooperstown 
at its tip. Shortly after entering Cooperstown, the two routes split as 
NY 28 turns south at Chestnut Street, following the roadway out of the 
village toward Oneonta. NY 80, however, turns north onto Chestnut and continues 
into the heart of the village, where it intersects Main Street, a street 
lined with shops catering to tourists who visit the nearby National Baseball 
Hall of Fame. At this intersection, the Second Great Western Turnpike turned 
east; however, NY 80 continues north on Chestnut for another block before 
turning onto Lake Street and following the street out of the village. Outside 
of Cooperstown, NY 80 heads north along the western edge of Otsego Lake, 
passing by both the Fenimore Art Museum and the Farmers' Museum just north 
of Cooperstown. Near the northern tip of the lake in Springfield, NY 80 
intersects US 20 (the former Cherry Valley Turnpike) for the second time. 
The route continues northward, although the progression becomes more northeasterly 
as it crosses into the rural southeastern corner of Herkimer County. NY 80's 
stay within the county is brief, featuring no points of interest other 
than an intersection with NY 168 located at the midpoint between where 
NY 80 traverses the Otsego and Montgomery County lines. Upon entering Montgomery 
County, NY 80 becomes signed as a north–south route even though the track 
of the route is as east–west as it has been since turning northward in 
Cooperstown. NY 80 heads east to Fort Plain, a village located on the Mohawk 
River (here serving as the path of the Erie Canal), and becomes Main Street. 
At Kellogg Street, NY 80 is joined by NY 163 for two blocks to an intersection 
with NY 5S (Canal Street) in the heart of the village. Here, NY 163 ends 
while NY 5S and NY 80 come together on Main Street for a short overlap 
to Hancock Street, where NY 5S turns southeast and continues toward Canajoharie. 
NY 80, however, continues through and out of the village to the northeast 
on Main, Willett, and River Streets. Once on River, NY 80 passes under 
the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) and crosses the Mohawk River 
before terminating at NY 5 on the opposite bank in Nelliston. The routing 
of most of modern NY 80 between Sherburne and Cooperstown was originally 
part of the Second Great Western Turnpike, an early toll road established 
in 1801. The road began at the eastern bank of the Chenango River in Sherburne 
and proceeded east through Cooperstown to Cherry Valley,[4] where it connected 
to the First Great Western Turnpike and, later, the Third Great Western 
Turnpike. While what is now NY 80 dips south to serve New Berlin, the turnpike 
bypassed the settlement to the north, favoring a direct alignment between 
Columbus and Edmeston.[5] When the first set of posted routes in New York 
were assigned in 1924, none of the former turnpike was incorporated into 
the system; however, a road between Cooperstown and Springfield along the 
western edge of Otsego Lake was designated as part of NY 28.[6] By 1926, 
a small segment of the ex-Second Great Western Turnpike between Edmeston 
and West Burlington was signed as part of NY 44.[7] The NY 80 designation 
was created in the late 1920s and originally assigned to a previously unnumbered 
roadway between U.S. Route 20 in Springfield and NY 10A in Indian Lake 
via Nelliston and Speculator. North of Nelliston, NY 80 followed what is 
now NY 10 and NY 30. From Arietta to Speculator, NY 80 overlapped NY 54 
(now NY 8).[1][2] In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, 
NY 80 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Nelliston;[8] however, 
it was also extended southward and westward to NY 173 in Syracuse, replacing 
NY 28 from Springfield to Cooperstown[2][9] and NY 44 from New Berlin to 
West Burlington.[8] From Sherburne to Columbus and from West Burlington 
to Cooperstown, NY 80 utilized a previously unnumbered roadway that roughly 
followed the former alignment of the Second Great Western Turnpike. The 
remainder of the roadway between Syracuse and Sherburne, and from Columbus 
to New Berlin, was also previously unnumbered.[10] NY 80 was extended northward 
to its present terminus at NY 175 by 1932.[11] The 2.5 miles (4.0 km) portion 
of NY 80 between Vincent Corners Road (CR 178) and the Madison County line 
was initially maintained by Onondaga County. On April 1, 1980, ownership 
and maintenance of this section of the route was transferred from the county 
to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between
