Chalmer Luman Harris (January 17, 1915 – November 11, 1996) was an American 
right-handed pitcher, coach, manager, and scout in Major League Baseball. 
Born in the village of New Castle, Alabama, his playing career began with 
the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association in 1937. His catcher that 
season was Paul Richards, who in 1938 became Atlanta's player-manager. 
Richards and Harris would form a decades-long association in baseball at 
the minor and Major League levels. The 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m), 185 lb (84 kg) 
Harris compiled a 35–63 record with a 4.16 earned-run average in 151 American 
League games with the Philadelphia Athletics and (briefly) Washington Senators 
from 1941–47. The remainder of his Major League career would be spent working 
in tandem with Richards, initially as a coach with the Chicago White Sox 
(1951–54), Baltimore Orioles (1955–61), and Houston Colt .45s (1962–64). 
In each case he worked under Richards, who was either his manager, general 
manager, or (in Baltimore from 1955–58) both. Despite his playing background, 
Harris was never a pitching coach; he usually served as a third-base coach. 
Harris' first managerial experience came late in the 1961 season. Richards 
stepped down as skipper of the Orioles on August 30 to become the general 
manager of the expansion Colt .45s, and Harris took command as interim 
pilot of the OrioIes on September 1. He led them to 17 wins in 27 games 
(.630), as the club finished third in the American League. After the season, 
however, Harris rejoined Richards in Houston as a coach, and Billy Hitchcock 
took over as Baltimore's permanent skipper for 1962. Harris served for 
almost three full seasons as a Colt .45 coach under Harry Craft, until 
September 19, 1964, when Richards promoted him to manager.[1] In 1965, 
Harris managed the re-christened Houston Astros, serving for the team's 
debut season in the Astrodome. But the 1965 Astros went only 65–97 to finish 
ninth in the ten-team National League, and at the end of the year, Richards 
was fired and Harris was replaced by Grady Hatton as the Astros' pilot. 
Harris then served as a Houston scout in 1966. In August 1966, Richards 
became the vice president for baseball operations (in effect, general manager) 
of the Atlanta Braves and Harris rejoined his old boss in 1967 as skipper 
of the Richmond Braves, Atlanta's Triple-A farm club. Then, from 1968 to 
the middle of the 1972 season, Harris managed the big-league Braves (ironically, 
succeeding Hitchcock). Harris led Atlanta to 93 victories and the first-ever 
National League West Division championship in 1969 (both the National and 
American Leagues now had two divisions after expanding from 10 teams to 
12) for the franchise's first postseason berth since losing the 1958 World 
Series as the Milwaukee Braves. But Harris' Braves lost the National League 
Championship Series to the eventual world champion New York Mets. When 
the Braves slumped in ensuing years, Richards was fired during the 1972 
season, on June 1, and Harris was replaced on August 6, 1972, as manager 
by former Braves' third baseman Eddie Mathews.[2] Harris' final managerial 
record was 466–488 (.488). Harris died of diabetes at age 81 in Pell City,
