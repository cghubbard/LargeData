Estadio Sixto Escobar is a multi-purpose stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
It is currently used mostly for soccer matches. The stadium was opened 
on November 12, 1935. The Cincinnati Reds has conducted spring training 
at the stadium since 1936.[1] In April 1938, the Legislative Assembly of 
Puerto Rico voted to name the stadium and surrounding park in honor of 
Sixto Escobar, a Puerto Rican professional boxer who became Puerto Rico's 
first world champion.[2] A statue of Escobar stands on the grounds. The 
Miami Marlins were transferred to San Juan for the 1961 season and opened 
the season at Sixto Escobar Stadium. Attendance was poor and the team was 
moved to Charleston, WV on May 19, 1961. The Cangrejeros de Santurce of 
the professional Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente moved out 
to the newly-constructed Hiram Bithorn Stadium in 1962. Many events of 
the 1979 Pan American Games were held at the stadium. In 2011 the stadium 
was repaired and improved to accommodate the new tenant soccer team River 
Plate Puerto Rico, [3] but the club never played there. Coordinates: 18°27′55″N
