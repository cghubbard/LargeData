The Fort Duquesne Bridge is a steel tied arch bridge that spans the Allegheny 
River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was colloquially referred to as "The 
Bridge to Nowhere". It was constructed from 1958-1963 by PennDOT, and opened 
for traffic October 17, 1969 with its predecessor Manchester Bridge (located 
closer to the tip of Point State Park) closing that same day (it was demolished 
in the autumn of 1970). The bridge was given the name "The Bridge to Nowhere" 
because the main span was finished in 1963, but due to delays in acquiring 
right of ways for the northern approach ramps, it did not connect on the 
north side of the Allegheny River. The total cost was budgeted at $5 million 
in 1962.[1] The lack of approach ramps meant the bridge ended in midair, 
rendering it useless. The northwestern ramps were completed in 1969, allowing 
access to Pennsylvania Route 65. The northeastern ramps were completed 
in 1986, with the construction of the northern section of Interstate 279 
(North Shore Expressway) which runs through Downtown Pittsburgh's Golden 
Triangle and north towards Interstate 79. The bridge touches down halfway 
between Heinz Field and PNC Park Baseball Stadium on the City's North Shore. 
On December 12, 1964, Frederick Williams, a 21-year-old chemistry major 
at the University of Pittsburgh, drove a 1959 Chrysler station wagon off 
the end of the bridge and landed unhurt on the other side. His adventure 
is documented in WQED-TV's Mid-Atlantic region Emmy Award-winning documentary 
"Flying off the Bridge to Nowhere and Other Tales of Pittsburgh Bridges", 
narrated by Rick Sebak. Within a few weeks of this near tragedy, an iconic 
Pittsburgh radio personality, Rege Cordic, distributed commemorative bumper 
stickers which read "Official Entry, Cordic & Company Bridge Leap Contest." 
With thousands of vehicles bearing these stickers on Pittsburgh's streets, 
the city responded by blocking off the end of the bridge with concrete
