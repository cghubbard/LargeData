Adrián Beltré Pérez (born April 7, 1979), nicknamed "The Captain", is a 
Dominican professional baseball third baseman for the Texas Rangers of 
Major League Baseball (MLB). Originally signed as an amateur free agent 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994, he made his MLB debut with the Dodgers 
at age 19, and has since become one of the most all-round accomplished 
players in history, ranking 13th in defensive Wins Above Replacement and 
the fourth third baseman to achieve 400 home runs and 1,500 runs batted 
in. Beltré is a four-time selection for the Silver Slugger Award and MLB 
All-Star Game, and a five-time winner of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award. 
He has also played for the Seattle Mariners and Boston Red Sox. He bats 
and throws right-handed. Now fewer than 100 hits from reaching 3,000, Beltré 
is the all-time hits leader among Dominican-born players. The fifth major 
leaguer to hit at least 100 home runs for three different teams, he has 
hit at least 20 home runs in 12 different seasons, and in five, driven 
in at least 100 runs. He hit a major league-leading 48 home runs while 
playing for the Dodgers in 2004, was the team MVP of the Red Sox in 2010, 
and led the major leagues in hits in 2011 while playing for the Rangers. 
Sharing the record as one of four major leaguers to hit for the cycle three 
times, Beltré is the only one to hit three at the same stadium, Globe Life 
Park in Arlington. He is the sixth player with a three-home run game in 
both the regular season and postseason, and just the second with a both 
a three-home run game and cycle in the same week. He ranks in the top ten 
all-time at his position in games played, assists, putouts, and double 
plays. Beltré is also known for his dislike of anyone touching the top 
of his head, which teammates have frequently done – including Rangers teammates, 
notably Elvis Andrus. He is currently signed through 2018. The Los Angeles 
Dodgers signed Beltré as an amateur free agent from the Dominican Republic 
in 1994. The youngest player in the National League when he made his MLB 
debut for the Dodgers in 1998, Beltré has also played for the Seattle Mariners 
and Boston Red Sox. In 2004, he led MLB in HR, in doubles in 2010, and 
in hits in 2013. He is 25th all-time in defensive Wins Above Replacement 
(23.2), first among active players, and ninth all-time among third basemen 
in total zone runs (114). Beltré was signed out of the Dominican Republic 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1994 by Ralph Avila, the father of major 
league general manager Al Avila and grandfather of All-Star catcher Alex 
Avila. Beltré attended Liceo Máximo Gómez High School. While working out 
at Campo Las Palmas in 1994, a Los Angeles Dodgers facility – one of the 
first of its kind for an MLB team in the Dominican Republic – he was spotted 
by scouts Ralph Avila and Pablo Peguero. Though only 15 and weighing just 
130 pounds, Beltré featured a quick swing and live throwing arm. On the 
insistence of Avila and Peguero, the Dodgers signed him in July 1994 with 
a $23,000 bonus.[1] After being called up to the majors from the then-Dodgers' 
double-A affiliate San Antonio Missions, Beltré made his major league debut 
on June 24, 1998, starting at third base in the first game of an interleague 
series against the Anaheim Angels. At the time, he was the youngest player 
in the National League (NL).[2] During his first at-bat, Beltré hit a two-out 
run batted in (RBI) double off Angels starter Chuck Finley into left field 
to score Paul Konerko from second base to tie the game. Belté hit his first 
home run six days later against Texas Rangers starter Rick Helling. At 
the end of the 1998 season, Beltré finished with 13 errors at third base 
while batting .215 with seven home runs. At one point in the spring training 
prior to the start of the 1999 season, Beltré's agent, Scott Boras, commented 
to him that "he couldn't believe" his relatively rapid ascent to the majors 
and handling of "such a difficult position like third base" at age 20. 
Beltré replied that he was 19 years old, not 20. Boras then realized that 
his date of birth in the Dodgers' records was incorrect and indicated the 
same to the team, but, that if they were to correct the mistake by compensating 
Beltré for signing him at younger than MLB's allowable age, they would 
no longer pursue the issue. Team personnel at Las Palmas denied Boras' 
assertion.[3] As a result, Boras and Beltré went public. Boras convinced 
Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig to investigate the Dodgers, and Major 
League Baseball suspended their scouting operations in the Dominican Republic 
for one year,[1] as well as Avila and Peguero. Dodgers general manager 
Fred Claire, whom MLB did not contact during their investigation, publicly 
expressed surprise and that he was unaware of the incident.[3] Selig awarded 
Beltré $48,500 in damages.[4] Beltré averaged .265 and 18 home runs per 
season from 1999 through 2003. Of 810 total games played, he started 710 
and was graded with a .948 fielding percentage. In 2004, Beltré had a breakout 
season in which he established a number of career highs, including leading 
MLB with 48 home runs. Other career highs included batting .334, 200 hits, 
121 RBI, 104 runs scored, .629 slugging percentage, and a then-career high 
32 doubles. He finished second in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player 
Award (MVP) and was honored with his first career Silver Slugger Award 
and the Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[5] The Seattle Mariners signed Beltré 
as a free agent before the 2005 season to a five-year, $64 million deal.[6] 
Regressing to his pre-2004 form, he batted just .255 with 19 home runs 
and 87 RBI. Manager Mike Hargrove did not give up hope on Beltré, saying, 
"I think it's a season that, personally, he's disappointed in. I think 
it was a year that he will improve on the longer he's here and the longer 
he's in the American League." After batting .167 through April 10, Ted 
Miller of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote that Beltré may become one 
of the Mariners' greatest busts.[7] By June 5, 2006, Beltré's batting average 
was slowly improving, from .109 on April 16 to .236 at that time. After 
hitting his first home run in April, and his second later that month, Beltré's 
hitting began to improve. On July 23, 2006, against the Boston Red Sox, 
Beltré hit an inside-the-park home run, the first one ever in Safeco Field 
history.[8] Though it was not a great season for Beltré, it was statistically 
his best as a Mariner. He hit .276, had 26 home runs, 99 RBI, and a career 
high 41 doubles. He also was honored with a Fielding Bible Award for being 
the top MLB defensive third baseman during the year.[9] The 2007 season 
was not one of Beltré's better defensive years statistically. He tied with 
Brandon Inge for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, with 18, but 
ranked second in the league in assists, total chances, and range factor. 
He was charged with the lowest fielding percentage of all third basemen 
in the league at .958.[10][11] In spite of leading third basemen in errors, 
Beltré was selected for his first Rawlings Gold Glove Award, becoming the 
first Mariners third baseman to win the award.[12] On September 1, 2008, 
Beltré hit for the cycle, at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington,[13] becoming 
the fourth Mariner to do so. Arizona Diamondbacks shortstop Stephen Drew 
hit for the cycle that day as well, the first time two players had done 
so since 1920.[14] He won his second Fielding Bible Award for his defense 
that year.[15] Beltré's decision not to wear a cup despite playing third 
base has been well-documented.[16] This came back to hurt him on August 
13, 2009, when he took a hard ground ball to the groin.[17][18] Although 
he stayed in for the remainder of the 14-inning victory, he was put on 
the DL after suffering bleeding in one of his testicles.[19] In his first 
game after returning from the DL, teammate Ken Griffey Jr. conspired with 
those responsible for the Safeco Field public address system to have Beltré's 
at-bat intro music be the opening march from The Nutcracker Suite.[20] 
Beltré declared free agency on November 5, 2009.[21] On January 7, 2010, 
Beltré signed a one-year, $9 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, which 
had a $5 million player option for 2011 with a $1 million buyout.[22] Beltré 
led the Red Sox in batting average (.321) in 2010 and tied David Ortiz 
for the team lead in RBIs (102). He finished the year with 189 hits in 
589 at-bats. He had 28 home runs and 84 runs scored. Beltré led the Majors 
in doubles, with 49 (also a career high). He also finished fourth in the 
AL in batting average, and was fifth in the AL in total bases (326) and 
slugging percentage (.553). He also had two stolen bases on the year, and 
finished ninth in the MVP voting.[23] On defense, he tied for the AL lead 
in errors by a third baseman, with 19.[24] Beltré was also partially responsible 
for the Red Sox injuries woes that year, as he had two separate collisions 
with outfielders Jacoby Ellsbury and Jeremy Hermida, breaking their ribs 
in both instances. On January 5, 2011, Beltré signed a five-year (2011–15), 
$80 million contract with a vesting option for $16 million for the 2016 
season with the Texas Rangers. He was on the 2011 American League All-Star 
team.[2] On July 22, Beltré strained his hamstring and was also placed 
on the DL. On September 4, he hit a line single to right against the Red 
Sox for his 2,000th career hit. On September 11, Beltré hit two home runs, 
including the 300th of his career, against the Oakland Athletics. He was 
named the AL Player of the Month for September.[25] In 2011, Beltré batted 
.296 with 32 home runs, fifth in the AL.[2] He was third in the American 
League in slugging percentage (.561), sixth in RBIs (105), and ninth in 
OPS (.892).[2] The Fielding Bible staff estimated that he saved 17 runs 
on defense in 2011.[26] On October 4, 2011, in Game 4 of the ALDS against 
the Tampa Bay Rays, Beltré became the sixth player—the first in a Division 
Series—to hit three home runs in a Major League playoff game.[27][28] He 
added a fourth playoff home run in Game 5 of the 2011 World Series when 
he went down to one knee chasing an outside curve ball from Chris Carpenter.[29][30] 
The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games.[31] Beltré 
finished that postseason with five home runs and nine RBI. More recognition 
was bestowed to Beltré for his defense. On November 1, 2011, he was honored 
with his third Gold Glove Award and first by a Ranger third baseman since 
Buddy Bell's six-year run from 1979–84.[32] He also won his third Fielding 
Bible Award.[26] On November 2, 2011 he was awarded the Silver Slugger 
Award.[33] Once again voted to the All-Star Game on July 1, 2012, Beltré 
was named a starter. He joined teammates Josh Hamilton and Mike Napoli 
on the All-Star team. It was Beltré's third All-Star Game and third in 
a row dating back to 2010 with the Boston Red Sox.[34][35] In the August 
22, 2012, game against the Baltimore Orioles, Beltré hit three home runs 
in his first three at-bats, including two in the same inning. He joined 
Pablo Sandoval, Albert Pujols, George Brett, Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth 
as the only players to hit a three-homer game in both the regular season 
and the postseason.[36] On August 24, he hit for the cycle for the second 
time in his career. Both of his cycles came at Rangers Ballpark. With his 
first coming as a member of the Mariners, it was the first time in MLB 
history that a player had hit for the cycle more than once at the same 
stadium.[37] He joined Joe DiMaggio as the only two players in big league 
history to have a three-homer game and a cycle in the same week. For his 
efforts, Beltré was named the AL Player of the Week for August 20–26. During 
the seven games he hit .433 (13-for-30) with three doubles, one triple, 
five home runs, nine RBI and seven runs scored. He had the highest slugging 
percentage (1.100) in the majors, the most total bases (33), was tied for 
first in hits and home runs, and tied for second in RBI.[36] After the 
season, more defensive accolades followed Beltré. He won his second consecutive 
Fielding Bible Award and fourth overall.[38] He was also honored with the 
Gold Glove Award for the season on October 30,[39] and second Platinum 
Glove Award.[40] Wilson Sporting Goods honored him as one of their Defensive 
Players of the Year; in that year the award was established.[41] On July 
8, 2013, Beltré was named the American League Player of the Week for July 
1–7. He batted .478 (11-for-23) with four home runs, two doubles and five 
RBI in six games. He led the American League in home runs, slugging (1.087), 
OPS (1.607), total bases (25), and extra-base hits (six) while producing 
the fourth highest batting average. Beltré hit safely in all six games 
with two or more hits four times. He had the 24th multi-homer game of his 
career with a pair of home runs on July 4 against Seattle.[42] Maintaining 
his strong hitting throughout July, Beltré was named the American League 
Player of the Month, his fourth career monthly award. He batted .369 with 
four doubles, nine homers, 19 RBI and 13 runs scored over 26 games. He 
tied for the major league lead with both Alfonso Soriano, in home runs, 
and Torii Hunter, in total bases (69). Beltré also finished among the AL 
leaders in slugging percentage (second, .670), hits (tied for second, 38), 
extra-base hits (tied for fourth, 13), RBI (tied for fifth) and batting 
average (sixth). He capped off the month with a walk-off home run to lead 
the Rangers past the Angels on July 31, the seventh walk-off home run of 
his career, and first with Texas. It was his third monthly award with Texas, 
making him one of seven players to win multiple times with the Rangers, 
including Josh Hamilton (four), Rafael Palmeiro, Alex Rodriguez (both with 
three), Iván Rodríguez, Juan González and Rubén Sierra (two each).[43] 
For the 2013 season, Beltré played in 161 games and totaled a .315 average, 
30 homers, 92 RBI and .509 SLG. He led the American League with 199 hits 
and was fourth in batting average and fifth in total bases (321). He also 
made the top-10 in games played, slugging percentage and home runs. In 
the AL MVP voting, he was tied for seventh place. The Dallas-Fort Worth 
chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America named Beltré the 
Texas Rangers Player of the Year.[44] On May 7, 2014, while facing Jorge 
de la Rosa of the Colorado Rockies, Beltré hit his 100th home run as a 
member of the Rangers, becoming only the fifth player in Major League history 
to hit 100 home runs with three different teams. He joined Darrell Evans, 
Reggie Jackson, Alex Rodriguez, and Jim Thome.[45] On June 24, 2014, Beltré 
singled off Drew Smyly of the Detroit Tigers for his 2,500th career hit, 
and the first hit of a 4-for-4 game.[46] On September 18, Beltré singled 
off Sonny Gray in the first inning for his 2,591st hit, surpassing Vladimir 
Guerrero as the all-time hit leader among Dominican-born players.[47] Beltré 
finished the 2014 season batting .324 – his highest average since 2004 
– with 19 home runs and 77 RBI in 148 games. In February 2015, the Rangers 
picked up Beltré's option, which would have become guaranteed if he had 
reached 586 plate appearances in the 2015 season.[48][49] While playing 
the Cleveland Indians on May 15, 2015, Beltré hit his 400th home run on 
a sinker from Bruce Chen. He became the 52nd player in MLB history to reach 
that plateau, and the fourth to do so while playing at least 75 per cent 
of his games at third base.[50] Enduring a torn ligament in his left thumb 
over the last three months of the season, Beltré had surgery to repair 
it immediately after the season ended.[51] On August 3, 2015, Beltré hit 
for the cycle with hits in each of the first, second, third, and fifth 
innings against the Houston Astros at Globe Life Park in Arlington in a 
12–9 win. It was his third career cycle, second as a Ranger, and third 
at Globe Life, the Rangers' home park, making him the only player ever 
to hit three cycles in one stadium. He became the first Rangers player 
to hit for multiple cycles. The first player in 82 years to hit for a third 
cycle, he became the fourth player to do so and tied the major league record 
for total career cycles, joining Long John Reilly, Bob Meusel and Babe 
Herman.[52] The Phi Delta Theta fraternity presented Beltré with the 2014 
Lou Gehrig Memorial Award on September 17, 2015, making him the first Rangers 
player to win the award. He had contributed significantly to humanitarian 
acts in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex such as Texas Rangers Baseball 
Foundation, Texas Rangers RBI program, the I Love Baseball program, which 
operates in the Dominican Republic, the Baseball Tomorrow Fund, as well 
as the foundations established by a number of major league players.[53] 
During the last week of the season, and the Rangers' run towards the AL 
West championship, Beltré batted .448 with two home runs and 13 RBI. He 
also went 2-4 with a home in the final game of the season to help the Rangers 
advance to their sixth AL West title. He finished the season with 18 home 
runs, 83 RBI, 163 hits, and .287 average. On April 15, 2016, Beltré and 
the Rangers agreed to a two-year, $36 million contract extension that would 
cover the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Valued at $18 million each for both seasons, 
the extension prevented Beltré from becoming a free agent at the end of 
the season.[54] Displaying a drop to one knee, Beltré hit a home run on 
a curve ball from Jesse Hahn of Oakland on May 17.[55] In a May 29 game 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Beltré hit a two-run home run off Juan 
Nicasio to give him 1,501 career RBI, making him the 54th player to reach 
the milestone, and the fourth third baseman.[56] On July 2, 2016, Beltré 
became the 28th player all time to amass 10,000 career at-bats.[57] On 
July 23, 2016, he became the 36th player all time to record 11,000 career 
plate appearances. Two days later, he hit the walk-off home run, the ninth 
of his career, against the Athletics in the bottom of the ninth inning 
for a 7−6 win.[58] On August 24, 2016, Beltré, in a game against the Cincinnati 
Reds, hit a go-ahead two-out double for his 2,900th career hit and led 
the Rangers to a 6-5 win. With this hit, Beltré became the 39th player 
in Major League history to reach the milestone.[59] Beltré would once again 
show his signature home run knee drop after hitting a solo shot in the 
second inning in a game against the Houston Astros on September 13, 2016. 
His 30th of the season, it was the first time he reached the mark since 
2013 and fifth in his career.[60] Ten days later, his two-run home run 
in the eighth inning against the Athletics aided the Rangers in clinching 
the American League West division crown for the second year in a row and 
the seventh in franchise history. He also reached 100 RBI for the first 
time since 2012, and the fifth time in his career.[61] Beltré's signature 
home run swing includes a drop to one knee when connecting with a breaking 
ball, particularly notable during Game 5 of the 2011 World Series in an 
at bat against Cardinals ace pitcher Chris Carpenter.[30] At times he swings 
so hard that he falls to one knee.[62] During a game against the Red Sox 
on June 26, 2016, Sandy León hit a foul ball which landed in the first 
row in the stands, just out of Beltré's reach. However, instead of returning 
immediately to the infield, he reached very close to the ball in a motion 
as if he was going to take the fan who caught León's foul ball.[63] Beltré 
is also known for his dislike of anyone touching the top of his head, which 
teammates have done frequently. Much to his disdain, the act has turned 
into a game, inducing repeat offenders such as Rangers teammate Elvis Andrus.[64] 
Beltré also appreciates Gatorade showers equally to his head being tapped. 
After a game in which he hit a grand slam that provided the decisive runs 
in a 5–2 win over the Athletics on August 15, 2016, he took a broom from 
the groundskeepers closet and began combing an area of infield dirt. Still, 
Rougned Odor trotted to Beltré carrying a bucket filled with Gatorade, 
and in his attempt to drench Beltré, missed him with the launch of the 
column of the liquid.[65] Regarding Beltré's defense, master infield instructor 
and former Rangers manager Ron Washington, stated that the proper way to 
approach a ground ball to third base is to "flow through" the ball. After 
the Rangers signed Beltré to a five-year contract before the 2011 season, 
they sought to improve his skill by pairing him with Washington. He opined 
that Beltré's technique is wrong because he stops before catching and then 
throws in spite of relying very little on the positioning of his feet. 
Essentially, his hands are so quick and his arm is so strong and he pivots 
and releases with uncanny precision from any angle that it hardly necessitates 
proper foot positioning in comparison to how many third basemen play.[66] 
Another major league manager, Joe Maddon, compared the unique style of 
Beltré's defensive play to Ozzie Smith’s "flair at shortstop", Stan Musial’s 
"coiled batting stance" and the way Steve Carlton wrapped his left wrist 
before releasing a slider. Commented Maddon further on Beltré's defense, 
"There’s a lot of guys that did things unique to them that weren’t out 
of the Spalding Guide. They did things you wouldn’t teach, and if somebody 
else tried to do it, they would not be very good.”[66] Commented Rangers 
bench coach Steve Buechele, "he's not your most conventional third baseman, 
he does things his own way and has developed his own style over his career 
but there's something to be said for his hand-eye coordination and his 
hands. It's remarkable what he does. ... He's a super smart player, knows 
where to position himself."[67] Olympic gymnast and Dallas-area native 
Madison Kocian threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the September 3, 
2016 game against the Astros and commended Beltré. When asked of her preference 
between meeting singer Beyoncé and Beltré, Kocian chose Beltré, as "[he 
is] probably my number one because I'm a huge Rangers fan so he's always 
been an inspiration for me. He's dealt with a lot of injuries as well, 
and he's fought through them, and he's just a team player overall, so I've 
looked up to him for a long time." Further, having competed at the Summer 
Olympic in Rio de Janeiro just weeks prior, she added more to the first 
pitch than the typical windup, flaunting her unique style of artistic acrobatics.[68] 
Actively involved in the community, Beltré has contributed significantly 
to humanitarian acts in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex such as Texas Rangers 
Baseball Foundation, Texas Rangers RBI program, the I Love Baseball program, 
which operates in the Dominican Republic, and the Baseball Tomorrow Fund. 
Further, he has donated to Dave Valle's Esperanza International as well 
as foundations established by other major league players, including Robinson
