George Henry Derby (July 6, 1857 – July 4, 1925), nicknamed "Johan", was 
a professional baseball player from 1877 to 1883. He played three seasons 
in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher for the Detroit Wolverines 
in 1881 and 1882 and for the Buffalo Bisons in 1883. Derby won 29 games 
and led the National League in both strikeouts and shutouts as a 24-year-old 
rookie in 1881. However, after pitching 55 complete games and almost 500 
innings in 1881, Derby developed shoulder problems that reduced the velocity 
of his pitches. His career was cut short, and he played in his final major 
league game in July 1883 at age 25. Derby was born in Webster, Massachusetts, 
in 1857.[1] He began his professional baseball career at age 19 in 1877 
with the Hornellsville, New York team in the League Alliance. He next played 
for the Syracuse Stars of the International Association in 1878 and the 
Washington Nationals of the National Association in 1879 and 1880. In 1880, 
he compiled a 10–7 record and a remarkable 0.57 earned run average (ERA) 
in 158 innings for the Nationals.[2] Derby signed with the newly formed 
Detroit Wolverines for the 1881 season. He was described as "a compactly 
built, blonde haired, blue-eyed, pleasant-voiced gentleman who was to do 
all the pitching, and right well did he do his work."[3] During his rookie 
season, Derby led the National League in both strikeouts (212) and shutouts 
(9). He also established a franchise record for the Detroit Wolverines 
that was never broken with 494-2/3 innings pitched in 1881; Derby started 
55 games for Detroit, all complete games, and also had one relief appearance.[1] 
The Detroit Free Press described Derby's rise to stardom in the first part 
of the 1881 season: "His speed was moderate, but he was the master of all 
the crooks and curves that can be imparted to the aerial projectiles. In 
obedience to his will, the ball twisted out or in, up or down. He held 
batsmen at his mercy to a degree equalled by no other pitcher. He was the 
wizard of the pitcher's box, and within a month George H. Derby had risen 
from obscurity to fame in base ball circles."[3] He finished the 1881 season 
with a 29–26 record, a 2.20 earned run average (ERA), and an Adjusted ERA+ 
of 131.[1] However, late in the 1881 season, Derby's dominance waned, and 
opposing teams began hitting him more freely. When the Detroit team included 
him on its reserve list at the end of the 1881 season, some questioned 
the decision. The Detroit Free Press noted that there were suspicions that 
Derby's decline had been intentional: "For three months [Derby and Bennett] 
formed the most effective battery in the League, playing game after game 
without error. Wild pitches, wild throws, and passed balls were almost 
unknown to them. Then they began to make errors . . . In plain words, they 
both, for some incomprehensible reason, began playing badly . . . Suspicion 
was common, and it sometimes found a voice, that Detroit's famous battery 
were 'playing for a release.'"[4] It was revealed the next year that Derby 
had begun experiencing shoulder problems late in the 1881 season. Derby 
complained that he had been unable to "give force to the ball" and therefore 
pitched fewer games in August and September 1881.[3] In 1882, Derby proved 
fairly effective in the beginning of the season, but his velocity was off. 
In 1881, Derby had relied on the combination of speed and deceptive delivery. 
Without the speed, "batters had got accustomed to slow curve pitching, 
[and] he was hit freely and heavily."[3] Derby started 39 games and pitched 
362 innings in 1882 (down from 55 and 494 the year before) and compiled 
a 17-20 record. His ERA jumped by more than a point from 2.20 in 1881 to 
3.26 in 1882.[1] On September 14, 1882, the Detroit team suspended Derby 
for playing poorly. The Detroit Free Press wrote that Derby's star had 
sunk "beneath the base ball horizon" but questioned the fairness of a suspension: 
"If he [played poorly] intentionally, the sentence is just; if not, it 
is severe in the extreme. . . . He was wild in his delivery and had so 
little speed that the batters experienced little difficulty in hitting 
balls that came across the plate."[3] In October 1882, the Buffalo Bisons 
announced that Derby would join their team in 1883.[5] Derby's performance 
in 1883 at Buffalo continued the slide. He started only 13 games for Buffalo 
and compiled a 2-10 record with a 5.85 ERA. He appeared in his final major 
league game on July 3, 1883, at age 25.[1] Over his three major league 
seasons, Derby compiled a 48–56 record in 110 appearances, with a 3.01 
ERA and 428 strikeouts.[1] Derby died in Philadelphia at the age of 67.
