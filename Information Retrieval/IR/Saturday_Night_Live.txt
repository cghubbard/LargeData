Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live 
television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and 
developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, 
under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, 
which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large 
and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted 
by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs 
in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. 
An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone 
breaking character and proclaiming, "Live from New York, it's Saturday 
Night!", properly beginning the show. In 1980, Michaels left the series 
to explore other opportunities. He was replaced by Jean Doumanian, who 
was replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews. Ebersol ran the 
show until 1985, when Michaels returned; Michaels has remained since then. 
Many of SNL's cast found national stardom while appearing on the show, 
and achieved success in film and television, both in front of and behind 
the camera. Others associated with the show, such as writers, have gone 
on to successful careers creating, writing, or starring in TV and film. 
Broadcast from Studio 8H at NBC's headquarters in the Comcast Building, 
SNL has aired 814 episodes since its debut, and began its forty-second 
season on October 1, 2016, making it one of the longest-running network 
television programs in the United States. The show format has been developed 
and recreated in several countries, including Canada, Spain, Italy, South 
Korea, Japan, Brazil, and Finland, each meeting with different levels of 
success. Successful sketches have seen life outside of the show as feature 
films, although only two met with critical and financial success: The Blues 
Brothers (1980) and Wayne's World (1992). The show has been marketed in 
other ways, including home media releases of "best of" and whole seasons, 
and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running 
and developing the show. Throughout four decades on air, Saturday Night 
Live has received a number of awards, including 50 Primetime Emmy Awards, 
two Peabody Awards, and three Writers Guild of America Awards. In 2000, 
it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. 
It was ranked tenth in TV Guide's "50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time" list, 
and in 2007 it was listed as one of Time magazine's "100 Best TV Shows 
of All-TIME". As of 2012, it has received 156 Emmy nominations, the most 
received by any TV show. The live aspect of the show has resulted in several 
controversies and acts of censorship, with mistakes and intentional acts 
of sabotage by performers as well as guests. 1975–80 (seasons 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5) 1980–85 (seasons 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 1985–90 (seasons 11, 12, 13, 14, 
15) 1990–95 (seasons 16, 17, 18, 19, 20) 1995–2000 (seasons 21, 22, 23, 
24, 25) 2000–05 (seasons 26, 27, 28, 29, 30) 2005–10 (seasons 31, 32, 33, 
34, 35) 2010–15 (seasons 36, 37, 38, 39, 40) 2015–present (seasons 41, 
42) Weekend Update From 1965 until September 1975, NBC ran The Best of 
Carson reruns of The Tonight Show, airing them on either Saturday or Sunday 
night at local affiliates' discretion (originally known as The Saturday/Sunday 
Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson). In 1974 Johnny Carson announced that 
he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so that they could be aired 
during weeknights, allowing him to take time off.[1] In 1974 NBC president 
Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming, 
Dick Ebersol, and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night 
time slot. At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller, 
Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels. Over the next three 
weeks, Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter's idea for a variety show 
featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances. 
By 1975 Michaels had assembled a talented cast, including Dan Aykroyd, 
John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman, 
Michael O'Donoghue, Gilda Radner,[2] and George Coe.[3] The show was originally 
called NBC's Saturday Night, because Saturday Night Live was in use by 
Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC.[4] NBC 
purchased the rights to the name in 1976 and officially adopted the new 
title on March 26, 1977.[5] Debuting on October 11, 1975,[6] the show immediately 
developed a cult following, eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning 
(in 1978) "Best of Saturday Night Live" compilations that reached viewers 
who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts. But during the first 
season in 1975 and 1976, according to a book about the show authored by 
Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, some NBC executives were not satisfied with 
the show's Nielsen ratings and shares.[7] Lorne Michaels pointed out to 
them that Nielsen's measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers 
constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching 
the show, and many of them watched little else on television.[8] In 1975 
and 1976, they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers. 
NBC executives agreed with Michaels and decided to keep the show on the 
air despite many angry letters and phone calls that the network received 
from viewers who were offended by certain sketches.[9] They included a 
Weekend Update segment on April 24, 1976, the 18th episode, that ridiculed 
Aspen, Colorado murder suspect Claudine Longet and warranted an on-air 
apology by announcer Don Pardo during the following episode.[10] Herminio 
Traviesas, a censor who was vice president of the network's Standards and 
Practices department, objected to cast member Laraine Newman's use of the 
term "pissed off" in the March 13, 1976 episode with host Anthony Perkins, 
according to the book by Hill and Weingrad, and was in the process of placing 
the show on a permanent delay of several seconds, instead of live, but 
he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him.[11] Chevy 
Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a 
few months later by the then-unknown comic actor Bill Murray. Aykroyd and 
Belushi left the show in 1979 after the end of season four. In May 1980 
(after season five), Michaels—emotionally and physically exhausted—requested 
to put the show on hiatus for a year to give him time and energy to pursue 
other projects.[12] Concerned that the show would be cancelled without 
him, Michaels suggested writers Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Downey as 
his replacements. NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken, however, 
and was infuriated by Franken's Weekend Update routine called "Limo for 
a Lame-O," a scathing critique of Silverman's job performance at the network 
and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network's expense. 
Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment.[13] 
Unable to get the deal he wanted, Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount 
Pictures, intending to take his associate producer, Jean Doumanian, with 
him. Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position 
at SNL after being recommended by her friend, NBC vice president Barbara 
Gallagher.[14] Michaels' departure led to most of the cast and writing 
staff leaving the show.[15] The reputation of the show as a springboard 
to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series. 
Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less 
than three months, and NBC immediately cut the show's budget from the previous 
$1 million per episode down to just $350,000. Doumanian faced resentment 
and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff, particularly males who 
did not appreciate a woman believing she could take Michaels' place.[16] 
The season was a disaster; ratings plummeted, and audiences failed to connect 
to the original cast's replacements, such as Charles Rocket and Ann Risley.[15] 
Doumanian's fate was sealed when, during a sketch, Rocket said "fuck" on 
live television.[17] After only ten months, Doumanian was dismissed.[18][19] 
Although executives suggested that SNL be left to die, network chief Brandon 
Tartikoff wanted to keep the show on the air, believing that the concept 
was more important to the network than money. Tartikoff turned to Ebersol 
as his choice for the new producer. Ebersol previously had been fired by 
Silverman. Ebersol gained Michaels' approval in an attempt to avoid the 
same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian's tenure.[20] Ebersol's 
tenure saw commercial success, but was considered lackluster compared to 
the Michaels era, except for the breakout of cast member Eddie Murphy.[22] 
Murphy, the main draw of the cast, left in 1984 to pursue his already successful 
film career, and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast. He broke with 
history by hiring established comedians such as Billy Crystal and Martin 
Short who could bring their already successful material to the show.[20] 
Ebersol's final year with this new cast is considered one of the series' 
funniest, but had strayed far from the precedent-shattering show that Michaels 
had created.[23] After that season, Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp, 
including departing from the show's established "live" format.[citation 
needed] Following unsuccessful forays into film and television, in need 
of money, and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show,[24] Michaels 
finally returned in 1985 after Ebersol opted not to. The show was again 
recast, with Michaels borrowing Ebersol's idea, and seeking out established 
actors such as Joan Cusack and Robert Downey, Jr.[25] The cast and writers 
struggled creatively, and in April 1986, Tartikoff made the decision to 
cancel the show, until he was convinced by producer Bernie Brillstein to 
give it one more year.[26] The show was renewed but for the first time 
in its history, for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty-two.[27] 
Michaels again fired most of the cast and, learning his lesson from the 
previous seasons, sought out unknown talent such as Dana Carvey and Phil 
Hartman instead of known names.[27] The show ran successfully again until 
it lost Carvey and Hartman, two of its biggest stars, between 1992 and 
1994. Wanting to increase SNL's ratings and profitability, then-NBC West 
Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere 
in the show, recommending that new stars such as Chris Farley and Adam 
Sandler be fired because Ohlmeyer did not "get" them, and critiquing the 
costly nature of performing the show live. The show faced increasing criticism 
from the press and cast, in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping 
to weaken Michaels' position.[28] Michaels received a lucrative offer to 
develop a Saturday night project for CBS during this time, but remained 
loyal to SNL.[29] By 1995, Farley and Sandler were fired, and Mike Myers, 
another popular cast member, had left for a film career, but a new cast 
waited to replace them, featuring the likes of Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, 
and Tina Fey.[30] The show focused on performers, and writers were forced 
to supply material for the cast's existing characters before they could 
write original sketches.[31] By 1997, Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting 
Michaels' independence, forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast 
member Norm MacDonald.[32] The original 1975 cast of SNL, officially known 
on-air as "The Not Ready For Prime-Time Players",[33] a term coined by 
writer Herb Sargent,[34] included Laraine Newman, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, 
Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, Garrett Morris and Chevy Chase. Radner was the 
first person hired after Michaels himself. Although Chase became a performer, 
he was hired on a one-year writer contract, and refused to sign the performer 
contract that was repeatedly given to him, allowing him to leave the show 
after the first season in 1976.[35] Newman was brought aboard after having 
a prior working relationship with Michaels.[36] Morris was initially brought 
in as a writer, but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels 
to have Morris audition for the cast, where he turned in a successful performance.[37] 
Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired.[36] Belushi had 
a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear 
on other shows, but decided to work with the show because of the involvement 
of Radner, and writers Anne Beatts and Michael O'Donoghue.[38] Michaels 
was still reluctant to hire Belushi, believing he would be a source of 
trouble for the show, but Beatts, O'Donoghue and Ebersol successfully argued 
for his inclusion.[38] After Chase left the show he was replaced by Bill 
Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, but 
was unable to because of budget restrictions.[39] When Chase returned to 
host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and 
his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded by the rest of the cast, 
and Chase came to blows shortly before the show.[40] Chase's departure 
for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire 
Aykroyd if he took the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy Animal House, and 
later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The 
Blues Brothers (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 
to pursue film careers.[41][42] Michaels began to struggle to hold the 
remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent 
successes. Radner had a one-woman Broadway show and Murray starred in the 
1979 comedy Meatballs.[43] In 1980, when Michaels chose to leave the series 
to pursue other interests, he was followed by the remaining original cast, 
Curtin, Newman, and Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.[42] The 
Doumanian-era cast faced immediate comparison to the beloved former cast 
and were not received favorably.[18] Ebersol fired the majority of her 
hires, except for two unknown comedians: Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo.[44] 
Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with 
him for a role on the show, and after seeing him audition, Levy fought 
with Doumanian to cast him instead of Robert Townsend. Doumanian wanted 
only one black cast member and favored Townsend, but Levy convinced her 
to choose Murphy. Doumanian, however, also claimed credit for discovering 
Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show.[45] 
Even so, Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol 
took charge,[46] after which Murphy was credited with much of that era's 
success.[47][48] Murphy's star exploded, and he quickly appeared in films 
such as 48 Hrs. and Trading Places, before leaving for his film career 
in early 1984. Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the 1983–84 season 
and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own 
material, but at an inflated cost; Billy Crystal and Martin Short were 
paid $25,000 and $20,000 per episode respectively, a far cry from earlier 
salaries.[20] Michaels' return in 1985 saw a cast reset that featured established 
talent such as Robert Downey Jr., Jon Lovitz and Dennis Miller.[49] The 
season was poorly received, and another reset followed in 1986. Learning 
his lesson from the previous season, Michaels avoided known talent in favor 
of actual ability. He kept Lovitz, Miller and Nora Dunn, and brought in 
new, untested talent such as Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, and Jan Hooks, 
who together would define a new era on the show into the early 1990s.[50] 
The cast continued on for the next decade with the addition of new talent 
such as Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, and Chris Farley. Afraid of cast members 
leaving for film careers, Michaels had overcrowded the cast, causing a 
divide between the veteran members and the new, younger talent, increasing 
competition for limited screen time.[51] By 1995, Carvey and Hartman had 
left, taking with them a virtual army of characters, Myers quit for his 
movie career, and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler 
and Farley. The show saw its next major overhaul, bringing in a new cast 
including Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, and Jimmy Fallon.[52] While cast members 
would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest 
transition in 2013, with the addition of 6 cast members to compensate for 
the departure of several longtime cast members like Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, 
and Fred Armisen.[53] SNL has featured over 140 cast members including, 
besides the above-mentioned players, Rachel Dratch, Amy Poehler, Chris 
Rock, David Spade, Will Forte, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Chris 
Parnell, Maya Rudolph, Andy Samberg, Kristen Wiig, and many others. Darrell 
Hammond is the longest-serving cast member, having been a part of the cast 
for fourteen years between 1995 and 2009, and returned in 2014 as the show's 
announcer following the death of Don Pardo.[54][55] Those selected to join 
the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers, recruited 
from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Ferrell, Hartman,[56] 
Lovitz, Wiig[57]) and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,[58] Tim Meadows), 
or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, Norm Macdonald), 
who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL.[59] Of 
the many roles available in the show, one of the longest-running and most 
coveted is being the host of "Weekend Update", a segment which has alternated 
between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved 
to perform as themselves and be on camera for an extended period of time.[60] 
Many of the "Weekend Update" hosts have gone on to find greater success 
outside of the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray,[60] Miller, Macdonald,[61] 
Fey,[60] Fallon,[62] and Poehler. From 2008, Seth Meyers was the solo host 
of "Weekend Update",[60] before being partnered with Cecily Strong in 2013. 
After Meyers left for Late Night with Seth Meyers in February 2014, Strong 
was paired with head writer Colin Jost.[63] The cast is divided into two 
tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven 
cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted 
to the repertory stable. The cast were often contracted from anywhere between 
five and six years to the show,[65][66] but starting with the 1999–2000 
season, new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to 
take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC 
sitcom. Cast are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers 
but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated 
by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.[66] The move drew criticism 
from talent agents and managers who believed that a cast member could be 
locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on SNL and then six 
on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature 
films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, 
and Michaels. The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously 
unknown cast, such as Myers and Sandler, gained fame on SNL only to leave 
and make money for other studios.[66] In a 2010 interview, Wiig was reported 
to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years.[67] The contracts also 
contain a network option which allows NBC to remove a cast member at any 
time.[68] In the first season of the show, cast were paid $750 per episode, 
rising to $2,000 by season two, and $4,000 by season four.[69] By the late 
1990s, new cast members received a salary between $5,000[66] and $5,500 
per episode, increasing to $6,000 in the second year and up to $12,500 
for a cast member in their fifth year. Performers could earn an additional 
$1,500 per episode for writing a sketch which made it to air.[68] In 2001, 
Ferrell became the highest paid cast member, being paid $350,000 per season 
(approximately $17,500 per episode).[70] In 2014, Sasheer Zamata was added 
as a cast member in mid-season after criticism about the show's lack of 
an African-American woman.[71][72][73] As of the 2013–14 season, Colin 
Jost and Rob Klein are the show's co-head writers. Meyers had been co-head 
writer since 2005 and became the single head writer from 2008 to 2012. 
The "Weekend Update" segment has its own dedicated team of writers led 
by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the 2011–12 season.[74][75][76] 
Scenes on "Weekend Update" that involve members of the cast acting in-character 
alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside of the dedicated 
"Weekend Update" team, who know those characters better.[76] SNL writers 
are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational 
comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, 
Second City, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, and ImprovOlympic.[42] Comedian 
Jim Downey was head writer for nine years beginning in 1985.[77] Experienced 
writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought 
into the SNL writing room. Like the SNL cast that step before the cameras, 
many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the 
show such as Conan O'Brien, who was brought into SNL from The Groundlings, 
went on to writing for The Simpsons, and eventually began hosting his own 
show,[78] and former head writer Adam McKay who, along with performer Ferrell, 
founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die.[79] In 2000, Tina Fey 
became the first female SNL head writer[80][81] and successfully made the 
transition to starring on the show,[82] as well as writing and starring 
in feature films,[83][84][85] and ultimately creating and starring in her 
own show 30 Rock—partly based on her SNL experiences.[86] In 2005, Fey 
was being paid $1.5 million per season for her dual role as head writer 
and performer.[87] Don Pardo served as the announcer for the series when 
it first began,[88] and continued in the role for all but season seven 
between 1981 and 1982, when Michaels had left and Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan 
filled the announcing role. In 2004, Pardo announced that he would step 
down from his position, but then continued in the role until 2009 where 
he again announced his retirement, but then continued into the 2009–10 
season.[88] In 2010, then 92-year-old Pardo was reported to be again considering 
his retirement, but continued to serve as announcer until his death at 
age 96 on August 18, 2014, following the 39th season. Apart from a brief 
period in 2006 in which Pardo pre-recorded his announcements at his home 
in Arizona, he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live.[88][89] 
Cast members Joe Piscopo[90] and Darrell Hammond also periodically impersonated 
Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties when Pardo was unavailable.[91] 
Hammond took over as full-time announcer starting with season 40.[92] A 
typical episode of SNL will feature a single host chosen for their popularity, 
novelty, or because they have a film, album, or other work being released 
near the time of their appearance on the show.[93] The host delivers the 
opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. Traditionally 
the host of the show ends the opening monologue by introducing the musical 
guest for the night. Comedian George Carlin was the first to host SNL in 
the debut October 1975 episode;[94] three episodes later, Candice Bergen 
became the first female host[95] and subsequently the first to host more 
than once.[96] Hosts have been drawn from a wide spectrum of backgrounds, 
from actors, such as Christopher Walken, Buck Henry, and John Goodman,[97] 
to musicians like George Harrison[98] and Dolly Parton,[99] to political 
activist Ralph Nader.[93] Guests who have hosted five or more times are 
sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five-Timers Club, a term that 
originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks' fifth episode.[100] As of 
September 24, 2011, actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times 
hosting, having performed the duty on sixteen different occasions since 
1990; Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who had hosted fifteen 
times since 1976.[101] Each episode also features a musical guest, a solo 
act or a band, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, 
the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. As of May 
19, 2012, Dave Grohl is the most frequent musical guest, performing on 
eleven shows since 1992.[102] Michaels does not allow musical guests to 
perform using lip-synching tracks,[103] believing it diminishes the live 
aspect of the show. Exceptions are only made when the musical act is focused 
on intense dance routines instead of vocals, where it is difficult to be 
both heavily physically active and sing simultaneously.[104] A 1975 performance 
by pop group ABBA was the first and only act to feature lip-synching,[103] 
until the controversial 2004 performance of Ashlee Simpson. The 2004 Saturday 
Night Live episode that combined host Donald Trump with musical guest Toots 
and the Maytals[105] (the artist who introduced the term “reggae” in song[106]) 
became reference material for the 2015 SNL writers to create a sketch in 
which the real Donald Trump has Toots Hibbert (played by Kenan Thompson[107]) 
mention his interest in becoming Vice-President[108][109]. The Saturday 
Night Live Band (also known as "The Live Band") is the house band for SNL. 
Academy Award-winning composer Howard Shore served as the first musical 
director, from 1975 to 1980, appearing in many musical sketches, including 
Howard Shore and His All-Nurse Band and (backing a U.S. Coast Guard chorus) 
Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol. Over the years, the band has featured 
several New York studio musicians including Paul Shaffer (1975–1980), Lou 
Marini (1975–1983), David Sanborn (1975), Michael Brecker (early 1980s), 
Ray Chew (1980–1983), Alan Rubin (1975–1983), Georg Wadenius (1979–1985), 
Steve Ferrone (1985), David Johansen (performing as Buster Poindexter), 
Tom Malone (who took over as musical director from 1981 to 1985), and G.E. 
Smith (musical director from 1985 to 1995). The band is currently under 
the leadership of Tower of Power alumnus Lenny Pickett, keyboardist Leon 
Pendarvis and Eli Bruegemann, who does not play in the band on the live 
show. The number of musicians has varied over the years, but the basic 
instrumentation has been three saxophones (alto, tenor and baritone), one 
trombone, one trumpet, and a rhythm section featuring two keyboards (piano 
and Hammond organ), a guitar, bass guitar, drums, and an extra percussionist, 
not a permanent part of the band until Valerie Naranjo's arrival in 1995. 
The 1983–1984 and 1984–1985 seasons featured the smallest band, a six-piece 
combo. The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks; 
affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band 
play complete songs behind a Saturday Night Live bumper graphic until the 
program resumes.[110] Since the show's inception, SNL has aired from Studio 
8H, located on floors 8 and 9 of the Comcast Building (formerly the RCA 
Building and GE Building) (30 Rockefeller Plaza, or "30 Rock"). The studio 
had originally been used as a radio soundstage for Arturo Toscanini and 
the NBC Symphony Orchestra.[111] Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally 
inspected Studio 8H in 1975, and found it technically limited, outdated, 
in need of repair,[112] and lacking the capacity to host a live show.[111] 
Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the 
acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts,[111] at a cost of approximately 
$300,000.[111] Three of the first four shows of the 1976–77 season were 
shot at the former NBC Studios in Brooklyn, due to NBC News using Studio 
8H for Presidential election coverage.[113] During the summer 2005 shooting 
hiatus, crews began renovations on Studio 8H. With its thirty-first season 
premiere in October 2005, the show began broadcasting in high-definition 
television, appearing letterboxed on conventional television screens. The 
offices of SNL writers, producers, and other staff can be found on the 
17th floor of "30 Rock".[114] Production on an SNL episode will normally 
start on a Monday with a free-form pitch meeting[115][116][117] between 
the cast, writers, producers including Michaels, and the guest host, in 
Michaels' office, over two hours. The host is invited to pitch ideas during 
this meeting. Although some sketch writing may occur on the day, the bulk 
of the work revolves around pitching ideas. Tuesday is the only day dedicated 
purely to writing the scripts,[116] a process which usually extends through 
the night into the following morning. Writing may not begin until 8pm on 
the Tuesday evening.[115][117] At 5pm on Wednesday, the sketches are read 
during a round-table meeting in the writers room,[117] attended by the 
writers and producers present during the pitch meeting, technical experts 
such as make-up artists, who may be required to realize certain sketch 
ideas such as those using prosthetics, and other producers, resulting in 
an attendance of approximately fifty people.[118] At this point there may 
be at least 40 sketch ideas which are read-through in turn, lasting upwards 
of three hours.[118] After completion of the read-through, Michaels, the 
head writer, the guest host, and some of the show producers will move to 
Michaels' office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the 
sketches will be developed for air. Once complete, the writers and cast 
are allowed into Michaels' office to view the show breakdown and learn 
whether or not their sketch has survived.[119] Sketches may be rewritten 
starting the same day,[116] but will certainly commence on Thursday, work 
focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches,[115] and possibly 
rehearsals.[117] If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday, it is 
rehearsed on Friday or Saturday[116] before moving to a rehearsal before 
a live audience at 8pm, again on Saturday before the live show.[115][117] 
After the rehearsal, Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it 
meets a 90-minute length, and sketches that have made it as far as the 
live rehearsal may be removed.[120] This often results in less than two 
days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to 
the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast.[115] The opening 
monologue, spoken by the guest host, is given low priority and can be written 
as late as Saturday afternoon.[121] According to an interview with Fey 
in 2004, the three- to four-member dedicated "Weekend Update" writing team 
will write jokes throughout the week. The host(s) of "Weekend Update" will 
normally not work with, or read the scripts from, the team until Thursday 
evening, after the main show sketches have been finalized. The host(s) 
will then work on contributing to the script where necessary.[122][123] 
With onsite facilities housed on floors 8 and 17 of Rockefeller Plaza, 
post-production duties on live broadcasts of Saturday Night Live include 
the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer, coupled 
with additional audio feeds consisting of music, sound effects, music scoring 
and pre-recorded voiceovers. All sources are stored digitally, with shows 
captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganise for future 
repeats and syndication. The production tracking system was migrated from 
primarily analog to digital in 1998, with live shows typically requiring 
1.5 terabytes of storage, consisting of audio elements and 5 cameras' worth 
of visual elements.[124] Elements of Saturday Night Live that are pre-recorded, 
such as certain commercial parodies, SNL Digital Shorts, and show graphics 
are processed off-site in the post-production facilities of Broadway Video.[125][126] 
Studio 8H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services. 
Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two 
Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras, both using Vinten pedestals. A GVG 4000-3 
digital component production switcher, and GVG 7000 digital component routing 
switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple 
digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are 
provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro character generator and an Avid Deko character 
generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled 
analogue mixing console, and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape 
playback support and utility audio work.[127] While exact budgets for other 
seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013-2014) had a budget of just 
over $70 million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State in 
the amount of $12.3 million.[128] As of 2009, the opening title sequence 
and opening montage is shot using the Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 
7D digital SLR cameras. Typical elements are recorded at 30 fps, with slow-motion 
sequences shot at 60 fps, both in full 1080p high definition.[129] Edie 
Baskin was the original SNL photographer. She was hired after Michaels 
saw her photographs of Las Vegas and other work. Baskin helped create the 
opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at 
night.[130] The first episode used publicity photos of Carlin as transitional 
bumpers between the show and commercial breaks, the second episode used 
photos Baskin had already taken of host Paul Simon. It was then that Michaels 
suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using 
publicity photos, beginning a tradition which continues today.[131] Since 
1999, Mary Ellen Matthews has been the official photographer of SNL, responsible 
for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery 
used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical 
guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited 
time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and 
the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site 
at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the 
musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean 
the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday.[132] Matthews employs 
flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style. 
On the lighting, Matthews commented: "I think it just helps the image pop 
off the screen...If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional...The 
[classic Hollywood lighting] gives a little more contrast, and if I use 
edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther 
back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can."[133] Matthews is also 
responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting 
rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved 
in directing videos, including the show title sequence.[133] The show usually 
begins at 11:29:30 p.m. (Eastern Time),[134] unless a delay occurs (more 
commonly, due to sporting events that run past 11:00 p.m. Eastern, delaying 
local newscasts that lead into that week's SNL broadcast on most NBC stations). 
The show broadcasts for 92 minutes (counting commercial breaks), ending 
at 1:02 a.m. For the Mountain except for KSNG, KSNK, and KQCD, and Pacific 
time zones, NBC airs the prerecorded live show usually unedited, mistakes 
notwithstanding Since the first opening in 1975 with Michael O'Donoghue, 
Chevy Chase, and John Belushi, the show has normally begun with a cold 
open sketch which ends with one or more cast members breaking character 
and proclaiming "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!", segueing into 
the opening credits that start immediately after.[3] In February 2013, 
NBC began airing shortened hour-long repeats on Saturday evenings at 10:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time during the regular season; the episodes scheduled are sometimes 
rebroadcasts of the previous week's episode if it originally aired as a 
first-run broadcast.[135] During the 2014–15 season, however, the prime 
time rebroadcasts consisted of a selection of 40 episodes from throughout 
the show's run under the title SNL Vintage to commemorate the program's 
40th anniversary. NBC and Broadway Video both hold the underlying rights 
to the show, while the copyright to every episode lies solely with NBC. 
From 1990 until 2004, and again since 2015, Comedy Central and its predecessor 
Ha! re-aired reruns of the series, after which E! Entertainment Television 
signed a deal to carry reruns.[136] Abbreviated 30- and 60-minute versions 
of the first five seasons aired as The Best of Saturday Night Live in syndication 
beginning in the 1980s, and later on Nick at Nite in 1988. In September 
2010, reruns of most episodes made from 1998 onward began airing on VH1.[137] 
Starting in February 2016, VH1 and Comedy Central's sister channel Logo 
began airing reruns of the show on Sunday nights, launching its broadcast 
as counterprogramming for Super Bowl 50 and branding it the "Live From 
New York, It's Satur-Gay Night!" marathon. The reruns are mostly from 2006 
onward. Because SNL has been a huge success in America, other countries 
have created their own versions of the show, including MENA (Middle East 
and North Africa region), Germany, Spain, South Korea, Japan, Canada, and 
Finland.[138][139] SNL is also aired in the Middle East and North Africa, 
OSN First HD every Saturday night, one week after it airs in the U.S.[140] 
In India and Sri Lanka, Saturday Night Live! airs on Comedy Central, in 
an hour long version, one week after the U.S broadcast.[141] Spain's version 
of the show was short-lived, only lasting a few episodes which aired on 
Thursdays and not Saturdays as the title suggested. This version copied 
heavily from the American version, in that they did their own versions 
of sketches that were already done on the original series.[138] Italy's 
Saturday Night Live From Milan aired for four seasons and used original 
material.[138][142] On December 3, 2011, South Korea's SNL Korea premiered 
on cable channel tvN.[143][144][145][146] As of July 20, 2013, it is in 
its fourth consecutive season, with 20 episodes.[147] The Japanese version 
Saturday Night Live JPN, which ran for six months in 2011, was created 
in part with Lorne Michaels' production company, Coca-Cola, Broadway Video 
and broadcast on Fuji TV networks. The show followed the same format with 
a few minor differences, being only 45 minutes long and hosted by a permanent 
host. The cast was made up of seasoned comedians who take center stage 
and newcomers who play the background roles. It was broadcast once a month, 
and ended after six episodes, as planned from the start.[138][142][148][149][150][excessive 
citations] In 2014, two 90-minute specials were broadcast in French on 
Télé-Québec in the Canadian province of Quebec under the title SNL Québec; 
the specials were broadcast on February 8 and March 22, 2014. hosted by 
Louis-José Houde and Stéphane Rousseau, and is the same format and length 
as the original SNL series.[151] Certain sketches from the original program, 
such as Debbie Downer and Schweddy Balls, were adapted into French, while 
other sketches were original material written directly for the Quebec series. 
On May 13, 2014, SNL Quebec was renewed for another eight episodes to be 
broadcast monthly over the 2014–15 season ending with a "Best of" compilation.[152] 
Télé-Québec announced in May 2015 that the series would not be renewed 
due to funding cutbacks,[153] and Télévision de Radio-Canada subsequently 
signed the show's production team and cast to produce a new series, Le 
nouveau show, for that network.[154] The episode scheduled for October 
25, 1986, hosted by Rosanna Arquette, was not aired until November 8 due 
to NBC broadcasting Game 6 of the 1986 World Series between the New York 
Mets and Boston Red Sox; the game entered extra innings, causing that night's 
broadcast of SNL to be canceled. The show was recorded for the studio audience 
starting at 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time, and broadcast two weeks later with 
an "apology" by Mets pitcher Ron Darling.[citation needed] The episode 
scheduled for February 10, 2001, hosted by Jennifer Lopez, aired 45 minutes 
late due to an XFL game. Lopez and the cast were not told they were airing 
on a delay. Michaels was so upset by the delay that the episode was rerun 
a mere three weeks later, and the fledgling league actually changed the 
rules in order to speed up play, and a deal was reached where the feed 
to future games would be cut off (whether the game had been decided or 
not) when SNL started so that no such incident would happen again.[155] 
In 2002, the show was ranked tenth on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of 
All Time,[156] while in 2007 it was honored with inclusion on Time magazine's 
list of "100 Best TV Shows of All-TIME."[134][157] In June 2013, the show 
was placed at number 25 on the list of the 101 best written shows of all 
time by the Writers Guild of America, assessing series from the previous 
70 years.[158] In December 2013, TV Guide ranked it #18 on their list of 
the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.[159] It is currently the 40th longest 
running TV show in the US. Saturday Night Live has won numerous awards 
since its debut, including 45 Primetime Emmy Awards,[160] 2 Peabody Awards,[161] 
and 4 Writers Guild of America Awards.[162] In 2009, it received a total 
of 13 Emmy nominations for a lifetime total of 126, breaking the record 
for the most award nominated show in Emmy history, previously set with 
124 by hospital drama ER.[163][164] As of August 2012, it had received 
a record total of 156 Emmy nominations.[134][165] 19 cast members have 
received individual Emmy nominations in the show's history. These nominations 
were mostly in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music 
Program before that award was discontinued; since then, nominations have 
been in the Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress categories for comedy 
series. Of the 36 total nominations for these 19 performers, four have 
won Emmys: Chevy Chase (1976), Gilda Radner (1978), Dana Carvey (1993), 
and Kate McKinnon (2016).[160] SNL has also had an effect on U.S. elections 
– most commonly presidential elections. Voters have reported that political 
sketches that were shown on the program influenced them in the voting booth. 
The so-called SNL Effect was observed during the 2008 presidential campaign, 
according to Mike Dabadie. Two-thirds of voters who responded to a poll 
said they had seen a broadcast of politically charged content on SNL, with 
ten percent saying that it had made a difference in their decision. Barack 
Obama was the beneficiary of the political content, with 59 percent saying 
they did in fact cast a vote for the Democratic then-nominee.[166] Chevy 
Chase's bumbling impression of then-president Gerald Ford during the 1976 
presidential election was cited as an influence on the election, and a 
quote commonly attributed to 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 
stating "I can see Russia from my house" was actually spoken by SNL cast 
member Tina Fey while portraying Palin.[167] Several politicians have appeared 
on SNL, including President Gerald Ford (in 1976, during the show's first 
season), Senator (at the time) Barack Obama (2007), Senator John McCain 
(2002 & 2008), Senator Hillary Clinton (2008 & 2015), and Governor Sarah 
Palin (2008), who appeared alongside Fey's Palin impression, resulting 
in the show's largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers.[168][169] 
Senator Obama's appearance occurred in part because Hillary Clinton abandoned 
her scheduled appearance.[169] The political content was abandoned briefly 
following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York, with Poehler 
saying that the writers did not want to produce politicized material; highly 
political content would be absent for the next 4 years.[169] Due to the 
show's live factor, a number of technical problems, performer mishaps, 
intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to dead 
air have occurred throughout the show's run. One incident that garnered 
widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992 appearance by singer 
Sinéad O'Connor, in which she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during 
her performance.[170][171] On April 13, 1996, the alternative metal band 
Rage Against the Machine made a statement about the host, billionaire Steve 
Forbes, by hanging two upside-down American flags from their amplifiers. 
On October 23, 2004 Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest and there 
was a lip synching mishap. Her first performance, "Pieces of Me", was performed 
without incident, but when she began her second song, "Autobiography", 
the vocals for "Pieces of Me" were heard again through the speakers, even 
before she had raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to do 
an impromptu jig, and then left the stage.[172] Currently, Universal Studios 
Home Entertainment and Lions Gate Entertainment hold video rights to the 
series. Universal has issued complete season DVD sets of the first few 
seasons, while Lionsgate's share of the rights are a result of prior contracts 
with NBC struck before the NBC Universal merger. A majority of Lionsgate's 
SNL DVDs are "Best Of..." compilations. Saturday Night Live (ISBN 0-380-01801-2), 
the first authorized book about the series, was published by Avon Books 
in 1977 and edited by Anne Beatts and John Head, with photography by Edie 
Baskin;[173] all three worked for SNL at the time the book was published. 
The oversized illustrated paperback included the scripts for several sketches 
by the 1975–1980 cast.[174] In 1986, Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad authored 
Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live (ISBN 0-688-05099-9), 
a behind-the-scenes look at the first ten seasons. Saturday Night Live: 
The First Twenty Years (ISBN 0-395-75284-1), by Michael Cader, was released 
in 1994, and presented information about the cast, characters, and other 
memorable moments seen on the show from 1975 to 1994.[175] Live From New 
York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, 
Writers and Guests (ISBN 0-316-73565-5) was released in 2002. The book, 
written by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller, consists of interviews from 
people who have worked on the show. The interviews reveal personal experiences 
from what happened backstage and the difficulty of getting the show on 
air each week.[176] In 2004, former cast member Jay Mohr released his memoir 
Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live (ISBN 
1-401-30801-5), about his struggles during his two seasons on the show 
between 1993 and 1995, dealing with getting sketches on air and the intense 
work schedule. Cast member Bobby Moynihan described the book as "a handbook 
on what NOT to do at SNL."[177] SNL has made several efforts to develop 
some of the more popular sketches into feature-length films, with varying 
degrees of commercial and critical success. The first foray into film came 
with the successful Aykroyd and Belushi vehicle, The Blues Brothers (1980), 
which earned over $115 million on a $27 million budget.[178] In 1990, Michaels 
oversaw the writing of a sketch anthology feature film titled The Saturday 
Night Live Movie with many of the show's then-current writing staff, including 
Al Franken, Tom Davis, Greg Daniels, Jim Downey, Conan O'Brien, Robert 
Smigel, and George Meyer, contributing. The screenplay only got as far 
as a Revised First Draft dated July 26, 1990 before being abandoned.[179] 
However, it was the success of Wayne's World (1992) that encouraged Michaels 
to produce more film spin-offs, based on several popular sketch characters. 
Michaels revived 1970s characters for Coneheads (1993), followed by It's 
Pat (1994); Stuart Saves His Family (1995); A Night at the Roxbury (1998); 
Superstar (1999) and The Ladies Man (2000). Some did moderately well, though 
others did not—notably, It's Pat, which did so badly at the box office 
that the studio that made the film, Touchstone Pictures (owned by The Walt 
Disney Company, which also owns NBC's rival ABC), pulled it only one week 
after releasing it,[180] and Stuart Saves His Family, which lost $14 million. 
Many of these films were produced by Paramount Pictures. The films based 
on The Blues Brothers were produced by Universal Studios, which merged 
with NBC in 2004 to form NBC Universal (Universal also has a joint venture 
with Paramount for international distribution of the two studios' films). 
The character Bob Roberts from the Tim Robbins film of the same name (1992), 
first appeared on SNL in a short film about the conservative folk singer. 
In addition, the 1999 comedy film Office Space originated from a series 
of animated short films by Mike Judge that aired on SNL in 1993.[181] The 
fictitious American folk music trio The Folksmen first appeared on SNL, 
performing the song "Old Joe's Place" before later appearing in the film 
A Mighty Wind (2002). The three members of the Folksmen were the same three 
comedians: Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest, who also 
appeared on the same episode as the rock group Spinal Tap. At the time 
of the appearance (the 1984–85 season), Shearer and Guest were cast members. 
Mr. Bill's Real Life Adventures is based off the Mr. Bill sketches from 
early seasons of SNL.[182][183] In 2005, the comedy troupe The Lonely Island, 
consisting of SNL members Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, 
gained national exposure after joining the show and debuting their comedic 
music video "Lazy Sunday", written with fellow cast member Chris Parnell. 
The song became a surprise hit,[184] and convinced Michaels to encourage 
the troupe to develop more comedy songs. Further successes with songs including 
"Like A Boss, "Jizz in My Pants", "I'm on a Boat", "We Like Sportz", "Boombox", 
and "Dick in a Box"—which won an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and 
Lyrics in 2007[185]—saw The Lonely Island go on to release two albums, 
Incredibad (2009)[186] and Turtleneck & Chain (2011), containing SNL-developed 
songs and original works. The albums were released by Universal Republic 
Records who were provided with a license to the SNL songs by NBC and Broadway 
Video. A cast album was released in 1976 on the Arista label including 
the song "Chevy's Girls" and comedy bits from the show ("Weekend Update", 
"Emily Litella", "Gun Control"); it was later re-issued on CD and MP3 download. 
Several programs have documented the behind-the-scenes events of the show. 
A 60 Minutes report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing 
frenzy that goes on during the week leading up to a show, with crowded 
meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted the involvement 
of the guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which 
they will appear. Similarly, there has been an A&E episode of Biography 
which covered the production process, as well as an episode of TV Tales 
in 2002 on E!. In 2010, Saturday Night, a 94-minute documentary by actor 
James Franco in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production 
process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by John Malkovich, from 
the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated 
as a five-minute short film for Franco's New York University film class, 
Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to 
be expanded.[117] On February 15, 2015, NBC aired a 3 1/2 hour special 
on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of 
clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members 
and special guest appearances from previous hosts.[187] In September 2011, 
ice cream company Ben & Jerry's released a limited-edition ice cream called 
"Schweddy Balls", inspired by a 1998 sketch of the same name starring Alec 
Baldwin, Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon.[188] The ice cream became the 
fastest-selling Ben & Jerry's limited-edition flavor. The ice cream was 
also subject to criticism and boycotts by the One Million Moms organization 
over the "vulgar"[189] name. Some retail chains chose not to sell the flavor, 
but declined to say if the decision was at their own discretion or based 
on the One Million Moms boycotts.[189][190] In June 2014, two new flavours 
inspired by SNL sketches were introduced—Lazy Sunday, based on a sketch 
of the same name featuring Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell, and Gilly's 
Catastrophic Crunch based on the recurring Gilly sketches featuring Kristen 
Wiig.[191] Two Wild and Crazy Pies, based on the catchphrase of the recurring 
Festrunk Brothers, was introduced in September 2014,[192] followed by Wayne'Swirled
