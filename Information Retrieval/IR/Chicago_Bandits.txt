Benedictine University (Lisle, IL) 2005-2007 The Chicago Bandits are a 
women's professional softball team based in Rosemont, Illinois. Since the 
2005 season, they have played as a member of National Pro Fastpitch (NPF). 
The Bandits won the 2008 NPF championship, defeating the Washington Glory 
in the final game of the championship series. The team won their second 
NPF championship following the 2011 season when they won the championship 
series two games to none over the USSSA Pride. Following the 2015 season 
the team won its third NPF championship defeating the USSSA Pride two games 
to none. They play their home games at Rosemont Stadium in Rosemont, Illinois. 
2005 The Chicago Bandits inaugural season took place at Benedictine University 
in Lisle, IL. Chicago recorded an NPF-best 41-7 record, but lost to the 
Akron Racers in the championship. 2006 Chicago posted a 30-12 record, which 
again was best in the NPF, but lost to the Connecticut Brakettes in the 
championship series. 2007 The 2007 Chicago Bandits went 23-21, but failed 
to qualify for the playoffs after finishing in sixth place in the league. 
2008 The Bandits began their first season in Elgin with a 4-7 record, playing 
without Jennie Finch and Vicky Galindo of the United States National Team, 
and Caitlin Lever of the Canadian National Team, due to the 2008 Beijing 
Olympics. Jessica Sallinger and Kristina Thorson each won 12 games and 
were Chicago's first duo to record double-digit victories since Jennie 
Finch and Amy Harre in 2005. After moving to their new stadium, the Bandits 
recorded 61 home runs in 2008, which was more home runs than in the franchise's 
first three years combined. The team's home run leaders were Stacy May 
(13), Rachel Folden (11), and Jamie Clark (11). The Bandits completed their 
season sweeping the Akron Racers, New England Riptide and Rockford Thunder 
to finish the regular season 32-16 and on a 12-game winning streak, earning 
the highest seed in the 2008 Championship Series. In the Championship Series, 
Chicago won all three games and earned the franchise's first NPF Championship 
with a victory over the Washington Glory in the title game. 2009 The Chicago 
Bandits began their second season at Judson University in Elgin, IL with 
the return of Olympians Jennie Finch, Vicky Galindo, and Caitlin Lever. 
Chicago finished the regular season with a 27-12 record, ranking first 
in the National Pro Fastpitch standings and earning the top seed for the 
playoffs in Akron, Ohio. Despite having the best record in the NPF in 2009, 
Chicago was upset in the NPF playoffs by the USSSA Pride two games to one, 
and lost the opportunity to repeat as league champions. 2010 In 2010, the 
Bandits once again won the regular season title, but once again, the USSSA 
Pride ended the Bandits championship hopes, winning their first Cowles 
Cup title. After the season, standouts Stacy May-Johnson and Jennie Finch 
announced their retirements from professional softball. 2011 The Bandits 
moved into their brand new home stadium, Ballpark at Rosemont, in Rosemont, 
Illinois in time for the beginning of the 2011 season.[1] The team officially 
opened the stadium for NPF play on June 16, 2011 with a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony prior to the Bandits 1-0 walk-off win over the USSSA Pride. Caitlin 
Lever drove in the winning run in the bottom of the 7th. Unlike the previous 
three years, the Bandits did not win the regular season title. They finished 
third in the four-team NPF with a 20-20 record, after losing six of their 
final eight games at home to close out the regular season. The Bandits 
opened the playoffs in Sulphur, LA against the second-seeded Akron Racers 
and swept the Racers with two straight victories, capped off by a three-run 
walk-off home run in extra innings by Nikki Nemitz to advance to the finals. 
In the finals, they once again met the Pride. In the first game, the Pride 
took an early 2-0 lead, but rookie Megan Wiggins hit a three-run double 
off Pride starter Cat Osterman. Two pitches later, Osterman went down with 
an arm injury, but the Pride came back to tie the game at 3 in the bottom 
of the 7th. In the 8th, Bandits right-fielder Amber Patton drove in the 
go-ahead run and NPF Co-Pitcher of the Year Monica Abbott made it stand 
up for a one-game lead in the best-of-three series. The next afternoon, 
Chicago got on the board early and often, scoring five times in the bottom 
of the first. The Pride got two back, but that was as close as they would 
get the rest of the day, as the Bandits cruised to their second Cowles 
Cup championship with a 10-3 victory. They became the first NPF team to 
win multiple Cowles Cup championships. 2012 2013 2014 2015 Before the season,

in franchise history, defeating the USSSA Pride 2-1 in a winner-take-all 
game three of the Championship Series finals. The Bandits have retired
