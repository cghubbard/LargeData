Gerald William "Jerry" Meals (born October 20, 1961) is a Major League 
Baseball umpire. Meals biggest assignment was the 2014 World Series, where 
he was the home plate umpire in Game One. Meals has been a full-time MLB 
umpire since 1998 after serving as an MLB reserve umpire from 1992 to 1997. 
He worked in the 2008 NLCS between Philadelphia and Los Angeles and the 
All-Star Game in 2002 and 2015. He has also worked in seven Division Series 
(1999, 2004, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014)[1] and the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic. Meals was a 1979 graduate of Salem High School, where he played 
second base and briefly competed on the wrestling team. After umpiring 
local baseball for four years, Meals graduated from the Joe Brinkman Umpire 
School in 1983. At age 21, Meals received his first minor league umpiring 
assignment in the Class A Appalachian League.[2] By 1985, Meals had moved 
to the South Atlantic League, where he was partnered with 20-year-old future 
MLB umpire Wally Bell.[3] While working in the Southern League in 1989, 
Meals was featured in an ESPN documentary on minor league umpires. His 
family and fellow umpires Chris Jaksa and Fieldin Culbreth also appeared 
in the film.[4] Meals worked in Triple-A baseball (Triple-A Alliance and 
the International League) from 1990 to 1997 before receiving a full-time 
promotion to the major leagues.[1] Meals spent the 2014 season as an interim 
crew chief while regular crew chief Gary Darling was on the Disabled List. 
Meals was officially promoted to permanent crew chief upon Darling's retirement.[5] 
In his first full-time MLB season, Meals was the home plate umpire when 
Kerry Wood tied a major league record with 20 strikeouts in a 1998 game.[1] 
Meals was struck in the mask by a Wood fastball on his first pitch of the 
game, but the umpire was not injured.[6] On May 7, 2011, Meals worked behind 
the plate for Justin Verlander's second career no-hitter. The umpire's 
ball four call on J.P. Arencibia in the eighth inning prevented Verlander 
from achieving a perfect game. However, Verlander later said that he agreed 
with the call.[7] Meals and Major League Baseball both acknowledged that 
he missed a call in the 19th inning of a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates 
and the Atlanta Braves on July 26, 2011.[8] With respect to length of time, 
the game was the longest in Pirates history.[9][10] During the play in 
question, a ground ball, Pirates catcher Michael McKenry received a throw 
and appeared to tag Braves runner Julio Lugo three feet in front of home 
plate but Meals called him safe and the Braves won the game. Meals received 
criticism for the call[11] and the Pirates issued a public complaint.[12] 
MLB executive vice president for baseball operations Joe Torre responded 
to the complaint and officially acknowledged that Meals's call was in error[13] 
Following the incident, Meals and his family received death threats at 
their home.[14] Meals' wife reported that their children, who ranged between 
14 and 23 at the time of the incident, were also "approached" by irate 
and confrontational fans, as Pittsburgh is only 70 miles away from the 
Meals' hometown of Salem, Ohio.[10] On Saturday, September 8, 2012, Meals 
incorrectly ruled Mark Teixeira of the New York Yankees out on a game-ending 
double play at first base against the Baltimore Orioles. If Meals had made 
the correct call, the game would have been tied, but instead the Orioles 
won and moved up a game to be even with the Yankees for first in the AL 
East.[15] On Monday, July 29, 2013, Meals incorrectly ruled Daniel Nava 
of the Boston Red Sox out at home plate in the 8th inning against the Tampa 
Bay Rays which would have tied the game. Instead, the Rays held on to win 
2-1. Red Sox manager John Farrell was ejected for arguing the call, which 
Meals later admitted was incorrect.[16] On April 22, 2014, Meals was the 
home plate umpire when Albert Pujols of the Los Angeles Angels hit his 
500th career home run against the Washington Nationals. Meals lives in 
Perry Township, just outside Salem in Columbiana County, Ohio. He is married 
to Robyn Meals and has five children.[17] At 5'8" tall, Meals and Mark
