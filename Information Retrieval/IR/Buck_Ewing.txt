As Player As Manager William "Buck" Ewing (October 17, 1859 – October 20, 
1906) was an American Major League Baseball player and manager, and is 
widely regarded as the best catcher of his era and is often argued as one 
of the best players of the 19th century. Born in Hoagland, Ohio, Ewing 
joined the National League in 1880 as a member of the Troy Trojans, but 
rose to stardom in 1883 as a member of the New York Gothams, later known 
as the Giants. That year he would hit 10 home runs (a feat he would never 
repeat), while batting .303. Playing in an era when triples were more common 
than home runs due to the spacious parks and poor quality of the balls 
used, he led the league in 1884 with 20 triples, and was often among the 
league leaders. Ewing was equally renowned for his defensive abilities. 
Writing in the 1938 Spalding Guide, John Foster said of him, "As a thrower 
to bases Ewing never had a superior, and there are not to exceed ten men 
who could come anywhere near being equal to him. Ewing was the man of whom 
it was said, "He handed the ball to the second baseman from the batter's 
box." Primarily a catcher, Ewing was versatile enough to play all nine 
positions and fast enough to steal 354 bases. He hit .300 in ten different 
seasons. Playing until 1897 with the Giants, Cleveland Spiders and Cincinnati 
Reds, Ewing posted consistently superb offensive numbers. Arguably his 
best season was in 1893 with the Spiders when he batted .344 with 6 home 
runs, 122 RBI, 47 stolen bases and 117 runs. In 1890, when a player revolt 
led to the formation of the short-lived Players' League, Ewing led the 
New York franchise as both star player and manager. Lingering resentment 
in the wake of the league's establishment and demise has often been suspected 
as a reason for his limited play in 1891 and subsequent move to Cleveland 
following the 1892 season. Ewing finished his career with a .303 lifetime 
batting average, 71 home runs, 883 RBI, 1129 runs, 250 doubles and 178 
triples – totals made more impressive by the fact he was playing annual 
seasons only 100-130 games long. In addition to playing, Ewing managed 
for seven seasons: the 1890 (Players' League) Giants, the 1895–1899 Cincinnati 
Reds and the first half of the season with the 1900 Giants. He compiled 
a 489-395 record for a .553 winning percentage. Ewing also as used as an 
American Association umpire for two games on June 28 and July 4, 1882.[1] 
Ewing died of diabetes in Cincinnati. In the first elections to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame, he and Cap Anson led all 19th century players. Three years 
later, in 1939, they were among the first 19th century players elected 
and Ewing became the first member who was primarily a catcher. He was named 
one of the top five players from the 19th century in a 1999 poll by the
