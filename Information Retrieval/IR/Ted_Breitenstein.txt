Theodore P. "Ted" "Breit" Breitenstein (June 1, 1869 – May 3, 1935) was 
an American Major League Baseball player from St. Louis, Missouri who pitched 
from 1891 to 1901 for the St. Louis Browns/Cardinals and the Cincinnati 
Reds.[1] He is most known today for throwing a no-hitter in his first Major 
League start.[2] During his first season in the Majors, he was able to 
pitch occasionally in relief, but on the final day of the 1891 season, 
October 4, Breitenstein was allowed to start and he pitched a no-hitter 
against the Louisville Colonels, an 8–0 victory. He faced the minimum number 
of batters of 27, allowed just one base on balls, which was erased by a 
double play or by a pickoff play.[2] It was also the last no-hitter thrown 
in the American Association, as the league folded following the season.[2] 
He became part of the pitching rotation in 1892, but had a lackluster season 
with a 9–19 win–loss record and a 4.69 earned run average. He turned his 
pitching around after that, and in 1893, Breitenstein's 3.18 ERA was tops 
in the National League.[1] In 1894, he won 27 games while leading the league 
in games started, complete games and innings pitched, although he led the 
league in runs allowed, and had a 4.79 ERA. In the following season, his 
workload stayed the same, leading the league in games started and complete 
games once again, but his stats took a slide downward, leading the league 
in runs allowed, base on balls, and losses.[1] His 30 losses in 1895 stand 
as the 3rd on the all-time list for losses in a season by a pitcher.[2] 
After a similar season in 1896, he was sold to the Cincinnati Reds for 
a reported $10,000, though it could have been as low as $4,000. This move 
gave Breitenstein a new start and he took advantage of it, winning more 
than 20 games in each of his first two season with the Reds. He lowered 
his ERA to 3.62 in 1897 and 3.42 in 1898 respectively.[1] On April 22, 
1898, he pitched his second no-hitter, this time against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, an 11–0 victory. What made this no-hitter notable is the fact 
that another no-hitter was pitched on the same day. Jay Hughes of the Baltimore 
Orioles threw one against the Boston Beaneaters. This was the first occurrence 
of two no-hitters had been thrown on the same day in the Major Leagues.[2] 
His next two seasons in Cincinnati were respectable, but his skills had 
shown that they were declining, not able to pitch with the same durability 
of seasons past, so through an unknown transaction, he returned to his 
old team in St. Louis, now known as the Cardinals.[1] His career ended 
after only a few games in 1901 and he went on to a lengthy minor league 
baseball career, most notably with the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern 
Association. He played eight seasons for the Pelicans, ten years in all 
with the Association.[3] He was then an umpire in the Association. During 
World War I, Breitenstein was named as a director of an athletic camp especially 
organized for Army and Navy soldiers.[4] He died in St. Louis, Missouri 
at the age of 65, and is interred in Saint Peter's Cemetery in Normandy,
