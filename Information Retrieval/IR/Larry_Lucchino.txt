Lawrence "Larry" Lucchino (born September 6, 1945) is the former president 
and CEO of the Boston Red Sox, and member of John W. Henry's ownership 
group.[1] A Pittsburgh native and basketball player,[2] Lucchino graduated 
from Princeton University in 1967 and later attended Yale Law School, where 
he was a classmate of Hillary Clinton.[3][4] After law school, Lucchino 
practiced law with the Washington, D. C., law firm of Williams & Connolly. 
The founder, famed litigator Edward Bennett Williams, had ownership interest 
in both the Washington Redskins and the Baltimore Orioles.[3] Lucchino's 
law practice at Williams & Connolly included a substantial amount of work 
for those two sports teams. Through that work he ultimately became President/CEO 
of the Baltimore Orioles and later, the San Diego Padres, before joining 
the Red Sox in November, 2001.[5] Lucchino is known for having initiated 
the trend of building baseball-only facilities with an old-fashioned charm 
and smaller seating capacities. Under his watch, both teams built new stadiums, 
pioneering Oriole Park at Camden Yards[3] and Petco Park. Since then, about 
one-half of Major League Baseball’s 30 teams followed this lead and built 
new stadiums with the old-style look and feel. As part of the management 
team which signed David Ortiz to the Red Sox, Lucchino "always enjoyed 
a strong connection with Big Papi throughout his entire career" and including 
at the time of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings.[6] Lucchino also brought 
Theo Epstein with him to the Red Sox from the Orioles and the Padres,[7] 
having also encouraged Epstein to get his law degree while he was working 
at the Padres.[8] On August 1, 2015, the team announced that Lucchino was 
stepping down after the 2015 season.[5] He retired on October 5, 2015. 
Lucchino continues as chairman and co-owner of the Pawtucket, RI, Pawtucket 
Red Sox.[6] Lucchino serves on the Board of Directors for Special Olympics.[9] 
He was named as the Commencement speaker for Boston University's 2008 graduating 
class,[10] guest speaker at New England School of Law's 2008 graduation 
ceremony, Bryant University's Class of 2009, and the Anna Maria College 
Class of 2010. Lucchino is the only man known to have World Series rings 
(Orioles ’83, Red Sox ’04, ’07, and '13),[3] a Super Bowl ring (Redskins 
’82) and a Final Four watch (Princeton, ’65).[3] He is a Non-Hodgkin's
