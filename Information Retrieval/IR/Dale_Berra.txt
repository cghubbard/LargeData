Dale Anthony Berra (born December 13, 1956) is an American former Major 
League Baseball player who primarily played as an infielder from 1977 to 
1987. He is the son of Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra and brother of former 
Baltimore Colts return specialist Tim Berra. Dale was named after Dale 
Mitchell, who had made the final out in Don Larsen's perfect game two months 
earlier, taking a called strike three which was caught by Yogi.[2] Berra 
was a highly sought prospect upon his graduation from Montclair High School 
in Montclair, New Jersey.[citation needed] He was drafted by the Pittsburgh 
Pirates with the twentieth overall pick in the 1975 Major League Baseball 
draft, and made his major league debut on August 22, 1977 at the age of 
twenty.[3] Berra was a member of the 1979 World Series champion Pirates, 
though he did not receive an at-bat in the post season. A third baseman 
in the minor leagues, Berra earned playing time at third, second and shortstop 
his first five seasons in the majors before being handed the starting shortstop 
job in 1982. That season, he enjoyed career highs in batting average (.263), 
hits (139), runs scored (64) and runs batted in (61). Yogi Berra was named 
manager of the Yankees prior to the start of the 1984 season. Following 
the season, the Yankees acquired the younger Berra, along with Jay Buhner 
and Alfonso Pulido for Steve Kemp and Tim Foli, whom Berra had replaced 
as the Pirates starting shortstop. Dale became the first son to play for 
his father in the major leagues since Earle Mack appeared in a total of 
125 games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1937 and 1939 under Connie 
Mack.[citation needed] Dale was batting .343 until his father was fired 
sixteen games into the 1985 season and replaced by Billy Martin. Under 
Martin, Dale was returned to a back-up infielder role, and his batting 
average fell to .229 for the season. The most notable play of Berra's career 
was a bizarre baserunning gaffe which also involved Bobby Meacham in an 
11-inning 6–5 loss to the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium on August 
2, 1985. With Meacham and Berra the runners at second and first base respectively 
in the seventh inning of a game tied at three, Rickey Henderson hit a ball 
that rolled to the farthest reaches of left-center field. When Meacham 
slipped between second and third base, both runners ended up approaching 
home plate in synchronized fashion, one on the heels of the other. After 
catching the relay throw from shortstop Ozzie Guillén, catcher Carlton 
Fisk tagged out Meacham to his right, then turned to his left just a split 
second later to do the same to Berra to complete the double play. Martin 
commented, "I've never seen that in grammar school, much less a major-league 
game."[4] On September 9, 1985,[5] Berra testified during the cocaine distribution 
trial of Curtis Strong that he shared cocaine with other members of the 
Pirates.[6] On February 28, 1986 Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth 
suspended several players including Berra. The suspensions were waived 
with a commitment for community service and a donation of 10% of the salary 
for one year. Lou Piniella was named the Yankees' manager in 1986 and Berra 
was released on July 27. Shortly afterwards, he was signed by the Houston 
Astros where Yogi Berra was a coach. Dale spent the rest of the 1986 season 
with Houston's triple-A affiliate. After spending most of 1987 with triple-A 
Tucson, Berra debuted with the Astros on August 15. He batted .178 in 19 
games for the Astros, and was released at the end of the season. He spent 
the 1988 season in the Baltimore Orioles' system before retiring. In April 
1989, Berra was charged with cocaine possession.[7] After a three-year 
pre-trial intervention program, the charges were dismissed.[8] In 1990, 
Berra was running a construction company in Cranford, New Jersey.[9] Dale 
Berra is now one of the principals of LTD Enterprises, which controls the 
brand image of his father.[10] Berra played more games than any son of 
a Hall-of-Famer, topping Dick Sisler (853 to 799). His older brother, Larry, 
played briefly in the New York Mets organization,[11] and his older brother,
