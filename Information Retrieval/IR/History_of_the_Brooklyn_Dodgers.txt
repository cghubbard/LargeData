The Brooklyn Dodgers were an American baseball team that was active in 
the major leagues from 1884 until 1957, after which it moved to Los Angeles, 
where it continued its history as the Los Angeles Dodgers. The team's name 
derived from the reputed skill of Brooklyn residents at evading the city's 
trolley streetcar network. The Dodgers played in two stadiums in South 
Brooklyn, each named Washington Park, and at Eastern Park in the neighborhood 
of Brownsville before moving to Ebbets Field in the neighborhood of Flatbush 
in 1913. The team is noted for signing Jackie Robinson in 1947 as the first 
black player in the modern major leagues.[1] Brooklyn was home to numerous 
baseball clubs in the mid-1850s. Eight of 16 participants in the first 
convention were from Brooklyn, including the Atlantic, Eckford, and Excelsior 
clubs that combined to dominate play for most of the 1860s. Brooklyn helped 
make baseball commercial, as the locale of the first paid admission games, 
a series of three all star contests matching New York and Brooklyn in 1858. 
Brooklyn also featured the first two enclosed baseball grounds, the Union 
Grounds and the Capitoline Grounds; enclosed, dedicated ballparks accelerated 
the evolution from amateurism to professionalism. Despite the early success 
of Brooklyn clubs in the National Association of Base Ball Players, officially 
amateur until 1869, they fielded weak teams in the succeeding National 
Association of Professional Base Ball Players, the first professional league 
formed in 1871. The Excelsiors no longer challenged for the amateur championship 
after the Civil War and never entered the professional NA. The Eckfords 
and Atlantics declined to join until 1872 and thereby lost their best players; 
the Eckfords survived only one season and the Atlantics four, with losing 
teams. The National League replaced the NA in 1876 and granted exclusive 
territories to its eight members, excluding the Atlantics in favor of the 
New York Mutuals who had shared home grounds with the Atlantics. When the 
Mutuals were expelled by the league, the Hartford Dark Blues club moved 
in, changed its name to The Brooklyn Hartfords[2] and played its home games 
at Union Grounds in 1877 before disbanding. The team currently known as 
the Dodgers was formed as the "Brooklyn Grays" in 1883 by real estate magnate 
and baseball enthusiast Charles Byrne, who convinced his brother-in-law 
Joseph Doyle and casino operator Ferdinand Abell to start the team with 
him. Byrne arranged to build a grandstand on a lot bounded by Third Street, 
Fourth Avenue, Fifth Street, and Fifth Avenue, and named it Washington 
Park in honor of George Washington.[3] The Grays played in the minor Inter-State 
Association of Professional Baseball Clubs that first season. Doyle became 
the first team manager, and they drew 6,431 fans to their first home game 
on May 12, 1883 against the Trenton team. The Grays won the league title 
after the Camden Merritt club disbanded on July 20 and Brooklyn picked 
up some of its better players. The Grays were invited to join the American 
Association for the 1884 season.[4] After winning the American Association 
league championship in 1889, the Grays moved to the National League and 
won the 1890 NL Championship, the only Major League team to win consecutive 
championships in both professional "base ball" leagues.[5] They lost the 
1889 World Series to the New York Giants and tied the 1890 World Series 
with the Louisville Colonels. Their success during this period was partly 
attributed to their having absorbed skilled players from the defunct New 
York Metropolitans and Brooklyn Ward's Wonders. In 1899, the Grays merged 
with the Baltimore Orioles, as Baltimore manager Ned Hanlon became the 
club's new manager and Charles Ebbets became the primary team owner. The 
team name, Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers, was coined in 1895.[6] The nickname 
was still new enough in September 1895 that a newspaper could report that 
"'Trolley Dodgers' is the new name which eastern baseball cranks [fans] 
have given the Brooklyn club."[7] In 1895, Brooklyn played at Eastern Park, 
bounded by Eastern Parkway (now Pitkin Avenue), Powell Street, Sutter Avenue, 
Van Sinderen Street,[3] where they had moved early in the 1891 season when 
the second Washington Park burned down. Some sources erroneously report 
that the name "Trolley Dodgers" referred to pedestrians avoiding fast cars 
on street car tracks that bordered Eastern Park on two sides. However, 
Eastern Park was not bordered by street-level trolley lines that had to 
be "dodged" by pedestrians.[8] The name "Trolley Dodgers" implied the dangers 
posed by trolley cars in Brooklyn generally, which in 1892, began the switch 
from horse-power to electrical power, which made them much faster, and 
were hence regarded as more dangerous.[6] The name was soon shortened to 
Brooklyn Dodgers.[9] Other team names used by the franchise that finally 
came to be called "the Dodgers" were the Grooms, the Bridegrooms,[10] Ward's 
Wonders,[11] the Superbas,[12] and the Robins.[13] All of these nicknames 
were used by fans and newspaper sports writers to describe the team, but 
not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base 
Ball Club.[14] However, the "Trolley Dodgers" nickname was used throughout 
this period, along with other nicknames, by fans and sports writers of 
the day. The team did not use the name in a formal sense until 1932, when 
the word "Dodgers" appeared on team jerseys.[15] The "conclusive shift" 
came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name 
"Dodgers".[16] Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were 
used interchangeably are available from newspaper articles from the period 
before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game the Dodgers played 
in 1916 starts out by referring to how "Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, 
did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National 
League pennant", but then goes on to comment, "the only thing that saved 
the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies 
lost one of the two games played."[17] Most baseball statistics sites and 
baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn 
team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article used the nickname Robins 
in its title "Buccaneers Take Last From Robins", but the subtitle of the 
article reads "Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break".[18][19] 
Another example of the interchangeability of the different nicknames is 
found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series, 
which identifies the matchup in the series as "Dodgers vs. Indians", despite 
the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent usage at this 
point for around six years.[20] The historic and heated rivalry between 
the Dodgers and the Giants is more than a century old. It began when the 
Dodgers and Giants faced each other in the 1889 World Series, the ancestor 
of the Subway Series, and both played in separate cities (the Dodgers in 
Brooklyn and the Giants in New York City Manhattan). When both franchises 
moved to California after the 1957 season, the rivalry was easily transplanted, 
as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been rivals in 
economics, culture, and politics. Manager Wilbert Robinson, another former 
Oriole, popularly known as "Uncle Robbie", restored the Brooklyn team to 
respectability. His "Brooklyn Robins" reached the 1916 and 1920 World Series, 
losing both, but contending perennially for several seasons.[21] Charles 
Ebbets and Ed McKeever died within a week of each other in 1925, and Robbie 
was named president while still field manager.[22] Upon assuming the title 
of president, however, Robinson's ability to focus on the field declined, 
and the teams of the late 1920s were often fondly referred to as the "Daffiness 
Boys" for their distracted, error-ridden style of play.[23] Outfielder 
Babe Herman was the leader both in hitting and in zaniness. The signature 
Dodger play from this era occurred when three players – Dazzy Vance, Chick 
Fewster, and Herman – ended up at third base at the same time. (The play 
is often remembered as Herman "tripling into a triple play", though only 
two of the three players were declared out and Herman was credited with 
a double rather than a triple.)[24] Herman later complained that no one 
remembered that he drove in the winning run on the play. The incident led 
to the popular joke: After his removal as club president, Robinson returned 
to managing, and the club's performance rebounded somewhat.[23] When Robinson 
retired in 1931, he was replaced as manager by Max Carey.[23] Although 
some suggested renaming the "Robins" the "Brooklyn Canaries", after Carey, 
whose last name was originally "Carnarius", the name "Brooklyn Dodgers" 
returned to stay following Robinson's retirement.[23] It was during this 
era that Willard Mullin, a noted sports cartoonist, fixed the Brooklyn 
team with the lovable nickname of "Dem Bums". After hearing his cab driver 
ask, "So how did those bums do today?", Mullin decided to sketch an exaggerated 
version of famed circus clown Emmett Kelly to represent the Dodgers in 
his much-praised cartoons in the New York World-Telegram. Both image and 
nickname caught on, so much so that many a Dodger yearbook cover, from 
1951 through 1957, featured a Willard Mullin illustration of the Brooklyn 
Bum. Perhaps the highlight of the Daffiness Boys era came after Wilbert 
Robinson left the dugout.[23] In 1934, Giants player/manager Bill Terry 
was asked about the Dodgers’ chances in the coming pennant race and cracked 
infamously, "Is Brooklyn still in the league?" Managed then by Casey Stengel, 
who played for the Dodgers in the 1910s and went on to greatness managing 
the New York Yankees,[23] the 1934 Dodgers were determined to make their 
presence felt. As it happened, the season entered its final games with 
the Giants tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the pennant, with the 
Giants’ remaining games against the Dodgers. Stengel led his Bums to the 
Polo Grounds for the showdown, and they beat the Giants twice to knock 
them out of the pennant race.[23] The "Gashouse Gang" Cardinals nailed 
the pennant by beating the Cincinnati Reds those same two days.[23] One 
key development during this era was the 1938 appointment of Leland "Larry" 
MacPhail as Dodgers' general manager.[23] MacPhail, who brought night games 
to Major League Baseball as general manager of the Reds, also started night 
baseball in Brooklyn and ordered the successful refurbishing of Ebbets 
Field.[23] He also brought Reds voice Red Barber to Brooklyn as the Dodgers' 
lead announcer in 1939, just after MacPhail broke the New York baseball 
executives' agreement to ban live baseball broadcasts, enacted because 
of the fear of the effect of radio calls on the home teams' attendance. 
MacPhail remained with the Dodgers until 1942, when he returned to the 
Armed Forces for World War II. He later became one of the Yankees' co-owners, 
bidding unsuccessfully for Barber to join him in the Bronx as announcer. 
The first major-league baseball game to be televised was Brooklyn's 6–1 
victory over Cincinnati at Ebbets Field on August 26, 1939. Batting helmets 
were introduced to Major League Baseball by the Dodgers in 1941. For most 
of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed 
a black player. A parallel system of Negro Leagues developed, but most 
of the Negro League players were denied a chance to prove their skill before 
a national audience. Jackie Robinson became the first African-American 
to play Major League baseball in the 20th Century when he played his first 
major league game on April 15, 1947 as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
Robinson's entry into the league was mainly due to General Manager Branch 
Rickey's efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have 
been primarily moral, although business considerations were also present. 
Rickey was a member of the Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination 
to the United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for 
social justice and active later in the Civil Rights Movement.[26] Besides 
selecting Robinson for his exceptional baseball skills, Rickey also considered 
Robinson's outstanding personal character, his UCLA education and rank 
of captain in the U.S. Army in his decision, since he knew that boos, taunts, 
and criticism was going to be directed at Robinson, and that Robinson had 
to be tough enough to withstand abuse without attempting to retaliate.[27] 
The inclusion of Robinson on the team also led the Dodgers to move its 
spring training site. Prior to 1946, the Dodgers held their spring training 
in Jacksonville, Florida. However, the city's stadium refused to host an 
exhibition game with the Montreal Royals – the Dodgers’ own farm club – 
on whose roster Robinson appeared at the time, citing segregation laws. 
Nearby Sanford similarly declined. Ultimately, City Island Ballpark in 
Daytona Beach agreed to host the game with Robinson on the field. The team 
traveled to Havana, Cuba for spring training in 1947, this time with Robinson 
on the big club. Although the Dodgers ultimately built Dodgertown and its 
Holman Stadium further south in Vero Beach, and played there for 61 spring 
training seasons from 1948 through 2008, Daytona Beach renamed City Island 
Ballpark to Jackie Robinson Ballpark in his honor. This event was the continuation 
of the integration of professional sports in the United States, with professional 
football having led the way in 1946, with the concomitant demise of the 
Negro Leagues, and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American 
civil rights movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner 
who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient 
of the Rookie of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson 
award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other 
teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947–1956 success. They won 
six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP 
Roy Campanella, Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam, and Joe 
Black. Robinson eventually became the first African-American elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. After the wilderness years of the 1920s 
and 1930s, the Dodgers were rebuilt into a contending club first by general 
manager Larry MacPhail and then the legendary Branch Rickey. Led by Jackie 
Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, and Gil Hodges in the infield, Duke Snider and 
Carl Furillo in the outfield, Roy Campanella behind the plate, and Don 
Newcombe, Carl Erskine, and Preacher Roe on the pitcher's mound, the Dodgers 
won pennants in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953, only to fall to the New 
York Yankees in all five of the subsequent World Series. The annual ritual 
of building excitement, followed in the end by disappointment, became a 
common pattern to the long suffering fans, and "Wait ’til next year!" became 
an unofficial Dodger slogan. While the Dodgers generally enjoyed success 
during this period, in 1951 they fell victim to one of the largest collapses 
in the history of baseball.[28] On August 11, 1951, Brooklyn led the National 
League by an enormous 13½ games over their archrivals, the Giants. While 
the Dodgers went 26–22 from that time until the end of the season, the 
Giants went on an absolute tear, winning an amazing 37 of their last 44 
games, including their last seven in a row. At the end of the season the 
Dodgers and the Giants were tied for first place, forcing a three-game 
playoff for the pennant. The Giants took Game 1 by a score of 3–1 before 
being shut out by the Dodgers' Clem Labine in Game 2, 10–0. It all came 
down to the final game, and Brooklyn seemed to have the pennant locked 
up, holding a 4–2 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning. Giants outfielder 
Bobby Thomson, however, hit a stunning three-run walk-off home run off 
the Dodgers' Ralph Branca to secure the NL Championship for New York. To 
this day Thomson's home run is known as the Shot Heard 'Round The World. 
In 1955, by which time the core of the Dodger team was beginning to age, 
"next year" finally came. The fabled "Boys of Summer" shot down the "Bronx 
Bombers" in seven games,[29] led by the first-class pitching of young left-hander 
Johnny Podres, whose key pitch was a changeup known as "pulling down the 
lampshade" because of the arm motion used right when the ball was released.[30] 
Podres won two Series games, including the deciding seventh. The turning 
point of Game 7 was a spectacular double play that began with left fielder 
Sandy Amorós running down Yogi Berra's long fly ball, then throwing to 
shortstop Pee Wee Reese, who doubled up a surprised Gil McDougald at first 
base to preserve the Dodger lead. The Dodgers won 2–0. Although the Dodgers 
lost the World Series to the Yankees in 1956 during which the Yankees pitcher 
Don Larsen pitched the only World Series perfect game in baseball history 
and the only post-season no-hitter for the next 54 years, it hardly seemed 
to matter. Brooklyn fans had their memory of triumph, and soon that was 
all they were left with – a victory that was remembered decades later in 
the Billy Joel single "We Didn't Start the Fire", which included the line, 
"Brooklyn's got a winning team." Real estate businessman Walter O'Malley 
had acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, when he bought 
the shares of team co-owners Branch Rickey and the estate of John L. Smith. 
Before long, O'Malley was working to buy new land in Brooklyn for a new, 
more accessible and better ballpark than Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, 
Ebbets Field had grown old and was not well served by infrastructure, to 
the point where the Dodgers could not "sell out" the park to maximum capacity 
even in the heat of a pennant race, despite dominating the league from 
1946 to 1957. New York City Construction Coordinator Robert Moses, however, 
sought to force O'Malley into using a site in Flushing Meadows, Queens 
– the eventual location of Shea Stadium. Moses' vision involved a city-built, 
city-owned park, which was greatly at odds with O'Malley's real-estate 
savvy. When O'Malley realized that he was not going to be allowed to buy 
a suitable parcel of land in Brooklyn, he began thinking of team relocation. 
O'Malley was free to purchase land of his own choosing but wanted Robert 
Moses to condemn land along the Atlantic Railroad Yards in downtown Brooklyn 
under Title I authority. Title I gave the city municipality power to condemn 
land for the purpose of building what it calls "public purpose" projects. 
Moses' interpretation of "public purpose" included public parks, public 
housing and public highways and bridges. What O'Malley wanted was for Moses 
to use Title I authority, rather than to pay market value for the land. 
With Title I the city via Robert Moses could have sold the land to O'Malley 
at a below market price. Moses refused to honor O'Malley's request and 
responded, "If you want the land so bad, why don't you purchase it with 
your own money?"[31] Meanwhile, non-stop transcontinental airline travel 
had become routine during the years since the Second World War, and teams 
were no longer bound by much slower railroad timetables. Because of civil 
aviation advances, it became possible to locate teams farther apart – as 
far west as California – while maintaining the same busy game schedules. 
When Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to entice 
a team to move to the City of Angels, they were not even thinking of the 
Dodgers. Their original target had been the Washington Senators franchise, 
which moved to Bloomington, Minnesota to become the Minnesota Twins in 
1961. At the same time, O'Malley was looking for a contingency in case 
Moses and other New York politicians refused to let him build the Brooklyn 
stadium he wanted, and sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was 
interested in talking. Los Angeles offered him what New York did not: a 
chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, 
giving him complete control over all its revenue streams. Meanwhile, Giants 
owner Horace Stoneham was having similar difficulty finding a replacement 
for his team's antiquated home stadium, the Polo Grounds. Stoneham was 
considering moving the Giants to Minneapolis, but was persuaded instead 
to move them to San Francisco, ensuring that the Dodgers had a National 
League rival closer than St. Louis. So the two arch-rival teams, the Dodgers 
and Giants, moved out to the West Coast together after the 1957 season. 
The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 
24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2–0 over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On April 
18, 1958, the Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game in L.A., defeating 
the former New York and newly relocated and renamed San Francisco Giants, 
6–5, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.[32] Sadly, 
catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, 
was never able to play for Los Angeles. A 2007 HBO film, Brooklyn Dodgers: 
The Ghosts of Flatbush, is a documentary covering the Dodgers history from 
early days to the beginning of the Los Angeles era. In the film, the story 
is related that O'Malley was so hated by Brooklyn Dodger fans after the 
move to California, that it was said, "If you asked a Brooklyn Dodger fan, 
if you had a gun with only two bullets in it and were in a room with Hitler, 
Stalin and O'Malley, who would you shoot? The answer: O'Malley, twice!"
