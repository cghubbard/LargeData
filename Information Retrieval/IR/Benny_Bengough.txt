Bernard Oliver "Benny" Bengough (July 27, 1898 – December 22, 1968) was 
an American professional baseball player and coach.[1] He played the majority 
of his Major League Baseball career as a catcher for the New York Yankees 
during the 1920s when the team garnered the nickname of Murderers' Row, 
due to their potent batting lineup.[1][2] He played the final two seasons 
of his career with the St. Louis Browns.[1] Bengough was a light-hitting, 
defensive specialist. After his playing career, he spent 18 seasons as 
a major league coach.[3] Born in Niagara Falls, New York, Bengough was 
a graduate of Niagara University.[4] He began his professional baseball 
career at the age of 18 with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League 
in 1917.[5] After having played for six seasons in Buffalo, he made his 
major league debut with the Yankees on May 18, 1923 at the age of 24.[1] 
1923 was also the first year the Yankees played their home games in Yankee 
Stadium. At the beginning of his playing career, Bengough served as a back 
up catcher to Wally Schang.[4] On June 1, 1925, the same day that Lou Gehrig 
replaced Wally Pipp as the Yankees' first baseman, Bengough was given the 
Yankees' starting catcher's job.[3] He ended the season with a .258 batting 
average along with a career-high 14 doubles and 23 runs batted in.[1] Although 
Bengough was a good defensive player, his offense did not satisfy Yankees 
manager Miller Huggins and, he returned to his role as a backup catcher 
for the next few seasons.[6][7] He had a close friendship with teammate 
Babe Ruth, both on and off the field.[8] In 1926, Bengough developed a 
recurring throwing arm injury and the ailment would keep him from playing 
in the 1926 World Series.[4][9] He began to play regularly late in the 
1928 season and started in all four games of the 1928 World Series, as 
the Yankees swept the St. Louis Cardinals.[10][11] He led American League 
catchers in 1928 with a .992 fielding percentage.[12] Bengough's arm injury 
continued to hamper him during spring training in 1929 as Bill Dickey took 
over as the Yankees starting catcher, going on to a successful career and 
eventual induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[13][14] In 1930, the 
Yankees released Bengough to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association.[1][5] 
In July 1931, he returned to the major leagues with the St. Louis Browns, 
where he served as a backup catcher to future Hall of Fame member, Rick 
Ferrell.[1][5] He played in his final major league game on September 24, 
1932.[1] Bengough then returned to the minor leagues where he served as 
a player-manager for the Washington Generals of the Pennsylvania State 
Association in 1933 and 1934.[15] He became the player-manager of the Joplin 
Miners from 1936 to 1937 before retiring as a player at the age of 38.[3][15] 
In a ten-year major league career, Bengough played in 411 games, accumulating 
287 hits in 1,125 at bats for a .255 career batting average, along with 
no home runs, 108 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .295.[1] 
He had a career fielding percentage of .988 which was 10 points above the 
league average during his playing career.[1] Bengough caught for five pitchers 
who would eventually be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[16] After 
retiring as a player, Bengough was named as a coach for the Newark Bears 
in December 1937.[17] Bengough became known for entertaining spectators 
with his humor from the coaching box.[18] He would often remove his cap 
to reveal his bald head and then run his fingers through his imaginary 
hair.[3] Bengough coached in the major leagues for the Washington Senators 
(1940–43), Boston Braves (1944–45) and Philadelphia Phillies (1946–58).[3] 
He reached another World Series as a coach when the 1950 Phillies team 
known as the Whiz Kids won the National League pennant. Bengough was relieved 
of his Phillies coaching duties on April 11, 1959, but continued to work 
for the organization in public relations.[19] In 1959, Bengough was named 
as the head of the Junior Baseball Federation of Philadelphia which raised 
funds for under-privileged children.[20] He died of a heart attack in Philadelphia
