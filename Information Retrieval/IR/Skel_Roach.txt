Rudolph Charles "Skel" Roach (born Rudolph Charles Weichbrodt, October 
20, 1871 – March 9, 1958) was a baseball player and coach. He played professional 
baseball from 1895 to 1905, including one game in Major League Baseball 
with the Chicago Orphans on August 9, 1899. He was also a college baseball 
coach for the Lewis Institute (now part of Illinois Institute of Technology), 
the University of Michigan, and Indiana University. He later became an 
attorney practicing in the Chicago area. Roach was born in 1871 at what 
was then known as Danzig, Germany, and is now Gdańsk, Poland. His birth 
name was Rudolph Charles Weichbrodt.[1] He emigrated to the United States 
in 1880.[2] Roach began an eleven-year career in professional baseball 
at age 23 with the Des Moines Prohibitionists of the Western Association. 
He compiled a 13–7 record for Des Moines in 1895.[3] Roach appeared in 
only one major league game, pitching a complete game victory for the Chicago 
Orphans on August 9, 1899.[1] Roach played nine seasons of minor league 
baseball from 1895 to 1905. He played for Des Moines Prohibitionists (1895), 
Mobile Blackbirds (1896, 1898), Kansas City Blues (1897), Omaha Omahogs 
(1900–1901), Des Moines Hawkeyes (1900), Butte Miners (1902–1903), Portland 
Browns (1904) and Seattle Siwashes. His best season as a pitcher was 1903 
when he won 22 games and lost nine with 137 strikeouts for the Butte Miners 
in the Pacific National League.[3][4] His final season as a minor league 
player was 1905, when he won 15 games and maintained a 2.47 earned run 
average for the Seattle Siwashes in the Pacific Coast League.[3] Roach 
coached baseball at the Lewis Institute (now part of Illinois Institute 
of Technology) from 1899 to 1902, leading the team to championships all 
four years.[5] In 1903, he was hired as the baseball coach at the University 
of Michigan.[5][6] Upon his arrival at Michigan in March 1903, The Michigan 
Alumnus wrote: "Mr. Roach, the new baseball coach, came to Ann Arbor to 
take charge of the men, March 20. He is a big fellow, and bears all the 
marks of a ball-player. He has been playing professional ball for a number 
of years past, at Butte, Montana, in the Pacific-Northwest league, and 
also, for a short time with a Chicago league team."[5] He led the Wolverines 
to a 12–5 record in 1903.[7] Roach later coached baseball at Indiana University. 
Roach later attended law school at Northwestern University and became an 
attorney. He married Louise Otillie Eichman. At the time of the 1910 Census, 
Roach and his wife were living in Chicago with his mother-in-law, Otillie 
Eichmann. His occupation was listed as lawyer.[2] At the time of the 1920 
Census, Roach and his wife were living in Oak Park, Illinois with two daughters, 
Louise and Margaret. His occupation was recorded at the time as a lawyer 
in private practice.[8] In 1930, he was living in Oak Park with daughters 
Louise, Margaret and Helen; he was employed as a lawyer in general practice.[9]
