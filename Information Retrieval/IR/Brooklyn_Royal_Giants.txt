The Brooklyn Royal Giants were a professional Negro league baseball team 
based in Brooklyn, New York. Formed in 1905 by John Conner, owner of the 
Brooklyn Royal Cafe, the team initially played against white semi-pro teams.[1] 
They were one of the prominent independent teams prior to World War I before 
organized league play began. In 1907, the Brooklyn Royal Giants joined 
the National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States 
and Cuba.[2] The league lasted three seasons and included the teams Philadelphia 
Giants, Cuban X-Giants, Cuban Stars of Havana, and the Cuban Giants of 
New York. During the 1920s, under the ownership of Nat Strong, a white 
New York City booking agent, the team fell into somewhat of a decline, 
and did very poorly while in Eastern Colored League. The Giants played 
their home games while part of the Eastern Colored League at Dexter Park 
in Queens. The Giants played a pair of games against teams featuring Babe 
Ruth and Lou Gehrig.[3] On October 11, 1926, the Giants took on a squad 
featuring Babe Ruth in Bradley Beach, New Jersey. The Giants won this game 
3-1. Following this, in 1928, the Giants played a combined team of the 
Bustin' Babes (Ruth's barnstorming squad) and the Larrupin' Lous (Gehrig's 
barnstorming squad) in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The Giants returned to 
independent play in 1928 and rebuilt the roster, but the quality of the 
rebuilt team never matched that of the early years. By the mid-1930s, the 
quality was no better than that of a minor league team, and in the early 
1940s it had fallen to a semi-professional status. The team disbanded in
