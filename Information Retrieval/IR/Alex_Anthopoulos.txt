Alex Anthopoulos (born May 25, 1977)[1] is a Canadian professional baseball 
executive with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization. He was the senior 
vice president of baseball operations and general manager of the Toronto 
Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2010 to 2015, for whom began 
as a scouting coordinator in 2003. Prior to the Blue Jays, Anthopoulos 
got his start in professional baseball with the Montreal Expos organization 
in 2000.[1][2] In 2015, he was named the Sporting News Executive of the 
Year after the Blue Jays advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 
1993, reaching the American League Championship Series (ALCS). However, 
his term with the Blue Jays ended on October 29, 2015, when he declined 
a five-year contract extension.[3] In 2000, Anthopoulos was hired by the 
Montreal Expos as an unpaid intern, and worked sorting players' fan mail.[4] 
After working in the mail room he would sit with the scouts at games and 
take notes, and was eventually moved to a scouting internship in Florida.[4] 
In 2002, he was promoted to the Expos' scouting coordinator. He would leave 
the team at the end of the 2003 season, while working as the assistant 
scouting director.[4] Anthopoulos joined the Toronto Blue Jays in late 
2003, as their scouting coordinator.[4] After the 2005 season, he was promoted 
to assistant general manager (AGM) under J. P. Ricciardi.[5] While serving 
as AGM, the Blue Jays acquired José Bautista[6] and Edwin Encarnación,[7] 
who both unexpectedly reached a career renaissance, establishing new levels 
of production and consistency that were key components of the Blue Jays' 
offense during Anthopoulos' time as GM. Bautista was major leagues' home 
run leader from 2010–11, and, in each year from 2010 to 2015, was an All-Star 
and hit at least 27 home runs.[8] Encarnacion hit at least 34 home runs 
each year from 2012 to 2015.[9] Anthopoulos became the Blue Jays' general 
manager in October 2009, after Ricciardi was fired.[10] He began his tenure 
as the general manager by playing a major role in one of the biggest trades 
in Blue Jays history, "The Doc Deal". In the deal, Anthopoulos traded Roy 
Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies for Kyle Drabek, Michael Taylor, 
and Travis d'Arnaud.[11] Anthopoulos was also instrumental in doubling 
the size of the Blue Jays' scouting department, growing it to 54 scouts 
in various positions.[12] The 2010 draft, the first with Anthopoulos in 
charge, resulted in a highly successful draft with a number of players 
picked eventually enjoying significant playing careers in the majors, including 
Aaron Sanchez and Noah Syndergaard.[12] The Jays' first season with Anthopoulos 
at the helm resulted in an 85–77 record, good for fourth place in the American 
League (AL) East division. The club hit a franchise-record 257 home runs, 
the third-highest single-season total by any club in Major League history.[13] 
In January 2011, Anthopoulos completed a blockbuster trade by shipping 
another long-time face of the Blue Jays franchise, Vernon Wells, and the 
remaining US$86 million over the next four years to the Los Angeles Angels 
for catcher Mike Napoli and outfielder Juan Rivera.[14] He then sent Napoli 
to the Texas Rangers for pitcher Frank Francisco,[15] and later traded 
Rivera to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later or cash 
considerations.[16] In July 2011, Anthopoulos made two successive trades 
to acquire center fielder Colby Rasmus from the St. Louis Cardinals. In 
the first, the Blue Jays traded pitching prospect Zach Stewart and reliever 
Jason Frasor to the Chicago White Sox for starting pitcher Edwin Jackson 
and infielder Mark Teahen.[17] Jackson was then traded with outfielder 
Corey Patterson, and relief pitchers Marc Rzepczynski and Octavio Dotel 
to the Cardinals for Rasmus and relief pitchers Brian Tallet, P.J. Walters 
and Trever Miller.[18] Before the 2012 Major League Baseball season, Anthopoulos 
was known to make trades in order to acquire supplemental draft picks. 
The most prominent example was when he acquired Miguel Olivo, a Type B 
free agent, and declined his club option the next day making Olivo a free 
agent.[19] The Blue Jays gained a supplemental first-round draft pick when 
Olivo signed with the Seattle Mariners, taking Dwight Smith, Jr..[20] In 
November 2012, Anthopolous completed a blockbuster deal with the Miami 
Marlins, acquiring shortstop Jose Reyes, pitchers Mark Buehrle and Josh 
Johnson, catcher John Buck, and infielder/outfielder Emilio Bonifacio in 
exchange for shortstop Yunel Escobar, pitcher Henderson Alvarez, catcher 
Jeff Mathis and four minor-league prospects. Cash was also sent to the 
Jays in the trade.[21] In December 2012, Anthopoulos acquired the 2012 
National League Cy Young Award winner R.A. Dickey in a trade with the New 
York Mets that sent prospects Travis d'Arnaud, Noah Syndergaard, minor 
leaguer Wuilmer Becerra and Buck to New York. Toronto also received catcher 
Josh Thole and minor league catcher Mike Nickeas in the trade.[22] As part 
of the transaction, the Blue Jays signed Dickey to an extension worth a 
total of $29 million over three years with a $12 million fourth year option.[23] 
In 2013, the Blue Jays finished at 74–88, in last place in the AL East.[24] 
The next year, they improved to 83–79 and third place.[25] During the 2014 
offseason, Anthopoulos traded Canadian third baseman Brett Lawrie, along 
with three prospects, to the Oakland Athletics for Josh Donaldson.[26] 
In July 2015, he acquired Troy Tulowitzki and LaTroy Hawkins from the Colorado 
Rockies in exchange for Jose Reyes, Jeff Hoffman, and Miguel Castro.[27] 
On July 30, he acquired star left-handed pitcher David Price from the Detroit 
Tigers in exchange for Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd, and Jairo Labourt.[28] 
The next day, Anthopoulos traded for outfielder Ben Revere, and in August, 
acquired shortstop Cliff Pennington.[29][30] Price went 9–1 with a 2.30 
earned run average in 74 1⁄3 innings pitched for the Blue Jays.[31] The 
Blue Jays, who had a 50–51 record on July 28, won 43 of their final 61 
games to overtake the New York Yankees and win the AL East division crown 
for their first playoff appearance in 22 seasons.[32] With Donaldson, Bautista, 
and Encarnación (the latter two acquired by previous GM J.P. Ricciardi) 
each hitting at least 39 home runs in 2015,[33] the Blue Jays led the major 
leagues in scoring at 5.50 runs per game.[34] Toronto's season ended in 
an American League Championship Series (ALCS) loss to the Kansas City Royals.[32] 
Donaldson was named the 2015 American League Most Valuable Player.[35] 
Anthopoulos rejected a five-year extension from the Blue Jays organization 
on October 29, 2015, and did not publicly reveal the reasons for his decision. 
He later said “I just think there’s certain things that should remain private 
and behind closed doors, and I know sometimes that’s hard to hear and hard 
to understand. I just think it’s the right thing for the organization and 
the ball club and everybody involved.”[36] There was some speculation that 
his departure was due to the belief that he would not have full autonomy 
under new president/CEO Mark Shapiro. According to The Globe and Mail, 
"The talk around the water cooler is that Anthopoulos wanted the same job 
and responsibility that he had under Beeston, who hired him as GM. That 
was having the ultimate say in all baseball-related decisions."[36] Shapiro 
refuted these claims on November 1, stating “It’s not about autonomy, it’s 
about collective success”. He also denied suggestions that he "scolded" 
Anthopoulos over several deadline trades involving Blue Jays' top prospects.[37] 
Toronto's combined win–loss record was 489–483 while Anthopoulos was GM.[32] 
On October 29, 2015, Sporting News named him Executive of the Year[38] 
as selected by a panel of 47 major league executives.[39] On January 12, 
2016, Anthopoulos was hired as the vice-president of baseball operations 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers.[40] Anthopoulos is a Greek Canadian who was 
born in Montreal, Quebec.[1] He has a degree in economics from McMaster 
University,[2] and is married with two children.[41] Anthopoulos served 
as an advance scout for the Greek National Baseball Team for the 2004 Summer
