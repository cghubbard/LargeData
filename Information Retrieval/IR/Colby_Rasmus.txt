Colby Ryan Rasmus (born August 11, 1986) is an American professional baseball 
outfielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros. 
While primarily a center fielder throughout his career, Rasmus mostly played 
left field for the Astros. Rasmus played as pitcher and first baseman for 
Phenix City National Little League during the 1999 Little League World 
Series. Phenix City won the United States championship game,[1] before 
losing in the finals to Osaka, Japan, 5–0.[2] Rasmus finished the World 
Series with a batting average of .417 and a pitching record of 0–1 with 
7 strikeouts. Rasmus attended Russell County High School in Seale, Alabama. 
As a senior, he batted .484 with 24 home runs, 66 RBIs and 69 runs scored 
in 39 games. His 24 home runs passed Bo Jackson for second all-time in 
the state for home runs in a season by a high school player. In a pre-draft 
workout, Rasmus was clocked at 95 mph (153 km/h) throwing from center field. 
He also ran 60 yards in 6.7 seconds. Rasmus helped lead Russell County 
to a national championship in 2005 as they finished the season ranked first 
in both the National High School Baseball Coaches Association poll and 
the USA TODAY Super 25 baseball rankings.[3][4] Rasmus graduated from Russell 
County High School in 2005. The St. Louis Cardinals selected Rasmus with 
the 28th pick of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft. The pick was sent 
to the Cardinals from the Boston Red Sox in compensation for the Red Sox 
signing Edgar Rentería in free agency. Rasmus received a $1,000,000 signing 
bonus from the Cardinals.[citation needed] Rasmus began the 2006 season 
with the Swing of the Quad Cities of the Class A Midwest League, and ended 
his 2006 season, his second in professional baseball, on the Palm Beach 
Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. Between Quad Cities 
and Palm Beach, he combined for a .288 average, 16 home runs, 26 doubles, 
batting .365 with 12 home runs. He won the Player of the Month Award in 
August.[citation needed] For the 2007 season, Rasmus was assigned to the 
Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League, Double-A affiliate of the St. 
Louis Cardinals. The Tulsa Drillers (Double-A) manager, Stu Cole, commented 
on Rasmus' high level of talent: "If there was a five-tool player in the 
league last year, Rasmus was the one. He brought everything to the table. 
And defensively he made more plays to save his team runs. If the ball was 
in the air there was a chance you were going to see something exciting."[5] 
Later, he played in the Arizona Fall League during winter of 2007 for Team 
USA. He batted .286 over six games.[6] Rasmus was a non-roster invitee 
to the Cardinals in spring training, 2008 trying to claim a regular spot 
in the lineup after the Cardinals traded Jim Edmonds on December 15, 2007. 
On March 17, 2008, the Cardinals assigned Rasmus to the Memphis Redbirds 
of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.[citation needed] In 2008, Rasmus 
was selected to play baseball as a member of the United States national 
baseball team in the Beijing Olympics. He was unable to attend due to injury.[citation 
needed] On January 23, 2009, the Cardinals gave out 20 non-roster invitations 
(including three free agents) to spring training, including their top minor-league 
players Rasmus, and Brett Wallace.[7] Rasmus was included in Baseball America's 
2009 Top 100 Prospects list as the No. 3 prospect in all of MLB.[8] On 
April 3, 2009, Rasmus was named to the opening day roster of the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He made his major-league debut on April 7 against Pittsburgh 
at Busch Stadium.[9] He earned his first major league hit in his second 
career at-bat, on a single to right field off Pittsburgh's Ian Snell. He 
went 2-for-4 in the game, with two runs scored, including his first career 
run on a home run by Albert Pujols. On May 2, he hit his first home run 
vs. the Washington Nationals while Pujols took a day off after playing 
in the team's first 24 games. The Cardinals lost the game, 6–1.[10] On 
June 19, he had his first four-hit game, in a 10–5 victory against the 
Kansas City Royals in which Pujols scored his 1000th career run.[citation 
needed] On July 1, he hit his first career walk-off home run off Bob Howry, 
giving the Cardinals a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Giants, leading 
all NL rookies with eight home runs and 29 RBIs. He was the first Cardinals 
rookie to hit a game-winning home run since Andy Van Slyke in August 1983.[citation 
needed] On September 5, 2010, it was reported that Rasmus requested a trade 
from general manager John Mozeliak because of a shortage of playing time, 
and a strained relationship with manager Tony La Russa. Rasmus attempted 
to downplay the rumor[11] and Mozeliak indicated he would not trade Rasmus.[12] 
Rasmus hit his first career grand slam against the Cincinnati Reds' Bronson 
Arroyo. He hit his second grand slam against the San Francisco Giants on 
an 0–2 slider from reliever Guillermo Mota.[citation needed] On July 27, 
2011, Rasmus was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with P. J. Walters, 
Brian Tallet and Trever Miller for Edwin Jackson, Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski 
and Corey Patterson.[13][14] As a Blue Jay, Rasmus finished the season 
with a .173/.201/.316 triple-slash line in thirty-five games.[15] In January 
2012, Rasmus and the Blue Jays agreed on a one-year deal worth $2.7 million. 
In an interleague game against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 19, Rasmus 
hit the first of three straight solo home runs by the Blue Jays, followed 
by Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion, the first time in the 2012 season 
that the Jays went back-to-back-to-back with home runs, and only the sixth 
time in franchise history.[16] Rasmus hit his third career grand slam against 
the Miami Marlins on June 23, 2012. Rasmus finished his 2012 campaign with 
a .223 batting average with 23 home runs and 75 runs batted in. On January 
14, 2013, Rasmus signed a one-year contract worth $4.675 million with the 
Blue Jays, avoiding salary arbitration.[17][18] Rasmus hit a double against 
his brother, Cory, in a game against the Atlanta Braves on May 27, 2013. 
On July 28, 2013, Rasmus hit a walk-off single against the Houston Astros, 
leading the Blue Jays to a 2–1 victory. Later that day, he was the subject 
of an article naming him, along with Adam Jones and Mike Trout, as the 
best active center fielders in baseball.[19] Rasmus recorded his 300th 
career RBI in a 5–2 win over the Oakland Athletics on July 31, 2013. On 
August 2, 2013, Rasmus was named the Blue Jays Player of the Month for 
July by the Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. 
In July, Rasmus batted .371 with 3 home runs and 17 RBI, and also recorded 
an OPS of 1.001.[20] Rasmus went on the disabled list for the first time 
as a Blue Jay on August 14, with an oblique strain.[21] He was activated 
from the disabled list on September 13.[22] In his first two games back, 
Rasmus hit two home runs to reach 20 for the season. In doing so, he became 
the fifth Blue Jay to hit 20 home runs in the 2013 season, and Toronto 
became the only franchise to have five players reach the 20 home run plateau 
(Rasmus, Edwin Encarnacion, Jose Bautista, J. P. Arencibia, and Adam Lind).[23] 
Rasmus was hit in the face by a ball thrown by Anthony Gose during the 
warmups prior to the bottom of the first inning in a game against Boston 
on September 20.[24] He was placed on the disabled list the next day, ending 
his 2013 season. Rasmus ended his best season as a Blue Jay with a .276 
average, 22 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 118 games played.[25] Rasmus was 
announced as the Blue Jays' Wilson Defensive Player of the Year on November 
7, 2013.[26] In January 2014, he filed for salary arbitration with Toronto, 
but came to terms on a one-year, $7 million contract on January 17.[27] 
In a game against the Baltimore Orioles on April 12, 2014, Rasmus hit his 
100th career home run with two outs in the ninth inning against Tommy Hunter. 
He was placed on the disabled list on May 15 with a sore hamstring and 
missed roughly a month of games.[28] Rasmus experienced a decline in his 
play from that point onward, and, beginning in late August, was demoted 
to a bench role in favor of Gose, Kevin Pillar and later Dalton Pompey. 
He received only one start in September and had a total of 13 at-bats, 
finishing the season with a .225 batting average, 18 home runs, and 40 
RBI. Eligible for free agency for the first time in his career, it was 
widely speculated that Rasmus would not seek to re-sign with the Blue Jays, 
nor would Toronto be interested in retaining him.[29] On January 20, 2015, 
Rasmus signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Houston Astros.[30] 
As an everyday starter for the Astros, he finished the 2015 season with 
a .238 average, 25 home runs, and 61 RBIs in 137 games played.[31] He batted 
very well during the last month of the regular season and his success would 
continue into the postseason.[32] In the 2015 American League Wild Card 
Game against the New York Yankees, Rasmus hit a solo home run to score 
the first run of an eventual 3-0 win that advanced the Astros to the ALDS.[33] 
He also homered in each of the first two games of the ALDS. In the process 
he set an MLB record for having an extra-base hit in each of his first 
six career postseason games, dating back to his tenure with the Cardinals. 
[34] The Astros went on to lose the series and Rasmus finished the playoffs 
leading his team in nearly every offensive category. He batted 7 for 17 
(.412 average) along with 4 HRs, 6 RBIs, 7 BBs, and an OPS of 1.760.[31] 
On November 12, 2015, Rasmus became the first player in MLB history to 
accept a qualifying offer, signing a one-year, $15.8 million contract to 
return to Houston.[35] Rasmus is married (Megan) with two daughters (Rylee 
and Teegan). Rasmus has three brothers, Cory, Casey and Cyle. Cory is a 
pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and Casey was a catcher 
in the St. Louis Cardinals' organization.[36] Casey retired in 2014.[37]
