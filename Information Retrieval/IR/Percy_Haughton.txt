Percy Duncan Haughton (July 11, 1876 – October 27, 1924) was an American 
football and baseball player and coach. He served as head football coach 
at Cornell University from 1899 to 1900, at Harvard University from 1908 
to 1916, and at Columbia University from 1923 to 1924, compiling a career 
college football record of 97–17–6. The Harvard Crimson claim national 
champions for three of the seasons that Haughton coached: 1910, 1912, and 
1913. Haughton was also Harvard's head baseball coach in 1915[1] and part 
owner of the Boston Braves from 1916 to 1918.[2] He was inducted into the 
College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951. He was born on July 11, 
1876. Haughton attended Groton School for high school, graduating in 1895, 
and then went on to Harvard College, graduating in 1899. Haughton and his 
wife owned Gould Island in Rhode Island where Haughton trained the Harvard 
football team.[3] Apocryphal tales[4] assert that before the 1908 Harvard-Yale 
Game, Haughton strangled a paper bulldog in the locker room to motivate 
his players. He bought the Boston Braves with Arthur Chamberlin Wise in 
1916.[2] Haughton became Columbia's football coach in spring 1923 as the 
school re-established a team that had been dissolved in 1905 following 
allegations that football had become too violent. To alleviate concerns 
that the game was still too violent, Haughton promised to instill discipline 
in his players, saying: "It will be my purpose to teach the men what they 
should learn in order to better prepare for life after the university. 
If I can do that, if I can contribute toward qualifying them for the finest 
type of citizenship, I will be satisfied."[5] Haughton died on October 
27, 1924 after becoming ill on the Columbia football field.[6][7] Pound
