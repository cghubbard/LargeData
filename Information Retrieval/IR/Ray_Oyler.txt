Raymond Francis Oyler (August 4, 1938 – January 26, 1981) was an American 
Major League Baseball shortstop. He played for the Detroit Tigers (1965–1968), 
Seattle Pilots (1969) and California Angels (1970). He is best remembered 
as the slick-fielding, no-hit shortstop for the 1968 World Series champion 
Tigers and as the subject of the "Ray Oyler Fan Club" organized by Seattle 
radio personality Robert E. Lee Hardwick (of the Pilots flagship radio 
station KVI) in Seattle. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Oyler graduated 
from Cathedral High School in Indianapolis in 1955 and served in the Marine 
Corps before playing in the major leagues.[1] Oyler was signed by the Tigers 
in 1960 as an amateur free agent, making his major league debut with Detroit 
on April 18, 1965. During his first two seasons, Oyler was a backup shortstop 
to Dick McAuliffe. In 1965, Oyler debuted with a .186 batting average, 
with five home runs and six doubles in 82 games. In 1966, Oyler's average 
dropped to .171 in 71 games, with one home run in 210 at bats. In 1967, 
the Tigers moved McAuliffe from shortstop to second base, opening a spot 
for Oyler as the Tigers' starting shortstop. Oyler played a career-high 
147 games at shortstop in 1967 and had career-highs with 185 putouts, 374 
assists, and 61 double plays. As an everyday player in 1967, Oyler also 
increased his batting average to .207—the only year in which he hit above 
.200. He was also third in the American League with 15 sacrifice hits in 
1967. In 1968, Oyler played in 111 games, with 29 hits (21 of them singles) 
for a career-low batting average of .135. He had a .977 fielding percentage 
(15 points above the league average for shortstops). When Oyler, always 
a light hitter, famously went "0 for August", manager Mayo Smith moved 
outfielder Mickey Stanley to the shortstop position for the last nine games 
of the regular season and for all seven games of the 1968 World Series. 
Oyler's batting average had dropped to .135, and Smith had four quality 
outfielders in Willie Horton, Jim Northrup, Al Kaline, and Mickey Stanley 
that he wanted in the lineup for every World Series game. Stanley had not 
played the shortstop position before the 1968 season, but was a talented 
athlete with a good glove. Oyler did not have an official at bat in the 
1968 World Series, but he did appear in all four Detroit victories as a 
defensive replacement and had a sacrifice bunt.[2] In its "The End of the 
Century" series, ESPN rated Smith's decision to move Stanley to shortstop 
for the World Series as one of the 10 greatest coaching decisions of the 
century.[3] Stanley returned to play 59 games at shortstop the next year, 
while Oyler was allowed to be drafted by the expansion Seattle Pilots. 
Oyler was left unprotected in the expansion draft after the 1968 season 
and was the third player drafted by the Seattle Pilots. Before the Pilots 
even played their first game in 1969, Seattle radio disc jockey Robert 
E. Lee "Bob" Hardwick looked over the list of players drafted by the Pilots, 
discovered Oyler's batting average and created the "Ray Oyler Fan Club", 
initially as a radio bit on his radio show.[4] Grabbing onto the popularity 
of the late 1960s Laugh-In show's "Sock it to Me" catchphrase, the fan 
club was called the Ray Oyler "S.O.C. I.T. T.O. M.E. .300" Club, meaning 
"Slugger Oyler Can, In Time, Top Our Manager's Estimate" and hit .300. 
Some 15,000 baseball-starved fans signed up,[5] and former Pilots relief 
pitcher Jack Aker recalled that the Ray Oyler Fan Club was out in great 
number at Sick's Stadium on the Pilots Opening Day. The fan club even gave 
Oyler a car to use and an apartment too.[6] When Oyler came to bat for 
the first time on Opening Day, the Oyler Fan Club went wild. "He got cheers, 
horns blew, confetti filled the air in his first time at bat." In April 
1969, Jim Campanis of the Kansas City Royals punched Oyler during a game. 
The Ray Oyler Fan Club sent a telegram to Royals general manager Cedric 
Tallis, protesting Campanis' actions and saying: "Please do not misinterpret 
our motto 'Sock it to Ray Oyler', as this is an expression of encouragement." 
The Oyler Fan Club also developed and sang songs, such as "Hey Ray Oyler 
yer Bat's Too Small." [7] Former fan club members still boast that Oyler 
holds the all-time Pilots records for assists, putouts, and home runs by 
a shortstop (the Pilots played only one year, and Oyler was their shortstop). 
In Ball Four, Seattle teammate Jim Bouton wrote that Oyler's nickname was 
"Oil Can Harry" because "he always looks as though he had just changed 
a set of rings." Oyler hit a career-high seven home runs for the Pilots 
in 1969, and increased his batting average to .165. In December 1969, Oyler 
was traded to the Oakland A's with pitcher Diego Segui for infielder Ted 
Kubiak and pitcher George Lauzerique. Oyler was sold by Oakland in April 
1970 and played his final 24 games with the California Angels, with a perfect 
fielding percentage and a .083 average at the plate. After his major league 
career ended, Oyler was a player-coach for the Hawaii Islanders and Salt 
Lake City teams of the Pacific Coast League before retiring in 1973.[8] 
After Oyler retired from baseball, he settled in the Seattle area, working 
for the Safeway supermarket chain,[8][9] managing a bowling alley in Bellevue, 
Washington and working at Boeing.[10] Oyler played slowpitch softball in 
Seattle from 1973-1980[11] and also occasionally pitched batting practice 
for the Tigers when they were in Seattle playing the Mariners.[12] He suffered 
a heart attack at his Redmond, Washington home on January 26, 1981, and 
died at the age of 42. He is buried in an unmarked grave at Sunset Hills 
Memorial Park, Bellevue. In a May 2007 article, Oyler's former Detroit 
roommate, Denny McLain, claimed that Oyler was "an alcoholic" who "died 
prematurely."[13] One of the authoritative histories of the team also reports 
that many of the 1968 Tigers drank "a lot," that Oyler was "later in AA"
