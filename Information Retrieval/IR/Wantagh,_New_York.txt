Wantagh (/ˈwɒntɔː/ WAHN-taw) is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) 
in the Town of Hempstead in Nassau County on Long Island, New York, United 
States. The population of Wantagh was 18,871 at the time of the 2010 census. 
Wantagh is known as "The Gateway to Jones Beach".[3] The Wantagh area was 
inhabited by the Merokee (or Merikoke) tribe of the Metoac Indians prior 
to the first wave of European settlement in the mid-17th century. The Merokee 
were part of the greater Montauk tribe that loosely ruled Long Island's 
Native Americans. Wantagh was the sachem (chief) of the Merokee tribe in 
1647,[4] and was later the grand sachem of the Montauk tribe from 1651-1658. 
The Dutch settlers came east from their New Amsterdam colony, and English 
settlers came south from Connecticut and Massachusetts settlements. When 
the English and Dutch settled their competing claims to Long Island in 
the 1650 treaty conducted in Hartford, the Dutch partition included all 
lands west of Oyster Bay and thus the Wantagh area. Long Island then was 
ceded to the Duke of York in 1663-64, but then fell back into Dutch hands 
after the Dutch regained New York in 1673. The Treaty of Westminster in 
1674 settled the land claims once and for all, incorporating Long Island 
into the now-British colony of New York.[5] Wantagh was originally known 
as "Jerusalem", although some early accounts do refer to the area as "Wantagh". 
The creek running north/south through Wantagh, and which has been covered 
up in many places but is still visible between the Wantagh Parkway and 
the housing developments west of Wantagh Avenue, was originally the Jerusalem 
River. The original post office was built in 1837, for Jerusalem, but mail 
service from Brooklyn began around 1780. The town's first school was established 
in 1790.[6] At some time around the 1880s, Jerusalem was renamed Ridgewood, 
and the town's original LIRR station was named "Ridgewood Station". Later, 
Ridgewood was renamed Wantagh to avoid confusion with another town in New 
York State with the same name. George Washington rode through Jerusalem 
on April 21, 1790, as part of his 5-day tour of Long Island. The Daughters 
of the American Revolution have placed a plaque on Hempstead Turnpike to 
commemorate Washington's travels, which took him from Hempstead on Jerusalem 
Road (now North Jerusalem Road) to Jerusalem, on to Merrick Road. He then 
went on to head east, then circle back west on the north shore. During 
the Revolutionary War, British ships traveled up Jones inlet and came ashore 
to raid Jerusalem farms.[7] The oldest original settlers of the Wantagh/Jerusalem 
area were the Jackson and Seaman families, and their marks are still visible 
today. For example, the Cherrywood shopping center (at the corner of Jerusalem 
and Wantagh avenues) was the site of prominent settler Capt. John Seaman's 
estate, which was named Cherrywood. Wantagh is home to a number of New 
York State Historical Markers (9 of Nassau County's 25),[8] including: 
The Samuel and Elbert Jackson House was listed on the National Register 
of Historic Places in 2006.[9] The oldest cemetery in Wantagh is the Jackson 
Cemetery, located just north of the St. Frances de Chantal Roman Catholic 
Church on Wantagh Avenue.[10] There are 63 confirmed graves that include 
descendants from the Seaman and Jackson families, with the most notable 
including Thomas Jackson, who served in the Revolutionary War in the Second 
New York Regiment and participated in the Battle of Long Island and the 
storming of Fort St. George under Major Talmadge in 1780, and who was the 
original landowner of the site of land around the Wantagh Public Library; 
and General Jacob Seaman Jackson, a brigadier general in the War of 1812 
and senior warden of Long Island's first chartered Masonic lodge in 1797. 
The Rierson burial plot was located in what has been redeveloped into Bunker 
Avenue. This cemetery includes members of the Rierson family who were Loyalists 
during the Revolutionary War.[11] The Jerusalem Society of Friends Cemetery 
is located behind (east of) the current Christian Tabernacle Church. The 
Society of Friends were Quakers who maintained meeting houses in Jericho, 
Bethpage, and Hempstead, and met in then-Jerusalem as early as 1697. Capt. 
John Seaman allowed the Society to conduct meetings on his land in 1699, 
but the congregation later traveled to Bethpage to worship. The Jerusalem 
Society of Friends purchased land from another Seaman, Arden Seaman, and 
then constructed their own meeting house on the site of the current Christian 
Tabernacle Church in 1827, and added the cemetery in 1861. By the 1940s, 
the congregation had dwindled significantly, and the property was sold 
in 1952 to the newly formed Wantagh Baptist Church and then recently sold 
to the newly formed Christian Tabernacle Church in 2007. The cemetery contains 
the graves of three Civil War veterans: Lt. H.R. Jackson, Gilbert Seaman, 
of the 139th Regiment of NY Volunteers, and Charles Wilson, of the 119th 
Regiment of NY Volunteers and who was wounded in Gettysburg.[12] The St. 
John of Jerusalem Cemetery served the German Methodists, who moved to Jerusalem 
from New York City around 1850 to farm. The cemetery can be found west 
of Wantagh Avenue a few hundred yards north of North Jerusalem Road (now 
North Wantagh). The congregation began to meet in 1854 and held services 
entirely in German. The cemetery was constructed in 1862 and was intended 
only for use by congregation members and their families. Later generations 
of congregants grew weary of the services in German, and numbers dwindled 
until the last German service was held in 1911. From 1912 to 1926, the 
church remained unused. The church has since been used by a local Lutheran 
congregation from 1926 to 1940, and a United Christian congregation from 
1949 to 1969. Since then, however, the church has remained unused, although 
the cemetery has been fenced in and maintained by a Board of Trustees. 
The cemetery contains graves of veterans from the Civil War, Spanish–American 
War, World War I, World War II, and Vietnam.[13] The area that became today's 
Wantagh continued primarily as a farming area until the construction of 
Sunrise Highway and Jones Beach in the early 20th century, when tourism 
and fishing took hold, centering on Jones Beach. The Long Island Rail Road 
has served the town since 1885 (and possibly as early as 1867), but the 
town did not take on a suburban character until the housing development 
between the 1950s and 1970s. The LIRR tracks were completely elevated in 
1968, along with neighboring Seaford station. The Wantagh Railroad Complex 
was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[9] Wantagh 
is located at 40°40′29″N 73°30′38″W﻿ / ﻿40.67472°N 73.51056°W﻿ / 40.67472;

the Nassau County Auxiliary Police since 1952. These volunteer police officers 
perform routine patrols of the neighborhood and provide traffic control 
for local parades, races and other community events. These officers have 
completed a 44 week training course at the Nassau County Police Academy 
and are registered with New York State as Peace Officers. Auxiliary Police 
officers can make arrests for crimes that occur in their presence and for 
crimes that weren't committed in their presence based on information from 
a dispatcher or police officer heard over a police radio or from a police 
officer in person. This authority was established by the New York Court 
of Appeals in the case of People v. Rosario, 78 N.Y.2d 583, 585 N.E.2d 
766, 578 N.Y.S.2d 454 (1991). Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training 
is also made available. This unit is represented by the New York State 
Association of Auxiliary Police - Region One. Wantagh is protected by a 
volunteer fire department that is responsible for one of the largest fire 
districts in Nassau County covering 12 square miles (31 km2). The Wantagh 
Fire Department has approximately 250 members using 20 pieces of apparatus 
located throughout seven stations, two of which are administrative and 
training locations. Jones Beach State Park is located within the department's 
jurisdiction. During large gatherings the WFD deploys various apparatus 
and its new mobile command center. The Wantagh-Levittown Volunteer Ambulance 
Corps has been serving the community since 1956, and the all-volunteer 
paramedic and EMT unit is located at 3702 Hempstead Turnpike, Levittown. 
The Wantagh Public Library, at 3285 Park Avenue, holds events throughout 
the year for community members, children, teens, and seniors, and displays 
local artwork and collections. The Wantagh Museum of the Wantagh Preservation 
Society displays Wantagh's original Long Island Rail Road Stationhouse, 
the "Jamaica" (an original 1912 LIRR car), and the original Wantagh Post 
Office building. Wantagh is known throughout Long Island to have a very 
energetic and vibrant nightlife. Centered on the Wantagh Long Island Rail 
Road Station there are thirteen bars, pubs and clubs all within a quarter
