James Bernard Williams (May 15, 1926 – June 6, 2016) was a Canadian outfielder, 
coach and manager in minor league baseball and coach in Major League Baseball. 
Williams threw and batted right-handed, stood 5'10" (178 cm) tall and weighed 
180 pounds (82 kg). He is a member of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Williams graduated from Toronto's De La Salle College School, where he 
played varsity baseball, hockey (as a right wing), football and lacrosse. 
He played in the farm system of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers in 1947–64. 
Although he never was called to the majors as a player, Williams enjoyed 
several highly productive seasons. In his first year as a professional, 
split between three Dodger farm teams in the lower minors, Williams batted 
a composite .367 with 15 triples, 121 runs batted in, 24 stolen bases and 
12 home runs. He played three seasons (1955–57) of Triple-A baseball in 
his native Canada with the Montreal Royals of the International League, 
batting .329 in 1955 with 93 runs scored, 33 doubles, eight triples, 13 
homers, and 21 stolen bases, and also exceeded the .300 mark with the 1958 
Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League. His playing got him noticed 
by the minor leagues, and he went on to enjoy a lengthy career as a manager 
in minor league baseball in 1963–80, where he compiled a record of 1,155 
wins and 1,156 defeats (.499). His seventeen years of managing in the minors 
was interrupted by a brief period of coaching with the Major-League Houston 
Astros for a season in 1975. His most significant achievement was his coaching 
tenure with the Baltimore Orioles (1981–87), a run that included their 
historic 1983 World Series win. Williams then followed former Baltimore 
general manager Hank Peters to the Cleveland Indians, where Williams served 
as director of field operations for the club's farm system. He should not 
be confused with James Francis "Jimy" Williams (born 1943), also a former 
minor league skipper and Major League coach and former manager of the Houston 
Astros, Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox. Williams met his first wife, 
Lorraine (née) Elliott while playing for the Pueblo Dodgers in 1949, with 
whom he had three children, Chris, Kirk and Jultie. When he was not playing 
Winterball in Caracas, San Juan or Havana they made their home in Pueblo, 
Colorado. He was very handy with tools, worked construction (building houses), 
and was frequently adding rooms or moving walls in their home. In 1988 
he married Carole (née) Garrett, of Baltimore, and continued his home-improvement 
work in the off season; Their wedding date is inscribed on the front porch 
of their home in Joppa, Maryland. Williams died June 6, 2016 in Baltimore.
