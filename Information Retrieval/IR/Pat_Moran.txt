As player As manager Patrick Joseph Moran (February 7, 1876 – March 7, 
1924) was an American catcher and manager in Major League Baseball. As 
a manager, he led two teams to their first-ever modern-era National League 
championships: the 1915 Philadelphia Phillies and the 1919 Cincinnati Reds. 
Moran's 1919 Reds also captured their first World Series championship. 
A native of Fitchburg, Massachusetts,[1] Moran played 819 games over 14 
National League seasons for the Boston Beaneaters (1901–05), Chicago Cubs 
(1906–09) and Phillies (1910–14). A right-handed hitter, he batted .235 
with 18 home runs. In 1903, he finished tied for second in the league in 
home runs with seven. After 1904 he did not appear in more than 100 games 
in a season. However, as a second-string catcher, Moran became a student 
of the game and especially of pitching. In 1913–1914, he was a player-coach 
and, guided by his support and counsel, Phillies right-hander Grover Cleveland 
Alexander developed into one of the greatest pitchers of all time. Moran 
retired as a player after the 1914 season, and was immediately promoted 
to manager of the Phillies. The club had finished sixth in 1914 and was 
plagued by defections (and threatened defections) to the outlaw Federal 
League. Moran swung some astute trades and — led by Alexander's 31 wins 
and the slugging of right fielder Gavvy Cravath — the Phils improved by 
17 games and won their first NL pennant. In the 1915 World Series, they 
were defeated four games to one by the Boston Red Sox. The Phillies then 
finished second in successive years, to the Brooklyn Robins in 1916 and 
the New York Giants in 1917. With baseball disrupted by World War I (and 
with the December 11, 1917, trade of Alexander to the Cubs) the Phillies 
sank below .500 in 1918 and Moran was fired. Moran was not unemployed for 
long, however. Cincinnati Reds manager Christy Mathewson, the former pitching 
great, had been stricken with tuberculosis from exposure to poison gas 
during military maneuvers. When it was apparent that Mathewson was too 
sick to return for the 1919 season, Moran was named his successor. The 
Reds had finished third, 15½ games behind, in 1918. Under Moran, they won 
96 of 140 games in an abbreviated 1919 schedule to take the flag by nine 
games. They then defeated the Chicago White Sox in the 1919 World Series 
five games to three to win Cincinnati's first undisputed world championship. 
This should have been Moran's crowning accomplishment. But when it was 
charged that eight key members of the White Sox had conspired with gamblers 
to "throw" the series — the infamous Black Sox Scandal — the Reds' achievement 
was somehow tarnished. (The eight White Sox players were acquitted in a 
controversial 1920 trial but were nonetheless expelled from baseball.) 
In the wake of the scandal, Moran, his players and many baseball experts 
would furiously assert that Cincinnati would have won the series under 
any circumstances. Moran remained at the helm in Cincinnati during the 
early 1920s. Apart from a poor 1921 campaign, the Reds fielded contending 
ballclubs but did not return to the World Series. The club finished second 
in both 1922 and 1923. While spending the winter of 1923–24 at his Fitchburg 
home, Moran was taken ill. He was able to report to the Reds' training 
camp in Orlando, Florida, but his condition worsened and he died there 
at the age of 48. The cause of death was listed as Bright's Disease, a 
kidney ailment, but some baseball historians ascribe Moran's fatal illness 
to alcoholism. Moran won 748 games and lost 586 (.561) as a National League 
manager over nine seasons. He won six and lost seven World Series games.
