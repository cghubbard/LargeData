The Quincy Hawks are the athletic teams that represent Quincy University, 
located in Quincy, Illinois, in NCAA Division II intercollegiate sports. 
The Hawks compete as members of the West Division of the Great Lakes Valley 
Conference for all sports except men's volleyball, which is a member of 
the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. Since there is no 
men's volleyball at the Division II level, the men's volleyball team is 
the only program that plays at the Division I level. QU joined the GLVC 
in 1994. Quincy will add women's lacrosse in 2017 and men's lacrosse in 
2018, bringing the total number of programs up to 20.[1] Men's sports (9) 
Women's sports (9) Prior to joining the NCAA, Quincy's women won the NAIA 
national softball championship in 1985 (after being runners-up the previous 
year). The men's soccer team won the NAIA national men's soccer championship 
a record eleven times, 1966-67, 1971, 1973-75, and 1977-81 (the five consecutive 
titles is also a record) and finished second in 1968 and 1970. The program 
moved to the NCAA's Division I in 1984. From 1987 through 1990, the Hawks 
competed in the Big Central Soccer Conference and was an associate member 
of the Mid-Continent Conference in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, both Quincy 
and SIU Edwardsville joined the GLVC, stepping down to division II.[2]
