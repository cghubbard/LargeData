Ogden /ˈɒɡdɛn/ is a city and the county seat of Weber County,[4] Utah, 
United States, approximately 10 miles (16 km) east of the Great Salt Lake 
and 40 miles (64 km) north of Salt Lake City. The population was 84,316 
in 2014, according to the US Census Bureau.[5] The city served as a major 
railway hub through much of its history,[6] and still handles a great deal 
of freight rail traffic which makes it a convenient location for manufacturing 
and commerce. Ogden is also known for its many historic buildings, proximity 
to the Wasatch Mountains, and as the location of Weber State University. 
Ogden is a principal city of the Ogden–Clearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical 
Area, which includes all of Weber, Morgan, Davis, and Box Elder counties. 
The 2010 Census placed the Metro population at 597,159.[7] In 2010, Forbes 
rated the Ogden-Clearfield MSA as the 6th best place to raise a family.[8] 
Ogden has had a Sister City relationship to Hof (Germany) since 1954. Originally 
named Fort Buenaventura, the city of Ogden was the first permanent settlement 
by people of European descent in the region that is now Utah. It was established 
by the trapper Miles Goodyear in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown 
Ogden is currently located. In November 1847, Fort Buenaventura was purchased 
by the Mormon settlers for $1,950.[citation needed] The settlement was 
then called Brownsville, after Captain James Brown, but was later named 
Ogden for a brigade leader of the Hudson's Bay Company, Peter Skene Ogden, 
who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. The site of the 
original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park. Ogden is the closest 
sizable city to the Golden Spike location at Promontory Summit, Utah, where 
the First Transcontinental Railroad was joined in 1869. Ogden was known 
as a major passenger railroad junction owing to its location along major 
east-west and north-south routes, prompting the local chamber of commerce 
to adopt the motto, "You can't get anywhere without coming to Ogden."[9] 
Railroad passengers traveling west to San Francisco from the eastern United 
States typically passed through Ogden (and not through the larger Salt 
Lake City to the south). Ogden, however, is no longer served by Amtrak, 
the national passenger rail system, and passengers desiring to travel from 
Ogden by rail must travel via FrontRunner commuter rail to Salt Lake City 
and Provo. In 1972, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints completed 
construction of and dedicated the Ogden Utah Temple in Ogden. The temple 
was built to serve the large LDS population in the area. In 2010, the LDS 
Church announced a major renovation of the Ogden Temple and the adjacent 
Tabernacle. The work, which began in 2011, includes completely changing 
the dated 1970's exterior, removing the steeple from the Tabernacle so 
as to make the Temple's steeple a main focus, as well as a new underground 
parking garage and gardens.[10] The Temple was rededicated in 2014.[11] 
Because Ogden has historically been the second largest city in Utah, it 
is home to a large number of historic buildings. However, by the 1980s, 
several Salt Lake City suburbs and Provo had surpassed Ogden in population. 
The Defense Depot Ogden Utah operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some 
of its 1,128 acres (456 ha) has since been converted into a commercial 
and industrial park called the Business Depot Ogden. Ogden is located at 
41°13′11″N 111°58′16″W﻿ / ﻿41.2196°N 111.9712°W﻿ / 41.2196; -111.9712 (41.2196,

United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 26.6 square miles 
(69.0 km2), all land. Elevations in the city range from about 4,300 to 
5,200 feet (1,300 to 1,600 m) above sea level. The Ogden and Weber Rivers, 
which originate in the mountains to the east, flow through the city and 
meet at a confluence just west of the city limits. Pineview Dam is located 
in the Ogden River Canyon 7 miles (11 km) east of Ogden. The reservoir 
behind the dam provides over 110,000 acre feet (140,000,000 m3) of water 
storage and water recreation for the area. Prominent mountain peaks near 
Ogden include Mount Ogden to the east and Ben Lomond to the north. Ogden

under the mayor-council form of government, in which the full-time mayor 
serves as executive while the seven-member part-time council serves as 
the legislative branch. All of these elected officials serve four-year 
terms, with elections occurring in odd-numbered years and terms beginning 
in January of even-numbered years. The current mayor is Mike Caldwell, 
who took office in January 2012. The current city council members are Neil 
Garner, chair, Bart Blair, vice chair, Caitlin Gochnour, Susie Van Hooser, 
Amy Wicks, Doug Stephens, and Richard Hyer. Four of the council members 
represent the city's four municipal wards, while the other three (Blair, 
Van Hooser, and Wicks) are elected at-large by voters from the entire city. 
The Ogden City government operates on a budget of $100 million per year 
and employs nearly 600 full-time workers.[17] In addition to providing 
the usual municipal services, the government actively engages in promoting 
business and economic development. The city operates a redevelopment agency 
(RDA),with the city council acting as the RDA governing board and the mayor 
as its executive director. The RDA's activity has steadily increased since 
its establishment in 1969, with tax increment revenues currently at about 
$10 million per year and an outstanding debt of over $50 million. Nearly 
all of Ogden's central business district is now covered by designated redevelopment 
districts, as are Business Depot Ogden and several other industrial areas 
in the western parts of the city. Much of the recent political discourse 
in Ogden has focused on controversial government-sponsored development 
projects in the downtown area, including the Ogden Eccles Conference Center, 
Lindquist Field, The Junction, the Ogden River Project,[18] and other proposals 
that have not moved forward.[19][20] A proposed streetcar connecting downtown 
to Weber State University has attracted considerable attention but only 
limited support.[21] A major controversy flared up in 2005–07 when the 
mayor and many others pushed unsuccessfully for construction of a luxury 
residential development on public land in Ogden's foothills and a new ski 
resort in the mountains above the city, to be accessed by a pair of aerial 
gondolas.[22] Other local political concerns include Ogden’s relatively 
high tax[23] and utility[24] rates, efforts to fight crime,[25] allegations 
of government corruption,[26][27] and challenges facing the Ogden City 
schools.[28][29] Ogden held its first LGBT Pride festival in 2015 at the 
Ogden City amphitheater. The pride attracted over forty corporate and small 
business, various local performers, and food vendors. [30][31] As the principal 
city of the 2nd largest MSA in Utah, Ogden serves as an economic hub for 
the northern part of the state. Much of the central city is occupied by 
offices of various federal, state, county, and municipal government entities. 
The Internal Revenue Service has a large regional facility in Ogden and 
is the city's largest employer with over 5,000 employees.[32] Other large 
employers include McKay Dee Hospital, Weber State University, Ogden City 
School District, Autoliv, Fresenius, and Convergys.[33] In 2013, Ogden 
ranked No. 16 on Forbes' list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.[34] 
Several industrial areas are found in the western parts of the city. The 
largest of these is Business Depot Ogden, a former Army depot that was 
restructured to be a 1,000-plus acre business park.[35] Interstates 15 
and 84 serve the city. I-84 runs east-west through the southern suburbs, 
merging with I-15 near Riverdale. I-15 runs north-south near the city's 
western edge and provides connections to the rest of the Wasatch Front 
and beyond. Ogden is served directly by exits 341, 342, 343, and 344. US-89 
enters the city from the south, running through the city as Washington 
Boulevard, which serves as the main street of Ogden. It then continues 
north to Brigham City. State Route 39 runs east-west through the city as 
12th Street, and continues eastward through Ogden Canyon providing access 
to Pineview Reservoir and the mountain and ski resort town of Huntsville. 
The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates four bus routes directly between 
Salt Lake City and Ogden, as well as numerous others that serve Weber and 
northern Davis counties that connect into either the Ogden Intermodal Hub 
on the west edge of town or to Weber State University. Ogden is also the 
source of the two routes that serve Brigham City, the northernmost extension 
of UTA's bus system. It also has a Greyhound bus stop along a line that 
runs north-south along I-15. The FrontRunner commuter rail is now open 
and runs between Salt Lake City and Pleasant View, just north of Ogden, 
and includes a stop at the Ogden Intermodal Hub. This line opened for service 
on April 26, 2008. Amtrak service is provided with a bus connection running 
to/from Salt Lake City. Amtrak trains do not serve Ogden directly. Ogden-Hinckley 
Airport, Utah's busiest municipal airport, is located in the southwest 
portion of the city. Allegiant Air offers commercial service from Ogden 
to Phoenix and Mesa, AZ. Utah Airways offers charter service to many of 
the West’s national parks.[37] The mountains and rivers near Ogden offer 
diverse opportunities for outdoor recreation. An extensive trail system, 
immediately adjacent to the city's eastern edge, gives residents and visitors 
immediate access to the foothills of the Wasatch Range. The foothill trails 
are used for hiking, running, mountain biking, and sometimes snowshoeing 
and cross-country skiing. Steeper trails climb eastward into the mountains, 
and many other mountain trails originate within a few miles of the city. 
A system of paved urban trails runs along the banks of the Ogden and Weber 
Rivers.[38] The quartzite cliffs above Ogden's foothills provide a variety 
of rock climbing routes. An extensive boulder field in the foothills is 
one of the most popular bouldering sites in the state. On the mountains 
east of Ogden are three downhill ski areas: Snowbasin, Powder Mountain, 
and Wolf Mountain. Popular sites for cross-country skiing include Snowbasin 
and Weber County's North Fork Park. Kayaking is a popular sport on portions 
of the Ogden and Weber Rivers. A developed kayak park lies on the Weber 
River in the western portion of the city. The reservoirs near Ogden are 
used for a wide variety of water sports. Ogden is also home to the minor 
league baseball team Ogden Raptors of the Pioneer League, the Women's Flat 
Track Derby Association league Junction City Roller Dolls, the minor-league 
soccer team Ogden Outlaws of the Premier Development League and the Ogden 
Knights of the American Indoor Football Association. Ogden Stadium houses 
the annual "Hot Rocking 4th", a motorsports event. There are several golf 
courses located in the city of Ogden.[39] Weber State University fields 
several intercollegiate athletic teams that attract spectators from among 
local residents. The university is especially known for its basketball 
team. Ogden is a satellite venue of the Sundance Film Festival. A local 
film festival, now called the Foursite Film Festival, has been held annually 
since 2004. Other events of interest include a downtown farmer's market, 
the Ogden Arts Festival, the Harvest Moon Festival, Ogden Winterfest and 
the Ogden Marathon.[40] Ogden has had two shopping malls. Newgate Mall 
was built in 1981, and Ogden City Mall a year prior. The latter was torn 
down and redeveloped as The Junction. Two ships in the United States Navy 
have been named after the City of Ogden; the first, USS Ogden (PF-39), 
in 1943, and the second, USS Ogden (LPD-5), in 1964. Ogden was the site 
of the infamous Hi-Fi murders in 1974. Flying J, the largest retailer of 
diesel fuel in North America, has its corporate headquarters in Ogden. 
In 2009, Ogden ranked No. 5 on Newsmax magazine's list of the "Top 25 Most 
Uniquely American Cities and Towns," a piece written by current CBS News 
travel editor Peter Greenberg. According to the magazine, Greenberg based 
the rankings on a variety of features, such as quality of schools and proximity 
to medical care, as well as culture, hospitality, and scenic beauty.[41]
