Roy Hilton White (born December 27, 1943) is an American former professional 
baseball player and coach.[1] He played his entire career in Major League 
Baseball as an outfielder for the New York Yankees between 1965 and 1979. 
With the Yankees, he won two championships in 1977 and '78, both over his 
hometown Los Angeles Dodgers. White, a switch hitter, was named to 2 All 
Star teams in 1969 and in 1970. In 1971, he set an American League record 
for most sacrifice flies in a season with 17.[2] White led the American 
League in walks in 1972 and in runs in 1976. He played on two World Series 
championship teams, in 1977 and 1978 and a third American League pennant 
winner in 1976. In a 15-year major league career, White played in 1,881 
games, accumulating 1,803 hits in 6,650 at bats for a .271 career batting 
average along with 160Â home runs, 758 runs batted in and a .360 on-base 
percentage.[1] He ended his career with a .988 fielding percentage. An 
excellent defensive player, White led American League left fielders in 
fielding percentage for four consecutive years between 1968 and 1971.[1] 
After retiring from the major leagues in 1979, he spent three seasons playing 
in Japan for the Tokyo Giants. He served as a Yankee coach for three seasons 
in the mid-1980s before returning to the coaching staff at the start of 
2004. He also spent time as the minor league hitting coach for the Oakland 
A's. In 2002,[3] he established The Roy White Foundation, a charity aimed 
to help children and young adults in the New York area who would like to 
attend college, but do not have the financial resources to do so. White, 
who is African American, resurfaced in a 2011 interview for UniWatch on 
Page 2 of ESPN.com about his time with the Yankees Double-A during the 
mid-1960s, the Columbus Confederate Yankees, since the team had a patch 
of the Confederate flag on the team's uniforms at the height of the civil 
rights movement. White himself commented that he didn't notice the patch 
at the time nor paid attention to its symbolism, having to deal with actual
