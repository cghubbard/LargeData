Chan Ho Park (Korean: 박찬호; born June 30, 1973) is a South Korean former 
professional baseball pitcher. He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Texas 
Rangers, San Diego Padres, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, New York 
Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball, Orix Buffaloes of 
Nippon Professional Baseball and Hanwha Eagles of Korea Baseball Organization. 
He was the first South Korean-born player in major league history. Park 
has the most career wins, 124, of any Asian-born pitcher in history. He 
passed Hideo Nomo for the most ever by an Asian-born pitcher in 2010. He 
is 6'2" (188 cm) tall and weighs 210 lbs (95 kg).[1] Chan Ho Park was born 
in Gongju, South Korea, on June 30, 1973. As a high school player in South 
Korea, he won team Most Valuable Player honors three consecutive seasons 
at Gongju High School in Gongju, South Korea. He also was named the MVP 
at four national prep tournaments. Park was a member of the 1992 and 1993 
South Korea national baseball team. He posted a 2.76 ERA in helping South 
Korea earn the silver medal at the Asian Baseball Championship in 1993. 
He also competed in 1993 Summer Universiade , and led his team to the silver 
medal. Park was a sophomore at Hanyang University, Seoul in 1994 when he 
was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. Park made 
his professional debut for the Dodgers on April 8, 1994 against the Atlanta 
Braves as a reliever, working one inning (a game in which the Dodgers were 
no-hit by the Braves' Kent Mercker). Park played in one additional game 
for the Dodgers that season and then spent the bulk of the season with 
the Class AA San Antonio Missions, finishing with a 5–7 record and a 3.55 
ERA for the Missions in 20 starts with 100 strikeouts. With the Albuquerque 
Dukes in 1995 he was fourth in the Pacific Coast League in strikeouts with 
101, and averaged 8.26 strikeouts per 9 innings, the top mark among all 
Class AAA pitchers. He was selected by Baseball America as the 2nd best 
Dodgers prospect after the season with the best fastball in the PCL. He 
recorded his first Major League start on October 1 against the San Diego 
Padres after receiving a September call-up. In 1996, his first full season 
with the Dodgers, he went 5–5 with a 3.64 ERA in 48 games (10 starts). 
He recorded his first win on April 6 against the Chicago Cubs. Park had 
a breakout season in 1997 as he became a full-time starter. He tied for 
the team lead in victories, while posting a 14–8 record and a 3.38 ERA 
in 32 appearances, 29 of them starts. In 1998, he was 15–9 with a 3.71 
ERA in 34 starts and struck out 191 batters in 220.2 innings. After the 
season, he led the South Korean national team to the gold medal in the 
Asian Games, beating Japan in the final match. In 1999, he struggled in 
the rotation with 13–11 with a 5.23 ERA. On April 23, 1999 he became the 
only pitcher in the history of baseball to allow two grand slams in the 
same inning and to the same player, Fernando Tatís of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
There are two more pitchers in the history of baseball who allowed two 
grand slams in the same game – Jack Morris, and more recently, Brandon 
Backe – but to different hitters in different innings. He also walked 100 
batters in only 194 innings. On June 5, 1999, Park was involved in an on-field 
brawl at Dodger Stadium with Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher. Park attacked 
Belcher after being tagged out after a bunt play. Park's said that Belcher 
had tagged him too hard on the just-concluded play and asked him about 
the incident. According to Park, Belcher replied with racist comments causing 
Park to kick him.[2] In 2000, he ranked second in strikeouts with 217, 
second in opposing batting average (.214), and lowest in allowed hits per 
nine innings.[3] despite second in allowing bases on balls (124) in the 
National League. He finished the season 18–10 with a 3.27 ERA, the best 
totals of his entire career. He also tossed his first career complete game 
shutout on September 29, against the San Diego Padres. Park was also named 
the Dodgers opening day starter for the 2001 season and tossed the Dodgers 
first season opening shutout since 1981. He was 15–11 with a 3.50 ERA during 
the season and was selected to appear in the 2001 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, where he pitched one inning, allowed a home run to Cal Ripken, 
Jr. and was charged with the loss. Park gave up Barry Bonds' record-breaking 
71st and 72nd homers on October 5 against the San Francisco Giants. Park 
was granted free agency after the season and was signed by the Texas Rangers 
in December of that year to a five-year, $65 million contract, which was 
one of the largest contracts for a pitcher at that time. However, during 
his time with the Rangers, he was hampered by injuries and a home stadium 
that favors hitters at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. In his first season 
with the Rangers, Park went 9–8 in 25 starts, with a 5.75 ERA. The following 
season, he only started seven times due to injuries, going 1–3 with a 7.58 
ERA. On July 29, 2005, he was traded by the Rangers to the San Diego Padres 
in exchange for Phil Nevin. Padres fans had hoped that Park could repeat 
his previous success by playing in pitcher-friendly Petco Park. In the 
2005 season, his combined record was 12-8, despite a 5.74 ERA. In the 2006 
season, Park was reunited with his former Texas Rangers teammate and friend 
Chris Young, who was traded to the Padres in exchange for Akinori Otsuka. 
Park started the season as a reliever but soon he became a starter. On 
July 31, he suffered from intestinal bleeding and was placed on the disabled 
list. Several of his teammates, including Jake Peavy, Woody Williams, Chris 
Young, and Alan Embree, offered to donate their blood, but Park graciously 
refused their offer, as they were vital members of the team. Park accepted 
blood transfusions, that came, in part, from Jake Peavy's wife Katie and 
Kelly Calabrese, Padres' team massage therapist. However, Park's recovery 
did not last long as he suffered from another episode of intestinal bleeding 
on August 21. He was hospitalized again, this time along with his wife 
Rie, who was about to deliver their first child.[4] A very thorough medical 
examination revealed that Park was suffering from a congenital defect called 
Meckel's diverticulum. Park had a successful surgery and only six days 
later his wife delivered a healthy baby daughter at the same hospital.[5] 
The San Diego Padres advanced to the post-season and Park joined the post-season 
roster. On October 3, 2006, Park made his first career post-season appearance 
in Game 1 of the National League Division Series against the St. Louis 
Cardinals as a reliever. He also had career-high season batting average 
of .268 from 41 at bats. On February 8, 2007, the Yonhap news agency and 
New York Daily News reported that Park had signed a one-year, $3 million 
contract with the New York Mets and would report to the Mets' spring training 
facility in Port St. Lucie, Florida to compete for a starting rotation 
spot. The Mets sent him down to Triple-A New Orleans following his poor 
spring performance.[6][7][8] On April 30, 2007, Park was called up from 
Triple-A New Orleans to start for the injured Orlando Hernández. In that 
sole game, he gave up 7 earned runs in 4 innings.[9] On May 3, 2007, Park 
was sent back down to Triple-A New Orleans. He was designated for assignment 
on June 4, 2007.[citation needed] On June 12, 2007, he signed a minor league 
deal with the Houston Astros. Astros Manager Phil Garner said "Park will 
have a few starts at Triple-A Round Rock before the Astros decide whether 
to call him up." Park compiled a 2–10 record over 15 starts with Round 
Rock, failing to earn a spot on the Astros' 40-man roster. On November 
8, 2007, Park accepted an offer from his original team, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, to attend spring training as a non-roster invitee. On November 
28, 2007, Park asked to be let go by the Dodgers to play for the Korean 
team. After pitching with no health issues for the Korean National team, 
the contract was finalized on December 6, 2007. Despite being considered 
a long shot for the fifth starter's role, Park pitched very well, but was 
ultimately passed over for right-hander Esteban Loaiza. He was eventually 
reassigned to the minor leagues on March 30, 2008. Faced with the problem 
of a fatigued and depleted pitching staff three games later, the Dodgers 
purchased Park's minor league contract on April 2, 2008.[10] On May 17, 
2008, Park made his first start as a Dodger since 2001 against Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. He allowed two runs (one earned run) in four innings 
with no decision. This game turned out to be a historic one as for the 
first time in MLB history, all three Dodgers pitchers who pitched in this 
game (Park, Hong-Chih Kuo, and Takashi Saito) were of Asian origin. The 
Dodgers won it 6–3.[11] On June 21, 2008, Park started against the Cleveland 
Indians at the Dodger Stadium[12] and joined Kevin Brown, Al Leiter, Javier 
Vázquez, and Jamie Moyer as the only pitchers to start a game against all 
30 Major League teams.[13] In addition to making history, he had a decent 
outing, with 9 strikeouts in 5 innings pitched, although this was overshadowed 
when he gave up a solo home run to Cleveland Indians pitcher CC Sabathia. 
After Takashi Saito's elbow injury, Park was moved back to the bullpen 
by manager Joe Torre. Jonathan Broxton was promoted to the closer role 
and Park and Hong-Chih Kuo to the setup man platoon. On January 6, Park 
signed a one-year, incentive-laden, $2.5 million contract with the Philadelphia 
Phillies.[14] On March 31, Phillies GM Rubén Amaro, Jr. announced that 
Chan Ho Park had won the fifth starter job.[15] However, with several poor 
starts (7 starts with a 7.29 ERA), Park was moved to the bullpen and was 
replaced in the rotation by J. A. Happ. The problem with Park as a starter 
was that he was sacrificing velocity and movement for the energy to go 
deeper in games. After moving to the pen, his four-seam fastball velocity 
returned to normal (topped out at 95-96 mph), with movement on his two-seam 
fastball and slider. Park played a vital role in the Phillies' bullpen 
with a 2.52 ERA. After missing time with a hamstring injury, Park made 
his return to the Phillies in the playoffs. With the Phillies, he advanced 
to his first World Series, in which he pitched well, giving up no runs 
in Philadelphia's loss to the New York Yankees. He became a free agent 
after the season. In December 2009 it was announced that Chan Ho Park was 
suing his former Dodger teammate Chad Kreuter in Los Angeles Superior Court, 
in which he claimed Kreuter breached repayment of a $460,000 promissory 
note issued in October 2005.[16] On February 28, 2010, Park signed a one-year 
contract worth $1.2 million with $300,000 incentives with the New York 
Yankees.[17][18] Chan Ho Park decided to play for the Yankees after denying 
an offer of around $3 million per year from the Philadelphia Phillies.[19] 
Park got off to a poor start in 2010. In a widely circulated YouTube clip, 
he blamed his poor performance in one April appearance on a case of diarrhea. 
After struggling with a 5.60 ERA.,[20] Park was designated for assignment 
on July 31, 2010. On August 4, 2010, Park was claimed off waivers by the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.[21] On October 1, Park recorded a record for most wins 
by an Asian pitcher in MLB history, tossing three scoreless innings for 
his 124th career victory. He passed Hideo Nomo for the most ever by an 
Asian-born pitcher. He became a free agent at the end of the season.[22] 
On December 20, 2010, Park signed one-year deal with the Orix Buffaloes 
of Nippon Professional Baseball for the 2011 season.[23] On November 24, 
2011, Park signed one-year deal with the Hanwha Eagles of Korea Baseball 
Organization for the 2012 season. On December 20, 2011 Park announced that 
he would guarantee a minimum of $35.5k (₩40 million) of his salary to fund 
the development of amateur baseball in South Korea. His contract bonus 
has potential earnings at up to $550,000 (₩600 million) in which Park would 
donate 100% of this salary to fund efforts to build amateur baseball with 
youth in the country.[24] Park posted a record of 5-10 with a 5.06 ERA 
with the Eagles. He announced his retirement from baseball on November 
30, 2012. Park had a record of 124–98 in the Major Leagues with the Dodgers, 
Rangers, Padres, Mets, Phillies, Yankees, and Pirates. Between the 2005 
season and the 2006 season, Park represented South Korea in the World Baseball 
Classic. In the Asia Round games against Taiwan and Japan, Park made appearances 
as a closing pitcher, shutting out the opposing lineups. He made another 
appearance as a closer in the semifinal game against Mexico, in which he 
again shut out his opposing hitters. His performance made San Diego Padres' 
manager Bruce Bochy believe that Park can be used as an effective reliever 
as well as a starter. Park later said that Padres' closer Trevor Hoffman 
taught him how to focus in a relief situation. With his shutout performance 
in 10 innings and three saves, Korea finished the World Baseball Classic 
in third place and Park was selected to the WBC All-Star team along with 
his teammate Lee Seung-yeop and Team Korea's captain Lee Jong-beom. In 
his prime, Chan Ho was essentially a power pitcher, his biggest weapon 
being a four-seam fastball sitting in mid-90s (tops out at 100 mph). Mixed 
with a two-seam fastball, a slider, a curveball, and a changeup, he had 
five consecutive seasons of 10+ wins with the Dodgers. Being a power pitcher, 
however, he constantly revealed control problems, especially early in the 
game. He got many strikeouts, yet also allowed many bases on balls and 
hit batsmen that contributed to his lower than average strikeout-walk ratio 
of less than 2. This hindered him from achieving low ERA (He never had 
league top 10 season ERA except his career best season 2000 of 3.27 that 
was just 7th in NL by playing in pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium.) He was 
also a flyball-pitcher that benefited a lot from the huge Dodger Stadium 
outfield; however his style all added up and later backfired when he played 
in other teams. After unsuccessful seasons with Rangers, Padres, and Mets, 
he added a two-seam fastball learned from Orel Hershiser. Fox play by play 
announcer Matt Vasgersian once said about Park's two-seam fastball, "You 
can only see a two-seamer like that in PlayStation 2".[25] In his career 
in Philadelphia he also used a cutter and a sinker, learned from Kevin 
Brown. Park's 2008 comeback season was marked with a return to complete 
health for the first time in years, allowing him to combine his crafty 
veteran style with a renewed ability to pitch effective fastballs in low 
to mid-90s mph. Park married socialite Ri-hye Park on November 29, 2005. 
Although her heritage is Korean, she grew up in Japan and went to culinary 
school in New York. She is publicly known as a semi-professional cook, 
writer and an only daughter of Japan's 76th richest man according to The 
Philadelphia Inquirer. In Spring 2009, Ri-hye released a best-selling cookbook 
in Korea from which the proceeds went to various children charities on 
behalf of the Chan Ho Park Dream Foundation. Park has three daughters.
