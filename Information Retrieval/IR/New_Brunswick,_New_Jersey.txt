If I had to fall I wish it had been on the sidewalks of New York, not the 
sidewalks of New Brunswick, N.J. New Brunswick, officially City of New 
Brunswick, is a city in Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. It 
is the county seat of Middlesex County,[21][22] and the home of Rutgers 
University. The city is located on the Northeast Corridor rail line, 27 
miles (43 km) southwest of Manhattan, on the southern bank of the Raritan 
River. At the 2010 United States Census, the population of New Brunswick 
was 55,181,[9][10][11] reflecting an increase of 6,608 (+13.6%) from the 
48,573 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 6,862 
(+16.5%) from the 41,711 counted in the 1990 Census.[23] Due to the concentration 
of medical facilities in the area, including Robert Wood Johnson University 
Hospital and Saint Peter's University Hospital, as well as Rutgers, The 
State University of New Jersey's Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New 
Brunswick is known as "the Hub City".[24][25] The corporate headquarters 
and production facilities of several global pharmaceutical companies are 
situated in the city, including Johnson & Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one quarter 
of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city and in the 
1930s one out of three city residents were Hungarian.[26] The Hungarian 
community continues to exist, alongside a growing Asian and Hispanic community 
that has developed around French Street near Robert Wood Johnson University 
Hospital. Originally inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans, the first 
European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The 
settlement here was first called Prigmore's Swamp (1681–1697), then known 
as Inian's Ferry (1691–1714).[27] In 1714, the settlement was given the 
name New Brunswick, after the city of Braunschweig (called Brunswick in 
the Low German language), in state of Lower Saxony, in Germany. Braunschweig 
was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League, later in 
the Holy Roman Empire, and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and 
later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New 
Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and 
Elector of Hanover, of the House of Hanover (also known as the House of 
Brunswick), became King George I of Great Britain (1660–1727). Alternatively, 
the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of 
Brunswick-Lüneburg.[28][29] Centrally located between New York City and 
Philadelphia along an early thoroughfare known as the King's Highway and 
situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub 
for Colonial travelers and traders. New Brunswick was incorporated as a 
town in 1736 and chartered as a city in 1784.[30] It was incorporated into 
a town in 1798 as part of the Township Act of 1798. It was occupied by 
the British in the winter of 1776–1777 during the Revolutionary War.[31] 
The Declaration of Independence received one of its first public readings, 
by Col. John Neilson, in New Brunswick on July 9, 1776, in the days following 
its promulgation by the Continental Congress.[32][33][34] The Trustees 
of Queen's College (now Rutgers University), founded in 1766, voted to 
locate the young college in New Brunswick, selecting the city over Hackensack, 
in Bergen County, New Jersey. Classes began in 1771 with one instructor, 
one sophomore, Matthew Leydt, and several freshmen at a tavern called "The 
Sign of the Red Lion" on the corner of Albany and Neilson Streets (now 
the grounds of the Johnson & Johnson corporate headquarters). Classes were 
held through the American Revolution in various taverns and boarding houses, 
and at a building known as College Hall on George Street, until Old Queens 
was erected in 1808. It remains the oldest building on the Rutgers University 
campus.[35] The Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory 
School) was established also in 1766, and shared facilities with the College 
until 1830, when it located in a building (now known as Alexander Johnston 
Hall) across College Avenue from Old Queens.[36] After Rutgers University 
became the state university of New Jersey in 1945,[37] the Trustees of 
Rutgers divested itself of the Rutgers Preparatory School, which relocated 
in 1957 to an estate purchased from the Colgate-Palmolive Company in Franklin 
Township in neighboring Somerset County.[38] The New Brunswick Theological 
Seminary, founded in 1784 in New York, moved to New Brunswick in 1810, 
sharing its quarters with the fledgling Queen's College (Queens would close 
from 1810 to 1825 due to financial problems, and reopen in 1825 under the 
name Rutgers College).[39] The Seminary, due to overcrowding and differences 
over the mission of Rutgers College as a secular institution, moved to 
tract of land covering 7 acres (2.8 ha) located less than one-half mile 
(800 m) west, which it still occupies, although the land is now in the 
middle of Rutgers University's College Avenue campus. New Brunswick was 
formed by Royal charter on December 30, 1730, within other townships in 
Middlesex County and Somerset County and was reformed by Royal charter 
with the same boundaries on February 12, 1763, at which time it was divided 
into north and south wards. New Brunswick was incorporated as a city by 
an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1784.[30] The existence 
of an African American community dates back to the late 18th century, with 
the 1810 United States Census listing 53 free Blacks and 164 slaves. The 
city's Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church, located at 39 Morris 
Street, was originally established in 1825 at 25 Division Street, making 
it one of the oldest in New Jersey.[40] New Brunswick began attracting 
a Hungarian immigrant population around the turn of the 20th century. Hungarians 
were primarily attracted to the city by employment at Johnson & Johnson 
factories located in the city. Hungarians settled mainly in what today 
is the Fifth Ward. The immigrant population grew until the end of the early 
century immigration boom. During the Cold War, the community was revitalized 
by the decision to house refugees from the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution 
at Camp Kilmer, in nearby Edison. Even though the Hungarian population 
has been largely supplanted by newer immigrants, there continues to be 
a Hungarian Festival in the city held on Somerset Street on the first Saturday 
of June each year. Many Hungarian institutions set up by the community 
remain and active in the neighborhood, including: Magyar Reformed Church, 
Ascension Lutheran Church, St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph 
Byzantine Catholic Church, Hungarian American Athletic Club, Aprokfalva 
Montessori Preschool, Széchenyi Hungarian Community School & Kindergarten, 
Teleki Pál Scout Home, Hungarian American Foundation, Vers Hangja, Hungarian 
Poetry Group, Bolyai Lecture Series on Arts and Sciences, Hungarian Alumni 
Association, Hungarian Radio Program, Hungarian Civic Association, Committee 
of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick, and Csűrdöngölő 
Folk Dance Ensemble. Several landmarks in the city also testify to its 
Hungarian heritage. There is a street and a recreation park named after 
Lajos Kossuth, the famous leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The 
corner of Somerset Street and Plum Street is named Mindszenty Square where 
the first ever statue of Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty was erected. A stone 
memorial to the victims of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution also stands nearby. 
About 50% of New Brunswick's population is self-identified as Hispanic, 
the 14th highest percentage among municipalities in New Jersey.[9][41] 
Since the 1960s, many of the new residents of New Brunswick have come from 
Latin America. Many citizens moved from Puerto Rico in the 1970s. In the 
1980s, many immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and still later from 
Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Mexico. New Brunswick contains a number 
of examples of urban renewal in the United States. In the 1960s-1970s, 
the downtown area became blighted as middle class residents moved to newer 
suburbs surrounding the city, an example of the phenomenon known as "white 
flight." Beginning in 1975, Rutgers University, Johnson & Johnson and the 
local government collaborated through the New Jersey Economic Development 
Authority to form the New Brunswick Development Company (DevCo), with the 
goal of revitalizing the city center and redeveloping neighborhoods considered 
to be blighted and dangerous (via demolition of existing buildings and 
construction of new ones).[42] Johnson & Johnson decided to remain in New 
Brunswick and built a new world headquarters building in the area between 
Albany Street, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, Route 18, and George Street, 
requiring many old buildings and historic roads to be removed. The Hiram 
Market area, a historic district that by the 1970s had become a mostly 
Puerto Rican and Dominican-American neighborhood, was demolished to build 
a Hyatt hotel and conference center, and upscale housing.[43] Johnson & 
Johnson guaranteed Hyatt Hotels' investment as they were wary of building 
an upscale hotel in a run-down area. The redevelopment process has been 
controversial. Devco, the hospitals, and the city government continue to 
draw ire from both historic preservationists, those opposing gentrification[44] 
and those concerned with eminent domain abuses and tax abatements for developers.[45] 
New Brunswick is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible 
for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. 
Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within a half-mile of a 
train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit.[46][47] The Gateway 
tower, a 22-story redevelopment project next to the train station, was 
completed in 2012. The structure consists of apartments and condominiums 
(named "The Vue") built above a multi-story parking structure with a bridge 
connecting it to the station.[48] Boraie Development, a real estate development 
firm based in New Brunswick, has developed projects using the incentive. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area 
of 5.789 square miles (14.995 km2), including 5.227 square miles (13.539 km2) 
of land and 0.562 square miles (1.456 km2) of water (9.71%).[1][2] New 
Brunswick is in Raritan Valley (a line of cities in central New Jersey). 
New Brunswick is on the south side of Raritan Valley along with Piscataway, 
Highland Park, Edison and Franklin Township (Somerset County). New Brunswick 
lies southwest of Newark and New York City and northeast of Trenton and 
Philadelphia. New Brunswick is bordered by Piscataway Township, Highland 
Park, and Edison Township across the Raritan River to the north by way 
of the Donald and Morris Goodkind Bridges, and also by North Brunswick 
Township to the southwest, East Brunswick Township to the southeast, and 
Franklin Township in Somerset County.[49] While the city does not hold 
elections based on a ward system it has been so divided.[50][51][52] There 
are several neighborhoods in the city, which include the Fifth Ward, Feaster 
Park, Lincoln Park,[citation needed] Raritan Gardens and Edgebrook-Westons 
Mills.[50] New Brunswick has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate 
classification Cfa) typical to New Jersey, characterized by humid, hot 
summers and mild winters with moderate to considerable rainfall throughout 
the year. There is no marked wet or dry season. At the 2010 United States 
Census, there were 55,181 people, 14,119 households, and 7,751 families

Hall has promoted the nickname "The Health Care City" to reflect the importance 
of the healthcare industry to its economy.[67] The city is home to the 
world headquarters of Johnson & Johnson, along with several medical teaching 
and research institutions including Saint Peter's University Hospital, 
Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and the Robert Wood Johnson Medical 
School, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey, and The Bristol-Myers Squibb 
Children's Hospital.[68] Most of New Brunswick's retail businesses are 
within a designated Urban Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits 
to encourage employment within the zone, shoppers can take advantage of 
a reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at 
eligible merchants.[69] Three neighboring professional venues, Crossroads 
Theatre designed by Parsons+Fernandez-Casteleiro Architects from New York. 
In 1999, the Crossroads Theatre won the prestigious Tony Award for Outstanding 
Regional Theatre. Crossroads is the first African American theater to receive 
this honor in the 33-year history of this special award category.[70] There 
is also George Street Playhouse, and the State Theatre, comprise the heart 
of the local theatre scene. Crossroad Theatre houses American Repertory 
Ballet and the Princeton Ballet School. Rutgers University has a number 
of student companies that perform everything from cabaret acts to Shakespeare 
and musical productions. New Brunswick is the site of the Jane Voorhees 
Zimmerli Art Museum, founded in 1966, at Rutgers University, Albus Cavus, 
and the Rutgers University Geology Museum.[71] New Brunswick was an important 
centre for avant-garde art in the 1950s-70s with several artists such as 
Allan Kaprow, George Segal, George Brecht, Robert Whitman, Robert Watts, 
Lucas Samaras, Geoffrey Hendricks, Wolf Vostell and Roy Lichtenstein; some 
of whom had taught at Rutgers University. This group of artists was sometimes 
referred to as the 'New Jersey School' or the 'New Brunswick School of 
Painting'. The YAM Festival was venue on 19 May 1963 to actions and Happenings. 
For more information, see Fluxus at Rutgers University.[72][73] New Brunswick 
has a diverse restaurant market including Nouvelle American, Italian, Middle 
Eastern, Mexican, Peruvian, Indian, Ethiopian, Thai, Taiwanese and Chinese 
cuisine. Restaurants such as The Harvest Moon, Steakhouse 85, Frog and 
the Peach, Delta's, Panico's, The Old Bay, Clydz, Tumulty's Pub, Old Man 
Rafferty's, Brother Jimmy's BBQ, Burger Fi, Destination Dogs, and Chipotle 
serve the area. The "Grease Trucks" are a group of truck-based food vendors 
located on the College Avenue campus of Rutgers University. They are known 
for serving "Fat Sandwiches," a sub roll containing several ingredients 
such as steak, chicken fingers, French fries, falafel, cheeseburgers, mozzarella 
sticks, gyro meat, bacon, eggs and / or marinara sauce. In 2013 the grease 
trucks were removed for the construction of a new Rutgers building and 
were forced to move into various other areas of the Rutgers- New Brunswick 
Campus.[74] New Brunswick's bar scene has been the home to many original 
rock bands, including some which went on to national prominence such as 
The Smithereens and Bon Jovi, as well as a center for local punk rock and 
underground music. Many alternative rock bands got radio airplay thanks 
to Matt Pinfield who was part of the New Brunswick music scene for over 
20 years at Rutgers University radio station WRSU. Local pubs and clubs 
hosted many local bands, including the Court Tavern[75] until 2012[76] 
(scheduled to reopen),[77] and the Melody Bar during the 1980s and 1990s. 
As the New Brunswick basement scene grows in popularity, it was ranked 
the number 4 spot to see Indie bands in New Jersey.[78] New Brunswick City 
Hall, the New Brunswick Free Public Library, and the New Brunswick Main 
Post Office are located in the city's Civic Square government district, 
as are numerous other city, county, state, and federal offices. The City 
of New Brunswick is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as 
the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council system of municipal 
government. The governing body consists of a mayor and a five-member City 
Council, all elected at-large in partisan elections to four-year terms 
of office in even years as part of the November general election. The City 
Council's five members are elected on a staggered basis, with either two 
or three seats coming up for election every other year. As the legislative 
body of New Brunswick's municipal government, the City Council is responsible 
for approving the annual budget, ordinances and resolutions, contracts, 
and appointments to boards and commissions. The Council President, elected 
to a two-year term by the members of the Council, presides over all meetings.[7] 
As of 2016[update], Democrat James Cahill is the 62nd Mayor of New Brunswick; 
he was sworn in as Mayor on January 1, 1991 and is serving a term that 
expires on December 31, 2018.[3] Members of the City Council are Council 
President Kevin P. Egan (D, 2018), Council Vice President Glenn J. Fleming 
Sr. (D, 2016), John A. Andersen (D, 2016), Rebecca H. Escobar (D, 2018) 
and Elizabeth Sheehan Garlatti (D, 2016).[79][80][81][82][83] The New Brunswick 
police department has received attention for various incidents over the 
years. In 1991, the fatal shooting of Shaun Potts, an unarmed black resident, 
by Sergeant Zane Grey led to multiple local protests.[84] In 1996, Officer 
James Consalvo fatally shot Carolyn "Sissy" Adams, an unarmed prostitute 
who had bit him.[85] The Adams case sparked calls for reform in the New 
Brunswick police department, and ultimately was settled with the family.[86] 
Two officers, Sgt. Marco Chinchilla and Det. James Marshall, were convicted 
of running a bordello in 2001. Chinchilla was sentenced to three years 
and Marshall was sentenced to four.[87] In 2011, Officer Brad Berdel fatally 
shot Barry Deloatch, a black man who had run from police (although police 
claim he struck officers with a stick);[88] this sparked daily protests 
from residents.[89] Following the Deloatch shooting, sergeant Richard Rowe 
was formally charged with mishandling 81 Internal Affairs investigations; 
Mayor Cahill explained that this would help "rebuild the public's trust 
and confidence in local law enforcement."[90] New Brunswick is located 
in the 6th Congressional District[91] and is part of New Jersey's 17th 
state legislative district.[10][92][93] New Jersey's Sixth Congressional 
District is represented by Frank Pallone (D, Long Branch).[94] New Jersey 
is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term 
ends 2021)[95] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[96][97] For the 2016–2017 
session (Senate, General Assembly), the 17th Legislative District of the 
New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Bob Smith 
(D, Piscataway) and in the General Assembly by Joseph Danielsen (D, Franklin 
Township) and Joseph V. Egan (D, New Brunswick)[98] The Governor of New 
Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[99] The Lieutenant Governor 
of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[100] Middlesex County 
is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose seven members are elected 
at-large on a partisan basis to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered 
basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election each year 
as part of the November general election. At an annual reorganization meeting 
held in January, the board selects from among its members a Freeholder 
Director and Deputy Director. As of 2015[update], Middlesex County's Freeholders 
(with party affiliation, term-end year, residence and committee chairmanship 
listed in parentheses) are Freeholder Director Ronald G. Rios (D, term 
ends December 31, 2015, Carteret; Ex-officio on all committees),[101] Freeholder 
Deputy Director Carol Barrett Bellante (D, 2017; Monmouth Junction, South 
Brunswick Township; County Administration),[102] Kenneth Armwood (D, 2016, 
Piscataway; Business Development and Education),[103] Charles Kenny ( D,

Park; Public Safety and Health),[105] Charles E. Tomaro (D, 2017, Edison; 
Infrastructure Management)[106] and Blanquita B. Valenti (D, 2016, New 
Brunswick; Community Services).[107][108] Constitutional officers are County 
Clerk Elaine M. Flynn (D, Old Bridge Township),[109] Sheriff Mildred S. 
Scott (D, 2016, Piscataway)[110] and Surrogate Kevin J. Hoagland (D, 2017; 
New Brunswick).[108][111] As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 22,742

in pre-Kindergarten through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former 
Abbott districts statewide,[120] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" 
based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building 
and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the 
New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[121][122] New Brunswick's Board 
of Education members are appointed by the city's mayor. As of the 2011-12 
school year, the district's 10 schools had an enrollment of 7,657 students 
and 630.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio 
of 12.14:1.[123] Schools in the district (with 2011-12 enrollment data 
from the National Center for Education Statistics[124]) are Lincoln Elementary 
School[125] (grades PreK-8; 578 students), Livingston Elementary School[126]
