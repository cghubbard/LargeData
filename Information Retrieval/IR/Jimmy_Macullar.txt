As Player As Manager James F. "Jimmy" Macullar (January 16, 1855 – April 
8, 1924), also known as "Little Mac", was an American Major League Baseball 
player from Boston, Massachusetts. He played mostly at shortstop, but did 
play many games in the center field, for three different teams in two leagues. 
He holds the record for career games played at shortstop by a left-handed 
thrower, at 325, and is the only lefty to ever play more than 250 games 
at that position.[1] Nicknamed "Little Mac", due to his small stature (5'6", 
155 lbs), he was briefly a player-manager for the Syracuse Stars in 1879. 
Finishing with a 5-21 record, he never managed again.[2] In the winter 
of 1879–80, Macullar and Hick Carpenter became the first North Americans 
to play in the Cuban League. They were signed by the Colón club and were 
so dominant that other teams refused to play against them.[3] He died in 
Baltimore, Maryland at the age of 69, and interred at Baltimore Cemetery.[4]
