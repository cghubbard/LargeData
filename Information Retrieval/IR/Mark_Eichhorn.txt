Mark Anthony Eichhorn (born November 21, 1960, in San Jose, California) 
is a retired Major League Baseball pitcher best known for his tenure with 
the Toronto Blue Jays in the late 1980s and the early 1990s when he often 
served as a middle reliever/set-up man for All-Star closer, Tom Henke. 
He was the 1986 American League Rookie Pitcher of the year for the Blue 
Jays, a campaign in which he set team records for rookie relief in ERA, 
games, wins, and strikeouts. He would have easily won the AL ERA title 
had he pitched five more innings to qualify. Mark Eichhorn made his major 
league debut for the Blue Jays in 1982 but suffered a severe shoulder injury 
and would not return to the majors until 1986. The shoulder injury had 
robbed Eichhorn of most of his fastball velocity and had forced him to 
turn to an unconventional sidearm motion in which his arm angle was well 
below the belt when he released the ball. He was notable for an exceptionally 
low velocity for a major league pitcher but his control and unusual delivery 
made him an effective player. Eichhorn played for four different ballclubs 
during his career: the Toronto Blue Jays (1982, 1986–1988, 1992–1993), 
Atlanta Braves (1989), California Angels (1990–1992, 1996), and Baltimore 
Orioles (1994). He made his Major League Baseball debut on August 30, 1982. 
He would return to the minor leagues after the '82 season and not resurface 
in the Major Leagues again until 1986. Eichhorn played his final game on 
September 14, 1996. Eichhorn is currently the pitching coach for Aptos 
High School in Aptos, California. Mark coached his 12-year-old son, Kevin, 
on the Aptos Little League team which won the Little League West Regional 
and played in the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA in 2002, 
as chronicled in the movie Small Ball. Kevin was later drafted in the third 
round, number 104 overall, by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2008 MLB 
Draft, deciding to sign instead of attending Santa Clara University, where 
he had been collegiately committed since his junior year of high school. 
On January 24, 2011, Kevin was traded to the Detroit Tigers organization 
in a deal for pitcher Armando Galarraga, pitching through the 2014 season,
