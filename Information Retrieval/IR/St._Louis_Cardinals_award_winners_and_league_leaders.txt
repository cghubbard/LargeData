The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional baseball franchise based in St. 
Louis, Missouri, compete in the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Before joining the NL in 1892, they were also a charter member of 
the American Association (AA) from 1882 to 1891. Although St. Louis has 
been the Cardinals' home city for the franchise's entire existence, they 
were also known as the Brown Stockings, Browns, and Perfectos. In 134 seasons, 
the franchise has won more than 10,000 regular season games and appeared 
in 27 postseasons while claiming 12 interleague championships and 23 league 
pennants. Eleven of the interleague championships are World Series titles 
won under the modern format since 1903; 19 of the league pennants are NL 
pennants, and the other four are AA pennants.[1] Their 11 World Series 
titles represent the most in the NL and are second in MLB only to the New 
York Yankees' 27. The first major award MLB presented for team performance 
occurred with the World Series champions in 1903, and for individual performance, 
in 1911 in the American League with the Chalmers Award. The first major 
award which the National League presented for individual performance was 
the League Award in 1924, the predecessor of the modern Most Valuable Player 
Award (MVP). Rogers Hornsby earned the League Award in 1925 making him 
the first winner of an MVP or its equivalent in franchise history. The 
following season, the Cardinals won their first modern World Series. They 
won the first World Series Trophy,[2] following their 1967 World Series 
title,[3] which, before that year, the World Series champion had never 
received any kind of official trophy.[4] Major League Baseball (MLB), with 
voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), first presented 
the modern MVP award to one player each in the American and National League 
in 1931. Voting is accomplished with two writers from each city containing 
an MLB club, of whom each fills in a ballot with the names of ten players, 
ranking each from first to tenth.[5] The BBWAA began polling three writers 
in each league city in 1938 and reduced that number to two per league city 
in 1961. One of the MVP award's predecessors was the League Award, which 
the National League awarded via of voting process in a similar fashion 
to that of the BBWAA from 1924 to 1929.[6] 16 different Cardinals players 
have won the award a total of 20 times. Stan Musial and Albert Pujols are 
the only players to have won multiple times, each having won three times. 
Pujols is the only Cardinals player to have won in consecutive seasons, 
from 2008–2009. The most consecutive seasons a Cardinals player has won 
the award is three, which occurred from 1942–44 between Mort Cooper, Musial, 
and Marty Marion. Typically awarded to position players, Cardinals pitchers 
who have won an MVP award are Cooper, Dizzy Dean, and Bob Gibson. At least 
one Cardinals player has won the award in each completed decade since the 
League Award was given except in the 1950s. MLB baseball introduced this 
award in 1999 to recognize the top hitter in each league. The World Series 
Most Valuable Player has been awarded since 1955. Starting in 1977, MLB 
created the NLCS Most Valuable Player Award to recognize the top player 
of that season's NLCS. Introduced in 2011 by Rawlings, the Platinum Glove 
is fan-voted award conferred annually to single out the top-fielding player 
from all Gold Glove winners in each league.[7] Hillerich & Bradsby, the 
manufacturer of Louisville Slugger baseball bats, first awarded the Silver 
Slugger in 1980.[10] Cardinals award winners include those who played the 
highest amount of games in their career with the Cardinals.[14] Note: Normally 
awarded to one athlete selected from multiple sports per year since 1968. 
Note: Established in 1929 and discontinued in 1946. Note: Awarded to one 
player in all MLB since 1936. Note: Awarded annually to one player in each 
league since 1965. In 1992, the Comeback Player of the Year was the first 
and only Players' Choice honor; others followed in subsequent years. Names 
in bold received the award based on their work as Cardinals broadcasters.
