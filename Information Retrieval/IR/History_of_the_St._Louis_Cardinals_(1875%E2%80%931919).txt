History People Overview Grounds Teams The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional 
baseball franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National 
League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). As the game of baseball garnered 
interest in the United States in the 19th century, professional baseball 
in St. Louis became rooted chiefly in one disestablished Major League club 
– named the Brown Stockings, the same as the Cardinals' earliest name – 
which is loosely connected, but does not fall within the scope of, today's 
Cardinals. The Brown Stockings became St. Louis' first fully professional 
baseball club when they gained accession in the National Association (NA) 
in 1875. However, the NA folded after that season. That winter, with five 
other former NA teams, St. Louis established a new, eight-team league called 
the National League (NL) and began play the next season. Despite early 
success, Brown Stocking players were found to be connected to game fixing 
scandals, which forced bankruptcy and the club's expulsion from the NL. 
This scandal also abrogated their professional status but some members 
maintained play as a semi-professional team, primarily operated by outfielder 
Ned Cuthbert, until 1881. With interest in reviving professional baseball 
in St. Louis steadily growing, grocery and brewery tycoon Chris von der 
Ahe observed with fascination the team playing near his store and beer 
garden garnered large crowds. He purchased the club in 1881, and – together 
with other club owners (who also happened to beer magnates) interested 
in creating professional league that could rival the National League – 
made it a charter member of the American Association in 1882, bringing 
professional baseball back to the Gateway City. This Brown Stockings club 
became St. Louis' Major League mainstay, now competing as the Cardinals. 
During their time in the AA, the Cardinals established the first St. Louis 
professional sports dynasty, finishing with best overall record in the 
league each year from 1885 to 1888 and the best all-time record in that 
league's history. They also took their first interleague championship (a 
precursor to the World Series), finishing off their rivals, the Chicago 
White Stockings – now the Chicago Cubs – in the 1886 World Series. With 
instability plaguing the American Association, the league folded after 
the 1891 season. Now named "Browns", St. Louis rejoined the National League, 
only to find a complete reversal of its AA success. From 1892 to 1920 – 
a span of twenty-nine seasons – St. Louis managed just five winning seasons 
and finished in last or next-to-last place on 17 occasions. The club also 
rode out 31 managerial changes and two more name changes, the last being 
to "Cardinals" in 1900. However, following this extended era of futility, 
the Cardinals emerged into a renaissance in the 1920s that brought championship 
baseball back to St. Louis. The game of baseball as it is played today 
is significantly removed from the game that originated in the late 18th 
century in the northeastern United States.[1] Noted baseball historian 
and statistician Bill James commented that the game and playing field resembled 
fastpitch softball more than contemporary baseball. The style of play diverged 
in many facets. Pitchers were prohibited from throwing overhand – they 
were only permitted to throw underhanded or sidearmed. They threw from 
a flat outlined box without a designated point of footing to release the 
ball instead of a mound with a pitching rubber until 1893. The pitcher's 
mound did not receive official recognition until 1903.[2] Counts of balls 
and strikes were also modified: originally, a hitter did not receive a 
walk until the pitcher threw nine balls and the number required to draw 
a walk was eventually whittled down to four in the 1880s. Hit batsmen did 
not automatically get awarded first base at first (it was instead counted 
as a ball) and foul balls and pitches taken in the strike zone were not 
initially regarded as strikes. Both fair ball and foul ball rules varied, 
influencing the batter's ability to get on base.[2] Fielders played barehanded; 
gloves did not become prevalent until the 1880s and at that point they 
resembled work gloves.[3] The infield contained three fielders with a large 
gap between second and third base. Three fielders were stationed in the 
outfield like the modern game with an extra fielder, analogous with the 
softball "rover." In 1856, Dickey Pearce (one of St. Louis' early professional 
players), originally assigned as a fourth outfielder, moved into infield 
gap between second and third and pioneered the modern shortstop position.[4] 
Baseball fever grew rapidly across the US before the American Civil War 
and swept into St. Louis in the 1860s, sprouting numerous amateur teams 
around the city. The sport especially drew the attention of gamblers, which 
took decades for Major League Baseball to root out and St. Louis baseball 
teams would prove to be no exemption. However, it was economic expansion 
and civic pride that ultimately drew professional baseball to St. Louis, 
but not first without a catalyst of emulation.[5] Over the years, a trade 
rivalry developed with the city of Chicago – a nearby "major" city – and 
baseball became yet another expression of this urban rivalry.[5] While 
St. Louis developed as the major hub of the Mississippi River, Chicago 
developed as a major railway center, and by 1870, St. Louis was the fourth-largest 
city in the United States and Chicago a close fifth.[6] Due to the rapid 
growth of the rail industry, Chicago's population passed that of St. Louis 
in the 1880 census.[7] The success of baseball clubs such as the self-proclaimed 
"original" professional baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings – winners 
of 57 consecutive "official" contests from coast to coast between 1869 
and 1870 – and the first dynasty in organized baseball established by the 
Brooklyn Atlantics motivated Chicago city leaders to organize and recruit 
a club composed solely of professional players, which became the Chicago 
White Stockings in 1870.[8][9] The White Stockings trained by playing amateur 
teams in nearby major cities such as St. Louis – who proved nearly unbeatable, 
resulting in consistently lopsided victories for Chicago – before becoming 
a charter member of the first all-professional league, the National Association 
of Professional Base Ball Players, or National Association (NA), in 1871.[8] 
Until 1874, St. Louis carried only amateur teams – two of the most prominent 
being the Empires and Unions – as its top level of competition. Long after 
other cities had established all-professional clubs, the results were almost 
always identical month after month, year after year: the highly skilled, 
professional clubs such as the White Stockings continuously walloped those 
of St. Louis. The scoreboard embarrassment finally convinced locals that 
an all-professional team was in order. City leaders raised $20,000 to make 
this happen – the Brown Stockings – and city development pioneer and planner 
John Baptiste Charles Lucas II became the team president. The club secured 
admission into the National Association and began play in 1875.[10] The 
same season St. Louis chartered the Brown Stockings, another all-professional 
startup in St. Louis, the Red Stockings began play in the NA as well.[11] 
However, the Red Stockings were short-lived as they performed poorly. The 
Brown Stockings acquired four-time home run champion Lip Pike, a national 
celebrity for his long home runs, and one of the Brown Stockings' first 
stars.[12] Pud Galvin's 1.16 ERA led NA in 1875.[13] After the Brown Stockings' 
initial season which saw them finish 39-29-2 among six teams, the NA folded 
after its fifth year due to instability. The winter following the disestablishment 
of the NA, six teams from that league – the Brown Stockings, the White 
Stockings, the Philadelphia Athletics, the Boston Red Stockings, the Hartford 
Dark Blues, and Mutual of New York – and two expansion franchises, the 
Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Louisville Grays all agreed to form a 
new all-professional baseball league, the National League (NL). St. Louis 
improved on its first and lone year in the NA, going 45-19 that year for 
a third-place finish. George Bradley, who pitched every game and all but 
four innings for the Brown Stockings that year,[14] hurled the first no-hitter 
in Major League history against the Dark Blues. He led the NL that year 
with a 1.23 earned run average (ERA) and 16 shutouts in 573 innings pitched.[15] 
However, St. Louis was expelled from the NL after the 1877 season due to 
a game-fixing scandal that involved two players of whom they had acquired 
from the Louisville Grays.[16] The team went bankrupt. Despite bankruptcy 
and expulsion, they continued play as a semi-professional barnstorming 
team for four years behind the efforts of outfielder Ned Cuthbert – one 
of the NL Brown Stockings' players – to keep them playing games against 
anyone who would play.[17] From the moment of the Brown Stockings' resignation 
from the NL, St. Louis Republic sportswriter Al Spink, who before had reported 
on underhanded agreements to fix games prior to the expulsion, lobbied 
to get professional baseball back in St. Louis. The team's play did not 
disappoint, helping to draw local fans from their antipathy toward the 
sport and back into Grand Avenue Grounds. As excitement grew, Cuthbert 
cultivated the interest of the otherwise baseball-ignorant German immigrant 
Chris von der Ahe in the team, a saloon and grocery store owner. Before 
the 1882 season, Von der Ahe purchased the troubled but promising remnant 
of the Brown Stockings.[17] He made Spink the team's secretary and business 
manager, and Spink helped generate even greater revenues.[18] Together 
with beer magnates in five other cities – Baltimore, Cincinnati, Louisville, 
Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh – Von der Ahe established St. Louis in a new 
all-professional baseball league, the American Association – ironically, 
as a rival to the National League.[19] St. Louis found their first taste 
of consistent, competitive Major League baseball starting in 1882, their 
first year in a now-defunct former major league known as the American Association 
(AA), with a fifth-place finish at 37-43. In 1883, the team's name was 
officially shortened to the Browns, and they broke through to the league's 
elite with Tony Mullane and Jumbo McGinnis tag-teaming as a formidable 
two-man starting rotation. The Browns improved to 65-33 (.663 winning percentage) 
and second place.[20] Greater success lay ahead still. Guided mainly by 
manager Charlie Comiskey, the club went on to establish themselves as the 
dominant team in the league, winning four pennants in a row in from 1885 
to 1888.[21] During their four-year pennant run, pitcher Bob Caruthers 
and outfielder Tip O'Neill starred for the Browns. In the formative years 
of the major leagues, where record statistical achievement transpired that 
is perceived as rare in today's game, a group of talented stars including 
Caruthers and O'Neill cogented St. Louis' way. O'Neill won the first batting 
triple crown in franchise history in 1887, the only one in AA history, 
and just the second in Major League Baseball history with a .435 batting 
average, 14 home runs, 123 runs batted in (RBIs). He also led the league 
in runs scored, doubles, triples, on-base percentage (OBP), and slugging 
percentage.[22] In 1885, Caruthers won 40 games and allowed a 2.07 earned 
run average, both tops in the AA. The next year, Caruthers appeared in 
43 games in the outfield in addition to 44 appearances as a pitcher, and 
he was one of the AA's top hitters, leading the league with an OPS+ of 
201, and an OBP of .446. He also finished in the top ten in batting average 
at .334, triples, walks, and second in slugging percentage (.527).[23] 
Dave Foutz emerged as another two-way threat, winning the American Association 
ERA title at 2.11 and 41 games won in 504 innings pitched, and batted .280 
with 18 doubles, 9 triples, three home runs, 59 RBIs, and 17 stolen bases. 
While his 1887 season as a pitcher was a disappointment by his standards, 
with "just" 25 wins and a 3.87 ERA, he had his best season at the plate, 
batting .357 with 13 triples, four home runs, 108 RBIs and 22 stolen bases.[24] 
Pitcher Silver King compiled a 45-20 record while allowing a 1.63 ERA and 
striking out 258 in 585 innings in 1888. His 15.8 total WAR is the Cardinals' 
franchise record, the ninth-highest single season total in history, 14.0 
pitching WAR the 11th-highest and his 195 ERA+ is the 41st-best in major 
league history.[25][26][27][28] That year, the Browns' pitching staff posted 
a 2.09 ERA and a 152 ERA+.[29] St. Louis' highest winning percentages occurred 
in 1885 at .705, and in 1887 at .704. The Browns finished with a winning 
percentage of .625 or better eight times.[20] One of the three teams to 
participate in all ten seasons in the league's history, St. Louis totaled 
780 wins and 432 losses for a .689 winning percentage. Both the win total 
and winning percentage are league records, despite the Boston Reds' single 
season in the AA also resulting in a .689 winning percentage: When rounded 
to five digits, St. Louis' winning percentage was .68905 and Boston's was 
.68889. Their four pennants won are also the most pennants in league history. 
During the height of the Browns' success in the American Association, another 
St. Louis entry known as the Maroons commenced play in 1884 in the Union 
Association. Henry Lucas – a younger brother of the original Brown Stockings' 
owner J. B. C. Lucas II – owned the Maroons and established the league.[30] 
The Maroons won the league with a 94–19 record (.832 winning percentage) 
in its only year of existence, then joined the National League the following 
year.[31] However, the Maroons' success was short-lived as their winning 
percentage bottomed out to .333, and they could no longer compete with 
the Browns' domination of the American Association.[31] Lucas sold the 
team to the NL, who in turn, sold it to John T. Brush after the 1886 season. 
Brush moved the club to Indianapolis and renamed it the Hoosiers.[30][32] 
Racial segregation started to become a custom in baseball about the time 
that eight Browns members withdrew from playing an exhibition game in September 
1887 against the New York Cubans, a prominent 'colored' team.[33] The Browns 
were in Philadelphia with plans to travel to New York City to play the 
Cuban Giants in a lucrative exhibition game. However, the night before 
departure to New York, eight Browns players signed and delivereed a letter 
to Von der Ahe stating their disagreement to "play against negroes to-morrow", 
because they thought they were "only doing what is right."[33] However, 
the cancelation of the game with the Cuban Giants was merely symptomatic 
of a larger trend around the sport. That season, Cap Anson of the Chicago 
White Stockings publicly threatened not to play any 'white' professional 
teams who hired black players just months after the International League 
prohibited further signing of black players. Ironically, it would be by 
an act sixty years later by then-former Cardinals executive in Branch Rickey 
that broke the color barrier in MLB when he débuted Jackie Robinson in 
1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Due to their AA pennant wins, the Browns 
played in a predecessor of the World Series from 1885–1888, in which the 
AA champion challenged the NL champion in what was considered at the time 
an exhibition series, predating the formation of the American League. The 
Browns met the Chicago Cubs prototype, the Chicago White Stockings for 
the first two World Series. The 1885 series ended in a dispute (tie), but 
St. Louis won the 1886 series outright, spurring a vigorous St. Louis-Chicago 
rivalry that ensues to this day.[34] This 1886 World Series was also the 
only one won by any AA team. In the 1887 series St. Louis fell to the Detroit 
Wolverines and in 1888 to the New York Giants. Though 1888 would be their 
last first-place finish, the Browns remained one of the AA's powerful clubs 
until the league's end, finishing in second, third, and second place in 
each of the next three seasons. On the last day of the 1891 season, pitcher 
Ted Breitenstein, making his first Major League start (though not his début), 
threw a no-hitter against the Louisville Colonels, an 8–0 defeat. This 
contest proved significant in two ways. First, it was the first no-hitter 
in Cardinals franchise history. Second, it was the last no-hitter on the 
final day of play in the American Association, as the league went bankrupt 
and ceased operations following the 1891 season.[35] The Browns migrated 
to the National League, leaving behind much of their success for the next 
three decades. After the American Association collapsed, the National League 
reenrolled St. Louis to raise the total to twelve. The St. Louis Cardinals 
have had perpetual affiliation since. Their inaugural season of reentry 
was largely a disappointment their winning percentage plunged from .625 
in 1891 to .373. With an opportunity emerging the next season for a larger 
property at Vandeventer and Natural Bridge Avenues, Von der Ahe moved the 
club a few blocks north-northwest from Grand and Dodier and opened a new 
park christened as "New Sportsman's Park" on April 27. The last game in 
Sportsman's Park was against the Cincinnati Reds on April 23. Despite the 
new park and league, the struggles the club encountered to rediscover the 
form of success that hallmarked their dominance in the American Association 
endured. Between 1892 and 1919, St. Louis managed just five winning seasons, 
finishing in last or next-to-last place sixteen times. They had also had 
zero World Series appearances, four seasons of 100-losses or more, and 
even finished the 1897 season at 29–102 for a franchise-worst .221 winning 
percentage. In addition, 26 different managers took the helm totaling 31 
changes.[20] After nearly a decade of lugubrious performance and declining 
profits, a calamitous fire at New Sportsman's Park in 1898 destroyed the 
stadium and forced the team into bankruptcy. A resulting lawsuit forced 
Von der Ahe to sell the team at auction. C. Edward Becker purchased all 
of the St. Louis club's stock and became known informally as "Chris's angel."[36] 
In the spring of 1899, the Board of Directors made of NL team owners met 
and announced the reorganization of the old Sportsman's club and St. Louis 
Base Ball Association into the American Base ball and Athletic Exhibition 
Company of St. Louis. Frank De Haas Robison, also the owner of the Cleveland 
Spiders, purchased the team and became president of the new association, 
and Becker the vice president. Robison's brother, Stanley Robison, became 
co-owner.[37][38] Hoping reverse St. Louis' fortunes coming off a 39–111 
season, Robison abjured the name Browns for "Perfectos" and furnished their 
jersey with a cardinal red trim and sock striping prior to 1899.[39] He 
also renamed the Perfectos' stadium League Park. Agitated by dismal fan 
attendance in Cleveland, Robison in turn infused the Perfectos roster with 
much of the Spiders' marquée talent just weeks before the season opener.[40] 
Three of Cleveland's future Hall of Famers migrated to St. Louis: Cy Young, 
Jesse Burkett, and Bobby Wallace.[41] The roster maneuvers successfully 
switched the teams in the standings but failed to create the powerhouse 
Robison envisioned as St. Louis finished just fifth in both 1899 and 1900. 
However, their 84-67 finish in 1899 was the team's best record between 
the AA era until 1921, after Sam Breadon purchased the company. Meanwhile, 
the beleaguered Spiders lost 134 games that year––a record figure for one 
season in MLB history that has not been matched despite incremental increases 
in the number of games played in a season over the years––before folding. 
In all part of a league-wide contraction that saw the National League shrink 
from twelve to eight teams, the new vacancies of professional baseball 
franchises opened the door for the creation of the American League (AL), 
a new major league to rival the National League. Of all leagues formed 
in an attempt to rival the NL since the days of the American Association, 
the AL has outlasted every other one and became one of the highest-quality 
competitive leagues comparable to the NL, effectively replacing the former. 
Later that season, St. Louis Republic sportswriter Willie McHale included 
an account in a column of a female fan he heard remarking about the uniforms, 
"What a lovely shade of cardinal." Fans took keenly to the moniker "Cardinals" 
and, the next year, popularity for the nickname induced an official change 
to Cardinals.[39] Meanwhile, changes in St. Louis' competitive status were 
also afoot – albeit temporarily. Leading the Cardinals' to newfound glory, 
Young compiled a 45-35 won-lost record, a 2.78 ERA and 72 complete games 
of 85 starts in 690 innings.[42] One effect of the new American League's 
formation was that it precipitated Young's departure from St. Louis when 
he "jumped" to the Boston Americans before the 1901 season – during a time 
when jumping was commonplace.[a][43][44] In spite of Young's departure, 
the 1901 team continued its resurgent play with a 76-64 record propelled 
by the highest-scoring offense in the NL, finishing in fourth place out 
of eight teams.[45] Burkett, an outfielder, led the NL in batting average 
(.376), hits (226), on-base percentage (.440) and runs (140).[46] This 
was their best positional finish from their entrance into the NL until 
1914, when they finished third, and their second-highest winning percentage 
(.543) between entering the NL and 1921. The three-season period 1899 and 
1901 marked the zenith of their first three decades in the National League 
in terms of won-lost records.[20] In 1902, an American League team moved 
from Milwaukee into St. Louis and confiscated the moniker Browns, striking 
an instant rivalry that lasted five decades. Eventually becoming the Baltimore 
Orioles, the Browns turned out to be a hit in St. Louis and a formidable 
rival for the Cardinals in spite of similar levels of success on the field 
into the 1920s. Not only did this version of the Browns usurp the Cardinals' 
former namesake which symbolized their glory years, the club even built 
a new stadium on the old site of the Cardinals' ballpark –– then within 
walking distance of New Sportsman's Park –– and outdrew them at the gate 
in their first two decades in St. Louis. Further stoking the rivalry, Burkett 
jumped from the Cardinals to the Browns, although at this point his skill 
were in decline. In his three seasons with the Cardinals, he batted a combined 
.378; in three seasons with the Browns he batted a combined .290.[46] In 
1911, Robison's daughter, Helene Hathaway Britton inherited the Cardinals 
when his brother and co-owner, Stanley Robison died and became the first 
female owner of a professional sports team in United States history. In 
memory of her father, Britton renamed League Park Robison Field. Also from 
Cleveland, she owned the Cardinals until selling off all her holdings in 
1917 to a group of investors, including her attorney James C. Jones and 
a local automobile dealer named Sam Breadon. Jones became chairman and 
Breadon purchased his shares for $200. At this point, there were no majority 
owners.[48][49][50] With limited financial resources, the club could ill-afford 
to sign the amount of the caliber of players required to field a competitive 
team. Kid Nichols briefly pitched and managed for the Cardinals, sporting 
a 2.02 ERA in 317 innings in 1904.[51] Player–manager (Second base) Miller 
Huggins twice led the league in walks and on-base percentage with .432 
in 1913.[52] Slim Sallee pitched for the Cardinals from 1908 to 1916, winning 
106 games with a 2.67 ERA while leading the league in shutouts twice.[53] 
Led by the surprising pitcher Bill Doak's and his spitball forerunning 
the NL with a 1.76 ERA, the 1914 team's third-place finish with a league-leading 
team 2.38 ERA caused a stir as a St. Louis team had not fared that well 
in the National League since 1876. It was also their best positional placement 
since 1891, a second-place finish in the final year of the American Association.[54][55] 
In addition to his ERA title, Doak finished second in shutouts (7) and 
wins (19). Throwing 30 career shutouts, he ranks second in franchise history.[56][57] 
However, the next year, Doak and the Cardinals failed to parlay their previous 
season's success as they lost nine more games and dropped into sixth place.[20] 
One bright spot was slugging second baseman Rogers Hornsby making his Major 
League début, who appeared in eighteen games.[58] Meanwhile, the fan-controlled 
club continued to lack a point man with substantial baseball operations 
experience to run the club. However, the club found their operations manager 
in 1917 when the Cardinals ownership group persuaded new Browns owner Phil 
Ball to release Branch Rickey, then-Browns president, from his contract 
to become president and business manager of the Cardinals.[49] Ball was 
contemptuous of Rickey's religious practices which influenced his approach 
to the game, and the two men frequently clashed as thus. In spite of the 
quarreling, Rickey was reluctant to joint the Cardinals as the club were 
notoriously undercapitalized and underachieving. However, another role 
as team president meant Rickey could stay in St. Louis to rear his growing 
family.[49][59] After dropping even further toward the bottom of the NL 
in 1916, the 1917 Cardinals toiled to match their third-place finish in 
1914.[20] Hornsby, entering his prime, led the NL in slugging percentage 
(.484) and OPS (.869) and rated his best defensive season at 3.5 wins above 
average.[58] Rickey frequently bickered with Huggins, who chafed over Rickey's 
theoretical approach to the game. After the season, the New York Yankees 
lured Huggins away to be their manager.[59] The Cardinals again flopped 
the next two seasons, finishing with a .395 and .394 winning percentage.[20] 
Breadon, a St. Louis Pierce-Arrow auto dealer who still owned a minority 
share, decided that he enjoyed his interaction with sports stars after 
meeting Hornsby at a baseball dinner in 1917. Through this point, he had 
conceded frequent requests for financial assistance but decided to raise 
his stake in the corporation to $2,000.[60] In part inquesting his own 
financial relief, Rickey took a commission in the Army from August to November 
1918 in World War I in France serving in the Chemical Warfare Service. 
He returned to a team that had only waded into even greater financial danger 
than before he left.[59][61] The club's financial burden was further strained 
as few stockholders were willing to invest more. One exception was Warren 
"Fuzzy" Anderson, Breadon's partner in the Pierce-Arrow dealership, who 
confided with him had more $15,000 invested in the Cardinals. Anderson 
decided he, too, wanted to invest more in the Cardinals. He requested financial 
assistance from Breadon who complied, loaning more than $18,000 to the 
franchise and for Anderson to purchase more stock.[60] After quickly acquiring 
some of the greatest fiscal investment in the club, Jones named Breadon 
as chairman of the board. Late in 1919, Jones asked him to accept the position 
as president of the team. Envisaging a possibility of frustrated control 
due to the number of persons comprising the board, Breadon demanded a condition 
that the number of members of the board be reduced from 25 to five. After 
a meeting, he accepted the position with a board membership that was reduced 
to seven, supplanting Rickey as team president.[62] Because Anderson held 
the second-largest share in the club, he reasoned that he should be named 
vice president. However, Breadon balked. Dejected at his refusal to share 
power, Anderson sold Breadon all his remaining stock, ending his baseball 
ownership career. Perceiving that Rickey may have been miffed at his removal 
from the position of team president, Breadon instead offered him the position 
of vice president, which he accepted. With a loan from Breadon, he purchased 
a stake in the team amounting to less than 20%. At this point, Rickey was 
firmly entrenched in nearly all front office decisions.[62] In 1919, to 
avoid paying a separate manager's salary, he appointed himself to succeed 
Jack Hendricks as field manager, who had quit.[20][59] He even borrowed 
items from his wife's stockpile of heirlooms to partially furnish his office.[59] 
Doak became credited for the modern design of the baseball glove after 
suggesting to Rawlings in 1919 that a web be laced between the thumb and 
forefinger to create a pocket that extended the surface by which the fielder 
could catch the ball.[63] Also that year, the league moved to ban pitching 
with the spitball due in part to it giving the pitcher an unfair advantage 
over the hitter. However, he helped lead an initiative to which the owners 
eventually agreed to a provision that allowed himself and 16 other spitballers 
to grandfather use of the pitch until the end of their careers.[64] Due 
to possessing an apparent genius for player development, Jones initially 
attempted to persuade Rickey to surrender his in-game managerial duties 
to concentrate fully on the front office. However, he insisted upon remaining 
the field manager while carrying on his front office duties and continued 
to do so until 1925. Breadon also recognized Rickey's acumen, and – along 
with his proclivity for signing players as cheaply as possible – the two 
men united into a mutually workable arrangement as one of Rickey's chief 
motives was also to sign as talented of players as inexpensively as possible. 
Unlike many owners who seemed content to dabble in front office affairs, 
Breadon was comfortable deferring the player management and development 
decisions to Rickey. This owner-executive combination catalyzed into one
