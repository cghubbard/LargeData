The New York Yankees' 1994 season was the 92nd season for the Yankees. 
New York was managed by Buck Showalter and played at Yankee Stadium. The 
team finished with a record of 70-43 finishing 6 1⁄2 games ahead of the 
Baltimore Orioles, having the best record in the American League and the 
second-best record in Major League Baseball.[1] The season was cut short 
by the infamous 1994 player's strike, which wiped out any postseason aspirations 
for their first postseason appearance since losing the 1981 World Series 
and that their star player and captain, Don Mattingly, had. On the day 
the strike began, the Yankees were on pace to win at least 100 games for 
the first time since 1980.[2] The Yankees' ace, 33-year-old veteran Jimmy 
Key, was leading the majors with 17 wins and was on pace to win 24 games.[1] 
Right fielder Paul O'Neill was also having a career year, as he was leading 
the league with a .359 batting average.[1] The strike is remembered bitterly 
by Yankees fans as it shook sports fans in New York City and the Yankees 
to the core and made 1994 one of the worst years in New York City sports 
history,[3] and has been named among the 10 worst moments in New York City 
sports history,[4] primarily because Mattingly had not played in a postseason.[5][6] 
It was also seen as the frustrating peak of the Yankees' demise and downfall 
of the 1980s and early 1990s.[3] When reacting to the strike, many fans 
said that the strike and the lost Yankees season was another to the blow 
to baseball backers in New York City, following the move of the Dodgers 
and the Giants to California for the 1958 season, the demise of the Yankees 
during the 1960s and early 1970s and 1980s and early 1990s, and the bad 
baseball at Shea Stadium during the late 1970s and early 1990s.[3] They 
also said it was the latest to the demise and downfall of the 1980s and 
early 1990s.[3] The strike ruined the chance for the Yankees to follow 
in the footsteps of the NHL Stanley Cup Champion Rangers and NBA Eastern 
Conference Champion Knicks by making the championship round of their respective 
sport. Because the Yankees were last in a postseason in a season cut short 
by a strike, the news media constantly reminded the Yankees about the parallels 
between the two Yankee teams (1981 and 1994), which included both Yankee 
teams having division leads taken away by strike.[7][8] Also, throughout 
October, they continued to bombard the Yankees, making speculations about 
what might have been if there had not been a strike, making references 
to the days games in the post-season would have been played.[9] By Friday, 
August 12, the Yankees had compiled a 70-43 record through 113 games. They 
were leading the AL East Division and had scored 670 runs (5.93 per game) 
and allowed 534 runs (4.73 per game).[17] The World Series, for which the 
Yankees appeared to be destined,[9] was never played and contributed to 
Buck Showalter being fired and Don Mattingly retiring after the 1995 season.[18] 
The 1994 New York Yankees team that could have been remains a hot discussion 
point in both baseball and in New York City because Mattingly had not played 
in a postseason.[19][20] When reacting to the strike's cancellation of 
the season, the first words many people on the Yankees, including Owner 
George Steinbrenner, General Manager Gene Michael, and Showalter all said 
was that they all felt bad for Mattingly, saying that he deserved a postseason.[21][22][23][24] 
Mattingly led active players in both games played and at bats without ever 
appearing in the postseason.[6] Yankees hitters were walked 530 times in 
the strike-shortened season: the most in the Majors. They also led the 
Majors in on-base percentage, with .374. They did, however, tie the San 
Diego Padres for the most double plays grounded into, with 112.[25] [1]
