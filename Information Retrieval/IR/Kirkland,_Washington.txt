Kirkland is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population 
was 87,281 at the 2015 census estimate, which made it the 6th largest city 
in King County and the 12th largest city in the state.[4] The city's downtown 
waterfront[6] has restaurants, art galleries, a performing arts center, 
public parks, beaches, and a collection of public art, primarily bronze 
sculptures. Kirkland is the former home of the Seattle Seahawks; the NFL 
team's headquarters and training facility were located at Northwest University 
prior to 2008. Warehouse chain Costco previously had its headquarters in 
Kirkland (now in Issaquah); the city is the namesake of its "Kirkland Signature" 
store brand. Google has a development office in Kirkland. The 1982 Kirkland 
National Little League team won the Little League World Series. That event 
is the subject of the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary Little Big Men. It also 
was the home to Little League's 1992 Big League Softball World Series Champions 
representing the Eastside District Nine Leagues. Since 1999 Kirkland has 
been the home of the Little League Junior Softball World Series held each 
August at Kirkland's Everest Park. The land around Lake Washington to the 
east of Seattle was first settled by Native Americans. English settlers 
arrived in the late 1860s, when the McGregor and Popham families built 
homesteads in what is now the Houghton neighborhood. Four miles (6 km) 
to the north people also settled near what is now called Juanita Bay, a 
favored campsite of the Natives because a wild potato, "wapatos", thrived 
there. The Curtis family arrived in the area in the 1870s, followed by 
the French family in 1872. The Forbes family homesteaded what is now Juanita 
Beach Park in 1876,[7] and settled on Rose Hill in 1877. Gradually, additional 
people settled in the area, and by the end of the 1880s, a small number 
of logging, farming and boat-building communities were established.[8] 
In 1886, Peter Kirk, a British-born enterprising businessman seeking to 
expand the family’s Moss Bay steel production company, moved to Washington 
after hearing that iron deposits had been discovered in the Cascade mountain 
range. Other necessary components such as limestone, needed in steel smelting, 
were readily available in the area. Further yet, a small number of coalmines 
(a required fuel source for steel mills) had recently been established 
nearby in Newcastle and train lines were already under construction. Plans 
were also underway to build the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Kirk realized 
that if a town were built near the water it would be a virtual freshwater 
port to the sea, as well as help support any prospective mill. At the time, 
however, Kirk was not a U.S. citizen and could not purchase any land. Leigh 
S.J. Hunt, then owner of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, offered to partner 
with Kirk and buy the necessary real estate. Under their new venture, the 
Kirkland Land and Development Company, Kirk and Hunt purchased thousands 
of acres of land in what is now Kirkland’s downtown in July 1888. Kirk 
and his associates started the construction of a new steel mill soon after, 
named Moss Bay Iron and Steel Company of America. After founding the city 
of Kirkland in 1888, officially one of the earliest on the Eastside at 
the time, Kirk’s vision of a "Pittsburgh of the West" was beginning to 
take form. Construction soon commenced on several substantial brick homes 
and business blocks that would house and serve the steel mill employees. 
However, the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway, which had recently 
been purchased by Tacoma-based Northern Pacific, had now refused to construct 
a rail line to the lake. This would, after all, have a negative impact 
on Tacoma, which was furiously competing with Seattle as the dominant Puget 
Sound seaport. The ensuing financial issues and numerous obstacles took 
a toll on Kirk, who was running out of investors. Hunt was also in debt 
from the purchase of land. Nevertheless, the plans continued and the steel 
mill was eventually completed in late 1892 on Rose Hill (a full two miles 
(3 km) from the lake's shore). Financial issues arose and due to the Panic 
of 1893 the mill subsequently closed without ever producing any steel. 
In spite of everything, Kirk was determined not to give up on his namesake 
town, and Kirkland was finally incorporated in 1905 with a population of 
approximately 532. A final attempt at a steel mill in Kirkland was planned 
by James A. Moore in 1906. His company, the Northwestern Iron & Steel Company 
paid $250,000 in cash for a 1,500-acre (6.1 km2) site but the mill never 
materialized. This came at the heels of the Pacific Steel Company, incorporated 
earlier in 1906 by J.F. Duthie, William Calvert and L.S. Cragin. This company 
soon amounted to nothing. In 1900 the Curtis family made a living operating 
a ferry-construction business on Lake Washington. Along with Captain John 
Anderson, the Curtises were among the first to run ferries in the area. 
Leschi, first operated on December 27, 1913, was the original wooden ferry 
to transport automobiles and people between the Eastside and Madison Park 
until her retirement in 1950. The ferry operations ran nearly continuously 
for 18 hours each day. The construction of the first Lake Washington floating 
bridge in 1940, however, made ferry service unprofitable and eventually 
led to its cancellation.[9] Subsequent years saw wool milling and warship 
building become the major industries. The first woolen mill in the state 
of Washington was built in Kirkland in 1892. The mill was the primary supplier 
of wool products for the Alaska Gold Rush prospectors and for the U.S. 
military during World War I.[citation needed] By 1917, after the completion 
of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, the construction of ocean-going vessels 
had become a major business. By 1940, the thriving Lake Washington Shipyard 
had constructed more than 25 warships during World War II for the U.S. 
Navy, on what is now Carillon Point. Since the incorporation of Kirkland 
in 1905, the city has grown to approximately 12 times its original geographic 
boundaries, nearly doubling in size during the 1940s and 1960s. Kirkland 
consolidated with the neighboring town of Houghton on July 31, 1968 to 
form one city of 13,500. It annexed the neighborhood of Totem Lake in 1974, 
and the neighborhoods of South Juanita, North Rose Hill, and South Rose 
Hill in 1988, which were the largest annexations undertaken in Washington 
in nearly two decades. This added a further 16,119 people to Kirkland's 
population and was responsible for 76 percent of Kirkland's population 
increase between 1980 and 1990. On November 3, 2009, responding to a county 
initiative to encourage cities to annex or incorporate many of the unincorporated 
areas within the county,[10] as well as a state sales tax incentive intended 
to ease the process,[11] three previously unincorporated districts north 
of the City—Finn Hill, Juanita, and Kingsgate—voted on whether to annex 
to Kirkland. The measure failed by seven votes to reach the 60% margin, 
which was required because the measure included accepting a share of the 
city's voter-approved debt.[12] However, since the affirmative vote was 
over 50%, the city council could and did vote to accept the annexation, 
without the assumption of debt. [13] The annexation added 33,000 residents 
(combined total population of around 80,000)[14] and nearly 7 square miles 
(18 km2)[15] to Kirkland on June 1, 2011. The city of Kirkland has designated 
three buildings as city landmarks.[16] Kirkland is located at 47°41′9″N
