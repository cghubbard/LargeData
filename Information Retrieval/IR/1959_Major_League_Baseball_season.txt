The 1959 Major League Baseball season saw the Los Angeles Dodgers, free 
of the strife produced by their move from Brooklyn the previous season, 
rebound to win the National League pennant after a two-game playoff against 
the Milwaukee Braves, who themselves had moved from Boston in 1953. The 
Dodgers won the World Series against a Chicago White Sox team that had 
not played in the "Fall Classic" since 1919 and was interrupting a Yankees’ 
dynasty that dominated the American League between 1949 and 1964. The season 
is notable as the only one between 1950 and 1981 where no pitcher pitched 
a no-hitter.[1][a] a Other Major League Baseball seasons since 1901 without 
a no-hitter pitched are 1909, 1913, 1921, 1927–1928, 1932–1933, 1936, 1939,
