Peter Michael "Pete" Kozma (born April 11, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball shortstop in the New York Yankees organization. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals 
selected him in the first round of the 2007 amateur draft from Owasso High 
School in Oklahoma, and he made his MLB debut for them on May 18, 2011. 
He is 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m), weighs 170 pounds (77 kg), and bats and 
throws right-handed. A sure-handed defender with excellent range and throwing 
arm, Kozma primarily plays shortstop. In the 2012 National League Division 
Series against the Washington Nationals, his hit in the deciding game drove 
in the go-ahead run and allowed the Cardinals to advance to the National 
League Championship Series. Prior to playing professionally, he attended 
Owasso High School in Owasso, Oklahoma.[citation needed] Kozma was drafted 
by the Cardinals in the first round of the 2007 amateur draft out of Owasso, 
and began his professional career that year. In his first professional 
season, Kozma played for three minor league teams - the Johnson City Cardinals 
(30 games), GCL Cardinals (four games) and Batavia Muckdogs (eight games). 
Overall, he hit .233 with two home runs and 11 runs batted in (RBIs) in 
42 games that season. He played for the Quad Cities River Bandits (99 games) 
and Palm Beach Cardinals (24 games) in 2008, hitting a combined .258 with 
five home runs and 50 RBI in 123 games. He also stole 12 bases in 18 attempts. 
In 2009, he split the season between Palm Beach (18 games) and the Springfield 
Cardinals (113 games), hitting .231 with six home runs and 45 RBI in 131 
games. He played for Springfield in 2010, hitting .243 with 13 home runs 
and 72 RBI in 132 games. He also stole 13 bases in 15 tries.[1] On May 
18, 2011, Kozma was called up from the AAA Memphis Redbirds, with whom 
he hit .214 in 112 games, to the major league club to replace injured middle 
infielder Nick Punto. He made his major league debut that night, and hit 
a double with a RBI in his first at-bat when pinch-hitting in the 5th at 
Busch Stadium. Kozma was part of the Cardinals postseason roster when the 
team won the 2011 World Series over the Texas Rangers. Kozma was optioned 
to Triple-A to begin the 2012 season. He was recalled to the Cardinals 
on August 31, 2012 when Rafael Furcal was placed on the disabled list.[2] 
Kozma singled to give the Cardinals the deciding runs in the winner-take-all 
fifth game of the 2012 National League Division Series (NLDS) over the 
Washington Nationals.[3] During the NLDS, he hit a home run – his first 
in an MLB postseason – and drove in five runners. Kozma batted .227 during 
the NLCS against the San Francisco Giants and added a stolen base. Despite 
attaining a 3-games-to-1 advantage in the series, the Cardinals lost the 
Series in the 7th and deciding game. Kozma became the Cardinals' primary 
shortstop in 2013 and finished with a .217 batting average, 20 doubles, 
a home run and three stolen bases in 143 games. They secured the best record 
in the National League, thus making the playoffs. He provided a key defensive 
play in the sixth inning of Game 3 of the NLDS against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Dodgers batter Juan Uribe hit a rapid ground ball in the hole, 
which Kozma backhanded and relayed to second baseman Matt Carpenter, tipping 
off an inning ending double play. The Cardinals won the game, 4–2.[4] The 
Cardinals won the NLCS to advance to the World Series. In Game 1 of the 
World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Kozma was involved in a controversial 
error/blown call that was overturned by the umpiring crew. He mishandled 
and dropped a ball tossed to him that would have commenced an inning-ending 
double play. Red Sox manager John Farrell leapt of the dugout, confronted 
umpire Dana DeMuth and requested that the umpire crew get together and 
make a group decision on the ruling. The umpires ultimately ruled that 
Kozma never had control of the ball, and the inning continued. Boston went 
on to score three runs that inning, and eventually went on to win the championship 
in six games. The following offseason, the Cardinals signed longtime American 
League player Jhonny Peralta as a free agent to upgrade their offense at 
shortstop, thus supplanting Kozma from his short-lived status as the starter.[5] 
The Cardinals signed Mark Ellis, another free agent, and kept rookie second 
baseman Kolten Wong on the MLB roster for much of the season. Those three 
moves relegated Kozma to spending most of 2014 playing for Memphis, where 
he hit .248 with eight home runs and 59 RBI. The Cardinals recalled him 
when MLB rosters expand in September, and, in fourteen games, hit .304 
with three doubles. The club won the National League Central division, 
assuring a playoff berth for the fourth time in his four seasons with the 
club. He was a last-minute addition to the postseason roster for the NLDS 
against the Dodgers.[6] The following spring training, Kozma resumed working 
out at all infield positions, and added time as a catcher.[7] On June 25, 
2015, against the Miami Marlins, he scored on a double from Kolten Wong. 
He had three hits and reached base in four plate appearances,[8] snapping 
an 0–21 streak that dated back to May 19.[9] Kozma totaled 99 at bats for 
the season, batting .152 with a .236 on-base percentage and no extra base 
hits. The Cardinals removed him from the 40-man roster after the season 
and reassigned him to Memphis,[10] after which the New York Yankees signed
