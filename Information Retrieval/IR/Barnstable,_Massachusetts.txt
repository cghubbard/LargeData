Barnstable /ˈbɑːrnˌstəbəl/ is a city,[1] referred to as the Town of Barnstable,[2] 
in the U.S. state of Massachusetts and the county seat of Barnstable County.[3] 
Barnstable is the largest community, both in land area and population, 
on Cape Cod. At the 2010 census it had a population of 45,193.[4] The town 
contains several villages (one of which is also named Barnstable) within 
its boundaries.[5] Its largest village, Hyannis, is the central business 
district of the county and home to Barnstable Municipal Airport, the airline 
hub of Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Additionally, 
Barnstable is a 2007 winner of the All-America City Award. Barnstable takes 
its name from Barnstaple, Devon, England. The area was first explored by 
Bartholomew Gosnold in 1602. It was one of the first towns to be settled 
in Plymouth Colony, one year behind Sandwich, in 1638, and was incorporated 
in 1639. The early settlers were farmers, led by the Reverend Joseph Hull, 
the founder of Barnstable.[6] A memorial tablet was dedicated there in 
1939 (the 300th anniversary of the town's founding) marking the site of 
his home, and the rock from which he preached still stands along the highway 
there.[7][8][9] Soon after the town's founding, agriculture, fishing and 
salt works became its major industries. By the end of the 19th century, 
there were some 804 ships harbored in the town. But this came to a decline 
with the rise of the railroad, which had arrived in 1854, and of steamships. 
By the late 19th century, however, Barnstable was becoming world-renowned 
as the tourist destination it is to this day. Many prominent Bostonians 
spent their summers on the Cape shores, as did Presidents Ulysses S. Grant 
and Grover Cleveland. However, the most famous family to summer in the 
town was, and remains, the Kennedy family, who can still be found living 
in the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port. It was the summer home of President 
John F. Kennedy during his administration, and it was likewise the home 
of Senator Ted Kennedy until his death. Today, tourists come in droves 
to the town during the summer months. There is abundant shopping in the 
quaint shops of Hyannis, and other popular sites abound, such as the John 
F. Kennedy Museum and several other museums and places on the National 
Register of Historic Places, including the Ancient Burying Ground and Gideon 
Hawley House. The town's many beaches are popular tourist destinations 
as well.[10] Barnstable is located at 41°39′33″N 70°21′11″W﻿ / ﻿41.65917°N

government. It was created when the Town rewrote its charter and moved 
from a selectmen-town meeting form of government to a town council form 
of government in 1989. Barnstable is one of fourteen Massachusetts municipalities 
that have applied for, and been granted, city forms of government but wish 
to retain "the town of” in their official names.[16] The first town manager, 
Warren Rutherford, was in office from 1990-1997. His successor, James Tinsley, 
was in office from 1997 to 1999, when he died from a heart attack. He was 
succeeded by former state representative John C. Klimm. Klimm had his contract 
bought-out in 2011 due to internal disputes among a majority of the Barnstable 
Town Council. Thomas K. Lynch has served as the Town Manager since 2011. 
The town hall is located within the village of Hyannis, and the police 
station is located on Route 132, closer to the geographic center of town. 
There are eight fire stations, seven libraries and ten post offices located 
throughout the town, with the largest or central branches usually being 
in the downtown Hyannis area. Hyannis also is the site of the Cape Cod 
Hospital, which serves the central Cape region. Also, as the county seat 
of Barnstable County, the town is the site of the county courthouse and 
juvenile lockup at the old House of Corrections, as well as the Offices 
of the Cape and Islands District Attorney. Barnstable is represented in

the largest public school enrollment of any city or town on Cape Cod,[citation 
needed] with over 5,000 students. In 2010, the public school system underwent 
major changes due to budgetary constraints. The presently operational schools 
include: the Enoch Cobb Early Learning Center for pre-school students and 
five elementary schools serving various grades, including: Centerville 
Elementary School (K-3), Barnstable Community Horace Mann Public Charter 
School (formerly Hyannis East Elementary School) (K-3), West Villages Elementary 
School (formerly Marstons Mills East Elementary School) (K-3), Hyannis 
West Elementary School (K-3), and Barnstable-West Barnstable Elementary 
School (K-3). The Barnstable United Elementary School (formerly Barnstable 
Horace Mann Charter School) serves the Town's fourth and fifth grade students. 
The Barnstable Intermediate School (formerly Barnstable Middle School) 
serves grades six and seven. Barnstable High School serves grades eight 
through twelve. Barnstable's athletic teams are nicknamed the Red Raiders 
(using a logo similar to that of the University of Utah), and their colors 
are red and white. Their teams are highly successful because of the large 
student body from which to choose players. Notable town rivals of the Red 
Raiders are Dennis/Yarmouth and Falmouth. Barnstable has played Falmouth 
in football on Thanksgiving Day nearly every year since 1895, making the 
annual game one of the longest-standing high school football rivalries 
in history. In addition to its public schools, there are also several private 
schools in Barnstable. There are five Christian schools, three of which
