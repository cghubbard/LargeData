John Joseph "Joe" Gerhardt (February 14, 1855 – March 11, 1922), also known 
as "Move 'Em Up Joe",[1] was an American professional baseball player whose 
career spanned from 1873 to 1893. He played 15 seasons in Major League 
Baseball, primarily as a second baseman, for 11 different major league 
clubs. Gerhardt was born in 1855 in Washington, D.C.[1] His father, Joseph 
Gerhardt, was an immigrant from Prussia who was in the restaurant business 
and was a Colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War. His 
mother, Dorah, was an immigrant from the Hesse Cassel, which is now part 
of Germany.[2] Gerhardt played five seasons in Louisville, Kentucky, for 
the Grays (1876–77), Eclipse (1883-84) and Colonels (1891), and five seasons 
in New York City for the Mutuals (1875), Giants (1885–87), Metropolitans 
(1887) and Gladiators (1890). Across all 15 major league seasons, he appeared 
in 1,078 games, 893 as a second baseman, 85 as a third baseman, 63 as a 
first baseman, and 33 as a shortstop.[1] Gerhardt was a weak hitter, compiling 
a .227 career batting average, but he was known as one of the best defensive 
second baseman of his era.[3] He twice led his league in assists at any 
position and regularly ranked among the league leaders in putouts. double 
plays and fielding percentage by a second baseman between 1877 and 1890. 
His career range factor of 6.46 remains the highest in major league history 
for a second baseman. He also ranks eighth among all second basemen in 
major league history with 558 errors at second base.[1] In a 1922 story 
on Gerhardt, New York sports writer John M. Foster compared Gerhardt to 
baseball's other great second basemen and concluded: "None had anything 
on Move Em Up Joe Gerhardt."[4] Gerhardt became a player-manager on two 
different occasions: in 1883, for the Louisville Colonels, and in 1890, 
for the St. Louis Browns. His managerial record totaled 72 wins against 
61 losses.[5] Gerhardt's nickname, "Move 'Em Up Joe" came from his war 
cry, "Move 'em up", which he would shout from the bench or base line when 
his teammates were on base. Gerhardt was an early advocate of the sacrifice 
play to move base runners forward. Upon Gerhardt's death, New York sports 
writer John M. Foster went so far as to call Gerhardt the "original inventor 
of the sacrifice theory in baseball."[4] In 1900, Gerhardt was living in 
Manhattan with his wife Edith and was employed as a hotel manager.[6] By 
1910, Gerhardt and his wife had moved to Liberty, New York, where Gerhardt 
was the proprietor of a liquor retail business. Gerhardt and his wife at 
that time had a daughter, Alva, living with them.[7] Gerhardt later lived 
in Middletown, Orange County, New York. As of 1919, he was employed in 
N. D. Mills' cigar store.[8] At the time of the 1920 Census, he was living 
in Middletown with his wife, Edith, and daughter, Alva, and was employed 
as a salesman in a cigar store.[9] Gerhardt died from a sudden heart attack 
in Middletown at age 67.[10] The attack reportedly struck him in front 
of the Middletown post office as he was walking to work after having been 
ill for a week.[4] He was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Washington,
