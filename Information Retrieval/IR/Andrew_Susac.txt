Andrew John Susac (born March 22, 1990) is an American professional baseball 
catcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously 
played for the San Francisco Giants. Susac played college baseball at Oregon 
State University. Susac attended Jesuit High School in Carmichael, California, 
where he played for the school's baseball team as a catcher. He signed 
a letter of intent with Oregon State University to play college baseball 
for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team, but was also coveted by Major 
League Baseball (MLB) organizations.[1] Baseball America rated Susac as 
the 40th best available player in the upcoming 2009 MLB Draft.[2] After 
Susac graduated from Jesuit, the Philadelphia Phillies selected Susac in 
the 16th round of the draft. Susac opted not to sign, instead enrolling 
at Oregon State.[3] Eligible for the 2011 MLB Draft, the San Francisco 
Giants selected Susac in the second round. Susac signed with the Giants, 
receiving a $1.1 million signing bonus.[4] The Giants assigned Susac to 
the San Jose Giants of the Class A-Advanced California League in 2012 and 
the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern League in 2013. He 
hit .256 in Richmond with 12 home runs and 46 RBIs, earning an Eastern 
League All-Star selection,[5] and was invited to the Arizona Fall League, 
where he adjusted his swing and improved to hit .360 with two home runs 
and 11 walks in 17 games.[6] Susac was listed as MLB.com's #3 prospect 
in the Giants organization for 2014.[7] Susac began the 2014 season with 
the Fresno Grizzlies of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, where he batted 
.268 in 63 games through July 26.[8] The Giants called Susac up to the 
major league club late on July 25, 2014, to replace backup catcher Héctor 
Sánchez after Sánchez showed concussion symptoms.[8][9][10] Susac flew 
to San Francisco the next morning and played his first MLB game that evening 
vs. the Los Angeles Dodgers, grounding out to third base in a single at-bat 
against Clayton Kershaw who shut out the Giants that day.[8] Susac got 
his first major league hit, a single, on July 30, 2014,[11][12] and his 
first major-league home run (a two-run homer) at Wrigley Field against 
Chicago Cubs pitcher Edwin Jackson on August 20, 2014.[13] However, Susac 
later played in the September 1 continuation of the Giants vs. Colorado 
Rockies game from May 22 (over three months earlier), which was suspended 
by rain, and due to MLB's record-keeping rules, May 22 is the date given 
for his official MLB debut.[14] Susac also singled to left field and was 
later driven home by a double from Hunter Pence.[15] Because the game was 
a continuation, May 22 is also the official date for Susac's first hit 
and first run scored, and with a swinging strikeout later in the same game 
his batting average was briefly .500.[16] Susac finished the regular season 
with three home runs and 19 RBIs, batting .273 in 35 games played. Susac 
was the Giants' backup catcher behind Buster Posey during the 2014 postseason. 
He appeared in four games, batting 1-for-4 (.250) as the Giants won the 
2014 World Series. In 2015, Susac was the only Giants prospect in Baseball 
America's top 100 list.[17] However, he was set back in Spring Training 
with a tooth infection and wrist injury and subsequently started the season 
in AAA Sacramento.[18] Susac was called up to the Giants on April 18 when 
Jake Peavy went on the disabled list.[19] On June 27, Susac hit a bases-loaded 
double that drove in three runs and helped the Giants come from behind 
to defeat the Colorado Rockies 7–5.[20] In late June, Susac was named the 
Giants' regular catcher as the team dealt with outfield injuries that pushed 
Buster Posey to first base and Brandon Belt to left field.[21] On July 
18, Susac sprained his right thumb while sliding into third base and was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list.[22] Susac was activated on August 17,[23] 
but was shut down for the season on September 5 due to lingering effects 
from the wrist sprain suffered in Spring Training.[24] He underwent surgery 
on his wrist to remove bone fragments and address inflammation.[25] In 
2015, Susac appeared in 52 games, batting .218 with 3 home runs and 14 
RBIs. During spring training, Susac was set back by his sore right wrist 
and was optioned to Triple-A Sacramento to start the season.[26] Susac 
had 36 RBIs in 58 games for Sacramento before being traded along with the 
Giants top minor league prospect and 2015 First Round draft pick pitcher 
Phil Bickford to the Milwaukee Brewers for relief pitcher Will Smith on
