The 1967 Atlanta Braves season was the Braves' second season in Atlanta. 
The team went 77–85, as they suffered their first losing season since 1952, 
the franchise's final season in Boston. The seventh-place Braves finished 
24½ games behind the National League and World Series Champion St. Louis 
Cardinals. The Braves' worst season since 1952—their last year in their 
original home of Boston—cost manager Billy Hitchcock his job on September 
28, 1967; the team stood at 77–82 (.484) and 21 1⁄2 games in arrears of 
the eventual 1967 World Champion St. Louis Cardinals at the time. Bullpen 
coach Ken Silvestri took over the club for the final three games of the 
season (all losses) on an interim basis. Hitchcock's firing enabled general 
manager Paul Richards, on the job in Atlanta for only 13 months, to name 
his own man as skipper for 1968, and he chose a veteran associate, Luman 
Harris, 52, as Hitchcock's permanent successor.[6] Harris had played with 
Richards with the minor league Atlanta Crackers in the 1930s, and coached 
for Richards with three MLB clubs; he had also managed under GM Richards 
with the 1965 Houston Astros. Harris had been the 1967 skipper of the Triple-A 
Richmond Braves, and had led them to the best record in the International 
League. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
