Robin R. Yount (/ˈjɒnt/; nicknamed,"The Kid", and "Rockin' Robin", born 
September 16, 1955) is an American former professional baseball player. 
He spent his entire 20-year career in Major League Baseball as a shortstop 
and center fielder for the Milwaukee Brewers (1974–1993). After growing 
up in California, Yount spent a couple of months in minor league baseball 
and advanced to the major leagues at the age of 18. He won two American 
League Most Valuable Player awards. In his best season, 1982, the Brewers 
made a World Series appearance. In 1999, Yount was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Since his retirement as 
a player, Yount has held several roles as a baseball coach. Yount was born 
in Danville, Illinois. Yount lived briefly in Covington, Indiana, but his 
family moved to southern California when he was an infant; his father had 
gotten a job testing rocket engines with Rocketdyne.[1] Robin attended 
William Howard Taft High School in Woodland Hills.[2] Yount was the third 
pick overall in the June 1973 Major League Baseball draft, one slot ahead 
of fellow Hall of Famer and 3,000 Hit Club member Dave Winfield. Yount 
made his major league debut the following April, at eighteen years old. 
After going hitless in his first four games, Yount hit a game-winning home 
run in his sixth. Yount is currently the last 18-year-old to hit a home 
run in the Major Leagues (Andruw Jones and Bryce Harper are the two most 
current teenagers to have hit Major League home runs, but did so as 19-year-olds). 
On September 14, 1975 (two days before his 20th birthday), Yount broke 
Mel Ott's 47-year-old record for most games played in the major leagues 
before turning 20. Yount courted controversy in the winter of 1978. He 
threatened to retire from the game and take up professional golf rather 
than be underpaid or moved to the outfield by the Brewers. Early in the 
season, Paul Molitor was called up from the Brewers Class A affiliate to 
the major league team because of Yount's absence. Yount's demands were 
met; when he returned to the team, Molitor was moved from shortstop to 
second base to make room for Yount.[3] He was an early proponent of weight 
training – then uncommon in baseball – and by 1980 Yount's power hitting 
had improved, particularly for a shortstop. Yount was an All-Star in 1980, 
1982, and 1983. No other Brewer was voted a starter in consecutive years 
until Ryan Braun started each year between 2008 and 2011.[4] Yount led 
the American League with 210 hits in 1982. The 1982 AL East race was tied 
on the final day of the season, with the race coming down to a winner-take-all 
game between the Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles. With the title on the 
line, Yount hit home runs in each of his first two at-bats against Orioles 
starter Jim Palmer. Yount finished with a four-hit game, as the Brewers 
won 10-2. In addition to his only 200-hit season, he registered career 
highs with 29 home runs, 114 RBI, and a .331 batting average (.001 behind 
the league leader, Willie Wilson). Yount finished with a .578 slugging 
percentage and .957 OPS on his way to gaining 367 total bases – leading 
the major leagues in all three categories.[5] His slugging percentage was 
the second highest ever by a shortstop, and his 129 runs set the record 
for that position.[6] That year, Yount also won his only Gold Glove Award 
and his first Most Valuable Player Award. His performance garnered 27 of 
28 possible first place votes in the 1982 MVP balloting.[7] The year ended 
with the Brewers making their only World Series appearance. Although Yount 
became the only player in history to have two 4-hit games in one World 
Series, Milwaukee lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Yount 
batted .414 in the Series, with one home run and 6 RBI's. In 1985, a shoulder 
problem forced Yount to move to the outfield.[8] After splitting time between 
center field and left field, Yount became the Brewers' regular center fielder 
in 1986. He played more than 1,200 games in the outfield in his career, 
with a .990 fielding percentage. He made a game-ending, diving catch to 
preserve a no-hitter by Juan Nieves early in the 1987 season. Yount narrowly 
won a second MVP Award in 1989, making him only the third player to win 
MVPs at two positions, joining Hank Greenberg and Stan Musial (Alex Rodriguez 
would later join this group).[8] Yount was the first AL player to win multiple 
MVP's in over twenty-five years, since the Yankees' Roger Maris (1960 & 
1961) and Mickey Mantle (1956, 1957, and 1962). Yount collected more hits 
(1731) in the decade of the 1980s than any other player.[9] After the 1989 
season, Yount was a free agent and he spoke with several teams about contract 
offers. The California Angels were prepared to make a serious offer,[10] 
but Yount signed a three-year contract with the Brewers worth $9.6 million 
in February 1990.[11] In 1991, Yount was briefly on the disabled list (DL) 
with a kidney stone, only the second stint on the DL in his career; the 
first one was in 1978.[12] On September 9, 1992, Yount collected his 3,000th 
career hit, becoming the 17th player (and the third youngest) to reach 
the mark.[13] He announced his retirement after the 1993 season. The Brewers 
retired his number the next year.[14] Yount was elected to the Wisconsin 
Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1999, his first year of eligibility. That same year, he was included 
in the balloting for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, finishing 
fifth among shortstops.[15] Yount holds Brewers career records for games, 
at-bats, runs, hits, doubles, triples, RBIs, total bases, walks and strikeouts. 
He was the last active major leaguer to have been a teammate of Hank Aaron 
(1975–1976). He posted a career .285 batting average with 251 home runs, 
1632 runs scored and 1406 runs batted in. His 11,008 career at-bats is 
the seventh-most in Major League Baseball history, and he ranks 17th on 
the all-time hit list. His three All-Star appearances are tied with Ferguson 
Jenkins for the second-fewest of any Hall of Famer from the post-All-Star 
Game era, and he won a second MVP Award in 1989 without making the All-Star 
Team. Yount served as first base coach and bench coach for the Arizona 
Diamondbacks from 2002 to 2004. He resigned after the dismissal of Arizona 
manager Bob Brenly.[16] He, Hank Aaron, Warren Spahn and Bob Uecker threw 
out the ceremonial first pitches at the 2002 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game at Miller Park. In 2005, Brewers manager Ned Yost convinced Dale Sveum, 
a teammate of Yount's, to become Milwaukee's new third base coach. Yount 
followed suit a few weeks later, accepting a post as the Brewers' bench 
coach.[16] In November 2006, Yount announced he would not return to the 
team as bench coach for the 2007 season. However, on September 15, 2008 
Sveum, by now the team's manager, chose Yount as his bench coach.[17] In 
2012, when Sveum was named the Chicago Cubs new manager, rumors quickly 
spread that Sveum would ask Yount to coach with him, even though the Brewers 
and Cubs had become bitter rivals. Sveum very quickly confirmed that he 
was not even considering such a move. As of 2014, Yount is a special instructor 
in spring training for the Brewers.[18] Yount met his wife Michele at Taft 
High School and they have been married since 1979.[19] Yount's brother 
Larry was a pitcher and was briefly called up to play in the major leagues. 
While taking his warmup tosses for his debut as a Houston Astros reliever 
in 1971, he experienced elbow pain.[20] He never threw an official pitch 
in any MLB game. Yount's son Dustin played baseball in the minor leagues 
for several years.[21] Yount's nephew Austin Yount played professional 
baseball for the Dodgers organization. Another nephew, Cody Yount, played 
college baseball for Pepperdine University.[22] Since retiring from baseball, 
Yount has increased his participation in two of his other passions, professional 
motorcycle and auto racing.[8] In June 2008, Yount announced the creation 
of a new all-natural lemonade drink, Robinade. A portion of the proceeds 
of the sales goes to charity.[23] Yount sometimes goes hunting with Sveum. 
While hunting in Arizona in 2012, Yount accidentally shot Sveum with pellets 
in the back and ear. Sveum's injuries were minor.[24] In 2012, Yount became 
a minority owner of the Lakeshore Chinooks of the Northwoods League, a 
collegiate summer baseball league. The Chinooks play at Kapco Park at Concordia 
University Wisconsin where the right field fence is 319 feet in his honor.[25]
