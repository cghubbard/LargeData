The 1986 World Series pitted the National League champions New York Mets 
against the American League champions Boston Red Sox. The Mets won the 
Series in the seventh game, after overcoming a nearly hopeless deficit 
in Game 6 — a game in which the Red Sox were twice one strike away from 
victory and that ended on a famous error by Boston's first baseman Bill 
Buckner after their lead had already been blown. Game 6 has been cited 
in the legend of the "Curse of the Bambino" to explain the major comeback.[1][2][3] 
The New York Mets finished the regular season with a franchise record 108–54, 
winning the National League East division by 21 1⁄2 games over division 
rival Philadelphia Phillies.[4][5][6] They then won a tightly contested 
1986 National League Championship Series, four games to two, over the Houston 
Astros, clinching the series in a sixteen-inning Game 6. The talent of 
the team was colored by controversy during much of the season, with scrappy 
players both on and off the field. On July 19, 1986, Mets infielder Tim 
Teufel and pitchers Rick Aguilera, Bobby Ojeda, and Ron Darling were arrested 
after fighting with policemen outside a bar in Houston. Just three days 
later, they played a game which became a microcosm of their season when 
two Mets were ejected after a bench-clearing brawl. A total of three ejections 
in the game forced starting catcher Gary Carter to play third base, and 
the Mets to play a pitcher in the outfield, with left-hander Jesse Orosco 
and righty Roger McDowell alternating between the pitcher's mound and the 
outfield as needed. Despite the adversity, they still won the game in the 
fourteenth inning on a three-run homer by Howard Johnson.[7] Former NL 
MVP George Foster was released a few days after the game, based partly 
on his refusal to move from the Mets' bench during the fracas.[citation 
needed] Boston went 95–66 during the season, winning the American League 
East division by 5 1⁄2 games over their biggest nemesis, the New York Yankees.[8] 
The gritty play of eventual ALCS MVP Marty Barrett and Rich Gedman; clutch 
hitting from veterans Jim Rice, Wade Boggs, Don Baylor, Dwight Evans and 
Dave Henderson; and quality starting pitching, especially from 1986 American 
League MVP and Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, Bruce Hurst and Oil 
Can Boyd, pushed the Red Sox to the World Series. The team's defining moment 
occurred in Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against 
the California Angels. With the Angels leading three games to one in the 
best-of-seven series and their top reliever Donnie Moore on the mound, 
the Sox needed a last-out miracle home run from Henderson to survive Game 5; 
they later loaded the bases and got the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly 
from Henderson off Moore in the eleventh. The Angels never recovered from 
this blow, and with Boston capitalizing on some defensive miscues by the 
Angels, and clutch performances by some of their big name players (namely 
Rice and Clemens in the deciding game), the Red Sox clinched the pennant 
with a seven-game win. NL New York Mets (4) beat AL Boston Red Sox (3) 
†: postponed from October 26 due to rain In the opener, Boston's Bruce 
Hurst dazzled the New Yorkers with his looping curve and forkball, allowing 
only four hits over eight innings, and getting Ray Knight to ground into 
an inning-ending double play to escape trouble in the bottom of the sixth 
inning. New York's Ron Darling was equally effective, yielding only an 
unearned run in the seventh inning when Mets second baseman Tim Teufel 
committed an error eerily similar to the one committed by Félix Millán 
in Game 1 of the 1973 World Series that allowed two unearned runs to score 
in Oakland's 2–1 victory over the Mets. Red Sox closer Calvin Schiraldi 
walked Darryl Strawberry to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning, giving 
Mets fans visions of a rally. However, Schiraldi got Ray Knight to force 
Strawberry at second base, and got Wally Backman to fly out to left field. 
With two outs, Danny Heep was called upon to bat for weak-hitting shortstop 
Rafael Santana. Schiraldi worked him to a 2–2 count, and got Heep to swing 
at the last pitch for a strikeout and a save. Just as they did in the League 
Championship Series against Houston, the Mets opened the series with a 
1–0 defeat. (Mets legend Tom Seaver, as a member of the Red Sox, got a 
large standing ovation from the Shea Stadium fans during the Game 1 introductions. 
Seaver did not pitch in the series because of injury.) After dropping the 
first game, the Mets turned to young phenom Dwight Gooden in what figured 
to be a classic matchup with Boston's own young pitching sensation Roger 
Clemens. That duel did not materialize, as neither pitcher went beyond 
five innings. The Red Sox drew first blood in the top of the third inning, 
when after a leadoff walk to Spike Owen, Keith Hernandez fielded a Clemens 
bunt, but threw it away trying to catch Owen at second base. This was costly, 
as Wade Boggs drove in Owen with a double, Marty Barrett drove in Clemens 
with a single, and Bill Buckner drove in Boggs with a single to give the 
Sox a 3–0 lead. The Mets struck back in the bottom half of the inning, 
putting runners on second and third base for Wally Backman. Backman grounded 
one up the middle, plating Rafael Santana, and Hernandez grounded out, 
allowing Gooden to score and bring the Mets within one run. However, Dave 
Henderson, the hero of the ALCS, drove the second pitch from Gooden in 
the top of the fourth inning to left-center field for a home run. Dwight 
Evans followed with a two-run home run in the top of the fifth inning, 
bringing the score to 6–2. Although Clemens had a comfortable lead going 
into the bottom of the fifth inning, he was pulled in favor of Steve Crawford 
after facing three batters, leaving runners on the corners. Crawford promptly 
gave up a single to Gary Carter that sent Backman home, cutting the lead 
to three runs. Crawford struck out Darryl Strawberry and got Danny Heep 
to ground out to quash any threat, but this left Clemens ineligible to 
receive a decision in the game. Gooden was gone after five innings, being 
relieved by Rick Aguilera in the sixth inning. Aguilera loaded the bases 
in the seventh inning, and after consecutive RBI singles by Henderson and 
Owen, was pulled in favor of Jesse Orosco, who shut down the Red Sox over 
the next two innings. The Red Sox were not done, however. Facing Sid Fernandez, 
pitching in relief with runners on first and second base in the ninth inning, 
Boggs drove in Henderson with a double to make the score 9–3. The Mets 
were unable to recover from this deficit, and took the loss, giving Boston 
a 2–0 advantage heading to Fenway Park. The Mets bounced back from their 
early-series sluggishness in the top of the first inning, when Lenny Dykstra 
led off with a home run to give the Mets an early lead. Gary Carter followed 
with an RBI double, and Danny Heep drove in two runners with a single to 
give the Mets a 4–0 lead in the first inning. After the rocky start, Red 
Sox starter Oil Can Boyd settled down, but Bob Ojeda pitched well and Boston 
was unable to overcome their early deficit. In his first at bat in the 
World Series, Don Baylor almost homered in the second inning but it turned 
out to be a double off the Green Monster. Ojeda gave up an RBI single to 
Marty Barrett in the bottom of the third inning, but this would prove to 
be the only Boston run of the game. Carter drove in two runners with a 
single in the seventh inning, and Ray Knight drove in Darryl Strawberry 
with a double in the eighth inning. Roger McDowell pitched the final two 
frames to seal a 7–1 Mets victory. Ron Darling faced off against Al Nipper, 
as the Mets looked to tie the Series. Neither starter allowed a run until 
the top of the fourth inning, when Gary Carter ripped a two-run home run 
over the Green Monster and Ray Knight drove in Darryl Strawberry with a 
single. Lenny Dykstra came through with a two-run home run of his own in 
the top of the seventh inning, and Carter hit a solo shot in the top of 
the eighth inning. The Red Sox did not go quietly, scoring two runs on 
a Dwight Evans single and a Dave Henderson sacrifice fly in the eighth 
inning, but it was not enough, and the Mets evened the series at two games 
apiece. Mets ace Dwight Gooden once again struggled, this time surrendering 
four runs on nine hits in just four innings. Despite a strong relief effort 
from Sid Fernandez, Bruce Hurst was dominant again, allowing ten hits and 
just two runs in a complete game win to give Boston a 3–2 series lead heading 
back to New York. In Game 6,[16] Boston took a quick 2–0 lead on RBI base 
hits from Dwight Evans and Marty Barrett. The Mets tied the score in the 
fifth inning on a single from Ray Knight and a run-scoring double play 
by Danny Heep (his last at-bat ever as a Met). An error by Knight led to 
Barrett scoring in the seventh to give Boston a 3–2 lead. In the top of 
the eighth, the Red Sox had Dave Henderson on second with one out. Manager 
John McNamara sent rookie Mike Greenwell to pinch hit for Roger Clemens 
in an effort to match Greenwell, a left-handed batter, against the Mets' 
dominant short-relief man Roger McDowell even as righty slugger Don Baylor 
sat on the bench; Greenwell struck out and the Sox scored no runs that 
inning. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due 
to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute 
this. Clemens said to Bob Costas on an MLB Network program concerning the 
1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting 
to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens "begged out" of the game. 
Bruce Hurst and Calvin Schiraldi, who also appeared on the program, said 
that because McNamara had started warming Schiraldi in the bullpen in the 
previous inning, there would have been no bearing on the decision whatsoever 
as Clemens was not going to come out for the bottom of the inning.[17] 
Whatever the reasoning behind the decision was, McNamara called upon his 
closer Schiraldi in the bottom of the eighth inning for a potential two-inning 
save. Lee Mazzilli, pinch hitting for Jesse Orosco, who recorded the final 
out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. Lenny Dykstra then 
reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. Wally Backman 
followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, 
and Schiraldi intentionally walked Keith Hernandez to load the bases for 
Gary Carter. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at 
the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie 
the game. With Dykstra now on third, Darryl Strawberry stood in with a 
chance to drive in the go-ahead run. Instead, Strawberry flied out to end 
the inning. The Mets made a double switch in the top of the ninth, with 
Mazzilli taking Strawberry's spot in right field while Rick Aguilera came 
in to face Jim Rice, Evans and Rich Gedman. After striking out Rice, Aguilera 
saw shortstop Kevin Elster misplay the ball at shortstop and allow Evans 
to reach base. He escaped trouble when Gedman grounded to Backman, who 
turned a double play with Elster and Hernandez to keep the game tied. Schiraldi 
returned to the mound for the Red Sox trying to keep the score even and 
atone for his blown save. After Knight walked, Mookie Wilson laid down 
a sacrifice bunt that Gedman threw wide of second in an attempt to get 
Knight, putting the winning run in scoring position with nobody out. This 
time, the Mets could not get a run in off Schiraldi as Howard Johnson, 
pinch hitting for Elster, struck out. Mazzilli and Dykstra then flied out 
for the remaining two outs, sending the game into extra innings. In the 
top of the tenth inning, Henderson hit Aguilera's second pitch of the inning 
out of the park for a 4-3 Boston edge. After Spike Owen struck out, McNamara 
sent Schiraldi up to hit for himself. This meant that Schiraldi, who had 
already pitched two innings, would be at least sent out to start his third, 
which was not unusual in that Schiraldi had averaged more than two innings 
pitched over the course of his 51 appearances in 1986.[18] After Schiraldi 
struck out, Aguilera allowed a double to Wade Boggs, who scored when Barrett 
singled him in. With Barrett now on second after the throw to the plate, 
Bill Buckner was hit by a pitch, putting two runners on for the Red Sox's 
star hitter, Jim Rice. Aguilera got Rice to fly out, but Boston now had 
a two-run lead to work with as Schiraldi headed out for the tenth. In addition 
to his decision to leave Schiraldi in the game for what was a risky third 
inning, McNamara sent Buckner back out to play first in the bottom of the 
tenth. Normally, in late game situations, McNamara would pull Buckner from 
games due to the first baseman having chronic ankle injuries and put Dave 
Stapleton in at first for the remainder of the game. Initially, McNamara 
said that he felt that Buckner deserved to be on the field if the Red Sox 
were to hold on and win the game.[19] Stapleton was not happy about remaining 
on the bench and in 1995, he blasted McNamara in a book written about the 
'86 Red Sox. McNamara responded in the same 2011 interview with Costas 
that the real reason why he did not put Stapleton in the game was because 
Stapleton was known by his teammates as "Shaky", in reference to his lack 
of stout defensive play.[17] Schiraldi was to face the Mets' 2-3-4 hitters 
to start the tenth. He retired Backman on a fly to left and Hernandez on 
a fly to center, and the Red Sox were one out away from their first championship 
in sixty-eight years. After his out, Hernandez went into the clubhouse 
and undressed and watched the remainder of the game on a clubhouse TV. 
Because of a mistake by the scoreboard operator, the words "Congratulations 
Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions" briefly flashed on the scoreboard.[20] 
Needing baserunners to stay alive, Carter provided a spark by lining a 
single into left field. Aguilera's spot was up next due to the double switch 
and Mets manager Davey Johnson, running low on players, sent someone into 
the clubhouse to retrieve Kevin Mitchell to pinch hit. Mitchell had gone 
into the clubhouse after Hernandez recorded the second out, allegedly to 
book a flight home for later that night.[17] Despite the rush, the rookie 
utility man came through with a single. Knight was the next batter and, 
after two pitches, he faced a count of no balls and two strikes. The Red 
Sox were one strike away from the championship. But on Schiraldi's third 
pitch, Knight singled, scoring Carter and advancing the speedy Mitchell 
to third. McNamara had seen enough and went to the mound. He took the ball 
from Schiraldi and called on his former closer, Bob Stanley to face Wilson 
with the tying run ninety feet away from scoring. Stanley had already faced 
Wilson three times in the series, retiring him twice. The last time Wilson 
faced him was in Game 4, and he recorded a single. Stanley got Wilson to 
keep missing and fouling off pitches, with the count at 2-2 after seven 
pitches. For a second time, the Red Sox were one strike away from victory. 
But on the eighth pitch, Stanley lost control of a pitch that went inside 
and nearly hit Wilson. Wilson fell over and waved Mitchell in to score 
as Gedman could not field the ball in time, while Knight moved into scoring 
position with what was now the winning run. Interestingly, Stanley appeared 
to have balked by failing to come to a stop in his "set" position after 
starting his motion. Had the apparent balk been called, the result would 
have been virtually the same (with Mitchell scoring and Knight advancing 
to second), but with Wilson still facing a 2-2 count. During Wilson's at-bat, 
Marty Barrett repeatedly yelled at Stanley from second for a throw as Knight 
was far off the bag and could easily have been picked off. Stanley, however, 
could not hear from the crowd noise and was focused on Wilson. On the tenth 
pitch of the at-bat,[21] Stanley induced a ground ball off Wilson's bat. 
Buckner, who was playing on the lip of the infield to protect against a 
hit through the first-second base hole, moved over to the foul line to 
try to field the ball. He did not field it. The ball rolled between his 
legs and into the outfield, enabling Knight to come around third and score 
without a play. The Mets won the game 6-5 and tied the series at three 
games. The win went to Aguilera, with the loss going to Schiraldi as he 
was responsible for Mitchell and Knight on base. Schiraldi was also credited 
with a blown save after giving up the tying runs in the eighth while Stanley 
was also credited with one for not holding the lead in the tenth. Vin Scully's 
call of the play on NBC Television would quickly become an iconic one to 
baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: 
So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie 
Wilson. [A] little roller up along first... behind the bag! It gets through 
Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it! Scully then remained silent 
for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell 
the story. Scully resumed with: If one picture is worth a thousand words, 
you have seen about a million words, but more than that, you have seen 
an absolutely bizarre finish to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets 
are not only alive, they are well, and they will play the Red Sox in Game 7 
tomorrow! In the 2011 ESPN Films documentary Catching Hell, Buckner explained 
how, years after the event, he realized from watching a television replay 
how he had missed the ball. He said, when he played in the field, he liked 
to wear a very loose glove — i.e., one that was floppy. When he moved to 
his left to try to field Wilson's grounder and then stopped, the momentum 
of the leftward-moving loose glove caused the glove to close. The ball 
then went just past the right side of the glove.[22] After the Red Sox 
scored their two runs in the tenth, a vote was taken on who should be considered 
the MVP of the series. The voters decided to name Bruce Hurst, who had 
only allowed two runs in seventeen innings pitched in his two games, the 
MVP if the Red Sox lead was to hold.[23] The award would eventually be 
presented after Game 7 (see below) to Knight. Bobby Richardson, who played 
for the New York Yankees in the 1960 World Series, would remain (and still 
is, as of 2015[update]) the only World Series MVP from a losing team. After 
the top of the tenth, NBC began setting up in the visiting clubhouse for 
what they believed was the inevitable postgame victory celebration. The 
Commissioner's Trophy had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along 
with several bottles of champagne, and Bob Costas was to preside over the 
presentation. However, after Stanley's wild pitch in the bottom of the 
tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the 
Red Sox returned.[17] Because it aired on NBC, this game caused the first 
cancellation of Saturday Night Live, after it went into extra innings; 
that night's episode – filmed starting at 1:30 AM – aired two weeks later, 
with an introduction by Ron Darling, who explained that when they entered 
the locker room, they were informed that they caused the first delay in 
SNL's 11-year history (at the time) to their dismay. In 2011, MLB Network 
ranked this as the third greatest game of the preceding fifty years.[24] 
The seventh and deciding game of the series was scheduled for Sunday night, 
October 26. However, heavy rain caused the postponement of the game one 
night and the game was played on Monday night, October 27. The Mets sent 
Ron Darling, their scheduled starter, out for Game 7 with an extra day 
of rest due to the rainout. Oil Can Boyd, who had struggled in his Game 
3 start earlier in the series, was supposed to take the mound for the Red 
Sox in Game 7. The postponement gave Red Sox manager John McNamara another 
idea, and he decided to start Bruce Hurst, already 2-0 in the series and 
the presumptive series MVP if the Red Sox won, instead of Boyd as the rainout 
enabled him to get a third day of rest and thus be ready to go for the 
decider. Boyd, upset at not being given the ball as he was supposed to, 
went into the clubhouse and decided to drown his sorrows in alcohol. Thus, 
when pitching coach Bill Fischer went to check on him, he found Boyd was 
highly intoxicated and thus in no condition to pitch in relief that night 
if he was needed.[17][25] Boston got to Darling early, recording three 
second inning runs. Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman hit back to back home 
runs to lead the inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave 
Henderson with a single for a 3–0 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch as 
well as he had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning 
with two outs and a runner in scoring position. Sid Fernandez came in and 
after walking Boggs, he was able to retire Marty Barrett on a fly ball 
to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and 
sixth. Still trailing 3–0 and having only one hit to show for their outing 
so far, the New York bats came alive in the bottom of the sixth against 
Hurst. After recording the first out, pinch hitter Lee Mazzilli and Mookie 
Wilson recorded back to back hits and Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the 
bases. Keith Hernandez singled to drive in Mazzilli and Wilson, and Gary 
Carter followed with a liner to right that Evans dove to try to catch but 
could not come up with. Pinch runner Wally Backman, who came in to run 
for Teufel, scored the tying run but Hernandez, who had to wait and see 
if the ball was going to be caught by Evans, got a late jump and was thrown 
out as Evans was able to relay the throw to Spike Owen. Hernandez got into 
an argument with right field umpire Dale Ford, claiming that his delay 
in ruling on Evans' play caused him to wait too long before advancing. 
With two outs, Hurst faced Darryl Strawberry and retired him. Roger McDowell 
came in to replace Fernandez in the seventh. His first batter was Tony 
Armas, who pinch hit for Hurst and thus ended his night. After striking 
him out, McDowell induced Boggs and Barrett to ground out to end the inning. 
The Red Sox now needed to make a pitching change, and with Boyd in no condition 
to pitch the bullpen was short-staffed and McNamara called on Calvin Schiraldi, 
his closer who had lost the previous game after pitching 2.2 innings, to 
face Ray Knight, Kevin Mitchell, and Rafael Santana with the pitcher's 
spot due up fourth. Knight greeted Schiraldi with a solo home run to give 
the Mets their first lead of the game. Lenny Dykstra came in to bat for 
Mitchell and followed with a single and advanced to second on a wild pitch. 
Santana then singled to score Dykstra, and after McDowell bunted Santana 
to second McNamara called on Joe Sambito to face Wilson. After giving Wilson 
a free pass, Sambito then walked Backman to load the bases for Hernandez. 
The Mets' captain hit a fly ball to center field that was deep enough to 
score Santana and advance Wilson to third. Bob Stanley, who allowed the 
game-winning play in Game 6, was then brought in to face Carter and got 
him to ground out, but the Mets were now ahead 6-3. Having only one base 
runner since the third inning, the Red Sox mounted a rally in the top of 
the eighth. Bill Buckner led off with a single. Jim Rice followed with 
one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and 
cut the lead to one. Davey Johnson brought in Jesse Orosco to try and stop 
the rally with the tying run now in scoring position. Orosco retired Gedman 
on a lineout, struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout to pinch hitter 
Don Baylor to strand Evans in scoring position. McNamara brought in Al 
Nipper, who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. Darryl Strawberry 
led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced 
to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to 
get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by singling to center 
to drive in Knight. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit 
him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, 
and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning. With a three run lead, 
Orosco took the hill for the ninth facing the top of the Red Sox order. 
Ed Romero, who replaced Spike Owen at shortstop, was retired on a foul 
pop. Boggs then grounded out to Backman at second, leaving Marty Barrett 
as the last hope for the Red Sox. Orosco worked a 2-2 count before getting 
Barrett to swing and miss to end the game and the series, with the Mets 
taking the deciding game 8-5. The win went to McDowell, with Schiraldi 
taking his second consecutive loss. Orosco recorded his second save. After 
recording the final out, Orosco threw his glove high in the air and immediately 
dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran out to the mound to 
embrace him with the rest of the team following.[26] A famous photo of 
the celebration was taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky.[26] For 
many years, this was the final scene shown during the ending credits of 
the syndicated Major League Baseball news show This Week in Baseball, and 
was replaced in 1992 by the final out of the division-clinching victory 
by the Atlanta Braves in 1991. And then, the song: "Success" by The Weather 
Girls was played. This was the Mets' second championship, and their first 
since 1969. For the city of New York, this was their first World Series 
championship and their first major professional sports championship since 
the Yankees won in 1978. For the New York metropolitan area, this was their 
first major professional sports championship since the New York Islanders 
swept the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals. The NFL's New York Giants would follow 
the Mets' World Series triumph by winning Super Bowl XXI at the conclusion 
of the 1986 NFL season. This was the second time in which the Mets' World 
Series win was in conjunction with a football championship by a New York 
team, as the New York Jets (then a member of the AFL) had defeated the 
Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. The Yankees themselves would not win 
another World Series until 1996 (their 23rd win in 34 appearances), ten 
years after the Mets claimed theirs. Both New York teams played each other 
in the 2000 "Subway Series", with the Yankees winning four games to one. 
The Red Sox were the third professional sports team based in the Greater 
Boston area to compete for a championship in 1986. The NFL's New England 
Patriots lost to the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX and the Boston Celtics 
won the 1986 NBA Finals over the Houston Rockets. This was the last Red 
Sox loss in a World Series game until Game 2 of the 2013 World Series, 
when the Red Sox lost 4-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals after 9 consecutive 
wins in World Series play. Their intervening World Series appearances included 
their 2004 sweep against the St. Louis Cardinals, ending the Curse of the 
Bambino, their 2007 sweep against the Colorado Rockies, and their 2013 
victory over the Cardinals in six games. The 2013 series marked the first 
time that the Red Sox won the clinching game at Fenway Park since 1918. 
As of 2015[update], 1986 marks the most recent time the Red Sox have lost 
a World Series. 1986 World Series (4–3): New York Mets (N.L.) beat Boston 
Red Sox (A.L.) NBC's broadcast of Game 7 (which went up against a Monday 
Night Football game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants 
on ABC) garnered a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and a 55 share, making it the 
highest-rated single World Series game to date. Vin Scully on NBC Television 
Game 6: Scully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting 
the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with: Bob 
Murphy on WHN exactly the same moment as Scully's call: Jack Buck on CBS 
Radio exactly the same moment as Scully's call: Ken Coleman on WRKO exactly 
the same moment as Scully's call: In the 1998 film Rounders, Matt Damon's 
Character (Mike McDermott) references Game 6 while returning into Teddy 
KGB's place in the final scene. "I feel like Buckner walking back into 
Shea." In the 2005 film Fever Pitch the main character played by Jimmy 
Fallon, a die hard Red Sox fan, watches a tape of Game 6 to get over what 
looks to be his break up with his girlfriend. The collapse of the Boston 
Red Sox in Game 6 and Game 7 prompted a series of articles by George Vecsey 
of the New York Times, in which he mentions a "Babe Ruth Curse."[28][29] 
Although it had long been noted that the selling of Babe Ruth to the New 
York Yankees had marked the beginning of a down period in the Red Sox's 
fortunes, this was one of the first instances, if not the first, in which 
mention of a "curse" was made.[30][31] The term "Curse of the Bambino" 
was not in common use by the press during the 1920s, nor can it be found 
through the 1970s, as a search of historical newspapers will illustrate.[32] 
In fact, even though Vecsey's articles mention a "Babe Ruth Curse", the 
New York Times did not use the phrase "Curse of the Bambino" until 1990,[33] 
the year that Dan Shaughnessy's book of the same name and a Boston Globe 
article about it were published.[34] Shaughnessy's book The Curse of the 
Bambino helped that phrase become a key part of the Red Sox lore in the 
media thereafter.[32][35] The dramatic sixth game was the subject of Game 
6, a 2005 independent film starring Michael Keaton, based on a 1991 screenplay 
by novelist Don DeLillo. Village Voice film critic J. Hoberman included 
Game 6 in his list of the top ten films of 1986.[36] In his song "Faith 
and Fear in Flushing Meadows", twee/folk artist Harry Breitner makes mention 
of Ray Knight and Mookie Wilson. NBC's telecast of the Series ended with 
the song "Limelight" from Stereotomy, penultimate album of The Alan Parsons 
Project. The Series, and especially Game 6, were referenced in the Seinfeld 
episode "The Boyfriend", which also guest starred former Mets player Keith 
Hernandez. In the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode "Mister Softee", Bill Buckner 
appears as a guest star, and mocks his famous 1986 mishap by missing a 
crucial catch of a Mookie Wilson-signed baseball. As the episode concludes,
