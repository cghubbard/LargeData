The 1986 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 105th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and its 95th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 79-82 during the season and finished 3rd in the National League East 
division. Pitcher Todd Worrell won the Rookie of the Year Award this year, 
with a 2.08 ERA and 36 saves. This was the second consecutive year a Cardinal 
won the Rookie of the Year Award, with Vince Coleman winning the previous 
season, and the second time in team history that the Cardinals had two 
consecutive NL Rookie of the Year winners (Wally Moon in 1954 and Bill 
Virdon in 1955). Shortstop Ozzie Smith and outfielder Willie McGee won 
Gold Gloves this year. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
