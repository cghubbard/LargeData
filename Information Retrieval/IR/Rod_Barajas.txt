Rodrigo "Rod" Richard Barajas (born September 5, 1975) is a Mexican American 
former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball 
for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Texas Rangers, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto 
Blue Jays, New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates. Barajas 
has also played with the Mexico national baseball team. Barajas was originally 
signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks as an amateur free agent on December 
23, 1996. He was immediately sent to the minor leagues. He played for the 
Lethbridge Black Diamonds of the Pioneer League (Rk), the lowest level 
of the minors as a rookie, but excelled, hitting .337 in 51 games. He played 
his way to the top of the minor leagues in the Diamondbacks' system. Barajas 
made his Major League debut for the Diamondbacks on September 25, 1999, 
against the San Francisco Giants. He was hitless in three at-bats in that 
game. He hit his first career home run in the last game of the season on 
October 3, 1999, against the San Diego Padres, a line-drive to left-center 
field off of Heath Murray. He played in a total of 10 games with the Diamondbacks 
in 1999 and 2000. He homered twice and did not commit a single error while 
playing catcher. Barajas struggled at the plate in 2001, hitting just .160 
in 51 games, though he only committed one error while serving as a backup 
for Damian Miller. He was on the Diamondbacks' World Series roster. In 
Game 5 of the World Series, he homered off Mike Mussina of the New York 
Yankees. Barajas continued to serve as a backup for Miller in 2002. In 
70 games, he hit .234 with 3 home runs and 23 RBI. Despite the poor offensive 
numbers in 2002, Barajas did not commit a single error behind the plate. 
In 2003, he pulled off similar numbers in 80 games, batting just .218 with 
3 home runs and 28 RBI. He became a free agent after the season. Before 
2004, Barajas had never played more than 80 games, hit more than three 
home runs, or batted higher than .234 in a full season. In 2004, the Texas 
Rangers invited him to spring training and he won the backup catcher's 
job. After starting catcher Gerald Laird was sidelined with a sprained 
thumb, Barajas took over the starting job with Laird and Danny Ardoin serving 
as his backups. At the end of the season, he established career highs in 
games played (108), home runs (15), RBIs (58), and batting average (.249). 
Barajas also played some first base when needed, compiling ten career games 
there as a defensive replacement, through the 2007 season. In 2005, he 
hit a career-high 21 Home Runs, serving as the starter once again. In 2006, 
his numbers dropped significantly and he split time with Laird. In November 
2006, Barajas was originally going to sign a deal with the Toronto Blue 
Jays, but he backed out of the deal at the last minute, after switching 
agents. On December 18, 2006, it was announced that he had reached an agreement 
with the Philadelphia Phillies for a one-year deal worth less than half 
of the Blue Jays' offer a month earlier. Barajas claimed he was happy with 
the new deal and had no regrets. He shared time behind the plate with Carlos 
Ruiz. On October 11, 2007, the Phillies declined his option making him 
a free agent, and on January 24, 2008, Barajas signed a deal with the Toronto 
Blue Jays, the team he backed out of a contract with the previous off-season, 
this time as the backup to incumbent catcher Gregg Zaun. Zaun had signed 
a two-year deal with the team only after negotiations with Barajas fell 
apart.[1] Blue Jays general manager J.P. Ricciardi said he had no hard 
feelings towards Barajas. Zaun was supposed to be the starting catcher, 
but due to his poor offensive numbers and overall difficulties, manager 
Cito Gaston made Barajas the starter after he took over for John Gibbons. 
He took over the starting catching job from Gregg Zaun, and continued in 
that role in 2009. He finished the 2008 season batting .249 with 11 home 
runs, 49 RBIs, a .294 on-base percentage, and a .410 slugging percentage 
over 104 games. Barajas finished the 2009 season batting .226 in 125 games 
with 19 home runs and a career high 71 RBI. On February 24, 2010, Barajas 
signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the New York Mets and was named 
the opening day catcher. On May 7, 2010, he hit the first walk-off home 
run in the history of Citi Field, giving him three multi home run games 
in his first five weeks as a Met. Barajas became the first Met catcher 
to hit 12 or more home runs since Mike Piazza's last year with the Mets 
in 2005. On August 22, 2010, Barajas was claimed off waivers by the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and acquired for cash considerations.[2] In his first game 
with Los Angeles against the Milwaukee Brewers, Barajas hit two doubles 
and a three-run home run. Barajas became the first Dodger to hit three 
extra-base hits in his first game with the club. In his first home game 
in Dodger Stadium, Barajas hit a home run in the fifth inning.[3] Barajas 
appeared in 25 games with the Dodgers in 2010, hitting .297 with 5 home 
runs and 13 RBI. On December 3, 2010, he re-signed with the Dodgers on 
a one-year deal for 2011. In 2011, he played in 98 games with the Dodgers, 
hitting .230 with 16 home runs and 47 RBI. He became a free agent after 
the season. On November 10, 2011, Barajas signed a one-year contract with 
a club option for 2013 with the Pittsburgh Pirates.[4] The Pirates declined 
his 2013 option on October 31, 2012.[5] On February 8, 2013, Barajas signed 
a minor-league deal with the Diamondbacks.,[6] but the Diamondbacks released 
him on March 25.[7] Before the 2014 season, Barajas was named Manager of 
the Arizona League Padres.[8][9] Barajas replaced Jamie Quirk as the manager 
of the San Antonio Missions on 17 June 15 after Quirk was promoted to coach 
Triple-A El Paso. Due to the game being postponed to rain, his debut occurred 
with a double-header on 18 June 15 against the Midland RockHounds. [10] 
He is now the acting manager for the El Paso Chihuhuas AAA baseball team. 
Barajas is of Mexican descent. His mother and father are from Michoac√°n 
and Baja California, respectively.[11] He and his wife Stacie have four 
sons, Andrew, Bryce, Rod Jr. and Jace, and three daughters, Aunalilia, 
Aubrielle, and Starlette.[12] Rod attended Santa Fe High School, Santa
