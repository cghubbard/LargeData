Heinz Field is a stadium located in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, United States. It primarily serves as the home to the Pittsburgh 
Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) and the Pittsburgh Panthers 
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The stadium opened 
in 2001, after the controlled implosion of the teams' previous stadium, 
Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium is named for the locally based H. J. 
Heinz Company, which purchased the naming rights in 2001. It hosted the 
2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington 
Capitals on January 1, 2011. On September 10, 2016 it hosted the Keystone 
Classic, which featured a renewal of the Penn State-Pitt football rivalry, 
setting a new attendance record at 69,983 people. Funded in conjunction 
with PNC Park and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the $281 million 
($376.2 million today) stadium stands along the Ohio River, on the Northside 
of Pittsburgh in the North Shore neighborhood. The stadium was designed 
with the city of Pittsburgh's history of steel production in mind, which 
led to the inclusion of 12,000 tons of steel into the design.[7] Ground 
for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was 
hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural grass surface has been 
criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the 
grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 68,400 seat 
stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates 
back to 1972 (a year before local telecasts of home games were permitted 
in the NFL)[citation needed]. A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers 
and Panthers of the past can be found in the Great Hall. The Pittsburgh 
Steelers and the Pittsburgh Pirates shared Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 
to 2000. After discussions over the Pittsburgh Pirates building a full-time 
baseball park, a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into 
a full-time football facility.[8] Though met with negative reaction from 
Steelers ownership, the proposal was used as a "fallback position" that 
would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed.[9] Steelers ownership 
stated that failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances 
of signing players who might opt to sign with other teams, such as the 
other three teams in the Steelers division who had all recently built new 
football-only stadiums.[10] In June 2001, the H. J. Heinz Company purchased 
the naming rights to the stadium.[11] As per the deal, Heinz will pay the 
Steelers a total of $57 million through 2021; the "57" being an intentional 
reference to Heinz 57.[12] Despite Heinz later announcing its acquisition 
of Kraft Foods Group to form Kraft Heinz Company in 2015, the stadium's 
name will remain known as Heinz Field.[13] Originally, a sales tax increase 
was proposed to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and an expansion 
of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. After the rejection of this 
proposal in a referendum, the city developed Plan B.[14] Similarly controversial, 
the alternative proposal was labeled Scam B by opponents.[15] The Steelers' 
pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even 
after it was raised from $50 million to $76.5 million.[8][16] Other local 
government members criticized the $281 million of public money allocated 
for Plan B.[8][17] One member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District 
board called the use of tax dollars "corporate welfare".[18] The plan, 
totaling $809 million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District 
board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field.[18][19] 
Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers made a deal with Pittsburgh 
city officials to stay in the city until at least 2031.[15] The total cost 
of Heinz Field was $281 million.[20] HOK Sport designed the stadium.[21] 
HOK Sport's project manager for the project, Melinda Lehman, said that 
the Rooney family asked for the stadium's design to "acknowledge the history 
of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is 
where Pittsburgh is going."[22] In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport 
used steel structurally and externally.[22] The stone used in Heinz Field's 
design is artificial, in order to decrease cost.[22] Of the glass used 
in the stadium's design, Lehman said, "The glass is a more modern building 
element, which ties into a lot of the buildings in [Downtown] Pittsburgh 
and gives great views of the surrounding areas."[22] The Steelers and Panthers 
have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the amount of 
players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities 
are modeled after the home locker rooms' design.[23] As with its predecessor, 
Heinz Field's culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400 eateries are 
located throughout the stadium.[24] A bronze statue of Steelers founder 
Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved 100 feet 
(30 m) from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium.[25] In 
addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt's Cathedral 
of Learning was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 
27 by 96 foot Sony JumboTron was the largest scoreboard in the NFL.[26] 
In 2007, ESPN named the "tipping" of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles 
atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.[27] 
Ground was broken for Heinz Field on June 18, 1999, at a ceremony co-hosted 
by the Steelers and the University of Pittsburgh.[28] The stadium was constructed 
by Hunt Construction Group and Mascaro Corporation.[29] The two companies 
directed 1,400 workers over two years, in which there were no construction 
accidents or lawsuits.[25] The stadium is inspected yearly, along with 
PNC Park, by Chronicle Consulting, LLC, for structural defects and maintenance.[30] 
The first event held at Heinz Field was a concert hosted by the band 'N 
Sync, on August 18, 2001. Coincidentally, they were also the last band 
to perform at the Steelers' previous home, Three Rivers Stadium.[31][32] 
Prior to the Steelers regular season schedule, the team played a pre-season 
game against the Detroit Lions on August 25, 2001.[33] Pittsburgh won the 
stadium's unofficial opening game 20–7, with 57,829 spectators in attendance.[34] 
The first official football game played in the stadium was between the 
Pittsburgh Panthers and East Tennessee State, on September 1. The Panthers 
won the game 31–0, with quarterback David Priestley scoring the first touchdown 
on an 85-yard run.[35] The Steelers were scheduled to open the regular 
season play at Heinz Field on September 16 against the Cleveland Browns; 
however, due to the September 11 attacks, all NFL games of the week were 
postponed,[34][36] thus moving the stadium's premiere to October 7, against 
the Cincinnati Bengals.[36] Prior to the game, a speech from US President 
George W. Bush, ordering attacks on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, was 
shown live on the stadium's JumboTron.[37] The speech was met with much 
applause and support from the spectators in attendance.[36] Pittsburgh 
defeated the Bengals, 16–7. Steelers kicker Kris Brown scored the first 
NFL points in the stadium on a 26-yard field goal, and quarterback Kordell 
Stewart scored the first touchdown on an eight-yard run.[38] On September 
10, 2016, college football game between Pitt and the Penn State Nittany 
Lions football team drew 69,983 spectators, the largest single-game attendance 
in Heinz Field history. Pitt won the game 42-39 In addition to football 
games, Heinz Field has hosted other various activities. Since its opening 
in 2001, bands and artists including 'N Sync, Taylor Swift, Kenny Chesney, 
and LeAnn Rimes have performed at the stadium.[39][40] In addition, hometown 
bands The Clarks and the Povertyneck Hillbillies have played multiple shows 
at the stadium.[41] In 2002, the Pittsburgh Marathon concluded at Heinz 
Field, the course was altered from past years to allow competitors to cross 
the finish line on the field.[42] In 2005, the Pittsburgh Wine Festival 
was held at Heinz Field, over 2,000 people attended.[43] The 2011 American 
Idol Auditions chose Pittsburgh of one of six cities and scheduled signups 
at Heinz Field on July 12–13 and auditions on July 15, 2011. In 2007, writer 
Bill Evans named Heinz Field the second best stadium in the NFL, behind 
Lambeau Field, in an article for ESPN.com.[44] Although both stadiums received 
a score of 54 out of 70, Sports Illustrated named Heinz Field the second 
best stadium in the NFL, also behind Lambeau Field.[45] That same year, 
two light-emitting diode (LED) video displays from Daktronics were installed 
at the field. The larger, high definition video display measures approximately 
28 feet (8.5 m) high by nearly 96 feet (29 m) wide.[46] Heinz Field served 
as the home field of the Gotham Rogues in the 2012 film The Dark Knight 
Rises.[47] An estimated 15,000 unpaid extras filled the stadium during 
shooting on August 6, 2011.[48] On August 4, 2012, Heinz Field will host 
the Women's Football Alliance's National Championship Game, becoming the 
first NFL stadium to host a title game for any women's football league.[49] 
The quickest score in NFL history occurred on September 8, 2013 in the 
Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers 
scored a safety on the opening kickoff three seconds into the game. Darius 
Reynaud of the Titans fielded the kickoff and took a short step backwards 
(into the south end zone) for what was ruled to be a safety, not a touchback, 
because the ball was not in the end zone when it was fielded. The Steelers, 
however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss 
since Heinz Field opened.[50] On July 27, 2014, Heinz Field hosted a soccer 
match between A.C. Milan and Manchester City which was part of the 2014 
International Champions Cup and Manchester City won the match 5-1.[51] 
On May 28, 2010, National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman announced 
that Heinz Field would be the host of the 2011 NHL Winter Classic.[52] 
The game was played January 1, 2011 between the Pittsburgh Penguins and 
Washington Capitals. Pittsburgh native Jackie Evancho sang the Star Spangled 
Banner before local sports legends Franco Harris, Jerome Bettis and Mario 
Lemieux dropped the ceremonial puck. The Capitals won, 3–1.[53] The game 
was the highest rated NHL contest since 1996 and the highest rated regular 
season game since 1975.[54] It was also the first night Classic and the 
first to use "CableCam" technology. In June 2001, Kentucky Bluegrass was 
laid on the field,[7] at half the height of most NFL field's 2-inch (51 mm) 
grass. The field is heated from below, using a mixture of antifreeze and 
hot water, to keep the field at around 62 °F (17 °C) in order to keep the 
grass growing year-round.[32] The field was re-surfaced multiple times, 
until the synthetic-enhanced Desso GrassMaster was installed in 2003.[55] 
Debate continued over the surface after players began slipping during game 
play. Despite this players and coaches of Pitt, the Steelers, and their 
opponents supported keeping the current turf.[56] "I need the grass. I 
like the mud. I like the sloppiness, I'm used to it. Mr. Rooney, can we 
please keep the grass? I don't want no FieldTurf. It's bad on your knees." 
On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL championship 
football games which were followed the day after with a game between Pitt 
and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL,[58] Steelers ownership 
made the decision to re-surface the field for their nationally televised 
game against the Miami Dolphins. A layer of sod was laid overtop the 2.5-acre 
(1.0 ha) Desso GrassMaster surface.[59] The field's condition was exacerbated 
by 1½ inches of rain after the new sod had been laid,[60] which did not 
allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the 
game began.[61] The field conditions during the game ended up being so 
bad that at one point during the game, a punt by Dolphins punter Brandon 
Fields ended up sticking into the turf without bouncing.[62] The Steelers 
won the game 3–0, with a field goal by Jeff Reed with 17 seconds remaining 
in regulation;[63] it was the NFL's first 3-0 game since 1993 and the longest 
two teams went without scoring since the New York Giants and Detroit Lions 
played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943.[63] Scott Brown, of the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called the field a "veritable mud pit".[64] 
While Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players' Association, 
also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked 
Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league.[64] Steelers receiver 
Hines Ward called the playing conditions "horrendous" after the game.[65] 
However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to 
keep the natural surface stating, "I think everybody wants to keep the 
grass."[57] Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the 
weekend following Thanksgiving on the road at the team's request. Debate 
continued over the field later in the season when Jacksonville running back 
Fred Taylor called the field "a lawsuit pending".[66] Pittsburgh's ownership 
stated that the decision was up to the players, who once again defended 
the natural surface.[67] In February 2008, the Steelers announced that 
they would keep the Desso GrassMaster surface.[60] During the 2008 season 
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was given a concussion after being hit at 
Heinz Field. He later stated, "I'm glad we weren't on FieldTurf. That grass—you 
know, the soft Heinz Field—might've helped a little bit."[68] After the 
2008 season, a poll of 1,565 NFL players rated the surface at Heinz Field 
as the worst of the 18 natural surfaces in the League.[69] The DDGrassmaster 
surface was removed in January 2009 and replaced with the old sod placed 
on top of the DDGrassmaster surface for the AFC Championship also in January 
2009.[3] Unique about the field is the design itself. Initially, the south 
end zone had either "Steelers" or "Panthers" painted in the end zone, depending 
on the game itself. The north end zone has always read "Pittsburgh", which 
is painted in gold lettering and trimmed in either black for the Steelers 
or dark blue for Pitt. Although there is typically no midfield logo when 
both Pitt and the Steelers are in season, both teams have applied their 
logo if the field's schedule allows for a sufficient break to remove or 
apply the other team's logo for that team's next upcoming game. The Steelers 
have typically added their logo to midfield after Pitt's football season 
has ended. In 2003, the Steelers played the Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason 
game to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Steagles team, when the 
two merged as a result of player shortages caused by World War II. Steelers 
president Dan Rooney had initially considered wearing a throwback uniform 
for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles 
uniforms, and the Steelers didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors. Instead, 
the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, 
which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s. Although the Steelers 
lost the game 21–16, Rooney liked the look of the south end zone being 
"plain", and decided to keep it permanently. As with the team's logo at 
midfield, the Steelers paint "Steelers" in the south end zone once the 
college football season ends. The Green Bay Packers also adopted the plain 
diagonal white lines in the end zones at Lambeau Field for 2007 due to 
an Anniversary logo being painted on each end, before switching back to 
wordmark endzones in 2008 which have remained since. As of 2008, the Pittsburgh 
Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.[70] Entering 
the 2008 season, the Steelers average ticket price of $69.47 was the 15th 
highest out of the NFL's 32 teams.[71] The majority of the 65,050 seats 
are colored "Steeler gold", though club seats are dark gray.[7][22] Heinz 
Field features 1,500 seats in 129 luxury boxes, with prices ranging from 
$64,000 to $135,000 depending on location and size. These boxes were predicted 
to increase the Steelers' profits from $10 to $11 million per season over 
those at Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium also features 6,600 club seats 
that include a restaurant and an indoor bar, at prices up to $2,000 per 
person.[20] For the 2010 season, season ticket prices for Panthers games 
range from a maximum of $295 per club seat with required donations per 
seat between $250 and $500 depending on location, to as low as $87 per 
seat with no required donation for upper end zone sections. Individual 
game ticket prices ranged from $30 to $65 depending on the seat location 
and the opponent.[72] Attendance for Panthers games has varied from an 
average high of 59,197 people per game throughout the 2003 season to a 
low of 43,680 in 2007.[73] Most recently, Pitt averaged 48,150 in home 
attendance during the 2015 season.[74] The Great Hall spans approximately 
40,000 square feet (3,700 m2) on the east side of the stadium and houses 
a collection of Steelers and Pittsburgh Panthers memorabilia. The Hall 
includes a timeline of the Steelers franchise's major events, an oversized 
Steelers helmet hangs from the ceiling beside a video screen that shows 
entertainment for fans throughout game days.[75] The Great Hall also features 
the actual lockers of several former Steelers, including Hall of Fame members 
Franco Harris, Joe Greene, and Bill Dudley.[75] Six large Super Bowl trophies-shaped 
display columns were erected and contain artifacts from each championship 
the Steelers have won including replica trophies.[76] Two display columns 
are dedicated to the University of Pittsburgh and contain memorabilia from 
the Panthers' teams. The floor is painted to resemble the field at Three 
Rivers Stadium, with the word "Steelers" painted in black over a gold background.[75] 
University of Pittsburgh players are featured on two large murals within 
the Hall. Eight additional tile murals created by local high schools represent 
western Pennsylvania football history.[76] In 2007, the Great Hall was 
named the best concourse at an NFL stadium by writer Bill Evans, in an 
article for ESPN.com.[44] The Steelers notified the Pittsburgh Stadium 
Authority in December 2010 of their intention to add up to 4,000 seats 
to the lower southern end of the stadium. The plan would increase seating 
up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season.[77] Seating was added in that 
section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic which had an attendance of 68,111. 
The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with 
the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.[78] 
On April 12, 2012, the Steelers confirmed they would seek approval from 
the NFL to expand seating by 3,000.[79] On May 19, 2014, after more than 
two years, the Steelers and the SEA came to an agreement to add about 3,000 
seats to the venue.[80] After contractors surveyed the complex the final 
number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more 
parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 to increase 
capacity to a total of 67,890. The seating was put in place by the summer 
of 2015.[81] Heinz Field is located at Exit 1B of Interstate 279 within 
a mile of direct access to both Interstate 376 and Interstate 579. The 
stadium also has dedicated elevated walkway access to the Allegheny Station 
of the Light Rail/Subway system. On Steelers and Pitt Panthers game days, 
access is also provided from Station Square parking facilities via the
