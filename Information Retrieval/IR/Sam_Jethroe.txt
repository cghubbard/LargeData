Samuel Jethroe, nicknamed "The Jet"(January 20, 1918 – June 18, 2001), 
was an American center fielder in Negro league and Major League Baseball. 
With the Cincinnati & Cleveland Buckeyes he won a pair of batting titles, 
hit .340 over seven seasons from 1942 to 1948, and helped the team to two 
pennants and the 1945 Negro World Series title. He was named the National 
League's Rookie of the Year in 1950 with the Boston Braves, and led the 
NL in stolen bases in his first two seasons. Nicknamed "The Jet" for his 
stunning speed, Jethroe was born in Columbus, Mississippi. Until late in 
his life he was believed to have born in 1922, but more recent sources 
have given the year as 1917 or 1918. A switch-hitter who threw right-handed, 
he played semipro ball in the St. Louis area after high school, and briefly 
appeared as a catcher for the Indianapolis ABCs in 1938. From 1942 to 1948 
he played for the Buckeyes of the Negro American League, leading the league 
in stolen bases three times. He batted .487 in 39 at bats in his first 
season in 1942, a year in which a car hit several Buckeyes players on September 
7 while they were standing next to their disabled bus at a roadside outside 
Geneva, Ohio; catcher Buster Brown and pitcher Smoky Owens were killed. 
Jethroe received a physical deferment from military service in World War 
II. In 1943, he batted .291 while leading the league in both doubles (8) 
and triples (4). In 1944, he won his first batting title with a .353 average, 
and led the league with 14 doubles and 18 steals. On April 16, 1945, following 
pressure from a Boston city councilman, Jethroe was one of three black 
players to try out for the Boston Red Sox on the recommendation of black 
sportswriter Wendell Smith. After the tryout was observed by coaches Hugh 
Duffy and Larry Woodall, he was turned away along with Marvin Williams 
and Jackie Robinson, as the Red Sox had no plans to integrate their roster.[1] 
Jethroe returned to the Buckeyes and won his second consecutive batting 
title with a .393 average, again leading the league with 10 triples and 
21 stolen bases.[1] The Buckeyes won the pennant under player-manager Quincy 
Trouppe with a 53–16 record, and swept the Homestead Grays – loaded with 
aging stars such as Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard and Jud Wilson – in the 
Negro World Series. Jethroe hit .333, and Cleveland's pitching dominated 
the Series as the Buckeyes outscored the Grays 15-3. In 1946 Jethroe batted 
.310 and led the league in steals for the third straight year with 20. 
He batted .340 in 1947 as the Buckeyes took another pennant but lost the 
Negro World Series to the New York Cubans four games to one, although Jethroe 
hit .316. He was named to the East-West All-Star team five times (1942, 
1944–47), and ended his Cleveland career with a .296 average in 1948. Robinson 
broke baseball's color line with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Seeing Robinson's 
success, Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey acquired Jethroe's services 
from Cleveland for a reported $5,000.[1] From 1948-49 he played for the 
Dodgers' Montreal Royals minor league team in the International League, 
batting .322 after joining the team late in 1948, and leading the league 
with 89 stolen bases in 1949 while scoring 154 runs. In October 1949, he 
was sold to the Braves for $150,000.[1] On April 18, 1950, Jethroe became 
the first black player on the Boston Braves roster, and collected two hits 
including a home run. He was named Rookie of the Year that season at age 
32 (although he was then believed to be 28) after hitting .273 with 100 
runs, 18 home runs and 58 runs batted in; his 35 stolen bases topped the 
National League, and were the most by a Brave since Hap Myers stole 57 
in 1913. He remains the oldest player to have won Rookie of the Year honors.[1] 
Jethroe enjoyed an almost identical but perhaps slightly improved season 
in 1951 when he posted better figures in batting (.280), runs (101), RBI 
(65), hits (160), doubles (29) and triples (10), and again hit 18 homers. 
He also repeated his 35 steals, once again to lead the league.[1] In 1952 
he slumped badly, hitting .232, and reportedly had vision trouble; rumors 
were also circulating that he was older than his listed age. His career 
was also marked by difficulty in the outfield, as he led the NL in errors 
in each of his three full seasons, though he also led the league with 6 
double plays as a rookie; his arm was not as accurate as those of most 
major league center fielders, and it was believed that he was playing too 
deep. In addition, he was among the NL's top four batters in strikeouts 
each year. On June 7 of his last year with the team, he hit the final grand 
slam in Boston Braves history before the club moved to Milwaukee. Jethroe 
spent 1953 with Triple-A Toledo, hitting .307. Before the 1954 season he 
was one of six players acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for 
infielder Danny O'Connell, but Jethroe played only two games for the team, 
the last on April 15. After that, he spent the next five seasons at Toronto 
in the International League. Despite being among the league leaders in 
hits, runs and stolen bases during that period, his batting averages generally 
declined, and he never got another chance in the majors. In a four-season 
major league career, he was a .261 hitter with 460 hits, 49 home runs, 
280 runs, 181 RBI and 98 stolen bases in 442 games. He was called "the 
quickest human being I've ever seen" by former minor league teammate Don 
Newcombe.[1] After his baseball career ended, Jethroe settled in Erie, 
Pennsylvania, where he worked in a local factory for several years, played 
in the city's semi-pro Glenwood League, then opened a bar. In 1994, Jethroe 
sued Major League Baseball in order to collect pension payments, as he 
was one of a host of other former Negro leaguers who couldn't qualify because 
of the racial discrimination of the 1940s and 1950s which delayed their 
professional careers.[1] While the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge, 
in 1997 Major League Baseball decided to give a yearly payment plan to 
Negro league veterans, including Jethroe.[1] He died of a heart attack
