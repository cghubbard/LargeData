On December 4, 1990, the Padres traded second baseman Roberto Alomar and 
outfielder Joe Carter to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for first baseman 
Fred McGriff and shortstop Tony Fernández. Blue Jays GM Pat Gillick and 
Padres GM Joe McIlvaine originally talked about just trading Joe Carter 
for Fred McGriff.[4] The Padres were losing Jack Clark and needed a new 
first baseman. The Blue Jays had John Olerud ready to take over at first 
base but were losing outfielder George Bell. Gillick decided to up the 
ante by trying to get Roberto Alomar. Gillick figured that with Garry Templeton 
in the twilight of his career, Fernández would be an adequate replacement.[4] 
Alomar feuded with Padres manager Greg Riddoch and the thinking was that 
Bip Roberts and Joey Cora could platoon at second base.[4] Alomar and Carter 
would go on to help the Toronto Blue Jays win the 1992 World Series and 
1993 World Series. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
