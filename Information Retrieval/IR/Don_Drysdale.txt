Donald Scott "Don" Drysdale (July 23, 1936 – July 3, 1993) was an American 
professional baseball player and television sports commentator. He played 
as a right-handed pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers for his entire career 
in Major League Baseball. Inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1984, Drysdale 
was one of the most dominant pitchers of the late 1950s and early to mid 
1960s.[1] Standing 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m) tall, he was an intimidating presence 
on the pitcher's mound and, was not afraid to throw pitches close to batters 
in order to keep them off balance.[1] Drysdale won the 1962 Cy Young Award 
and is known for setting a Major League Baseball record by pitching 58 2⁄3 
consecutive scoreless innings in 1968.[1][2] After his playing career, 
he became a radio and television broadcaster.[3] Drysdale was born in Van 
Nuys, Los Angeles and attended Van Nuys High School, where one of his classmates 
was actor Robert Redford.[4] Pitching for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles 
Dodgers, he teamed with Sandy Koufax during the late 1950s and early and 
middle 1960s to form one of the most dominating pitching duos in history. 
Nicknamed "Big D" by fans, Drysdale used brushback pitches and a sidearm 
fastball to intimidate batters,[3] similar to his fierce fellow Hall of 
Famer Bob Gibson. His 154 hit batsmen remains a modern National League 
record. Drysdale was also a good hitter for a pitcher. In 14 seasons, he 
had 218 hits, including 29 home runs, and was occasionally used as a pinch-hitter, 
once even during the World Series.[5] In 1962, Drysdale won 25 games and 
the Cy Young Award. In 1963, he struck out 251 batters and won Game 3 of 
the World Series at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium over the Yankees, 1–0. 
In 1965, he was the Dodgers' only .300 hitter and tied his own National 
League record for pitchers with seven home runs. That year, he also won 
23 games and helped the Dodgers to their third World Championship in Los 
Angeles. In 1968, he set Major League records with six consecutive shutouts 
and 58 2⁄3 consecutive scoreless innings; the latter record was broken 
by fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser 20 years later. He ended his career with 
209 wins, 2,486 strikeouts, 167 complete games and 49 shutouts. He was 
inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, and had his number 53 
retired at Dodger Stadium on July 1, 1984. He was also the last player 
on the Dodgers who had played for Brooklyn. He won three NL Player of the 
Month awards: June 1959 (6-0 record, 1.71 earned run average, 51 strikeouts), 
July 1960 (6-0 record, 2.00 earned run average, 48 strikeouts), and May 
1968 (5-1 record, 0.53 earned run average, 45 strikeouts, with 5 consecutive 
shutouts to begin his scoreless inning streak, which was carried into June). 
In 1965, Sandy Koufax declined to pitch the first game of the World Series 
because it was on Yom Kippur, a Jewish holy day. Drysdale pitched for the 
Dodgers instead of Koufax, and gave up seven runs in 2 2/3 innings. When 
Walter Alston, the manager, came to the mound to remove him from the game, 
Drysdale said, "I bet right now you wish I was Jewish, too." The Dodgers 
lost to the Minnesota Twins, 8-2. Drysdale and Koufax took part in a famous 
salary holdout together in the spring of 1966, with both finally signing 
contracts just before the season opened. Those contracts made them the 
first pitchers to earn more than $100,000 a year.[3] This holdout was the 
beginning of collective bargaining in baseball. A chronically sore shoulder 
forced Drysdale to retire during the 1969 season. The next year he started 
a broadcasting career that continued for the rest of his life: first for 
the Montreal Expos (1970–1971), then the Texas Rangers (1972), California 
Angels (1973–1979, 1981), Chicago White Sox (1982–1987), NBC (1977), ABC 
(1978[6]–1986), and finally back in Los Angeles with the Dodgers (from 
1988 until his death in 1993). He also worked with his Angels' partner 
Dick Enberg on Los Angeles Rams football broadcasts from 1973–1976. While 
at ABC Sports, Drysdale not only did baseball telecasts, but also regional 
college football games as well as Superstars and Wide World of Sports. 
In 1979, Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation ceremonies 
for ABC. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma–Texas college 
football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 
4 of the NLCS between the Houston Astros and Philadelphia Phillies. In 
the meantime, Drysdale filled in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early 
innings. In 1984, Drysdale called play-by-play (alongside Reggie Jackson 
and Earl Weaver) for the National League Championship Series between the 
San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs. On October 6, 1984 at San Diego's Jack 
Murphy Stadium, Game 4 of the NLCS ended when Padres first baseman Steve 
Garvey hit a two run home run off Lee Smith. Drysdale on the call: The 
Padres, who rallied from a 2–0 deficit in the best-of-five series against 
the Cubs won the decisive Game 5 the next day (thus, winning their first 
ever National League pennant). In his last ABC assignment, Drysdale interviewed 
the winners in the Boston Red Sox's clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 
American League Championship Series against the California Angels. While 
broadcasting for the White Sox, Drysdale generated some controversy while 
covering a heated argument between an umpire and Sox manager Tony La Russa. 
LaRussa pulled up the third base bag and hurled it into the outfield, to 
the approval of the Comiskey Park crowd, and ensuring his ejection. Drysdale 
remarked, "Go get 'em, Dago!" For the Sox, Drysdale broadcast Tom Seaver's 
300th victory, against the host New York Yankees in 1985. His post-game 
interview with Seaver was carried live by both the Sox' network and the 
Yankees' longtime flagship television station WPIX. Drysdale hosted a nationally 
syndicated radio show called Radio Baseball Cards. 162 episodes were produced 
with stories and anecdotes told by current and former Major League Baseball 
players. The highlight of the series were numerous episodes dedicated to 
the memory and impact of Jackie Robinson as told by teammates, opponents 
and admirers. Radio Baseball Cards aired on 38 stations, including WNBC 
New York, KSFO San Francisco and WEEI Boston, as a pre-game show. A collector's 
edition of the program was re-released in 2007 as a podcast.[7] Drysdale 
conducted all of the National League player interviews for the Baseball 
Talk series in 1988 (Joe Torre did the same for the American League). On 
September 28, 1988, fellow Dodger Orel Hershiser surpassed Drysdale when 
Hershiser finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings 
pitched. In his final start of the year, Hershiser needed to pitch 10 shutout 
innings to set the mark – meaning not only that he would have to prevent 
the San Diego Padres from scoring, but that his own team would also need 
to fail to score in order to ensure extra innings. The Dodgers' anemic 
offense obliged, and Hershiser pitched the first 10 innings of a scoreless 
tie, with the Padres eventually prevailing 2–1 in 16 innings. Hershiser 
almost did not pitch in the 10th inning, in deference to Drysdale, but 
was convinced to take the mound and try to break the record. When Hershiser 
broke Drysdale's record, Drysdale went to hug him, and said, "Oh, I'll 
tell ya, congratulations... And at least you kept it in the family."[citation 
needed] Drysdale also called Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run in Game 1 
of the 1988 World Series[8] for the Dodgers Radio Network: Drysdale married 
Ginger Dubberly in 1958, with whom he had a daughter, Kelly. They divorced 
in 1982. On November 1, 1986, he married basketball player Ann Meyers, 
who took the name Ann Meyers-Drysdale. Drysdale and Meyers had three children 
together: Don Junior ("DJ") (son), Darren (son), and Drew (daughter). In 
1990, Drysdale published his autobiography, Once a Bum, Always a Dodger. 
Drysdale was 56 when he died of a heart attack in room 2518 of Le Centre 
Sheraton in Montreal, Quebec, on July 3, 1993.[3][9] Radio station employees 
were sent to look for him when he did not appear for the bus ride to Olympic 
Stadium, where the Dodgers were scheduled to play the Montreal Expos. Hotel 
staff entered his room and found him face down, near his bed. The coroner 
estimated that he had been dead for 18 hours. Drysdale's broadcasting colleague 
Vin Scully, who was instructed not to say anything on the air until Drysdale's 
family was notified, announced the news of his death by saying, "Never 
have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this 
one. And I say it to you as best I can with a broken heart."[10] Fellow 
broadcaster Ross Porter told his radio audience, "I just don't believe 
it, folks." While this was going on, word reached Drysdale's former White 
Sox colleague Ken Harrelson as he was calling that evening's game against 
the Baltimore Orioles; an emotional Harrelson had trouble relaying the 
news to the viewing audience. Drysdale was replaced by Rick Monday in the 
broadcast booth. Among the personal belongings found in Drysdale's hotel 
room was a cassette tape of Robert F. Kennedy's victory speech after the 
1968 California Democratic presidential primary, a speech given only moments 
before Senator Kennedy's assassination. In the speech, Kennedy had noted, 
to the cheers of the crowd, that Drysdale had pitched his sixth straight 
shutout that evening. Drysdale had apparently carried the tape with him 
wherever he went since Kennedy's murder.[11] Drysdale's body was cremated 
at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Drysdale 
was a popular guest star in several television programs: The number "53" 
used for Disney's Herbie the Love Bug was inspired by Drysdale.[16] Drysdale 
also appeared as himself (pitching) in the 1962 thriller, Experiment in
