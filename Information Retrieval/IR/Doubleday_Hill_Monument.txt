The Doubleday Hill Monument is an American Civil War monument located in 
Williamsport, Maryland, in what is now River View Cemetery. Erected in 
1897,[1] the monument commemorates the crossing of the Potomac River and 
occupation of the hill by Major General Abner Doubleday. The monument, 
also known Doubleday Hill, overlooks the Potomac River into West Virginia. 
The monument also credits Doubleday with creating the game of baseball 
in 1835, an unlikely claim which Doubleday himself never made. A popular 
legend circulating at the time of the monument's erection claimed that 
Doubleday invented baseball in 1839, although Doubleday was attending West 
Point that year.[2] Doubleday Hill was a deviation from the more popular 
form of late 19th and early 20th century monuments: the statue of a standing, 
uniformed soldier. Between the years of 1863 through 1919, monuments often 
depicted a soldier “standing holding the barrel of a rifle that rests upright 
on the ground in front of him."[3] This more common form was particularly 
prevalent from 1880 to 1920.[4] Monuments placed at locations other than 
battlefieldd parks during the years 1863 to 1919 normally honored soldiers 
and sailors from the same town, county, or state where the monument was 
erected.[5] The Doubleday Hill monument differed from this practice by 
celebrating occupation of the site by Doubleday, who was from Ballston 
Spa, New York.[6] Doubleday Hill Monument shown with Flag and Cannon Doubleday
