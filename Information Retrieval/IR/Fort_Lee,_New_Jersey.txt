Fort Lee is a borough at the eastern border of Bergen County, New Jersey, 
United States, in the New York City Metropolitan Area, situated atop the 
Hudson Palisades. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population 
was 35,345,[9][22] reflecting a decline of 116 (−0.3%) from the 35,461 
counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 3,464 (+10.8%) 
from the 31,997 counted in the 1990 Census.[23] The borough is the western 
terminus of the George Washington Bridge and is located across the Hudson 
River from the Manhattan borough of New York City. Named for the site of 
an early American Revolutionary War military encampment,[24] it later became 
the birthplace of the American film industry. According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.888 square miles (7.478 km2), 
including 2.541 square miles (6.581 km2) of land and 0.347 square miles 
(0.898 km2) of water (12.00%).[1][2] The borough is situated atop the escarpment 
of the Hudson Palisades on the peninsula between the Hackensack and Hudson 
rivers. The borough is bisected by the confluence of roads at GWB Plaza 
leading to the George Washington Bridge. Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the borough include 
Coytesville, Palisade and Taylorville.[25][26] The borough borders Cliffside 
Park, Edgewater, Englewood, Englewood Cliffs, Leonia, Palisades Park, Ridgefield.[27] 
and the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan. Given its evolving 
cosmopolitan ambiance[28] and adjacent proximity to Manhattan, Fort Lee 
is one of Northern New Jersey's Hudson Waterfront communities that has 
been called New York City's Sixth Borough,[29][30] Fort Lee is named for 
General Charles Lee[28] after George Washington and his troops had camped 
at Mount Constitution overlooking Burdett's Landing, in defense of New 
York City. It was during Washington's retreat in November 1776 (beginning 
along a road which is now Main Street) that Thomas Paine composed his pamphlet, 
The American Crisis, which began with the recognized phrase, "These are 
the times that try men's souls." These events are recalled at Monument 
Park and Fort Lee Historic Park. Fort Lee was formed by an act of the New 
Jersey Legislature on March 29, 1904, from the remaining portions of Ridgefield 
Township.[31][32] With the creation of Fort Lee, Ridgefield Township became 
defunct and was dissolved as of March 29, 1904.[33] The Fort Lee Police 
Department was formed under borough ordinance on August 9, 1904, and originally 
consisted of six marshals.[34] The history of cinema in the United States 
can trace its roots to the East Coast where, at one time, Fort Lee was 
the motion picture capital of America. The industry got its start at the 
end of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison's "Black 
Maria", the first motion picture studio in West Orange, New Jersey. New 
Jersey offered land at costs considerably less than New York City, and 
the cities and towns on the North River (Hudson River) and Hudson Palisades 
benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry 
at the turn of the 20th century.[35][36][37] Film-making began attracting 
both capital and an innovative workforce, and when the Kalem Company began 
using Fort Lee in 1907 as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers 
quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios, the Champion 
Film Company, built the first studio.[38] They were quickly followed by 
others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in Fort Lee. 
In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the Independent Moving Pictures 
Company, Peerless Studios, The Solax Company, Éclair Studios, Goldwyn Picture 
Corporation, American Méliès (Star Films), World Film Company, Biograph 
Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Pathé Frères, Metro Pictures Corporation, 
Victor Film Company, and Selznick Pictures Corporation were all making 
pictures in Fort Lee. Such notables as Mary Pickford got their start at 
Biograph Studios.[39][40][41] With the offshoot businesses that sprang 
up to service, the film studios, for nearly two decades Fort Lee experienced 
unrivaled prosperity. However, just as the development of Fort Lee production 
facilities were gaining strength, Nestor Studios of Bayonne, New Jersey, 
built the first studio in Hollywood in 1911.[42] Nestor Studios, owned 
by David and William Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios; and 
William Horsley's other company, Hollywood Film Laboratory, is now the 
oldest existing company in Hollywood, now called the Hollywood Digital 
Laboratory. California's more hospitable and cost-effective climate led 
to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the West Coast by 
the 1930s. At the time, Thomas Edison owned almost all the patents relevant 
to motion picture production. Movie producers on the East Coast acting 
independently of Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company were often sued 
or enjoined by Edison and his agents, while movie makers working on the 
West Coast could work independently of Edison's control.[43] Television 
and film in New Jersey remains an important industry. Since 2000, the Fort 
Lee Film Commission has been charged with celebrating the history of film 
in Fort Lee, as well as attracting film and television production companies 
to the borough.[44] In 1957, market researcher James Vicary claimed that 
quickly flashing messages on a movie screen, in Fort Lee, had influenced 
people to purchase more food and drinks. Vicary coined the term subliminal 
advertising and formed the Subliminal Projection Company based on a six-week 
test. Vicary claimed that during the presentation of the movie Picnic he 
used a tachistoscope to project the words "Drink Coca-Cola" and "Hungry? 
Eat popcorn" for 1/3000 of a second at five-second intervals. Vicary asserted 
that during the test, sales of popcorn and Coke in that New Jersey theater 
increased 57.8% and 18.1% respectively.[45][46] In 1962, Vicary admitted 
to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results, the story itself 
being a marketing ploy.[47][48] An identical experiment conducted by Henry 
Link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales.[46] The claim that the 
small cinema handled 45,699 visitors in six weeks has led people to believe 
that Vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all.[46] The Fort 
Lee lane closure scandal, also known as Bridgegate, was a political scandal 
that occurred as a result of the concerns about the actions taken by the 
staff of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his Port Authority appointees 
to create a traffic jam in Fort Lee when dedicated toll lanes for one of 
the Fort Lee entrances to the upper level on the George Washington Bridge 
were reduced from three to one from September 9, 2013, to September 13, 
2013.[49][50] One of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish 
Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not supporting the Republican 
Chris Christie in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. Another theory 
was that Christie or his aides sought to punish New Jersey Senate majority 
leader, Loretta Weinberg, who represented the New Jersey district containing 
Fort Lee, as retribution for the Democrats' blocking of Christie's reappointment 
of a New Jersey Supreme Court justice. Christie withdrew his appointee 
consideration and delivered a speech referring to New Jersey Senate Democrats 
as "animals" just one day before emails were sent by Christie's aides to 
the Port Authority requesting the lane closures.[51] At the turn of the 
21st century, Fort Lee saw a large Korean migration which has converted 
much of the town into a large Koreatown,[52] in that many traditional Korean 
stores and restaurants may be seen in Fort Lee, and the hangul letters 
of the Korean alphabet are as common as signs in English in parts of the 
downtown area. This Koreatown is separate from the similar Korean enclave 
in the adjacent town of Palisades Park.[52] The rapid increase of the Korean 
population has seen the decline of many other immigrant communities once 
centered in Fort Lee, notably the Greek and Italian communities, once quite 
large but now all but extinct. A sizable Russian immigrant community has 
also sprung up in recent years. In March 2011 about 2,500 Japanese-Americans 
were living in Edgewater and Fort Lee, the largest concentration of Japanese-Americans 
in New Jersey.[61] There were 1,119 Fort Lee residents who filed claims 
to recover lost money from the Madoff investment scandal, the most from 
any ZIP code.[62] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 35,345 people, 
16,371 households, and 9,364 families residing in the borough. The population 
density was 13,910.9 per square mile (5,371.0/km2). There were 17,818 housing

has brought their Shakespeare in the Park touring shows to Fort Lee in 
"Shakespeare Tuesdays". The group now performs regularly at Monument Park 
(1588 Palisade Avenue, next to the Fort Lee Museum) with 2 Tuesday shows 
per month for each month of the summer. The festival also tours similar 
dates in Hackensack.[68] Fort Lee is governed under the Borough form of 
New Jersey municipal government. The government consists of a Mayor and 
a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected 
at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. 
A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. 
The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year 
terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each 
year in a three-year cycle.[7] The Borough form of government used by Fort 
Lee, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong 
council" government in which council members act as the legislative body 
with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a 
tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds 
majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments 
for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the 
advice and consent of the council.[69][70] As of 2016[update], the Mayor 
of Fort Lee is Democrat Mark Sokolich, whose term of office ends December 
31, 2019.[3] Members of the Borough Council are Council President Ila Kasofsky 
(D, 2016), Harvey Sohmer (D, 2018), Joseph L. Cervieri Jr. (D, 2018), Armand 
Pohan (D, 2017), Michael Sargenti (D, 2017) and Peter J. Suh (D, 2016).[71][72][73][74][75][76] 
Fort Lee is located in the 9th Congressional District[77] and is part of 
New Jersey's 37th state legislative district.[22][78][79] Prior to the

by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[88] As of 2015[update], 
the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; term ends December 
31, 2018).[89] The seven freeholders are elected at-large in partisan elections 
on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election each 
year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman Pro Tempore selected 
from among its members at a reorganization meeting held each January.[90] 
Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman Joan Voss (D, 2017; 
Fort Lee),[91] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; North Arlington)[92]

The Fort Lee Volunteer Ambulance Corps, founded in 1971, provides emergency 
medical services to the Borough of Fort Lee, the George Washington Bridge, 
and the Palisades Interstate Parkway. One of the largest EMS agencies in 
the surrounding area, the Fort Lee Volunteer Ambulance Corps operates a 
fleet of four medium-duty ambulances, one first responder vehicle, and 
two command vehicles from its headquarters on the corner of Main Street 
and Anderson Avenue. In 2011, the agency purchased a new state-of-the-art 
ambulance, designated FLA-1, in order to begin retiring some of its aging 
ambulances. The agency plans to purchase a second ambulance sometime in 
2013. With approximately 50 active members, the corps operates 24 hours 
a day on weekends and from 7 PM to 6 AM on weekdays, with paid borough 
employees staffing the ambulances during the day on weekdays. The Fort 
Lee Volunteer Ambulance Corps responds to approximately 3,400 emergency 
medical calls annually. The corps is a member agency of the East Bergen 
Ambulance Association (EBAA) with a standing mutual aid agreement with 
surrounding East Bergen boroughs.[114] Fort Lee is protected around the 
clock by the volunteer firefighters of the Fort Lee Fire Department, which 
was founded in 1888 when the borough was still a part of Ridgefield Township

Cole Middle School[124] (7&8; 552) and Fort Lee High School[125] (9–12; 
996).[126] During the 2010–11 school year, School #3 was awarded the National 
Blue Ribbon School Award of Excellence by the United States Department 
of Education, the highest award an American school can receive, one of 
only ten schools statewide to be honored.[127] The school was one of three 
in Bergen County honored that year.[128] Public school students from the 
borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary 
education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which 
include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech 
campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs on a shared-time 
or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective application process 
and tuition covered by the student's home school district.[129][130] Private
