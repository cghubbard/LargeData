Rafael Palmeiro Corrales (born September 24, 1964) is a retired Cuban American 
Major League Baseball first baseman and left fielder. Palmeiro was an All-American 
at Mississippi State University before being drafted by the Chicago Cubs 
in 1985. He played for the Cubs (1986–1988), Texas Rangers (1989–1993, 
1999–2003), and the Baltimore Orioles (1994–1998, 2004–2005). He was named 
to the MLB All-Star Team four times, and won the Gold Glove three times. 
He is a member of the 500 home run club and the 3,000 hit club and is one 
of only five players in history to be a member of both. Days after recording 
his 3,000th hit, Palmeiro was suspended for testing positive for an anabolic 
steroid. Palmeiro was born in Havana, Cuba and graduated from Miami Jackson 
High School in Miami, Florida. Although he was drafted by the New York 
Mets in the 8th round of the 1982 draft, he did not sign. Palmeiro was 
recruited by Ron Polk and enrolled at Mississippi State University, where 
he played college baseball for the Bulldogs in the Southeastern Conference 
(SEC). He is the only SEC player to have ever won the triple crown. A teammate 
of Will Clark, the two were known as "Thunder and Lightning".[1] Clark 
and Palmeiro were known to dislike each other, dating back to their time 
at Mississippi State.[2] On June 11, 1985, Palmeiro signed with the Chicago 
Cubs as the 22nd pick in the 1st round of the 1985 draft.[3] Palmeiro debuted 
on September 8, 1986 in a game between the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia 
Phillies at Wrigley Field, as a left fielder.[4] During his tenure with 
the Cubs, he normally played left field, though occasionally he would play 
other outfield positions or first base. Palmeiro was the runner up to National 
League batting champion Tony Gwynn in 1988 with a .307 batting average, 
only six points below Gwynn's. During that year rumors spread about a relationship 
between Palmiero and Ryne Sandberg's wife, Cindy. This led to issues in 
the locker room and after the 1988 season, Palmeiro was traded by the Cubs 
to the Texas Rangers along with Jamie Moyer and Drew Hall in exchange for 
Mitch Williams, Paul Kilgus, Steve Wilson, Curtis Wilkerson, Luis Benitez, 
and Pablo Delgado. Upon moving to the American League, Palmeiro was primarily 
used as a first baseman or designated hitter. Palmeiro blossomed as a hitter 
while with the Rangers, leading the league in hits in 1990 and doubles 
in 1991. In 1990, he was third in the American League in batting. Prior 
to Palmeiro's 1995 season, he had hit more than 30 home runs only once 
(37 in 1993). Starting in 1995, Palmeiro began a streak of 38+ home run 
years that continued through the 2003 season. He hit 373 home runs during 
this nine-season span, while also driving in over 100 runs in each of these 
seasons. However, Palmeiro never led the league in home runs, and is history's 
most prolific home run hitter to have never won the home run crown. On 
May 11, 2003, Palmeiro hit his 500th home run off David Elder in a game 
against the Cleveland Indians. Two years later, Palmeiro joined Hank Aaron, 
Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez, and Eddie Murray as the only players in major 
league history to get 3,000 hits and 500 home runs when he got his 3,000th 
base hit off Joel Piñeiro during a game against the Seattle Mariners on 
July 15, 2005. Because most of Palmeiro's home runs came with the Rangers 
and Orioles, he is one of only four players in history to hit at least 
200 home runs for two different clubs. Palmeiro played in 2,831 major league 
games, the most by any player who never played in the World Series. Palmeiro 
won three straight Gold Glove awards as a first baseman in the American 
League from 1997–1999. His 1999 award was highly controversial because 
Palmeiro had played just 28 games at first base,[5][6][7] compared to 128 
games as the designated hitter. Palmeiro filed for free agency on October 
29, 2005, indicating he would attempt to play his 20th season in baseball. 
On September 17, 2015, it was announced that Palmeiro would sign with the 
Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball to 
play alongside his son, Patrick Palmeiro.[8] He started for the first time 
for the Skeeters on September 18, 2015. Skeeter fans quickly gave him the 
nickname "The Saccharin Slugger."[9] Palmeiro was inducted into the Mississippi 
State University Hall of Fame on October 11, 2008.[10] In 2009, he was 
inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.[11] In 2012 Rafael 
Palmeiro was inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.[12] Palmeiro 
became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2011. He 
received 64 votes, or 11.0 percent of total ballots cast; the threshold 
for entry is 75 percent. According to Barry M. Bloom on Major League Baseball's 
official website: "Palmeiro should have been a sure-fire first-ballot inductee, 
as a member of the 500-homer, 3,000-hit club, but was suspended in 2005 
after testing positive for steroid use. He received only 11 percent of 
the vote.".[13] On January 8, 2014, Palmeiro received insufficient support 
to remain on the HOF ballot in future years, when he received only 25, 
or 4.4% of votes.[14] Former Rangers teammate José Canseco identified Palmeiro 
as a fellow steroid user in his 2005 book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 
'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, and claimed he personally injected 
Palmeiro with steroids. On March 17, 2005, Palmeiro appeared at a Congressional 
hearing about steroids in baseball and, while under oath, denied ever using 
steroids and stated, "Let me start by telling you this: I have never used 
steroids, period. I don't know how to say it any more clearly than that. 
Never."[15] On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro was suspended for ten days after 
testing positive for a steroid.[16] The Washington Post reported that the 
steroid detected in Palmeiro's system was a "serious" one.[17] According 
to The New York Times, Palmeiro tested positive for the potent anabolic 
steroid stanozolol.[18] In a public statement, Palmeiro disclosed that 
an appeal of the suspension had already been denied. He released a statement 
saying, "I have never intentionally used steroids. Never. Ever. Period. 
Ultimately, although I never intentionally put a banned substance into 
my body, the independent arbitrator ruled that I had to be suspended under 
the terms of the program."[19] According to Palmeiro, all of his previous 
tests over the two years including the 2003 sealed test were negative, 
and a test he took just three weeks after his positive test was also negative.[20] 
The House Government Reform Committee would not seek perjury charges against 
Palmeiro, although they were not clearing him.[21] Palmeiro returned to 
Camden Yards following his 10-day suspension on August 11, 2005, although 
he did not play in the lineup until August 14. Coincidentally, this was 
the date that had been planned as "Rafael Palmeiro Appreciation Day" in 
celebration of his 500-home run, 3,000-hit milestone. It was canceled after 
Palmeiro's suspension.[citation needed] The Baltimore Sun reported that 
Palmeiro never offered an explanation for his positive test to the MLB 
arbitration panel, which ran contrary to his public statements.[22] ESPN 
later reported that Palmeiro implicated Miguel Tejada to baseball's arbitration 
panel, suggesting a supplement provided to him by Tejada was responsible 
for his positive test. This supplement was supposedly vitamin B12, though 
it could have been tainted.[23] Tejada and two unnamed teammates provided 
B12 samples to the panel, which did not contain stanozolol. However, the 
committee did say they found "substantial inconsistencies between Mr. Tejada's 
accounts and the accounts of players A and B."[24] Tejada, who said he 
received shipments of B12 from the Dominican Republic, was later implicated 
for steroid use in the Mitchell Report.[25] Palmeiro continues to strongly 
deny ever having used steroids intentionally, telling The Baltimore Sun 
in June 2006, "Yes sir, that's what happened. It's not a story; it's the 
reality of what happened", and "I said what I said before Congress because 
I meant every word of it."[26] Palmeiro passed a polygraph test in which 
he was not asked if he ever used steroids, but in which he did state that 
he unknowingly ingested them via a B12 injection.[24][27] A 2005 New York 
Times article expressed one writer's belief that Palmeiro's story could 
perhaps be the truth.[28] In December 2007, Palmeiro was included in the 
Mitchell Report in which it was alleged that he used performance-enhancing 
drugs during his career. The report did not provide any new evidence and 
only recapped allegations made by José Canseco, Palmeiro's appearance before 
Congress, and his subsequent failed drug test. The report also details 
a conversation Larry Bigbie alleges he had with Palmeiro where he claims 
"Palmeiro asked him about his source of steroids and human growth hormone 
(the source was Kirk Radomski) and how the substances made him feel." Bigbie 
also stated that "Palmeiro denied in those conversations that he had ever 
used performance-enhancing substances himself."[29] On December 20, 2007, 
Palmeiro was also named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as a user 
of amphetamines prior to their being banned by MLB.[30] Palmeiro lives 
in Colleyville, Texas with his wife.[31] His son Preston plays for North 
Carolina State University and was recently drafted by the Baltimore Orioles 
organization .[32] Italics denotes active player Italics denotes active
