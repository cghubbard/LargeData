Jacques Doucet (born March 8, 1940, Montreal)[1] was the French radio play-by-play 
voice for the Montreal Expos from 1972 to 2004. He is currently the French 
play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue Jays on TVA Sports. He began his 
career in 1959 as a translator for the Canadian Press news agency.[1] After 
one year in 1960–1961 as a sports journalist for the short-lived Nouveau 
Journal daily, he went to La Presse in 1962, still as a sports journalist, 
where he remained until early 1972.[1] During a long strike in 1964 at 
La Presse, he had a brief first experience in sports broadcasting, for 
Montreal Alouettes football games. He got the assignment as the Montreal 
Expos beat writer for La Presse as soon as the franchise was awarded to 
Montreal in 1968,[2] in addition to being the official scorer for games 
at Jarry Park. Sometime in the middle of the Expos' first season in 1969, 
he was asked to replace from time to time Jean-Pierre Roy as colour commentator[1] 
on the now-defunct CKLM 1570, which held the French radio broadcast rights, 
as Roy moved to TV broadcasts once a week. In 1972, as CKAC 730 became 
the Expos' new French radio flagship, Doucet was hired by the (now-defunct) 
Télémédia network to do play-by-play for all Montreal Expos games,[1] in 
addition to the All-Star, League Championship and World Series games and 
a selection of pre-season Expos games. When Télémédia merged with Radiomutuel 
on September 30, 1994, creating the new Radiomédia network, he became an 
Expos employee and continued to do play-by-play but only for Montreal Expos 
games, which continued to be aired mostly on CKAC 730 until the end of 
2003. (He was heard for a few games on CKVL 850 (now CINF 690) in 1995, 
and on CJMS 1040 in 2002 and 2003. CHMP-FM 98.5 took over as the French 
radio flagship in 2004 for the last season of the Expos in Montreal). Over 
his career, Doucet described more than 5,000 Major League Baseball games,[3] 
including two perfect games (by Dennis Martínez in 1991 against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers and by New York Yankees pitcher David Cone against the 
Expos in 1999). He was introduced in the Quebec Baseball Hall of Fame in 
2002,[1][4] in the Expos Hall of Fame in 2003[4] and in the Canadian Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 2004.[4] While fans hope he will be recognized by the Cooperstown 
Baseball Hall of Fame via the Ford C. Frick Award,[5] this has not occurred 
yet (although he has been a finalist five times, including in 2011).[6][7] 
Doucet has been described as "the French-Canadian equivalent of Jaime Jarrín"[5] 
and even as "Canada's Vin Scully",[5] but it has been noted that "because 
he broadcast games in French, few of the people who cast final votes for 
admission to Cooperstown have heard Doucet work",[8] and that the language 
barrier might keep Doucet out of Cooperstown;[8] at least one observer 
has suggested that Doucet has failed to win the Award because he is not 
an American.[9] In March 2005 he became the official spokesperson for Encore 
Baseball Montreal, an organization initially created to keep the Expos 
in Montreal and which is now focused on promoting baseball in Quebec.[10] 
In June 2005, Doucet's efforts to create a French-language version of standard 
baseball terminology were underlined at length in a front-page story by 
the Wall Street Journal.[11] From 2006 to 2011, Jacques Doucet was the 
play-by-play voice for the home games of the Quebec Capitales.[6][12] The 
Capitales play in the Can-Am League, an eight-team independent baseball 
league; their games are heard on CHRC 800 in Quebec City. In August 2011, 
Doucet was hired by TVA Sports, a new sports television channel which went 
on the air a month later, as the play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue 
Jays.[3] In collaboration with Marc Robitaille, Jacques Doucet has published 
a two-volume history of the Montreal Expos titled Il était une fois les 
Expos. The first volume was published in 2009[13] and the second volume 
was published in 2011.[14] He had previously published, in 1980, in collaboration
