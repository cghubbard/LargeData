Ronald Charles Cey (/ˈseɪ/; born February 15, 1948) is an American former 
professional baseball player, a third baseman in the major leagues. He 
played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1971–82), Chicago Cubs (1983–86), and 
Oakland Athletics (1987). Cey batted and threw right-handed; a popular 
player, he was nicknamed "The Penguin" for his slow waddling running gait 
by his college coach, Chuck "Bobo" Brayton.[1][2] Born and raised in Tacoma, 
Washington, Cey was a multi-sport athlete at Mount Tahoma High School, 
its first to earn nine varsity letters.[2] Following graduation in 1966, 
he attended Washington State University in Pullman and was a member of 
Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Cey played two years of college baseball for 
the Cougars, on the freshman team in 1967, and a year on the varsity under 
head coach Brayton in 1968.[1][2][3] He was selected in the second phase 
of the 1968 MLB draft in June.[4] With the Dodgers, third baseman Cey was 
part of an All-Star infield that included Steve Garvey (first baseman), 
Davey Lopes (second baseman) and Bill Russell (shortstop). This quartet 
was the most enduring infield in baseball history[citation needed]. The 
four infielders stayed together as the Dodgers' starters for eight and 
a half years. Cey was one of the most productive and adept-fielding National 
League third basemen in the 1970s, but was overshadowed by Pete Rose and 
Mike Schmidt. In 1977, he was named NL Player of the Month in April after 
helping the Dodgers to a fast start by batting .425 with 9 home runs and 
a ML record 29 RBIs for the month of April.[5] The Dodgers won the Western 
Division title that season on their way to the National League pennant. 
Cey continued to have productive seasons with the Dodgers, helping them 
to pennants in 1978 and 1981. After the 1982 season, the Dodgers traded 
Cey to the Chicago Cubs for two minor leaguers so that Pedro Guerrero could 
move to third base and rookie Mike Marshall could get in the Dodgers' outfield. 
Cey provided veteran leadership for the Cubs over four seasons and, in 
1984, helped lead the Cubs to the National League East Division title, 
hitting 25 homers and driving in 97 runs, both team highs. Cey spent the 
final year of his career in 1987 as a part-time player with the Oakland 
A's. In a 17-season career, Cey was a .261 hitter with 316 home runs and 
1139 RBI in 2073 games. Cey played in the 1981 World Series, helping the 
Dodgers to four straight victories after losing their first two games, 
including his return for the clinching Game 6 after being hit in the head 
by a wild Goose Gossage fastball, and helped off the field in Game 5. Cey 
was named co-MVP along with Steve Yeager and Pedro Guerrero, and won the 
annual Babe Ruth Award.[6] He is still a part of the Dodgers organization
