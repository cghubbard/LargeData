The Louisville Bats are an American minor league professional baseball 
franchise based in Louisville, Kentucky. The Bats are the Triple-A affiliate 
of the Cincinnati Reds. The team, formerly known as the Louisville RiverBats, 
plays in the International League. The Bats play their home games at Louisville 
Slugger Field; the naming rights for the stadium were purchased by Hillerich 
& Bradsby, makers of the famous Louisville Slugger baseball bat.[citation

the American Association, the Redbirds, from Springfield, Illinois to Louisville. 
During the 1982 season, the Louisville Redbirds broke the minor league 
attendance record by drawing 868,418 fans. In 1983, the Redbirds were the 
first minor league team to draw over one million fans in a single season 
(1,052,438). The Redbirds' success during the 1980s led to some speculation 
that Louisville could be a potential market for Major League Baseball expansion;[3] 
however this did not come to pass. In 1998, the American Association folded 
and the teams moved to either the International League or the Pacific Coast 
League. The league changed and expanded to Memphis and Durham, and the 
Cardinals shifted their Triple-A affiliation to Memphis, Tennessee and 
the new Memphis Redbirds not-for-profit franchise. In 1998 and 1999, Louisville 
was affiliated with the Milwaukee Brewers and since 2000 with the Cincinnati 
Reds.[4][5] From the time the Redbirds arrived in 1982 until the 1999 season, 
they played their home games at Cardinal Stadium (formally called Fairgrounds 
Stadium), located at the Kentucky Exposition Center, which seated over 
30,000, (largest quoted as 34,330) allowing for the broken attendance records. 
In 1999, when the Redbirds became affiliated with the Brewers, they took 
the name Louisville RiverBats. In 2000 the team moved to Louisville Slugger 
Field, a new stadium in downtown Louisville, seating 13,131 with a more 
intimate baseball setting than at Cardinal Stadium. Spectators enter the 
stadium through the restored "train shed" building, which was formerly 
the Brinly-Hardy Co. warehouse.[6] In 2002 the team dropped the word "River" 
from its name and became simply known as the Louisville Bats. While the 
logo and mascot consist of the winged mammal, the bat is also synonymous 
with the Louisville Slugger baseball bat.[7] The team's attendance was 
about 685,000 in the first season of Louisville Slugger Field and 663,961 
the following year.[8] Traditionally one of the top-drawing minor league 
teams, the Bats' attendance in 2011 was second of all minor league teams 
with an average of 8,716 per game.[9] In 2016, Forbes listed the Bats as 
the 11th-most valuable Minor League Baseball team with a value of $36 million.[10] 
The Bats have once won the Governors' Cup—the championship of the IL—and 
twice played in the championship series. Note: The Bats were ahead 1-0 
in the championship series when the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred. 
The league canceled the rest of the series and declared the Bats the champions, 
thus the series was reduced to being a championship game. Under Jim Fregosi's 
leadership from 1983 to 1986, the Redbirds won the American Association 
title in 1984 and 1985, and were the league runner up in 1983, when they 
won the Eastern Division. The team later won another AA championship in 
1995. The Bats have retired one number, number 8, in honor of catcher Corky 
Miller. This list contains former Louisville players who have played in
