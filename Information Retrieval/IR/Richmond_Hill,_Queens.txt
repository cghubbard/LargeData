Richmond Hill is a racially and culturally integrated urban neighborhood 
in southwestern Queens County, a borough of New York City. It abuts Kew 
Gardens (North), Jamaica (East), Ozone and South Ozone Park (South), and 
Woodhaven (West). The neighborhood is split between Queens Community Board 
9 and 10.[1] Main commercial streets in the neighborhood include Jamaica 
Avenue, Atlantic Avenue and Liberty Avenue; Richmond Hill is home to a 
density of Christian churches (both major denominations and storefront), 
Sikh centers, Hindu temples, Jewish synagogues and mosques. Richmond Hill 
is known as Little Guyana, for its large Guyanese immigrant population, 
as well as Little Punjab, for its large Punjabi immigrant population.[2] 
Many residents own their own homes, and some rent out apartments in them. 
There are also some small apartment buildings. Commercial strips along 
Jamaica and Liberty Avenue contain mixed use buildings. Atlantic Avenue 
is commercial. A Long Island Railroad spur and yard provides freight access 
for business at Jamaica Avenue and Lefferts Boulevard. The ZIP code for 
Richmond Hill is 11419. Richmond Hill is located between Kew Gardens and 
Forest Park to the north, Jamaica and South Jamaica to the east, South 
Ozone Park to the south, and Woodhaven and Ozone Park to the west. Hillside 
Avenue forms its northern boundary with Kew Gardens east of Lefferts Boulevard, 
while Forest Park and the right-of-way of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR)'s 
Montauk Branch form its northern edge west of Lefferts. Its western boundary 
north of Atlantic Avenue is formed by the LIRR's abandoned Rockaway Beach 
Branch; south of Atlantic, the western border lies between 104th and 107th 
Streets. The southern border extends to around 103rd Avenue or Liberty 
Avenue. The Van Wyck Expressway abuts the eastern end of the community.[3][4][5][6] 
The portion of the neighborhood south of Atlantic Avenue is also known 
as South Richmond Hill.[2] The hill referred to as Richmond Hill is a moraine 
created by debris and rocks collected while glaciers advanced down North 
America during the Wisconsin glaciation.[7][8] Prior to European colonization, 
the land was occupied by the Rockaway Native American group, for which 
the Rockaways were named.[9][10][11][12][13] In 1660, the Welling family 
purchased land in what was then the western portion of the colonial town 
of Rustdorp. The land would become the Welling Farm, while Rustdorp would 
be renamed Jamaica under British rule in 1664.[14] The Battle of Long Island, 
one of the bloodiest battles of the Revolutionary War, was fought in 1776 
along the ridge in present-day Forest Park, near what is now the golf course 
clubhouse. Protected by its thickly wooded area, American riflemen used 
guerrilla warfare tactics to attack and defeat the advancing Hessians.[15][16] 
One of the sites that would make up modern Richmond Hill, Lefferts Farm, 
was said to be the site of a Revolutionary War battle.[9] In January 1853, 
a Farming community was established on the south side of Jamaica Avenue 
between 110th and 112th Streets, known as Clarenceville. This land was 
purchased from the Welling estate.[14][17][18] Richmond Hill's name was 
inspired either by a suburban town near London or by Edward Richmond, a 
landscape architect in the mid-19th century who designed much of the neighborhood.[7][19] 
In 1868, Albon Platt Man, a successful Manhattan lawyer, purchased the 
Lefferts, Welling, and Bergen farms along with other plots amounting to 
400 acres of land, and hired Richmond to lay out the community. The tract 
extended as far north as White Pot Road (now Kew Gardens Road) near modern 
Queens Boulevard;[7][9][10][17][18][20][21] The area reminded Man of the 
London suburb, where his family resided.[22] Man's sons would later found 
the nearby Kew Gardens neighborhood from the northern portion of the land.[17][18][23][19] 
Streets, schools, a church, and a railroad were built in Richmond Hill 
over the next decade, thus making the area one of the earliest residential 
communities on Long Island. The streets were laid down to match the geography 
of the area.[7][17][21] The development of area was facilitated by the 
opening of two railroad stations. These were the Clarenceville station 
on the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad, at Atlantic Avenue and Greenwood 
Avenue (now 111th Street); and the Richmond Hill station at Park Street 
(now Hillside Avenue) near Jamaica and Lefferts Avenues on the Montauk 
railroad line between Long Island City and eastern Long Island.[14][24] 
By 1872, a post office was established in the neighborhood,[9][25][26] 
while the Clarenceville neighborhood was merged into Richmond Hill.[17] 
Richmond Hill was incorporated as an independent village in 1894, by which 
time it had also absorbed the Morris Park neighborhood, which had been 
established in 1885.[17][18][27] In 1898, Richmond Hill and the rest of 
Queens county were consolidated into the City of Greater New York.[17][27] 
The BMT Fulton Street Line was extended east along Liberty Avenue into 
the area on September 25, 1915, terminating at Lefferts Avenue (now Lefferts 
Boulevard).[28] The area received further development when the BMT Jamaica 
Line elevated was extended east into the neighborhood at Greenwood Avenue 
(now 111th Street) on May 28, 1917.[17][29] As the neighborhood's population 
continued to grow into the 1920s, smaller closely-spaced houses and apartment 
buildings began to replace large private houses.[17][27] The area is well 
known for its large-frame single-family houses, many of which have been 
preserved since the turn of the 20th century. Many of the Queen Anne Victorian 
homes of old Richmond Hill still stand in the area today.[2][3] The Triangle 
Hofbrau, opened as a hotel in 1893 and as a restaurant in 1893, was a restaurant 
which was frequented by such stars as Mae West in the 1920s and 1930s. 
It sat on the triangular piece of land bordered by Hillside Avenue, Jamaica 
Avenue, and Myrtle Avenue.[17][23][30][31][32] The building has since been 
converted to medical offices.[30][33] Near the northwest corner of Hillside 
Avenue and Myrtle Avenue sat an old time ice cream parlor, Jahn's. It closed 
in late 2007.[30] Between Myrtle Avenue and the Montauk Line railroad is 
a former movie theatre, RKO Keith's Richmond Hill Theater, opened in 1929, 
functioning since 1968 as a bingo hall.[33][34][35] These and several other 
landmarks are located in the vicinity of the "Richmond Hill Triangle", 
bracketed by Jamaica Avenue, Myrtle Avenue, and 117th Street. This was 
historically the commercial center of Richmond Hill.[17][25][26][31][34][36] 
The intersection of Jamaica and Myrtle Avenues is also known as James J. 
Creegan Square.[31][37] The northern edge of Richmond Hill contains the 
Church of the Resurrection. This Episcopalian church is an 1874 structure 
and is the oldest house of worship in Richmond Hill.[23] It was placed 
in the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.[38] Also listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places are Public School 66 and Saint 
Benedict Joseph Labre Parish.[39] Originally, many European families (Italian, 
Dutch, British, Irish, Scots, Danish, and German) lived in Richmond Hill.[17][30] 
In the 1970s, the neighborhood was predominantly Hispanic.[10][17] Today, 
the south side of Richmond Hill consists mostly of South Asian Americans 
(Indians and Bangladeshis) and Caribbean Americans (Trinidadians, Guyanese, 
and Jamaicans), who have steadily emigrated to the United States since 
the 1970s.[17][40] Richmond Hill also has the largest Sikh population in 
the city.[30][4] Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the 
population of Richmond Hill was 62,982, a decrease of 3 (0.0%) from the 
62,985 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 1,171.55 acres (474.11 ha), 
the neighborhood had a population density of 53.8 inhabitants per acre 
(34,400/sq mi; 13,300/km2).[41] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 
11.2% (7,078) White, 11.1% (6,960) African American, 1.0% (657) Native 
American, 27.4% (17,252) Asian, 0.2% (116) Pacific Islander, 6.6% (4,139) 
from other races, and 6.6% (4,136) from two or more races. Hispanic or 
Latino of any race were 36.0% (22,644) of the population.[2][42] WICR, 
1620AM, broadcasts Indo-Caribbean programming from studios on Liberty Avenue 
in South Richmond Hill. Richmond Hill schools are operated by the New York 
City Department of Education. Public elementary schools include: Residents 
are zoned to MS 72. Richmond Hill High School is located in the neighborhood. 
Until June, 2012, the city had planned to close the high school. The city 
had slated the school to close; however, a court ruling prevented the school's 
closure.[48][49] Private schools include: Official government websites:
