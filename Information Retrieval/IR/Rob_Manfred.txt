and business executive who is the tenth and current Commissioner of Baseball. 
He previously served as the Chief Operating Officer of Major League Baseball 
and succeeded Bud Selig as Commissioner on January 25, 2015. Manfred was 
born on September 28, 1958 in Rome, New York.[1] He attended Rome Free 
Academy and graduated in 1976.[2] Manfred enrolled at Le Moyne College 
from 1976 through 1978 before transferring to Cornell University. He graduated 
from Cornell and Harvard Law School.[3][4][5] After law school, he clerked 
for Judge Joseph L. Tauro of the United States District Court for the District 
of Massachusetts. He became a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, focusing 
on labor and employment law.[6][7] In 1987, Manfred began working with 
Major League Baseball (MLB) during collective bargaining.[7] During the 
1994â€“95 MLB strike, he served as outside counsel for the owners.[6] He 
joined MLB on a full-time basis in 1998, serving as the Executive Vice 
President of Economics and League Affairs.[4] Manfred negotiated MLB's

In 2013, Manfred led MLB's investigation of the Biogenesis scandal.[9] 
At the end of the 2013 season, Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig promoted 
Manfred to chief operating officer of MLB.[4] The position had been vacant 
since Bob DuPuy resigned in 2010.[10] Following the announcement of Selig's 
retirement, effective after the 2014 season, Manfred became a finalist 
to succeed him as Commissioner.[11][12] On August 14, 2014, MLB owners 
elected Manfred to succeed Selig, beating Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner 
and MLB executive vice president of business Tim Brosnan.[7] Manfred assumed 
office on January 25, 2015.[13] He stated that his primary goals as commissioner 
were youth outreach, embracing technology, quickening the pace of play, 
strengthening player relations, and creating a more unified business operation.[14] 
As commissioner, Manfred instituted rules before the start of the 2015 
season to address the pace of the game, including having batters remain 
in the batters box and the installation of time clocks to limit the time 
spent around commercial breaks.[15] Growing up in Upstate New York, Manfred 
was a fan of the New York Yankees.[16] His father led the Rome division 
of Revere Copper and Brass, while his mother was a schoolteacher.[8][17] 
He has an older sister and a younger brother.[17] Manfred is married and
