Hohokam Stadium, also known as Dwight W. Patterson Field and formerly Hohokam 
Park (1997–2013), is a 10,500-seat baseball park located in Mesa, Arizona. 
The stadium, named for the Hohokam people who occupied the region from 
approximately AD 1 to the mid-15th century, was completed in January 1997 
after the original Hohokam Stadium was demolished. In 2015, it became the 
spring training home of Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics. The 
2015 stadium and facility refresh for the Oakland A's was led by Populous, 
and Lloyd Civil & Sports Engineering provided the site civil and ball field 
design. Hohokam Stadium has the largest scoreboard in the Cactus League, 
measuring 12 by 16 feet (3.7 by 4.9 m). From 1997 to 2013, the stadium 
was the spring training home of the Chicago Cubs. In 1999, the Cubs drew 
171,681 fans for its 15 home games, an average of 11,445 people per game. 
In 2007, the Cubs established a then Cactus League single-game attendance 
record of 12,906. In 2009, the Cubs established a then Major League Baseball 
and Cactus League single-season attendance record of 203,105 in 19 home 
games with an average per game attendance of 10,690—leading all MLB teams. 
Seven games had average attendance of over 13,000. In 2002, the Arizona 
State University baseball team called Hohokam Park home while the on-campus 
Packard Stadium was being renovated. The stadium hosted the 2010, 2011, 
2012 and 2015 Western Athletic Conference Baseball Tournaments and will 
host the 2016 WAC Tournament.[4][5][6] The original Hohokam Stadium was 
built in 1976 just east of the site of the current stadium.[7] It was known 
as Hohokam Stadium from 1976 to 1995 and Hohokam Park in 1996. The stadium 
also became known as Dwight W. Patterson Field in 1991 with the name carrying 
over to the new stadium when it was built in 1997. From 1977 to 1978, it 
was the spring training home of Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics. 
From 1979 to 1996, the Chicago Cubs used the stadium as their spring training 
home until the stadium was demolished in 1996 and replaced with the current 
stadium in 1997. The Chicago Cubs continued using the stadium until the 
completion of Sloan Park for the 2014 spring training season. That same 
season, Oakland Athletics took over operations of Hohokam Stadium for their
