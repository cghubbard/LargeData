-73.85000 Forest Hills is an upper middle class neighborhood in the borough 
of Queens in New York City. Originally, the area was referred to as "Whitepot".[2] 
Forest Hills is bounded by 62nd Drive, Thornton Place, and Selfridge Street 
to the west, Metropolitan Avenue to the south, Union Turnpike to the east, 
and the Grand Central Parkway to the north. Forest Hills Gardens, with 
its Tudor-style houses, is bounded by Burns Street to the north, Union 
Turnpike to the east, Greenway South and Harrow Street to the south, and 
Tennis Place and Continental Ave to the west. The development of adjacent 
Forest Park, a park on the southern end of Forest Hills, began in 1895. 
Starting in 1896, the landscaping firm of Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot was 
contracted to provide a plan for the park.[3]:428 In 1906, Brooklyn attorney 
Cord Meyer bought abutting land made up of six farms (those of Ascan Bakus, 
Casper Joost-Springsteen, Horatio N. Squire, Abram V. S. Lott, Sarah V. 
Bolmer, and James Van Siclen) and then renamed the aggregated 600 acres 
Forest Hills. There is a street named after Ascan Bakus, Ascan Avenue, 
in Forest Hills today. In 1909, Margaret Sage, who founded the Russell 
Sage Foundation, bought 142 acres (0.57 km2) of land from the Cord Meyer 
Development Company. Grosvenor Atterbury, a renowned architect, was given 
the commission to design Forest Hills Gardens. The neighborhood was planned 
on the model of the garden communities of England. As a result, there are 
many Tudor-style homes in Forest Hills, some more sprawling ones located 
in Forest Hills Gardens while most are located in the Cord-Meyer section 
(loosely bounded by 68th Avenue on the north; 72nd Road on the south; 108th 
Street on the west; and Grand Central Parkway on the east).[4] The construction 
of this area used a prefabricated building technique; each house was built 
from approximately 170 standardized precast concrete panels, fabricated 
off-site and positioned by crane.[5] In 1913, the West Side Tennis Club 
moved from Manhattan to Forest Hills Gardens. The U.S. Open and its predecessor 
national championships were held there until 1978, making Forest Hills 
synonymous with tennis for generations. Based on data from the 2010 United 
States Census, the population of Forest Hills was 83,728, a decrease of 
1,318 (1.5%) from the 85,046 counted in 2000. Covering an area of 1,328.22 
acres (537.51 ha), the neighborhood had a population density of 63.0 inhabitants 
per acre (40,300/sq mi; 15,600/km2).[1] The racial makeup of the neighborhood 
was 58.3% (48,822) White, 2.5% (2,086) African American, 0.1% (63) Native 
American, 24.2% (20,233) Asian, 0.0% (22) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (373) 
from other races, and 2.1% (1,719) from two or more races. Hispanic or 
Latino of any race were 12.4% (10,410) of the population.[6] Historically, 
Forest Hills has had many German and American Jewish residents.[citation 
needed] This is not as true today, as most of the Jewish residents are 
Bukharians from Uzbekistan.[citation needed] The southern part of Forest 
Hills contains a particularly diverse mixture of upscale housing, ranging 
from single-family houses, attached townhouses, and both low-rise and high-rise 
apartment buildings. South of the Long Island Rail Road, the Forest Hills 
Gardens area is a private community that features some of the most expensive 
residential properties in Queens County. It was subject to restrictive 
covenants until the 1970s, which contained no explicit economic, social 
or racial restrictions[7] even if "working-class people" were said to be 
excluded by Eric P. Nash in a 2002 New York Times article, in his review 
of A Modern Arcadia.[8] Forest Hills Gardens was named "Best Community" 
in 2007 by Cottage Living Magazine.[9] The adjacent Van Court community 
also contains a number of detached single-family homes. There are also 
attached townhouses near the Westside Tennis Center and detached frame 
houses near Metropolitan Avenue. Finally, there are a number of apartment 
buildings scattered throughout the community. The most notable high-rise 
apartment buildings are The Continental on 108th St, Kennedy House, the 
Pinnacle, Parker Towers, the Windsor and a 17-story luxury condo building 
completed in 2014, the Aston. On the northwestern edge of Forest Hills, 
on 62nd Drive and 108th Street, immediately adjacent to the Long Island 
Expressway is a NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority) low-income housing 
project that provoked controversy[10] among the residents in the more prestigious 
areas of Forest Hills when it was constructed in the early 1970s. The north 
side of Forest Hills is home to the Cord Meyer community, which contains 
detached single-family homes. Teardowns and their replacement with larger 
single family residences has had a significant impact on the architectural 
integrity of the area.[11] However, the Bukharian Jewish community, whose 
members have settled in the area in large numbers since the late 1990s, 
advocating the changes say the bigger homes are needed for their large 
extended families.[12] Forest Hills was once the home of the U.S. Open 
tennis tournament. The event was held at the West Side Tennis Club before 
it moved to the USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows Park, about 
4 miles (6.4 km) away. When the Open was played at the tennis stadium, 
the tournament was commonly referred to merely as Forest Hills, just as 
All-England Lawn Tennis Association Championships are referred to simply 
as Wimbledon. In the 2001 motion picture, The Royal Tenenbaums, Luke Wilson's 
character plays a tennis match at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills. 
A pivotal scene in Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 film Strangers on a Train, in 
which the main character (played by Farley Granger) is a professional tennis 
player, features a lengthy championship game at the Club, with distinctive 
shots of the surrounding community.[citation needed] The Tennis Stadium, 
which hosted numerous music concerts including The Beatles after the U.S. 
Open departed for Flushing Meadows, resumed hosting music concerts during 
the summer of 2013 when the British rock band Mumford & Sons played there 
to an overflowing crowd. Stadium officials have said they will now host 
as many as six music or cultural events at the Stadium each season. Two 
monuments are erected in Forest Hills Gardens: a tribute to the victims 
of World War I, the "Great War"; and the mast of the Columbia, the winner 
of the America's Cup yacht races in both 1899 and 1901.[citation needed] 
The Church-in-the-Gardens, St. Luke's Episcopal Church, and United States 
Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[13] 
Forest Hills is served by the New York City Department of Education. Pupils 
attend several public different elementary Schools, including: Junior high 
students in Forest Hills attend either J.H.S. 157 Stephen A. Halsey (commonly 
referred to as Halsey) in Rego Park or J.H.S. 190 Russell Sage (known as 
Sage) in Forest Hills as well as the newest school from grade 6 to 12, 
M.S. 167 (otherwise known as Metropolitan Expeditionary Learning School 
(MELS)), "a school for a sustainable city". This school does partnership 
with New York City Outward Bound. New York City high school students at 
the turn of the 21st century began applying to the high schools of their 
choice, as there is no longer a zoning policy for Forest Hills High School 
or Queens Metropolitan High School. Students from all over New York City 
may apply to high schools in other parts of the city. In addition to Forest 
Hills High School, a large percentage of students from both J.H.S. 157 
and J.H.S. 190 gain admission to other high schools in New York City. Many 
J.H.S. 157 students also attend the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn 
Technical High School.[14] Traditionally many more students from J.H.S. 
190 choose to study at Stuyvesant High School and Townsend Harris High 
School, in addition to the Bronx High School of Science.[15] Numerous students 
from Forest Hills also choose to attend middle and high school at the Baccalaureate 
School for Global Education, a public school in Astoria, which teaches 
grades 7 through 12 and follows the International Baccalaureate curriculum. 
Many of the students from outside the district accepted to attend Forest 
Hills High School are those who applied to either the school's Law & Humanities 
program, or the Carl Sagan program in accelerated math and science. FHHS 
began admitting students by audition to their Academy of Instructional 
Music and Performing Arts in 2005.[16] Notable graduates of Forest Hills 
High School include Jacob Lew, current US Secretary of the Treasury; Dennis 
Tito, the first outer space tourist; as well as many show-business stars, 
including musicians Burt Bacharach, Simon & Garfunkel, and The Ramones. 
Private schools in Forest Hills include two Catholic schools, Our Lady 
of Mercy and Our Lady Queen of Martyrs, and The Kew-Forest School, an independent 
school.[citation needed] Bramson ORT College is an undergraduate college 
operated by the American branch of the Jewish charity World ORT. Its main 
campus is in Forest Hills, with a satellite campus in Brooklyn. Touro College/NYSCAS 
has a branch location in Forest Hills. The Forest Hills Library and the 
North Forest Park Library, operated by Queens Library, are in Forest Hills.[17][18] 
The main thoroughfare is Queens Boulevard; the street's width and complexity 
have led to a large number of pedestrian deaths, earning it the moniker 
"Boulevard of Death".[19] Metropolitan Avenue is known for its antique 
shops. The commercial heart of Forest Hills is a mile-long stretch of Austin 
Street between Yellowstone Boulevard and Ascan Avenue: the latter thoroughfare 
was named in 1909 by developer Frederick Backus for his own father, Ascan 
Backus, II.[20] Forest Hills – 71st Avenue, an express subway station at 
the intersection of Continental Avenue and Queens Boulevard, serves the 
E F M R trains. The local 75th Avenue stop (E F trains) is also in the 
area, and some entrance/exits of the express Kew Gardens – Union Turnpike 
station (E F trains) service the southeastern portion of Forest Hills. 
In northwest Forest Hills is the local 67th Avenue station, serving the 
E M R trains. The neighborhood also has two commuter train stations, the 
Forest Hills and Kew Gardens railway stations of the Long Island Rail Road. 
Several MTA Bus-branded buses, including the Q23, Q60, Q64 local buses 
and QM4, QM11, QM12, QM18, serve the area.[21] Forest Hills is bordered 
by two of the more sizable parks in Queens managed by the New York City 
Department of Parks and Recreation: the 1,255 acres (5.08 km2) Flushing 
Meadows–Corona Park, which is the site of two World's Fairs (in 1939 and 
1964) and the iconic Unisphere;[22] as well as the 544 acres (2.20 km2) 
Forest Park.[23] Within Forest Hills, parks and playgrounds include the 
Yellowstone Municipal Park – Katzman Playground (located on Yellowstone 
Boulevard, between 68th Avenue and 68th Road);[24] the Annadale Playground 
(located on Yellowstone Boulevard, between 64th Road and 65th Avenue);[25] 
the Willow Lake Playground (located off the Grand Central Parkway, between 
71st and 72nd Avenues);[26] the Ehrenreich-Austin Playground (located on 
Austin Street, between 76th Avenue and 76th Drive);[27] and the Russell 
Sage Playground (located on 68th Avenue, between Booth and Austin Streets).[28] 
Forest Hills was featured as the home setting for fictional comic book 
character Spider-Man.[29][30] Loubet Street, in southern Forest Hills,
