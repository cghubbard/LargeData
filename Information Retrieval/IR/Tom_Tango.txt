Tom Tango and "TangoTiger" are aliases used online by a baseball sabermetrics 
and ice hockey statistics analyst. He runs the Tango on Baseball sabermetrics 
website and is also a contributor to ESPN's baseball blog TMI (The Max

many advanced baseball questions, like how to optimize a lineup or when 
to issue an intentional base on balls. They also introduced the wOBA metric
