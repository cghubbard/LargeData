"Go Cubs Go", "Go, Cubs, Go" or "Go, Cubs, Go!" is a song written by Steve 
Goodman in 1984.[1] At various times the Goodman version of the song has 
been the official Chicago Cubs team song and the official Cubs victory 
song.[2] The Goodman version of the song is now referred to as the official 
Chicago Cubs victory song.[3][4] The Goodman version has been included 
in both a 1994 Steve Goodman anthology album and a 2008 Cubs songs and 
sounds album. Following the team's 2016 World Series victory, the song 
peaked at number 3 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. 
An alternate 2008 version by Manic Sewing Circle has also been released.[5] 
Goodman was a lifelong Cubs fan.[6] The song was written by Goodman at 
the request of WGN/720,[7] which was the Cubs' radio broadcast partner.[6] 
Goodman had in 1981 recorded "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request", a song about 
the historic failures of the Cubs franchise, but had been banned from playing 
it at Wrigley Field.[2] That song described the team as "doormat of the 
National League" and referred to Wrigley Field as an "ivy-covered burial 
ground."[1] At the time that WGN Program Director Dan Fabian requested 
the new song, "It's a Beautiful Day for a Ball Game" by The Harry Simeone 
Songsters was the theme song. He had been motivated by Cubs manager Dallas 
Green's effort to change the team spirit. Goodman happened to be in town 
for a WGN radio talk show and was receptive to the idea of writing the 
team a new song.[3] "Go, Cubs, Go," recorded at the Chicago Recording Company 
with several of the team members participating in the chorus, first became 
popular during 1984 when the Cubs won the 1984 National League East Division 
Championship and subsequently lost in the 1984 National League Championship 
Series. That season (and for several afterwards) it was the official team 
song.[2] It was first aired on WGN on Opening Day and played every gameday 
for the rest of the season.[3] During that season, Goodman lost his sixteen-year 
battle with leukemia four days before the Cubs clinched the division title.[1][2] 
In the next three years, 60,000 copies of the song were sold with proceeds 
going to charity.[7] Some 1984 Cubs players can be heard performing the 
refrain.[7] In 1987, the song gave way to The Beach Boys' "Here Come the 
Cubs".[1] Later team songs included songs such as Kool & the Gang's "Celebration" 
and KC and the Sunshine Band's "Get Down Tonight".[1][6] The song was eventually 
included on Goodman's album No Big Surprise: Anthology, which was released 
on September 15, 1994.[8] The song has had a resurgence in tandem with 
the success of the 2007 and 2008 Chicago Cubs, who won consecutive National 
League Central Division regular season championships,[9] and the May 2007 
release of the biography of Steve Goodman, Steve Goodman: Facing the Music 
(ISBN 1-55022-732-7).[10][11] In recent years, broadcasts on WGN-TV and 
CSN Chicago have begun delaying postgame commentary to enable viewers to 
hear Goodman's song and to watch fans at Wrigley listening and singing 
along.[1] Cubs management decided to incorporate the song into the stadium 
experience following the team's annual winter conference (not to be confused 
with baseball's winter meetings) in which attendees dropped everything 
they were doing to sing along.[7] More recently, in the 2012 season, Chicago 
band The Fold used the lyric "Go Cubs Go" in their winning track for WGN 
Radio's 2012 Season, "Let's Go Cubbies". In the first week of October 2007, 
it was the most popular folk music digital download on iTunes.[1] With 
the Cubs in playoff contention for the first time in three years, the Cubs' 
victory tune, Go Cubs Go! became more popular among the fans. Due to the 
song's growing popularity, after wins at home, Cubs TV broadcasters Len 
Kasper and Bob Brenly would have their microphones shut off, while the 
camera pans around the stadium to view the jubilant fans singing Go Cubs 
Go! playing in the background. During that season, it was known as the 
unofficial Chicago Cubs victory song and it was played at Wrigley Field 
after each Cubs victory.[1][2] There were 44 such victories during the 
2007 regular season.[1] On October 5, 2007, Illinois Lieutenant Governor 
Pat Quinn declared the day "Steve Goodman Day" throughout the state.[2] 
On August 1, 2008, WGN Radio and Vibes Media released a ringtone version 
of the song for purchase by text message for a cost of US$2.99. At that 
time it was described as the official Cubs victory song.[3] Also in 2008, 
the song was included on the album Take Me Out To A Cubs Game which was 
subtitled "Music For The Cubs Fan". The album is a 17-song album with a 
total run time of 55 minutes and 35 seconds that includes the September 
21, 1997 Harry Caray performance of "Take Me Out to the Ball Game", which 
was his last. The album was produced in celebration of the 100th anniversary 
of the Cubs 1908 World Series victory and contains sounds and songs of 
the Cubs and Wrigley Field.[12][13] The album is an officially licensed 
Major League Baseball music CD.[13] Neither of Goodman's other notable 
songs about the Cubs ("A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request" or "When the Cubs 
Go Marching In") was included on the album. Also in 2008, the song was 
released by Manic Sewing Circle. It was performed for the first time live 
on WGN-TV at the Skybox on Sheffield, located directly across from Wrigley 
Field on opening day 2008.[14] Their cover version of the song was released 
with proceeds going to official charities of the Chicago Cubs and WGN radio: 
Cubs Care and Neediest Kids Fund.[15] The Manic Sewing Circle version of 
the song is also available on iTunes by digital download,[13] and they 
publicized this version throughout Chicago.[5] Although the original Goodman 
version of the song is 2:51, the new Manic Sewing Circle version is only 
2:23 long. In September 2008, prompted by the Cubs' 2008 season and a piece 
by Mike Leonard on the NBC Today Show about Steve Goodman, Red Pajamas 
Records issued a 4-cut EP titled The Baseball Singles with Goodman's performances 
of "Go Cubs Go", "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request", "When The Cubs Go Marching 
In", and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".[16] The song surged in sales on 
U.S. digital download services,[17] including the top five on Amazon Music 
and the top 15 on iTunes,[18] following the team's 2016 World Series victory. 
"Go, Cubs, Go" debuted at number 22 on Spotify's Viral 50[19] and debuted 
at number 3 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.[20] The 
cast of the musical Hamilton in Chicago sang a rendition of the song on 
November 3, 2016.[21] During the team's victory rally at Grant Park on 
November 4, 2016, country singer Brett Eldredge sang his own rendition 
of the song.[22] The following day, Cubs players Anthony Rizzo, Dexter 
Fowler, and David Ross appeared on Saturday Night Live to perform the song 
during the show's weekly Weekend Update segment, together with actor Bill 
Murray, an avid Cubs supporter.[23] Several of the Cubs' minor league affiliates 
also use the song, including the Tennessee Smokies.[24] The Daytona Cubs 
also used the song before changing affiliations.[25] The song is perceived 
as an upbeat one that leaves listeners with a happy feeling.[26] It is 
described as having catchy riffs and exuberant vocals that characterized 
the essence of Cubs fandom while, noting in the lyrics, "You can catch 
it all on WGN."[3] (That particular lyric is now partially out of date, 
as WGN radio, which had carried Cubs games in some form or another since 
1925, gave up the radio rights to the Cubs in 2015 to CBS Radio.[27] WGN-TV 
still carries a portion of the Cubs game telecasts.) The new Manic Sewing 
Circle cover is a ska-punk version instead of the original folk music.[5]
