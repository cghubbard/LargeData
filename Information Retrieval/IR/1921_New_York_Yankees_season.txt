The 1921 New York Yankees season was the 19th season for the Yankees in 
New York and their 21st overall. The team finished with a record of 98–55, 
winning their first pennant in franchise history, winning the American 
League by 4½ games over the previous year's champion, the Cleveland Indians. 
New York was managed by Miller Huggins. Their home games were played at 
the Polo Grounds. With star slugger Babe Ruth hitting 59 home runs, setting 
a new major league home run record for the third consecutive year, while 
also having his greatest overall season statistically, the Yankees appeared 
to be the team to beat in the World Series. Their landlords, the New York 
Giants, had rebuilt after slipping a bit in the late 1910s, and had won 
the National League pennant. For the first time, all the games of a World 
Series would be held in the same ballpark. The best-5-of-9 Series (its 
last before returning to the best-4-of-7 format) saw the Yankees take a 
2 games to 0 lead and later a 3–2 series lead, but Ruth suffered a serious 
injury in game 3 that limited his appearances in the remaining games, save 
for one pinch-hit appearance, and the Giants rallied to win the Series 
5 games to 3. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Coaches Note:
