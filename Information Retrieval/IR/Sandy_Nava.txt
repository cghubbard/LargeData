Vincent Irwin "Sandy" Nava (April 12, 1850 – June 15, 1906) was an American 
19th century Major League Baseball player for five seasons from 1882 through 
1886.[1] Nava was the first known Mexican American and second Hispanic 
baseball player to play in the Majors, behind Steve Bellán.[2] Born as 
Vincent Irwin in San Francisco, California, Sandy made his Major League 
debut for the 1882 Providence Grays as a catcher.[1] He was brought in 
to be fellow San Francisco native Charlie Sweeney's catcher.[3] Nava's 
history in professional baseball showed two sides; when he was growing 
up in San Francisco, he apparently tried to hide his Mexican heritage and 
went by names like Irwin Sandy or Vincent Irwin, but when he came to the 
East Coast, he returned to his name of Nava and the Providence team tried 
to promote his "Spanish" heritage.[2] He played in 28 games his rookie 
season, and batted .206, while scoring 15 runs. He returned to the Grays 
for two more seasons, continuing to be the back-up catcher to Barney Gilligan, 
having his best year in 1883 when he batted .240 and scored 18 runs in 
29 games.[1] Even though he didn't hit well, he stayed on as Sweeney's 
personal catcher, until Sweeney was expelled from the team by refusing 
to leave a game in favor of Cyclone Miller. The team decided to leave Nava 
and Miller behind on a road trip and later loaned them to a military team 
in Fort Monroe, Virginia.[3] For the 1884 and 1885 seasons, Nava played 
for the Baltimore Orioles of the American Association, and played in just 
10 games in those two years before leaving the Majors.[1] Nava was of Mexican 
descent, however, he was identified as Black, Indian, Portuguese, Spanish, 
and Cuban throughout his baseball career. In the 1900 United States Census,[4] 
he was enumerated at 363 Davis Street in Baltimore, Maryland. He was listed 
as Vincent Nava, white and single, born April 1851, and working as an upholsterer, 
in a neighborhood with a large black population. Nava died in Baltimore 
at the age of 55, and is interred at Trinity Cemetery in Baltimore, a segregated
