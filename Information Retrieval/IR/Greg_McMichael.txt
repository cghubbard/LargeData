Gregory Winston McMichael (born December 1, 1966) is a former professional 
baseball player who pitched in relief in the Major Leagues from 1993 to 
2000.[1] Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, McMichael graduated from Webb School 
of Knoxville in 1985 and played college ball at the University of Tennessee 
before joining Major League Baseball.[2][3] He was drafted by the Cleveland 
Indians in June 1988 and played for that team's minor league affiliates 
during the 1988, 1989, and 1990 seasons.[4] The Indians released him in 
April 1991, whereupon he signed with the Atlanta Braves organization.[1] 
He played two seasons for Braves minor league teams before being called 
up to the major leagues for the 1993 season.[4] In 1993, his first season 
with the Atlanta Braves, he became a closer at mid-season and went on to 
compile a record of 19 saves, with an earned-run average of 2.06. After 
that season, when the Braves won the National League West division title, 
he placed second in balloting for National League Rookie of the Year, a 
title that was won by Mike Piazza.[3] McMichael played for the Braves through 
the 1996 season, including pitching in the World Series in both 1995 (when 
the Braves won) and 1996. However, he was traded to the New York Mets for 
the 1997 season. His career with the Mets was interrupted in 1998 when 
he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he returned to the Mets about 
one month later in a subsequent trade. He started the 1999 season as a 
member of the Mets organization,[3] but was placed on the disabled list 
during spring training due to tendinitis in his shoulder, then spent the 
some time in the minor leagues before returning to the Mets roster.[5] 
Later in the 1999 season he went to the Oakland Athletics in a trade.[3] 
After that season he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder and 
was released from his contract, making him a free agent.[1][6] He rejoined 
the Braves in 2000, playing in 16 games before incurring a rotator cuff
