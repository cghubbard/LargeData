As player As coach As manager Takehiko Bessho (別所 毅彦 Bessho Takehiko, October 
1, 1922 -June 24, 1999), born Akira Bessho (別所昭, Bessho Akira), was a Japanese 
baseball player whose professional career as a player lasted from 1942 
until 1960.[1] Bessho first achieved fame as a pitcher in Japanese professional 
baseball; later, he served as a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) manager. 
Bessho spent his first five seasons in the Japanese Baseball League (the 
predecessor of NPB) with the Nankai franchise (1942–43, 1946–48) and his 
final 12 seasons with the Yomiuri Giants (1949–1960).[2] He quickly established 
himself as a top pitcher and went on to earn two Sawamura Awards, the Japanese 
equivalent of the Cy Young Award, and six Best Nine Awards. In 1947, Bessho 
set the NPB record for most complete games in a single season (47).[3] 
In addition, Bessho earned the NPB Most Valuable Player Award in 1952 and 
1956.[1] Bessho retired after the 1960 season with 310 wins, a 2.18 earned 
run average, and 1,932 strikeouts. After he retired from the sport as a 
player and a manager, Bessho became a sports broadcaster.[1] In recognition 
of his accomplishments, the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame elected Bessho 
in 1979.[1] Raised solely by his mother, Besho grew up in a in Kobe, Hyōgo, 
Japan[4] and went by the name Akira Bessho. Bessho started his athletic 
career by playing nanshiki (rubber baseball) while he was in the fifth 
grade in elementary school.[4] By the time he started his high school career 
at Takikawa Junior High School, Bessho had transitioned from nanshiki to 
baseball. In 1940 and 1941, Bessho appeared in the Koshien tournament. 
During the 1941 spring edition, he pitched all fourteen innings of a game 
despite his broken arm; unfortunately, he also lost the decision.[4] After 
his graduation, Bessho took the entrance exam for Keio University but ultimately 
enrolled in vocational classes at Nihon University.[4] In 1942, Besho joined 
the Nankai franchise, an Osaka-based team in the Japanese Baseball League 
(JBL). Bessho quickly established himself as a quality player, both as 
a pitcher and a hitter. In fact, he was so good at batting that the manager 
had him play in the field (either at first base or the outfield) when he 
didn't pitch. On May 26, 1943, Bessho pitched a no-hitter against the Yamato 
team.[4] In December of that year, the Japanese army conscripted Bessho 
and sent him to Manchuria because of World War II. However, in 1944, Bessho 
moved to the officer's school in Matsudo, Chiba before the army finally 
moved him to the Kōchi Prefecture.[4] After the war had ended, Bessho rejoined 
Nankai in 1946. In 1947 he won and completed 47 games, still a Nippon Pro 
Baseball record, of which he was proud for many years. In the late part 
of 1948 he moved to the Yomiuri Giants. This became a big scandal in Japanese 
sports journalism, known as the Bessho head-hunting Incident (ja: 別所引き抜き事件) 
which led the league to put sanctions on him which prohibit him playing 
for two months. For the Yomiuri Giants, he was still a star. In 1956, the 
Los Angeles Dodgers, a Major League Baseball franchise, decided to play 
a series of games in Japan. On October 23, 1956, the Dodgers faced the 
Yomiuri Giants at Maruyama Stadium in Sapporo. Carl Erskine started for 
the Dodgers, and Sho Horiuchi started for the Giants. In the seventh inning, 
Bessho replaced Horiuchi and pitched the rest of the game. Unfortunately, 
Bessho surrendered a solo-home run to Duke Snider in the top of the ninth 
inning; it was the only run of the game.[5] In 1960 he was a player and 
pitching coach for the Yomiuri Giants. At the end of season he retired 
and remained on the team as coach. His 310 victories were the NPB all-time 
record when he retired. During his career, Bessho won six Best Nine Awards, 
more than any other pitcher in history.[3] In addition, he won two MVP 
awards, led the league in strikeouts from 1950 until 1952, and won 20 or 
more games eight different seasons. He led the NPB in ivcotires three times 
and in ERA, strikeouts, and winning percentage once each.[3] With 72 career 
shutouts, he ranks fourth all-time in Japanese professional baseball.[6] 
From 1964 till 1966 he was the pitching coach of the Taiyō Whales. He managed 
the Sankei Atoms from 1968 until mid-1970. From then he give commentaries 
at Fuji TV, Bunka Hōsō and Nikkan Sports. As a commentator, he was known 
for his cheerful loud laughter, grayed hair, and apparent but innocent 
favoritism toward the Yomiuri Giants (he often couldn't remember the names 
of non-Giants players). In 1979 he was nominated to Japanese Baseball Hall 
of Fame. In 1992 he surmounted to the presidency of the Yomiuri Giants 
Old Boy Club, succeeding Tetsuharu Kawakami. In 1999, he died at his home
