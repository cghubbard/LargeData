George Bevan "Bo" Strickland (January 10, 1926 – February 21, 2010) was 
an American professional baseball player and manager who spent ten seasons 
from 1950 to 1960 as an infielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Indians. He served as the Indians' interim 
manager twice in the 1960s.[1] He was also a cousin of Hal Bevan.[2] Strickland 
was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on January 10, 1926.[3] He was a star 
shortstop at the city's S.J. Peters High School,[4] where one of his teammates 
was Mel Parnell.[1] Strickland also played for the Southwest Sectional 
champions representing his hometown at the American Legion Baseball World 
Series in Miles City, Montana in 1943.[3][5] Immediately after the tournament, 
he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm team at 
the time, and made his professional debut on September 5, 1943. He appeared 
in only three games that season, all as a third baseman, and collected 
two singles in eight at bats.[3][6] Strickland's baseball career was interrupted 
when he was drafted into the United States Navy in March 1944. He was stationed 
as a Specialist Mailman for 16 months in Saipan after American forces had 
captured the island from the Imperial Japanese Army in July of the same 
year. He was given his honorable discharge in May 1946.[3] He returned 
to the Pelicans, which had become a Boston Red Sox affiliate prior to the 
1946 campaign, and played the latter half of the schedule at third base. 
After spending a little more than a season with the Scranton Red Sox, he 
was assigned to the Louisville Colonels in 1948, becoming a full-time shortstop. 
His best year in the minors was in 1949 when he batted .261 in 128 games 
with the Birmingham Barons.[6] Strickland was selected by Pittsburgh in 
the Rule 5 draft on November 17, 1949.[2] He made his Major League debut 
on May 7, 1950 in a 3–2 loss to the Dodgers at Forbes Field.[7] During 
his three years with the team, the Pirates were relegated to the bottom 
two positions in the National League standings.[8] His only season as its 
starting shortstop was 1951 when he batted .216 in 138 contests and committed 
a major-league-high 37 errors.[9][10] He was traded with Ted Wilks to the 
Indians for John Beradino, Charlie Ripple and $50,000 on August 18, 1952.[2] 
Upon his arrival in Cleveland, Strickland supplanted Ray Boone to become 
the starting shortstop through 1955.[11] Strickland's first full season 
with the team in 1953 was also his best at the plate as he hit .284 in 
123 matches.[2] His .976 fielding percentage in 1955 led all regular shortstops 
in the majors during that campaign.[10] In his eight years with the ballclub, 
the Indians finished no lower than second place in the American League 
(AL) five times.[12] He was a key member of the 1954 AL Champions who ended 
the New York Yankees' run of five straight pennants and whose 111 regular-season 
victories established a junior circuit record that lasted until the Yankees 
won 114 games in 1998, a mark surpassed when the Seattle Mariners won 116 
in 2001.[4][13] The World Series that year, in which the Indians were swept 
in four games by the New York Giants, was Strickland's only postseason 
experience. He went hitless in nine at-bats in the first three contests.[14] 
In the top half of the opening inning of the 6–2 defeat in Game 3 at Cleveland 
Stadium, he committed a throwing error attempting to complete a double 
play, leading to the Giants' first run of the match.[15] He was replaced 
by Sam Dente in the series-ending 7–4 loss in Game 4.[16] Cleveland's acquisition 
of Chico Carrasquel after the 1955 season reduced Strickland's role to 
utility infielder.[17] After stepping away from the sport for a year, he 
returned to the Indians in 1959 and made 122 starts, 72 at third base.[2] 
His final game as a player was the Indians' 4–2 triumph over the Red Sox 
at Fenway Park on July 23, 1960. He entered the contest with one out in 
the Boston eighth as a substitute at third base for Bubba Phillips, who 
was sent to left field to replace Jimmy Piersall, who had been ejected 
for arguing with home plate umpire Ed Hurley over his distraction of batter 
Ted Williams.[18] Strickland's playing career ended when he was released 
on August 3.[2] Strickland worked as a scout for the Indians in 1961.[3] 
He spent the following year on Sam Mele's coaching staff with a Minnesota 
Twins team that finished in second place, five games behind the eventual 
World Series Champion Yankees.[19] He returned to Cleveland to serve as 
third-base coach under three managers (Birdie Tebbetts, Joe Adcock and 
Alvin Dark) from 1963 to 1969.[1][12] He became the Indians' interim manager 
at the beginning of the 1964 campaign when Tebbetts suffered a heart attack 
near the end of spring training on April 1.[20] Strickland's managerial 
debut was a 7–6 loss at home to the Twins in the season opener on April 
14. The ballclub made it to the top of the AL standings by the end of the 
month and would spend thirteen days in that position, the latest being 
on May 16. His stint ended with the team on a six-game losing streak, culminating 
in a 9–1 defeat on the road to the Detroit Tigers on July 2. The Indians 
were in eighth place with a 33–39 record and thirteen games behind the 
league-leading Baltimore Orioles by the time Tebbetts returned to the club 
the next day.[21] Strickland was called upon to lead the ballclub on an 
interim basis again after Tebbetts was dismissed on August 19, 1966, with 
the 66–57 team in third place and trailing the eventual World Series Champion 
Orioles by fourteen games.[20] Going 15–24 under Strickland, the Indians 
ended the campaign in fifth place at 81–81, seventeen games off the pace. 
The final contest he managed was a 2–0 loss to the California Angels in 
the season finale at Anaheim Stadium on October 2. His career record as 
a Major League manager was 48–63 (.432).[22] When Strickland joined the 
Kansas City Royals coaching staff in 1970,[23] he was reunited with former 
Indians teammate Bob Lemon, who would be promoted to manager in early June.[24] 
The most successful of the three years he spent in Kansas City was 1971 
when the Royals vaulted into second place in the AL Western Division with 
an 85–76 record in only the franchise's third season of existence.[25] 
Strickland retired from baseball in 1972 after a fourth-place finish with 
a 76–78 mark cost Lemon his job.[3] Strickland was once the parimutuels 
manager at Fair Grounds Race Course.[26] He was inducted into the Greater 
New Orleans Sports Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Louisiana Sports Hall of 
Fame in 2006.[1] Strickland was interviewed for the book "Portrait of a 
Franchise: An Intimate Look at Cleveland Indians Baseball During the Rockin' 
Sixties" by Doug Kurkul. He died at age 84 in New Orleans on February 21,
