As Player As Manager Gordon William Hunter (born June 4, 1928) is a retired 
American shortstop, coach and manager in Major League Baseball. A slick-fielding, 
light-hitting shortstop from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, the right-handed-batting 
Hunter was originally signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. With his path to 
the Majors blocked by Pee Wee Reese, he was sold to the St. Louis Browns 
of the American League on October 14, 1952, for $150,000 after leading 
the Texas League in fielding and stolen bases. Hunter was the starting 
shortstop for the last Browns club in 1953 and the first modern MLB Orioles 
team when the Brownies transferred to Baltimore in 1954. For the remainder 
of his career, however, he was a second-string infielder for the New York 
Yankees, Kansas City Athletics and Cleveland Indians. Hunter batted .219 
in 630 games over his six-year (1953–58) AL career. When Hunter's playing 
career ended, he scouted for the Indians, managed in the Baltimore farm 
system and was appointed on November 20, 1963 as the Orioles' third-base 
coach by former Yankees teammate Hank Bauer who had become the team's manager 
one day earlier.[1] He performed that role for almost 14 seasons for four 
AL champions and two World Series winners. In late 1971, Hunter declined 
a chance to become manager of the California Angels.[2] Hunter left the 
Orioles on June 28, 1977, to take the helm of the Texas Rangers — the club's 
fourth skipper of the 1977 season (including Eddie Stanky, who signed to 
succeed Frank Lucchesi but returned to retirement after one game, and Connie 
Ryan, who managed six games in the interim between Stanky and Hunter).[3] 
Under Hunter, the Rangers won 60 of their final 93 games and climbed from 
fourth to second place in the American League West Division. Hopes were 
high for 1978, but the Rangers finished tied for second, five games behind 
the division-leading Kansas City Royals. During the season, Hunter had 
a confrontation with pitcher Dock Ellis on a team bus. Ellis was later 
quoted saying Hunter "may be Hitler, but he ain't making no lampshade out 
of me."[4] After turning down a five-year contract extension in midseason,[5] 
offered by Rangers' young owner, Brad Corbett, Hunter was fired with one 
day left in the campaign due to his poor relationship with his team. When 
asked if he was sorry he took the manager's job, Hunter replied "yes."[6] 
Hunter's record over his one-and-a-half seasons was 146–108 (.575), but 
he never returned to the Major Leagues as a coach or manager though he 
claimed to have received a half dozen job offers in the winter of 1978.[7] 
He became head baseball coach and athletic director at Maryland's Towson 
State University, retiring in 1995. He was a 1996 honoree into the Orioles 
Hall of Fame, inducted with Jerry Hoffberger and Cal Ripken, Sr. These 
three men were so well thought of in Baltimore that a crowd of 400 showed 
up at the luncheon at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel.[8] Pound sign (#)
