Kevan Alan Smith (born June 28, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
catcher for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior 
to playing professionally, he attended the University of Pittsburgh, where 
he played for the Pittsburgh Panthers baseball and football teams. Smith 
attended Seneca Valley High School in Harmony, Pennsylvania, graduating 
in 2006.[1] During his high school career, he played for the school's American 
football team as a quarterback, but was limited to only 12 games.[2] Smith 
enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh and played for the Pittsburgh 
Panthers football team. He redshirted during his first year at Pittsburgh, 
in 2006,[3] and became the Panthers' starting quarterback in 2007 following 
an injury to Bill Stull.[2] He lost his starting role to Pat Bostick, a 
true freshman, after struggling in a 2007 game against the Michigan State 
Spartans.[3] He appeared in five games during the 2007 season, and one 
game during the 2008 season.[4] After the 2008 season, coach Dave Wannstedt 
and offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh approached Smith about changing 
positions.[4] As Smith had increased his weight training, they considered 
moving him to outside linebacker or tight end.[5] He instead opted to quit 
football so that he could play for the Pittsburgh Panthers baseball team.[4] 
For the baseball team, Smith had a .375 batting average, 19 home runs and 
123 runs batted in (RBIs) in his three seasons.[5] He was twice named an 
All-Big East Conference selection and twice named to the All-Tournament 
Team in the Big East Conference Baseball Tournament.[6] The Chicago White 
Sox selected Smith in the seventh round of the 2011 MLB Draft.[7] He began 
his career with the Bristol White Sox of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. 
He was promoted mid season to the Great Falls Voyagers of the Rookie-level 
Pioneer League. He began the 2012 season with the Kannapolis Intimidators 
of the Class A South Atlantic League. Towards the end of the season, Smith 
was promoted to the Winston Salem Dash of the Class A-Advanced Carolina 
League. In 2013, Smith played the whole season for Winston-Salem.[5] In 
2014, Smith played for the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League.[8][9] 
He hit .290 with 10 home runs and 48 RBIs in 106 games for Birmingham, 
and threw out 33 percent of baserunners attempting stolen bases.[10] After 
the 2014 season, the White Sox assigned Smith to the Glendale Desert Dogs 
of the Arizona Fall League.[11][12] On November 20, 2014, the White Sox 
added Smith to their 40-man roster.[10] Smith spent the 2015 season with 
the Charlotte Knights of the Class AAA International League,[13] and began 
2016 in Charlotte.[14] With Alex Avila going on the disabled list, the 
White Sox promoted Smith to the major leagues on April 24, 2016.[14] Smith 
was scratched from the lineup on April 25 with back spasms, and the White 
Sox put Smith on the disabled list due to sacroiliac joint dysfunction
