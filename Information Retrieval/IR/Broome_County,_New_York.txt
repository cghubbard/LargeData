Broome County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2010 
census, the population was 200,600.[1] Its county seat and largest city 
is Binghamton. The county was named in honor of John Broome, who was lieutenant 
governor in 1806 when Broome County was established. Broome County is part 
of the Binghamton, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current county 
executive is Debra A. Preston. Broome County is also home to Binghamton 
University, one of four university centers in the SUNY system. When counties 
were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Broome 
County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous county, including 
the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State 
of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This 
county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of Cumberland 
County, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of Gloucester County, 
both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left 
of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name 
Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western 
portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically 
still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County 
was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and 
the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the 
area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated 
as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county 
was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York. In the years 
prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 
1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary 
War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in honor 
of the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in 
Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the 
name of the hated British governor. In 1789, Montgomery County was reduced 
in size by the splitting off of Ontario County. The actual area split off 
from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including 
the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, 
Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler 
and Wayne Counties. In 1791, Tioga County split off from Montgomery County, 
along with Herkimer and Otsego Counties. Tioga County was at this time 
much larger than the present county and included the present Broome and 
Chemung Counties and parts of Chenango and Schuyler Counties. In 1798, 
Tioga County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Chemung County 
(which also included part of the present Schuyler County) and by the combination 
of a portion with a portion of Herkimer County to create Chenango County. 
In 1806, the present-day Broome County was split off from Tioga County. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 716 
square miles (1,850 km2), of which 706 square miles (1,830 km2) is land 
and 9.7 square miles (25 km2) (1.4%) is water.[2] Broome County is located 
in south-central New York, directly north of the border with Pennsylvania 
in a section of the state called the Southern Tier. The Chenango River 
joins the Susquehanna River, which flows through the county. The western 
half of the county is hilly but has wide valleys that accommodate Binghamton 
and its suburbs. In the northern portion Interstate 81 takes advantage 
of another glacial valley. To the east, however, the terrain becomes much 
more rugged as the land tilts up to the Catskills. The highest elevation 
is a U.S. National Geodetic Survey benchmark known as Slawson atop an unnamed 
hill in the Town of Sanford. It is approximately 2087 feet[3] (636 m) above 
sea level. An area due east on the Delaware County line in Oquaga Creek 
State Park also lies within the same elevation contour line. The lowest 
point is 864 feet (263 m) above sea level, along the Susquehanna at the 
Pennsylvania state line. As of the census[9] of 2000, there were 200,536 
people, 80,749 households, and 50,225 families residing in the county. 
The population density was 284 people per square mile (110/km²). There 
were 88,817 housing units at an average density of 126 per square mile 
(49/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 91.33% White, 3.28% Black 
or African American, 0.19% Native American, 2.79% Asian, 0.03% Pacific 
Islander, 0.79% from other races, and 1.59% from two or more races. 1.99% 
of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 16.1% were of Irish, 
13.3% Italian, 12.3% German, 11.6% English, 6.4% American and 5.7% Polish 
ancestry according to Census 2000 [2]. 91.4% spoke English, 2.0% Spanish 
and 1.1% Italian as their first language. There were 80,749 households 
out of which 28.20% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 
47.60% were married couples living together, 10.80% had a female householder 
with no husband present, and 37.80% were non-families. 31.00% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 12.40% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.37 and the average 
family size was 2.97. In the county the population was spread out with 
23.00% under the age of 18, 11.00% from 18 to 24, 26.80% from 25 to 44, 
22.80% from 45 to 64, and 16.40% who were 65 years of age or older. The 
median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 93.20 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.90 males. The median 
income for a household in the county was $35,347, and the median income 
for a family was $45,422. Males had a median income of $34,426 versus $24,542 
for females. The per capita income for the county was $19,168. About 8.80% 
of families and 12.80% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
15.90% of those under age 18 and 7.20% of those age 65 or over. Broome 
County's offices are housed in the Edwin L. Crawford County Office Building 
of Government Plaza located at 60 Hawley Street in Downtown Binghamton.

of the legislature are elected from individual districts. Currently, there
