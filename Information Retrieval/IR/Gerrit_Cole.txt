Gerrit Alan Cole (born September 8, 1990) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). He attended 
the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he pitched for 
the UCLA Bruins. Cole made his MLB debut in 2013. Cole played for the baseball 
team at Orange Lutheran High School, and was selected by the New York Yankees 
in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft. Cole opted not to sign and instead 
attended UCLA. After his college baseball career, the Pirates made Cole 
the first overall selection in the 2011 MLB draft. Cole was named the National 
League (NL) Rookie of the Month in September 2013, and the NL Pitcher of 
the Month for April 2015. He stands 6'4" and weighs 230 lbs. Cole attended 
Orange Lutheran High School. In his sophomore year, Cole pitched for the 
school's junior varsity baseball team, allowing no runs in 45 innings pitched. 
He gained national attention while pitching for the varsity team in his 
junior year, as his fastball reached 94 miles per hour (151 km/h).[1] He 
reached 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) in a showcase for the best prep school 
talents, and close to 50 scouts attended the first game of his senior season.[1] 
In his senior year, Cole pitched to an 8–2 win–loss record and a 0.47 earned 
run average (ERA), while also recording 121 strikeouts in 75 innings.[2] 
Cole was named to the USA Today All-USA high school baseball team.[3] Baseball 
America rated him the 17th best prospect available in the 2008 Major League 
Baseball draft. He was named the ESPN Rise Athlete of the Month for three 
consecutive months in March, April, and May 2010.[citation needed] He was 
named the starting pitcher of the 2008 Orange County North–South All-Star 
Game.[4] After his senior year, the New York Yankees selected Cole in the 
first round, with the 28th overall selection, of the 2008 Major League 
Baseball draft, becoming the first player ever drafted out of Orange Lutheran 
High School. The Yankees were reportedly planning on offering Cole a $4 
million signing bonus, which was above the recommended amount for the slot.[3] 
As the Yankees planned to give Cole a large bonus to sign, they waited 
until the deadline to attempt to sign him.[5] By the time the deadline 
approached, Cole had decided to follow through with his commitment to attend 
the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) on a college baseball 
scholarship.[5][6] Despite being represented by Scott Boras, and though 
the Yankees were believed to be ready to offer upwards of $4 million, Cole 
never negotiated with the Yankees, as he was determined to attend college.[7] 
John Savage, coach of the UCLA Bruins, made Cole the team's Friday night 
starting pitcher in his freshman year.[1] That season, Cole recorded a 
4–8 win–loss record with a 3.49 ERA, collecting 104 strikeouts in 85 innings. 
Cole was a member of the 2009 United States collegiate national baseball 
team and was named to the 2010 Collegiate National Team roster.[8][9][10] 
He competed in the 2010 World University Baseball Championship. During 
UCLA's 2010 season, Cole and Trevor Bauer contributed in making the Bruins 
the best baseball team (51–17 record) in school history and the second 
best team in the country. Cole had an 11–4 win–loss record, a 3.37 ERA, 
and 153 strikeouts in 123 innings.[1] His 153 strikeouts placed Cole third 
in among all collegiate pitchers.[11] The Bruins went on to play in the 
2010 College World Series, but were defeated by South Carolina in the NCAA 
Championship Series.[12] Cole's statistics declined in 2011, his junior 
year. He finished the season with a 6–8 win-loss record and a 3.31 ERA, 
with 119 strikeouts in 114 1⁄3 innings.[13][14] Heading into the 2011 MLB 
draft, Cole, Bauer, and Danny Hultzen, also a college pitcher, were seen 
as among the best available talents in the draft.[15] The Pittsburgh Pirates 
selected Cole with the first overall selection. He signed a minor league 
contract with an $8 million signing bonus, the highest signing bonus ever 
offered to a rookie, 15 minutes before the signing deadline on August 15, 
2011.[16][17] Though he signed too late to pitch in the 2011 minor league 
season, he pitched for the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League (AFL). 
He recorded 16 strikeouts in 15 innings pitched for the Solar Sox and had 
a 3.00 earned run average (ERA) and a 0.93 walks plus hits per inning pitched 
ratio (WHIP). He was selected to start the AFL Rising Stars game in November 
2011.[18] The Pirates invited Cole to spring training in 2012 as a non-roster 
invitee, but they optioned him to the minor leagues.[19] Cole started the 
2012 season with the Bradenton Marauders of the Class A-Advanced Florida 
State League, along with fellow starting pitcher Jameson Taillon, the Pirates' 
first selection in the 2010 MLB draft.[20] Cole was named a FSL Mid-Season 
All-Star. He was promoted to the Altoona Curve of the Class AA Eastern 
League on June 15, 2012.[21] He was named to appear in the 2012 All-Star 
Futures Game.[22] In twelve starts with the Curve, Cole pitched to a 2.90 
ERA, before the Pirates promoted him to the Indianapolis Indians of the 
Class AAA International League on August 29, 2012.[23] Prior to the 2013 
season, Cole was ranked as the ninth best prospect in baseball by MLB.com.[24] 
Cole played for the Indianapolis Indians to start the 2013 season. Cole 
pitched to a 5–3 record and a 2.91 ERA in 12 starts for Indianapolis.[25] 
Due to injuries to James McDonald and Wandy Rodríguez, the Pirates promoted 
Cole to the major leagues, to make his MLB debut on June 11, 2013.[25][26] 
During his debut, he struck out the first batter he faced, Gregor Blanco, 
on three pitches; the last one at 99 miles per hour (159 km/h). He also 
recorded his first career hit, a 2-run single with the bases loaded in 
his first career plate appearance. Cole pitched 6⅓ innings being charged 
with two earned runs but got the win as the Pirates won over the San Francisco 
Giants, 8–2. Cole became the fourth pitcher since 1920 to drive in 2+ runs 
and earn the win in his Major League debut. Cole is the first Pirate to 
start his career with wins in his first four starts since Nick Maddox in 
1907.[27] He was the fifth pitcher for any team to accomplish the feat 
in the past 40 years, joining Rich Gale of the 1978 Royals, Kaz Ishii of 
the 2002 Dodgers, Jered Weaver of the 2006 Angels and Scott Lewis of the 
2008 Indians.[28] Cole was voted the National League (NL) Rookie of the 
Month for September 2013. On the month, Cole had a 4–0 record and led all 
rookies with a 1.69 ERA and 39 strikeouts.[29] Cole had a 10–7 record and 
a 3.22 ERA in 19 starts for Pittsburgh in 2013. Cole started Game Two of 
the 2013 National League Division Series, going six innings allowing two 
hits, one earned run, and five strikeouts, and ultimately defeating the 
St. Louis Cardinals.[15] The Pirates chose Cole to start the deciding Game 
5 over A. J. Burnett.[26] The Cardinals won the game, and the series.[30] 
After focusing on his fastball during his rookie season, Cole entered 2014 
spring training working on improving his curveball and slider.[31] Cole 
has been a durable pitcher in 2014 pitching 75 1/3 innings, but manager 
Clint Hurdle acknowledged on June 7 that Cole would miss at least one start 
with shoulder fatigue.[32] Cole was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
the next day,[33] and activated on June 28.[34] On September 7, 2014, Cole 
hit his first career home run at Wrigley Field off of Chicago Cubs pitcher 
Blake Parker.[35] On September 23, Cole helped the Pirates clinch a second 
consecutive playoff berth by beating Alex Wood and the Atlanta Braves.[36] 
Cole won the NL Pitcher of the Month Award for April 2015, after going 
4–0 with a 1.76 ERA and 35 strikeouts in 30 2⁄3 innings pitched for the 
month.[37] He was the Pirates' choice to start the 2015 National League 
Wild Card Game against the Chicago Cubs but took the loss after giving 
up four earned runs on six hits and a walk in five innings pitched.[38] 
On June 14, 2016, Cole was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a 
right triceps strain. On July 27, 2016 Cole pitched his first complete 
game against the Seattle Mariners.[39] Cole is a power pitcher who features 
a four-seam and two-seam fastball that he regularly throws between 94 to 
98 miles per hour (151–158 km/h), but has been clocked as high as 102 miles 
per hour (164 km/h).[40] He also throws a slider and a changeup.[41] Cole 
was born on September 8, 1990, in Newport Beach, California, the older 
of Mark and Sharon Cole's two children. He has one younger sister, Erin.[1] 
Cole grew up as a fan of the New York Yankees, as his father – raised in 
Syracuse, New York – passed down his affinity for the Yankees to his son.[42] 
He admires Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig and retired pitcher Mariano Rivera, 
both Yankees legends. Cole attended the 2001 World Series, of which the 
Yankees took part.[5][6] Cole is engaged to Amy Crawford, the sister of 
San Francisco Giants shortstop Brandon Crawford. They met when they attended
