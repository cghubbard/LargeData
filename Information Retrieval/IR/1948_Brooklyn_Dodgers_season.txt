Leo Durocher returned as manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers to start the 1948 
season but was fired in mid-season. He was replaced first by team coach 
Ray Blades and then by Burt Shotton, who had managed the team to the 1947 
pennant. The Dodgers finished third in the National League after this tumultuous 
season. The 1948 Dodgers were very much a work in progress, beginning to 
coalesce into the classic "Boys of Summer" teams of the 1950s. Gil Hodges 
was in the opening day lineup, but as a catcher. He would only be shifted 
to first base after the emergence of Roy Campanella. Jackie Robinson started 
the season at second base — Eddie Stanky had been traded just before the 
start of the season to make room for Robinson at his natural position; 
he had played first base during his 1947 rookie season. Pee Wee Reese was 
the only "Boys of summer" regular to already be ensconced at his position, 
shortstop. Billy Cox had been acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates during 
the offseason, but as one of nine players who would see time at third for 
the team that year, he only played 70 games at the position. Carl Furillo 
was already a regular, but in center field. Duke Snider was brought up 
to the team in mid-season, and it was not until 1949 that Furillo moved 
to right field and Snider became the regular center fielder. Preacher Roe 
and Ralph Branca were in the starting rotation, but Carl Erskine only appeared 
in a handful,of games, and Don Newcombe would not join the staff until 
the following year. Future Hall of Famer Roy Campanella made his major 
league debut on April 20.[6] In July, Campanella replaced Bruce Edwards 
as the club's starting catcher. This marked the first time that a major 
league team had two black players in its everyday lineup.[7] On September 
9, Rex Barney pitched a no-hitter against the New York Giants. He walked 
two batters and struck out four in a 2–0 victory. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
