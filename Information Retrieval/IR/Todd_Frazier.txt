Todd Brian Frazier (born February 12, 1986) is an American professional 
baseball third baseman for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He has previously played for the Cincinnati Reds. Frazier is 6'3, 
215 lb, right-handed, was a shortstop in college, and was converted to 
the outfield in 2009. Todd Frazier was born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, 
as the youngest of three boys and of partial Scottish ancestry from his 
father's side.[1] He grew up in Toms River, New Jersey. He was a member 
of the 1996 Junior Pee-Wee National Champions.[citation needed] He played 
high school baseball at Toms River High School South.[2] At the age of 
12 and measuring 5 feet 2 inches (1.57 m) and 104 pounds (47 kg),[3] Frazier 
was a star on the Toms River East American Little League All-Star team 
that won the New Jersey state championship and then, the US East regional 
championship to advance to the 1998 Little League World Series in Williamsport, 
Pennsylvania. Dubbed the "Beasts of the East" for their skill, power and 
lucky charm stuffed gorilla, the team went undefeated in the tournament, 
and Frazier saved his best performance for the world championship game 
against the Far East and International champion Kashima Little League from 
Kashima, Ibaraki, Japan on August 29 at Howard J. Lamade Stadium. Beginning 
the game at shortstop, not only did he go 4-4 with a leadoff home run, 
but he was also the winning pitcher and recorded the game-winning strikeout 
that sealed a 12-9 Toms River win and the world championship – the first 
American Little League world championship since 1993.[4] To celebrate their 
world championship, the Toms River team was invited by the New York Yankees 
to Yankee Stadium on September 1, 1998, as the Yankees faced the Oakland 
Athletics, and each Toms River player was introduced publicly to the crowd 
and invited to stand next to his Yankee position counterpart during the 
national anthem, which meant that Frazier, as shortstop, was standing next 
to New Jersey-born Derek Jeter.[5] Fittingly, when he made it to the majors, 
Frazier would not only play against Jeter in the 2014 All-Star Game—Frazier's 
first and Jeter's last—but just days later would also help the Reds honor 
the Yankee captain's final year in baseball in a special pre-game tribute.[6] 
Frazier attended Rutgers University and played college baseball for the 
Rutgers Scarlet Knights. In 2007, he started all 63 games for Rutgers, 
posting a .377 batting average, a .502 on-base percentage, and a .757 slugging 
percentage. He won Big East player of the year in 2007 and was named a 
Rivals.com All-American.[7] His 42 home runs are the most in the school's 
history.[8] Frazier was drafted 34th overall by the Cincinnati Reds in 
the 2007 Major League Baseball draft.[9] On July 11, 2007, Frazier made 
his professional debut as a designated hitter for the Billings Mustangs—the 
Reds' Rookie-Advanced farm team in the Pioneer League—going 2-for-4 with 
two singles, an RBI and a run scored.[10] Frazier finished the 2007 season 
with the Dayton Dragons. Frazier played multiple positions for the Louisville 
Bats, the Reds' AAA team in the International League. He also spent the 
2010 preseason as a non-roster invitee to the Reds' training camp. After 
the 2010 season, he was added to the Reds' 40-man roster.[11] On May 23, 
2011, Frazier and Matt Maloney were called up to the majors, with Edinson 
Vólquez and Jordan Smith optioned to Louisville.[12] Frazier struck out 
in his first major league plate appearance facing Michael Stutes while 
pinch-hitting for Maloney.[13] On May 24, 2011, Frazier was optioned back 
to Louisville to add an extra relief pitcher, Carlos Fisher.[14] On July 
31, 2011, Frazier hit his first career home run, a solo shot off of Barry 
Zito's 1-1 hanging curveball. On May 16, 2012, Frazier hit two home runs 
against the New York Mets. On May 23, 2012, he hit a walk-off home run 
in the bottom of the ninth against the Atlanta Braves. On May 27, 2012, 
Frazier homered off of the Colorado Rockies' Jamie Moyer in a 7-5 Reds' 
win. The home run was unusual because Frazier's bat slipped out of his 
hands as he was swinging.[15] The same day, he had saved the life of a 
man choking on a piece of steak by administering the Heimlich maneuver. 
Of the latter experience, he said, "I gave two pumps and it came out . 
. . It was pretty surreal. I have never done that before." [16] On November 
5, 2012, Frazier was named the National League's Outstanding Rookie by 
the MLB Players Association.[17] On April 18, 2013, Frazier hit a homer 
for Reds' honorary batboy Teddy Kremer, an adult with Down syndrome.[18] 
On July 6, 2014, Frazier was named a National League All-Star for the first 
time in his career, along with teammates Johnny Cueto, Aroldis Chapman 
and Devin Mesoraco and later Alfredo Simón. On July 8, he was selected 
to participate in the Home Run Derby.[19] In the Derby, where Frazier's 
brother Charlie served as his pitcher, he won the National League bracket 
and represented the NL in the final, where he lost to defending champ Yoenis 
Céspedes.[20][21] On February 8, 2015 Frazier and the Reds reached an agreement 
on a two-year, $12 million contract. The deal will pay Frazier $4.5 million 
in 2015, including a signing bonus, and $7.5 million in 2016.[22] On April 
21, 2015 Frazier hit his first career grand slam, against the Brewers.[23] 
On May 12, 2015 the Reds announced that Frazier would serve as the 2015 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game spokesperson.[24] On July 13, 2015, 
Frazier won the 2015 MLB Home Run Derby on his home field in Cincinnati. 
Frazier beat the 2012 Derby champion Prince Fielder, in the first round 
and defeated Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson in the second round 
and then beat the Los Angeles Dodgers' rookie centerfielder Joc Pederson 
in the final round.[25][26] He became the first hometown participant to 
win the derby since Ryne Sandberg won as a Chicago Cub in 1990.[26] On 
December 16, 2015, Frazier was traded to the Chicago White Sox as part 
of a three team trade that sent Scott Schebler, José Peraza, and Brandon 
Dixon to the Cincinnati Reds and Frankie Montas, Micah Johnson, and Trayce 
Thompson to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[27] On May 11, 2016, Frazier made 
an astounding play in the seats behind the third base line. In recoil, 
he suffered an apparent facial injury and left the game. Luckily, the injury 
was nothing serious, but it required 5 stitches by the lower lip.[28] On 
July 11, 2016, Frazier placed second in the 2016 MLB Home Run Derby at 
Petco Park in San Diego, losing to Giancarlo Stanton 20 to 13 in the final 
round. Frazier's total of 42 home runs, and Stanton's total of 61 home 
runs in the 2016 Derby make them the top two hitters of all time in a single 
Derby.[29] On December 14, 2012, Frazier married his longtime girlfriend 
Jackie Verdon, a former Rutgers gymnast, who is also a New Jersey native.[30] 
In March 2014, they had their first child, a son named Blake.[31] Their 
daughter, Kylie Kimberly, was born in December 2015.[32] He now lives in 
Toms River, where his name now graces the Little League field called Frazier 
Field House.[33] Frazier has two older brothers who also played professional 
baseball. Jeff Frazier played in nine major league games in 2010 for the 
Detroit Tigers and spent a total of nine seasons with the Detroit Tigers, 
Seattle Mariners, Washington Nationals and the Chicago Cubs organizations 
without returning to the Major Leagues.[34][35] Charlie Frazier played 
for six seasons with the Miami Marlins.[20][36] Frazier is a fan of fellow 
New Jerseyan Frank Sinatra, and often chose Sinatra's songs to play when 
he walked up to the batter's box before an at-bat during home games at 
Great American Ball Park when he was a member of the Reds and currently
