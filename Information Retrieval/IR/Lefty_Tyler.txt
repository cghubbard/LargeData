George Albert "Lefty" Tyler (December 14, 1889 â€“ September 29, 1953) was 
a professional baseball pitcher from 1910 to 1921. From 1910 to 1917, Tyler 
played with the Boston Doves/Boston Braves. He performed well, having an 
earned run average (ERA) under 3 in all but two years. In 1918, Tyler was 
traded to the Chicago Cubs for Larry Doyle, Art Wilson, and $15,000. Tyler 
did well in Chicago as well, having ERA's under 4. He was the winning pitcher 
in Game 2 of the 1918 World Series for the Cubs, as well as the hard-luck 
loser of a 2-1 decision in Game 6. Tyler's career earned run average was 
2.95. His brother, Fred Tyler, played in the major leagues in 1914 as a 
catcher. In 1914, Tyler was a member of the Braves team that went from 
last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win 
a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July.[1] The team 
then went on to defeat Connie Mack's heavily favored Philadelphia Athletics
