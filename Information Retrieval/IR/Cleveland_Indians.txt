The Cleveland Indians are an American professional baseball team based 
in Cleveland, Ohio. The Indians compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. Since 1994, 
they have played at Progressive Field. The team's spring training facility 
is at Goodyear Ballpark in Goodyear, Arizona.[2] Since their establishment 
as a major league franchise in 1901, the Indians have won two World Series 
championships: in 1920 and 1948, along with eight Central Division titles 
and six American League pennants. The Indians' current World Series championship 
drought is the longest active drought, and through 2016 is the fifth-longest 
in baseball history.[3] The name "Indians" originated from a request by 
club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace 
"Cleveland Naps" following the departure of Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season. 
The name referenced the nickname "Indians" that was applied to the Cleveland 
Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, 
played in Cleveland.[4] Common nicknames for the Indians include the "Tribe" 
and the "Wahoos", the latter being a reference to their logo, Chief Wahoo, 
a controversial Native American caricature. The team's mascot is named 
"Slider." The Cleveland Indians originated in Michigan in 1894 as the Grand 
Rapids Rustlers, a minor league team in the Western League. The team moved 
to Cleveland in 1900, changing its name to the Cleveland Lake Shores; the 
Western League itself changed its name to the American League (AL) while 
continuing its minor league status. One of the American League's eight 
charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded 
in Cleveland in 1901. Originally called the Cleveland Bluebirds, the team 
played in League Park until moving permanently to Cleveland Stadium in 
1946. The Cleveland Indians reached the World Series in 2016 and held a 
3–1 lead against the Chicago Cubs, but they ultimately lost the series. 
At the end of the 2016 season, they had a regular season franchise record 
of 9,191–8,837 (.510). "In 1857 baseball games were a daily spectacle in 
Cleveland's Public Squares. City authorities tried to find an ordinance 
forbidding it, to the joy of the crowd, they were unsuccessful. – Harold 
Seymour" [5] From 1865 to 1868 Forest Citys was an amateur ball club. During 
the 1869 season, Cleveland was among several cities which established professional 
baseball teams following the success of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings, 
the first fully professional team. In the newspapers before and after 1870, 
the team was often called the Forest Citys, in the same generic way that 
the team from Chicago was sometimes called The Chicagos. In 1871 the Forest 
Citys joined the new National Association of Professional Base Ball Players 
(NA), the first professional league. Ultimately, two of the league's western 
clubs went out of business during the first season and the Chicago Fire 
left that city's White Stockings impoverished, unable to field a team again 
until 1874. Cleveland was thus the NA's westernmost outpost in 1872, the 
year the club folded. Cleveland played their full schedule to July 19 followed 
by two games versus Boston in mid-August and disbanded at the end of the 
season.[6] In 1876, the National League (NL) supplanted the NA as the major 
professional league. Cleveland were not among its charter members, but 
by 1879 the league was looking for new entries and the city gained an NL 
team. The Cleveland Forest Citys baseball team was then re-created. The 
National League required distinct colors for the 1882 season, so the Cleveland 
Forest Citys became the Cleveland Blues. They then had a mediocre record 
for six seasons and were ruined by a trade war with the Union Association 
(UA) in 1884, when its three best players (Fred Dunlap, Jack Glasscock, 
and Jim McCormick) jumped to the UA after being offered higher salaries. 
Cleveland Blues merged with the St. Louis Maroons UA team in 1885. Cleveland 
went without major league baseball for two seasons until gaining a team 
in the American Association (AA) in 1887. After the AA's Allegheny club 
jumped to the NL Cleveland followed suit in 1889, as the AA began to crumble. 
The Cleveland ball club, named the Spiders (supposedly inspired by their 
"skinny and spindly" players) slowly became a power in the league.[7] The 
next year the Spiders moved into League Park, which would serve as the 
home of Cleveland professional baseball for the next 55 years. Led by native 
Ohioan Cy Young, the Spiders became a contender in the mid-1890s, when 
they played in the Temple Cup Series (that era's World Series) twice, winning 
it in 1895. The team began to fade after this success, and was dealt a 
severe blow under the ownership of the Robison brothers Prior to the 1899 
season, Frank Robison, the Spiders owner, bought the St. Louis Browns, 
thus owning two clubs at the same time. The Browns were renamed the "Perfectos", 
and restocked with Cleveland talent. Just weeks before the season opener, 
most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis, including 
three future Hall of Famers: Cy Young, Jesse Burkett and Bobby Wallace. 
[8] The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team, 
as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900. The Spiders were left 
with essentially a minor league lineup, and began to lose games at a record 
pace. Drawing almost no fans at home, they ended up playing most of their 
season on the road, and became known as "The Wanderers."[9] The team ended 
the season in 12th place, 84 games out of first place, with an all-time 
worst record of 20-134 (.130 winning percentage).[10] Following the 1899 
season, the National League disbanded four teams, including the Cleveland 
franchise. The disastrous 1899 season would actually be a step toward a 
new future for Cleveland fans the next year. The Cleveland Infants were 
in the Players' League. The League was well-attended, at least in some 
cities, but was underfunded and its owners lacked the confidence to continue 
beyond the one season. There were eight teams who were star-studded; the 
Boston franchise won the championship. The Cleveland Infants finished with 
55 wins and 75 losses. Their home games were played at Brotherhood Park.[11] 
The Grand Rapids Rustlers were founded in Michigan in 1894 and were part 
of the Western League. In 1900 the team moved to Cleveland and was named 
the Cleveland Lake Shores. Around the same time Ban Johnson changed the 
name of his minor league (Western League) to the American League. In 1900 
the American League was still considered a minor league. In 1901 team was 
renamed the Cleveland Bluebirds when the American League broke with the 
National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League. The Cleveland 
franchise was among its eight charter members. The new team was owned by 
coal magnate Charles Somers and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy 
industrialist and also co-owner of the Boston Americans, lent money to 
other team owners, including Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, to keep 
them and the new league afloat. Players didn't think the name "Bluebirds" 
was suitable for a baseball team.[12] Writers frequently shortened it to 
Cleveland Blues due to the players' all-blue uniforms,[13] but the players 
didn't like this unofficial name either.[citation needed] The players themselves 
tried to change the name to Cleveland Broncos in 1902, but this unofficial 
name never really caught on.[12] The Bluebirds suffered from financial 
problems in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider 
moving to either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati. Relief came in 1902 as a result 
of the conflict between the National and American Leagues. In 1901, Napoleon 
"Nap" Lajoie, the Philadelphia Phillies' star second baseman, jumped to 
the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year—one of the highest-profile 
players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction 
to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement 
between the warring leagues. However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction 
was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania.[12] Mack, partly to 
thank Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to 
the then-moribund Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years.[14] 
Due to the injunction, however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played 
against the A's in Philadelphia.[15] Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 
4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 10,000 fans to League Park. Soon afterward, 
he was named team captain, and in 1903 the team was renamed the Cleveland 
Napoleons (soon shortened to Naps) after a newspaper conducted a write-in 
contest.[12] Lajoie was named manager in 1905, and the team's fortunes 
improved somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908.[16] 
However, the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season 
as manager but remained on as a player.[17] After that, the team began 
to unravel, leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. Cy 
Young, who returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his 
three remaining years[18] and Addie Joss died from tubercular meningitis 
prior to the 1911 season.[19] Despite a strong lineup anchored by the potent 
Lajoie and Shoeless Joe Jackson, poor pitching kept the team below third 
place for most of the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as 
the Napkins, "because they fold up so easily". The team hit bottom in 1914 
and 1915, finishing in the cellar both years.[20][21] 1915 brought significant 
changes to the team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old was no longer a top hitter 
in the league, batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud 
with manager Joe Birmingham, the team sold Lajoie back to the A's.[22] 
With Lajoie gone, the club needed a new name. Somers asked the local baseball 
writers to come up with a new name, and based on their input, the team 
was renamed the Cleveland Indians.[23] The name referenced the nickname 
"Indians" that was applied to the Cleveland Spiders baseball club during 
the time when Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, played in Cleveland 
(1897–99).[24] At the same time, Somers' business ventures began to fail, 
leaving him deeply in debt. With the Indians playing poorly, attendance 
and revenue suffered.[25] Somers decided to trade Jackson midway through 
the 1915 season for two players and $31,500, one of the largest sums paid 
for a player at the time.[26] By 1916, Somers was at the end of his tether, 
and sold the team to a syndicate headed by Chicago railroad contractor 
James C. "Jack" Dunn.[25] Manager Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 
1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, Stan Coveleski and Jim Bagby 
and traded for center fielder Tris Speaker, who was engaged in a salary 
dispute with the Red Sox.[27] All three would ultimately become key players 
in bringing a championship to Cleveland. Speaker took over the reins as 
player-manager in 1919, and would lead the team to a championship in 1920. 
On August 16, the Indians were playing the Yankees at the Polo Grounds 
in New York. Shortstop Ray Chapman, who often crowded the plate, was batting 
against Carl Mays, who had an unusual underhand delivery. It was also late 
in the afternoon and the infield would have been in shadow with the center 
field area (the batters' background) bathed in sunlight. As well, at the 
time, "part of every pitcher's job was to dirty up a new ball the moment 
it was thrown onto the field. By turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, 
tobacco juice; it was deliberately scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, 
even spiked. The result was a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled 
through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and 
as it came over the plate, was very hard to see."[28] In any case, Chapman 
did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch came his way. The pitch hit Chapman 
in the head, fracturing his skull. Chapman died the next day, becoming 
the only player to sustain a fatal injury from a pitched ball.[29] The 
Indians, who at the time were locked in a tight three-way pennant race 
with the Yankees and White Sox,[30] were not slowed down by the death of 
their teammate. Rookie Joe Sewell hit .329 after replacing Chapman in the 
lineup.[31] In September 1920, the Black Sox Scandal came to a boil. With 
just a few games left in the season, and Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck 
for first place at 94–54 and 95–56 respectively,[32][33] the Chicago owner 
suspended eight players. The White Sox lost two of three in their final 
series, while Cleveland won four and lost two in their final two series. 
Cleveland finished two games ahead of Chicago and three games ahead of 
the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's .388 hitting, Jim 
Bagby's 30 victories and solid performances from Steve O'Neill and Stan 
Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the Brooklyn Robins 5–2 in the World 
Series for their first title, winning four games in a row after the Robins 
took a 2–1 Series lead. The Series included three memorable "firsts", all 
of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the home team. In the first 
inning, right fielder Elmer Smith hit the first Series grand slam. In the 
fourth inning, Jim Bagby hit the first Series home run by a pitcher. And 
in the top of the fifth inning, second baseman Bill Wambsganss executed 
the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple play in World Series history, 
in fact the only Series triple play of any kind. The team would not reach 
the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. Speaker and Coveleski were aging 
and the Yankees were rising with a new weapon: Babe Ruth and the home run. 
They managed two second-place finishes but spent much of the decade in 
the cellar. In 1927 Dunn's widow, Mrs. George Pross (Dunn had died in 1922), 
sold the team to a syndicate headed by Alva Bradley. The Indians were a 
middling team by the 1930s, finishing third or fourth most years. 1936 
brought Cleveland a new superstar in 17-year-old pitcher Bob Feller, who 
came from Iowa with a dominating fastball. That season, Feller set a record 
with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the league in strikeouts 
from 1938–1941. On August 20, 1938, Indians catchers Hank Helf and Frank 
Pytlak set the "all-time altitude mark" by catching baseballs dropped from 
the 708-foot Terminal Tower.[34] By 1940, Feller, along with Ken Keltner, 
Mel Harder and Lou Boudreau led the Indians to within one game of the pennant. 
However, the team was wracked with dissension, with some players (including 
Feller and Mel Harder) going so far as to request that Bradley fire manager 
Ossie Vitt. Reporters lampooned them as the Cleveland Crybabies.[35][better source needed] 
Feller, who had pitched a no-hitter to open the season and won 27 games, 
lost the final game of the season to unknown pitcher Floyd Giebell of the 
Detroit Tigers. The Tigers won the pennant and Giebell never won another 
major league game.[36] Cleveland entered 1941 with a young team and a new 
manager; Roger Peckinpaugh had replaced the despised Vitt; but the team 
regressed, finishing in fourth. Cleveland would soon be depleted of two 
stars. Hal Trosky retired in 1941 due to migraine headaches[37] and Bob 
Feller enlisted in the Navy two days after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Starting third baseman Ken Keltner and outfielder Ray Mack were both drafted 
in 1945 taking two more starters out of the lineup.[38] In 1946, Bill Veeck 
formed an investment group that purchased the Cleveland Indians from Bradley's 
group for a reported $1.6 million.[39] Among the investors was Bob Hope, 
who had grown up in Cleveland, and former Tigers slugger, Hank Greenberg.[40] 
A former owner of a minor league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought 
to Cleveland a gift for promotion. At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced[41] 
Max Patkin, the "Clown Prince of Baseball" as a coach. Patkin's appearance 
in the coaching box was the sort of promotional stunt that delighted fans 
but infuriated the American League front office. Recognizing that he had 
acquired a solid team, Veeck soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless 
League Park to take up full-time residence in massive Cleveland Municipal 
Stadium.[42] The Indians had briefly moved from League Park to Municipal 
Stadium in mid-1932, but moved back to League Park due to complaints about 
the cavernous environment. From 1936 onward, however, the Indians began 
playing an increasing number of games at Municipal, until by 1940 they 
played most of their home slate there.[43] League Park was demolished in 
1951, but has since been rebuilt as a recreational park.[44] Making the 
most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence 
installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance 
favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence 
moved as much as 15 feet (5 m) between series opponents. Following the 
1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed 
the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season. The massive 
stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the 
largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game. On October 10, 1948, 
Game 5 of the World Series against the Boston Braves drew over 84,000. 
The record stood until the Los Angeles Dodgers drew a crowd in excess of 
92,500 to watch Game 5 of the 1959 World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum against the Chicago White Sox. Under Veeck's leadership, one of 
Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the color barrier 
in the American League by signing Larry Doby, formerly a player for the 
Negro League's Newark Eagles in 1947, 11 weeks after Jackie Robinson signed 
with the Dodgers.[42] Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off 
the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season. 
A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League twice in homers. 
In 1948, needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant race, Veeck 
turned to the Negro League again and signed pitching great Satchel Paige 
amid much controversy.[42] Barred from Major League Baseball during his 
prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed by many as 
another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest 
rookie in Major League baseball history, and the first black pitcher. Paige 
ended the year with a 6–1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two 
shutouts.[45] In 1948, veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and Joe Gordon had career 
offensive seasons, while newcomers Doby and Gene Bearden also had standout 
seasons. The team went down to the wire with the Boston Red Sox, winning 
a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, to go to the 
World Series. In the series, the Indians defeated the Boston Braves four 
games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau won the 
American League MVP Award. The Indians would appear in a film the following 
year titled The Kid From Cleveland, in which Veeck had an interest.[42] 
The film portrayed the team helping out a "troubled teenaged fan"[46] and 
featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during 
the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards 
the end of the season.[42] That season, Cleveland again contended before 
falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians 
buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically 
eliminated from the pennant race.[42] Later in 1949, Veeck's first wife 
(who had a half-stake in Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With 
most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the 
team[47] to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan. Ryan was 
forced out in 1953 in favor of Myron Wilson, who in turn gave way to William 
Daley in 1956. Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team 
composed of Feller, Doby, Minnie Miñoso, Luke Easter, Bobby Ávila, Al Rosen, 
Early Wynn, Bob Lemon, and Mike Garcia continued to contend through the 
early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, 
in 1954, finishing second to the New York Yankees five times. The winningest 
season in franchise history came in 1954, when the Indians finished the 
season with a record of 111–43 (.721). That mark set an American League 
record for wins which stood for 44 years until the Yankees won 114 games 
in 1998 (a 162-game regular season). The Indians 1954 winning percentage 
of .721 is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the 
World Series to face the New York Giants. The team could not bring home 
the title, however, ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The 
series was notable for Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch off the bat 
of Vic Wertz in Game 1. From 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place 
finish (in 1968) and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974 to 1976, 
1990, and 1992) but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of 
the standings. The Indians hired general manager Frank Lane, known as "Trader" 
Lane, away from the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957. Lane over the years had 
gained a reputation as a GM who loved to make deals. With the White Sox, 
Lane had made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years.[48] 
In a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away Red Schoendienst and Harvey 
Haddix.[48] Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals 
he regretted were the ones that he didn't make.[49] One of Lane's early 
trades in Cleveland was to send Roger Maris to the Kansas City Athletics 
in the middle of 1958. Indians executive Hank Greenberg was not happy about 
the trade[50] and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane.[50] 
After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by 
saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and 
he received good ballplayers in exchange.[50] After the Maris trade, Lane 
acquired 25-year-old Norm Cash from the White Sox for Minnie Miñoso and 
then traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians; 
Cash went on to hit over 350 home runs for the Tigers. The Indians received 
Steve Demeter in the deal, who would have only five at-bats for Cleveland.[51] 
In 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland 
when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite[52] Rocky Colavito 
to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn just before Opening Day in 1960. 
It was a blockbuster trade that swapped the 1959 AL home run co-champion 
(Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, 
Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams 
for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in 1965. Kuenn, 
on the other hand, would play only one season for the Indians before departing 
for San Francisco in a trade for an aging Johnny Antonelli and Willie Kirkland. 
Akron Beacon Journal columnist Terry Pluto documented the decades of woe 
that followed the trade in his book The Curse of Rocky Colavito.[53] Despite 
being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse 
on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with 
Lane.[54] Lane also engineered a unique trade of managers in mid-season 
1960, sending Joe Gordon to the Tigers in exchange for Jimmy Dykes. Lane 
left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued. In 1965, the Indians 
traded pitcher Tommy John, who would go on to win 288 games in his career, 
and 1966 Rookie of the Year Tommy Agee to the White Sox to get Colavito 
back.[54] Indians' pitchers also set numerous strikeout records. They led 
the league in K's every year from 1963 to 1968, and narrowly missed in 
1969. The 1964 staff was the first to amass 1,100 strikeouts, and in 1968, 
they were the first to collect more strikeouts than hits allowed. The 1970s 
were not much better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, 
including Graig Nettles, Dennis Eckersley, Buddy Bell and 1971 Rookie of 
the Year Chris Chambliss,[55] for a number of players who made no impact.[56] 
Constant ownership changes did not help the Indians. In 1963, Daley's syndicate 
sold the team to a group headed by general manager Gabe Paul.[12] Three 
years later, Paul sold the Indians to Vernon Stouffer,[57] of the Stouffer's 
frozen-food empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored 
to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially 
strong owner, Stouffer had some non-baseball related financial setbacks 
and, consequently, the team was cash-poor. In order to solve some financial 
problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games 
in New Orleans with a view to a possible move there.[58] After rejecting 
an offer from George Steinbrenner and former Indian Al Rosen, Stouffer 
sold the team in 1972 to a group led by Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland 
Barons owner Nick Mileti.[58] Steinbrenner went on to buy the New York 
Yankees in 1973.[59] Only five years later, Mileti's group sold the team 
for $11 million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Steve O'Neill 
and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul.[60] O'Neill's 
death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. O'Neill's 
nephew Patrick O'Neill did not find a buyer until real estate magnates 
Richard and David Jacobs purchased the team in 1986.[61] The team was unable 
to move out of the cellar, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One 
highlight was the acquisition of Gaylord Perry in 1972. The Indians traded 
fireballer "Sudden Sam" McDowell for Perry, who became the first Indian 
pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. In 1975, Cleveland broke another color 
barrier with the hiring of Frank Robinson as Major League Baseball's first 
African American manager. Robinson served as player-manager and would provide 
a franchise highlight when he hit a pinch hit home run on Opening Day. 
But the high-profile signing of Wayne Garland, a 20-game winner in Baltimore, 
proved to be a disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and 
went 28–48 over five years.[62] The team failed to improve with Robinson 
as manager and he was fired in 1977. In 1977, pitcher Dennis Eckersley 
threw a no-hitter against the California Angels. The next season, he would 
be dealt to the Boston Red Sox where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 
17 in 1979. The 1970s also featured the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night at 
Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a 1974 game 
against the Texas Rangers ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the 
Indians.[63] There were more bright spots in the 1980s. In May 1981, Len 
Barker threw a perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays, joining Addie 
Joss as the only other Indian pitcher to do so.[64] "Super Joe" Charbonneau 
won the American League Rookie of the Year award. Unfortunately, Charboneau 
was out of baseball by 1983 after falling victim to back injuries[65] and 
Barker, who was also hampered by injuries, never became a consistently 
dominant starting pitcher.[64] Eventually, the Indians traded Barker to 
the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler and Brook Jacoby,[64] who would become 
mainstays of the team for the remainder of the decade. Butler and Jacoby 
were joined by Joe Carter, Mel Hall, Julio Franco and Cory Snyder, which 
brought new hope to fans in the late 1980s.[66] Cleveland's struggles over 
the 30-year span were highlighted in the 1989 film Major League, which 
comically depicted a hapless Cleveland ball club going from worst to first 
by the end of the film. Throughout the 1980s, the Indians' owners had pushed 
for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium had been a symbol of the Indians' 
glory years in the 1940s and 1950s.[67] However, during the lean years 
even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. The 
old stadium was not aging gracefully; chunks of concrete were falling off 
in sections and the old wooden pilings now petrified.[68] In 1984, a proposal 
for a $150 million domed stadium was defeated in a referendum 2–1.[69] 
Finally, in May 1990, Cuyahoga County voters passed an excise tax on sales 
of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax proceeds would be used 
to finance the building of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex 
which would include Jacobs Field and Gund Arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers 
basketball team.[70] The team had new ownership and a new stadium on the 
way. They now needed a winning team. The team's fortunes started to turn 
in 1989, ironically with a very unpopular trade. The team sent power-hitting 
outfielder Joe Carter to the San Diego Padres for two unproven players, 
Sandy Alomar, Jr. and Carlos Baerga. Alomar made an immediate impact, not 
only being elected to the All-Star team but also winning Cleveland's fourth 
Rookie of the Year award and a Gold Glove. Baerga would become a three-time 
All-Star with consistent offensive production. Indians general manager 
John Hart made a number of moves that would finally bring success to the 
team. In 1991, he hired former Indian Mike Hargrove to manage and traded 
catcher Eddie Taubensee to the Houston Astros who, with a surplus of outfielders, 
were willing to part with Kenny Lofton. Lofton finished second in AL Rookie 
of the Year balloting with a .285 average and 66 stolen bases. The Indians 
were named "Organization of the Year" by Baseball America[71] in 1992, 
in response to the appearance of offensive bright spots and an improving 
farm system. The team suffered a tragedy during spring training of 1993, 
when a boat carrying pitchers Steve Olin, Tim Crews, and Bob Ojeda crashed 
into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, and Ojeda was seriously injured. 
(Ojeda missed most of the season, and would retire the following year).[72] 
By the end of the 1993 season, the team was in transition, leaving Cleveland 
Stadium and fielding a talented nucleus of young players. Many of those 
players came from the Indians' new AAA farm team, the Charlotte Knights, 
who won the International League title that year. Indians General Manager 
John Hart and team owner Richard Jacobs managed to turn the team's fortunes 
around. The Indians opened Jacobs Field in 1994 with the aim of improving 
on the prior season's sixth-place finish. The Indians were only one game 
behind the division-leading Chicago White Sox on August 12 when a players 
strike wiped out the rest of the season. Having contended for the division 
in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland sprinted to a 100–44 record (the 
season was shortened by 18 games due to player/owner negotiations) in 1995, 
winning its first ever divisional title. Veterans Dennis Martínez, Orel 
Hershiser and Eddie Murray combined with a young core of players including 
Albert Belle, Jim Thome, Manny Ramírez, Kenny Lofton and Charles Nagy to 
lead the league in team batting average as well as team ERA. After defeating 
the Boston Red Sox in the Division Series and the Seattle Mariners in the 
ALCS, Cleveland clinched the American League pennant and a World Series 
berth, for the first time since 1954. The World Series ended in disappointment 
with the Indians falling in six games to the Atlanta Braves. Tickets for 
every Indians home game sold out several months before opening day in 1996.[73] 
The Indians repeated as AL Central champions but lost to the Baltimore 
Orioles in the Division Series. In 1997 Cleveland started slow but finished 
with an 86–75 record. Taking their third consecutive AL Central title, 
the Indians defeated the New York Yankees in the Division Series, 3–2. 
After defeating the Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS, Cleveland went on to 
face the Florida Marlins in the World Series which featured the coldest 
game in World Series history. With the series tied after Game 6, the Indians 
went into the ninth inning of Game Seven with a 2–1 lead, but closer José 
Mesa allowed the Marlins to tie the game. In the eleventh inning, Édgar 
Rentería drove in the winning run giving the Marlins their first championship. 
Cleveland became the first team to lose the World Series after carrying 
the lead into the ninth inning of the seventh game. In 1998, the Indians 
made the postseason for the fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card 
Boston Red Sox 3–1 in the Division Series, Cleveland lost the 1998 ALCS 
in six games to the New York Yankees, who had come into the postseason 
with a then-AL record 114 wins in the regular season.[74] For the 1999 
season, Cleveland added relief pitcher Ricardo Rincón and second baseman 
Roberto Alomar, brother of catcher Sandy Alomar, Jr,[75] and won the Central 
Division title for the fifth consecutive year. The team scored 1,009 runs, 
becoming the first (and to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox 
to score more than 1,000 runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not 
make it past the first round, losing the Division Series to the Red Sox, 
despite taking a 2–0 lead in the series. In game three, Indians starter 
Dave Burba went down with an injury in the 4th inning.[76] Four pitchers, 
including presumed game four starter Jaret Wright, surrendered nine runs 
in relief. Without a long reliever or emergency starter on the playoff 
roster, Hargrove started both Bartolo Colón and Charles Nagy in games four 
and five on only three days rest.[76] The Indians lost game four 23–7 and 
game five 12–8.[77] Four days later, Hargrove was dismissed as manager.[78] 
In 2000, the Indians had a 44–42 start, but caught fire after the All Star 
break and went 46–30 the rest of the way to finish 90–72.[79] The team 
had one of the league's best offenses that year and a defense that yielded 
three gold gloves. However, they ended up five games behind the Chicago 
White Sox in the Central division and missed the wild card by one game 
to the Seattle Mariners. Mid-season trades brought Bob Wickman and Jake 
Westbrook to Cleveland. After the season and free agent outfielder Manny 
Ramírez departed for the Boston Red Sox. In 2000, Larry Dolan bought the 
Indians for $320 million from Richard Jacobs, who, along with his late 
brother David, had paid $45 million for the club in 1986. The sale set 
a record at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise.[80] 2001 saw 
a return to the postseason. After the departures of Ramírez and Sandy Alomar, 
Jr., the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former MVP Juan González, who helped 
the team win the Central division with a 91–71 record. One of the highlights 
came on August 5, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB 
History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14–2 deficit in the seventh inning 
to defeat the Seattle Mariners 15–14 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won 
a MLB record-tying 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians 
manager Charlie Manuel had already pulled many of his starters with the 
game seemingly out of reach. Seattle and Cleveland met in the first round 
of the postseason, however the Mariners won the series 3–2. In the 2001–02 
offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant, Mark Shapiro, took 
the reins. Shapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger 
talent. He traded Roberto Alomar to the New York Mets for a package that 
included outfielder Matt Lawton and prospects Alex Escobar and Billy Traber. 
When the team fell out of contention in mid-2002, Shapiro fired manager 
Charlie Manuel and traded pitching ace Bartolo Colón for prospects Brandon 
Phillips, Cliff Lee, and Grady Sizemore; acquired Travis Hafner from the 
Rangers for Ryan Drese and Einar Díaz; and picked up Coco Crisp from the 
St. Louis Cardinals for aging starter Chuck Finley. Jim Thome left after 
the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract. Young Indians 
teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and 2003 under new manager 
Eric Wedge. They posted strong offensive numbers in 2004, but continued 
to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of 
the season was a 22–0 victory over the New York Yankees on August 31, one 
of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.[81] In early 
2005, the offense got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the 
Indians caught fire in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central 
Division down to 1.5 games. However, the season came to an end as the Indians 
went on to lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, 
missing the playoffs by only two games. Shapiro was named Executive of 
the Year in 2005.[82] The next season, the club made several roster changes, 
while retaining its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted 
by the acquisition of top prospect Andy Marte from the Boston Red Sox. 
The Indians had a solid offensive season, led by career years from Travis 
Hafner and Grady Sizemore. Hafner, despite missing the last month of the 
season, tied the single season grand slam record of six, which was set 
in 1987 by Don Mattingly.[83] Despite the solid offensive performance, 
the bullpen struggled with 23 blown saves (a Major League worst), and the 
Indians finished a disappointing fourth.[84] In 2007, Shapiro signed veteran 
help for the bullpen and outfield in the offseason. Veterans Aaron Fultz 
and Joe Borowski joined Rafael Betancourt in the Indians bullpen.[85] The 
Indians improved significantly over the prior year and went into the All-Star 
break in second place. The team brought back Kenny Lofton for his third 
stint with the team in late July.[86] The Indians finished with a 96–66 
record tied with the Red Sox for best in baseball, their seventh Central 
Division title in 13 years and their first postseason trip since 2001.[87] 
The Indians began their playoff run by defeating the Yankees in the ALDS 
three games to one. This series will be most remembered for the swarm of 
bugs that overtook the field in the later innings of Game Two. They also 
jumped out to a three-games-to-one lead over the Red Sox in the ALCS. The 
season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games 
to advance to the 2007 World Series.[87] Despite the loss, Cleveland players 
took home a number of awards. Grady Sizemore, who had a .995 fielding percentage 
and only two errors in 405 chances, won the Gold Glove award, Cleveland's 
first since 2001.[88] Indians Pitcher CC Sabathia won the second Cy Young 
Award in team history with a 19–7 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 
241 innings pitched.[89] Eric Wedge was awarded the first Manager of the 
Year Award in team history.[90] Shapiro was named to his second Executive 
of the Year in 2007.[82] The Indians struggled during the 2008 season. 
Injuries to sluggers Travis Hafner and Victor Martinez, as well as starting 
pitchers Jake Westbrook and Fausto Carmona led to a poor start.[91] The 
Indians, falling to last place for a short time in June and July, traded 
CC Sabathia to the Milwaukee Brewers for prospects Matt LaPorta, Rob Bryson, 
and Michael Brantley.[92] and traded starting third basemen, Casey Blake, 
for catching prospect Carlos Santana.[93] Pitcher Cliff Lee went 22–3 with 
an ERA of 2.54 and earned the AL Cy Young Award.[94] Grady Sizemore had 
a career year, winning a Gold Glove Award and a Silver Slugger Award,[95] 
and the Indians finished with a record of 81–81. Prospects for the season 
dimmed early when the Indians ended May with a record of 22–30. Shapiro 
made multiple trades: Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco to the Philadelphia Phillies 
for prospects Jason Knapp, Carlos Carrasco, Jason Donald and Lou Marson; 
Victor Martinez to the Boston Red Sox for prospects Bryan Price, Nick Hagadone 
and Justin Masterson; Ryan Garko to the Texas Rangers for Scott Barnes; 
and Kelly Shoppach to the Tampa Bay Rays for Mitch Talbot. The Indians 
finished the season tied for fourth in their division, with a record of 
65–97. The team announced on September 30, 2009, that Eric Wedge and all 
of the team's coaching staff would be released at the end of the 2009 season.[96] 
Manny Acta was hired as the team's 40th manager on October 25, 2009.[97] 
On February 18, 2010, it was announced that Shapiro (following the end 
of the 2010 season) would be promoted to team President, with current President 
Paul Dolan becoming the new Chairman/CEO, and longtime Shapiro assistant 
Chris Antonetti filling the GM role.[98] On January 18, 2011, longtime 
popular former first baseman and manager Mike Hargrove was brought in as 
a special adviser. The Indians started the 2011 season strong – going 30–15 
in their first 45 games and seven games ahead of the Detroit Tigers for 
first place. Injuries led to a slump where the Indians fell out of first 
place. Many minor leaguers such as Jason Kipnis and Lonnie Chisenhall got 
opportunities to fill in for the injuries.[99] The biggest news of the 
season came on July 30 when the Indians traded four prospects for Colorado 
Rockies star pitcher, Ubaldo Jiménez. The Indians sent their top two pitchers 
in the minors, Alex White and Drew Pomeranz along with Joe Gardner and 
Matt McBride.[100] On August 25, the Indians signed the team leader in 
home runs, Jim Thome off of waivers.[101] He made his first appearance 
in an Indians uniform since he left Cleveland after the 2002 season. To 
honor Thome, the Indians placed him at his original position, third base, 
for one pitch against the Minnesota Twins on September 25. It was his first 
time playing third base since 1996.[102] This would also be his last appearance 
as an Indian. The Indians finished the season in 2nd place, 15 games behind 
the division champion Tigers.[103] The Indians broke the Opening Day attendance 
record for Progressive Field with 43,190 against the Toronto Blue Jays 
on April 5, 2012. The game went on to be the longest opening day game by 
innings in MLB history. The game was 16 innings and lasted 5 hours and 
14 minutes.[104] On September 27, 2012, with six games left in the Indians' 
2012 season, Manny Acta was fired; Sandy Alomar, Jr. was named interim 
manager for the remainder of the season.[105] On October 6, the Indians 
announced that Terry Francona, who managed the Boston Red Sox between 2004 
and 2011, winning two World Series and leading the team to numerous playoff 
appearances, would take over as manager of the Indians starting with the 
2013 season.[106] The Indians entered the 2013 season following an active 
offseason that resulted in a dramatic roster turnover. Key acquisitions 
included free agent 1B/OF Nick Swisher and CF Michael Bourn.[107] The Indians 
also added prized right handed pitching prospect Trevor Bauer, OF Drew 
Stubbs, and relief pitchers Bryan Shaw & Matt Albers in a three-way trade 
with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds that sent RF Shin-Soo 
Choo to the Reds, and Tony Sipp to the Arizona Diamondbacks[108] Other 
notable additions included utility man Mike Aviles, C Yan Gomes, DH Jason 
Giambi, and starting pitcher Scott Kazmir.[107][109] The 2013 Indians were 
able to increase their win total by 24 over 2012 (from 68 to 92), finishing 
in second place behind Detroit by one game in the Central Division, and 
securing the number one seed in the American League Wild Card standings. 
This marked the Indians' first time in postseason play since 2007. The 
2013 season ended for the Indians on October 2, losing 4–0 to the Tampa 
Bay Rays in the 2013 AL Wild Card Game. The turnaround from 2012 also led 
to Francona winning the 2013 American League Manager of the Year Award. 
The Indians had their second consecutive winning season (not done since 
2000–2001) in 2014 finishing 85–77. However, they finished third in the 
A.L. Central and missed the playoffs, having been eliminated from the A.L. 
Wild Card race during the last weekend of the season. In 2015 – after struggling 
through the first half of the season – the Indians finished 81-80 for their 
third consecutive winning season (not done since 1999–2001), finishing 
third in the A.L. Central for the second straight year, and was eliminated 
from the A.L. Wild Card race during the last week of the season. On October 
6, following the departure of longtime team executive Mark Shapiro, the 
Indians promoted GM Chris Antonetti to President of Baseball Operations, 
promoted assistant general manager Mike Chernoff to GM, and named Derek 
Falvey as assistant GM.[110] On July 1, 2016, the Indians set a franchise 
record for the longest winning streak in team history, when they won their 
14th game in a row after beating the Toronto Blue Jays 2-1 in 19 innings.[111] 
On September 26, the team clinched the AL Central Division pennant for 
the first time since 2007 and their eighth overall as well as returning 
to the playoffs for the first time since 2013. They finished the regular 
season at 94–67, marking their fourth straight winning season - a feat 
not accomplished since the 90s/early 2000s. The Indians began the 2016 
postseason by sweeping the Boston Red Sox in the best-of-five American 
League Division Series. They then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays in five 
games in the 2016 American League Championship Series to claim their sixth 
American League pennant and advance to the World Series against the Chicago 
Cubs. It marked the first appearance for the Indians in the World Series 
since 1997 and first for the Cubs since 1945. The Indians took a 3–1 series 
lead following a victory in Game 4 at Wrigley Field, but the Cubs rallied 
to take the final three games and end their 108-year championship drought, 
winning Game 7 at Progressive Field by a score of 8–7. Since the introduction 
of interleague play in 1997, the Indians have developed two rivalries with 
National League (NL) teams, the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, 
both members of the National League Central. Until 2002, the Indians only 
played teams from the NL Central in interleague play. The format was changed 
in 2002 to have the divisions rotate. Since 2003, the Indians and Reds 
are designated rivals, meaning they play every season regardless of what 
division is scheduled to play the AL Central that year. The Pirates are 
not designated rivals so games between the two teams are less frequent. 
The rivalry with fellow Ohio team the Cincinnati Reds is known as the Battle 
of Ohio or Buckeye Series and features the Ohio Cup trophy for the winner. 
Prior to 1997, the winner of the cup was determined by an annual pre-season 
baseball game, played each year at minor-league Cooper Stadium in the state 
capital of Columbus, and staged just days before the start of each new 
Major League Baseball season. A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, 
with the Indians winning six of them. It ended with the start of interleague 
play in 1997. The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup 
in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans 
in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000. Since 1997, the 
two teams have played each other as part of the regular season, with the 
exception of 2002. The Ohio Cup was reintroduced in 2008 and is presented 
to the team who wins the most games in the series that season. Initially, 
the teams only played one three-game series per season, meeting in Cleveland 
in 1997 and Cincinnati the following year. Since 1999, the teams have played 
two series per season against each other, one series at each ballpark. 
A four-game home-and-home format was introduced in 2013 where the teams 
play a four-game series with two games in each city back-to-back.[112] 
This format was also used in 2014 and again in 2016, while the 2015 meetings 
again featured two separate three-game series. Through the 2016 meetings, 
the Indians lead the series 54–45.[113] A small rivalry with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates stems from the close proximity of the two cities, and features 
some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football 
League (NFL) between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Because 
the Indians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' 
designated rival is the Detroit Tigers, the teams have played periodically, 
with one three-game series per season from 1997 to 2001, 2003, 2006, 2009 
to 2012, and 2015. Since 2012, the Indians and Pirates play one three-game 
series every three seasons when the AL Central Division plays the NL Central 
Division as part of the interleague play rotation. Through the 2015 meetings, 
the Pirates lead the series 19–17.[114] As the Indians play 19 games every 
year with each of their A.L. Central competitors, several rivalries have 
developed. The Indians have a rivalry with the Detroit Tigers due to the 
fact that the two cities are fairly close to each other, the teams have 
been battling for the A.L. Central championship in recent years, and has 
some carryover elements from the Ohio State-Michigan rivalry, as well as 
the general historic rivalry between Michiganders and Ohioans dating back 
to the "Toledo War." The Indians have had an on and off rivalry with the 
Chicago White Sox since the 1959 season (when the Sox slipped past the 
Tribe to win the A.L. pennant), and has intensified since both clubs moved 
to the A.L. Central. Probably the most infamous moment in the White Sox 
rivalry was in 1994 when the White Sox confiscated Albert Belle's corked 
bat, and the ensuing attempt by Indians pitcher Jason Grimsley to crawl 
through the Comiskey Park (now U.S. Cellular Field) clubhouse ceiling to 
retrieve it. Belle later moved to the White Sox in 1997, making the rivalry 
even more intense. The Indians also have a divisional rivalry with the 
Kansas City Royals, mainly due to numerous bench clearing brawls in the 
recent past. The rivalry has intensified when Indians closer Chris Perez 
used WWE star John Cena's signature "You can't see me" hand gesture towards 
KC outfielder Jarrod Dyson after striking him out in a game on May 28, 
2012.[115] The Indians' home uniform is white with navy piping around each 
sleeve. Across the front of the jersey in script font is the word "Indians" 
in red with a navy outline. The jersey has the Chief Wahoo logo on the 
left sleeve. The home cap is navy blue with a red bill and features the 
Chief Wahoo logo on the front. Beginning with the 2016 season, the Indians 
returned to their 1994–2002 practice of wearing red shirts, belts, and 
socks with their home uniforms, having worn navy with the home uniform 
from 2003–2015. The road uniform is gray, with "Cleveland" in navy blue 
block letters trimmed in red is across the front of the jersey, navy blue 
piping around the sleeves, and the Chief Wahoo logo located on the left 
sleeve. The road cap is navy blue with a red block "C" on the front. The 
Indians wear navy shirts, belts, and socks with their away uniforms. The 
alternate home uniform is cream colored with "Indians" across the front 
in red block lettering with a dark navy blue outline. The Chief Wahoo logo 
is located on the left sleeve. This jersey is the only Indians jersey to 
not have the players' names on the back. The alternate home cap is red 
with a navy blue block "C" on the front. This uniform is worn during weekend 
and holiday home games with red shirts, belts, and socks. (Note: This uniform 
will be dropped for the 2017 season.) The Indians also feature an alternate 
fourth jersey which is midnight blue with white piping around each sleeve. 
Script "Indians" is located across the front of the jersey in the same 
fashion as the home uniform (red lettering with a white outline); the Chief 
Wahoo logo is on the left sleeve. When the blue jerseys are worn on the 
road, the team compliments them with an alternate road cap that is also 
midnight blue with the Chief Wahoo logo on the front. When the blue jerseys 
are worn at home, the standard home cap is used.[116] For all games, the 
team uses a navy blue batting helmet with a red block "C" on the front.[117] 
John Adams, known by baseball fans as "The Drummer", has played a bass 
drum at nearly every home game since 1973. He is the only fan for whom 
the team has dedicated a bobble head day.[118] Adams originally paid for 
his tickets (one for himself, and one for his drum), but recently the Indians 
have paid for his seats in honor of the contributions he has made to the 
ballpark atmosphere. He has been featured and interviewed on national TV 
shows and newspaper articles. [119] Between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 
2001, the Indians sold out 455 consecutive home games, drawing a total 
of 19,324,248 fans to Jacobs Field. The demand for tickets was so great 
that all 81 home games were sold out before Opening Day on at least three 
separate occasions. The sellout streak set a Major League Baseball record; 
this was broken by the Boston Red Sox on September 8, 2008, though Boston's 
Fenway Park is considerably smaller than Progressive Field.[120] One night 
after the streak ended, the Indians honored the fans by retiring the number 
455. The Indians play "Hang On Sloopy" by The McCoys during the middle 
of the 8th inning, bringing with it the Ohio State Buckeyes tradition of 
the fans chanting "O-H-I-O" during the chorus. They also play "Cleveland 
Rocks" at the end of the game for Indians wins.[121] The club nickname 
and its cartoon logo have been criticized for perpetuating Native American 
stereotypes. In 1997 and 1998, protesters were arrested after effigies 
were burned. Charges were dismissed in the 1997 case, and were not filed 
in the 1998 case. Protesters arrested in the 1998 incident subsequently 
fought and lost a lawsuit alleging that their First Amendment rights had 
been violated.[122][123][124][125] Bud Selig (then-Commissioner of Baseball) 
said in 2014 that he had never received a complaint about the logo. He 
has heard that there are some protesting mascots, but individual teams 
such as the Indians and Braves should make their own decisions.[126] Native 
Americans protested Chief Wahoo on Opening Day 2015, as they have for many 
years, making note that this is the 100th anniversary of the team becoming 
the Indians. Owner Paul Dolan, while stating he is respectful of critics, 
says he mainly hears from fans who want to keep Chief Wahoo, and has no 
plans to change.[127] However, some fans have responded to the controversy 
by removing Chief Wahoo logos from purchased apparel, an outcome that is 
being termed "de-chiefing".[128] The Indians' flagship radio stations are 
WTAM AM 1100 and WMMS FM 100.7.[129] The broadcast team consists of longtime 
"Voice of the Tribe" and six-time NSSA Ohio Sportscaster of the Year Tom 
Hamilton and Jim Rosenhaus.[130] The television rights are held by the 
Fox Sports owned SportsTime Ohio (STO), a network launched in 2006 by the 
Indians, and purchased by Fox in 2012. Matt Underwood and former Indians 
Gold Glove winning CF Rick Manning form the announcing team,[130] with 
veteran Cleveland sportscaster Andre Knott as field reporter,[131] and 
Al Pawlowski and former Indians pitcher Jensen Lewis as pregame/postgame 
hosts.[132] Select games are shown on free TV, airing on NBC affiliate 
WKYC channel 3 via simulcast. Notable former Indians broadcasters include 
Tom Manning, Jack Graney (the first ex-baseball player to become a play-by-play 
announcer), Ken Coleman, Joe Castiglione, Van Patrick, Nev Chandler, Bruce 
Drennan, Jim "Mudcat" Grant, Rocky Colavito, Dan Coughlin, and Jim Donovan. 
Previous broadcasters who have had lengthy tenures with the team include 
Joe Tait (15 seasons between TV and radio), Jack Corrigan (18 seasons on 
TV), Ford C. Frick Award winner Jimmy Dudley (19 seasons on radio), Mike 
Hegan (23 seasons between TV and radio), and Herb Score (34 seasons between 
TV and radio).[133] The Indians over the years have been featured in numerous 
movies and television shows. Examples include: Elmer Flick Addie Joss Nap
