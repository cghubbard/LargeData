The St. Louis Cardinals' 1982 season was the team’s 101st season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 91st season in the National League. Making up for 
the previous season’s near-miss, the Cardinals went 92—70 during the season 
and won their first-ever National League East Division title by three games 
over the Philadelphia Phillies. They achieved their first postseason appearance 
since 1968 and defeated the National League West champion Atlanta Braves 
in three straight games to claim the NL pennant. From there, they went 
on to win the World Series in seven games over the American League champion 
Milwaukee Brewers. It was the Cardinals’ first World Championship since 
1967, and their last until they opened the current Busch Stadium in 2006. 
First baseman Keith Hernandez and shortstop Ozzie Smith won Gold Gloves 
this year. [7] Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played;
