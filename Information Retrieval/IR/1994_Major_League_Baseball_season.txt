The 1994 Major League Baseball season ended on August 11, 1994 with the 
1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. It was the first season played under 
the current three-division format in each league. It was also the first 
with an Opening Night game involving two National League teams, which did 
not become permanent until 1996. As a result of a players’ strike, the 
MLB season ended prematurely on August 11, 1994. No postseason (including 
the World Series) was played. Minor League Baseball was not affected.[citation

in compensation in 1994.[1] The following are baseball movies released
