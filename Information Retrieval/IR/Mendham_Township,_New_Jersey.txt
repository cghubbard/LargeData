of northern New Jersey, United States, located more than 30 miles (48 km) 
due west of New York City. As of the 2010 United States Census, the township's

the New Jersey Legislature as one of the state's initial group of 104 townships. 
Portions of the township were taken to create Randolph Township on January 
1, 1806. Mendham Borough became an independent municipality when it was 
formed on May 15, 1906.[21] The township may be named for Mendham, Suffolk, 
England,[22][23] or the name may derive from the Native American word mendom 
(meaning "raspberry") or for an Earl of Mendham.[24][25] According to the

287, County Route 510, Interstate 80, and Interstate 78, are all accessible 
nearby. New Jersey Transit offered service on the MCM4 and MCM5 routes 
until 2010, when subsisdies to the local provider were eliminated as part 
of budget cuts.[91][92] Commuters traveling via public transportation can 
drive to the Morristown station to access New Jersey Transit Midtown Direct 
express train line into Midtown Manhattan. People who were born in, residents
