Timothy Carroll Hurst (June 30, 1865 – June 4, 1915) was an American sports 
official who worked as an umpire and manager in Major League Baseball and 
as a boxing referee in championship fights. His umpiring career lasted 
16 seasons from 1891 to 1909.[1] For one season, in 1898, he became the 
on-field manager of the St. Louis Browns, and the team had a record of 
39–111 in 154 games.[1] After his season of managing the Browns, he returned 
to his umpiring career. From 1891 through 1904 he umpired in the National 
League, then finished his career in the American League.[1] Noted for his 
pugnacious and combative style, Hurst was suspended on several occasions 
for refusing to report player misconduct to his league office, insisting 
instead that he ought to be allowed to settle matters with players personally, 
often engaging them in fights after the game was over. Hurst was among 
the several umpires who were named to a Roll of Honor by the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1946, at a time when no umpires had yet received full membership 
in the Hall. Hurst was born in Ashland, Pennsylvania and died at the age 
of 49 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.[1] He is interred at the Calvary Cemetery
