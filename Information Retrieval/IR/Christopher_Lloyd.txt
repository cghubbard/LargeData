Lloyd was raised in New Canaan, Connecticut.[4] Lloyd began his career 
apprenticing at summer theaters in Mount Kisco, New York, and Hyannis, 
Massachusetts.[7] He took acting classes in New York City at age 19—some 
at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre with Sanford Meisner[4]—and 
he recalled making his New York theater debut in Fernando Arrabal's play 
And They Put Handcuffs on the Flowers, saying, "I was a replacement and 
it was my first sort of job in New York."[4] He made his Broadway debut

Huntington Station, New York, on Long Island.[13] In 1977, he said of his 
training at the Neighborhood Playhouse under Meisner, "My work up to then 
had been very uneven. I would be good one night, dull the next. Meisner 
made me aware of how to be consistent in using the best that I have to 
offer. But I guess nobody can teach you the knack, or whatever it is, that 
helps you come to life on stage."[14] His first movie role was as a psychiatric 
patient in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).[15] He is best known
