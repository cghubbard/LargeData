James Kenneth O'Dea (March 16, 1913 – December 17, 1985) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
as a catcher for the Chicago Cubs (1935–38), New York Giants (1940–41), 
St. Louis Cardinals (1943–46), and Boston Braves (1946). O'Dea had the 
misfortune of playing on the same teams alongside some of the best catchers 
in the National League, which limited his playing time.[2] Although he 
played most of his 12-year MLB career as a backup catcher, O'Dea was considered 
one of the best defensive catchers in the major leagues prior to World 
War II.[2] A native of Lima, New York, O'Dea began his baseball career 
at the age of 18 in 1931 with the Greensboro Patriots of the Piedmont League.[3] 
He produced a .333 batting average while playing for the Keokuk Indians 
in 1932.[2] Although his hitting would taper off, it was his defensive 
abilities as a catcher that made him stand out.[2] He played in the minor 
leagues for four years. O'Dea made his MLB debut with the Chicago Cubs 
on April 21, 1935, at the age of 22.[1][3] O'Dea performed respectably 
for the Cubs, serving as a backup catcher to future Baseball Hall of Fame 
member, Gabby Hartnett.[2] When Hartnett was injured in 1936, O'Dea filled 
in with solid defensive play as well as hitting for a .307 batting average 
in 80 games.[1] In 1937, he hit for a .301 average in 83 games.[1] On December 
6, 1938, the Cubs traded him along with Frank Demaree and Billy Jurges 
to the New York Giants for Dick Bartell, Hank Leiber and catcher Gus Mancuso. 
With the Giants, O'Dea would once again be forced into a substitute role, 
as he backed up four-time All-Star Harry Danning.[2] After three seasons 
with the Giants, he was traded on December 11, 1941 along with Bill Lohrman 
and Johnny McCarthy to the St. Louis Cardinals for Johnny Mize.[4] The 
Cardinals also had an All-Star catcher in Walker Cooper, so O'Dea once 
again found himself in a back up role.[2] When Cooper was inducted into 
the United States Navy in 1945, O'Dea was finally given the opportunity 
to be a starting catcher.[5] He made the most of the opportunity, posting 
career-highs in hits (78), runs (36), runs batted in (43), extra-base hits 
(24), and games played (100).[1] O'Dea's pitch calling skills helped the 
Cardinals pitching staff lead the league in shutouts as the team finished 
the season in second place, three games behind the Chicago Cubs.[6] He 
also led National League catchers in fielding percentage and in base runners 
caught stealing, and finished second to Phil Masi in assists.[7] He might 
have been an All-Star for the first time, but the 1945 game was cancelled 
on April 24 due to strict war-time travel restrictions and no All-Stars 
were named that season. In place of the All-Star Game, seven interleague 
games were played.[8] The Associated Press sportswriters named O'Dea as 
an All-Star, a reserve catcher for the Nation League team. The 33-year-old 
O'Dea was traded to the Boston Braves during the 1946 season to make room 
for young catcher, Joe Garagiola.[2] With the Braves he once more resumed 
the role of a backup catcher behind another All-Star catcher, Phil Masi. 
O'Dea played in his final MLB game on August 6, 1946.[1] In a twelve-year 
MLB career, O'Dea played in 832 games, accumulating 560 hits in 2,195 at 
bats for a .255 career batting average, along with 40 home runs, 323 runs 
batted in and an on-base percentage of .338.[1] He ended his career with 
a .983 fielding percentage, which was 4 points higher than the league average 
during his playing career.[1] O'Dea appeared in five World Series (1935, 
1938, 1942, 1943, 1944), batting .462 (6-for-13) with one home run in post-season 
play.[9] He was also valuable as a left-handed pinch hitter, leading the 
National League with 42 pinch-hitting appearances in 1942.[2] Over the 
span of five World Series appearances, he set a since-broken record of 
three pinch hits in series competitions.[10] O'Dea died on December 17,
