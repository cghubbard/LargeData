Joseph Gregg (Jo-Jo) Moore, Sr. (December 25, 1908 – April 1, 2001) was 
a left fielder in Major League Baseball who played his entire career with 
the New York Giants from 1930 through 1941. Moore batted left-handed and 
threw right-handed. He was born in Gause, Texas and nicknamed the "Gause 
Ghost." He was 5' 11" and weighed 155 pounds. Moore was an intimidating, 
left-handed-hitting leadoff man, a line-drive hitter who hit over .300 
five times in his major league career and led the National League in at-bats 
in 1935. The free-swinging Moore never struck out more than 37 times in 
a season, collecting only 247 SO in 5427 at-bats (4.6%). In 1932, Moore 
enjoyed a 20-game hitting-streak despite appearing in just 86 games. His 
most productive season came in 1934, when he collected a career-high .331 
batting average with 106 runs, 192 hits, 15 home runs and 37 doubles. A 
year later he fell to .295, but collected 201 hits with 108 runs, nine 
triples and 71 RBI, all career numbers, while adding 15 home runs. During 
the next three seasons Moore hit .316, .310 and .302, with a career-high 
205 hits in 1936. Underrated because he was overshadowed by more colorful 
teammates, Moore was a fixture for the Giants in left field. He appeared 
in three World Series (1933, 1936–37), and six times was named to the National 
League All-Star team (1934–38 and 1940). In the 1933 Series Moore had two 
hits in one inning, and in the 1937 Series he tied a record of the time 
by collecting nine hits in a five-game series. In a 12-season career, Moore 
was a .298 hitter with 79 home runs and 513 RBI in 1335 games. In 16 World 
Series games, he hit .274 with one home run and three RBI. After the 1941 
season, Moore was sold to the Cincinnati Reds. He played full-time in the 
1942 and 1943 seasons for the Indianapolis Indians of the Minor League 
Baseball American Association. After his baseball career, he returned to 
Gause, Texas and raised cattle. Moore died in his hometown of Gause at
