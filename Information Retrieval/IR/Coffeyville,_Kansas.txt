Coffeyville is a city in southeastern Montgomery County, Kansas, United 
States, located along the Verdigris River in the state's southeastern region.[1] 
As of the 2010 census, the city population was 10,295.[6] It is the most 
populous city of Montgomery County and with its southeast Kansas location 
is located in the Tulsa, Oklahoma media market. The town of South Coffeyville, 
Oklahoma is located approximately 1 mile south of the city, existing as 
a separate political entity immediately south of the state line. This settlement 
was founded in 1869 as an Indian trading post by Col. James A. Coffey, 
serving the population across the border in what was then the Indian Territory. 
The town was stimulated in 1871 by being made a stop on the Leavenworth, 
Lawrence & Galveston Railroad, which connected it to other markets and 
developments. With the arrival of the railroad, a young surveyor, Napoleon 
B. Blanton, was dispatched to lay out the town. The naming of the town 
was left to the toss of a coin between Col. Coffey and U.S. Army Captain 
Blanton. Coffey won the toss and the town was officially named Coffeyville.[citation 
needed] The city was first incorporated in 1872, but the charter was voided 
as illegal, and the city was re-incorporated in March 1873.[2][7] As a 
frontier settlement, Coffeyville had its share of violence. On October 
5, 1892, four of the Dalton Gang were killed in a shootout during an attempted 
bank robbery; Emmett Dalton survived with 23 gunshot wounds and convicted 
at trial for his crimes. He served 14 years before being pardoned. The 
gang had been trying to rob the First National and Condon banks, located 
across the street from each other. Residents recognized them under their 
disguises of fake beards and attacked the gang members as they fled one 
of the banks. Four citizens, including a U.S. marshal, Marshal Charles 
T. Connelly, died defending the town. The town holds an annual celebration 
each October to commemorate the Dalton Raid and the citizens who were lost.[citation

abundant clay, Coffeyville enjoyed rapid growth from 1890 to 1910, as its 
population expanded sixfold. From the turn of the 20th century to the 1930s, 
it was one of the largest glass and brick manufacturing centers in the 
nation. During this same period, the development of oil production attracted 
the founding of several oil field equipment manufacturers, and more workers 
and residents.[7] Coffeyville industrialist Douglas Brown founded Coffeyville 
Multiscope, which produced components of the Norden bombsight. This played 
a determining role in the perfection of precision daylight bombing during 
World War II as a result of the bombsight's advanced accuracy and drift 
correction capability.[citation needed] In 1930 residents in Coffeyville 
organized a Church of Latter Day Saints (LDS) Sunday School; it was one 
of only 11 places in Kansas to have such a facility then.[8] On July 1, 
2007, Coffeyville suffered a major flood when the Verdigris River crested 
at 10 feet above flood stage and flooded approximately a third of the city. 
The flood topped the local refinery (Coffeyville Resources LLC) levees 
by 4 feet, allowing oil to pollute the water. Approximately 1700 barrels 
(71,000 gallons) of crude oil mingled with the already contaminated flood 
waters.[9] The EPA worked to prevent the oil and flood water mix from continuing 
downriver, where it could damage the water in Oologah Lake near Oologah, 
Oklahoma. Many residential water supplies are drawn from that lake. A minimal 
amount of oil reached Oolagah Lake, and it did not pose a threat to the 
water supplies of other cities along the Verdigris River or from the lake. 
A number of animals were found dead or injured in flood areas, covered 
with oil. By July 2, areas east of Patterson Street were off limits, and 
a curfew was enacted in other areas of the city. On July 3, the city lost 
its supply of potable water, but the water service was restored and the 
order to boil water rescinded on July 7. The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) and the Red Cross came to aid residents, and Kansas Governor 
Kathleen Sebelius and President George W. Bush declared the city a federal 
disaster area. Most displaced residents found shelter with family and friends, 
but many were sheltered in two area churches and a senior citizens' apartment 
complex. Some pets were rescued to a temporary animal shelter built for 
them at LeClere Park. The flooded area on the city's east side was reopened 
on July 11 for residents and business owners to begin assessing damage 
and to retrieve salvageable items.[citation needed] In order to focus on 
the post-flood recovery and clean-up, the city and state cancelled the 
2007 Inter-State Fair & Rodeo.[10] The ongoing flood recovery included 
a wholesale environmental remediation of the flood-affected eastern portion 
of the city, which continued through late 2008 to early 2009. Many of the 
flood-damaged homes were purchased by Coffeyville Resources LLC as a part 
of its effort to compensate the homeowners affected by the oil spill.[11] 
Coffeyville is located in the southeast corner of Kansas, about 75 miles 
(121 km) north of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and 60 miles (97 km) west of Joplin, 
Missouri. The city is situated about one-half mile north of the Oklahoma 
state line at 37°2′16″N 95°37′35″W﻿ / ﻿37.03778°N 95.62639°W﻿ / 37.03778; 
-95.62639 (37.037708, -95.626438),[1] along the west bank of the Verdigris 
River. The city is the location of the lowest point in the state of Kansas 
at 679 feet (207 m) above sea level. Coffeyville Municipal Airport is a 
few miles northeast of the city along US-169. Though Coffeyville is the 
largest city in Montgomery County, the county seat is Independence, 16 
miles (26 km) northwest of the city. Coffeyville, specifically a spot just 
north of Coffeyville Country Club, is the default center starting point 
of Google Maps, being the accidental center point of the default starting 
map being displayed, which shows the 48 contiguous United States.[12] (Lawrence, 
Kansas also claims to be the Google center). Other locations that are considered 
to be the geographic center of the contiguous United States are also in 
Kansas. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total 
area of 7.43 square miles (19.24 km2), all land.[3] Coffeyville has experienced 
a slow and steady population decline since around 1960, when its population 
peaked at more than 17,000. Changes in industry and oil production have 
caused a loss of jobs in the area, and residents have moved to find work.

history as a center of industry and manufacturing.[citation needed] Coffeyville 
Resources operates a 100,000 barrels per day refinery and a large nitrogen 
fertilizer plant, using a unique Texaco process of ammonia extraction from 
coke byproducts produced in the refinery. Sherwin Williams Chemical Co. 
has operated a chemical plant in the community since 1909.[citation needed] 
Coffeyville is also home to John Deere Corporation's Coffeyville Works, 
which is a major manufacturer of off-road equipment automatic transmissions 
for the construction, agriculture and mining industries.[citation needed] 
Acme Foundry is a foundry that has been in operation since 1905 and employs 
more than 300 people.[17] Taylor Crane & Rigging is a regional hauling 
operation, full-service industrial mover and craning services company. 
Taylor also maintains a facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma[18] Other nearby in-county 
employers include Cessna Aircraft Division of Textron and Spears Manufacturing, 
a large producer of extruded PVC pipe products.[citation needed] Southwire 
Corp is a maker of stranded and solid core wire and acquired the Leviton 
Industries facility of American Insulated Wire in 2010. The plant was closed 
in 2014.[citation needed] Coffeyville is home to a fulfillment center leased 
since 1999 by online retailer Amazon.com.[19] It was opened in a facility 
previously operated by Golden Books.[citation needed] After more than a 
decade of operations here, Amazon announced that it would close this warehouse 
in February 2015, because it was shifting to warehouses located closer 
to large cities.[20][21] Public education is provided by the Coffeyville 
School District (USD 445). The district educates almost 2,000 students 
in three facilities.[22] The district has one early learning center, one 
large consolidated elementary school with four pods and an Age-to-Age kindergarten, 
one middle school and one high school. Five-year-old kindergarten children 
spend their days learning beside community members who have 80, 90, and 
even 100 years of life skills and experiences. Now, as we end our seventh 
year of intergenerational learning, it is evident that both age groups 
benefit from what the other generation has to offer. The needs of the elderly 
are met through reasons most people understand: the children offer them 
purpose and fill their days with energy and productive activities. The 
children’s needs are met at a different but equal level. The grandmas and 
grandpas have time to listen to their stories about family and pets and 
about what makes them happy and what scares them. Age-to-Age Kindergarten 
offers a unique experience for students on a daily basis. Age-to-Age days 
are spent with intergenerational exercise, small group table times, individual 
sign-in times with a grandma, one-on-one reading, and regular social studies 
and science experiences. This is in partnership with Windsor Place. Advanced 
education is provided by Coffeyville Community College at three campuses. 
The main campus and technical trades campus are each located in Coffeyville, 
while a third campus is located in Columbus, Kansas. Four-year college 
degrees are offered by Oklahoma Wesleyan University, Friends University 
and Sterling College at the main Coffeyville Community College campus.[24] 
Coffeyville Community College has a long history of academic and athletic 
success.[citation needed] Bus service is provided northward towards Kansas 
City, Missouri and southward towards Tulsa, Oklahoma by Jefferson Lines 
(subcontractor of Greyhound Lines).[25][26] Coffeyville and surrounding 
communities are also served by Connections Transportation which has its 
headquarters in nearby Independence, Kansas. Coffeyville has two railroads 
that serve the community, Union Pacific and a short line railroad SKO and 
WATCO. Coffeyville is served by two US highways, US 166 which runs east-west 
from where the highway enters from the east at the Verdigris River bridge 
on Northeast Street to Eleventh Street, and exits to the west at the Union 
Pacific Railroad viaduct on Eighth Street. US 169 which is a north-south 
highway, enters from the east at the Verdigris River bridge on Northeast
