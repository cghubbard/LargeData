Benjamin Ambrosio Oglivie Palmer (born February 11, 1949) is a former Major 
League Baseball left fielder for the Boston Red Sox (1971–1973), Detroit 
Tigers (1974–1977), and the Milwaukee Brewers (1978–1986). He also played 
two seasons in Japan for the Kintetsu Buffaloes (1987–1988). He batted 
and threw left-handed. Oglivie debuted on September 4, 1971 for the Red 
Sox and played his final game on October 5, 1986 for the Brewers. Oglivie 
hit for power fairly well, breaking the 40-home run mark in 1980 with 41, 
which was good for a tie (with Reggie Jackson) for the league lead. Oglivie 
hit 3 home runs in a game, three times. In the process, Oglivie became 
the first non-U.S. born player to lead the American League in home runs. 
In a 16-year career, he posted a .273 batting average with 235 home runs 
and 901 RBIs in 1754 games. He had 87 career stolen bases and 784 runs 
scored. Oglivie picked up 1615 hits in 5913 at bats. Oglivie played for 
the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Japan after retiring from MLB and hit 46 home 
runs in two seasons. He then returned to attempt a comeback in the minors, 
but never made it back to the majors again. Oglivie begins his third year 
in the Tampa Bay Rays system as a coach. He will act as the hitting coach
