The Portland Beavers was the name of separate minor league baseball teams, 
which represented Portland, Oregon, in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). 
The team was established in 1903, the first year of the PCL. The most recent 
form of the Beavers left after the 2010 season and are now in west Texas 
as the El Paso Chihuahuas. Many baseball teams have been known as the Portland 
Beavers; the most recent club, which began operating in 2001, recognized 
the history of all previous incarnations as its own, stating it was established 
in 1903, the same year the Pacific Coast League was established. The actual 
team name, the Beavers, originated in 1906 following a newspaper contest 
to rename the existing Portland team that was created in 1901 when the 
Portland Baseball Club was started by a group of Portland businessmen. 
Along with the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Oaks, Sacramento Solons, San 
Francisco Seals, and Seattle Rainiers, a Portland Beavers club was a charter 
member of the Pacific Coast League in 1903. Along with Sacramento, Portland 
was one of two charter cities that had a team in the PCL (as of the 2010 
season), the other cities having been taken over by Major League Baseball 
franchises. Following the 2010 season, the Beavers were placed for sale 
and relocation because of the lack of a suitable stadium in Portland, as 
PGE Park was being remodeled into a soccer-only configuration for the MLS's 
2011 expansion Portland Timbers. In 2010, the Beavers were sold to Jeff 
Moorad, owner of the San Diego Padres.[1] The team temporarily moved to 
southern Arizona and became the Tucson Padres while waiting for a new stadium 
to be built for them in their planned future home of Escondido, California, 
north of San Diego.[2] In 2012, the PCL gave preliminary approval to MountainStar 
Sports Group on July 30 to buy the Tucson Padres with the intent to relocate 
the franchise to west Texas in El Paso for the 2014 season after financing 
in Escondido did not materialize. On December 10, 1902, Henry Harris, the 
owner of the California League's San Francisco team announced that the 
Pacific Northwest League team from Portland, the Portland Webfoots, and 
a new team from Seattle were joining with the California League to create 
the Pacific Coast League (PCL).[3] Before the Portland franchise joined 
the PCL, the president of the Pacific Northwest League, Henry Lucas, was 
adamant in keeping the Portland franchise in his league.[4] A team in the 
Pacific Northwest League was formed called the Portland Green Gages, which 
folded early in its first season. When the Portland PCL team first started 
playing, they were known as the Portland Browns. In their first season, 
classified as an independent league, the PCL featured six teams including 
the Browns.[5] The Browns finished their first season fifth in the PCL.[3] 
During the 1904 season, the Browns finished with a record of 79–136.[3] 
The 136 losses still stands as a record in the PCL for most losses by a 
team in a single season.[3] Other records for that season include the most 
errors in a season (669), and the lowest single-season team fielding percentage 
(.929).[3] Before the 1905 season, professional baseball player Walt McCredie 
and former Republican U.S. House member from Washington Judge William Wallace 
McCredie purchased the Portland franchise.[3] The team was then renamed 
the Portland Giants and Walter McCredie was named the player-manager of 
the team.[3] During the 1905 season, the PCL was re-classified as a Class-A 
league in minor league baseball.[6] In 1906, the team was renamed the Portland 
Beavers after a newspaper contest was started to decide the new name of 
the team.[3] That season, the Portland team won its first pennant in the 
PCL.[3] Beavers player Mike Mitchell led the PCL in home runs with six, 
the fewest ever to lead the PCL. Mitchell also led the league in batting 
average.[3] The Beavers finished last in 1907, and second in 1908 and 1909. 
In 1910, Portland won another pennant behind the pitching of Vean Gregg 
and Gene Krapp. Gregg finished the season with a 32–18 record and 14 shutouts 
while Krapp had a 29–16 record for the season. Portland repeated as PCL 
champs in 1911 fielding four 20-game-winning pitchers. In 1912, Judge McCredie 
helped get a new 12,000-seat grandstand built at Vaughn Street Park. His 
obituary later read that the ballpark was "the sensation of baseball, because 
it inaugurated a minor league precedent of providing individual grandstand 
seats, which fellow magnates called an extravagance and a dangerous innovation." 
The NAPBL made a change to league classifications in 1912, making Double-A 
the top tier. The PCL, and the Portland Beavers, moved into this new classification 
from the previous top tier Class A league. During the 1910s, the Beavers 
developed some working relationships with other teams. From 1911 to 1914 
the Portland Beavers had their own farm team which played in the Northwest 
League (renamed the Pacific Coast International League in 1918). The Class 
B team shared the use of Vaughn Street Park and was known as the Portland 
Pippins in 1911, but changed their name to the Portland Colts in 1912. 
During the 1914 season, the Colts moved to the Seattle area and finished 
their last season as the Ballard Pippins before folding. Portland also 
had an informal relationship with the Cleveland Indians through much of 
the 1910s that saw many future major league stars come through Portland 
to fine-tune their skills. Portland played well in 1913 and 1914, winning 
the pennant both seasons. Though the 1915 Beavers featured future Hall 
of Famer Stan Coveleski, the team didn't fare too well, and started into 
a tailspin that would last for over a decade. The year also marked the 
end of their relationship with the Cleveland Indians. With America's entry 
into World War I, restrictions were placed on travel, such that the Beavers 
withdrew from the PCL for the 1918 season, playing instead in the Class 
B Pacific Coast International League. The team was known as the Portland 
Buckaroos and finished their shortened season (play was stopped on July 
7 due to the war) in second place 1½ games back of Seattle. Ironically, 
the PCL ceased play just a week later as they too were unable to continue 
play due to restrictions on travel. Due to the Beavers' withdrawal from 
the PCL, the league offered Sacramento, California a franchise to replace 
the Portland team, while the McCredies continued to own the baseball club 
in Portland. The new team in Sacramento was known as the Sacramento Senators, 
and could be considered a continuation of the original Portland Baseball 
Club. With the McCredies still at the helm, Portland was offered an expansion 
franchise and re-entered the PCL in 1919. The team finished in seventh 
place, only ahead of last-place Seattle who was also an expansion team 
that year. Portland finished in last place in 1920 and again in 1921. After 
the 1921 season, the McCredies sold the team to Walter Klepper who had 
been president of the Seattle team. Klepper brought in Jim Thorpe who played 
with the Beavers in 1922, paying him a then-unheard of minor league salary 
of US$1,000 per month. It wasn't long before Klepper was in the middle 
of a dispute with Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Klepper 
had brought Seattle player-manager Bill Kenworthy down to manage the Beavers, 
only Seattle claimed Kenworthy was still under contract and that Klepper 
had tampered in the matter. Landis suspended Klepper until January 1, 1925, 
and declared Kenworthy ineligible to play or manage Portland until 1924.[7] 
According to The Portland Beavers, a book by Kip Carlson and Paul Andresen, 
"The feisty Klepper went to court and had the decision overturned, supposedly 
the only time that Landis ever had a ruling reversed." Kenworthy did manage 
the Beavers in 1924, replacing popular player-manager Jim Middleton. He 
was fired mid-season, though, as he was not able to generate support from 
the players.[7] The 1924 season was also noteworthy in that future Hall 
of Famer Mickey Cochrane played on the team. After 1924, the Beavers officially 
became a farm team for a major league team for the first time when Philadelphia 
Athletics owners John and Tom Shibe purchased the Beavers as well as Vaughn 
Street Park. Despite having Duffy Lewis on the team in 1925 (winning the 
PCL batting title), Elmer Smith in 1926 and 1927 (leading the PCL in home 
runs in 1926 and all of minor league baseball in home runs in 1927), and 
Ike Boone in 1928, the Beavers continued to finish in the bottom half of 
the league. Longtime head groundskeeper Rocky Benevento started working 
for the Beavers in 1927. Benevento was so popular with the fans that they 
took up a collection for him in 1956 to send him to the World Series. Benevento 
retired at the end of the 1966 season and was given a new car. When Benevento 
died in 1969, The Oregonian stated, "He adored kids...he loved baseball...and 
most of all he loved people." His funeral had an overflowing crowd that 
included Oregon Governor Tom McCall. Benevento stayed with the team 40 
years, spanning 30 managerial changes and five ownership changes. While 
the former location of Vaughn Street Park is now a parking lot, there is 
a plaque honoring Benevento for his efforts in furthering baseball in Portland. 
In 1929, the Beavers changed their name to the Portland Ducks, bearing 
a duck on their uniform, and were also occasionally known that year as 
the Portland Rosebuds. The name change didn't change the team's luck as 
they finished with a 90–112 record. Long–time radio broadcaster Rollie 
Truitt also joined the Beavers staff in 1929, and worked for the team for 
35 years, spanning 28 managerial changes and five ownership changes. Truitt 
would later be known as the "Dean of Pacific Coast League broadcasters." 
In 1930, the team reverted to the Beavers name, but would occasionally 
be referred to as the Ducks for over a decade. The highlight of the Beavers 
last place 1930 season was William Rhiel's unassisted triple play, the 
last recorded in PCL history. In 1931, team President Tom Turner bought 
the franchise from the Shibe brothers and the team took a turn for the 
positive. Ed Coleman led the PCL in hits and runs batted in, and the team 
finished in third, winning 100 games. The team continued to improve in 
1932, winning Portland its first pennant since 1914. The team finished 
second in 1933. Turner brought Walter McCredie back to manager the team 
in 1934, but he died early in the season and the team fell to the bottom 
half of the league. Following the 1934 season, E.J. Shefter bought the 
team from Turner. The team improved in 1935, finishing one game over .500, 
and then won the pennant in 1936, finishing 1½ games over runner-up Oakland, 
then winning the postseason series to capture the crown. In 1937, the Beavers 
finished in fourth place, but made it to the playoffs defeating San Francisco 
in the first round before losing to the San Diego team featuring a young 
Ted Williams. The team finished sixth in 1938 before finishing in last 
place in 1939–1942. The 1940 team was so bad, finishing 56–122, that they 
were still 25 games behind the seventh-place team (the league had eight 
teams at that time). In 1943, William Klepper, with partner George Norgan 
buying a minority share, purchased the Beavers. The team came back that 
season with their first winning record since 1937. The management of the 
team began referring to the team as the "Lucky Beavers" and Vaughn Street 
Park was known as "Lucky Beaver Stadium." With the United States firmly 
involved in World War II, local radio station KXL sold over $300,000 in 
war bonds in 1943 to fund the building of a bomber for the war that would 
be dubbed "The Lucky Beaver." Due to U.S. involvement in the war, the available 
pool of baseball players in the nation was ravaged. Somehow, the Beavers 
still moved up in the league, finishing second in 1944. In 1945 the Beavers 
brought another pennant to Portland being skippered by player-manager Marv 
Owen. Despite winning the pennant, the team lost to San Francisco in the 
first round of the playoffs. To commemorate Portland's 1945 pennant win, 
Portland held a banquet at the Multnomah Hotel (now the downtown Portland 
Embassy Suites). Oregon Governor Earl Snell presented a commemorative watch 
and gold and diamond ring to each player at the banquet. The watches were 
given to the players due to L. H. Gregory of The Oregonian requesting fans 
to donate money to a fund for the purpose. Gregory did this because he 
felt it was not right that no memento was given to the players from the 
1936 championship team. Following the 1945 season, Norgan purchased Klepper's 
share of the team becoming the team's new owner. In 1946, the Beavers fell 
to the bottom half of the league, finishing in seventh place, 41 games 
out of first. In 1947 Eddie Basinski joined the Beavers, and they finished 
third, losing to the Los Angeles Angels in the first round of the playoffs. 
The team drew, up to then, a team record of 421,000 fans that season. This 
record would stand for the Beavers until the 2001 season when Triple-A 
Baseball returned to Portland. In 1948, the team finish fifth, followed 
by a sixth-place finish in 1949. The 1949 season began the integration 
of the Pacific Coast League as Frankie Austin and Luis Marquez became Beavers. 
Beginning with the 1950 season, the Beavers finished fourth for four straight 
years. Clay Hopper, who had been Jackie Robinson's manager when he played 
for the Montreal Royals in 1946, was named the team's manager in 1952. 
This year also marked the first year the Pacific Coast League was classified 
by the NAPBL as an "open league." The open league was a step above Triple-A, 
and was an attempt by the Pacific Coast League to be considered the third 
major league. Plans for a new ballpark were announced by the team in 1953. 
Originally the team planned to build a new stadium at 82nd and Holgate 
in Southeast Portland. Due to the Korean War, among other issues, the stadium 
never came to fruition. In 1954 the team dropped again to the bottom of 
the league. After the 1954 season the team went up for sale to the community 
via public stock, which resulted in 2,400 new owners for the 1955 season. 
With the change the Beavers rose to fifth place, only nine games back of 
first. In 1956, the Beavers left the now-demolished Vaughn Street Park 
to move into 25,000-seat Multnomah Stadium, today's Providence Park. Throughout 
most of the 1960s, the Beavers were the Triple-A affiliate of the American 
League Cleveland Indians, nurturing such future stars as "Sudden" Sam McDowell, 
Lou "Mad Dog" Piniella, and Luis "El Gigante" Tiant. Later major league 
affiliations included the Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Phillies. In 
1961, the Beavers signed the 56-year-old Satchel Paige. He pitched 25 innings 
for the Beavers, striking out 19 and giving up 18 earned runs without recording 
a decision. Following the 1972 season, principal owner Bill Cutler moved 
the team northeast to Spokane, who had lost their PCL team to Albuquerque 
after the 1971 season. For the next five seasons, Portland was in the short-season 
Class A Northwest League (NWL) with the independent and non-conforming 
Portland Mavericks, owned by actor Bing Russell. The PCL expanded in 1978 
and added a new team in Portland, calling themselves the Beavers, displacing 
the single-A Mavericks. The new Beavers played in Civic Stadium for sixteen 
seasons through 1993. In 1983, the Beavers won the PCL pennant, the first 
for Portland in 47 years. Though tied for third overall during the regular 
season,[8] the Beavers won the second half division title by four games,[9] 
defeated first-half winner Edmonton Trappers in four games (3–1) to take 
the Northern Division title,[10] then swept the three-time defending champion 
Albuquerque Dukes in three games in the finals to capture the league championship.[11][12] 
As PCL champs in 1983, the Beavers participated in the first Triple-A World 
Series, a three-team round-robin competition in Louisville with the champions 
of the International League and the American Association.[13] Each team 
played the others twice and it was won by the Tidewater Tides of the IL 
with three wins. Portland was second, splitting with both teams, and the 
Denver Bears were 1–3.[14] A decade later, Beavers owner Joe Buzas moved 
the team after the 1993 season east to Salt Lake City,[15] where they became 
the Salt Lake Buzz in 1994 in a brand new ballpark. The team was renamed 
the Stingers in 2001, and have been the Bees since the 2006 season. Portland 
was without a team in 1994, and the Class A Rockies of the Northwest League 
relocated from Bend in 1995.[16] The Portland Rockies played in the Rose 
City for the next six seasons and served an important role for the city, 
whose demand for a major league team was growing. They were league champions 
in 1997 and Portland's support for the Rockies paved the way for the return 
of the Triple-A PCL in 2001.[17] Following the 2000 season, the Los Angeles 
Dodgers and San Diego Padres swapped Triple-A affiliates. The Albuquerque 
Dukes (a charter franchise of the PCL in 1903 as the Los Angeles Angels, 
later the Spokane Indians (1958–71)) moved to Portland and became the Beavers, 
as the Padres' top affiliate. As part of the relocation agreement, Civic 
Stadium was renovated in 2000 and renamed PGE Park. The Dodgers now had 
the Las Vegas Stars (the 1919–72 Beavers), who were renamed the 51s for 
2001. The single-A Portland Rockies moved up the Columbia River to Pasco 
and became the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2001. In 2007, owner Merritt Paulson 
announced that he was considering changing the name of the team to prevent 
confusion with the Oregon State University teams from Corvallis.[18] Possible 
new names and logos were unveiled, and a vote was staged on the team website. 
"Portland Beavers" won the contest,[19] and the team unveiled new logos 
and colors on January 29, 2008.[20] The Beavers emphasized their connection 
to the three prior franchises with the notation "Est. 1903" on their primary 
logo. The team also brought back the name "Lucky Beavers" as part of a 
sleeve patch on their alternate jersey. In 2009, the city of Portland was 
awarded a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise for 2011, to be 
named the Portland Timbers.[21] The Portland City Council approved a $31 
million agreement to renovate PGE Park to a soccer- and football-only stadium, 
with the condition that a new ballpark be built in Portland for the Beavers 
by 2011.[22] Initial plans called for the new ballpark to be built at the 
site currently occupied by the Memorial Coliseum, which would have been 
torn down,[23] but public outcry about demolishing a Portland landmark 
led Portland mayor Sam Adams to propose a second site in the Rose Quarter 
area north of Memorial Coliseum. The site, however, proved to be too small.[24] 
Another location in the Lents neighborhood in southeast Portland was also 
rejected due to objections from neighbors.[25] In June 2009, the Portland 
City Council voted to separate the soccer and baseball projects, allowing 
renovation of PGE Park to proceed without completed plans for a baseball 
stadium in place.[26] Other locations in the Portland area were considered 
for the ballpark, including a vacant terminal at the Port of Portland, 
Delta Park, the Portland Expo Center, Portland Meadows, the Westwood Corporation 
Heliport site, a building owned by Portland Public Schools near the Rose 
Quarter, and suburban locations in Beaverton, Clackamas, and Vancouver, 
Washington.[25][27][28][29] None of these sites progressed past initial 
discussions. With no suitable Portland location available, in July 2010, 
Paulson announced that he was putting the team up for sale and relocation.[30] 
Padres owner Jeff Moorad formed a group to buy the team and talked of moving 
its home games to the Lake Elsinore Diamond in Lake Elsinore, California 
until a new stadium in Escondido could be built.[31] Eventually, the group 
decided to move the team temporarily to Tucson in 2011, rename them the 
Tucson Padres, with plans to move again to Escondido when a new ballpark 
was built.[32] The plans in Escondido failed, and the team was sold again; 
they moved to west Texas prior to the 2014 season and became the El Paso 
Chihuahuas.[33] The Portland area was without minor league baseball in 
2011 and 2012. After the 2012 season, the NWL Yakima Bears relocated to 
a new 4,500-seat stadium in the northwest suburb of Hillsboro and became 
the Hillsboro Hops. The Hops won the NWL title in 2015 and averaged over 
3,700 in attendance for 38 regular season home games.[34] Notes Sources
