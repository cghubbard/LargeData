South Williamsport is a borough in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania, United 
States. It is famous for hosting the Little League World Series. The population 
was 6,412 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Williamsport, Pennsylvania 
Metropolitan Statistical Area. South Williamsport celebrated the centennial 
of its incorporation as a borough in 1986. On November 29, 1886, the Lycoming 
County court incorporated the villages of Rocktown, Billman, and vicinities 
as the borough of South Williamsport. The land had previously been part 
of Armstrong Township. The first recorded inhabitants of the Susquehanna 
River valley were the Iroquoian speaking Susquehannocks. Their name meant 
"people of the muddy river" in Algonquian. Decimated by diseases and warfare, 
they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes by 
the early 18th century. The lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River 
valley were then chiefly occupied by the Munsee clan or phratry of the 
Lenape, and were under the nominal control of the Five (later Six) Nations 
of the Iroquois. The British purchased land from the Iroquois in the Treaty 
of Fort Stanwix of 1768, opening what is now Lycoming County to settlement. 
After the American Revolutionary War, Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland 
County, on April 13, 1795. The county's area was originally over 12,000 
square miles (31,000 km2) and several other counties were subsequently 
formed from it. Williamsport, across the river from South Williamsport, 
was also founded in 1795 and chosen as the county seat. The first settler 
in what is now South Williamsport is believed to have been Aaron Hagerman, 
a transplanted Hollander, who is thought to have arrived shortly after 
the end of the American Revolutionary War. Hagermans Run, which flows through 
the borough, bears his name. One of the predecessor communities was "Rocktown". 
And another was Bootstown. One of the first businesses was a tavern established 
near the mouth of Hagermans Run by Michael McDonough. Another early entrepreneur, 
Jacob Weiss, gave the village a push toward borough status by purchasing 
a tract of 40 acres and laying out town lots. Weiss also established a 
brickyard near McDonough’s tavern and for many years operated an oil mill 
and a gristmill. From those early times to the present, South Williamsport’s 
fortunes have been linked to those of Williamsport. Sawmills and furniture 
factories were among the most prosperous industries in both communities. 
Planing mills and woodworking factories of all types reached a peak of 
activity during the logging boom of the post-Civil War years of the last 
century. The industry gradually declined in the 1890s when the surrounding 
hills were finally stripped of saleable lumber and the logging crews moved 
west.[3] Today, manufacturing diversity is the rule. The area is reforested 
with second-growth timber, providing scenic beauty as well as woodland 
recreational opportunities. In South Williamsport, prime employers include: 
Little League Baseball, Inc., Keystone Friction Hinge, South Williamsport 
Area School District and the New Lycoming Bakery. Although Bald Eagle Mountain 
to the south and the river on the north have restricted development in 
South Williamsport, growth has been steady. In 1890, there were 2,900 residents. 
About 600 young scholars attended 10 borough schools. The 2000 census counted 
6,412 residents and today, 1,534 students are enrolled in three South Williamsport 
Area Schools Central Elementary (K-4) is on West Mountain Ave. Rommelt 
Elementary (5-6) is on West Central Ave. South Williamsport Area Jr./Sr. 
High School, Home of the Mountaineers, is on Percy Street. The School District 
is also home to one of the oldest high school football stadiums in the 
state, Rodney K. Morgans Stadium, which is built into the hillside directly 
between Central and Rommelt Elementary Schools. South Williamsport is located
