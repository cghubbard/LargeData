As Player As Manager Joel Patrick Skinner (born February 21, 1961) is a 
retired Major League Baseball catcher and former manager of the Charlotte 
Knights, the Class AAA affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. He is the son 
of Bob Skinner, a National League outfielder in the 1950s and 1960s. At 
Mission Bay High School in San Diego, Joel Skinner played baseball and 
water polo. He was drafted immediately following his senior year and was 
the first player taken in the free-agent compensation draft. Originally 
drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, Skinner was traded to the Chicago White 
Sox in 1983. After brief call-ups to the majors over the next three years, 
Skinner was slated to start 1986 with the White Sox. New general manager 
Hawk Harrelson had taken a liking to Skinner, and decided to make him the 
starting catcher in place of Carlton Fisk. This made some sense on paper; 
Fisk was 38 years old, and conventional wisdom then as now suggests that 
catchers at that age don't have many years left. Harrelson wanted to have 
Fisk's successor in place when Fisk retired. To ease the transition, Fisk 
was moved to left field. The move backfired when Skinner batted only .171 
in April. On May 10, Fisk became the regular catcher, and Skinner only 
made 25 more starts behind the plate before being traded to the New York 
Yankees on July 30.[1] Skinner's career never really recovered after that. 
He bounced between the majors and minors with the Yankees and Cleveland 
Indians until his retirement in 1994. Skinner spent six seasons managing 
in the Indians minor league system from 1995–2000. In those seasons he 
compiled a record of 448–333 (.574) and took his team to the playoffs in 
five of six seasons. Skinner was named to the coaching staff of the Cleveland 
Indians on November 10, 2000, succeeding Jim Riggleman as third base coach. 
He was named interim manager of the Tribe on July 11, 2002 after Charlie 
Manuel was let go in a contract dispute. At the time, Skinner was the youngest 
manager in the major leagues, at age 41. He skippered the team to a 35–41 
record to finish the season, including a 15–13 record in September. Skinner's 
name was mentioned among candidates to the permanent manager's job, but 
Eric Wedge was chosen instead. Skinner remained on the Indians' coaching 
staff until Manny Acta was hired in 2009. On October 20, 2010, Skinner 
was hired as the Oakland Athletics bench coach for the 2011 season replacing 
Tye Waller. On November 14, 2011, Skinner was hired as the manager of the
