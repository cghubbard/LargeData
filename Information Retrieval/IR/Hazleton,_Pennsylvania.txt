Hazleton is a city in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. The 
population was 25,340 at the 2010 census. Hazleton is the 17th largest 
city in Pennsylvania.[1] During the height of the American Revolution in 
the summer of 1780, British sympathizers, known as Tories, concentrated 
from New York's Mohawk Valley, began attacking the outposts of American 
revolutionaries located along the Susquehanna River Valley in Northeast 
Pennsylvania. Because of the reports of Tory activity in the region, Captain 
Daniel Klader and a platoon of 41 men from Northampton County were sent 
to investigate. They traveled north from the Lehigh Valley along a path 
known as "Warrior's Trail", which is present-day State Route 93, since 
this route connects the Lehigh River in Jim Thorpe (formerly known as Mauch 
Chunk) to the Susquehanna River in Berwick. Heading north, Captain Klader's 
men made it as far north as present-day Conyngham when they were ambushed 
by members of the Seneca tribe and Tory militiamen. In all, 15 men were 
killed on September 11, 1780 in what was known the Sugarloaf Massacre. 
The Moravians, a Christian denomination, had been using "Warrior's Trail" 
since the early 18th century after the Moravian missionary Nicolaus Ludwig 
Zinzendorf first used it to reach the Wyoming Valley. This particular stretch 
of "Warrior's Trail" had an abundance of hazel trees. Though the Moravians 
called the region "St. Anthony's Wilderness", it eventually became known 
as "Hazel Swamp", a name which had been used previously by the Indians. 
The Moravian missionaries were sent from their settlements in Bethlehem 
to the site of the Sugarloaf Massacre to bury the dead soldiers. Because 
of the aesthetic natural beauty of the Conyngham Valley, some Moravians 
decided to stay and in 1782, built a settlement, St. Johns, along the Nescopeck 
Creek, which is near the present-day intersection of Interstates 80 and 
81.[2] In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the "Warrior Trail" was 
widened and became the Berwick Turnpike. Later, a road was built to connect 
Wilkes-Barre to McKeansburg. This road intersected with the Berwick Turnpike 
at what is present-day Broad and Vine Streets, in downtown Hazleton. An 
entrepreneur named Jacob Drumheller decided that this intersection was 
the perfect location for a rest-stop, so in 1809, he built the first building 
in what would be later known as Hazleton. Though a few buildings and houses 
began to be built nearby, the area remained a dense wilderness for about 
20 more years. Aside from small-scale logging, the area offered little 
else. Jacob Drumheller is buried at Conyngham Union Cemetery. Railroad 
developers from Philadelphia became interested in the Hazleton area once 
previous rumors were validated that in 1818 anthracite coal deposits had 
been discovered in nearby Beaver Meadows by prospectors Nathaniel Beach 
and Tench Coxe. A young engineer from New York named Ariovistus "Ario" 
Pardee was hired to survey the topography of Beaver Meadows and report 
the practicality of extending a railroad from the Lehigh River Canal in 
Jim Thorpe to Beaver Meadows. Pardee, knowing that the area of Beaver Meadows 
was already controlled by Coxe and Beach, bought many acres of the land 
in present-day Hazleton. The investment proved to be extraordinarily lucrative. 
The land contained part of a massive anthracite coal field. Pardee will 
be forever known as the founding father of Hazleton.[citation needed] Pardee 
incorporated the Hazleton Coal Company in 1836, the same year that the 
rail link to the Lehigh Valley market was about to be completed. The Hazleton 
Coal Company built the first school on Church Street, where Hazleton City 
Hall is now located. Pardee also built the first church in Hazleton located 
at Church and Broad Streets. The Pardee mansion was built on the northern 
block of Broad Street, between present-day Church and Laurel Streets. The 
coal industry attracted many immigrants for labour, mostly German and Irish 
in the 1840s and 1850s, and mostly Italian, Polish, Russian, Lithuanian, 
Slovak and Montenegrins in the 1860s to 1920s. The coal mined in Hazleton 
helped to establish the United States as a world industrial power, primarily 
fueling the massive blast furnaces at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.[3] 
Many small company towns, often referred to by locals as "patch towns" 
or "patches" surrounded Hazleton and were built by coal companies to provide 
housing for the miners and their families. These include: Hazleton was 
incorporated as a borough on January 5, 1857. Its intended name was supposed 
to be spelled "Hazelton" but a clerk misspelled the name during incorporation, 
and the name "Hazleton" has been used ever since. The borough's first fire 
company, the Pioneer Fire Company, was organized in 1867 by soldiers returning 
from the American Civil War. Hazleton was incorporated as a city on December 
4, 1891. The population then was estimated to be around 14,000 people. 
In 1891, Hazleton became the third city in the United States to establish 
a city-wide electric grid. On September 10, 1897, the Lattimer Massacre 
occurred near Hazleton. After World War II, the demand for coal began to 
decline as cleaner, more efficient fuels were being used. Readily available, 
cheap energy helped open the door for manufacturing. The Duplan Silk Corporation 
opened and became the world's largest silk mill.[4] The garment industry 
thrived and was invested in by New York mobster Albert Anastasia.[citation 
needed] In 1947, Autolite Corporation was looking to expand operations 
in the East, and had been looking into Hazleton. Officials from Autolite 
came to the area to survey it and in their report, they noted Hazleton 
is a "mountain wilderness" with no major water route, rail route, trucking 
route, or airport. In response, several area leaders gathered to address 
these problems. CAN-DO (Community Area New Development Organization) was 
formally organized in 1956 by founder Dr. Edgar L. Dessen. Their main goal 
was to raise money, through their "Dime A Week" campaign, in which area 
residents were encouraged to put a dime on their sidewalk each week to 
be collected by CANDO. The company raised over $250,000 and was able to 
purchase over 500 acres (2.0 km2) of land, which was converted into an 
industrial park. Because of CANDO's efforts, Hazleton was given the All-America 
City Award in 1964. Hazleton's economy is now based largely on manufacturing 
and shipping, facilitated by the relative closeness to Interstates 80 and 
81. An article published in December 2002 by U.S. News & World Report was 
entitled "Letter from Pennsylvania: A town in need of a tomorrow" which 
reported Hazleton's shortcomings to the world. It was criticized by local 
politicians and business leaders alike, and again prompted local leaders 
to address the problems facing the community. In 2006, Hazleton gained 
national attention as Republican mayor Lou Barletta and council members 
passed the Illegal Immigration Relief Act.[5] This ordinance was instituted 
to discourage hiring or renting to illegal immigrants. Initially, the ordinance 
levied an administrative fine on landlords for $100.00 per illegal immigrant 
rented to and a loss of permits for non-compliance.[6] Another act passed 
concurrently made English the official language of Hazleton.[7] Mayor Lou 
Barletta of Hazleton estimated that as "many as half" of the estimated 
10,000 Hispanics who were living in Hazleton left Hazleton when the ordinance 
was passed.[8] The issue was covered by the television program 60 Minutes 
in 2006[9] and the Fox News show The O'Reilly Factor in March 2007.[10] 
The ordinance was criticized as illegal and unconstitutional. A number 
of residents (landlords, business owners, lawful aliens defined as illegal 
under the act, and unlawful aliens)[11][12][13] filed suit to strike down 
the law, claiming it violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution 
as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. After 
a trial and several appeals including a remand from the Supreme Court, 
the Third Circuit found the ordinance invalid due to federal preemption.[14]

among the Pennsylvania cities with the highest Hispanic and Latino populations 
since about 40% of Hazleton's population was Hispanic or Latino.[24] In 
2000 4.9% of the city population was Hispanic and Latino.[25] Almost all 
of the population growth in Hazleton from 2000 to 2010 consisted of Hispanics 
and Latinos, and the city would have lost population if the Hispanics and 
Latinos did not come. Hazleton was about 37% Hispanic/Latino as of 2010.[26] 
Over half of Hazleton's Hispanic population is of Dominican descent, making 
up 21% in 2010, Hazleton has the highest percentage of Dominicans in Pennsylvania 
and the 4th highest in the nation. Many Dominicans had moved to Hazleton 
from portions of New York City, including the Bronx and Brooklyn; and parts 
of northern New Jersey, such as Newark and Paterson.[26] Many of these 
migrants had families that were relatively large.[25] Amilcar Arroyo, a 
Hazleton Integration Project board member, stated in 2012 that he estimated 
that 80% of Hazleton's Hispanics and Latinos are of Dominican origins, 
and that many of them had ancestry from San José de Ocoa.[26] Many Hispanic 
and Latino businesses are on Wyoming Street.[26] In 2016 Michael Matza 
of the Philadelphia Inquirer stated that as a result of the influx of Hispanics 
the Wyoming Street corridor was revived from a moribund state.[25] El Mensajero, 
a monthly publication, serves as the Hispanic/Latino newspaper of Hazleton. 
Each issue is 56 pages.[25] All of Hazleton's major mining and garment 
industries have disappeared over the past 50 years. Through the efforts 
of CANDO and a practical highway infrastructure, Hazle Township's Humboldt 
Industrial Park has become home to many industries. Coca-Cola, American 
Eagle Outfitters, Hershey, Office Max, Simmons Bedding Company, Michaels, 
Network Solutions, AutoZone, General Mills, Steelcase, WEIR Minerals, EB 
Brands and Amazon.com[27] are just some of the large companies with distribution, 
manufacturing, or logistic operations in Hazleton. 6.7% of Residents had 
an income below the poverty level as compared to a statewide average of 
12.5% in 2010[28] The first school was built in the 1830s by the Hazleton 
Coal Company. It was a private elementary school at the corner of Church 
and Green Streets, the present-day site of Hazleton City Hall. Hazleton 
High School, the first high school, was built in 1875 at Pine and Hemlock 
Streets, the present-day site of the Pine Street Playground. Bishop Hafey 
High School, the Vikings, was Hazleton's only Roman Catholic High School, 
owned by the Diocese of Scranton. It was opened in 1971 and closed in 2007 
by the order of former Bishop Joseph F. Martino. The Hazleton Area School 
District (HASD) operates public schools serving the city limits. There 
are three schools in Hazleton operated by the HASD:[32] All district students 
are zoned to Hazleton Area High School in Hazle Township. Hazleton's commercial 
passenger airport is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport located 
in Avoca, Pennsylvania. The Lehigh Valley International Airport also serves 
Greater Hazleton. The Hazleton Municipal Airport is the general aviation 
airport for the city. Public transportation is provided by the Hazleton 
Public Transit, a service of the City of Hazleton's Department of Public 
Services. HPT operates nine routes throughout the city and neighboring 
communities. While Hazleton currently has no passenger rail service, it 
is a major regional center for commercial rail traffic, operated by Norfolk 
Southern Railway. Three Interstate highways run outside the Hazleton area, 
with associated exits to the city. There are five major inbound arteries 
into Hazleton: Church Street, Broad Street, CAN-DO Expressway, Arthur Gardner 
Parkway, 22nd Street. Hazleton's annual street festival, Funfest, is celebrated 
usually during the second weekend of September. The festival includes a 
craft show, a car show, entertainment from local bands, and many games 
of chance. The Funfest parade is held on Sunday during the Funfest weekend. 
Valley Day is celebrated in Conyngham during the first weekend of August. 
Many church festivals, including the Festival of the Madonna del Monte 
at Most Precious Blood Roman Catholic Church in Hazleton, is celebrated 
to preserve the Italian heritage of Hazleton. This is honored by carrying 
candle houses (cintis) by men up and down the streets of the eastern side 
of town, from the church to the Key Club, which is located on Monges Street. 
Hazleton was a long-time home to minor baseball. On April 14, 1934, the 
Philadelphia Phillies entered into an affiliation agreement with the New 
York–Penn League Hazleton Mountaineers. This was the first ever minor league 
affiliation for the Phillies.[34] The last minor-league club to play in 
Hazleton was the Hazleton Dodgers in 1950, a Brooklyn Dodgers farm-club 
which played in the Class D North Atlantic League.[35] Hazleton's modest 
skyline is remarkable for a city its size. Almost unaffected by examples 
of modern architecture, it provides an interesting window on American urbanism 
prior to World War II. Hazleton has several sister cities. They are: The
