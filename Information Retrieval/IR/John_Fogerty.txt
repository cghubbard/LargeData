John Cameron Fogerty (born May 28, 1945) is an American musician, singer 
and songwriter, early in his career best known as the lead singer and lead 
guitarist, as well as the principal songwriter, for the band Creedence 
Clearwater Revival (CCR) and later as a successful solo recording artist.[4] 
Fogerty was listed on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Guitarists 
(at number 40) and the list of 100 Greatest Singers (at number 72). Fogerty, 
the younger brother of guitarist Tom Fogerty, was born in Berkeley, California, 
and grew up in El Cerrito, California, one of five brothers born to Galen 
Robert and Edith Lucile Fogerty, who both converted to Catholicism when 
John was two years old. Galen Fogerty was a native of South Dakota and 
Lucile Fogerty was a native of Great Falls, Montana. He first attended 
a Catholic school in Berkeley, the School of the Madeleine, for one year, 
where among other abuses he was not permitted to go to the bathroom and 
frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his moist clothing. After 
one year, he was enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School. He later attended 
St. Mary's High School, transferring to El Cerrito High School.[5] He took 
guitar lessons from Barry Olivier, founder and producer of the Berkeley 
Folk Festival.[6] He spent summer vacations at Putah Creek, near Winters, 
California, which became the subject of the Creedence Clearwater Revival 
song "Green River".[7][8] Inspired by rock and roll pioneers, especially 
Little Richard[9] and Bo Diddley, John and his brother Tom Fogerty joined 
Doug Clifford and Stu Cook in the late 1950s to form the band Tommy Fogerty 
and the Blue Velvets in El Cerrito, California. After signing with the 
jazz label Fantasy in 1965, they became The Golliwogs and released a few 
singles that were largely ignored.[citation needed] He joined an Army Reserve 
unit. He served at Fort Bragg, Fort Knox, and Fort Lee. Fogerty was discharged 
from the Army in July 1967. In the same year, the band changed its name 
to Creedence Clearwater Revival. At this time, John took his brother's 
place as lead singer for the band. By 1968, things started to pick up for 
the band. The band released their self-titled debut album and also had 
their first hit single, "Susie Q". Many other hit singles and albums followed, 
beginning with "Proud Mary" and the album Bayou Country. Fogerty, as writer 
of the songs for the band (as well as lead singer and lead guitarist), 
felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the 
others, leading to resentments within the band.[10] These internal rifts, 
and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave 
the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Stu Cook 
and drummer Doug Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. 
Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford 
share equal songwriting and vocal time on what would become the band's 
final album, Mardi Gras, released in April 1972, which included the band's 
last two singles, the 1971 hit "Sweet Hitch-Hiker", and "Someday Never 
Comes", which barely made it into the Billboard Top 20. Cook and Clifford 
told Fogerty that the fans would not accept Mardi Gras as a CCR LP, but 
he said, "My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your 
songs." He gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or he would 
quit immediately. They accepted his ultimatum, but the album received poor 
reviews. It was a commercial success, however, peaking at #12 and achieving 
gold record status. It generated weaker sales than their previous albums. 
The group disbanded shortly afterwards. The only reunion of all four original 
members would be at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. John, Doug and Stu played 
a 45-minute set at their 20th class reunion in 1983, and John and Doug 
would reunite again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion in 1988. 
As CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of country 
& western covers, on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the 
instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty 
elected to credit the album to "The Blue Ridge Rangers" -- a band of which 
he was the only member. The "group" released The Blue Ridge Rangers, its 
only album, in 1973; it spun off the Top 20 hit "Jambalaya", as well as 
a lesser hit in "Heart of Stone". Fogerty, still using "The Blue Ridge 
Rangers" name, then released a self-penned rock & roll single": "You Don't 
Owe Me" b/w "Back in the Hills" (Fantasy F-710). It was a commercial flop, 
failing to make the Hot 100 in the U.S. Fogerty thereafter abandoned the 
"Blue Ridge Rangers" identity, and released all his subsequent work under 
his own name. In early 1974, Fogerty released "Comin' Down the Road"â€”backed 
with the instrumental "Ricochet". His second solo album, John Fogerty, 
was released in 1975. Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a followup, 
though it yielded "Rockin' All Over the World", a Top 40 hit for Fogerty 
in North America. Two years later, in 1977, British boogie rockers Status 
Quo recorded their version of "Rockin' All Over the World", which became 
a huge hit and made the song world-famous, not least by opening 1985's 
Live Aid with the song that had become one of their best-known anthems. 
In 1976, Fogerty finished an album called Hoodoo. A single, "You Got the 
Magic" backed with "Evil Thing", preceded the album's release, but it performed 
poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected 
by Asylum Records a couple of weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty 
agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum 
Records to destroy the master tapes for Hoodoo sometime in the 1980s. However, 
net-accessible bootlegs still exist. Fogerty says that he was unable to 
write music during this period of his life, primarily due to stresses from 
ongoing financial and legal difficulties with Fantasy Records. Although 
Fogerty was signed to Asylum in North America, Fantasy continued to hold 
rights to his records for the rest of the world; unwilling to allow the 
label to continue to profit from any new material, in 1980 he managed to 
terminate his contract with the record company by forgoing any future sales 
royalties on all of the music he produced with CCR. After a multi-year 
hiatus from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's 
Centerfield, his first album for Warner Bros. Records (which took over 
co-ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty). Centerfield went to the 
top of the charts and included a top-ten hit in "The Old Man Down the Road". 
The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball 
games to this day. But that album was not without its legal snags. Two 
songs on the album, "Zanz Kant Danz" and "Mr. Greed", were believed to 
be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at Fantasy Records, Saul Zaentz. "Zanz 
Kant Danz" was about a pig who can't dance but would "steal your money." 
When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: 
"Vanz Kant Danz" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another 
lawsuit (Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty) claimed that "The Old Man Down the Road" 
shared the same chorus as "Run Through the Jungle" (a song from Fogerty's 
days with Creedence to which Fantasy Records had owned the publishing rights). 
Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were 
wholly distinct compositions. Fogerty then countersued for attorney fees 
(Fogerty v. Fantasy). After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 
Fogerty won his case in the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that a trial 
court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs. On May 
31, 1985 Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime 
called John Fogerty's All-Stars. The set list consisted of R&B tunes from 
the 1960s as well as material from the Centerfield LP and the song "No 
Love in You" written by Michael Anderson which John found on the Textones' 
debut album Midnight Mission and he later recorded with Textones band leader 
Carla Olson. John Fogerty's All-Stars was recorded in front of an audience 
of Warners Brothers Music employees and other invited guests at A&M Record 
on La Brea in Hollywood, CA. The band included Albert Lee, Booker T. Jones, 
Duck Dunn, Steve Douglas and Prairie Prince amongst others. The follow-up 
album to Centerfield was Eye of the Zombie in 1986, and it was significantly 
less successful than its predecessor. Fogerty toured behind the album, 
but he refused to play any Creedence material. Eye of the Zombie took on 
a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars 
selling out. For over 20 years after the Eye of the Zombie tour ended in 
late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. 
However, "Change in the Weather" was included in the set list for his 2009 
tour, and it was even re-recorded for that year's solo release, The Blue 
Ridge Rangers Rides Again. Fogerty played Creedence material again at a 
concert in Washington, D.C., for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 
4, 1987. The show was aired on HBO. Aside from a guest appearance at the 
Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction 
ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater 
Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played 
a set of CCR material at Oakland Coliseum for the Concert Against AIDS. 
His backing band that night consisted of Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir on guitars, 
Randy Jackson on bass, and Steve Jordan on drums.[11] In 1990 Tom Fogerty 
died of complications of AIDS (a tuberculosis infection) at the age of 
48, having contracted HIV from blood transfusions for back ailments. John 
Fogerty has recalled that the darkest moments in his life were when his 
brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and 
the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were not speaking 
to each other.[12] In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, John said: 
"We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, 
becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up."[13] Fogerty 
traveled to Mississippi in 1990 for inspiration and visited the gravesite 
of blues legend Robert Johnson. According to him, while there he had the 
realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own 
songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, and thus Fogerty 
decided to start making a new album and to perform his old Creedence material 
regularly in concert.[14][15] It was at this time visiting the Mt. Zion 
Missionary Baptist Church cemetery that Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New 
Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation The 
Mt. Zion Memorial Fund to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty 
subsequently funded headstones for Charlie Patton, James Son Thomas, Mississippi 
Joe Callicott, Eugene Powell, Lonnie Pitchford and helped with financial 
arrangements for numerous others.[16] Creedence Clearwater Revival was 
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. John Fogerty refused 
to perform with his former band mates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and 
Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In 
place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians 
on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson 
in performing three songs: "Who'll Stop the Rain", "Born on the Bayou" 
and "Green River".[17] During the induction speech, Springsteen said, "As 
a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty]. 
He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. Funny, too. 
He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out 
of there."[18] Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 
with Blue Moon Swamp. The layoff between Zombie and Swamp had been longer 
than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful 
than Zombie and won the Grammy for best rock album in 1997. A live album, 
named Premonition, of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour was released 
to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. On October 1, 1998, Fogerty 
was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions 
to the music industry. His star is located at 7000 Hollywood Boulevard.[19] 
[20] In 2004, Fogerty released Deja Vu All Over Again. His new record contract 
was with DreamWorks Records, which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's 
Warner Bros. catalog. Rolling Stone wrote: "The title track is Fogerty's 
indictment of the Iraq war as another Vietnam, a senseless squandering 
of American lives and power". On the album, Fogerty squeezed 10 songs into 
only 34 minutes. The sale of Fantasy Records to Concord Records in 2004 
ended the 30-plus-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label 
as the new owners took steps to restore royalty rights Fogerty gave up 
in order to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. 
In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records. That was made possible 
when DreamWorks Records' non-country music unit was absorbed by Geffen 
Records, which dropped Fogerty but continued to distribute his earlier 
solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was 
The Long Road Home, a compilation CD combining his Creedence hits with 
solo material which was issued in November 2005. A live CD and DVD concert 
was released the following year. Fogerty's touring schedule increased in 
the period after Deja Vu All Over Again. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared 
on the Vote for Change tour, playing a series of concerts in US swing states. 
He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian 
children's group The Wiggles. "Centerfield" was also played at the 2008 
Republican National Convention when John McCain introduced Sarah Palin 
as his running mate. Fogerty's numbers were played with Bruce Springsteen 
and the E Street Band. Fogerty toured with John Mellencamp in the summer 
of 2005 and with Willie Nelson in the summer of 2006. On June 29, 2006 
he played his first headlining British concert since 1972, at the Hammersmith 
Apollo theater in London, as part of the European leg of the tour. During 
that leg he also performed in Sundsvall, Sweden, where 25,000 people came 
to see him perform at the town square. On Thanksgiving Day of 2006, Fogerty 
performed at halftime at the Miami Dolphins/Detroit Lions game as well 
as at the Denver Broncos/Kansas City Chiefs halftime later that evening.[21][22][23] 
Alongside Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper, Isaac Hayes, 
and David Porter, Fogerty was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame 
in 2005. On June 23, 2007 John Fogerty appeared at Glastonbury Festival, 
England, playing a very energetic hour-long set of 17 songs, mainly CCR 
classics.[24] Introducing "Who'll Stop the Rain", Fogerty said he didn't 
perform the song Stop the Rain at Woodstock as rumoured, but wrote the 
song inspired by the event.[25] Fogerty completed his first new rock album 
in three years, Revival, which was released on October 2, 2007.[26] Heavily 
promoted by the label, Revival debuted at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard 
200 chart with sales about 65,000 copies in its first week. Revival was 
nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of 2008 but lost to the 
Foo Fighters. On February 10, 2008, he appeared with Jerry Lee Lewis and 
Little Richard on the Grammy Awards Show. Along with these rock icons and 
his regular touring band, he played his ultra-rare 1973 single "Comin' 
Down the Road" leading into Lewis and Richard's performances of "Great 
Balls of Fire" and "Good Golly Miss Molly", respectively. On March 16, 
2008, Fogerty kicked off an Australian tour. On March 22 in Point Nepean, 
Australia, surprise guest Keith Urban joined Fogerty on stage, performing 
two songs: "Broken Down Cowboy", off Fogerty's newest album Revival, and 
"Cotton Fields", from CCR's album Willy & the Poor Boys. On June 24, 2008, 
Fogerty made a return to the Royal Albert Hall, a venue he last played 
with CCR in 1971. It was the last concert on his 2008 European Tour. This 
concert was filmed (causing staging problems that annoyed some fans)[27][28][29] 
and was released in 2009. On April 16, 2009, Fogerty performed his hit 
"Centerfield", from center field, at the opening day festivities of the 
new Yankee Stadium.[30] On July 2, 3 and 4, 2009, Fogerty performed with 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, which was completely 
sold out for these shows. Although the night was billed as Fogerty with 
the LA Philharmonic, the LA Philharmonic began the night with music by 
US composers, and Fogerty and his band came on after intermission and played 
all of his greatest hits. Fogerty and his band played only three songs 
with the orchestra. On August 31, 2009, Fogerty released a sequel to his 
1973 solo debut The Blue Ridge Rangers, called The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides 
Again. The album includes a duet with Bruce Springsteen on the 1960 Everly 
Brothers classic "When Will I Be Loved?" Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit 
of The Eagles sing with Fogerty on a cover of Ricky Nelson's 1972 classic 
"Garden Party".[31] The album was the first issued on Fogerty's own label 
Fortunate Son Records, which is distributed by the Verve Forecast Records 
unit of Universal Music Group(UMG).[32] On October 29, 2009, Fogerty appeared 
at Madison Square Garden for the first night of the celebratory 25th Anniversary 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts. Bruce Springsteen, with the E Street 
Band, called Fogerty out to play three songs with them. "Fortunate Son" 
was their first song, followed by "Proud Mary" and finally the duo tried 
their take on Roy Orbison's "Pretty Woman". The show aired as a four-hour 
special on HBO on November 29, 2009.[33][34] On November 3, 2009, Fogerty 
released the Royal Albert Hall DVD entitled Comin' Down the Road, named 
after his 1973 single, which he performed at this concert. Fogerty was 
also nominated for a Grammy Award at the 2010 Grammys. He was nominated 
for the Best Rock Solo Vocal Performance Grammy for the song "Change in 
the Weather". which he recorded for The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.[citation 
needed] For his songwriting achievements, Fogerty was honored as a BMI 
Icon at the 58th annual BMI Pop Awards on May 18, 2010. BMI Icons are selected 
because of their "unique and indelible influence on generations of music 
makers."[35] Fogerty began recording Wrote a Song for Everyone in 2011, 
which was released on Vanguard Records on May 28, 2013, his 68th birthday. 
The album is a collection of classics and tracks from his canon of hits 
performed with other artists.[36] The album also includes two brand-new 
Fogerty-penned songs. On November 17, 2011 John Fogerty performed on the 
Late Show with David Letterman.[37] On November 17 and 18, he performed 
two Creedence Clearwater Revival albums, Cosmo's Factory and Green River 
(respectively), in their entirety at the Beacon Theater in New York City 
(he also played Cosmo's Factory in Atlantic City on November 20). He was 
also featured on the CBS coverage of the Thanksgiving Day Parade, performing 
several prerecorded songs.[citation needed] In January 2012, Fogerty's 
new song "Swamp Water" debuted over the opening credits of the new FOX 
TV series The Finder. Fogerty wrote the song specifically for the show 
and guest starred in its debut episode.[citation needed] On November 12, 
2012 Fogerty announced that he was writing his memoirs, and that the book 
was expected to be released in 2015.[38] During the 2014 Veterans days 
celebration "Salute to the Troops" at the White House, Fogerty performed 
for veterans. On February 21, 2015, he was a featured artist for the NHL 
stadium series hockey game between the Los Angeles Kings and the San Jose 
Sharks at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.[citation needed] Fogerty 
married Martha Paiz in 1965. They had three children before divorcing in 
the 1970s.[39] He met Julie Kramer[40] in 1986 while on tour in Indianapolis, 
Indiana, and married in Elkhart, Indiana, on April 20, 1991. Kramer had 
a daughter from a previous marriage.[41] John and Julie have two sons and 
a daughter.[42] As of 2009[update], they live in Beverly Hills, California.[43]
