The 1971 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 89th season for the franchise 
in Philadelphia. The Phillies finished in sixth place in the National League 
East, with a record of 67-95. On April 10, the Phillies officially opened 
Veterans Stadium, their new home park, with a 4-1 victory over the Montreal 
Expos. Harry Kalas was hired by the Phillies in 1971 to succeed Bill Campbell, 
and was the master of ceremonies at the 1971 opening of Veterans Stadium. 
The Phillies played an exhibition game against the Reading Phillies on 
June 17, 1971 in Reading. The Phillies had signed second-round draft-pick 
Mike Schmidt on June 11. Schmidt made his professional debut in the exhibition 
game in Reading. Schmidt played the whole game at shortstop for the Phillies 
and hit a game-winning home run against Reading. He was subsequently assigned 
to the Reading club where he played the balance of the season.[4] On June 
25, Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Willie Stargell hit what wound up being 
the longest home run in Veterans Stadium history off of pitcher Jim Bunning 
in a 14-4 Pirates win over the Phillies.[5] The spot where the ball landed 
was marked with a yellow star with a black "S" inside a white circle until 
Stargell's 2001 death, when the white circle was painted black.[6] The 
star remained until the stadium's 2004 demolition. Infielders Coaches Note:
