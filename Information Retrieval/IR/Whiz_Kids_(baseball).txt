The Whiz Kids were the baseball team of the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies 
in Major League Baseball.[1] This team, averaging only 26.4 years of age,[2] 
won the National League pennant during that season. After owner R. R. M. 
Carpenter, Jr. built a team of bonus babies, the 1950 team won for the 
majority of the season, but slumped late, allowing the defending National 
League champion Brooklyn Dodgers to gain ground in the last two weeks. 
The final series of the season was against Brooklyn, and the final game 
pitted the Opening Day starting pitchers, right-handers Robin Roberts and 
Don Newcombe, against one another. The Phillies defeated the Dodgers in 
extra innings in the final game of the season on a three-run home run by 
Dick Sisler in the top of the tenth inning. In the World Series which followed, 
the Whiz Kids were swept by the New York Yankees, who won their second 
of five consecutive World Series championships.[3] The failure of the Whiz 
Kids to win another pennant after their lone successful season has been 
attributed to multiple theories, the most prominent of which is Carpenter's 
unwillingness to integrate his team after winning a pennant with an all-white 
team. The Phillies' last appearance in the World Series was in 1915, which 
had been the franchise's only foray into the postseason to date. In that 
series, they were defeated by the Boston Red Sox, four games to one.[4] 
From 1933 to 1948, the Phillies posted 16 consecutive losing seasons, a 
major league record that stood until 2009 (broken by the Pittsburgh Pirates).[5] 
Ben Chapman, who managed the Phillies from 1945 to 1948,[6] bemoaned the 
loss of general manager Herb Pennock, who died during Chapman's final season. 
Bob Carpenter, the new owner of the team, replaced Chapman after his comments 
to media sources that Pennock needed to be replaced with "another strong 
baseball man".[7] The new manager, Eddie Sawyer, arrived in the 1948 season 
and led the Phillies to a winning record in 1949 (81–73).[8] Carpenter's 
team-building approach was built on provision of ample bonuses for players. 
Signing bonuses for the players on the 1950 squad ranged from $3,000 ($29,556 
in present-day dollars) to $65,000 ($640,380 present-day).[7] The Dodgers, 
meanwhile, had appeared in the 1947 and 1949 World Series, losing to the 
New York Yankees in both. Indeed, the Phillies' appearance against the 
Yankees in the 1950 World Series was the only time in the Yankees' run 
of five consecutive championships (1949–1953) wherein they did not face 
one of the other teams from New York City (the Dodgers or the New York 
Giants).[9] The Phillies opened the season with a 9–1 defeat of the Dodgers 
on April 18. The starters in the game were Robin Roberts for Philadelphia 
and Don Newcombe, Brooklyn's 17-game winner from the prior season. After 
a split with the Dodgers, the Phillies played four games against the Boston 
Braves, losing two, tying one, and winning one; reliever Jim Konstanty 
earned his first win in the final game of the series. Three games in New 
York against the Giants and the Dodgers did not improve the team's record, 
but they took three of the next four from Boston. In May, the team amassed 
its longest winning streak of the season, when they won six consecutive 
games—one against the St. Louis Cardinals, a three-game sweep of the Cincinnati 
Redlegs, one against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and the last against the Giants. 
Konstanty earned another win against New York as the Phillies took two 
wins from the three-game set, and the end of the Phillies' May was strong 
with a five-game winning streak against Pittsburgh and the Giants. Two 
doubleheaders against New York and Brooklyn resulted in three losses to 
finish the month.[10] In the middle months of the season, the Whiz Kids 
played strongly, notching winning records of 14–11 in June and 21–13 in 
July.[10] Early in July, the Phillies put together a four-game winning 
streak against the two National League teams from New York, sweeping the 
Giants in a two-game set and taking two of three from Brooklyn.[11] The 
1950 All-Star Game was played on July 11, with four Phillies selected to 
the roster. Willie Jones started at third base and led off the game, while 
Roberts was selected as the starting pitcher. Konstanty and Dick Sisler 
were named to the team as reserves out of the bullpen and in the outfield, 
respectively.[12] The Phillies played twelve doubleheaders in June and 
July, including three sets on consecutive game days (July 16 and 18 against 
the Chicago Cubs and July 19 against Pittsburgh).[11] August was the Whiz 
Kids' strongest month, with a 20–8 record and a .714 winning percentage. 
During August and September, the Phillies put together two five-game winning 
streaks and a four-game winning streak as well.[2] By September 20, the 
Phillies had a seven-and-a-half game lead over Boston and a nine-game lead 
on Brooklyn.[13] However, injuries began to mount, and with injuries came 
losses—of players and of games. Among the casualties were pitcher Bob Miller, 
who injured his back slipping on wet stairs; outfielder Bill Nicholson, 
diagnosed with diabetes, was out for the remainder of the season.[14] In 
the last week of the season, with their lead over the Dodgers at four games, 
the Phillies dropped back-to-back doubleheaders to the Giants, and lost 
the next game to Brooklyn to fall into their longest losing slump of the 
season and set up the final game of the season at Ebbets Field.[14] Another 
loss to the Dodgers would force a best-of-three playoff for the National 
League pennant.[15] No one in the Phillies clubhouse knew who would pitch 
the final game of the season against the Dodgers, except Sawyer, until 
an hour before the game, when the manager handed Roberts the ball.[16] 
Opposing Roberts was Newcombe, who had opened the season against the Phillies 
in their 9–1 victory. Roberts walked a batter in the bottom of the first 
inning, but no other runners reached base for Brooklyn until the fourth 
inning. The Phillies had four baserunners on three singles and a walk against 
Newcombe, but no one advanced beyond first base. In the bottom of the fourth, 
Pee Wee Reese hit a double for the Dodgers, but Roberts retired the next 
three batters in order.[16] In the sixth inning, Sisler was on base, having 
hit a single through the gap into right field between first baseman Gil 
Hodges and second baseman Jackie Robinson.[17] Jones singled to left field, 
driving him in for the first run of the game;[18] his hit has been called 
"the most important in Phillies history to that point".[19] The Dodgers 
tied the game on a home run by Reese in the bottom of the sixth; the ball 
landed on a ledge in right-center field and, caught by a wire screen along 
the foul line, stayed in play but out of Del Ennis' reach.[17][18] The 
Phillies got men on base in the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings, while 
Roberts allowed a single to Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella in the eighth, 
but the score remained tied, 1–1.[17] In the bottom of the ninth inning, 
Roberts walked Cal Abrams,[17] who advanced to second on a single by Reese[20] 
and came around to home plate on Duke Snider's hard single up the middle.[21] 
Richie Ashburn threw the ball to catcher Stan Lopata, who had replaced 
starting catcher Andy Seminick on defense in the bottom of the 9th inning 
[22] from his position in center field, and Lopata tagged Abrams out at 
the plate.[23] With runners now on second and third, Roberts walked Robinson 
intentionally to load the bases, then induced Carl Furillo to foul out 
to Eddie Waitkus.[23] After Roberts retired the last batter, the game went 
to extra innings. Newcombe allowed hits to Roberts and Waitkus, who advanced 
to second and third when Ashburn sacrificed himself.[20] Sisler came to 
the plate and hit a high outside fastball from Newcombe over the left-field 
wall, dancing to first base as he watched it fly out.[21] Comfortable on 
the mound again with a 4–1 lead, Roberts retired the side in the tenth 
inning to secure the complete-game victory and the Phillies' second pennant 
in franchise history.[20] Sawyer turned heads around the league by naming 
Konstanty, his closer, the starter for Game 1;[20] he had few options without 
Roberts, who had started four games in eight days,[14][24] rookie Bubba 
Church, who had been hit in the eye with a line drive,[25] and Curt Simmons, 
who was activated into military service on September 10.[14] Konstanty 
lost the game, though he allowed only one run on five hits in eight innings 
pitched; Yankees starter Vic Raschi pitched a complete game shutout, striking 
out five.[26] Roberts returned to the mound to face Allie Reynolds in the 
second game, but one run scored could not win the game for the Phillies, 
as Joe DiMaggio hit a home run to lead off the top of the tenth inning 
to put the Yankees ahead in the game 2–1, and in the series 2–0.[27] With 
Ken Heintzelman on the mound in Game 3, the Phillies outhit the Yankees, 
but could not push enough runs across the plate. The Whiz Kids lost, 3–2.[18] 
Miller was the Phillies' last hope for a victory, but the ailing rookie 
was no match for 21-year-old Whitey Ford,[18] as the Phillies lost the 
last game, 5–2,[28] and became the first team swept in the World Series 
since the 1939 Cincinnati Reds.[29] Konstanty became the second Phillie 
to win the Most Valuable Player Award, after Chuck Klein (1932);[30] his 
22 saves and 16 wins by a reliever were both National League records at 
the time.[31][32] Ennis led the team in batting average, home runs, and 
runs batted in,[33] while Roberts' 20 wins in 1950 were the beginning of 
six consecutive seasons with 20 or more wins for the pitcher.[34] As the 
catcher, Seminick provided veteran leadership for the team and helped guide 
the young pitching staff. Roberts said of Seminick,"If you had to pick 
a guy in the clubhouse who was our leader that year, it would be Andy. 
He always played hard, and that was his best year by far."[35] Six players 
have since been elected members of the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame: 
outfielder Ashburn; pitchers Roberts, Konstanty, Simmons; and infielders 
Hamner and Jones.[36] National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum inductees 
from the Whiz Kids include Roberts, who entered the Hall in 1976,[37] and 
Ashburn, elected in 1995.[38] The "Whiz Kids" name endured for the Phillies 
franchise into the 1980s, when the 1983 Philadelphia Phillies, a team of 
veteran players who faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series that 
season, were coined the "Wheeze Kids".[39] Many thought that the Whiz Kids, 
with a young core of talented players, would be a force in the league for 
years to come.[40][41] However, it was not to be, as the team finished 
with a 73–81 record in 1951, and (except for 2nd-place tie in 1964) did 
not finish higher than third place again until 1975.[42] Different players 
on the Phillies attributed the team's decline to multiple factors. Roberts 
believed that the Phillies were "good, but never quite as good as the teams 
that beat us".[41] Ashburn, however, had a different opinion: "We were 
the last to get any black ball players. We were still pretty good, but 
they were just getting better."[43] The Phillies, as the last team in the 
National League to integrate, exhibited racist behavior on several occasions. 
When Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line in 1947, Chapman instructed 
his players to spike Robinson and pitch at his head.[44] These activities 
and attitudes continued through the Whiz Kids era and beyond. Carpenter 
tended to pass by African-American players; his Whiz Kids had won the pennant 
while fielding an all-white team, and he, as other owners, tended to pass 
over any non-white players who did not have superstar-level talent.[43] 
The Phillies did not integrate until 1957, a decade after Robinson's entry,[44] 
and did not have their first true African-American star until the arrival 
of John Kennedy. When Kennedy made his major league debut (April 22, 1957 
at Roosevelt Stadium), he became the first black player in Philadelphia
