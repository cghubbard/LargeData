The David L. Lawrence Convention Center (DLLCC) is a 1,500,000-square-foot 
(140,000 m2) convention, conference and exhibition building in downtown 
Pittsburgh in the U.S. commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It is served by two 
exits on Interstate 579. The initial David L. Lawrence Convention Center 
was completed on the site on February 7, 1981, but as part of a renewal 
plan the new, completely redesigned center was opened in 2003 and funded 
in conjunction with nearby Heinz Field and PNC Park. It sits on the southern 
shoreline of the Allegheny River. It is the first LEED-certified convention 
center in North America and one of the first in the world.[2] It is owned 
by the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County[3] 
In the early 1970s a site on the opposite side of Downtown Pittsburgh was 
considered for a modern convention center, on the shores of the Monongahela 
River. On September 20, 1971 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania failed to 
approve that location, and site work slowly began on the present site as 
the city and county submitted it to the commonwealth on December 10, 1974. 
There was a proposal in mid-1974 to locate the center at the then transitioning 
Penn Station.[4] The center had its ceremonial groundbreaking on June 8, 
1977.[5][6][7] On February 7, 1981 the original $35 million ($101 million 
today) structure opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Mayor Richard 
Caliguiri, County Commissioner Tom Foerster and Governor Dick Thornburgh.[8] 
After the Commonwealth approved funding for the redesigned center on February 
3, 1999 Rafael Viñoly Architects, P.C. was chosen as the designer for the 
modern center on February 28, 1999. Viñoly along with Dewhurst MacFarlane 
& Partners and Goldreich Engineering P.C. constructed the $354 million 
($503.7 million today) riverfront landmark to contain 313,400 sq ft (29,100 m2) 
of exhibit space (236,900 sq ft (22,000 m2) of which is column-free), 76,500 sq ft 
(7,100 m2) of additional exhibit space, a 31,610 sq ft (2,940 m2) ballroom, 
51 meeting rooms, two 250-seat lecture halls, teleconference and telecommunications 
capabilities and 4,500 sq ft (420 m2) of retail space (currently in development). 
The architect, Viñoly, began the design with a goal in mind of achieving 
the status of a "green" building. In 2003, the building was awarded Gold 
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification by the 
U.S. Green Building Council, making it the first such convention center 
in the U.S. and the largest "green" building in the world.[2] The current 
building replaced the former convention center of the same name that was 
constructed in 1981. The old convention center was 131,000 sq ft (12,000 m2) 
and lacked a ballroom. All of the old building was demolished to make way 
for the current structure which was built on the same site. The building 
won the 2004 Supreme Award for structural engineering excellence from the 
Institution of Structural Engineers. The convention center is home to prominent 
conventions, such as Anthrocon, the Pittsburgh RV Show, Pittsburgh Boat 
Show, Pittsburgh Home and Garden Show, Piratefest, and the acclaimed Pittsburgh 
International Auto Show. The center—though completely a structure of 2003 
construction—chose to retain the name of the earlier convention center 
on the site completed in 1981 in honor of David Leo Lawrence (June 18, 
1889—November 21, 1966). Lawrence was an American politician who served 
as the Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania from 1959 to 1963, only retiring 
because of the state's then term limit of 1 per governor. He is to date 
the only mayor of Pittsburgh to be elected Governor of Pennsylvania. Previously, 
he had been the longest tenured mayor of Pittsburgh (1946-1959) and the 
primary force behind Pittsburgh's urban renewal projects including the 
Mellon Arena, Gateway Center, Fort Pitt Tunnel and Point State Park. He 
was Pennsylvania's first Catholic Governor (at the time a major breakthrough 
for an Irish Catholic), and a major force in the national Democratic Party 
from the 1930s to the 1960s. Historians credit him with among other behind-the-scenes 
labors, leading a compromise at the 1944 National Democratic Convention 
that eventually made Harry Truman president. As well as healing a divided 
national convention of 1960 that resulted in the John F. Kennedy/Lyndon 
B. Johnson ticket, it is for these reasons as well as his work in the state 
and the city that he was dubbed "kingmaker" by party leaders. On February 
13, 1982 a Car Expo Mercury display featuring a 130 lb. Leesburg, Florida 
cougar named Tom Tom mauled a 9 year old Upper St. Clair boy before Pittsburgh 
Police officers shot the animal dead. The boy survived after being treated 
at Allegheny General Hospital for several days.[9][10] On February 12, 
2002, less than two weeks before the scheduled opening of the new center,[11] 
a 165-ton truss that was under construction collapsed, killing one and 
injuring two workers.[12] The truss was part of the second phase of construction, 
scheduled for opening in 2003, and did not delay the February 23 opening 
of phase one. On February 5, 2007, a section of concrete floor from the 
second floor loading dock collapsed under the weight of a tractor-trailer 
and fell onto the water feature area below.[13] There were no injuries. 
The building remained closed until investigations by the contractors were 
completed on March 9, the fault was repaired, and the convention center 
reopened. The Convention Center is served by exits on Interstate 579, Interstate 
279 and Interstate 376 as well as its location within five blocks of both 
the Wood Street and Penn Station transit stops on the Pittsburgh subway 
system. Penn Station also serves Amtrak, providing regular direct inter-city 
rail links. Both the Megabus intercity service and the local Port Authority
