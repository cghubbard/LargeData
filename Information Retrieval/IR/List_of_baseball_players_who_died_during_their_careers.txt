This is a list of baseball players who died during their careers. These 
deaths occurred during a game, due to illness, acts of violence, or as 
a result of accidents. Repeated studies have shown that Major League Baseball 
players have a greater life expectancy than males in the general US population 
â€” about five years more, on average. This is attributed to their superior 
fitness. The longer the active career, the longer the player lives, on 
average. This correlation is attributed to the maintenance of fitness and 
increased wealth.[1] This is a list of notable deaths in baseball and untimely 
deaths of active professional baseball players. Minor league players are 
listed with their major league affiliate team. Minor league players who 
never appeared in a major league game are listed in italics. Former players 
of Major League Baseball still active in professional baseball at the time
