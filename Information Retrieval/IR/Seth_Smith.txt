Garry Seth Smith (born September 30, 1982), sometimes nicknamed "Dad," 
is an American professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter for 
the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played 
in MLB for the Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics and San Diego Padres. 
Smith played right field for the University of Mississippi from 2002–2004, 
and was also the backup quarterback to Eli Manning on the football team 
at Mississippi. During his freshman year, Smith hit .402 and was named 
a Freshman All-American. Smith also played for the USA National Team in 
the Pan-Am games while at Ole Miss. Smith made his Major League Baseball 
debut with the Colorado Rockies on September 16, 2007, in a 13–0 home win 
over the Florida Marlins.[1][2] He did not record a hit in two total at 
bats during the game. He got his first hit, an infield single, on September 
21, 2007, in a 2–1 extra-innings road win over the San Diego Padres.[1][3] 
His hit came off of Doug Brocail in the top of the 12th inning. Smith played 
in seven games during the regular season, racking up five hits in eight 
at bats. Smith's successful stint during the regular season earned him 
a spot on the Rockies' 2007 postseason roster. In the 2007 National League 
Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Smith had one pinch 
hit in two at bats. His lone hit came in the second game of the series 
in a 10–5 win against the Phillies. It was an infield hit in the top of 
the fourth inning that loaded the bases with the Rockies down, 3–2. The 
next batter, Colorado second baseman Kazuo Matsui, went on to hit a memorable 
grand slam to give the Rockies a lead that they would never relinquish. 
Colorado went on to sweep the Phillies in three games and then went on 
to sweep the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games in the 2007 National League 
Championship Series. Once again, Smith had one pinch hit in two at bats. 
The one hit was in the fourth game of the series in a 6–4 series-clinching 
win against the Diamondbacks. This time, Smith hit a double that came with 
two outs and two runners in scoring position in the bottom of the fourth 
inning with the Rockies down, 1–0. The double drove in both runners to 
give Colorado a 2–1 lead. Smith then went on to score during the inning 
after a Matsui single. Colorado left fielder Matt Holliday also hit a three-run 
home run in the fourth inning to cap off a six-run fourth inning, all with 
two outs. Smith was the final out in the 2007 World Series, striking out 
against Boston Red Sox's closer Jonathan Papelbon. In that postseason Smith 
excelled, hitting above .500. Smith hit his first career home run, a three-run 
shot, on May 25, 2008, in a 4–1 home win over the New York Mets.[4] He 
hit the home run off of John Maine in the bottom of the fourth inning. 
Smith also hit his first career inside the park home run that season, which 
was the eighth in Colorado Rockies history. On January 16, 2012, Smith 
was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Guillermo Moscoso and Josh Outman.[5] 
Due to his severe splits between facing right handed and left handed pitching, 
Smith platooned in his two seasons in Oakland. He hit .246 with 22 home 
runs for the A's between 2012 and 2013. On December 3, 2013, Smith was 
traded to the San Diego Padres for pitcher Luke Gregerson.[6] On March 
30, 2014, Smith hit a home run against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Brian 
Wilson in his first at-bat as a Padre.[7] On July 2, 2014, he signed a 
two-year, $13 million extension.[8] Smith finished the season batting .266 
with 12 homers and 48 RBIs. He led the Padres in batting average (.266), 
OBP (.367) and hits (118), as well as doubles, triples and walks.[9] During 
the 2014–15 offseason, the Padres traded for a trio of outfielders in Matt 
Kemp, Wil Myers, and Justin Upton, leaving Smith open to be traded. On 
December 30, 2014, the Padres traded Smith to the Seattle Mariners in exchange 
for pitcher Brandon Maurer.[10] In his first full season in Seattle, Smith 
hit .248 with 12 home runs while platooning for the majority of the season 
with Franklin Gutierrez. Smith was the backup quarterback to Eli Manning 
at the University of Mississippi. Coincidentally, Smith's Rockies teammate, 
Todd Helton, was the starting quarterback for the University of Tennessee 
until a knee injury resulted in Manning's older brother Peyton succeeding 
him. Furthermore, current Duke Head Football Coach David Cutcliffe was 
Helton's quarterback coach at Tennessee and Smith's head coach at Ole Miss.[11]
