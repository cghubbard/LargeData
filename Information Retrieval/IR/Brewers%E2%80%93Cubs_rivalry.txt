The Brewers–Cubs rivalry is a Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry between 
the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs. Both clubs are members of MLB's 
National League (NL) Central division. The rivalry is also sometimes known 
as the I-94 Rivalry, because the two teams' ballparks are located only 
83.3 miles (134.1 km) from each other off Interstate 94 (I-94). Bob Uecker 
and Harry Caray have been sportscasters for their respective teams. The 
Brewers and Cubs have been playing each other in spring training Cactus 
League games since the Brewers franchise began as the Seattle Pilots in 
1969.[1] However, this budding rivalry did not begin to grow until 1998, 
when the Brewers moved from the American League Central Division to the 
National League Central. Until then, the Brewers had a rivalry with Chicago's 
AL team, the White Sox. The Brewers and Cubs met for the first official 
time on June 13, 1997 in interleague play, a 4-2 Brewers victory in Wrigley 
Field.[2] They met for the first time as division rivals on June 15, 1998, 
a 6-5 Cubs victory also in Wrigley Field.[3] The young series has proven 
very competitive with the Brewers leading 131-123 through the 2013 season. 
After battling for the NL Central title in both 2007 and 2008, the teams 
met at Miller Park for the Brewers' home opener. During the second game 
of the homestand on Saturday April 11, 2009, the Brewers had the highest 
attendance in Major League Baseball for the rivalry game.[4] During games 
in Milwaukee, it was sometimes common for there to be many Cubs fans in 
attendance. This has been largely due to the ticket availability at Miller 
Park; Wrigley Field has routinely sold out in the past, so it has often 
been easier and cheaper for Cubs fans to watch games at Miller Park. During 
the 2006 season, the Milwaukee Brewers started the "Take Back Miller Park" 
campaign to regain home field advantage. Since then, the dominating presence 
of Cubs fans has somewhat dwindled as the Brewers have become more popular 
with local fans following the sale of the team from Bud Selig to Mark Attanasio. 
Through the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the rivalry became more intense with 
both teams battling for the National League Central crown, a prize the 
Cubs eventually claimed both seasons.[5] During 2008, the Brewers had a 
sellout streak going at the start of a mid-July series at home against 
the Cubs.[6] The rivalry was less prominent in the following seasons, as 
both teams finished well out of playoff contention in 2010, while in 2011 
the Brewers claimed the NL Central title and the Cubs struggled to a 71-91 
record. After the 2011 season ended, former Brewer player, coach and manager 
Dale Sveum was hired by the Cubs to be their new manager in 2012. The Brewers 
in 2012, won 13 of 17 games against the Cubs to take the all-time series 
at 118-117. After the 2012 season, Sveum went hunting with Brewers Hall 
of Famer Robin Yount. During the trip, Sveum was accidentally shot with 
some shrapnel by Yount.[7] The Brewers won 13 out of the 19 meetings between 
the two teams in the 2013 season, extending their series lead to 131-123.
