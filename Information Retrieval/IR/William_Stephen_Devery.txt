William Stephen Devery (January 9, 1854 â€“ June 20, 1919) was the last superintendent 
of the New York City Police Department police commission and the first 
police chief in 1898.[1][2] Devery and Frank J. Farrell later co-owned 
the New York Yankees baseball team. He was born in New York City in 1854. 
In 1878, at age 24, he was hired as a patrolman. On September 16, 1881, 
he was made a roundsman, and on May 28, 1884, he was promoted to a sergeant. 
On December 30, 1891, after 13 years on the force, he was promoted to captain. 
As a police captain he once told his men, "They tell me there's a lot of 
grafting going on in this precinct. They tell me that you fellows are the 
fiercest ever on graft. Now that's going to stop! If there's any grafting 
to be done, I'll do it. Leave it to me."[3] On February 5, 1897, he was 
arrested and charged with bribery and extortion. After conviction, he was 
dismissed from the force. He appealed his conviction in the New York Court 
of Appeals. It was overturned and he was reinstated to the force and promoted 
to inspector on January 7, 1898, and Deputy Chief on February 14, 1898. 
He was then appointed Chief of Police on June 30, 1898.[1][4] In 1899, 
Theodore Roosevelt and Republican state legislators established a committee, 
headed by Robert Mazet, to investigate Tammany Hall corruption under the 
leadership of Richard Croker.[1] Lincoln Steffens, a popular journalist 
of that time wrote of Devery, "As a Chief of Police, he is a disgrace, 
but as a character, he is a work of art."[3] In 1901, the Police Department 
was re-organized again, and has been headed ever since by a Police Commissioner. 
The first Commissioner Michael C. Murphy appointed Devery as his Deputy 
Commissioner. Both Murphy and Devery went out of office on January 1, 1902, 
when Seth Low became Mayor of New York. Later, with Frank J. Farrell, he 
bought the Baltimore, Maryland American League baseball team and moved 
it to New York and renamed it the Highlanders. The team almost won the 
American League pennant in 1904, but otherwise had poor records during 
the Farrell-Devery ownership era. For $300K, they sold the team in 1915 
to Jacob Ruppert, Jr. and Tillinghast L' Hommedieu Huston.[5][6][7][8] 
He died on June 20, 1919 at 4:15 p.m. of apoplexy in Far Rockaway, New
