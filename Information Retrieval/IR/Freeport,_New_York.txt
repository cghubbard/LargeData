Freeport (officially The Incorporated Village of Freeport) is a village 
in the town of Hempstead, Nassau County, New York, USA, on the South Shore 
of Long Island. The population was 43,713 at the 2010 census.[2] A settlement 
since the 1640s, it was once an oystering community and later a resort 
popular with the New York City theater community. It is now primarily a 
bedroom suburb but retains a modest commercial waterfront and some light 
industry. Freeport lies on the South Shore of Long Island,[3] in the southwestern 
part of Nassau County, within the town of Hempstead. Freeport has its own 
municipal electric utility, and police, fire, and water departments. Freeport 
is New York State's second-biggest village[4] and has a station on the 
Long Island Rail Road. The south part of the village is penetrated by several 
canals that allow access to the Atlantic Ocean by means of passage through 
salt marshes. The oldest canal is the late 19th-century Woodcleft Canal.[3] 
Freeport has extensive small-boat facilities and a resident fishing fleet, 
as well as charter and open water fishing boats. Freeport is located at 
40°39′14″N 73°35′13″W﻿ / ﻿40.65389°N 73.58694°W﻿ / 40.65389; -73.58694 
(40.653935, −73.587005).[5] The village is bisected by east-west New York 
State Route 27 (Sunrise Highway). Meadowbrook Parkway defines its eastern 
boundary.[citation needed] Baldwin lies to the west, Merrick to the east, 
and Roosevelt to the north. Freeport is bounded to the south by salt flats 
and bays. Freeport's government is made up of four trustees and a mayor, 
who are elected to four-year terms; one trustee also serves in the capacity 
of deputy mayor. Freeport's first African American mayor, Andrew Hardwick, 
was elected in 2009; he was succeeded on March 20, 2013 by Robert T. Kennedy[4] 
The current Deputy Mayor is (Trustee) Jorge Martinez. The other current 
Trustees are, Carmen Piñeyro, Ronald Ellerbe, and Debra S. Mulé. Freeport's 
current government is a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans. 
As of the census[8] of 2000, there were 43,783 people, 13,504 households, 
and 9,911 families residing in the village. The population density was 
9,531.3 people per square mile (3,682.9/km²). There were 13,819 housing 
units at an average density of 3,008.3 per square mile (1,162.4/km²). The 
racial makeup of the village was 42.9% White, 32.6% African American, 0.5% 
Native American, 1.4% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 17.2% from other races, 
and 5.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.5% 
of the population.[9] There were 13,504 households out of which 36.4% had 
children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.7% were married couples 
living together, 17.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 26.6% were non-families. 21.2% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 8.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 3.20 and the average family size was 3.65. In 
the village the population was spread out with 26.4% under the age of 18, 
9.1% from 18 to 24, 32.1% from 25 to 44, 22.0% from 45 to 64, and 10.5% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 
100 females there were 92.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 89.3 males. The median income for a household in the village 
in 1999 was $55,948, and the median income for a family was $61,673. Males 
had a median income of $37,465 versus $31,869 for females. The per capita 
income for the village was $21,288. About 8.0% of families and 10.6% of 
the population were below the poverty line, including 11.5% of those under 
age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over. As of 2010, the population was 
42,860. The demographics were as follows:[10] Freeport is served by the 
Freeport station on the Long Island Rail Road Babylon Branch. It is also 
a hub for several Nassau Inter-County Express bus routes. Before people 
of European ancestry came to the area, the land was part of the territory 
of the Meroke Indians.[11][12] Written records of the community go back 
to the 1640s.[12] The village now known as Freeport was part of an area 
called "the Great South Woods" during colonial times.[12] In the mid-17th 
century, the area was renamed Raynor South, and ultimately Raynortown, 
after a herdsman named Edward Raynor, who had moved to the area from Hempstead 
in 1659, cleared land, and built a cabin.[3][12][13] In 1853, residents 
voted to rename the village Freeport, adopting a variant of a nickname 
used by ship captains during colonial times because they were not charged 
customs duties to land their cargo.[3][12][13] After the Civil War, Freeport 
became a center for commercial oystering. This trade began to decline as 
early as the beginning of the 20th century because of changing salinity 
and increased pollution in Great South Bay.[11] Nonetheless, even as of 
the early 21st century Freeport and nearby Point Lookout have the largest 
concentration of commercial fishing activity anywhere near New York City.[14] 
From 1868, Freeport was served by the Southside Railroad, which was a major 
boon to development. The most prominent figure in this boom was developer 
John J. Randall; among his other contributions to the shape of Freeport 
today were several canals, including the Woodcleft Canal, one side of which 
is now the site of the "Nautical Mile".[11] Randall, who opposed all of 
Freeport's being laid out in a grid, put up a Victorian house virtually 
overnight on a triangular plot at the corner of Lena Avenue and Wilson 
Place to spite the grid designers.[15] The Freeport Spite House still is 
standing and occupied.[15] In January 1873, before Nassau County had split 
off from Queens, the Queens County treasurer set up an office at Freeport.[16] 
The village residents voted to incorporate the village on October 18, 1892.[3][12] 
At that time, it had a population of 1,821.[13] In 1898, Freeport established 
a municipal electric utility, which still operates today, giving the village 
lower electricity rates than those in surrounding communities.[11] It is 
one of two municipally owned electric systems in Nassau County; the other 
is in Rockville Centre.[17] Public street lighting was begun in 1907, and 
a public fire alarm system was adopted in 1910.[18] In the years after 
incorporation, Freeport was a tourist and sportsman's destination for its 
boating and fishing. From 1902 into the late 1920s, the New York and Long 
Island Traction Corporation ran trolleys through Freeport to Jamaica, Hempstead, 
and Brooklyn. These trolleys went down Main Street in Freeport, connecting 
to a ferry near Woodcleft Avenue. The ferries took people to Point Lookout, 
about three miles (5 km) south of Freeport, where there is an ocean beach. 
For a few years after 1913, the short-lived Freeport Railroad ran a train 
nicknamed "the Fishermen's Delight" along Grove Street (now Guy Lombardo 
Avenue) from Sunrise Highway to the waterfront.[11] Also in this era, in 
1910 Arthur and Albert Heinrich flew the first American-made, American-powered 
monoplane, built in their Merrick Road airplane factory (see also Heinrich 
Pursuit).[11] WGBB, founded in 1924, became Long Island's first 24-hour 
radio station.[11] In the late 19th century, Freeport was the summer resort 
of wealthy politicians, publishers, and so forth. At the time, travel from 
Freeport to New York City required a journey of several hours on a coal-powered 
train, or an even more arduous automobile trip on the single-lane Merrick 
Road. According to Elinor Smith, the arrival of Diamond Jim Brady and Lillian 
Russell around the start of the 20th century marked the beginning of what 
by 1914 would become an unofficial theatrical artists' colony, especially 
of vaudeville performers.[19] Freeport's population was largest in the 
summer season, during which most of the theaters of the time were closed 
and performers left for cooler climes.[11] Some had year-round family homes 
in Freeport.[20] Leo Carrillo and Victor Moore were early arrivals,[21] 
later joined by Fannie Brice, Trixie Friganza, Sophie Tucker, Harry Ruby,[22] 
Fred Stone, Helen Broderick, Moran and Mack, Will Rogers, Bert Kalmar, 
Richard Whiting, Harry von Tilzer, Rae Samuels, Belle Baker, Grace Hayes, 
Pat Rooney, Duffy and Sweeney, the Four Mortons, McKay and Ardine, and 
Eva Tanguay. Buster Keaton, W. C. Fields, and many other theatrical performers 
who did not own homes there were also frequent visitors.[21] Several of 
Freeport's actors gathered together as the Long Island Good Hearted Thespian 
Society (LIGHTS), with a clubhouse facing onto Great South Bay.[11][23] 
LIGHTS presented summer shows in Freeport from the mid-1910s to the mid-1920s.[11] 
LIGHTS also sponsored a summertime "Christmas Parade", featuring clowns, 
acrobats, and once even some borrowed elephants. It was held at this unlikely 
time of year because the theater people were all working during the real 
Christmas season.[24] A Coney Island–style amusement park called Playland 
Park thrived from the early 1920s until the early 1930s but was destroyed 
by a fire on June 28, 1931.[25][26] With the resurgence of the Ku Klux 
Klan on Long Island in the 1920s many villages in Nassau and Suffolk counties 
were the focal point of Klan activity. According to a story in Newsday 
detailing the history of Long Island, "often, respected clergymen and public 
officials openly supported the Klan and attended its rallies. On Sept. 
20, 1924, for instance, the Klan drew 30,000 spectators to a parade through 
Freeport – with the village police chief, John M. Hartman, leading a procession 
of 2,000 robed men.... the founding of one of Long Island's first klaverns, 
in Freeport, was memorialized on Sept. 8, 1922, in the Daily Review, which 
carried a banner headline about the meeting at Mechanics Hall on Railroad 
Avenue. About 150 new members were greeted by seven robed Klansmen."[27] 
By 1937, Freeport's population exceeded 20,000, and it was the largest 
village in Nassau County.[13] After World War II the village became a bedroom 
community for New York City. The separation between the two eras was marked 
by a fire that destroyed the Shorecrest Hotel (originally the Crystal Lake 
Hotel) on January 14, 1958.[26] During the 1950s local merchants resisted 
building any shopping malls in the village and subsequently suffered a 
great loss of business when large malls were built in communities in the 
central part of Long Island. The landscape of Freeport underwent further 
change with a significant increase in apartment building construction. 
When such buildings went up in just two years in the early 1960s, the Village 
passed a moratorium on multi-unit residential construction.[28] While never 
a major boatbuilding center, Freeport can boast some notable figures in 
that field. Fred and Mirto Scopinich operated their boatyard in Freeport 
from just after World War I until they moved it to East Quogue in the late 
1960s. Their Freeport Point Shipyard built boats for the United States 
Coast Guard, but also for Prohibition-era rumrunners.[29] From 1937 to 
1945 the shipyard built small boats for the United States Navy and British 
Royal Navy.[11] The marina and dealership operated by Al Grover in 1950 
remains in Freeport and in his family. Grover's company built fishing skiffs 
from the 1970s until about 1990. One of these, a 26-footer, carried Grover 
and his sons from Nova Scotia to Portugal in 1985, the first-ever crossing 
of the Atlantic Ocean by a boat powered by an outboard motor.[11] Columbian 
Bronze operated in Freeport from its 1901 founding until it closed shop 
in 1988. Among this company's achievements was the propeller for the USS Nautilus, 
an operational nuclear-powered submarine and the first vessel to complete 
a submerged transit across the North Pole.[11] Freeport is a Long Island 
hot spot during the summer season in New York. A popular festival occurs 
on Freeport's Nautical Mile (the west side of Woodcleft Canal) the first 
weekend in June each year, which attracts many people from across Long 
Island and New York City. The Nautical Mile is a strip along the water 
that features well-known seafood restaurants, crab shacks, bars, eclectic 
little boutiques, fresh fish markets, as well as party cruise ships and 
casino boats that float atop the canals. People line up for the boat rides 
and eat at restaurants that feature seating on the water's edge and servings 
of mussels, oysters, crabs, and steamed clams ("steamers") accompanied 
by pitchers of beer. An 18-hole miniature golf course is popular among 
families. The Sea Breeze waterfront park—which includes a transient marina, 
boardwalk, rest rooms and benches—opened in 2009 at the foot of the Nautical 
Mile. It has proven to be a very popular spot to sit and watch the marine 
traffic and natural scenery. This is in addition to an existing scenic 
pier. Freeport has an ethnically and racially diverse population. There 
is one housing project, named after Nassau County's first black judge, 
Moxie Rigby. Freeport's Hispanic community is made up of Puerto Ricans 
and immigrants who hail from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and many other Latin American nations. Among the many 
Latin-American-themed businesses are the Compare Foods Supermarkets, several 
grocery stores, and restaurants along Merrick Road and Main Street that 
serve Caribbean, Central American, Dominican, and South American cuisines. 
Freeport, along with neighboring Merrick, is also the gateway to Jones 
Beach, one of the largest state beaches in New York. One famous area is 
the Town of Hempstead Marina, where people from all over Long Island dock 
their boats. Freeport is a 45-minute ride by the Long Island Rail Road 
to Manhattan, making the trip an easy commute to New York City. From 1974 
to 1986, Freeport was one of the few Long Island towns to hold a sizeable 
open-air market area, known as the Freeport Mall.[30] The heart of the 
Main Street business area was closed to vehicular traffic and reconfigured 
for pedestrians only. The experiment was not a success. The W. T. Grant 
store that was supposed to anchor the mall closed, along with the rest 
of that chain, shortly after the mall opened. The mall area became shabby 
and disused, and many businesses failed. The mall was dismantled and returned 
to through traffic with regular parking on each side of the street.[31] 
Just north of the high school and the railroad tracks is the ruin of the 
former Brooklyn Water Works, described by Christopher Gray of the New York 
Times as looking like an "ancient, war-damaged abbey." Designed by architect 
Frank Freeman and opened in 1891 to serve the City of Brooklyn (later made 
a borough of New York City), it was fully active until 1929 with a capacity 
of 54 million gallons a day, and remained in standby for emergency use 
until 1977, when the pumps and other machinery were removed. See Ridgewood 
Reservoir. An unsuccessful 1989 plan would have turned the building into 
condos.[32][33] Currently, the parcel is the subject of litigation and 
ongoing investigations by various agencies. Long Island Traditions also 
describes the sites of notable architecture in Freeport's history, such 
as bay men's homes[34] and commercial fishing establishments,[35] some 
of which are still existing, as well as the still-existing Fiore’s Fish 
Market and Two Cousins, which are located in historic waterfront buildings, 
built by the owners, so they could negotiate directly with the baymen as 
they pulled into dock.[36] Long Island Traditions also describes and provides 
a photograph of the no-longer existing Woodcleft Hotel[37] and important 
boatyards, about which the site writes:[38] In Freeport the Maresca boatyard 
stands on the site of what is now the Long Island Marine Education Center 
owned by the Village of Freeport. Founded in the 1920s by Phillip Maresca, 
they built both recreational and commercial boats. Their customers included 
Guy Lombardo and party boat captains. The business was taken over by Everett 
Maresca, who died in 1995. The original building remains relatively intact, 
consisting of a large concrete block structure. Further down on Woodcleft 
Canal stands the former Scopinich Boatyard, now part of Shelter Point Marine 
services. The structure is obscured by corrugated metal siding but elements 
of its original frame structure remain. The yard was founded by Fred Scopinich, 
a Greek immigrant in the early 1900s. His grandson Fred moved the yard 
to East Quogue. The Freeport yard specialized in building commercial fishing 
boats including trawlers, government boats for the Coast Guard, rum running 
boats, as well as sailboats and garveys for local baymen. Finally the original 
Grover boatyard, founded by Al Grover, stands on Woodcleft Avenue a short 
distance from the Maresca yard. A modest frame building, approximately 
20 people worked there. Today the yard is located north of the Nautical 
Mile on South Main street, run by Grover’s sons. Their yard consists of 
modern corrugated structures used primarily for maintenance and storage. 
The Freeport Memorial Library is one of Nassau County's largest public 
libraries. The library was founded in 1884 as part of the school system, 
granted a provisional charter by the state Board of Regents in 1895, and 
a permanent charter on December 21, 1899. In 1911 it was moved from a school 
building to a rented room in the Miller Building on South Grove Street. 
At that time it was a membership library: members paid ten cents for a 
card and were permitted to borrow two books at a time, one fiction and 
one nonfiction.[39] A drive was started in 1920 to construct a library 
building. The resulting library at the corner of Merrick Road and Ocean 
Avenue, a Beaux Arts building designed by architect Charles M. Hart, opened 
on Memorial Day, 1924. A year later it was renamed Freeport Memorial Library. 
In 1928, a tablet was erected with the names of Freeport's war dead from 
the American Civil War, Spanish–American War, and World War I.[39] Additional 
wings were dedicated on April 19, 1959, and on Memorial Day, 1985. Plaques 
were added to honor Freeporters who died in World War II, the Korean War, 
and the Vietnam War.[39] For the 2009–10 school year, there were 6,257 
students enrolled in Freeport's public schools.[40] The children of Freeport, 
in grades 1–4, attend four magnet elementary schools, each with a different 
specialty: Archer Street (Microsociety and Multimedia), Leo F. Giblyn (School 
of International Cultures), Bayview Avenue (School of Arts and Sciences), 
and New Visions (School of Exploration & Discovery). In grades 5 and 6, 
all public school children attend Caroline G. Atkinson School on the north 
side of the town. Seventh and 8th graders attend John W. Dodd Middle School. 
The Middle School is built on the property that housed the older Freeport 
High School, but not on exactly the same site. The old high school served 
for some years as the junior high; then the new junior high was built on 
what was previously parking lot and playground, and the old building was 
torn down. A Catholic school, the De La Salle School, is run by the Christian 
Brothers and accepts boys from grades 5–8. Children in grades 9–12 attend 
Freeport High School, which borders the town of Baldwin and sits beside 
the Milburn duck pond, which is fed by a creek, several hundred yards of 
which was diverted underground when the high school was built. Freeport 
High School's mascot is the Red Devil, and its colors are red and white. 
The school has track-and-field facilities. One unique feature of the school's 
curriculum is a science research program run in cooperation with the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook. The school offers numerous advanced 
placement courses and was a pioneer in distance learning at the high school 
level. Roughly 87 percent of the high school's graduates go on to some 
form of higher education. A community night school for teenagers had 236 
students as of 1999.[25] As early as 1886, Freeport's schools began the 
then-unusual policy of providing their students with free textbooks. In 
1893, the newly incorporated village constructed a ten-room brick schoolhouse. 
Also in the late 19th century, the community was among the first Long Island 
communities to establish an "academic department", offering classes beyond 
the elementary school level.[41] Freeport saw its share of the social, 
political, and racial turbulence of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The 
1969–70 school year saw three high school principals in the village's only 
high school, succeeded in August 1970 by William McElroy, formerly the 
junior high school principal, who came to the position "in the midst of 
racial tension and a constantly-polarizing student body";[42] McElroy backed 
such initiatives as a student advisory committee to the Board of Education 
and, in his own words, "made [him]self available to any civic-minded group" 
that wished to discuss with him the situation in the school. By May 1972, 
he could claim success, of a sort. "Formerly, a fight between a black and 
a white student would automatically become racial; now a fight is just 
a fight—between two students."[42] The Freeport High School newspaper, 
Flashings, founded 1920, is believed to be the oldest high school paper 
on Long Island.[43] It has won numerous awards over several decades.[44] 
From 1969 until 1999, it operated under "free press" guidelines unusual 
for a high school newspaper, with an active role for the students in picking 
their own faculty adviser and with ultimate editorial control firmly in 
the hands of students.[43][44] Throughout that time, Ira Schildkraut functioned 
as faculty adviser.[43][44] In 1999, the school administration removed 
Schildkraut from that role and attempted to establish themselves as censors.[43][44] 
That last decision was turned back by the school board after it drew attention 
from, among others, The New York Times and the Student Press Law Center. 
However, the dispute's resolution did reduce the student journalists' role 
in selecting their own faculty adviser and increased the faculty adviser's 
editorial authority relative to the student journalists'.[44] From about 
1970 to 1973, the town and Freeport High School achieved recognition because 
of the performance of its math team ("The Mathletes") in regional inter-school 
math competitions and performance on advanced mathematics tests, including 
the International Mathematical Olympiad and those from the Mathematical 
Association of America (MAA). In addition, in about 1970, Freeport High 
School became one of the few schools in the country then to have a general 
purpose computer on the premises dedicated to student use and teaching 
programming, an IBM 1620 donated by IBM. The 1620 was later replaced by 
remote access to a DEC System 10 then, later, an on-site PDP-11/40 running 
the RSTS/E time sharing system, also dedicated to the students. Much credit 
for the team and computers goes to FHS math teachers and to the Freeport 
School District's head of Mathematics, Joseph Holbrook. In June 2008, 16 
people were arrested after violence erupted in the high school.[45] In 
a 2010 Newsday story regarding Long Island eighth-grader scores on Regents 
Exams, which have traditionally been given to students in ninth grade and 
up, Freeport was ranked in the highest tier.[46] In the early 1930s, Freeport 
was the playing field for the Pennsylvania Red Caps of New York, a semi-pro 
baseball team which took their name from the caps worn by Pullman porters. 
For a few years after that, the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers football team, which, 
like their Los Angeles Dodgers baseball namesakes, played at Ebbets Field, 
using the stadium as a midweek training site.[11] The site is now a Warehouse 
BJ's Wholesale Club. From 1931 until the early 1980s, Freeport was home 
to Freeport Speedway,[47] originally Freeport Municipal Stadium. Seating 
about 10,000, the stadium originally hosted "midget" auto races; after 
World War II it switched to stock car racing and eventually demolition 
derbies.[48] Freeport is home to the Freeport Recreation Center, which 
features an enclosed, year-round ice skating rink; an indoor pool; an outdoor 
Olympic-size pool; an outdoor diving tank; an outdoor children's pool; 
handball courts; sauna; steam room; fully equipped workout gyms; basketball 
courts; and snack bars serving hot and cold foods. The "Rec Center" also 
offers evening adult classes and hosts a pre-school program, camp programs,
