Jorge Carlos Soler Castillo (born February 25, 1992) is a Cuban professional 
baseball outfielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Soler played for the Cuban national baseball team in international competition. 
He defected from Cuba in 2011, seeking a career in MLB. After establishing 
his residency in Haiti, Soler signed a nine-year contract with the Cubs. 
He made his MLB debut in 2014. While primarily a right fielder during his 
first two seasons for the Cubs, Soler has since transitioned to left field 
for the Cubs. Soler played for the Cuban national baseball team in the 
2010 World Junior Baseball Championship, where he had a .304 batting average, 
.500 on-base percentage, and .522 slugging percentage. His nine walks were 
the second most in the tournament.[1] Cuba won the bronze medal. Soler 
also played briefly in the Cuban National Series. Soler defected from Cuba 
in 2011 to pursue his career in Major League Baseball (MLB). He established 
residency in Haiti.[2] Soler was unblocked by the Office of Foreign Assets 
Control on June 2, 2012, making him a MLB free agent. As a free agent, 
many teams were involved in bidding on Soler's services.[3] On June 11, 
2012, Soler reportedly agreed to a nine-year $30 million contract with 
the Chicago Cubs.[4] The Cubs had reportedly agreed to a deal with Soler 
before he was declared a free agent, though Cubs general manager Jed Hoyer 
denied this.[5] Soler is 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and weighs 215 pounds 
(98 kg). He was described as a power-hitting outfielder who would likely 
play right field. Jim Callis of Baseball America described Soler in 2011 
as "a 19-year-old athlete with five-tool potential."[6] According to Callis, 
Soler likely would have been a top-five pick in the 2010 draft had he been 
eligible. Kevin Goldstein of Baseball Prospectus did not rank Soler in 
his list of the top baseball prospects prior to the 2012 season, but said 
he would have ranked Soler as the 38th or 39th best prospect if he were 
eligible.[7] Some teams preferred Soler to higher profile Cuban defector 
Yoenis Cespedes.[8] Keith Law of ESPN.com indicated that Soler had the 
talent of a top-five draft choice in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, 
had he been eligible to be drafted.[9] Writing for Fox News, Mauricio Rubio 
wrote that "Early in his career he was benched for not hustling, and in 
a separate incident he ran toward an opposing dugout with a bat."[10] Writing 
for the Sporting News, Jeff Mans noted that: "The biggest issue with Soler 
aside from the hamstring injuries is his temper.... He started out on the 
wrong foot with the Cubs after failing to report to minor league camp shortly 
after signing his nine-year, $30 million deal, feeling that he should have 
been in Chicago immediately. The other scare for the Cubs brass was his 
relative inability to hit righthanded pitching."[11] According to Statcast, 
Soler's average launch speed is 91.39 miles per hour (147.08 km/h) in 2016.[12] 
On April 10, 2013, while playing on the Daytona Cubs of the Class A-Advanced 
Florida State League, immediately following a bench-clearing incident, 
Soler charged the opposing Clearwater Threshers' dugout while brandishing 
a baseball bat.[13][14] He was ejected from the game, was fined, and received 
a five-game suspension.[14] Soler began the 2014 season with the Tennessee 
Smokies of the Class AA Southern League. On July 22, 2014, Soler was promoted 
to the Iowa Cubs of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.[15] On August 25, 
2014, Soler was called up to the Chicago Cubs for the first time. In his 
major league debut on August 27, facing Cincinnati Reds pitcher Mat Latos, 
Soler hit a home run in his first major league at-bat,[16] becoming the 
117th player in MLB history to do so.[17] On September 1 Soler had two 
doubles in his home debut for the Cubs to become just the third major league 
player in the last 100 years to have at least one extra-base hit in each 
of his first five games in the majors.[18] Two days later Soler became 
the second player in Cubs history with as many as 10 RBIs in his first 
seven games as a major leaguer. Soler was the starting right fielder for 
the Cubs 2015 season until an ankle injury sidelined him in early June. 
He returned to the starting lineup on July 5 after spending time in rehab.[19] 
He finished the regular season with a .268 batting average, 15 home runs 
and 67 runs-batted-in. In Soler's postseason debut, he walked as a pinch-hitter 
in the ninth inning in Game 1 of the Division Series and followed up with 
a double, two-run home run to straightaway center and two more walks in 
Game 2, and another home run, a single and two walks in Game 3. Record 
setting Soler [20] started his postseason career by reaching base nine 
times in a row, in which he recorded five walks and hit two home runs, 
a double and a single. In Game 4 Soler ended a game-tying St. Louis Cardinals 
sixth inning rally with an outfield assist on a game-saving inning-ending 
put out of Tony Cruz at home plate.[21] The Cubs won the game 6–4 and beat 
the rival St. Louis Cardinals in four games to advance to the National
