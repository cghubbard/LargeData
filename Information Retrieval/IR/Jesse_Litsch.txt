Jesse Allen Litsch (born March 9, 1985) is an American former professional 
baseball pitcher. After working as a batboy for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays,[1] 
he was drafted in the 24th round by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2004, and 
played from 2007 to 2011, when his career was cut short by injuries. In 
March 2016, Litsch became the pitching coach for the Bridgeport Bluefish 
of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. On May 15, 2007, Litsch 
made his Major League debut with the Blue Jays, filling in for the injured 
Roy Halladay. Over 8 2⁄3 innings (the most innings pitched by any Blue 
Jay in his debut), Litsch allowed only 4 hits, with 2 walks and 1 run while 
recording 21 of his 26 outs via groundouts. Litsch became the first Blue 
Jays pitcher to win his debut since Gustavo Chacín beat the New York Yankees 
on September 20, 2004.[2] As a result of his performance, Litsch made three 
more starts with the Jays. He was demoted back to Double-A after posting 
a 0–3 record with a 19.62 ERA in those three starts. After an injury to 
A. J. Burnett, the Blue Jays recalled Litsch and he started against Boston 
on July 15, 2007. He yielded one run on 9 hits over 6 2⁄3 innings with 
2 strikeouts and 1 walk, defeating Josh Beckett and the Boston Red Sox 
2–1. He came home to Tampa Bay on July 31, going 6 2⁄3 innings, giving 
up 7 hits while walking 1 and striking out 2, with no earned runs. Litsch 
finished his first year in the majors 7–9 with a 3.89 ERA and 50 K/36 BB 
over 20 starts.[3] On May 24, 2008, the same day that Litsch pitched his 
first complete game and shutout,[4] he also surpassed Jimmy Key's former 
franchise record by pitching 38 consecutive innings without walking a batter 
(Key's former mark was 34 1⁄3). In 2008, he threw cutters 43.4% of the 
time, the highest rate in the majors.[5] Litsch would finish the 2008 season 
with a record of 13–9, a 3.58 ERA, and 99 strikeouts.[3] On April 14, 2009, 
he was sent to the 15-day DL because of a right forearm strain. On June 
9, it was announced that Litsch would undergo season-ending Tommy John 
surgery. He made his first major league start since surgery on June 13, 
2010 against the Colorado Rockies.[6] Litsch struggled against the Rockies 
in his return from injury. He lasted only 2 1⁄3 innings and allowed 7 runs 
on 9 hits. He regained his previous form in his next start against the 
San Francisco Giants on June 19 by going seven solid innings, allowing 
three hits in a 3-0 win. Litsch was named the number 5 starter for the 
2011 season. He made his 2011 debut on April 6 against the Oakland Athletics, 
getting the win and giving up 6 hits and 3 earned runs while striking out 
7. He finished off the season with a 4.44 ERA and a 6-3 win-loss record 
over 75 innings pitched.[3] Litsch suffered a setback with his injured 
right shoulder early in 2012 training camp, and was shut down because of 
inflammation. He visited surgeon Dr. James Andrews for a full diagnosis 
that confirmed the inflammation and didn't find any structural damage. 
Litsch received a platelet-rich plasmas (PRP) injection to help with the 
healing process. The injection caused an unexpected serious infection, 
and Litsch was not allowed to throw for six weeks after undergoing emergency 
surgery.[7] The infection sidelined him for the entire 2012 season. On 
October 10, 2012, the Blue Jays announced that Litsch was coming off the 
60-day disabled list, but had chosen free agency over an assignment to 
their Triple-A affiliate Buffalo Bisons.[8] In December 2012, it was reported 
that Litsch was awaiting bone-graft and cartilage replacement surgery from 
a donor cadaver, and his career was in serious jeopardy.[9] The surgery 
was performed on January 17, 2013, and Litsch was reported to be hopeful 
to pitch winter ball in late 2013.[10] On August 21, 2014, Litsch announced 
his retirement.[11] He threw out the ceremonial first pitch of the Blue 
Jays-Rays game on September 2, 2014.[12] After retiring, Litsch coached 
middle and high school players at a Major League Baseball development center 
in China. In January 2016, he announced that he would be the pitching coach 
for the Philippines national baseball team in their February World Baseball 
Classic qualifier.[13] On March 1, 2016, the Bridgeport Bluefish hired 
Litsch to be their pitching coach for the 2016 season.[14] Litsch's main 
pitch was his four-seam fastball (87-93 mph), and could throw a two-seam 
fastball with considerable movement. He often used a cutter (85-89 mph) 
and a curveball (73-80 mph), and struggled with command of his changeup
