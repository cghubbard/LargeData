Carlos Eduardo González (born October 17, 1985) (nicknamed CarGo) is a 
Venezuelan professional baseball right fielder for the Colorado Rockies 
of Major League Baseball. A three-time All-Star, González is a former National 
League batting champion. He has also won a Silver Slugger Award and is 
a three-time Gold Glove Award winner. While mainly a left fielder throughout 
his career, Gonzalez became the Rockies starting right fielder in 2015. 
Born in Maracaibo, Venezuela, González was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks 
on August 3, 2002. González began his professional baseball career in 2003 
for the Rookie League Missoula Osprey. González batted just .258 with 6 
home runs in 72 games. In 2004, González split time between the Low Single-A 
Yakima Bears and the Single-A South Bend Silver Hawks. In 85 games, he 
batted .275 with 10 home runs. González played the 2005 season again for 
the Silver Hawks. He led the team in games played (129) and RBIs (92), 
and was also second on the team in batting average (.307), home runs (18), 
at bats (515) and runs scored (91). González was also named to the Midwest 
League midseason and postseason All-Star games and was also named the Midwest 
League Prospect of the Year. Baseball America and Topps each named González 
as a Low Class-A All-Star. Topps also named him as the Midwest League Player 
of the Year. In 2006, Baseball America rated González at #32 on their top 
100 prospects list and was the 6th-highest Diamondbacks player on that 
list. González mainly played for the High Single-A Lancaster JetHawks in 
2006, but also spent some time with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies. González 
played in 122 games and batted .289 with a career high 23 home runs. He 
also led the JetHawks in home runs (21) and RBIs (93). González was also 
an All-Star Futures Game selection and a California League postseason All-Star 
selection. Baseball America rated González as a High Class-A All-Star, 
and he received the same honor from Topps. In 2007, Baseball America rated 
González at #18 on their top 10 prospects list and was the 3rd highest 
Diamondbacks player on that list. González mainly played for the Double-A 
Mobile BayBears, but also spent some time in Triple-A with the Tucson Sidewinders. 
González played in 130 games and batted .288 with 17 home runs. González 
led the BayBears in home runs (16) and RBI (75). González was once again 
named to the All-Star Futures Game. On December 14, 2007, González was 
traded along with Dana Eveland, Aaron Cunningham, Chris Carter, Brett Anderson, 
and Greg Smith to the Oakland Athletics for Dan Haren and Connor Robertson. 
On May 30, 2008, González made his MLB debut at the age of 22 against the 
Texas Rangers, where he got first career hit, an opposite field double 
down the left field line off Texas Rangers pitcher Kevin Millwood. This 
was one of two doubles he hit in his major league debut. His next five 
major league hits were also doubles, making González the first player since 
Hall of Famer Johnny Mize in 1936 to record the first seven hits of his 
career as extra base hits.[1] On June 20, 2008, González hit his first 
career home run against the Florida Marlins. It was a solo home run that 
was hit off a curveball to right-center field. He had his first 4-hit game, 
going 4 for 4 against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 8. On November 12, 
2008, González was traded with Huston Street and Greg Smith to the Colorado 
Rockies for Matt Holliday.[2] After what many called a disappointing season 
with Oakland, González spent most of the season with the Rockies Triple-A 
affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. After a series of injuries to 
the Rockies outfield, González was called up and started slow, but eventually 
began to produce, proving himself as a nice combination of power and speed 
atop the lineup. In the 2009 National League Division Series against the 
Philadelphia Phillies, González tied the franchise record for the most 
hits in an NLDS with 10, and led the NLDS and ALDS in batting average with 
.588 in four games. In his 2010 season, he finished in the top 5 in home 
runs, batting average, RBIs, and runs scored in the National League. On 
July 31, 2010, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, González hit for the 
cycle, including a walk-off home run on the first pitch in the bottom of 
the 9th inning. He became the first player since Dwight Evans of the Boston 
Red Sox in 1984 to hit a walk-off home run for the cycle, according to 
the Elias Sports Bureau. Manager Jim Tracy labeled González as not just 
a five-tool player, but a "six-tool player."[3] In 2010, González garnered 
serious consideration as a candidate for the National League MVP award, 
along with St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols and Cincinnati 
Reds first baseman Joey Votto, as well as a Triple Crown candidate with 
the above-mentioned first basemen.[4][5] However, González fell short on 
home runs and narrowly missed having the most RBI, but did manage to win 
the NL batting title in 2010 with a .336 average. He finished with 34 home 
runs, 117 RBI and a National League-leading 197 hits. González received 
the National League Players Choice Award for Outstanding Player in 2010.[6] 
He then won the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year throughout 
Major League Baseball.[7] González was also voted the winner of the 2010 
Luis Aparicio Award, which is given to the most outstanding Venezuelan 
player in Major League Baseball, as voted by Venezuelan and international 
Spanish-speaking media.[8] He finished third in voting by the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America for National League MVP.[9] For his defensive 
efforts in 2010, in which he only committed one error in the outfield, 
González won his first Gold Glove.[10] On the offensive side, González 
received his first Silver Slugger Award.[11] González signed a seven-year, 
$80.5 million contract extension with the Rockies on January 11, 2011. 
The contract included a $3 million signing bonus and yearly salaries through 
2017 that ramp up to $20 million. It is the largest contract in MLB history 
for a two-year player. On May 21, 2012, he became the 22nd player in MLB 
history to hit a home run in four consecutive at-bats, doing this during 
a two-game span against the Houston Astros. In early July 2011, Gonzalez 
injured his right wrist and was placed on the disabled list. On July 21, 
2011, he yet again injured the wrist against the Atlanta Braves. On May 
14, 2013, he went 5-for-5 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, hitting 
2 home runs and setting a new career high with 5 hits in one game. On June 
5, 2013, he hit 3 home runs against the Cincinnati Reds at Great American 
Ball Park in a 12-4 victory. In 2014, with the breakout of Corey Dickerson, 
González was moved out to right field. González won a Silver Slugger Award 
in right field for the 2015 season after hitting 40 home runs, second most 
in the National League. He was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. Gonzalez married 
a Venezuelan woman named Indonesia Riera on October 20, 2012.[12] [13]
