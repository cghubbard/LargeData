Deadspin is a sports website owned by Univision Communications that was 
originally launched by Gawker Media in September 2005.[2] The site posts 
commentaries, recaps, and previews of the major sports stories of the day, 
as well as sports-related anecdotes, rumors and YouTube videos. The last 
post each evening is tagged "DUAN" and means Deadspin Up All Night, often 
taking on a life of its own and featuring wildly diverse (and not necessarily 
related to sport) commentary. Like Gawker.com, stories on Deadspin come 
from anonymous tips, readers, and other sports blogs.[3] Deadspin includes 
two sub-sites that do not solely focus on sports: The humor section Adequate 
Man [4] and The Concourse, which features articles on music, food and culture.[5] 
Deadspin's founding editor-in-chief was Will Leitch, author and a founding 
editor of the New York Cityâ€“based culture website, "The Black Table". Leitch 
announced on June 5, 2008 that he would be leaving to take a position at 
New York magazine.[6] He was replaced by A. J. Daulerio, former senior 
writer for the site.[7] Time magazine named the site one of the 50 coolest 
websites of 2006.[8] Deadspin broke the story of NFL quarterback Brett 
Favre's alleged sexual misconduct toward journalist Jenn Sterger.[9][10] 
Deadspin broke the story of Sarah Phillips, a reporter hired by ESPN who 
lied about her identity and credentials to staffers in order to gain employment.[11] 
Deadspin broke the news that the reported September 2012 death of the girlfriend 
of Notre Dame All-American linebacker Manti Te'o, which Te'o had said inspired 
him during the 2012 season, was apparently a hoax. Deadspin found no evidence 
that the girlfriend had ever existed, much less died.[12][13] Deadspin 
received attention for "buying" a vote for the Baseball Hall of Fame election 
in 2013. The site announced in late November 2013 that it had acquired 
a vote from a BBWAA writer which was "purchased" not through a cash payment 
to the writer, but instead to a charity of the writer's choice.[14] On 
January 8, after the Hall of Fame voting was announced, Deadspin revealed 
that its voter was Miami Herald sportswriter Dan Le Batard. Le Batard was 
heavily criticized by fellow sportswriters for "selling" his vote.[15] 
The BBWAA permanently revoked his Hall of Fame voting privileges and suspended 
his membership for one year.[16] On October 15, 2014, Deadspin published 
an article which alleged that Cory Gardner, the Republican who ran for 
senate in Colorado, had faked his high school football career. Later that 
day, Gardner tweeted photographic evidence of himself in his football uniform 
as a teenager, and the main source of the story said the report mischaracterized 
his comments.[17] Deadspin updated the article with an editor's note which 
stated the correct information.[18][19] Republican-aligned blog The Washington 
Free Beacon criticized the article as a "politically-motivated hit."[20] 
The current masthead[21] consists of editor-in-chief Tim Marchman, deputy 
editor Barry Petchesky, news editor Tom Ley, contributing editor Drew Magary, 
along with a staff of full-time writers and regular contributors. Deadspin 
was one of six websites that was purchased by Univision Communications
