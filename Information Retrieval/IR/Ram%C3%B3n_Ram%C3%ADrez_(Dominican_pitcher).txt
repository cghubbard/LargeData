Ramón Santo Ramírez (born August 31, 1981) is a Dominican relief pitcher 
for the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican Baseball League. He pitched 
for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), and 
the Colorado Rockies, Kansas City Royals, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco 
Giants, New York Mets, and Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Ramírez was signed by the Texas Rangers in 1996, as an infielder. After 
one season in their minor leagues, he was released. He spent the next three 
years learning how to pitch before joining the Hiroshima Toyo Carp's Dominican 
academy in 2000. He pitched in two games with the Carp in 2002 and was 
signed by the New York Yankees in 2003. He spent 2.5 years in their minor 
leagues before getting traded to the Colorado Rockies in the middle of 
the 2005 season. Shortly after the 2006 season started, Ramírez was called 
up by the Rockies, and he went on to have a successful rookie season for 
them. In 2007, he had an 8.31 ERA with the Rockies and spent time on the 
disabled list and in the minor leagues. Before the 2008 season, he was 
traded to the Kansas City Royals. After one season with the Royals, he 
was traded to the Boston Red Sox. In 2009, his seven wins were tied for 
third among relief pitchers in the American League. After an inconsistent 
start to the 2010 season, Ramírez was traded to the San Francisco Giants. 
He posted a 0.67 ERA with the Giants, helping them reach the playoffs. 
He gave up runs in 4 of the 5 playoff games he pitched in, but the Giants 
won their first World Series since 1954. In 2011, Ramírez posted a career-best 
2.62 ERA and was traded to the New York Mets after the season. On December 
27, 1996, the Texas Rangers signed Ramírez as an infielder, believing him 
to be 16 instead of 15.[1][2] After one season with their Dominican affiliate, 
he was released on June 4, 1998.[3] After being released by the Rangers, 
Ramírez got a job at a Coca-Cola bottling plant while learning how to pitch.[4] 
In 2000, he attended the Hiroshima Toyo Carp's academy in the Dominican 
Republic, and he appeared in two games for the Carp in 2002.[1] He gave 
up one run in three innings while striking out three batters and walking 
two,[5] and he was posted in 2003.[1] The winning bid was placed by the 
New York Yankees, who signed him on March 5, 2003, and assigned him to 
their minor league system.[1][3] Ramírez began his minor league career 
in 2003 with the Tampa Yankees of the single-A advanced Florida State League. 
After he had a 2–8 record, a 5.21 earned run average (ERA), 21 strikeouts, 
and 21 1⁄3 innings pitched in 14 starts, he was promoted to the Trenton 
Thunder of the Double-A Eastern League. With the Thunder, he had a 1–1 
record, a 1.69 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 21 1⁄3 innings pitched in four games 
(three starts), and this earned him a promotion to the Columbus Clippers 
of the triple-A International League. In two games (one start) with Columbus, 
he had an 0–1 record, a 4.50 ERA, five strikeouts, and six innings pitched. 
He finished his first minor league season with a 3–10 record, a 4.43 ERA, 
96 strikeouts, and 101 2⁄3 innings pitched in 20 games (18 starts).[6] 
In 2004, Ramírez began the year with Columbus.[7] After he had an 0–3 record, 
an 8.50 ERA, 17 strikeouts, and 18 innings pitched in four starts, he was 
demoted to Trenton on May 1.[6][7] On August 17, he allowed just two hits 
in a 4–1 complete game victory over the Norwich Navigators while setting 
a team record by retiring the last 24 hitters he faced.[7] With Trenton, 
Ramírez had a 4–6 record, a 4.62 ERA, two complete games, 128 strikeouts, 
and 115 innings pitched in 18 starts. His combined minor league totals 
were a 4–9 record, a 5.14 ERA, two complete games, 145 strikeouts, and 
133 innings pitched in 22 starts.[6] Ramírez began the 2005 season with 
Columbus again. After he had a 1–3 record, a 5.33 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 
25 1⁄3 innings pitched in six starts for the Clippers, he was demoted to 
Trenton for the second year in a row.[7] At Trenton, he had a 6–5 record, 
a 3.84 ERA, 82 strikeouts, and 89 innings pitched in 15 starts.[6] On July 
28, the Yankees traded Ramírez and Eduardo Sierra to the Colorado Rockies 
for Shawn Chacón.[8] After being acquired by the Rockies, Ramírez was assigned 
to the Tulsa Drillers of the double-A Texas League.[6] He made three starts 
with the Drillers before getting moved to the bullpen.[7] In 9 games (3 
starts) with Tulsa, Ramírez had a 2–1 record, a 5.33 ERA, 23 strikeouts, 
and 25 1⁄3 innings pitched. His combined minor league totals were a 9–9 
record, a 4.39 ERA, 131 strikeouts, and 141 1⁄3 innings pitched.[6] Ramírez 
began 2006 with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the triple-A Pacific Coast 
League.[6] After throwing a scoreless inning for Colorado Springs, he was 
called up by the Rockies on April 12 when Mike DeJean was placed on the 
disabled list.[9] He made his debut on April 14, pitching two scoreless 
innings in a 10–8 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.[10] Five days later, 
he singled against Chan Ho Park in his first major league at bat in a 13–4 
loss to the San Diego Padres.[11] On April 25, he pitched 2 1⁄3 scoreless 
innings and got his first major league win in a 7–6 victory over the Phillies.[12] 
Ramírez began his career with 15 1⁄3 scoreless innings in 11 games, which 
set a Rockies record for longest streak by a reliever to begin a career.[7] 
It was the longest streak by a reliever to start a career since Jeremy 
Fikac threw 16 scoreless innings to start his career in 2001.[7] Ramírez's 
streak ended on May 15, when he allowed three runs in 1⁄3 of an inning 
and got his first career loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won 
5–4.[13] On August 15, he set a career high with four innings pitched in 
the longest game in Rockies history, an 18-inning game against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. He gave up a run in the 18th and suffered a loss in the 2–1 
defeat.[14] He had a 2.88 ERA in his first 47 games, but he posted a 5.09 
ERA over his final 14 games, raising his season ERA to 3.46.[15] On September 
30, in his final game of the season, he pitched 1 2⁄3 scoreless innings 
and got the win in a 14-inning, 11–9 victory over the Chicago Cubs.[16] 
Ramírez finished the season with a 4–3 record, a 3.46 ERA, 61 strikeouts, 
and 67 2⁄3 innings pitched in 61 games. His 61 games were the third-most 
by a Rockies' rookie pitcher, behind Steve Reed (64 in 1993) and Javier 
López (75 in 2003).[7] Ramírez began the 2007 season with seven straight 
scoreless appearances for the Rockies. On April 21, he was placed on the 
disabled list (DL) (retroactive to May 18) with a sprained right elbow.[17] 
He returned from the DL on May 15.[18] After stretching his scoreless start 
to eight games, he posted a 22.24 ERA over his next seven games.[19] On 
May 20, he gave up a career-high five runs in 2⁄3 innings and got the loss 
in a 10–5 defeat to the Kansas City Royals.[20] On June 7, he was optioned 
to Colorado Springs as Josh Fogg came off the disabled list.[21] Ramírez 
was recalled on July 20 to replace Tom Martin, who was designated for assignment.[22] 
After six games, he was returned to Colorado Springs as Ryan Speier was 
called up.[23] A week later, he was recalled when Willy Taveras was placed 
on the disabled list,[24] but he was returned to the minors two days later 
after appearing in one game.[7] On September 8, he was called up and placed 
on the 60-day disabled list with elbow inflammation so the Rockies could 
put Josh Newman on their roster.[25] Ramírez finished the season with a 
2–2 record, an 8.31 ERA, 15 strikeouts, and 17 1⁄3 innings pitched in 22 
games. He did not allow an earned run in 11 road games, but he had a 17.28 
ERA in 11 games at Coors Field.[7] Although he did not pitch in the playoffs 
for the Rockies at all (since he was injured), he was still presented with 
an NL Championship ring.[26] At Colorado Springs, Ramírez had a 4–0 record, 
a 2.28 ERA, 35 strikeouts, and 27 2⁄3 innings pitched in 25 games.[6] Ramírez 
was traded to the Kansas City Royals on March 26, 2008, for a player to 
be named later (Jorge de la Rosa).[3][27] He posted a 0.66 ERA through 
his first 13 games with the Royals, but his ERA rose to 3.49 after he posted 
a 6.14 ERA in his next 13 games.[28] Over his final 45 games, he had a 
2.08 ERA.[7] On June 25, in a 7–3 victory over Colorado (his former team), 
Ramírez threw two pitches behind Yorvit Torrealba of the Rockies. Ramírez 
said he was not trying to hit Torrealba, and he was not ejected from the 
game or disciplined, but some of the Rockies players claimed that Ramírez 
had thrown at Torrealba intentionally.[29] On July 20, he got his first 
win since May 21 of the previous year in an 8–7 victory over the Chicago 
White Sox, despite blowing the lead by giving up two runs in 1 1⁄3 innings.[30] 
Ten days later, he pitched 1 1⁄3 scoreless innings and was charged with 
the win in a 4–3 victory over the Oakland Athletics, helping the Royals 
sweep the Athletics in Oakland for the first time since 1988.[31] By September, 
he had replaced Ron Mahay as Joakim Soria's setup man.[28][32] He pitched 
in 71 games for the Royals with a 2.64 ERA. On September 4, in the second 
game of a doubleheader, Ramírez notched his first career save against the 
Athletics in a 9–6 victory.[33] Ramírez finished the year with a 3–2 record, 
a 2.64 ERA, one save, 70 strikeouts, and 71 2⁄3 innings pitched in 71 games. 
He was one of three major league pitchers to give up two or fewer home 
runs in over 70 innings (along with Roy Corcoran and Jason Grilli), and 
he was one of the American League (AL) pitchers to have an ERA under 3.00 
with at least 70 innings pitched and 70 strikeouts (along with Francisco 
Rodríguez and Matt Thornton).[7] On November 19, Ramírez was traded to 
the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Coco Crisp.[34] On April 24, 2009, he 
pitched a scoreless inning for the Red Sox and earned the win in an 11-inning 
5–4 victory over the New York Yankees.[35] He began his Red Sox tenure 
with 15 straight scoreless innings spanning 13 games from April 8 to May 
3.[36] On May 14, he pitched a season-high 2 2⁄3 innings, giving up no 
runs in a 12-inning, 5–4 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[37] 
He struck out a season-high four batters and allowed a run in 1 2⁄3 innings 
on July 9 in an 8–6 loss to the Royals.[38] Ramírez finished the season 
with a 7–4 record, a 2.84 ERA, 52 strikeouts, and 69 2⁄3 innings pitched. 
His seven wins were tied for third among AL relief pitchers and trailed 
only Alfredo Aceves (10) and Craig Breslow (8).[36] Ramírez reached the 
playoffs for the first time in his career, as the Red Sox won the Wild 
Card. In Game 1 of the American League Division Series (ALDS), he gave 
up two runs without recording an out in his only playoff appearance, a 
5–0 loss to the Angels.[39] The Angels went on to sweep the Red Sox in 
three games.[40] On April 27, 2010, Ramírez got his first save since 2008 
in a 2–1 win over the Baltimore Orioles, since Red Sox manager Terry Francona 
wanted to rest closer Jonathan Papelbon.[41] He was charged with a loss 
on July 20 after pitching 1 1⁄3 innings when Michael Bowden allowed an 
inherited runner to score in the 10th inning of a 5–4 loss to the Athletics.[42] 
Two days later, he got a save in a 13-inning, 8–6 win over the Seattle 
Mariners.[43] Ramírez had an 0–3 record, a 4.46 ERA, 2 saves, 31 strikeouts, 
and 41 2⁄3 innings pitched with the Red Sox through July 31, the trade 
deadline. That day, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for Dan Turpen.[44] 
Ramírez got his only win of the year by pitching a scoreless inning on 
September 21 in a 1–0 victory over the Cubs.[45] He got a save against 
the Diamondbacks on September 30, since Giants' manager Bruce Bochy wanted 
to rest closer Brian Wilson, in a 4–1 victory.[46] Ramírez posted a 1–0 
record, an 0.67 ERA, 15 strikeouts, and 27 innings pitched in 25 games 
for the Giants as they won the National League (NL) West and reached the 
playoffs for the first time since 2003. For the entire season, Ramírez 
had a 1–3 record, a 2.99 ERA, 46 strikeouts, and 69 1⁄3 innings pitched 
in 69 games.[7] Ramírez's only appearance in the NLDS against the Atlanta 
Braves came in Game 2 on October 8, when he gave up a home run to Rick 
Ankiel in the 11th inning and was charged with a loss (the Giants' only 
loss of the series) in the 5–4 defeat.[47] In Game 2 of the NL Championship 
Series, Ramírez gave up two runs in 1⁄3 of an inning as the Giants lost 
6–1 to the Phillies.[48] In Game 5, the Giants' other loss in the series, 
he gave up a run in 2⁄3 innings as the Giants lost 4–2.[49] On October 
27, in Game 1 of the World Series, he gave up two runs in 1⁄3 inning, but 
the Giants defeated the Rangers 11–7.[50] He pitched 2⁄3 scoreless innings 
in Game 3 on October 30, but the Giants lost 4–2.[51] However, that was 
the Giants' only loss of the series, as they defeated Texas in five games 
and won their first World Series since 1954.[52] Ramírez earned a save 
on April 6, 2011, by pitching 1⁄3 of an inning to escape a bases-loaded 
situation in the Giants' 8–4 win over the Padres.[53] On June 18, he pitched 
a season-high 2 1⁄3 innings, allowing no runs in a 4–2 loss to Oakland.[54] 
He allowed a season-high four runs in 2⁄3 innings and took the loss on 
June 30 in an 11-inning, 5–2 defeat to the Cubs.[55] On August 5, in an 
eventual 9–2 loss to Philadelphia, Ramírez hit Shane Victorino with a pitch, 
and a brawl started. Ramírez was subsequently ejected from the game.[56] 
Afterwards, Philadelphia talk-show host Tony Bruno sparked controversy 
by posting on his Twitter account that Ramírez was an illegal alien, although 
he later removed the post.[57] On September 4, Ramírez struck out four 
batters but gave up a run in 1 2⁄3 innings in a 4–1 loss to the Diamondbacks.[58] 
Two days later, he got his final save of the year when he threw a scoreless 
1⁄3 of an inning in a 6–4 victory over San Diego.[59] In 66 games that 
season, Ramírez had a 3–3 record, a 2.62 ERA, four saves, 66 strikeouts, 
and 68 2⁄3 innings pitched.[7] On December 7, the Giants traded Ramírez 
and Andrés Torres to the New York Mets for Ángel Pagán.[60] Ramírez avoided 
arbitration with the Mets by signing a one-year, $2.65 million contract 
with them on January 17, 2012.[61] Ramírez signed a minor league contract 
with the Giants in 2013, but he was released on March 22 after posting 
an 11.25 ERA in spring training.[62] He was re-signed and appeared in 6 
games for the Giants before being designated for assignment. On July 1, 
2013 Ramirez signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays organization. 
On January 2, 2014, Ramirez signed a minor league deal with the Seattle 
Mariners. On April 29, he was released after allowing 5 runs in less than 
5 innings in AAA.[63] On May 30, 2014, Ramirez signed a minor league deal 
with the Baltimore Orioles. On June 30, 2014, Ramirez made his Orioles 
debut in the ninth inning against the Texas Rangers, relieving Ubaldo Jiménez 
after pitching 8 innings only allowing 1 run pass. This was not a save 
opportunity since the Orioles were winning 7-1 in Baltimore. He allowed 
one walk and had two strikeouts. He helped Jimenez get his first win at 
Camden Yards of the 2014 Major League Baseball season. Ramírez had never 
met the Orioles manager Buck Showalter before his debut with the Orioles 
which has never happened to Buck in his Career. He was designated for assignment 
on July 6, 2014. On December 13, 2015, Ramirez signed a minor league deal 
with the Angels.[64] Ramírez throws three pitches: a fastball, a changeup, 
and a slider. His fastball ranges from 92 to 94 mph, and Ramírez considers 
it his best pitch. His changeup and slider have been described as "above-average" 
on scouting reports.[65] Ramírez is friends with José Mesa. Mesa helped 
teach Ramírez English, helped teach him how to pitch, and translated for 
him in 2006 while both were with the Rockies. After Mesa signed with the 
Detroit Tigers in 2007, Ramírez still remained in contact with him.[66] 
Ramírez enjoys Christian music, and he sings it at his house.[7] He often 
donates baseball equipment to children who need it, and in 2006 the Rockies 
recognized him for this by making him their Roberto Clemente Award nominee.[67]
