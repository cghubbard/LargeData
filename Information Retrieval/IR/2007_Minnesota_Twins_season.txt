The Minnesota Twins' 2007 season started off with the Twins trying to repeat 
as champions of the AL Central. For the third year in a row, an important 
Twins personality died just before the beginning of the season. In 2005, 
long-time stadium announcer Bob Casey fell to heart failure. In 2006, Hall 
of Fame center fielder Kirby Puckett died from a massive bilateral stroke 
brought on by hypertension. In 2007, Herb Carneal, the team's radio play-by-play 
announcer for 45 years, died from heart failure on April 1, the day before 
Opening Day. The Twins announced that they would dedicate the 2007 season 
to Carneal's memory. While the 2006 team was known for the "piranhas"—gritty 
hitters lacking power but possessing speed and guile—the 2007 team saw 
the continued the development of power hitters such as 2006 league MVP 
Justin Morneau, Torii Hunter, and Jason Kubel. After the Twins swept a 
July 6 doubleheader with the Chicago White Sox by a combined score of 32-14, 
White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén, the man who coined the term "piranhas" 
in 2006, stated: "They're not piranhas no more. They're a shark attack 
now."[6] In the second game of that doubleheader, Morneau became the first 
Twin to hit three home runs in a game since Tony Oliva against the Kansas 
City Royals on July 3, 1973. The Twins scored the most runs by one team 
in a doubleheader since the Boston Red Sox totaled 35 in a sweep of the 
Philadelphia Athletics on July 4, 1939.[7] Nick Punto, as of August 22, 
2007 has the lowest batting average among qualified batters in the American 
League, at .201. The Twins entered the season with a problem in the starting 
rotation after Twins staple Brad Radke retired and Francisco Liriano had 
Tommy John surgery. The Twins signed Ramón Ortiz and Sidney Ponson to start. 
Ponson was released in May and was replaced by Scott Baker, Ramón Ortiz 
was moved to the bullpen shortly after and replaced in the rotation by 
Kevin Slowey. However, Slowey was sent to the minors in early July, replaced 
by Matt Garza. Ramón Ortiz was traded in August to the Colorado Rockies. 
On August 31, Baker took a perfect game into the ninth inning against the 
Kansas City Royals, before giving up a leadoff walk to catcher John Buck. 
His no-hitter also ended when he gave up a 1-out single to Mike Sweeney 
in the 9th inning. The game was won by the Twins 5-0. Starter Johan Santana 
won a Gold Glove Award, the only one of his career. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 
[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] After their great amount of success 
in 2006, in which they came from behind to win the AL Central, the Twins 
wanted to be sure to lock up their 3-4-5 hitters (Joe Mauer, Michael Cuddyer, 
and Justin Morneau) to multi-year deals. The Twins were able to sign Mauer 
to a four-year deal worth $33 million, but Morneau and Cuddyer only agreed 
to sign one-year contracts, worth $4.5 million and $3.575 million respectively.
