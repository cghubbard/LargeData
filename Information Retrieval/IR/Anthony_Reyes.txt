Anthony Loza Reyes (born October 16, 1981) is a former American professional 
baseball right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played 
a total of five seasons mainly as a starting pitcher for the St. Louis 
Cardinals and Cleveland Indians. The Cardinals selected him from the University 
of Southern California in the 15th round of the 2003 MLB draft, and while 
still in the minor leagues, he was considered their top prospect. He was 
a member of the Cardinals' 2006 World Series championship team. Reyes attended 
California High School in Whittier, California. He was once considered 
too small to be a pitcher, but proved the coaches wrong and played varsity 
and went on to USC. He goes back to California High during the off season 
to practice and stays in touch with the coaches. Reyes spent his college 
years at the University of Southern California from 2000 to 2003, and though 
he was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 13th round of the 2002 amateur 
draft, he elected to return to school for his senior year.[1] He was on 
several USC teams with San Diego Padres pitcher Mark Prior. In four seasons 
with the Trojans, Reyes compiled a 17–16 record and earned Pac-10 honors 
three times.[2] He was drafted in the 15th round by the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 2003.[3] Reyes was eventually considered the top pitching prospect in 
the St. Louis farm system. He spent the 2004 season initially with the 
Palm Beach Cardinals, where he compiled a 3-0 record with a 4.66 ERA, and 
then later with the Tennessee Smokies, where he achieved a 6-2 record with 
a 2.91 ERA.[4] After a solid 2005 season with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds, 
Reyes was given a chance to prove himself in the major leagues. On August 
9, at Miller Park, Reyes threw 6 1⁄3 innings in his debut start against 
the Milwaukee Brewers, earning the win and giving up just two runs on two 
hits. He was demoted immediately after the game, having fulfilled his role 
of giving the regular rotation an extra day's rest by manager Tony La Russa. 
Reyes opened the 2006 season with Memphis. He was recalled to St. Louis 
June 23 when Mark Mulder was placed on the disabled list. As a result, 
Reyes was asked to start the final game of a three-game series against 
the Chicago White Sox. In the previous two games, the White Sox scored 
33 runs against the Cardinals. In the third game Reyes threw 90 pitches, 
67 for strikes, had six strikeouts and no walks, and carried a no-hitter 
into the seventh inning. The only White Sox hit was a home run by Jim Thome. 
The Cardinals offense could not respond in kind and the White Sox won, 
1–0. Reyes pitched an eight inning complete game and took the loss despite 
giving up only the one hit (albeit a home run) to Thome. During the Cardinals' 
2006 playoff run, Reyes was left off the roster for the National League 
Division Series against the San Diego Padres. However, after advancing 
to the National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, the 
Cardinals added him to the roster in place of starting pitcher Jason Marquis. 
Reyes started Game 4 of the series and pitched four innings, taking a no-decision. 
He pitched the first game of the 2006 World Series and earned the win, 
pitching eight innings and retiring 17 consecutive batters from the first 
through the sixth inning, a World Series record for a rookie. Reyes gave 
up two runs and earned player of the game honors. The Cardinals went on 
to win the series, defeating the Detroit Tigers four games to one.[5] After 
starting the 2007 season 0–8 with a 6.08 ERA (although he had the worst 
run support in the majors), the Cardinals optioned him to Memphis on May 
27. Todd Wellemeyer replaced him in the Cardinals starting rotation. He 
made three strong starts for the Redbirds and was recalled to St. Louis 
June 16, but was optioned back to Memphis again on July 2. Reyes was called 
up again from Memphis to make a spot start in a doubleheader against Milwaukee. 
He pitched well allowing 2 runs on two hits. Reyes began the 2008 season 
in St. Louis's bullpen, going 2–1 with a 4.91 ERA before being demoted 
to Triple-A Memphis. He went 2–3 with a 3.25 ERA in 11 starts at Memphis. 
On July 26, 2008, Reyes was traded to the Cleveland Indians for right-handed 
reliever Luis Perdomo and cash. On August 8, 2008, the Indians promoted 
Reyes from Triple-A Buffalo. That same day, he made his first start for 
Cleveland, going 6 1⁄3 innings, allowing just 1 run, and picked up the 
win. Reyes was non-tendered by the Indians on December 12, 2009, making 
him a free agent. He was re-signed to a minor league contract on December 
13. During spring training his contract was purchased by the Indians, at 
which time he was placed on the 60-day disabled list, while recovering 
from Tommy John surgery.[6] After spending the entire 2010 season on the 
disabled list, Reyes was outrighted to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers on 
October 29, 2010. After electing free agency, Reyes signed a one-year minor 
league contract with the Indians on November 15. His contract includes 
a non-roster invitation to the Indians' 2011 spring training camp. Reyes 
spent the 2011 season rehabbing his injured elbow, never appearing on the 
40-man roster. He was released by the Indians on August 5, 2011, and retired 
after a season in the San Diego Padres organization. Reyes has a younger 
brother, Erik, who pitched for Concordia University Irvine in 2007.[7]
