Busch Stadium, also referred to informally as "New Busch Stadium" or "Busch 
Stadium III", is a baseball park located in St. Louis, Missouri, and the 
home of the St. Louis Cardinals, the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) 
franchise. The stadium has a seating capacity of 43,975, and contains 3,706 
club seats and 61 luxury suites. It replaced Busch Memorial Stadium (aka 
Busch Stadium II) and occupies a portion of that stadium's former footprint. 
A commercial area, dubbed Ballpark Village, was built adjacent to the stadium 
over the remainder of the former stadium's footprint. The stadium opened 
on April 4, 2006 with an exhibition between the minor league Memphis Redbirds 
and Springfield Cardinals, both affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
which Springfield won 5-3 with right-hander Mike Parisi recording the first 
win. The first official major league game occurred on April 10, 2006 as 
the Cardinals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 6–4 behind an Albert Pujols 
home run and winning pitcher Mark Mulder. The highest attendance for a 
sports event was on May 23, 2013, when 48,263 people watched Chelsea Football 
Club and Manchester City Football Club play a friendly match.[12] The stadium 
is the third stadium in St. Louis to carry the name Busch Stadium. Sportsman's 
Park was renamed Busch Stadium in 1953, after team owner Gussie Busch. 
The first Busch Stadium closed in 1966 and both the baseball Cardinals, 
and the National Football League (NFL)'s team of the same name (now the 
Arizona Cardinals) moved to a new multi-purpose stadium, named Busch Memorial 
Stadium. However, the current stadium is actually a corporate name and 
named after Anheuser-Busch, not Gussie Busch. The naming rights deal was 
signed in 2004 and would extend from the stadium's opening in 2006 until 
2026.[13] In 1995, St. Louis Cardinals team ownership began to lobby for 
a new ballpark in downtown St. Louis, but the team was unable to acquire 
funding for the project for several years. In June 2001, the Missouri state 
government signed a contract with the team, proposing a ballpark in downtown 
St. Louis, but a subsequent funding bill was struck down in May 2002, leaving 
the saga open.[14][15] Team owners sought a location near Madison, Illinois, 
adjacent to Gateway International Raceway, until the city of St. Louis 
drafted a financing plan for the team to construct the new stadium in downtown 
St. Louis.[16] The stadium was financed through private bonds, bank loans, 
a long-term loan from St. Louis County, and money from the team owners. 
The development, including the Ballpark Village was projected to cost approximately 
$665 million with the stadium alone costing $365 million.[6] New Busch 
Stadium was designed by Populous (then known as HOK Sport) and built by 
Hunt Construction with an estimated cost of $344.8 million, which proved 
too low by $20.2 million to its final cost of $365 million.[6] Populous' 
senior project designer for Busch Stadium was Jim Chibnall, who was also 
the lead designer of Progressive Field in Cleveland, Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, 
Sydney Olympic Stadium and other notable stadiums throughout the world.[17] 
The field level (16,880 seats), terrace level (9,150), and bleachers (3,661) 
were completed in time for opening day, with total capacity on that day 
of 37,962, not including up to 2,751 standing room tickets.[18] An integrated 
LED video and scoring system from Daktronics was installed in the stadium 
prior to its opening, featuring a video display measuring 32 feet high 
by 52 feet wide and three message displays, as well as more than 100 feet 
of digital ribbon board technology.[19] Construction on the seating area 
was completed in late May increasing the capacity for the May 29, 2006 
game vs the Houston Astros with finishing touches performed throughout 
the year.[18] Including all 2,886 standing-room-only tickets for the general 
public and the suites and party rooms, the stadium's total capacity is 
46,861. Natural grass turf was installed in March 2006.[18] In the stadium's 
debut season every Cardinal game was sold out, giving a total attendance 
of 3,407,104 for the season, the second-largest in team history,[20] but 
since surpassed in both 2007 and 2008.[21] In the first season of the new 
stadium, the Cardinals beat the Detroit Tigers in 5 games to capture their 
10th World Series title. Busch Stadium hosted only one postseason game 
in 2009, a 5–1 loss versus the Los Angeles Dodgers on October 10, to complete 
a sweep of the Cardinals. In 2011, Busch Stadium hosted two postseason 
games in the National League Division Series versus the Philadelphia Phillies. 
On October 4, the Phillies won 3–2, to take a 2–1 game lead over the Cardinals. 
The next night, the 5th, the Cardinals beat the Phillies 5–3 to tie the 
series at 2 games apiece. In the NLCS versus the Milwaukee Brewers, the 
Cardinals won 2 of the three games they played at home (Games 3, 4, 5). 
The Cards ended up winning the series on the road in Milwaukee to advance 
to the World Series. (This was the second time the Cardinals had defeated 
the Brewers in a postseason series, the first being the 1982 World Series, 
when Milwaukee was represented as an American League team; the Brewers 
switched over to the National League in 1998.) Because the National League 
had won the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, home field advantage went to the Cardinals 
as the National League champions, thus allowing the team to host the Texas 
Rangers for Games 1, 2, 6 and 7. Game 1 was won by the Cardinals on October 
19, along with Game 6 on October 27, in a game won in walk-off fashion 
by a David Freese home run, then the deciding Game 7, which was taken by 
the Cardinals in a 6-2 final, giving the team the 2011 World Series title. 
Busch Stadium hosted two postseason games vs. the Washington Nationals 
in the 2012 National League Division Series. The two teams split the two 
games at Busch, before the Cardinals won two of the next three games at 
Nationals Park. The Cardinals then won the first two home games against 
the San Francisco Giants to take a 3–1 series lead, but lost Game 5 and 
went on to lose the series in Game 7 at AT&T Park. The Cardinals hosted 
nine postseason games at Busch Stadium in 2013. In the National League 
Division Series, they won Games 1 and 5 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
with the latter game capping off a series comeback after trailing 2–1. 
They would win every home game of the NLCS against the Dodgers, including 
a 9–0 shutout win in Game 6 to take the series 4–2. In the World Series, 
the Cardinals hosted Games 3–5 against the Boston Red Sox. Game 3 on October 
26 ended in an obstruction call when Allen Craig was impeded by Will Middlebrooks 
at third base, thus awarding him a run after umpire Jim Joyce ruled obstruction 
on the play. The next night Game 4 ended on a successful pickoff by Koji 
Uehara on pinch-runner Kolten Wong at first base. The Cardinals led 2–1 
after the controversial Game 3 win, but proceeded to lose the next three 
games to lose the series 4–2. The Cardinals played two games in Busch Stadium 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series. 
The first two games of the Series were played at Dodger Stadium in Los 
Angeles, and the teams each won a game there. The Series then moved to 
Busch Stadium, and the Cardinals won the next two games, to win the Series 
3-1 and advance to the National League Championship Series. The Cardinals 
opened the National League Championship Series at Busch Stadium on October 
11, 2014, against the San Francisco Giants. The teams split games 1 and 
2 played at Busch Stadium, and the Series moved to AT&T Park in San Francisco. 
The Giants won games 3, 4, and 5 in their home ballpark, to defeat the 
Cardinals in the NLCS 4-1, and move on to an appearance in the 2014 World 
Series against the Kansas City Royals. The Cardinals hosted two postseason 
games at Busch Stadium in 2015. In the National League Division Series, 
they won game 1 on October 9, 2015, but lost game 2 against the Chicago 
Cubs. The Cardinals then lost games 3 and 4 to the Cubs at Wrigley Field 
to lose the series 3-1. The stadium hosted the 2009 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game on July 14, 2009. The American League defeated the National 
League in that game, 4-3. Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Carl Crawford won MVP. 
President Barack Obama threw out the ceremonial first pitch wearing a Chicago 
White Sox jacket. Missouri has recently started to play one game a year 
at Busch. In 2009, they defeated SLU, and in 2010, they defeated Illinois 
in a Braggin' Rights matchup. The Cardinals have allowed local high school 
teams to play each other on the field following select weekend afternoon 
games. So far, the only home run hit by a high school student was on May 
7, 2011 by Johnny Wilson of Marquette Catholic High School against Farmington 
High School.[citation needed] Southern Illinois University Carbondale and 
Southeast Missouri State played each other in the first ever football game 
at Busch Stadium on September 21, 2013 in front of a crowd of 14,618. Busch 
Stadium hosted a friendly on May 23, 2013 between Manchester City and Chelsea 
of the English Premier League.[22] Tickets for the match sold out within 
20 minutes of going on sale,[23] and Manchester City won 4-3 in front of 
an enthusiastic standing-room crowd of 48,263.[24] Later that year on November 
18, Busch hosted a friendly between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Argentina; 
before a crowd of more than 30,000, many of which were members of St. Louis' 
large Bosniak community, Argentina beat Bosnia 2-0, with Sergio Agüero 
scoring both goals. On April 4, 2015 the United States Women's National 
Soccer Team defeated New Zealand 4-0 in front of over 35,000 fans, the 
largest stand-alone crowd for a USWNT friendly in history.[citation needed] 
On November 13, 2015 the United States Men's National Soccer Team defeated 
St. Vincent and the Grenadines 6-1 in the first match of the fourth round 
of qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in front of a crowd of 43,433. 
On June 7, 2008, the stadium hosted its first-ever concert, with Dave Matthews 
Band playing to a crowd of approximately 35,000, with The Black Crowes 
as their opening act. The show was recorded and later released as a live 
album, entitled Live Trax Vol. 13. On June 24, 2010, the stadium again 
hosted a concert, with The Eagles headlining a show, along with The Dixie 
Chicks.[25] On July 17, 2011, the stadium hosted its third concert, when 
U2 came to town during their 360° Tour.[26] On August 13, 2016, the stadium 
hosted its fourth concert, when Paul McCartney came to town during his 
One on One tour. On March 9, 2016, the National Hockey League announced 
that the St. Louis Blues would host the 2017 NHL Winter Classic at Busch 
Stadium for the first time in its 50-year history on January 2, 2017.[27] 
The ballpark features a make-your-own-mascot store for the Cardinals' mascot, 
Fredbird. Whereas the old stadium was a fully enclosed "cookie-cutter" 
facility similar to Riverfront, Veterans, Three Rivers and Atlanta-Fulton 
County stadiums, the new stadium is similar to the many other Populous 
designed "retro-classic" fields. Like all those, it offers a panoramic 
view of the downtown skyline. The Gate 3 entrance on the west side of the 
stadium is most iconic, with a large "bridge" resembling the Eads Bridge 
arching over the entrance. The exterior of the stadium contains historical 
plaques of Cardinals logos, the STL insignia and a Busch Stadium logo behind 
home plate. After complaints from fans that not all out-of-town games could 
be placed on the Daktronics out-of-town scoreboard at one time, following 
the inaugural season a number of advertisement panels were removed to expand 
the scoreboard and also create a secondary video board. In 2016, the entire 
original scoreboard and fascia-board system was replaced, creating two 
full HD video boards: the main board, which took up the entire area of 
the original scoreboard and video board, measures 4,800 sq ft (40ft x 120ft), 
with the out-of-town scoreboard measuring 3,280 sq ft (40 x 81 ft).[28] 
Outside the Gate 3 entrance stands a bronze statue of Cardinals legend 
Stan "The Man" Musial. Other Cardinals statues that previously surrounded 
Busch Memorial Stadium are now displayed at the corner of Clark and 8th 
streets, outside the Cardinals' team store. The statues are of former Cardinal 
players and Hall of Fame inductees Enos Slaughter, Dizzy Dean, Rogers Hornsby, 
Red Schoendienst, Lou Brock, Bob Gibson and Ozzie Smith; former St. Louis 
Browns player and Hall of Fame inductee George Sisler; former Negro league 
St. Louis Stars player and Hall of Fame inductee Cool Papa Bell; and former 
Cardinals radio broadcaster and Hall of Fame honoree Jack Buck. Fans at 
the stadium have access to a large amount of food and drink options, ranging 
from standard ballpark fare like bratwurst, nachos and peanuts to St Louis-area 
favorites such as pork steak sandwiches and toasted ravioli. Budweiser 
holds the beer contract for the stadium as one would expect, but most recently 
the smaller Saint Louis Brewery has been making inroads, selling Schlafly 
beer in bottles at a growing number of concession stands. Tickets for five 
all-inclusive areas are sold on a single game basis, with amenities running 
the gamut from the ritzy Champions Club (offering a multiple-course buffet, 
plasma televisions, a chance to get on television or radio as a broadcast 
booth is located inside the club, and a full bar) to the more family-oriented 
Scoreboard Patio (with table seating for four in center field and a more 
traditional selection of food). Cardinal management also allows outside 
food and drink (including soft-sided drink coolers); as a result, it is 
not uncommon to see vendors selling discounted bags of peanuts and bottles 
of soda and water, or even scalpers including a box of Cracker Jack with 
tickets. After St. Louis Post-Dispatch sportswriter Rick Hummel was honored 
with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award and induction into the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007, the Cardinals renamed the stadium's press 
box the "Bob Broeg-Rick Hummel Press Box", honoring the two local writers 
enshrined in Cooperstown. Ballpark Village is a multi-phase residential 
and entertainment complex located on the site of the former Busch Memorial 
Stadium across the street from the new ballpark. Despite several years 
of delays, groundbreaking occurred in February 2013 and the first phase 
was completed in time for Opening Day 2014. During a weather incident during 
a July 2006 game vs the Atlanta Braves, portable concession stands were 
knocked over, the infield rain tarp was damaged, and plastic sheets used 
to protect the press box were dislodged. As a result of the storm at least 
30 spectators were injured, of whom five were taken to the hospital.[29] 
After the storm happened, the stadium designated shelter areas for such 
disasters which are located throughout the ballpark.[30] Following Juan 
Encarnación's face injury on August 31, 2007, workers extended the screen
