The 1960 Washington Senators won 73 games, lost 81, and finished in fifth 
place in the American League. They were managed by Cookie Lavagetto and 
played home games at Griffith Stadium. This was their final season in Washington, 
as they moved to Minnesota and became the Twins in 1961, which they have 
been named ever since. The departure meant lights out for Griffith Stadium, 
as it was demolished after the second Washington Senators franchise played 
its inaugural season there. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] After an early 
flirtation with San Francisco, by 1957 Calvin Griffith was courting Minneapolis-St. 
Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in him rejecting the Twin Cities' 
first offer[1] before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed 
the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move 
and would be replaced with an expansion Senators team for 1961. The old 
Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins. Infielders Other batters
