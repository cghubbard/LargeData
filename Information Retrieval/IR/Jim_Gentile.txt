James Edward Gentile (born June 3, 1934), also nicknamed "Diamond Jim", 
is an American former professional baseball player and minor league manager. 
He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman for the Brooklyn 
and Los Angeles Dodgers (1957–58); Baltimore Orioles (1960–63), Kansas 
City Athletics (1964–65), Houston Astros (1965–66) and Cleveland Indians 
(1966). Born in San Francisco, Gentile was a powerful, left-handed slugger 
listed at 6' 4", 215 lb. He was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as a 
high school pitcher in 1952.[1] He played his first minor league season 
as a pitcher, earning a 2-6 win-lost record. The next year he was converted 
into a first baseman.[1] He languished for eight years in the minors for 
a Dodgers team that already had All-Star Gil Hodges at first base and Norm 
Larker.[1] He dominated the minors, leading two separate leagues in home 
runs.[1] Gentile was traded to Baltimore in 1960, where he was named to 
the 1960 All-Star Game his first full season. He enjoyed his best season 
in 1961, hitting a career-highs .302 batting average, 46 home runs, 141 
runs batted in(see below), 96 runs, 147 hits, 25 doubles, 96 walks, .423 
on-base percentage, .646 slugging average and 1.069 OPS. He finished third 
in the MVP ballot (behind Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris). In addition, 
Gentile hit five grand slams — including two straight in one game[2] — 
setting an American League record that stood until Don Mattingly belted 
six in 1987.[1] In a nine-season career, Gentile batted .260 (759-for-2922) 
with 179 home runs, 549 RBI, 434 runs, 113 doubles, six triples, and three 
stolen bases in 936 games. Following his major league career, he played 
one season in Japan for the Kintetsu Buffaloes in 1969. Gentile managed 
the Fort Worth Cats when they returned to baseball in 2001 and 2002. Jim 
also managed the 2005 Mid-Missouri Mavericks of the Frontier League. Gentile's 
141 RBIs in 1961 was second only to Roger Maris' 142 RBIs, however, analysis 
by the Society for American Baseball Research[3] determined Maris was incorrectly 
credited with an RBI in a game on July 5, 1961. Maris reached base on an 
error by numerous accounts. Therefore, Gentile and Maris both had 141 RBIs 
in 1961. Gentile's contract with the Orioles in 1961 called for a $5,000 
bonus if he led the league in RBIs. The Orioles made good on that deal 
50 years later and presented Gentile with a check for $5,000 at a game
