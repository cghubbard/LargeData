William Dexter Fowler (born March 22, 1986) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder who is a free agent. He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Houston Astros, and Chicago Cubs. 
He represented the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics as a member 
of the United States national baseball team. Fowler was born in Atlanta, 
and attended Milton High School in Alpharetta, Georgia. At Milton, Fowler 
hit .457 with 14 home runs in 105 at-bats.[citation needed] Fowler rejected 
offers from Harvard and the University of Miami in order to play major 
league baseball, after having originally committed to Miami.[1] Before 
signing with the Rockies, Fowler was exclusively a right-handed hitter.[2] 
As a minor leaguer during the 2008 season, Fowler was selected to represent 
the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.[3] He 
and the U.S. team ended up winning the bronze medal in the Olympics by 
defeating Japan, 8-4, in the bronze medal game.[4] Fowler was drafted by 
the Colorado Rockies in the 14th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball 
draft. In 2008, he was selected by Major League Baseball to play in the 
All-Star Futures Game at Yankee Stadium. Fowler was batting .337 with nine 
home runs, 61 runs batted in (RBIs) and 20 stolen bases for the Rockies' 
Double-A Texas League affiliate, the Tulsa Drillers prior to playing for 
Team USA in the 2008 Olympics. Fowler was called up to the Major Leagues 
for the first time on September 2, 2008. He made his debut that same day 
in a 6-5 extra innings home win over the San Francisco Giants, coming in 
as a pinch runner in the bottom of the 10th inning; he was subsequently 
picked off at first base.[5] In Fowler's first at-bat in the bottom of 
the third inning of a 9-2 home loss against the Giants the following day, 
he flied out to right field.[6] On September 10, 2008, Fowler recorded 
his first hit, an infield single, off of Will Ohman in the top of the seventh 
inning of a 9-5 road loss against the Atlanta Braves.[7] On April 8, 2009, 
Fowler hit his first career home run off Doug Davis of the Arizona Diamondbacks, 
as part of a 9-2 road win. He hit the home run on the first pitch of the 
game, becoming the first player in Rockies history to do so.[8] On April 
27, 2009, Fowler tied a modern-day rookie record when he stole five bases 
against the San Diego Padres in a 12-7 victory.[9] In 2010, Fowler led 
the Majors in triples, accumulating 14 on the season. In 439 at bats on 
the year, he had six home runs, 36 RBI, 73 runs scored, and 114 total base 
hits. In 2011, Fowler was 3rd in the National League in triples, hitting 
15 that season. In 481 at bats on the year, he hit five home runs, 45 RBI, 
84 runs scored, and 128 total base hits. The 2012 season saw Fowler's batting 
stats increase to career highs. He hit 13 home runs, 53 RBI, and a batting 
average of .300 in 454 at bats. However, much of his success came while 
hitting at home, Coors Field. His home OPS was .880, but only .694 on the 
road. On December 3, 2013, Fowler was traded, along with a player to be 
named later to the Houston Astros for outfielder Brandon Barnes and pitcher 
Jordan Lyles.[10] The Rockies eventually sent cash to the Astros to complete 
the deal instead of the player to be named later.[11] He hit .276 in 116 
games for the Astros during the 2014 season.[12] On January 19, 2015, Fowler 
was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Luis Valbuena and Dan Straily.[13] He 
ended the 2015 season with a .250 average with 102 runs scored, 46 RBIs, 
17 HRs, and 20 stolen bases.[14] In the 2015 National League wild card 
game, Fowler helped the Cubs to a 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates with 
three hits, three runs scored, one RBI, a home run, and a stolen base.[15] 
With the Cubs finishing the 2015 season with a 97-65 record, the team entered 
the postseason for the first time after 7 years. In 9 postseason games, 
Fowler batted .396 with 2 home runs and 3 RBI. In game 4 of the 2015 NLCS 
against the New York Mets, he was the final batter to strike out looking 
as the Cubs were eliminated from the postseason. Fowler signed a one-year 
contract with the Cubs that included a mutual option for the 2017 season 
on February 25, 2016,[16] despite reportedly agreeing to a three-year contract 
with the Baltimore Orioles earlier that week.[17] The Orioles claimed that 
Fowler's insistence on an opt-out clause after one year was the holdup 
on the deal and that they were blind sided when he signed with the Cubs. 
Fowler on the other hand insisted he never had agreed to a deal with the 
Orioles and he and his agent blamed the team and the media for leaking 
incorrect information.[18] Fowler earned his first career MLB ejection 
for arguing a strike three call by umpire Vic Carapazza on May 5, 2016.[19] 
On October 25, 2016, Dexter Fowler along with teammates Jason Heyward, 
Addison Russell, and Carl Edwards Jr. became the first African-Americans 
to play for the Cubs in a World Series game. Additionally, Fowler is the 
first African-American to appear and to bat for the Cubs in a World Series. 
Both Fowler and Russell are the first African-Americans to start for the 
Cubs in a World Series.[20][21][22][a] Fowler led off Game 7 of the World 
Series with a home run, becoming the first player in history to lead off 
a World Series Game 7 with a home run.[23] The Cubs won the game 8â€“7 in 
10 innings, giving the team their first championship in 108 years.[24] 
On November 5, Fowler declined his mutual option for the 2017 season and 
became a free agent.[25] Fowler is married to Aliya Fowler and has a daughter, 
Naya. Fowler is a Christian.[26] Fowler is good friends with former teammate
