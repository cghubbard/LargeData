Michael James Ryan (born November 25, 1941 in Haverhill, Massachusetts) 
is an American former professional baseball player, coach and minor league 
manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Boston 
Red Sox (1964–67), Philadelphia Phillies (1968–73) and Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1974). Of all non-pitchers since 1930 with at least 1,000 at-bats, only 
one, Ray Oyler, has a lower batting average.[1] Appearing in a team-high 
79 games as a catcher, Ryan helped the "Impossible Dream" Red Sox win the 
1967 American League pennant. In 1967 he was the roommate of Tony Conigliaro 
before Conigliaro's beaning. Then in 1974 he was a reserve on the Pirates 
team that won the National League Eastern Division. With the Philadelphia 
Phillies on May 2, 1970, Ryan and Tim McCarver both had a hand broken in 
a game against the San Francisco Giants.[2] With their catching corps depleted, 
the Phillies were forced to use Jim Hutto, Del Bates, Doc Edwards, and 
Mike Compton at the position. Bates and Compton never played in the major 
leagues before or after 1970. Edwards was the Phillies bullpen coach and 
had last played in the majors in 1965. After his playing career, Ryan managed 
and coached in the Pirates and Phillies minor league organizations from 
1975 to 1979, then coached at the Major League level for the Phillies for 
16 seasons, from 1980 until 1995. He had surgery following the 1993 season 
on his right shoulder, the cumulative result of his years of throwing batting 
practice and warming-up pitchers. He worked two more seasons with ongoing 
pain and retired after the 1995 season.[3] He was on the staff of three 
National League champions in Philadelphia, and the 1980 World Series champion, 
and worked for seven managers. Ryan's coaching tenure with the Phillies 
was the longest in franchise history until being surpassed by John Vukovich
