Canada competed at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea. 328 competitors, 
223 men and 105 women, took part in 193 events in 23 sports.[1] Most Canadians 
remember this as being the Olympics where Ben Johnson won the gold medal 
and set a world record in the men's 100 metres, and then was stripped of 
the medal and the record after testing positive for steroids. Canada was 
represented by three men and one woman in Seoul. Women's Individual Competition:
