Bernabé Williams Figueroa Jr. (born September 13, 1968) is a Puerto Rican 
former professional baseball player and musician. He played his entire 
16-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees 
from 1991 through 2006. A center fielder, Williams was a member of four 
World Series championship teams with the Yankees. He ended his career with 
a .297 batting average, 287 home runs, 1,257 runs batted in (RBI), 1,366 
runs scored, and 449 doubles. He was a five-time MLB All-Star and won four 
Gold Glove Awards. He also won the Silver Slugger Award and American League 
Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award. Known for his consistency 
and post-season heroics, Williams is one of the most beloved Yankees of 
all time and his number, 51, was retired by the Yankees in May 2015. Williams 
is also a classically trained guitarist. Following his absence from baseball, 
he has released two jazz albums. He was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 
2009. Bernabé Williams Figueroa Jr. was born to Bernabé Williams Figueroa 
Sr., a merchant marine and dispatcher, and Rufina Williams, a retired principal 
and college professor. The Williams family lived in the Bronx until Bernie 
was one year old, when they moved to Puerto Rico.[1] Growing up, Williams 
played classical guitar as well as baseball. He was also active in track 
and field, winning medals at an international meet at the age of 15. At 
the 1984 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics 
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Williams won gold in the 200 metres (m), 400 
m, 4 × 100 m relay, and 4 × 400 m relay events for competitors under the 
age of 17, and the silver medal for the 4 × 100 m relay among competitors 
younger than 20.[2] In 1985, Roberto Rivera, a scout for the New York Yankees 
of Major League Baseball (MLB), discovered Williams and Williams' friend, 
Juan González. Though Rivera was not interested in González, who he perceived 
as not taking the game seriously, he wanted to sign Williams. However, 
Williams was a few months shy of his 17th birthday, when he would become 
eligible to sign with an MLB team. The Yankees put Williams in a training 
camp in Connecticut, near the home of scouting director Doug Melvin.[3] 
The Yankees officially signed Williams on his 17th birthday.[4][5][6] While 
playing in minor league baseball, Williams took a course on biology at 
the University of Puerto Rico, and considered undertaking a pre-medical 
track as an undergraduate student. Deciding that he could not excel at 
baseball and medicine at the same time, Williams decided to focus on baseball.[7] 
Playing for the Yankees' Double-A team in Albany,[8] he continued to develop 
his athletic skills – particularly as a switch hitter.[8] Although viewed 
as a great prospect by Yankee management, his rise to the Majors was delayed 
by the solid outfield that the team had developed in the early 1990s.[8] 
Williams managed to break into the majors in 1991 to replace the injured 
Roberto Kelly for the second half of that season. He batted .238 in 320 
at bats.[4] He was demoted to the minors until Danny Tartabull was injured, 
and Williams earned his stay at center by putting up solid numbers.[4] 
Williams had become the regular Yankees center fielder by 1993. However, 
Williams got off to a slow start that season, and Yankees' owner George 
Steinbrenner, impatient with Williams, insisted that Gene Michael, the 
team's general manager, trade him.[9] Michael discussed trading Williams 
for Larry Walker with the Montreal Expos, but did not make the trade.[10] 
In his first full season with the Yankees, Williams had a .268 batting 
average.[11] Buck Showalter helped keep him with the Yankees through 1995, 
when George Steinbrenner sought to trade him. Steinbrenner was frustrated 
by the team's difficulty in placing him in any of the traditional baseball 
player molds. He had good speed, but rarely stole bases. In center, he 
was highly capable at tracking down fly balls and line drives, but had 
a weak throwing arm. He was a consistent hitter, but only had mild home 
run power. Throughout the early 1990s he hit in the middle of the order 
as management tried to figure out where his best fit was. In 1995, Steinbrenner 
again considered trading Williams, this time to the San Francisco Giants 
for Darren Lewis.[6] The Yankees kept Williams, who had a breakout season. 
He hit 18 home runs and led the team in runs, hits, total bases and stolen 
bases.[4] Williams continued his hot hitting into the postseason, leading 
the Yankees with a .429 batting average in the 1995 American League Division 
Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners. After continuing to improve 
in 1996, Williams again showcased his skills to the baseball world in the 
postseason. He batted .467 in the ALDS against Texas and played a sparkling 
center field. He picked up where he left off in the ALCS against Baltimore, 
belting an 11th-inning walk-off homer in Game 1. Ending with a .474 ALCS 
average and two homers, he was named the ALCS MVP. Williams collected just 
four hits in the 1996 World Series but his 4 RBI led the Yankees and a 
clutch homer in the eighth inning of Game 3 helped capture the team's first 
championship since 1978. Following the 1997 season, Williams again was 
the subject of trade rumors, this time involving the Detroit Tigers. According 
to The New York Times sportswriter Murray Chass, Williams was nearly dealt 
to the Tigers for a package of young pitchers including Roberto Durán and 
first round draft pick Mike Drumright. Tigers general manager Randy Smith 
believed a deal had been reached and an official announcement was close, 
but Yankees general manager Bob Watson denied that was the case, and Williams 
remained a Yankee.[12][13] Watson also discussed Williams with the Chicago 
Cubs in a potential trade involving Lance Johnson.[10] During the 1998 
season, in which the Yankees went 114–48 to set a then American League 
regular season record, Williams finished with a .339 average, becoming 
the first player to win a batting title, Gold Glove award, and World Series 
ring in the same year. After the 1998 season, Williams signed a seven-year, 
$87.5-million contract with the Yankees,[4] one of the largest in baseball 
at the time. The Boston Red Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks also bid for Williams 
on the free agent market.[4] For the length of the contract, the Yankees 
made the playoffs every single year, and as a result Williams continued 
to add to his postseason statistics, placing in the top 10 of various career 
postseason categories.[citation needed] The last year covered by his contract, 
2005, proved to be a difficult one. He started 99 games in center field 
and 22 games as designated hitter, but his already weak arm was highlighted 
as his fielding and batting abilities considerably weakened. He had a career-worst 
.321 OBP and batting average on balls in play (.274). As expected, the 
Yankees announced on August 2, 2005, that they would not pick up the $15 
million option on Williams' contract for the 2006 season, opting to pay 
a $3.5 million buyout instead. In December Williams was offered arbitration 
by team general manager Brian Cashman to allow an additional month for 
negotiation. On December 22, the Yankees re-signed Williams to a 1-year, 
$1.5 million contract.[14] In 2006, Williams saw a good amount of playing 
time in the corner outfield spots with both Hideki Matsui and Gary Sheffield 
out with wrist injuries, and did spot duty in center field on days when 
starting center fielder Johnny Damon was given time off to rest, playing 
more than was expected when he signed his one-year extension with the Yankees 
in 2006. Williams played for Puerto Rico in the 2006 MLB World Baseball 
Classic, joining Carlos Delgado, Carlos Beltrán, Mike Lowell, Javier Vázquez, 
and José Vidro amongst others representing the island possession in a team 
managed by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach Jose Oquendo. On July 26, 
2006, Williams got his 2,300th career hit, becoming the 11th active player 
in the Majors with 2,300 or more career hits. Williams continued to climb 
the Yankees record books by hitting his 443rd career double on August 16, 
2006, surpassing then-bench coach Don Mattingly for second-most as a Yankee. 
For the year, he walked only 7.3% of the time, a career-worst. After two 
years of inactivity, Williams returned to action playing for the Gigantes 
de Carolina in the Puerto Rico Baseball League (formerly LBPPR) interested 
in gauging his condition prior to a possible participation in the 2009 
World Baseball Classic.[15] MLB.com reported on December 30, 2008 that 
Williams had injured his quad while playing for Carolina and may not be 
able to play in the World Baseball Classic for Puerto Rico. On February 
19, 2009 Williams worked out with the Yankees at the team's spring training 
complex.[16] Williams hinted that if he performs well in the World Baseball 
Classic he might consider returning to the Yankees.[17] Williams, a fan 
favorite with the Yankees during the Joe Torre era, still has several friends 
and former teammates in pinstripes. Williams' contract expired at the end 
of the 2006 season. He had hoped to return to the Yankees in 2007 and was 
willing to accept a role as a back-up outfielder and pinch hitter.[18] 
The Yankees offered Williams an invitation to spring training as a non-roster 
invitee, giving him a chance to compete for a job. Williams, however, wanted 
a guaranteed roster spot and declined the invitation.[19] On September 
21, 2008, Williams made his first return to Yankee Stadium since 2006 for 
the ceremonies preceding the final game at the stadium. He was the last 
former player to be introduced and received a standing ovation that lasted 
a minute and 42 seconds.[20] In March 2009 he played for Puerto Rico in 
the World Baseball Classic, going 0-for-5 with two walks; after the series 
concluded, he expressed interest in playing in the Major Leagues again.[21] 
Though he would not appear in a Major League Baseball game after 2006, 
Williams did not officially retire until 2015. At the February 2011 retirement 
press conference for Andy Pettitte, Williams acknowledged that his career 
was over and stated that he would officially announce his retirement soon 
thereafter.[22] On April 22, 2015, it was announced that Williams would 
officially retire on April 24, 2015, with the Yankees.[23] As of 2013, 
he holds the career postseason record for runs batted in (80). He is also 
second all-time for postseason home runs (22), doubles (29), total hits 
(128), total bases (223), and runs scored (83), and third in post-season 
games played (121). Standing on Yankee all-time lists as of the beginning 
of the 2008 season:[24] Williams appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot for 
the first time in 2012. He received 55 votes for 9.6%. The next year, Williams 
received 19 votes (3.3%). Since he received votes on fewer than 5% of ballots, 
Williams will not be eligible to appear on future ballots.[25] The Yankees 
announced in May 2014 that they would honor Williams with a plaque in Monument 
Park during the 2015 season.[26] On February 16, 2015, the Yankees also 
announced that they would be retiring Williams' number 51.[27] On May 24, 
the Yankees unveiled Williams's plaque and retired his number in a ceremony 
at Yankee Stadium.[28] A classically trained guitarist, Williams plays 
and composes music with influences that include jazz, classical, pop, Brazilian, 
and Latin sounds. Following his career with the New York Yankees, he studied 
guitar and composition for a year at the State University of New York at 
Purchase in preparation for his album, Moving Forward. Williams signed 
with Paul McCartney's publishing company, MPL Communications,[29] and his 
major label debut, The Journey Within, was released on June 22, 2003.[30] 
In addition to playing lead and rhythm guitar, Williams composed seven 
songs for the album. Tracks like "La Salsa En Mi" and "Desvelado" mix Bernie's 
love of jazz with the sophisticated Latin rhythms of his Puerto Rican heritage. 
The first single was a remix of his "Just Because", featuring David Benoit. 
Other highlights include Williams' heartfelt tribute to his father, "Para 
Don Berna", a reworking of the Baden Powell song, "Samba Novo", and "La 
Salsa En Mi", featuring background vocals from 2003 Grammy Award winner 
Rubén Blades and salsa legend Gilberto Santa Rosa. Also joining Williams 
is an all-star ensemble of musicians including multiple Grammy-winning 
banjo player Béla Fleck, keyboardist David Sancious, percussionist Luis 
Conte, bassist Leland Sklar, guitarist Tim Pierce, and drummers Kenny Aronoff 
and Shawn Pelton, among others. Williams' second major album, Moving Forward, 
was released on April 14, 2009 under the Reform Records label. The album 
features fourteen tracks and includes some collaborative tracks with other 
artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Patti Scialfa, Jon Secada, and Dave 
Koz.[31] Williams was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award for Moving Forward.[citation 
needed] In 2010, Williams participated in the World Rhythms Tour with Basia. 
On July 18, 2010 he performed at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean 
Games opening ceremony.[citation needed] In July 2011, Williams' book, 
Rhythms of the Game, co-authored by Williams, Dave Gluck and Bob Thompson, 
with a foreword by Paul Simon, was to be published by Hal Leonard Publishing.[32] 
Williams was featured on the November/December 2011 cover of Making Music 
Magazine to discuss his life and career in music.[33] Williams received 
his Bachelor of Music from the Manhattan School of Music on May 13, 2016.[34] 
Bernie's love of music shines through in his philanthropy efforts with 
Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit organization that works to restore 
and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. Little 
Kids Rock honored the New York Yankees icon with the 2010 "Big Man of the 
Year" award at the annual Right to Rock celebration. Williams performed 
onstage with students and signed some guitars to be auctioned. With the 
money he helped raise, Williams delivered instruments to a school in the 
Bronx and gave the students a lesson in music and life.[35] In August 2015 
Bernie Williams and Brandon Steiner made a surprise visit to Camp Adventure, 
and they helped revive the music program of KiDS NEED MORE, a charitable 
organization dedicated to creating camping experiences for children, families 
& young adults coping with cancer and life-threatening illnesses. The surprise 
visit aired September 15, 2015 on the YES Network on The Hook-Up: Camp 
Adventure. Bernie married wife Waleska on February 23, 1990.[citation needed] 
They live in Armonk, New York[36] and have three children: Bernie Jr., 
Beatriz, and Bianca.[citation needed] One song on Bernie's 2009 release 
"Moving Forward" is named after Beatriz (Lullaby for Beatriz). This song 
is performed by Bernie Williams and his brother, Hiram Williams on the 
cello. This song was recorded in Puerto Rico at the Alpha Recording Studios.[citation
