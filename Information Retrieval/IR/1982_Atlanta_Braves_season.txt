The 1982 Atlanta Braves went 89–73 and won the NL West division for the 
first time since 1969, but were swept 3 games to none by the St. Louis 
Cardinals in the NLCS. In 2014, Bobby Cox and Joe Torre were elected to 
the Baseball Hall of Fame as two of the most successful managers of the 
late-20th and early-21st centuries. Cox had won 2,564 regular-season games, 
five pennants and one World Series over 29 seasons; Torre had won 2,326 
games, six pennants and four World Series over his 29-year career. But 
when the 1981 season ended, those success stories seemed far-fetched, at 
best. And both men ended up unemployed, if only briefly. The New York Mets 
fired Torre on October 5, 1981; the Braves dismissed Cox three days later. 
Cox, finishing his fourth season during his first tour as Atlanta's manager, 
was only 266–323 (.452) with one over-.500 season; Torre was 286–420 (.405) 
in 4 1⁄2 seasons with the Mets. In both 1978 and 1979, Cox's Braves and 
Torre's Mets had each finished in the cellar of their respective National 
League divisions. Cox, then 40 years old, landed on his feet as manager 
of the American League Toronto Blue Jays—then a struggling expansion team 
in its fifth year of existence—on October 15, 1981; nine days later, Torre, 
41, was announced as Cox's successor in Atlanta, returning to the team 
where he had become an All-Star catcher during the 1960s. In different 
ways, the firings and hirings marked positive turning points in each man's 
career. Torre's 1982 Braves won their first 13 regular-season games en 
route to the National League West Division title, their first since 1969. 
In three full seasons with the Braves, he went 257–229 (.529) and became 
nationally known as a manager through the Braves' powerful WTBS Superstation. 
Although a later, 5 1⁄2-year term (1990–1995) with the St. Louis Cardinals 
was not as successful, Torre would earn his Hall of Fame credentials with 
a 12-year run (1996–2007) as manager of the New York Yankees, winning six 
AL championships and four World Series, and compiling a winning percentage 
of .605. Cox followed a different route to success. His talented but young 
1982 Blue Jays, though still below .500, won more games (78) than ever 
before in their history. Then they broke through, winning 89 games in both 
1983 and 1984. Finally, in 1985, they captured 99 victories to win the 
American League East Division by a two-game margin over the Yankees. The 
Jays held a three games to one edge in the 1985 American League Championship 
Series, only to drop three straight games and the AL pennant to the eventual 
world champion Kansas City Royals. Ted Turner's Braves, however, were heading 
in the opposite direction after 1982. He fired Torre after an 80–82 1984 
season, then fired two more managers, Eddie Haas and Bobby Wine, after 
they lost a combined 96 games in 1985. Turner turned to yet another manager 
for 1986, Chuck Tanner, but he also decided to replace his general manager, 
John Mullen, with a new baseball man: Cox, induced to return to Atlanta 
for a promotion and a multi-year contract. Cox would begin to rebuild the 
Braves from the front office, but the on-field losses continued to mount 
until Cox finally decided, on June 21, 1990, to return to uniform and the 
dugout as the team's manager. By 1991, the Braves would be National League 
champions. The Braves started very hot in 1982, winning their first 13 
games (April 6 through April 21) of the season, a new major league record 
(since equaled by the Milwaukee Brewers in 1987). The wins came at the 
expense of San Diego Padres (two), Houston Astros (six) and Cincinnati 
Reds (five). The streak began with a 1 – 0 victory in San Diego in the 
season opener and came to an end when the Reds edged the Braves 2 – 1 in 
Atlanta in the Braves' 14th game. The Braves lost five straight after their 
record start and by the end of May they were 27 – 20 and struggling. Some 
critics claimed the Braves were just living off the fat of their 13-game 
winning streak and that they were not as good as their record showed. Some 
of the critics even predicted that the Braves would drift slowly out of 
contention and would be out of the running by mid-summer. However, the 
Braves warmed up again, and they won 12 of their first 15 games in the 
month of June to jump to 16 games above the .500 mark at 39 wins and 23 
losses. This gave evidence that the Braves's 13 – 0 start was not just 
a fluke of luck, and this silenced their critics – at least for a while. 
Next, the Braves slowed down again, and the slipped to a 43 – 29 record 
on June 29, but then they reeled off another six-game winning streak to 
build up a 4½ game lead in the National League Western Division on July 
5. The Braves split their next four games, and they had a record of 51 
– 31 (20 games above .500) on July 9 following a 6 – 4 victory over the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. That meant the Braves were setting pace to win 100 
games for the season, which is a traditional mark for a very good team 
in either league. This was great improvement for a team that had struggled, 
mostly in the cellar, in 1975 through 1981. On the two days right before 
the All-Star Game, the Braves lost to the Pirates 6 – 1 and 3 – 1, but 
they were still on the top of the Western Division by two-games in the 
standings. The Braves started the second half of the 1982 season following 
the All-Star break with five wins versus only one loss in their first six 
games. This improved the Braves' won-loss record to 56–34 (22 games over 
.500) on July 20. Their lead over the second-place team in the division 
was then six games. That was the largest lead that a Braves team had ever 
achieved since the Braves had come to Atlanta for the 1966 season, even 
surpassing their largest divisional lead of their Western Division championship 
team of 1969. However, from July 21 to 25, the Braves endured a small dip. 
They lost three out of four games, and their offense was atrocious, with 
their being shut out in all three of the losses: once by the St. Louis 
Cardinals and twice by the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Braves scored a rather-average 
four runs in the game that they won. Nevertheless, the Braves were 20 games 
over .500 with a record of 57 wins and 37 losses. They were also settling 
in for an 11-game series in their home ballpark, followed by an 11-game 
road trip, all of which were against foes in the Western Division. The 
second-place San Diego Padres played against the Braves in Atlanta Stadium 
for the first four games. The Padres were followed by the third-place Los 
Angeles Dodgers for the next four games; and finally the fourth-place San 
Francisco Giants played three games against the Braves. Next, the Braves 
were back on the road again for four games with the Dodgers, three more 
with the Giants, and finally four more games versus the Padres. The Braves 
had a five-game lead in the standings when the home series versus the Padres 
began. The Braves began the series by sweeping a doubleheader against the 
Padres by 9–2 and 8–6 scores. The Braves repeated this game on the next 
night with another 8–6 victory. Their lead in the Western Division had 
increased to a high-water mark of eight games, and the Padres were on their 
way down and out of second place and out of contention. The Braves' primary 
stalker for the rest of the season became the Los Angeles Dodgers. With 
their 6–2 victory over the Padres on July 29, the Braves completed the 
four-game sweep, and the Braves' record soared to 61 wins and 37 losses 
– the first time since 1969 when the Braves once reached a high-water mark 
of 25 games over .500. The Braves held a nine-game lead over the Padres 
(at 53–47), and a 10½ game lead over the third-place Dodgers (52–49). The 
Giants (48–52) had nearly fallen out of contention, 14 games behind the 
Braves, and with a losing record. This lead of nine games in the standings 
was the largest lead that the Braves had ever had since they moved to Atlanta 
for the 1966 season. The Braves' All-Star outfielder Dale Murphy had 11 
hits in 16 at-bats in the sweep over the Padres, and for the season, he 
was batting .308 and leading the National League with 28 home runs and 
74 runs batted in (RBI). Their other big bats were those of their third 
baseman Bob Horner, who was batting .289 with 20 home runs so far, and 
their first baseman Chris Chambliss, a .259 hitter thus far with 11 homers 
and 48 RBI. Their only reliable starting pitcher was Phil Niekro (10–3, 
3.27 ERA), and their two big guns as relief pitchers were Steve Bedrosian 
with a 1.46 ERA, and Gene Garber with a 2.16 ERA and 19 saves already. 
The overall pitching staff had a 3.60 ERA, and the team batting average 
was .262. The Braves had scored 447 runs so far. Rick Camp, a part-time 
starter, was 8–4 with a 3.14 ERA This big lead in the Western Division 
did not last for long. During that stretch of 21 games against just the 
Dodgers, the Giants, the Padres, and the Montreal Expos, the Braves seemed 
to be moving in slow motion both on the pitcher's mound and in the batting 
boxes as they slumped badly and lost 19 out of 21 games – including an 
11-game losing steak and four-game losing streaks twice. The Dodgers, under 
their long-time manager Tommy Lasorda, had turned both hot and lucky at 
the same time. Eight out of those 19 losses during this frantic nose-dive 
by the Braves were to the Dodgers, who swept the Braves 4–0 in two series 
against them in a 10-day period. The Braves' wins and losses during these 
21 games were against the Dodgers (0–8), the Giants (1–5), the Padres (1–3), 
and the Expos (0–3). On August 18, the Braves lost their third game in 
a row to the Expos, completing another four-game losing streak, and their 
won-loss record had fallen to 63–56. In so doing, they had fallen into 
second place in the Western Division, four games behind the Dodgers, who 
had moved into first place by winning 16 out of 20 games. The Braves seemed 
to be ready to "turn turtle"[clarification needed] as a team and lose the 
Western Division for the 13th year in a row, and hence out of the post-season 
games once again. The Braves had not won a playoff series since they won 
the World Series in 1957, and they had played in few playoff games since 
then (seven vs. the New York Yankees in 1958, two vs. the Dodgers in 1959, 
and three vs. the New York Mets in 1969 – and losing nine of those games). 
However, the Braves righted themselves as a team, and their clouds of bad 
luck seemed to part. Beginning on August 19 with a win over the Expos in 
the last game of the series with them, the Braves roared back into first 
place by winning 13 out of 15 games while the Dodgers played ordinary baseball. 
On September 3, the Braves' won-loss record had improved to 76–58; they 
were ahead of the Dodgers by 2½ games. However, their travails were not 
over, as they once again lost four games in a row and fell back into second 
place behind the Dodgers. Now, it was time for head-to-head competition 
with the Dodgers again. The Braves defeated the Dodgers in two consecutive 
games, on September 8 and 9, to once again move into first place (with 
a 78–62 record) by 1½ games over the Dodgers. There was more hardship to 
come. The Braves lost eight out of 12 games, including six losses to a 
different nemesis this time, the Houston Astros. This dropped the Braves 
back into second place, a full three games behind the Dodgers on September 
22. However, the Braves won seven out of their next nine games, while the 
Dodgers played ordinary baseball, and the Braves moves into first place 
for good on September 28. However, there was a final day of severe tension 
on the last day of the season. Beginning that day, the Braves were one 
game ahead of the Dodgers, with the Braves holding an 89–72 record and 
the Dodgers holding an 88–73 record. The Braves had a game in the Eastern 
Time Zone earlier in the day, and the Dodgers had a game with the Giants 
in San Francisco later on in the day in the Pacific Time Zone. The Braves 
could have clinched the division championship by winning, but they lost 
their last game vs. the Padres 5–1 to fall to an 89–73 record. Then, in 
the later game, the Dodgers could have tied for first place by defeating 
the Giants. If that had happened, it would have required a one-game playoff 
between the Dodgers and the Braves to determine the Division champion. 
However, late in that game in San Francisco, former Cincinnati Reds' second 
baseman Joe Morgan hit a home run against the Dodgers to knock them down 
to an 88–74 record, and out of the playoffs. Phil Niekro finished the season 
as the pitching star of the Braves with a 17–4 record, and Dale Murphy 
won the National League Most Valuable Player trophy by winning the league 
championship in home runs, tying for the championship in RBIs, and winning 
a Gold Glove in the outfield. The Braves had won their second Western Division 
title, and they were bound for the National League Championship Series 
against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Braves had won the first-ever Western 
Division championship in 1969, the year in which the Eastern Division and 
the Western Division had been established. Then, the Braves had posted 
a 93–69 won-loss record by playing very strongly in second half of the 
season. For the Braves, Niekro himself had finished second for the Cy Young 
Award with 23 wins, and Hank Aaron had finished second in the league with 
44 home runs. Thus, each of these teams had won the division by having 
one truly outstanding pitcher, and one truly outstanding batter. Since 
the Braves had finished at 89–73, they had recorded a 76–73 record after 
beginning the season at 13–0. On the other hand, the Braves recorded a 
26–17 record after August 18. 1982 was just the Braves' second season with 
a winning record since they recorded an 88–74 record in 1974 and finished 
in third place in the Western Division. The Braves' only other (barely) 
winning season during that period was in 1980, when they struggled to an 
81–80 finish. (The Braves played an odd number of games in 1980 since they 
had a game rained out during the season, and since the 162nd game would 
have no effect whatsoever on the standings, no make-up game for that game 
was ever played. It had become a moot point by then.) Although it was their 
field manager Joe Torre who led the Braves back to the Western Division 
championship in 1982, there was a kernel of Braves' players who made the 
difference in this season. Two of these were Dale Murphy and Bob Horner, 
the latter of whom batted .261 with 32 home runs and 97 RBI – but missed 
most of August and September with a broken wrist that he suffered while 
diving for a batted ball while playing third base. Murphy, who usually 
batted ahead of Horner in the line-up, posted a healthier .281 batting 
average with 36 home runs, 109 RBI, and 23 stolen bases, and he also led 
the team in runs scored. As mentioned before, Murphy won the league MVP 
trophy. The Braves' first baseman, Chris Chambliss, batted .270, with 20 
home runs and 88 RBI.Outfielder Claudell Washington had one of his best 
seasons with the Braves in 1982. He batted .266 with 16 homers and 80 RBI. 
The twenty-four-year-old second base-shortstop duo of Glenn Hubbard and 
Rafael Ramírez proved to be stellar on defense, and steady on offense – 
often getting on base ahead of Murphy and Horner. They were adept at turning 
double plays around the second-base bag. Hubbard batted .248 with nine 
home runs and 59 RBI, while Ramírez batted higher with a .278 average, 
ten home runs, and 52 RBI. Their utility infielder Jerry Royster batted 
rather well over the final two months of the season (with a .322 BBA) to 
finish the season with a .295 average in 261 at-bats. He had been batting 
just .180 on July 29. Royster's value was seen, and his high number of 
at bats accumulated, in that he filled in for either Hubbard or Ramirez 
when they needed a day off, and he also filled in at third base for many 
weeks while Horner was suffering from his broken wrist. If the need had 
arisen, Royster was also capable of playing at first base or in the outfield. 
The part-time outfielder Rufino Linares batted .298 with two home runs 
and 17 RBI, but their opening-day starter in center field Brett Butler 
played well in the field, but he had an atrocious season at home plate 
where he batted just .217 and he hit just two doubles in 240 at bats (The 
slightly-built Butler never was a power hitter, and in 1982, he did not 
hit any homers.) The Braves's regular catcher Bruce Benedict batted .248 
with just three home runs – one of them a grand slam that he hit of the 
great Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela in a game during September. The 
Braves' backup catcher, Biff Pocoroba, finished with a .275 average in 
120 at bats. What the Braves lacked in their position players in 1982 were 
the following: The Braves pitching staff was led by Phil Niekro, who led 
the team in wins and in winning percentage with a 17–4 record, with a 3.61 
ERA in 35 starts. Niekro also led the team in strikeouts. Gene Garber was 
the top short-reliever in the bullpen, accumulating 30 saves in 69 games, 
with a 2.34 ERA. Steve Bedrosian was the best long-reliever, and he posted 
an 8–6 record and a 2.42 ERA in 64 games, including starting three games. 
Despite having a high 4.87 ERA with 27 games started, Bob Walk finished 
with an 11–9 won-lost record, tied for second on the team with Rick Camp 
who accumulated a record of 11–13, and a 3.85 ERA in 51 games, including 
starting 21 games. Rick Mahler also practically broke even with a 9–10 
record and a 4.21 ERA in 33 starts. Pascual Pérez, who was to become a 
star pitcher in 1983, started 11 games in 1982 and relieved in five games. 
He finished with a 4–4 record and a solid 3.06 ERA. Beyond Niekro, the 
Braves' starting pitching was extremely thin, and it caused a lot of problems. 
It was probably the work of a miracle worker that Joe Torre was able to 
get as much out of his starting pitchers as he did.[citation needed] Pascual 
Perez was also one year away from becoming a star pitcher for the Braves, 
which he did in 1983, along with a new rookie who came up in that same 
year. Walk did not last very long for the Braves, and Camp was destined 
to become a short-relief pitcher for the Braves in the future. Besides 
Niekro, the best thing that Torre had for his job of running a pitching 
staff made of bubble gum and bailing wire was his outstanding relief duo 
of Garber and Bedrosian. In Bedrosian, Torre had a future Cy Young Award 
Winner, but with the Philadelphia Phillies. Infielders Other batters Coaches
