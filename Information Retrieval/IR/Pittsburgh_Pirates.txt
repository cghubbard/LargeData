The Pittsburgh Pirates are an American professional baseball team based 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pirates compete in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division. The 
Pirates play their home games at PNC Park; the team previously played at 
Forbes Field and Three Rivers Stadium, the latter of which was named after 
its location near the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio 
Rivers. Founded on October 15, 1881[1] as Allegheny, the franchise has 
won five World Series championships. The Pirates are also often referred 
to as the "Bucs" or the "Buccos" (derived from buccaneer, a synonym for 
pirate). The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was 
competitive from its early years, winning three NL titles from 1901 to 
1903, playing in the inaugural World Series in 1903 and winning their first 
World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner. The Pirates have had many ups 
and downs during their long history, most famously winning the 1960 World 
Series against the New York Yankees on a game-winning walk-off home run 
by Bill Mazeroski, the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever 
ended with a home run, still to this day. They also won the 1971 World 
Series, led by the talent of Roberto Clemente, and the 1979 World Series 
under the slogan "We Are Family", led by "Pops" Willie Stargell. Overall, 
the Pirates have won five World Series and lost two. (The Pirates have 
won nine NL pennants which implies 9 World Series appearances. However, 
the first two NL pennants they won, as stated above, were in 1901 and 1902, 
before the creation of the World Series.) After a run of regular-season 
success in the early 1990s (winning three straight East Division titles), 
the Pirates struggled mightily over the following 20 years, with 20 consecutive 
losing seasons from 1993 to 2012—the longest such streak in North American 
professional sports history—before posting a winning record in 2013 of 
94–68, qualifying them for the NL Wild Card. They would then advance to 
the NL Division Series round, where they lost in 5 games to the St. Louis 
Cardinals. The Pirates would continue their success and make the playoffs 
in both 2014 and 2015, losing in the Wild Card Game both times. Professional 
baseball has been played in the Pittsburgh area since 1876. The teams of 
the era were "independents", barnstorming throughout the region and not 
affiliated with any organized league, though they did have salaries and 
were run as business organizations.[2] On October 15, 1881, the strongest 
team in the area joined the American Association as a founding member to 
begin play in 1882.[1] Their various home fields in the 19th century were 
in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River 
from Pittsburgh. The team was listed as "Allegheny" in the standings, and 
was sometimes called the "Alleghenys" (not the "Alleghenies") in the same 
generic way that teams from Boston, New York, and Chicago were sometimes 
called the "Bostons", the "New Yorks", and the "Chicagos", in the sports 
writing style of that era. After five mediocre seasons in the A.A., Pittsburgh 
became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. 
At this time, the team renamed itself the Pittsburgh Alleghenys,[3] although 
Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 
1907. At that time, owner-manager Horace Phillips sold the team to Dennis 
McKnight; Phillips stayed on as manager.[4] Before the 1890 season, nearly 
all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League's Pittsburgh 
Burghers. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players 
were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also 
scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously 
played with the AA's Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics had 
failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested 
the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed 
the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was "piratical".[5] This incident 
(which is discussed at some length in The Beer and Whisky League, by David 
Nemec, 1994) quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that 
contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never 
found guilty of wrongdoing, they made sport of being denounced for being 
"piratical" by renaming themselves "the Pirates" for the 1891 season.[3] 
The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. Around 
the time the team adopted the Pirates nickname, the United States Board 
on Geographic Names forced the city of Pittsburgh to undergo a controversial 
name change by having them drop the "h" at the end of the name, making 
the team's official name the "Pittsburg Pirates" from the adoption of the 
Pirates nickname until Pittsburgh was able to get the "h" restored to its 
name in 1911. The Pirates were a strong team in the early 1900s, winning 
National League pennants from 1901–1903 and taking their first World Series 
title in 1909. They again won the NL in 1925 and 1927 and the World Series 
in 1925. After a slow period, they returned to dominance and won the 1960 
World Series, 1971 World Series and 1979 World Series. They won Eastern 
Division titles from 1990–1992 but did not return to the post-season after 
that until 2013. On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss to the Cincinnati 
Reds represented its 10,000th franchise loss since moving to the NL. This 
made the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following 
the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, and Chicago Cubs.[6] Their victory 
over the Colorado Rockies later in 2015 on September 24 made them the 7th 
team in MLB history to reach 10,000 wins. The rivalry between the Philadelphia 
Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries 
in the National League.[7][8][9] The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh 
Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies.[10] The 
Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League 
split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play 
(1969 to 1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two 
highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively 
as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s.[9][11][12] 
the Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships 
accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that 
span.[11] After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, 
the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry 
has diminished.[8][9] However, many fans, especially older ones, retain 
their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern 
and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry.[13] The Pirates have 
long-standing, albeit sometimes dormant, rivalries with their fellow NL 
Central Division teams, including the Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals, 
Milwaukee Brewers (with the The Sausage incident and the 'You can steal 
first' game) and the Chicago Cubs (with the Homer in the Gloamin' and most 
recently, the 2015 NL Wild Card game). The intensity of the rivalries often 
depend upon the competitiveness of the teams involved during that season.

Deacon White Vic Willis Milo Hamilton Bob Prince Throughout the 1940s Pirates 
owner William Benswanger was a leading advocate of integration of the Major 
Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up 
for the club.[29] The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to 
have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke 
the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963 the 
Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in 
Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh.[30] On September 1, 1971, 
manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed 
of minorities for the first time in MLB history.[31] Despite having some 
notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton and 
Regis Philbin,[32] the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third 
in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in 
popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams. Many 
surveys have backed up this finding as well.[33] However, due to their 
long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has 
retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region. While the team's 
recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly 
to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the 
Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins 
the Stanley Cup four times in 1991, 1992, 2009, and 2016, including both 
in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity 
to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent 
as the late 1970s,[34] the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation 
threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.[35] 
The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team 
on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001.[36] Each year, the Pirates 
recognize six "Community Champions" during a special pregame ceremony.[37] 
Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 
January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. 
It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players 
and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, 
"Ask Pirates Management", and appearances by the Pirate Parrot. Piratefest 
is held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh.[38] 
In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team 
and a radio station in American professional sports. KDKA first broadcast 
the Pirates on August 5, 1921; with Westinghouse foreman Harold Arlin behind 
the mic. Broadcasts ended in 1924, but returned in 1936. Except for a few 
years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA 
for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across 
the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games. That changed 
for the 2007 season, when the Pirates moved to FM talk radio station WPGB. 
The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket 
coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear 
Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. 
The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four 
states. Stations for the 2007 season include Pennsylvania, West Virginia, 
Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.[39] On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel 
announced that they will not renew their deal with the Pirates. It was 
speculated that the club's radio broadcasting rights would likely be transferred 
back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM,[40] which became 
official on October 12.[41] On March 2, 2016 it was announced a new deal 
was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM.[42] Games are televised 
on Root Sports Pittsburgh, the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, 
when it was known as KBL. There has been no over-the-air coverage of the 
Pirates since 2002, when some games were on WCWB. KDKA-TV aired Pirates 
games for 38 years (1957–1994). Games aired on WPXI (1995–1996) and on 
WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997–2002). Announcers Greg Brown, Bob Walk, John Wehner, 
and Steve Blass shuttle between the radio and TV booths. After the departure 
of play-by-play announcer Tim Neverett, who accept a play-by-play radio 
position with the Boston Redsox[43] following the 2015 season, former Milwaukee 
Brewers announcer Joe Block will begin Play-by-Play Duties beginning with 
the 2016 season. Former Pirates closer Kent Tekulve, a member of the team's 
1979 World Series Championship team, serves as a post-game analyst for 
the team on Root Sports Pittsburgh. On October 1, 2008, longtime play-by-play 
announcer Lanny Frattare retired after 33 seasons, having called Pirates' 
games since the 1976 season. He is the longest-tenured announcer in Pirates' 
history, surpassing the man he replaced, the late Bob Prince (28 seasons, 
1948–1975). 1888: "Alleghenys" Logo 1900–1906 1907 1908–1909 1915–1919

Logo 2010–present: Alternate Logo 2014–present The Pirates have had many 
uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being 
the "P" on the team's cap. It was adopted in 1948. Aside from style changes 
in the cap itself, the "P" logo has remained since. The Pirates have long 
been innovators in baseball uniforms. In 1948, the team broke away from 
the patriotic "Red, White, & Blue" color scheme when they adopted the current 
black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh 
and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively 
unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL. While they were not the first baseball 
team to do this, they were one of the first to do this permanently. Along 
with the San Francisco Giants, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion 
National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red 
returned as an "accent color" in 1997 and remained until 2009. In the late 
1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by 
the team (that honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds), the Pirates did help 
to popularize the look. The team brought back the vested jerseys in 2001, 
a style they retained until 2009, although the away jerseys said "Pittsburgh" 
in script instead of "Pirates." In 2009, they introduced a new home, away 
and alternate black jersey all with sleeves. However, they kept the pinstriped 
sleeveless vest for Sunday home games. To coincide with the move into Three 
Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team introduced pullover spandex uniforms, 
the first such team in baseball, and a look that would quickly be adopted 
by most other teams by the end of the decade. The Pirates ditched the pullover 
style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the 
last teams to switch. The Pirates were also innovators in third jerseys. 
Even though it would be the Oakland A's that would beat them to having 
such jerseys, the Pirates, by 1977 had different uniform styles that included 
two different caps, two different undershirts, three different jerseys 
and three different pairs of trousers. They would actually rotate (and 
sometimes mix, with painful results) these styles daily until returning 
to the basic white and gray uniform ensemble in 1985. In 1976, the National 
League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL 
teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes. 
After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, 
(alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons until 
keeping the black hat in 1985) and kept the hat through the 1986 season, 
which would be Barry Bonds rookie season with the team. The hats, which 
recall the team's last World Series championship season (1979), remain 
popular items in the throwback market. The 2013 season marked the last 
of one of the team's former logos, introduced in 1997 just after former 
owner Kevin McClatchy took over the team. The Pirates chose to use the 
"P" on their caps as the primary logo; however, the former logo will continue 
to be used as a secondary logo.[45] On December 13, 2014, the Pirates unveiled 
a new camo alternate jersey, which honors the soldiers in the Armed Forces. 
It was worn on every Thursday home game during the 2015 season. On February 
18, 2016, the Pirates unveiled a new throwback alternate uniform in the 
style of the 1979 team. This uniform features yellow jerseys and old-style 
pillbox hats. It will be worn on every Sunday home game during the 2016
