Augusta–Richmond County US /ə.ˈɡʌs.tə/ is a consolidated city-county on 
the central eastern border of the U.S. state of Georgia, and located at 
the fall line of the Savannah River, at the head of its navigable portion. 
It is in the piedmont section of the state. The city was named after Princess 
Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (1719–1772). According to 2012 US Census estimates, 
the Augusta–Richmond County population was 197,872, not counting the unconsolidated 
cities of Hephzibah and Blythe. Augusta is the principal city of the Augusta–Richmond 
County Metropolitan Statistical Area, which as of 2012 had an estimated 
population of 580,270, making it the third-largest city and the second-largest 
metro area in the state after Atlanta. It is the 116th-largest city in 
the United States. Internationally, Augusta is best known for hosting The 
Masters golf tournament each spring. The area along the river was long 
inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, who relied on the 
river for fish, water and transportation. The site of Augusta was used 
by Native Americans as a place to cross the Savannah River, because of 
its location on the fall line. In 1735, two years after James Oglethorpe 
founded Savannah, he sent a detachment of troops to explore the upper Savannah 
River. He gave them an order to build at the head of the navigable part 
of the river. The expedition was led by Noble Jones, who created the settlement 
to provide a first line of defense for coastal areas against potential 
Spanish or French invasion from the interior. Oglethorpe named the town 
Augusta, in honor of Princess Augusta, wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales 
(she was the mother of King George III of the United Kingdom). Oglethorpe 
visited Augusta once, in September 1739. He did so while returning to Savannah 
from a perilous visit to Coweta Town, where he had met with a convention 
of 7,000 Native American warriors and concluded peaceful relations with 
several Native American groups in what is today the northern and western 
part of Georgia.[8] Augusta was the second state capital of Georgia from 
1785 until 1795 (alternating for a period with Savannah, the first). Augusta 
developed rapidly as a market town as the Black Belt in the Piedmont was 
developed for cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing 
of short-staple cotton profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited 
to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, with 
hundreds of thousands of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep 
South in the domestic slave trade. Many of the slaves were brought from 
the Lowcountry, where their Gullah culture had developed on the large Sea 
Island cotton and rice plantations As a major city in the area, Augusta 
was a center of activities during Reconstruction and after. In the mid-20th 
century, it was a site of civil rights demonstrations. In 1970 Charles 
Oatman, a mentally disabled teenager, was killed by his cellmates in an 
Augusta jail. A protest against his death broke out in a riot involving 
500 people, after six black men were killed by police,[9] each found to 
have been shot in the back.[10] The noted singer and entertainer James 
Brown was called in to help quell lingering tensions, which he succeeded 
in doing.[9] Augusta is located on the Georgia/South Carolina border, about 
150 miles (240 km) east of Atlanta and 70 miles (110 km) west of Columbia. 
The city is located at 33°28′12″N 81°58′30″W﻿ / ﻿33.47000°N 81.97500°W﻿ 
/ 33.47000; -81.97500 (33.470, −81.975).[11] According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the Augusta–Richmond County balance has a total area of 
306.5 square miles (793.8 km2). 302.1 square miles (782.4 km2) of it is 
land and 4.3 square miles (11.1 km2) of it (1.42%) is water. Augusta is 
located about halfway up the Savannah River on the fall line, which creates 
a number of small falls on the river. The city marks the end of a navigable 
waterway for the river and the entry to the Georgia Piedmont area. The 
Clarks Hill Dam is built on the fall line near Augusta, forming Clarks 
Hill Lake. Farther downstream, near the border of Columbia County, is the 
Stevens Creek Dam, which generates hydroelectric power. Even farther downstream 
is the Augusta Diversion Dam, which marks the beginning of the Augusta 
Canal and channels Savannah River waters into the canal.[12] As with the 
rest of the state, Augusta has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), 
with short, mild winters, very hot, humid summers, and a wide diurnal temperature 
variation throughout much of the year. The monthly daily average temperature

are 53 nights with the low reaching the freezing mark, 82 days reaching 
or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C), and 5.5 days reaching 100 °F (38 °C) annually. 
Extreme temperatures range from −1 °F (−18 °C) on January 21, 1985 up to 
108 °F (42 °C) on August 10, 2007 and August 21, 1983. Snowfall is not 
nearly as common as in Atlanta, due largely to Augusta's elevation, with 
downtown Augusta being about 900 ft (270 m) lower than downtown Atlanta. 
Freezing rain is also a threat in wintertime. Augusta Downtown Historic 
District is a historic district that encompasses most of downtown Augusta 
and its pre-Civil War area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic

largest employers are Augusta University, the Savannah River Site (a Department

and a relatively high state unemployment rate,[25] the Augusta community 
has experienced a decrease in bankruptcy filings[26] and saw a slight decrease 
in the unemployment rate from late 2009 to March 2011. However, these unemployment 
numbers are misleading as spring brings lower unemployment rates due to 
the Masters Golf Tournament. While unemployment fell to a two-year low 
of 8.3% in April 2011, unemployment rates have since risen to 9.9% as of 
July 2011.[27] Companies that have facilities, headquarters or distribution
