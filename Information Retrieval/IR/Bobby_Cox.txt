As player As manager Robert Joseph "Bobby" Cox (born May 21, 1941) is an 
American former professional baseball third baseman and manager in Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He first led the Atlanta Braves from 1978 to 1981, 
and then managed the Toronto Blue Jays from 1982 to 1985. He later rejoined 
the Braves in 1985 as a general manager. He moved back to the manager's 
role during the 1990 season and stayed there until his retirement following 
the 2010 season. The Atlanta Braves have since retired the number 6 in 
commemoration of Bobby Cox.[1] He led the Atlanta Braves to the World Series 
championship in 1995. He holds the all-time record for ejections in Major 
League Baseball with 158 (plus an additional three post-season ejections[2]), 
a record previously held by John McGraw.[3] Cox ranks fourth on the baseball 
all-time managerial wins list. As a player, Cox originally signed with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, but was never able to make the Dodgers' major 
league team. Eventually he was acquired by the Braves, but never appeared 
in an MLB game for them either. Instead, he was traded to the New York 
Yankees on December 7, 1967. Cox played two seasons, mostly at third base, 
for the Yankees. Because of bad knees, Cox became the second in a string 
of four stopgap players between Clete Boyer and Graig Nettles. Prior to 
managing in the States, Cox played from 1967 to 1970 for the Cardenales 
de Lara and Leones del Caracas clubs of the Venezuelan Winter League.[4] 
He later managed the Cardenales during three consecutive seasons from 1974–75 
through 1976–77.[5] In between, he coached and managed in the Yankees minor 
league system. Cox began his managerial career in the Yankees farm system 
in 1971. In 1976, he led the Syracuse Chiefs to the Governors' Cup title. 
This team featured such future major leaguers as Ron Guidry, Mickey Klutts, 
Terry Whitfield and Juan Bernhardt. Overall, Cox had a highly successful 
six-year tenure as a minor league manager, compiling a record of 459 wins 
and 387 defeats (.543) with two league championships. He then spent the 
1977 season as the first base coach on Billy Martin's staff with the World 
Series–winning Yankees before beginning his MLB managerial career. Cox 
replaced Dave Bristol as the manager of the Atlanta Braves prior to the 
1978 season, inheriting a team that had finished last in the league during 
the previous two seasons and, in 1977, compiled a worse record than the 
first-year Seattle Mariners of the American League. Building from the ground 
up, the Braves finished last in both 1978 and 1979. Entering 1980, Cox 
made one of the unusual moves for which he is known, moving power-hitting 
first baseman–catcher Dale Murphy, who had developed a throwing block as 
a catcher that hindered his ability to play, to center field. Murphy later 
won two National League Most Valuable Player Awards and five Gold Gloves, 
and became one of the premier players of the 1980s.[6] In 1980, the Braves 
finished fourth with their first record above .500 since 1974. However, 
Cox was undone by the 1981 baseball strike when the Braves finished fifth 
and owner Ted Turner fired him. Asked at a press conference who was on 
his short list for manager, Turner replied, "It would be Bobby Cox if I 
hadn't just fired him. We need someone like him around here." The Braves 
won the National League West division title in 1982 and finished second 
in both 1983 and 1984 under Cox's successor Joe Torre. Cox finished with 
a record of 266 wins and 323 losses in the regular season.[7] Cox joined 
the Toronto Blue Jays in 1982, who steadily improved over the four years 
of his management. In 1985, Cox's fourth season with the club, the Blue 
Jays finished in first place in the American League East. That season, 
the American League Championship Series was expanded to a best-of-seven 
format after sixteen seasons of a best-of-five format. This change ultimately 
made the difference when Cox's Blue Jays became only the fifth team to 
lose a playoff series after leading 3 games to 1 to the Kansas City Royals. 
He finished his stint as manager with a record of 355 wins and 292 losses 
regular season record.[7] After the Blue Jays' elimination, Cox returned 
to the Braves as general manager. After going through two managers over 
the course of less than five years with disastrous results in attendance 
and outlook, Cox fired Russ Nixon in June 1990, and appointed himself as 
the manager. Cox had spent the prior four seasons accumulating talented 
players, including Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, Pete Smith, and David Justice. 
He was also responsible for drafting Chipper Jones with the first overall 
pick in the 1990 draft.[8] In 1991, the Braves, along with the Minnesota 
Twins, became the first teams to go from last place to first place from 
one year to the next. The two teams met in the 1991 World Series, which 
the Twins won in seven games. It was the second World Series in which the 
home team won every game. The first was in 1987 when the Twins defeated 
the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. In 1992, Cox's Braves held a 3–1 
lead in the National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates before losing games 5 and 6, although they did win Game 7 on Francisco 
Cabrera's ninth-inning, two-out, pinch-hit, two-run single. They went on 
to lose the World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays. In 1993, the Braves 
had the best record in baseball after a pennant race where they overcame 
a ten-game deficit in August to beat the San Francisco Giants. By going 
51–17 over the last two and a half months of the season, they won the division 
by a game. However, they lost the National League Championship Series in 
six games to the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1995, the Atlanta Braves won 
Cox's only World Series championship, over the Cleveland Indians. Their 
division title in 1995 marked the first time since 1989 that neither the 
Philadelphia Phillies nor the Pittsburgh Pirates won the National League 
East. In May 1995, Cox was arrested on simple battery charge after his 
wife called 911 and said Cox hit her. She retracted the statement the following 
day, and the charges were dropped after the couple attended court-ordered 
counseling.[9] In 1996, the Braves again won the division title. After 
sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers in the division series, the Braves' pitching 
fell behind the St. Louis Cardinals, three games to one in the 1996. Facing 
elimination, the Braves offense outscored the Cardinals 33–1 over the final 
three games and won the pennant. Cox became the only manager in history 
to lose a series leading three games to one and win a series trailing three 
games to one.[10] The scoring continued into the first two games against 
the New York Yankees as the Braves took a two games to none lead by winning 
with scores of 12–1 and 4–0 in the World Series. In game four, the Braves 
led 6–0 in the fourth inning, but the Yankees came from behind. Jim Leyritz 
homered to tie the game, and the Yankees tied the series with a win in 
11 innings, 8–6. The Yankees would ultimately win in 6 games. The Braves 
lost to the Florida Marlins in the 1997 NLCS and the San Diego Padres in 
the 1998 NLCS. The Braves made it back to the World Series in 1999, but 
lost to the defending World Series Champion New York Yankees in four straight 
games. Cox's 2001 team won the division title and upset the favored Houston 
Astros in three straight games in the division series. However, the Arizona 
Diamondbacks defeated the Braves in five games in the NLCS. One of Cox's 
memorable games as manager of the Braves during this period came on September 
21, 2001, when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional 
sporting event played in New York City since the 9/11 attacks. Cox's Braves 
did not advance past the first round of the playoffs in any of their last 
five appearances. In 2002, the Braves won 101 games and led the wild card 
San Francisco Giants two games to one before dropping the last two. In 
2003, the Braves pushed the Chicago Cubs to the fifth game before falling. 
The following year, the Braves lost in the best-of-five Division Series 
for the third straight year. In 2005, the Braves lost to the Houston Astros, 
with the finale taking eighteen innings to decide in the 2005 NLDS. On 
September 23, 2009, Cox signed a one-year contract extension through 2010, 
and on the same day announced that 2010 would be his final year as manager. 
He also announced that he agreed to stay on as an advisor for team baseball 
operations for the next five years after he retires. On October 2, 2010, 
the Atlanta Braves honored Bobby Cox at Turner Field in a sold-out game. 
On October 3, 2010, Cox led the Braves to an 8–7 win over the Phillies 
and clinched both his and the Braves' first wild card. His final game was 
on October 11, 2010, when the Braves were eliminated by the San Francisco 
Giants in Game 4 of the National League Division Series. He was given a 
standing ovation by the crowd and both teams immediately following the 
game.[11] He finished with a record of 1,883 wins and 1,386 losses in the 
regular season and 64 wins and 65 losses in the post-season.[7] His record 
from both stints as manager is 2,149 wins and 1,709 losses for a .557 winning 
percentage in 3,858 games.[7] His overall managerial record is 2,504 wins 
and 2,001 losses in the regular season and 67 wins and 69 losses in the 
post-season.[7] Cox has been named Manager of the Year four times (1985, 
1991, 2004, 2005) and is one of only four managers to have won the award 
in both the American and National League. He is also the only person to 
have won the award in consecutive years. Cox has also been named Manager 
of the Year by The Sporting News eight times (1985, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2002, 
2003, 2004, and 2005). On May 12, 2007, Cox passed Sparky Anderson to become 
the fourth-winningest manager in major league history, with a record of 
2,195 wins and 1,698 losses. He led the Braves to a division title every 
season from 1991 to 2005, excluding the strike-shortened 1994 season; the 
Braves have competed in the National League East since 1994 and competed 
in the National League West prior to that. He won a World Series Championship 
in 1995. In 2001, he took sole possession of first place for most wins 
as a manager in Braves history.[12] Cox's .561 winning percentage is fourteenth 
in all-time among managers with at least 1,000 games managed, and is the 
second highest among those who managed the majority of their career after 
the creation of divisions within each league in 1969. On June 8, 2009, 
Cox won his 2,000th game with the Atlanta Braves, becoming only the fourth 
manager in Major League history to accomplish that feat with one team.[13] 
Cox reached career win number 2,500 on September 25, 2010, becoming only 
the fourth manager in Major League history to do so.[14] On September 17, 
2010, Cox was ejected for the 158th time in his Major League coaching career 
during the second inning of a Braves game against the New York Mets; he 
currently holds the all-time record for most ejections (set on August 14, 
2007 with his 132nd), previously held by John McGraw.[15] By a strange 
twist of fate, his first ejection happened when manager of the Braves in 
a game against the Mets, on May 1, 1978.[16] Unlike McGraw, Cox did not 
have a reputation for having a fiery temper and Cox generally only got 
ejected to prevent his players from being ejected. In the 156 games that 
Bobby Cox was ejected, his teams had a winning percentage of .385.[16] 
In a July 2006 game, Cox was unable to save outfielder Jeff Francoeur from 
ejection; speaking with Atlanta Journal-Constitution beat writer David 
O'Brien, Francoeur recounted his manager's advice after both men had been 
sent to the Braves clubhouse: Cox is also the only person among all players 
and managers to be ejected from two World Series games (1992 and 1996). 
He was ejected in the ninth inning of game three of the 1992 World Series 
for throwing a batting helmet onto the field at the SkyDome. Cox was trying 
to slam the helmet against the lip of the dugout and missed, throwing it 
onto the field.[17] Cox was tossed again in the final game of the 1996 
World Series after protesting an out call of Marquis Grissom attempting 
to take second base on a passed ball. Although video replays appeared to 
show Grissom as safe, umpire Terry Tata called him out, and Cox was tossed 
in an ensuing argument.[17] On August 12, 2011 a luncheon was held by the 
Braves, and Cox was inducted into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame and his 
number six jersey was retired. Afterward, an on-field ceremony was held 
that recognized the long-time Braves manager prior to the scheduled game 
versus the Chicago Cubs.[18][19] Cox was unanimously elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame by the 16-member Veterans Committee on December 9, 2013. The 
ceremony was held on July 27, 2014.[20] Cox was hired on September 22, 
2014 to return on a part-time basis to help the Atlanta Braves choose their 
next General Manager and Director of Player Development after the dismissal 
of General Manager Frank Wren and Player Personnel Director Bruce Manno.
