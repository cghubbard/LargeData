Ronald Lee Reed (born November 2, 1942) is a retired American starting/relief 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Atlanta Braves (1966–75), 
St. Louis Cardinals (1975), Philadelphia Phillies (1976–83) and Chicago 
White Sox (1984). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 19-season career, 
Reed posted a 146-140 record with a 3.46 ERA, 103 saves, 1,481 strikeouts, 
eight shutouts, 55 complete games, and 2,477 2⁄3 innings in 751 appearances 
(236 as a starter). He is one of only five pitchers in MLB history to have 
100 wins, 100 saves and 50 complete games. The other four are Ellis Kinder, 
Firpo Marberry, Dennis Eckersley, and John Smoltz[1] In Reed's second full 
season of baseball, he was chosen to represent the Atlanta Braves as a 
member of 1968 National League All-Star team. He pitched in the ninth inning, 
following future Hall of Famers Don Drysdale, Juan Marichal, Steve Carlton 
and Tom Seaver on the mound for the NL, and helped preserve a 1-0 victory. 
The following season, he won a career-high 18 games to help Atlanta to 
its first NL division title. On April 8, 1974, he was the winning pitcher 
the night Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run.[2] Reed led 
MLB with 13 relief wins in 1979 while a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Reed is one of only eight pitchers in history (with John Smoltz, Elroy 
Face, Dennis Eckersley, Bob Stanley, Rich Gossage, Dave Giusti and Hoyt 
Wilhelm) to have at least 100 wins and 100 saves. In 2005, Ron Reed was 
inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.[3] Over 
the course of his career, Reed's teams have reached the postseason on 7 
occasions. He pitched the inaugural National League Championship Series 
in 1969 with Atlanta (vs. New York) as well as in 1976 with Philadelphia 
(vs. Cincinnati), 1977–1978 (vs. Los Angeles), 1980 (vs. Houston), and 
1983 (vs. Los Angeles). He also pitched in the inaugural National League 
Division Series in 1981 with Philadelphia (vs. Montreal); the Division 
Series format was adopted as a result of the players' strike. Reed also 
pitched in 2 World Series while with Philadelphia: 1980 (vs. Kansas City) 
and 1983 (vs. Baltimore). In the 7 seasons, Reed compiled an 0-2 record

(NBA) Draft.[4] He later played in NBA for the Detroit Pistons (1965–67).
