The Golden Age of Cricket is a term that has often been applied in cricket 
literature to the period in English, Australian,[1] and American cricket 
from the formation of the official County Championship in the 1890 season 
to the outbreak of World War I, which occurred just before the scheduled 
end of the 1914 season.[2][3][4] The period became infused with a nostalgic 
yearning, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to "the 
spirit of the game".[4] More poignantly, the nostalgia was due to loss 
of life in the Great War and a hankering for those happier times before 
the war's outbreak. A number of first-class cricketers were killed or wounded 
during the war, the deaths including eight Test players: Colin Blythe, 
Major Booth and Kenneth Hutchings of England, Tibby Cotter of Australia, 
and the four South Africans Reginald Hands, Bill Lundie, Reggie Schwarz 
and Gordon White. The war years also saw the deaths of W G Grace and Victor 
Trumper, who both succumbed to illness in 1915. Cricket of the period did 
feature numerous great names such as Grace, Trumper, Blythe, Wilfred Rhodes, 
Jack Hobbs, C B Fry, K S Ranjitsinhji, and Frank Woolley, but that in itself 
is not unique, as any period in cricket history can boast its great players. 
As David Frith pointed out,[4] the nostalgia "needed someone to put a perspective 
on it". In his 1939 autobiography, Fry wrote: "I have a notion that the 
cricket of the nineties and early nineteen hundreds was more amusing to 
watch, but I am not at all sure that the game of today is not more difficult 
to play."[5] In Australian cricket, the period is also considered a golden 
age. Cricket writer Jack Pollard wrote: "The golden age of cricket has 
always been regarded as the period between 1890 and 1914. For in all those 
years all the skills of the game flowered and an unprecedented array of 
great batsman and bowlers delighted informed and appreciative galleries. 
More importantly the players of that time set standards for sportsmanship 
that lifted cricket above other games and established it as a character-builder 
and an integral part of the social scene."[6] Writer Gideon Haigh said 
of Australian batsman Victor Trumper: "If it is possible for a cricketer 
to be their period, rather than merely part of it, then Trumper is the 
Golden Age of Cricket. In the gaiety and gallantry of his strokeplay, the 
charm of his personality, even in his frailty, transience and suddenness 
of death, Trumper personifies what we understand as the values and nature 
of his time."[7] Test cricket between England and Australia was well established 
by the time the Australians visited England in the 1890 season. The two 
countries played 15 series between 1890 and 1914, including the 1912 Triangular 
Tournament in which South Africa also took part. It was during the Golden 
Age that Test cricket first achieved its hegemony over other forms of first-class 
cricket.[8] Overseas tours by English teams started being organised by 
the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and were no longer private speculations. 
England's captains against Australia were W G Grace, Andrew Stoddart, Archie 
MacLaren, Plum Warner, Stanley Jackson, A O Jones, Frederick Fane, Johnny 
Douglas, and C B Fry. Australia's captains against England were Billy Murdoch, 
Jack Blackham, George Giffen, Harry Trott, Joe Darling, Hugh Trumble, Monty 
Noble, Clem Hill and Syd Gregory. South Africa had played their first Test 
in 1888-9, but initially they were very weak; up to 1898-9 they had played 
eight Tests against England and lost them all. They played Australia for 
the first time in 1902-3, and had the limited satisfaction of avoiding 
defeat in one of the three matches. However, in 1905-6, they beat England 
by four matches to one, thanks partly to the emergence of four googly bowlers: 
Reggie Schwarz, Bert Vogler, Aubrey Faulkner, and Gordon White.[9] Schwarz 
had learnt how to bowl the googly from its originator, Bernard Bosanquet, 
while in England and had passed on the secret to the others. On South Africa's 
next tour of England, in 1907, they narrowly lost the Test series one-nil 
with two matches drawn, but in 1909-10 won by three matches to two. After 
that, however, their results declined, although the 1910-11 series in Australia 
was competitive. The period also saw the brief flowering of Philadelphian 
cricket. Three tours were undertaken to England during which the side played 
on level terms with the leading counties. The Philadelphians played ten 
first-class games on their final tour in 1908, winning four and losing 
six.[10] This tour was highlighted by Bart King, who took 87 wickets and 
topped the England bowling averages with the figure of 11.01. This was 
not bettered until 1958 when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average
