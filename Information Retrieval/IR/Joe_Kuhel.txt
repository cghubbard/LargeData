As player As manager Joseph Anthony Kuhel (June 25, 1906 – February 26, 
1984) was an American professional baseball player and manager. Born in 
Cleveland, Ohio, he was a first baseman who played in the Major Leagues 
from 1930–46 for the Washington Senators (1930–37; 1944–46) and Chicago 
White Sox (1938–43; 1946–47). He batted and threw left-handed, stood 6 
feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 180 pounds (82 kg). Following his playing 
career, Kuhel managed the Senators (1948–49). In an 18-season career, Kuhel 
was a .277 hitter with 131 home runs and 1,049 RBI in 2,104 games played. 
Kuhel was the best defensive first baseman in the American League during 
the 1930s, but also was an inconsistent player who struggled with injuries 
most of his career. Hampered by playing in Griffith Stadium most of his 
career, his power numbers were never as good as they may have been in a 
more favorable park for long-ball hitters. Kuhel started his major league 
career with the Washington in 1930 and replaced Joe Judge on a regular 
basis a year later. He appeared in 139 games, batting .269 with eight home 
runs and 85 RBI. In the Senators' pennant year of 1933, Kuhel hit 11 home 
runs with 107 RBIs and posted career-highs in batting average (.322) and 
hits (194). He also led AL first basemen with 1,498 putouts. Kuhel seemed 
headed to another solid season in 1934, hitting .289 with three homers 
in 63 games, but he suffered a broken ankle in July and was out for the 
remainder of the season. He was healthy in 1935, hitting .261 with 74 RBIs 
in 151 games. His most productive season came in 1936, when he hit .321 
with 16 home runs and set career-highs in doubles (42), RBIs (118) and 
slugging percentage (.502), while swiped 15 bases and struck out just 30 
times. He finished sixth in the American League MVP Award voting tied with 
Vern Kennedy, behind Lou Gehrig, Luke Appling, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer 
and Bill Dickey, and over Joe DiMaggio, Tommy Bridges, Hal Trosky and Jimmie 
Foxx. After his stellar season, Kuhel slumped in 1937, batting .283 but 
with low numbers in home runs, RBIs and slugging (6, 61, .400). Before 
the 1938 season he was traded to the Chicago White Sox for slugger Zeke 
Bonura in a swap of first basemen. In the more forgiving Comiskey Park, 
Kuhel hit for more power, averaging 18 home runs from 1939 to 1941, and 
tying Bonura's franchise record with 27 homers in 1940. But after struggling 
to .249, four homers, 52 RBIs in 1942, and .213, 5, 46 in 1943, Kuhel was 
let go by Chicago. Before the 1944 season Kuhel returned to Washington. 
He hit .282 in his first two seasons back in a Senators' uniform, but when 
Mickey Vernon returned from World War II in 1946, Kuhel was expendable 
and was sold back to the White Sox in the midseason. After three pinch-hit 
appearances in 1947 he retired as a player to manage a White Sox farm team, 
the Class C Hot Springs Bathers. Then, in 1948 Kuhel was brought back to 
Washington to manage the Senators. In two seasons, he had a 106–201 (.345) 
record that produced seventh- and eighth-place finishes. After being fired,[1] 
he managed the Kansas City Blues in the American Association. Kuhel died
