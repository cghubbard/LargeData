William Hendrick "Bill" Foster (June 12, 1904 – September 16, 1978) was 
an American left-handed pitcher in baseball's Negro leagues in the 1920s 
and 1930s, and had a career record of 143-69.[1] He was elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. Foster was the much-younger half-brother 
of Rube Foster, a Negro league player, pioneer, and fellow Hall of Famer. 
Foster was born in 1904 in Calvert, Texas. He had the same father as Rube 
Foster, who was a Negro league player, manager and owner. Rube Foster was 
a key figure in the founding of the Negro National League.[2] Bill Foster's 
mother died when he was four years old, so he was raised by his grandparents 
in Rodney, Mississippi.[3] He did not meet his older half-brother until 
he was a teenager.[4] Foster played for the Memphis Red Sox in 1923 and 
1924, the Chicago American Giants from 1925 to 1930—and again from 1932 
to 1935 and in 1937—the Homestead Grays and Kansas City Monarchs in 1931, 
and the Pittsburgh Crawfords in 1936. Foster played for Chicago American 
Giants teams that won the Negro National League pennant and the Negro League 
World Series championship in 1926 and 1927, the Negro Southern League pennant 
in 1932, and the Negro National League pennant in 1933.[5] He was the player-manager 
of the team in 1930.[6] In 1926, Foster won 23 games in a row and 26 overall, 
but his most amazing performance came the last day of the playoffs to determine 
the Negro National League title. Needing to win both games of a doubleheader 
against the Kansas City Monarchs, Foster hurled complete game shutouts 
in both games of a doubleheader against Bullet Joe Rogan and the Monarchs, 
1–0 and 5–0, to put the Giants in the World Series.[7][8] In 1931 Foster, 
as a pitcher for the Homestead Grays, recorded a 10–2 record against rival 
African-American teams.[9] His record against rival African-American teams 
increases to 11–3, if you count the games that were won and lost in Alcorn, 
Mississippi, when Syd Pollock's Cubans House of Davids visited Alcorn College 
prior to Foster joining the Grays. Foster finished the 1931 campaign with 
J. L. Wilkinson's Kansas City Monarchs where on October 4, 1931 he blew 
his fastball past a major league all-star team composed of such legendary 
men as Babe Herman, Joe Kuhel and both Waner brothers, Lloyd and Paul. 
In the game played at Kansas City's Muehlebach Field, Foster captured a 
4–3 win. During the 1931 season Foster struck out ten men in a game on 
nine different occasions and posted a seasonal high of sixteen strikeouts 
in Vandergrift, Pennsylvania, on August 6. He also recorded four shutouts. 
Foster finished 1931 with a 23-5 record. He was the top vote getter and 
the winning pitcher in the first East-West All-Star Game in 1933, and was 
on the All-Star team again in 1934. Foster's pitch selection included a 
fastball, overhand curve, slider, sidearm curve, and a changeup.[10] Baseball 
people often characterized Foster as one of the game's great players. Umpire 
Jocko Conlan said Foster had "the same perfect delivery of Herb Pennock, 
but was faster by far, with a sharp curve, and had what all great pitchers 
have – control." Charlie Gehringer once told Foster, "If I could paint 
you white I could get $150,000 for you right now." Negro league player 
and manager Dave Malarcher favorably compared him to Negro league legend 
Satchel Paige, saying, "Bill Foster was my star pitcher, the greatest pitcher 
of our time, not even barring Satchel."[11] After retiring from professional 
baseball in 1936, Foster moved to Tarboro, North Carolina, where his childhood 
sweetheart Thelma Quigless lived. He also played semiprofessional baseball 
in 1940 in nearby Princeville, North Carolina. Foster and Quigless were 
married in 1941. Foster took a job in insurance policy sales with the North 
Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. He later divorced Quigless.[2] 
Foster married again and returned to Mississippi. From 1960 to 1977, Foster 
was a dean and the baseball coach at his alma mater, Alcorn Agricultural 
and Mechanical College. In 1978 Foster died in Lorman, Mississippi.[2] 
The Foster Baseball Field at McGowan Stadium in Lorman, the home field 
for Alcorn State baseball, is named for him.[12] Foster was inducted into 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. He was elected to the Southwestern Athletic 
Conference Hall of Fame the next year.[13] In 2003, he was voted in to
