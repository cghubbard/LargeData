May 26, 2016 Tropicana Field, St. Petersburg, Florida The Citrus Series 
is the name given to the interleague series between the Miami Marlins and 
Tampa Bay Rays in Major League Baseball. The Marlins broke into the league 
in 1993 as the Florida Marlins,[1] while the Rays had their first season 
in 1998 as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[2] The first meeting between the two 
teams took place on June 22, 1998 at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, 
Florida during the Rays' inaugural season. Beginning with the 2012 season, 
when the Marlins are the home team, games are played at Marlins Park. From 
1998 to 2011, the games were played at Sun Life Stadium (as it is currently 
named), though it has been known by several names in its existence. Currently, 
because the Marlins play in the National League, and the Rays in the American 
League, the only possible postseason matchup the teams can have is in the 
World Series, though this has never happened as the two teams have yet 
to appear in the same postseason. Both teams have had appearances in the 
Fall Classic, however. The Marlins have won both of their World Series 
appearances in 1997 and 2003, while the Rays lost their only appearance 
in 2008. Former Rays manager Joe Maddon said he does not consider the Citrus 
Series a true rivalry. "I really don't honestly believe the fans see it 
as being a rivalry, I really don't. The best way to get that done is to 
include us in the same league or the same division. That might stir something 
up."[3][4] Weeks after the Marlins concluded a characteristic fire sale 
that brought in less expensive players such as Yunel Escobar from the Toronto 
Blue Jays, the Marlins traded Escobar to the Rays for minor leaguer Derek
