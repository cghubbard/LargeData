Fox Sports Indiana is an American regional sports network that is owned 
by Fox Cable Networks, a unit of the Fox Entertainment Group division of 
21st Century Fox, and operates as an affiliate of Fox Sports Networks. 
The channel broadcasts local professional and high school sports coverage 
throughout the state of Indiana, with a focus on professional sports teams 
based in Indianapolis, namely the NBA's Indiana Pacers. The channel is 
available on cable providers throughout Central Indiana, and is also available 
nationwide on DirecTV. Fox Sports Indiana was launched on November 1, 2006 
as a spin-off channel of Fox Sports Midwest, after the regional sports 
network obtained the exclusive regional cable television rights to broadcast 
games from the Indiana Pacers NBA franchise. On October 16, 2009, Dish 
Network removed Fox Sports Indiana and sister networks Fox Sports Midwest 
and Fox Sports Kansas City in a carriage dispute over a proposed increase 
in retransmission consent revenue paid by the satellite provider.[1] The 
dispute lasted for one year, with all three channels being restored on 
October 29, 2010 through the signing of a new carriage agreement. Fox Sports 
Indiana holds the regional cable television rights to the Indiana Pacers, 
and the Indiana Fever of the WNBA. The channel also broadcasts select Major 
League Baseball games from its sister regional networks, airing Cincinnati 
Reds games televised by Fox Sports Ohio[2] and St. Louis Cardinals game 
telecasts originating from Fox Sports Midwest.[3] Fox Sports Indiana sources 
its collegiate sports programming from Fox Sports Midwest, and carries 
the channel's telecasts of events and conference magazine programs from 
the Big 12 Conference, Conference USA, Southeastern Conference, Western 
Athletic Conference, Missouri Valley Conference and Horizon League. Fox 
Sports Indiana is a high definition simulcast feed of Fox Sports Indiana, 
which broadcasts in the 720p format. The channel broadcasts most of its 
Pacers game telecasts as well as Cincinnati Reds games from Fox Sports 
Ohio, and games and events broadcast nationally by Fox Sports Networks
