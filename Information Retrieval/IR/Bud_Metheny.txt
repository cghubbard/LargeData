Arthur Beauregard “Bud” Metheny, (June 1, 1915 – January 2, 2003) was an 
American baseball player and coach. He played professional baseball for 
the New York Yankees (1943–46) and served Old Dominion University for 32 
years as head baseball coach, head basketball coach and athletic director. 
Metheny was a graduate of the College of William and Mary where he played 
college baseball. He was also a brother of Phi Kappa Tau. During his four-year 
career with Yankees, he played for the Yankees in the second and last games 
of the 1943 World Series as the Yankees defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 
and he played with such great players as DiMaggio, Rizzuto and Dickey. 
In the minors before joining the Yankees, Metheny won pennants with Norfolk 
and the Kansas City Blues, as well as the Little World Series with the 
Newark Bears. Metheny joined the Old Dominion athletic staff in 1948 as 
head baseball coach, compiling a 423–363–6 record before retiring in 1980. 
He was honored by the NCAA as the Eastern Regional Coach of the Year in 
1963 and 1964, a period when his Monarchs captured college division crowns. 
He was named National Coach of the Year in 1964, and in 1980, his final 
season as the Monarchs head coach, ODU captured the Virginia State Championship. 
Metheny served as head basketball coach from 1948–65, compiling a 198-163 
record and posting 16 winning seasons. His 198 wins were ultimately surpassed 
by Blaine Taylor on January 5, 2011.[1] He also served as athletic director 
from 1963–1970. In 1984, to honor Metheny and his days with the Yankees, 
ODU adopted the Yankee uniform look of the distinctive blue pinstripes.
