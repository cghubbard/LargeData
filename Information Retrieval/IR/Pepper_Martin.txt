Johnny Leonard Roosevelt "Pepper" Martin (February 29, 1904 â€“ March 5, 
1965) was an American professional baseball player and minor league manager.[1] 
He was known as the Wild Horse of the Osage because of his daring, aggressive 
baserunning abilities. Martin played in Major League Baseball as a third 
baseman and an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1930s 
and early 1940s. He was best known for his heroics during the 1931 World 
Series, in which he was the catalyst in a Cardinals' upset victory over 
the Philadelphia Athletics.[2][3] Martin was an integral member of the 
Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that became known as the Gashouse Gang for 
their roguish behavior and practical jokes.[4] Early in his career, he 
was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because 
of his spirited, hustling style of play.[4][5][6] However, because his 
headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, 
he never lived up to those initial expectations.[7] After the end of his 
playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor 
league baseball manager.[8] Born in Temple, Oklahoma, Martin moved to Oklahoma 
City with his parents at the age of six where he grew up playing baseball.[9] 
He began his professional baseball career at the age of 19 when he signed 
to play as a shortstop in the Oklahoma State League for a team in Guthrie, 
Oklahoma.[9] When the league folded in 1924, his contract was sold to the 
Greenville Hunters of the East Texas League.[10] In 1925, he posted a .340 
batting average in 98 games for the Hunters.[11] He continued to post batting 
averages above the .300 mark and in 1927, he was signed by the St. Louis 
Cardinals to play for their affiliate, the Houston Buffaloes.[11] He hit 
for a .306 average in 147 games with Houston, he earned a promotion to 
the major leagues.[11] After spending five years in the minor leagues, 
Martin made his major league debut with the Cardinals on April 16, 1928 
at the age of 24.[1] He posted a .308 batting average in 39 games as a 
utility player, helping the Cardinals win the National League pennant.[1] 
Martin made one appearance as a pinch runner in the 1928 World Series, 
when the Cardinals lost in four straight games to the New York Yankees.[12] 
Despite his respectable batting average, Martin was sent back to the Houston 
Buffaloes in January 1929 where he hit for a .298 batting average.[11][13] 
The following season, he was promoted to the Rochester Red Wings where 
his offensive statistics improved with 20 home runs, a .363 batting average 
and a .631 slugging percentage, helping the Red Wings win the 1930 International 
League title.[11] The Red Wings then defeated the Louisville Colonels of 
the American Association to win the Junior World Series.[14] Martin's performance 
earned him a return to the major leagues with the Cardinals in 1931.[1] 
When veteran center fielder Taylor Douthit went into a hitting slump, Martin 
replaced him and played well enough that Cardinals' president, Branch Rickey, 
traded Douthit to the Cincinnati Reds in June.[15] Martin impressed observers 
with his hustle in the outfield as well as on the base paths where he often 
slid into bases head-first.[16] He ended the year with a .300 batting average 
along with seven home runs and 75 runs batted in to help the Cardinals 
clinch the 1931 National League pennant by 13 games over the New York Giants.[1][17] 
The 1931 World Series was a rematch of the previous year's participants, 
pitting the Cardinals against the Philadelphia Athletics. Led by Connie 
Mack, the Athletics had won the previous two World Series and were heavily 
favored to win for a third consecutive year.[2] They featured a lineup 
that included five future National Baseball Hall of Fame members in Mickey 
Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove, Waite Hoyt and Al Simmons. In Game 
1 held at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, Martin had three hits, including 
a double, a stolen base and drove in one run in a 6-2 loss to the ace of 
the Athletics staff, 31-game winning pitcher Lefty Grove.[18] Martin proved 
to be the difference in Game 2 in what was otherwise a tight pitching duel 
between Bill Hallahan of the Cardinals and George Earnshaw for the Athletics. 
He scored the first run of the game in the second inning by stretching 
a single into a double when the ball was mishandled in the outfield, stealing 
third base, and then scoring on a sacrifice fly.[2] Martin added another 
run in the seventh inning when he hit a single, stole second base, took 
third base on a fielder's choice, and then scored on a squeeze bunt.[19] 
Those would be the only runs of the game as Hallahan pitched a three-hit 
shutout to even the series at one win apiece.[12] The series then moved 
to Shibe Park in Philadelphia for Game 3, where Martin had two hits, including 
a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove.[20] In 
Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to 
Earnshaw, 3-0.[21] Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for 
the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with two singles, a home 
run and a sacrifice fly, as the Cardinals triumphed 5-1.[22][23] Although 
he was held hitless in the final two games of the series, he made an impressive 
catch to extinguish an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 
7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for the Cardinals.[2] 
He set a then record 12 hits in the series, including four doubles, a home 
run, five stolen bases and five runs batted in.[2][12] Martin's .500 series 
batting average may have made the difference in the series outcome, as 
without him the Cardinals batted just .205 as a team.[2] During the series, 
Martin was asked how he had learned to run so fast; he replied, "I grew 
up in Oklahoma, and once you start runnin' out there there ain't nothin' 
to stop you".[24] Longtime major league manager, John McGraw, described 
Martin's performance as "the greatest individual performance in the history 
of the World Series."[25] In December, he was selected as male athlete 
of the year by the Associated Press.[26] Martin experienced an injury-plagued 
season in 1932, missing several weeks when he dislocated his shoulder in 
April and missed a month and a half when he broke a finger in July while 
sliding into home plate.[27][28] In August, Cardinals manager Gabby Street 
converted Martin into a third baseman in an attempt to fill the gap left 
by the injured Sparky Adams.[29] Martin was not a naturally gifted third 
baseman, often fielding balls after having stopped them with his chest.[10][30] 
He ended the season with a .238 batting average with four home runs and 
34 runs batted in as the Cardinals fell to seventh place in the National 
League.[1] Having rebounded from his injuries, in 1933 Martin was leading 
the league in hitting with a .363 batting average in the middle of June, 
earning him a starting role as the third baseman for the National League 
team in the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 
6, 1933.[31][32] Now hitting as the Cardinals' leadoff hitter, he finished 
the season ranked sixth in the league with a career-high .316 average and 
led the league with 122 runs scored and 26 stolen bases.[33] Martin ranked 
tenth in the league with a .456 slugging percentage, and he had a career-high 
.387 on-base percentage along with 36 doubles, 12 triples and eight home 
runs as the Cardinals improved to a fifth-place finish.[33] He came in 
fifth place in the voting results for the 1933 National League Most Valuable 
Player Award.[34] Martin's batting average dropped to .289 in 1934, but 
he once again led the league in stolen bases as the Cardinals rallied from 
seven games behind the New York Giants in early September to win the National 
League pennant on the last day of the season.[1][4] He made an appearance 
as a relief pitcher on August 19, allowing one hit in two innings pitched.[35] 
In a memorable 1934 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, the Cardinals 
were down 3 games to 2, before rebounding to win the final two games.[10] 
The series was highlighted by several rough plays on the base paths that 
culminated in Game 7, when Joe Medwick made a rough slide into Tigers' 
third baseman Marv Owen.[36] The following inning, outraged Detroit fans 
pelted Medwick with debris when he assumed his defensive position in the 
outfield.[36] The disturbance wasn't quelled until the umpires appealed 
to Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who had Medwick removed 
from the game.[36] Martin ended the series with 11 hits for a .355 average, 
stole two bases and scored eight runs in the series.[12] He experienced 
difficulties in the field, committing 3 errors in Game 4 and setting a 
World Series record with four errors overall.[37][38] While in a St. Louis 
hospital in December 1934, for a minor operation on his left arm, Martin 
insisted that he be entertained by a cowboy musical group that he had hired. 
He created such a disturbance among the other patients that the hospital 
staff moved him to an isolated wing.[39] Martin, along with Cardinals teammates 
such as Leo Durocher, Dizzy Dean and Joe Medwick among others, became known 
as the 1934 Gashouse Gang due to their boisterous activities on and off 
the field.[4][40] He played the guitar in a hillbilly band composed of 
Cardinals players named The Mudcat Band.[41] Although Martin had a good 
year offensively in 1935, he continued to struggle defensively at third 
base. In the midst of a tight pennant race in July, he committed three 
costly errors in a loss to the New York Giants, and ended the year with 
30 errors.[42] He was hitting for a .333 average by mid-season to earn 
the starting third baseman's position in the 1935 All-Star Game.[43] For 
the season, he hit for a .299 average with nine home runs and 54 runs batted 
in.[1] In October, Martin underwent surgery again, this time on his right 
arm.[44] In January 1936, Branch Rickey asked Martin to curtail his extra-curricular 
activities. Already well known as a hunting and fishing enthusiast, Martin 
had taken up the hobby of midget car racing and was also playing in football 
and basketball games during the winter months.[45] He also became the vice-president 
and general manager of an Oklahoma City ice hockey team.[45] Martin moved 
back to the outfield, playing as the Cardinals' right fielder in 1936 as 
the Cardinals battled the New York Giants for the National League title 
before settling for second place. He responded with a good year offensively, 
hitting for a .309 average with career-highs in home runs (11) and in runs 
batted in (76).[1] Martin also led the National League in stolen bases 
with 23.[46] He continued to hit well, by 1937 although, he was relegated 
to a part-time role, as his spirited, headlong style of play took its toll 
on his body.[2][7] At the beginning of the 1939 season, he was named as 
the Cardinals' team captain, taking the job from Leo Durocher who had been 
traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers.[47] He experienced a resurgence, leading 
the team with a .340 batting average in June before a sprained wrist put 
him out of action for two weeks.[48] He ended the season with a .306 batting 
average in 88 games, helping the Cardinals to finish second in the National 
League.[1] Martin hit for a respectable .316 average in 1940 before the 
Cardinals named him as the player-manager of the Sacramento Solons of the 
Pacific Coast League in October.[1][25] Martin led Sacramento to a second-place 
finish in 1941 before leading them to their first Pacific Coast League 
championship in 38 years in 1942.[49] He then became a player-manager for 
the Rochester Red Wings in 1943.[49] When professional baseball experienced 
a shortage of players during World War II, Martin returned to the major 
leagues in 1944 with the Cardinals at the age of 40. In 40 games with the 
Cardinals, he posted a .279 batting average and an impressive .386 on-base 
percentage to help the Cardinals clinch the 1944 National League pennant.[1] 
Martin did not appear in the 1944 World Series, playing his final major 
league game on October 1, 1944.[1] In a 13-year major league career, Martin 
played in 1,189 games, accumulating 1,227 hits in 4,117 at bats for a .298 
career batting average along with a .443 slugging percentage, 59 home runs, 
501 runs batted in, 146 stolen bases and an on-base percentage of .358.[1] 
He retired with a .973 career fielding percentage in 613 games as an outfielder 
and a .927 fielding percentage in 429 games as a third baseman.[1] A four-time 
All-Star, Martin's World Series career batting average of .418 is still 
a series record, and he is tied for 10th with seven World Series stolen 
bases.[50] He led the National League three times in stolen bases and once 
in runs scored.[1] On May 5, 1933, Martin hit for the cycle in a game against 
the Philadelphia Phillies at the Baker Bowl.[51] After the end of his major 
league career, Martin returned to the minor leagues, serving as a player-manager 
with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1945 and 1946 
before becoming the player-manager for the Greenville Spinners of the South 
Atlantic League in 1947.[8] His fiery, competitive nature was still evident 
in July 1945 when it was reported that he had punched one of his players 
for not performing to his standards.[52] While managing the Miami Sun Sox 
of the Florida International League in 1949, he was fined and suspended 
for the remainder of the season for choking an umpire.[53] In August 1951, 
he made news again when he was arrested after a Sun Sox game when he went 
into the stands to punch a spectator in Lakeland, Florida.[54] When the 
Sun Sox released him, Martin was hired to manage the Miami Beach Flamingos 
of the Florida International League in 1952.[55] Despite leading them to 
a 103-49 record, the Flamigos finished the season one game behind his former 
team, the Sun Sox.[56] In 1953, he became the manager of the Fort Lauderdale 
Lions and led them to the Florida International League title.[57] After 
spending the 1954 season as the manager for the Portsmouth Merrimacs, Martin 
was named as a coach for the Chicago Cubs in September 1955.[58] Stan Hack 
was fired as the Cubs manager when they finished in last place in the 1956 
season, and the new Cubs manager, Bob Scheffing, asked for Martin's resignation 
along with the rest of the coaching staff.[59] Martin returned to the minor 
leagues once again where he became a player-coach for the Tulsa Oilers, 
playing his final game at the age of 54.[60] He took his final field assignment 
as the manager of the Miami Marlins in 1959.[61] Before his death, he served 
briefly as the athletic director of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at 
McAlester, Oklahoma.[62] Martin died on March 5, 1965, after suffering 
a heart attack.[63] His wife, Ruby, survived him by over four decades, 
dying just after her 99th birthday in 2009. Martin was inducted into the
