Sherwood Robert "Sherry" Magee (August 6, 1884 – March 13, 1929) was an 
American left fielder in Major League Baseball. From 1904 through 1919, 
Magee played for the Philadelphia Phillies (1904–14), Boston Braves (1915–1917) 
and Cincinnati Reds (1917–1919). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 
16-season career, Magee posted a .291 batting average with 83 home runs 
and 1,176 runs batted in in 2,087 games played. A native of Clarendon, 
Pennsylvania, Magee was one of the premier hitters of the dead-ball era. 
From 1905 through 1914, Magee finished in the National League Top 10 in 
home runs and RBIs seven times, including leading the NL in RBIs four times. 
He led the league for a fourth time in the 1918 campaign, which was shortened 
by World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic. Magee also hit over .300 five 
times, including a batting title to his credit as well, while also being 
known as one of the finest defensive outfielders of his day. He collected 
2,169 hits and 441 stolen bases, including 23 steals of home. Magee was 
obtained by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1904 and remained with them for 
eleven years. His 85 RBIs in 1905 were an NL high. His most productive 
season came in 1910, when he led the league in batting (.310), RBIs (123), 
runs (110), total bases (263), on-base percentage (.445), slugging average 
(.507) and OPS (.952), and finished second in doubles (39) and triples 
(17). On July 10, 1911, Magee struck umpire Bill Finneran, knocking him 
unconscious. Magee was suspended for the remainder of the season, but on 
appeal the suspension was shortened to just over a month.[1] In 1914 Magee 
led the league in hits (171), doubles (39), RBIs (103), extra base hits 
(65), total bases (277) and slugging (.509). A year later, he was traded 
to the Boston Braves. He remained at Boston until the 1917 midseason, when 
he was sent to the Cincinnati Reds. In 1918, he led the league in RBIs 
(76) for the fourth time. In 1910, Magee was seriously ill for two months 
and he concluded his major league career by pinch-hitting twice during 
the 1919 World Series. Magee later played in the minors and also umpired 
in the New York–Penn League (1927) and the National League (1928). A victim 
of pneumonia, Magee died in Philadelphia, at age 44. He is buried at Arlington 
Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. In 2008, he was one of ten pre-1943 
players to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the
