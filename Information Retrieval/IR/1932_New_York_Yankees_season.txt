The 1932 New York Yankees season was the team's 30th season in New York, 
and its 32nd season overall. The team finished with a record of 107â€“47, 
winning their seventh pennant, finishing 13 games ahead of the Philadelphia 
Athletics. New York was managed by future Hall of Famer Joe McCarthy. A 
record nine future Hall of Famers played on the team (Earle Combs, Bill 
Dickey, Lou Gehrig, Lefty Gomez, Tony Lazzeri, Herb Pennock, Red Ruffing, 
Babe Ruth, Joe Sewell). The Yankees played their home games at Yankee Stadium. 
In the World Series, they swept the Chicago Cubs. They are the only major-league 
team ever to go an entire season without being shut out. On May 30, 1932, 
the Yankees dedicated a monument to their former manager, Miller Huggins. 
Huggins was the first of many Yankees personnel granted this honor. The 
monument was placed in front of the flagpole in center field at Yankee 
Stadium. an area which eventually became "Monument Park", dedicated in 
1976. The monument calls Huggins "A splendid character who made priceless 
contributions to baseball." [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders

Babe Ruth's called shot was the home run hit by Babe Ruth in the fifth 
inning of Game 3 of the 1932 World Series, held on October 1, 1932, at 
Wrigley Field in Chicago. During the at bat, Ruth made a pointing gesture, 
which existing film confirms, but the exact nature of his gesture is ambiguous. 
Although neither fully confirmed nor refuted, the story goes that Ruth 
pointed to the center field bleachers during the at bat. It was supposedly 
a declaration that he would hit a home run to this part of the park. On 
the next pitch, Ruth hit a home run to center field. LEAGUE CHAMPIONS:
