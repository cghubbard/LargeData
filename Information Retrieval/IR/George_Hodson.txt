and weighed 150 pounds.[1] Hodson was born in Pennsylvania in 1868. He 
started his professional baseball career in 1888 with the International

around the minor leagues. He had a win–loss record of 11-9 while playing 
in the Eastern Interstate League in 1890.[2] In 1892, he had a big season 
for the Altoona Mountaineers of the Pennsylvania State League, going 21-12

(32), innings pitched (319), walks (98), and strikeouts (223).[3] Hodson 
stayed in the Pennsylvania State League for a few years until he was purchased 
by the National League's Boston Beaneaters in August 1894. He made 11 late-season 
starts for Boston, going 4-4 with a 5.84 ERA. Early in the following season, 
he went 1-2 with a 9.53 ERA for the Philadelphia Phillies; that was his
