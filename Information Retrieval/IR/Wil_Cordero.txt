Wilfredo Cordero Nieva (born October 3, 1971) is a former shortstop, first 
baseman, and outfielder in Major League Baseball. He was best known as 
a member of the Montreal Expos (1992–1995, 2002–2003). Cordero made his 
Major League Baseball debut in 1992 and last played in 2005. In addition 
to the Expos, Cordero played for the Boston Red Sox (1996–1997), Chicago 
White Sox (1998), Cleveland Indians (1999, 2000–2002), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(2000), Florida Marlins (2004), and Washington Nationals (2005). He batted 
and threw right-handed. In a 14-season career, Cordero was a .273 hitter 
with 122 home runs and 566 RBI in 1247 games. Cordero had an opportunity 
to make the Montreal Expos roster on Opening Day in 1992, less than four 
years after he signed with the team at the age of sixteen, but he struck 
out 17 times in 38 spring training at bats, and was sent down to Triple-A 
Indianapolis. He debuted with the Expos after the All-Star break and finished 
with a .314 batting average in 45 games, despite missing significant stretches 
of playing time due to a sprained ankle, a strained middle finger, and 
a serious case of chicken pox. A line drive hitter, he finished his first 
full season with a .248 average, 10 homers and 58 RBIs in 1993. Meanwhile, 
he displayed excellent range at shortstop and a strong throwing arm. In 
the strike-shortened 1994 season, Cordero finished with a career-high .294 
average, 15 home runs, 63 RBI, 65 runs scored and 35 doubles, and made 
the National League All-Star team. The next year he batted .286. Cordero 
was traded to the Boston Red Sox before the 1996 season. The Expos received 
pitchers Rheal Cormier and Shayne Bennett, and first baseman Ryan McGuire 
in the deal. In his first year in Boston, a pair of nagging injuries and 
the presence of John Valentin at shortstop limited his playing time. Cordero 
was used at second base and as designated hitter, appearing in 59 games. 
His most productive season came in 1997, when he hit .281 and posted career-highs 
in home runs (18), RBI (72), runs (82), hits (160) and games (140). At 
the end of the 1997 season, the Red Sox released Cordero, and he signed 
with the Chicago White Sox. From 1998 to 2004, Cordero played for five 
teams, including two stints with the Cleveland Indians and a full season 
with his former club, Montreal. In 2004, he had arthroscopic knee surgery 
and was out for the season. Cordero was back in 2005, with the renamed 
Washington Nationals franchise. On July 25, 2005, the Nationals placed 
Cordero on waivers for the purpose of giving him his unconditional release. 
The 33-year-old Cordero, who had been bothered by knee problems, batted 
.118 with two RBI in 29 games that season for the Nationals. On July 27, 
the New York Mets signed Cordero to a minor league contract and assigned 
him to their Triple-A affiliate, the Norfolk Tides. The Mets released Cordero 
on August 15 after he hit just .129 for the Tides. After not playing at 
all in 2006, the Mets signed Cordero to a minor league contract on March 
7, 2007, but released him during spring training. Cordero works as a baseball 
coach during the summers at Kutsher's Sports Academy in Great Barrington,
