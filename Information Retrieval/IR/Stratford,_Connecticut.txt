Stratford is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, located 
on Long Island Sound at the mouth of the Housatonic River. Stratford is 
in the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was 
founded by Puritans in 1639. The population was 51,384 as of the 2010 census.[1] 
It has a historical legacy in aviation, the military, and theater. Stratford 
is bordered on the west by Bridgeport, to the north by Trumbull and Shelton, 
and on the east by Milford (across the Housatonic River). Stratford was 
founded in 1639 as " the plantation at Pequonnocke",[2] by Puritan leader 
Reverend Adam Blakeman, William Beardsley, and either 16 families—according 
to legend—or approximately 35 families—suggested by later research—who 
had recently arrived in Connecticut from England seeking religious freedom. 
In 1640 the community was known as Cupheag Plantation. By April 13, 1643, 
the growing town was known as Stratford, changed to honor Stratford-upon-Avon 
in England. Stratford is one of many towns in the northeastern American 
colonies founded as part of the Great Migration in the 1630s when Puritan 
families fled an increasingly polarized England in the decade before the 
civil war between Charles I and Parliament (led by Oliver Cromwell). Some 
of the Stratford settlers were from families who had first moved from England 
to the Netherlands to seek religious freedom, like their predecessors on 
the Mayflower, and decided to come to the New World when their children 
began to adopt the Dutch culture and language. Like other Puritan or Pilgrim 
towns founded during this time, early Stratford was a place where church 
leadership and town leadership were united under the pastor of the church, 
in this case Reverend Blakeman. The goal of these communities was to create 
perfect outposts of religious idealism where the wilderness would separate 
them from the interference of kings, parliaments, or any other secular 
authority. Blakeman ruled Stratford until his death in 1665, but as the 
second generation of Stratford grew up, many of the children rejected what 
they perceived as the exceptional austerity of the town's founders. This 
and later generations sought to change the religious dictums of their elders, 
and the utopian nature of Stratford and similar communities was gradually 
replaced with more standard colonial administration. By the late 17th century, 
the Connecticut government had assumed political control over Stratford. 
Many descendants of the original founding Puritan families remain in Stratford 
today after over 350 years; for centuries they often intermarried within 
the original small group of 17th century Pilgrim families. Despite its 
Puritan origins, Stratford was the site of the first Anglican church in 
Connecticut, founded in 1707 and ministered by the Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson.[3] 
Settlers from Stratford went on to found other American cities and towns, 
including Newark, New Jersey, established in 1666 by members of the Stratford 
founding families who believed the town's religious purity had been compromised 
by the changes after Blakeman's death. Other towns such as Cambria, New 
York (now Lockport, New York) were founded or expanded around new churches 
by Stratford descendants taking part in the westward migration. U.S. President 
Gerald Ford was a descendant of one of the Stratford founding families, 
that was led by William Judson. Stratford was one of the two principal 
settlements in southwestern Connecticut, the other being Fairfield. Over 
time it gave rise to several new towns that broke off and incorporated 
separately. The following towns were created from parts of Stratford: According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 19.9 square 
miles (52 km2), of which 17.6 square miles (46 km2) is land and 2.3 square 
miles (6.0 km2), or 11.52%, is water. Stratford has a minimum elevation 
of zero feet above sea level along its coastline, with a maximum altitude 
of 295 feet (90 m) near its northern border,[4] and an average elevation 
of 23 feet (7.0 m).[citation needed] The town contains five islands, all 
in the Housatonic River. These are Carting Island, Long Island, Peacock 
Island, and Pope's Flat north of Interstate 95, as well as Goose Island. 
None of these islands are habitable because of their low elevations. A 
sixth island known as Brinsmade Island washed away prior to 1964.[5] Town 
beach stickers are free for residents and $100/season for non-residents 
with daily rates available. Long Beach – Approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) 
long, the eastern end of the beach is open to the public and has parking 
and lifeguards. The central part of the beach is a nature preserve whose 
land is set aside for wildlife, particularly nesting seabirds, such as 
kestrels and ospreys. The western end of the beach was once the site of 
about 40 cottages, which were abandoned because of the town's discontinuation 
of the lease to the land . The cottages were demolished in fall 2010. Russian 
Beach – Located between Long and Short beaches, Russian Beach has parking 
and the Point-No-Point walkway. Fishing is allowed, as is swimming although 
this beach has no lifeguards. Short Beach – Short Beach Park is 30 acres 
(120,000 m2) in size and sits at the mouth of the Housatonic River. It 
has three picnic pavilions, basketball courts, tennis courts, volleyball 
courts, a handicapped-accessible playground, a skateboard park, a lighted 
softball field, a soccer field, two baseball fields and a lacrosse field. 
The beach has 1,000 feet (300 m) of frontage with a concession stand, bathrooms, 
a deck and lifeguards. The park is also home to Short Beach Golf Course, 
a nine-hole par-3 course. The Great Meadows Unit of the Stewart B. McKinney 
National Wildlife Refuge is a key bird migration stopover. The open water 
area of the Great Salt Marsh is known as Lewis Gut. Located in the north 
end of Stratford, this 250-acre (1.0 km2) site is primarily a mixed deciduous 
forest, with some wetlands and ponds. Named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
it was set aside in the 1930s, when much of the infrastructure was created 
as a Works Progress Administration project. The forest includes campsites 
with cooking pits, picnic tables, a playground, restrooms, and walking 
trails. Stratford is the location of two Superfund sites designated by 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These include a variety 
of locations related to asbestos dumping and disposal by Raymark Industries, 
whose manufacturing was previously headquartered in Stratford, and the 
former Stratford Army Engine Plant. The Raymark site is on the EPA's National 
Priorities List. Stratford Army Engine Plant is not on the National Priorities 
list, but is being cleaned up by the US Army. From 1919 to 1989, Raymark 
manufactured brake pads and other friction products for the automobile 
industry under the name Raybestos. The company disposed of wastes containing 
lead, asbestos, PCBs and other hazardous substances at its Stratford manufacturing 
plant. Raymark dried the waste material and made it available for use as 
fill material for lawns, playgrounds, and schoolyards. In 1993, the EPA 
and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began working 
together to complete the cleanup of contamination Raymark left behind in 
Stratford. EPA completed its cleanup of the contaminated residential properties 
in 1995 and the former Raymark plant property in 1997. Plans for cleanup 
of the Ferry Creek area and surrounding properties where additional Raymark 
waste was historically disposed are currently being developed by the EPA.[6] 
The cost of cleaning up the Raymark Site is estimated to have exceeded 
$200 million.[7] As of the census[10] of 2010, there were 51,384 people, 
20,095 households, and 13,614 families residing in the town. The population 
density was 2919.5 people per square mile (1,117/km²). There were 21,091 
housing units at an average density of 1,198.4 per square mile (458.5/km²). 
The racial makeup of the town was 76.4% White, 14.3% Black or African American, 
0.2% Native American, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 4.2% from other 
races, and 2.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race 
were 13.8% of the population. There were 20,095 households out of which 
28.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.1% were married 
couples living together, 14.2% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 32.3% were non-families. 27.3% of all households were made 
up of individuals and 13.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of 
age or older. The average household size was 2.54 and the average family 
size was 3.11. In the town the population was spread out with 23.0% under 
the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 23.5% from 45 to 
64, and 19.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42.2 
years. For every 100 females there were 89.0 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 85.6 males. The median income for a household 
in the town was $53,494, and the median income for a family was $64,364. 
Males had a median income of $45,552 versus $34,575 for females. The per 
capita income for the town was $26,501. About 3.5% of families and 5.0% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.6% of those 
under age 18 and 5.8% of those age 65 or over. In 1939, one of the world's 
first successful commercial helicopters was developed in Stratford by Igor 
Sikorsky and flown at his plant.[11] His company, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 
is still the town's largest employer. Also in 1939, Lycoming produced Wright 
radial engines here. After World War II, the plant was converted to produce 
turbines. The Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft Division in Stratford built a total 
of 7,829 F4U fighters from 1940 to 1952, including the prototype. These 
planes saw extensive combat in the Pacific Theatre of operations during 
World War II, and played a supporting role in the Korean War. A Corsair 
sits on a pedestal at the airport as a memorial to the war effort.[12] 
The Stratford Eagles Composite Squadron, Civil Air Patrol, is based in 
Stratford, at the Sikorsky Memorial Airport. Stratford is home to the headquarters 
of Sikorsky Aircraft, currently a Lockheed Martin (LMT) subsidiary founded 
by Igor Sikorsky, developer of the first successful American helicopter. 
Every Marine One (the helicopter of the President of the United States) 
has been manufactured in Stratford since 1957. On July 20, 2015, Lockheed 
Martin announced an agreement to purchase Sikorsky Aircraft from UTC for 
$9 billion.[13] The Stratford Army Engine Plant (SAEP) was a U.S. Army 
Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command installation and manufacturing facility, 
located along the Housatonic River and Main Street opposite Sikorsky Airport. 
Because of the Base Realignment and Closure actions of the United States 
Department of Defense, closure of the plant was recommended in July 1995. 
The SAEP closed on September 30, 1998. For the next 11 years the Army was 
involved with "Team Stratford" to develop the property. The United States 
Army, which owns the 78-acre (320,000 m2) site, auctioned it off on March 
19, 2008,[14] with a winning bid of $9,612,000 which also includes the 
1,720,000-square-foot (160,000 m2) facility of over fifty buildings. This 
bid failed to be paid off and is now being placed for rebid. Currently 
Robert Hartmann of Hartmann Development has a $1 billion plan to develop 
the former Army engine plant into a destination resort.[15] Although owned 
by the City of Bridgeport, Sikorsky Memorial Airport is located in Stratford. 
The 800-acre (3.2 km2) facility includes two paved runways (both under 
4800 feet), a helipad, and two hangars. It provides helicopter service 
to New York and the Downtown Manhattan Heliport and is used as a landing 
site for blimps and small aircraft. In 2007, 241 aircraft were based at 
the airport, with an average of 212 operations per day.[citation needed] 
Stratford (Metro-North station) is a stop on the New Haven Line, 59 miles 
(95 km) east of Grand Central Terminal. Average travel time into Manhattan 
is about 90 minutes. The station platforms are only long enough to handle 
four cars and the station has limited parking for fewer than 300 vehicles. 
It has three ticket machines, a bus connection to neighboring Bridgeport, 
and handicapped access. Stratford is served by several major highways, 
including Interstate 95 (Connecticut Turnpike), U.S. Route 1 (Boston Post 
Road) (Boston Avenue and Barnum Avenue), the Merritt Parkway (Route 15), 
Route 108 (Nichols Avenue), Route 110 (East Main Street and River Road), 
Route 113 (Lordship Boulevard and Main Street), and Route 130 (Stratford 
Avenue and Ferry Boulevard). In January 1983 a truck slammed into a line 
of cars waiting to pay a toll on Interstate 95 in Stratford, killing seven 
people. This accident was one of the reasons toll booths were removed throughout 
the state.[16] The Town of Stratford operated under a Council-manager government 
from 1921 until 2005 when it changed to a mayor-council type of government. 
The first mayor, James Miron, was elected in November 2005 to a four-year 
term. The second and current mayor is John Harkins.[17] The town has a 
ten-member Town Council, elected by district to two-year terms. It appoints 
one of its members to serve as Chairman. The Mayor and the Town Council 
are responsible for setting policy through the enactment of ordinances 
and resolutions. Stratford Emergency Medical Service (SEMS) is the state 
licensed, advanced life support (paramedic) and basic life support, municipal 
EMS provider to the Town of Stratford. Founded in 1977, it provides emergency 
medical response and care using both paid staff and volunteers. It also 
has an operational Medical Bike Unit, Special Operations Division and an 
Honor Guard. SEMS is an independent department within the Town of Stratford 
and is not associated with the Fire Department. The Stratford Fire Department 
is the basic first responder for SEMS and the town. The department operates 
under the direction of a Director (equivalent to Fire/Police Chief) who 
also oversees the 911 dispatch center. The Director reports directly to 
the Mayor. There is an EMS Administrator (equivalent to Deputy Fire/Police 
Chief), as well as two (2) FT Paid Operations Supervisors and an Executive 
Secretary who all report up through the Director. There are also several 
volunteer supervisors. SEMS handles approximately 7000 emergency responses 
per year. Since it began billing for services in 2012, the department has 
become entirely self-sufficient, taking no subsidy from the Town/taxpayer. 
In fact, SEMS pays the Town approximately 4-600 thousand a year in "overhead" 
costs in order to maintain it's operation inline with other Town Departments. 
The EMS Fund ordinance (Ord. No. 03-04) governs the use of EMS funds. EMT-B, 
EMR & EVO classes and re-certification classes are regularly offered. For 
more information go to: http://www.stratfordems.org[18] Stratford EMS has 
won multiple awards for performance and patient care including National 
EMS Service of the Year, 2 Governors Awards, and AHA Mission Lifeline Awards 
Established in 1909, the Stratford Fire Department operates out of four 
fire stations, located throughout the town. The SFD responds to approximately 
4,000 emergency calls annually.[19] Created in 1917, the Stratford Police 
Department has a force of 98 officers. The department's units include arson 
investigation, crime prevention, identification & forensic unit and narcotics 
& vice. Stratford also has a boat patrol, a K-9 unit,[20] and an animal 
control unit.[21] In addition to this they have a Police Explorer Program 
Public education in Stratford is managed by the Stratford Board of Education, 
which operates 13 schools: two high schools, two middle schools, and nine 
elementary schools. The district has about 7,600 students and 870 staff.[22] 
Stratford has two private (Catholic) elementary and middle schools: Located 
in the former Stratford railroad station, the National Helicopter Museum 
contains a photographic history of the helicopter and model helicopters. 
The 30-acre (120,000 m2) Boothe homestead in the Putney area of Stratford 
is a rolling parkland containing the original Boothe homestead and an eclectic 
assortment of buildings collected by the Boothe brothers during their lives 
and added to by the Friends of Boothe. A tollbooth that was in service 
from 1940 to 1988 on Connecticut's Merritt Parkway is on display in Boothe 
Memorial Park. In 1955 Stratford became home to the American Shakespeare 
Theatre, an 1,100-seat theatre[citation needed] with grounds on the Housatonic 
River. The theatre featured such actors as Katharine Hepburn, James Earl 
Jones, Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Jane Alexander, Hal Holbrook, Roddy 
McDowall, Nina Foch and Will Geer. John Houseman served as its artistic 
director during the late 1950s. The company operating the theater ceased 
operations in the mid-1980s, and the building has been vacant since then. 
In February 2005, the Town of Stratford received the deed for the Stratford 
Festival Shakespeare Theater from the state of Connecticut. In 2006 it 
selected a New York City development company to reopen the theater as a 
tourist destination, but the company's contract was terminated in July 
2007 because of lack of progress. Three months later the town issued a 
request for proposals for an architectural assessment of the needs of the 
theater building. Since 2002, the Hudson Shakespeare Company has brought 
their Shakespeare in the Park tours to the amphitheater behind Stratford 
Library. Each year the troupe presents one showing at the library, usually 
falling on the last Saturday in each month. The library's lecture room, 
the Lovell Room, is used in case of inclement weather. Since 1932, Sterling 
House has served as a community center for Stratford. Housed in a donated 
1886 Romanesque mansion that was previously the home of John William Sterling, 
it hosts recreational and leisure activities for adults and children, charity 
events, and volunteer activities. The grounds include a gazebo, a rose 
garden, and a 2-acre (8,100 m2) field. Stratford is home to the Connecticut 
Brakettes women's fastpitch softball team. Formed in 1947 as the Raybestos 
Girl All-Stars, and later called the Raybestos Brakettes, they became known 
as the Stratford Brakettes in 1985 after Raybestos ceased its sponsorship. 
The team has posted 3,242 victories in 3,607 games played, as well as three 
world championships and 28 national A.S.A. championships, including a record 
eight consecutive titles from 1971 to 1978.[28][29] They also captured 
three consecutive titles in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Their most recent title 
came in 2006.[30][31] Nineteen former members have made the National Softball 
Hall of Fame, and 11 have been Olympians.[32] I The Brakettes play at Frank 
DeLuca Hall of Fame Field. Movies filmed at least partially in Stratford:[33] 
Stratford is served by Bridgeport's daily Connecticut Post and by the weekly 
Stratford Star.[35] Stratford has five sister cities:[36] The town of Stratford
