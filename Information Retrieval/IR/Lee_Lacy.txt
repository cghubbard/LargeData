Leondaus Lacy (born April 10, 1948), is a former Major League baseball 
outfielder who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, and Baltimore Orioles, primarily as a right fielder, in all or 
parts of 16 seasons spanning 1972–1987. Lacy appeared in four World Series 
with the Dodgers (1974; 1977–1978) and the Pirates (1979). On May 17, 1978, 
Lacy hit his third consecutive pinch-hit home run, setting a major league 
record, as the Dodgers beat the Pirates, 10–1. His previous blasts were 
on May 2 and 6. Lacy's record was matched in 1979 by Del Unser, who hit 
three consecutive pinch-hit homers on the 30th of June, 5 and 10 July.[1] 
In 1985, Lacy was among a number of players caught up in the Pittsburgh 
drug trials scandal. The next year, he was given a 60-day suspension but 
was allowed to continue playing if he donated five percent of his base 
salary and a contribution of 50 hours of drug-related community service.
