The Clearwater Threshers are a minor league baseball team that currently 
plays in the Florida State League. Since 2009, the team competes in the 
North Division. The team plays its home games at Bright House Field in 
Clearwater, Florida which opened in 2004. Bright House Field seats more 
than 7,000 fans. A single-game attendance record of 9,090 was set on July 
3, 2008.[1] The team is the High-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
The team has always been affiliated with the Phillies since 1985, the franchise's 
first season. From 1985 to 2003, the Clearwater Threshers were called the 
Clearwater Phillies. While as the Clearwater Phillies, the team played 
at Jack Russell Memorial Stadium from 1985 to 2003. When the team moved 
to the new Bright House Field, it changed its name from Phillies to Threshers. 
Clearwater city officials approached the Philadelphia Phillies as early 
as 1981 about locating a Phillies minor league affiliate at Jack Russell 
Stadium in Clearwater. In July 1982, in a visit to Philadelphia, Clearwater 
city officials and the president of the Florida State League again asked 
the Philadelphia Phillies about affiliating with a team to be based in 
Clearwater. The Amateur Softball Association Clearwater Bombers had long 
used Jack Russell Stadium during the summer months when the field would 
be reconfigured for softball. The placement of a minor league baseball 
team would mean the relocation of the Bombers.[2] The Florida State League 
granted the city of Clearwater a franchise on September 26, 1984.[3] The 
Clearwater Phillies began play in 1985 after the Philadelphia Phillies 
ended their affiliation with their High Class A minor league team, the 
Carolina League Peninsula Pilots, based in Hampton, Virginia, and placed 
their new team at Jack Russell Stadium. The Philadelphia Phillies owned 
the franchise and named the club the Clearwater Phillies. The Clearwater 
Phillies played their first game on April 12, 1985, at home, against the 
Tampa Tarpons.[4] The club played as the Clearwater Phillies through the 
2003 season. The Phillies planned to leave Jack Russell Memorial Stadium 
after the 2003 season to move into a new ballpark, Bright House Networks 
Field, adjacent to the Carpenter Complex, the Phillies' minor league training 
facility. With the move to the new ballpark, the Clearwater Phillies were 
renamed the "Threshers" and adopted a new team logo and colors. In 2004, 
the Clearwater Threshers were managed by former Phillies player and Hall 
of Famer, Mike Schmidt. Greg Legg managed the team in 2005 and 2006. Dave 
Huppert was the manager in 2007, and Razor Shines in 2008. Ernie Whitt 
was named the manager for the 2009 season after Shines was promoted to 
base coach for the New York Mets. In 2007, the Threshers won the second 
half in the FSL West Division. They defeated the Sarasota Reds (2–1) in 
the FSL West Division Playoffs, then defeated the Brevard County Manatees 
3 games to 1 in the FSL Championship Series (best-of-five) to win the FSL 
title. The Threshers were named MiLB.com's Class A Advanced Team of the 
Year.[5] On July 26, 2009, Pedro Martínez made a rehab start for the Threshers 
against the St. Lucie Mets at Bright House Field. Martinez pitched 1 1⁄3 
innings before rain caused the game to be canceled, wiping out the official 
record of his start.[6] Martinez subsequently moved to the Lehigh Valley 
Iron Pigs for his next start. On May 23, 2011 The Threshers gained national 
attention after playing in a 23 inning game against the Jupiter Hammerheads.[7] 
These statistics are current through the 2016 season.[8] Pitchers Catchers
