Mark Christian Bellhorn (born August 23, 1974) is a former American professional 
baseball infielder. He is a switch-hitter and throws right-handed. In his 
10-year Major League Baseball career, Bellhorn was best known for being 
the starting second baseman for the Boston Red Sox during their 2004 World 
Series championship season. Bellhorn was born in Boston, Massachusetts 
in 1974, however, he was raised in the Orlando, Florida suburb of Oviedo, 
where he attended St. Luke's School and graduated from Oviedo High School. 
Bellhorn went on to attend Auburn University from 1993 to 1996. Mark Bellhorn 
has one brother, Todd, who played in the New York Mets minor league system 
in 1998 and 1999.[1] He married his longtime girlfriend, Lindsey Bopp, 
in May 2013. Their first child was born in June 2014. Bellhorn was drafted 
out of high school in the 37th round of the 1992 Free Agent Draft by the 
San Diego Padres, but did not sign. Instead, he attended Auburn University, 
where he played in the 1994 College World Series.[2] After playing college 
ball at Auburn, Bellhorn broke in the majors with the Oakland Athletics 
in 1997, drafted in the second round. That year he managed a .228 batting 
average with six home runs and 19 runs batted in. Over the next three seasons 
with the Athletics he saw only limited playing time, batting .131 with 
one homer and five RBI. In 2002, Bellhorn was traded to the Chicago Cubs 
and hit .258 with 27 home runs and 56 RBI. On August 29, 2002, Bellhorn 
became the first player in National League history to hit a home run from 
both sides of the plate in the same inning, doing so in the Cubs' ten–run 
4th inning at Miller Park. Bellhorn also tied a team record with five RBI 
in the inning. His 2002 campaign was a record-setting season for the Cubs: 
his 27 home runs was the most-ever by a Cubs switch-hitter, and he became 
the first player in Cubs history to hit a home run from all four infield 
positions.[3] On June 20, 2003, he was traded to the Colorado Rockies, 
and finished the year hitting .221 with two home runs and 26 RBI. In 2004, 
Bellhorn was signed by the Boston Red Sox as a utility infielder; however, 
he became the regular second baseman after Pokey Reese and Nomar Garciaparra 
suffered early-season injuries. He proceeded to have the best batting average 
of his career, hitting .264 with 17 home runs and 82 RBI. Despite leading 
the league in strikeouts (177), Bellhorn was among the league leaders in 
walks (88, 3rd), pitches seen per at bat, batting average with runners 
in scoring position, and on-base percentage (.373, first among AL second 
baseman). Nearly half of his 2004 plate appearances resulted in a strikeout, 
walk or home run. For the first seven postseason games of his career as 
a member of the Boston Red Sox, Bellhorn had two hits in 25 at-bats (.080); 
however, his resurgence started when he broke up Mike Mussina's perfect 
game in the 7th inning of Game 1 of the American League Championship Series 
versus the New York Yankees. Bellhorn then hit a three-run homer off Jon 
Lieber to give the Red Sox a 4-2 victory over the Yankees in Game 6. He 
also homered in Game 7 of the ALCS, which the Red Sox went on to win, sending 
the ball high and clanging it off the right-field foul pole. Boston won 
Game 1 in the World Series, thanks to Bellhorn's eighth-inning two-run 
home run off Julián Tavárez (again, hitting a ball off the foul pole, this 
time Pesky's Pole at Fenway Park) to beat the St. Louis Cardinals 11-9. 
In doing so, Bellhorn became the first second baseman ever to homer in 
three consecutive postseason games. In Game 2, he hit a two-run double 
to help the Sox pull away to a 4-1 lead in an eventual 6-2 victory. The 
Red Sox went on to win the World Series in a four-game sweep of the Cardinals. 
In fourteen post-season games, Bellhorn hit three doubles and three home 
runs with eight runs scored and eight RBI. He hit for a .191 batting average 
(9-for-44). His on-base percentage was .397, slugging average .447, and 
OPS .844.[4] Mark Bellhorn appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated 
on November 1, 2004.[5] In 2005, Bellhorn struggled, registering a lower 
batting average and dramatically increasing his strikeouts. The Red Sox 
eventually released him. Bellhorn signed with the New York Yankees days 
later.[6] He spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Yankees, appearing 
in nine games. For his short tenure with the team, he was named to the 
Yankees All-Forgotten team in 2014.[7] In 2006 he joined the San Diego 
Padres, playing in 115 games but hitting .190 for his batting average for 
the season.[8] In 2007, Bellhorn signed a minor-league deal with the Cincinnati 
Reds with an invitation as a non-roster player to the Reds' spring training 
camp. He was then optioned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville 
Bats, and a few days later he accepted the minor-league assignment.[9] 
On August 12, 2007, the Reds designated Bellhorn for assignment to make 
room for Josh Hamilton, who was coming off the 15-day disabled list. On 
October 12, 2007, Bellhorn refused his outright assignment to the minors, 
becoming a free agent. In 2008, he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers 
and was assigned to their Double-A affiliate, the Jacksonville Suns. After 
a couple of months with the Suns, he was released by the Dodgers on July 
24, 2008.[10] In February 2009, Bellhorn signed a minor-league contract 
with his former team, the Colorado Rockies. He played that year for the 
Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[11] Bellhorn was granted free agency that November,
