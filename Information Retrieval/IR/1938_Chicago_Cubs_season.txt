The 1938 Chicago Cubs season was the 67th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 63rd in the National League and the 23rd at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished first in the National League with a record of 89â€“63. The team 
was swept four games to none by the New York Yankees in the 1938 World 
Series. The team is known for the season of pitcher Dizzy Dean. While pitching 
for the NL in the 1937 All-Star Game, Dean suffered a big toe fracture. 
Coming back too soon from the injury, Dean changed his pitching motion 
to avoid landing too hard on his sore toe enough to affect his mechanics. 
As a result, he hurt his arm, losing his great fastball.[1] By 1938, Dean's 
arm was largely gone. Cubs scout Clarence "Pants" Rowland was tasked with 
the unenviable job of obeying owner Philip K. Wrigley's direct order to 
buy a washed-up Dean's contract at any cost. Rowland signed the ragged 
righty for $185,000, one of the most expensive loss-leader contracts in 
baseball history. Dean still helped the Cubs win the 1938 pennant. On July 
20, Wrigley named 37-year-old Gabby Hartnett as the team's player-manager, 
replacing Charlie Grimm.[2] When Hartnett took over, the Cubs were in third 
place, six games behind the first place Pittsburgh Pirates who were led 
by Pie Traynor.[3] By September 27, with one week left in the season, the 
Cubs had battled back to within a game and a half game of the Pirates in 
the National League standings as the two teams met for a crucial three-game 
series.[3] Dean pitched the opening game of the series and with his ailing 
arm, relied more on his experience and grit to defeat the Pirates by a 
score of 2 to 1. Dean would later call it the greatest outing of his career.[1] 
The Cubs cut the Pirates' lead to a half game and set the stage for one 
of baseball's most memorable moments.[4] On September 28, the two teams 
met for the second game of the series, where Hartnett experienced the highlight 
of his career. With darkness descending on the lightless Wrigley Field 
and the score tied at 5 runs apiece, the umpires ruled that the ninth inning 
would be the last to be played. The entire game would have to be replayed 
the following day if the score remained tied. Hartnett came to bat with 
two out in the bottom of the ninth inning. With a count of 0 balls and 
2 strikes, Hartnett connected on a Mace Brown pitch, launching the ball 
into the darkness, before it eventually landed in the left-center field 
bleachers. The stadium erupted into pandemonium as players and fans stormed 
the field to escort Hartnett around the bases.[5] Hartnett's walk-off home 
run became immortalized as the Homer in the Gloamin'.[4] The Cubs were 
now in first place, culminating an impressive 19-3-1 record in September, 
and the pennant would be clinched three days later.[3] It would be 50 years 
before lights were installed at Wrigley Field.[6] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
