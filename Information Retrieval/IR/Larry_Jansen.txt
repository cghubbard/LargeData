Lawrence Joseph Jansen (July 16, 1920 – October 10, 2009) was an American 
right-handed pitcher and coach in Major League Baseball. A native of Oregon, 
he played minor league baseball in the early 1940s before starting his 
Major League career in 1947 with the New York Giants. Jansen played nine 
seasons in the big leagues, and was twice an All-Star, winning 122 games 
in all. He later coached in the Major Leagues and minor leagues. Jansen 
is a member of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame and the Pacific Coast League 
Hall of Fame. Lawrence Jansen was born in Verboort, Oregon, on July 16, 
1920.[1] He was raised in the community of Verboort located near Forest 
Grove in Washington County where he graduated from Verboort High School 
in 1938.[1] While still in school Jansen started his baseball career playing 
semi-pro ball. In 1940 Jansen was discovered by a scout and started playing 
for the Salt Lake City Bees, a Class C club at that time.[1] Jansen married 
the former Eileen Vandehey that year, and they had 10 children.[1] In 1941, 
he started playing for the San Francisco Seals in the Pacific Coast League, 
but in 1943, given the choice between being drafted to fight in World War 
II or taking a deferment to work on the family dairy farm back in Oregon, 
he chose the latter. He played semi-pro ball there part-time and returned 
to the Seals late in the 1945 season. Breaking in as a 27-year old rookie, 
Jansen became a key member of the New York Giants' starting rotation from 
1947 to 1953, twice winning more than 20 games. He was purchased from the 
AAA San Francisco Seals after leading the Pacific Coast League in wins 
(30), earned run average (1.57) and winning percentage (.833) in 1946. 
In his rookie major league season in 1947, Jansen won 21 of 26 decisions, 
leading the National League in winning percentage (.808), and finished 
second in the voting for Rookie of the Year behind the Brooklyn Dodgers' 
Jackie Robinson.[1] He pitched five innings of one-hit scoreless baseball 
in the 1950 All-Star Game, which lasted 14 innings. In 1951, he paced the 
NL-champion Giants with 23 victories and helped lead their improbable August 
and September comeback against the Dodgers. Jansen was the winning pitcher 
in the famous game on October 3, 1951, featuring the Shot Heard 'Round 
the World. Jansen, however, lost his only two decisions in the 1951 World 
Series. Jansen also won 19 games (1950) and 18 games (1948) for the New 
York club. As an indication of the low salaries of even accomplished players 
in the mid-twentieth century, Jansen worked in a hardware store in Forest 
Grove, Oregon, during the off-seasons of his best years. Arm miseries kept 
Jansen from a major role in the Giants' 1954 world championship; he spent 
part of that season inactive, as a coach. His playing career ended after 
eight appearances with the 1956 Cincinnati Reds. During his nine-year NL 
career, Jansen won 122 games and lost 89 (.578) with an ERA of 3.58. he 
had five 15-win seasons and two 20-win seasons.[2] Jansen returned to the 
Pacific Coast League as a player-coach with the Seattle (1955 and 1957) 
and the Portland (1958–60). After a call from former teammate Alvin Dark, 
Jansen returned to the Major Leagues as pitching coach for the San Francisco 
Giants in 1961, with Dark as manager.[1][3] Jansen remained as pitching 
coach for eleven seasons, and helped to develop future Hall-of-Famers Juan 
Marichal and Gaylord Perry.[4] During his tenure, the Giants made appearances 
in the 1962 World Series and 1971 National League Championship Series. 
He then moved on to his final MLB coaching job, handling pitchers for the 
Chicago Cubs in 1972–73, working for his old Giants manager, Leo Durocher, 
and then his former teammate, Whitey Lockman. In retirement, Larry Jansen 
(along with his co-author, George Jansen MD and illustrator Karl van Loo) 
left behind in book form his accumulated wisdom on every aspect of pitching 
in professional baseball: The Craft of Pitching (Masters Press, 1977). 
Previously, Jansen had contributed a section on pitching in The Sporting 
News 1951 publication How to Play Baseball. Besides Jansen, the publication 
had other authors on specific topics: "Catching by Ray Schalk; Batting 
by Rogers Hornsby; Base Running by Bernie DeViveiros; First Base by George 
Sisler; Second Base by Rogers Hornsby; Shortstop by Honus Wagner; Third 
Base by George Kell; Outfield by Joe DiMaggio; and How to Umpire by George 
Barr." [5] Jansen was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1980.[6] 
Sports Illustrated selected Jansen as one of Oregon's Fifty Greatest Athletes 
in 2004.[3] In 2010, Jansen was inducted into the Pacific Coast League 
Hall of Fame.[7] After retiring from baseball, he returned to his hometown 
Verboort, Oregon, where he sold real estate and lived the remainder of 
his life in the house he had built in 1951.[1][3] Lawrence Jansen died 
in his sleep in Verboort at the age of 89 on October 10, 2009. The cause 
of death was congestive heart failure and pneumonia. Jansen was survived
