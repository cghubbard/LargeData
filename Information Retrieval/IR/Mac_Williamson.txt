Johnathan Mackensey "Mac" Williamson (born July 15, 1990) is an American 
professional baseball outfielder for the San Francisco Giants of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He played college baseball at Wake Forest University. 
Williamson attended Wake Forest-Rolesville High School in Wake Forest, 
North Carolina. He played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher, 
and was rated the best pitching prospect in the state of North Carolina.[1] 
He chose to enroll at Wake Forest University to play college baseball for 
the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. He redshirted as a freshman, and played 
for Wake Forest as an outfielder.[2] The Boston Red Sox chose Williamson 
in the 46th round of the 2011 MLB Draft, but he decided to return to Wake 
Forest for his senior year.[1] In the 2012 MLB Draft, the San Francisco 
Giants selected Williamson in the third round, with the 115th overall selection.[3] 
He signed with the Giants, beginning his professional career in the Rookie-level 
Arizona League, hitting two home runs in 19 plate appearances. The Giants 
then promoted Williamson to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Class A-Short 
Season Northwest League, where he hit seven home runs in 125 plate appearances.[1] 
In 2013, the Giants assigned Williamson to the San Jose Giants of the Class 
A-Advanced California League.[4] He hit 25 home runs for San Jose. He was 
invited to his first spring training in 2014.[5] Though the Giants wanted 
to assign Williamson to the Richmond Flying Squirrels of the Class AA Eastern 
League to start the 2014 season, an elbow injury led them to keep him in 
San Jose, where he could still play as a designated hitter. After beginning 
the season with a .318 batting average and three home runs, Williamson 
went on the disabled list with a torn ulnar collateral ligament of the 
elbow and had Tommy John surgery, ending his 2014 season.[6] He began the 
2015 season with Richmond[7] and the Giants promoted him to the Sacramento 
River Cats of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in June.[8] The Giants 
promoted Williamson to the major leagues on September 16, 2015.[9] He made 
his debut with the Giants on September 23. He made his first major league 
start in right field on September 25, 2015, and got his first major league 
hit off Sonny Gray of the Oakland Athletics.[10] Williamson began the 2016 
season with Sacramento,[11] and received a promotion to the major leagues 
on April 15,[12] but was sent back to the minors a week later. On June 
2, Williamson was called up after Hunter Pence suffered an injury.[13] 
On June 8, 2016, Williamson hit his first major league home run off David 
Price of the Boston Red Sox, a tie-breaking shot in the bottom of the eighth
