Philip Francis Pepe [peppy] (March 21, 1935 – December 13, 2015) was an 
American baseball writer and radio voice who spent more than five decades 
covering sports in New York City.[1] Born in Brooklyn, Phil Pepe grew up 
rooting for the local Brooklyn Dodgers, even though he spent most of his 
time as a baseball reporter with the loathed team of his childhood, the 
New York Yankees.[1] Prominently, Pepe was a longtime Yankees beat writer 
who chronicled franchise greats from Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle to Reggie 
Jackson and Derek Jeter, [2] and also authored dozens of books on some 
of the most significant figures in sports, covering such athletes as boxing 
legend Muhammad Ali and basketball star Walt Frazier, during a prolific 
career that spanned generations.[3] Pepe graduated from Lafayette High 
School and St. John's University. After graduating from St. John’s, Pepe 
joined the New York World-Telegram in 1957, and remained there until the 
newspaper folded in 1966. After that, he wrote scripts along with Howard 
Cosell for ABC Radio.[3] He then was part of the New York Daily News in 
1961, the same year that Roger Maris broke Babe Ruth’s single-season home 
run record.[1] Pepe reviewed baseball for the News from 1969 through 1981 
and then succeeded the venerable Dick Young as its sports columnist in 
1982.[1] During the same period, Pepe wrote the lead game story for every 
World Series from 1969 to 1981, even in years when the Yankees did not 
make the Series. In between, he covered most of Muhammad Ali's championship 
fights, Super Bowl I and three Olympic Games, as well as the New York Knicks 
during their championship years.[3][4] After leaving the News in 1989, 
Pepe did morning sports for WCBS radio for more than 15 years, which included 
his popular "Pep Talk" segment. In addition, he was the director of broadcasting 
and a radio analyst for the Class-A New Jersey Cardinals of the New York–Penn 
League from 1994 to 2005.[4] Among his books about the Yankees, Pepe wrote 
The Yankees; 1961, an account of the Mantle-Maris home run chase to Ruth's 
record. He also released The Wit and Wisdom of Yogi Berra; Slick, an autobiography 
of Whitey Ford; Core Four, about Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte 
and Mariano Rivera in a more recent period of team's success, as well as 
Yankee Doodles, a handful of recollections from his experiences with the 
team.[2] Pepe also was esteemed for the tireless work he did on behalf 
of the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, 
where he served as chapter chairman from 1975 to 1976 and executive director 
from 1991 until 2015. Most notably, he attended every BBWAA awards dinner 
in New York from 1962 unto his death and ran the annual event for more 
than two decades.[4] Pepe died in 2015 at his home in Englewood, New Jersey
