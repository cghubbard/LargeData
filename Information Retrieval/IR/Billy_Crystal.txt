William Edward "Billy" Crystal (born March 14, 1948)[1][2] is an American 
actor, writer, producer, director, comedian and television host. He gained 
prominence in the 1970s for playing Jodie Dallas on the ABC sitcom Soap 
and became a Hollywood film star during the late 1980s and 1990s, appearing 
in the critical and box office successes When Harry Met Sally... (1989), 
City Slickers (1991), and Analyze This (1999) and providing the voice of 
Mike Wazowski in the Monsters, Inc. franchise. He has hosted the Academy 
Awards 9 times, beginning in 1990 and most recently in 2012. Crystal was 
born at Doctors Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,[1] and initially 
raised in The Bronx.[3] As a toddler, he moved with his family to 549 East 
Park Avenue in Long Beach, New York, on Long Island.[3] He and his older 
brothers Joel and Richard, nicknamed Rip, were the sons of Helen (née Gabler), 
a housewife, and Jack Crystal, who owned and operated the Commodore Music 
Store, founded by Helen's father, Julius Gabler.[4][5] Jack Crystal was 
also a jazz promoter, a producer, and an executive for an affiliated jazz 
record label, Commodore Records, founded by Helen's brother, musician and 
songwriter Milt Gabler.[3] Crystal is Jewish (his family emigrated from 
Austria and Russia).[6][7] The three young brothers would entertain by 
reprising comedy routines from the likes of Bob Newhart, Rich Little and 
Sid Caesar records their father would bring.[3] Jazz artists such as Arvell 
Shaw, Pee Wee Russell, Eddie Condon, and Billie Holiday were often guests 
in the home.[3] With the decline of Dixieland jazz circa 1963, Crystal's 
father lost his business,[6] and died later that year at the age of 54[4] 
after suffering a heart attack while bowling.[3] His mother, Helen Crystal, 
died in 2001.[6] After graduation from Long Beach High School in 1965,[8] 
Crystal attended Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia on a 
baseball scholarship,[3] having learned the game from his father, who pitched 
for St. John's University.[citation needed] Crystal never played baseball 
at Marshall because the program was suspended during his first year.[9] 
He did not return to Marshall as a sophomore, instead deciding to stay 
in New York to be close to his future wife. He attended Nassau Community 
College with Janice, and later transferred to New York University, where 
he was a film and television directing major. He graduated from NYU in 
1970 with a BFA from its School of Fine Arts, not yet named for the Tisch 
family.[10][11] One of his instructors was Martin Scorsese while Oliver 
Stone and Christopher Guest were among his classmates.[12] Crystal returned 
to New York City. For four years he was part of a comedy trio with two 
friends. They played colleges and coffee houses and Crystal worked as a 
substitute teacher on Long Island.[13] He later became a solo act and performed 
regularly at The Improv and Catch a Rising Star. In 1976, Crystal appeared 
on an episode of All in the Family. He was on the dais for The Dean Martin 
Celebrity Roast of Muhammad Ali on February 19, 1976, where he did impressions 
of both Ali and sportscaster Howard Cosell. He was scheduled to appear 
on the first episode of NBC Saturday Night (later renamed Saturday Night 
Live) (October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut.[14] He did perform on 
episode 17 of that first season, doing a monologue of an old jazz man capped 
by the line "Can you dig it? I knew that you could." Host Ron Nessen introduced 
him as "Bill Crystal."[15] Crystal was a guest on the first and the last 
episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which concluded February 6, 
2014 after 22 seasons on the air.[16] Crystal also made game show appearances 
such as The Hollywood Squares, All Star Secrets and The $20,000 Pyramid.To 
this day, he holds the Pyramid franchise's record for getting his contestant 
partner to the top of the pyramid in winner's circle in the fastest time, 
26 seconds.[17][18] Crystal's earliest prominent role was as Jodie Dallas 
on Soap, one of the first unambiguously homosexual characters in the cast 
of an American television series. He continued in the role during the series' 
entire 1977–1981 run. In 1982, Billy Crystal hosted his own variety show, 
The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour on NBC. When Crystal arrived to shoot the 
fifth episode, he learned it had been canceled after only the first two 
aired.[19] After hosting Saturday Night Live twice, on March 17, 1984 and 
the show's ninth season finale on May 5, he joined the regular cast for 
the 1984-85 season.[14] His most famous recurring sketch was his parody 
of Fernando Lamas, a smarmy talk-show host whose catchphrase, "You look... 
mahvelous!," became a media sensation.[14] Crystal subsequently released 
an album of his stand-up material titled Mahvelous! in 1985, as well as 
the single "You Look Marvelous", which peaked at No. 58 on the Billboard 
Hot 100 in the US, and No. 17 in Canada. Also in the 1980s, Crystal starred 
in an episode of Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre as the smartest of 
the three little pigs. In 1996, Crystal was the guest star of the third 
episode of Muppets Tonight and hosted three Grammy Awards Telecasts: the 
29th Grammys; the 30th Grammys; and the 31st Grammys.[20] In 2015, Crystal 
co-starred alongside Josh Gad on the FX comedy series The Comedians, which 
ran for just one season before being canceled.[21] Crystal's first film 
role was in Joan Rivers' 1978 film Rabbit Test. Crystal appeared briefly 
in the Rob Reiner "rockumentary" This Is Spinal Tap (1984) as Morty The 
Mime, a waiter dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared 
the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking Dana Carvey, stating famously 
that "Mime is money." He later starred in the action comedy Running Scared 
(1986) and was directed by Reiner again in The Princess Bride (1987), in 
a comedic supporting role as "Miracle Max." Reiner got Crystal to accept 
the part by saying, "How would you like to play Mel Brooks?" Reiner also 
allowed Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, "Have fun storming the 
castle!" is a frequently-quoted line. Reiner directed Crystal for a third 
time in the romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989), in which Crystal 
starred alongside Meg Ryan and for which he was nominated for a Golden 
Globe. The film has since become an iconic classic for the genre and is 
Crystal's most celebrated film. Crystal then starred in the award-winning 
buddy comedy City Slickers (1991), which proved very successful both commercially 
and critically and for which Crystal was nominated for his second Golden 
Globe. The film was followed by a sequel, which was less successful. In 
1992, he narrated Dr. Seuss Video Classics: Horton Hatches the Egg. Following 
the significant success of these films, Crystal wrote, directed, and starred 
in Mr. Saturday Night (1992) and Forget Paris (1995). In the former, Crystal 
played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects 
back on his career, although the character was from his SNL days. Though 
some of his subsequent films were not as well received as his earlier hits, 
Crystal had another success alongside Robert De Niro in Harold Ramis' mobster 
comedy Analyze This (1999). More recent performances include roles in America's 
Sweethearts (2001), the sequel Analyze That (2002), and Parental Guidance 
(2012). He directed the made-for-television movie 61* (2001) based on Roger 
Maris's and Mickey Mantle's race to break Babe Ruth's single-season home 
run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an Emmy nomination for Outstanding 
Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special. Crystal was originally 
asked to voice Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story (1995) but turned it down, a 
decision he later regretted due to the popularity of the series.[14] Crystal 
later went on to provide the voice of Mike Wazowski in the blockbuster 
Pixar film Monsters, Inc. (2001), and reprised his voice role in the prequel, 
Monsters University, which was released in June 2013. Crystal also provided 
the voice of Calcifer in the English version of Hayao Miyazaki's Howl's 
Moving Castle (2004). Crystal hosted the Academy Awards broadcast in 1990–1993, 
1997, 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2012. His hosting was critically praised, resulting 
in two Emmy wins for hosting and writing the 63rd Academy Awards and an 
Emmy win for writing the 64th Academy Awards. He returned recently as the 
host for the 2012 Oscar ceremony, after Eddie Murphy resigned from hosting.[22][23] 
His nine times as the M.C. is second only to Bob Hope's 18 in most ceremonies 
hosted. At the 83rd Academy Awards ceremony in 2011, he appeared as a presenter 
for a digitally inserted Bob Hope and before doing so was given a standing 
ovation. Film critic Roger Ebert said when Crystal came onstage about two 
hours into the show, he got the first laughs of the broadcast.[24] Crystal's 
hosting gigs have regularly included an introductory video segment in which 
he comedically inserts himself into scenes of that year's nominees in addition 
to a song following his opening monologue. Crystal won the 2005 Tony Award 
for Best Special Theatrical Event for 700 Sundays, a two-act, one-man play, 
which he conceived and wrote about his parents and his childhood growing 
up on Long Island.[14] He toured throughout the US with the show in 2006 
and then Australia in 2007. Following the initial success of the play, 
Crystal wrote the book 700 Sundays for Warner Books, which was published 
on October 31, 2005. In conjunction with the book and the play that also 
paid tribute to his uncle, Milt Gabler, Crystal produced two CD compilations: 
Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story, which featured his uncle's 
most influential recordings from Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit" to "Rock 
Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & His Comets; and Billy Remembers Billie 
featuring Crystal's favorite Holiday recordings. In the fall of 2013, he 
brought the show back to Broadway for a two-month run at the Imperial Theatre. 
HBO filmed the January 3–4, 2014 performances for a special, which debuted 
on their network on April 19, 2014.[25][26] In 1986, Crystal started hosting 
Comic Relief on HBO with Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg.[14] Founded 
by Bob Zmuda, Comic Relief raises money for homeless people in the United 
States. On September 6, 2005, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Crystal 
and Jay Leno were the first celebrities to sign a Harley-Davidson motorcycle 
to be auctioned off for Gulf Coast relief.[27] Crystal has participated 
in the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. Portraying 
himself in a video, Crystal introduces museum guests to the genealogy wing 
of the museum.[citation needed] On March 12, 2008, Crystal signed a one-day 
minor league contract to play with the New York Yankees, and was invited 
to the team's major league spring training. He wore uniform number 60 in 
honor of his upcoming 60th birthday.[28] On March 13, in a spring training 
game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Crystal led off as the designated 
hitter. He managed to make contact, fouling a fastball up the first base 
line, but was eventually struck out by Pirates pitcher Paul Maholm on six 
pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by Johnny Damon.[29] 
He was released on March 14, his 60th birthday.[30] Crystal's boyhood idol 
was Yankee Hall of Fame legend Mickey Mantle who had signed a program for 
him when Crystal attended a game where Mantle had hit a home run. Years 
later on The Dinah Shore Show, in one of his first television appearances, 
Crystal met Mantle in person and had Mantle re-sign the same program. Crystal 
would be good friends with Mickey Mantle until Mantle's death in 1995. 
He and Bob Costas together wrote the eulogy Costas read at Mantle's funeral, 
and George Steinbrenner then invited Crystal to emcee the unveiling of 
Mantle's monument at Yankee Stadium. In his 2013 memoir Still Foolin' 'Em, 
Crystal writes that after the ceremony, near the Yankee clubhouse, he was 
punched in the stomach by Joe DiMaggio, who was angry at Crystal for not 
having introduced him to the crowd as the "Greatest living player." Crystal 
also was well known for his impressions of Yankee Hall of Famer turned 
broadcaster Phil Rizzuto. Rizzuto, known for his quirks calling games, 
did not travel to Anaheim, California in 1996 to call the game for WPIX. 
Instead, Crystal joined the broadcasters in the booth and pretended to 
be Rizzuto for a few minutes during the August 31 game. Although a lifelong 
Yankee fan,[31] he is a part-owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, even earning 
a World Series ring in 2001 when the Diamondbacks beat his beloved Yankees.[32] 
In City Slickers, Crystal wears a New York Mets baseball cap. In the 1986 
film Running Scared, his character is an avid Chicago Cubs fan, wearing 
a Cubs' jersey in several scenes. In the 2012 film Parental Guidance, his 
character is the announcer for the Fresno Grizzlies, a Minor League Baseball 
team, and aspires to announce for their Major League affiliate, the San 
Francisco Giants. Crystal is also a longtime Los Angeles Clippers fan.[33][34][35] 
Crystal and his wife Janice (née Goldfinger) married in June 1970,[36] 
have two daughters, actress Jennifer and producer Lindsay, and are grandparents.[37]
