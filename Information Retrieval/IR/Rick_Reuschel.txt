Ricky Eugene Reuschel (pronounced RUSH-el) (born May 16, 1949) is an American 
former professional baseball player. He played as a pitcher in Major League 
Baseball from the early 1970s into the early 1990s.[1][2] His nickname 
was "Big Daddy" because of his portly physique.[3] He was known for his 
deceptive style of pitching, which kept hitters off balance by constantly 
varying the speeds of his pitches.[4] Reuschel was listed as 6-foot-4 and 
225 pounds. Reuschel could run surprisingly well for his size (logging 
4 triples in his batting career) and he was frequently used as a pinch 
runner on days he was not pitching. He was also a fair – though awkward-looking 
– hitter, batting well over .200 several times.[1] His older brother Paul 
Reuschel also pitched for the Cubs for a few years while Reuschel was pitching, 
but was not nearly as effective as his younger brother and his career was 
much shorter.[5] Both of them were Illinois farm boys, with strong physiques 
and plain-spoken ways. The two are the only siblings to combine on a shutout.[3] 
On August 21, 1975, Rick started and went 6 1⁄3 innings against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, followed by Paul, who pitched the final 2 2⁄3 innings 
for the Cubs' 7-0 win.[6] Reuschel began his Major League Baseball career 
when he was drafted in the third round of the 1970 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Chicago Cubs,[3][7] at a time when they were declining in 
the post-Durocher era, and provided a strong arm for the Cubs' increasingly 
mediocre staff. After spending two years in the minor leagues, he joined 
the Cubs' major league team in 1972.[2] His best season was in 1977, when 
the Cubs made a brief run at the pennant. Reuschel won 20 games and finished 
third in the Cy Young Award voting behind Steve Carlton and Tommy John.[1][8] 
In addition, Reuschel pitched in a memorable game for Cub fans on July 
28, 1977, when making a rare relief appearance on two days rest, he entered 
the 13th inning of a 15-15 tie between the Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds 
at Wrigley Field. Reuschel retired two batters to end the top of the 13th. 
Then, he singled and scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the 13th, 
also picking up the victory in the 16-15 contest.[9] Reuschel was traded 
to the New York Yankees in 1981.[7] That year, Reuschel made his first 
World Series appearances.[10] The 1981 World Series marked the last chapter 
of the Dodgers-Yankees trilogy of that era, this one won by the Dodgers. 
Reuschel was ineffective in that Series, and it appeared his career might 
be finished.[10] He returned to the Cubs and was on the roster in 1984 
when they won the National League Eastern Division and made the playoffs,[11] 
but, somewhat controversially, he was not named to the playoff roster. 
Reuschel was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1985 as a free agent,[7] 
and had a 14-8 won-loss record with the last-place Pirates,[1] earning 
him the National League's Comeback Player of the Year award.[12][13] The 
Pirates traded Reuschel to the San Francisco Giants in late 1987 for Jeff 
Robinson and Scott Medvin.[7] Reuschel, finally back with a contender, 
became the ace of the Giants' staff and helped them make a late run to 
the National League Western Division title, their first division title 
since 1971. He followed that season by winning 19 games for the Giants 
in 1988.[1][4] In 1989 at the age of 40, Reuschel was selected as the starting 
pitcher for the National League in the 1989 All-Star Game, and gave up 
a lead off home run to Bo Jackson, followed by Wade Boggs' home run to 
start the game.[14] Reuschel finished the 1989 season with 17 wins for 
the Giants as he helped lead them to the World Series (their first since 
1962).[15] In the 1989 World Series, Reuschel was the losing pitcher in 
Game 2 with an 11.25 ERA, five earned runs, and five hits given up against 
the Oakland Athletics.[16] In a nineteen-year major league career, Reuschel 
compiled a record of 214-191 in 557 games (529 starts).[1] He had 102 career 
complete games and 26 of those were shutouts. He allowed 1,330 earned runs 
and 2,015 strike outs in 3,548 and 1/3 innings pitched.[1] Reuschel was 
a two-time Gold Glove Award winner and a three-time All-Star.[17] As of 
2009, Reuschel was in the List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders. 
Reuschel won the Hutch Award in 1985,[18] and was also a winner of Sporting 
News Comeback Player of the Year Award.[12] Reuschel was named to the Baseball
