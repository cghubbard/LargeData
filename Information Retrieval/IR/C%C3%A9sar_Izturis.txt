César David Izturis (/ɪsˈtʊərɪs/; born February 10, 1980) is a Venezuelan 
former professional baseball shortstop. He is the half-brother of shortstop 
Maicer Izturis and former minor league shortstop Julio Izturis.[1] Signed 
by the Toronto Blue Jays as an amateur free agent in 1996, Izturis made 
his debut with Toronto in 2001 and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers 
at the end of the season. Coming from a long tradition of Venezuelan shortstops, 
which includes Chico Carrasquel, Luis Aparicio, Dave Concepción, Ozzie 
Guillén, Omar Vizquel, Álex González and Carlos Guillén, Izturis has the 
defensive skills to rank in such distinguished company. After showing some 
hitting potential with a .269 average in his rookie season with Toronto, 
the Dodgers were enthusiastic to trade for him. Izturis was designated 
as the everyday starting shortstop from Opening Day of the 2002 season, 
and he quickly established himself in the Dodgers' infield. But he showed 
no patience at the plate, resulting in a decline in average and very few 
walks. After two years of barely adequate hitting (though compensated by 
his stellar glovework), he improved markedly in 2004, when he hit .288 
with 62 RBI and 25 stolen bases in 159 games. At the end of the season, 
he earned his first Gold Glove, the first by a Dodger shortstop since Maury 
Wills' back-to-back honors in 1961 and 1962. In 2005, Izturis hit .348 
through June 1 and led the entire majors in hits. He was selected for the 
National League All-Star team, but his batting average later dipped all 
the way down into the .250 range. Curiously, his defense also seemed to 
suffer. After two trips to the disabled list, Izturis underwent Tommy John 
surgery in his right elbow, and returned in mid-June, 2006. With the uncertainty 
around Izturis, the Dodgers acquired shortstop Rafael Furcal in the off-season. 
That move seemed to have put Izturis' future with the Dodgers in doubt. 
With a $13 million annual salary, Furcal did not seem a likely candidate 
to be benched. At the 2006 trade deadline, Izturis was traded to the Chicago 
Cubs for Greg Maddux and cash considerations. On July 19, 2007, Izturis 
and cash were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for a player to be named 
later. On November 16, 2007, the Pirates declined an option on Izturis, 
and he became a free agent. Shortly thereafter on November 30, 2007, Izturis 
signed a one-year, $2.85 million deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.[2] 
On December 16, 2008, Izturis signed a two-year deal with the Baltimore 
Orioles[3] In 2009, he led all starting shortstops in range factor, at 
4.89.[4] On December 10, 2010, Izturis re-signed with the Baltimore Orioles 
to a 1-year contract.[5] On December 21, 2011 he signed a minor league 
contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. He also received an invitation to 
spring training. On March 29, 2012, Izturis was added to the Major League 
25-man roster by the Brewers. On August 6, 2012, the Washington Nationals 
claimed Izturis off waivers from the Brewers. He was designated for assignment 
by the Washington Nationals on August 17, only 11 days after arriving in 
Washington. On August 20, 2012, he was granted free agency. On January 
14, 2013, the Cincinnati Reds announced that they had signed Izturis to 
a minor league contract with an invitation to major league spring training.[6] 
The Reds selected the contract of Izturis on March 31.[7] Izturis signed 
a minor league deal with the Houston Astros on January 14, 2014. He was 
released on March 24. Izturis resides in Barquisimeto, Venezuela in the 
offseason with his wife Liliana and their two children; his son Cesar Daniel 
(born 11-11-1999) and daughter Daniella (born 7-17-2006).[8] Currently 
Cesar now runs an academy in Barquisimeto, Venezuela with his half brother 
Maicer. Cesar Daniel has recently signed with the Mariners as an international
