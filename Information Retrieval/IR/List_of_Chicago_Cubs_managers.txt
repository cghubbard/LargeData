The Chicago Cubs are a Major League Baseball team that plays in the National 
League (NL) Central Division. Since their inception as the White Stockings 
in 1876, the Cubs have employed 56 managers.[1] The duties of the team 
manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field.[2][3] 
The Cubs have had 13 general managers.[4] The general manager controls 
player transactions, hiring and firing of the coaching staff, and negotiates 
with players and agents regarding contracts.[5][6] The first person to 
officially hold the title of general manager for the Cubs was Charles Weber, 
who assumed the title in 1934.[4] The franchise's first manager was Baseball 
Hall of Famer Albert Spalding, who helped the White Stockings become the 
first champions of the newly formed National League.[7] After co-managing 
with Silver Flint during the 1879 Chicago White Stockings season, Hall 
of Famer Cap Anson began an 18-year managerial tenure in 1880, the longest 
in franchise history.[1] Under Anson, the team won five more NL pennants 
— in 1880, 1881, 1882, 1885 and 1886—tying the 1885 World Series and losing 
the 1886 World Series in the process.[a] Anson won 1,283 games as the White 
Stockings' manager, the most in franchise history.[1] After taking over 
for Hall of Fame manager Frank Selee in 1905, Frank Chance — another Hall 
of Famer — managed the team through the 1912 season.[1] During his tenure, 
the franchise won four more NL pennants in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910, 
winning its only two World Series titles in 1907 and 1908.[8] Chance's 
.664 career winning percentage is the highest of any Cubs manager.[1] After 
Chance, from 1913 through 1960, the Cubs employed nineteen managers, nine 
of which were inducted into the Hall of Fame. During this period, the Cubs 
won six more NL pennants, including three under manager Charlie Grimm. 
Split between Grimm's two managerial stints in the 1930s and 1940s, plus 
a brief appearance as manager in 1960,[9] Grimm accumulated 946 career 
wins, second-most in franchise history behind Anson.[1] Owner P. K. Wrigley 
then began experimenting with the managerial position and in December 1960, 
announced that Cubs would not have only one manager for the coming season. 
Instead, the team implemented a new managerial system known as the "College 
of Coaches". The system was meant to blend ideas from several individuals 
instead of relying on one manager.[10] During its first year, the team 
rotated four different managers into the role: Vedie Himsl, Harry Craft, 
El Tappe and Lou Klein. The next year, under the guidance of Tappe, Klein 
and Charlie Metro, the Cubs lost a franchise-record 103 games.[11] Bob 
Kennedy managed the team for the next three seasons until Hall of Famer 
Leo Durocher assumed the managerial role for the 1966 season, effectively 
ending the five-year-long "College of Coaches" experiment.[10] During his 
first season as manager, Durocher's Cubs tied the franchise's 103-game 
loss record set four years earlier by the "College";[11] however, he maintained 
a winning record for the rest of his seven-year tenure.[12] In the last 
37 seasons since Durocher, the Cubs have had 22 managers. Jim Frey and 
Don Zimmer led the team to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) 
in 1984 and 1989, respectively.[1] In both of those seasons, the team's 
manager won a Manager of the Year Award.[13] Jim Riggleman managed the 
team for five years from 1995 through 1999, earning the team's first and 
only wild card playoff spot in 1998. Dusty Baker's Cubs lost in the 2003 
NLCS during the first year of a four-year managing tenure. Baker's successor, 
Lou Piniella, led the team to two consecutive National League Central Division 
titles during his first two years with the team and was awarded the 2008 
Manager of the Year Award.[13] On July 20, 2010, Piniella announced his 
intention to retire as manager of the Cubs following the end of the season.[14] 
However, on August 22, 2010, Piniella announced he would resign after that 
day's game with the Atlanta Braves, citing family reasons. Third base coach 
Mike Quade would finish the rest of the season as manager.[15] The Cubs' 
current general manager is Jed Hoyer, who replaced Jim Hendry.[4] On November 
7, 2013, the Cubs hired Rick Renteria as their new manager. He replaced 
Dale Sveum. He was fired on October 31, 2014 as the team prepared to hire
