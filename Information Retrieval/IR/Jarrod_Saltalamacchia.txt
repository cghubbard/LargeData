Jarrod Scott Saltalamacchia (/ˌsɒltələˈmɑːkiə/; born May 2, 1985), is an 
American professional baseball catcher who is a free agent. He has played 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers, Boston 
Red Sox, Miami Marlins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Detroit Tigers. At 14 
characters, his last name is the longest in Major League Baseball history.[1] 
Saltalamacchia is Italian for "jump over" (salta) "the thicket" (la macchia, 
Southern Italy dialectical term that refers to a kind of tall shrub). His 
nickname is Salty.[2] Born in West Palm Beach, Florida, Saltalamacchia 
attended Royal Palm Beach High School in Royal Palm Beach, Florida, graduating 
in 2003. Saltalamacchia attended high school along with future Texas Rangers 
teammate Kason Gabbard, and the two were friends growing up. A standout, 
Saltalamacchia was a member of Team Florida USA and won gold with the team 
in the 2001 Junior Olympics.[3] The Atlanta Braves selected Saltalamacchia 
in the first round (36 overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. 
In 2006, Saltalamacchia had a breakout season for the Class A Myrtle Beach 
Pelicans, where the switch-hitting slugger hit .314 with 35 doubles, 19 
homers, and 81 runs batted in (RBIs) in 129 games. Saltalamacchia ranked 
18th in Baseball America top 100 prospects in 2006, and 36th the following 
year.[4] In the 2007 season, Saltalamacchia started at catcher for the 
Double-A Mississippi Braves. In 22 games played, he belted 7 home runs 
with a batting average of .373. On his 22nd birthday, he was called up 
to Atlanta to replace Brayan Peña on the roster and to fill in for Brian 
McCann, who re-injured his finger on May 1, 2007.[5] Saltalamacchia's call-up 
made him the new record-holder of the longest surname in Major League Baseball 
history, at 14 letters,[6] breaking the record set by William Van Landingham 
(or tying it, depending on whether one counts the space in the latter's 
surname). On May 6, 2007, Saltalamacchia had the first hit of his major 
league career in the sixth inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the 
seventh inning, with two outs and two men on base, Saltalamacchia got his 
first RBI, which also drove in the winning run for the Braves. On May 27, 
2007, Saltalamacchia hit his first major league home run, a solo shot off 
Cole Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies. On June 26 in a start at first 
base, Saltalamacchia had his first multi-home run game. Both blasts came 
batting right-handed off Washington Nationals pitcher Mike Bacsik. Because 
Saltalamacchia was "blocked" (by McCann, who was recently signed to a large 
contract with Atlanta), he was the subject of much trade speculation within 
baseball, and was traded to the Texas Rangers on July 31, 2007, with Elvis 
Andrus, Neftalí Feliz, Matt Harrison, and Beau Jones for first baseman 
Mark Teixeira and reliever Ron Mahay. In 2007, Saltalamacchia batted .284 
with 4 home runs and 12 RBIs in 47 games with Atlanta. Upon joining the 
Rangers after being traded Saltalamacchia changed his number to 25. In 
his first game with the Rangers on August 1, 2007, Saltalamacchia started 
at first base and drove in two runs. On August 22, 2007, Saltalamacchia 
had two home runs and seven RBIs in the historic 30–3 rout of the Baltimore 
Orioles.[7] In 46 games with the Rangers in 2007, Saltamacchia batted .251, 
collecting 7 home runs and 21 RBIs. On March 26, 2008, Saltalamacchia lost 
the starting catching job to Gerald Laird, and the Rangers chose to send 
him down to the minors to catch every day instead of sitting as the backup.[8] 
However, Saltalamacchia was soon called up on April 25, 2008.[9] After 
the Rangers signed free agent Andruw Jones, Saltalamacchia gave up his 
number 25 to Jones and selected the number 21.[10] On April 25, 2009, Saltalamacchia 
struck out in his 28th consecutive game played, setting a new MLB strikeout 
streak record for a position player (pitcher Bill Stoneman holds the all-time 
record with 37 games). Saltalamacchia's streak started on July 23, 2008.[11] 
Saltalamacchia suffered a shoulder injury on August 15, 2009 and was placed 
on the disabled list. Saltalamacchia was placed on the disabled list after 
the second game of the 2010 season. On April 27, 2010, Saltalamacchia was 
removed from the DL and assigned to the Oklahoma City RedHawks.[12] He 
has struggled with throwing the ball back to the pitcher. Saltalamacchia 
was traded to the Boston Red Sox just before the Major League Baseball 
trading deadline on July 31, 2010. The Rangers received minor league prospects 
Chris McGuiness, Román Méndez, a player to be named later (Michael Thomas), 
and cash. He reported to the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International 
League.[13][14] Saltalamacchia was called up on August 11 after Kevin Cash 
went on the disabled list needing surgery in his left thumb, in September 
2010.[15][16] In the 2011 season, Saltalamacchia was slated at the beginning 
of the year to be Boston's primary catcher with veteran Jason Varitek taking 
the role as the backup. Out of the gate, he struggled defensively and showed 
weakness in the batter's box.[17] However, he showed improvement at the 
plate as the season progressed, hitting .327 in the month of June. Despite 
his low average, Saltalamacchia showed decent power and finished out the 
year hitting .235/.288/.450 with 16 HR, and 56 RBIs in 103 games played. 
On January 15, 2012, Saltalamacchia avoided arbitration by signing a one-year, 
non-guaranteed contract worth $2.5 million with the Sox to be their starting 
catcher. Kelly Shoppach was his backup until being traded, making Ryan 
Lavarnway his backup catcher.[18] On May 26, 2012, with one out in the 
ninth inning, Saltalamacchia hit a 2-run walk-off home run off of Fernando 
Rodney to beat the Tampa Bay Rays. As the season progressed, Saltalamacchia 
was moved to 1st base as manager Bobby Valentine gave Ryan Lavarnway a 
look as the team's starting catcher. Saltalamacchia finished the year batting 
.222/.288/.454 with 25 HR, and 59 RBIs in a career high 121 games played. 
Saltalamacchia was the starting catcher in 2013 for the Red Sox, and David 
Ross and Ryan Lavarnway were his backups. He went 1-2 with 3 walks and 
a double on Opening Day against the Yankees. On October 13, 2013, Saltlamacchia 
hit a walk-off single, driving in Jonny Gomes to beat the Detroit Tigers 
6-5 in the second game of the 2013 ALCS. Saltalamacchia was benched for 
the final three games of the 2013 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals 
in favor of David Ross following a series of defensive errors.[19] Saltalamacchia 
appeared in 121 games in 2013 and hit .273/338/.466 with 14 home runs, 
65 RBIs, 68 runs and 40 doubles, becoming the thirteenth different catcher 
ever to have 40 doubles in a season.[20] Following the 2013 season, the 
Red Sox declined to offer Saltalamacchia a qualifying offer, making him 
an unrestricted free agent.[19] On December 3, 2013, Saltalamacchia agreed 
to a three-year, $21 million contract with the Miami Marlins.[21] The deal 
was finalized on December 6.[22] He was designated for assignment by the 
Marlins on April 27, 2015, and released on May 5.[23][24] On May 7, Saltalamacchia 
signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[25] After 
reporting to extended spring training and then playing for the Reno Aces 
for a week, the Diamondbacks promoted him to the major leagues to replace 
Tuffy Gosewisch, who suffered a season-ending knee injury, as their starting 
catcher.[26] On December 6, 2015, Saltalamacchia signed a one-year major 
league contract with the Detroit Tigers for the league minimum salary. 
The Miami Marlins are still paying the bulk of Saltalamacchia's existing 
contract.[27] On April 13, 2016, Saltalamacchia hit his 100th career home 
run, a grand slam off Arquimedes Caminero of the Pittsburgh Pirates.[28] 
Saltalamacchia would finish the 2016 season with a .171 batting average.[29] 
Saltalamacchia is a Christian.[30] Saltalamacchia and his former Rangers 
teammate Kason Gabbard were childhood friends. Both attended Royal Palm 
Beach High School and were traded to the Rangers from different teams on 
July 31, 2007.[31] He is married to Ashley Saltalamacchia, his gym teacher 
in high school. They married a year after he graduated.[32] The couple
