Walter "Dobie" Moore (February 8, 1896 - August 20, 1947) was an American 
shortstop and right-handed batter in the Negro Leagues who played his entire 
career with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League. His 
career ended after only seven seasons when he shattered his already injured 
leg while escaping a woman who had shot him. Born in Georgia, Moore served 
in the United States Army and played for the 25th Infantry Wreckers from 
1916 to 1920, along with Bullet Rogan and other future Negro Leaguers. 
He went directly to the Monarchs in mid-season 1920, where he was the league's 
top shortstop until his career ended. 5'11" and 230 pounds, he fielded 
his position with Gold Glove ability and hit for a .359 lifetime batting 
average with better than average power and speed. Nicknamed "the Black 
Cat", Moore won the NNL batting title in 1924 when he hit .453. He helped 
the Monarchs to three league titles (1923, 1924, and 1925), and one Colored 
World Series title in 1924. He batted .300 in the 1923 Series and .364 
in a losing cause in the 1925 Series. He had the highest lifetime batting 
average (.385) in the California Winter League, which was the first integrated 
league in the United States, and starred in the 1923-24 Cuban Winter League 
in his only season there. His career ended abruptly in mid-1926 when he 
was shot in the leg by a girlfriend and suffered a compound fracture jumping 
from a second-story balcony to escape from her. He reportedly played semi-pro 
ball in Detroit into the 1930s as a stiff-legged first baseman. Several 
baseball figures - including Major League Baseball manager Casey Stengel, 
Negro league administrator Cum Posey, and teammate Chet Brewer - described 
Moore as one of the best shortstops in any professional baseball league.[3]
