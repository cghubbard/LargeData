Daniel Paul Bard (born June 25, 1985) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He played for the Boston 
Red Sox from 2009 to 2013. At the midpoint of the 2004 season, Baseball 
America named Danny Bard the top freshman pitcher in the U.S. and gave 
him Freshman All-America honors. For the entire season, Bard was named 
to Baseball America's All-Freshman second team and was named as Freshman 
All-America by Collegiate Baseball. He was Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) 
Freshman of the Year and earned first-team all-conference honors. In 16 
games pitched, Bard was 8–4 with a 3.88 ERA; his eight wins tied the University 
of North Carolina-Chapel Hill freshman record. For the 2005 season, Bard 
was named preseason first-team All-America by Baseball America and was 
named preseason third-team All-America by Collegiate Baseball and by the 
National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association. Bard went 7–5 with a 
4.22 ERA in 16 starts and was third in the ACC in opponents' batting average 
at .219. He was named to the Roger Clemens Award Watch List. Bard was a 
second-team summer All-American selection in 2005 Cape Cod League after 
a successful summer with the Wareham Gatemen, where he led the league in 
innings pitched and strikeouts while finishing 3rd in ERA. Bard and fellow 
North Carolina left-hander Andrew Miller were rated the top two prospects 
in the Cape Cod League. Danny Bard and Miller led the UNC to the College 
World Series, but lost to Oregon State, two games to one.[1] He finished 
his junior year with a 9–4 record and a 3.64 ERA in 17 starts. He earned 
ACC pitcher of the week honors twice during the 2006 season. On June 6, 
2006, Bard was selected in the first round (28th overall) of the 2006 Major 
League Baseball Draft by the Boston Red Sox. On September 4, Bard signed 
with the team. Bard admitted he had enrolled in classes at UNC as a backup 
plan in case a deal with the Red Sox was not finalized in time.[2][3] Bard 
had been previously selected in the 20th round with the 604th overall selection 
out of high school by the New York Yankees in the 2003 Major League Baseball 
Draft, but did not sign. Drafted as a starting pitcher, Bard spent the 
2007 season in the same role starting all 22 of his appearances with the 
Greenville Drive and Lancaster Jethawks. Unfortunately for Bard, the results 
were disastrous: He posted a 7.05 ERA between the two levels, and walked 
78 batters in 75⅓ innings pitched. Because of the poor success starting, 
at the end of the 2007 season he was moved into the bullpen to pitch as 
a reliever.[4] While pitching out of the bullpen in winter ball in Hawaii, 
Bard put up a 1.08 ERA in 16 appearances. Though control was still an issue, 
there was large improvement. Remaining in the bullpen, Bard split time 
between the Greenville Drive and Portland Sea Dogs. He posted a 1.51 ERA 
and had 107 strikeouts in 77⅔ innings of work, and was named the Boston 
Red Sox 2008 Minor League Pitcher of the Year. He also raised questions 
with his unsportsmanlike conduct toward fans while in the bullpen for the 
Sea Dogs. Bard began the season at AAA Pawtucket. He faced 58 batters in 
16 innings, giving up six hits and striking out 29. Of those six hits, 
two were home runs. On May 10, 2009, the Red Sox designated pitcher Javier 
López for assignment, and called Bard up from the Triple-A Pawtucket Red 
Sox.[5] On May 13, 2009, he made his major-league debut against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim pitching two scoreless innings in an 8–4 loss. 
Bard made his debut at Fenway Park on May 20, against the Toronto Blue 
Jays in the 8th inning. He gave up two hits on the first two pitches thrown, 
eventually giving up a run. He pitched ⅔ of an inning before being replaced 
by left-hander Hideki Okajima after the second out, leaving two runners 
on base. Bard recorded his first career save in the 13th inning of a 5–2 
victory against the Philadelphia Phillies. Although he gave up a walk and 
hit a batter, Bard managed to strike out the side to clinch the save. Bard 
recorded his first major league win on August 26, against the Chicago White 
Sox after pitching a scoreless inning and a third in the eight and ninth 
followed by a walk off home run by David Ortiz. Bard was a post-season 
correspondent for ESPN.[6] Bard was the primary setup man in the bullpen 
once again. He appeared in 73 games, posted an impressive 1.93 ERA and 
1.00 WHIP on the season with 76 strikeouts. Bard set the club record with 
25 consecutive scoreless appearances, running from May 27 to July 31. The 
previous record was held by Ugueth Urbina.[7] Bard's season, like that 
of his team, came to a crushing end. After dazzling for most of 2011, Bard 
had a terrible last month of the year: "He finished September 0–4 with 
a 10.64 ERA, issuing more walks (nine) than he had in the previous three 
months combined (eight). Based on win probability added (WPA), the player 
most responsible for Boston's collapse was Bard."[8] The Red Sox made Bard 
a starting pitcher for 2012. He started the season 5–6 with a 5.24 ERA, 
striking out 34 while walking 37 and hitting eight batters. On June 5, 
2012, Bard was optioned to AAA Pawtucket. In his last start prior to his 
demotion, he lasted 1.2 innings against the Toronto Blue Jays, giving up 
five runs, six walks, and hitting two batters.[9] Bard continued to struggle 
in AAA, surrendering 15 walks and posting a 7.08 ERA in 20⅓ innings through 
the end of July.[10] Bard was recalled on August 30 when Zach Stewart was 
optioned out.[11] Bard started the 2013 season in the team's Double-A affialiate 
in Portland. He was recalled on April 23. On April 28, he was optioned 
back to Portland to make room for returning reliever Joel Hanrahan.[12] 
He was designated for assignment on September 1. He was claimed on waivers 
by the Chicago Cubs on September 4. On September 4, 2013 Bard was claimed 
off waivers by the Cubs from the Red Sox.[13] He became a free agent on 
December 2, 2013 after being non-tendered by the Cubs. On January 31, 2014, 
Bard signed with the Texas Rangers.[14] He inexplicably lost command of 
his pitches, walking nine and hitting seven batters while recording two 
outs in a stint for the Rangers' Single-A club.[15] On June 19, 2014, Bard 
was released by the Rangers.[16] The Chicago Cubs signed Bard to a minor-league 
deal on January 18, 2015. On January 11th, 2016, Bard signed a minor league 
deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates. On May 13th, 2016, Bard was released 
by the Pirates.[17] After failing to make a minor league appearance, Bard 
was released on May 14, 2016.[18] On June 6, 2016, Bard signed a minor 
league deal with the St. Louis Cardinals.[19] Bard throws four pitches. 
About half of his pitches thrown are four-seam fastballs in the range of 
92–96 mph. He also features a two-seam fastball (93–97), slider (79–83), 
and changeup (86–89). Bard's changeup is used almost exclusively against 
left-handed hitters. He uses the slider, too, against lefties, but much 
more so against right-handers.[20] Bard's velocity on all of his pitch 
types dipped several miles per hour in 2012, presumably as a result of 
his conversion from a relief pitcher to a starter. Bard said he was mildly 
surprised, but not alarmed by the drop: "I knew there’d be somewhat of 
a drop-off, velocity-wise, when I went to starting. I didn’t think it would 
be quite this big ... When I’m 93, 94, they’re just as late as they were 
on that 97. I think it’s the way I’ve been able to set it up. If I can 
just establish strike one a little more consistently, the velocity can 
be whatever it wants to be."[21] His brother, Luke Bard, played college 
baseball at Georgia Tech and was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the
