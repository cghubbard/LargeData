Ivey Brown Wingo (July 8, 1890 – March 1, 1941) was an American professional 
baseball player and manager. He played all or part of seventeen seasons 
in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds, 
primarily as a catcher. It is not known exactly where Ivey Wingo was born, 
with some accounts say Gainesville, Georgia[1][2] and others Norcross, 
Georgia.[3] Regardless, he spent the entirety of his life as a resident 
of the state of Georgia.[3] Wingo spent the first four years of his career 
(1911–14) with the Cardinals and last thirteen years with the Reds. He 
also managed the Reds for two games during the 1916 season. He led the 
National League in at bats per strikeout (30.7) in 1917.[4] Wingo is best 
known for being the backstop for the 1919 World Series Championship Reds 
team. That team is known for winning the a series fixed by, amongst others, 
Arnold Rothstein and Abe "Little Champ" Attell. He played with the Reds 
until 1926, then continued with the team as a coach before getting in one 
final major league appearance on the last day of the 1929 season, replacing 
regular catcher Johnny Gooch in the late innings of a game against the 
Cardinals. At the time of his retirement, he held the National League record 
for games caught in a career at 1,233.[3] He still holds the post-1900 
major league records for most career errors by a catcher (234).[3] Wingo
