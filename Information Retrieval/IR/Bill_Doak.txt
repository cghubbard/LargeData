William Leopold Doak (January 28, 1891 – November 26, 1954) was an American 
Major League Baseball pitcher who spent 11 years with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Doak was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1914 he went 19–6 and lead 
the league with an ERA of 1.72. Doak won 20 games in 1920, and led the

a short time in 1929 before retiring. His lifetime record is 169–157, with 
an ERA of 2.98 and 1,014 strikeouts. Even though Doak played with many

pitch, the spitball, earned him the nickname "Spittin' Bill". When the

to Bradenton, Florida, where he owned a candy shop (Bill Doak's Sweet Shop), 
and also coached the Bradenton High School baseball team, which made it
