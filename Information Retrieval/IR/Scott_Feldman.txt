Scott Wynne Feldman (born February 7, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, Baltimore Orioles, Houston Astros 
and Toronto Blue Jays. After going 25–2 in his first two years of college 
baseball, he was drafted in the 30th round by the Texas Rangers in 2003. 
Feldman had Tommy John surgery later that year. He followed it up with 
a minor league career in which he had a 2.70 ERA, and held batters to only 
6.6 hits per 9 innings, pitching almost exclusively in relief. After pitching 
out of the bullpen while bouncing back and forth between Texas and its 
Triple-A affiliate in 2005–07, Feldman converted to a starter in 2008. 
He established himself in 2009 with a breakout season for the Rangers. 
He was 17–8, tied for 4th in the American League in wins, and tied the 
major league record with 12 victories on the road. The 6-foot-5-inch (196 cm) 
Feldman was big from an early age. "His second-grade teacher made a comment 
to my wife that it was like 'Alice in Wonderland,' because Scott was always 
too big for his seat", his father recalls.[1] As for Feldman's road to 
the major leagues, "The dream started off like any other kid", Feldman 
said. "You’d think about it as you were watching games in front of the 
TV, and you’d think about it playing in the neighborhood park with your 
friends. You always hope, but you just don’t know if it's ever going to 
happen."[2] His father, Marshall, an FBI agent who grew up in a Pennsylvania 
coal mining town and played college baseball at Duquesne, coached Feldman 
in youth baseball in Northern California.[3] He worked at Mollie Stones 
in Burlingame as a courtesy clerk. His store manager Mark Lucchesi taught 
him how to throw a change up. He went to Lincoln Elementary, Burlingame 
Intermediate School and later, Feldman attended Burlingame High School 
in Burlingame, California, where he pitched a no-hitter.[4] Feldman led 
the Peninsula Athletic League in batting average in his junior year.[1] 
He was overweight in high school; at one point he was up to 265 pounds 
(120 kg).[1][2] Feldman lost 40 pounds (18 kg) before the start of his 
freshman year at the College of San Mateo, and walked on to the team.[2][5] 
In two seasons, he went 25–2, with a 1.30 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio 
of 8-to-1.[2] "When Feldman pitched", said Bulldogs coach Doug Williams, 
"the game was 95% over."[6] He earned Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year 
honors both as a freshman in 2002 and as a sophomore in 2003, and was also 
an All-American both years.[7] "He has a gift", Williams said.[1] Picked 
in the 41st round (the 1,241st pick overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball 
Draft by the Houston Astros, he did not sign. He was then drafted again, 
in the 30th round (886th overall) of the 2003 Draft by the Texas Rangers, 
13 rounds behind future teammate Ian Kinsler, and this time he signed with 
the Rangers after they offered him a lucrative contract.[2][8] Feldman 
underwent reconstructive elbow surgery for a torn ulnar collateral ligament 
in October 2003.[1][9] In his four appearances in 2004 for the Arizona 
League Rangers in the Arizona League, he pitched seven scoreless innings.[10] 
He began the 2005 season with the Single-A Bakersfield Blaze, but after 
nine scoreless innings in relief was quickly promoted to the Double-A Frisco 
RoughRiders.[10] On July 28, 2005, Feldman and two teammates threw a perfect 
game against the Corpus Christi Hooks. It was the first combined nine-inning 
perfect game in Texas League history, and the third overall. Feldman was 
tasked with getting the last three outs, and with two outs in the ninth 
he let the count get to 3–1.[11] "I was just telling myself, 'Don't walk 
him,'" Feldman said. "Once it got to 3–1, I threw it right down the middle. 
If they got a hit, they got a hit. But they're not going to break up a 
perfect game on a walk." The batter grounded out.[12] On July 31, the three 
pitchers shared the Texas League Pitcher of the Week Award.[13] With the 
RoughRiders, he held opposing batters to a .202 batting average in 46 relief 
appearances, led the team with 14 saves (which tied for fifth-most in the 
league), and had a 2.36 ERA.[10][14] For the 2005 season, between the two 
teams he had a 2.06 ERA and 17 saves in 52 appearances, all in relief.[10] 
Baseball America tabbed him as having the best control of all minor league 
pitchers in the Rangers' organization.[14] Prior to the 2006 season, MLB.com 
beat reporter T. R. Sullivan opined that Feldman was the Rangers' top minor 
league relief prospect.[15] In 2006, in 23 relief appearances for the Rangers' 
Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma RedHawks, he had a 1.98 ERA, and in 2007 
in 21 relief appearances for the team he had a 4.50 ERA.[10] Later in 2007, 
he pitched in the Arizona Fall League, to work on a new three-quarters 
delivery.[16] In 2008, as the Rangers decided to convert Feldman to a starter, 
he started and won a game for Frisco, taking a perfect game into the fifth 
and a no-hitter into the seventh ("For my first start, it was a lot of 
fun", Feldman said).[4] He also started and won the two games that he pitched 
for Oklahoma.[4][10][17][18] Overall, through 2008 Feldman had a minor 
league career ERA of 2.70 in 153.1 innings in 105 games (all but six as 
a reliever), and gave up on average only 6.6 hits per every 9 innings.[10] 
Feldman was a late-season call-up in 2005. "The night before, I didn’t 
sleep a minute. I didn’t know what to expect, but when I walked in [the 
locker room], I saw a lot of the guys I had seen on TV all these years, 
and was like, 'Holy cow, I’m in the big leagues'", he remembers.[2] He 
made his major league debut against the Chicago White Sox on August 31, 
2005. In eight relief appearances with the Rangers, he compiled a record 
of 0–1, with an ERA of 0.91 in 9.1 innings of work.[8] Towards the end 
of the spring training in 2006, Feldman was feeling confident that he was 
going to make the parent club's 25-man roster. A week before Opening Day 
he was called into Manager Buck Showalter's office. But instead of telling 
Feldman he had made the team, for the first 10 minutes Showalter and the 
team's pitching coach Mark Connor spoke on and on about how Feldman had 
had a solid spring training — but needed to work on some things. Feldman 
couldn't believe it but eventually thought, "Holy smoke, I’m going down 
[to the minors]." Suddenly, unable to continue the prank any longer, Showalter 
burst out laughing: "Pack your bags, rookie, you’re coming with us!"[19] 
During the regular season, Feldman bounced back and forth between the Rangers 
and Oklahoma. The national spotlight shone briefly on Feldman on August 
16, 2006, when he sparked a violent bench-clearing brawl in the ninth inning 
of a game between the Rangers and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Tensions 
between the two division rivals were already high after two Ranger starting 
pitchers — Adam Eaton and Vicente Padilla — had been ejected in previous 
games that month for throwing at Angel hitters, along with Texas manager 
Buck Showalter. Before Feldman took the mound in relief, on a night with 
a game-time temperature of 101 degrees, two Angel pitchers (Kevin Gregg 
and Brendan Donnelly) had already been thrown out of the game for hitting 
Ranger batters, and Angel manager Mike Scioscia and acting manager/bench 
coach Ron Roenicke had been ejected as well.[20] Feldman hit Angel second 
baseman Adam Kennedy in the buttocks with a fastball with two outs and 
the Rangers up 9–3.[21] Kennedy charged the mound as the 6'5" Feldman stood 
atop it and threw down his glove.[22] When Kennedy reached him, triggering 
a fight between Feldman and the light-hitting 6'1" Kennedy, Feldman punched 
him in the armpit.[22] An announcer describing the fight said, "[Feldman] 
even punches like he throws — sidearm and underhand."[23] "I didn't charge 
him", Feldman said in his defense. "I couldn't just stand there."[24] Feldman 
was suspended for six games.[25] As to others' reactions, Feldman said: 
"Everybody is telling me to take boxing lessons."[26] In 36 relief appearances 
in 2006, he had an ERA of 3.92.[8] In games that were late and close, Feldman 
held the sixteen batters he faced hitless.[8] Feldman was in the Rangers' 
2007 spring training camp, and won the final spot in the Texas bullpen.[27] 
He picked up his first Major League victory on April 11 in his 47th big-league 
appearance. "I'll always remember it, no doubt about it", Feldman said.[28] 
He was sent down, however, on May 1. That began a trend, as he was called 
up and send down five more times during the season.[29] He made some changes 
in his delivery in September. Instead of throwing sidearm, he raised his 
arm angle and threw from a three-quarters delivery, which pitching coach 
Mark Connor observed gave him more sink on his fastball and downward movement 
on his breaking ball. "This has a chance to be pretty good", Connor said. 
"He was busting his fastball 94–95, the ball was sinking, and his four-seamer 
was cutting."[30] He was 1–2 for the season, with a 5.77 ERA in 29 games.[8] 
He held the first batter he faced in each game to a .160 batting average, 
and his "ground ball:fly ball ratio" of 1.39 was the highest on the team.[8] 
In spring training in 2008, Feldman changed his release point, and used 
the three-quarter delivery that he had begun to use late in 2007. Manager 
Ron Washington noted: "It makes his ball heavier, and his movement a little 
more pronounced."[31] In late March, he was one of three pitchers vying 
for one long relief spot on the team, though the Rangers also began experimenting 
with converting him to be a starter.[32] General Manager Jon Daniels observed: 
"Toward the end of spring training something clicked with his new [three-quarter] 
arm slot."[33] On March 22, despite Feldman's success with his new, higher 
arm angle, the Rangers optioned him to Oklahoma, where he was a starter.[34] 
In April he bounced back and forth between Texas and Frisco.[35] In his 
first Major League start, on April 13, he allowed three runs in six innings 
and did not receive a decision. "Feldman was outstanding", manager Washington 
said. "He hung in there and battled."[36] Feldman recorded his first major 
league hit on June 13 against Óliver Pérez of the New York Mets. On August 
13, against the Boston Red Sox, he allowed 10 runs in the first inning 
(a team record). This was the first time a major league pitcher gave up 
at least 12 runs without taking a loss since Gene Packard of the St. Louis 
Cardinals did it on August 3, 1918).[37][38] T. R. Sullivan of MLB.com 
wrote towards the end of the season: "He's going to win the bronze medal 
for innings pitched on the Rangers this season. ... He has exceeded all 
expectations, and his lack of history as a starter makes it difficult to 
figure where this great experiment is headed."[39] General Manager Daniels 
noted: "Feldman has really saved our pen this year, and he wasn't a guy 
we were counting on in the beginning of the season."[40] The Rangers wanted 
to limit his use towards the end of the seaton, but had to keep him in 
the rotation because of injuries to the other pitchers.[41] For the season, 
he was 6–8 in 25 starts and three relief appearances, over 151.1 innings 
— just two innings fewer than he had pitched in his entire minor league 
career. He also led the Rangers' pitching staff in quality starts (13), 
quality start percentage (52%), strikes looking (29%), "grounded into double 
plays" (24), and "grounded into double play rate" (21%).[14][42] His 13 
unearned runs tied for the third-highest total in the AL.[14] During the 
off-season, club president Nolan Ryan emphasized conditioning for the Rangers 
pitchers. Feldman and nine other of the team's top young pitchers were 
brought to Arlington in November for a week-long conditioning camp. "It's 
different", Feldman said. "In the past, it was a little more of 'this is 
what you need to do, now go out and do it.' Most guys would do it, but 
this is their way of overseeing it and making sure everybody is ready."[43] 
The Rangers decided that Feldman would begin 2009 as a middle reliever, 
and Kris Benson would be a starter. "Feldman makes us a better team in 
the bullpen", explained Washington. "He goes down there with better stuff 
than he had before."[44] Feldman was disappointed at the change.[45] Within 
a month Benson was injured, however, and Feldman took his place in the 
rotation on April 25. "I'm excited", said Feldman. "I love starting."[46] 
At the suggestion of pitching coach Mike Maddux, he changed his windup 
to a full windmill. He remained in the rotation thereafter.[47][48] In 
early May, Washington noted: "He has real life on his fastball, his slider 
is harder than it has been, his breaking ball is much crisper, and he's 
getting a good feel for his changeup. He's got four pitches he can throw 
over the plate."[49] Feldman began the 2009 season 5–0. He sported better 
mechanics and a different repertoire (a new and improved cut fastball), 
threw 1–2 mph harder, and kept the ball down — forcing more ground balls. 
"Scott Feldman has been great since we put him in the starting rotation", 
said Manager Washington. "He always does what you need him to do, keep 
you in the ballgame."[50] At the All Star break, despite not having moved 
into the starting rotation until nearly a month into the season, Feldman 
was 8–2, led the AL in won-lost percentage (.800), and was 9th in hits 
per nine innings (7.75) and walks + hits per inning pitched (1.18). "He's 
going to get better", said Nolan Ryan on July 20, noting Feldman's youth 
and his recent change in pitching style.[51] On July 25, Feldman outpitched 
Kansas City All-Star and AL ERA leader Zack Greinke with eight innings 
of four-hit, shutout ball, leading the Rangers to a 2–0 victory. "Feldman 
matched the best pitcher in baseball", Washington said. "I’m so happy for 
him. Two pitchers went at it pretty good, and our's won the battle."[52] 
The eight innings were Feldman's major-league high, as he mixed in a changeup, 
curveball, and slider with his fastball.[52] As of the end of July, opposing 
batters were hitting .228 against Feldman (and only .217 in his starts), 
the fourth-lowest batting average in the league.[53] In his starts through 
the end of July he had a 3.04 ERA, and 12 of his 17 starts were quality 
starts.[54] After he beat the Mariners on short (three days') rest at the 
beginning of August for the team lead in wins, Seattle manager Don Wakamatsu 
said: "I thought Feldman was awfully tough. I have seen this kid, and he 
gets better every year. I think you have to tip your hat."[55] As of mid-August, 
Feldman's cut fastball was the most effective in the major leagues.[56] 
And it was the third-most-effective pitch overall, behind only Tim Lincecum's 
change-up and Clayton Kershaw's fastball.[56] While in 2008 he used his 
cutter 13.4% of the time, in 2009 he was throwing it 30.4% of the time.[56] 
The only starting pitchers who were throwing cutters more often were Brian 
Bannister, Doug Davis, and Halladay.[56] The press began to take notice. 
On August 14 Matthew Berry of ESPN noted that: "since April 25, when Scott 
Feldman ... rejoined the Rangers' rotation, only Justin Verlander has more 
wins than Feldman's 12."[57] And two days later, Phil Rogers wrote for 
The Chicago Tribune: "Scott Feldman is creeping into consideration for 
the bottom of Cy Young ballots."[58] On August 23, Feldman threw seven 
scoreless innings while allowing only four hits in a win over the Tampa 
Bay Rays. It was his 13th win of the season (tied for third in the AL) 
and put his season record at 13–4. It was Feldman's ninth road win of the 
season (bringing him to 9–1 on the road), tying him with Sabathia for best 
in the AL. The win put the Rangers two games ahead of the Rays in the AL 
wild card standings, and one game behind the Red Sox.[59][60] His career-high 
11 strikeouts were the most by a Ranger since Matt Perisho struck out 12 
in 1999 (see video of parts of Feldman's 11 strikeouts).[61] Commenting 
on Feldman's last strikeout, Carlos Peña said: "I was on second base, and 
I saw a pitch that he made to B. J. [Upton], and I was like, 'Wow.' I thought 
to myself, 'That's unhittable right there.'"[62] Rays manager Joe Maddon 
called Feldman's performance "the best-pitched game against us all year", 
in spite of Mark Buehrle's perfect game against them earlier in the season.[63] 
On August 29, he again held the opposition scoreless, this time the Twins 
for 5.2 innings in a 3–0 victory. "His ball was definitely moving all over 
the place, with a great breaking ball", Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said. 
"He throws a nasty cutter, and the ball sinks. He was tough on us."[64] 
It was good for his 14th win of the season (tied for second in the AL behind 
Sabathia), raising his record to 14–4.[64] His cutter was more dominant 
than any other thrown over a single season since Baseball Info Solutions 
first began collecting cutter data in 2004.[65] On September 4, he extended 
his scoreless streak to 18.1 innings before giving up a run to the Baltimore 
Orioles in the sixth inning at Camden Yards; that was the only run he gave 
up over 6.2 innings in a 5–1 win, to bring his record to 15–4.[66] It was 
also his 11th road victory (matching the club record held by Rick Helling 
(1998) and Padilla (2008)), and he matched the club record set by Bobby 
Witt (1990) with his 7th consecutive road win of the season.[67][68] Evan 
Grant, writing for D Magazine, asked rhetorically: "At some point, RHP 
Scott Feldman is going to have to enter the Cy Young Award conversation, 
isn't he?"[69] On September 9, Feldman threw seven innings of shutout ball 
against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win.[70] He struck 
out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and 
tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories.[71][72] He became 
the first Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006.[73] 
It was his seventh win in a row, eighth straight road victory (a new Texas 
record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and 
tops in the AL).[71] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than 
I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 
innings.[71] "The preparation is the same. I think it's a pretty humbling 
game, so you can't get too high or too low."[71] He became the first Rangers 
right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts.[74] Outfielder 
Marlon Byrd said: "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. 
You get a couple of runs early, and you feel you have a 'W' in hand. He 
has been unbelievable this year when he steps on the mound. ... He just 
keeps getting better."[75] The Boston Herald reported: "Scott Feldman started 
the season in the bullpen. He'll end it as a Cy Young Award candidate."[76] 
Phil Rogers of the Chicago Tribune referred to him as " an under-the-radar 
Cy Young candidate."[77] And Jennifer Floyd Engel of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
wrote: "Is there a more likable "stud player" on any of the locals than 
Scott Feldman? Dude is amazing, wins freakishly a lot on the road, is Boy 
Scout-ishly dependable, has been an ace on what is really a pretty good 
staff, and is humble as hell. He's certainly deserving to be in Cy Young 
conversations."[78] Manny Navarro of The Miami Herald also referred to 
him as a Cy Young Award candidate.[79] Through September 10, he was leading 
the AL in won-lost percentage (.800), tied with Sabathia and Verlander 
for the league lead in wins (16), had the 3rd-lowest "slugging percentage 
against" (.359; behind Félix Hernández and Greinke), was tied for 4th in 
double plays induced (20), and had the 7th-lowest "OPS-against" (.670).[80][81] 
Feldman was holding lefties to a .220 batting average, and as a starter 
he had kept batters to the 2nd-lowest batting-average-against on balls 
that they had put in play (.261) among AL starters (behind only Washburn), 
had the 4th-best ERA in the league (3.10; behind Greinke, Hernández, and 
Halladay), was tied for the 4th-lowest batting-average-against (.236), 
had stranded the 5th-highest percentage of runners (78.3%), and had the 
5th-highest ground ball/fly ball ratio (1.48).[81] He had the most effective 
cutter of all major league starters, and had thrown it 33% of the time 
(behind only Brian Bannister (52%) and Halladay (42%) among AL starters).[81] 
Feldman had also pitched at least five innings in all but one of his 26 
starts in 2009.[82] As of mid-September, Feldman's cutter was still the 
third-most-effective pitch in the major leagues, behind only Tim Lincecum's 
changeup and Randy Wolf's fastball.[83] For the season, Feldman was 17–8 
with a 4.08 ERA in 34 games, 31 of them starts.[84] Despite not having 
become a starter until the end of April, he tied for 4th in the American 
League in wins, and only four pitchers in the majors had more victories.[84][85] 
His club-record 12 victories on the road tied the major league record.[84] 
Feldman became the third player in Rangers history to win at least 17 games 
in 31 starts or fewer, joining Kenny Rogers (17 wins in 31 starts in 1995) 
and Ferguson Jenkins (18 wins in 30 starts in 1978).[85] He was named the 
Texas Rangers' Pitcher of the Year for 2009 by the Dallas-Fort Worth Chapter 
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[84] The Rangers and Feldman 
agreed to a $2,425,000 one-year contract in January 2010, thereby avoiding 
arbitration.[85] On March 27, manager Ron Washington announced that Feldman 
would be the opening day starter for the Rangers.[86] On April 2, the Rangers 
signed Feldman to a two-year, $11.5 million extension through the 2012 
season, with a $9.25 million option for 2013.[87] Feldman was 7–11 for 
the season, as he started 22 games and pitched seven games out of the bullpen.[88] 
Feldman, had microfracture surgery performed on his right knee during the 
off-season.[89] To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco 
Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. 
On July 8, he was transferred from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day 
disabled list.[90] He was outrighted to the minors on July 13.[91] However, 
on July 14, after he cleared waivers, Feldman rejected the assignment giving 
the Rangers the option of activating him from the disabled list or releasing 
him. They opted to activate him off the disabled list, which re-added him 
to the 40-man roster.[92] In 2011, Feldman was 2–1 with a 3.94 ERA for 
Texas in 11 games, two of which were starts.[93] In 32 innings he gave 
up 25 hits, while walking 10 and striking out 22.[93] He limited left-handed 
hitters to a .155 batting average.[94] Brought in during the first game 
of the playoffs against the Tampa Bay Rays, he pitched three scoreless 
innings, allowing two hits while striking out four.[95] In Game 2 of the 
ALCS he pitched 4 1/3 scoreless innings in relief, allowing the Detroit 
Tigers only one hit and no walks.[96] He became the third pitcher in 20 
years to throw at least four scoreless innings of relief in a postseason 
game.[96] He pitched another scoreless inning in Game 4, and through the 
first two rounds of the postseason his playoff record was 8.2 innings pitched 
with nine strikeouts, three hits, and no walks.[97] In the first game of 
the World Series, he pitched another 1.2 innings of scoreless baseball 
to extend his postseason record to 10.1 scoreless innings pitched.[98] 
Only eight relief pitchers had pitched more scoreless innings in a postseason, 
with Goose Gossage holding the record (14.1 in 1981).[98] His postseason 
record in 2011 was 10.1 innings pitched with 10 strikeouts, 4 hits, and 
0 walks.[99] In 2012, Feldman was 6–11, with a 5.09 ERA in 123.2 innings.[100] 
He had a 96/32 K/BB ratio.[101] He walked one-or-fewer batters in 10-straight 
starts; the only Ranger with a longer single-season streak was Ferguson 
Jenkins with 12-straight starts in 1974.[102] He became a free agent on 
October 30, 2012, when the Rangers declined his $9.25 million 2013 option.[101] 
On November 27, 2012, Feldman signed a one-year deal with the Chicago Cubs 
worth $6 million with a possible $1 million in additional incentives.[103] 
General Manager Jed Hoyer indicated that the team planned to use him as 
a starter.[104] On May 24, 2013, Feldman hit his first career home run 
off of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Bronson Arroyo. On July 2, 2013, Feldman 
and Steve Clevenger were traded to the Baltimore Orioles for pitchers Jake 
Arrieta and Pedro Strop.[105] There, Feldman reunited with his first big 
league manager, Buck Showalter. His first start was on July 3, 2013, against 
the Chicago White Sox, a game the Orioles won 4–2 although Feldman did 
not get the decision. Feldman had his best start as an Oriole August 18, 
and was borderline dominant the entire outing. Through his first six innings, 
Feldman had allowed just two hits, while not allowing a single run to score. 
The Orioles took the victory 7–2 against the Rockies.[106] He improved 
upon that outing by tossing the first complete game shutout of his career 
on September 6, holding the White Sox to 5 hits. He finished the season 
with a combined 12–12 win-loss record and 3.86 ERA in 30 starts that included 
one shutout.[107] He allowed only a .234 opponent's batting average, tied 
for 10th-best in the Major Leagues among righty pitchers, and a .207 average 
with two outs.[102] After falling behind batters 2–0, he held them to a 
.131 average, the lowest in the Major Leagues.[102] Feldman signed a three-year 
contract worth $30 million with the Houston Astros after the 2013 season.[108] 
He was the Astros' opening day starter, and beat the New York Yankees by 
blanking them into the seventh inning.[109] On August 30, 2014, Feldman 
threw a 3-hit shutout against the Texas Rangers, giving up just 1 walk 
while striking 5. Astros went on to win 2–0, winning the Silver Boot for 
the club for the first time since 2006. For the season, he was 8–12 with 
a 3.74 ERA (the lowest over a full season in his career), in 29 starts 
(tied for the club lead).[110] He was tied for sixth in the AL in complete 
games (2).[110] He threw the highest percentage of curveballs among all 
Major League pitchers (28.9%), ahead of Sonny Gray.[110] At 6–7, Feldman 
is the third-tallest pitcher in Astros history behind Randy Johnson (6–10) 
and J. R. Richard (6–8).[110] He received the Astros 2014 Darryl Kile Good 
Guy Award, voted by the Houston Chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America.[110] After a successful 2014 season, Feldman struggled in 2015 
and in 2016, the latter having him sent to the bullpen by the Astros. On 
August 1, 2016, Feldman was traded by the Astros to the Toronto Blue Jays 
for minor league pitcher Guadalupe Chavez.[111] He struggled in 14 appearances 
for Toronto, pitching to a 2–1 record, 8.40 ERA, and 14 strikeouts in 15
