Kenton Charles "Teke" Tekulve (born March 5, 1947 in Cincinnati, Ohio) 
is a former Major League Baseball right-handed relief pitcher. During his 
16 seasons in MLB, he pitched for three teams, but spent most of his career 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Pitching with an unusual submarine delivery, 
he was known as a workhorse relief pitcher who holds several records for 
number of games pitched and innings pitched. Tekulve is a 1969 graduate 
of Marietta College in Ohio. He signed that year as a free agent with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates and remained with that organization until 1985. He made 
his major league debut in 1974. His best seasons came in 1978 and 1979, 
in both of which he saved 31 games and posted ERAs of 2.33 and 2.75, respectively. 
He saved three games in the 1979 World Series including the winner, as 
his Pirates defeated the Baltimore Orioles. He was selected an All-Star 
in 1980. Early in the 1985 season, Tekulve was traded to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for Al Holland and a minor leaguer. He continued to be an effective 
reliever into his 40s. Only in his first season (1974) and his last season 
(1989) did he post an ERA above 4. While with the Phillies, he led the 
NL in games pitched for the fourth time, with 90 in 1987 at the age of 
40. Tekulve signed with the Cincinnati Reds before the 1989 season and 
pitched in 37 games before retiring in July. Tekulve led the major leagues 
in games pitched four times, appearing in 90 or more games three times. 
He and Mike Marshall are the only pitchers in baseball history to appear 
in 90 or more games more than once (each did it three times). Tekulve is 
also the oldest pitcher ever to appear in 90 games, when he did so in 1987 
at age 40. Tekulve's three saves in the 1979 World Series tied the single-Series 
mark set by Roy Face in the 1960 World Series; it was broken by John Wetteland 
in 1996. He holds the National League record for career innings pitched 
in relief (1,436â…”), and formerly held the major league record for career 
relief appearances; his 1,050 career games, all in relief, ranked second 
in major league history to Hoyt Wilhelm's 1,070 when he retired. Tekulve 
owns the career records for most appearances and innings pitched without 
making a single start. In 1986 he broke Roy Face's NL record of 846 career 
games pitched; he held the record until John Franco passed him in 2004. 
In August of 1987, he pitched on nine consecutive days, a record for pitchers.[1] 
Tekulve also holds the record for most career losses without having given 
up any earned runs, with 12, as well as the record for most intentional 
walks issued, with 179. Tekulve was a member of the Philadelphia Phillies 
television broadcast team from 1991 to 1997. After several years involvement 
with the Washington Wild Things of the independent Frontier League, Tekulve 
took a job as the Pittsburgh Pirates' advance scout in 2006. Tekulve currently 
works for Root Sports Pittsburgh (formerly FSN Pittsburgh) and appears 
as an analyst after each Pittsburgh Pirates game. However, in the early 
to mid part of the 2014 Pirates season, he took a hiatus for personal reasons. 
Filling in for him in his absence, former Pirate player and former Oakland 
Athletics manager Ken Macha. Tekulve underwent successful heart transplantation 
surgery on September 5, 2014. Tekulve threw the first pitch at the National 
League Wild Card game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the San Francisco
