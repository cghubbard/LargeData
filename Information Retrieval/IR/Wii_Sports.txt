Wii Sports (Wii スポーツ, Wī Supōtsu?) is a sports game developed and published 
by Nintendo as a launch title for the Wii video game console.[1] The game 
was first released in North America along with the Wii on November 19, 
2006, and was released in Japan, Australia, and Europe the following month. 
It was included as a pack-in game with the Wii console in all territories 
except Japan and South Korea,[2] making it the first game included with 
the launch of a Nintendo system since Mario's Tennis for the Virtual Boy 
in 1995. Wii Sports is now available on its own as part of the Nintendo 
Selects collection of games and is no longer a pack-in game for the Wii. 
The game is a collection of five sports simulations, designed to demonstrate 
the motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote to new players. The five 
sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players 
use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such 
as swinging a tennis racket.[3] The rules for each game are simplified 
to make them more accessible to new players.[2] The game also features 
training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.[4] 
Overall, Wii Sports has been well received by critics and received awards 
from the gaming press and entertainment community. It is the third best-selling 
video game of all time, behind Tetris and Minecraft, and is the best-selling 
game of all time for a single platform as of April 2013, having outsold 
the previous best-seller, Super Mario Bros., also published by Nintendo.[5] 
As of September 30, 2016, 82.79 million copies in total had been sold worldwide.[6] 
Wii Sports has been featured on television in Wii commercials, news reports, 
and other programming.[7][8][9][10] The game has become a popular means 
for social gatherings and competitions among players of varying ages.[8][11][12] 
A sequel, Wii Sports Resort, was released in 2009, featuring Wii MotionPlus 
support, while a high-definition remake, Wii Sports Club, was released 
in 2013 for Wii U. Wii Sports consists of five separate sports games—tennis, 
baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing—accessed from the main menu.[2][13] 
The games use the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk 
attachment to control the actions of the on-screen ball pit. The player 
moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played 
in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf 
club, baseball bat or bowling ball.[3] Some aspects of the gameplay are 
computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the Wii, 
while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball 
consists of batting and pitching, with all of the fielding and baserunning 
handled by the Wii.[13] The in-game characters are taken from the Wii's 
Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii (a customized avatar) 
that can be imported into games that support the feature. Wii Sports is 
the first Wii title to use this feature.[2] Miis saved on the Wii will 
appear in the crowd during bowling games and as members of human-controlled 
teams in baseball. The non-player characters in the game were also created 
using the Mii Channel toolset. Miis created on one Wii can be transferred 
onto the internal memory of a Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different 
save data.[14] After a game, a player is awarded or penalized skill points 
based on performance relative to the computer's skill level, though some 
games do not calculate points during multiplayer sessions. The game keeps 
track of these points by charting them on a graph, as well as increasing 
the size of the crowd in Tennis and Boxing single-player modes. After obtaining 
1000 skill points in a sport, a player is awarded "pro" level, along with 
a cosmetic feature for their Mii in Bowling and Boxing. A Mii newly turned 
pro will receive a message on the Wii Message Board notifying them. Wii 
Sports also features a fitness test that calculates a player's fitness 
age (ranging from 20 to 80 years old, 20 being the best possible). The 
test gauges the player's performance in three randomly chosen challenges 
in each test from the training mode that have been played at least once, 
and can only be taken once a day per Mii. Calculating the fitness age takes 
into account a player's balance, speed, and stamina. Fitness age results 
are graphed over one, two, or three months, with daily results posted on 
the Wii Message Board.[14][15] Katsuya Eguchi, who managed Software Development 
Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, produced Wii 
Sports.[16] With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach people who had not 
played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed 
both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way.[17] 
Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended Wii Sports 
to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this.[18] Wii Sports 
was designed as a simple introductory line meant to offer something for 
both gamers and non-gamers.[19] Sports were chosen as the theme because 
of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional 
athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple 
so that anyone could play. Gameplay like running towards a ball in tennis 
was excluded to maintain simplicity.[16] At one point in development, Mario 
characters were used, but were removed because of feedback from players 
who preferred Miis.[20] The game supports a 16:9 widescreen ratio and progressive 
scan, runs at 60 frames per second,[2] and makes use of the Wii Remote's 
accelerometer to interpret the player's motion.[21] Motion-sensing actions, 
like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as 
possible.[20] Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii 
solely to play Wii Sports, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo 
believed players would be more likely to play Wii Sports through this distribution 
method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its 
popularity by word of mouth.[22] Before the Electronic Entertainment Expo 
(E3) Media and Business Summit of 2006, the first sport in the game was 
announced as Wii Sports: Tennis. It was later announced, at Nintendo's 
press conference prior to E3 2006, it would be part of a sports package.[21] 
Satoru Iwata introduced this package as Wii Sports, and stated it would 
include tennis, golf, and baseball. The game was featured as both a video 
demonstration and an on-stage playable demo. The demo featured Iwata and 
Reggie Fils-Aime in a doubles tennis match against Shigeru Miyamoto and 
Scott Dyer, a contest winner.[17] The other sports titles were on display 
at E3 and shared a similar naming convention to the tennis game such as, 
Wii Sports: Baseball, Wii Sports: Golf, and Wii Sports: Airplane.[23] At 
the time, baseball only featured a batting simulation.[24] The airplane 
title was similar to Pilotwings and required the player to maneuver an 
airplane through rings within a time frame.[23] It was not included in 
the final game, but was later incorporated into Wii Sports Resort.[25] 
At the Nintendo World event on September 14, 2006, Reggie Fils-Aime announced 
that Wii Sports would be included free with the Wii. The bowling and boxing 
titles were also introduced.[26] Wii Sports was immensely successful commercially. 
At the end of 2007, it was the best-selling Wii game.[27] In Japan, where 
the game was not included with the system, the game sold 176,167 copies 
in the first two days of release, a record for a seventh generation console 
game in Japan.[28] By February 2007, it had sold over a million copies.[29][30] 
In early May 2007, game-industry research firm Media Create placed Wii 
Sports third in their list of top-20 games in Japan.[31] It was the best-selling 
game of 2007 in Japan with 1,911,520 copies sold.[32][33] It was the tenth 
best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 841,736 copies in that year.[34] 
The game sold 45.71 million copies—including bundled copies—worldwide by 
March 2009.[35] By January 28, 2011, worldwide sales increased to 75.66 million,[36] 
which has increased to 82.79 million as of September 30, 2016.[6] Wii Sports 
received mostly positive reviews from critics. It received a score of 76% 
on GameRankings[37] and 76/100 on Metacritic.[38] GameTrailers called it 
a good complement to the Wii system and referred to all five games as a 
"nice total package". They commented that the games provided enough gameplay 
for long time gamers without making it inaccessible to novices. GameTrailers 
stated, however, that the lack of a tournament mode was a detractor, and 
did not recommend paying for the game if it did not come bundled with the 
system.[13] GamePro also commented that the free addition of Wii Sports 
with the Wii was a positive.[3] Matt Casamassina of IGN called it a "successful 
showpiece for Nintendo's new hardware" and enjoyed the ability to import 
Miis.[2] GameSpot editor Ryan Davis complimented the multiplayer aspect 
and the fitness test.[44] Reviewers praised the game's controls and ease 
of use. Casamassina referred to the controls as "revolutionary" and described 
them as intuitive.[2] GamePro echoed similar comments, praising the ease 
of play and realistic motion controls, while Davis commented that the motion 
controls were sometimes erratic.[3][44] Common criticism focused on the 
graphics and lack of depth in the separate games. Casamassina stated that 
the game "comes up short in depth and visuals", and called the graphics 
"generic" and "archaic".[2] Other reviewers said the graphics were on par 
with Nintendo's older gaming systems, the Nintendo GameCube and Nintendo 
64.[3][13] Davis criticized the oversimplified nature of the games, and 
GamePro stated that the separate games offered less depth than regular 
console sports games.[3][44] Nintendo Power listed Wii Sports along with 
its sequel Wii Sports Resort as two of the greatest multi-player experiences 
in Nintendo's history, stating that everyone from young children to grandparents 
can enjoy the games. The magazine praised the grouping of sports and the 
game's longevity.[45] The separate games garnered their own reception among 
critics. Casamassina called bowling, tennis, and baseball "fun and addictive", 
while Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer said baseball, golf, and boxing were lacking 
in gameplay depth when compared to tennis and bowling.[2][41] PC Magazine 
columnist John C. Dvorak, an avid bowler, praised the realistic physics 
used in bowling and stated, "Nintendo did a stupendous job of coding." 
He complimented the addition of physical activity to video gaming, but 
complained that long term use caused his wrist and shoulder to become sore.[46] 
Casamassina ranked bowling as the best experience of the five.[2] Before 
its release, IGN's Craig Harris commented on an exploit allowing easy strikes 
in the bowling game that removed the challenge and replay value.[47] After 
the release, he stated that the exploit was not fixed.[26] GameTrailers 
called golf the most in-depth, but criticized the lack of multiple courses 
and unpredictable controls when trying to slice or hook a shot.[13] GamePro 
said golf offered the most content and was the best looking of all the 
games, but commented that its controls were the most difficult to use.[3] 
GameTrailers called tennis the most accessible and easy to play, but criticized 
the difficulty of putting spin on a shot.[13] Casamassina stated that tennis 
was one of the more enjoyable games, but the lack of movement control was 
a detractor.[2] GameTrailers called baseball the most "worthless" because 
of the luck factor associated with the computer-controlled fielding. They 
called boxing the best workout on Wii Sports, but criticized the difficult 
timing needed to punch properly.[13] Casamassina criticized boxing for 
being "like a chore" and ranked it as the worst experience of the five 
sports.[2] Wii Sports's debut at 2006 E3 garnered it several awards. At 
the event, it won the Game Critics Award for "Best Sports Game".[48] 1UP.com 
listed it as the "Best Wii Game" and "Most Original Game" in their "Best 
of E3 2006" feature.[49] Following its release, Wii Sports received multiple 
awards from various organizations, websites, and magazines. IGN awarded 
it "Best Sports Game of 2006" and second best game of 2006.[50][51] Time 
magazine listed the game as the number one game of 2006 in their list of 
"Top 10 Video Games of 2006".[52] Wii Sports won Famitsu's 2006 "Innovation 
Award".[53] Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it "Best Multiplayer Experience" 
in their 2006 "1Up Network Awards".[54] At the 2007 Interactive Achievement 
Awards, Wii Sports won "Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering", 
"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design", and "Outstanding Innovation in 
Gaming".[55][56][57] In 2007, the game won the "Innovation Award" and "Best 
Game Design" at the Game Developers Choice Awards,[58] and won "Grand Prize" 
in the entertainment division of the Japan Media Arts Festival.[59] At 
the 2007 British Academy Video Games Awards, Wii Sports won six out of 
seven award nominations: Sports, Innovation, Gameplay, Multiplayer, Casual, 
and Strategy and Simulation.[60][61] The New York Times named wii sports 
as the Game of the year,[62] also The gaming website Gamasutra said that 
Wii sports was the most important game of 2006.[63] In 2010, the game was 
included as one of the titles in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play 
Before You Die.[64] Wii Sports, a major factor in the Wii's worldwide success,[65] 
was the first release among a number of core Wii games being developed 
at the same time, with the same philosophy; others were released as Wii 
Play, Wii Fit, and Wii Music.[66] A direct sequel to Wii Sports, titled 
Wii Sports Resort, was released in 2009.[67] The game, along with Wii Fit, 
has been credited with attracting more casual, female, and elderly gamers.[68] 
It has also been cited as a game that can provide a bonding experience 
among family members, and as a means of exercising and losing weight when 
played regularly.[69][70] A study involving 13- to 15‑year-old teenagers 
was conducted by the Liverpool John Moores University and concluded that 
players used 2% more energy than by playing on other consoles. They stated 
that it was no substitute for playing a real sport, but could contribute 
to weight management.[71] Wii Sports has been used to aid in the physical 
therapy of a boxer at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Canada, stroke 
victims in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Raleigh, North Carolina, and injured 
soldiers in Prescott, Arizona; Washington, D.C.; and Landstuhl, Germany.[72][73][74][75] 
Wired included the game in its list of "The 15 Most Influential Games of 
the Decade" at #8, for its role in popularizing motion controls and having 
a major impact on the "videogame landscape."[76] After the Wii's release, 
players began incurring injuries while playing Wii Sports, among other 
games, when they accidentally hit other players or objects while swinging 
the Wii Remote.[8] This string of accidents, and others related to players 
throwing the Wii Remote while playing Wii Sports, prompted Nintendo president 
Satoru Iwata to develop a campaign to reduce such incidents.[77] In regard 
to the issue, Nintendo spokesman Yasuhiro Minagawa commented, "People tended 
to get a bit excited, especially while playing Wii Sports, and in some 
cases the remote would come loose from their hands." Nintendo responded 
by offering replacement Wii Remote wrist straps that were almost twice 
as thick.[78] Other injuries include muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries 
from excess playing of simulated sports on the Wii—dubbed "Wii-itis".[79][80] 
Wii Sports has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions. 
Residents at senior centers and retirement homes have formed leagues using 
Wii Sports bowling.[11][81] After its Australian release, Nintendo and 
Myer, an Australian department store chain, held a Wii Sports tennis tournament 
in January 2007 in Melbourne, Australia.[12] The winners competed against 
professional tennis players Pat Cash and Mark Woodforde, and were awarded 
new Wiis.[82] An unofficial Wii Sports tennis tournament titled "Wiimbledon" 
was held in the Brooklyn, New York bar Barcade on June 23, 2007.[83] It 
featured 128 competitors, many of whom were dressed in costumes.[8][84] 
Wii Sports has been featured on television multiple times. The game was 
featured in commercials for the Wii system,[7][85] and in news features 
on ABC and NBC.[8][86][87] The game has appeared on various comedy shows. 
An episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien featured host Conan O'Brien 
competing against his guest, tennis star Serena Williams, in a match of 
Wii Sports tennis.[9] On an episode of the Rick Mercer Report, former Canadian 
prime minister Jean Chrétien beat Rick Mercer in a game of Wii Sports boxing.[10] 
The boxing game also appeared on an episode of The Colbert Report where 
a clip featured Mii versions of Stephen Colbert and Speaker of the House 
Nancy Pelosi boxing.[88] At the 80th Academy Awards Show, host Jon Stewart 
and Jamia Simone Nash were caught playing Wii Sports tennis on one of the 
event's gigantic projection screens after a commercial break as part of 
a joke.[89] Wii Sports has also been featured in mainstream movies such 
as Tropic Thunder and in commercials for products such as Kellogg's Smart 
Start.[90] A sequel, Wii Sports Resort, was first revealed at Nintendo's 
E3 2008 presentation.[91] Development moved forward after the extent of 
the Wii MotionPlus was realized, though the idea for a sequel existed sooner.[92] 
The game was released in Japan on June 25, 2009[93] before releasing in 
other markets in July 2009. On September 18, 2013, Nintendo announced Wii 
Sports Club for the Wii U Nintendo eShop. The game features the five games 
of Wii Sports remade in high-definition graphics, with support for the 
Wii MotionPlus (similar to Wii Sports Resort) and online multiplayer. The 
game uses a 'Club' system, in which players are registered to regional 
or national clubs, communicating with each other via Miiverse, and compete 
against other clubs for rankings. After a 24-hour free trial period, players 
can purchase a day pass to access all of the games, or purchase full access 
to the individual games. Tennis and Bowling was released on November 7,
