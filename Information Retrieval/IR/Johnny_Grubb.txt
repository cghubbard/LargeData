John Maywood Grubb, Jr. (born August 4, 1948 in Richmond, Virginia) is 
a former Major League Baseball outfielder and designated hitter, who also 
occasionally played at first base. He played with the San Diego Padres 
(1972–1976), Cleveland Indians (1977–1978), Texas Rangers (1978–1982), 
and the Detroit Tigers (1983–1987). Grubb was drafted by the San Diego 
Padres in 1971 with the 24th pick in the first round. He had been previously 
drafted by the Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, and Atlanta Braves, but 
did not sign with them.[1] He made his major league debut on September 
10, 1972. In his 1973 rookie season, Grubb put up good numbers and earned 
himself a starting position in the outfield by hitting .311 with eight 
home runs, 37 RBI, and 52 runs scored. Grubb made the 1974 National League 
All-star team during his sophomore season, and struck out in his only at-bat. 
Highlights after the 1974 season included a 21-game hitting streak in 1979 
while a member of the Texas Rangers. He was also a member of the Detroit 
Tigers' 1984 World Series Championship team; the Tigers defeated his former 
team the San Diego Padres 4 games to 1.[1] In his 16-year career, he posted 
a .278 batting average with 99 home runs, 475 RBI, and 553 runs scored. 
In the era since the designated hitter came into play (1973), he is the 
all-time leader among American League players when used as a pinch hitter 
batting for the #9 hitter in the line-up.[citation needed] He was released 
by the Detroit Tigers after a disappointing 1987 season, despite having 
arguably the best season of his career in 1986.[1] Since retiring from 
professional baseball, Grubb has kept a low profile. He is the former varsity 
baseball coach at his alma mater, Meadowbrook High School in Richmond. 
There he coached former San Diego Padres pitcher Cla Meredith.[1] Grubb 
and his wife are also active members of the Christian Church (Disciples
