Samuel Jones (December 14, 1925 – November 5, 1971), known during his career 
as "Toothpick Sam" Jones or "Sad Sam" Jones,[1] was a Major League Baseball 
pitcher who played from 1951 to 1964. Born in Stewartsville, Ohio, Jones 
began his major league career with the Cleveland Indians in 1951. When 
he entered a game on May 3, 1952, 39-year-old rookie Quincy Trouppe, a 
Negro League veteran, was behind the plate. Together they formed the first 
black battery in American League history. Both Sam Jones and Quincy Trouppe 
played for the Cleveland Buckeyes in the Negro League After the 1954 season, 
the Tribe traded him to the Chicago Cubs for two players to be named later, 
one of who was slugger Ralph Kiner. In 1956, the Cubs traded him to the 
St. Louis Cardinals in a multi-player deal; prior to the 1959 season, he 
was dealt this time to the San Francisco Giants for Bill White and Ray 
Jablonski. He was picked 25th by the expansion Houston Colt .45s in the 
1961 expansion draft, then traded to the Detroit Tigers for Bob Bruce and 
Manny Montejo. He rejoined the Cardinals for the 1963 campaign and played 
1964 with the Baltimore Orioles. He spent the final three years of his 
pro career as a relief pitcher with the Columbus Jets of the International 
League before retiring at the end of the 1967 season. During his career, 
Jones was known for his sweeping curveball, in addition to a fastball and 
changeup. Stan Musial once remarked, "Sam had the best curveball I ever 
saw... He was quick and fast and that curve was terrific, so big it was 
like a change of pace. I've seen guys fall down on curves that became strikes." 
[2] During his career, Jones led the National League in strikeouts, and 
walks, three times: in 1955, 1956, and 1958. On May 12 of the former of 
these three seasons, he no-hit the Pittsburgh Pirates 4-0 at Wrigley Field, 
becoming the first African American in Major League history to pitch a 
no-hitter. He achieved this no-hitter in the hardest way: after walking 
Gene Freese, Preston Ward (who was pinch-run for by Román Mejías) and Tom 
Saffell to begin the ninth inning, he left the bases loaded by striking 
out Dick Groat, Roberto Clemente and Frank Thomas in succession. His greatest 
year came with the Giants in 1959, when he led the league in both wins 
with 21 (tying him with Milwaukee Braves starters Lew Burdette and Warren 
Spahn) and ERA with 2.83. He was named 1959 National League Pitcher of 
the Year by The Sporting News, but finished a distant second to Early Wynn 
of the Chicago White Sox for the Cy Young Award. He was named to the NL 
All-Star team twice, in 1955 and 1959. Jones died from a recurrence of 
neck cancer first diagnosed in 1962, in Morgantown, West Virginia at the
