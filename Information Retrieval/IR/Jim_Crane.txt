James Robert "Jim" Crane is a businessman from Houston, Texas. Crane is 
chairman and chief executive of Crane Capital Group, the majority shareholder 
of Champion Energy, Crane Worldwide Logistics, and Crane Freight & Shipping. 
He is also the owner and chairman of the MLB team Houston Astros [1] Crane, 
who grew up in the north St. Louis suburb of Dellwood, Missouri, attended 
Lutheran High School North and graduated from there in 1972.[2] He gave 
the school a donation of USD$1 million to improve their athletic facilities 
and enlarge the size of the campus from 40 acres to 67 in 2004.[2][3] The 
school named the James R. Crane Athletic Complex for his contribution.[4] 
Crane earned a degree in industrial safety from Central Missouri State 
University[5] (now University of Central Missouri) in 1976, where he became 
a member of the fraternity, Tau Kappa Epsilon. He pitched for the Central 
Missouri Mules baseball team.[6] Crane's father died between his freshman 
and sophomore years and he seriously thought about dropping out of college, 
but his coach Robert N. Tompkins drove to his home in north St. Louis and 
talked Crane into returning to school.[7] In 1998 Crane was the largest 
donor in a USD$1.2 million upgrade of the CMSU baseball stadium, which 
was then named James R. Crane Stadium.[8] After graduating from college 
he followed his father and went into the insurance business. He moved to 
Houston in 1980, and in March 1984 Crane borrowed USD$10,000 from his sister 
and founded Eagle USA Airfreight, an air freight logistics business.[7][9] 
In 2000, Eagle USA was subject of an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
investigation regarding hiring practices of minorities and women.[10] Eagle 
USA Airfreight later became Eagle Global Logistics, and then EGL, Inc., 
and moved into the supply chain management and information services business. 
In August 2007 EGL merged with United Kingdom-based CEVA Logistics, owned 
by American private equity capital management and leveraged buyout firm 
Apollo Management L.P.. Crane owned approximately 17.6% of EGL's stock 
at the time of the merger. He had wanted to do a leveraged, management, 
or combination of the two, buyout of EGL, prior to the merger with CEVA, 
but was unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Later, after he 
obtained equity backing he initially offered $36 per-share for EGL, but 
Apollo then engaged in a bidding war and the shareholders eventually went 
with the Apollo/CEVA offer of $47.50 per share. He was opposed to the EGL 
and CEVA merger.[11] Crane took his profits from EGL and formed Crane Capital 
Group. He also became a director and shareholder (less than 1%) in Western 
Gas Holdings, LLC, the general partner in Western Gas Partners, LP, a mid-stream 
(mainly pipelines and natural gas gathering assets) energy company operating 
in the southeastern Rocky Mountain region and southern Mid-Continent area 
(Oklahoma and Texas) of the United States. Western Gas Holdings and Western 
Gas Partners are majority owned by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation.[9] Crane 
is also the majority shareholder in Crane Worldwide Logistics LLC.,[5] 
director of Fort Dearborn Life Insurance Company (a subsidiary of Health 
Care Service Corporation),[5] and a director and executive officer in Champion 
Energy Holdings LLC. A scratch golfer, Crane has been ranked as the nation's 
top CEO golfer. In April 2010 he purchased The Floridian National Golf 
Club from H. Wayne Huizenga. The Floridian in Palm City, Florida recently 
completed major renovations and additions under the supervision of noted 
architect Tom Fazio. Crane reached an agreement to purchase the Houston 
Astros of Major League Baseball from Drayton McLane for a reported $680 
million.[12] He was unanimously approved by MLB on November 17, 2011 after 
being forced to move to the American League in 2013.[13] "It was two things 
(owning a team and golf course) that I never thought I would be able to 
accomplish," he said. "I was able to pull it together and I am very happy 
about it." Crane and his ex-wife, Franci Neely Crane, are financial supporters 
of The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.[14][15][16][17][18] For her 60th birthday 
party Franci was serenaded by the rock-pop band The B-52's at the Crane's
