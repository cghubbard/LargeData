The 1974 Detroit Tigers compiled a record of 72-90. They finished in last 
place in the American League East, 19 games behind the Baltimore Orioles. 
They were outscored by their opponents 768 to 620. 1974 was Al Kaline's 
final season after 22 years as a Tiger (1953–1974). He became the 12th 
player to join the 3,000 hit club on September 24. On September 7, the 
Yankees' Graig Nettles hit a home run against the Tigers. The next time 
up, he hit a broken-bat single. Tigers catcher Bill Freehan scrambled for 
the six superballs that came bouncing out. Nettles was called out on the 
single, but his solo homer was allowed and the made all the difference 
as the Yankees won 1-0.[4] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
