The Pittsburg Diamonds are an independent professional baseball team based 
in Pittsburg, California. They began play as a member of the Pacific Association 
of Professional Baseball Clubs in 2005. They replaced the East Bay Lumberjacks 
as a member of the Association. The team was named the Pittsburg Mettle

for the Diamonds- -In 2006 the Diamonds had four players who were selected 
to play in the Western Independent Leagues All Star Game and faced the 
Arizona based leagues Desert Association Leagues selected teams players. 
The four Pittsburg players selected by the PAL All Star players and manager 
votes were the most of any other Pacific Association Leagues ball clubs 
in any previous years and still to this day. The four Diamond selections 
included two staring pitchers, their slick fielding shortstop, and second 
baseman to fill the middle of the infield all four players sent to Chico 
were either starting the All Star Game or closing it out. Starting pitcher 
Greg Burke tossed two perfect innings to begin the bottom of the first 
inning shortstop Jeffery Rosel had two at bats going one for two but the 
one hit was a three to home run in the top of the third inning second baseman 
Allen Humphrey went hitless in two at bats. The score heading to the final 
frame of the ninth was five to four PAL with the lead. Starting pitcher 
Matt Kuhn was brought in for a relief role and as the closer with a one 
run lead for an All Star Game save and a win for PA and especially to represent 
the Pittsburg Diamonds with a very solid showing from three of their four 
All Stars, with two out and no base runners Kuhn struck out the last DAL 
All Star batter for the win and the save. Pitchers Designated hitters Catchers
