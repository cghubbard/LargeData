Patrick Lance Borders (born May 14, 1963) is an American former Major League 
Baseball catcher and current manager of the Williamsport Crosscutters. 
He was the Most Valuable Player of the 1992 World Series as a member of 
the Toronto Blue Jays. Borders also won an Olympic gold medal with the 
United States baseball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Borders 
was born in Columbus, Ohio, but spent the majority of his childhood in 
Lake Wales, Florida.[1] He attended Lake Wales High School and was a standout 
in both football and baseball. He batted .440 as a junior, and as a senior 
he batted .510 with a school single season record 10 home runs and 36 RBI. 
Although he was offered a football/baseball scholarship to Mississippi 
State University, he turned it down to sign with the Blue Jays, who had 
drafted him in the sixth round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. 
Borders was brought up in the Toronto Blue Jays system and made his major 
league debut in 1988, playing in 56 games. Initially playing first and 
third base, he was converted to a catcher as his defense was deemed not 
strong enough to keep him in the majors. Over the next few seasons, he 
earned the full-time position behind the plate, and he was a cornerpiece 
of the 1992 and 1993 World Series champion teams. In the 1992 Series, he 
hit .450 with one home run en route to winning the World Series MVP award. 
On September 2, 1990, while with the Blue Jays, Borders caught Dave Stieb's 
no-hitter—the only one in franchise history to date.[2] Borders left the 
Jays as a free agent after the 1994 season, but never found a permanent 
home like Toronto had been for him in his seven years there. Over the following 
decade he played for the Kansas City Royals (1995), Houston Astros (1995), 
St. Louis Cardinals (1996), California Angels (1996), Chicago White Sox 
(1996), Cleveland Indians (1997-1999), returned to Toronto in 1999, Seattle 
Mariners (2001-2004), Minnesota Twins (2004), and again with the Mariners 
(2005), never playing in more than 55 games for any one team during a season. 
Borders was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers to a minor league contract 
after the 2004 season. On May 19, 2005, he was acquired by Seattle from 
the Brewers for cash considerations and was assigned to Triple-A Tacoma 
of the Pacific Coast League. With Seattle's primary catcher Miguel Olivo 
struggling, and losing backup catcher Dan Wilson to an injury, Borders 
became Seattle's primary catcher for most of the first half of the 2005 
season. Seattle designated him for assignment shortly after the All-Star 
Break to make room for some younger prospects. During his time in Triple-A 
Tacoma for the Mariners, Borders stated that he would rather remain in 
Triple-A, because he was closer to his family, enjoyed the lifestyle, and 
had enough money. On January 25, 2006, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Borders 
to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training. On May 27, 
he announced his retirement.[3] Borders finished his career with a .253 
batting average, 69 home runs, and 346 run batted in in 1,099 games. Borders 
is one of only four players to have won both a World Series championship 
and an Olympic gold medal, along with Doug Mientkiewicz and Cuban players 
Orlando Hernandez and Jose Contreras. On August 7, 2009, Borders - along 
with many of his 1992 and 1993 World Series Toronto Blue Jay alumni - attended 
a reunion/pre-game ceremony at the Rogers Centre (formerly known as Skydome). 
Borders also received the honour of catching the ceremonial first pitch 
from then Blue Jays manager (and fellow 1992/93 World Series alumnus) Cito 
Gaston before the Toronto Blue Jays played host to the Baltimore Orioles.[4] 
In June 2015, Borders begins his first season as manager of the Williamsport 
Crosscutters, the Philadelphia Phillies’ short-season single A affiliate.[5]
