As player As manager Thomas Francis Michael "Tommy" McCarthy (July 24, 
1863 â€“ August 5, 1922) was a Major League Baseball player. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. McCarthy was born on July 24, 1863 
in Boston, Massachusetts, the eldest son of Daniel and Sarah McCarthy.[1] 
McCarthy joined the Boston Reds in the Union Association in 1884 as a starting 
pitcher and outfielder. In limited innings and at-bats, he played poorly, 
batting at a paltry .215 average, and lost all seven of his pitching appearances. 
McCarthy moved to the National League and played with the Boston Beaneaters 
the following season and the Philadelphia Quakers the following two years 
but failed to bat higher than .200 in any season, although in limited at-bats. 
Setting aside aspirations of being a star pitcher, McCarthy finally settled 
into an everyday position in a lineup in 1888 with the St. Louis Browns 
in the American Association. With the Browns until 1891, McCarthy scored 
over 100 runs each season and grew increasingly productive at the plate. 
He batted .350 in 1890 and drove in 95 runs in 1891. Although the shoddy 
record-keeping of the time prevents an accurate tally, he also asserted 
himself as a daring presence on the base-paths, by some accounts stealing 
over 100 bases in 1888 and approaching the mark in 1890. McCarthy moved 
back to the National League to play for the Boston Beaneaters in 1892 and 
enjoyed his most productive seasons over the next few years. In 1893 he 
drove in over 100 runs for the first time in his career, a feat that he 
repeated in 1894 while hitting 13 home runs. The press of the day called 
McCarthy and teammate Hugh Duffy the "Heavenly Twins". Their Boston team 
was one of the most successful clubs of the era. McCarthy played for the 
Brooklyn Bridegrooms in 1896 before retiring. He finished his career with 
a .292 batting average, 44 home runs and roughly 500 stolen bases. McCarthy's 
selection into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 has always been a controversial 
one due to his less than spectacular statistics, especially when compared 
to those of his fellow inductees and some players who have not yet been 
honored. In his Historical Baseball Abstract, Sabermetrician Bill James 
makes the point that McCarthy was held in such high esteem because of his 
introduction of the "hit and run" play into the game. This play, among 
other novel strategies (such as batter to baserunner signals, etc.) that 
he and his Boston teammates utilized, were a clever and gentlemanly counter 
to the rough and tumble "Baltimore" style of play which was, at the time, 
giving baseball a bad name. Nevertheless, in the same book, James also
