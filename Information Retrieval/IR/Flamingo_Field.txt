Flamingo Field was a ballpark at the corner of 15th Street and Michigan 
Avenue[1] in Miami Beach, Florida home to Miami Beach minor-league clubs 
and the spring training home of the New York Giants in 1934 and 1935, the 
Philadelphia Phillies from 1940 to 1942, and again in 1946, and the Pittsburgh 
Pirates in 1947. Capacity was approximately 3,000 for baseball. The center 
field fence was 386 feet from homeplate.[2] The park was also referred 
to as "Flamingo Park" which is also the name of the area in which it was 
located. Flamingo Field was home to the Class D Florida East Coast League 
Miami Tigers in 1940, who changed their nickname to the Miami Beach Flamingos 
in 1941 and won the League championship that year. The FECL folded in May 
1942 due to World War II. After the War, the Flamingos joined the new Class 
C Florida International League in 1946. The Flamingos played the 1952 season, 
sat-out 1953, and rejoined in 1954 only to move across Biscayne Bay to 
Miami during the 1954 season. In addition to baseball, the field was used 
for multiple purposes. Duquesne practiced at Flamingo Field in December 
1936 prior to the 1937 Orange Bowl.[3] The Georgia Bulldogs football team 
practiced at Flamingo Field in December 1941 prior to the 1942 Orange Bowl[4] 
in which they defeated TCU. When the Phillies held spring training at the 
ballpark in 1942, box seats cost $1.65, the grandstand was $1.10, and bleacher 
seats $0.55.[5] In 1956, the field was rundown but was being used by the 
Miami Beach and St. Patrick's high school baseball teams. In 1967, the 
City of Miami Beach constructed a new ballpark on the site of the old Flamingo 
Park. The new park sat 535 and did not have locker-rooms which was sufficient 
for recreation and amateur baseball but would prevent the park from attracting 
major league clubs.[6] In September 1968, there was talk of the expansion 
Montreal Expos conducting spring training at Flamingo Park if other options 
did not work out for the club.[7] In November 1968, the New York Mets considered 
training at Flamingo Park in 1969 despite the size. The idea was vetoed 
by the Miami Beach Director of Parks and Recreation who wanted to reserve 
the field for local use.[8] This structure and the field remain today.
