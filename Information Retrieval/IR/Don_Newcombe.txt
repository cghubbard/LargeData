Donald Newcombe (born June 14, 1926), nicknamed Newk, is an American former 
Major League Baseball right-handed starting pitcher who played for the 
Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers (1949–51 and 1954–58), Cincinnati Reds (1958–60) 
and Cleveland Indians (1960). Until 2011 when Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin 
Verlander accomplished the feat, Newcombe was the only baseball player 
to have won the Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player and Cy Young awards 
in his career. In 1949, he became the first black pitcher to start a World 
Series game. In 1951, Newcombe was the first black pitcher to win twenty 
games in one season.[1] In 1956, the inaugural year of the Cy Young Award, 
he became the first pitcher to win the National League MVP and the Cy Young 
in the same season.[2] Newcombe compiled a career batting average of .271 
with 15 home runs and was used as a pinch hitter, a rarity for pitchers. 
Newcombe was born in Madison, New Jersey, and was raised in Elizabeth where 
he attended Jefferson High School.[3][4] After playing one season with 
the Newark Eagles in the Negro Leagues, Newcombe signed with the Dodgers. 
With catcher Roy Campanella, Newcombe played for the first racially integrated 
baseball team based in the United States in the 20th century, the 1946 
Nashua Dodgers of the New England League. He continued to play for Nashua 
in 1947 before moving up through the minor leagues. He debuted for Brooklyn 
on May 20, 1949. Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, agreed to 
let the Dodgers' Branch Rickey sign Newcombe to a contract. Manley was 
not compensated for the release of Newcombe.[5]:p.288 He immediately helped 
the Dodgers to the league pennant as he earned seventeen victories, led 
the league in shutouts, and pitched 32 consecutive scoreless innings. He 
was also among the first four black players to be named to an All-Star 
team, along with teammates Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella and the Indians' 
Larry Doby. Newcombe was named Rookie of the Year by both The Sporting 
News and the Baseball Writers' Association of America. In 1950, he won 
19 games, and 20 the following season, also leading the league in strikeouts 
in 1951. In the memorable playoff game between the Dodgers and the Giants 
at the end of the 1951 season, Newcombe was relieved by Ralph Branca in 
the bottom of the ninth inning before Branca surrendered the walk-off home 
run to Bobby Thomson. After two years of military duty during the Korean 
War, Newcombe suffered a disappointing season in 1954, going 9–8 with a 
4.55 earned run average, but returned to form the next year by finishing 
second in the NL in both wins and earned run average, with marks of 20–5 
and 3.20, as the Dodgers won their first World Series in franchise history. 
He had an even greater 1956 season, with marks of 27–7, 139 strikeouts, 
and a 3.06 ERA, five shutouts and 18 complete games, leading the league 
in winning percentage for the second year in a row. He was named the National 
League's MVP, and was awarded the first-ever Cy Young Award, then given 
to the best pitcher in the combined major leagues. Following the Dodgers' 
move to Los Angeles, Newcombe got off to an 0–6 start in 1958 before being 
traded to the Reds for four players in midseason. He posted a record of 
24–21 with Cincinnati until his contract was sold to Cleveland in mid-1960. 
He finished with a 2–3 mark in Cleveland before being released to end his 
major league career. Newcombe acknowledges that alcoholism played a significant 
role in the decline of his career.[citation needed] In his ten-year major 
league career, Newcombe registered a record of 149–90, with 1129 strikeouts 
and a 3.56 ERA, 136 complete games and 24 shutouts in 2154 innings pitched. 
In addition to his pitching abilities, Newcombe was a dangerous hitter, 
hitting seven homers one season. He batted .271 (ninth-best average in 
history among pitchers), with 15 home runs, 108 runs batted in, 238 hits, 
33 doubles, 3 triples, 94 runs scored and 8 stolen bases. On May 28, 1962, 
Newcombe signed with the Chunichi Dragons of Japan's Nippon Professional 
Baseball. Doby would join him the same year. Newcombe played one season 
in Japan, splitting time as an outfielder and a first baseman, only pitching 
in one game. In 81 games, he hit .262 with 12 home runs and 43 RBI.[6] 
Newcombe rejoined the Dodger organization in the late 1970s and served 
as the team's Director of Community Affairs. In March 2009 he was named 
special adviser to the chairman of the team.[7] Newcombe has maintained 
sobriety since 1967. In his personal and professional life, he has helped 
numerous other people including military personnel via USO in their own 
battles against substance abuse. I'm standing here with the man (Newcombe) 
who saved my life. He was a channel for God's love for me because he chased 
me all over Los Angeles trying to help me and I just couldn't understand 
that — but he persevered — he wouldn't give in and my life is wonderful 
today because of Don Newcombe. What I have done after my baseball career 
and being able to help people with their lives and getting their lives 
back on track and they become human beings again — means more to me than 
all the things I did in baseball. At a fundraising event for Senator Barbara 
Boxer, President Barack Obama referred to Newcombe (who was attending the 
event) as "someone who helped... America become what it is.[8] I would 
not be here if it were not for Jackie and it were not for Don Newcombe.
