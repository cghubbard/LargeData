As player As manager As coach Vernon Adair Benson (September 19, 1924 – 
January 20, 2014) was an infielder/outfielder, coach, scout and interim 
manager in American Major League Baseball. During his playing career, he 
stood 5'11" (180 cm) tall, weighed 180 pounds (82 kg), batted left-handed, 
and threw right-handed. Born in Granite Quarry, North Carolina, Benson 
attended Catawba College in nearby Salisbury. He debuted in the Majors 
with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1943 and had a second trial with the 
Mackmen in 1946, but most of his career would be spent in the organization 
of the St. Louis Cardinals. While he appeared in only 46 games for St. 
Louis between 1951–53, he was a fixture with the Cards' Rochester Red Wings 
and Columbus Red Birds Triple-A farm clubs as a player. Overall, Benson 
batted .202 in 104 MLB at bats over five seasons, with three home runs 
and 12 runs batted in. In his finest minor league season, 1951 at Columbus, 
he batted .308 with 18 home runs and 89 RBI. He became a manager in the 
Redbird system in 1956 with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Class C Northern 
League. On July 6, 1961, he was promoted from manager of the Triple-A Portland 
Beavers to the Cardinals to serve as a Major League coach under new skipper 
Johnny Keane. Benson worked with Keane through the Cards' 1964 World Championship, 
then moved to the New York Yankees when Keane switched to the Bombers (his 
1964 World Series opponent) in 1965. But the Yankees were in a downward 
spiral at the time, finishing sixth in the '65 American League race. Then 
they won only four of their first 20 games in 1966, resulting in Keane's 
firing and Benson's resignation on May 7. Two months later, on July 13, 
1966, Benson returned to the National League as a coach for fellow North 
Carolinian Dave Bristol, newly appointed pilot of the Cincinnati Reds. 
He spent the remainder of his MLB career in the Senior Circuit, as a coach 
for the Reds (through 1969), the Cardinals again (1970 through 1975), Atlanta 
Braves (1976–77), and San Francisco Giants (1980), working in the latter 
two posts under Bristol once again. He managed the Syracuse Chiefs, Triple-A 
affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, in 1978–79. He won three playoff championships 
in the minor leagues, in: the Northern League (with Winnipeg) in 1957; 
the Texas League (with Tulsa) in 1960; and the International League (with 
Syracuse) in 1979. After his on-field career ended, Benson returned to 
the Cardinals as a scout. He also managed the Braves for one game in 1977 
under unusual circumstances. After the club lost 21 of its first 29 games, 
Dave Bristol was sent on a "scouting trip" and replaced by the team's owner, 
Ted Turner, a world-class yachtsman and television executive who had no 
baseball experience. After Turner lost his only game as the team's skipper, 
National League president Chub Feeney told Turner that managers cannot 
own financial interest in a club. When Turner's appeal to Commissioner 
Bowie Kuhn was turned down, Benson stepped in for one game—which he won—before 
Bristol was rehired for the remainder of the season. Benson died on January
