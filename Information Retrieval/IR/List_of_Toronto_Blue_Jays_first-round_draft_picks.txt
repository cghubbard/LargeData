The Toronto Blue Jays are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They play in the American League East division. 
Since the Blue Jays' entrance into the league in 1977, the Blue Jays have 
selected 63 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year 
Player Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning 
amateur players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to 
its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's 
standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first 
pick.[1] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season 
may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] The First-Year Player 
Draft is unrelated to the 1976 expansion draft in which the Blue Jays initially 
filled their roster. Of the 63 players picked in the first round by Toronto, 
29 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 21 of them were right-handed, 
while 8 were left-handed. 13 shortstops, 12 outfielders, four third basemen, 
and three catchers and first basemen were also taken. The team has never 
drafted a player at second base.[3] 14 of the players came from high schools 
or universities in the state of California, and Texas follow with six players.[3] 
They have also drafted two players from Puerto Rico: Alex Ríos (1999) and 
Miguel Negrón (2000).[3] Ed Sprague, Jr. (1988), who was with the franchise 
when they won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, is the only pick to win 
a championship with the team.[4] None of the Blue Jays' first-round picks 
have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and no picks have won the 
MLB Rookie of the Year award, though Shawn Green (1991) and Alex Ríos (1999) 
finished fifth in the voting in 1995 and 2004, respectively.[5][6] Roy 
Halladay (1995) is the only first-round pick of the Blue Jays to earn a 
Cy Young Award with the team, winning in 2003.[7] Jay Schroeder (1979) 
was drafted as a catcher, but ended up becoming a quarterback for ten years 
in the National Football League.[8] The Blue Jays have made 23 selections 
in the supplemental round of the draft and 30 compensatory picks since 
their entry into the league in 1977.[3] These additional picks are provided 
when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][9][V] 
or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous 
year.[10] The Blue Jays have failed to sign two of their first-round picks, 
James Paxton (2009), who opted to return to the University of Kentucky, 
and Tyler Beede (2011).[11] The Blue Jays received the 38th pick in 2010
