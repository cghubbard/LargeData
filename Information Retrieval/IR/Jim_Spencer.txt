James Lloyd Spencer (July 30, 1946 â€“ February 10, 2002) was a Major League 
Baseball first baseman. Born in Hanover, Pennsylvania, the left-handed 
Spencer was recognized for his excellent fielding ability, but also served 
in later years as a designated hitter. Spencer was drafted by the California 
Angels in the first round (11 overall) of the 1965 Major League Baseball 
Draft upon graduation from Andover High School in Linthicum, Maryland. 
After batting .292 with 28 home runs and 96 runs batted in for the El Paso 
Sun Kings in 1968, Spencer earned a September call-up to the Angels. In 
nineteen games, he batted .191 with no home runs and five RBIs. Spencer 
began the 1969 season assigned to the Hawaii Islanders, but with former 
All-Star Dick Stuart not panning out at first base, he was back with the 
Angels by May. In just his second start of the season, he went four-for-five 
against the Baltimore Orioles.[1] For the season, he batted .254 with ten 
home runs and 31 RBIs. While Spencer's offensive numbers improved in 1970, 
his fielding improved more-so, as he led the American League with 1212 
put-outs at first and a .995 fielding percentage to win the Gold Glove 
award. Injuries limited Spencer to 82 games in 1972. A month into the 1973 
season, Spencer was traded to the Texas Rangers with Lloyd Allen for Mike 
Epstein, Rich Hand and Rick Stelmaszek. Spencer was batting .300 for the 
Rangers when he was named to the AL All-Star team. He had one at-bat in 
the game, and flew out to left field.[2] Despite the fact that Spencer 
committed just one error in 1973 and one in 1974, he began seeing more 
time at DH with Mike Hargrove assuming most of the first base duties. He 
regained the first base job in 1975 with Hargrove shifting to left field, 
but after the season, he was dealt back to the Angels for Bill Singer in 
order to allow Hargrove to shift back to his natural position. A day after 
acquiring him, the Angels traded Spencer and Morris Nettles to the Chicago 
White Sox for Steve Dunning and Bill Melton. In 1976, Spencer had career 
highs in hits (131), RBIs (70) and stolen bases (6). He played 143 games, 
and only had 2 errors throughout the season, turning 116 double plays, 
good for a .998 fielding percentage. On May 14, 1977, Spencer enjoyed a 
two home run, eight RBI game against the Cleveland Indians.[3] He followed 
that up with a second two home run, eight RBI game on July 2 against the 
Minnesota Twins.[4] For the season, he batted .247 with eighteen home runs 
and 69 RBIs, and won his second career Gold Glove. Following the season, 
he was traded with minor leaguers Bob Polinsky and Tommy Cruz to the New 
York Yankees for Stan Thomas and minor leaguer Ed Ricks. While backing 
up Chris Chambliss at first base, Spencer saw most of his playing time 
at DH in New York. He reached the post-season for the first time in his 
career in 1978. He did not appear in the 1978 American League Championship 
Series against the Kansas City Royals,[5] however, he appeared in four 
of the six games of the World Series, and had two hits in twelve at-bats.[6] 
Spencer's career high in home runs (23) came in 1979 with the Yankees, 
in a year that he only got 295 at-bats. He only had 85 hits on the season, 
41 of which were for extra bases, giving his a .593 slugging percentage. 
Perhaps his most memorable at-bat of the season occurred on July 13 against 
Nolan Ryan. Ryan had a no-hitter going when Spencer hit a drive to centerfield 
in the eighth inning. Centerfielder Rick Miller made a diving attempt at 
the ball, but could not handle it. The official scorer ruled it an error.[7] 
Reggie Jackson officially ended Ryan's no-hit bid in the ninth. During 
Spring training 1981, Spencer was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Jason 
Thompson, however the trade was nixed by Commissioner Bowie Kuhn.[8] On 
May 20, he and pitcher Tom Underwood were dealt to the Oakland Athletics 
for Mike Patterson, Dave Revering and minor leaguer Chuck Dougherty. Spencer 
batted only .191 while in Oakland, and was released early in the 1982 season. 
In 1973, Spencer had a .999 fielding percentage with only one error in 
the 125 games he played at first base. The next year, he had only 1 error 
in 60 games at first base, a .998 fielding percentage. On February 10, 
2002, Spencer died of a heart attack in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The night 
before his death, Spencer played first base in a charity baseball game 
benefiting the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital in Hollywood, Florida.[9]
