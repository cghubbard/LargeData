The Inter-American League was a high-level circuit in Minor league baseball 
that lasted only three months before folding during the 1979 season. The 
league was conceived both as an official Triple-A minor league circuit 
and member of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. 
It was composed of six clubs unaffiliated with Major League Baseball farm 
systems. The Inter-American loop was headed by Roberto Maduro, former owner 
of the Triple-A Havana Sugar Kings and a longtime scout and front-office 
executive active in Latin American countries and Major League Baseball. 
A 130-game regular season was planned, while the six teams were located 
in the United States (2), Panama, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and 
Venezuela. The league featured several well-known MLB veterans, with rosters 
averaging players between 26-29 years of age.[1] But the new circuit was 
barely able to complete half its schedule, fatally wounded by "under-capitalized 
owners, internecine rivalries among Caribbean baseball powers, tropical 
monsoons, and unreliable air travel."[2] On June 17, 1979, the Panama and 
Puerto Rico teams disbanded, leaving the league with only four clubs. Thirteen 
days later, the entire league folded. The Miami Amigos, led by future Major 
League manager Davey Johnson, were in first place with a 51â€“21 mark (.708)
