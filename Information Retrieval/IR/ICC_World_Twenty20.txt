The ICC World Twenty20 (also referred to as the World T20, and colloquially 
as the T20 World Cup) is the international championship of Twenty20 cricket. 
Organised by cricket's governing body, the International Cricket Council 
(ICC), the tournament currently consists of 16 teams, comprising all ten 
ICC full members and six other associate or affiliate members chosen through 
the World Twenty20 Qualifier. All matches played are accorded Twenty20 
International status. The event has generally been held every two years. 
Originally there was going to be a four-year gap from the conclusion of 
the 2016 tournament to the next scheduled competition in Australia. However, 
in May 2016, the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018, 
with South Africa being the possible host.[3] The ICC are scheudled to 
make a decision on the 2018 tournament in October 2016.[4] Six tournaments 
have so far been played, and only the West Indies, who currently hold the 
title, has won the tournament on multiple occasions. The inaugural event, 
the 2007 World Twenty20, was staged in South Africa, and won by India, 
who defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. 
The 2009 tournament took place in England, and was won by the previous 
runner-up, Pakistan, who defeated Sri Lanka in the final at Lord's. The 
third tournament was held in 2010, hosted by the countries making up the 
West Indies cricket team. England defeated Australia in the final in Barbados, 
which was played at Kensington Oval. The fourth tournament, the 2012 World 
Twenty20, was held in Asia for the first time, with all matches played 
in Sri Lanka. The West Indies won the tournament by defeating Sri Lanka 
in the final, winning its first international tournament since the 2004 
Champions Trophy.[5] The fifth tournament, the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, 
was hosted by Bangladesh, and was won by Sri Lanka, who became the first 
team to play in three finals. West Indies are the current World T20I holders, 
beating England in the 2016 final, winning their second title. When the 
Benson & Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB needed another one day competition 
to fill its place. Cricketing authorities were looking to boost the game's 
popularity with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds 
and reduced sponsorship. It was intended to deliver fast paced, exciting 
cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer 
versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, 
proposed a 20 over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they 
voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.[6] The first official 
Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties 
in the Twenty20 Cup.[7] The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative 
success, with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by 9 wickets 
in the final to claim the title.[8] The first Twenty20 match held at Lord's, 
on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, 
the largest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground other 
than a one-day final since 1953.[9] Soon after with the adoption of Twenty20 
matches by other cricket boards, the popularity of the format grew with 
unexpected crowd attendance, new regional tournaments such as Pakistan's 
Faysal Bank T20 Cup and Stanford 20/20 tournament and the financial incentive 
in the format. The West Indies regional teams competed in what was named 
the Stanford 20/20 tournament. The event was financially backed by convicted 
fraudster Allen Stanford, who gave at least US$28,000,000 funding money, 
the fruit of his massive Ponzi scheme. It was intended that the tournament 
would be an annual event. Guyana won the inaugural event, defeating Trinidad 
and Tobago by 5 wickets, securing US$1,000,000 in prize money.[10][11] 
A spin-off tournament, the Stanford Super Series, was held in October 2008 
between Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective winners of the 
English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, and a Stanford Superstars 
team formed from West Indies domestic players; Trinidad and Tobago won 
the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money.[12][13] On 1 November, 
the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first 
of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming a US$20,000,000 
in each match.[14][15] On 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand 
in the first men's full international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park 
in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides 
turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's 
a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also 
sported moustaches/beards and hair styles popular in the 1980s taking part 
in a competition amongst themselves for best retro look, at the request 
of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the 
result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and 
umpires took things less seriously – Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the 
Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, 
and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card (red cards are not normally 
used in cricket) in response. It was first decided that every two years 
an ICC World Twenty20 tournament is to take place, except in the event 
of an Cricket World Cup being scheduled in the same year, in which case 
it will be held the year before. The first tournament was in 2007 in South 
Africa where India defeated Pakistan in the final. Two Associate teams 
had played in the first tournament, selected through the 2007 ICC World 
Cricket League Division One, a 50-over competition. In December 2007 it 
was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 20-over format to better 
prepare the teams. With six participants, two would qualify for the 2009 
World Twenty20 and would each receive $250,000 in prize money.[16] The 
second tournament was won by Pakistan who beat Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in 
England on 21 June 2009. The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament was held 
in West Indies in May 2010, where England defeated Australia by 7 wickets. 
The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was won by the West-Indies, by defeating Sri 
Lanka at the finals. For the first time, a host nation competed in the 
final of the ICC World Twenty20. There were 12 participants for the title 
including Ireland and Afghanistan as 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. 
It was the first time the T20 World Cup tournament took place in an Asian 
country. The 2012 edition was to be expanded into a 16 team format however 
this was reverted to 12.[17] The 2014 tournament, held in Bangladesh was 
the first to feature 16 teams including all ten full members and six associate 
members who qualified through the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. However 
the top eight full member teams in the ICC T20I Championship rankings on 
8 October 2012 were given a place in the Super 10 stage. The remaining 
eight teams competed in the group stage, from which two teams advance to 
the Super 10 stage.[18][19] Three new teams (Nepal, Hong Kong and UAE) 
made their debut in this tournament. All ICC full members qualify automatically 
for the tournament, with the remaining places filled by other ICC members 
through a qualification tournament, known as the World Twenty20 Qualifier. 
Qualification for the inaugural 2007 World Twenty20 came from the results 
of the first cycle of the World Cricket League, a 50-over league for ICC 
associate and affiliate members. The two finalists of the 2007 WCL Division 
One tournament, Kenya and Scotland, qualified for the World Twenty20 later 
in the year. A separate qualification tournament was implemented for the 
2009 World Twenty20, and has been retained since then. The number of teams 
qualifying through the World Twenty20 Qualifier has varied, however, ranging 
from two (in 2010 and 2012) to six (in 2014 and 2016). In each group stage 
(both the preliminary round and the Super 10 round), teams are ranked against 
each other based on the following criteria:[20] In case of a tie (that 
is, both teams scoring the same number of runs at the end of their respective 
innings), a Super Over would decide the winner. In the case of a tie occurring 
again in the Super Over, the match is won by the team that has scored the 
most sixes in their innings. This is applicable in all stages of the tournament, 
having been implemented during the 2009 tournament. During the 2007 tournament, 
a bowl-out was used to decide the loser of tied matches.[21] The International 
Cricket Council's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament 
after examining bids from the nations which have expressed an interest 
in holding the event. After South Africa in 2007, England, West Indies 
and Sri Lanka hosted the tournament in 2009, 2010 and 2012 respectively. 
Bangladesh hosted the tournament in 2014.[22] India hosted the last edition 
of the tournament in 2016.[23] In December 2015, Tim Anderson, the ICC's 
head of global development, suggested that a future tournament be hosted 
by the United States. He believed that hosting the event could help spur 
growth of the game in the country, where it is relatively obscure and faces 
competition by other sports such as baseball.[24] Note: The ICC does not 
adjudicate rankings but only rounds a team achieves e.g. Semis, round one 
etc. The table below provides an overview of the performances of teams 
in the ICC World Twenty20. The team ranking in each tournament is according 
to ICC. For each tournament, the number of teams in each finals tournament
