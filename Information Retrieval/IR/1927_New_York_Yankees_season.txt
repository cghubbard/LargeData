The 1927 New York Yankees season was their 25th season. The team finished 
with a record of 110–44, winning their fifth pennant and finishing 19 games 
ahead of the Philadelphia Athletics and were tied for first or better for 
the whole season.[1] New York was managed by Miller Huggins. The Yankees 
played at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they swept the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. This Yankee team is known for their feared lineup, which was nicknamed 
"Murderers' Row". This team is widely considered to be the best baseball 
team in the history of MLB.[2][3][4] The Yankees' 110 victories broke the 
previous American League mark of 105 (set by the 1912 Boston Red Sox) and 
would stand as the American League single-season record until it was broken 
by the Cleveland Indians in 1954. This was the first year the Yankees acknowledged 
their team nickname on their uniforms, albeit their road uniforms. Their 
home uniforms remained free of any kind of logo except for the "NY" on 
their caps. The roster included seven future Hall of Famers: Pitchers Herb 
Pennock and Waite Hoyt, Infielders Lou Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri, outfielders 
Babe Ruth and Earle Combs, and Manager Miller Huggins. With the race long 
since decided, the nation's attention turned to Babe Ruth's pursuit of 
his own home run mark of 59, set in 1921. Early in the season, Ruth expressed 
doubts about his chances: "I don't suppose I'll ever break that 1921 record. 
To do that, you've got to start early, and the pitchers have got to pitch 
to you. I don't start early, and the pitchers haven't really pitched to 
me in four seasons. I get more bad balls to hit than any other five men...and 
fewer good ones." Ruth was also being challenged for his slugger's crown 
by teammate Lou Gehrig, who nudged ahead of Ruth's total in midseason, 
prompting the New York World-Telegram to anoint Gehrig the favorite. But 
Ruth caught Gehrig (who would finish with 47), and then had a remarkable 
last leg of the season, hitting 17 home runs in September. His 60th came 
on September 30, in the Yankees' next-to-last game. Ruth was exultant, 
shouting after the game, "Sixty, count 'em, sixty! Let's see some son-of-a-b**** 
match that!" In later years, he would give Gehrig some credit: "Pitchers 
began pitching to me because if they passed me they still had Lou to contend 
with." In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted .356, drove 
in 164 runs and slugged .772. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders

voter could select only one player per team, two good candidates from the 
same team could find their votes split and both of their chances of winning 
hurt. In addition, the clause prohibiting repeat winners led to unusual 
results like Babe Ruth's 1927 (one of the greatest offensive seasons of 
all time) not being eligible for the award. As The New York Times wrote 
in 1925, "[T]he purpose, of course, is to pass the honor around, but the 
effect is to pass an empty honor around."[5] In 2016, ESPN announced 1927: 
The Diary of Myles Thomas, part a new genre of storytelling known as "real-time 
historical fiction."[7] The core of the project is a historical novel in 
the form of a diary of Myles Thomas, written by Douglas Alden, complemented 
by a wealth of fact-based content from the season, all published along 
the same timeline as the events unfolded almost 90 years ago. Through Myles 
Thomas’s diary entries, additional essays and real-time social-media components 
(including Twitter[8]) “re-living” that famous Yankees season, the goal 
is to explore the rarefied nexus of baseball, jazz and Prohibition — defining 
elements of the remarkable world that existed in 1927. The diary runs the 
length of the full 1927 season, from April 13 through October 10, 1927.[9]
