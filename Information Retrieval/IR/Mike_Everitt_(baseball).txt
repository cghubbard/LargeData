Mike G. Everitt (born August 22, 1964[1]) is a Major League Baseball umpire, 
, wearing number 57. He worked in the American League from 1996 to 1999 
and throughout both major leagues since 2000. Everitt attended Aztec High 
School in Aztec, New Mexico. He played several sports at the school and 
graduated in 1982. He appeared in that year's Connie Mack World Series.[2] 
Over his major league career, Everitt has worked the All-Star Game one 
time 2006, the Wild Card Game two times (2013, 2016) the Division Series 
eight times (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2015), the League 
Championship Series five times (2002, 2003, 2008, 2011, 2013), and the 
2006 All-Star Game.[1] Everitt has also umpired the World Series three 
times (2007,[3] 2009[4] and 2015) Everitt worked the 2003 National League 
Championship Series and was the left field umpire during Game 6, in which 
Chicago Cubs fan Steve Bartman arguably prevented Cubs left fielder Mois√©s 
Alou from catching a foul pop up hit by Florida Marlins second baseman 
Luis Castillo. Everitt ruled that the ball would have landed in the stands 
without Bartman's interference, and therefore Castillo was not out. Alou 
and Mark Prior vehemently protested the call to no avail and the Marlins 
proceeded to score 8 runs to win Game 6 and later the series. During a 
San Diego Padres vs. Cubs game in Chicago, on June 16, 2007, Everitt was 
the plate umpire. Padres pitcher Chris Young hit Cubs first baseman Derrek 
Lee up and in with a pitch. Rather than getting in between Lee and Young 
as Lee exchanged words with Young, Everitt instead was talking to Padres 
catcher Rob Bowen about an unknown subject. Lee ended up throwing a punch 
at Young, who threw a punch back, starting a benches-clearing brawl. Young, 
Lee, and others were ejected. Cubs play-by-play announcer Len Kasper criticized 
and questioned Everitt for not getting in between Lee and Young to prevent 
a brawl. During Game 4 of the 2009 World Series, between the New York Yankees 
and the Philadelphia Phillies, Pedro Feliz hit a two-out single with Ryan 
Howard on second. There was a play at the plate and replay shows that Howard 
clearly - barely but clearly - missed home. However, the ball rolled away 
from Yankee catcher, Jorge Posada and CC Sabathia, backing up the play, 
threw to second to try to get Feliz going to second. It was at that point 
that Mike Everitt signaled Howard was safe at the plate, the correct ruling. 
Howard had not touched home, but had not been tagged out either: there 
was no call to make until Sabathia tried to make a play on Feliz, therefore 
losing the right to appeal that Howard missed home. On August 20, 2013, 
after the Boston Red Sox lost to the San Francisco Giants on a walk-off 
walk to batter Marco Scutaro, Red Sox starting pitcher Jake Peavy openly 
criticized plate umpire Everitt, stating, "The last pitch [called ball 
four] was a strike...At the end of the day, for an umpire not to make the 
call to cost us a game, that's extremely unfortunate." Replays, however, 
indicate the pitch was located off the outer edge of home plate and correctly 
ruled a ball.[5] On June 30, 2016, in a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals 
at Busch Stadium, Everitt permitted the Kansas City Royals to challenge 
a double-play call at first base despite both teams having returned to 
their dugouts. Under normal MLB rules, both teams retiring to their dugouts 
would make the play no longer eligible for replay, but Everitt gave the 
Royals - as described by Everitt to Matheny - a "courtesy". St. Louis Cardinals 
manager Mike Matheny was immediately ejected for raising the point with 
Everitt.[6] On August 27th, 2016 in a game between the Los Angeles Angels 
and Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, Everitt made several contested strike 
calls against Detroit hitters, resulting in the eventual ejection of Tigers 
designated hitter Victor Martinez, Manager Brad Ausmus, and Hitting Coach 
Wally Joyner, and right fielder J.D. Martinez in three separate incidents.[7]
