William O. DeWitt, Jr. (born August 31, 1941) is an American businessman 
and currently the managing partner and chairman of the St. Louis Cardinals, 
a professional baseball franchise which competes in Major League Baseball 
(MLB). [1] The Cardinals have won two World Series – in 2006 and 2011 – 
during DeWitt's time as owner. In addition to the Cardinals, DeWitt has 
also owned or invested in the Cincinnati Stingers hockey club, Baltimore 
Orioles, the Cincinnati Reds and the Texas Rangers. Business interests 
outside of baseball include Reynolds, DeWitt & Co., which owns Arby's franchises 
and invests in U.S. Playing Card Company, and the petroleum company Spectrum 
7. DeWitt, the son of longtime Major League Baseball executive Bill DeWitt, 
and Margaret H. DeWitt, was born in St. Louis, Missouri where he attended 
St. Louis Country Day School. He was around baseball constantly as a child, 
inasmuch as his father owned the St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds, 
and DeWitt served as a Browns batboy. He earned a bachelor's degree from 
Yale University in economics 1963 and an M.B.A. from Harvard University 
in 1965.[2] Dewitt joined Cincinnati investment firm Gradison & Co. in 
1974. In 1979, along with Mercer Reynolds, he founded the investment firm 
Reynolds, DeWitt & Co. The firm owns 63 Arby's franchises estimated at 
$50.4 million and is an investor in Cincinnati based U.S. Playing Card 
Company, with an estimated value of about $120 million. It also holds a 
$40 million stake in Newport Aquarium in Newport, Kentucky.[3] Another 
firm of DeWitt's involvement with private equity is in DeWitt Capital Group, 
registered since 2012.[4] DeWitt was an investor in the Cincinnati Reds 
and one-time part-owner of the Baltimore Orioles.[5] In 1984, one of DeWitt's 
business ventures, the oil company Spectrum 7, bought George W. Bush's 
Arbusto Energy, and in turn merged with Harken Energy in 1986. When Eddie 
Chiles intended to sell the Texas Rangers baseball franchise in 1989, DeWitt 
teamed with Bush and brought a group of investors together to help purchase 
the Rangers.[5] DeWitt has also held shares in the National Football League's 
Cincinnati Bengals and the former Cincinnati Stingers of the World Hockey 
Association.[2] In 1995, DeWitt, with Stephen and Frederick Brauer, purchased 
the St. Louis Cardinals from Anheuser-Busch for $150 million.[6] He oversees 
all league, financial, operational and baseball affairs for the club.[2] 
Since DeWitt bought the team, the Cardinals have won two World Series (2006 
and 2011), four National League pennants, and eight division titles, and 
have made 11 total playoff appearances.[7] According to Forbes, as of early 
2013, the Cardinals are worth $716 million.[8] The Cardinals are one of 
the largest privately held firms in St. Louis, bringing in an estimated 
$233 million in revenue in 2012.[9] In 1997, DeWitt established Cardinals 
Care, a nonprofit organization that builds baseball fields, assists youth 
baseball programs and awards grants to children's boards. Over the life 
of the organization, Cardinals Care has distributed over $18 million.[10] 
The organization has built 18 baseball fields in the Greater St. Louis 
area.[11] Redbird Rookies, a network of leagues Cardinals Care operates, 
was formed in 2004 and allows children to play baseball who would not otherwise 
have the opportunity. It also provides equipment and other necessities. 
Further, the program provides training for coaches and organizers to learn 
coaching and character-building elements integral to the program. Parents 
also have the opportunity to participate in workshops that teach the leagues' 
outlook. Redbird Rookies operates 20 leagues and serves nearly 4,500 children 
around Greater St. Louis and in rural sections of Missouri and Illinois.[12] 
The Cardinals have purchased three of their minor league affiliates since 
the DeWitt group took over. In 1998, DeWitt purchased the Palm Beach Cardinals 
of the Florida State League (minor league A-ball) and, in 2005, the Springfield 
Cardinals of the Texas League (AA).[2] As of April 2013, the team negotiated 
to purchase the Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League (AAA) from 
the Memphis Redbirds Foundation (MRF), a local non-profit entity. However, 
talks went on hold due to defaulted bonds on the building of AutoZone Park.[13] 
On November 16, 2013, the Cardinals announced a resolution to purchase 
of the team while the city purchased the stadium. The Cardinals agreed 
to lease the stadium from the city while Memphis will upgrade the park.[14] 
In 2013, Forbes listed the Redbirds as one of the ten most valuable minor 
league franchises.[15] To expand the Cardinals' international presence, 
DeWitt opened baseball academies in the Dominican Republic and placed representatives 
in six foreign countries.[2][16] The Cardinals moved from their old home, 
Busch Memorial Stadium, to Busch Stadium in 2006. The new stadium cost 
$365 million and is one of the few majority privately funded MLB stadiums, 
along with the San Francisco Giants' AT&T Park and the Los Angeles Dodgers' 
Dodger Stadium.[17] Busch Stadium cost $45 million (12%) in a long-term 
loan from St. Louis County, while, by comparison the Milwaukee Brewers' 
Miller Park ended up drawing 77.5% in public funding.[18] In conjunction 
with opening the new Busch Stadium, a mixed-use retail, entertainment, 
hotel, residential and office space known as Ballpark Village was planned 
for development adjacent to Busch Stadium. However, several years of delays 
postponed the groundbreaking and construction until spring of 2013.[19] 
In 2009, the Cardinals hosted the All-Star Game. DeWitt began emphasizing 
developing talent as much as possible through the minor leagues, rather 
than relying mainly on free agents. Seventeen of the 25 players on the 
Cardinals' 2011 World Series roster were Cardinals' draftees.[citation 
needed] In January 2014, the city of Memphis cleared the Cardinals to purchase 
the Memphis Redbirds from the MRF.[20] Ballpark Village construction was 
completed and it opened in March 2014.[21] The Cardinals also announced 
the rechristening of the team Hall of Fame Museum with an annual selection 
process selection commencing in 2015. Twenty-two former Cardinals players 
and personnel were announced for induction into the Hall of Fame for the 
inaugural class of 2014. Closed since 2008 when the International Bowling 
Hall of Fame moved to Texas, this reincarnation of the museum is located 
in the newly constructed Ballpark Village within the same building as the 
Cardinal Nation Restaurant.[22] The Cardinals' value exceeded $1 billion 
for the first time in 2015 when Forbes appraised the Cardinals outright 
at $1.4 billion,[23] making them the 27th-most valuable sports franchise 
in the world,[24] and sixth-principal franchise in Major League Baseball 
(MLB).[23] It was an increase from an $800 million pricing and eighth in 
the echelon in 2014.[25] Their revenue was $294 million while their operating 
income was $73.6 million,[23] and their overall assessment was approximately 
$200 million higher than the MLB average of $1.2 billion. Mike Ozanian 
of Forbes remarked that the Cardinals were "baseball's biggest anamoly", 
with outsize value outpacing their status as one of baseball's "smallest 
markets", and Ballpark Village was a popular destination for dining and 
entertainment. The Cardinals' local television ratings (7.76) graded the 
highest among all major league teams.[26] Reports surfaced on June 16, 
2015, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were reviewing an 
alleged incident involving Cardinals' front office officials hacking into 
the Houston Astros' database of players, scouting reports and proprietary 
statistics. It was regarded as the first known case of corporate espionage 
involving computer network hacking in professional sports.[27] On September 
19, 2015, the Cardinals became the first team in MLB to clinch a playoff 
spot that season. It also extended a franchise record of five consecutive 
seasons of reaching the postseason, a record which the club had set in 
2014.[28] In 2003 President George W. Bush appointed DeWitt to be on the 
President's Intelligence Advisory Board and tapped his wife, Kathy, to 
serve on the National Endowment for the Arts.[29][30] DeWitt and his wife, 
Katharine Cramer DeWitt, live in Indian Hill, Ohio and have four children 
and twelve grandchildren. Their children are Katie, Bill, Andrew and Margot.[2] 
Andrew DeWitt is the founder and CEO of Dewey's Pizza.[31] Bill DeWitt
