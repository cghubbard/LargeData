Delmer David Baker (May 3, 1892 – September 11, 1973) was an American catcher, 
coach, and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a manager, he led 
the 1940 Detroit Tigers to the American League pennant. He was known as 
one of the premier sign stealers of his era.[1] Baker was born in Sherwood, 
Oregon, and raised in neighboring Wilsonville. After graduating from a 
Portland business college, he took a job in 1909 as a bookkeeper in Wasco, 
Oregon, where he caught for the town team. In 1911, a scout signed him 
to a contract with the Spokane Indians of the Class A (equivalent to today's 
Triple A) Pacific National League, predecessor to the Pacific Coast League 
(PCL).[2] In 1914 he was promoted to the Detroit Tigers, and played in 
172 games over three seasons as a back-up for Oscar Stanage, batting .209. 
In 1917, the Tigers farmed him out to the PCL's San Francisco Seals. In 
1918 he joined the war effort, serving in the US Navy, then returned to 
the PCL in 1920, this time with the Portland Beavers. After three seasons 
there, Baker spent a season with the Mobile Bears of the Class A Southern 
Association, then returned to the PCL for three more seasons with the Oakland 
Oaks.[3] After spending most of the 1928 season as player-manager of the 
Ogden Gunners in the Class C Utah-Idaho League, Baker moved to the Class 
A Texas League and caught for the Fort Worth Panthers in 1929. In 1930 
he was appointed player-manager of the Beaumont Exporters, a premier Texas 
League team with some of Detroit's top prospects, including Schoolboy Rowe, 
Pete Fox, and Hank Greenberg. The Exporters won 100 games in 1932, then 
swept the Dallas Steers for the Texas League championship.[3] When Detroit 
manager Bucky Harris promoted Rowe, Fox, and Greenberg to the major league 
level in 1933, he hired Baker to coach third base for the Tigers. Baker 
served as interim manager after Harris was fired toward the end of the 
1933 season, then returned to coaching third base under Harris' replacement, 
player-manager Mickey Cochrane. The Tigers won back-to-back AL pennants 
in 1934 and '35, and their first ever World Series title in 1935. Baker 
managed the team again in mid-1936, when Cochrane took a leave of absence 
due to what was described as a "nervous breakdown"; and again in mid-1937 
after Cochrane suffered a fractured skull when he was hit by a pitch.[4] 
In 1938, the Tigers compiled an early-season record of 47-51; on August 
7, Baker replaced Cochrane as manager. He rallied Detroit to 37 wins in 
56 games, enough to finish in the first division, but Detroit slipped to 
fifth in 1939.[3] In 1940, the New York Yankees, who had won the AL pennant 
and the World Series four years running, faltered, leaving the Tigers and 
the Cleveland Indians to contend for the league title. On the final day 
of the season, with the two teams tied, Baker chose obscure rookie pitcher 
Floyd Giebell to pitch for the pennant against future Hall of Famer Bob 
Feller. The Tigers won the game and the pennant, 2–0; but in the World 
Series, they lost in seven games to the Cincinnati Reds, despite Bobo Newsom's 
heroic pitching performances.[5] With World War II on the horizon, the 
1941 season was marked by the call to active military service of numerous 
baseball stars, including Greenberg. With their star power hitter out of 
the lineup, and Newsom ineffective, Detroit fell below .500 that season, 
and again in 1942. Baker was replaced after the 1942 season by Steve O'Neill.[6] 
Baker returned to the coaching ranks with Cleveland (1943–44) and the Boston 
Red Sox (1945–48; 1953–60). From 1949–51, he served as skipper of the Sacramento 
Solons and the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League. In his final 
season, 1960, Baker managed one last time in the big leagues as Boston's 
interim pilot from June 8–12 between Billy Jurges' firing and Pinky Higgins' 
rehiring. Under Baker, the last-place Red Sox won two games and lost five. 
He retired from the game after his 50th season in baseball, his last day 
overshadowed by Ted Williams' last game as a player. Baker died at age 
81 in Olmos Park, Texas.[1] As a coach and manager, Baker was known for 
his proficiency at detecting the type of pitch an opposing pitcher was 
about to deliver and tipping off his team's batter with verbal signals. 
He carefully observed each pitcher's idiosyncrasies, looking, he said, 
“for all the little quirks, details and tell‐tales.” He found that many 
pitchers concealed the ball poorly before delivery, allowing him to see 
their grip. Others telegraphed their curve balls by bending their wrists, 
or subtly altering their wind‐ups. “There are also facial telltales. I 
know pitchers who, when they throw a curve, bite the lip or stick out the 
tongue,” he said.[1] Tigers shortstop Dick Bartell wrote that the Tigers 
were unusually successful against Feller in 1940 because Baker was reading 
all of Feller’s pitches.[7] Among Detroit hitters, it was said that Greenberg 
was the biggest beneficiary of Baker's tip-offs, although Greenberg himself 
said that "the importance of such information ... has been exaggerated."[3] 
Another apparent beneficiary was Don Larsen, who wrote in his memoir: In 
response, Larsen adopted a "no-windup" delivery, which he used in the 1956 
World Series to pitch the only perfect game in Series history, in Game
