Washington Huskies is the nickname of the University of Washington's athletic 
teams. The school is a member of the Pac-12 Conference. The athletic program 
is made up of 9 men's sports (baseball, basketball, crew, cross country, 
football, golf, soccer, tennis, track and field) and 10 women's sports 
(basketball, crew, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, softball, tennis, 
track and field, volleyball, sand volleyball). Among its facilities on 
campus are Husky Stadium (football), Hec Edmundson Pavilion (basketball, 
gymnastics and volleyball), Husky Ballpark (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium 
(softball), the Nordstrom Tennis Center, the Dempsey Indoor practice facility, 
and the Conibear Shellhouse (rowing). Recently added was the Husky Track 
located just north of the Husky Ballpark. The golf team's home course is 
at the Washington National Golf Club in Auburn. UW students, sports teams, 
and alumni are called Huskies. The husky was selected as the school mascot 
by student committee in 1923.[2] It replaced the "Sun Dodger," an abstract 
reference to the local weather that was quickly dropped in favor of something 
more tangible. The costumed "Harry the Husky" performs at sporting and 
special events, and a live Alaskan Malamute, currently named Dubs, has 
traditionally led the UW football team onto the field at the start of games. 
The school colors of purple and gold were adopted in 1892 by student vote. 
The choice was purportedly inspired by the first stanza of Lord Byron's 
The Destruction of Sennacherib:[3] The Assyrian came down like the wolf 
on the fold, And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold; And the 
sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea, When the blue wave rolls 
nightly on deep Galilee. The University of Washington sponsors teams in 
ten men's and twelve women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[4] Men's Intercollegiate 
Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports The development of the Husky Athletic 
Village begins with the construction of the new Husky Stadium. Husky Stadium 
serves as the first and primary income source of a completely remodeled 
athletic district, which includes a new $20 million Husky Ballpark, a new 
track and field stadium, renovated soccer stadium, $62 million basketball 
operations and practice facility, and recently completed projects such 
as the Husky Legends Center, a state-of-the-art golf training facility, 
the Dempsey Indoor track and field facility, the Conibear Shellhouse as 
well as the Alaska Airlines Arena renovation. Along with new facilities, 
a master plan has been created outlining future and existing space for 
projects, open space, plantings, parking, as well as a general concept 
for street and walking grids. All existing and future projects will be 
set up in a "village"-type atmosphere, where fans and athletes can walk 
along tree-lined sidewalks from one facility to the next. This major remodel 
of the athletic village is coinciding with construction for an underground 
station for a northern extension of the Link Light Rail system, and a planned 
replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge. The University football 
team's first game was in 1889. From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams 
were unbeaten in 64 consecutive games, an NCAA Division I-A record.[6] 
During this period, Washington won 40 games in a row under coach Gil Dobie, 
currently the second longest winning streak in NCAA Division I-A history.[6] 
In 1916, Dobie finished his remarkable coaching career at Washington with 
an undefeated 58-0-3 record. The 1925 team posted an undefeated record 
but lost to Alabama 21-20 in the Rose Bowl. The 1960 team finished 10-1, 
under coach Jim Owens, and won its second consecutive Rose Bowl by defeating 
national champion Minnesota 17-7 (the national champion was declared before 
the bowl games in 1960). Coach Owens served from 1957 to 1974. Don James 
became head coach in 1975 and transformed the team into a national power 
while compiling a 153-57-2 record. James' first successful year was in 
1977 with the team quarterbacked by Warren Moon culminating in a 27-20 
victory over Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Washington and Michigan played 
again in the Rose Bowl in 1981 resulting in a Michigan win 23-11. The next 
year, the Huskies returned to the Rose Bowl and defeated Iowa 28-0, the 
last Rose Bowl shutout and the only shutout in the past half century. Following 
a two-year hiatus during which cross-state rival WSU prevented the Huskies 
from Rose Bowl appearances by defeating them in the last game of the 1982 
and 1983 seasons, Washington posted an 11-1 record and beat Oklahoma 28-17 
to win the Orange Bowl. Senior running back, Jacque Robinson won the MVP 
award and was the first player to win MVP awards for both the Orange and 
Rose Bowls. The 1991 team is considered to be the best Washington Husky 
football team and among the best in college football history. The team 
went undefeated, winning against opponents by an average score of 42-9 
in regular season, including wins over No. 9 Nebraska, No. 7 California 
and a 34-14 win over No. 4 Michigan in the Rose Bowl. In 2000, Washington 
finished with an 11-1 record, and won its seventh Rose Bowl under the leadership 
of Marques Tuiasosopo. In 2009, under first-year head coach Steve Sarkisian, 
the Huskies snapped a 15-game losing streak with a 42-23 victory over Idaho. 
The following week, Washington crushed the spirits of then-No. 3 USC, winning 
16-13 on a last-second field goal. The Huskies rose to No. 25 in the polls 
after the victory but lost six of their next eight games to fall to 5-7 
prior to a season finale showdown against No. 19-ranked California, where 
the Huskies won 42-10. Rowing is a longstanding tradition at the University 
of Washington dating back to 1901. The Washington men's crew won the gold 
medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, defeating the German and Italian 
crews. The rowing programs at the University of Washington are some of 
the most successful collegiate athletic programs of any type at any university.[citation

crew has won 19 national titles, 15 individual Olympic gold medals, two 
silver and five bronze. In 2012, 2013 and 2015 the men won every event 
at the National Championships, with 2012 being a year in which each boat 
set a new course record.[citation needed] The women have 11 national titles 
and two individual Olympic gold medals. The crew's traditional rival has 
been the other West Coast powerhouse, the University of California Golden 
Bears. The men's golf team has won six Pac-12 Conference championships: 
1961, 1963, 1988, 2005, 2009, 2010. James Lepp won the NCAA (individual) 
Championship in 2005. The women's golf team won their first NCAA national 
championship in 2016 by beating Stanford 3â€“2.[8] Founded in 1963, the University 
of Washington Husky Rugby Club plays college rugby in Division 1 in the 
Northwest Collegiate Rugby Conference against local rivals such as Washington 
State and Oregon. The Huskies won the Northwest championship in 1996, 2002, 
2004 and 2005 and the D1AA Varsity Cup in 2014.[9] The Huskies are led 
by head coach Brian Schoener, who formerly played for the U.S. national 
rugby team,[10] by former U.S. national team player Kevin Swiryn, and by 
Director of Rugby Mike Alfstad. The Huskies rugby team is partially funded 
by an endowment from the alumni association.[11] The University of Washington 
Husky Lacrosse Club plays college lacrosse in the Division 1 of the Men's 
Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA) against local rivals such as Washington 
State, Oregon, Oregon St. and Western Washington. The Huskies have made 
the Pacific Northwest Collegiate Lacrosse League (PNCLL) playoffs 5 of 
the last 6 years.[12] The Lacrosse team plays their home games on the IMA 
fields, and are regularly attended and popular amongst UW students; especially 
when in-state rival, Washington St. comes into town.[13] The Husky's Lacrosse 
team is funded by annual dues paid by the players, as well as assistance 
from the IMA, and fundraisers. Washington has won 7 NCAA team national 
championships.[14] Below are 28 national team titles that were not bestowed
