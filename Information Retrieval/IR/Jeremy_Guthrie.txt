Jeremy Shane Guthrie (born April 8, 1979) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies, and 
Kansas City Royals. Guthrie was born in Roseburg, Oregon[1] and grew up 
in Ashland, Oregon. As a youth, he attained the rank of Eagle Scout in 
the Boy Scouts of America.[2] Guthrie attended Ashland High School, where 
he excelled in basketball, football, baseball, as well as the classroom, 
where he was class valedictorian. After high school, he attended Brigham 
Young University before transferring to Stanford University, where he was 
a starting pitcher on their baseball team. Guthrie was the ace of the Stanford 
University staff and formed a battery with Ryan Garko. He pitched in the 
regionals that season against MAAC champion Marist College in the first 
gamee and won 5–3. His team made it all the way to the World Series final 
in Omaha, but lost 12–1 in the Championship to the Miami Hurricanes. Guthrie 
was the first-round selection (22nd overall) of the Cleveland Indians in 
the 2002 Major League Baseball draft.[3] He signed with the Indians on 
October 3, 2002.[4] His four-year, $4 million contract included a $3 million 
signing bonus.[5] Guthrie made his major league debut in 2004, appearing 
in 6 games for the Indians. Guthrie spent the majority of the season in 
the minors. He appeared in the majors for just 1 game, pitching 6 innings 
while allowing 4 runs. Guthrie spent most of 2006 season with the Triple-A 
Buffalo Bisons, but was twice called up to the majors to join the Cleveland 
Indians as a relief pitcher. He wore jersey number 57 for both the Bisons 
and the Indians. After being removed from the 40-man roster following the 
signing of Trot Nixon and with no remaining Minor League options, he was 
designated for assignment on January 19, 2007.[5] Guthrie was claimed off 
waivers by the Baltimore Orioles on January 29, 2007.[5] Upon joining the 
team, he requested and was granted permission to wear uniform number 46 
from then-executive vice president of baseball operations Mike Flanagan, 
who had worn it during his playing career with the ballclub.[6] After starting 
the year in the Baltimore Orioles' bullpen and then moving into the starting 
rotation, Guthrie enjoyed a breakout year in 2007, becoming one of the 
best and most consistent pitchers in the American League. Through June 
21 that year, he ranked 2nd in ERA and allowed more than two earned runs 
in just 1 out of 10 starts.[7] He was also first in the AL in WHIP. Through 
the end of July 2007, Guthrie had a 7-3 record in 17 starts to go with 
a sparkling 2.89 ERA and a 1.027 WHIP (second only to two-time Cy Young 
Award winner Johan Santana), albeit in only 124.7 innings of work. Guthrie's 
rise to unexpected success in the first half of the season led to consideration 
for the American League's Rookie of the Year Award. He finished the year 
7-5 in 32 starts. In August 2008, Guthrie recorded his first career complete 
game, defeating the Seattle Mariners 3–1. Throughout the 2008 season, Guthrie 
emerged as the staff ace of the Baltimore Orioles. Guthrie finished the 
season with a 3.63 ERA, going 10-12 for the O's. Guthrie pitched for Team 
USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. Guthrie pitched on Opening Day 
for the Orioles against the New York Yankees before a record Opening Day 
crowd at Camden Yards. Guthrie pitched six innings and gave up three runs. 
The 2009 season wasn't Guthrie's best, as his ERA ballooned to 5.04 and 
he led the league in losses with 17. Guthrie rebounded in 2010, winning 
a career-high 11 games despite losing 14 and lowering his ERA to 3.83 in 
32 starts. Despite topping over 200 innings for the third straight season, 
Guthrie led the league in losses with 17. On February 6, 2012, Jeremy Guthrie 
was traded to the Rockies for pitchers Matt Lindstrom and Jason Hammel.[8] 
Guthrie battled through inconsistency and a mental lapse while pitching 
in Coors Field, registering an ERA over 8 at home for the Rockies. In 19 
games, Guthrie had an ERA of 6.35. His record was 3-9 in his short stay 
with Colorado. On July 20, 2012, Guthrie was traded to the Royals for left-handed 
starter Jonathan Sánchez. He proved to be the Royals' best pitcher in the 
second half of the season, posting a record of 5-3 with a 3.16 ERA in 14 
starts.[9] On November 20, Guthrie inked a 3-year, $25 million deal with 
the Royals through 2015. Guthrie will earn $5 million in 2013, $11 million 
in 2014, and $9 million in the contract's final year.[9] Guthrie logged 
the most innings of his career during the 2013 season with 211.2. He finished 
with a 15-12 record and a 4.04 ERA. During the 2014 season Guthrie posted 
a 4.13 ERA over 202.2 innings and finished the regular season with a record 
of 13-11. He also appeared in the postseason for the first time in his 
career. In Game 3 of the ALCS against his former team, the Baltimore Orioles, 
he allowed one run over five innings and got a no-decision in the Royals 
victory. He made two starts in the World Series against the San Francisco 
Giants, going 1-1. On May 25, Guthrie had the worst start of his career, 
and one of the worst starts in MLB history against the New York Yankees. 
Guthrie gave up 9 hits, 11 earned runs, 3 walks. 13 of the 16 batters he 
faced reached base, and he recorded just 3 outs before being pulled. Guthrie 
was the first pitcher since Jae Kuk Ryu in 2006 to give up 4 home runs 
and pitch fewer than 2 innings. On August 22, the Royals demoted Guthrie 
to the bullpen to make room in the rotation for Kris Medlen. Guthrie finished 
8-8 with an ERA of 5.95. He walked 44 batters and struck out just 84 in 
148 1/3 innings pitched. On February 20, 2016, Guthrie signed a minor league 
deal with the Texas Rangers.[10] He was released on March 28.[11] On April 
1, 2016, Guthrie signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres.[12] 
He was released on June 3, 2016. Guthrie and the Marlins agreed to a Minor 
league Contract on June 27, 2016. After struggling at the AAA level and 
the Marlins acquiring starting pitching depth, Guthrie was released from 
his minor league deal on July 31st. At Stanford, he studied sociology; 
he continues to pursue his degree in the offseason. Guthrie is a member
