operates under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law form of New Jersey municipal 
government. The voters elect five members to a council who are elected 
at-large in non-partisan elections held as part of the May municipal election 
to serve four-year terms of office on a concurrent basis.[8] A mayor and 
deputy mayor are selected by the council from among its members. The council 
is an exclusively legislative body with responsibility for day-to-day operation 
of the borough assigned to a manager who acts as the municipal chief executive 
and executes laws and policies, prepares the budget for council consideration 
and attends and participates at meetings with a voice, but no vote. The 
manager recommends improvements and implements those approved, as well 
as oversees contracts and franchises and reports violations. It is the 
responsibility of the manager to appoint and remove department heads and 
make all additional appointments not made by the council.[40] As of 2016[update], 
members of the Lodi Township Council are Mayor Emil Carafa Jr. (term as 
mayor ends June 30, 2016), Deputy Mayor Patricia Ann Licata (term as deputy 
mayor ends June 30, 2016), Laura E. Cima, Albert DiChiara (appointed to 
serve an unexpired term) and Vincent Martin, all of whom were elected in 
May 2015 and serve terms of office that expire on June 30, 2019.[3][41][42][43] 
In January 2016, the Township Council appointed Albert DiChiara to fill 
the seat vacated by Bruce Masopust when he took office as Borough Manager; 
DiChiara will serve until a special vote held as part of the November 2016 
general election.[44] In February 2015, the township council selected Emil 
Carafa Jr., to fill the vacant council seat of Mayor Marc Schrieks, who 
left office to take a position in the administration of County Executive 
James J. Tedesco III, while Bruce Masopust was chosen to succeed Schrieks 
in his role as mayor.[45] Schrieks was elected by the council as mayor 
on July 1, 2008, and served until June 30, 2009, making him the youngest 
person to ever serve as its Mayor.[46] Karen Viscana was the first woman 
in Lodi history to serve as mayor when she was sworn in to office in 2008.[47]
