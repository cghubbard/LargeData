Kristopher Allen Medlen (born October 7, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Atlanta Braves and Kansas City Royals. Medlen graduated from 
Gahr High School in Cerritos, California in the year 2003. He attended 
El Camino College his freshman year and hit .296 with 18 RBI's as an infielder. 
As a pitcher, Medlen posted a 2.84 ERA with 17 K's in 19 innings of work, 
leading the team with 4 saves.[1] Medlen redshirted the next year,[2] before 
transferring to Santa Ana College. At Santa Ana, Medlen played as the starting 
shortstop and hit .332 with 10 HR's and 42 RBI. He also served as the team's 
closer, posting a 2.23 ERA with 16 saves, striking out 57 in 44.1 innings 
pitched.[3] Medlen was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 10th round 
of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft. The Braves saw promise for Medlen 
as a relief pitcher, and drafted him with the intention of using him in 
the bullpen.[4] Medlen played his first professional baseball game on June 
22, 2006, for the Danville Braves of the Appalachian League. He appeared 
in 20 games for Danville, and pitched a total of 22 innings, being credited 
with 1 win, no losses, and 10 saves. In those 22 innings, Medlen allowed 
14 hits and only 1 earned run. He struck out 36 batters, and allowed only 
2 walks. His ERA was 0.41 and his WHIP was 0.727.[5] Medlen played for 
three of the Braves minor league teams during 2007, progressing from the 
Rome Braves (single A, South Atlantic League), to the Myrtle Beach Pelicans 
(high A, Carolina League) and ending the season with the Mississippi Braves 
(AA, Southern League).[5] His statistics for these three teams were as 
follows: For the Rome Braves, Medlen appeared in 17 games, logging 20.2 
innings, with 33 strike-outs and 3 walks; he had an ERA of 0.87 and a WHIP 
of 0.774. For the Myrtle Beach Braves, Medlen appeared in 18 games, pitching 
24 innings, with 28 strike-outs and 9 walks (2 of them intentional); he 
had an ERA of 1.12 and a WHIP of 1.230. For the Mississippi Braves, Medlen 
appeared in only 3 games, for a total of 2.1 innings. He had 2 strike-outs 
and 2 walks, allowing 4 hits and 3 earned runs (for an ERA of 11.57 and 
a WHIP of 2.571).[6] Medlen spent the entire 2008 season with the Mississippi 
Braves of the Southern League. He made 19 relief appearances from April 
5 to June 1, and got his first start on June 5, 2012, against the Mobile 
BayBears (an Arizona Diamondbacks affiliate). He recorded 10 strike-outs 
in two of his starts, in a 7.0 inning start against the Pensacola Blue 
Wahoos (on July 7, 2008), a game in which he allowed 4 hits and 1 walk, 
but also allowed 3 runs, and in a 6.0 inning start against the Carolina 
Mudcats (on August 22, 2008), a game in which he allowed 3 hits and 1 walk, 
but no runs.[7] For the season, Medlen started 17 games, with 6 wins and 
5 losses. Medlen was named Southern League pitcher of the week on July 
14, 2008, after the week in which he had 10 strike-outs against the Blue 
Wahoos and a win against the Chattanooga Lookouts, in which he allowed 
5 hits, 1 walk and 1 run over 6 innings, while striking out 6 batters.[8] 
Medlen began his major league career as a starter, making his debut on 
May 21, 2009 pitching just 3.0 innings, giving up 5 earned runs on 3 hits 
against the Colorado Rockies.[9] Medlen earned his first major league win 
on May 31, 2009 against the Arizona Diamondbacks pitching 6 innings and 
giving up only 1 earned run.[10] Medlen went to the Braves bullpen, to 
make room for rookie starting pitcher Tommy Hanson, and Medlen made his 
first appearance as a relief pitcher on June 9, 2009, when he pitched scoreless 
13th, 14th and 15th innings to get a win against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[11] 
For the 2009 season, Medlen pitched a total of 67.2 innings, gave up 65 
hits and 30 walks, while striking out 72. His record was 3 wins and 5 losses, 
with an ERA of 4.26.[12] On August 5, 2010, Medlen was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list with a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament tear in his 
right elbow. It was announced by the Atlanta Braves that he would require 
Tommy John surgery to repair the damage, ending his season. Medlen spent 
much of the 2011 season rehabbing following the surgery. He was activated 
from the 60-day disabled list on September 24, 2011, and pitched in only 
two games.[13] Medlen began the 2012 major league season as a reliever 
for the Atlanta Braves, typically pitching middle innings before the Braves 
set-up man and closer came on for the 8th and 9th innings. He was sent 
down to the Braves AAA team (the Gwinnett Braves), for the purpose of "stretching 
him out" to return to the majors as a starter. He started only three games 
for the Gwinnett Braves, pitching 2.1, 5.0 and 6.0 innings and having a 
record of two losses and one "no decision".[14] He returned to Atlanta 
on June 18, 2012, and made 16 appearances in relief, from June 18, 2012 
through July 25, 2012. Medlen got his first start of the 2012 season, on 
July 31, 2012, against the Miami Marlins, allowing 4 hits and 1 earned 
run and recording the Win in a 7-1 game.[15] After an August 5 "no decision" 
against the Houston Astros (which the Braves won by a 6-1 score), Medlen 
won five consecutive games in dominating style. On August 11, 2012, in 
a 9-3 win against the Mets at Citi Field, Medlen pitched 6.1 innings, allowing 
5 hits and 1 walk, while striking out 7.[16] Medlen recorded his first 
complete game shut-out on August 16, 2012, with a 6-0 victory over the 
San Diego Padres, in which allowed 5 hits and struck out 6, allowing no 
walks.[17] Perhaps the most important win of Medlen's professional career 
came on August 22, at Washington, with the Braves ending a four-game losing 
streak that had included two games against the Division-leading Nationals. 
Medlen pitched 7 innings, allowing 7 hits and 1 walk, while striking out 
7. The win allowed the Braves to remain six games behind the Nationals.[18] 
With the win over the Nationals, Medlen also broke a franchise record with 
the Braves winning the 16th consecutive game that Medlen had started. The 
previous record of 15 consecutive wins had been set by John Smoltz, in 
1996.[19] Medlen's fourth win in the month of August 2012 came at San Diego, 
on August 28, with Medlen pitching 8 shut-out innings. Medlen allowed 5 
singles, but picked off two of these runners, and no runner moved beyond 
first base. He struck out 9 Padres, and allowed no walks. Once again, the 
win by Medlen allowed the Braves to avoid being swept in a three-game series.[20] 
With this game, Medlen extended his streak of scoreless innings to 28-1/3. 
On September 3, 2012, Medlen faced the Colorado Rockies at Turner Field, 
and got the win in dominant fashion. Medlen pitched a complete game, allowing 
five hits and no walks while striking out a career-best 12 batters. He 
threw 111 pitches, with 88 of them being strikes.[21] Medlen's streak of 
consecutive scoreless innings came to an end (at 34-2/3 innings) in the 
7th inning when Carlos Gonzalez scored on an error by Paul Janish. This 
was the longest streak of consecutive scoreless innings for a Braves pitcher 
since Greg Maddux in 2000.[22] On September 8, 2012, Medlen faced the New 
York Mets at Citi Field, and recorded his 8th win of the season. Medlen 
had completed 6 innings, allowing 4 hits and 2 earned runs, when the game 
was delayed because of rain. Medlen did not return after the 75-minute 
delay, but got credit for the win in the 11-3 victory for the Braves.[23] 
When he allowed an earned run in the 4th inning, his streak of consecutive 
innings without an earned run ended at 40-1/3 innings. This streak had 
started at Citi Field on August 11. His streak of innings without allowing 
a home run ended at 53 innings, when Cedeno hit a home run in the 5th innings.[24] 
On September 14, 2012, Medlen got the start against the first-place Washington 
National, at Turner Field, and pitched 7.0 innings, leaving with the score 
tied at 1-1. In his 7 innings, Medlen allowed 5 hits and 1 walk, while 
recording 13 strike-outs, a career high. The Braves went on to win the 
game 2-1, with a run in the bottom of the ninth, winning their 20th consecutive 
game that Medlen had started. This 20 game streak was a franchise record 
for the Braves and tied a major record set by the New York Yankees and 
Roger Clemens in 2001.[25] Medlen had 8 called third strikes in the game, 
the most of any major league pitcher in 2012 and the most for any Braves 
pitcher since Greg Maddux in 2000.[26] On September 19, 2012, in Atlanta, 
Medlen pitched 8 scoreless innings, in a game that Atlanta won, 3-0. Medlen 
allowed 4 hits and 1 walk, while striking out 6 Marlins. In the 1st and 
5th innings, Marlin runners reached third base with only one out, but a 
strike-out followed by a ground-out and a pop-out followed by a grounder 
preserved the scorelsss game for Medlen.[27] With this win, the Braves 
had won 21 consecutive games started by Medlen, the most in major league 
baseball since the Yankees won 22 consecutive games started by Whitey Ford 
from 1950 through 1953, a span interrupted by his service during the Korean 
War.[28] On Sep 30, 2012, Medlen led the Braves to their 23rd consecutive 
victory in games that he started, as they beat the Mets, 6-2. Medlen pitched 
6 Innings, allowing 3 hits, 1 walk and 1 unearned run, while striking out 
4.[29] This established a new major league record in that category, according 
to mlb.com. Medlen started against the St. Louis Cardinals in the MLB's 
first ever single-game wild card playoff. On September 4, 2012, Medlen 
was named National League "Pitcher of the Month" for August 2012. In an 
article discussing the award, Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer David 
O'Brien pointed out that many commentators have been comparing Kris Medlen 
to the Braves' legendary pitcher, Greg Maddux.[30] Medlen "repeated" as 
National League "Pitcher of the Month" for September, becoming the first 
Braves pitcher to win this back-to-back since Greg Maddux, in June and 
July 2001.[31] On June 8, 2013, Medlen hit his first career home run. In 
2013, he went 15-12 with a 3.11 ERA in 32 games (31 starts). On March 9, 
2014, Medlen left a Spring training game due to a sore right elbow. The 
following day, he had MRIs which tested positive that there was ligament 
damage in the elbow. Trying to avoid surgery, he sought a second opinion 
with Dr. James Andrews. However, Dr. Andrews looked at Medlen's test results, 
and could only confirm Medlen's worst fears; Medlen needed a second Tommy 
John surgery, and as a result, Medlen missed the entire 2014 season.[32] 
Medlen became a free agent on December 2, 2014 after he was non-tendered 
by the Braves.[33] On December 18, 2014, he signed a two-year deal (with 
a mutual option for a third year) with the Kansas City Royals for a guaranteed 
$8.5 million.[34] He started the 2015 season on the 60-day disabled list 
to continue recovering from his second Tommy John surgery and made his 
first appearance for the Royals on July 20, 2015 against the Pirates. He 
made his first start for the Royals on Monday, August 24, 2015, against 
the Baltimore Orioles. He made 15 appearances (8 starts) in 2015 with a 
6-2 record and a 4.01 ERA. He was also part of the Royals postseason run 
as the team won the 2015 World Series over the New York Mets, their first 
championship in 30 years. On May 12, 2016, Medlen was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list due to right rotator cuff inflammation.[35] The Royals declined 
Medlen's 2017 option on November 4, making him a free agent.[36] Medlen 
mostly throws four pitches. He leads with a two-seam fastball in the 89–93 mph 
range, and he also has a four-seam fastball in that range. His off-speed 
pitches are a curveball (77–80) and changeup (80–83), which are used primarily 
against right-handers and left-handers, respectively. Lastly, Medlen throws 
a handful of sliders.[37] Medlen's highly effective changeup has a career 
whiff rate of 44%, among the highest rates for starting pitchers in the 
big leagues.[38] Hitters in the 2012 season hit only .098 against the pitch.[39] 
Medlen met his wife Nicki through former minor league teammate Ryne Reynoso, 
and married her in 2012.[40][41] They have two children.[42][43] Medlen
