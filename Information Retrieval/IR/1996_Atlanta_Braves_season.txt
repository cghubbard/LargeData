The 1996 Atlanta Braves baseball team secured a regular season record of 
96-66 and reached the World Series, where it lost to the New York Yankees 
in six games, failing to defend its championship in 1995. Despite taking 
a 2-0 lead the Braves unexpectedly lost the next 4 games. This World Series 
appearance was their fourth appearance in the last 5 years as a franchise. 
Atlanta won its seventh division title (second in the National League East, 
the other five in the NL West) and its fifth in six years. In the previous 
round, Atlanta completed a miraculous comeback. After trailing in the NLCS 
to St. Louis three games to one, Atlanta outscored St. Louis 32-1 in games 
five through seven to complete the comeback. The collapse was remembered 
as one of the largest in North American sports history. Infielders Coaches
