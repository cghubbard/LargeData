Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox pitched a perfect game against the 
Seattle Mariners by retiring all 27 batters he faced on April 21, 2012, 
as the White Sox defeated the Mariners 4–0. It was the 21st perfect game 
in Major League Baseball (MLB) history and the third by a member of the 
White Sox. It was Humber's first career complete game, although he had 
come close to achieving no-hitters on several occasions at several levels 
of organized baseball. The game was played in Seattle and broadcast regionally 
by Fox Sports in the two teams' metropolitan areas. Humber, a top pitching 
prospect from a Texas high school, attended Rice University, where he had 
a successful career. A high draft pick by the New York Mets, he debuted 
in MLB for the Mets before headlining a group of four prospects traded 
to the Minnesota Twins for Johan Santana. After two ineffective seasons 
with the Twins, Humber pitched a season for the Kansas City Royals. Acquired 
on waivers by the Chicago White Sox in 2011, Humber had his first successful 
season in an MLB starting rotation. The perfect game, Humber's 30th career 
start and his second of the 2012 season, totaled 96 pitches. Humber was 
named 2001 Texas High School Class 4A Player of the Year[1] and enrolled 
at Rice University for the next season. Humber flirted with a no-hitter 
in college, pitching for the Rice Owls baseball team. On April 6, 2002 
he held a no-hitter going into the eighth inning against the San Jose State 
Spartans baseball team. In that contest, he surrendered a pinch hit single 
in the eighth, but did not allow any runs until a ninth-inning home run.[2] 
"I mean, I can't even put it into words. I'm just so happy. There are so 
many good things happening right now. This just adds to the list." The 
New York Mets drafted Humber with the third overall draft choice in that 
year's amateur draft. After pitching in the minor leagues, he pitched in 
five games for the Mets during the 2006 and 2007 seasons.[4] He also came 
close to a no hitter in minor league baseball. On August 22, 2007 he pitched 
eight and one-third no-hit innings for the Class-AAA New Orleans Zephyrs 
of the Pacific Coast League against the Iowa Cubs.[5] Humber ended up with 
a no decision.[6] The Mets traded Humber along with Carlos Gómez, Kevin 
Mulvey, and Deolis Guerra for two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan 
Santana that offseason.[7] Humber pitched for the Twins in 2008 and 2009 
and then signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals after 
the 2009 season.[8] After pitching for Kansas City for 2010, the Oakland 
Athletics claimed him on waivers from the Royals, but waived him a week 
later, at which point he was taken by the Chicago White Sox.[9][10] Humber 
nearly achieved a no hitter for the 2011 Chicago White Sox twice. On April 
25, 2011, in the sixth start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the 
seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium but, with 
one out, Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle, leaving Humber to finish 
with seven scoreless innings.[11] Later that year he took a no-hitter into 
the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended 
up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to 
Danny Espinosa. In that contest, Jerry Hairston, Jr. broke up the no-hitter 
leading off the sixth after Roger Bernadina earned a hit by pitch to break 
up the perfect game in the fourth.[12] In 2011 Humber pitched a career-high 
163 innings, but expected to pitch more and build on his success with the 
departure of Mark Buehrle from the White Sox.[13] Although the 2012 Chicago 
White Sox' rotation was said to be made up of five number three starters,[14] 
Humber was the number five starter entering the season,[15] of which his 
perfect game was Humber's second start. Humber was scheduled to make his 
2012 season debut for the White Sox on April 10, but the game was rained 
out. He was then made available for middle relief.[16] In his season debut, 
on April 16, Humber allowed one run and ten baserunners in 5 1⁄3 innings, 
throwing 115 pitches.[17] "I don't know what Philip Humber is doing in 
this list. No idea what my name is doing there, but I'm thankful it's there." 
Humber's second start of the season took place on the road in Safeco Field 
in Seattle, Washington on April 21, 2012 and was played in front of a crowd 
of 22,472 people. The White Sox' catcher was A. J. Pierzynski and Humber's 
mound opponent, Blake Beavan, was a 2007 Texas high school player of the 
year.[18] The home plate, first, second, and third base umpires were Brian 
Runge, Marvin Hudson, Tim McClelland, and Ted Barrett respectively.[19] 
The game was broadcast on Fox, with Mariners' broadcaster Dave Sims and 
Eric Karros on the call and its duration was two hours, seventeen minutes. 
Eric Karros, before the game, describing Humber's previous few games, remarked, 
"Gotta be a little better today."[20] Beavan threw a quality start for 
Seattle,[18] while Humber retired all 27 batters he faced, as his fastball 
reached 92 miles per hour (148 km/h).[18] The closest a batter got to a 
hit was Dustin Ackley's fourth inning line drive over the head of right 
fielder Alex Ríos, which resulted in a warning track leaping catch.[18] 
The Mariners began talking about Humber's dominance in the fifth inning 
as they sought to break up the perfect game.[18] Humber recorded the final 
out on a check-swing strikeout of Brendan Ryan. The ball got away from 
catcher Pierzynski, but home plate umpire Runge ruled that Ryan had failed 
to check his swing. Ryan took steps toward first base but, when he saw 
that Pierzynski had successfully gathered the ball and thrown to first, 
he argued the call with Runge. The FOX Sports broadcast never showed any 
angle which definitively proved whether Ryan had successfully checked his 
swing, but many fans and media members felt the call was incorrect.[21][22] 
Ryan himself refused to discuss the play after the game and offered nothing 
but praise for Humber.[23] Humber finished the game with nine strikeouts; 
the other batters were retired with five groundouts and 13 flyouts.[3] 
Humber threw only 96 pitches, making this the first perfect game thrown 
in under 100 pitches since David Cone's perfect game on July 18, 1999. 
Humber had only started 29 Major League games prior to throwing his perfect 
game, making him the pitcher with the second fewest starts prior to throwing 
a perfect game, behind fellow White Sox player Charlie Robertson.[24] MLB.com 
has made available the video of the last out.[25] The game was only available 
on television in the Chicago and Seattle markets, because a game between 
the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, also on the 
network, was broadcast by more affiliates.[26][26][27] Games between those 
two rivals generate a great deal of interest and receive extensive media 
coverage, including being broadcast on national television.[28][29] Fox 
did, however, cut away from Yankees–Red Sox game, which was already in 
the seventh inning, to show the final three outs of Humber's perfect game, 
even in the Boston and New York markets.[26] It was the 21st perfect game 
in MLB history and the first since Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 
2010.[30] It was the third perfect game in White Sox history (tying them 
with the Yankees for most perfect games) after Charlie Robertson's (who 
threw the only other perfect game in April in MLB history) on April 30, 
1922 and Mark Buehrle's on July 23, 2009, and the 18th no-hitter in White 
Sox history (tying them with the Red Sox for second most no-hitters). It 
was Humber's second start of the 2012 season[30] and first career complete 
game.[3] Humber went 1–0 with a 0.63 ERA in 14 1⁄3 innings while striking 
out 16 over two starts that week, including the perfect game, resulting 
in his selection as American League Player of the Week for the week ending 
April 22.[31] He received a congratulatory phone call from President Barack 
Obama, a noted White Sox fan,[32] and received news that his perfect game 
would be memorialized with a plaque at the National Baseball Hall of Fame 
and Museum.[33] Humber made an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman 
on April 23, where he read the Top Ten List.[34] Humber became the seventh 
former member of the Mets to go on to throw a no-hitter for another team.[35] 
The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo 
Nomo and David Cone.[36] The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect 
game, had never had a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history 
of the franchise (Johan Santana has since accomplished this feat).[37][38] 
The Mariners went hitless for the third time in franchise history and this 
was the first time that no Mariner reached base.[39] However, they went 
on to pitch two no-hitters in 2012, both of which took place at Safeco 
Field and winning both games 1-0.[40] One of them was the first perfect 
game in franchise history, by Félix Hernández,[41] making them the first 
team to be on both the losing and winning end of a perfect game in the 
same season,[40][42] and marking the first time two perfect games were 
thrown in the same park in the same season.[43] Chicago White Sox 4, Seattle
