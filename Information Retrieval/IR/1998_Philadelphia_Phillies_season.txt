The first game of the Phillies season was an unforgettable opening day 
game at Shea Stadium against their division rival New York Mets. Both of 
them were involved in the longest scoreless opening day game in the National 
League and the longest one in the MLB since 1926 when the Washington Senators 
beat the Philadelphia Athletics 1–0 in 15 innings.[1][2] However, the Phillies 
lost the game 1–0 in 14 innings when Mets backup catcher Alberto Castillo 
delivered a full-count, two-out, pinch-hit single to right with the bases 
loaded off Philadelphia closer Ricky Bottalico.[2] This was the first regular 
season baseball game played in New York in March.[3] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
