Michael Stephen Lolich (born September 12, 1940) is an American former 
professional baseball player.[1] He played in Major League Baseball as 
a pitcher from 1962 until 1979, most notably for the Detroit Tigers.[1] 
He is best known for his performance in the 1968 World Series against the 
St. Louis Cardinals when he earned three complete-game victories, including 
a win over Bob Gibson in the climactic Game 7.[2] He is of Croatian origin.[3] 
Lolich was signed by the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent in 1958.[1] 
After five seasons in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut 
with the Tigers on May 12, 1963 at age 22.[1] He blossomed in 1964 with 
18 wins and 192 strikeouts in his first full major league season.[1] In 
1965, he fell to 14-14 but improved with 226 strikeouts, second best in 
the American League behind Sam McDowell.[4] In 1967, the Tigers hired former 
major league pitcher Johnny Sain as their pitching coach.[5] Sain helped 
develop Lolich's pitching skills and taught him psychological aspects of 
pitching.[2][5] The 1967 season was a memorable one for the tight four-way 
pennant race among the Tigers, the Boston Red Sox, the Minnesota Twins 
and the Chicago White Sox.[6] The Tigers were in contention until the final 
day of the season, finishing one game behind the Red Sox.[7] Lolich finished 
14-13, but led the league in shutouts with six.[1][8] In 1968, the Tigers 
quickly rose to first place, winning nine straight after losing the season 
opener to Boston.[9] Lolich was overshadowed by teammate Denny McLain's 
31-win season, and was sent to the bullpen in August due to a late-season 
slump.[2] He made six relief appearances before returning to the starting 
rotation.[2] He posted a 17-9 record with 197 strikeouts, as the Tigers 
won the American League pennant by 12 games over the second-place Baltimore 
Orioles.[1][10] After Gibson had defeated McLain in Game 1 of the 1968 
World Series in St. Louis, Lolich helped the Tigers recover by allowing 
only one run to win Game 2 by a score of 8-1.[11] He also helped his own 
cause by hitting the first and only home run of his 16-year career.[11] 
But the Tigers lost the next two games at home to fall behind the Cardinals 
3-1 and were facing elimination when Lolich returned to pitch in Game 5, 
just four days after pitching a complete game. Despite an unsettled start, 
when he surrendered a two-run home run to Orlando Cepeda in a three-run 
first inning, Lolich remained calm and proceeded to pitch eight scoreless 
innings as the Tigers scored two runs in the fourth and took the lead in 
the seventh on Al Kaline's bases loaded two-run single.[12] They added 
another run for a 5-3 win, staving off elimination.[11] Back in St. Louis, 
the Tigers then won Game 6 behind McLain's solid pitching and a grand slam 
home run from Jim Northrup in a Series-record-tying ten-run second inning 
rally to force a crucial Game 7.[13] With just three days of rest, and 
having pitched two complete games in the past seven days, Lolich faced 
Gibson in Game 7, both having won their previous two starts.[11] They each 
pitched six scoreless innings, Lolich picking off baserunners Lou Brock 
and Curt Flood to end a Cardinal threat in the bottom of the sixth, before 
the Tigers broke through with three runs in the top of the seventh starting 
with a two-out, two-run triple to deep center by Northrup just over Flood's 
head for an eventual 4-1 Tiger win and a 4-3 Series triumph.[2][14] Detroit 
became only the third team in World Series history to rally from a 3-1 
deficit to win in seven games.[11] Having completed game 7, Lolich became 
the 12th pitcher to win three games in a World Series, and the last with 
three complete games in a single Series.[2] He was the last pitcher with 
three wins in the same Series before Randy Johnson in 2001 for the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. Lolich's performance earned him the World Series Most Valuable 
Player Award.[15] Lolich was consistency itself, winning 14 or more games 
for ten consecutive seasons, climaxing in 1971 when he led the American 
League with 25 victories (which no subsequent Tiger pitcher has reached) 
and 308 strikeouts (also a Tiger record to this day). Lolich pitched a 
career-high and MLB-leading 376 innings in 1971, finishing as the AL Cy 
Young Award runner-up. He would win 22 games in 1972, helping the Tigers 
to the American League East championship that season and finishing 3rd 
for the AL Cy Young Award. The Tigers would bow to the eventual world champion 
Oakland A's, three games to two, in the American League Championship Series.[1] 
Lolich pitched superbly in both of his ALCS starts, but did not earn a 
win in either game. In Game 1, he pitched 10 innings of 1-run baseball 
before losing the game in the bottom of the 11th on an unearned run. He 
pitched nine innings in Game 4, again allowing only 1 run, but the win 
went to reliever John Hiller as the Tigers rallied in the 10th inning. 
Mickey struck out 200 or more batters in a season seven times in his career, 
and ranks third among left-handers (behind Steve Carlton and Randy Johnson) 
in career strikeouts with 2,832. After suffering through the 1975 season, 
in which he lost 18 games for a declining Tiger team, he was traded to 
the New York Mets with outfielder Billy Baldwin in exchange for star outfielder 
Rusty Staub and pitcher Bill Laxton.[1] Despite posting a decent 3.22 ERA 
for the Mets in 1976, Lolich went 8-13 and retired after the season.[1] 
He opened a doughnut shop in suburban Detroit and sat out the 1977 season. 
He returned to baseball in 1978, signing with the San Diego Padres as a 
free agent. He pitched mostly in relief for the 1978 and 1979 Padres teams 
before permanently retiring, holding at that time the major league record 
(and still the AL record as of the end of the 2012 season) for most career 
strikeouts by a southpaw. He was originally right-handed all the way, but 
a tricycle accident in early childhood forced him to throw left-handed 
from older childhood on. He batted right-handed and still writes with his 
right hand. He ran his doughnut shop in Lake Orion, Michigan (a small suburb 
roughly 40 miles north of Detroit) for several years before he sold the 
business and retired. He is still active in charity work, and serves as 
a coach at the Detroit Tigers' fantasy camp in Lakeland, Florida. Because 
of his humble "everyman" qualities, many long-time Tiger fans celebrate 
him as one of the most popular sports figures in a working man's city. 
As The Detroit News put it, "He didn't act like a big shot superstar, he 
was one of us."[16] In 2003, Lolich was one of 26 players chosen for the 
final ballot by the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee 
but garnered only 13 votes, far below the 75% required for election. A 
frequent claim of his is that never having won the Cy Young Award was a 
factor in his lack of success in Hall of Fame balloting (as of 2012). Lolich 
ranks among the Tigers' all-time leaders in many categories, including
