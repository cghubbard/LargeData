Jorge Luís Cantú Guzmán (born January 30, 1982) is a Mexican Major League 
Baseball third baseman who currently plays for the Toros de Tijuana of 
the Mexican League. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Cincinnati Reds, Florida Marlins, Texas Rangers and 
San Diego Padres and in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) for the Doosan 
Bears. He is married to Mexican entertainment journalist, Cynthia Urias. 
Cantú bats and throws right-handed. He was born in McAllen, Texas, went 
to Sharyland High School, but was raised and makes his home in Reynosa, 
Tamaulipas, Mexico.[1][2] Cantú was spotted by a scout while playing in 
a Junior Olympic tournament in Mexico City while in high school, and offered 
a contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at age 16. In 2003, Cantú played 
for the Mexico national team in the regional Olympic qualifying tournament. 
His team defeated the U.S. team, eliminating them from the 2004 summer 
games in Athens. Cantú made his major league debut with the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays in the 2004 season, batting .301 with two home runs and 17 runs batted 
in in 50 games played. In 2005, Cantú began the season expecting to play 
a utilityman role, but due to the retirement of second baseman Roberto 
Alomar during spring training, he became the full-time second baseman. 
He showcased his talents, having a breakout year, and was named the Devil 
Rays Most Valuable Player by Tampa Bay sportswriters, after hitting .289 
with 28 home runs, 117 RBIs, 40 doubles, and 171 hits in 150 games (80 
at second base, 63 at third). Cantú was a valuable young player for the 
rebuilding Devil Rays, who finished last in the American League that season. 
In 2006 however, he had a down year as he struggled with injuries. His 
production from the previous year dropped precipitously, as he hit just 
.249 with 14 home runs and 62 RBIs. The following season, he failed to 
make the Opening Day 25-man roster for 2007, and was assigned instead to 
the Triple-A Durham Bulls. He threatened not to report, and demanded a 
trade.[3] However, on the April 4, 2007, edition of ESPN's Baseball Tonight, 
Cantú retracted his trade demand and said he would voluntarily report to 
Durham. He hit just .207 with zero home runs and 4 RBIs in 25 games with 
Tampa Bay that year. On July 28, 2007 Cantú was traded to the Cincinnati 
Reds along with minor league outfielder Shaun Cumberland for pitchers Brian 
Shackelford and Calvin Medlock. With the Reds, he hit .298 with 1 home 
run and 9 RBI. During the 2007 season, he played primarily first base (as 
opposed to second base) as he played 21 games at first base, 2 games at 
second base and 1 game at third base (combined with Tampa Bay and Cincinnati). 
The Reds released him during the offseason on December 5 of that year. 
On January 4, 2008, the Florida Marlins signed Cantú to a minor league 
contract with an invitation to spring training. On March 22, Jose Castillo 
was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants, opening the door for 
a possible roster spot for Cantú.[4] Cantú was added to the active roster 
on March 27. Cantú impressed the Marlins so much during spring training 
that he was named the team's starting third baseman. He spent the season 
hitting third in the Marlins lineup. On September 12, Cantú hit his 25th 
home run of the season joining Hanley Ramírez, Dan Uggla, and Mike Jacobs 
as the first group of infielders on the same team to have 25 or more home 
runs. Cantú finished the year with a career high 29 home runs, 95 RBI, 
and a .277 batting Average. In the offseason Cantú signed a 1-year, $4.5 
million contract, avoiding arbitration. After spring training 2009, the 
Marlins announced that they would shift Cantú to first base after Gaby 
Sánchez struggled in the spring, and Emilio Bonifacio would play third 
base.[5] Cantú's left wrist was injured during the third game of the 2009 
season and he was forced to miss five games. He played well after returning 
to the lineup despite lingering pain. On May 4, he was named the National 
League Player of the Week.[6] Cantú started the 2010 season with a 21-game 
hitting streak[7] Cantú hit his 100th career home run on June 23, 2010. 
On July 29, 2010, Cantú was dealt to the Texas Rangers (with $600,000 cash) 
for Evan Reed and Omar Poveda.[8] Though he was a good home run and RBI 
hitter when in Florida, Cantú did not hit a single home run or RBI in his 
first 83 plate appearances for the Rangers. However, on September 25, he 
got his first RBI, and later his first home run, the latter giving his 
team a 4–3 lead, which turned out to be the final score, clinching the 
Rangers' their first divisional title since 1999. That year he played in 
the World Series with the Rangers. Cantú signed a one-year deal with the 
San Diego Padres on January 26, 2011.[9] He was designated for assignment 
on June 15[10] and released on June 21.[11] On July 30, 2011, Jorge Cantú 
was signed by the Colorado Rockies to a minor league contract.[citation

never called up to the Majors. On January 6, 2012, Cantù signed a minor 
league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[12] He played in 
24 games for the Salt Lake Bees. He was released on April 30, 2012. On 
March, 2013, Jorge signed with the Tigers de Quintana Roo Mexican team. 
Due to an injury he was limited throughout the season but still led the 
team with 31 Home Runs in 83 games. He played first base and DH, leading 
the team to a Championship. In 2014 he played in Korea with the Bears. 
For the 2015 season, Cantú came back to play in Mexico, and led the Tigres 
de Quintana Roo to another title run. During the season he won a Home Run 
Derby Title and was an All-Star. This year saw a slight decline in home 
runs, hitting just 25 for the year, but finishing up with 100 RBI's for 
the regular season with 75 runs in 106 games played. The Mexican Beaseball 
League is an affiliate of the Minor League Baseball system and considered
