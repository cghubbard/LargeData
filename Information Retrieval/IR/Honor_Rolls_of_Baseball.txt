The Honor Rolls of Baseball were established in 1946 by the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame and Museum's Permanent Committee to establish as a second 
level of induction designed to recognize non-playing contributors.[1] The 
committee designed the Honor Rolls to commemorate managers, executives, 
umpires and sportswriters, as an addition to their regular vote of old-time 
players.[2] Though sportswriter Henry Chadwick was elected in 1938, the 
Hall had not devised a plan to extend recognition to these contributors, 
and this was the first attempt.[2] On April 23, 1946, the Permanent Committee 
voted to induct 11 players into the Baseball Hall of Fame, along with 39 
non-players into the Honor Rolls, separated into their respective category. 
This second-tier list consisted of 5 managers, 11 umpires, 11 executives
