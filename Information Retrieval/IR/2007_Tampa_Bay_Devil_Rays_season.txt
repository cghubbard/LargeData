The Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 2007 season, the 10th season in franchise history, 
involved the Devil Rays trying to improve on their 2006 season, where they 
finished last in the American League East Division, and managed to finish 
the season with a league-worst record of 69-96. During the offseason they 
signed Japanese infielder Akinori Iwamura to a three-year deal. Their manager 
was Joe Maddon who entered his 2nd season with the Devil Rays. Although 
the Devil Rays again finished last in the division, they improved their 
record by five games, to 66-96. Their season attendance increased by 18,653 
to 1,387,603. This marks the first time home attendance has increased in 
consecutive seasons. Joe Maddon's option years through 2009 were picked 
up by the club on September 8, 2007. The season was marked by incredible 
pitching performances by club ace Scott Kazmir and rookie James Shields, 
and the bats of club standby Carl Crawford; rookies Delmon Young, B.J. 
Upton and Brendan Harris; and free agents Akinori Iwamura and Carlos Peña. 
Several club single-season records fell during the course of the season. 
This was also the last season with the team being named the Devil Rays. 
The team dropped the "Devil" from the name. Out of nowhere, the following 
year the team would win the AL East, beating the usual contenders, the 
Yankees and the Red Sox. The team would win the pennant, but lost to the 
Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. The Devil Rays opened their 
2007 season April 2, on the road against the defending division champion 
New York Yankees. The bullpen blew a lead and Tampa Bay lost, 9-5,[1] but 
came back to win the third game, 7-6 (the second of the opening series 
was rained out). They suffered a setback in the middle of April when new 
third baseman Iwamura, off to a hot start with a .339 batting average to 
that point, suffered an oblique strain and went on the disabled list.[2] 
However, the team continued to play better than in past years, and on May 
4 moved into a tie for second place, the latest that Tampa Bay had been 
that high in the standings since the 1999 season.[3] The Rays trailed off 
going into May, falling eventually back into last place, but surged into 
their series in Orlando, Florida, against the Texas Rangers, which they 
swept. After the series with the Rangers, they won only one of the next 
seven games, skidding to a then season low, nine games below .500. After 
a 9-4 win against the Dodgers to improve their record to 33-40 on June 
24, the Devil Rays went on to lose 11 straight games and went on to lose 
13 of 14 games since the Dodgers series and went into the All-Star Break 
34-53. After the break it wasn't much better losing 3 games out of 4 against 
the Yankees in their 1st series after the break and went on to lose 8 straight 
games between July 21 to 28. The low point of that Losing streak were two 
dismal losses to the Yankees. One game losing 17-5 and the other 21-4. 
The Rays' lack of pitching between their two aces and closer Al Reyes led 
to the coining of the idiom, "Kazmir and Shields, then off come the wheels." 
For the Devil Rays it was a July to forget but things were getting better 
in August. Improvements made to the bullpen at the trade deadline led to 
shorter losing streaks and, eventually, more series wins. On August 11, 
Starting pitcher Edwin Jackson pitched the Devil Rays 1st complete game 
shutout of the year in a 3-0 win against the Rangers. On August 25, Pitcher 
Scott Kazmir went 8 innings with a career high 13 strikeouts in a 14-3 
win against the Oakland Athletics and in that series the Rays took 3 of 
4 games out scoring the A's 33 to 9 in the last three games of that series. 
The hot streak continued with a sweep of the tailspinning Baltimore Orioles 
and series wins at the Yankees and home against the Orioles and the Blue 
Jays before finally losing 2 of 3 at the Boston Red Sox and splitting a 
4-game series at the Seattle Mariners. Their September upswing ensured 
that they would finish the 2007 season with a better record than the 2006 
season. They did, however, hobble into the end of the season, with Carl 
Crawford's season-ending groin pull in late-September contributing to a 
5-13 finish. They did win their final game of the season, though, giving 
hope for next year. Andy Sonnanstine broke a team record with seven consecutive 
strikeouts on June 10 in a victory over the Florida Marlins, his first 
win of the season. On September 3, Carlos Peña broke the club single-season 
home run record, previously 34, held by José Canseco (1999) and Aubrey 
Huff (2003). Peña's 35th was a two-run homer off Jim Hoey in the seventh 
inning of a 9-7 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. On September 16, he 
became the first Rays player to hit 40 home runs in a season, the 40th 
being a leadoff homer coming off Jarrod Washburn in the 4th inning of a 
9-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. His 45th home run came off Dustin 
McGowan in the 5th inning of a 5-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays; it was 
the second of back-to-back homers, following Jorge Velandia's second homer 
of the season. On September 27, Peña took the RBI record, previously set 
by Jorge Cantú at 117 in 2005. He tied it with an RBI single in the 1st 
inning for his 117th, and broke it with a solo home run in the 5th inning 
for his 118th. Both RBIs were off Chien-Ming Wang in a 12-4 loss to the 
New York Yankees. He finished the season with 46 home runs, 121 RBIs and 
a 1.037 OPS (.411 OBP, .627 SLG, both Rays season records), becoming the 
first Devil Ray to finish a season with at least a 1.000 OPS. Peña went 
on to win Comeback Player of the Year honors for the American League. Carl 
Crawford approached the 1,000-hit plateau, but a groin pull in late September 
ended his season early, leaving him stuck at 990 career hits. He will most 
likely become the first Devil Ray to hit 1,000 hits with the club early 
next season. It will not be the first four-digit hit milestone for the 
club; Wade Boggs got his 3,000th hit while with the team in 1999. His injury, 
however, did not prevent him from finishing the season with a share of 
the AL stolen base title with Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles. Both 
players finished the year with 50, marking the fourth time he's led or 
shared the lead in that category for a year. Delmon Young became the first 
Rays rookie to play in every game of a 162-game season, setting a team 
record for most at bats taken in a season with 645. He is the second Rays 
player ever to play in every game in a season, after Aubrey Huff in 2003. 
Young was held from the lineup for the last game of the season after not 
hustling to first on a ground ball during the previous game, but apologized 
for not giving that game his all and entered the final game as a mid-game 
replacement. At the end of the season, he was considered a leading candidate 
for the AL Rookie of the Year award. On September 10, Scott Kazmir became 
the first Rays pitcher to record 200 strikeouts in a season, in a 1-0 victory 
over the Boston Red Sox. His 200th strikeout victim for the year was Coco 
Crisp. He ultimately claimed the A.L. strikeout title, finishing the year 
with 239. (A one-game playoff permitted Jake Peavy to take the MLB strikeout 
title with 240.) Kazmir is also the first D-Ray starter to finish a season 
with at least 10 strikeouts per 9 innings (10.41). During the course of 
the season, Scott Kazmir became the first Rays starting pitcher to log 
enough starts and innings to begin compiling rate-based team all-time pitching 
records, such as ERA. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]
