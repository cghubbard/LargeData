The 1987 Detroit Tigers season saw the Tigers make a startling late-season 
comeback to win the American League Eastern Division. The Tigers finished 
with a record of 98 wins and 64 losses, two games ahead of the Toronto 
Blue Jays. Detroit lost the American League Championship Series to the 
Minnesota Twins in 5 games. After their 1984 championship season, the Tigers 
finished in third place in the AL East in both 1985 and 1986. The 1987 
Tigers faced lowered expectations â€“ which seemed to be confirmed by an 
11-19 start to the season. The team hit its stride thereafter and gradually 
gained ground on its AL East rivals. This charge was fueled in part by 
the acquisition of pitcher Doyle Alexander from the Atlanta Braves in exchange 
for minor league pitcher John Smoltz. Alexander started 11 games for the 
Tigers, posting 9 wins without a loss and a 1.53 ERA. The deal came at 
a price. Smoltz, a Lansing, Michigan native, went on to have a long, productive 
career with the Braves winning a Cy Young Award and eventually gaining 
entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. Despite their improvement, 
they entered September neck-and-neck with the Toronto Blue Jays. The two 
teams would square off in seven hard-fought games during the final two 
weeks of the season. All seven games were decided by one run, and in the 
first six of the seven games, the winning run was scored in the final inning 
of play. At Exhibition Stadium, the Tigers dropped three in a row to the 
Blue Jays before winning a dramatic extra-inning showdown. The Tigers entered 
the final week of the 1987 season 3.5 games behind. After a series against 
the Baltimore Orioles, the Tigers returned home trailing by a game and 
swept the Blue Jays. Detroit clinched the division in a 1-0 victory over 
Toronto in front of 51,005 fans at Tiger Stadium on Sunday afternoon, October 
4. Frank Tanana went all nine innings for the complete game shutout, and 
outfielder Larry Herndon gave the Tigers their lone run on a second-inning 
home run. Detroit finished the season a Major League-best 98-64, two games 
ahead of Toronto. In what would prove to be their last postseason appearance 
until 2006, the Tigers lost the 1987 American League Championship Series 
to the underdog Minnesota Twins (who would go on to win the World Series) 
in five games. The 1987 Tigers' winning percentage ranks as the 10th best 
in team history, as follows: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
