then Cubs third base coach Chris Speier. Speier was out for three games 
of third base/coaching duties because of a DUI. In October 2006, Quade 
was named one of the five finalists for the 2007 Chicago Cubs managerial

league candidates interviewed for the job opening.[4] Instead, Lou Piniella 
came out of retirement to accept the job. Quade was subsequently promoted 
to serve as the third base coach for the Cubs. Quade was promoted to serve 
as interim manager of the Cubs after Piniella's sudden retirement on August 
22, 2010.[5] On Oct. 19, the "interim" label was removed from his job title, 
and he was given a two-year contract with a club option for a third year 
to remain as manager of the Cubs.[6] On November 2, 2011, however, Quade 
was terminated as manager by Theo Epstein, Cubs president of baseball operations.[7] 
In 2013, the New York Yankees hired Quade as a roving outfield and baserunning
