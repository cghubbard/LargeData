Rutherford is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 18,061,[13][14][15] 
reflecting a decline of 49 (−0.3%) from the 18,110 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 320 (+1.8%) from the 17,790 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[24] Rutherford was formed as a borough by an act of 
the New Jersey Legislature on September 21, 1881, from portions of Union 
Township, based on the results of a referendum held on the previous day.[25] 
The borough was named for John Rutherfurd, a U.S. Senator who owned land 
in the area.[26][27] Rutherford has been called the "Borough of Trees"[28] 
and "The First Borough of Bergen County".[29] The ridge above the New Jersey 
Meadowlands upon which Rutherford sits was settled by Lenape Native Americans 
long before the arrival of Walling Van Winkle in 1687. Union Avenue, which 
runs from the Meadowlands to the Passaic River, may have been an Indian 
trail, but was more likely a property boundary line; it was referenced 
in the 1668 grant of land by proprietary Governor Philip Carteret to John 
Berry. During the early days of settlement, the land that is now Rutherford 
was part of New Barbadoes Township, as Berry had lived in Barbados, another 
English colony, before claiming his grant in New Jersey. New Barbadoes 
was part of Essex County from 1693 to 1710, when Bergen County was formed. 
In 1826, the land became part of Lodi Township (of which today's remaining 
portion is now South Hackensack). When Hudson County was formed in 1840, 
the area that is today North Arlington, Lyndhurst, Rutherford and East 
Rutherford became part of Harrison Township (of which today's remaining 
portion is Harrison town). However, the area reverted to Bergen County 
in 1852 and became known as Union Township.[25] Part of the region was 
known as Boiling Springs for a powerful and ceaseless spring located in 
the vicinity. Despite its name, the spring actually consisted of cold groundwater 
seeps rather than hot springs.[30] The Erie Railroad built its Main Line 
from Jersey City across the Meadowlands in the 1840s. Daniel Van Winkle, 
a descendant of Walling, donated land in 1866 for a train station at Boiling 
Springs. Several resorts were built along the Passaic, with guests disembarking 
at Boiling Springs station and taking Union Avenue to the river. Later, 
the railroad opened a station closer to the river, at Carlton Hill. At 
the time, much of the property in Rutherford was farmland owned by the 
estate of John Rutherfurd, a former New Jersey legislator and U.S. Senator, 
whose homestead was along the Passaic River, near present-day Rutherford 
Avenue.[31] Van Winkle opened a real estate office at Depot Square (now 
Station Square) to sell the land of the Rutherfurd Park Association, and 
began to lay out the area's street grid. The main roads were Orient Way, 
a wide boulevard heading south-southwest from Station Square, and Park 
Avenue, which headed west-southwest from Station Square to bring traffic 
to the new Valley Brook Race Course in what is now Lyndhurst. In the 1870s, 
the area began to be called "Rutherford". The definitive reason for the 
change in spelling of the final syllable from "furd" to "ford" is unknown, 
though the change may have been the result of name recognition of the Ohio 
politician Rutherford B. Hayes, who was elected President in 1876, or could 
have been because of a clerical error done by the United States Postal 
Service.[32] The Post Office opened a facility called "Rutherford" in 1876. 
On September 21, 1881, the Borough of Rutherford was formed by formal vote 
of secession from Union Township.[25] By then, the community had about 
1,000 residents. Rutherford is home to the following locations on the National 
Register of Historic Places: According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the borough has a total area of 2.942 square miles (7.618 km2), including 
2.806 square miles (7.267 km2) of land and 0.136 square miles (0.352 km2) 
of water (4.61%).[4][5] Rutherford is an inner-ring suburb of New York 
City, located 8 miles (13 km) west of Midtown Manhattan.[38] The borough 
is bounded by the Passaic River bordering Clifton and Passaic to the west, 
the Erie Railroad bordering East Rutherford to the north and east, the 
Hackensack River bordering Secaucus to the southeast, and Berrys Creek, 
Wall Street West and Rutherford Avenue bordering Lyndhurst to the south 
and southwest.[39] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 18,061 
people, 6,949 households, and 4,663 families residing in the borough. The 
population density was 6,437.4 per square mile (2,485.5/km2). There were 
7,278 housing units at an average density of 2,594.1 per square mile (1,001.6/km2). 
The racial makeup of the borough was 77.57% (14,010) White, 2.92% (527)

living together, 10.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 32.9% were non-families. 27.4% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 9.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The

100 females there were 92.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 90.2 males.[13] The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community 
Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household 
income was $85,783 (with a margin of error of +/− $4,632) and the median 
family income was $104,293 (+/− $6,102). Males had a median income of $70,071 
(+/− $8,275) versus $55,080 (+/− $4,045) for females. The per capita income 
for the borough was $41,662 (+/− $3,383). About 3.6% of families and 4.6% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.5% of those 
under age 18 and 5.3% of those age 65 or over.[50] Same-sex couples headed 
65 households in 2010, an increase from the 48 counted in 2000.[51] As 
of the 2000 United States Census[21] there were 18,110 people, 7,055 households, 
and 4,670 families residing in the borough. The population density was 
6,451.7 people per square mile (2,488.4/km2). There were 7,214 housing 
units at an average density of 2,570.0 per square mile (991.2/km2). The 
racial makeup of the borough was 81.99% White, 2.70% African American, 
0.04% Native American, 11.34% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.86% from 
other races, and 2.03% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any

out of which 28.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 53.5% 
were married couples living together, 9.2% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 33.8% were non-families. 28.3% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 10.7% had someone living alone who was

of families and 3.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
3.1% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those age 65 or over.[48][49] Rutherford 
is the site of Architectural Window Manufacturing Corporation's plant[52] 
and Boiling Springs Savings Bank's corporate headquarters.[53] Rutherford, 
together with Lyndhurst and North Arlington, was the site of the EnCap 
project, an effort to remediate landfills on the 785-acre (3.18 km2) site 
and construct homes and golf courses on top of the remediated site. On 
May 27, 2008, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission terminated its agreement 
with EnCap Golf Holdings, the company that had the contract to redevelop 
the site, after the company had missed targets to clean up the landfills 
as part of the project.[54] The Highland Cross Development is a proposed 
project that is to consist of 800 units of housing, including 160 affordable 
units, two hotels and a large retail component. Rutherford officials have 
been working to get approval for the project in the face of opposition 
from the 14 mayors of the Hackensack Meadowlands Municipal Committee.[55] 
William Carlos Williams, the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet who died in 1963, 
was born in Rutherford in 1883. For most of his adult life, he maintained 
a physician's office in the house in which he lived, at 9 Ridge Road, at 
the corner of Park Avenue, even as he continued his artistic endeavors.[56] 
The Rivoli Theatre was opened in 1922 as a vaudeville house but was quickly 
converted into a movie palace. It was known for a large crystal chandelier 
suspended from the center of the auditorium. On January 9, 1977, the Rivoli 
was severely damaged in a fire.[57] Soon afterward, a plan was developed 
to restore the Rivoli and turn it into a performing arts center. The William 
Carlos Williams Center for the Performing Arts opened in 1981 and contains 
three movie screens as well as two performance halls.[58] Since 1995, the 
Williams Center's primary focus has been on concerts, ballet, opera, and 
theater for children. The Meadowlands Museum, which focuses on local history 
and began as a project of parents of children in the public schools in 
1961 and was originally based in a room at Sylvan School,[59] moved to 
the Yereance-Berry House at 91 Crane Avenue in 1974. The GFWC Woman's Club 
of Rutherford is a non-profit volunteer organization that was organized 
in 1889. The club is located in the former Iviswold carriage house.[60] 
Rutherford holds an annual street fair on Labor Day which is the longest 
running street fair in New Jersey and usually attracts 20,000 people.[61][62] 
The first annual Rutherford West End Festival was held October 3, 2009, 
in the West End section of town.[63] The Rutherford Multicultural Festival 
is an annual event that provides traditional entertainment and food from 
around the world.[64] Rutherford Memorial Park, in the northwest corner 
of town along the Passaic, was set aside as parkland by the voters in 1951. 
Its 30 acres (120,000 m2) include two baseball diamonds, five softball 
diamonds, a Little League Baseball field, a football stadium, five tennis 
courts, two basketball courts, and three playgrounds. Other active recreation 
parks include Tamblyn Field, near Route 3.[65] The borough also has several 
smaller passive parks, including Lincoln Park across from borough hall, 
which was renovated in 2004. It includes a band shell and several monuments, 
including a cannon dating to the Spanish–American War, and is home to the 
borough's 9/11 memorial, containing a piece of steel debris recovered from 
the site of the attacks.[66] Sunset Park is located just north of the intersection 
of Union and Jackson Avenues and is on the western-facing side of a rather 
steep hill. A plan to redesign the park is currently being developed.[67] 
Firefighters' Memorial Park is a pocket park located at the intersection 
of Park and Mortimer Avenues.[68] Lincoln Park has been host to town events, 
concerts, and memorials for decades. The Rutherford Community Band plays 
concerts during the summer. Other summer concerts are sponsored by the 
borough, as well as several movie nights in the park. In the fall, it has 
hosted the Bergen County Cultural Festival, which is funded and run by 
the Civil Rights Commission. The Nereid Boat Club occupies a former boat 
sales building on the Passaic, at the foot of Newell Avenue. The rowing 
club, established in Nutley in 1875, relocated to Rutherford in 1996.[69] 
Rutherford is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan 
basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly 
by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[11] 
The Borough form of government used by Rutherford, the most common system 
used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which 
council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at 
meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[70][71] The Borough operates with numerous committees to assist 
the government in carrying out its responsibilities. In addition to statutory 
bodies such as the planning board and zoning board of adjustment, dozens 
of volunteers staff other committees appointed annually, providing recommendations 
to the council. As of 2016[update], the Mayor of the Borough of Rutherford 
is Republican Joseph DeSalvo Jr., whose term of office ends December 31, 
2019. Members of the Rutherford Borough Council are Council President Frank 
Nunziato (R, 2018), Jack Manzo (R, 2016), Stephanie McGowan (D, 2017), 
Mark O'Connor (R, 2016), Carolyn Smith (D, 2017) and Sean Walker (D, 2018).[6][8][72][73][74][75] 
Rutherford is located in the 9th Congressional District[76] and is part 
of New Jersey's 36th state legislative district.[14][77][78] New Jersey's 
Ninth Congressional District is represented by Bill Pascrell (D, Paterson).[79] 
New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, 
Newark, term ends 2021)[80] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[81][82] 
For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 36th Legislative 
District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate 
by Paul Sarlo (D, Wood-Ridge) and in the General Assembly by Marlene Caride 
(D, Ridgefield) and Gary Schaer (D, Passaic).[83] The Governor of New Jersey 
is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[84] The Lieutenant Governor of 
New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[85] Bergen County is governed 
by a directly elected County Executive, with legislative functions performed 
by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[86] As of 2015[update], 
the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; term ends December 
31, 2018).[87] The seven freeholders are elected at-large in partisan elections 
on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election each 
year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman Pro Tempore selected 
from among its members at a reorganization meeting held each January.[88] 
Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman Joan Voss (D, 2017; 
Fort Lee),[89] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; North Arlington)[90] 
Chairman Pro Tempore John A. Felice (R, 2016; River Edge),[91] David L. 
Ganz (D, 2017; Fair Lawn),[92] Maura R. DeNicola (R, 2016; Franklin Lakes)[93] 
Thomas J. Sullivan Jr., (D, Montvale, 2015; serving the unexpired term 
of office that had been occupied by James Tedesco before he was sworn in 
as County Executive)[94][95] and Tracy Silna Zur (D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[96][97] 
Countywide constitutional officials are County Clerk John S. Hogan (D, 
Northvale),[98] Sheriff Michael Saudino (R)[99] and Surrogate Michael R. 
Dressler (D, Cresskill).[100][101][86] As of March 23, 2011, there were 
a total of 10,609 registered voters in Rutherford, of which 3,436 (32.4% 
vs. 31.7% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 2,287 (21.6% vs. 21.1%) 
were registered as Republicans and 4,875 (46.0% vs. 47.1%) were registered 
as Unaffiliated. There were 11 voters registered to other parties.[102] 
Among the borough's 2010 Census population, 58.7% (vs. 57.1% in Bergen 
County) were registered to vote, including 74.3% of those ages 18 and over 
(vs. 73.7% countywide).[102][103] In the 2012 presidential election, Democrat 
Barack Obama received 4,771 votes (57.7% vs. 54.8% countywide), ahead of 
Republican Mitt Romney with 3,313 votes (40.1% vs. 43.5%) and other candidates 
with 111 votes (1.3% vs. 0.9%), among the 8,266 ballots cast by the borough's 
11,229 registered voters, for a turnout of 73.6% (vs. 70.4% in Bergen County).[104][105] 
In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obamareceived 4,824 
votes (53.7% vs. 53.9% countywide), ahead of Republican John McCain with 
3,973 votes (44.2% vs. 44.5%) and other candidates with 117 votes (1.3% 
vs. 0.8%), among the 8,984 ballots cast by the borough's 11,275 registered 
voters, for a turnout of 79.7% (vs. 76.8% in Bergen County).[106][107] 
In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 4,539 votes 
(52.2% vs. 51.7% countywide), ahead of Republican George W. Bush with 4,030 
votes (46.3% vs. 47.2%) and other candidates with 96 votes (1.1% vs. 0.7%), 
among the 8,698 ballots cast by the borough's 11,077 registered voters, 
for a turnout of 78.5% (vs. 76.9% in the whole county).[108] In the 2013 
gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie received 56.6% of the 
vote (2,918 cast), ahead of Democrat Barbara Buono with 42.2% (2,174 votes), 
and other candidates with 1.1% (59 votes), among the 5,299 ballots cast 
by the borough's 10,653 registered voters (148 ballots were spoiled), for 
a turnout of 49.7%.[109][110] In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Democrat 
Jon Corzine received 2,910 ballots cast (48.0% vs. 48.0% countywide), ahead 
of Republican Chris Christie with 2,642 votes (43.6% vs. 45.8%), Independent 
Chris Daggett with 421 votes (6.9% vs. 4.7%) and other candidates with

10,957 registered voters, yielding a 55.3% turnout (vs. 50.0% in the county).[111] 
As of May 2010[update], the borough had a total of 46.84 miles (75.38 km) 
of roadways, of which 36.52 miles (58.77 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
6.48 miles (10.43 km) by Bergen County, 3.36 miles (5.41 km) by the New 
Jersey Department of Transportation and 0.48 miles (0.77 km) by the New 
Jersey Turnpike Authority.[112] In the 1920s, the original Route 17 came 
through downtown Rutherford. Following the 1927 New Jersey State Highway 
renumbering, the new NJ 2 (later NJ 17) was built in 1928, skirting the 
southeast edge of the borough, between the residential area and the New 
Jersey Meadowlands. In 1948, a new bypass road along the southwest edge 
of the borough was built to bring traffic from Clifton and points west 
to the Lincoln Tunnel. The construction of the highway spur Route S3 (now 
Route 3) caused the demolition or relocation of numerous borough homes. 
In 2013, the Route 3 bridge over the Passaic River was replaced, and further 
improvements were made to the Rutherford section of the highway. Union 
Avenue Bridge over the Passaic was replaced in 2002.[113] A short portion 
of the New Jersey Turnpike Western Spur (Interstate 95) passes through 
the southern section of Rutherford, but the closest interchange is located 
in neighboring East Rutherford (exit 16W). Thanks to its easy access to 
New York City by rail, Rutherford became an early bedroom community. Following 
the initial wave of settlement in the late 19th century, an additional 
building boom occurred in the 1920s, when the majority of the borough's 
current housing stock was constructed. Public Service Railway brought trolley 
lines into Rutherford around the start of the 20th century. The lines extended 
east to Jersey City, south to Newark, north to Hackensack, and west to 
Passaic. By the late 1940s, the trolleys were replaced by bus service. 
After the opening of the Lincoln Tunnel in 1937, the Inter-City Bus Company 
began bus service direct from Paterson to New York City. The line was taken 
over by NJ Transit in the early 1980s. Today, NJ Transit offers service 
to and from New York City's Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan 
on several routes. The 163 offers rush hour service only, as Rutherford 
is not typically along its route. The 190 offers local service along Union 
Avenue and Orient Way. The 191, 192 and 195 routes all serve the portion 
of Rutherford that is adjacent to NJ-3, as well as the portion of NJ-17 
that goes through Rutherford. The 76 bus provides service between Hackensack 
and Newark.[114][115] Rutherford's train station, which was built by the 
Erie Railroad in 1898, serves passengers on NJ Transit's Bergen County 
Line.[116] Service is available to Suffern and various stations along Metro-North 
Railroad's Port Jervis Line, as well as all other Bergen County Line stations 
as Rutherford is the last stop before Secaucus Junction. Service is also 
provided to Hoboken Terminal with connections to Hudson–Bergen Light Rail, 
PATH, and NY Waterway service, and customers can connect at Secaucus for 
trains to New York Penn Station, Newark Liberty International Airport, 
and points west and south along the Morris & Essex Lines, North Jersey 
Coast Line, Northeast Corridor Line, and Montclair-Boonton Line. Access 
to the Raritan Valley Line is available at either Hoboken or at Newark 
Penn Station via Secaucus.[117] The Rutherford Police Department (RPD) 
provides emergency and protective services to the borough of Rutherford. 
The RPD consists of 33 officers and five cadets currently in training. 
The current chief is John Russo who was appointed on March 26, 2013. The 
RPD responds to approximately 11,000 calls per year and conducts criminal 
investigations through its detective bureau.[118] The police department 
was originally organized in June 1879 as the Rutherford Protective and 
Detective Association.[119] The Rutherford Fire Department (RFD) is an 
all-volunteer fire department. The RFD was organized in May 1871 and consists 
of one Chief, one deputy chief and three assistant chiefs. There are five 
fire companies in three fire houses. Each company has a Captain and a Lieutenant. 
The department is staffed by 75 fully trained firefighters. The RFD utilizes 
three Engines, a Ladder truck, a Heavy Rescue, a Special Service Unit and 
two boats.[120] Two of Rutherford's firefighters—Edwin L. Ward in 1965 
and Thomas E. Dunn in 1994—have died in the line of duty.[121] The Rutherford 
First Aid-Ambulance Corps is a volunteer service that was organized in 
1949. The corp consists of 40 members that operate under the supervision 
of the Captain, First Lieutenant and Second Lieutenant. The corps provides 
basic life support, and is staffed primarily by certified Emergency Medical 
Technicians. CPR-trained drivers are also sometimes on duty. They operate 
three Type III ambulances.[122] The Rutherford School District serves the 
borough's public school students in Kindergarten through twelfth grade. 
Public education began in Rutherford prior to 1900, but the oldest school 
structure that is still standing is the former Park School, built in 1902. 
It is currently the home of the Rutherford borough hall, on Park Avenue. 
As of the 2011–12 school year, the district's five schools had an enrollment 
of 2,480 students and 194.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a 
student–teacher ratio of 12.75:1.[123] The schools in the district (with 
2010–11 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics[124]) 
are Lincoln School[125] (grades K–3; 371 students), Washington School[126] 
(K–3; 346), Pierrepont School[127] (4–8; 508), Union School[128] (4–8; 
497) and Rutherford High School[129] (9–12; 758).[130] Rutherford formerly 
had three "neighborhood" schools for grades K–5 (Washington, Lincoln, and 
Sylvan) which fed into two "magnet" schools for 6-8. The magnet schools 
also served as elementary schools for their neighborhoods. Sylvan School 
was closed at the end of the 2004–2005 school year and has become a handicapped 
preschool, as well as office space for the special services department. 
Public school students from the borough, and all of Bergen County, are 
eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen 
County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in 
Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district 
offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based 
on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student's 
home school district.[131][132] St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church was established 
in Rutherford in the 1890s and opened a school shortly thereafter. The 
parish offers The Academy at Saint Mary for preschool through eighth grade[133] 
and St. Mary High School, founded in 1929.[134] Both schools are operated 
under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[135] In 
1942, Fairleigh Dickinson University was founded in Rutherford as a two-year 
college, anchored by the Iviswold Castle on Montross Avenue, which was 
built in the 1880s as a summer home by David B. Ivison. After FDU expanded
