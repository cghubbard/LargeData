Home Away The Caracas Base Ball Club (CBC) (English: Caracas Lions) is 
a Venezuelan baseball team that currently plays in the Venezuelan Professional 
Baseball League. Cervecería Caracas was founded in 1942, after Cervecería 
Caracas, an early team, was bought and transformed into Caracas. At first, 
the team played its home games at the old Estadio Cerveza Caracas, which 
was located in the capital city of Caracas. The team was founded by Martín 
Tovar Lange and managed by big leaguer Alejandro Carrasquel. The Princesa 
team played its last game on May 7, 1942. Then, Caracas debuted four days 
later with a 7–3 victory over the Criollos (English: Creoles). The game 
was played in Puerto Cabello, a city on the north coast of Venezuela. Caracas 
faced its later nemesis, the Navegantes del Magallanes for the first time 
on December 27 of that year, winning this now historic game by a 3–0 score. 
In its first stage, the team won two championship titles before moving 
to the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League in January 1946. Since its 
inception, the Caracas team was characterized by having only Venezuelan 
players on their roster. The club changed its policy in 1950, after signing 
catcher Lester Fusselman and outfielder Maurice Mozzali, two St. Louis 
Cardinals prospects. In 1952, the franchise was bought by the publicist 
and sport commentator Pablo Morales and christened Leones del Caracas. 
Since then, the team plays its home games at the Estadio Universitario 
in Caracas. Later, businessman Oscar Prieto Ortiz joined Morales as a legal 
partner. Pete Rose was benched after a slump late in the 1964 MLB season, 
finishing with a .269 average, but continued to play winter ball in Venezuela 
with the Leones del Caracas team during the 1964–1965 season to improve 
his batting. By 2001, the descendants of Morales and Prieto sold their 
shares to the Grupo Cisneros, giving it majority control of the team. Through 
2013, the Caracas team has won 20 championship titles (3 as Cervecería 
Caracas and 17 as Leones del Caracas), more than any other team in Venezuelan 
Professional Baseball League history. The Estadio Universitario is a multi-use 
stadium located in Caracas, Venezuela. The stadium holds 22,690 people 
and was built in 1952. This stadium forms part of the Central University 
of Venezuela campus and was designed by architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva. 
It is considered a masterpiece of urban planning and was declared a World 
Heritage Site by the UNESCO in 2000. (+) Won the title as Cervecería Caracas. 
The team changed owners and name in 1952, but documents made public on 
October 4, 2011, state that the franchise official name - Caracas Baseball 
Club - remained constant during all sale transactions in 1949, 1952 and 
2001. This has resulted in a change on the historical stats of Leones del 
Caracas, as reflected in the official page of the league.[1][2] On February 
9, 1982, the Leones earned Venezuela's third Caribbean World Series and 
the franchise's first, by defeating Dominican Republics's Leones del Escogido 
with a 3-1 score. The Leones ended the series with a record of 5 wins and 
1 defeat. The Venezuelan team, with Alfonso Carrasquel at the helm, gained 
the championship title with a 5-1 record. Leones was led by catcher and 
Series MVP Baudilio Díaz (.412 BA, two home runs, five RBI, .500 OBP, .765 
SLG), CF Tony Armas (.375, six RBI) and LF Luis Salazar (six runs, four 
stolen bases). The pitching staff was led by Luis Leal, who posted a 2-0 
record with a 2.08 ERA and 10 strikeouts and a in 13.0 innings of work. 
Behind him were Bud Black (1-0, 1.29), Dennis Burtt (1-0, one save, seven 
SO in 10⅔ innings) and Tom Dixon (nine scoreless innings in Game 7). Venezuela 
also featured 2B Steve Sax, SS Ron Gardenhire, 1B Dave Garcia, 3B Leonardo 
Hernández, pinch-hitter Andrés Galarraga and pitcher Joe Cowley, among 
others. On February 7, 2006, the Leones earned Venezuela's first Caribbean 
World Series title in 16 years, by defeating the Tigres del Licey of the 
Dominican Republic with a 5-4 score in the last game; this left the Leones 
with a record of six wins and no defeats at the 2006 Caribbean Series, 
ahead of Licey's four wins and two defeats record. With the victory, the 
Leones won Venezuela's sixth Caribbean Series title, and the franchise's 
second after the 1982 Caribbean Series. This also marked the first time 
a Venezuelan team sweeps the Caribbean Series, a feat previously accomplished 
only by teams from Cuba (Almendares in 1949, Habana in 1952, and Cienfuegos 
in 1960), from Puerto Rico (Cangrejeros de Santurce in 1953 and 2000, and 
Senadores de San Juan in 1995) and from the Dominican Republic (Tigres 
del Licey in 1971, 1977 and 1991, and Águilas Cibaeñas in 1998). * Retired
