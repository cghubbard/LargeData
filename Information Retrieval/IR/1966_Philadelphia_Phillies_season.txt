In 1966, the Philadelphia Phillies had a winning record of 87-75. During 
the winning season the Phillies also beat two of their biggest rivals, 
the Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Mets. They had the third highest winning 
percentage in the national league that year. The Phillies are owned by 
R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr. and since 1938 the Phillies have played home games 
in the Connie Mack stadium. While in the off season the Phillies purchased 
and traded several players. Among the purchased was Mike Marshall from 
the Detroit Tigers. Throughout its history, players could be added to the 
team via the farm system. The primary farm team was the Triple A San Diego 
Padres and the Double A Macon Peaches. However, no players were added this 
season from the farm system. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G
