The 1990 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 109th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and its 99th season in the National League. The Cardinals 
went 70-92 during the season and finished 6th (and last) in the National 
League East division, 25 games behind the NL East champion Pittsburgh Pirates. 
It was one of the few times that the Cardinals had finished in last place, 
and the first, and only time that it has happened since 1918. Shortstop 
Ozzie Smith won a Gold Glove this year. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos =
