MLB Records: Jonathan Thompson Walton Zachary (May 7, 1896 in Graham, North 
Carolina – January 24, 1969 in Burlington, North Carolina) was a professional 
baseball pitcher. He had a 19-year career in Major League Baseball that 
lasted from 1918 to 1936. He played for the Philadelphia A's, Washington 
Senators, St. Louis Browns, New York Yankees of the American League and 
the Boston Braves, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies of the National 
League. Zachary is well known for giving up Babe Ruth's record-setting 
60th home run in 1927. Then the next year, pitching for Ruth's team, the 
New York Yankees, he won the third game of the World Series, defeating 
the St. Louis Cardinals. Zachary went 12–0 for the 1929 Yankees, which 
is still the major league record for most pitching wins without a loss
