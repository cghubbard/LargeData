Robert William "Bob" Stanley (born November 10, 1954) is an American former 
professional baseball relief pitcher who played for the Boston Red Sox. 
He is currently the pitching coach for the Buffalo Bisons, Triple-A affiliate 
of the Toronto Blue Jays. He is perhaps best known for his wild pitch that 
allowed the tying run to score in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. Stanley 
attended Kearny High School in Kearny, New Jersey where he earned All-star 
honors as a pitcher-shortstop and pitched a perfect game in the N.J. championship 
tourney in 1973.[1] Stanley was a first-round pick of the Boston Red Sox 
in 1974 and played his entire 13-year career, 1977â€“89, with the team. A 
sinker ball specialist, Stanley was the club all-time saves leader with 
132 until Jonathan Papelbon passed him on July 1, 2009, but to most Red 
Sox fans, he is simply known as "The Steamer" (he is also known as "Bigfoot"). 
He is also the Red Sox all-time leader in appearances with 637, relief 
wins, and is a member of the Red Sox Hall of Fame since 2000. His best 
season came in 1983 when he led the Sox with 33 saves and posted a 2.45 
ERA. Stanley was a key member of the 1986 Red Sox team that came within 
one strike of winning the World Series but ultimately fell to the Mets 
in seven games. Stanley entered Game 6 with the Red Sox one out away from 
clinching their first World Series since 1918. But his wild pitch to Mookie 
Wilson allowed the Mets to tie the score and then New York won Game 6 on 
Bill Buckner's error. Stanley and the Red Sox would return to Shea Stadium 
for Game 7, in which the New York Mets would ultimately be victorious by 
a score of 8-5. In 1987, Stanley was converted to a starter for the first 
time since 1979. He went 4-15 with 67 strikeouts and a 5.01 ERA. On September 
25, 1989, Stanley announced his retirement. He compiled a 115-97 career-record 
with 693 strikeouts, a 3.64 ERA, 21 complete games, seven shutouts, 132 
saves, and 1707 innings in 637 games (85 as a starter). Stanley is the 
only player in major league history born in Maine to be named to an All-Star 
game.[2] Prior to joining the Blue Jays, Stanley served as a minor league 
pitching coach in the New York Mets' and San Francisco Giants' organizations, 
including service with the Connecticut Defenders, the Giants' Double-A 
Eastern League affiliate. On December 23, 2011, Stanley was announced as 
the pitching coach for the Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate, the Las Vegas 
51s.[3] On January 7, 2013, Toronto announced that Stanley would be the 
pitching coach for their new Triple-A farm club, the Buffalo Bisons.[4] 
Almost a year later, on January 4, 2014, the Blue Jays announced that Stanley 
would be replacing Pat Hentgen as their bullpen coach.[5] On December 19, 
Stanley was named the pitching coach for the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher 
Cats.[6] On January 19, 2016, Stanley was announced as returning to the 
Buffalo Bisons.[7] Stanley lives in the Seacoast region of southern New 
Hampshire. On April 4, 2011, he was named President of the Seacoast Mavericks 
of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL). On June 10, 2011, Stanley 
threw out the first pitch to inaugurate the Martha's Vineyard Sharks of
