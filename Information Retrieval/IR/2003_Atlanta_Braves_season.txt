The 2003 Atlanta Braves season marked the franchise's 38th season in Atlanta. 
The Braves won their 12th consecutive division title, finishing 10 games 
ahead of the second-place Florida Marlins. The Braves lost the 2003 Divisional 
Series to the Chicago Cubs, 3 games to 2. The Braves finished 2003 with 
their best offensive season in franchise history, hitting a franchise record 
235 home runs. Atlanta also had one of the most noteworthy combined offensive 
outfield productions in league history. The Braves' starting rotation had 
new faces in 2003, but aged pitchers. Opposite of what they were traditionally 
known for in years earlier. Greg Maddux was joined by trade acquisitions 
Mike Hampton and Russ Ortiz, free agent Shane Reynolds and rookie Horacio 
Ram√≠rez. Critics noted had Atlanta had a younger staff with this offense, 
they would've been more likely to win the world series. Marcus Giles had 
an All-Star season as the Braves' second baseman and Gary Sheffield as 
the Braves' right fielder. Sheffield finished with a top 5 voting in NL 
MVP voting. 2003 also marked the last season for Maddux, ending his tenure 
in Atlanta after 11 seasons. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: G =
