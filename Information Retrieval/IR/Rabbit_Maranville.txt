Walter James Vincent Maranville (November 11, 1891 – January 6, 1954), 
better known as Rabbit Maranville due to his speed and small stature — 
5 feet 5 inches (165 cm) tall and 155 pounds (70 kg; 11 st 1 lb) — was 
a Major League Baseball shortstop. At the time of his retirement in 1935, 
he had played in a record 23 seasons in the National League, a mark which 
wasn't broken until 1986 by Pete Rose. Maranville finished third in the 
MVP voting in his first full season, playing for the Boston Braves as a 
21-year-old in 1913 even though his batting average was just .247 in 143 
games with two homers. The following year, Maranville was the runner-up 
in the MVP voting to teammate Johnny Evers as the Braves won the National 
League pennant and then went on to sweep the powerful Philadelphia A's 
in the World Series. That year, Maranville was the Braves' cleanup hitter, 
despite batting just .246 and hitting four home runs. Even at age 41, when 
Maranville batted .218 in 143 games and hit no homers, he finished in a 
tie for 12th in the MVP voting.[citation needed] Over a lengthy career 
which spanned both the dead ball and live-ball era, Maranville played for 
the Boston Braves (1912–1920, 1929–1933, 1935), Pittsburgh Pirates (1921–1924), 
Chicago Cubs (1925), Brooklyn Robins (1926) and St. Louis Cardinals (1927–1928). 
He retired having compiled a .258 batting average, 2,605 hits, 1,255 runs, 
28 home runs, 884 RBI and 291 stolen bases. As a shortstop, he finished 
his career with a positional record 5,139 putouts.[1] He won his only World 
Series championship in 1914 as a member of the Braves, and won his only 
other National League championship in 1928 as a member of the Cardinals. 
Maranville was known as one of "baseball's most famous clowns" due to his 
practical jokes and lack of inhibitions.[2] When he was appointed manager 
of the Chicago Cubs in 1925—one of their worst seasons ever—he did not 
change his behavior. One night he went through a Pullman car dumping water 
on sleeping players' heads, saying, "No sleeping under Maranville management, 
especially at night." Not long after that, he was out on the street outside 
Ebbets Field in Brooklyn mimicking a newsboy hawking papers. He cried out, 
"Read all about it! Maranville fired!" And so he was—the next day.[3] Following 
the end of his playing career, Maranville turned to managing, including 
stints as a minor league manager for Montreal Royals, at Albany, Elmira, 
and Springfield, Massachusetts.[4] In later years he worked as the director 
of a baseball school sponsored by the New York Journal-American newspaper.[4] 
Rabbit Maranville was felled by a heart attack shortly after midnight on 
January 6, 1954 at his home in Woodside, New York.[4] Death was nearly 
instantaneous.[4] He was 62 years old at the time of his death. Maranville 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954, just months after 
his death, along with Bill Terry and Bill Dickey, in his 14th year of eligibility.[citation
