As Player As Manager William Clyde Hitchcock (July 31, 1916 – April 9, 
2006) was an American professional baseball infielder, coach, manager, 
and scout in Major League Baseball (MLB). In Minor League Baseball, he 
served as president of the Double-A Southern League in 1971–80. His older 
brother, Jimmy Hitchcock, played briefly for the 1938 Boston Braves. Born 
in Inverness, Alabama and a graduate of Auburn University, Hitchcock played 
all four infield positions during a nine-year American League active career. 
The right-handed batter and thrower stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and 
weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). He broke in with the 1942 Detroit Tigers, spent 
three years in the Army Air Force in the Pacific during World War II, and 
resumed his Major League career from 1946–53. Overall, he batted .243 with 
547 hits and five home runs in 703 games with the Tigers, Washington Senators, 
Boston Red Sox, St. Louis Browns and Philadelphia Athletics. Between Triple-A 
managing assignments in 1954 and 1961, Hitchcock served a six-year (1955–60) 
term as the Tigers' third base coach. He also became a footnote to one 
of the most bizarre personnel transactions in baseball annals. On August 
3, 1960, the Tigers and Cleveland Indians traded their managers, Jimmy 
Dykes for Joe Gordon. Hitchcock served as Detroit's interim skipper for 
one game while Gordon was en route from his Cleveland assignment, and the 
Tigers defeated the New York Yankees, 12–2.[1] In 1962, Hitchcock was named 
the full-time manager of the Baltimore Orioles. But in his two seasons 
at the helm, the ballclub barely broke the .500 mark (163–161). Hitchcock 
was dismissed on September 29 after the final game of the 1963 campaign 
in which the fourth-place Orioles finished 18½ games behind the Yankees,[2] 
and moved into Baltimore's minor league department as field coordinator. 
Then he became a scout for the Braves, whose general manager at the time 
was former Tiger player and executive John McHale. Hitchcock began the 
1966 season as a coach for the Atlanta Braves under Bobby Bragan during 
the club's first season in Atlanta. But when the Braves won only 52 of 
their first 111 games, Bragan was fired on August 9 and Hitchcock took 
over. The Braves won 33 of their last 51 games to finish fifth in the National 
League, and Hitchcock was invited back for 1967, but he was fired September 
28 with the team in seventh place and three games remaining on the schedule.[3] 
His career managing record was 274 wins, 261 losses (.514). Hitchcock then 
scouted for McHale and the Montreal Expos in 1968–71 before taking over 
as president of the Southern League. During his presidency, the Southern 
League added new teams, expanded its playoffs and introduced split-season 
play. The league's attendance figures rose dramatically during his tenure, 
from 333,500 in 1971 to over 1.7 million in 1980. The league's championship 
trophy is named after Hitchcock, and in 1980 he was presented with the 
King of Baseball award given by Minor League Baseball. In addition to his 
baseball resume, Hitchcock also made a name for himself in college football 
and golf. As an All-Conference tailback, he led Auburn to its first bowl 
game (a 7-7 tie against Villanova on January 1, 1937). Later in life, he 
established the Billy Hitchcock Golf Tournament at his alma mater. In recognition 
of his contribution to the school, Auburn renamed its renovated baseball 
stadium "Hitchcock Field" in 2003. Also in that year, Baseball America 
named it the best college baseball facility in the country. Hitchcock died 
in Opelika, Alabama at age 89.[4] He was a charter member and elder at
