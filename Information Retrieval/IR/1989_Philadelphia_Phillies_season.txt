The 1989 season was the Phillies 107th season. The Phillies finished in 
6th place in the National League East for the second consecutive season. 
It would also be Mike Schmidt's final season. Injuries to Mike Schmidt's 
knees and back caused him to miss much of the 1988 season. After a poor 
start to the 1989 season, Schmidt chose to suddenly announce his retirement 
in San Diego, on May 29. Known as "Captain Cool" by many in Philadelphia 
sports circles, Schmidt surprised many with an emotional, and occasionally 
tearful, retirement speech. In honor of his career, fans voted Schmidt 
to the NL All-Star team; Schmidt declined to play but was announced with 
the team. His last game was May 28, 1989 against the San Francisco Giants.[7] 
The Phillies played 163 regular season games due to a tie game on June 
5 when they hosted the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the score tied 3-3, the 
game ended due to rain after only 8 innings had been played.[8] Under the 
playing rules in place at the time, all player and team statistics generated 
during the tie game would stand (except since neither team had won, there 
could not be a winning or losing pitcher); a replacement game would be 
played at a later date. This game would mark the last regular season tie 
game for the Phillies as playing rules changed in 2007 allowing tie games 
to continue from the point of interruption at a later date. On June 8, 
1989, Steve Jeltz hit two of his five career home runs in a game against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates, despite not starting the game. A switch-hitter, 
Jeltz hit one of these homers from the right side of the plate and one 
from the left side. This was the first time in the history of the Phillies 
that this feat had been accomplished. It was in this same game that, after 
the Pirates scored 10 runs in the top of the first, Pirate broadcaster 
Jim Rooker said on-air, "If we lose this game, I'll walk home." The Phillies 
came back to win 15-11, and after the season Rooker conducted a 300-mile 
charity walk from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Infielders Other batters
