The National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament (選抜高等学校野球大会 senbatsu 
kōtō gakkō yakyū taikai) of Japan, commonly known as "Spring Kōshien" (春の甲子園 
haru no kōshien) or "Senbatsu" (センバツ), is an annual high school baseball 
tournament. The tournament, organized by the Japan High School Baseball 
Federation and Mainichi Shimbun, takes place each year in March at Hanshin 
Koshien Stadium in the Koshien district of Nishinomiya City, Hyōgo, Japan. 
Teams qualify for the tournament by participating in the regional fall 
tournaments held throughout the country. While finishing in the top teams 
generally guarantees an invitation, it is up to the Japan High School Baseball 
Federation to determine invitees. For instance, in the 2008 Fall Tournament 
in the Tōhoku region, Ichinoseki Gakuin was the runner-up. However, they 
were passed over for 3rd place Hanamaki Higashi for the 2009 invitation 
tournament. Of the 32 bids, 26 are automatically awarded as follows to 
the following regions: In addition, one additional bid is awarded to a 
team in the Kanto/Tokyo region, and another to a team in the Chugoku/Shikoku 
region. The region of the winning team in the Meiji Jingu Fall Tournament 
(which consists of all fall regional champions) also receives a bid. The 
final 3 bids are what are considered "21st Century Teams". 21st century 
teams are a way to give teams who either may not get close to qualifying 
or who have served as a model school in some way a chance to compete. A 
team from each prefecture is nominated around November–December. The teams 
must have advanced to the round of 16 play, but not gotten past the quarterfinals 
of their prefecture's tournament. Then each region nominates one of those 
nominees to the selection committee by December 15. Finally, the committee 
selects the three 21st century teams. Coordinates: 34°43′16.34″N 135°21′41.84″E﻿
