Harry H. Davis (July 19, 1873 – August 11, 1947) was a Major League Baseball 
first baseman and right-handed batter who played for the New York Giants 
(1895–96), Pittsburgh Pirates (1896–98), Louisville Colonels (1898), Washington 
Senators (1898–99), Philadelphia Athletics (1901–11, 1913–17), and Cleveland 
Naps (1912). Davis was born in Philadelphia. He attended Girard College. 
He led the American League in home runs from 1904 to 1907, one of only 
five players to have ever led their league for four consecutive seasons. 
He also hit for the cycle on July 10, 1901. He led the AL in doubles three 
times and the NL in triples once. Davis was the starting first baseman 
and first captain of manager Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics from 
1901 to 1910. In 1905 he led the American league in home runs, RBI, runs 
and doubles, and led the Athletics to the 1905 World Series against the 
New York Giants. He was the starting first baseman for the 1910 World Champions 
and hit .353 in the 1910 World Series. In 1911, the 37-year-old Davis was 
replaced at first base by the younger Stuffy McInnis, and Davis played 
a reserve role for the 1911 World Champions. Davis managed the 1912 Cleveland 
Naps, but left with 28 games left in the season and a record of 54–71. 
He returned to the Athletics as a player/coach in 1913, amassing only 33 
plate appearances over the next five seasons combined. He continued as 
a coach and scout with Mack's Athletics until 1927 and also served as a 
Philadelphia City Councilman. Davis died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
