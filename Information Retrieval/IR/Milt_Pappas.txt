Milton Steven "Milt" Pappas (May 11, 1939 – April 19, 2016) was a professional 
baseball pitcher. A 17-year veteran, Pappas, nicknamed "Gimpy", pitched 
for the Baltimore Orioles (1957–1965), Cincinnati Reds (1966–1968), Atlanta 
Braves (1968–1970) and Chicago Cubs (1970–1973). Pappas was born to Greek 
parents, and his birth name was Miltiades Stergios Papastergios. A control 
specialist, Pappas pitched in 520 games, starting 465, with 209 wins, 164 
losses, 43 shutouts, 1,728 strikeouts and a 3.40 ERA in 3,186 innings pitched.[1] 
In 1957, as a senior at Cooley High School, Pappas was scouted by several 
teams and signed with the Orioles at the suggestion of Hal Newhouser, a 
former star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who lived in the Detroit area. 
Pappas signed for $4,000 and pitched only three games in the minor leagues 
before being called up in August. He made his Major League debut on August 
10 in relief against the New York Yankees. In 1958 he made the Orioles’ 
starting rotation and began a streak of 11 consecutive double-digit win 
seasons with a 10–10 record. Pappas soon became the ace of the Orioles' 
staff, and was named an All-Star in 1962, pitching in both All-Star games 
(from 1959 to 1962, Major League Baseball had two All-Star games). He was 
also named starting pitcher in the 1965 All-Star Game. In each year from 
1959 through 1965, Pappas never had a losing record, winning between 13 
and 16 games. In 1998, as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa surpassed Roger Maris’ 
single-season home run record, Pappas admitted that he threw nothing but 
fastballs to Maris in giving up Roger's 59th home run in 1961. Pappas explained 
that he was upset that commissioner Ford Frick was planning to list separately 
the new home run mark if Maris did not eclipse Babe Ruth's 60 home runs 
in 1927 on or before the Yankees’ 154th game.[2] In December 1965, Pappas 
and another pitcher, Jack Baldschun, and outfielder Dick Simpson were traded 
to the Cincinnati Reds for superstar and future Baseball Hall of Famer 
Frank Robinson. Reds president Bill DeWitt believed that Robinson was "not 
a young 30." The outrage from the Cincinnati fans over the deal made it 
difficult for Pappas to adjust to pitching in Cincinnati. He posted a winning 
record in 1966 (12–11), but with a 4.29 ERA — more than a run above his 
career ERA to that point. In 1967 Pappas won a team- and career-high 16 
games, but when he got off to a slow start in 1968, the Reds traded him 
to the Atlanta Braves in a six-player deal, receiving starting pitcher 
Tony Cloninger, relief pitcher Clay Carroll and infielder Woody Woodward. 
Pappas adapted well to the new ballpark (Fulton County Stadium), as he 
went 10–8 for the Braves with a 2.37 ERA. In 1969 injuries sidelined him 
for much of the first four months of the season, and he won only six games 
with 10 losses with a 3.62 ERA. Yet Atlanta won the National League West 
title (both leagues were now split into two divisions after expanding from 
10 teams to 12) for the franchise's first postseason berth since the 1958 
World Series as the Milwaukee Braves, and Pappas finally achieved his goal 
of the post-season. In the playoffs against the New York Mets, Pappas made 
his only post-season appearance, allowing three runs in three innings in 
relief. In 1970, the Braves pulled Pappas from their rotation after only 
three starts after he compiled a 6.06 ERA and allowed six home runs. On 
June 23, they sold him to the Chicago Cubs, where he got another chance 
to prove he was still a major league starter. Pappas posted a 7–2 record 
with a 2.36 ERA at home and a 10–8 record with a 2.68 ERA overall. In 1971, 
Pappas went 17–14 (the wins being a career best) with a 3.51 ERA. On September 
24 of that year, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Wrigley Field, Pappas 
struck out three batters (two of whom were Greg Luzinski and Don Money) 
on nine pitches in the fourth inning of a 6–1 loss, becoming the 10th National 
League pitcher and the 16th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish 
the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning. Five days later, against the 
Montreal Expos at Jarry Park, Pappas was again part of baseball history, 
albeit on the other side, as he was responsible for Ron Hunt's 50th hit 
by pitch of the season, which broke the single-season record of 49 set 
by Hughie Jennings in 1896. Pappas complained unsuccessfully to home plate 
umpire Ken Burkhart that the pitch had been over the plate, and that Hunt 
had made no effort to get out of the way. (Later research would credit 
Jennings with 51 HBPs, giving him the single-season record once again.) 
In 1972, Pappas went 17–7 with a 2.77 earned run average, his best full-season 
ERA since his 2.60 in 1965, his last year in Baltimore. On September 2 
of that year, at Wrigley Field, Pappas no-hit the San Diego Padres 8–0. 
He retired the first 26 batters and was one strike away from a perfect 
game with a 2–2 count on pinch-hitter Larry Stahl, but home-plate umpire 
Bruce Froemming called the next two pitches — both of which were close 
— balls. Pappas believed he had struck out Stahl, and even decades later 
in 2008, he continued to begrudge Froemming.[3][4][5][6] Some 25 years 
later, a Chicago radio personality, during an interview with Pappas, got 
Froemming on the phone and the two argued on the air. Pappas also said 
in 2006 that he has seen videotape footage of that game on WGN and can 
see Froemming smirking immediately after the walk was issued; Froemming 
denied the charge. Pappas ended the game by retiring the next batter, ex-Cub 
Garry Jestadt. Until Carlos Zambrano no-hit the Houston Astros on September 
14, 2008, Pappas' had been the last no-hitter the Cubs had been involved 
in, either pitching it or having it pitched against them. They had gone 
the longest of all Major League teams since they had last been involved 
in a no-hitter. It was also the last no-hitter pitched at Wrigley Field 
until the Philadelphia Phillies' Cole Hamels no-hit the Cubs on July 25, 
2015. Eleven days after his no-hitter, Pappas recorded his 200th career 
victory, also at Wrigley Field, defeating the Montreal Expos 6–2. In 1973, 
he won only 7 games with 12 losses and a 4.28 ERA. Prior to the start of 
the 1974 season he was released by the Cubs. He retired with 209 victories, 
becoming the first-ever 200-game winner who did not win 20 games in any 
one season. (A feat later matched by: Jerry Reuss, Frank Tanana, Charlie 
Hough, Dennis Martínez, Chuck Finley, Kenny Rogers, and Tim Wakefield) 
During his career, Pappas was in the top 10 in ERA eight seasons, in wins 
six seasons, fewest walks per nine innings nine seasons, complete games 
seven seasons, shutouts eight seasons, and he was tied for the league lead 
with a perfect fielding percentage (1.000) four seasons.[1] Pappas also 
hit 20 home runs as a pitcher; as of 2014, he is one of 13 pitchers to 
hit at least 20 home runs. On August 27, 1961, while with the Orioles, 
Pappas pitched a two-hit, 3–0 shutout against the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan 
Stadium and helped his own cause by homering twice off Pedro Ramos.[7] 
Pappas also homered off Bill Stafford in the Orioles' 1-0 victory over 
the New York Yankees on April 18, 1962; he was the last American League 
pitcher in the pre-designated hitter era to hit a home run in a 1-0 game.[8] 
Not until Nathan Karns in 2015 would another American League pitcher accomplish 
this feat. On September 11, 1982, Pappas’ wife, Carole, disappeared after 
leaving the couple's home in the Farnham subdivision in the Chicago suburb 
of Wheaton. For five years, no sign was found of her car, her clothing, 
or her body. One theory was that Carole Pappas was killed by a group of 
four men known as the Ripper Crew, as part of a satanic ritual. In 1984, 
Tom Kokoraleis, who was convicted for the murder of Lorraine Borowski, 
led police to a field where Carole Pappas was allegedly buried, but searchers 
could not find any remains.[9] On August 7, 1987, workers draining a shallow 
pond four blocks from the Pappas home discovered the car she had been driving, 
a white and burgundy 1980 Buick, as well as her body. A DuPage County coroner's 
jury ruled the cause of death as accidental drowning. Police theorized 
she mistook a driveway near the pond for a road leading to her subdivision, 
vaulting 25–30 feet from the bank into the pond.[10] Carole Pappas, a recovering 
alcoholic, may have been drinking; however, blood alcohol content could 
not be confirmed.[11] Milt and Carole Pappas had two children, Michelle 
and Steve. Carole had been his childhood sweetheart and they were married 
22 years. After baseball he owned a restaurant in Baltimore, Milt Pappas' 
Scotch & Sirloin, worked for a beer and wine distributor and later sold 
building supplies. In 1990, Pappas sold his house in Wheaton and moved 
with his second wife, Judi (Bloome), a teacher of special needs children, 
to Beecher, Illinois, with their 5-year-old daughter Alexandria.[12][13] 
Judi is administrative dean of students at Crete-Monee High School. He 
was seriously injured in a February 2013 single-vehicle accident in Kankakee 
County when he crashed into a utility pole and rolled his Jeep Cherokee, 
fracturing eight ribs and lacerating an ear. He was hospitalized several 
days before being released.[14] Pappas died of natural causes on April
