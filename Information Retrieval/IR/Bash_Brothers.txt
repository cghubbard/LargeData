The Bash Brothers are a duo of former baseball players consisting of Jose 
Canseco and Mark McGwire. Both prolific home run hitters, the two were 
teammates in Major League Baseball (MLB) for seven seasons with the Oakland 
Athletics, helping the team win a World Series title in 1989. The two began 
celebrating homers by bashing each other's forearms, which spawned a marketing 
campaign that was a takeoff on The Blues Brothers. After retiring from 
playing, Canseco and McGwire both admitted to using anabolic steroids during 
their careers. Canseco was drafted by the Oakland A's in the 15th round 
of the 1982 MLB Draft. He did not become a legitimate power hitter until 
he began weightlifting in late 1984 and gained 35 pounds (16 kg) of muscle.[1] 
In 1985 he jumped from AA to AAA to the major leagues, and batted .300 
at each level. In 29 games with Oakland that season, he batted .302 with 
five home runs (HR) and 13 runs batted in (RBI), and hit a combined 41 
HR with 140 RBI at all levels that year.[2] McGwire played college baseball 
for the USC Trojans, and set a school record with 32 HR in his junior year.[3] 
He played for the United States national team in the 1984 Summer Olympics 
before being selected by the A's in the first round of the 1984 draft.[4] 
In two-plus years in the minor leagues, McGwire hit 48 HR.[3] He debuted 
with the A's as a third baseman in August 1986.[4] The outfielder Canseco 
was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1986 when he hit 
33 homers, and McGwire captured the award the following season, when he 
was moved to first base and hit a league-leading 49 home runs, a major-league 
record for rookies.[3] The two combined for over 200 home runs as Oakland 
captured the AL pennant in three consecutive seasons from 1988 though 1990, 
winning the World Series in 1989.[5][6][7] In 1988, Canseco was unanimously 
voted the AL Most Valuable Player after batting .307 and leading the majors 
with 42 HR and 124 RBI. He also added 40 stolen bases (SB), which combined 
with his home run total made him the first major leaguer to ever reach 
the 40–40 club.[8] That year, Canseco and McGwire began a ritual of meeting 
at home plate and banging their massive forearms together with closed fists 
to briefly form an "X" when either of them hit a home run.[9][10] Dubbed 
the Monster Bash, it soon replaced the customary high five as the team's 
preferred post-homer celebration.[11][12] The practice was mimicked by 
Little Leaguers, college players, and minor leaguers. It was also performed 
by the United States national team at the 1988 Summer Olympics in South 
Korea.[9] At the Oakland Coliseum, T-shirts and banners bore "Let's Bash". 
A song and complementary music video was made to the tune of "Monster Mash", 
the 1962 hit by Bobby "Boris" Pickett, with almost a dozen radio stations 
placing the new "Monster Bash" on their playlists.[9][12][13] Costacos 
Brothers Inc., an innovative poster company, had already planned a photo 
shoot with the slugging duo for a concept that was originally titled "The 
Blast Brothers", but the advent of the forearm bashing motivated a change 
to the "The Bash Brothers".[14] The poster was patterned after characters 
popularized by comedians Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi.[11] Canseco and 
McGwire were made to look like a bigger and meaner version of The Blues 
Brothers who were also partial to some yellow in their attire—yellow being 
an A's team color along with green.[5][15] Wearing black suits, black shoes, 
black hats, black sunglasses, yellow socks, yellow shirts, skinny ties, 
and fedora hats, the duo posed in front of an Oakland Police patrol car 
while holding giant 5-foot (1.5 m) baseball bats.[5][9][14] The poster 
sold 50,000 copies in the San Francisco Bay Area in less than three weeks.[16] 
It was as popular as any poster that Costacos had done, and it received 
immense press coverage.[14] Due to the frequency and distance of their 
home runs, the Bash Brothers were a popular attraction in every American 
League city.[17] McGwire became the first player in major league history 
to hit 30 home runs in his first four seasons (1987–1990),[18] and Canseco 
led the majors in homers for the second time with 44 in 1991.[19][20] However, 
the Athletics finished in fourth place in the AL West in 1991 after having 
made three straight trips to the World Series.[18] At the trade deadline 
in 1992, Oakland traded Canseco to the Texas Rangers for outfielder Rubén 
Sierra, relief pitcher Jeff Russell, and starting pitcher Bobby Witt.[20] 
The A's at the time were 27 games above .500 and leading their division 
by 7 1⁄2 games, but they had played 34 of 131 games without Canseco, and 
were seeking to strengthen their pitching.[21][22] He had homered 231 times 
with the A's since 1985,[23] and was arguably the biggest celebrity in 
baseball at the time.[21] However, Canseco had played over 135 games in 
a season just once since 1988, and his off-the-field antics had drawn criticism 
as well.[20][21] After four seasons with Texas and one with Boston, Canseco 
returned to Oakland in 1997. The A's had been languishing for three seasons 
with a combined 196–224 record, and were having a nondescript offseason 
before acquiring him for pitcher John Wasdin.[24][25] Reuniting him with 
McGwire, who together were once one of the most explosive tandems in baseball, 
boosted the team's ticket sales considerably.[7][26] McGwire was coming 
off of a majors-leading 52-homer season, and Canseco remained a threat 
with his tremendous bat speed.[24] However, McGwire's contract was expiring 
at the end of the season,[24] and he was traded mid-season to the St. Louis 
Cardinals for pitchers T. J. Mathews, Eric Ludwick, and Blake Stein.[27] 
Canseco's season was just ordinary,[26] and he signed in the offseason 
with the Toronto Blue Jays, his fourth team in four years.[28] During their 
careers with Oakland, Canseco and McGwire combined to hit 617 home runs.[29] 
With Toronto in 1998, Canseco played in 120 games for the first time since 
1991,[30] and reached 100 RBI for the first time since 1991.[31] In his 
last big season, he had 46 HR, 107 RBI, and 29 SB for the Blue Jays.[30] 
He became a journeyman designated hitter before retiring in 2002.[31] He 
fell 38 home runs short of joining the 500 home run club, a milestone he 
had hoped to reach to bolster his chances of being inducted into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.[32] Unable to find a job to prolong his 
career, he accused teams of blackballing him.[5] McGwire hit 70 home runs 
in 1998 to break Roger Maris' long-standing major-league record of 61. 
It was the highlight of a four-year stretch from 1996 though 1999 in which 
McGwire hit 245 homers.[33] He finished his career with 583 home runs, 
and averaged one homer every 10.6 at-bats in his career for the best at 
bats per home run ratio in major league history.[34] He was considered 
a likely inductee into the Hall of Fame until allegations of his illegal 
use of steroids.[5] On September 28, 1988, sports columnist Thomas Boswell 
of The Washington Post appeared as a guest on CBS News Nightwatch and alleged 
that Canseco, who was on his way to winning the MVP award that season, 
was "the most conspicuous example of a player who has made himself great 
with steroids.”[35] Boswell did not print the allegations in the paper. 
According to George Solomon, who was the Post's sports editor, the newspaper 
required 100 percent certainty in what it published. "What Boswell said 
on CBS was Boswell’s opinion,” Solomon said.[35] In October against Boston 
during the 1988 American League Championship Series, Red Sox fans at Fenway 
Park loudly chanted "Ster-roids! Ster-roids!" when Canseco was on the field. 
He denied the charges, and steroids at the time were not covered in the 
federal government's Controlled Substances Act.[36] During his home run 
record chase in 1998, McGwire was spotted with a bottle of androstenedione 
in his locker by Steve Wilstein of the Associated Press, which he eventually 
admitted to using. An over-the-counter bodybuilding substance, andro was 
a type of anabolic steroid that had been banned in other sports, but not 
yet in baseball.[37] “Everybody that I know in the game of baseball uses 
the same stuff I use,” McGwire said.[35] After setting the home run record, 
he announced that he had stopped using the substance to avoid setting a 
bad example to young kids.[37] Meanwhile, the locker discovery was written 
off by the public as the work of prying reporter.[38] In 2005, Canseco 
admitted to using steroids in his book Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, 
Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, which stated that he and McGwire injected 
steroids together while with Oakland. The book also accused other prominent 
players of using steroids.[5][39] McGwire initially denied the allegations,[39] 
before refusing to comment on steroids during a congressional hearing the 
following month.[37] In 2010, he too admitted to using steroids.[6] Canseco 
expressed regret in writing his book and apologized to McGwire in 2014, 
but his former teammate has spurned multiple attempts at reconciliation.[40]
