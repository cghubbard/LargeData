The 1981 Minnesota Twins finished a combined 41-68, seventh in the American 
League West. In the strike split season, the Twins were 17-39, seventh 
place in the first half and 24-29, fourth place in the second half. 469,090 
fans attended Twins games, the lowest total in the American League. It 
was also their 21st and final season at Metropolitan Stadium, before moving 
their home games to the Metrodome the next season. The franchise would 
not play another outdoor home game until 2010, when Target Field opened. 
Only one Twins player made the All-Star Game: relief pitcher Doug Corbett. 
On August 24, first baseman Kent Hrbek made his major league debut, in 
a Yankee Stadium game. His twelfth-inning home run beat the Yankees 3-2. 
Later that week, Herbie was topped by catcher Tim Laudner, who debuted 
on August 28 and hit home runs in his first two games. On September 20, 
Gary Gaetti made his major league debut and started at third base for the 
Twins. In his first at bat in the second inning, he homered off Texas Rangers 
pitcher Charlie Hough to become the third Twin to homer in his first-ever 
at bat. Gaetti joined Rick Renick (1968) and Dave McKay (1975). Later, 
Andre David (1984) and Eddie Rosario (2015) will join the trio in Twins 
history. The Twins played their final game at Metropolitan Stadium on September 
30, losing 5-2 to the Kansas City Royals. The club played their last outdoor 
home game for the next twenty-eight seasons in 56-degree temperature in 
front of 15,900 fans. "The Met" had been the Twins' home since their Minnesota 
opener on April 21, 1961 (also a loss). Gary Ward had the final Twins hit 
in the Met, a single in the ninth inning. Pete Mackanin homered in the 
second for the final Twins Met Stadium home run. John Castino batted .268 
with 6 HR and 37 RBI. Shortstop Roy Smalley had 7 HR and collected 22 RBI. 
Reliever Doug Corbett was the Twins' only bright spot on the mound, racking 
up 17 saves. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
