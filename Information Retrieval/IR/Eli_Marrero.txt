Elieser Marrero (born November 17, 1973 in Havana, Cuba), is a former Major 
League Baseball player. Marrero started his career as a catcher, but spent 
time at first base, third base and in the outfield. Marrero was selected 
in the 3rd round of the June 1993 draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He 
missed much of the 2000 season due to thyroid cancer. During that time, 
he lost his job as the starting catcher for the Cardinals, so when he returned 
he started logging time in the outfield and at first, in addition to occasional 
duty behind the plate. On July 2, 2006, Marrero saw his first Major League 
action at third base, playing two innings there for the New York Mets. 
While with the Cardinals, Marrero caught Bud Smith's no-hitter on September 
3, 2001.[1] The Cardinals traded Marrero to the Atlanta Braves in December 
2003 as part of a package for pitchers Jason Marquis[2] and rookie prospect 
Adam Wainwright,[3] where he hit .415 against left-handed pitchers as a 
platoon outfielder. Following the 2004 season, the Braves dealt him to 
the Kansas City Royals, who were in need of a power-hitting corner outfielder, 
in exchange for minor-league pitcher Jorge Vasquez. He saw action at all 
three outfield positions and first base, but hit only .159 in 32 games. 
The Royals designated him for assignment on May 31, 2005, giving them 10 
days to trade or release him. On June 8, the Royals traded him to the Baltimore 
Orioles for minor-league infielder Peter Maestrales. On June 9, 2006, while 
playing for the AAA affiliate of the Colorado Rockies, Marrero was traded 
to the New York Mets for infielder Kaz Matsui. On August 8, 2006, he was 
designated for assignment by the Mets. On November 28, 2006, Marrero was 
signed to a minor league deal by the St. Louis Cardinals. On May 21, 2007, 
Marrero was released by the Memphis Redbirds, the Cardinals' Triple-A affiliate, 
after just one game. He is the uncle of former Washington Nationals first 
baseman Chris Marrero. In July, 2011, Marrero was named the batting coach 
of the Billings Mustangs, Marrero was the manager of the Arizona League 
Reds for the 2013 season. On December 1, 2014 Marrero was named manager 
of the Reds Class A-Advanced affiliate, the Daytona Tortugas. His son Elih 
was a 29th round pick by the Cincinnati Reds in the MLB 2015 First-Year 
Player Draft but elected to play college baseball at Mississippi State.
