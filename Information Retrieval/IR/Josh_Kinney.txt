his contract from River City and assigned to Short-Season A New Jersey 
Cardinals in the New Yorkâ€“Penn League. He was later promoted to the Single-A 
Peoria Chiefs, which was then a Cardinals affiliate in the Midwest League, 
where he made 27 appearances. In 2002, Kinney was promoted to the Single-A 
Advanced Potomac Cannons in the Carolina League, where he had a 2.29 earned 
run average (ERA) in 44 appearances. For the start of 2003 season, Kinney 
remained at Single-A Advanced level but St. Louis disaffiliated with the 
Cannons, creating instead the Palm Beach Cardinals in Florida State League. 
He was promoted to Tennessee Smokies, the Double-A affiliate in the Southern 
League. In 2003 and 2004, he bounced between Palm Beach and Tennessee. 
Kinney stayed at the Double-A to begin the 2005 season, but St. Louis disaffiliated 
with the Smokies, thus he was sent to the Springfield Cardinals for their 
inaugural season. He excelled in Springfield, posting a 1.29 ERA in 32 
appearances. At mid-season, he was promoted to Triple-A Memphis Redbirds, 
where he pitched in 26 games. Kinney began 2006 in Memphis, where he pitched 
well, maintaining an ERA under 1.60. He was first called up to the major 
leagues on July 2, 2006, which made Kinney the first Springfield Cardinals 
player to be called up to the St. Louis Cardinals.[1] His first major league 
pitch was hit for a home run by the Atlanta Braves' Ryan Langerhans. He 
pitched in 10 games then optioned back to Memphis on August 1. He was recalled 
again, on September 5, and pitched well enough to remain on the playoff 
roster. He pitched in the NLDS, the NLCS, and the 2006 World Series, winning 
a World Series ring after the Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers four 
games to one. Kinney pitched in Games 2 and 4, pitching a total of one 
inning with a 0.00 World Series ERA. In Game 2 of the World Series, he 
pitched 1/3 innings with a walk and a strikeout. In Game 4, he faced three 
batters, retiring two of them, one by way of strikeout. After a few poor 
outings to begin 2007 spring training, Kinney had season-ending Tommy John 
surgery to repair a tear in his ulnar collateral ligament.[2] A fractured 
elbow while rehabbing in 2007 further delayed his return, and Kinney did 
not make it back to the Cardinals until September 2008.[3] He made a four-game 
rehab stint with Double-A Springfield. He then pitched in seven games in 
2008 for the Cardinals, and did not give up a run in 7 innings. Kinney 
made the St. Louis Cardinals team out of spring training in 2009 but was 
optioned back to Memphis on April 17 after three appearances. He was recalled 
on June 18, but sent back on July 26. During that stint, he earned his 
first Major League win against the Minnesota Twins on June 27 with 1.1 
scoreless innings allowing two hits and stranding two runners. He was recalled 
in the September call-up on September 23. For 2010, Kinney was with the 
Memphis Redbirds for their entire season. Despite pitching well, having 
17 saves and an 1.80 ERA,[4] the Cardinals took him off their 40-man roster 
on July 2. Moreover, he was not part of the Cards' September call-up. On 
January 9, 2011, Kinney signed a deal with the Chicago White Sox. He was 
called up on August 19 to replace Philip Humber, who was hit in the head 
by a line drive and was placed on the disabled list. He became a free agent 
on October 18. Kinney signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners 
on December 13, 2011. He pitched for the Mariners in the 2012 season, after 
the season, he was resigned to a 1-year deal.[5] In March 11, 2013, Kinney 
injured his rib.[6][7] Kinney signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh
