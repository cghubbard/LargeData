Billy Eppler (born September 16, 1975)[1] is an American baseball executive. 
He is the general manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major 
League Baseball. He previously served as the New York Yankees' director 
of professional scouting and assistant general manager. Eppler is a native 
of San Diego, California, and graduated from University of San Diego High 
School in 1993.[2][3] He attended the University of Connecticut and pitched 
for the Connecticut Huskies baseball team, until an arm injury ended his 
playing career.[4] He graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in finance 
in 1998.[5] After graduating from Connecticut, Eppler interned with the 
Washington Redskins of the National Football League.[5] The Colorado Rockies 
of Major League Baseball hired Eppler as a scout in 2000.[4] After the 
2004 season, he was hired to scout for the New York Yankees, working in 
the Tampa office run by Mark Newman and Damon Oppenheimer. When Yankees 
General Manager Brian Cashman was given the authority to restructure the 
Yankees' front office after the 2005 season, he created a professional 
scouting department and promoted Eppler to serve as its director.[4][6] 
In that role, Eppler and his staff were responsible for scouting acquisitions, 
which led to the signings of Bartolo Colón, Eric Chavez, Cory Wade, Freddy 
García, Russell Martin, Andruw Jones, and Luis Ayala.[7] He was promoted 
to Assistant General Manager during the 2011–12 offseason.[8] Eppler is 
well versed in the statistics of baseball, using them to sign Edwar Ramírez 
out of independent baseball.[9] In 2011, Eppler interviewed for the general 
manager opening for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was one of the 
finalists for the position, which went to Jerry Dipoto.[10] In August 2014, 
he interviewed to be the general manager for the San Diego Padres,[2] but 
the Padres hired A. J. Preller.[11] When the Arizona Diamondbacks fired 
Kevin Towers as their general manager in September 2014, Eppler was one 
of the five candidates they identified as a potential replacement.[12] 
Eppler declined to interview for the position,[13] and the Diamondbacks 
chose Dave Stewart.[14] In 2015, following Dipoto's resignation, Eppler 
again interviewed with the Angels for their general manager position.[15] 
The Angels hired Eppler as their general manager on October 4,[16] signing 
him to a four-year contract.[17] Later in October, the Angels lost front 
office executives Matt Klentak, Tim Bogar, and Scott Servais, who were 
hired by other organizations.[18] Eppler developed his own analytics department, 
and brought some executives, including special assistant Eric Chavez, to 
the Angels from New York.[17] Eppler and his wife, Catherine, married in
