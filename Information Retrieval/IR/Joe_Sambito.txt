Joseph Charles Sambito (born June 28, 1952) is a former pitcher in Major 
League Baseball who played for the Houston Astros (1976–1982, 1984), New 
York Mets (1985) and Boston Red Sox (1986–1987). He batted and threw left-handed. 
He graduated from Bethpage High School in Bethpage, New York A fastball 
and slider specialist, Sambito was a starter in the minors, as he led the 
Southern League in strikeouts at Triple-A Columbus in 1975. A year later 
he was promoted to the Astros, where he immediately moved into a relief 
role. From 1978 through 1981, Sambito led Houston in saves, with a career-high 
22 saves and a 1.78 ERA in 1979 – a season in which he posted a string 
of 40 2⁄3 consecutive innings without allowing an earned run and was named 
to the National League All-Star team. He started 1982 with four saves and 
a 0.71 ERA in nine appearances, before it was discovered that bone chips 
had damaged the ligaments of his pitching elbow. He missed the rest of 
the season and all of 1983 recuperating from Tommy John surgery. The next 
two years, he failed in comeback attempts with Houston and the New York 
Mets. Sambito made the Red Sox roster out of spring training in 1986. He 
would go on to post a 2–0 record with 12 saves that season, and helped 
the Red Sox reach the World Series. He retired in 1987 after posting a 
2–6 record with 6.93 ERA. In an eleven-season career, Sambito posted a 
37–38 record with a 3.03 ERA and 84 saves in 461 games. Following his retirement,
