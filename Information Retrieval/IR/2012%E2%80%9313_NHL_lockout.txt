The 2012–13 NHL lockout was a labour dispute between the National Hockey 
League (NHL) and the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) 
that began at 11:59 pm EDT on September 15, 2012. A tentative deal on a 
new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was reached on January 6, 2013, 
with its ratification and signing of a memorandum of understanding on the 
agreement completed by January 12, 2013, 119 days after the expiry of the 
previous CBA.[1][2] The owners of the league's franchises, led by NHL commissioner 
Gary Bettman, declared a lockout of the members of the NHLPA after a new 
agreement could not be reached before the expiry of the NHL collective 
bargaining agreement on September 16, 2012. The lockout shortened the 2012–13 
NHL season, originally scheduled to begin on October 11, 2012, from 82 
to 48 games, a reduction of 41.5 percent. The revised season started on 
January 19, 2013 and ended on April 28, 2013.[3] At issue for the owners 
were desires to reduce the players' guaranteed 57% share of hockey-related 
revenues, introduce term limits on contracts, eliminate salary arbitration, 
and change free agency rules. The union's initial offers focused on increased 
revenue sharing between owners and a fixed salary cap that is not linked 
to league revenues. As the deadline for a work stoppage approached, the 
union unsuccessfully challenged the league's ability to lock out players 
of three Canadian teams – the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames (in the 
jurisdiction of Alberta), and the Montreal Canadiens (in the jurisdiction 
of Quebec). The dispute was the third lockout in the 19 years since Bettman 
became Commissioner in 1993, following player lockouts in 1994–95 and 2004–05, 
with the latter case leading to the cancellation of the entire season. 
This was also the third labour dispute for NHLPA executive director Donald 
Fehr who, as head of the Major League Baseball Players' Association, led 
his union through a lockout in 1990 and a strike in 1994–95. During the 
lockout, many NHL players went to other leagues in North America and Europe. 
Many businesses in the United States and Canada located near NHL arenas 
lost money as a result of the games not played. All games on the original 
2012–13 NHL calendar up to January 14, 2013 were cancelled,[4] including 
the 2013 NHL Winter Classic between the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto 
Maple Leafs, which was rescheduled for 2014.[5] In addition, the 2013 All-Star 
Game, scheduled for January 27, was also cancelled.[6] The revised 48-game 
schedule resulted in the cancellation of 510 regular season games, comprising 
41.5 percent of the season. The owners identified their key issues in their 
first offer, presented on July 13, 2012. Their offer retained the framework 
established following the 2004–05 NHL lockout but made numerous changes 
to player salary and movement rights:[7] The players' union waited a month 
to offer a counter-proposal as it requested additional financial data from 
the league. When the union proposed it on August 14, it retained a salary 
cap, but de-linked it from revenue. It proposed a fixed cap for three years, 
followed by a players' option to return to the terms of the expired CBA 
in the fourth year. Fehr suggested their proposal could save the league 
as much as $465 million and would feature an enhanced revenue sharing system 
that would help lower-revenue teams.[8] The two parties exchanged a pair 
of offers as the deadline for a lockout approached. The union's last offer 
before the expiry of the collective bargaining agreement continued to call 
for an unlinked salary cap that would steadily increase over a five-year 
term. Donald Fehr argued that if the league continued to see revenue increase 
at the seven percent average of the 2005–2012 CBA, the players' share of 
revenues would drop from the 57 percent they received in 2011–12 to a low 
of 52 percent in 2015–16, but increase in the final two years of the deal 
back to 54 percent. The NHL countered with a time-limited offer where it 
would continue with the existing definition of hockey-related revenue and 
a linked salary cap that would pay the players 49 percent of revenues in 
2012–13 and fall to 47 percent by the sixth year of the deal.[9] Each side 
rejected the others' offer, and some veteran players expressed willingness 
to sit out an entire season if necessary.[10] The National Hockey League 
officially locked its players out when the CBA expired,[11] and on September 
19, cancelled all preseason games for the month of September.[12] Several 
players then signed contracts to play in European leagues for the duration 
of the dispute.[13] The NHLPA challenged the NHL's right to lock out the 
players in two Canadian jurisdictions. Sixteen members of the Montreal 
Canadiens unsuccessfully sought a temporary injunction from the Quebec 
Labour Relations Board that would prevent the team from locking its players 
out of practice facilities and would have required the Canadiens to pay 
its players regardless.[14] Twenty-one members of the Calgary Flames and 
Edmonton Oilers sought similar relief from the Alberta Labour Relations 
Board, but the board ruled in favour of the NHL.[15] Having cancelled the 
remainder of the preseason, and regular season games up to November 1,[16][17] 
on October 16, Bettman offered a 50–50 revenue split in the owners' latest 
CBA proposal. Two days later, the Players' Association presented three 
counterproposals. Both sides were still far apart when negotiations ended.[18] 
The league, which refused to negotiate with the NHLPA unless they used 
the league proposal as the starting point, withdrew its offer after negotiations 
failed.[19][20] Subsequently, on October 26, the NHL cancelled all games 
scheduled for November,[21] including the annual Hall of Fame game, scheduled 
for November 9 at the Air Canada Centre, and the Black Friday Thanksgiving 
Showdown scheduled to air on NBC.[22] In addition, the 2013 NHL Winter 
Classic was cancelled on November 2.[23] The league and players' association 
resumed negotiations on November 6, meeting over six consecutive days in 
a neutral, undisclosed location.[24] The NHL offered to pay a $211 million 
"make whole provision" over the first two years of the deal to honour existing 
player contracts; the NHLPA sought $590 million.[25] On November 21, the 
NHLPA made a new proposal that left the sides $182 million apart, which 
Bettman immediately rejected.[26] Two days later, all games up to December 
14 were cancelled, as well as the All-Star Game.[6] The NHL and NHLPA agreed 
to mediation under the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation 
Service on November 26.[27] The sides met with mediators on November 28 
and 29, but the mediators quit after that point, determining they could 
not make any progress reconciling the two parties' demands.[28] Following 
mediation, Bettman proposed a meeting between players and team owners to 
Donald Fehr, and Jamal Mayers tweeted that the NHLPA had made a similar 
offer to meet directly with owners.[29] From December 4 to 6, six team 
owners, 17–19 players, and staff from both sides met to negotiate and exchange 
proposals. The league offered to raise the "Make Whole" provision to $300 
million and to give ground on player contracting and pension issues, but 
identified three components of the CBA they considered important: a five-year 
limit on player contracts, a ten-year length of the new CBA, and compliance 
issues. The players offered an eight-year limit on contracts and an eight-year 
CBA with an opt-out clause after six years. The NHL rejected the offer, 
and talks broke down again. After negotiations failed, Bettman delivered 
a press conference saying the "Make Whole" provision would be pulled off 
the table. He also stated that the league would deny the union's request 
to bring mediators back into the negotiations.[30][31] Four days later, 
the NHL cancelled all games up to December 30.[32] After talks broke down, 
rumours leaked that the NHLPA planned on filing a "disclaimer of interest" 
(a quicker, less formal way to dissolve the player's union, compared with 
decertification)[33] and, with collective bargaining no longer in effect, 
pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the NHL. The NHL responded on December 
14 by filing a class action suit with the U.S. District Court in New York 
seeking to establish that its lockout is legal. Included in the lawsuit 
was a request for all existing player contracts to be "void and unenforceable", 
should the NHLPA be dissolved, resulting in all NHL players becoming free 
agents.[34] The league also filed an unfair labour practice charge with 
the National Labor Relations Board, stating that the union has been negotiating 
in bad faith and that its threat to disclaim interest is a negotiating 
ploy that violates the collective bargaining process.[35][36] In a vote 
conducted from December 17 to 21, the players authorized the union's executive 
board to file a disclaimer of interest, up until January 2, 2013, though 
it did not proceed with the filing.[37] On December 20, the league cancelled 
all games up to January 14, 2013.[4] After a Christmas hiatus, the league 
made another offer to the players on December 27. The offer was reportedly 
for a ten-year contract with an opt-out clause after eight, and included 
a US$60 million salary cap taking effect in 2013, a six-year term limit 
on player contracts (seven years for teams re-signing their own players), 
an increase in the allowed amount of variance year-to-year in player contracts 
to ten percent from the originally proposed five, and the make-whole provision 
remaining the same as the previous offer.[38] The proposal required a minimum 
48-game regular season schedule starting no later than January 19[39] which 
would be preceded by one week training camp, thereby requiring an agreement 
to be reached by January 11.[38] Face-to-face negotiations recommenced 
shortly thereafter.[40] With the expiry of the NHLPA's authorization to 
file a disclaimer of interest, the two sides continued to discuss three 
key issues: player pensions, the salary cap (with the players requesting 
a US$65 million cap for the second year of the collective bargaining agreement), 
and contract lengths.[41] Around 4:45 am EST on January 6, after approximately 
16 continuous hours of negotiating, a tentative deal was reached on a new 
collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout.[42][43] The terms included 
a limit of eight years on contract extensions and seven years on new contracts, 
a salary floor of US$44 million and a salary cap of US$60 million (a two-year 
transition period will allow teams to spend up to US$70.2 million in the 
deal's first season, prorated for the season length, and up to a salary 
cap of US$64.3 million in the second season), a maximum 50-percent variance 
in the salaries over the course of a contract, mandatory acceptance of 
arbitration awards under US$3.5 million, no realignment, and an amnesty 
period to buy out contracts that do not fit under the salary cap.[44][45] 
The NHL Board of Governors ratified the new CBA on January 9,[46] followed 
three days later by the ratification of the deal by the NHLPA members,[47] 
and the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the two parties, 
officially marking their agreement to the CBA.[2] A 48-game schedule was 
played, starting on January 19, 2013 and ending on April 28, 2013, with 
no inter-conference games.[3] As in the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the players 
had numerous options for playing professional hockey during the lockout. 
All players eligible for the American Hockey League were assigned to their 
AHL clubs leading into the lockout, as were players still eligible to play 
junior hockey.[48] More experienced players sought employment in European 
leagues such as the predominantly Russian Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), 
Finland's SM-liiga, Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), Austria's 
Erste Bank Hockey League (EBEL), the Czech Extraliga (ELH), the Slovak 
Extraliga, Switzerland's National League A (NLA), Norway's GET-ligaen, 
the United Kingdom's Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) and the Swedish Elitserien 
(SEL), the last of which largely resisted signing locked-out NHL players.[49][50] 
By November 15, over 170 NHL players had joined teams in Europe. Pavel 
Datsyuk, Ilya Kovalchuk, Evgeni Malkin, and Alexander Ovechkin were among 
the stars who returned to their native Russia. Nicklas Backstrom had also 
decided to play in Russia together with his teammate Ovechkin. Other players, 
such as Patrice Bergeron, Logan Couture, Patrick Kane, Rick Nash, Matt 
Duchene, Tyler Seguin, Jason Spezza, Max Pacioretty, John Tavares, Joe 
Thornton and Henrik Zetterberg, signed with teams in Switzerland.[51] The 
assignment of NHL players to the AHL caused a trickle-down effect that 
has pushed AHL players to the ECHL, ECHL players to lower leagues such 
as the CHL, FHL and SPHL, and marginal players from those leagues out of 
professional hockey.[52] With the large number of notable NHL players playing 
in Europe, American sports network ESPN signed a multi-platform deal with 
the KHL to televise the game of the week on its television and online platforms, 
a deal that cost the network less than US$100,000 in rights fees.[53] This 
was followed by another American television network, MSG, also securing 
rights for broadcasting select KHL games.[54] The 2012 Spengler Cup in 
Davos, Switzerland, also included a number of NHL players who would likely 
not have participated if not for the lockout.[55] Top NHLers, including 
Patrice Bergeron, Tyler Seguin, Jason Spezza, and John Tavares, helped 
Team Canada win its first Spengler Cup since 2007.[56] During the lockout, 
several NHL players threatened to not return if the lockout was to end. 
Lubomir Visnovsky was the only one not to report to his NHL team, the New 
York Islanders, for the delayed start of the season and was suspended by 
the Islanders. His agent said on January 26, 2013, that Visnovsky would 
report to the team by February 11. Gary Bettman stated that during the 
lockout, "the business is probably losing between $18 and $20 million a 
day and the players are losing between $8 and $10 million a day."[26] The 
league office cut employees' pay by 20 percent, and some teams laid off 
employees and cut pay, as well.[57] In Canada, businesses in areas with 
NHL teams were hurt because of the lockout.[58] Canadian lotteries also 
lost money.[58] Molson-Coors reported reduced sales in Canada, blaming 
the lack of sales on the arenas being empty and people not having hockey 
parties taking away many beer-buying opportunities.[59] In the United States, 
businesses located near NHL arenas were affected negatively due to the 
lockout.[60][61] Kraft Hockeyville 2013 was cancelled due to the lockout.[62] 
Hockey Day in Canada was moved from Lloydminster to Peterborough, with 
Lloydminster now scheduled to host the event in 2014.[63] During the lockout, 
NHL players participated in a few charity games. "Operation Hat Trick", 
a charity hockey game, was played at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City to 
raise money for Hurricane Sandy victims. The game, which was held on November 
24, 2012, saw the team captained by Brad Richards defeat the team captained 
by Scott Hartnell, 10-6. Some of the NHL players that also participated 
in the game included Henrik Lundqvist, Martin Brodeur, Andy Greene, Bobby 
Ryan, and James van Riemsdyk.[64] Because of the shortened season, hockey 
card manufacturers did not include many rookies (such as Nail Yakupov) 
in the season's product lines.[65] When the season started on January 19, 
2013, the Chicago Blackhawks began a streak of 24 consecutive games without 
a regulation loss, setting an NHL record. On June 24, the Blackhawks defeated 
the Boston Bruins to win the Stanley Cup.[66] The average attendance for
