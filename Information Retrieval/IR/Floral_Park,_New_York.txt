Floral Park is an incorporated village in Nassau County, New York, United 
States, on Long Island. The neighborhood of Floral Park in the New York 
City borough of Queens, is adjacent to the village. The village is at the 
western border of Nassau County, and is located mainly in the Town of Hempstead, 
while the section north of Jericho Turnpike is within the Town of North 
Hempstead. The population as of the US Census of 2010 is 15,863.[2] The 
area that is now Floral Park once marked the western edge of the great 
Hempstead Plains, and by some reports was initially known as Plainfield. 
Farms and tiny villages dominated the area through the 1870s when the development 
of the Long Island Rail Road Hempstead Branch and Jericho Turnpike cut 
through the area. Hinsdale had more than two dozen flower farms after the 
Civil War.[3] The present-day village of Floral Park was once called East 
Hinsdale.[4] In 1874 John Lewis Childs arrived in the area to work for 
C.L. Allen as a seed seller. After building his own seed and bulb business[5] 
and starting America's first seed catalog business, Childs bought a great 
deal of land in the area. To promote his own business and the local horticultural 
industry, Childs named the local streets after flowers and renamed the 
area Floral Park. The expansion of the Floral Park Post Office and nearby 
village businesses are attributed solely to the success of Childs' business.[6] 
When the local Post Office took the name Floral Park, the Long Island Rail 
Road followed suit by changing the name of the East Hinsdale station to 
Floral Park in 1888. Formerly part of Queens, Floral Park became part of 
the new county of Nassau in 1899, and it was incorporated as a village 
in 1908. Childs served as its first president starting that year.[7] In 
1903 the village boasted more than 200 acres (0.81 km2) of Childs' flower 
beds. The massive volume of his mail order business grew the local post 
office to such an extent that it drew comparisons with the post offices 
of Chicago, Baltimore, and Boston.[8] The western village boundary is the 
border of New York City. Floral Park is located at 40°43′26″N 73°42′21″W﻿
