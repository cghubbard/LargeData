Alfred Gorden "Alamazoo" Jennings (November 30, 1850 â€“ November 2, 1894) 
was an American professional baseball player who played in one Major League 
Baseball game as a catcher for the Milwaukee Grays on August 15, 1878.[1] 
In addition to his time as a player, he later became an umpire in both 
the major and minor leagues. It was during his one game for the Grays, 
that he is most remembered. He committed four errors, and allowed ten passed 
balls. His performance earned him his nickname of Alamazoo by sportswriter 
O. P. Caylor, with which he was referred to for the remainder of his life. 
Although he was born in Kentucky, he grew up in Cincinnati, and worked 
in various trades during times that didn't involve baseball games. Among 
these were as a laborer, driver, and a police officer. When he left baseball, 
he began an owner operated roasted corn business in Cincinnati, that was 
later expanded into Kentucky. He died at the age of 43 in 1894. Alfred 
Gorden Jennings was born in Newport, Kentucky on November 30, 1850,[1] 
but grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio.[2][3] His father was not around during 
his life, and his mother (whose name is only described as L. A.) had remarried 
a man named Snead by 1860, but was not living with him by the 1860 United 
States Census.[2][3] Jennings began playing for local baseball clubs in 
1868, first for the Red Oaks, and later for the Cincinnati Buckeyes.[4] 
By 1870, he was living with his brother John, and had listed his occupation 
as a corn laborer.[3] On December 24, 1871, he married Letitia Booth in 
Henry County, Kentucky.[5] Throughout the 1870s, he living in various addresses, 
and worked one time as an expressman.[6] In the 1880 census, he was again 
living with his mother, and both were categorized as widows/widowers, and 
his occupation was listed as a farmer.[7] In 1878, he was managing a baseball 
club in Delaware, Ohio, when the Milwaukee Grays of the National League 
visited the Cincinnati Reds on August 15. The Grays had a tough time filling 
all their playing positions due to multiple injuries, and enlisted Jennings 
to catch pitcher Mike Golden. During the game, he failed to collect a hit 
in three plate appearances, but did receive one base on balls. Defensively, 
however, he was officially charged with four errors, and 10 passed balls.[1] 
Milwaukee lost the game to Cincinnati 13-2. It was this performance that 
prompted sportswriter O. P. Caylor to give him his nickname of "Alamazoo".[4] 
About his one game at the major league level, Jennings stated: We were 
all mixed with our signs...I signed for an outcurve, and got an inshoot 
which broke a couple of fingers. 'Go ahead' I said, 'I'll stay here all 
day even if I have to stop them with my elbows! You can't drive me away!'.[4] 
The 10 passed balls set a record for catchers until Alex Gardner had 12 
in a game on May 10, 1884, also his only game at the major league level.[8][9] 
On why Jennings, with little to no playing experience, was called upon 
to catch the hard-throwing Golden, Caylor stated: He looked so large and 
handsome, so very like a catcher...that Manager Chapman was mashed, and 
straightway engaged him, and clinched the bargain with a dinner.[10] He 
endure his nickname for the remainder of his career, and sportswriters 
exaggerated his dismal performance more in the years afterward. He was 
also forced into retelling his experience many times in his life. In reading 
what Caylor had written, Jennings admitted: I read a few lines and wanted 
to fight. I read a few lines more and had to laugh.[10] The first game 
Jennings worked occurred in minor league baseball, when, in 1878, he was 
unable to play due to a broken thumb.[4] He began working as a major league 
umpire in 1882, when he worked two American Association games that were 
played locally in Cincinnati.[1] Later, in 1884, he was assigned to work 
Northwestern League games in Ft. Wayne, Indiana to replace Charlie Cushman 
who had been injured by a stone thrown by an 11-year-old boy, who he had 
ejected from the stands earlier in the game.[4][11] His work varied in 
1884. In addition to minor league games, he was also picked to call an 
AA game on August 10, and in September, he was hired by the Union Association 
to work the remainder of their season. He was used in Baltimore, Washington 
D. C., and Cincinnati.[1] For the 1885, he was hired by the Southern League, 
and he worked three AA games as well.[1][4] He appeared in major league 
games infrequently over the next few years, calling 11 AA games in 1887, 
and one game each in 1889 and 1891.[1] When not playing or umpiring, Jennings 
lived and worked in various places within his hometown of Cincinnati. Among 
those were as a driver and a watchman from 1881 to 1882 while residing 
at 65 Allison.[12][13] He later moved to 458 Main St,[14][15] then became 
a Cincinnati police officer by 1887.[16] He was still listed as a police 
officer through 1891, and living at both 458 and 562 Main St.[17][18] It 
was during this period of his life that he owned a roasted corn delivery 
business, first in Cincinnati, and quickly expanded it into Covington, 
Kentucky, and his birth city of Newport.[4] In 1893, he was listed as a 
peddler, but by 1894, he was listed as a laborer.[19][20] Jennings died 
in Cincinnati, at the age of 43, as a result of a surgical operation.[1][21]
