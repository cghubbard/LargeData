The 1976 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball. The 
Reds won their second consecutive National League West title with a record 
of 102-60, 10 games ahead of the runner-up Los Angeles Dodgers. They went 
on to defeat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1976 National League Championship 
Series in three straight games, and then win their second consecutive World 
Series title in four straight games over the New York Yankees. They were 
the third and most recent National League team to achieve this distinction, 
and the first since the 1921–22 New York Giants. The Reds drew 2,629,708 
fans to their home games at Riverfront Stadium, an all-time franchise attendance 
record.[1] The "Big Red Machine" was at the height of its power in the 
1976 season, with four future Hall-of-Famers (Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, 
Tony Pérez, and manager Sparky Anderson), the future MLB all-time hits 
leader Pete Rose, and a notable supporting line up including Dave Concepción 
at shortstop, and Ken Griffey, César Gerónimo, and George Foster in the 
outfield. The Reds retained their NL pennant by winning the NLCS in three 
games over the Phillies, and their second consecutive World Series title 
by defeating the Yankees in four games, becoming only the second team to 
sweep a World Series from the Yankees (following the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers). 
By sweeping both the Phillies and Yankees, the Reds became the first and 
only team to have a perfect postseason since the League Championship Series 
was started in 1969.[citation needed] Joe Morgan was the NL's Most Valuable 
Player for the second straight season and Johnny Bench was the World Series 
MVP. To celebrate the National League's 100th anniversary, the Reds and 
several other teams adopted pillbox-style caps.[citation needed] Infielders
