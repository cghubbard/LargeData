Vernard Arthur Hoscheit (April 1, 1922 – June 11, 2007) was an American 
professional baseball catcher, coach and manager. He served as a coach 
on four World Series championship Major League Baseball teams with the 
Oakland Athletics and the New York Mets. Hoscheit was the Mets' bullpen 
coach from 1984 to 1987, which included their World Series run in 1986. 
During that season's spring training, Hoscheit accurately predicted that 
the team would clinch the National League East Division title on September 
17, long before any regular season game was even played. Born in Brunswick, 
Nebraska, Hoscheit originally signed with the New York Yankees and was 
catcher in their farm system for 12 seasons starting in 1941. He missed 
the 1943–45 seasons because of World War II military service, but returned 
to hit .245 for the Binghamton Triplets in the Class A Eastern League, 
where his manager was Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Lefty Gomez. He also 
caught 25 games in 1947 for Binghamton while hitting .271. He hung on in 
the minor leagues until 1955, his best season being 1951, when he hit .354 
with 11 home runs and 109 RBIs for the McAlester Rockets of Class D Sooner 
State League. He managed in the lower levels of the Yankees' organization 
from 1948–59. Hoscheit also was an executive in minor league baseball. 
He was the general manager for the Quincy (1955–56), Peoria (1957), and 
Greensboro (1958–59) clubs, concurrent with being their field manager, 
and then became president of the Three-I League in 1960.[1] After the Three-I 
League disbanded following the 1961 season, Hoscheit joined the Baltimore 
Orioles and was a scout and minor league instructor (1962–67) and Major 
League coach (1968). He switched to Oakland and was a coach from 1969 to 
1974, earning World Series rings in his final three seasons.[1] He coached 
for the California Angels (1976) and was the Mets' Gulf Coast League manager 
in 1983. With the parent team, he served as bullpen coach when New York 
won the 1986 World Series. He became a minor league catching instructor 
for the Mets in 1988.[1] In retirement, Hoscheit returned to his native 
Nebraska, where he coached American Legion teams in Plainview, Nebraska 
for many years. He died at the Pierce Manor nursing home in Pierce, Nebraska
