As player As manager Oswaldo José "Ozzie" Guillén Barrios (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡiˈʎen]; 
born January 20, 1964) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player 
and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop for 16 seasons, 
primarily with the Chicago White Sox, from 1985 to 2000. He then managed 
the White Sox from 2004 to 2011 and the Miami Marlins in 2012. As a player, 
Guillén was respected for his passion, speed, hustle, intensity and defensive 
abilities and his ebullient love for the game.[1][2] In 2005, Guillen became 
the first Latino manager in major league history to win a World Series. 
To date, he remains the only Latino manager ever to do so. Guillén was 
a light-hitting, quick-handed shortstop, emerging from a line of Venezuelan 
shortstops that included Chico Carrasquel, Luis Aparicio (both White Sox 
players), Dave Concepción, and Omar Vizquel (who played for Guillen as 
a utility player for the White Sox).[3] He was originally signed as a free 
agent by the San Diego Padres in 1980.[4] In December 1984, he was traded 
to the Chicago White Sox as part of an eight-player trade, with Tim Lollar, 
Bill Long and Luis Salazar in exchange for LaMarr Hoyt.[4] In 1985, Guillén 
received both the American League Rookie of the Year and The Sporting News 
Rookie of the Year awards, becoming only the third rookie shortstop in 
major league history to win a fielding title.[5][6] He became known for 
his daring, aggressive style of play, as was demonstrated on August 2, 
1985 in a game against the New York Yankees.[7] With the game tied 5–5 
in the 11th inning, Guillén hit a two-out single and, then proceeded to 
steal second base.[7] When the next batter hit an infield single, Guillén 
never hesitated as he rounded third base, catching the Yankees defense 
off guard and scored the game-winning run.[8] In 1989, Guillén was the 
victim of a hidden ball trick twice. First on June 23 when Greg Brock tagged 
him out when Guillén, the runner at first base, took his lead, and then 
had to dive back to the base on a pick off throw from the pitcher. Brock 
held the ball instead of throwing it back to the pitcher, and when Guillén 
took his hand off the base to stand up, Brock tagged him out. On August 
5, Dave Bergman made the same play, holding onto the ball following a pick 
off throw. Guillén again dove to the base to beat the throw, and when he 
took his hand off the base to stand up, Bergman tagged him on top of the 
batting helmet without looking at him.[9] On April 21, 1992, Guillén suffered 
a severe knee injury in a collision with outfielder Tim Raines.[10] The 
injury caused him to miss almost the entire season, and subsequently diminished 
his defensive range as well as his stolen base output for the remainder 
of his career.[11][12] Guillén recovered in 1993 with his most productive 
season offensively, posting a .280 batting average, and career highs with 
4 home runs and 50 runs batted in, as the White Sox won the American League 
Western Division title.[11][13] He hit .273 and scored 4 runs in a losing 
effort, as the White Sox were defeated by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 
1993 American League Championship Series.[14] In October 1997, after 13 
seasons with the White Sox, Guillén was granted free agency status and 
signed a contract to play for the Baltimore Orioles.[4] In May 1998, the 
Orioles released him and he signed with the Atlanta Braves as a utility 
infielder.[4] He helped the Braves win the 1999 National League Championship 
Series against the New York Mets with a 10th inning, pinch hit single in 
Game 6 of the series that tied the score at nine runs apiece, as the Braves 
went on to win the game and the series.[15][16] The Braves would eventually 
lose to the New York Yankees in Guillén's only World Series appearance 
as a player.[17] After playing one year with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 
2000, he retired as a player at the end of the season. In a sixteen-year 
major league career, Guillén played in 1,993 games, accumulating 1,764 
hits in 6,686 at bats for a .264 career batting average along with 28 home 
runs, 619 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .287.[11] Guillén 
was an All-Star in 1988, 1990–1991, and won the Gold Glove Award in 1990.[11][18] 
He led American League shortstops twice in range factor, once in assists 
and once in fielding percentage.[11] Guillén's .974 career fielding percentage 
ranks him 40th overall among major league shortstops, ahead of both Luis 
Aparicio and Dave Concepcion.[19] While he was considered one of the best 
fielding shortstops in the American League, Guillén was often overlooked 
in post-season awards because his playing career coincided with that of 
Cal Ripken, Jr.[2] Guillén ranks among the White Sox all-time leaders in 
games played, hits, and at-bats.[20] As a hitter, he was known as a free 
swinger, posting one of the highest at bats per walk ratios in major league 
history.[21] Guillén played his entire Venezuelan Winter League career 
with Tiburones de La Guaira. Following his playing career, Guillén coached 
for the Montreal Expos in 2001 and 2002 and the World Champion Florida 
Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins) in 2003 before he was hired in 
the offseason to replace Jerry Manuel as the White Sox manager.[22] He 
received a standing ovation from the crowd of 37,706 Chicagoans when introduced 
before his first game as a manager at U.S. Cellular Field on April 13, 
2004. On May 30, 2005, the White Sox extended Guillén's contract, making 
the move while the team had the best record in the majors (33–17). In 2005, 
he led the White Sox to their first American League pennant since 1959, 
and their first World Series win since 1917 with a 4-game sweep of the 
Houston Astros. Guillén claimed that he might retire after the 2005 season 
should the White Sox win the World Series, but at the parade celebrating 
the World Champions he received cheers from the fans when he announced 
he would indeed return to manage the next season. The White Sox picked 
up the 2006 option on his contract, added two more years and included an 
option for the 2009 season. In November, Guillén was voted the 2005 American 
League Manager of the Year Award by the Baseball Writers Association of 
America.[23] On September 4, 2009, Guillén won his 500th game as manager 
of the Chicago White Sox as the White Sox defeated the Boston Red Sox by 
a score of 12–2.[24][25] Guillen has publicly stated that he feels the 
2003 steroids list should be released to the public.[26] Personal difficulties 
with White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams led to speculation dating 
back to October 2010 that the White Sox would allow Guillén out of his 
contract to manage the Marlins.[27] On September 26, 2011, an inability 
to get a contract extension worked out with the White Sox eventually led 
to his being released from his position, with the White Sox retaining the 
right to receive compensation should Guillén manage in the 2012 season.[28][29] 
On September 28, 2011, the Miami Marlins introduced Guillén as their new 
manager.[30] Robin Ventura replaced Guillén as manager of the White Sox. 
The Marlins sent Jhan Mariñez and Osvaldo Martínez to the Chicago White 
Sox as compensation for the hiring of Guillén by the Marlins, as Guillen 
had one year remaining on his contract with the White Sox.[30] The Marlins 
were expected to contend in their first year in their new park. However, 
an 8–18 June effectively ended their season, and they finished 69-93, their 
worst season since the start of the century. On October 23, 2012, Guillen 
was terminated from the Marlins, despite three years remaining on his contract, 
after making some inflammatory comments about Fidel Castro.[31][32] In 
February 2016, Guillen was hired to manage the Tiburones de La Guaira of 
the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League for the 2016–17 season.[33] 
Guillén married Ibis Cardenas in 1983. They have three sons: Ozwaldo "Ozzie" 
Jr. (born 1985), Oney (born 1986), and Ozney (born 1992).[35][36][37][38] 
Ozzie Jr. was born in Las Vegas, Nevada; his two younger brothers were 
born in Venezuela. When Ozzie Guillen turned 42 in January 2006, he, his 
wife, and son Oney became naturalized U.S. citizens.[39] Ozzie Jr. is the 
lead Spanish-language broadcaster on the White Sox radio network.[35][36] 
He is also the brother-in-law of former White Sox teammate Scott Radinsky.[40] 
Guillen is known for being somewhat eccentric and outspoken, which sometimes 
lands him in the middle of controversy.[41] He declined to join in the 
traditional visit to the White House after the 2005 White Sox World Series 
win.[42] In June 2006 he was quoted as calling Chicago Sun-Times columnist 
Jay Mariotti a fag.[43] He later apologized for offending any LGBT people, 
but did not back down in his criticism of Mariotti.[44] In 2010 he spoke 
against Arizona's new law to deal with illegal immigration. Guillen described 
illegal immigrants as "workaholics." "And this country can't survive without 
them," he said. "There are a lot of people from this country who are lazy. 
We're not. Prove me wrong. A lot of people in this country want to be on 
the computer and send e-mails to people. We do the hard work. We're the 
ones who go out and work in the sun to make this country better."[45] In 
August, Guillen said that Asian players were treated better than Latino 
players, stating that while it is common practice for major league clubs 
to provide a Japanese or Korean translator for their Asian born players, 
no such translator is provided for their Spanish-speaking Latin American 
ballplayers.[46] On April 10, 2012, Guillén was suspended for five games 
by the Marlins due to comments made about former Cuban president Fidel 
Castro. In a Time interview Guillen said, "I love Fidel Castro ... I respect 
Fidel Castro. You know why? A lot of people have wanted to kill Fidel Castro 
for the last [53] years, but that mofo is still here."[47][48][49] The 
fallout from those comments was a major factor in his ouster after the 
season; according to Marlins baseball operations chief Larry Beinfest, 
the Marlins' attendance flatlined after those remarks and never recovered.[32]
