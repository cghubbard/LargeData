United States Cellular Corporation, doing business as U.S. Cellular, is 
a regional carrier[1] which owns and operates the fifth-largest wireless 
telecommunications network in the United States, serving 4.9 million customers 
in 426 markets in 23 U.S. states as of the first quarter of 2016.[2] The 
company has its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. U.S. Cellular was formed 
in 1983 as a subsidiary of Telephone and Data Systems (TDS), Inc., which 
still owns an 84 percent stake. In compliance with federal law, U.S. Cellular 
works with National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to provide 
free AMBER Alerts via text messaging.[3] PC Magazine awarded U.S. Cellular, 
along with Verizon Wireless, a "Reader's Choice" for cellular service provider 
award in 2010, stating that it score highest in the customer service category.[4] 
J. D. Power and Associates rated U.S. Cellular as having "Highest in Wireless 
Call Quality Performance". The North Central Region (IL, IN, MI, OH, WI) 
has received the award from 2006-2011.[5][6] In Consumer Reports 2010 annual 
survey of wireless service providers, the company received the best score 
out of all of the national carriers.[7] Originally, U.S. Cellular used 
analog, then Digital AMPS "TDMA" cell phones in most markets, but the company 
started shifting over to 1xRTT CDMA technology in 2003. After the switch, 
U.S. Cellular has discontinued all analog and TDMA services. In 2009, U.S. 
Cellular started converting its network to EVDO which offers 3G speeds. 
U.S. Cellular is currently implementing use of LTE for its 4G network.[8] 
The company offers national 3G coverage through roaming agreements. Native 
coverage is mainly in the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, parts of the East 
and New England. Although headquartered in Chicago, U.S. Cellular did not 
offer service in the Chicago metropolitan area until it acquired territories 
from PrimeCo Communications between 2002 and 2003, after the formation 
of Verizon Wireless.[9] U.S. Cellular announced that it would start offering 
4G coverage to customers beginning in the first quarter of 2012. Just like 
the other larger wireless competitors, the company decided to go with LTE 
for its 4G coverage. The rollout was planned for selected cities in Iowa, 
Wisconsin, Maine, North Carolina, Texas and Oklahoma. These include some 
of U.S. Cellular's leading markets such as Milwaukee, Madison and Racine, 
Wis.; Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Davenport, Iowa; Portland, Bangor and 
Houlton, Maine; and Greenville, N.C.[10] As of November 14, 2012, U.S. 
Cellular has added additional 4G LTE markets, including Southern Oregon 
(Roseburg, Grants Pass, and Medford areas). US Cellular's LTE network is 
primarily built upon two low-frequency LTE bands; 12 and 5.[11] Through 
the agreement with Kingstreet Wireless,[12] US Cellular has access to the 
lower 700MHz A, B, and C blocks across most of their operating markets. 
Spectrum bandwidth on LTE includes, 5*5, or 10*10MHz on band 12 700MHz 
5*5MHz on band 5 850MHz 5*5, or 10*10MHz on band 4 AWS 1 Supplementary 
spectrum in the band 2 1900 PCS, and band 4 2100/1700 AWS 1 and 3 bands 
can be deployed across US Cellular's LTE network for additional capacity 
in the future. Furthermore, additional 850MHz Cellular spectrum could be 
refarmed from 1X CDMA to create a wider 10*10MHz channel allocated for 
LTE. [13] US Cellular has made plans to launch their first market with 
VoLTE during the first quarter of 2017. The company has begun VoLTE trials 
during 2016 and will continue upgrading equipment in select markets to 
allow the trial process to continue following the services official launch. 
[14] The company offers phones manufactured by Samsung, Motorola, HTC, 
LG, RIM, Huawei, Alcatel, Pantech and Apple.[citation needed] On December 
5, 2011 U.S. Cellular stated it was waiting for an LTE version of Apple's 
iPhone before selling the phone.[19] It was announced on May 3, 2013 that 
U.S. Cellular would offer the iPhone sometime during the year. On July 
12, 2012, U.S. Cellular began shipping preorders of the Samsung Galaxy 
S III.[20] On October 23, 2013, U.S. Cellular's web site began advertising 
that the iPhone 5s will be "Available November 8th", 2013. On November 
8, 2013, U.S. Cellular began offering Apple iPhone 5s, 5c, and 4s. On September 
19, 2014, U.S. Cellular was a Tier 1 provider of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 
6 Plus. On September 25, 2015, U.S. Cellular was a Tier 1 provider of the 
iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.[21] U.S. Cellular launched the Samsung Galaxy 
i800 Tablet PC in November, 2010. U.S. Cellular launched the Motorola Xoom 
Tablet PC in June, 2011. U.S. Cellular launched the Apple iPad Air and 
iPad mini on November 8, 2013. On October 1, 2010, U.S. Cellular unveiled 
its customer reward program as "The Belief Project".[22] On September 1, 
2015, U.S. Cellular shuttered the rewards program.[23] All Belief plans 
are nationwide with no additional roaming charges in the United States. 
These plans all include at no additional charge: incoming calls, nights 
& weekends starting at 7pm, and mobile-to-mobile calls between U.S. Cellular 
customers. At the beginning of the Belief Project, customers were only 
required to fulfill one twenty-four month agreement per line ("One-and-Done 
Contracts"). After the first initial contract, customers no longer had 
to sign contracts and could continue to buy new phones at promotional prices 
when eligible. However, as of Q3 2013, the "one-and-done" contract provision 
was discontinued on all plans, and, as of January 8, 2015, customers can 
no longer receive a device subsidy on most Belief Plans when eligible. 
Instead, they have to purchase devices at full cost without contract, or 
purchase devices on no-interest 24-month installment plans added to their 
monthly bills (see Shared Data Plans below). Customers on Belief Plans 
earned points each month as part of the Belief Rewards program and they 
could also be earned by referring customers or participating in other promotional 
activities. These points could be redeemed for early upgrades, free accessories, 
phones, overage "forgiveness" and ringtones and ringbacks. However, the 
Rewards Points program has been discontinued as of September 1, 2015. As 
of May 1, 2012, U.S. Cellular rolled out a new set of Belief Plans. The 
new plans retain all of the same free calling features as the previous 
Belief Plans and also applies to 'connected devices' (tablets, hotspots, 
and data cards) offering tiered data packages. Like many carriers, U.S. 
Cellular charges a fee ($10 per GB) for overage on data. Like the original 
Belief Plans, customers can no longer receive device subsidies when eligible, 
instead having to opt for full-price purchases or 24-month installments 
added to their monthly bills. Unlike Shared Data Plans, customers on Belief 
Plans do not receive plan discounts for full-price or installment purchases 
at the time of upgrade eligibility. The only option for subsidized upgrades 
is for customers to migrate to Shared Data plans. On October 13, 2013, 
U.S. Cellular unveiled its take on Shared Data plans. The plans are comparable 
to other carriers Shared Data options, but still include all of the same 
free calling features. A further enhancement to the Shared Data plans was 
unveiled during Q2 2014, where customers could opt to purchase devices 
under no-interest "installment agreements" in lieu of a device subsidy. 
The installment plans are based on the full device cost spread out over 
24 equal monthly installment payments, in addition to the cellular service 
cost. Customers who purchase equipment on installment plans receive discounts 
on their "connection charges" to their shared data plans, and pay lower 
activation fees on devices. There is also no penalty for early payoff for 
devices on installment plans. Customers who purchase devices under installment 
payments on shared data plans also have an "early upgrade" option to trade-in 
their devices after 18 payments in order to upgrade to a new device superseded 
by another installment agreement on the new device. In November, 2015, 
an enhancement was made to allow customers who purchase devices on installment 
plans to be able to "pay down" their devices in multiples of the device's 
monthly installment cost at any time. Thus, customers can now either pay 
off their devices in full at any time or make extra payments towards their 
devices. The company has its headquarters in almost 140,000 square feet 
(13,000Â m2) in the U.S. Cellular Plaza complex in O'Hare, Chicago, Illinois, 
near O'Hare International Airport.[24][25] U.S. Cellular's lease expired 
in September 2011. The company stated in 2008 that it hired CB Richard 
Ellis to help determine whether the company should stay in its current 
headquarters facility, move to central Chicago, or move to the Chicago 
suburbs.[25] The current address is 8410 W. Bryn Mawr, Suite 700, Chicago, 
IL 60631-3486.[26] The headquarters can be reached by phone at 773-399-8900.
