The 1933 Washington Senators was a season in American baseball. They won 
99 games, lost 53, and finished in first place in the American League. 
It was the third and final pennant of the franchise while based in Washington. 
The team was managed by Joe Cronin and played home games at Griffith Stadium. 
They lost in the World Series in 5 games to the New York Giants. It would 
be the last time a Major League Baseball postseason series would be held 
in Washington until the 2012 season. The Senators franchise, which moved 
to Minneapolisâ€“St. Paul after the 1960 season, has since won three American 
League pennants (1965; 1987; 1991) and two World Series (1987 and 1991) 
as the Minnesota Twins. Player-manager Cronin was selected to the All-Star 
team as the starting shortstop and finished second in MVP voting. He also 
led the Senators with 118 runs batted in. 19-year-old infielder Cecil Travis 
had five hits in his major league debut.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
