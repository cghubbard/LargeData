As player As general manager William Lamar "Billy" Beane III (born March 
29, 1962) is an American former professional baseball player and current 
front office executive. He is the Executive Vice President of Baseball 
Operations and minority owner of the Oakland Athletics of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Prior to his front office career, he played in MLB as an 
outfielder between 1984 and 1989 for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, 
Detroit Tigers, and Oakland Athletics. He joined the Athletics front office 
as a scout in 1990. He was named general manager after the 1997 season, 
and promoted to executive vice president after the 2015 season. A first 
round pick in the MLB draft by the Mets, Beane's playing career failed 
to meet the expectations of scouts, who projected him as a star. In his 
front office career, Beane has applied statistical analysis (known as sabermetrics) 
to players, which has led teams to reconsider how they evaluate players. 
He is the subject of Michael Lewis' 2003 book on baseball economics, Moneyball, 
which was made into a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt as Beane. Beane grew 
up in Mayport, Florida and San Diego, California, the child of a career 
military family.[1][2] His father, a naval officer, taught him how to pitch.[1] 
Beane attended Mt. Carmel High School in San Diego, where he excelled at 
baseball, football, and basketball.[1] The high school coach added Beane 
to the varsity baseball team for the last game of his freshman season.[1] 
Beane batted .501 during his sophomore and junior years of high school.[1][3] 
In his senior season, his batting average dropped to .300.[4] Despite the 
decrease in batting average, scouts were enamored with Beane's talent.[4] 
Beane gave up football to avoid an injury that could prematurely end his 
baseball career.[5] Despite this, Stanford University tried to recruit 
Beane on a joint baseball–football scholarship as the quarterback who would 
replace then-sophomore John Elway for the Stanford Cardinal football team.[5] 
The New York Mets, who had the first overall selection of the 1980 Major 
League Baseball Draft, considered choosing Beane with the first pick.[6] 
Because many teams believed Beane would attend Stanford and not sign with 
a professional team,[7] Beane fell to the 23rd overall pick in the draft 
where he was taken by the New York Mets, who were enamored with Beane's 
talent. The Mets had two other first round picks that year, allowing them 
to risk Beane not signing.[8] After visiting the Mets clubhouse, Beane 
decided to sign with the Mets for a $125,000 signing bonus ($359,602 in 
current dollar terms). Beane notes his decision to sign with the Mets instead 
of going to Stanford as the "only decision he would ever make in his life 
about money."[9] Believing Beane to be a more refined player than their 
top first-round pick, Darryl Strawberry, the Mets assigned Strawberry to 
play rookie ball with other high school draftees, while Beane was assigned 
to the Little Falls Mets of the Class A New York–Penn League, with players 
drafted out of college.[10] Beane struggled in his first season, batting 
.210.[11] He was unable to make the adjustments that were necessary when 
playing tougher competition. The Mets promoted Beane to the Lynchburg Mets 
of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 1981. After a solid season, 
he was promoted to the Jackson Mets of the Class AA Texas League in 1982.[11] 
While Strawberry was the league's most valuable player, Beane batted .220.[12] 
Beane began questioning himself, while his new roommate, Lenny Dykstra, 
succeeded with unwavering confidence and superior mental focus.[13] Beane 
remained in Jackson until 1984, when he received his first promotion to 
MLB, appearing in five games for the 1984 New York Mets. In 1985, Beane 
spent most of the season with the Tidewater Tides of the Class AAA International 
League, getting called up to the 1985 Mets for eight games. He batted .284 
for the Tides in 1985, leading the team with 19 home runs and 77 runs batted 
in.[14] Following the season, the Mets traded Beane with Joe Klink and 
Bill Latham to the Minnesota Twins for Tim Teufel and Pat Crosby, a minor 
league player.[15] The Twins entered spring training prepared to give Beane 
the job as their starting left fielder over incumbent Mickey Hatcher, but 
he dealt with injuries and ineffectiveness.[16] Beane appeared in 80 games 
for the 1986 Minnesota Twins, batting .216.[17] Beane also appeared in 
32 games for the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Twins 
sent Beane to their new Class-AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers of the 
Pacific Coast League (PCL), after spring training in 1987.[18] After batting 
.285 for Portland, Beane received a call-up to the Twins after the September 
1 roster expansion.[17][19] He appeared in 12 games for the 1987 Minnesota 
Twins. The Twins traded Beane to the Detroit Tigers for Balvino Gálvez 
during spring training in 1988.[20] He made the Tigers opening day roster 
that season as an injury fill-in,[21] and was optioned to Toledo in late 
April,[22] now serving as Detroit's Class-AAA affiliate, where he spent 
most of the season. During this time, he played in the same outfield as 
another player with nearly the same name – Billy Bean – and he also had 
a teammate with the name Rice.[23] Beane appeared in six games for the 
1988 Tigers. Granted free agency after the 1988 season, Beane signed with 
the Oakland Athletics, appearing in 37 games with the 1989 Athletics, batting 
.241 in 79 at bats.[24] Beane spent most of the season with the Class-AAA 
Tacoma Tigers of the PCL. He re-signed with the Athletics for the 1990 
season,[24] and he was sent down to the minor leagues at the end of spring 
training.[25] Weary of the lifestyle of a minor league player, Beane approached 
Athletics GM Sandy Alderson a day after he was reassigned to minor league 
camp in April 1990 and asked for a job as an advance scout.[26][27] Beane 
held this position through 1993, when he was promoted to assistant GM of 
the Athletics, tasked with scouting minor league players.[28][29] Under 
the ownership of Walter A. Haas, Jr., the Athletics appeared in three consecutive 
World Series, from 1988 through 1990, and had the highest payroll in baseball 
in 1991.[30] Haas died in 1995, and new owners Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann 
ordered Alderson to slash payroll.[31] To field a competitive roster on 
a limited budget, Alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles, to 
obtain relatively undervalued players. He valued on-base percentage among 
hitters.[32] Alderson taught Beane to find value that other teams did not 
see using sabermetrics.[33] Beane succeeded Alderson as GM on October 17, 
1997.[34] He continued Alderson's crafting of the Athletics into one of 
the most cost-effective teams in baseball. For example, in the 2006 MLB 
season, the Athletics ranked 24th of 30 major league teams in player salaries 
but had the 5th-best regular-season record.[35] The Athletics reached the 
playoffs in four consecutive years from 2000 through 2003, losing in the 
American League Division Series each year. In 2002, the Athletics became 
the first team in the 100 plus years of American League baseball to win 
20 consecutive games. They won their first playoff series under Beane in 
2006 when they swept the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division 
Series, but were subsequently swept by the Detroit Tigers in the American 
League Championship Series. Other low payroll teams, such as the 2003 World 
Champion Florida Marlins and the 2008 American League Champion Tampa Bay 
Rays, have appeared in the World Series, with the former going on to win 
the World Series in 2003. It's all about evaluating skills and putting 
a price on them. Thirty years ago, stockbrokers used to buy stock strictly 
by feel. Let's put it this way: Anyone in the game with a 401(k) has a 
choice. They can choose a fund manager who manages their retirement by 
gut instinct, or one who chooses by research and analysis. I know which 
way I'd choose." After the 2002 season, the Boston Red Sox made Beane an 
offer of $12,500,000 to become their GM,[33] but he declined.[37] On April 
15, 2005, Beane received a contract extension to remain with the Athletics 
as its general manager through 2012, and new team owner Lewis Wolff awarded 
Beane a small portion of the team's ownership.[38] In February 2012, the 
Athletics extended Beane's contract through 2019.[39] From their 2006 playoff 
appearance until 2012 when they again made the playoffs, the Athletics 
had not made the playoffs or finished above .500, which had triggered criticism 
of Beane and his approach in some quarters in baseball, especially in 2009.[36] 
Beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach, indicating that his 
philosophy revolves around research and analysis.[36] Many other general 
managers have followed Beane's strategy and now use similar approaches.[40] 
Illustrating this example, Beane began concentrating on high school players, 
a group he once largely ignored, in the MLB draft, considering them to 
be heavily undervalued.[36] He and other like-minded GMs also changed their 
draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills, which had become undervalued 
in the years immediately after the Moneyball revolution. This new emphasis 
on defense was displayed in the 2010 season; although the Athletics finished 
at .500 and again missed the playoffs, they led MLB in defensive efficiency, 
measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted 
in outs, and allowed the fewest runs in the AL.[41] In the 2012 season 
the Athletics again made the playoffs under Beane winning the American 
League West title on the last day of the regular season. The Athletics 
returned to the playoffs in 2013 by also winning the American League West 
division title in the 2013 season, the team's first back-to-back division 
championships since the 2002–2003 seasons. In December 2009, Sports Illustrated 
named Beane as number 10 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the 
Decade in all sports.[42][a] On October 5, 2015, the Oakland Athletics 
announced that Beane had been promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball 
Operations. Assistant GM David Forst assumed the job of general manager.[43] 
When the Athletics ownership group agreed to purchase the reincarnation 
of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, Beane, who has expressed 
a passion for soccer, began developing a system for objectively analyzing 
soccer players. He has agreed to help the Earthquakes front office develop 
a method for building a cost-effective team, as the salary cap in MLS is 
even more restrictive than the Athletics status as a small-market team 
in Major League Baseball.[44] However, a system has yet to be implemented. 
Beane has claimed that Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger is a personal idol. 
His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan 
Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football.[45] 
In March 2015, the Dutch football club AZ Alkmaar, under general director 
Robert Eenhoorn, a former Major Leaguer, hired Beane as an advisor.[46] 
On January 4, 2007, the software company NetSuite named Beane to its board 
of directors. NetSuite co-founder Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to 
combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve 
him in the company.[47] Beane also served as a consultant for, and also 
appears in, the video game MLB Front Office Manager.[48][49] Because of 
his team's success despite its low payroll, Beane was the subject of author 
Michael Lewis's 2003 best-selling book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an 
Unfair Game. The book discusses Beane's methods as the GM of the Athletics 
and how he, along with Harvard-educated statistician Paul DePodesta,[50] 
used sabermetric principles to run his team in a cost-effective way. According 
to the book, this allowed him to be successful despite his financial constraints. 
The book and Beane's methods have influenced the way many think about the 
game of baseball, including other teams and players.[51] Brad Pitt played 
the role of Beane in the 2011 film Moneyball.[36] Pitt was nominated for 
an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his portrayal of 
Beane.[52] Twice married, Beane has a daughter Casey from his first marriage 
and twins Brayden and Tinsley from his current marriage.[36][53] He attended 
the University of California, San Diego during the baseball offseasons
