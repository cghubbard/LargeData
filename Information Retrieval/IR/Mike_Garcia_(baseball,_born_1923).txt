Edward Miguel "Mike" Garcia (November 17, 1923 – January 13, 1986), nicknamed 
"Big Bear" and "Mexican Mike", was an American right-handed pitcher in 
Major League Baseball (MLB). Garcia was born in San Gabriel, California, 
and grew up in Orosi, Tulare County. He entered minor league baseball at 
the age of 18. After one season, he joined the U.S. Army and served for 
three years. Following his military discharge, Garcia returned to baseball. 
He was promoted to the MLB in 1948. He played 12 of his 14 major league 
seasons for the Cleveland Indians. From 1949 to 1954, Garcia joined Bob 
Lemon, Early Wynn, and Bob Feller on the Indians' "Big Four" pitching staff. 
Historians consider the "Big Four" to be one of the greatest starting pitching 
rotations in baseball history.[1]:p.84[2]:p.31[3] During those six seasons 
with the "Big Four", Garcia compiled a record of 104 wins against 57 losses. 
He had two 20-win seasons and led the American League (AL) in earned run 
average (ERA) and shutouts twice each. Garcia's best season came in 1954 
when the Indians won a league record 111 games. Baseball historian Stephen 
Lombardi said that Garcia may have been the best AL pitcher that year.[4]:p.133 
Garcia remained with the Indians until 1959, but never duplicated the success 
he had achieved in 1954. In his last five seasons with Cleveland, he finished 
with losing records three times. After leaving the Indians, Garcia spent 
a season with the Chicago White Sox and a season with the Washington Senators. 
Garcia retired from baseball in 1961. He developed diabetes within a few 
years and suffered from kidney disease and heart problems until his death. 
Garcia died outside of Cleveland at the age of 62 and was buried in his 
home state of California. He was the only member of the "Big Four" not 
elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, but he has been included 
on a list of the 100 Greatest Indians and has been inducted into the Cleveland 
Indians Hall of Fame. Baseball experts and former teammates have commented 
on Garcia's overpowering pitching, his fine control and his low ERA. Garcia 
was born in San Gabriel, California. He grew up on a ranch in Orosi, California, 
where his Indigenous Mexican father, Merced Garcia, moved the family when 
Mike was 2. Mike's father raised horses, and Mike aspired to race them. 
He participated in one race and was thrown from the horse. Garcia played 
four years of high school baseball, the first three years at Orosi High 
School and the last at Visalia High School.[5] Garcia was pitching in semipro 
baseball when Cleveland Indians scout Willis Butler noticed him in Tulare, 
California. In 1942, Butler signed him as an amateur free agent to the 
organization's Class D farm team, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin 
State League.[5] Garcia earned a 10–10 win–loss record with Appleton.[6] 
He spent the next three years as a signalman in the United States Army 
during World War II.[7] Garcia was discharged from the Army at the age 
of 22 and returned to the Cleveland organization. He played for the Class 
C Bakersfield Indians of the California League. With Bakersfield, Garcia's 
ERA and strikeouts led the league and he earned 22 wins.[5] In 1947 he 
joined the Cleveland Indians during spring training, but he was assigned 
to the Class A Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League by Cleveland coach 
Bill McKechnie. He finished the season with 17 wins and a 3.24 ERA.[5] 
In 1948, he pitched for the Double-A Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas 
League and earned 19 wins.[5] Garcia debuted with the Indians on October 
8, 1948, just before the Indians played in the 1948 World Series. He allowed 
three hits and no runs in two innings, and he struck out one batter.[8] 
The Indians won the World Series in six games. It was the franchise's second 
World Series victory, but Garcia did not make a World Series appearance.[9] 
Nicknamed "The Big Bear" by teammate Joe Gordon for his large frame, Garcia 
was listed at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m), 200 lb (91 kg) during his career. 
Garcia said that his actual playing weight was between 215–220 lb (97–100 kg). 
Garcia also acquired the nickname "Mexican Mike" in the press.[10][11] 
However, Garcia's minority status was not a novelty. The Indians had signed 
Larry Doby, the first black player in the American League, in 1947. The 
1951 team would add manager Al López and Latino players Minnie Miñoso and 
Jesse Flores to a squad that already included Garcia and Mexican player 
Bobby Ávila.[12][13] Early on, Garcia was paired to room with Avila, who 
had just signed with the team and did not speak English.[14] Garcia served 
as a translator for Avila well beyond their first season together.[15]:p.127 
Garcia returned to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that 
Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action 
as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular 
season appearances.[16][17] He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, 
a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher 
Bob Feller said, "From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. 
For a big guy, he was certainly mobile."[18] One year removed from his 
rookie season, expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg 
and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of 
the Indians' rotation. "Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great 
pitcher. I see no reason he should not reach greatness this season", Greenberg 
said.[19] Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11. By the 1951 season, media 
sources had given the nickname "Big Four" to the pitching combination of 
Garcia, Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and Early Wynn.[20] Garcia had learned to 
control the curveball that Harder taught him in spring training of 1949.[1]:p.215 
Harder said that Garcia already had a terrific fastball, but that he became 
a good pitcher by learning the curveball and working on his control.[21] 
Cleveland sportswriter Hal Lebovitz wrote, "Garcia, until the day he died, 
would tell me how much of the success he owed to Harder."[2]:p.86 Garcia 
also once admitted to throwing an occasional spitball, an illegal pitch. 
"Maybe a dozen in my life. I'm sure plenty of the great pitchers did", 
he said.[2]:p.31 Garcia pitched a 10-hit complete game on June 4, 1951 
in an 8–2 Cleveland win, helping the Indians beat New York Yankees pitcher 
Ed Lopat for the first time in two years. Before the game, Lopat's record 
was 8–0 on the season. Garcia improved his season mark to 5–3.[22][23] 
On August 7 against the St. Louis Browns, Garcia reached a career-high 
15 wins. In a 5–1 victory, he also recorded his second career home run.[24] 
Garcia won 20 games in 1951 and finished fifth in the AL with six saves. 
In 1952, Garcia made his first of three consecutive All-Star teams. As 
the Indians battled for the 1952 American League pennant heading into September, 
he began the month with three consecutive shutouts during an eight-game 
Indian win streak.[25] The Indians faced Ed Lopat and the Yankees again 
on September 14 in what Associated Press columnist Jack Hand labeled "one 
BIG game."[26][27] In a 7–1 loss, Garcia gave up four earned runs on five 
hits in three innings.[26] He finished the 1952 season with a 22–11 record, 
143 strikeouts, an AL-best six shutouts and four saves. He was second in 
the league in ERA (2.37), games (46) and innings pitched (292.1, behind 
Lemon). Only Wynn had more wins (23) among right-handers; Garcia and Lemon 
had 22 each, and the pair tied for the league lead with 36 starts.[28] 
Garcia finished ninth in the 1952 MVP voting. In 1953, Garcia and Lemon 
were named pitchers on the AL All-Star squad. Doby and Al Rosen were also 
on the team, with Rosen selected as the game's MVP.[29] Garcia finished 
the season 18–9; he pitched a career-high 29 complete games with 134 strikeouts 
and a 3.25 ERA. Like the previous season, Lemon and Garcia finished first 
and second in the American League in innings pitched.[16][30] Garcia was 
labeled "one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the game" by The Cleveland 
Press Guide.[1]:p.215 As Feller's dominance faded in the latter part of 
his career, Garcia, Lemon, and Wynn were increasingly referred to as the 
"Big Three".[31] On May 16, 1954, Garcia pitched a one-hitter against the 
Philadelphia Athletics in a 6–0 Indians win.[32]:p.173[33] Garcia called 
it the finest game of his career.[15]:p.103 He was selected for his third 
and final All-Star Game when American League manager Casey Stengel added 
him, Lemon, and Doby to an American League roster that already featured 
Avila and top vote-getter Al Rosen.[15]:p.203[34] During a late July exhibition 
game, Garcia learned that his father had died at the age of 65; Garcia's 
son Michael was born the same day.[35] He missed several games that year 
with a broken blood vessel in his throwing hand, but he managed 45 appearances 
on the season.[33][36]:p.138 Entering the final regular season game in 
1954, Garcia had 19 wins; he would have received a bonus if he collected 
20 wins. After pitching 12 innings, he left with the score tied at 6–6. 
The Tigers won after 13 innings, 8–7. Earning a no-decision, Garcia failed 
to reach the 20-win mark.[37] However, Greenberg had assured Garcia he 
would receive a bonus whether he won 20 games or not.[2]:p.255 Garcia pitched 
six innings or more in six out of his seven August appearances. He earned 
wins in three out of his last four appearances, and pitched seven innings 
or more in all four appearances.[33] The team finished 111–43. The win 
total broke a 154-game season record, and the team had the lowest team 
ERA (2.78) in the AL since the Dead-ball era season of 1919.[38][39][40][41] 
Garcia was 19–8 with 129 strikeouts, again leading the AL in both ERA (2.64) 
and shutouts (5).[16] In the 1954 World Series, the heavily favored Indians 
were defeated by the New York Giants.[42] Garcia started game three, but 
was replaced by a pinch hitter in the bottom of the third inning, already 
trailing 4–0. Author Jonathan Knight described the progression of the game: 
"...a throwing error by George Strickland, and Mike Garcia had struggled 
in the opening frame, allowing three baserunners, as panic began to creep 
into Municipal Stadium. For the first time all year, it was warranted."[15]:p.176 
The Giants won the game, 6–2, and would win game four to claim the Series.[43] 
From 1955–1959, Garcia finished with losing records in three of five seasons.[16] 
The 1955 season represented Garcia's first losing record (11–13) and his 
first season ERA over 4.00. The 1954 ERA leader finished 1955 with a 4.02 ERA.[16] 
The Indians finished in second place in the AL at 93–61, three games behind 
the Yankees.[44] Garcia repeated a losing mark on the 1956 season (11–12), 
the only time in his career he finished with consecutive losing seasons.[16] 
He and Wynn were among those who tied for second place in shutouts on the 
season (4) behind fellow Indian Herb Score.[45] Cleveland finished 88–66 
and nine games behind first place, which went to the Yankees again.[46] 
Lopez was replaced as manager by Kerby Farrell. In spring training before 
the 1957 season, Farrell observed that the league's best pitching staff 
could not carry the team alone.[47][48] Garcia ended the season 12–8 with 
a 3.75 ERA, but the Indians finished sixth in the American League. Their 
76–77 finish was the club's first losing record since 1946.[49] Bobby Bragan 
replaced Farrell as manager to begin the 1958 season.[50] During a spring 
training game in March, Garcia slipped on a wet pitcher's mound and injured 
his back. He did not make his first regular season appearance until April 
27 and he underwent surgery in June for a herniated disc. He finished the 
season with a 1–0 record in six appearances and eight innings of work.[7][51][52] 
That same month, Bragan was fired as manager. He was replaced by former 
Indians player Joe Gordon, and the Indians finished 77–76.[53][54] Garcia 
elected to become a free agent in the offseason, but he returned to the 
Indians, saying that his home and his dry cleaning business were in Cleveland. 
"Everything being equal, I'll sign with the Indians if I decide I'm able 
to pitch... This is a friendly city and I like it", he said.[7] During 
a spring training game in March 1959, Garcia was hit in the knee by a Billy 
Consolo line drive and was carried off the field on a stretcher and taken 
to a Tucson hospital.[55] He did not make his first season start until 
May 3, when he allowed four hits and no earned runs in a complete game 
loss.[56][57] He finished with a 3–6 record, a 4.00 ERA and 72 innings 
pitched in his twelfth and final season with the Indians.[16] Garcia signed 
with the Chicago White Sox for the 1960 season, reuniting with manager 
Al López and former Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck. Veeck 
said, "Our reports on Mike were real good. He might help us in 1960."[58] 
He appeared in 15 games and pitched 17.2 innings with 4.58 ERA and 0–0 
record.[16] In July 1961, the expansion Washington Senators signed the 
37-year-old Garcia to a contract.[59] The Senators placed him on waivers 
before the end of the season.[60] He finished with a 0–1 record, pitched 
19 innings in 16 games and earned a 4.74 ERA.[16] Garcia finished his major 
league career with a 142–97 record, 1,117 strikeouts, a 3.27 ERA, 27 shutouts 
and 23 saves in 428 games (281 starts) and 2,174.6 innings. Garcia married 
Gerda Martin on January 13, 1951; they had three children.[35] He served 
as a sponsor for Camel cigarettes during his playing days.[61] Garcia raced 
midget cars during and after his baseball career.[5][62] Garcia injured 
the index finger of his throwing hand while working on a midget car in 
late 1959, but the wound was repaired without lasting effects.[63] Garcia 
developed diabetes in his forties. As a result, he suffered from kidney 
disease and heart damage in the last years of his life.[64] Faced with 
dialysis three times per week, Garcia joined his former teammates at fundraising 
events to defray his medical expenses. He died in Fairview Park, Ohio on 
January 13, 1986 at the age of 62. He died on his thirty-fifth wedding 
anniversary. He was buried in his hometown of Visalia, California.[62] 
Garcia, whose annual salary was never greater than $35,000, died with more 
than $100,000 in outstanding medical bills.[65][66] Garcia was not selected 
a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His normal window of eligibility 
has closed, and he would only be elected by decision of the Hall's Veterans 
Committee. Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia's low ERA due 
to the "cold, cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which at that time 
had a pitcher's mound higher than white cliffs of Dover". Referring to 
Garcia's great seasons of 1949 to 1954, baseball historian Wayne Corbett 
countered, "Garcia's more famous teammates enjoyed the same home-field 
advantage, but it was Garcia who recorded the staff's lowest ERA in four 
of those six seasons."[5] Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote, "It is a shame 
that Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded. A career such as his does not 
deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public."[4]:p.132 
Cleveland sportswriter and Hall of Fame voter Hal Lebovitz wrote, "If Garcia 
had pitched long enough, he probably would be in the Hall of Fame."[2]:p.86 
Teammates have recalled the difficulty that Garcia presented for opposing 
hitters. George Strickland, who roomed with Garcia on road trips for several 
seasons, described Garcia as "a big, strong, powerful pitcher" who threw 
a "very heavy ball."[2]:p.181[67] Bob Lemon describes his pitches similarly. 
"Hitting a Garcia pitch was like hitting a shotput", Lemon said.[65] Lemon 
also commented on his deceptive control. "Mike was a sneak. His physical 
size belied really fine control", said Lemon.[25] Garcia was named one 
of the 100 Greatest Indians in March 2001 and inducted into the Cleveland 
Indians Hall of Fame on August 11, 2007.[68][69][70] Each year, the Indians 
organization gives the Mike Garcia Award to an area high school student 
who demonstrates "outstanding success in the classroom, on the field, and
