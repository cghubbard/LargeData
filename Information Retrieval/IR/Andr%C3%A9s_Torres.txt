Andrés Yungo Torres Feliciano Jr.,[1] (born January 26, 1978) is an American 
former professional baseball center fielder. He stands 5 feet 10 inches 
(1.78 m) tall and weighs 195 pounds (88 kg) and is a switch-hitter. Torres 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers, 
New York Mets and San Francisco Giants. Born in New Jersey, Torres grew 
up in Puerto Rico before returning to the United States to attend Miami-Dade 
Community College. He was a track star at Miami-Dade and did not begin 
playing baseball until later. In 1998, he was drafted by the Detroit Tigers 
in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. Torres played 
in their minor leagues until 2002, when he made his major league debut. 
In 2003, he got a chance to be the everyday center fielder for the Tigers, 
but after 23 games they chose to replace him. He played only three games 
for them in 2004 before he was outrighted to the minors and released upon 
request. In 2005, Torres resurfaced with the Texas Rangers but only appeared 
in eight games. He spent the next three years in the minor leagues. Torres 
returned to the majors in 2009, as a reserve outfielder for the San Francisco 
Giants. In 2010, he became their everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter, 
winning the Willie Mac Award and helping the team win its first World Series 
since 1954. After the 2011 season (in which Torres battled injuries and 
lost playing time in September), he was traded to the New York Mets. He 
spent one season with the Mets, starting in center field for the most part 
except for a stretch in which he platooned with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, before 
re-signing with the Giants in 2013. He was used in a platoon split with 
Gregor Blanco in 2013 before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury 
in August. After going unsigned to begin 2014, Torres signed a minor league 
deal with the Boston Red Sox in June, but opted out of his contract in 
late July after not getting called up. Torres was born in Paterson, New 
Jersey, and moved to Aguada, Puerto Rico with his family when he was one 
year old.[2][3] He played very little baseball as a child in Puerto Rico, 
and did not become serious about becoming a professional baseball player 
until he was 18.[4][5] He attended Dr. Carlos Gonzalez High School and 
Miami-Dade Community College.[6] At Miami-Dade, he was a track and field 
star, running the 100 meters in 10.37 seconds.[7] In 1997, the Florida 
Marlins drafted him in the 23rd round of the Major League Baseball Draft, 
but he chose not to sign.[8] He was then drafted by the Detroit Tigers 
in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft, and that time 
he signed.[9] Torres failed to bat higher than .236 his first two years 
in the minors, but he did steal several bases. However, in 2000, while 
playing for the Single-A advanced Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State 
League, Torres posted what was arguably the best minor league season in 
his career. With Lakeland, he batted .296 while leading the league with 
65 stolen bases.[10][11] During that season, he was promoted to the Double-A 
Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League for a short period of time; however, 
he struggled with Jacksonville, batting just .148. Detroit switched their 
Double-A affiliate to the Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League in 2001; 
Torres spent the season with them but was limited to 64 games because of 
shoulder surgery.[5] He batted .294 with 74 hits and 19 stolen bases.[10] 
Torres was considered Detroit's "leadoff hitter of the future" in 2002, 
according to Jason Beck of MLB.com.[12] He began the season with the Triple-A 
Toledo Mud Hens of the International League but was soon called up by the 
Detroit Tigers on April 7.[6] He made his major league debut that same 
day and notched his first hit, a triple against CC Sabathia in a 5–1 loss 
to the Cleveland Indians.[13] He batted .211 and was sent back to Toledo 
on April 26 after he had no hits in 12 at bats during a series against 
the Kansas City Royals.[12] In 115 games for Toledo, Torres batted .266, 
tying Nick Punto for the league lead with 42 stolen bases, tying Omar Infante 
for fourth in the league in triples (eight), and finishing fourth in the 
league with 80 runs scored.[14] The Tigers initially chose not to call 
up Torres in September when rosters expanded; he did not rejoin them until 
September 20 following injuries to Bobby Higginson and Hiram Bocachica.[15] 
In 19 games (70 at bats) with the Tigers, Torres batted .200 with 14 hits, 
three runs batted in (RBI), and two stolen bases.[6] The next season, Torres 
failed to make the Tigers out of spring training, but he split the season 
between Detroit and Toledo. He was called up on April 29 to play centerfield 
and bat leadoff for the Tigers.[6] After he batted .224 in 23 games, the 
Tigers traded for Alex Sánchez on May 27 to replace Torres in centerfield 
and sent Torres to Toledo to make room for Sánchez.[16][17] He was recalled 
on June 18 to be a reserve outfielder when Ernie Young was designated for 
assignment.[18] On this stint, Torres tried to improve his hitting by batting 
exclusively right-handed, saying, "I feel better from the right side."[19] 
He batted .208 in 23 games on this stint before being sent back to Toledo 
on August 2 to make room for A. J. Hinch to return from the disabled list.[20] 
Torres was recalled one final time, in September.[6] On September 14, Torres 
hit his first home run, a solo shot off of Jimmy Gobble of the Royals in 
a 7–2 loss.[21] In 59 games (168 at bats) with the Tigers, he batted .220 
with 37 hits, one home run, and five stolen bases.[6] Despite playing only 
70 games in Toledo, Torres finished fifth in the International League with 
27 stolen bases.[10][22] Torres was initially sent to the minors to begin 
2004 but was recalled on April 7 without playing a game for Toledo when 
Dmitri Young broke his leg.[6][23] He only appeared in three games (and 
didn't even have a plate appearance) before the Tigers attempted to outright 
him to the minors. Instead of going to the minors, Torres requested his 
release. He was granted free agency on April 22.[5] Just four days after 
getting released by the Tigers, Torres signed with the Chicago White Sox. 
He spent the rest of the 2004 season with the International League Charlotte 
Knights (outside a six-game rehab stint), batting .295 with 95 hits in 
87 games and tying with Jason Tyner for eighth in the league in stolen 
bases, with 23.[24] After the season he filed for free agency.[25] On November 
16, 2004, Torres was signed by the Texas Rangers.[25] He started 2005 with 
the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League, but he only 
played in 15 games (due to a sprained right shoulder) before getting called 
up by the Rangers on May 15 when Gary Matthews, Jr., went on the disabled 
list.[6][26] However, the Rangers designated him for assignment on June 
12 and outrighted him to Oklahoma City on June 17 after he batted .158 
in eight games with them.[25][27] Torres suffered a right abdominal strain 
a week later which ended his season.[6] Torres signed with the Minnesota 
Twins on December 25, 2005. He spent the entire 2006 season with the Triple-A 
Rochester Red Wings of the International League, batting .236 with them 
in 116 games and tying for second in the league with nine triples (tied 
with Joe Thurston behind Wayne Lindon's 12).[10][28] He became a free agent 
after the season.[25] Unsigned through February in 2007, Torres called 
the Detroit Tigers and asked for a job.[29] The Tigers signed him on March 
2 and assigned him assigned to Erie, where he was named the Eastern League 
Player of the Week for April 30 through May 6 after he batted .550. He 
batted .292 with 17 stolen bases in 85 games before being promoted to Toledo. 
His 11 triples led the Eastern League despite the fact that he only appeared 
in 85 games.[6] At Toledo, Torres also batted .292 in 42 games. He was 
caught stealing bases (six) more times than he stole successfully (five), 
but in only 42 games, he managed to tie for second in the league with nine 
triples (tied again with Thurston behind Brian Bixler's 10).[30] Following 
the year, he again filed for free agency.[25] On November 20, 2007, Torres 
signed with the Chicago Cubs.[25] In 2008, he engaged a private hitting 
instructor named Chris O'Leary to help him out. He began trying to model 
his swing after Albert Pujols, instead of merely trying to put the ball 
on the ground and run to first base, which is what he had been doing.[31] 
He spent the entire season with the Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League, 
batting .306 in 118 games with 11 home runs. He finished fifth in the league 
with 91 runs scored, tied for second in the league with 10 triples (tied 
with Trent Oeltjen and Nate Schierholtz behind Tim Raines, Jr.'s 13), and 
led the league with 29 stolen bases.[32] However, the Cubs did not re-sign 
him and he once again filed for free agency following the season.[25] Torres 
signed with the San Francisco Giants on January 9, 2009.[25] After a strong 
spring training, he was named to the Giants' Opening Day roster as a reserve 
outfielder.[33][34] Except for a minor league rehab assignment, he spent 
the entire year in the majors. He was placed on the disabled list on April 
27 with a strained left hamstring.[35] After a rehab assignment, he was 
activated on May 26.[36] On June, 15 he hit the 48th "Splash Hit" home 
run at AT&T Park, against John Lackey in a 9–7 loss to the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim.[37] He was again placed on the disabled list on July 
31 with the same injury he suffered earlier in the year; he was out until 
September 1.[6][38] On September 20, he hit two home runs against Randy 
Wolf in a 6–2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[39] He finished the year 
with a career high .270 batting average and tied for eighth (along with 
Craig Counsell, Gerardo Parra, Everth Cabrera, and Juan Pierre) in the 
National League (NL) with eight triples despite only playing 75 games.[6] 
In 2010, Torres began the season as a backup outfielder again. On April 
25, he replaced Eugenio Vélez (who had been filling in for the injured 
Aaron Rowand) as the Giants' center fielder, playing six games until Rowand's 
return on May 1.[40][41][42] Upon Rowand's return, Torres returned to a 
reserve role until May 9, when he became a starting outfielder for the 
rest of the season after Mark DeRosa hurt his wrist.[41][43] On May 30, 
he had a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning against Carlos Rosa 
to give the Giants a 6–5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[44] By 
midseason, he had replaced Rowand as the Giants' everyday center fielder 
and leadoff hitter.[41][45][46] After the Giants blew a 9–2 lead over the 
Florida Marlins on July 28, Torres had a game-ending single in the 10th 
inning against Clay Hensley to give the Giants a 10–9 win.[47] After the 
Giants blew a 7–3 lead on August 12, Torres had a game-ending RBI single 
against Andrew Cashner in the ninth inning to give the Giants an 8–7 victory 
over the Chicago Cubs.[48] On the morning of September 12, Torres woke 
up with severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis. He underwent 
an appendectomy the same day.[49] He returned to the lineup roughly two 
weeks later, and on October 1 it was announced that he had won the 2010 
Willie Mac Award. Torres said upon receiving the award, "It's the best. 
It's an honor for me from my teammates. I've been blessed and I'm happy 
and just thank God for everything, putting me here and these guys treating 
me like a family."[29] In 139 games (507 at bats), Torres hit .268 with 
84 runs scored, 136 hits, 16 home runs, and 63 RBI.[6] He ranked fourth 
in the NL in doubles (43, behind Jayson Werth's 46 and Matt Holliday's 
and Ryan Braun's 45) and ranked seventh in the NL in triples (eight).[50] 
He finished the year having led the Giants in stolen bases with 26.[51] 
Torres batted .115 in his first seven playoff games before batting .406 
over the last eight. In the first four games of the 2010 World Series against 
the Texas Rangers, he had extra-base hits, tying a Giants' playoff record 
for most consecutive games with an extra-base hit.[6] He had a home run 
off Colby Lewis in Game 3 of the World Series; however, the Giants lost 
that game 4–2.[52] In Game 4, he doubled twice, driving in a run and scoring 
another as the Giants won 4–0.[53] Torres also had two stolen bases but 
was caught thrice in the postseason.[6] He won his first World Series ring 
as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World 
Series since 1954.[54] After injuring his left Achilles tendon on April 
9, Torres spent time on the disabled list from April 15 to May 10.[55][56] 
On May 30, Torres hit his first career grand slam against Kyle McClellan 
in a 7–3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[57] Three days later, he 
scored three runs in a 12–7 victory over St. Louis.[58] On July 15, Torres 
had three hits, scored three runs, drove in two runs, stole a base, and 
slammed into the wall while making a nice catch to rob Kyle Phillips of 
a two-RBI double in a 6–1 victory over the San Diego Padres.[59] He went 
on the disabled list a second time, from August 13 through August 28, with 
a bruised right leg.[60][61] After Torres batted just .228 through the 
beginning of September, he lost quite a bit of playing time to Cody Ross 
and Justin Christian for the remainder of the year.[62][63][64] In 112 
games (348 at bats), Torres hit .221 with 77 hits, 24 doubles, four home 
runs, and 19 RBI. He led the Giants in stolen bases once again, with 19.[6] 
On December 7, 2011, the Giants traded Torres and Ramón Ramírez to the 
New York Mets for Ángel Pagán.[65] The Mets and Torres settled their case 
of arbitration on January 17, 2012, with Torres earning $2.7 million for 
the 2012 season.[66] On Opening Day (April 5) 2012, Torres re-injured his 
left calf—which he had previously hurt during 2012 spring training—and 
spent much of April on the disabled list.[67] He was activated on April 
30.[68] However, though he would receive most of the starts in center field, 
he began to platoon with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, who had filled in for him when 
he was on the disabled list. This continued until July 29, when Nieuwenhuis 
was returned to the minor leagues, enabling Torres to be the full-time 
starter for the rest of the season.[69][70][71] Torres endured a career-worst 
0 for 18 streak that he finally snapped with a hit against Rafael Betancourt 
on August 20 in a 3–1 loss to the Colorado Rockies.[6][72] In 132 games 
(374 at bats), he hit .230 with 86 hits, 17 doubles, seven triples, three 
home runs, 35 RBI, and 13 stolen bases (in 18 attempts). As a right-handed 
hitter, he batted .286. He joined José Reyes as the only players in Mets' 
history to have two games in a season with a triple and home run.[6] Following 
the season, he filed for free agency.[25] On December 13, 2012, Torres 
agreed to a one-year non-conditional contract to return to the San Francisco 
Giants.[73] He began 2013 platooning with Gregor Blanco in left field.[74][75] 
On May 8, he had a game-winning RBI single against Antonio Bastardo in 
the 10th inning of a 4–3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.[76] From 
May 20 through June 30, he batted .298 with 11 doubles and 14 RBI in 35 
games.[74] He had a game-tying RBI double against Rex Brothers on May 25 
in an eventual 10-inning, 6–5 win over Colorado.[77] On July 13, he began 
platooning with Blanco in center field after Jeff Francoeur was called 
up.[74][75][78] His season came to an end on August 1, when he was placed 
on the disabled list with a left Achilles strain, an injury which he acknowledged 
prevented him from hitting for power in 2013. In 103 games (272 at bats), 
Torres hit .250 with 68 hits, two home runs, and 21 RBI while only managing 
four stolen bases. He fared better from the right side at the plate, batting 
.291 as opposed to batting .206 left-handed.[74][79] After the season, 
Torres filed for free agency.[25] On June 11, 2014, Torres signed a minor-league 
deal with the Boston Red Sox.[80] He played five games with the Lowell 
Spinners of the Single-A (short season) New York–Penn League and 18 games 
with the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League. He batted .292 
with Pawtucket.[10] On July 28, 2014, Torres opted out of his contract 
with the Boston Red Sox by exercising an out clause in his contract.[81] 
Torres is married to Soannie Mendoza. The couple has one son, Diego (born 
June 19, 2004).[6] In 2002, Torres was diagnosed with attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, he did not begin taking medication 
to treat it until 2007.[82] His medication has been helpful to him, and 
he is currently a spokesperson for ADHD. In 2012, Plan A Films produced 
a feature-length documentary about Torres titled Gigante, discussing his 
ADHD. The film was directed by Chusy Haney-Jardine.[83] Though a screening 
for the movie was shown at the NYU Langone Medical Center on May 31, 2012,
