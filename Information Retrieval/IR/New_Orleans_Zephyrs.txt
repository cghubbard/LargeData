The New Orleans Baby Cakes (neé Zephyrs) are a minor league baseball team 
based in Metairie, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. The Baby Cakes play 
in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and are the Triple-A affiliate of the 
Miami Marlins.[1] The Baby Cakes play their home games at Zephyr Field. 
The team joined the PCL after the 1997 season when the American Association 
(AA) was disbanded. They were one of five clubs from the AA to join the 
PCL, with three joining the International League. Triple-A baseball was 
also expanded to 30 teams at that time, concurrent with the expansion of 
Major League Baseball. The Baby Cakes franchise history spans 100 years, 
three cities, five leagues, and affiliations with 14 of the present 30 
Major League teams, some on more than one occasion. Both the organization's 
formation and geographic moves were in response to franchise movements 
on the major league level. Prior to 1978, New Orleans was home to another 
minor-league team, the New Orleans Pelicans. In order to bolster its claim 
to Major League status, the American League moved some of its teams from 
mid-sized Midwestern cities to larger Eastern venues for the 1901 season. 
One such shift saw the Kansas City Blues become the Washington Senators. 
With the town suddenly bereft of a ball club, a new team, which would, 
in time, become the Zephyrs, was quickly founded. Playing with the old 
Blues nickname, the team was easily the class of the new, but unrated, 
incarnation of the Western League, winning the pennant by 10 games. With 
a decent team and a solid fan base, the franchise moved on to become a 
founding member of the new American Association, rated at what today would 
be the AAA level. Although only moderately successful on the field, the 
team was a fixture of the Midwest sports scene, playing in Kansas City 
for over half a century. The most notable player for the franchise was 
future Baseball Hall of Fame member Phil Rizzuto, the League MVP and Sporting 
News Minor League Player of the Year in 1940. Another MVP was Don Bollweg 
in 1952. The team, itself, won the championship in 1938, and then back-to-back 
in 1952 and 1953. Winning teams boast higher ticket sales, so when the 
Philadelphia Athletics found themselves unable to compete for market-share 
with the Phillies and decided to relocate after the 1954 season, Kansas 
City, Missouri was an attractive choice. This move, however, forced the 
Blues out, victims of their own success. The franchise set up shop in Denver, 
Colorado in 1955. Although naming a team for its uniform color had been 
popular in the 19th century, it was not fashionable in the 20th. As Denver 
had no connection to the original Blues, and in recognition of the new 
location in the Rockies, the team took on a new nickname, the "Bears." 
(The Bears name has been used for other sports teams in Denver in the past 
several years as well.) The team played at what became known later as Mile 
High Stadium, but was originally known as Bears Stadium, after the team. 
This stadium was one of the largest venues in history to host minor league 
baseball on a routine basis, and had the additional draw of being in one 
of the largest minor league markets at the time. For many years, the biggest 
crowds were on 4th of July fireworks nights, and every year the American 
Association scheduled the Bears for a home game. Crowds of 45,000 and more 
watched the fireworks game, easily the biggest crowds most of the minor 
leaguers had ever played in front of. The Triple-A Bears were affiliated 
with the New York Yankees at the outset, with Ralph Houk managing many 
players who would reach the majors and play in the World Series. The team 
had some early success, winning the AA Championship in 1957. League MVPs 
in this period included Marv Throneberry in 1956 and Steve Boros in 1960. 
Although the team had been a member of the American Association since the 
league's inception 60 years before, it was a Midwestern circuit, and for 
the 1963 season, the Bears transferred to the Pacific Coast League. The 
mid-1960s Bears included such future big-leaguers as César Tovar and Ted 
Uhlaender, but lacked overall success. It also turned out that with the 
PCL otherwise all but confined to the actual Pacific coast, Denver was 
now located too far east; in 1969 the franchise returned to the AA. The 
Denver Bears had some good teams from the 1970s to the mid-1980s, producing 
such players as Andre Dawson, Tim Wallach, Warren Cromartie, Tim Raines, 
Graig Nettles, Terry Francona, Wallace Johnson, Danny Morris, Pat Rooney, 
and Bill Gullickson. Denver players Richie Scheinblum, Cliff Johnson, Roger 
Freed, Frank Ortenzio, and Randy Bass were league MVPs. The managing careers 
of both Billy Martin and Felipe Alou began with the Bears. The team won 
the Association's championship with some regularity, topping the league 
in 1971, 1976, 1977, 1981, and 1983. In 1985, the team name was changed 
to the Denver Zephyrs, after the famous passenger train. Barry Larkin was 
league MVP while with the Zephyrs, as were Greg Vaughn, Jim Olander, and 
Jim Tatum. ESPN broadcaster Orestes Destrade also played for the Zephyrs. 
Under the new nickname, the franchise won the American Association in 1987 
and took the 1991 pennant. They went on to win the 1991 Triple-A Classic 
against the International League's Columbus Clippers, 4–1.[2] The Denver 
Zephyrs lasted eight seasons. Then in 1993, the Major Leagues arrived in 
Denver with the Colorado Rockies expansion team of the National League 
and it was time to find a new home for the Zephyrs. Louisiana lawyer/business 
promoter Robert E. Couhig, Jr. led the effort to relocate the team to New 
Orleans. Oddly, the "Zephyr" name was appropriate for New Orleans, too, 
as the Zephyr Roller Coaster was a popular ride at the Pontchartrain Beach 
amusement park (which had closed in 1983). They remained in the American 
Association until 1998 when they moved to the Pacific Coast League, despite 
the fact they were now over 1,600 miles (2,600 km) away from the Pacific 
coast. The Zephyrs won the 1998 Pacific Coast League championship and went 
on to win the Triple-A World Series against the Buffalo Bisons, 3–1. The 
Zephyrs were also slated to participate in the 2001 championship series 
with the Tacoma Rainiers, but the season was cancelled in the wake of the 
September 11 attacks, and the teams were named co-champions. The Zephyrs 
finished the 2005 season three days before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, 
and though Zephyr Field sustained moderate damage,[3] the team was able 
to open the 2006 season at home, making them the first professional team 
in New Orleans to do so after the hurricane.[4] On May 5–6, 2006 in a game 
that became known as the "Music City Marathon", the Zephyrs played 24 innings 
in Nashville, ultimately defeating the Sounds 5–4 the next day on a Wiki 
González RBI single. The Z's scored once in the eighth and once in the 
ninth, and the teams remained tied through 18 innings before curfew was 
called. The 24 innings matches the longest game in PCL history, set in 
1909, and the Z's set 12 franchise records, including striking out a league-record 
29 times. In 2008, the Zephyrs' season ended three days early due to the 
approach of Hurricane Gustav. When it became apparent that Gustav would 
hit the Gulf Coast on September 1, the Zephyrs cancelled their games of 
August 30 through September 1.[5] On September 22, 2008, the Zephyrs became 
the AAA affiliate of the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins). In October 
2009, the Zephyrs unveiled a new logo, clearly embracing New Orleans with 
the "Fleur de Z" logo. The Zephyrs announced a plan to rebrand for the 
2017 season. A "name the team" contest was held in search of a new team 
name to be accompanied by new logos and a color scheme by Brandiose.[6] 
The seven finalist monikers are Baby Cakes, Crawfish, King Cakes, Night 
Owls, Po’boys, Red Eyes, and Tailgators.[7] On November 15, the team unveiled 
Baby Cakes as the new team name and purple, green, and gold as the new 
team colors, as well as a unique promotion to promote the name: any child 
born in the state of Louisiana during 2017 will get a lifetime pass to 
Baby Cakes games, and will be entered into a raffle wherein the winner 
will receive a full 4-year tuition to any college in the state of Louisiana 
upon their 18th birthday in 2035.[8] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
