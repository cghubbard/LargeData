The 1983 Chicago White Sox season was a season in American baseball. It 
involved the White Sox winning the American League West championship. It 
marked their first postseason appearance since the 1959 World Series. It 
was the city of Chicago's first baseball championship of any kind (division, 
league, or world), since the White Sox themselves reached the World Series 
twenty-four years earlier. After the White Sox went through a winning streak 
around the All-Star break, Texas Rangers manager Doug Rader said the White 
Sox "...weren't playing well. They're winning ugly."[1] This phrase became 
a rallying cry for the team, and they are often referred to as the "Winning 
Ugly" team (and their uniforms as the "Winning Ugly" uniforms). Ron Kittle 
won the American League Rookie of the Year Award and set a club record 
for most home runs by a rookie. He missed the American League home run 
title by 3 home runs and finished third in the league. He would rank in 
ninth place in the American League for runs batted in. Kittle would manage 
to lead the league in strikeouts with 150. LaMarr Hoyt won the American 
League Cy Young Award while fellow pitcher Floyd Bannister finished second 
in the American League in strikeouts. He also won 13 of 14 games after 
the All-Star Break. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]

classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National 
League (NL) was held on July 6, 1983, at Comiskey Park. The game resulted 
in the American League defeating the National League 13-3. The game occurred 
exactly 50 years to the date of the first All-Star game. The game is best 
remembered for Fred Lynn's third inning grand slam off of San Francisco's 
Atlee Hamiker. As of 2012, it is the only grand slam in All-Star Game history.
