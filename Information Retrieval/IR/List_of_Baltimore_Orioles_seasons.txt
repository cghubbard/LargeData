The Baltimore Orioles, formerly the St. Louis Browns, are an American professional 
baseball franchise currently based in Baltimore, Maryland. They were founded 
in 1894 as the Milwaukee Brewers of the Western League and joined the American 
League (AL) in 1901, before relocating to St. Louis the following season 
– a move planned by the league several years before its fruition. The Browns 
generally struggled in their early years as a Major League team, never 
finishing higher than fourth before 1921, and in fact having only eight 
winning seasons before World War II. They lost over 100 games five times, 
and in 1939 set an unenviable MLB record for the highest earned run average 
against a team on record at just over 6.00 per nine innings. They did not 
play in a World Series until 1944 – when most other teams were decimated 
by the war – and had no winning season between 1946 and their seventh season 
in Baltimore as the "Orioles" in 1960. After this, however, the Orioles 
entered their golden age between 1966 and 1983, when they won three World 
Series, played in the postseason eight times, and had eighteen consecutive 
winning seasons between 1968 and 1985. The period from 1986 to 2011, however, 
was another era of failure apart from a short period in the middle 1990s. 
The Orioles played in the postseason only twice over twenty-eight seasons 
and suffered fourteen successive losing seasons between 1998 and 2011, 
before in 2012 surprisingly winning 93 games and their first playoff series 
since 1997. The following table describes the Orioles' MLB win–loss record 
by decade. These statistics are from Baseball-Reference.com's Baltimore 
Orioles History & Encyclopedia,[1] and are current as of October 18, 2016.
