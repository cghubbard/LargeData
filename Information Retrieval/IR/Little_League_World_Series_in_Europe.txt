Europe first participated in the Little League World Series in 1960. Teams 
from Europe were given a berth in the LLWS each year between 1960 and 2001 
(with the exception of the temporary ban of international teams in 1975). 
In 2001, the region was split into a co-terminus Europe (later EMEA) and 
Transatlantic region. The Europe region comprised mostly native European 
teams while the Transatlantic region comprised mostly American expatriates. 
This distinction was eliminated for the 2008 Little League World Series; 
teams made up of either native Europeans or American expatriates are eligible 
to qualify from the European region. Starting with the 2013 LLWS, the region 
was renamed the Europe and Africa Region. African countries were added 
as a result of a major reorganization of the international (non-U.S.) regions. 
This move was triggered by Little League's announcement that Australia 
would receive its own LLWS berth starting in 2013. Two Middle Eastern countries, 
Israel and Turkey, have been part of European regions since they instituted 
Little League programs, as they are members of the European zone of the 
International Baseball Federation; they remained in the renamed Europe 
and Africa Region.[1] No team from the European region has ever reached 
the final of the Little League World Series. The best finishes for a European 
team occurred in 1979, 1993 and 1994, when European teams reached the semifinals. 
Aviano, Italy, made it that far - in the 8 team format - in 1979. Kaiserslautern, 
Germany and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia) made the International final in back-to-back 
years in 1993 and 1994. In 2001, with the LLWS expanding to sixteen teams, 
the European region split into two co-terminous regions. The Europe region 
consisted of teams that were primarily made up of players native to each 
country; no team could have more than three players from the United States, 
Canada, or Japan. The Europe region was named the Europe, Middle East, 
and Africa (EMEA) region between 2004 and 2007; however, no Middle Eastern 
or African team participated in qualifiers for the EMEA Series berth (although 
Kenya sent a team to the European qualifier in 2001[2] and South Africa 
did the same in 2003[3]). In 2008, Little League removed the native players 
rule and split the EMEA and Transatlantic region into the Europe and Middle 
East Africa regions. The following teams represented the European region 
after 2001: The Transatlantic region encompassed the same territory as 
the Europe/EMEA region, but consisted of teams that were made up of at 
least 51% American, Canadian, or Japanese citizens. Below are the champions 
of the Transatlantic region, along with participants for each year. The 
year's winner is indicated in green. From 2008 to 2012, Europe had its 
own region. As noted above, the Europe Region was expanded to include Africa 
in 2013. Results are as of the 2016 Little League World Series. Table includes
