The 2003 Major League Baseball season ended when the Florida Marlins defeated 
the New York Yankees in a six-game 2003 World Series. The Detroit Tigers 
set the American League record for losses in a season, with 119, and the 
Marlins became the first team to win the championship twice as a wild card.
