As player As manager Craig John Counsell (born August 21, 1970) is an American 
former professional baseball player and current manager in Major League 
Baseball (MLB). Counsell was an infielder who played sixteen seasons for 
five teams. Counsell is currently the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers 
of the National League, a position he has held since May 2015. Counsell 
is best known for his playoff performances in 1997 with the Florida Marlins 
and in 2001 with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He has the distinction of having 
been on base for the last two times that the World Series ended with a 
walk-off hit, and was named the NLCS Most Valuable Player in 2001. He is 
also known for his unique batting stance; for much of his career, Counsell 
held his bat over his head, and seemed, during his preparation for hitting, 
to stretch it higher still. Late in his career, Counsell lowered his batting 
position significantly. Counsell was born in South Bend, Indiana. He grew 
up in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, and attended Whitefish Bay High School, 
where he played baseball. His father, John, worked for the Milwaukee Brewers 
of Major League Baseball (MLB) as their director of the speakers bureau 
and director of community relations. Counsell attended college at the University 
of Notre Dame, where he played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball 
team.[1][2] The Colorado Rockies of MLB selected Counsell in the 11th round 
of the 1992 MLB Draft. He made his MLB debut with the Rockies on September 
17, 1995, and appeared in only three games for Colorado that season. The 
Rockies traded Counsell to the Florida Marlins for Mark Hutton in July 
1997. He immediately became the Marlins' regular starting second baseman. 
He scored the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning of Game 7 of 
the 1997 World Series for the Marlins, on an Edgar Rentería single over 
pitcher Charles Nagy's head, after tying that game in the bottom of the 
ninth with a sacrifice fly.[3] In June 1999, the Marlins traded Counsell 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later (minor leaguer 
Ryan Moskau). The Dodgers released Counsell during 2000 spring training, 
and he signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks. His stay with the Diamondbacks 
lasted four years. Counsell batted 8-for-21 in the 2001 National League 
Championship Series (NLCS), and won the NLCS Most Valuable Player Award.[4] 
He was hit by a pitch by Mariano Rivera to load the bases for Luis Gonzalez 
in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, after 
which Gonzalez drove in the winning run for the Diamondbacks, a bloop single 
over the drawn-in infield.[5] After the 2003 season, the Diamondbacks traded 
Counsell to the Milwaukee Brewers, with Chris Capuano, Chad Moeller, Lyle 
Overbay, Jorge de la Rosa and Junior Spivey, for Richie Sexson, Shane Nance 
and a player to be named later (minor leaguer Noochie Varner). With the 
Brewers, Counsell started at shortstop in 2004. After one season with the 
Brewers, Counsell returned to the Diamondbacks as a free agent for two 
more seasons.[6] Counsell returned to the Brewers as a free agent for 2007 
and filled the role of utility infielder. He recorded his 1,000th career 
hit on August 16, 2008 against Derek Lowe of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[7] 
In 2011, he was the fourth-oldest player in the National League, and had 
the second-best career fielding percentage of all active second basemen 
(.991).[8][9] In 2010, he was chosen as the 13th-smartest athlete in sports 
by Sporting News.[10] From June 11 to August 3, 2011, Counsell tied the 
all-time record for consecutive at-bats without a base hit for a position 
player, going hitless over a streak of 45 at-bats as a bench player and 
spot starter. The record was set by notoriously poor hitter Bill Bergen 
in 1909, and later tied by infielder Dave Campbell in 1973. It had been 
reported Bergen's streak was 46 at bats; however, subsequent research definitively 
established that Bergen's streak stopped at 45, meaning that Counsell tied 
but did not break the record.[11] The record was broken only a few weeks 
after Counsell tied it, by Eugenio Vélez of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[12] 
By the SAFE: Spatial Aggregate Fielding Evaluation method of evaluating 
defense, Counsell was both the highest-rated 2nd baseman and the highest-rated 
3rd baseman over the period from 2002 to 2008, with an average runs saved 
of 10.18 and 5.86, respectively.[13] In early 2012, Counsell retired as 
a professional baseball player to take a front office position with the 
Brewers. Counsell served as special assistant to general manager Doug Melvin.[14] 
In 2014, Counsell was named a part-time color analyst for Brewers radio 
broadcasts. He rotated with Darryl Hamilton and Jerry Augustine to call 
games with Joe Block when primary announcer Bob Uecker was absent.[15] 
On May 4, 2015, Counsell was hired by the Brewers to become their manager 
after Ron Roenicke was fired the day before. He signed a three-year contract.[16] 
Counsell and his wife, Michelle, have four children: sons Brady and Jack,
