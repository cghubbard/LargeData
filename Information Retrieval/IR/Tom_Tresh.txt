Thomas Michael Tresh (September 20, 1938 – October 15, 2008)[1] was a Major 
League Baseball infielder and outfielder who played for the New York Yankees 
(1961–69) and Detroit Tigers (1969). Tresh was a switch-hitter and threw 
right-handed. He was the son of catcher Mike Tresh.[2] Born in Detroit, 
Michigan, Tresh graduated from Allen Park High School. He then attended 
Central Michigan University. While Tresh played a majority of his games 
in the outfield, he opened the 1962 season for the Yankees at shortstop, 
filling in for Tony Kubek who was performing military service. Not until 
Derek Jeter in 1996 would another Yankee rookie shortstop start on opening 
day. [3] He also played third base, with most of his games at third occurring 
during the 1966 season. Tresh won both the MLB Rookie of the Year and The 
Sporting News Rookie of the Year awards in 1962, hitting .286, his career-best, 
with 20 home runs and 93 runs batted in in 157 games. When Kubek returned 
during the 1962 season, Tresh was moved to left field. In Game 5 of the 
1962 World Series, he broke a 2–2 tie with a three-run home run in the 
bottom of the 8th inning off Jack Sanford, who won 24 games during the 
regular season, leading to a 5–3 Yankee win and a 3–2 lead in games.[1][2][3] 
After nine years in New York, the Yankees traded Tresh to to the Detroit 
Tigers during the 1969 season for outfielder Ron Woods. He was released 
by Detroit prior to the 1970 season, at age 31.[4] Tresh hit 114 home runs 
from 1962 to 1966, with a career-high 27 in 1966, and he made the American 
League All-Star team in 1962-63. A Gold Glove winner in 1965, he also homered 
from each side of the plate in three games, including a doubleheader in 
that season in which he hit four home runs, three of them in the second 
game. In a nine-season career, Tresh was a .245 hitter with 153 home runs 
and 530 RBI in 1192 games.[2] Following his playing career, Tresh returned 
to his alma mater, Central Michigan University. where he worked as an assistant 
placement director for many years. He helped to invent the Slide-Rite, 
a training tool to teach sliding and diving skills for baseball, softball, 
football and soccer.[5] Tresh died of a heart attack at his Venice, Florida
