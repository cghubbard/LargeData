Adrian "Addie" Joss (April 12, 1880 – April 14, 1911), nicknamed "The Human 
Hairpin,"[1] was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
pitched for the Cleveland Bronchos, later known as the Naps, between 1902 
and 1910. Joss, who was 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and weighed 185 pounds 
(84 kg), pitched the fourth perfect game in baseball history. His 1.89 career 
earned run average (ERA) is the second-lowest in MLB history, behind Ed 
Walsh. Joss was born and raised in Wisconsin, where he attended St. Mary's 
College and the University of Wisconsin. He played baseball at St. Mary's 
and then played in a semipro league where he caught the attention of Connie 
Mack. Joss did not sign with Mack's team, but he attracted further major 
league interest after winning 19 games in 1900 for the Toledo Mud Hens. 
Joss had another strong season for Toledo in 1901. After an offseason contract 
dispute between Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland 
club in April 1902. Joss led the league in shutouts that year. By 1905, 
Joss had completed the first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off 
the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his 
death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that 
saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest 
that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and 
Joss missed most of the year due to injury. In April 1911, Joss became 
ill and he died the same month due to tuberculous meningitis. He finished 
his career with 160 wins, 234 complete games, 45 shutouts and 920 strikeouts. 
Though Joss played only nine seasons and missed significant playing time 
due to various ailments, the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Board of 
Directors passed a special resolution for Joss in 1977 which waived the 
typical ten-year minimum playing career for Hall of Fame eligibility.[2] 
He was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1978. Addie 
Joss was born in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin.[3][4] His parents Jacob 
and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) worked as farmers; his father, a cheesemaker 
who was involved in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland.[5] 
A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when 
Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life as a result 
of his father's death.[6]:p.21 Joss attended elementary school in Juneau 
and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.[7] 
By age 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered 
a scholarship to attend St. Mary's College (also known as Sacred Heart 
College) in Watertown, where he played on the school's baseball team.[6]:p.21 
He also attended the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin-Madison), 
where he studied engineering.[7][8]:p.200 Officials in Watertown were impressed 
with the quality of play of St. Mary's and put the team on a semipro circuit.[6]:p.21 
During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching 
windup, which involved hiding the ball until the very last moment in his 
delivery.[6]:p.21 Connie Mack also sent a scout to watch Joss and later 
offered the young pitcher a job playing on his Albany club in the Western 
League, which Joss declined.[6]:p.22 In 1899, Joss played for a team in 
Oshkosh, earning $10 per week ($285 in today's dollars). After player salaries 
were frozen by team owners, Joss joined the junior team in Manitowoc, which 
had been split into two teams, as a second baseman and was soon promoted 
to the senior squad, where he was developed into a pitcher.[9] He was seen 
by a scout for the Toledo Mud Hens and in 1900 accepted a position with 
the team for $75 per month ($2,137).[6]:p.22 While in Ohio he was considered 
"the best amateur pitcher in the state."[10] He started the Mud Hens' season 
opener on April 28 and earned the win in the team's 16–8 victory.[9] He 
won 19 games for the club in 1900. Midway through the 1901 season, the 
Boston Americans of the upstart American League offered $1,500 ($42,738) 
to Toledo to buy out Joss's contract. The St. Louis Browns of the National 
League (NL) matched Boston's offer; Toledo rejected both offers. Joss continued 
to pitch for the Mud Hens and by the end of the 1901 season he had won 
27 games and had 216 strikeouts (some sources say 25 games).[6]:p.22[11]:p.47 
He became known as "the god of the Western League."[11]:p.47 After the 
season ended, Joss returned to Wisconsin where he led Racine to the 1901 
Wisconsin baseball state championship against Rube Waddell's Kenosha squad. 
He also enrolled at Beloit College and played American football.[11]:p.47 
It was reported that Joss had signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National 
League as early as August 18 and received a $400 advance ($11,397), but 
Joss denied receiving any money.[11]:p.47 Mud Hens owner Charles Stroebel 
stated that he had signed Joss and other Mud Hens players for the 1902 
season on August 12 and that the Western League was under the protection 
of the National League through September 1901. Before 1901 ended, the Cleveland 
Bronchos offered $500 ($14,246) to Toledo in exchange for Joss and manager 
Bob Gilks, who would be a scout for Cleveland. Toledo and Joss agreed and 
Joss was now a member of the American League, which was paying a premium 
on baseball talent to rival the National League.[6]:p.22 Dodgers owner 
Charles Ebbets invited Joss for a meeting, which Joss declined, and Joss 
let it be known that he had told Stroebel he would play for the Mud Hens 
for the 1902 season and received a $150 ($4,109) advance in February 1902. 
In March 1902, Joss signed with Cleveland. Toledo sportswriters took exception 
to Joss, one writing that "he voluntarily signed a contract [with Toledo] 
for this season but when Bill Armour of Cleveland showed him the $500 bill 
he forgot his pledge and sneaked off like a whipped cur."[11]:p.48 Stroebel 
later argued that Joss had returned only $100 of the $150 advance; he not 
returning the entire advance, Joss was charged with a felony and Stroebel 
pursued legal action. Joss made his major league debut with the Bronchos 
on April 26, and two days later he arrived in Toledo to turn himself in, 
accompanied by Bronchos majority owner Charles Somers, who was also American 
League vice president. The court set bond at $500 ($13,698). Stroebel also 
filed a civil suit against the Bronchos, stating that his business had 
been interfered with, but Stroebel agreed to withdraw his charges in July 
when he accepted Bronchos pitcher Jack Lundbom.[11]:p.48 Joss made his 
major league debut with the Cleveland Bronchos (also known as the Bluebirds) 
against the St. Louis Browns. The Browns' Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop 
fly in the direction of right fielder Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob 
Caruthers ruled that Harvey did not make a clean catch, so Burkett was 
credited with a hit.[9][10] (Harvey and witnesses said the ball never hit 
the ground.)[12] Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter. 
Joss compiled a 17–13 record and 2.77 ERA during his major league rookie 
season. He led the American League with five shutouts.[7] On October 11, 
1902, Joss married Lillian Shinivar in Monroe, Michigan. Shinivar was in 
attendance when Joss made his professional debut with the Mud Hens in 1900. 
The couple had a son, Norman, and a daughter, Ruth.[5][6]:p.35 Following 
the conclusion of the 1902 season, Joss was selected to the All-Americans, 
an all-star team from the American League who played exhibition games against 
their counterparts from the National League.[9] To begin the 1903 season, 
the Cleveland organization changed the team's name to the "Naps" in honor 
of shortstop Nap Lajoie. In Joss' second year, he went 18–13 and lowered 
his ERA from the season before to 2.19. His walks plus hits per inning 
pitched (WHIP) was a MLB-low 0.948.[7] For the 1904 season, the 24-year-old 
Joss went 14–10 with a 1.59 ERA and did not give up a home run during the 
season.[7] Illness during the season reduced his starts.[9] He had his 
first of four 20-win seasons in 1905 as he ended the season with a 20–12 
record and 2.01 ERA. He finished with a career-high 132 strikeouts.[7] 
In 1906 his 1.72 ERA was third in the league and he finished with a 21–9 
record and tied a career-high with nine shutouts.[7] To begin the 1907 
season, Joss won his first 10 starts. He threw two one-hitters on the season, 
the first on September 4 against the Detroit Tigers and the second on September 
25 versus the New York Highlanders. When teammate Heinie Berger threw his 
own one-hitter on September 26, it marked just the second time since 1900 
that two pitchers from the same team had thrown back-to-back one-hitters.[9] 
Joss finished the season with career-bests in wins (finished 27–11) and 
338 2⁄3 innings pitched.[7] His win total tied with Doc White for highest 
in the American League and his WHIP was second-best (behind Cy Young) while 
both his complete game (34) and shutout (6) totals were third-best in the 
league.[13] Before the 1908 season started, the Naps' home field, League 
Park, was expanded by about 4,000 seats. The Detroit Tigers, Chicago White 
Sox, and Naps were engaged in a race for the post-season described as "one 
of the closest and most exciting known."[14]:p.56 Three games remained 
in the regular season and the Naps were a half-game behind the Detroit 
Tigers as they headed into a October 2, 1908, match-up against the Chicago 
White Sox, who trailed the Naps by one game.[15] Game attendance was announced 
at 10,598, which was labeled by sportswriter Franklin Lewis as an "excellent 
turnout for a weekday."[14] The Naps faced future Hall of Fame pitcher 
Ed Walsh and recorded four hits; they were struck out by Walsh 15 times. 
The Naps' Joe Birmingham scored the team's only run, which came in the 
third inning. The tension in the ballpark was described by one writer as 
"a mouse working his way along the grandstand floor would have sounded 
like a shovel scraping over concrete."[9] In the ninth inning, Joss retired 
the first two batters then faced pinch hitter John Anderson. Anderson hit 
a line drive that would have resulted in a double had it not gone foul. 
He then hit a ball to Naps third baseman Bill Bradley which Bradley bobbled 
before throwing to first baseman George Stovall. Stovall dug the ball out 
of the ground to preserve the Naps' 1–0 lead. With the win, Joss recorded 
a perfect game, the second in American League history. He accomplished 
the feat with just 74 pitches, the lowest known pitch count ever achieved 
in a perfect game.[16] Fans swarmed the field. After the game, Joss said, 
"I never could have done it without Larry Lajoie's and Stovall's fielding 
and without Birmingham's base running. Walsh was marvelous with his splitter, 
and we needed two lucky strikes to win."[14]:p.57 For the season, Joss 
averaged 0.83 walks per nine innings, becoming one of 29 pitchers in MLB 
history to average less than one walk per nine innings.[17] His season-ending 
WHIP of .806 is the fifth-lowest single-season mark in MLB history.[18] 
The Naps finished with a 90–64 record, a half-game behind Detroit.[19] 
It was the closest Joss ever got to a World Series appearance.[9] After 
amassing four consecutive 20-win seasons, he struggled in 1909 as a result 
of fatigue; by September he was shut down for the season.[9] Joss finished 
the year with a 14–13 record in 242 2⁄3 innings pitched and recorded a 
1.71 ERA.[7] He finished fourth in the American League in ERA and third 
in WHIP (.944).[20] He pitched a second no-hitter on April 20, 1910 against 
the White Sox, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to no-hit the 
same team twice, a feat not matched until Tim Lincecum of the San Francisco 
Giants no-hit the San Diego Padres in both 2013 and 2014.[21] In the second 
inning, the White Sox' Freddy Parent hit a ball toward third base. Bill 
Bradley failed to field the ball cleanly and thus his throw to first base 
was not in time to get Parent out. The initial ruling on the field was 
a base hit but it was later changed to an error. Joss gave up two walks 
and recorded 10 assists.[9] He made just 13 appearances that season due 
to a torn ligament in his right elbow. He made his last appearance of the 
season on July 25, and left the game in the fifth inning due to arm soreness. 
The Naps finished 71–82.[22] In his final major league season, Joss finished 
with a 5–5 record in 107 1⁄3 innings.[23] The Naps finished the year 71–81. 
This marked the fifth time in Joss' nine years that the franchise finished 
with a losing record.[24] Of his 160 major league wins, 45 were shutouts. 
Joss' 1.89 career ERA is ranked second all-time (to Ed Walsh), while his 
0.97 WHIP is the lowest career WHIP in MLB history.[25][26][27]:p.27 He 
finished with a 160–97 record, 234 complete games, and 920 strikeouts. 
Joss's repertoire included a fastball, a "slow ball" (today known as a 
changeup), and an "extremely effective" curve.[28] Baseball historians 
Rob Neyer and Bill James ranked Joss' fastball third (1900–1904) and sixth 
(1905–1909) in the major leagues.[29] George Moriarty explained that Joss 
had only one curveball because "he believed that with a few well mastered 
deliveries he could acquire great control and success with less strain 
on his arm."[30] In an era filled with spitball pitchers, Joss achieved 
his success without ever altering the baseball. Joss threw with a corkscrew 
windup motion, described as "an exaggerated pinwheel motion."[31] Shortstop 
Roger Peckinpaugh described his windup: "He would turn his back toward 
the batter as he wound up, hiding the ball all the while, and then whip 
around and fire it in."[32] Illness and injury accompanied Joss throughout 
much of his professional career. In 1903, a high fever forced him to miss 
the last month of the season.[5] He contracted malaria in April 1904 and 
then missed several starts with a back injury in 1905.[5] Joss was concerned 
about supporting his family after his baseball career ended; many players 
of the day had little education and few marketable job skills beyond their 
abilities on the diamond. As sportswriter Franklin Lewis wrote, "Only a 
handful of players in the rough, stirring, early days of the major leagues 
arrived from campuses. And when they did, sometimes the shock was too great 
for them. Some grizzled holdovers from the 1890s were around and they bore 
down heavily on the eardrums of the so-called college-boy set."[14]:p.55 
Joss was hired as a sports columnist after the 1906 season for the Toledo 
News-Bee.[9][33] He also served as their Sunday sports editor. His writings 
proved so popular that sales of the paper increased and a special phone 
line was installed in his office to field the large volume of calls he 
received from fans. The increased popularity gave him an advantage when 
negotiating with the Naps before the 1907 season, and the club agreed to 
pay him $4,000 ($101,757).[9] (By 1910, player salaries averaged only $2,500.)[34] 
He later also wrote for the Cleveland Press and covered the World Series 
for the News-Bee and Press from 1907–1909.[5] The Press introduced Joss 
in columns this way: "Of all the baseball players in the land, Addie Joss 
is far and away the best qualified for this work. A scholarly man, an entertaining 
writer, an impartial observer of the game."[10] Biographer Scott Longert 
wrote that "the writer was becoming as well-known as the ballplayer."[10] 
An editorial in the Toledo Blade said, "In taking his vocation seriously, 
[Joss] was, in return, taken seriously by the people, who recognized in 
him a man of more than usual intelligence and one who would have adorned 
any profession in which he had elected to engage."[31] During the 1908–1909 
offseasons, Joss worked on designing an electric scoreboard that would 
later be known as the Joss Indicator. The Naps decided to install the scoreboard, 
which allowed spectators to monitor balls and strikes at League Park.[9] 
Joss attended spring training with Cleveland before the start of the 1911 
season. He collapsed on the field from heat prostration on April 3 in an 
exhibition game in Chattanooga, Tennessee.[27]:p.27 He was taken to a local 
hospital and released the next day.[8]:p.200 As early as April 7, press 
reports had taken note of his ill health, but speculated about "ptomaine 
poisoning" or "nervous indigestion."[27]:p.28 The Naps traveled to Toledo 
for exhibition games on April 10 and Joss went to his home on Fulton Street 
where he was seen by his personal physician, Dr. George W. Chapman.[27]:p.28[35]:p.69 
Chapman thought Joss could be suffering from nervous indigestion or food 
poisoning. By April 9, as Joss was coughing more and had a severe headache, 
Chapman changed his diagnosis to pleurisy and reported that Joss would 
not be able to play for one month and would need ten days of rest to recover. 
Joss could not stand on his own and his speech was slurred. On April 13, 
Chapman sought a second opinion from the Naps' team doctor, who performed 
a lumbar puncture and diagnosed Joss with tuberculous meningitis.[b] The 
disease had spread to Joss' brain and he died on April 14, 1911 at age 
31.[5][6] Joss was well-liked by his peers and baseball fans. Upon hearing 
of his death, the Press wrote "every train brings flowers" and "floral 
tributes by the wagonload are hourly arriving at the Joss home from all 
sections of the country."[6]:p.34 His family arranged for the funeral to 
take place on April 17. On that day, the Naps were to face the Detroit 
Tigers in the Tigers' home opener. Naps players signed a petition stating 
that they would not attend the game so they could instead attend the funeral. 
They asked for the game to be rescheduled, but the Tigers balked at the 
request. American League president Ban Johnson initially supported the 
Tigers' position, but he ultimately sided with the Naps. Naps owner Charles 
Somers and 15 Naps players attended the funeral, which was officiated by 
player-turned-evangelist Billy Sunday.[35]:p.72 The first "all-star" game 
was played as a benefit for Joss's family on July 24, 1911.[6]:p.35 The 
Naps invited players from the other seven American League teams to play 
against them. Visiting club players who were involved in the game included 
Home Run Baker, Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, Sam Crawford, Walter Johnson, Tris 
Speaker, Gabby Street, and Smokey Joe Wood. "I'll do anything they want 
for Addie Joss' family", Johnson said.[36]:p.10 Washington Senators manager 
Jimmy McAleer volunteered to manage the all-stars. "The memory of Addie 
Joss is sacred to everyone with whom he ever came in contact. The man never 
wore a uniform who was a greater credit to the sport than he", McAleer 
said.[36]:p.10 The game was attended by approximately 15,270 fans and raised 
nearly $13,000 ($330,711) to help Joss' family members pay remaining medical 
bills.[5][9][35]:p.78 The Naps lost 5–3.[36]:p.11 Boston Globe sports editor 
Jason Nason campaigned for Joss' induction into the Hall of Fame starting 
in the 1950s.[37] Sportswriter Red Smith wrote in 1970 in support of Joss. 
"Could you write a history of baseball without mentioning Joss? Nobody 
ever has. That ought to be the measure of a man's fitness for the Hall 
of Fame, the only measure."[38] However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of 
the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian 
Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required "participation in 
ten championship seasons." Joss had been on the Cleveland roster in 1911 
and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season 
play commenced. Hence it was argued he had "participated" in the 1911 season, 
his tenth.[39] The Hall's Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements 
for Joss.[2][40] Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner's office, worked 
to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977.[37] 
Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978.[6] He is the 
only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted 
fewer than ten years.[10]:p.51 In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig 
included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. 
They described what they called "the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome", where a 
player of truly exceptional talent has a career curtailed by injury or 
illness. They argued that such a player should still be included among 
the greatest all-time players, in spite of career statistics that would 
not quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats. They believed that 
Joss' career ERA was proof enough of his greatness to be included. Baseball 
author John Tierney wrote: "Joss is remembered for a remarkably low career 
ERA, but it should be noted that he pitched in a time before earned runs 
were compiled as an official statistic, and his career ended in 1910, before 
the American League introduced its new baseball in 1911, leading to a nearly 
25 percent increase in runs scored."[41] Joss was inducted into the Cleveland 
Indians Hall of Fame on July 29, 2006.[42] He was inducted in the same 
class as Ray Chapman, Rocky Colavito, Al López, Sam McDowell, Al Rosen
