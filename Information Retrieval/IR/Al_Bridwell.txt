Albert Henry Bridwell (January 4, 1884 â€“ January 23, 1969) was an American 
shortstop in Major League Baseball who played for the a number of teams 
in the early 20th century, most notably the New York Giants, when the team 
was managed by John McGraw. Bridwell hit the (apparent) single which caused 
the crucial "Merkle boner" running error of the 1908 season against the 
Chicago Cubs. The error ended up costing the Giants the pennant (the apparent 
winning run was nullified, the game was thus declared a tie, and the Cubs 
won the makeup of that game). Bridwell never played in a World Series. 
Midway through the 1911 season, he was traded by the Giants, who would 
go on to play in the 1911 World Series, to the Boston Rustlers. He played 
his final two years in the Federal League. In 1,252 career games, Bridwell 
batted .255 with 348 RBIs. He had 1,064 hits, with 95 doubles and 32 triples 
in 4,169 at bats. Bridwell had this to say about the reason why John McGraw 
was a great manager: "He knew how to handle men, some players he rode and 
others he didn't. He got the most out of each man." Bridwell's pugnaciousness 
fit right in with McGraw's style of play. He once punched McGraw in the 
nose, earning a two-game suspension.[1] However, in Lawrence Ritter's book 
The Glory of their Times, Bridwell said he was suspended to two weeks.[2]
