The Albany Great Danes are the intercollegiate athletic programs of the 
University at Albany, SUNY. A member of the Division I America East Conference 
for most of its sports, the school currently fields 18 varsity teams, 8 
men's and 10 women's. Women's Tennis was discontinued after the 2015-16 
season. The University's intercollegiate athletics date back to the late 
1890s, but its development was hampered for several decades by inadequate 
facilities, uncertain financial support, and the relatively small number 
of male students in an institution designed to develop elementary school 
teachers. Tennis remained a constant from 1898 onward along with men's 
basketball from 1909, but attempts to field teams in football (1922), baseball 
(1896–1901), swimming, and hockey were aborted. Expansion into men's and 
women's sports increased after World War II and then expanded greatly in 
the 1960s (men's sports of lacrosse, track & field, cross-country and swimming 
moved from club to varsity status, and women's tennis, softball, field 
hockey, basketball and swimming were introduced), as a direct result of 
the introduction of the new Uptown Campus and its expanded athletic facilities. 
A nickname change also occurred in 1965 when the Pedagogues became the 
Great Danes – making Albany the only American college or university with 
that mascot.[2] The name Great Danes was selected by university student, 
Kathy Earle, who won a $25 savings bond for her selection. Mrs. Earle, 
UAlbany class of '67, selected the Great Danes because of their "Size, 
weight, strength, character, courage, speed, and stamina".[3] All athletics 
are run by the University at Albany Department of Athletics and Recreation. 
After the 1972 NCAA restructuring, the university competed in Division 
III until the 1995–96 school year, when it moved to Division II. The university 
would remain in Division II until 1999. In addition to varsity sports, 
Albany's intercollegiate club sports include Men's Ice Hockey, Men's & 
Women's Rugby, Wrestling and Men's Volleyball. However, these teams are 
not affiliated with the Department of Athletics and Recreation and are 
instead funded by the Student Association. The University at Albany, SUNY 
sponsors teams in eight men's and eleven women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[4]

Program discontinued after the 2016 season As an athletic department, UAlbany 
won the 2004–05, 2012–13 to 2015–16 Stuart P. Haskell, Jr. Commissioner's 
Cup. The Commissioner's Cup annually recognizes the strongest athletic 
program in America East as determined by a scoring system which rewards 
a school for success both during the regular season and at championship 
competition in the conference's 22 sports. The team competes in the NCAA 
Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) as a football-only member 
of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). The 2013 season was the Great 
Danes' first in the CAA, following a 14-year tenure in the Northeast Conference. 
Albany played football as a club sport in the 1920s, but dropped that program 
in 1924. The modern era of Albany football began in 1970, when the school 
restored football as a club sport. The team was upgraded to full varsity 
status in 1973. From the revival of football in 1970 through 2012, the 
team played its home games at the 10,000 seat University Field in Albany, 
New York. Albany opened a new 8,500-seat stadium, Bob Ford Field, for the 
2013 season. The stadium is named after Bob Ford, who was the Great Danes' 
head coach from 1970 through 2013. During the late 1900s one of the most 
well known coaches at the university was football coach Bob Ford. The architect 
of the University at Albany's football program, Ford was Albany's only 
head coach from the reinstatement of the program after a 46-year absence 
until his retirement at the end of the 2013 season. Ford joined the program 
in 1970 when it was a club. After only three seasons at the club level, 
the program was upgraded to varsity status in 1973, and finished with a 
7–2 record. In 1974, the team finished 9–0, the school's only undefeated 
season. Ford put together a record of 256–169 with the Great Danes. Ford 
recorded his 250th career win with a 38–10 victory against Duquesne on 
October 8, 2011. During his time with Albany, Ford led the Great Danes 
to one ECAC North Championships (D-III), one Division III Playoff appearance, 
two East Football Conference Championships and three Northeast Conference 
Championships (two Co-Championship). Ford's knowledge has also created 
a "coaching factory scenario" at the university. More than 100 coaches, 
who have started their careers under Ford, became high school, college, 
and professional coaches. The Great Danes have been successful in football 
since its first season on the Division I-AA level. In the 1999 season the 
Great Danes compiled a 7–2 overall record, finishing 6–1 in-conference, 
which was good for second in the NEC. On April 17, 2012, the university 
broke ground on a new multi-sport complex that would be available for use 
beginning in Fall 2013. Along with a complex that will be the new home 
for football and soccer, a new track will be created on the current football 
field, University Field. The plans to build the stadium were revealed in 
the summer of 2011. The new stadium, which the field will be named Bob 
Ford Field, wouls hold initially 6,000. However, the stadium was to be 
built so future expansion can take place for upwards to 10,000 to 15,000. 
It was announced on August 7, 2012 that beginning in 2013, the football 
program would accept an increase in scholarships and move out of the Northeast 
Conference and into the Colonial Athletic Association. Stony Brook, a former 
Northeast Conference rival, would also be making the move with them. On 
November 17, 2012, the Great Danes played their final NEC Conference game 
and final game at University Field against Central Connecticut State. UAlbany 
defeated the Blue Devils 63–34, finishing 78–24 all-time against NEC opponents 
and 127–65 at University Field. The Great Danes also clinched a share of 
the NEC Championship. However, they did not win the NEC automatic bid do 
to a loss against Wagner (one of only two loses on the 2012 season) and 
finishing in a tie with the Seahawks. On August 13, 2013, Bob Ford, announced 
that after the 2013 season (his 45th year at UAlbany), he would be retiring. 
On November 16, 2013, Bob Ford coached his final home game for the Great 
Danes. The Great Danes would have their worst season under Bob Ford in 
2013. The team would finish 1–11, the only time a Bob Ford team won only 
one game in a season. They would go 0–5 at home and 0–8 overall in their 
first season in the CAA. Despite the down season, there were memorable 
moments. On September 14, the Great Danes played their first game in brand 
new Bob Ford Field. In a 19–14 OT loss to Rhode Island, a sellout of 8,500 
fans came for the home opener. Since tickets were not given for grass seats, 
it is believed near 12,000 showed up, making it one of the highest watched 
UAlbany games in program history. Bob Ford would coach his final home game 
at UAlbany on November 16 against New Hampshire. On November 23, Ford would 
coach his final game at UAlbany, as the Great Danes would lose to Stony 
Brook on Long Island. He would finish with 265 career wins (256 at UAlbany), 
which was ranked 15th all-time in coaching victories at the time. On December 
9, 2013 Greg Gattuso, a former head coach at Duquesne University and assistant 
head coach at both Pittsburgh and Maryland, would be named the new head 
coach at UAlbany. The UAlbany football program grew under Ford's leadership, 
leading to connections between the program and the National Football League. 
Rudy Vido, who graduated in 1974 as a fullback and defensive end, became 
the first player in school history to sign a contract with an NFL team. 
He was cut in the preseason by the New England Patriots, so he never played 
in the NFL. Vido was also signed by several Canadian Football League teams, 
but never played in the CFL either. In 2005, Kurt Campbell became the first 
player in the program's history to be drafted into the NFL. Campbell was 
selected in the seventh round by the Green Bay Packers. In the 2007 NFL 
Draft, Rashad Barksdale became the second player in school history to be 
drafted. He was selected in the sixth round by the Philadelphia Eagles. 
Barksdale was cut however at the end of training camp, but was signed by 
the Kansas City Chiefs, and became the first player in school history placed 
on an NFL 53-man roster. Barksdale made his National Football League debut 
on October 7, 2007 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. It marked the first 
time a UAlbany player had appeared in an NFL regular-season game when he 
took the field on special teams. He also played on the punt cover and punt 
return units and recorded his first career tackle in the fourth-quarter. 
Barksdale was cut by the Chiefs on August 31, 2008. However, he signed 
with the New York Giants as a member of the practice squad for the 2008 
season. On December 30, 2008, Barksdale became the first UA stand-out to 
make an NFL Playoff roster after the Giants signed him to replace corner 
Sam Madison, who went down with an ankle injury. The Great Danes have sent 
multiple players to try-outs and NFL training camps as un-drafted free 
agents. In addition to the NFL, multiple alumni have participated in the 
Canadian Football League and the Arena Football League. Many former coaching 
staff members have also coached in the NFL, including former NFL head coach 
Dave Campo. From 2006 to 2010, Tony and Andy Sparano were key figures on 
the Great Danes roster. At the same time, their father, Tony Sparano, was 
head coach of the Miami Dolphins. The strongest connection to the NFL is 
the university hosting the New York Giants Summer Training Camp. From 1996 
to 2012, the university's practice fields were handed over to the Giants, 
bringing fans and media from around New York and the United States to Albany. 
In 2007, the school dedicated the university's football practice field 
in honor of Wellington Mara and Preston Robert Tisch, the late co-owners 
of the Giants. Mara and Tisch were instrumental in making the University 
at Albany home to the Giants' summer training camp. Richard "Doc" Sauers 
served as Great Danes men's basketball coach from 1955–1997. He led the 
program to eleven NCAA and four NAIA post-season tournament appearances 
in his tenure. Sauers finished his career with a 702–330 record in 41 seasons. 
Sauers achieved the 700-win mark on February 8, 1997 in an 89–71 victory 
over the University of Bridgeport. He would retire one month later and 
be inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 2004. A banner is flown in 
the rafters of the SEFCU Arena honoring Sauers accomplishment of 702 wins. 
The process to become a Division I program was slow. From the 1999–2000 
season, the first year in Division I, to the end of the 2004–05 season, 
UAlbany recorded a 48–118 record. The team finished with over 10 victories 
in only two seasons. However, in the 2005–06 campaign, the Great Danes 
compiled a 21–11 season. In that season, the Great Danes would take on 
both the eventual national champion Florida Gators and UCLA Bruins, both 
of which would play each other for the National Championship. On March 
11, 2006, the men's basketball team won the America East conference tournament, 
earning the school (and the SUNY system) its first ever berth to the NCAA 
Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, defeating the University of Vermont 
80–67 in a sold out RACC. The Great Danes were seeded #16 in the Washington, 
D.C. region and were matched up against top-seeded UConn. Despite the #16 
seed being 0–87 before Albany took the floor, head coach Will Brown believed 
that his team had a chance to beat UConn in the tournament. With that, 
the team took the motto, "Why Not Us?". Fans and alumni wore shirts with 
the motto. On March 17, 2006, the Danes nearly became the first #16 seed 
to defeat a #1 seed in the Division I tournament. The Danes, down only 
1 at the half, went on a 13–0 run early in the second half to take a double-digit 
lead over the Huskies. With the game televised on CBS, the Danes led 50–38 
with just over 11 minutes left in the game. However, a late run by the 
Huskies' stifling defense stopped the Danes' offense, and the Huskies averted 
the upset, winning 72–59. The play against UConn gave the program instant 
notoriety. In the 2006–07 season, the Great Danes faced a much stronger 
America East. The Great Danes would accomplish a 20–9 regular season, but 
be the #2 seed in the conference tournament. This forced the Great Danes 
to travel to Vermont, who was the #1 seed for the conference championship, 
where they were previously 0–7. The Great Danes, considered underdogs, 
would not falter. On March 10, 2007, the men's basketball team won their 
second consecutive America East title, beating Vermont 60–59 in the conference 
final on a last second steal by Carl Ross and Brent Wilson. The Great Danes 
would be seeded 13th in the South Division of the 2007 NCAA Division I 
Tournament, and lost to the 4th seed Virginia Cavaliers 84–57 in the first 
round in Columbus, Ohio. Prior to the conclusion of the 2006–2007 season, 
the men's basketball program retired the number 31 of player Jamar Wilson. 
Wilson finished his career as the school's all-time scorer with 2,164 points, 
plus ranked second in assists with 488. Wilson became the first player 
in school history to score 500 points or more in three different seasons. 
He also shattered the school standard with 620 points in a season, breaking 
a record set by Jason Graber in 1993–94. He would also win two America 
East Player of the Year Awards, something only three other people in conference 
history had achieved. Many believed that his commitment to the university 
was part of the early Division I success of UAlbany's men's basketball 
program. No athlete in the program's history has had their number retired 
prior. In 2012–13, the Great Danes would go 21–10 in the regular season. 
The season was highlighted by games against Top 10 ranked Ohio State and 
a 63–62 victory against the University of Washington in Seattle on November 
13, 2012. Despite 21 wins, UAlbany had lost twice to regular season champions 
Stony Brook, regular season runner-up Vermont and third place Boston University, 
giving many fans limited faith in making a run for a conference title. 
However, the Great Danes would knock off Maine 50–49 and upset Stony Brook 
61–59 in the 2013 Conference Tournament, played at SEFCU Arena. On March 
16, 2013, the Great Danes traveled to Vermont for a chance to win the AE 
Championship. Despite a 10–0 run by Vermont to start the game and being 
out-rebounded 34–20, the Great Danes pulled off the upset 53–49 to win 
the AE Championship and receive the conference automatic qualifier to the 
NCAA Tournament. It was the third straight victory for the Danes in the 
AE Championship game and the third time beating Vermont for the title. 
UAlbany became the first #4 seed to win the conference tournament. They 
would take on Duke University in the 1st Round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division 
I Basketball Tournament as a 15 seed in the Midwest Bracket. On March 22, 
the Great Danes lost to Duke 73–61 in Philadelphia, PA. The 2013–14 season 
had many ups and downs for the Great Danes. The Great Danes played near 
.500 basketball for the entire season. They would finish 15–14 on the regular 
season, 9–7 in conference play, ranked #4 going into the conference tournament. 
With the tournament being hosted on their home court, UAlbany cruised to 
a first round win over UMBC. In the semi-finals, the Great Danes pulled 
off the upset vs. #1 seed Vermont 67–58. The Great Danes were then forced 
to travel to Stony Brook for the Championship Game. On March 15, 2014 the 
Great Danes would defeat Stony Brook 69–60 to win their second straight 
AE Title and fourth title in nine years. On March 18, Albany won its first 
ever NCAA tournament victory, 71–64 over Mount St. Mary's in the First 
Four Round of the tournament. They would go on to lose to Florida in the 
2nd Round. Despite winning back-to-back championships, the Great Danes 
were selected fourth in preseason polls. The Great Danes would open the 
season 2–6, however would finish the regular season 19–2, finishing 15–1 
in America East play. The Great Danes would go in to the America East Tournament 
as the #1 seed. UAlbany would defeat Maine and squeak by New Hampshire. 
They would play Stony Brook at SEFCU Arena in a rematch of the previous 
years championship. Stony Brook was the only conference team to beat the 
Danes during the regular season. On March 14, 2015 in front of a sold out 
SEFCU Arena, the Great Danes would defeat Stony Brook 51–50 to win their 
third straight conference title. The Great Danes would win the game on 
a three-point shot by Peter Hooley with 1.6 seconds to go. "The Shot" gained 
national attention because of Hooley. Hooley, a native of Australia, left 
the team for nearly an entire month to be with his mother who would sadly 
pass from colon cancer. Hooley would state after the game "When you've 
got angels watching, you can do anything." Because of the game winning 
shot, Hooley and the Great Danes received national attention, as Hooley 
appeared on Sports Center and CBS' Road to March Madness Show. On March 
20, 2015, The Great Danes would fall to Oklahoma 69–60 in the second round 
of the 2015 NCAA Basketball Tournament. While not making the NCAA Tournament 
from the 2006–07 season to the 2012–13 season, the Great Danes did participate 
in a postseason tournaments. In 2011–12, UAlbany made the CIT Tournament, 
but lost to Manhattan in the 1st round. In 2016, they participated in the 
CBI Tournament, losing to Ohio in the 1st Round in overtime. In 2009, the 
University at Albany played host to its first America East Men's Basketball 
Championship at the 4,538-seat SEFCU Arena on campus. The America East 
brought the conference tournament back to SEFCU for the 2013 and 2014 Conference 
Championship. UAlbany Women's Basketball had little success on the court 
since it started play in 1964–65. It's greatest success took place in 1985–86 
when it went 26–4 and made it the 3rd Round of the NCAA Division III Tournament. 
Coach Mari Warner would lead the program into Division I play in 1999-00, 
but again success was limited. Through the 2000s under new coach Trina 
Patterson, winning was also limited. However, things began to change in 
2010–11 under former head coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson. That season 
UA finished over .500 for the first time since 1997–98. Abrahamson-Henderson 
led UAlbany to its then-best record in Division I history in the 2011–12, 
going 23–10 overall. The Great Danes brought home their first-ever America 
East Conference title, and represented the league in the NCAA Tournament. 
UAlbany visited defending National Champions Texas A&M, but fell 69–47. 
The Great Danes dominated all conference opposition in the 2012–13 season 
with a 27–4 overall record, winning all games against America East opponents 
including 16 regular season games and all league championship contests. 
UAlbany became the first team to go undefeated in the America East and 
win the conference since the 1995–96 season. Abrahamson-Henderson earned 
America East Coach of the Year honors for her efforts.[5] Ebone Henry was 
named the America East Co-Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the 
Year. They would win their second straight title, but lose to North Carolina 
59–54 in the first round. The 2013–14 Great Danes did not lose a beat, 
earning a three-peat as America East champion, going 28–5 with a 15–1 conference 
record. The team earned the 1-seed in the America East Tournament after 
winning its first 15 league games. It would win its 3rd straight and earned 
a 15-seed in the NCAAs and pushed 2-seed West Virginia to the brink before 
falling 76–61 in the NCAA First Round. In 2014–15 UA went 24–9 overall 
with a 14–2 America East record. UAlbany had a number of program firsts 
that season, including the first win over a Power Five program, defeating 
three-time reigning Big Ten regular season champion Penn State to earn 
a berth into the Preseason WNIT semi-finals, the first DI All-American 
with Shereesha Richards and the program's highest-ever NCAA seeding at 
13, battling Duke to the end and leading in the final minute, falling to 
the Blue Devils 54–52. On March 11, 2016 the Great Danes would win their 
conference record breaking 5th straight title. They would defeat Maine 
59–58, who they shared the co-regular season title with back-to-back years. 
Both teams split their regular season match-up. Two players that would 
have their numbers retired once their time was over at UAlbany was Ebone 
Henry and Julie Foster.[6] In 2012–13 Henry was named the America East 
Co-Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year with 13.8 points, 
5.1 rebounds and 2.8 steals per game.[7] She would also win three straight 
Defensive Player of the Year awards and three First Team All-Conference. 
Shereesha Richards was also critical in the 5 straight titles for UAlbany. 
She would win three America East Player of the Year awards along with a 
Co-Rookie of the Year Award.[8] She would finish as the All-Time scorer 
in UAlbany Basketball history (Men's and Women's program) with 2,440 points 
and became the first DI All-American in Great Danes history.[9] She would 
finish her career with over 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds. The program 
began in 1970 with a 3–7 record competing in Division III. In 1975, the 
program would reach the ECAC Division III Tournament under coach Dave Armstrong. 
From 1975 to 1997, the Great Danes would reach two more ECAC Division III 
Tournaments. In 1997 the Great Danes would reach the finals of the ECAC 
Division II Tournament. In 2000, the Great Danes began play in the America 
East at the Division I level. In 2001, Scott Marr was given the reigns 
of the program. Even though the Great Danes finished with a 3–8 record 
in 2001, the Great Danes compiled an 8–6 regular season to take the regular 
season conference championship in the America East in 2002. They would 
reach the championship game but lose to the Stony Brook Seawolves 8–6. 
Led by a new crop of recruits, some of the first lacrosse players in school 
history to be on scholarship, such as Kevin Rae and Luke Daquino, the Great 
Danes would start making a mark on college lacrosse in 2003. The Great 
Danes would go 8–6 and seek revenge against Stony Brook in the America 
East semi-finals 11–5 to move on to face the University of Hartford for 
the America East Championship. On May 3, 2003, Albany would defeat Hartford 
7–5 to win their first ever America East Championship. They would go on 
to face and lose to Princeton University in the first round on the NCAA 
Tournament. The success for the Great Danes would not stop after 2003. 
With incoming recruits and a strong core of returning players, the Great 
Danes would continue their championship ways. In 2004, including an upset 
against the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Great Danes would 
go on to win another America East Championship. They would play Syracuse 
University in the first round and lose 21–13. The surge would continue 
into 2005 as the Great Danes defeated Stony Brook 16–7 to win their third 
straight America East Championship. However, the first round NCAA Tournament 
jinx would continue as the Great Danes were demolished by the University 
of Virginia 23–9. In the 2007 season, the lacrosse team would be ranked 
in the top-25 in both USILA and Nike/Inside Lacrosse polls and reached 
a high of #2 in the USILA poll. Notable wins were against #1 ranked Johns 
Hopkins Blue Jays and #10 Delaware. On May 13, 2007, the men's lacrosse 
team became the first team at the Division I level to advance/win a match 
in the NCAA Tournament, defeating Loyola College in Maryland 19–10 in front 
of nearly 3,000 people at John Fallon Field. One week later, the Great 
Danes were defeated by undefeated Cornell University 12–11 in the NCAA 
Quarterfinals at Princeton University. The team finished ranked #4 in the 
Nike/Inside Lacrosse poll, the highest ranking for any team in school history. 
Head Coach Scott Marr was awarded the USILA Division I National Lacrosse 
Coach of the Year to cap the amazing season. One of the big stars for the 
lacrosse team in 2007 was senior attackman Frank Resetarits. He would become 
the first Great Dane in school history to earn first-team All-American 
honors as he was selected to the 2007 USILA All-America Team. Resetarits 
was also named a finalist for the Tewaaraton Trophy. Resetarits would also 
become the first lacrosse player in school history to be drafted into the 
Major League Lacrosse, selected by the Washington Bayhawks, but being traded 
and making his debut with the Long Island Lizards. Resetarits would also 
join the National Lacrosse League, drafted #5 overall by the San Jose Stealth 
in 2007 NLL Draft. In 2013 the Great Danes would go 11–4 overall. UAlbany 
would go 5–0 in regular season America East play for the second time in 
program history. Amazingly, the Great Danes would go 9–2 on the road while 
only 3–2 at home. On May 4, after a five years without a title, the Great 
Danes would defeat UMBC 19–10 to win the America East Championship. However, 
the Great Danes would fall to Denver in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. 
Head Coach Scott Marr would record his 100th career win at UAlbany during 
the season. Much of the Great Danes success in 2013 was centered around 
one family. Miles Thompson, Ty Thompson and Lyle Thompson (also known as 
the Thompson Trio), were a vital part of the Great Danes offense. Miles 
and Lyle are brothers, while Ty is their cousin (another brother, Jeremy 
Thompson played for Syracuse until 2011). All three were star recruits 
coming to UAlbany. The three were born in the Onondaga Nation, a nine-square-mile 
independent political entity recognized by the United States. Each of the 
Thompson's wore a traditional native hair style, with long braids that 
became their trademark on the field. The three also became known for their 
skills on the field, which involved trick passes and stick handling, behind 
the back shots, one handed shots and their quick agility. In 2013, Ty Thompson 
would score 51 goals, Miles would score 42 and Lyle 46 goals going into 
the NCAA Tournament. The fourth leading scorers for the Great Danes, Will 
Fuller and John Maloney, had only 18 goals. Lyle Thompson would be the 
key factor for the Great Danes. The sophomore was vital in leading the 
No. 1 offense in the nation with 108 points through 17 games. Lyle became 
the eighth men's lacrosse player in NCAA history to record 100 points in 
a season. He finished seven points behind all-time NCAA record holder Steve 
Marahol's (UMBC) 114 points (37g, 77a) set in 1992. He would win the America 
East Player of the Year Award and became the second Great Dane to be named 
a Tewaaraton Award finalist, and the first Native American to be named 
a Tewaaraton Award finalist. In 2014, the Thompson's would continue their 
unbelievable play. Despite a shaky 9–5 regular season, the Great Danes 
would be the #1 overall seed in the America East Tournament. Lyle would 
become only the third player in conference history to win back-to-back 
Player of the Year Awards. Earning at least four points in all 14 games 
played, the junior attack has earned a Division I-best 61 assists and 37 
goals in the regular season. In the American East Tournament, Lyle became 
the first Division I player ever to earn two 100-point seasons. On May 
3, 2014, the Great Danes would win their second straight America East Championship, 
defeating UMBC 20–11. On May 10, 2014 the Great Danes would take on Loyola 
in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Loyola was the number one ranked 
team in the nation going into the game. The Great Danes, with strong defensive 
play, defeated the Greyhounds 13–6 for the second NCAA Tournament victory 
in school history. In the game Lyle would become the DI single season record 
holder in points, beating out Marahol's record he just missed in the previous 
season. In the game Miles would also pass Marahol's numbers to become second 
on that list after scoring five goals and two assists. The Great Danes 
would end up losing 14–13 in overtime to Notre Dame in the Quarterfinals 
the following week. As a junior Lyle would compile the top single season 
point total in DI history, earning 128 points as well as tying the DI single 
season assists record with 77, adding 51 goals. He became the first player 
in DI history to have a pair of 100+ point seasons after finishing with 
113 last year. In UAlbany's 18 games in 2014 he scored at least four points, 
including 11 seven+ point contests. He was named Division I Outstanding 
Player of the Year and the DI Outstanding Attackman by the United States 
Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) in 2014. On May 29, 2014, 
both Miles and Lyle Thompson were named the co-winners of the 2014 Tewaaraton 
Trophy. It was the first time ever that two players shared, and a Native 
American was awarded, the trophy. Two days later, Miles and Ty were officially 
put on the active roster of the MLL Rochester Rattlers. It was also announced 
that Miles would return to the program in 2015 as a Graduate Assistant. 
The success of the Thompson Trio on the field led to a national press following 
in late 2014. CNN, CBS and ABC all did nightly news pieces on the three. 
The NY Times also did a story on them, which was posted on the front page 
of the newspaper. In all the pieces the three talked about their heritage, 
the acceptance of their heritage at UAlbany, supporting the Onondaga Nation 
and promoting the game of lacrosse. In 2015, Lyle Thompson cemented himself 
as one of the greatest collegiate lacrosse players in NCAA history. He 
was named the recipient of the 2015 Tewaaraton Trophy for the top player 
in men's lacrosse and was the first ever male lacrosse player to earn the 
award in two consecutive seasons. In 2015, Thompson led the NCAA in points 
per game for the third-straight year with 6.37 a contest and assists per 
game at 3.63 a contest. He finished with an NCAA Division I best 121 points, 
the second-highest single season tally in DI history, and 69 assists, adding 
52 goals. He would lead UAlbany to a third-consecutive America East regular 
season and tournament title. The Great Danes would take on Cornell in the 
first round of the NCAA Tournament, winning 19–10. In a rematch of the 
2014 quarterfinals, UAlbany would fall to Notre Dame 14–10. Thompson finished 
his career as the all-time Division I points and assists leader, concluding 
with 400 points off 175 goals and 225 assists from 2012–15 with UAlbany. 
In his career he played in 70 games, scoring in 68 of them and earned multiple 
points in each of his last 44 games, including all contests in 2014 and 
2015. UAlbany's biggest local rival is Siena College located in Loudonville, 
NY. Both schools are separated by 8 miles (13 km). While teams do not participate 
in the same conference, teams from multiple sports will face each other 
annually, with the strongest part of the rivalry lying with men's basketball. 
Both teams met for the 50th time in 2010. The first match-up was February 
23, 1957 in which Siena defeated Albany 75–66 at Albany. After nearly twenty 
years, the series ended on February 3, 1977 with a 62–49 Albany victory. 
All games since 2001 have taken place in the Times Union Center, officially 
making it a home game for Siena. Since 2001, the game has averaged an attendance 
over 10,000 for the annual match-up. In 2015, under a new contract, it 
was announced that the rivalry would be moved to SEFCU Arena during the 
2016–2017 season and would be part of "tournament" during the 2017–18 season. 
While the women's basketball match-up receives less fan fare then the men's 
game, it is part of the Albany Cup battle. Their first match-up was in 
the 1975–76 season. While both the men's and women's basketball games battle 
for the Albany Cup, the rivalry has been dubbed the "Crosstown Showdown" 
by sportscasters in the Capital Region. Albany–Stony Brook football rivalry 
Stony Brook University is UAlbany's biggest SUNY rival and has had intense 
competition in sports like men's basketball and lacrosse is recent years. 
From 2000–2015 in men's lacrosse, Stony Brook has met UAlbany in the America 
East Tournament 12 times. Four of these meetings were in the America East 
Championship game (2002, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2015), with Stony Brook winning 
3 times. In men's basketball, it has been a similar situation. While Albany 
has had more historical success overall in the NCAA's since 2000, they 
had lost to Stony Brook in three straight America East Tournament games 
(2010, 2011, 2012). In 2012, the Great Danes, as the #4 seed in the tournament, 
knocked off the Seawolves, the #1 seed, in the quarterfinals to end the 
streak. In 2014 and 2015 both teams would meet in back-to-back championship 
games, 2014 in Stony Brook and 2015 in Albany, with Albany winning both 
games in the last minute. Baseball has also seen some good moments. UAlbany 
eliminated Stony Brook in the 2011 AE Tournament, even though Stony Brook 
swept them in four straight games of the regular season. In 2010, Stony 
Brook defeated UAlbany in the America East Championship. In 2012, Stony 
Brook defeated the Great Danes in three out of four regular season match-ups 
in their memorable run to the College World Series. However, the biggest 
part of the rivalry is played out on the gridiron. From 1999–2006, the 
two programs were both associate members of the Northeast Conference. During 
that time, UAlbany went 5–3 against the Seawolves. Stony Brook would leave 
the NEC in 2007 to become independent and joined the Big South Conference 
in 2008. The two teams would meet in 2006 in a non-league game at University 
Field, in which the Great Danes defeated Stony Brook 24–23. The two teams 
would not meet again until November 26, 2011. However, this meeting would 
be different. The two teams each won their respected conference titles 
and were meeting in the First Round of the FCS Playoffs. For both programs, 
it was their first time being in the FCS Playoffs since joining Division 
I athletics. The match-up also had the story line that Stony Brook head 
coach Chuck Priore was a 1982 UAlbany graduate who started three seasons 
at fullback, then served for three years as UAlbany's running backs and 
strength coach for head coach Bob Ford. UAlbany would have a 28–10 third 
quarter lead, but the Seawolves answered with 21 points to take the lead. 
However, UAlbany would have a chance to win the game at the goal-line with 
under a minute to play. On second-and-goal from the Stony Brook 3-yard 
line, Dan Di Lella had a pass intercepted in the end zone by free safety 
Dominick Reyes with 47.4 seconds left as the Seawolves held on for a 31–28 
victory before 8,286 fans at La Valle Stadium and advance to the Second 
Round. The rivalry was rejuvenated in August 2012, when it was announced 
the Great Danes and Stony Brook would become associate football members 
in the Colonial Athletic Association starting in 2013. The teams met for 
the first time as CAA rivals on November 23, 2013 on Long Island. A notable 
rivalry exists between the Great Danes and the Binghamton University Bearcats. 
Both teams joined the America East conference around the same time, when 
they were relatively new to Division I sports. Their SUNY connection as 
well as geographic proximity has fostered the rivalry and generated the 
name, "The I-88 Rivalry (Interstate 88)." Both teams post the largest away 
crowds at either school's athletic events. The athletic rivalry between 
Albany and the University of Vermont is mainly focused on basketball. The 
rivalry has been based around the success the two programs had from 2003–2007, 
in which the two teams combined for five America East Titles. In that time 
frame, UAlbany and UVM met twice in the America East Tournament finals 
with the Great Danes winning both games. The first win came in 2006 at 
home and the second came in 2007 at Vermont (Albany's first-ever win at 
Vermont). In 2013, the teams would meet again in the America East Championship 
in Burlington. For the third time, the Great Danes would defeat the Catamounts. 
The Department of Athletics annually hosts two major sporting events. The 
first event is the Homecoming Football Game. The University's first Homecoming 
Weekend was held October 31, 1953 and it featured a soccer game, punch 
party, and a dance. This first Homecoming appears to have been organized 
by the Senior Class, reuniting the Classes of 1951, 1952, and 1953. Every 
fall since then, the UAlbany campus becomes a hub of activity during Homecoming/Family 
Weekend. One highlight of the Weekend is checking out Great Dane Athletics. 
The highest level of tail-gaiting takes place during this weekend while 
the University hosts the Homecoming Touchdown Tailgate. During Homecoming 
Weekend, the Athletic Department also enshrines players, coaches and administration 
from the past into the UAlbany Athletic Hall of Fame. The most recent inductees 
can be found at the UAlbany Athletic Website.[10] The Big Purple Growl 
is the annual winter homecoming. The Ferocious Feast kicks off the festivities 
with lots of great food and fun. The Growl usually features a doubleheader 
with both the women's and men's basketball teams playing home at the SEFCU 
Arena. Beginning in 1997, this annual event is an exciting fun-filled, 
spirited day for all members of the University community. The University 
also hosts an annual Cross Country Meet (UAlbany Invitational), Track and 
Field (UAlbany Classic) and other events. UAlbany Football and Men's Basketball 
games starting airing on ESPN Radio WTMM-FM FM 104.5 as of the 2016-17 
school year after broadcasting for years on Fox Sports Radio WOFX AM 980 
in Albany, NY. Roger Wyland has been the voice of the Great Danes since 
1994. Select athletic events also air on Time Warner Cable SportsChannel. 
TWCSN has broadcast rights to select football, America East Conference 
Network (usually involving UAlbany teams) and men's and women's basketball 
games. The station has also aired select Lacrosse and Women's Volleyball 
games. WCDB has done select athletic events in past years. The station 
was at one point the exclusive home of UAlbany Women's Basketball, Men's 
Lacrosse and Women's Volleyball, doing select games every year. They continue 
to do select sporting events during the year. In 2007, the university began 
streaming live video coverage of selected events on the University Athletic 
Website. The America East Website[11] also live streams selected events. 
"Purple and Gold," the UAlbany fight song, was unveiled in the spring of 
2000. The song was written by UAlbany students John Regan and Jonathan 
Hansen in conjunction with the university's move to Division I that academic
