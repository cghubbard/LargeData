This article contains a list of all Major League Baseball managers with 
at least 1,000 career regular-season wins, as well as a list of managers 
who have regular season win percentages greater than .540. Both lists are 
current through the close of the 2016 regular season. Connie Mack, who 
managed the Philadelphia Athletics for 50 years, is the all-time leader 
in both wins and losses. Due to their length of service, seven of the top 
ten managers (in wins) also appear in the top ten in losses. Bruce Bochy 
is the active wins leader with 1,789 managed wins. The active manager closest 
to surpassing 1,000 wins is Joe Maddon, who has 981 wins and 852 losses. 
The only manager with 1,000 losses but not 1,000 wins is Phil Garner, who 
has a 985-1,054 record (.483). Managers included have managed at least 
500 games, a group including 241 managers. Note that the total number of 
games listed for each manager in this table includes tie games though ties 
are not included in "decided game" statistics. Of the active managers with 
less than 500 managed games, two managers have a winning percentage high 
enough for this list: Jeff Banister with a .565 record (183-141) in 324 
games and Dave Roberts with a .558 record (91-72) in 163 games. The closest 
active manager to the end of this list is Joe Maddon with a .535 record
