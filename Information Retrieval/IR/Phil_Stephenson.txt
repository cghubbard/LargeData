in Division I history, 47 straight games in 1981. His record was broken 
by Oklahoma State's Robin Ventura, with 58 hits in 1987. He was also the 
victim of one of the most famous plays in College World Series history 
- The Grand Illusion play by Miami in 1982.[1] Stephenson was originally 
drafted in the 3rd round of the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft by the 
Oakland Athletics. He was traded to the Chicago Cubs before the 1986 season, 
and made his major league debut with them in 1989. That September, he was 
traded to the San Diego Padres, and finished his major league career with 
them in 1992. He played two more seasons of minor league baseball in the 
Kansas City Royals and St. Louis Cardinals organizations before retiring. 
Stephenson managed in the minor leagues for two seasons in the mid-1990s, 
winning a league championship with the independent Abilene Prairie Dogs
