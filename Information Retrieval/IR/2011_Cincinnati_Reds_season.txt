The 2011 Cincinnati Reds season was the 122nd season for the franchise 
in Major League Baseball. The team attempted to return to the postseason 
for the second consecutive year following their NL Central division championship 
in 2010. Dusty Baker returned for his fourth year managing the Reds and 
his eighteenth season managed overall. The Reds off-season began with fans 
calling for a full-time power-hitting left-handed left fielder; a leadoff 
hitter; and a strong offensive shortstop as many were unhappy with the 
weak bat of Paul Janish. The Reds exercised the options of Jonny Gomes, 
while declining the options of Aaron Harang and Orlando Cabrera. They also 
exercised the option on Bronson Arroyo, but later signed him to a 3-year, 
$35 Million extension through 2013. They also extended 23-year-old right-fielder 
Jay Bruce for 6 yrs./ $51M. They resigned catcher Ramón Hernández, who 
will again team up with Ryan Hanigan in what was the 2nd best offensive 
catching duo in the NL of 2010, while giving highly touted prospect Devin 
Mesoraco more time to develop in the minors. They also resigned another 
veteran in backup corner infielder Miguel Cairo. Jocketty brought in two 
young outfielders on minor league deals, Brian Barton and Jeremy Hermida. 
Hermida was invited to spring training. The Reds also signed former phenom 
pitcher and 2003 Rookie of the Year Dontrelle Willis to a minor league 
deal, also giving him a spring training invite. Then on January 7, the 
Reds made their biggest acquisition of the off-season, signing the current 
World Series MVP, veteran shortstop Édgar Rentería. GM Walt Jocketty has 
stated that Rentería will be in a backup role to Janish. On January 10, 
the Reds signed left fielder Fred Lewis for $900 K. He is expected to, 
at the very least, platoon with Gomes in left field. On January 16, it 
was announced that the Reds and Joey Votto agreed to a 3-year, $38 million 
deal.[1] The Reds opened the 2011 season with a walk-off home run against 
division rival Milwaukee to win on opening day 7–6 which eventually propelled 
them to a 5–0 start to the season, their best start since 1990 (the year 
which they last won the World Series).[2] Throughout the months of April 
and May the Reds were either near the lead or the leader of the NL Central 
division. May also saw a three-game series sweep of the rival St. Louis 
Cardinals, the Reds first sweep of the Cardinals since 2007. In June, the 
Reds continued to stay in the division race finishing the month with a 
42–40 record. July started off poorly for the Reds who currently sit in 
fourth place in the division where they stayed through the week following 
the All-Star break. They would eventually finish the season in 3rd place 
with a 79-83 record Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
