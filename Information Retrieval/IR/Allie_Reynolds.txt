Allie Pierce Reynolds (February 10, 1917 – December 26, 1994) was an American 
Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. Reynolds pitched 13-years for the 
Cleveland Indians (1942–46) and New York Yankees (1947–54). A member of 
the Creek nation, Reynolds was nicknamed "Superchief". Reynolds attended 
Capitol Hill High School and the Oklahoma Agricultural & Mechanical College 
(A&M), where he was a multi-sport athlete. Henry Iba, baseball coach of 
the Oklahoma A&M baseball team, discovered Reynolds while he was practicing 
his javelin throws. After excelling at baseball and American football at 
Oklahoma A&M, Reynolds turned to professional baseball. During his MLB 
career, Reynolds had a 182–107 win–loss record, 3.30 earned run average, 
and 1,423 strikeouts. He was an All-Star and World Series champion for 
six seasons. In 1951, he won the Hickok Belt as the top American professional 
athlete of the year. He also has received consideration for induction into 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame, though he has not been elected. Reynolds 
was born on February 10, 1917, in Bethany, Oklahoma.[1] His father was 
a preacher in the Church of the Nazarene.[1] His mother was a member of 
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.[2] As a young child, he didn't play baseball, 
as his father did not approve of playing sports on Sundays.[1] Reynolds 
threatened to run away from home if his father wouldn't let him play football; 
his father relented.[1] Reynolds attended Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma 
City, where he starred in American football as a quarterback and running 
back, and at track and field, where he excelled at the javelin throw and 
100 yard dash.[3] He played fast-pitch softball for his father's church 
team, which did not play on Sundays.[3] There, he also began dating Dale 
Earleane Jones, who was named Capitol Hill High School's most outstanding 
female athlete; she had previously dated Reynolds' younger brother. The 
couple married on July 7, 1935.[3] Oklahoma Agricultural & Mechanical College 
(A&M) provided Reynolds a scholarship to attend and participate in track.[2] 
Reynolds also played on the football team. He majored in education and 
graduated with a lifetime certification to teach public school in Oklahoma.[3] 
Henry Iba, coach of the baseball team, first noticed Reynolds when he was 
practicing his javelin throws.[4] Iba asked Reynolds to throw batting practice 
while his pitchers recovered from sore arms.[5] Without taking any warmup 
pitches, he struck out the first four batters without any making contact.[1][6] 
Reynolds was the team's captain playing as an outfielder–pitcher during 
his senior year in 1938, and led the team to victory in the state conference 
baseball championship.[7][7] Reynolds was drafted by the New York Giants 
of the National Football League as a halfback .[7] Since Reynolds preferred 
baseball to football, and felt he could earn more money playing baseball, 
Reynolds opted not to sign.[7] Iba was friends with a scout, Hugh Alexander, 
who worked for the Cleveland Indians. After Iba recommended Reynolds, the 
Indians signed Reynolds as an amateur free agent for a $1,000 signing bonus 
($17,041 in current dollar terms).[8] He was assigned to the Springfield 
Indians of the Class-C Middle Atlantic League. In 1940, he pitched for 
the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Class-B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League. Reynolds 
played right field for the Raiders when he wasn't pitching, as roster sizes 
were reduced to seventeen as a result of the Great Depression.[8] The Indians 
wanted to convert Reynolds to catcher due to his athleticism, but Reynolds 
refused to change positions.[8] Reynolds started the 1941 season with the 
Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Class-A Eastern League, but was demoted to Cedar 
Rapids after three appearances.[9] Becoming increasingly homesick and not 
wanting to spend his entire professional career in the minor leagues, Reynolds 
considered retiring after the 1942 season if he wasn't promoted to Major 
League Baseball (MLB).[10] In 1942, Reynolds went 18–7 with a 1.56 earned 
run average (ERA), eleven shutouts, twenty-one complete games, and 193 
strikeouts in 231 innings pitched,[10] earning a promotion to the major 
leagues to finish the 1942 season.[11] Reynolds appeared in his first MLB 
game on September 17, 1942, making two relief appearances for the Indians 
that season. With ace Bob Feller serving in the military during World War 
II, the Indians hoped that Reynolds would star for the Indians. Reynolds 
took a pre-enlistment physical,[12] but due to his family and football 
injuries, he did not enlist in the military and wasn't eligible to be drafted.[13] 
He began the 1943 season in the Indians' bullpen, making his first start 
on June 20.[11] Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau used Reynolds as a 
reliever in between starts due to his resiliency.[11] Reynolds led the 
American League (AL) in strikeouts in 1943 with 151 and hits allowed per 
nine innings pitched with 6.34; however, he was third in walks allowed 
with 109.[14] Reynolds led the AL in walks with 130 in 1945.[15] During 
his five years with the Indians he was primarily used as a starting pitcher, 
although he did display the versatility that would become his hallmark. 
He pitched in 139 games for the Indians, starting 100 and finishing 27. 
Early evidence of his versatility is demonstrated by his 41 complete games, 
9 shutouts and 8 saves.[16] On October 11, 1946, Reynolds was traded to 
the New York Yankees for second baseman Joe Gordon.[17] A possible trade 
was speculated throughout the 1946 season. The Yankees had a wealth of 
infield talent, but needed pitching help. The Indians were managed by player-manager 
Lou Boudreau who played shortstop, but they needed help at second base.[18] 
Cleveland wanted Gordon and offered the Yankees any pitcher on their staff, 
with the exception of Bob Feller. Yankee executive Larry MacPhail discussed 
the potential trade with Yankees star Joe DiMaggio. Though MacPhail initially 
wanted Red Embree, DiMaggio replied: "Take Reynolds. I'm a fastball hitter, 
but he can buzz his hard one by me any time he has a mind to."[2][19] He 
promptly became the Yankees' best pitcher, recording the highest winning 
percentage in the AL in his first season as a Yankee. In 1949, joined by 
Vic Raschi and Eddie Lopat, he was a star of a Yankee team that won the 
first of five consecutive league championships, a feat that had never been 
achieved before.[2] He played many important roles for those teams. In 
his first six years with the Yankees he averaged over 232 innings, 17.5 
wins, and 14 complete games. As a swingman, he averaged 26 games started 
and 9 games finished per season.[16] "Reynolds was two ways great, which 
is starting and relieving, which no one can do like him. ... He has guts 
and his courage is simply tremendous." In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, 
even though he pitched with bone chips in his elbow for the entire season. 
His remarkable 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating 
chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring 
training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him at 
least half of the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University 
recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared in his first game one week 
after the season started.[20] On July 12 and September 28, 1951, Reynolds 
threw no-hitters. He was the first American League pitcher to throw two 
no-hitters in a season and only the second player to do so in baseball 
history, after Johnny Vander Meer threw consecutive no-hitters in 1938.[21][22] 
This is still the MLB record for most no-hitters in a single season, a 
record that Reynolds and Vander Meer share with Virgil Trucks (1952), Nolan 
Ryan (1973), Roy Halladay (2010), and Max Scherzer (2015).[22] His first 
no-hitter, on July 12, 1951, was a 1–0 defeat of his former team, the Indians. 
Gene Woodling's solo home run was the only run scored during the game. 
Reynolds retired the last 17 Indians he faced. Only four Indians reached 
base; he walked three and Bobby Ávila reached on an error by Phil Rizzuto. 
It was his third shutout of Cleveland that season. Bob Feller also threw 
a strong game and didn't allow a hit until the sixth inning, when Mickey 
Mantle doubled. Feller threw a complete game and allowed only four hits. 
Feller had thrown a no-hitter eleven days earlier.[23] His second no-hitter, 
on September 28, 1951, was an 8–0 defeat of the Boston Red Sox which allowed 
the Yankees to clinch at least a tie of the American League pennant. The 
Yankees clinched the pennant in the second half of the September 28 double-header. 
Reynolds struck out nine hitters. He walked four, but "not one Boston batter 
seemed close to getting a hit." With two outs in the ninth inning, Ted 
Williams hit a pop fly to Yankees catcher Yogi Berra. Berra dropped the 
ball and prolonged the at bat against the dangerous Williams. Reynolds 
remained calm, telling Berra, "Don't worry Yogi, we'll get him again." 
Reynolds was correct and Williams once again popped up, but Berra caught 
this one.[24] In the spring of 1953, Stengel made Reynolds predominantly 
a reliever, although he notched 15 starts and 5 complete gamest, because 
of Reynolds' ability to pitch without much rest and to use his blazing 
fastball late in the Yankees' afternoon games when the shadows crept over 
the mound.[25] However, Reynolds injured his back in July when the team 
bus was on the way to the train station after a game in Philadelphia—robbing 
Reynolds of his control. During the '53 World Series—his final one—Reynolds 
started the opener at home and struggled because of his back injury, but 
recovered to appear in two more as a reliever—winning the sixth and final 
game of the Series.[26] Reynolds led the AL in shutouts in 1951 with seven.[27] 
In 1952, he had his greatest single season performance. He won twenty games 
for the only time in his career (against eight losses). He led the American 
League in earned run average (2.06), strikeouts (160), and shutouts (6).[28] 
He also saved six games.[29] He also played in the MLB All-Star Games of 
1949, 50, 52, 53, and 54 (no official ALL-Star selection or game was held 
in 1945). With the Yankees, Reynolds reached the World Series in 1947, 
49, 50, 51, 52, and 53. Reynolds had a 7–2 record with a 2.79 ERA over 
77 innings in the World Series. He made six relief appearances in the World 
Series, recording a win or save in each of them, including the clinching 
games of the 1950, 1952 and 1953 series.[2] He also batted .308 in 26 at-bats 
in his World Series appearances.[30] Reynolds won the Hickok Belt as the 
top professional athlete of the year in 1951. He also was voted the Player 
Of Year in 1951 by the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America,[20] and finished third in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player 
Award, behind Berra and Ned Garver of the St. Louis Browns.[31] In 1952, 
he was the MVP runner-up to Bobby Shantz of the Philadelphia Athletics.[32] 
Reynolds suffered a back injury when the Yankees' charter bus crashed into 
an overpass in Philadelphia during the 1953 season. He retired after the 
following season as a result of the injury.[2] David Dupree explained a 
common view of how he was given the nickname, Superchief, "he was part 
Creek Indian and always in command on the pitching mound."[5] At this time 
it was very common for baseball players with Native American heritage to 
be called 'Chief.' Jeffrey Powers-Beck explains that in the early half 
of the 20th century, "it appeared virtually impossible for a baseball player 
of admitted native origin to be known popularly as anything but "Chief."[33] 
Former teammate and American League President Bobby Brown noted his heritage 
and a popular railroad influenced the baseball media to use the nickname, 
"But for some of you too young to remember, the Santa Fe Railroad at that 
time had a crack train (call the Superchief) that ran from California to 
Chicago, and it was known for its elegance, its power and its speed. "We 
always felt the name applied to Allie for the same reasons."[34] Brown 
notes that Reynolds was not comfortable with the nickname because of the 
importance of the 'chief' title. He also explained that his teammates called 
him Chief. "When we talked with him, we called him Allie... But when he 
wasn't in the room, he was referred to as the Chief, because we felt he 
was the one at the top, the real leader."[34] The Yankees dedicated a plaque 
in Reynolds' honor, to hang in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium on August 
26, 1989.[35] Reynolds was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame 
in 1986.[36] Oklahoma State renamed their baseball stadium after Reynolds.[37] 
In 1993, Reynolds received the Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award from 
the Jim Thorpe Association.[38] The association established the "Allie 
P. Reynolds Award" in 1998. It is presented annually to the Oklahoma "high 
school senior who best reflects the spirit of Allie Reynolds by maintaining 
the highest standards in scholarship, leadership, civic contributions and 
character."[39] When Reynolds was eligible for election to the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, 
his highest vote percentage was 33.6% in the 1968 balloting, short of the 
75 percent required for election.[21] That year, he finished ahead of future 
Hall of Famers Arky Vaughan, Pee Wee Reese, Phil Rizzuto, George Kell, 
Hal Newhouser, Bob Lemon, and Bobby Doerr. Reynolds was named as one of 
the ten former players that began their careers before 1943 to be considered 
by the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee for induction into the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009.[40] He received eight votes, one shy of 
the nine votes required for election.[21] Reynolds was on the new Golden 
Era Committee ballot in 2011 for 2012, (replaced the Veterans Committee)[21] 
receiving fewer than three votes (12 votes are required for election to 
the Hall of Fame).[41] The Committee meets and votes every three years 
on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era. He was not a candidate 
in 2014 (none were elected by the committee). Rob Neyer, in evaluating 
Reynolds' candidacy, believes Reynolds was "probably as good" as Jesse 
Haines, Lefty Gomez and Waite Hoyt, who have all been inducted into the 
Hall of Fame. However, he added that "they're all marginals."[21] Adapting 
Bill James' sabermetric statistic known as win shares, Dr. Michael Hoban, 
a professor emeritus of mathematics at City University of New York, found 
that Reynolds falls short of his threshold for induction, and scored lower 
than Haines and Gomez.[21] Reynolds became a successful oil businessman 
after his playing career.[2] He began investing in oil wells during his 
playing career.[42] Despite retiring, Reynolds was allowed to remain a 
member of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). He served 
as the AL player representative in the negotiations with owners to create 
the MLBPA pension plan.[2][43] He later sued administrators of the pension 
plan in federal court for "whittling away" the rights of retired players.[44] 
In 1969, Reynolds was named the President of the American Association, 
a Class AAA baseball league. The Association had been dormant for the previous 
six years.[45] Reynolds served as president until 1971, when he resigned 
to spend more time with his family and due to competing business interests.[46] 
He was also the President of the National Hall of Fame for Famous American 
Indians in Anadarko, Oklahoma, from 1978 until his death.[2] Reynolds was 
inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1991.[47] Reynolds died in Oklahoma 
City due to complications of lymphoma and diabetes.[2] He was survived 
by a son, a daughter, eight grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.[2]
