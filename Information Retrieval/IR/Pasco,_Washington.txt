Mayor Matt Watkins[1][2] Pasco (/ˈpæskoʊ/ US dict: păs′·kō) is a city in 
and the county seat of Franklin County, Washington, United States.[9] Pasco 
is one of three cities that make up the Tri-Cities region of the state 
of Washington. The Tri-Cities is a mid-sized metropolitan area of approximately 
279,116 people that also includes the cities of Kennewick and Richland 
in a 2015 estimate. Pasco's population was 59,781 at the 2010 census and 
70,560 as of the April 1, 2016 Washington State Population estimate. On 
October 16, 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped in the Pasco area, 
at a site now commemorated by Sacajawea State Park. The area was frequented 
by fur trappers and gold traders. In the 1880s, the Northern Pacific Railway 
was built near the Columbia River, bringing many settlers to the area. 
Pasco was officially incorporated on September 3, 1891. It was named by 
Virgil Bogue, a construction engineer for the Northern Pacific Railway 
after Cerro de Pasco,[10] a city in the Peruvian Andes, where he had helped 
build a railroad. In its early years, it was a small railroad town, but 
the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam in 1941 brought irrigation and agriculture 
to the area. Due in large part to the presence of the Hanford Site, the 
entire Tri-Cities area grew rapidly from the 1940s through 1950s. However, 
most of the population influx resided in Richland and Kennewick, as Pasco 
remained primarily driven by the agricultural industry, and to a lesser 
degree the NP Pasco rail yards. After the end of World War II, the entire 
region went through several "boom" and "bust" periods, cycling approximately 
every 10 years and heavily based on available government funding for Hanford-related 
work. Farming continues to be the economic driver for most of the city's 
industrial tax base. In the late 1990s, foreseeing another Hanford-related 
boom period, several developers purchased large farm circles in Pasco for 
residential and commercial development. Since that time, Pasco has undergone 
a transformation that has not only seen its population overtake the neighboring 
city of Richland, but also has resulted in growth in the city's retail 
and tourism industries. Recently incorporated land on the West side of 
the city has exploded into new housing tracts, apartments, and shopping 
centers. This area of the city has become referred to locally as "West 
Pasco", distinguishing it from the older area of town to the East. In addition 
to an influx of new residents to the region, many residents of the Tri-Cities 
have moved from Richland and Kennewick to West Pasco due to its central 
location and virtually all-new housing and business. Pasco is located at 
46°14′19″N 119°6′31″W﻿ / ﻿46.23861°N 119.10861°W﻿ / 46.23861; -119.10861 
(46.238507, -119.108534).[11] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 34.08 square miles (88.27 km2), of which, 
30.50 square miles (78.99 km2) is land and 3.58 square miles (9.27 km2) 
is water.[5] As Pasco is located in Southeastern Washington, the city lies 
in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. As a result, the area is a windswept 
desert, receiving little precipitation throughout the year. Hot summers, 
warm springs, and cold winters provide a stark contrast to other areas 
of the state. The massive Columbia River borders the south side of the 
city, separating it from the neighboring cities of Richland and Kennewick.

the Council-Manager form of government with an elected body of 7 council 
members, 5 of whom are from specific districts within the city, and 2 elected 
at-large. The council biennially elects from its own members a mayor that 
runs meetings, signs certain documents, and acts in ceremonial capacity; 
and a mayor pro-tem that acts in the mayor's absence. The city manager 
is chosen by council as a professional administrator and runs day-to-day 
operations of the city including management of staff. Council members are 
part-time legislators. Those elected after 2005 receive $900 per month 
and mayors receive $1,100 a month.[citation needed] The city also has a 
number of advisory boards appointed by the council and includes citizen 
volunteers that give their time and expertise in dealing with issues including 
parks, senior citizen issues, planning, code enforcement, etc.[citation

food processing companies have a presence in the city of Pasco. ConAgra 
Foods, Reser's Fine Foods, and Twin City Foods are just some of the companies 
that have chosen to base a part of their operations here. In recent years, 
the region has become a large player in Washington State's booming wine 
industry. Gordon Brothers Cellars, Fidelitas Winery, Kamiak Vineyards, 
and Preston Premium Wines are a few of the local wineries. Pasco is home 
to the Tri-Cities Airport, a regional commercial and private airport served 
by several airlines with direct flights to nine major US cities: Denver, 
Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Portland, Salt Lake City, 
San Francisco, and Seattle. The local Amtrak station has been located in 
Pasco since 1971, when the national rail passenger service was established. 
Before this, the Northern Pacific operated passenger trains through Pasco. 
Additional commercial transportation is also done through extensive barge 
traffic on the Columbia and Snake rivers. Rail transport is provided by 
the BNSF Railway. Trucking uses Interstate 182, and to a lesser extent 
U.S. Route 395. Some of the biggest Pasco employers include Hanford nuclear 
facility, Burlington Northern, Lamb Weston, Boise Cascade, Tyson Foods, 
Energy Northwest, Fluor Hanford Inc., Bechtel National Inc., and Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory currently managed by Battelle Memorial Institute 
Pasco is served by the Pasco School District, Columbia Basin College, and 
Washington State University Tri-Cities. Pasco High School is the older 
of the city's two public high schools, and was the largest in the state 
before Chiawana was built. The city's second high school—Chiawana High 
School—opened in August, 2009. Chiawana is currently the largest high school 
in this area of the state.[citation needed] The Pasco Bulldog school colors 
are purple and white; the Chiawana Riverhawk school colors are navy blue 
and silver. Privately, Pasco and the greater Tri-Cities area is served 
by Tri-Cities Prep, a Catholic high school off of Road 100, and St. Patrick's 
grade school next door to the campus of Pasco High School. With a rapidly 
growing campus, Columbia Basin College is the largest public two-year community 
college in Southeastern Washington with a student body of nearly 7,000 
students. The college was founded in 1955 and serves students from the 
entire Tri-Cities region. There are three middle schools in Pasco, serving 
students ranging from grade seventh to eight. The easternmost school is 
Ellen Ochoa Middle School, the westernmost is John McLoughlin Middle School, 
and the Isaac Stevens Middle School is in the middle. Among all of Pasco's 
annual activities and events, the most popular is the Pasco Farmers Market, 
located in downtown Pasco. The market is open from May through October 
each year, drawing a large regional crowd and providing an outlet for farmers 
selling fresh produce. The Fiery Foods Festival is another popular event 
held each September. This one-day event celebrates spicy foods of all varieties, 
and highlights the thriving Hispanic culture that lives in the city. Pasco's 
Gesa Stadium hosts the Tri-City Dust Devils baseball club of the Northwest 
League. The Dust Devils are a Class A team of the San Diego Padres. The 
team plays during summer months during its short season. The Pasco School 
District's renovated Edgar Brown Memorial Stadium, constructed in a former 
gravel pit used in the construction of the Blue Bridge, provides a unique 
venue for outdoor athletic events. Pasco is located along a major stretch 
of the 22-mile Sacagawea Heritage Trail, an interactive educational and 
recreational hiking/biking loop that circles the Tri-Cities area. Pasco 
has several waterfront parks along the Columbia River, as well as easy 
river access for boaters, fishers, and skiers at any of the free boat launches. 
The TRAC (Trade Recreation Agricultural Center) is a large complex located 
in West Pasco which hosts regional events, including (but not limited to) 
conventions, meetings, sporting events, and concerts. The TRAC is located
