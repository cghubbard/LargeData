Rockville Montgomery County, officially the County of Montgomery,[4][5] 
is a county in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2010 census, the population 
was 971,777, with a 2014 estimate putting the population at 1,030,447.[6] 
It is the most populous county in Maryland. The county seat and largest 
municipality is Rockville, although the census-designated place of Germantown 
is the most populous place.[7] Montgomery County is included in the Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, 
DC–VA–MD–WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. Most of the county's residents 
live in unincorporated locales, of which the most built up are Silver Spring, 
and Bethesda, though the incorporated cities of Rockville and Gaithersburg 
are also large population centers as are many smaller but significant places.[N 
1] As one of the most affluent counties in the United States,[8] it also 
has the highest percentage (29.2%) of residents over 25 years of age who 
hold post-graduate degrees.[9] In 2011, it was ranked by Forbes as the 
10th richest in the United States, with a median household income of $92,213.[10][11] 
Montgomery County, like other inner Washington, D.C. suburban counties, 
contains many major U.S. government offices, scientific research and learning 
centers, and business campuses, which provide a significant amount of revenue 
for the county.[12][13] The Maryland state legislature named Montgomery 
County after Richard Montgomery; the county was created from lands that 
had at one point or another been part of Frederick County. On September 
6, 1776,[2] Thomas Sprigg Wootton from Rockville, Maryland, introduced 
legislation, while serving at the Maryland Constitutional Convention, to 
create lower Frederick County as Montgomery County. The name, Montgomery 
County, along with the founding of Washington County, Maryland, after George 
Washington, was the first time in American history that counties and provinces 
in the thirteen colonies were not named after British referents. The name 
use of Montgomery and Washington County were seen as further defiance to 
Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. The county's nickname 
of "MoCo" is derived from "Montgomery County", after the pattern of SoHo, 
Manhattan. The county's motto, adopted in 1976, is "Gardez Bien", a phrase 
meaning "Watch Well". The county's motto is also the motto of its namesake's 
family.[14][15][16] Before European immigration, the land now known as 
Montgomery County was covered in a vast swath of forest crossed by the 
creeks and small streams that feed the Potomac and Patuxent rivers. A few 
small villages of the Piscataway, members of the Algonquian people, were 
scattered across the southern portions of the county. North of the Great 
Falls of the Potomac, there were few permanent settlements, and the Piscataway 
shared hunting camps and foot paths with members of rival peoples like 
the Susquehannocks and the Senecas. Captain John Smith of the English settlement 
at Jamestown was probably the first European to explore the area, during 
his travels along the Potomac River and throughout the Chesapeake region.[17] 
These lands were claimed by Europeans for the first time when George Calvert, 
1st Baron Baltimore was granted the charter for the colony of Maryland 
by Charles I of England.[18] However, it was not until 1688 that the first 
tract of land in what is now Montgomery County was granted by the Calvert 
family to an individual colonist, a wealthy and prominent early Marylander 
named Henry Darnall. He and other early claimants had no intention of settling 
their families. They were little more than speculators, securing grants 
from the colonial leadership and then selling their lands in pieces to 
settlers. Thus, it was not until approximately 1715 that the first British 
settlers began building farms and plantations in the area.[19] These earliest 
settlers were English or Scottish immigrants from other portions of Maryland, 
German settlers moving down from Pennsylvania, or Quakers who came to settle 
on land granted to a convert named James Brooke in what is now Brookeville. 
Most of these early settlers were small farmers, growing wheat and a variety 
of other subsistence crops in addition to the region's main cash crop, 
tobacco. Many of the farmers owned slaves. They transported the tobacco 
they grew to market through the Potomac River port of Georgetown.[20] Sparsely 
settled, the area's farms and taverns were nonetheless of strategic importance 
as access to the interior. General Edward Braddock's army traveled through 
the county on the way to its disastrous defeat at Fort Duquesne during 
the French and Indian War.[21] Like other regions of the American colonies, 
the region that is now Montgomery County saw protests against British taxation 
in the years before the American Revolution. In 1774, local residents met 
at Hungerford's Tavern and agreed to break off commerce with Great Britain.[22] 
Following the signing of the Declaration of Independence, representatives 
of the area helped to draft the new state constitution and began to build 
a Maryland free of proprietary control.[23] On September 6, 1776,[3] the 
Maryland Constitutional Convention formed Montgomery County from lands 
that had at one point or another been part of Charles, Prince George's 
and Frederick Counties, naming it after General Richard Montgomery.[24] 
The leaders of the new county chose as their county seat an area adjacent 
to Hungerford's Tavern near the center of the county, which later became 
Rockville.[25] The newly formed Montgomery County supplied arms, food and 
forage for the Continental Army during the Revolution, in addition to soldiers.[26] 
In 1791, portions of Montgomery County, including Georgetown, were ceded 
to form the new District of Columbia, along with portions of Prince George's 
County, Maryland, as well as parts of Virginia that were later returned 
to Virginia. In 1828, construction on the C&O Canal commenced and was completed 
in 1850. Laborers were. primarily Irish immigrants[27] Throughout the 19th 
century, agriculture dominated the economy in Montgomery County, with slaves 
playing a significant role, though the vast majority of farmers owned 10 
slaves or less rather than large plantations.[28] In the first half of 
the 19th century, low tobacco prices and worn-out soil caused many tobacco 
farms to be abandoned.[29] Crop production gradually shifted away from 
tobacco and toward wheat and corn. Prior to the Civil War, Montgomery County 
allied itself with other slaveholding counties in southern Maryland and 
the Eastern Shore.[27] Montgomery County was important in the abolitionist 
movement, especially among the Quakers in the northern part of the county 
near Sandy Spring.[30] Josiah Henson grew up as a slave on the Riley farm 
south of Rockville.[31] He wrote about his experiences in a memoir which 
became the basis for Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). 
A slave cabin where he is believed to have spent time still stands at the 
end of a driveway off Old Georgetown Road. Until 1860, only private schools 
existed in Montgomery County. Initially, schools for European American 
students were built. A school in Rockville for free African-Americans existed 
until 1866.[32] Another school for African-Americans was opened by 1877 
in Rockville.[33] Montgomery County's proximity to the nation's capital 
and split sympathies to North and South resulted in it being occupied by 
Union forces during the Civil War. The county was "invaded" on multiple 
occasions by Confederate and Union forces.[34] In 1855, work on the Metropolitan 
Branch of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad began, in order to provide a route 
between Washington, D.C., and Point of Rocks, Maryland.[35] In 1873, the 
railroad opened. The railroad spurred development at Takoma Park, Kensington, 
Garrett Park and Chevy Chase. By providing a much-needed transportation 
link, it also greatly increased the value of farmland and spurred the development 
of a dairy industry in the county.[36] During the Jim Crow era, masked 
mobs of local white men carried out two separate lynchings of African-American 
men in Montgomery County on Rockville's courthouse lawn. John Diggs was 
strung up by a rope in 1880 and Sydney Randolph met the same fate in 1896.[37][38] 
Neither man was found guilty in a court of law. Nor was anyone punished 
for the lynchings. On that same lawn, the Maryland Historical Society maintains 
a monument to the Confederate army as "heroes of the thin grey line",[39][40] 
because Montgomery County, like the rest of Maryland, was divided over 
the issue of secession.[41] One vocal sociologist has claimed Montgomery 
County was not welcoming of the Confederates during the Civil War.[42][43] 
No memorial exists for victims of Montgomery County's lynchings. On July 
1, 1922, the Montgomery County Police Department was established.[44] Prior 
to that time, law enforcement duties rested in the Montgomery County Sheriff 
and designated constables.[45] In 1922, the police department consisted 
of three to six officers who were appointed to two-year terms by the Board 
of County Commissioners, one of whom would be appointed as Chief.[45] In 
1927, the police department was enlarged to twenty officers.[45] The county 
began with most legislative power in the hands of the Maryland state government, 
with a five-person Montgomery County Board of Commissioners who oversaw 
the administration of the county but could neither pass county laws nor 
enact policies.[46] In 1915, Maryland amended its constitution.[46] According 
to the constitutional amendment,[47] a county's residents may propose a 
petition to create a nonpartisan Charter Board.[46] If the petition receives 
signatures from at least twenty percent of the county's registered voters, 
all county residents would vote to select the members of the Charter Board 
during the next general election.[46] The Charter Board would be authorized 
to draft a new system of county government, which could include a county 
council with the power to enact legislation and policies.[46] Charter Board's 
proposal would then be voted upon by registered voters during the following 
general election, and it would be enacted if approved by the voters.[46] 
The county commissioners authorized the Brookings Institution to study 
the existing county government structure and suggest recommendations in 
1938.[48] The 720-page report opined that the county had outgrown its form 
of government.[49] The study recommended the creation of a nonpartisan 
county council consisting of nine members representing defined districts 
of the county who could pass legislation, determine policy, and control 
over the administration of the county.[49] The study also recommended the 
hiring of a county administrator, the creation of an independent comptroller 
in charge of county finances, and a civil service commission.[49] The Montgomery 
County Civic Federation praised the study for its comprehensiveness.[50] 
The county commissioners appointed a citizen's committee to determine how 
to enact the study's recommendations.[51] The county commissioners strongly 
criticized the recommendation to create a county council, both because 
the council would be nonpartisan and because each county resident would 
be able to vote for only one representative rather than for all nine.[51] 
In 1942, Montgomery County Charter Committee was organized, which was formed 
primarily to circulate petitions to form a Charter Board.[52] The Charter 
Board petitioned to form a county council with the power to pass laws without 
the consent of the Maryland General Assembly and with authority over the 
administration the county.[53] While the Democratic Party did not explicitly 
denounce the charter,[54] it issued a statement calling out the ostensibly 
nonpartisan movement for hidden partisan goals[55] and claimed that backers 
of the charter petition for their alleged personal and political attacks 
on the Democratic Party and its officials.[56] The newly formed Independent 
Party endorsed the charter, praising county residents' goal of improving 
their form of government.[57] In the November 1942 election, county residents 
voted in favor of forming a Charter Board.[58] In 1943, the Charter Board 
released its draft charter.[59] The council would have nine unpaid members,[60] 
of which five would represent each of five single-member districts and 
four would represent the county at-large.[59] Council seats would be nonpartisan, 
each seat would be held for four years, and elections would occur every 
two years.[59] The council would have the power to enact legislation and 
hire a county manager, to whom all governmental department heads would 
report.[59] All sessions of the council would be open to the public.[59] 
The office of county treasurer would be abolished and replaced by a director 
of finance, who would be responsible for assessment and collection of taxes, 
assessments, and licenses, custody and disbursement of public funds and 
property, and preparation of monthly financial statements.[59] A department 
of public works, department of education, department of safety, department 
of welfare, and department of health would also be created.[59] The Montgomery 
County Charter Board opened its campaign headquarters in Bethesda, to serve 
as an information center regarding the draft charter.[61] The Charter Board 
emphasized that the draft charter would allow for county affairs to be 
decided by local representatives rather than by a vote of members of the 
Maryland General Assembly who represent citizens of all parts of the state.[61] 
Another group opposing the draft charter opened its headquarters in Bethesda.[60] 
The group said there was no good reason to abolish the functional state-level 
system already in place, and that the draft charter would increase taxes 
and establish heads of governmental agencies with indefinite terms who 
are not directly accountable to the public.[60] The group also said that 
making the council seats nonpartisan would go against the country's political 
history.[60] The editorial board of The Washington Post supported the draft 
charter.[62] The Montgomery County League of Women Voters also endorsed 
the draft charter.[63] In a near-record turnout,[64] a 1946 vote to enact 
a home-rule charter failed by a vote of 14,471 to 13,270.[65] Following 
the vote, proponents of the charter said they would not give up the fight.[66] 
Several months later, Montgomery County Democratic Party leader Col. E. 
Brooke Lee said he would support Montgomery County home rule by way of 
an act of the Maryland state legislature.[66] Lee proposed a bill to create 
a position of county supervisor, who would be in charge of routine county 
business, would appoint county employees subject to civil service rules 
and regulations, would supervise expenditures, and would prepare the operating 
and capital budgets.[67] The bill did not disband the county commissioners 
or create a county council.[67] The bill passed the state legislature and 
was signed by Governor Herbert R. O'Conor in 1945.[67] The county commissioners 
appointed Willard F. Day to the position.[67] In 1948, by a vote of 17,809 
in favor and 13,752 against, voters approved a charter for a "Council-Manager" 
form of government, making Montgomery County the first home-rule county 
in Maryland.[68] The charter created an elected seven-member County Council 
with the power to pass local laws.[68] All seven Council Members would 
be elected at-large by all county residents.[69] Five would have to live 
in five different residence districts, while the other two could live anywhere 
within the county.[69] The Council would serve as both the legislative 
and executive functions of the county.[70] Council members would elect 
one of their own to serve as president of the Council.[70] The charter 
also authorized the hiring of a county manager, the top administrative 
official,[71] who could be dismissed by the Council after a public hearing.[72] 
The charter created a department of public works, department of finance, 
and office of the county attorney, while it abolished the positions of 
county treasurer and police commissioner.[72] The first County Council 
was elected in 1949.[71] In 1962, a county civic group advocated for the 
election of a county executive.[73] The group's report said that the new 
position would give citizens another place to go if their concerns were 
refused by the Montgomery County Council.[73] The group said that the fact 
that the county had four appointed county managers in thirteen years demonstrates 
that establishing the position in 1948 had not been a stunning success.[73] 
The group also advocated for nonpartisan elections for council members.[74] 
Among the reasons for the suggested changes in governance is the fact that 
the county's population had more than doubled since the governmental system 
had been established in 1948.[73] In 1966, the Montgomery County Council 
adopted a proposed charter amendment to create a new elected position of 
County Executive.[75] Elected to a four-year term, the County Executive 
could veto legislation passed by the County Council, although five members 
of the County Council could vote to overrule the veto.[75] All Council 
Members would continue to be at-large, but they would need to live in seven 
different residence districts.[75] Republicans favored a referendum on 
the proposed charter amendment, while Democrats favored it in principle 
but urged the specific amendment's defeat because the duties of the County 
Executive were not specific enough.[76][77] In the referendum held in September 
1966,[78] the referendum was defeated, with 57 percent of voters opposed.[79] 
In February 1967, the Montgomery County Council formed a commission to 
draft a charter amendment to elect a county executive.[80] The commission's 
plan was to separate the legislative and executive functions of government.[70] 
The county council would continue to be the legislative branch of county 
government, and an elected full-time County Executive who could veto legislation 
passed by the Council; it would take five votes by the Council to override 
a veto.[81] The County Executive would hire a chief administrative officer 
to supervise the daily operations of the government.[81] All Council Members 
would be elected at-large by all county residents, but five of the seven 
would need to live in each of five different residential districts of substantially 
equal population.[81] In November 1968, the charter amendment was approved, 
with 53 percent of votes in favor.[82] In the first election for County 
Executive, held in 1970,[82] Republican James P. Gleason defeated Democrat 
William W. Greenhalgh by a margin of 420 votes.[83] In November 1986, voters 
amended the Charter to increase the number of Council seats in the 1990 
election from seven to nine. Now five members are elected by the voters 
of their council district and four are elected at-large. Each voter may 
vote for five council members; four at-large and one from the district 
in which they reside.[84] In November 1995, the City of Takoma Park held 
a state-sponsored referendum asking whether the portions of the city in 
Prince George's County should be annexed to Montgomery County or vice versa. 
The majority of votes in the referendum were in favor of unification of 
the entire city in Montgomery County.[85] Following subsequent approval 
by both counties' councils and the Maryland General Assembly, the county 
line was moved to include the entire city into Montgomery County (including 
territory in Prince George's County newly annexed by the city) on July 
1, 1997.[86] This added about 800 residents to Montgomery County's population.[87] 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 507 
square miles (1,310 km2), of which 491 square miles (1,270 km2) is land 
and 16 square miles (41 km2) (3.1%) is water.[88] Montgomery County lies 
entirely inside the Piedmont plateau. The topography is generally rolling. 
Elevations range from a low of near sea level along the Potomac River to 
about 875 feet in the northernmost portion of the county north of Damascus. 
Relief between valley bottoms and hilltops is several hundred feet. When 
Montgomery County was created in 1776, its boundaries were defined as "beginning 
at the east side of the mouth of Rock Creek on Potowmac river [sic], and 
running with the said river to the mouth of Monocacy, then with a straight 
line to Par's spring, from thence with the lines of the county to the beginning".[3] 
The county's boundary forms a sliver of land at the far northern tip of 
the county that is several miles long and averages less than 200 yards 
wide. In fact, a single house on Lakeview Drive and its yard is sectioned 
by this sliver into 3 portions, each separately contained within Montgomery, 
Frederick and Howard Counties. These jurisdictions and Carroll County meet 
at a single point at Parr's Spring on Parr's Ridge. Montgomery County lies 
within the northern portions of the humid subtropical climate. It has four 
distinct seasons, including hot, humid summers and cool winters. Precipitation 
is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, with an average of 43 
inches (110 cm) of rainfall.[89] Thunderstorms are common during the summer 
months, and account for the majority of the average 35 days with thunder 
per year. Heavy precipitation is most common in summer thunderstorms, but 
drought periods are more likely during these months because summer precipitation 
is more variable than winter. The mean annual temperature is 55 °F (13 °C). 
The average summer (June–July–August) afternoon maximum is about 85 °F 
(29 °C) while the morning minimums average 66 °F (19 °C). In winter (December–January–February), 
these averages are 44 °F (7 °C) and 28 °F (−2 °C). Extreme heat waves can 
raise readings to around and slightly above 100 °F (38 °C), and arctic 
blasts can drop lows to −10 °F (−23 °C) to 0 °F (−18 °C). For Rockville, 
the record high is 105 °F (41 °C) in 1954, while the record low is −13 °F 
(−25 °C).[89] Lower elevations in the south, such as Silver Spring, receive 
an average of 17.5 inches (44 cm) of snowfall per year.[90] Higher elevations 
in the north, such as Damascus,[91] receive an average of 21.3 inches (54 cm) 
of snowfall per year.[92] During a particularly snowy winter, Damascus 
received 79 inches (200 cm) during the 2009–2010 season.[93] In 2000, significant 
national ethnic groups included people of Irish (8.5%), German (8.1%), 
English (6.8%) and American (5.0%) ancestry according to Census 2000. There 
were 324,565 households of which 35% had children under the age of 18 living 
with them, 55.2% were married couples living together, 10.5% had a female 
householder with no husband present, and 30.9% were non-families. 24.4% 
of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.7% had someone living 
alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 
2.66 and the average family size was 3.19. 25.4% of the population was 
under the age of 18, 6.9% from 18 to 24, 32.3% from 25 to 44, 24.2% from 
45 to 64, and 11.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
37 years. For every 100 females there were 92.1 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 88.1 males. In 2000, there were 334,632 housing 
units at an average density of 675 per square mile (261/km2). Montgomery 
County has the tenth highest median household income in the United States, 
and the second highest in the state after Howard County as of 2011. The 
median household income in 2007 was $89,284 and the median family income 
was $106,093. Males had a median income of $66,415 versus $52,134 for females. 
The per capita income for the county was $43,073. About 3.3% of families 
and 4.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.6% 
of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over. Since the 1970s, 
the county has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) zoning 
plan that requires developers to include affordable housing in any new 
residential developments that they construct in the county. The goal is 
to create socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich 
and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who 
provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission 
to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build 
more housing and generate more revenue. Montgomery County was one of the 
first counties in the U.S. to adopt such a plan, but many other areas have 
since followed suit. As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 971,777 people, 
357,086 households, and 244,898 families residing in the county.[99] The 
population density was 1,978.2 inhabitants per square mile (763.8/km2). 
There were 375,905 housing units at an average density of 765.2 per square 
mile (295.4/km2).[100] The racial makeup of the county was 57.5% white, 
17.2% black or African American, 13.9% Asian, 0.4% American Indian, 0.1% 
Pacific islander, 7.0% from other races, and 4.0% from two or more races. 
Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 17.0% of the population.[99] 
In terms of ancestry, 10.7% were German, 9.6% were Irish, 7.9% were English, 
and 2.9% were American.[101] Of the 357,086 households, 35.7% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 53.4% were married couples living 
together, 11.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 31.4% 
were non-families, and 25.0% of all households were made up of individuals. 
The average household size was 2.70 and the average family size was 3.22. 
The median age was 38.5 years.[99] The median income for a household in 
the county was $93,373 and the median income for a family was $111,737. 
Males had a median income of $71,841 versus $55,431 for females. The per 
capita income for the county was $47,310. About 4.0% of families and 6.0% 
of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.2% of those 
under age 18 and 6.3% of those age 65 or over.[102] The United States Census 
Bureau estimates the county's population as 1,030,447 as of 2014.[103] 
Of residents age 25 or older, 91.2% graduated high school, and 57.1% had 
a bachelor's degree.[103] The ethnic makeup of the county was estimated 
to be the following in 2013:[103] In addition, 18.3% were Hispanic or Latino, 
of any race. The county has a sizable Jewish population, and is home to 
an increasing number of affluent Indians, Armenians and Iranians. There 
is also a large population of African immigrants to the United States.[citation

It is the epicenter for biotechnology in the Mid-Atlantic region. Montgomery 
County, as third largest biotechnology cluster in the U.S., holds a large 
cluster and companies of large corporate size within the state. Biomedical 
research is carried out by institutions including Johns Hopkins University's 
Montgomery County Campus (JHU MCC), and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 
(HHMI). Federal government agencies engaged in related work include the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), and the 
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Many large firms are based in the 
county, including Discovery Communications, Coventry Health Care, Lockheed 
Martin, Marriott International, Host Hotels & Resorts, Travel Channel, 
Ritz-Carlton, Robert Louis Johnson Companies (RLJ Companies), Choice Hotels, 
MedImmune, TV One, BAE Systems Inc, Hughes Network Systems and GEICO. Other 
U.S. federal government agencies based in the county include the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(NRC), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST), the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center 
(WRNMMC), and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). Downtown 
Bethesda and Silver Spring are the largest urban business hubs in the county; 
combined, they rival many major city cores. According to the county's comprehensive 
annual financial reports, the top employers by number of employees in the 
county are the following. "NA" indicates not in the top ten employers for 
the year given. Montgomery County was granted a charter form of government 
in 1948. The present County Executive/County Council form of government 
of Montgomery County dates to November 1968 when the voters changed the 
form of government from a County Commission/County Manager system, as provided 
in the original 1948 home rule Charter. The Montgomery County Police Department 
provides county-wide law enforcement services, although several cities 
including Rockville and Gaithersburg maintain their own police departments 
to complement MCPD. Maryland State Police patrol Interstate highways 495 
(the "Beltway") and 270 and assist county and city police in investigation 
of some major crimes. The office of the county executive was established 
in 1970. The first executive was James P. Gleason. The current executive 
is Isiah "Ike" Leggett, who was sworn in for his first term on December 
4, 2006. He was reelected on November 2, 2010 and on November 4, 2014. 
The last Republican serving on the Montgomery County Council, Howard A. 
Denis of District 1 (Potomac/Bethesda), was defeated in 2006. The board 
has since been all-Democratic. The members of the County Council for the 
2014–2018 term are: Montgomery County has a budget of $2.3 billion. Approximately 
$128 million are invested in Montgomery County Public Schools.[107] Montgomery 
and Prince George's Counties share a bi-county planning and parks agency 
in the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (often referred 
to as Park and Planning or its initials M-NCPPC by county residents) and 
a public bi-county water and sewer utility in the Washington Suburban Sanitary 
Commission (WSSC).[citation needed] Montgomery County is an alcoholic beverage 
control county. Beer and wine may still be sold in individual stores and 
at a single location within the county for a store chain. Until 1964, only 
three restaurants in the county had liquor licenses to serve liquor by 
the drink.[108] The county stopped issuing liquor licenses to all other 
restaurants under a law that had existed since Prohibition.[109] Following 
a voter referendum,[110] restaurants and bars could apply for county permits 
to sell liquor by the drink.[109] The dry towns of Kensington, Poolesville, 
and Takoma Park were allowed to keep their own bans in place.[109] Anchor 
Inn in Wheaton was the first establishment to serve liquor in the county 
under the new law.[108] Since 2013, Montgomery has been represented in 
the U.S House of Representatives by John Sarbanes of the 3rd district, 
John Delaney of the 6th district, and Chris Van Hollen of the 8th district. 
Montgomery County is approximately bisected northwest-southeast by Interstate 
270, a connector linking Interstate 70 with Washington. I-270 divides in 
North Bethesda with its primary roadway connecting to the eastbound Capital 
Beltway (Interstate 495), and a spur connecting to southbound I-495 as 
it approaches Northern Virginia. Another spur highway, Interstate 370, 
connects Interstate 270 with the Shady Grove Metro station. An east-west 
toll freeway, the Intercounty Connector (Maryland Route 200), also known 
as the ICC, links Interstate 370 and I-270 with U.S. 29; Interstate 95, 
and terminates at U.S. 1 in Laurel, Prince George's County. The first portion 
of the freeway, from I-370 to Georgia Avenue, opened in February 2011. 
The second portion, from Georgia Avenue to I-95, opened in November 2011. 
The final, 1.5 mile section of highway, from I-95 to Route 1, opened in 
November 2014. Roughly paralleling 270 is Maryland Route 355, a surface 
street known for much of its length as Rockville Pike or simply "The Pike". 
In its southern reaches it is known as Wisconsin Avenue, while in the north 
it is known as Frederick Road, or Frederick Ave in Gaithersburg; in the 
northern half of Rockville (from Town Center north), it is named Hungerford 
Drive. Other major routes include Maryland Route 190 (River Road); Maryland 
Route 97 (Georgia Avenue); Maryland Route 650 (New Hampshire Avenue), Maryland 
Route 185 (Connecticut Avenue), Randolph Road/Montrose Road, Maryland Route 
28 (Darnestown Road, Montgomery Avenue and Norbeck Road), and Maryland 
Route 27 (Father Hurley Blvd., Ridge Road). U.S. Route 29 parallels the 
eastern border of the county; first as Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring, 
then Colesville Road, and thence as Columbia Pike through Burtonsville 
and into Howard County. The Montgomery County government has strongly supported 
the use of automated traffic enforcement on county roads. In 2007 this 
county became the first jurisdiction in Maryland to introduce automated 
speed cameras on roads with speed limits up to 35 mph, issuing fines of 
$40 by mail. Red light cameras with fines of $75 are also in use.[111] 
A 1970s-era computer system coordinates the setting of 750 traffic lights. 
In 2009, the computer system failed for a brief period, causing considerable 
problems.[112] Montgomery County operates its own bus public transit system, 
known as Ride On. Major routes closer to its rail service area are also 
covered by WMATA's Metrobus service. Montgomery County is served by three 
passenger rail systems. Amtrak, the U.S. national passenger rail system, 
operates its Capitol Limited to Rockville, between Washington Union Station 
and Chicago Union Station. The Brunswick line of the MARC commuter rail 
system makes stops at Silver Spring, Kensington, Garrett Park, Rockville, 
Washington Grove, Gaithersburg, Metropolitan Grove, Germantown, Boyds, 
Barnesville, and Dickerson, where the line splits into its Frederick and 
Martinsburg branches. Both suburban arms of the Red Line of the Washington 
Metro serve Montgomery County. It follows the CSX right of way to the west, 
roughly paralleling Route 355 from Friendship Heights to Shady Grove. The 
eastern side runs between the two tracks of the CSX right of way from Washington 
Union Station to Silver Spring, and roughly parallels Georgia Avenue, from 
Silver Spring to Glenmont. There has been much debate on the construction 
of two new transitways, both of which are still in the early stages of 
design. The Purple Line would run "cross-town" connecting nodes in Montgomery 
and Prince George's Counties near the Beltway; and the Corridor Cities 
Transitway would provide an extension of the Red Line corridor from Gaithersburg 
to Germantown and beyond. The Montgomery County Airpark (FAA GAI, ICAO 
KGAI), a general aviation facility in Gaithersburg, is the major airport 
in the county. Davis Airport (FAA Identifier W50), a privately owned airstrip, 
is located in Laytonsville on Hawkins Creamery Road.[113] Commercial air 
service is provided at the nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National, Washington 
Dulles International, and BWI Airports. Educative system is conformed by 
Montgomery County Public Schools, Montgomery College and other institutions 
in the area. Elementary and secondary public schools are operated by the 
Montgomery County Public Schools and has a budget of 3.41 US$Billions for 
2015. MCPS operates under the jurisdiction of an elected Board of Education. 
Its current members are: The county is also served by Montgomery College, 
a public, open access community college that has a budget of 950 US$ Millions 
for 2015. The county has no public university of its own, but the state 
university system does operate a facility called Universities at Shady 
Grove in Rockville that provides access to baccalaureate and Master's level 
programs from several of the state's public universities. Montgomery County 
Public Libraries (MCPL) is the public library system for residents of Montgomery 
County, Maryland. The system includes 23 individual libraries. It has a 
budget 38 US$ Millions for 2015. On November 11, 2014, the Board approved 
an amendment introduced by Rebecca Smondrowksi to modify the school calendar 
to delete all references to religious holidays such as Christmas, Easter, 
Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah. The amendment was in response to requests 
by an interfaith organization called Equality for Eid which asked that 
the listing for the Islamic holiday, Eid Al-Adha be listed alongside Yom 
Kippur which occurred on the same day. The Smondrowski amendment received 
both national[114] and international[115] attention. Criticism of the Smondrowski 
amendment came from a variety of sources including the Montgomery County 
Executive, Isiah Leggett, and congressman John Delaney.[116] Montgomery 
County is religiously diverse. Of Montgomery County's population, according 
to the Associations of Religion Data, 13% is Catholic, 5% is Baptist, 4% 
is Evangelical Protestant, 3% is Jewish, 3% is Methodist/Pietist, 2% is 
Adventist, 2% is Presbyterian, 1% is Episcopalian/Anglican, 1% is Mormon, 
1% is Muslim, 1% is Lutheran, 1% is Eastern Orthodox, 1% is Pentecostal, 
1% is Buddhist, and 1% is Hindu.[117][N 2] The Seventh-day Adventist Church 
maintains its General Conference headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland.[118] 
Bethesda's Congressional Country Club has hosted four Major Championships, 
including three playings of the U.S. Open, most recently in 2011 which 
was won by Rory McIlroy. The Club also hosts the Quicken Loans National, 
an annual event on the PGA Tour which benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation. 
Previously, neighboring TPC at Avenel hosted the Booz Allen Classic. The 
Bethesda Big Train, Rockville Express, and Silver Spring-Takoma Thunderbolts 
all play college level wooden bat baseball in the Cal Ripken Collegiate 
Baseball League. Montgomery County is home of the Montgomery County Swim 
League, a youth (ages 4–18) competitive swimming league composed of ninety 
teams based at community pools throughout the county. There are future 
possibilities of a minor league baseball team forming to play for the Atlantic 
League of Professional Baseball to represent Montgomery County. Since 1949 
the Montgomery County Agricultural Fair, the largest in the state, showcases 
farm life in the county. The week long event offers family events, carnival 
rides, live animals, entertainment and food. Visitors can also view entries 
of canned and baked goods, clothing, quilts and produce from local county 
farmers.[119] Occupying a middle ground between incorporated and unincorporated 
areas are Special Tax Districts, quasi-municipal unincorporated areas created 
by legislation passed by either the Maryland General Assembly or the county.[120] 
The Special Tax Districts generally have limited purposes, such as providing 
some municipal services or improvements to drainage or street lighting.[120] 
Special Tax Districts lack home rule authority and must petition their 
cognizant governmental entity for changes affecting the authority of the 
district. The four incorporated villages of Montgomery County and the town 
of Chevy Chase View were originally established as Special Tax Districts. 
Four Special Tax Districts remain in the county: Unincorporated areas are 
also considered as towns by many people and listed in many collections 
of towns, but they lack local government. Various organizations, such as 
the United States Census Bureau, the United States Postal Service, and 
local chambers of commerce, define the communities they wish to recognize 
differently, and since they are not incorporated, their boundaries have 
no official status outside the organizations in question. The Census Bureau 
recognizes the following census-designated places in the county: Coordinates:
