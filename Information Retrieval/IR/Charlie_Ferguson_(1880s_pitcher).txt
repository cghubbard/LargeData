Charles J. "Charlie" Ferguson (April 17, 1863 – April 29, 1888) was an 
American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire 
four-year career for the Philadelphia Quakers (who were later renamed the 
Phillies). When not pitching, he increasingly played in the outfield and 
– in his final season – at second base.[1] Born in Charlottesville, Virginia, 
he played college baseball and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania 
in 1883. After graduation, he played for the Virginia representative in 
the Eastern League, with his team winning the championship.[2] Ferguson 
made his major league debut with the Quakers in 1884. Philadelphia finished 
6th in the National League that season, and Ferguson had a win/loss record 
of 21-25.[3] That was the only season in which he produced a losing record, 
and he had his highest earned run average with 3.54.[1] The next season, 
his record improved to 26-20, and his ERA dropped to 2.22,[1] while Philadelphia 
improved in the standings, finishing third in 1885.[4] On August 29, he 
pitched a no-hitter against the Providence Grays, a 1-0 victory.[5] He 
continued his dominance in the 1886 season, winning 30 games and again 
lowering his ERA, this time to 1.98,[1] good for second in the NL behind 
Henry Boyle of the St. Louis Maroons.[6] In 1887, he won 22 games and had 
a 3.00 ERA. That same season, he played 27 games at second base, and had 
264 at bats. Along with his 22 victories, he led the team in runs batted 
in with 85, and his .337 batting average would have led his team as well 
had his total plate appearances been enough to qualify for the batting 
title.[7] Before the 1888 baseball season, he contracted typhoid fever 
and subsequently died in Philadelphia.[2] He is interred in Maplewood Cemetery 
in his hometown of Charlottesville.[1] For the 1888 season, the Quakers, 
Washington Nationals, New York Giants and Boston Beaneaters wore a black 
crepe on their left sleeves to commemorate Ferguson.[8] In 1931, Wilbert 
Robinson rated Ferguson as the fifth-best player to that point in baseball
