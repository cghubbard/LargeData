Medford is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, in the United States, 
on the Mystic River, 3.2 miles northwest of downtown Boston. In the 2010 
U.S. Census, Medford's population was 56,173. It is the home of Tufts University. 
Medford was settled in 1630 as part of Charlestown. The area was originally 
called "Mistick" by Thomas Dudley (a name which persisted for many decades), 
which his party renamed "Meadford".[1] In 1634, the land north of the Mystic 
River became the private plantation of former Governor Matthew Cradock; 
across the river was Ten Hills Farm, which belonged to John Winthrop, Governor 
of the Massachusetts Bay colony.[2] The name may have come from a description 
of the "meadow by the ford" in the Mystic River, or from two locations 
in England that Cradock may have known: the hamlet of Mayford or Metford 
in Staffordshire near Caverswall, or from the parish of Maidford or Medford 
(now Towcester, Northamptonshire).[3] In 1637, the first bridge (a toll 
bridge) across the Mystic River was built at the site of the present-day 
Cradock Bridge, which carries Main Street into Medford Square.[4] It would 
be the only bridge across the Mystic until 1787, and as such became a major 
route for traffic coming into Boston from the north (though ferries and 
fords were also used).[5] The bridge would be rebuilt in 1880 and 1909.[4] 
Until 1656, all of northern Medford was owned by Cradock, his heirs, or 
Edward Collins. Medford was governed as a "peculiar" or private plantation. 
As the land began to be divided among several people from different families, 
the new owners began to meet and make decisions locally and increasingly 
independently from the Charlestown town meeting. In 1674, a Board of Selectmen 
was elected, in 1684, the colonial legislature granted the ability to raise 
money independently, and in 1689, a representative to the legislature was 
chosen. The town got its own religious meeting room in 1690, and a secular 
meeting house in 1696.[5] The land south of the Mystic River was known 
as "Mistick Field". It was transferred from Charlestown to Medford in 1754.[6] 
This grant also included the "Charlestown Wood Lots" (the Medford part 
of the Middlesex Fells), and part of what was at the time Woburn (now Winchester).[7] 
Parts of Medford were transferred to Charlestown in 1811, Winchester in 
1850 ("Upper Medford"), and Malden in 1879. Additional land was transferred 
to Medford from Malden (1817), Everett (1875), and Malden (1877) again.[3][8] 
The population of Medford went from 230 in 1700 to 1,114 in 1800. After 
1880, the population rapidly expanded, reaching 18,244 by 1900.[9] Farmland 
was divided into lots and sold to build residential and commercial buildings, 
starting in the 1840s and 1850s; government services expanded with the 
population (schools, police, post office) and technological advancement 
(gas lighting, electricity, telephones, railways).[8] Tufts University 
was chartered in 1852 and the Crane Theological School at Tufts opened 
in 1869. Medford was incorporated as a city in 1892[10] and was a center 
of industry, including the manufacture of brick[11] and tile, rum,[12] 
Medford Crackers, and clipper ships[13] such as the White Swallow and the 
Kingfisher, both built by Hayden & Cudworth.[14] During the 17th century, 
a handful of major public roads (High Street, Main Street, Salem Street, 
"the road to Stoneham", and South Street) served the population, but the 
road network started a long-term expansion in the 18th century.[15] The 
Medford Turnpike Company was incorporated in 1803, but turned what is now 
Mystic Avenue over to the city in 1866. The Andover Turnpike Company was 
incorporated in 1805, but turned what is now Forest Street and Fellsway 
West over to Medford in 1830.[8] Other major commercial transportation 
projects included the Middlesex Canal by 1803,[16] the Boston and Lowell 
Railroad in West Medford in the 1830s, and the Boston and Maine Railroad 
to Medford Center in 1847. A horse-powered street railway began running 
to Somerville and Charlestown in 1860. The street railway network expanded 
in the hands of various private companies, and went electric in the late 
1890s, when trolleys to Everett and downtown Boston were available.[8] 
Streetcars were converted to buses in the 20th century. Interstate 93 was 
constructed between 1956 and 1963.[17] In 1868, a French astronomer and 
naturalist, Leopold Trouvelot, was attempting to breed a better silkworm 
using Gypsy moths. Several of the moths escaped from his home, at 27 Myrtle 
Street. Within ten years, the insect had denuded the vegetation in the 
neighborhood. It spread over North America.[18][19] In a tavern and boarding 
house on High Street (Simpson's Tavern) in the late 19th century, local 
resident James Pierpont wrote "Jingle Bells" after watching a sleigh race 
from Medford to Malden. Another local resident, Lydia Maria Child (1802–1880), 
made a poem out of the trip across town to her grandparents' house, now 
the classic song "Over the River and Through the Woods". Medford was home 
to Fannie Farmer, author of one of the world's most famous cookbooks—as 
well as James Plimpton, the man credited with the 1863 invention of the 
first practical four-wheeled roller skate, which set off a roller craze 
that quickly spread across the United States and Europe. George Luther 
Stearns, an American industrialist and one of John Brown's Secret Six. 
His passion for the abolitionist cause shaped his life, bringing him into 
contact with the likes of Abraham Lincoln and Ralph Waldo Emerson and starting 
The Nation magazine. He was given the rank of major by Massachusetts Governor 
John Andrew and spent most of the Civil War recruiting for the 54th and 
55th Massachusetts regiments and the 5th cavalry. Amelia Earhart lived 
in Medford while working as a social worker in 1925. Elizabeth Short, the 
victim of an infamous Hollywood murder and who became known as The Black 
Dahlia, was born in Hyde Park (the southernmost neighborhood of the city 
of Boston, Massachusetts) but raised in Medford before going to the West 
Coast looking for fame. The Peter Tufts House (350 Riverside Ave.) is thought 
to be the oldest all-brick building in New England. Another important site 
is the "Slave Wall" on Grove Street, built by "Pomp," a slave owned by 
the prominent Brooks family. The Isaac Royall House, which once belonged 
to one of Harvard Law School's founders, Isaac Royall, Jr., is a National 
Historic Landmark and a local history museum. The house was used by Continental 
Army troops, including George Washington and John Stark, during the American 
Revolutionary War. Medford has sent more than its share of athletes to 
the National Hockey League; Shawn Bates, though born in Melrose, MA grew 
up in Medford, as did Keith Tkachuk, Mike Morrison, David Sacco, and Joe 
Sacco. Former Red Sox pitcher Bill Monbouquette grew up in Medford. Medford 
was home to Michael Bloomberg, American businessman, philanthropist, and 
the founder of Bloomberg L.P.. He was the Mayor of New York City from 2002-2013. 
Mayor Bloomberg attended Medford High School and resided in Medford until 
after he graduated from college at Johns Hopkins University.[20] His mother 
remained a resident of Medford until her death in 2011. The only cryobank 
of amniotic stem cells in the United States is located in Medford, built 
by Biocell Center, a biotechnology company led by Giuseppe Simoni. Medford

Medford's many neighborhoods, was once the bastion of some of Boston's 
elite families— including Peter Chardon Brooks, one of the wealthiest men 
in post-colonial America, and father-in-law to Charles Francis Adams — 
and is also home to an historic African-American neighborhood that dates 
to the Civil War.[36] As of the census[37] of 2010, there were 56,173 people,

by environmental mitigation provisions of the Big Dig project,[58] is ongoing. 
On February 2, 2009, the state formally endorsed extending the Green Line 
through Medford, terminating near the intersection of Boston Avenue and 
Mystic Valley Parkway (Massachusetts Route 16). As proposed, the terminus 
would not have parking facilities. The extension would serve an additional 
10,000 potential Green Line riders. Joseph's Limousine and Transportation
