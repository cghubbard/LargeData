Sussex County is the northernmost county in the State of New Jersey. Its 
county seat is Newton.[2][5] It is part of the New York City Metropolitan 
Area. The county had a Census-estimated population of 143,673 in 2015, 
a 3.7% decrease from the 149,265 enumerated in the 2010 United States Census,[4] 
in turn an increase of 5,099 (3.5%) over the 144,166 persons enumerated 
in the 2000 Census, retaining its position as the 17th-most populous county 
among the state's 21 counties.[6] Based on 2010 Census data, Vernon Township 
was the county's largest in both population and area, with a population 
of 23,943 and covering an area of 70.59 square miles (182.8 km2).[7] As 
of 2010[update] The Bureau of Economic Analysis ranked the county as having 
the 131st-highest per capita income ($49,207) of the 3,113 counties in 
the United States (and the ninth-highest in New Jersey).[8] The county 
was established in 1753 and named after historic County Sussex, England.[9][10] 
Because of its topography, Sussex County has remained a relatively rural 
and forested area. The county is part of the Skylands Region, a term promoted 
by the New Jersey Commerce, Economic Growth, & Tourism Commission to encourage 
tourism. In the western half of the county, several state and federal parks 
have kept the large tracts of land undeveloped and in their natural states. 
The eastern half of the county has had more suburban development because 
of its proximity to more populated areas and commercial development zones. 
Until the mid-20th century, most of Sussex County's economy was based on 
agriculture (chiefly dairy farming) and the mining industry. With the decline 
of these industries in the 1960s, Sussex County was transformed into a 
bedroom community that absorbed population shifts from New Jersey's urban 
areas. Recent studies estimate that 60 percent of Sussex County residents 
work outside of the county, many seeking or maintaining employment in New 
York City or New Jersey's more suburban and urban areas. The area of Sussex 
County and its surrounding region was occupied for approximately 8,000-13,000 
years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples.[11] At the time of 
European encounter, the Munsee Indians inhabited the region. The Munsee 
were a loosely organized division of the Lenape (or Lenni Lenape), a Native 
American people also called "Delaware Indians" after their historic territory 
along the Delaware River. The Lenape inhabited the mid-Atlantic coastal 
areas and inland along the Hudson and Delaware rivers.[12] The Munsee spoke 
a very distinct dialect of the Lenape and inhabited a region bounded by 
the Hudson River, the head waters of the Delaware River and the Susquehanna 
River, and south to the Lehigh River and Conewago Creek.[13][14] As a result 
of disruption following the French and Indian War (1756–1763) the American 
Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and later Indian removals from the eastern 
United States, the main Lenape groups now live in Ontario in Canada, and 
in Wisconsin and Oklahoma in the United States.[15][16] As early as 1690, 
Dutch and French Huguenot colonists from towns along the Hudson River Valley 
in New York began permanently settling in the Upper Delaware Valley (known 
as the "Minisink"). The route these Dutch settlers had taken was the path 
of an old Indian trail and became the route of the Old Mine Road and stretches 
of present-date U.S. Route 209.[17] These Dutch settlers penetrated the 
Minisink Valley and settled as far south as the Delaware Water Gap, by 
1731 this valley had been incorporated as Walpack Precinct. Throughout 
the 18th century, immigrants from the Rheinland Palatinate in Germany and 
Switzerland fled religious wars and poverty to arrive in Philadelphia and 
New York City. Several German families began leaving Philadelphia to settle 
along river valleys in Northwestern New Jersey and Pennsylvania's Lehigh 
Valley in the 1720s, spreading north into Sussex County in the 1740s and 
1750s as additional German emigrants arrived.[18][19] Also during this 
time, Scottish settlers from Elizabethtown and Perth Amboy, and English 
settlers from these cities, Long Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts, 
came to New Jersey and moved up the tributaries of the Passaic and Raritan 
rivers, settling in the eastern sections of present-day Sussex and Warren 
counties.[19] By the 1750s, residents of this area began to petition colonial 
authorities for a new county to be formed; they complained of the inconvenience 
of long travel to conduct business with the government and the courts. 
By this time, four large townships had been created in this sparsely populated 
Northwestern region: Walpack Township (before 1731), Greenwich Township 
(before 1738), Hardwick Township (1750) and Newtown Township (1751). On 
June 8, 1753, Sussex County was created from these four municipalities, 
which had been part of Morris County when Morris stretched over all of 
northwestern New Jersey.[1] Sussex County at this time encompassed present-day 
Sussex and Warren Counties and its boundaries were drawn by the New York-New 
Jersey border to the north, the Delaware River to the west, and the Musconetcong 
River to the south and east.[20] After several decades of debate over where 
to hold the sessions of the county's courts, the state legislature eventually 
voted to divide Sussex County in two, using a line drawn from the juncture 
of the Flat Brook and Delaware River in a southeasterly direction to the 
Musconetcong River running through the Yellow Frame Presbyterian Church 
in present-day Fredon Township (then part of Hardwick).[21] On November 
20, 1824, Warren County was created from the southern territory of the 
Sussex County.[21] Throughout the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, Sussex 
County's economy was largely centered around agriculture and the mining 
of iron and zinc ores. Early settlers established farms whose operations 
were chiefly focused towards subsistence agriculture. Because of geological 
constraints, Sussex County's agricultural production was centered around 
dairy farming. Several farms had orchards—typically apples and peaches—and 
surplus fruit and grains were often distilled or brewed into alcoholic 
beverages (hard ciders, applejack and fruit brandies). This was the economic 
model until the mid-19th century when advances in food preservation and 
the introduction of railroads (e.g. the Sussex Railroad) into the area 
allowed Sussex County to transport farm products throughout the region. 
Railroads also promoted the building of factories as companies relocated 
to the area at the end of the 19th century—including that of the H.W. Merriam 
Shoe Company (1873) in Newton.[22] The Highlands Region of Northwestern 
New Jersey has proven to possess rich deposits of iron ore. In the mid 
18th century, several entrepreneurial colonists began mining iron in area 
around Andover, Hamburg, and Franklin present-day Sussex County and establishing 
forges and furnaces to create pig iron and bar iron. During the American 
Revolution, the Quartermaster Department of the Continental Army complained 
to Congress of difficulties in acquiring iron to support the war effort 
and the Congress ordered two colonels, Benjamin Flower and Thomas Maybury 
to take possession of the iron works at Andover in order to equip General 
Washington's army. During the middle of the 19th century, under the management 
of Cooper and Hewitt, the Andover mine produced 50,000 tons of iron ore 
each year. The firm manufactured railroad rails and the country's first 
structural steel, which and led to the building of railroads and commercial 
development in the county. Iron from the Andover mines was fashioned into 
cable wire for the bridge built at Niagara Falls and for the beams used 
to rebuild Princeton University's Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey 
after a fire undermined the structure in 1855. During the American Civil 
War, Andover iron found its way into rifle barrels and cannonballs just 
as it had during the Revolution years before. As deposits were depleted, 
the iron mining industry began to diminish by the mid-19th century. During 
the late 19th century, prolific American inventor Thomas Edison began to 
explore the commercial opportunities of processing poor-quality low-grade 
iron ore to combat the growing scarcity of iron deposits in the United 
States.[23] He began to purchase mining companies in Sussex County in the 
1880s and consolidating their assets.[24] He developed a process of crushing 
and milling iron-bearing minerals and separating iron ore from the material 
through large electromagnets, and built one of the world's largest ore-crushing 
mills near Ogdensburg. Completed in 1889, the factory contained three giant 
electromagnets and was intended to process up to 1200 tons of iron ore 
every day. However, technical difficulties repeatedly thwarted production.[25][26] 
However, in the 1890s, richer soft-grade iron ore deposits located in Minnesota's 
Iron Range rendered Edison's Ogdensburg operation unprofitable and he closed 
the works in 1900.[25][26] Edison adapted the process and machinery for 
the cement industry and invested in producing Portland Cement in other 
locations.[27][28] In the early 19th century, Samuel Fowler (1779–1844) 
settled in Franklin Furnace (now Franklin) to open up a medical practice, 
but is largely known for his interest in mineralogy which led to his developing 
commercial uses for zinc and for discovery of several rare minerals (chiefly 
various ores of zinc).[29][30] Many of these zinc minerals are known for 
fluorescing in vivid colors when exposed to ultraviolet light.[30][31] 
Because of both the rich deposits and many of these minerals are not found 
anywhere else on earth, Franklin is known as the "Fluorescent Mineral Capitol 
of the World."[31][32][33] Fowler, who later briefly served in elected 
political office, operated the local iron works and bought several abandoned 
zinc and iron mines in the area.[29][30] Shortly after his death, two companies 
were created to exploit the iron and zinc deposits in this region; they 
acquired the rights to Fowler's holdings in Franklin and nearby Sterling 
Hill. These companies later merged to form the New Jersey Zinc Corporation 
(today known as Horsehead Industries).[30] At this time, Russian, Chilean, 
British, Irish, Hungarian and Polish immigrants came to Franklin to work 
in the mines, and the population of Franklin swelled from 500 (in 1897) 
to over 3,000 (in 1913).[34] Declining deposits in the Franklin area, the 
expense of pumping groundwater from mine shafts, tax disputes and misdirected 
investments by the company led to the abandonment of the mines.[30][35] 
Today, both the Franklin and Sterling Hill mines are operated as museums.[35] 
Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, construction or improvements of Interstate 
80, Route 181 and Route 23 triggered rapid growth to Sussex County. Since 
1950, the population has increased from 34,423 people to 130,943 people 
in 1990.[36] This has caused Sussex County to begin developing into a light 
suburban atmosphere, instead of the sparsely populated rural region it 
once was, especially in the eastern half of the county. Around 450 million 
years ago the Martinsburg Shale was uplifted when a chain of volcanic islands 
collided with proto North America. These islands slid over the North American 
plate, and deposited rock on top of the plate, forming the Highlands and 
Kittatinny Valley. At that time the western part of Sussex County was under 
a shallow inland sea. Fossils of sea shells and fish can be found west 
of the Kittatinny ridge. Then approximately 400 million years ago, a small, 
narrow continent collided with North America. Pressure from the collision, 
created heat in the bed rock which folded and faulted the Silurian Shawangunk 
Conglomerate that was under the shallow sea. The pressure created intense 
heat, melted the quartzite, and allowed it to bend, creating an uplift. 
as cooling occurred this cemented the quartz pebbles and conglomerate together. 
This is how the Kittatinny Ridge was created. The strike from this continent 
was from the south east, this is why the Kittatinny ridge is on a northeast-southwest 
axis. The Wisconsin glacier which covered the entire county from 23,000B.C 
to 13,000 B.C. created many lakes and streams. The glacier covered Kittatinny 
mountain. As climate warmed around 13,000 B.C. the area was first a tundra 
with lichens and mosses. After a few thousand years coniferous forests 
began to grow. As climate grew warmer around 8000 B.C., deciduous forests 
began to grow with nut trees such as oak, and maple. Around 3000 B.C. other 
nut bearing trees began to grow such as hickory, butternut, walnut and 
beech. This allowed the Paleo Indian populations to increase. The county 
is drained by the Paulinskill River, the Flatbrook, which drain into the 
Delaware River, the Wallkill River which flows north to the Hudson River. 
There are many smaller creeks that drain into these water sheds. High Point, 
located at the northernmost tip of New Jersey in Montague Township, is 
the highest natural elevation in the state at 1,803 feet (549.5 m) above 
sea level.[37][38][39] Nearby, Sunrise Mountain in Stokes State Forest 
has an elevation of 1,653 feet (504 m). Many mountains in the Highlands 
region range between 1000 and 1500 feet (375–450 m).[40]:p.3 Officially, 
the county's lowest elevation is approximately 300 feet (90 m) above sea 
level along the Delaware River near Flatbrookville.[41] However, local 
authorities claim that the mine adit descending 2,675 feet (815 m) at the 
Sterling Hill Mine in Ogdensburg is unofficially the lowest elevation in 
New Jersey.[38] According to the 2010 Census, the county had a total area 
of 535.74 square miles (1,387.6 km2), including 519.01 square miles (1,344.2 km2) 
of land (96.9%) and 16.73 square miles (43.3 km2) of water (3.1%).[7][42] 
It is the fourth-largest of the state's 21 counties in terms of area.[43] 
Sussex County is located within two of New Jersey's physiographic provinces: 
(1) The Ridge and Valley Appalachians, and (2) the New York-New Jersey 
Highlands regions.[44] The features of the Ridge and Valley province were 
created approximately 400 million years ago during the Ordovician period 
and Appalachian orogeny— by a continent striking North America the creating 
Kittatinny Mountain, Blue Mountain, and the Appalachian Mountains.[45][46] 
This physiographic province occupies approximately two-thirds of the county's 
area (the county's western and central sections) dominated by Kittatinny 
Mountain and the Kittatinny Valley. This province's contour is characterized 
by long, even ridges with long, continuous valleys in between that generally 
run parallel from southwest to northeast. This region is largely formed 
by sedimentary rock.[44][47] The New York-New Jersey Highlands, or Highlands 
region, located in the county's eastern section is older. An extension 
of the Reading Prong formation stretching from Pennsylvania to Connecticut, 
the Highlands were created from geological forces created from when a small 
continent went over the North American plate. This rock created the highlands 
of Sussex County. Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock approximately 
500 million years ago.[44][48] The watersheds within the Highlands provide 
fresh water resources for millions of residents in New Jersey and the New 
York City Metropolitan Area.[49] Because of this, the region was protected 
by the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jim McGreevey under the Highlands 
Water Protection and Planning Act enacted in 2004.[50] This act sought 
to protect these water resources from development by promoting open space 
and farmland preservation, creating new recreational parks, and consolidating 
the regulatory authority over land use planning in a regional planning 
commission known as the Highlands Council.[51][52] The Delaware River forms 
the western and northwestern boundary of Sussex County. This region is 
known as the Upper Delaware Valley and historically as the Minisink or 
Minisink Valley. Elevations in the regions along the river range from 300 
to 500 feet.[40]:p.3 Kittatinny Mountain is the dominant geological feature 
in the western section of the county. It is part of the Appalachian Mountains, 
and part of a ridge that continues as the Blue Mountain in Eastern Pennsylvania, 
and as Shawangunk Ridge in New York to the north. It begins in New Jersey 
as the eastern half of the Delaware Water Gap, and runs northeast to southwest 
along the Delaware River. Elevations range from 1,200 feet (370 m) to 1,800 
feet (550 m) and attains a maximum elevation of 1,803 feet (550 m) at High 
Point, in Montague Township.[40]:p.3 Between Kittatinny Mountain and the 
Delaware River is the Wallpack Ridge, a smaller, narrow ridge spanning 
25 miles (40 km) in length from the Walpack Bend near Flatbrookville north 
to Port Jervis, New York. Wallpack Ridge encloses the watershed of the 
Flat Brook and its two main tributaries Little Flat Brook and Big Flat 
Brook, and ranges in elevation from 500 feet (150 m) to 900 feet (270 m) 
and reaching its highest elevation at 928 feet (283 m).[40]:p.3 [53] The 
Kittatinny Valley lies to the east of Kittatinny Mountain and ends with 
the Highlands in the east. It is largely a region of rolling hills and 
flat valley floors. Elevations in this valley range from 400 to 1,000 feet.[40]:p.3 
It is part of the Great Appalachian Valley running from eastern Canada 
to northern Alabama. This valley is shared by three major watersheds—the 
Wallkill River, with its tributaries Pochuck Creek and Papakating Creek 
flowing north; and the Paulins Kill watershed and Pequest River watershed 
flowing southwest. This valley floor consists of shale and slate (part 
of the Ordovician Martinsburg Formation) and of limestone (part of the 
Jacksonburg Formation). Several parties have argued about the possibility 
of natural gas extraction in the region's Martinsburg and Utica shale formations, 
similar to the Marcellus Shale formations to the West in Pennsylvania and 
New York.[54] Of special interest is Rutan Hill, a 440-million-year-old 
patch of igneous rock known as nepheline syenite. This site, north of Beemerville 
in Wantage Township, was once an ancient volcano—the only extant dormant 
volcano sites in the state.[55] Dividing the Kittatinny Valley (and the 
Ridge and Valley Province) from the Highlands region is a narrow fault 
of Hardyston Quartzite. Many of the mountains in the Highlands are not 
part of a solid, linear ridge and tend to randomly rise from the surrounding 
land as the result of folds, faults and intrusions. Elevations in the Highlands 
region range from 1,000 to 1,500 feet.[40]:p.3 The more prominent mountains 
in this area are Hamburg Mountain (elevation: 1,495 feet (456 m)), Wawayanda 
Mountain (elevation 1,448 feet (441 m)), Sparta Mountain (elevation: 1,232 
feet (376 m)) and Pochuck Mountain (elevation: 1,194 feet (364 m)) which 
form a ridge along the county's eastern flank. Sussex County's rivers and 
watersheds flow in three directions; north to the Hudson River, west and 
south to the Delaware River, and east toward Newark Bay. Historically, 
these rivers and streams were used to power various types of mills (i.e. 
grist mills, fulling mills, etc.), transport goods to market, and later 
to generate electric power (after 1880). Today, these rivers are chiefly 
used in local recreational activities—including canoeing and fishing. The 
Fish Culture Unit of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife stocks 
these waterways each year with various species of trout.[59] Some of these 
rivers—especially the Flat Brook, Paulins Kill and Pequest—have become 
well known as trout streams and for their suitability for fly-fishing.[60] 
The Flat Brook and its tributary the Big Flat Brook are regarded as the 
state's premiere trout stream.[61] According to the Natural Resource Conservation 
Service, Sussex County soils are derived from parent materials that are 
largely till and glaciofluvial deposits, alluvium, and organic matter deposits. 
Till is the rock of soil material transported or deposited by glacial ice. 
In this case, the most recent glaciation (i.e. the last ice age), the Wisconsinian 
continental glacier, deposited a till plain composed of ground and recessional 
moraines. This glaciation reached its maximum extent roughly 22,000 years 
ago (20,000 B.C.E.). Glaciofluvial deposits (or "outwash") are rock and 
soil materials that melting glaciers deposit as the glacier recedes. Alluvium 
is materials that are deposited by floodwaters from engorged bodies of 
water—chiefly streams and rivers. Organic deposits are largely the result 
of decomposing plant material.[40]:p.213–216[62] The following are Sussex 
County's 24 incorporated municipalities (with census-designated places 
(CDPs) listed within their parent municipalities and 2010 Census populations 
shown for some places):[7][63][64] With its location at the top of New 
Jersey, Sussex County is bordered by counties in New Jersey, and neighboring 
New York and Pennsylvania. Because it is shaped roughly like a diamond 
or rhombus with its point matching the cardinal points of the compass, 
its boundary lines are roughly oriented along the ordinal or intercardinal 
directions. The following counties are adjacent and contiguous to Sussex 
County (in order starting with the northernmost and rotating clockwise): 
A large percentage of Sussex County is undeveloped because it has been 
reserved as one of 11 federal or state parks or as part of several wildlife 
management areas. Because of its location in the higher elevations of northwestern 
New Jersey's Appalachian mountains, Sussex County has a cooler humid continental 
climate or microthermal climate (Köppen Dfb) which indicates patterns of 
significant precipitation in all seasons and at least four months where 
the average temperature rises above 10 °C (50 °F)[66][67] This differs 
from the rest of the state which is generally a humid mesothermal climate, 
in which temperatures range between -3 °C (27 °F) and 18 °C (64 °F) during 
the year's coldest month.[67][68] Sussex County is part of USDA Plant Hardiness 
Zone 6.[69][70] During winter and early spring, New Jersey in some years 
is subject to "nor'easters"—significant storm systems that have proven 
capable of causing blizzards or flooding throughout the northeastern United 
States. Hurricanes and tropical storms, tornadoes, and earthquakes are 
relatively rare. The Kittatinny Valley to the north of Newton, part of 
the Great Appalachian Valley, experiences a snowbelt phenomenon and has 
been categorized as a microclimate region known as the "Sussex County Snow 
Belt." This region receives approximately forty to fifty inches of snow 
per year and generally more snowfall that the rest of Northern New Jersey 
and the Northern Climate Zone.[71] This phenomenon is attributed to the 
orographic lift of the Kittatinny Ridge which impacts local weather patterns 
by increasing humidity and precipitation, providing the ski resorts of 
Vernon Valley in the northeastern part of this region with increased snowfall.[72] 
In recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Newton have 
ranged from a low of 17 °F (−8 °C) in January to a high of 84 °F (29 °C) 
in July. Average monthly precipitation ranged from 2.86 inches (73 mm) 
in February to 4.76 inches (121 mm) in June.[73] According to the USDA 
Natural Resource Conservation Service soil survey, the area receives sunshine 
approximately 62% of the time in summer and 48% in winter. Prevailing winds 
are typically from the southwest for most of year; but in late winter and 
early spring come from the northwest. The lowest recorded temperature was 
−26 °F on January 21, 1994. The highest recorded temperature was 104 °F 
(40 °C) on September 3, 1953. The heaviest one-day snowfall was 24 inches 
recorded on January 8, 1996 (combined with the next day, total snowfall 
was 40 inches). The heaviest one-day rainfall–6.70 inches— was recorded 
on August 19, 1955.[40] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 149,265 
people, 54,752 households, and 40,626 families residing in the county. 
The population density was 287.6 per square mile (111.0/km2). There were 
62,057 housing units at an average density of 119.6 per square mile (46.2/km2). 
The racial makeup of the county was 93.46% (139,504) White, 1.79% (2,677) 
Black or African American, 0.16% (234) Native American, 1.77% (2,642) Asian, 
0.02% (36) Pacific Islander, 1.19% (1,783) from other races, and 1.60% 
(2,389) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 6.44% 
(9,617) of the population.[3] There were 54,752 households, of which 33.5% 
had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61% were married couples 
living together, 9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 
25.8% were non-families. 21% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.69 and the average family size was 3.14.[3] 
In the county, 24% of the population were under the age of 18, 7.6% from 
18 to 24, 23.9% from 25 to 44, 32.6% from 45 to 64, and 12% who were 65 
years of age or older. The median age was 41.8 years. For every 100 females 
there were 98.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
96.9 males.[3] As of the 2000 United States Census[78] there were 144,166 
people, 50,831 households, and 38,784 families residing in the county. 
The population density was 277 people per square mile (107/km²). There 
were 56,528 housing units at an average density of 108 per square mile 
(42/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 95.70% White, 1.0% Black 
or African American, 0.11% Native American, 1.20% Asian, 0.02% Pacific 
Islander, 0.74% from other races, and 1.14% from two or more races. 3.30% 
of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[76][79] Among those 
residents listing their ancestry, 24.5% were of Italian, 22.9% German, 
22.2% Irish, 10.7% English, 8.1% Polish and 5.2% Dutch ancestry according 
to Census 2000.[79][80] In 2000 there were 50,831 households out of which 
39.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.0% were married 
couples living together, 8.0% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 23.7% were non-families. 18.9% of all households were made 
up of individuals and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of 
age or older. The average household size was 2.80 and the average family 
size was 3.24.[76] In the county the age distribution of the population 
shows 27.9% under the age of 18, 6.2% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 
25.3% from 45 to 64, and 9.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 37 years. For every 100 females there were 98.0 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 95.6 males.[76] Sussex County is 
considered an affluent area as many of its residents are college-educated, 
employed in professional or service jobs, and earn above the state's average 
per capita income and household income statistics. As of 2010[update], 
the Bureau of Economic Analysis ranked the county as having the 131st-highest 
per capita income of all 3,113 counties in the United States (and the ninth-highest 
in New Jersey).[8] Average per capita income was $49,207 and was 23.2% 
above the national average.[8] As of the 2000 Census, the median household 
income was $65,266 and the median family income was $73,335. Males had 
a median income of $44,544 compared with $32,487 for females. The per capita 
income for the county was $26,992. About 6.30% of families and 8.40% of 
the population were below the poverty line, including 10.50% of those under 
age 18 and 8.00% of those age 65 or over.[79][81] As of 2010[update], there 
were a total of 54,881 households enumerated in the 2010 census, with a 
reported median household income of $84,115, or mean household income of 
$96,527. Males had a median income of $50,395 versus $33,750 for females. 
The per capita income for the county was $26,992. About 2.8% of families 
and 4.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.1% 
of those under age 18 and 5.4% of those age 65 or over.[citation needed] 
As of the 2006–2010 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census 
Bureau, 3.6% of county residents were living below the poverty line which 
the government defined as an annual household income under $22,350 for 
a family of four.[82] However, recent surveys indicate that in the county's 
town centers, Sussex Borough (15.1%), Newton (12.8%) and Andover Borough 
(12.7%), poverty levels reach double-digits.[82] Of these poverty-level 
residents, an estimated 44% are employed, many of them underemployed despite 
working multiple jobs.[82] As of the 2010 Census, the county's unemployment 
rate was 11.0%. The Census Bureau reported a population of 118,420 persons 
(above age 16) available for the labor force of which 82,449 (69.6%) were 
actively employed in civilian labor, and 35,971 (30.4%) were not in the 
labor force. Early industry and commerce chiefly centered on agriculture, 
milling, and iron mining. As iron deposits were exhausted, mining shifted 
toward zinc deposits near Franklin and Ogdensburg during the late 19th 
and early 20th centuries. The local economy expanded due to the introduction 
of railroads and shortly after the Civil War, the town centers hosted factories. 
However, the factories, railroads and mining declined by the late 1960s. 
Today, Sussex County features a mix of rural farmland, forests and suburban 
development. Because agriculture (chiefly dairy farming) has decreased 
and that the county hosts little industry, Sussex County is considered 
a "bedroom community" as most residents commute to neighboring counties 
(Bergen, Essex and Morris counties) or to New York City for work. Although 
Sussex County's dairy farming industry has declined significantly in the 
last 50 years it is still the majority of agricultural production in the 
region.[83] Trucking has replaced railroads in the transportation of milk 
products to regional production facilities and markets. Rising taxes, regulation 
and decreasing profitability in dairy farming have forced farmers to adapt 
by growing other products or converting their farms to other uses.[83] 
Many farmers have sold their properties to real estate developers who have 
built residential housing. Many Sussex County farms are nursery farms producing 
ornamental trees, plants and flowers used in horticulture, floristry or 
landscaping. Christmas trees and nursery and greenhouse plants contribute 
to 51% of the county's annual crop revenues but account for 30% of crop 
production.[83] Despite the decline of dairy farming, it is still the largest 
contributor to the county's annual agricultural revenues. According to 
the Sussex County Comprehensive Farmland Preservation Plan (2008): dairy 
production has steadily trended downward since 1971, when the county produced 
138 million pounds of milk. By 2005 this quantity had fallen to 38.4 million 
pounds. The decrease is further reflected in the number of dairy farms 
and milk cows in 1982 as compared to 2002. In 1982 there were 137 dairy 
farms; by 2002 the number had decreased to only 30. In 1982 there were 
6,406 milk cows; in 2002 the quantity had fallen to 1,943.[84] According 
to county agricultural statistics, 17.3% of all crop sales ($1.4 million 
in 2002) were in hay. Nearly 80% of tilled farmland, or 21,195 acres (8,577 ha), 
on 43% of the farms in the county is dedicated to hay production. Much 
of hay is grown for feed on livestock farms — especially dairy farms — 
and never makes it to market and is therefore not included in federal agricultural 
census data.[84] In 2002, 4,059 acres (1,643 ha) were dedicated to corn 
cultivation, the majority of it used for feed on the same farms.[84] According 
to the 2007 Census of Agriculture compiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
National Agricultural Statistics Service, Sussex County has 1,060 farms 
totaling 65,242 acres (26,403 ha; 101.941 sq mi) out of New Jersey's total 
10,327 farms managing 773,450 acres (313,000 ha; 1,208.52 sq mi). This 
is up from 1,029 farms in the 2002 Census. However, acreage dedicated to 
agriculture declined by 13.6% from 75,496 acres (30,552 ha; 117.963 sq mi) 
in 2002.[85] Note though that 102,547 acres—roughly 30% of the county's 
land area—are under farmland assessment for the purpose of calculating 
property tax levies.[86] This decrease is total acreage is due, in large 
part, to "suburban sprawl" as farmers capitalized by converting to commercial 
and residential development. The average size of a farm in 2007 was 62 
acres (25 ha) acres, down from 73 acres (30 ha).[85] The 2007 acreage dedicated 
to agriculture is roughly 19.6% of the county's land area. The county-wide 
total agricultural product sales in 2007 was $21,242,000, up from $14,756,000 
in 2002.[85] Total county market value of land and buildings in 2007 was 
$888,955,000, an increase from $520,997,000 in 2002. The average market 
value per farm was $838,636 (2007), up from $505,823 (2002). This results 
in a per acre price of $13,625 (2007), up from $7,136 (2002).[85] With 
the repeal of several prohibition-era alcohol laws in 1981, 43 wineries 
have become licensed and are operating in the state. New Jersey wines have 
grown in stature due to increased marketing and quality, recent successes 
and awards in competitions, and appreciation by critics. Sussex County 
is home to three established and operating wineries and three more are 
in development.[87] Sussex County's industrial and manufacturing base is 
no longer towards heavy industry and mining. Today, companies like Thorlabs, 
are located here. Because of its lower population, large amount of land 
area preserved by state and federal parks and open space preservation programs, 
and conservative politics, Sussex County has lower spending on education 
(through regional school districts) and government services and thus has 
lower taxes than its neighboring counties. Most municipalities do not have 
police departments or paid firemen—instead relying on the rural service 
of the New Jersey State Police and volunteer fire departments. In several 
municipalities, taxes on an acre of land, depending on the condition and 
size of the house, could be as low as $1,500 a year. Typical property taxes 
in the county are in the $4,000–$8,000 a year range.[citation needed] Sussex 
County is governed by a five-member Board of Chosen Freeholders who are 
elected in partisan elections on an at-large basis to serve three-year 
terms of office as part of the November general election. This board serves 
both as a legislative body and as an administrative body with broad powers 
over the county's budget, government services, and infrastructure. Seats 
on the five-member board are elected on a staggered basis over a three-year 
cycle, with two seats available in the first year, two seats the following, 
and then one seat. All terms of office begin on January 1 and end on December 
31. At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning of January, 
the board selects a Freeholder Director and Deputy Director from among 
its members, with day-to-day supervision of the operation of the county 
delegated to a County Administrator.[88] As of 2014[update], Sussex County's 
Freeholders are:[88][89][90][91][92] The freeholders appoint a County Administrator 
to oversee the day-to-day management of the county by both "implementing 
the policy directives set forth by the Board of Chosen Freeholders" and 
"directing, managing, or guiding the County's administrative departments, 
divisions and agencies." The Administrator is John Eskilson.[99] Many services 
overseen by the county government overlap with those provided at the municipal 
level. The County government oversees and administers the following areas 
of responsibility: Before 1911, two freeholders from each township were 
elected annually to serve on the board. However, as this became unwieldy 
in the late 19th Century during the era of Boroughitis and the creation 
of hundreds of municipalities, the State Legislature chose to reorganize 
the size of county freeholder boards to an odd number between three and 
nine members. The size of the board was a reflection of the county's population. 
As Sussex County was rural and among the least populated counties in the 
state, for the next 80 years, Sussex County's Board of Chosen Freeholders 
consisted of three elected members. The board increased from three to five 
members in 1992. Pursuant to Article VII Section II of the New Jersey State 
Constitution, each county in New Jersey is required to have three elected 
administrative officials known as "constitutional officers." These officers 
are the County Clerk (elected for a five-year term), the County Surrogate 
(elected for a five-year term) and the County Sheriff (elected for a three-year 
term).[100] The County Clerk is responsible for certifying notaries; processing 
and recording deeds, mortgages, and real estate documents; business trade 
names, processing petitions from candidate for elective office, drawing 
up ballots, overseeing elections and counting ballots, and many other tasks.[101] 
The County Clerk is Jeffrey M. Parrott (R, 2016).[102] The County Sheriff 
is responsible for law enforcement, protection of the courts, administering 
the county jail, and the delivery and service of court documents. The current 
County Sheriff is Michael F. Strada (R, 2016).[103] The County Surrogate 
is both a constitutional officer and judge with jurisdiction over estate 
and probate matters (wills, guardianships, trusteeships), and in processing 
adoptions.[104] The County Surrogate is Gary R. Chiusano (R).[105] Sussex 
County is a part of Vicinage 10 of the New Jersey Superior Court (along 
with Morris County), which is seated at the Morris County Courthouse in 
Morristown; the Assignment Judge for Vicinage 15 is the Honorable Stuart 
M. Minkowitz.[106][107][108] Cases venued in Sussex County are heard at 
the Sussex County Judicial Center in Newton.[108] Sussex County is part 
of two congressional districts:[109][110] New Jersey is represented in 
the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[113] 
and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[114][115] All of Sussex County is 
in the 24th Legislative District, along with portions of Morris and Warren 
counties.[116][117] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), 
the 24th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Steve Oroho (R, Franklin) and in the General Assembly 
by Parker Space (R, Wantage Township) and Gail Phoebus (R, Andover Township).[118] 
Sussex County is a predominantly Republican area, as among registered voters, 
affiliations with the Republican Party outpace those of the Democratic 
Party by a ratio of about five to two.[119] All five members of the county 
board of Chosen Freeholders, all three county-wide constitutional officers, 
and all except a few of the 108 municipal offices among the county's 24 
municipalities are held by Republicans.[citation needed] In the 2004 U.S. 
Presidential election, George W. Bush carried the county by a 29.6% margin 
over John Kerry, the largest margin for Bush in any county in New Jersey, 
with Kerry carrying the state by 6.7% over Bush.[120] In 2008, John McCain 
carried Sussex County by a 20.6% margin over Barack Obama, McCain's best 
showing in New Jersey, with Obama winning statewide by 15.5% over McCain.[121] 
Sussex County is the home county of Scott Garrett, who is by far the most 
conservative congressman from New Jersey. He represents almost all of Sussex 
County along with Warren County, northern Passaic County, and northern 
Bergen County. The southeast corner of Sussex County is represented by 
Rodney Frelinghuysen. As of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 98,158 
registered voters in Sussex, of which 16,150 (16.5% vs. 16.5% countywide) 
were registered as Democrats, 38,583 (39.3% vs. 39.3%) were registered 
as Republicans and 43,311 (44.1% vs. 44.1%) were registered as Unaffiliated. 
There were 114 voters registered to other parties.[119] Among the county's 
2010 Census population, 65.8% were registered to vote, including 86.5% 
of those ages 18 and over.[119][122] In the 2012 presidential election, 
Republican Mitt Romney received 40,625 votes here (59.4%), ahead of Democrat 
Barack Obama with 26,104 votes (38.2%) and other candidates with 1,465 
votes (2.1%), among the 68,404 ballots cast by the county's 100,152 registered 
voters, for a turnout of 68.3%.[123] In the 2008 presidential election, 
Republican John McCain received 44,184 votes here (59.2%), ahead of Democrat 
Barack Obama with 28,840 votes (38.7%) and other candidates with 1,130 
votes (1.5%), among the 74,593 ballots cast by the county's 96,967 registered 
voters, for a turnout of 76.9%.[124] In the 2004 presidential election, 
Republican George W. Bush received 44,506 votes here (63.9%), ahead of 
Democrat John Kerry with 23,990 votes (34.4%) and other candidates with 
900 votes (1.3%), among the 69,649 ballots cast by the county's 89,679 
registered voters, for a turnout of 77.7%.[125] In the 2009 gubernatorial 
election, Republican Chris Christie received 31,749 votes here (63.3%), 
ahead of Democrat Jon Corzine with 12,870 votes (25.7%), Independent Chris 
Daggett with 4,563 votes (9.1%) and other candidates with 663 votes (1.3%), 
among the 50,137 ballots cast by the county's 95,941 registered voters, 
yielding a 52.3% turnout.[126] Municipalities that do not have their own 
police departments have services provided by the New Jersey State Police. 
One of the primary responsibilities of the New Jersey State Police is to 
provide police services to these rural towns, for which the municipality 
is assessed an annual fee paid to the state government[127] The New Jersey 
State Police are located on Route 206 in Augusta. Less than half of the 
county's municipalities have a local police department. Police Departments 
are located in the municipalities of Vernon, Hardyston, Sparta, Byram, 
Hopatcong, Stanhope, Andover, Newton, Ogdensburg, Franklin, and Hamburg. 
The other 13 municipalities are rural and rely on State Police coverage. 
Stillwater disbanded its police department in 2010. The New Jersey State 
Park Police has jurisdiction throughout the state, but patrol primarily 
in Stokes State Forest and other local state parks. Crime is relatively 
low in Sussex County. In the 2012 New Jersey Uniform Crime Report, Sussex 
County reported the following arrests:[128] The above arrest data includes 
both minor and adult arrests. Sussex County has one daily newspaper, the 
New Jersey Herald, which is published six days each week (Sunday through 
Friday). Established in 1829 by Grant Fitch, the Herald is one of the oldest 
continuing newspapers in the state with distribution throughout Sussex 
County and into neighboring Morris and Warren counties in New Jersey, Orange 
County, New York and Pike County, Pennsylvania. Its headquarters, and production 
facilities are located in Newton, New Jersey.[129] Its printing facilities 
were located in Newton, as well, but in 2012 the newspaper's printing was 
outsourced to North Jersey Media Group, located in Rockaway, New Jersey.[130] 
It was for most of its existence published once per week. It's Sunday edition, 
the New Jersey Sunday Herald, was first published on June 11, 1962, and 
for the next few years it was published twice weekly. In 1969, after a 
sale to American Newspapers, Inc., a daily edition was planned which began 
publication on March 16, 1970. American Newspapers, Inc., sold the New 
Jersey Herald to Quincy Newspapers (its current owner) in March 1980. Today, 
its content includes coverage of local news and sporting events (chiefly 
those in Sussex County) and printing selected articles from the Associated 
Press covering state, national and international events.[131] Sussex County 
is served by Service Electric Cable Television (SECTV) through its affiliate 
Service Electric Cable Company in Sparta, New Jersey. Service Electric 
also offers broadband Internet and telephone services through two partner 
companies, PenTeleData and Ironton Telephone.[132] Service Electric has 
offered channels for local access programming (channel 10) and for "community 
bulletin boards". It offers two free Public Service Announcements or event 
advertisements for free to non-profit organizations in Sussex and Warren 
Counties.[133] WMBC-TV an independent television station owned by Mountain 
Broadcasting Corporation, is licensed to operate in Newton. It is recognized 
for providing Korean language programming in the New York metropolitan 
area but also offers English-language programs. Its studios are located 
in West Caldwell, New Jersey and its transmitter near Lake Hopatcong. Before 
2009, it operated an analog transmission on virtual channel 63 (UHF-63) 
but has converted to broadcasting its signal on digital channel 18. The 
New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority maintains the license to operate 
a low-power translator (W36AZ) in Sussex Borough to broadcast the state's 
public television station, NJTV.[134] This station, which used to be the 
New Jersey Network (NJN), is operated by WNET.org, the parent company of 
New York City's flagship public television stations, WNET and WLIW, through 
a subsidiary nonprofit organization, Public Media NJ. Sussex County is 
served largely by radio stations in the New York City metropolitan area. 
Stations from Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania; Hudson Valley in New York; 
can also be heard. iHeartMedia owns a cluster of three stations in the 
county, including: 102.3 FM WSUS in Franklin (Format: Adult contemporary), 
103.7 FM WNNJ in Newton (Format: Classic rock), and 106.3 FM WHCY in Franklin 
(Format: Contemporary Hits Radio/Top 40). Centro Biblico of NJ also owns 
a Spanish language Christian station, 1360 AM WTOC in Newton. Stations 
nearby include 91.9 FM WXPJ broadcast from Centenary College in Hackettstown 
(Warren County) with a public radio and progressive music format and 1110 
AM WTBQ in Warwick, New York with a NewsTalk and Sports format. New Jersey 
Public Radio (NJN), affiliated with National Public Radio and American 
Public Media, operates two stations in the region: 88.5 FM WNJP in Sussex, 
and 89.3 FM WNJY in Netcong. Sussex County is served by a number of roads 
connecting it to the rest of the state and to both Pennsylvania and New 
York. According to the county government, "a vast majority of residents 
who use single occupant vehicles to travel outside the county for employment. 
Thus, the demand for public transportation in the county is minimal."[135] 
Interstate 80 passes through the extreme southern tip of Sussex County 
solely in Byram.[136] Interstate 84 passes just yards north of Sussex County, 
but never enters New Jersey. New Jersey's Route 15, Route 23, Route 94, 
Route 181, Route 183, and Route 284 pass through the County, as does U.S. 
Route 206.[137][138] As of 2010[update], the county had a total of 1,313.67 
miles (2,114.15 km) of roadways, of which 888.54 miles (1,429.97 km) were 
maintained by the local municipality, 313.29 miles (504.19 km) by Sussex 
County and 111.35 miles (179.20 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation 
and 0.49 miles (0.79 km) by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission.[139] 
Sussex County has two toll-bridge crossings over the Delaware River. Operated 
by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, the Milford-Montague 
Toll Bridge (also known as the US 206 Toll Bridge) carries U.S. Route 206 
over the Delaware connecting Montague Township and Milford, Pennsylvania. 
The current bridge was opened in 1954, replacing a series of bridges located 
here beginning in 1826.[140]:p.73–85 Route 206 merges with U.S. Route 209 
a mile south of the village center. Tolls are collected only from motorists 
traveling westbound, into Pennsylvania. The Dingman's Ferry Bridge is the 
last privately owned toll bridge on the Delaware River and one of the last 
few in the United States.[140]:p.93–102[141] It is owned and operated by 
the Dingmans Choice and Delaware Bridge Company which has operated bridges 
here since 1836.[140]:p.93–102[141] The bridge connects the village of 
Dingmans in Delaware Township in Pike County, Pennsylvania and State Route 
2019 with County Route 560 and the Old Mine Road in Sandyston Township, 
New Jersey. As of 2012[update], Sussex County's sole operating railroad 
line is dedicated to freight service in Sparta, Vernon and Hardyston townships. 
It is operated by the New York, Susquehanna & Western railroad and CSX 
Transportation.[142] Commuter rail service has not been offered in the 
county since the 1960s.[143] However, commuter rail service is available 
from nearby stations along New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex Lines 
in Hackettstown, Mount Olive, Netcong, Lake Hopatcong, Mount Arlington 
and Dover, which are easily accessible to Sussex County residents by driving 
or through bus services contracted by New Jersey Transit.[144] This line 
was part of the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad system.[145][page needed] 
Service is available directly to Hoboken Terminal or via the Kearny Connection 
(opened in 1996) to Secaucus Junction and Pennsylvania Station in Midtown 
Manhattan.[144] Passengers can transfer at Newark Broad Street Station 
or Summit to reach either New York or Hoboken.[144] New Jersey Transit 
is planning to re-open commuter service through the Lackawanna Cut-Off 
route which passes through Andover and Green Townships in the southern 
part of the county. Service from a planned station in Andover into New 
York City and Hoboken is scheduled to begin in 2016.[146] The portion of 
the Cut-Off route west of Andover heading toward Scranton, Pennsylvania 
has not been funded or scheduled.[146] NJ Transit in partnership with the 
county government offers bus service in Sussex County, limited to weekday 
service on the "Skylands Connect" route.[147] The county government's Office 
of Transit also operates a ParaTransit bus service on weekdays to local 
senior citizens, veterans, people with disabilities, and the general public. 
It offers service within the county for local errands (nutrition, medical 
appointments, shopping, hairdresser appointments, banking, community services, 
education/training, and employment) and outside the county for non-emergency 
medical appointments (dialysis, therapy, radiation treatment, mental health, 
specialized hospitals, and Veterans facilities).[148] Lakeland Bus Lines, 
a privately operated commuter bus company based in Dover, in Morris County 
offers service under contract with New Jersey Transit between Newton and 
Sparta to New York City's Midtown Port Authority Bus Terminal.[135][149][150] 
There are four general aviation public-use airports in Sussex County that 
cater to recreational pilots. They include: Before 1942, Sussex County 
had over 100 school districts. Most of these districts were in rural townships 
that each had several districts—each district operating a one-room schoolhouse 
that served their small neighborhoods. During the forty-year tenure (1903–1942) 
of County School Superintendent Ralph Decker, the local government began 
to consolidate these small districts into larger municipality-wide or regional 
school districts.[157] The public school system in Sussex County offers 
a "thorough and efficient" education for children between the ages of five 
and eighteen years (grades K–12), as required by state constitution,[158] 
through nine local and regional public high school districts, and twenty 
public primary or elementary school districts. Because of its distance 
from other county high schools and the higher costs of busing students 
one of those locations, Montague Township (the northernmost municipality 
in the state) sends most of its middle school (grades 7–8) and high school 
students (grades 9–12) to Port Jervis, New York for schooling. However, 
in 2013, Montague began exploring alternatives that would involve keeping 
their students in-state by sending them to High Point Regional High School 
in neighboring Wantage Township. Several of the county's schools are highly 
ranked by both state and federal education departments; some of which have 
achieved the U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon School Award.[159] 
The county's Board of Chosen Freeholders oversees the Sussex County Technical 
School (formerly the Sussex County Vocational-Technical School), a county-wide 
technical high school in Sparta Township.[160] Pope John XXIII Regional 
High School in Sparta operates under the auspices of the Roman Catholic 
Diocese of Paterson, which also operates the three K-8 schools in the county: 
Immaculate Conception in Franklin, St. Joseph in Newton and Rev. George 
A. Brown in Sparta.[161] There are several other private schools in the 
county. Sussex County's 10 high schools compete in interscholastic sports 
and other athletic activities sanctioned by the New Jersey State Interscholastic 
Athletic Association (NJSIAA). In 2009, the NJSIAA reorganized statewide 
athletic leagues into regional conferences.[162] Prior to this reorganization, 
these schools competed under the auspices of the Sussex County Interscholastic 
League (SCIL), a now-defunct county-wide conference affiliated with NJSIAA.[163] 
SCIL and other Morris and Warren County high schools compete under the 
NJSIAA's Northwest Jersey Athletic Conference.[164] Sussex County Community 
College (commonly referred to as SCCC) is an accredited, co-educational, 
two-year, public, community college located on a 167-acre (68 ha) campus 
in Newton. The SCCC campus was the site of Don Bosco College, a Roman Catholic 
seminary operated by the Salesian Order from 1928 until it was closed in 
the early 1980s and its campus sold to the Sussex County government on 
22 June 1989 for US$4,209,800.[165][166] SCCC was authorized as a "college 
commission" in 1981 and began operations the following year. It became 
fully accredited in 1993 by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle 
States Association of Colleges and Schools.[167][168] SCCC offers 40 associate 
degree and 16 post-secondary professional and health science certificate 
programs available both at traditional classes at its campus, through hybrid 
and online classes, and through distance learning.[168][169][170] Many 
students who attend SCCC transfer to pursue the completion of their undergraduate 
college education at a four-year college or university.[169][171] The college 
also offers programs for advanced high school students, community education 
courses, and programs in cooperation with the New Jersey Department of 
Labor and Workforce Development.[172] As of 2012[update], SCCC reported 
an enrollment of 3,403 students of which 56% attend full-time and 44% attended 
part-time.[167] Before it closed in 1995, Upsala College, a Lutheran-affiliated 
college in East Orange, New Jersey, operated a 245-acre (99 ha) satellite 
campus in Wantage Township which it named the "Wirth Campus." In 1978, 
the land known as "Twin Ponds Farm" had been donated by Wallace "Wally" 
Wirths (1921–2002), a former Westinghouse Corporation executive, author, 
local newspaper columnist and radio commentator.[173][174][175] The school 
had considered moving to Sussex County as East Orange's crime problem and 
social conditions deteriorated in the 1970s. However, declining enrollment 
and financial difficulties forced the school to close.[176][177] The Wirths 
family bought back the farm for $75,000.[175][178] Sussex County is part 
of the Skylands Region, a term promoted by the New Jersey Commerce, Economic 
Growth, & Tourism Commission to encourage regional tourism. New Jersey 
ranks fifth in the nation in revenues generated from tourism. Local dairy 
farmers have had to adapt to a declining milk and dairy industry and reacclimate 
to changing economic conditions by seeking new sources of revenue.[83] 
Combining their agricultural production while promoting tourism, "Agritourism" 
has created opportunities for farmers. Many Sussex County farms offer corn 
field mazes, "u-pick" or "pick your own" fruits and vegetables—especially 
for apples, strawberries, pumpkins and Christmas trees during their respective 
harvest seasons.[179] New Jersey's wine industry has benefited from the 
recent easing of state alcohol licensing laws and from new promotional 
and marketing programs offered by the state's Department of Agriculture. 
Of the state's 46 licensed wineries, Sussex County is home to three: Cava 
Winery & Vineyard in Hamburg, Ventimiglia Vineyard in Wantage Township, 
and Westfall Winery in Montague Township.[87] The Sussex County Farm and 
Horse Show which has operated since 1918 is now the New Jersey State Fair. 
There are nine wildlife management areas located in Sussex County for hunting, 
fishing, trapping, hiking, snowshoeing and cross country skiing, covering 
more than 15,000 acres (6,100 ha). There are also several state forests 
and state parks. In the 1960s, Vernon Township became a location for skiing 
and winter sports. Sussex County has one large venue for professional sports, 
Skylands Stadium, a 4,200-seat baseball stadium located in the Augusta 
section of Frankford Township near the intersection of U.S. Route 206, 
New Jersey Route 15, and County Route 565.[180] While it was home to two 
minor league baseball teams and one semi-professional football team, and 
briefly hosted other franchises, it has been vacant for several years. 
In 2013, Skylands Park was acquired by investor Mark Roscioli Jr., of 17 
Mile, LLC for $950,000.[181] Roscioli who admits a lack of experience in 
sports management, was negotiating to bring a baseball team to the park 
but sold the facility to an unknown buyer.[180][182] With the rise of professional 
Minor League Baseball in the 1990s, Sussex County became the home to the 
New Jersey Cardinals, a Class A-Short Season affiliate of Major League 
Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals franchise in 1994. The Cardinals, previously 
the Glens Falls Redbirds (1981–93) from upstate New York, won the New York–Penn 
League's championship in their 1994 inaugural season. They had one other 
winning season (in 2002) and in 2005 the owners sold the team—which was 
then moved to University Park, Pennsylvania and renamed the State College 
Spikes.[183] They are now affiliated with MLB's Pittsburgh Pirates franchise.[184] 
In 2006, Skylands Park became the home of the Sussex Skyhawks an affiliate 
of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball (or Can-Am 
League). The team were League Champions during the 2008 season. The team 
ceased operations after the 2010 season.[185] Coordinates: 41°08′N 74°41′W﻿
