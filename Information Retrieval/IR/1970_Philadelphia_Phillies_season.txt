The 1970 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 88th season for the franchise 
in Philadelphia. The Phillies finished in fifth place in the National League 
East with a record of 73-88, 15 1⁄2 games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
The Phillies were playing their final season of home games at Connie Mack 
Stadium, before moving into their new facility, Veterans Stadium, at the 
start of the following season. In June 1970, a series of injuries left 
the Phillies short a catcher and they activated Doc Edwards, who at the 
time was their bullpen coach. Edwards responded with two hits in his first 
game back and then caught a Jim Bunning–Dick Selma two-hitter.[5] Infielders
