Todd Barton Jones (born April 24, 1968 in Marietta, Georgia) is a former 
Major League Baseball relief pitcher. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. 
He was an effective middle reliever for a variety of teams, and he had 
an up-and-down career as a closer.[citation needed] On September 16, 2007, 
Jones became the 21st member of the 300-save club and later ended his career 
as the Detroit Tigers' all-time leader in saves. Jones graduated from Osborne 
High School in Marietta, Georgia and attended Jacksonville State University 
in Alabama. He was drafted by the Houston Astros in the first round of 
1989 Major League Baseball draft and made his major league debut during 
the 1993 season. Initially used mainly as a setup man, Jones soon became 
a closer for the Astros. His best years came with the Detroit Tigers from 
1997–2001, when he logged 142 saves. On April 22, 1999, Jones earned career 
save number 100.[1] On September 27, 1999, Jones threw the last official 
pitch at Tiger Stadium, striking out Carlos Beltrán as the Tigers defeated 
the Kansas City Royals 8–2.[2][3] While playing for the Colorado Rockies 
in April 2003, Jones made remarks criticized as anti-gay comments during 
a discussion of the play Take Me Out. Jones publicly apologized, but did 
not retract his comments.[4] Jones signed a one-year contract with the 
Florida Marlins during the 2004 offseason. After an injury to incumbent 
closer Guillermo Mota, Jones took on the role for the first time since 
being traded to the Minnesota Twins in 2001. He finished the 2005 season 
with a 2.10 ERA and 40 saves. On December 8, 2005, Jones signed a two-year 
contract to return to the Tigers. In 2006, he also participated in the 
inaugural World Baseball Classic. Jones was a finesse pitcher and showed 
good durability. He threw a low-90s fastball as his main pitch, usually 
aiming for contact. In every year from the strike-shortened 1994 season 
to 2007, he pitched in at least 51 games. On May 21, 2006, he became the 
Detroit Tigers' all-time leader in saves, passing Mike Henneman.[5] On 
July 27, 2008, Jones lost the closer role to Fernando Rodney. On September 
25, 2008, Jones announced his retirement from Major League Baseball.[6] 
Jones is a devout Christian, and is known for using Contemporary Christian 
music when entering from the bullpen. During the 2006 playoffs, he entered 
to "Last One Standing" by MercyMe.[7] Since 2002, Jones has been writing 
a weekly column, "The Closer", for The Sporting News and Jones was on the 
cover of the baseball preview issue with the caption "Don't Tell columnist 
Todd Jones but (Beware of The Tigers)". Jones currently resides in Pell 
City, Alabama with his wife Michelle and his son Alex (born October 7, 
1994) and daughter Abby (born May 22, 1997). He currently works as an adviser 
for the local high school and middle school boys baseball teams. Italics
