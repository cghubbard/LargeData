As Player As Manager Samuel E. Barkley (May 24, 1858 – April 20, 1912) 
was an American Major League Baseball second baseman. Born in Wheeling, 
West Virginia, he played for four different teams in six seasons from 1884 
to 1889.[1] Barkley began his career with the Toledo Blue Stockings of 
the Northwestern League, and was a member of their championship team in 
1883.[2] He was still with the team when they joined the American Association 
for the 1884 season, and was the everyday second baseman. He batted .306 
that season and led the league in doubles with 39.[1] Following the season, 
Toledo and the St. Louis Browns made an arrangement in the off-season for 
a trade involving several players, but the trade broke down after the waiting 
period and only Barkley and one other player actually played with St. Louis. 
After a lawsuit it was estimated that Barkley had been valued for $800. 
Chris von der Ahe later claimed that Barkley's value was $1,000, but that 
may have been the asking price. In March 1886, Browns owner Chris von der 
Ahe offered Barkley for $1000 to the first team to pay the money. Billy 
Barnie was able to have Barkley sign an undated contract with the Baltimore 
Orioles and wired the asking price to Von der Ahe, but he had already secured 
a deal with owner of the Pittsburg Alleghenys, Denny McKnight, and Sam 
was convinced to play for the Allegheny club instead. The American Association 
suspended and fined Barkley for signing with Pittsburgh this action. Barkley 
sued the Association, but they settled out of court with suspension being 
lifted although the fine stayed in place. Baltimore was offered and accepted 
Milt Scott as payment.[3] That first season with Pittsburgh, the 1886 season, 
he hit .266 with 31 doubles, and he also stole 22 bases, while playing 
in 122 games. He stats declined significantly in 1887, only playing in 
89 games, hitting only .224. After the season was over, Pittsburgh sold 
him to the Kansas City Cowboys of the American Association.[1] He was given 
good playing time in 1888 by the Cowboys, playing in 116 games, but his 
batting average slid further down, to .216,[1] but the season was not uneventful. 
On June 13, he hit for the cycle,[4] and he was given the managerial reins, 
which lasted 58 games and 21 wins.[1] After his career in baseball ended, 
Barkley became a cigar maker.[5] He died at the age of 53 in his hometown
