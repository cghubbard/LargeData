Thomas Michael "Mike" Shannon (born July 15, 1939) is an American former 
Major League Baseball player and current radio sportscaster. Shannon is 
a radio broadcaster for the St. Louis Cardinals. He was raised in St. Louis, 
Missouri and played with the Cardinals during some of the team's most successful 
years. Shannon was the proprietor of Mike Shannon's Steaks and Seafood 
in downtown St. Louis until the restaurant closed January 30, 2016. He 
still has Mike Shannon's Grill in Edwardsville, IL and at Lambert St. Louis 
Airport[1] Shannon was born and raised in south St. Louis at 7045 Winona 
Avenue. Mike was the 2nd oldest of six children of Thomas A. Shannon and 
Elizabeth W. Richason Shannon. Shannon's father was a St. Louis police 
officer and after getting his law degree, worked in the Prosecuting Attorney's 
office before becoming the Prosecuting Attorney for the City of St. Louis 
in the early 1970s. Mike attended grade school at Epiphany of Our Lord 
Catholic School, and graduated from Christian Brothers College High School 
in 1957. While at CBC Mike was the Missouri High School Player of the Year 
in both football and basketball his senior year. He is the only athlete 
to win both awards in the same year. He attended the University of Missouri 
before leaving in 1958 to begin his professional baseball career after 
signing with Bing Devine, GM of the St. Louis Cardinals. Shannon has commented 
that if football players were paid better during his era, he probably would 
have stayed at Missouri and sought a professional football career. He believed 
himself a better football player, and his former coach, Frank Broyles, 
commented that had he stayed in school, Shannon might have won the Heisman 
Trophy.[2] Shannon began his big-league career with the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1962. In 1964, he became the team's regular right fielder, shifting 
to third base (in order to make room for the newly acquired Roger Maris) 
in 1967. Shannon played in three World Series for the Cardinals. He hit 
a game-tying two-run homer off Whitey Ford in the Game 1 of the 1964 World 
Series against the New York Yankees, which St. Louis won 9-5. One of his 
best years came in 1966 when he batted .288 in 137 games, with 16 home 
runs and 64 RBI. He was named NL Player of the Month in July (.395, 7 HR, 
23 RBI). He posted another excellent season in 1968, when he batted .266 
in 156 games, with 15 home runs and 79 RBI; these numbers would in most 
seasons be considered average at best, but in the "Year of the Pitcher," 
such stats were enough to earn him 7th place in MVP voting, behind teammates 
Bob Gibson, Curt Flood, and Lou Brock, as well as Giants Willie McCovey 
and Juan Marichal, and Pete Rose of the Reds. In Game 3 of the 1967 World 
Series against the Boston Red Sox, Shannon hit a key home run off Gary 
Bell. In Game 7 of the 1968 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Shannon's 
solo home run off Mickey Lolich was the Cardinals' only run off Lolich 
as the Tigers clinched. Shannon also hit the last home run in the original 
Busch Stadium (Sportsman's Park) in 1966 and the first one for the Cardinals 
in the second Busch Stadium (Busch Memorial Stadium). In 1970, he contracted 
nephritis, a kidney disease, which ended his playing career. Shannon joined 
the Cardinals' promotional staff in 1971; a year later he moved to the 
team's radio booth. For almost three decades Shannon was paired with Hall 
of Fame announcer Jack Buck on AM 1120 KMOX and the Cardinals Radio Network. 
Following Buck's death in 2002, he was named the team's lead radio voice, 
teaming with Joel Meyers (2002), Wayne Hagin (2003–2005), and John Rooney 
(2006–present). In 2006, he moved to AM 550 KTRS which had won broadcasting 
rights for the Cardinals. For the 2011 season KMOX regained the rights 
for Cardinals broadcasting and Shannon returned to his former employer. 
Shannon received a local Emmy Award for his work on Cardinal broadcasts 
in 1985, and was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.[3] 
He was named Missouri Sportscaster of the Year in 2002 and 2003.[4] On 
Saturday nights after a Cardinals home game, Shannon traditionally hosts 
a sports chat show from his restaurant, which is one block north from Busch 
Stadium. Shannon's signature home run call is "Here's a long one to left/center/right, 
get up baby, get up, get up...oh yeah!" During the 1980s, Shannon worked 
as a backup analyst (behind the main analysts, Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek) 
for NBC's Game of the Week telecasts (typically working with play-by-play 
man Jay Randolph). Counting his tenure in the minor leagues, Shannon has 
spent 55 years—nearly his entire adult life—with the Cardinals in some 
capacity. He has also called Cardinals games longer than anyone except 
Buck. On August 8, 2014 Shannon was inducted into the St.Louis Cardinals 
Hall of Fame. As of the 2016 season, Shannon only calls home games for
