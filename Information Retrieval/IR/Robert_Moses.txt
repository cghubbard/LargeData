Robert Moses (December 18, 1888 – July 29, 1981) was a city planner who 
worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the "master builder" 
of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, Rockland County, and Westchester 
County, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, 
and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of urban planning 
in the United States. His decisions favoring highways over public transit 
helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island and influenced a generation 
of engineers, architects, and urban planners who spread his philosophies 
across the nation. One of his major contributions to urban planning was 
New York State's large parkway network. Robert Moses simultaneously held 
twelve titles (including NYC Parks Commissioner and Chairman of the Long 
Island State Park Commission), but was never elected to any public office 
(he ran only once, for governor of New York as a Republican in 1934 and 
lost to Herbert H. Lehman). Nevertheless, he created and led numerous public 
authorities that gave him autonomy from the general public and elected 
officials. Through these authorities, he controlled millions of dollars 
in income from his projects, such as tolls, and he could issue bonds to 
borrow vast sums for new ventures with little or no input from legislative 
bodies, allowing him to circumvent the power of the purse as it normally 
functioned in the United States, and the process of public comment on major 
public works. As a result of Moses' work, New York has the United States' 
greatest proportion of public benefit corporations, which are the prime 
mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York and account 
for most of the state's debt. Moses' projects were considered by many to 
be necessary for the region's development after the Great Depression. During 
the height of his powers, New York City built campuses to host two World's 
Fairs: one in 1939 and the other in 1964. Moses also helped persuade the 
United Nations to locate its headquarters in Manhattan, instead of Philadelphia, 
by helping the state secure the money and land needed for the project. 
Moses was born to assimilated German Jewish parents in New Haven, Connecticut. 
He spent the first nine years of his life living at 83 Dwight Street in 
New Haven, two blocks from Yale University. In 1897, the Moses family moved 
to New York City,[3] where they lived on East 46th Street off Fifth Avenue.[4] 
Moses's father was a successful department store owner and real estate 
speculator in New Haven. In order for the family to move to New York City, 
he sold his real estate holdings and store and retired from business for 
the rest of his life.[3] Bella, Moses's mother, was active in the settlement 
movement, with her own love of building. Robert Moses and his brother Paul 
attended several schools for their elementary and secondary education, 
including the Dwight School and the Mohegan Lake School, a military academy 
near Peekskill.[5] After graduating from Yale University (B.A., 1909) and 
Wadham College, Oxford (B.A., Jurisprudence, 1911; M.A., 1913), and earning 
a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University, Moses became attracted 
to New York City reform politics. A committed idealist, he developed several 
plans to rid New York of patronage hiring practices, including being the 
lead author of a 1919 proposal to reorganize the New York state government. 
None went very far, but Moses, due to his intelligence, caught the notice 
of Belle Moskowitz, a friend and trusted advisor to Al Smith.[6] When the 
state Secretary of State's position became appointive rather than elective, 
Smith named Moses; Moses served from 1927 to 1929.[7] Moses rose to power 
with Smith, who was elected as governor in 1922, and set in motion a sweeping 
consolidation of the New York State government. During that period Moses 
began his first foray into large scale public work initiatives, while drawing 
on Smith's political power to enact legislation. This helped create the 
new Long Island State Park Commission and the State Council of Parks.[8] 
This centralization allowed Smith to run a government later used as a model 
for Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal federal government. Moses also received 
numerous commissions that he carried out extraordinarily well, such as 
the development of Jones Beach State Park. Displaying a strong command 
of law as well as matters of engineering, Moses became known for his skill 
in drafting legislation, and was called "the best bill drafter in Albany".[9] 
At a time when the public was accustomed to Tammany Hall corruption and 
incompetence, Moses was seen as a savior of government.[6] Shortly after 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's inauguration in 1933, the federal government 
found itself with millions of New Deal dollars to spend, yet states and 
cities had few projects ready. Moses was one of the few local officials 
who had projects shovel ready. For that reason, New York City was able 
to obtain significant Works Progress Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation 
Corps (CCC), and other Depression-era funding. Moses was a great political 
talent who demonstrated great skill when constructing his roads, bridges, 
playground, parks, and house projects.[10] During the 1920s, Moses sparred 
with Franklin D. Roosevelt, then head of the Taconic State Park Commission, 
who favored the prompt construction of a parkway through the Hudson Valley. 
Moses succeeded in diverting funds to his Long Island parkway projects 
(the Northern State Parkway, the Southern State Parkway and the Wantagh 
State Parkway), although the Taconic State Parkway was later completed 
as well.[11] Robert Moses helped build Long Island's Meadowbrook Parkway. 
It was the first fully divided limited access highway in the world.[10] 
During the Depression, Moses, along with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, 
was responsible for the construction of ten gigantic swimming pools under 
the WPA Program. Combined, they could accommodate 66,000 swimmers.[12][13] 
One such pool is McCarren Park Pool in Brooklyn, which was formerly dry 
and used only for special cultural events but has since reopened to the 
public.[14] Although Moses had power over the construction of all New York 
City Housing Authority public housing projects and headed many other entities, 
it was his chairmanship of the Triborough Bridge Authority which gave him 
the most power.[6] The Triborough Bridge (now officially the Robert F. 
Kennedy Memorial Bridge) opened in 1936, connecting the Bronx, Manhattan, 
and Queens via three separate spans. Language in its Authority's bond contracts 
and multi-year Commissioner appointments made it largely impervious to 
pressure from mayors and governors. While New York City and New York State 
were perpetually strapped for money, the bridge's toll revenues amounted 
to tens of millions of dollars a year. The Authority was thus able to raise 
hundreds of millions of dollars by selling bonds, a method also used by 
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey[15] to fund large public 
construction projects. Toll revenues rose quickly as traffic on the bridges 
exceeded all projections. Rather than pay off the bonds, Moses used the 
revenue to build other toll projects, a cycle that would feed on itself.[16] 
In the late 1930s a municipal controversy raged over whether an additional 
vehicular link between Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan should be built as 
a bridge or a tunnel. Bridges can be wider and cheaper to build, but taller 
and longer bridges use more ramp space at landfall than tunnels do.[6] 
A "Brooklyn Battery Bridge" would have decimated Battery Park and physically 
encroached on the financial district, and for this reason, the bridge was 
opposed by the Regional Plan Association; historical preservationists; 
Wall Street financial interests; property owners; various high society 
people, construction unions; the Manhattan borough president; Mayor Fiorello 
LaGuardia; and governor Herbert H. Lehman.[6] Despite this, Moses favored 
a bridge, which could both carry more automobile traffic and serve as a 
higher visibility monument than a tunnel. More traffic meant more tolls, 
which to Moses meant more money for public improvements.[6] LaGuardia and 
Lehman as usual had little money to spend, in part due to the Great Depression, 
while the federal government was running low on funds after recently spending 
$105 million ($1.8 billion in 2016) on the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and other 
City projects and refused to provide any additional funds to New York.[17] 
Awash in funds from Triborough Bridge tolls, Moses deemed that money could 
only be spent on a bridge. He also clashed with chief engineer of the project, 
Ole Singstad, who preferred a tunnel instead of a bridge.[6] Only a lack 
of a key federal approval thwarted the bridge project. President Roosevelt 
ordered the War Department to assert that bombing a bridge in that location 
would block East River access to the Brooklyn Navy Yard upstream. Thwarted, 
Moses dismantled the New York Aquarium on Castle Clinton and moved it to 
Coney Island in Brooklyn, where it grew much bigger. This was in apparent 
retaliation, based on specious claims that the proposed tunnel would undermine 
Castle Clinton's foundation. He also attempted to raze Castle Clinton itself, 
the historic fort surviving only after being transferred to the federal 
government.[6] Moses now had no other option for a trans-river crossing 
than to build a tunnel. He commissioned the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel (now 
officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel), a tunnel connecting Brooklyn to Lower 
Manhattan. A 1941 publication from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority 
claimed that the government had forced them to build a tunnel at "twice 
the cost, twice the operating fees, twice the difficulty to engineer, and 
half the traffic," although engineering studies did not support these conclusions, 
and a tunnel may have held many of the advantages Moses publicly tried 
to attach to the bridge option.[6] This had not been the first time Moses 
pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel 
Authority when the Queens-Midtown Tunnel was being planned.[18] He had 
raised the same arguments, which failed due to their lack of political 
support.[18] Moses's power increased after World War II after Mayor LaGuardia 
retired and a series of successors consented to almost all of his proposals. 
Named city "construction coordinator" in 1946 by Mayor William O'Dwyer, 
Moses became New York City's de facto representative in Washington, D.C.. 
Moses was also given powers over public housing that had eluded him under 
LaGuardia. When O'Dwyer was forced to resign in disgrace and was succeeded 
by Vincent R. Impellitteri, Moses was able to assume even greater behind-the-scenes 
control over infrastructure projects.[6] One of Moses's first steps after 
Impellitteri took office was halting the creation of a city-wide Comprehensive 
Zoning Plan underway since 1938 that would have curtailed his nearly unlimited 
power to build within the city and removed the Zoning Commissioner from 
power in the process. Moses was also empowered as the sole authority to 
negotiate in Washington for New York City projects. By 1959, he had overseen 
construction of 28,000 apartment units on hundreds of acres of land. In 
clearing the land for high-rises in accordance with the towers in the park 
concept, which at that time was seen as innovative and beneficial by leaving 
more grassy areas between high-rises, Moses sometimes destroyed almost 
as many housing units as he built.[6] From the 1930s to the 1960s, Robert 
Moses was responsible for the construction of the Throgs Neck, the Bronx-Whitestone, 
the Henry Hudson, and the Verrazano–Narrows bridges. His other projects 
included the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Staten Island Expressway, which 
together comprised most of Interstate 278; the Cross-Bronx Expressway; 
many New York State parkways; and other highways. Federal interest had 
shifted from parkway to freeway systems, and the new roads mostly conformed 
to the new vision, lacking the landscaping or the commercial traffic restrictions 
of the pre-war highways. He was the mover behind Shea Stadium and Lincoln 
Center, and contributed to the United Nations headquarters.[6] Moses had 
influence outside the New York area as well. City planners in many smaller 
American cities hired him to design freeway networks in the 1940s and early 
1950s. For example, Portland, Oregon hired Moses in 1943; his plan included 
a loop around the city center, with spurs running through neighborhoods. 
Of this plan, only I-405, its links with I-5, and the Fremont Bridge were 
built.[19] Moses knew how to drive an automobile, but he did not have a 
valid driver's license.[20] Instead, he relied on limousines. Moses' view 
of the automobile harkened to the 1920s, when the car was seen as a vehicle 
more for pleasure than the business of life. Moses's highways in the first 
half of the 20th century were parkways—curving, landscaped "ribbon parks" 
that were intended to be pleasures to travel as well as "lungs for the 
city"—though the Post–World War II economic expansion and notion of the 
automotive city brought freeways, most notably in the form of the vast, 
federally funded Interstate Highway System network.[6] When Brooklyn Dodgers 
owner Walter O'Malley sought to replace the outdated and dilapidated Ebbets 
Field, he proposed to build a new stadium near the Long Island Rail Road 
on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue (next to the present-day 
Barclays Center, home of the NBA Brooklyn Nets and NHL New York Islanders). 
O'Malley urged Moses to help him secure the property through eminent domain, 
but the planner refused, having already decided to build a parking garage 
on the site. Moreover, O'Malley's proposal — to have the city acquire the 
property for several times as much as he had originally said he was willing 
to pay — was rejected by both pro- and anti-Moses officials, newspapers, 
and the public as an unacceptable government subsidy of a private business 
enterprise.[21] Moses envisioned New York's newest stadium being built 
in Queens' Flushing Meadows on the former (and as it turned out, future) 
site of the World's Fair, where it would eventually host all three of the 
city's major league teams of the day. O'Malley vehemently opposed this 
plan, citing the team's Brooklyn identity. Moses refused to budge, and 
after the 1957 season the Dodgers left for Los Angeles and the New York 
Giants left for San Francisco.[6] Moses was later able to build the 55,000-seat 
multi-purpose Shea Stadium on the site; construction ran from October 1961 
to its delayed completion in April 1964. The stadium attracted an expansion 
franchise: the New York Mets, who played at Shea until 2008, when the stadium 
was replaced by Citi Field and demolished. The New York Jets football team 
also played its home games at Shea from 1964 until 1983, after which the 
team moved its home games to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey.[22] 
Moses's reputation began to fade during the 1960s as public debate on urban 
planning began to focus on the virtues of intimate neighborhoods and smallness 
of scale. Around this time, Moses' political acumen began to fail him, 
as he unwisely picked several controversial political battles he could 
not possibly win. For example, his campaign against the free Shakespeare 
in the Park program received much negative publicity, and his effort to 
destroy a shaded playground in Central Park to make way for a parking lot 
for the expensive Tavern-on-the-Green restaurant earned him many enemies 
among the middle-class voters of the Upper West Side. The opposition reached 
a climax over the demolition of Pennsylvania Station, which many attributed 
to the "development scheme" mentality cultivated by Moses[23] even though 
it was the impoverished Pennsylvania Railroad that was actually responsible 
for the demolition.[24] This casual destruction of one of New York's greatest 
architectural landmarks helped prompt many city residents to turn against 
Moses's plans to build a Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have gone 
through Greenwich Village and what is now SoHo.[25] This plan and the Mid-Manhattan 
Expressway both failed politically. One of his most vocal critics during 
this time was the urban activist Jane Jacobs, whose book The Death and 
Life of Great American Cities was instrumental in turning opinion against 
Moses's plans; the city government rejected the expressway in 1964.[26] 
Moses's power was further eroded by his association with the 1964 New York 
World's Fair. His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this 
event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives 
and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses' repeated and forceful 
public denials of the fair's considerable financial difficulties in the 
face of evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental 
investigations, which found accounting irregularities.[16] In his organization 
of the fair, Moses's reputation was now undermined by the same personal 
character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for 
the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments 
of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned 
by the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), the worldwide body supervising 
such events, would be devastating to the success of the event.[27] Moses 
refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging 
ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations 
not to participate.[28] The United States had already staged the sanctioned 
Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962. According to the rules of the 
organization, no one nation could host more than one fair in a decade. 
The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet 
Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving 
their efforts for Expo 67 in Montreal. After the World's Fair debacle, 
New York City mayor John Lindsay, along with Governor Nelson Rockefeller, 
sought to direct toll revenues from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority's 
(TBTA) bridges and tunnels to cover deficits in the city's then financially 
ailing agencies, including the subway system. Moses opposed this idea and 
fought to prevent it.[24] Lindsay then removed Moses from his post as the 
city's chief advocate for federal highway money in Washington. The legislature's 
vote to fold the TBTA into the newly created Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority (MTA) could technically have led to a lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders, 
since the bond contracts were written into state law it was unconstitutional 
to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the 
right of approval over such actions. However, the largest holder of TBTA 
bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the Chase Manhattan Bank, 
headed then by David Rockefeller, the governor's brother. No suit was filed. 
Moses could have directed TBTA to go to court against the action, but having 
been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge 
the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses 
gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant 
to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out—the promised 
role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out 
of power.[22] Moses had thought he had convinced Nelson Rockefeller of 
the need for one last great bridge project, a span crossing Long Island 
Sound from Rye to Oyster Bay. Rockefeller did not press for the project 
in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban 
Republicans would hinder his re-election prospects. Ironically, a 1972 
study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally 
manageable, but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and 
in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge. In retrospect, NYCroads.com 
author Steve Anderson writes that leaving densely populated Long Island 
completely dependent on access through New York City may not have been 
an optimal policy decision.[29] Moses's image suffered a further blow in 
1974 with the publication of The Power Broker, a Pulitzer Prize–winning 
biography by Robert A. Caro. Caro's 1,200-page opus (edited from over 3,000 
pages long) severely tarnished Moses's reputation; essayist Phillip Lopate 
writes that "Moses's satanic reputation with the public can be traced, 
in the main, to ... Caro's magnificent biography".[30][6] For example, 
Caro describes Moses' lack of sensitivity in the construction of the Cross-Bronx 
Expressway, and how he disfavored public transit. Much of Moses's reputation 
today is attributable to Caro, whose book won both the Pulitzer Prize in 
Biography in 1975, the Francis Parkman Prize (which is awarded by the Society 
of American Historians), and was named one of the 100 greatest non-fiction 
books of the twentieth century by the Modern Library.[28][6] Caro's depiction 
of Moses's life gives him full credit for his early achievements, showing, 
for example, how he conceived and created Jones Beach and the New York 
State Park system, but also shows how Moses's desire for power came to 
be more important to him than his earlier dreams. Moses is blamed for having 
destroyed more than a score of neighborhoods by building 13 expressways 
across New York City and by building large urban renewal projects with 
little regard for the urban fabric or for human scale.[6] Yet the author 
is more neutral in his central premise: the city would have developed much 
differently without Moses. Other U.S. cities were doing the same thing 
as New York in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; Boston, San Francisco, and 
Seattle, for instance, each built highways straight through their downtown 
areas.[6] The New York City architectural intelligentsia of the 1940s and 
1950s, who largely believed in such prophets of the automobile as Le Corbusier 
and Mies van der Rohe, had supported Moses. Many other cities, like Newark, 
Chicago, and St. Louis, also built massive, unattractive public housing 
projects.[31][6] However, Caro also points out that Moses demonstrated 
racist tendencies.[32] He, along with other members of the New York city 
planning commission, vocally opposed allowing black war veterans to move 
into Stuyvesant Town, a Manhattan residential development complex created 
to house World War II veterans.[33][6] People had come to see Moses as 
a bully who disregarded public input, but until the publication of Caro's 
book, they had not known many details of his private life—for instance, 
that his brother Paul had spent much of his life in poverty. Paul, whom 
Caro interviewed shortly before the former's death, claimed Robert had 
exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert's 
favor shortly before her death.[6] Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms 
with their mother over a long period and she may have changed the will 
of her own accord, and implies that Robert's subsequent treatment of Paul 
may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.[6] During 
the last years of his life, Moses concentrated on his lifelong love of 
swimming and was an active member of the Colonie Hill Health Club. Moses 
died of heart disease on July 29, 1981, at the age of 92 at Good Samaritan 
Hospital in West Islip, New York. Moses was of Jewish origin and raised 
in a secularist manner inspired by the Ethical Culture movement of the 
late 19th century. He was a convert to Christianity[34] and was interred 
in a crypt in an outdoor community mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in The 
Bronx, New York City following services at St. Peter's by-the-Sea Episcopal 
Church in Bay Shore, New York. The bridges of Robert Moses are a hotly 
disputed topic in the social construction of technology. In Langdon Winner's 
essay Do Artifacts Have Politics?, Winner uses Moses' bridges to argue 
that artifacts do have politics. Citing a passage in The Power Broker in 
which a co-worker of Moses implies that he purposefully built 204 bridges 
on Long Island that were too low for buses or trucks to clear.[6] Winner 
argues that because poorer minorities were largely dependent on public 
transit, this is a testimony to Moses's racism. This allegation, however 
has since been disputed by Bernward Joerges in his essay Do Politics Have 
Artefacts?[35] On page 8 he writes that “at the time of the parkway building 
(beginning 1924), Long Island was already considerably well developed in 
terms of transport. The Manhattan-Long Island railway operated since 1877, 
and a rather dense system of ordinary roads was in place, parallel and 
across the parkways. The Long Island Expressway, a true Autobahn intended 
to relieve traffic congestion on the Island, was built by Moses alongside 
the Parkways.”[35] Hence the bridges would be utterly ineffective as a 
segregationist measure because “[i]n the USA, trucks, buses and other commercial 
vehicles were prohibited on all parkways. Moses did nothing different on 
Long Island from any parks commissioner in the country.”[35] While the 
overall impact of many of Moses's projects continues to be debated, their 
sheer scale across the urban landscape is indisputable. The peak of Moses's 
construction occurred during the economic duress of the Great Depression, 
and despite that era's woes, Moses's projects were completed in a timely 
fashion, and have been reliable public works since—which compares favorably 
to the contemporary delays New York City officials have had redeveloping 
the Ground Zero site of the former World Trade Center, or the technical 
snafus surrounding Boston's Big Dig project.[36] Three major exhibits in 
2007 prompted a reconsideration of his image among some intellectuals, 
as they acknowledged the magnitude of his achievements. According to Columbia 
University architectural historian Hilary Ballon and assorted colleagues, 
Moses deserves better. They argue that his legacy is more relevant than 
ever and that people take the parks, playgrounds and housing Moses built, 
now generally binding forces in those areas, for granted even if the old-style 
New York neighborhood was of no interest to Moses himself; moreover, were 
it not for Moses' public infrastructure and his resolve to carve out more 
space, New York might not have been able to recover from the blight and 
flight of the 1970s and '80s and become the economic magnet it is today.[37] 
"Every generation writes its own history," said Kenneth T. Jackson, a historian 
of New York City. "It could be that The Power Broker was a reflection of 
its time: New York was in trouble and had been in decline for 15 years. 
Now, for a whole host of reasons, New York is entering a new time, a time 
of optimism, growth and revival that hasn't been seen in half a century. 
And that causes us to look at our infrastructure,” said Jackson. “A lot 
of big projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses 
era without Moses," he added.[37] Politicians are also reconsidering the 
Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate 
transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography 
of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: "That's 
what we need today. A real commitment to get things done."[38] Various 
locations and roadways in New York State bear Moses's name. These include 
two state parks, Robert Moses State Park – Thousand Islands in Massena, 
New York and Robert Moses State Park – Long Island, and the Robert Moses 
Causeway on Long Island, the Robert Moses State Parkway in Niagara Falls, 
New York, and the Robert Moses Hydro-Electric Dam in Lewiston, New York. 
A hydro-electric power dam in Massena, New York also bears Moses' name. 
These supply much of New York City's power. Moses also has a school named 
after him in North Babylon, New York on Long Island; there is also a Robert 
Moses Playground in New York City. There are other signs of the surviving 
appreciation held for him by some circles of the public. A statue of Moses 
was erected next to the Village Hall in his long-time hometown, Babylon 
Village, New York, in 2003, as well as a bust on the Lincoln Center campus 
of Fordham University. During his tenure as chief of the state park system, 
the state's inventory of parks grew to nearly 2,600,000 acres (1,100,000 ha). 
By the time he left office, he had built 658 playgrounds in New York City 
alone, plus 416 miles (669 km) of parkways and 13 bridges.[39] However, 
the proportion of public benefit corporations is greater in New York than 
in any other U.S. state, making them the prime mode of infrastructure building 
and maintenance in New York and accounting for 90% of the state's debt.[40] 
Moses's critics claim that he preferred automobiles to people. They point 
out that he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, 
destroying traditional neighborhoods by building expressways through them. 
That contributed to the ruin of the South Bronx and the amusement parks 
of Coney Island, caused the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New 
York Giants Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of 
public transport due to disinvestment and neglect.[6] His building of expressways 
hindered the proposed expansion of the New York City Subway from the 1930s 
well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built 
served, at least to some extent, the purpose of the planned subway lines; 
the 1968 Program for Action, which was never completed, was hoped to counter 
this.[6] Some claim he precluded the use of public transit that would have 
allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he 
built, but close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African 
Americans from using pools in white neighborhoods by making the water too 
cold.[41][6] He was also criticized in "The Power Broker" for starting 
large projects well beyond funding approved by the New York State legislature 
with the knowledge they would eventually pay for the rest to avoid looking 
like they didn't review the project properly (a tactic known as fait accompli) 
and for using political power to benefit cronies including a case where 
he secretly shifted the Northern State Parkway large distances to avoid 
impinging on the estates of the rich, while telling owners of the family 
farms who lost land (and sometimes their livelihood) that it was based 
on "engineering considerations."[6] In that book, other criticisms included 
that Moses lied about officials that opposed him to get them removed, for 
example by calling them communists during the Red Scare and that he fought 
against schools and other public needs in favor of his preference for parks.[6]
