Louis Brown Johnson (born September 22, 1932), nicknamed Sweet Lou, is 
a former Major League Baseball outfielder.[1] From 1962 through 1969, Johnson 
played for the 1962 Milwaukee Braves, was back in the minor league for 
'63 and '64, then played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1965â€“67), 1968 Chicago 
Cubs, 1968 Cleveland Indians, and the 1969 California Angels. Johnson both 
batted and threw right-handed. He is currently employed by the Dodgers 
Community Relations Department.[2] Johnson was born on September 22, 1932 
in Lexington, Kentucky to Sidney Bell & Shirley Johnson.[3] He has 3 brothers 
and 1 sister.[3] At Dunbar High School in Lexington,[3] he played both 
basketball as well as baseball. Johnson desired to play basketball at the 
University of Kentucky under the coach Adolph Rupp. However, at the time, 
members of the Southeastern Conference (of which Kentucky is an affiliate) 
were not recruiting black athletes. Some colleges did not even allow black 
students to enroll.[4] Johnson was signed by the New York Yankees as an 
amateur free agent in 1953. After moving around from team to team in the 
minor leagues for about a decade, he finally played in 61 games for the 
1962 Milwaukee Braves. However, after that, the Braves traded Johnson to 
the Detroit Tigers system, which sent him back to the minor leagues for 
the 1963 and '64 seasons. They then traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers 
for the pitcher Larry Sherry.[1] Johnson made it to the major leagues to 
stay for a stretch beginning in 1965 with the Dodgers when a broken ankle 
in early May sidelined Tommy Davis, their regular left fielder, for the 
remainder of the season.[5] Johnson filled in for Davis, playing in 130 
games for the Dodgers that season, scoring 57 runs and batting .260 with 
58 runs batted in. In that season, Johnson also scored the only run in 
Sandy Koufax's perfect game victory when he walked, went to second base 
on a sacrifice bunt, stole third base, and then scored on a throwing error 
by the Chicago Cubs catcher, Chris Krug. The Dodgers made it to the 1965 
World Series versus the Minnesota Twins, and in this Series, Johnson had 
eight hits, including two home runs, the second one being the game-winning 
one in the decisive seventh game. Johnson's high-water season in the major 
leagues was 1966. With Tommy Davis back in left field, and Willie Davis 
in center field, Johnson played mostly in right field. Frequently batting 
third in the order, right ahead of the dangerous hitter Tommy Davis, Johnson 
set career highs by playing in 152 games, getting 526 at-bats, 143 hits, 
17 home runs, scoring 71 runs, and batting in 73. Johnson's batting average 
that season was .272, and the Dodgers made it to the World Series once 
again.[1] This was also Koufax's last year in baseball before retiring 
because of his damaged and getting-worse left arm. In this World Series, 
against the Baltimore Orioles, the Dodgers' offense hit rock-bottom, with 
the teams getting shut out three times, and only scoring two runs in the 
four games. Johnson finished the series with four hits in 15 at-bats. He 
also flied out to Paul Blair for the final out of the Series.[1] From this 
point on, Johnson's major league career rapidly wound down, as he broke 
his leg sliding into Joe Torre and played in just 104 games for the Dodgers 
in 1967, a combined 127 for the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians 
in 1968, and just 67 for the California Angels in 1969, with only a .203 
batting average. In 1970, at the age of 35, Johnson was out of professional 
baseball for good. In his approximately four-year-long Major League career, 
Johnson posted a .258 overall average with 48 home runs and 232 RBI in
