Ray Lyle Fisher (October 4, 1887 – November 3, 1982) was an American professional 
baseball pitcher and college coach. He pitched all or part of ten seasons 
in Major League Baseball. His debut game took place on July 2, 1910. His 
final game took place on October 2, 1920. During his career he played for 
the New York Yankees and Cincinnati Reds. He coached the University of 
Michigan Wolverines baseball team from 1921 through 1958. Nicknamed "Pick" 
(short for the freshwater fish pickerel),[1] Fisher was an all-around athlete 
who played football, basketball, baseball, and competed in track events, 
though his father only permitted sports if the farm work was done. He played 
on Vermont's 1904 State Championship football team and was offered multiple 
college scholarships in football, but his real love was baseball and he 
stayed on in his hometown attending Middlebury College.[2] After stellar 
performances on the college mound,[3] he was offered a position pitching 
with a semi-pro team in Valleyfield, Quebec in the summer of 1907.[4] In 
1908 and 1909 he pitched in the minor leagues for Hartford in the Connecticut 
League, going 12–1 in his first partial season (batting .304) and 25–4 
the following year with 243 strikeouts.[5] Ray jumped at the first major 
league opportunity to come his way, thinking it might be the only offer 
he would get, and his contract was sold to the New York Highlanders (Yankees). 
He soon learned, however, that the New York Giants and Boston Red Sox were 
also interested in signing him. He reported to the Highlanders in 1910 
following his graduation from Middlebury, bringing along- to the amusement 
of his new teammates- his homemade bat from off the farm.[6] Dubbed the 
"Vermont Schoolmaster" because he taught Latin at Newton Academy in New 
Jersey during his first offseason,[7] Ray pitched for New York from 1910 
to 1917,[8][9] spending 1918 in the Army stationed at Fort Slocum off New 
Rochelle.[10] As a rookie, the newspapers were frequently comparing Fisher 
to Highlander's spitball pitcher Jack Chesbro,[11] and early in his tenure 
with the Yankees Fisher was also cited by Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie as one 
of the 12 best pitchers in the American League, both players also listing 
Ed Walsh, Russ Ford, Walter Johnson and Smoky Joe Wood.[12] His ERA ranked 
fifth in the league in 1915.[13][14] Fisher was known for his stamina as 
a pitcher, considered a "workhorse" for the Yankees,[15] but the following 
year, 1916, a bout of pleurisy was to cripple his effectiveness. (Doctors 
later thought that Fisher had probably had tuberculosis.)[16] From 1911 
to 1915, during the offseason, Fisher was also employed as Middlebury College's 
first "Physical Director".[17] In 1915 he was hired as athletic director 
at Sewanee:The University of the South,[18] in which capacity he would 
coach the baseball and basketball teams and assist the football team.[19] 
However, he had to soon resign due to the prolonged illness of his mother.[20] 
About the time of his discharge from the Army, Fisher was selected off 
waivers by the Cincinnati Reds, thereby taking a $3,100 cut in pay from 
his $6,600 with the Yankees.[21] The Yankees may have let Fisher go due 
to the effects of his pleurisy, but his year in the Army had actually given 
Ray time to build up his strength.[22] Pat Moran, Fisher's manager at Cincinnati 
noted that, "Fisher's speed is fine, his curves are all that could be desired. 
But, beyond all is his headwork. Fisher knows a lot of baseball, far more 
than the average pitcher."[23] Ray pitched for the Reds in 1919 and 1920. 
He went 14–5 in 1919 and pitched Game 3 in the infamous 1919 World Series, 
a game in which the Reds were shut out by Chicago's Dickie Kerr.[24][25][26] 
In the spring of 1920 the American and National Leagues agreed to outlaw 
use of the spitball, though 22 spitball pitchers were exempted from the 
ban for the season. The following year a permanent ban went into effect, 
with 17 pitchers "grandfathered" for the remainder of their pitching careers. 
Though he had largely discontinued use of the spitter by 1914,[27] Fisher 
was one of those allowed to continue to use the pitch.[28] Fisher is one 
of the few players to be re-instated into professional baseball after being 
banned for life.[29] Prior to the 1921 season, the Reds offered him a contract 
in which his salary was $1,000 less than that of the previous season.[30] 
After making his objections known in a letter to Reds president August 
Herrmann, Fisher signed the contract. Before the season began, however, 
Fisher learned that the position of head baseball coach had again become 
available at the University of Michigan, a position for which he had belatedly 
applied the previous year on the recommendation of Branch Rickey.[31] Fisher 
requested, and was apparently given by manager Pat Moran, permission to 
go and look into the job.[32] When he was offered the position at Michigan, 
the Reds' management tried to induce Fisher to remain with the team by 
offering to restore the $1,000 cut from the previous year's contract.[33] 
Fisher thought the Michigan position held greater long-term promise and 
accepted the job, believing that he would be given his release from Cincinnati 
or placed on the list of voluntarily retired players (both of which were 
subsequently reported in the local papers).[34][35] Part way into Michigan's 
playing season, other teams began contacting Fisher inquiring as to his 
availability to pitch and coach during the summer, Rickey's St. Louis Cardinals 
among them.[36] Fisher contacted the Reds for clarification on his status, 
noting that he realized they had first call on his services.[37] He learned 
that he was being placed on the list of those ineligible to play, the Reds 
citing his having given them only seven days notice, rather than the required 
ten, prior to leaving the club.[38] Fisher appealed to the commissioner 
of baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, and the commissioner promised to 
look into the matter.[39] After obtaining the Reds' version of the negotiations, 
the commissioner upheld the Reds' position and banned Fisher for leaving 
the team after having signed a contract.[40][41] Ray ended his major league 
career with a 100–94 record and a 2.82 ERA. His final game was pitched 
on October 2, 1920, and it was part of the only tripleheader played in 
the 20th century.[42] Following the determination of his ineligibility, 
Ray signed on with one of the "outlaw" teams, pitching only briefly for 
the Frankin, Pennsylvania, Oilers before the team folded.[43] About 1944, 
as part of a promotion for the Baseball Hall of Fame, Fisher received in 
the mail a silver lifetime pass to any major league ballpark in the country.[44] 
The pass was signed by the presidents of both leagues and was inscribed 
"To Ray Fisher in appreciation of long and meritorious service", which 
Ray interpreted to mean that his "blacklisting" had been lifted. This was 
his belief for nearly 35 years until he learned late in his life that the 
blacklisting was still officially on record with the Commissioner's office.[45] 
In 1951 Ray was called to Washington, D.C., to testify about his blacklisting 
in a House Judiciary Committee investigation into the alleged monopoly 
of power in professional baseball.[46][47] Fisher remained head baseball 
coach for the University of Michigan's baseball team for 38 seasons. His 
original agreement with Michigan also assigned him as an assistant basketball 
coach, a position he held through 1941, and as assistant football coach,[48] 
in which capacity he served through 1945. (In football he coached Gerald 
Ford and Tom Harmon.) While at Michigan, Fisher led his baseball teams 
to 15 Big Ten championships and the 1953 College World Series championship, 
after which he was named Coach of the Year.[49] In 1923, Ray became Michigan's 
first coach in the 20th century to integrate a varsity sport.[50] In 1929 
and 1932 Fisher's Michigan teams played against teams in Japan at the invitation 
of Meiji University.[51][52] Fisher was active in the startup of the National 
Association of College Baseball Coaches and served as its first vice president.[53] 
During the 1940s he was hailed by sports writers as "the Fielding Yost 
of the diamond"[54] and by Esquire Magazine as a close second to Jack Barry 
of Holy Cross as the top college baseball coach in the country.[55] Fisher 
was generally regarded as one of the nation's premiere instructors of college 
pitchers.[56] He was known both for his droll sense of humor and his potential 
for argumentativeness with umpires. The latter may have frequently been 
strategic;[57] in his later years at Michigan the press sometimes referred 
to him as "The Old Fox". While coaching summer teams in Vermont's Northern 
League,[58] Fisher mentored Robin Roberts (1946 and 1947) who sent many 
accolades in Fisher's direction once he was signed into the major leagues.[59] 
By the time he retired in 1958, Fisher had compiled a 636–295–8 record[60] 
(.600 or better in 32 of 38 seasons) with only two losing seasons, and 
he held the record as the University of Michigan's winningest coach for 
70 years (1930–2000).[61] For five years during the 1960s Fisher coached 
pitchers for the farm teams of the Milwaukee Braves and the Detroit Tigers, 
and into his 80's Ray was still working with pitchers at the request of 
subsequent University of Michigan baseball coaches.[62] After a reinvestigation 
into the circumstances surrounding his leaving the Cincinnati Reds,[63] 
in 1980 Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn declared Fisher a "retired 
player in good standing" with professional baseball, nearly 60 years after 
Landis's declaration of ineligibility.[64] In an interesting twist of fate, 
following the 1981 Major League Baseball strike the Cincinnati Reds came 
to the University of Michigan for workouts at Ray Fisher Stadium where 
they met the 93-year-old former Reds pitcher.[65] In the summer of 1982, 
Fisher was invited to the yearly Old-Timers' Day[66] at Yankee Stadium, 
his first visit to the famous facility which had been built after he'd 
left the team. Approaching age 95, he was then the oldest former Yankee, 
Cincinnati Red and World Series player.[67] He received two standing ovations 
from the fans, second only to Joe DiMaggio,[68] and threw out the opening 
pitch for that day's Yankees-Rangers game.[69] He died three months later 
in Ann Arbor, Michigan and is buried in Washtenong Memorial Park.[70] Among 
his honors, Ray was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1959), 
the American Association of College Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame (1966), 
the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor (1979), the Vermont Sports 
Hall of Fame (2013), and the Middlebury Athletics Hall of Fame (2014).[71] 
Ray's uniform number has been retired by the Michigan Wolverines baseball 
team and by the Vermont Mountaineers. At least 19 of Fisher's Michigan 
players signed with a major league team.[72] On May 23, 1970, twelve years 
after Ray's retirement, the baseball stadium at U of M, until then unnamed, 
was dedicated as Ray Fisher Stadium.[73] Thirty-eight years later, on May 
2, 2008, a renovated Ray Fisher Stadium was incorporated into the university's 
new Wilpon Baseball and Softball Complex, Fred Wilpon having pitched for 
Michigan under Ray.[74][75] On 25 July 2003, through the efforts of the 
Vermont chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research, the State 
of Vermont placed an historic site marker near Ray Fisher's birthplace, 
at the intersection of U.S. Route 7 (Court Street) and Creek Road in Middlebury, 
Vermont.[76][77] Fisher's influence on pitchers was still being felt many 
years after his death. In the 2010 American League Championship Series, 
Texas Rangers pitcher Cliff Lee gave an amazing performance using a cut 
fastball taught to him by "Ace" Adams, who had learned the pitch from Fisher 
at Michigan after Ray's retirement.[78] Farber C, Farber R (2006). Spitballers:
