Atherton is an incorporated town in San Mateo County, California, United 
States. Its population was 7,159 as of 2013. In 1866, Atherton was known 
as Fair Oaks, and was a flag stop on the California Coast Line of the Southern 
Pacific Railroad between San Francisco and San Jose for the convenience 
of the owners of the large estates who lived north of Menlo Park. The entire 
area was called Menlo Park. It had been part of the Rancho de las Pulgas 
that had covered most of the area, which is now southern San Mateo County. 
There were several attempts to incorporate Fair Oaks, one in 1874 and another 
in 1911. In 1923, Menlo Park wished to incorporate its lands to include 
the Fair Oaks lands. During a meeting of the representatives of the two 
communities, it became clear to the Fair Oaks property owners that in order 
to maintain their community as a strictly residential area, they would 
have to incorporate separately. Both groups rushed to Sacramento but the 
Fair Oaks committee arrived first. It was at that time they realized that 
they could not keep the name Fair Oaks, as it was already the name of a 
town near Sacramento. It was decided to honor Faxon Dean Atherton who had 
been one of the first property owners in the south peninsula and name the 
Town for him. Atherton was incorporated on September 12, 1923. That same 
year, in 1923, the Menlo Polo Club was founded in Atherton.[10][11] Faxon 
D. Atherton, a native of Massachusetts, had spent several years in Chile 
and Hawaii as a trader in tallow, hides and merchandise. His friend and 
business associate, Thomas Lark had written to him "there is education 
available for your children and a dignity of living on landed estates down 
the San Francisco peninsula (that is) convenient and accessible." Atherton 
purchased 640 acres (2.6 km2) for ten dollars an acre ($2470/km²)in 1860. 
His home, "Valparaíso Park", was built several years later. It was simple 
in design and ample for his family of seven children. Because of the development 
of the railroad, other San Franciscans traveled south and established summer 
homes. Because the dirt roads were usually impassable in the winter, the 
families were only in residence from May through September. Thomas H. Selby 
purchased 420 acres (1.7 km2). A successful businessman, he served as mayor 
of San Francisco. His country estate was called "Almendral". John T. Doyle, 
an attorney, built a home off Middlefield Road, "Ringwood". James C. Flood 
purchased successive parcels and built an extravagant mansion, "Linden 
Towers".This is now Lindenwood. The Joseph A Donohoe estate was "Holmgrove" 
and is now the site of Menlo Atherton High School. James Thomas Watkins' 
home was "Fair Oaks" and after two moves, stands restored today on Alejandra 
Avenue. The government was established with Edward E. Eyre as the first 
mayor. In 1928, the residents voted to build a Town Hall, which stands 
today. The early residents wanted a Town that would be divided into large 
parcels and would not contain businesses. The author Gertrude Atherton, 
daughter-in-law to Faxon D. Atherton wrote in "The Californians", "Menlo 
Park (Atherton) has been cut up into country places for what might be termed 
the 'old families of San Francisco', the eight or ten families who owned 
the haughty precinct were as exclusive, as conservative, as any group of 
ancient country families in Europe." A few of the large land holdings were 
subdivided during the 1920s and 1930s, James Flood estate in 1938. In the 
1940s and 1950s over eighty subdivisions were recorded. With the minimum 
size of one acre (4,000 m²), the era of the large estates was over. Atherton 
is still a "plain of oaks". Native live oaks, white oaks, bays, redwoods, 
cedars, pines and other ornamental trees cover the six square miles (16 km²) 
of town. There are approximately 50 miles (80 km) of roads. The population 
is around 7500 with approximately 2500 households. Olive Holbrook-Palmer 
left Holbrook-Palmer Park, a 22-acre (89,000 m²) park, to the Town in 1958. 
It is an open, tree-covered park, which offers recreational programs and 
has facilities for functions. Atherton is located at 37°27′31″N 122°12′00″W﻿

the Atherton Arts Committee, the Atherton Tree Committee, the Friends of 
the Atherton Community Library, the Holbrook-Palmer Park Foundation, the 
Atherton Dames, the Police Task force, and the Atherton Civic Interest 
League. There are also home owners' associations. The Menlo Circus Club 
is a private club with stables and a riding ring located within the town. 
There are also several tracts of contemporary Eichler homes, most notably 
in the Lindenwood neighborhood.[13] Atherton's current land use goal is 
"To preserve the Town's character as a scenic, rural, thickly wooded residential 
area with abundant open space."[14] In the California State Legislature, 
Atherton is in the 13th Senate District, represented by Democrat Jerry 
Hill, and in the 24th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Rich Gordon.[15]
