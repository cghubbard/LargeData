Alvin Floyd Crowder (January 11, 1899 – April 3, 1972), nicknamed "General", 
was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played 
eleven seasons in the American League with the Washington Senators, the 
St. Louis Browns, and the Detroit Tigers. In 402 career games, Crowder 
pitched 2344.1 innings and posted a win-loss record of 167–115, with 150 
complete games, 16 shutouts, and a 4.12 earned run average (ERA). Born 
in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Crowder served almost three years in 
the army in World War I, including assignments in the Philippines and 11 
months with the American Expeditionary Force in Siberia.[1] However, he 
never reached the rank of "General." His nickname, "General" Crowder, came 
from General Enoch Crowder, who designed the World War I draft lottery 
in the United States.[2][1] Crowder learned to play baseball when he was 
a private in the Army. He had been shipped from Siberia to the Philippines 
and back again before a Pacific Coast League scout offered him a job.[3] 
Although he signed his first baseball contract in 1920, he did not play 
a full season until 1923 with the Winston-Salem Twins. He did not play 
in his first major league game until he was 27 in 1926. He won only 7 games 
in each of his first two seasons, but finished the 1928 season with a record 
of 21–5 for the Browns. His .808 win percentage was the best in the American 
League, and his 21 wins was 4th best in the league. Crowder won 20 games 
in three different seasons, including a 26–13 record in 1932, the most 
wins in the American League. In that same season, Crowder set the record, 
which he still holds, for the most innings pitched in a season without 
hitting a batter, with 327.[4] In 1933, Crowder won 24 games, again the 
most in the AL, helped the Senators win the pennant, pitched in the first 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and finished 7th in the American League 
Most Valuable Player voting. The Detroit Tigers selected Crowder off waivers 
on August 3, 1934. He went 5–1 for the Tigers down the stretch, helping 
them win their first pennant in 25 years. He faced the Yankees in two series 
late in the 1934 season, winning the opening game in both series. those 
two victories helped the Tigers pass the Yankees for the American League 
pennant. In the 1934 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, he lost 
Game 1 to Dizzy Dean. In 1935, he was 16–10 for the Tigers as the club 
won its second consecutive American League pennant. He pitched a complete 
game in Game 4 of the 1935 World Series for a 2–1 victory to help the Tigers 
win their first World Series championship. Crowder pitched in three World 
Series consecutively (1933–1935), posting a record of 1–2 with 3.81 ERA 
in 26 innings pitched. Crowder was also known as "Yankee Killer", for his 
success against the Yankees and Babe Ruth in particular.[5] In his career, 
Crowder had a 167–115 record with a 4.12 ERA. After his playing career 
ended, Crowder returned to Winston-Salem where he operated the Winston-Salem 
Twins during the late 1930s and early 1940s. In 1967, Crowder was named 
to North Carolina's Sports Hall of Fame. Crowder died in 1972 at age 73
