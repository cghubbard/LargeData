As player As manager Thomas Joseph Loftus (November 15, 1856 – April 16, 
1910) was a manager in the American Association, the National League, and 
the American League. His playing career began in 1877 with the St. Louis 
Brown Stockings of the National League, but he only played in nine career 
games in 1877 and 1883 as an outfielder. His first managerial job came 
in 1884 with the Milwaukee Brewers of the short-lived Union Association 
(it only lasted one year), in which he only managed 12 games (going 8–4). 
Loftus took over as manager of the Cleveland Spiders, then known as the 
Blues, partway through the 1888 season after Jimmy Williams resigned.[1] 
In 1890, he was hired to manage the Cincinnati Reds, who had recently made 
the jump from the American Association to the National League. He left 
the game after the 1891 season, but he came back to manage the Chicago 
Orphans and the Washington Senators, and in each of his managerial stops, 
he would have part ownership of the team. Loftus died in Dubuque, Iowa
