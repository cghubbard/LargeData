Troy Edward Glaus (/ˈɡlɔːs/; born August 3, 1976) is a former Major League 
Baseball first baseman and third baseman. Previously, Glaus played with 
the Anaheim Angels (1998–2004), Arizona Diamondbacks (2005), Toronto Blue 
Jays (2006–2007), St. Louis Cardinals (2008–2009), and the Atlanta Braves 
(2010). Glaus lettered in baseball while attending UCLA. He bats and throws 
right-handed. In thirteen seasons Glaus hit .254 with 320 home runs and 
950 RBI in 1537 games. In 19 postseason games, he hit .347 with nine home 
runs and 16 RBI. Glaus has been selected to four All-Star Games, three 
with the Angels and one with the Blue Jays. Glaus began his career with 
the Angels in 1998 and was installed as the team's starting third baseman 
in 1999. Glaus had a breakout season in 2000, becoming the all-time single 
season home run leader for third basemen in Angels history with 47 while 
leading third baseman in adjusted range factor (2.95) in 2000. Glaus participated 
in the 2001 MLB All-Star Game and posted his second consecutive 40 home 
run season with 41 on the year. In 2002, Glaus failed to reach the 40 home 
run club for the first time since the 1999 season, but he managed to hit 
thirty home runs in helping the Angels make the playoffs for the first 
time in 16 years. The Angels beat the San Francisco Giants in 7 games to 
win their first World Series title in team history. Glaus was a key member 
of the Angels' 2002 World Series championship team and was named the Most 
Valuable Player of that series. Glaus followed that up with another All-Star 
year in 2003. Glaus missed much of the 2004 season with a shoulder injury. 
2004 was the last year of his contract with the Angels. As an established 
veteran, he was in demand on the free agent market and able to field lucrative 
offers for long term contracts. Although Glaus had spent his entire career 
an Angel, and was a fan favorite, the team decided not to pursue Glaus' 
return. Amid concerns about Glaus' future health after his injury, the 
team decided to go with the much lower-priced alternative of turning the 
third base position over to young prospect Dallas McPherson, whom they 
felt had a good chance to soon become as productive as Glaus had been. 
Glaus ultimately signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks for US$45 million 
over four years. Glaus worked through his back problems in the 2005 season, 
with the Diamondbacks, by hitting 37 HRs (tops amongst 3Bs) with 97 RBIs. 
He also led the league in adjusted range factor (2.92), but his 24 errors 
tied him with David Wright for the most errors by a third baseman in the 
Major Leagues, and he had a Major League-low .946 fielding percentage at 
third. He was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in the off-season along with 
minor league shortstop Sergio Santos. The trade sent pitcher Miguel Batista 
and second baseman Orlando Hudson to the Diamondbacks. The Jays badly needed 
a power bat a year after letting go of Carlos Delgado, however the emergence 
of Hudson at second base gave the statistical advantage of this trade to 
the Diamondbacks.[1] Although Glaus was converted from shortstop to third 
base in the minors (and played 10 games at shortstop for the Angels), he 
started at shortstop for the Toronto Blue Jays against the Chicago White 
Sox on May 27, 2006 due to the demotion of shortstop Russ Adams. Glaus 
was not expected to do much fielding due to the fact the pitcher that day 
was known to induce many fly balls, instead of ground balls.[2] This defensive 
alignment didn't affect his hitting, collecting 2 hits with a home run. 
Since then, Glaus made several starts at shortstop, usually when Toronto 
was facing National League opponents at their home ballpark, where there 
is no DH. After hitting 38 home runs and 104 RBI in the 2006 season, Glaus 
earned a single 10th place vote for the 2006 American League MVP Award. 
In 2006, Glaus had the lowest zone rating of any Major League third baseman 
(.741). In 2007 Glaus's production was hampered all year by foot injuries 
and his production fell. On December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell 
Report.[3] Glaus was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for 
fellow third baseman Scott Rolen on January 14, 2008. This worked out well 
for the Cardinals, as Glaus did about as well as, or better than, his career 
rates in most offensive categories.[4] Furthermore, Glaus committed only 
7 errors in 146 games and led the league in error pct (.982) at 3B. On 
September 3, 2008, he hit his 300th career home run off Doug Davis of the 
Arizona Diamondbacks in the third inning. He underwent arthroscopic right 
shoulder surgery on January 21, 2009.[5] The Cardinals initially expected 
him to be ready around the start of 2009 season, but after a setback in 
his rehabilitation he was placed on the 15-day DL;[6] after another reassessment 
the Cardinals announced that they did not expect him to return until June 
2009.[7] On July 11, 2009 he was assigned to the Palm Beach Cardinals of 
the Florida State League on a rehabilitation assignment. He returned September 
2, against the Brewers in the bottom of the 6th inning. Following an injury-shortened 
2009 season with the St. Louis Cardinals, Glaus signed a one-year $1.75 
million contract with the Atlanta Braves, a deal that allows him to earn 
an additional $2.25 million in performance and roster bonuses. He became 
the starting first baseman in 2010. After a rough April in which he hit 
below the Mendoza Line, Glaus rebounded to become Player of the Month in 
May, hitting .330 with 6 home runs and 28 RBI. As of August 9, Glaus was 
hitting .242 with 14 home runs and 63 RBI. Glaus's production faltered 
in July and August. After Atlanta acquired Derrek Lee on August 18 to play 
1st base, Glaus was placed on the DL with knee fatigue. Glaus had a few 
setbacks, but returned to Atlanta in a back-up role behind Derrek Lee and 
rookie Freddie Freeman. Glaus made only one appearance at 3rd base during 
the regular season, but was used at 3rd in game 2 of the NLDS against the 
San Francisco Giants starting a key double play. Glaus then started game 
four of the series at 3rd. Glaus became a candidate for induction into 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum for the first time on November 
9, 2015.[8] He received no votes. Glaus resides in Ocala, Florida, with
