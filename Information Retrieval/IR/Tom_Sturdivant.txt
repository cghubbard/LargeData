Thomas Virgil Sturdivant II (April 28, 1930 – February 28, 2009) was an 
American Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the New York Yankees, 
Kansas City Athletics, Boston Red Sox, Washington Senators, Pittsburgh 
Pirates, Detroit Tigers, and New York Mets. He was nicknamed "Snake" for 
his excellent curveball. Born in Gordon, Kansas, he was signed by the Yankees 
as an amateur free agent out of Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma in May, 1948.[1] He started his professional career in the minor 
leagues. In 1952, he was 3-3 with a 3.56 ERA for Beaumont in the Texas 
League. In ‘53, he was 10-7 with a 3.76 ERA for Birmingham of the Eastern 
League. In ‘54, he was 8-9 with a 3.57 ERA, 133 strikeouts and just 59 
walks in 169 innings for Kansas City of the American Association.[2] Sturdivant 
made his major league debut the following year, working exclusively out 
of the bullpen during the regular season and the third and fourth games 
of the 1955 World Series. He was a sixteen-game winner in each of the next 
two campaigns, starting a World Series game in each year, and pitching 
a complete game to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers 6-2 in Game 4 of the 1956 
World Series (the game before Don Larsen's perfect game).[1] In 1957, his 
16-6 record led the American League in won-lost percentage (.727), and 
his 2.54 ERA was second in the league.[3] A rotator cuff injury in 1958 
greatly limited his effectiveness for the remainder of his baseball career.[1] 
On May 26, 1959, he, along with Johnny Kucks and Jerry Lumpe, was sent 
to Kansas City for Héctor López and Ralph Terry.[2] Sturdivant wore uniform 
number 32 for the A's that year. On December 3, 1959, he was traded by 
the Athletics to the Red Sox for Pete Daley.[2] He wore uniform number 
15 for the Red Sox. On December 14, 1960, he was drafted by the Senators 
from the Red Sox in the 1960 expansion draft. Initially he wore uniform 
number 35 for the Senators, but later was given the same number 47 which 
he had worn for the Yankees. He won the first shutout game in Senators 
history, a 4-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox on May 13, 1961.[2] On June 
29, 1961, he was traded by the Senators to the Pirates for Tom Cheney.[2] 
He wore uniform number 15 for the Pirates, the same number he had worn 
on the Red Sox. On May 4, 1963, he was purchased by the Tigers from the 
Pirates. He wore uniform number 22 for the Tigers. On July 23, 1963, he 
was purchased by the Athletics from the Tigers. He wore uniform number 
18 for the A's this time. After he was released by the Athletics on May 
10, 1964, he signed as a free agent with the Mets later that day. He wore 
uniform number 47, his old Yankees number, for the Mets. He was released 
by the Mets on June 27. After his retirement from the sport, he was involved 
in the freight and truck leasing business, concentrating on the former 
during the 1980s. He was once part-owner of R&R Trucking, Inc. He later 
served on the board of directors of Metro Tech in Oklahoma City and the 
Integris Hospice of Oklahoma County.[2] Sturdivant died on February 28,
