Anthrocon (abbreviated AC) is the world's largest furry convention, taking 
place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania each June or July. Its focus is on furries: 
fictional anthropomorphic animal characters in art and literature. The 
convention was first held in 1997 in New York State, and draws over 5,000 
attendees annually. Anthrocon 2016 drew 7,310 attendees, with 2,100 fursuiters 
participating in the fursuit parade.[1] Anthrocon was founded in 1997 as 
Albany Anthrocon (AAC) in New York State, with a membership of about 500. 
The convention was renamed to 'Anthrocon' and moved to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania 
in 1999 and 2000; then to a larger hotel, the Adams Mark, on the outskirts 
of Philadelphia in 2001. Attendance grew each year, Anthrocon becoming 
the largest furry convention in 2001 with an attendance of 1,457; It has 
retained that position of the largest furry convention since. In 2004 it 
had climbed to 2,404 attendees in its final year at the Adams Mark. Due 
to the unforeseen sale of the Adams Mark Hotel in November 2004, Anthrocon 
chose the Wyndham Franklin Plaza in Philadelphia as the site for its 2005 
convention. Attendance that year dropped slightly to 2,373, due in part 
to higher parking fees, a different and unfamiliar hotel (the Wyndham Franklin 
Plaza in downtown Philadelphia), and possibly due to Hurricane Dennis's 
effect on the southern United States which closed many airports and prevented 
people from traveling. In June 2005, a contract with the Westin Convention 
Center Hotel in Pittsburgh was signed, and Anthrocon was scheduled to be 
held at the adjoining David L. Lawrence Convention Center between June 
15 and 18, 2006. Despite concerns that the move to Pittsburgh would decrease 
attendance, it actually rose to 2,489, which was enough to ensure the future 
of the convention in Pittsburgh. In 2007 Anthrocon was featured in the 
Guinness World Records (2008 Edition) as the "largest furry fan club" in 
the world. In 2008, Anthrocon became the first furry convention to have 
an attendance exceeding 3,000 members, the official count reaching 3,390.[2] 
In 2009, attendance rose 11% to 3,776, and the Fursuit Parade count jumped 
to 640—a 41% increase.[3][4] Anthrocon 2009 brought approximately $3 million 
to the Pittsburgh economy.[5] Anthrocon 2010 had an attendance of 4,238, 
the first furry convention to exceed 4,000 members; and by 2012 saw 5,179 
attendees, with a Fursuit Parade exceeding 1,000. The admission price was 
also set overall at $60 for a four-day pass, though pre-registered attendees 
paid $50.[6] In 2013, Anthrocon contracted roomspace with seven of Pittsburgh's 
ten downtown hotels. The chairman of the convention since 1999, Dr. Samuel 
Conway (nicknamed "Kagemushi" or "Uncle Kage" among attendees), oversees 
the operations of Anthrocon, with the help of convention staff and volunteers 
who donate their time and energy throughout the weekend to assist the multitude 
of small tasks which arise. Since 1997, Anthrocon has raised more than 
$200,000 for animal-related charities.[2] There are areas open most of 
the day to accommodate sales by Dealers and Artists as well as an area 
to congregate and socialize (see "The Zoo" below). Anthrocon provides a 
number of specialized 'tracks' of programming with similar furry based 
themes and scheduled 'events'.[7][8] The programming tracks involve discussions 
and work groups focused on the application of furry in Art, Comedy and 
Improv, Computer Gaming, Costuming (Fursuits), Music, Puppetry, Role-Playing 
(both gaming and real-life), and Writing. The scheduled events that take 
place are the Charity Auction, the Masquerade, the Fursuit Parade, nightly 
dances, Art Show Auctions, and special presentations by Uncle Kage and 
"2 the Ranting Gryphon".[9] Every year the convention has several Guests 
of Honor – prominent individuals who are compensated for their attendance 
and travel expenses. Past Guests of Honor at Anthrocon have included:[16][17]
