The Miami Hurricanes (known informally as UM or UMiami) are the varsity 
sports teams of the University of Miami, located in the Coral Gables suburb 
of Miami, Florida. They compete in the Coastal Division of the Atlantic 
Coast Conference (ACC). The university fields 15 athletic teams for 17 
varsity sports.[3] Men's teams compete in baseball, basketball, cross-country, 
diving, football, tennis, and track and field. Women's teams compete in 
basketball, cross-country, swimming and diving, golf, rowing, soccer, tennis, 
track and field, and volleyball. UM has approximately equal participation 
by male and female varsity athletes in these sports.[4] Team colors are 
green, orange, and white. The school mascot is Sebastian the Ibis. The 
ibis was selected as the school's mascot because, according to university 
legend, it is the last animal to flee an approaching hurricane and the 
first to reappear after the storm, making it a symbol of leadership and 
courage. The school's athletics logo is a simple green and orange, color 
of an orange tree, letter "U." The school's marching band is the Band of 
the Hour. Aside from being an independent in baseball, the Hurricanes were 
a full member of the Big East Conference from 1991 to 2004. In 2004, the 
school became a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Miami's 
traditional athletic rivals include the Seminoles of Florida State University[5] 
and the Gators of the University of Florida.[6] The Hurricanes have played 
more football games against the Seminoles (60) than against any other opponent 
(Florida being second with 55 games); the series began in 1951, and has 
been played annually since 1969. The teams only bowl meeting was the 2004 
Orange Bowl, prior to Miami leaving the Big East Conference to join the 
Atlantic Coast Conference (in which Florida State has been a member since 
1992.) As of the 2016 meeting, the Hurricanes hold a 31–30 series lead 
against the Seminoles.[7] The Hurricanes first played the Gators in football 
in 1938; and the teams played annually (except in 1943 when Florida didn't 
field a team due lack of players due to WWII) until 1987. Since then, Miami 
and Florida have met only six times (four during the regular season in 
2002, 2003, 2008, and 2013, and in two bowl games: the 2001 Sugar Bowl 
and the 2004 Chick-fil-A Bowl). The Hurricanes and the Gators last scheduled 
meeting was the game in Miami on September 7, 2013. As of the fall of 2013, 
Miami holds a 29–26 series lead against Florida.[8][9] The University of 
Miami sponsors teams in seven and a half* men's and ten women's NCAA sanctioned 
sports:[10] Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports 
UM has won four national championships (1982, 1985, 1999 and 2001) and 
reached the College World Series 22 times in the 34 seasons since 1974. 
Five UM graduates are currently active on MLB teams.[citation needed] The 
team is currently coached by Jim Morris, the former head coach of the Georgia 
Tech baseball team. Former coach Ron Fraser was inducted into the College 
Baseball Hall of Fame in July 2006. The team plays its games on the UM 
campus, in Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field. Morris' contract as 
coach has been extended through 2015. Morris has established a record of 
850–344–3 (.711) in 19 seasons at Miami. His teams reached the College 
World Series in his first six seasons at UM, an NCAA record.[11] The Mascot 
for the baseball team is The Miami Maniac. Miami holds the longest consecutive 
post season appearance streak at 44 consecutive years (1973–2016). This 
streak is the longest of any men's NCAA Div. 1 major sport, topping the 
football post season streak of 35 seasons (Nebraska 1972–2006) and the 
basketball streak of 27 seasons (North Carolina 1974–2001). The Miami Hurricanes 
men's basketball team has produced three players who are currently on NBA 
rosters. Rick Barry, who played his collegiate basketball at UM, is a member 
of the Basketball Hall of Fame. Barry is the Hurricanes' only consensus 
All-American in basketball and led the nation in scoring his senior year 
with a 37.4 average during the 1964–65 campaign. The team plays its home 
games at the BankUnited Center on the University of Miami's Coral Gables 
campus. The Board of Trustees attempted to shut the program down in the 
middle of the 1970 season, which forced Will Allen to organize his teammates 
and strike because it was not sufficient notice for the players to transfer 
schools. They held a press conference and this caught the attention of 
the national press, and the university actually dropped the program after 
the 1971 season,[12] with the board citing inadequate facilities, sagging 
attendance, and serious financial losses as the reasons for the decision.[13] 
The program was revived before the 1985–86 season, though UM would be minimally 
competitive over the next several years. The program's fortunes turned 
around in 1990 when Miami hired Leonard Hamilton as head basketball coach 
and accepted an invitation to join the Big East. By the end of the decade, 
Hamilton had turned UM into one of the better basketball programs in the 
Big East and had guided UM to three straight NCAA tournament appearances 
(1998–2000), including a #2 seed in the 1999 tournament and a Sweet 16 
appearance in 2000. The 1998 tournament appearance was UM's first since 
1960. Hamilton left at the end of the 2000 season to become head coach 
of the NBA's Washington Wizards and was replaced by Perry Clark. During 
Clark's second season (2001–02) the team won 24 games and a #5 seed in 
the NCAA tournament. With the 2002–03 season, the team moved into its newly 
completed on-campus arena, the BankUnited Center. Despite a win over powerhouse 
North Carolina to christen the new arena, Clark's teams performed woefully 
over the next two seasons, leading[clarification needed] to his dismissal 
following the 2003–04 season (UM's last season in the Big East). Clark 
was replaced by Frank Haith, whose teams were competitive[clarification 
needed] in UM's first two seasons as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
In the 2007/2008 season, after being picked to finish last in the Atlantic 
Coast Conference the Hurricanes finished the year 23–11 (8–8 in the ACC) 
and reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament before falling to the 
second seeded University of Texas at Austin. This was the team's first 
NCAA tournament bid since the 2001–2002 season. For the 2009/2010 season, 
Miami had a winning record overall (20–13), but finished in last place 
in the ACC with a record of 4–12. On April 4, 2011, Miami Coach Frank Haith 
accepted a Head Coaching position at the University of Missouri. On April 
22, 2011, George Mason Patriots Head Coach Jim Larranaga accepted the Head 
Coaching position after coaching the Patriots for 14 seasons. For the '12–'13 
season, Miami (FL) knocked down No. 1 Duke 90-63, won their first 13 ACC 
games, and attained the highest AP ranking in school history, attaining 
a #2 ranking. However, the Hurricanes lost to Wake Forest, 80-65, ruining 
at the time, a perfect record in ACC play. Miami clinched an ACC regular 
season title with a home triumph over Clemson. Miami entered the ACC Tournament 
as the #1 seed, and won said tournament with a win over the North Carolina 
Tar Heels. Thanks to this very successful season, multiple members of the 
program were recognized. Starting point guard Shane Larkin was named the 
ACC Player of the Year, senior shooting guard Durand Scott was named ACC 
Defensive Player of the Year, & Jim Larranaga was named the ACC Coach of 
the Year. Miami (FL) was selected to be the No. 2 seed in East Region of 
the NCAA Tournament. Their first opponent would be Pacific University. 
They defeated the Tigers 78-49. Their next opponent would be the University 
of Illinois. They defeated the Fighting Illini 63-59, allowing them to 
advance into the Regional Semifinals, where they would lose to Marquette 
UM forward Shenise Johnson, during the summer of 2009, competed on the 
gold medal-winning USA Team at the 2009 U19 World Championships.[14] The 
team plays its home games at the BankUnited Center on the University of 
Miami's Coral Gables campus. In 2009–10, Miami finished last in the ACC. 
A year later, the Lady Canes went 26–3 (12–2 ACC) in the regular season 
to finish alongside Duke as regular season ACC champions. Miami went undefeated 
at the BankUnited Center, extending their home winning streak to 24 straight 
games. Despite a quarterfinal exit in the ACC Tournament, Miami's performance 
was enough to merit the program's first NCAA tournament bid since 1992. 
After cruising past Gardner-Webb in the first round, they lost to Oklahoma 
in the second. Head coach Katie Meier won National Coach of the Year, along 
with Connecticut's Geno Auriemma and Stanford's Tara VanDerveer.[15] Junior 
guards Shenice Johnson and Riquana Williams were named to the All-ACC first 
team, sophomore forward Morgan Stroman was named to the all-conference 
third team, and Johnson was a third-team All-American.[16] The 2011–12 
team returned every player from the 2010–11 squad and was picked in the 
preseason to win the ACC. On July 22, 2008, Amy Deem was promoted to Director 
of Track and Field/Cross Country and heads both the men's and women's programs. 
She was head women's track and field coach for the prior 7 years.[17] In 
the 2006 ACC Cross Country Championships, UM's men finished 12th out of 
12 teams,[18] and UM's women finished also finished last out of 12.[19] 
At the 2009 ACC Cross Country Championship, UM's men[20] and women[21] 
again finished last out of 12 teams. UM has both men's and women's diving 
teams. In 2008, the men's team finished 11th (57 pts.) at the ACC Championships 
and finished 18th (40 pts.) at the NCAA Championships.[22] Historically, 
the Hurricanes are one of the most predominant college football programs 
in the nation. They have won five Division I national football championships 
(1983, 1987, 1989, 1991, and 2001), and are currently ranked fourth on 
the list of all-time Associated Press National Poll Championships, behind 
Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama.[23] As of 2012[update], UM has produced 
two Heisman Trophy winners, Vinny Testaverde (in 1986) and Gino Torretta 
(in 1992). Five former UM football players—Warren Sapp, Ted Hendricks, 
Michael Irvin, Jim Kelly, Cortez Kennedy and Jim Otto—have been voted into 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame following their NFL careers. Two other former 
UM players, Ottis Anderson and Ray Lewis, have been named Super Bowl MVPs 
(for Super Bowl XXV and Super Bowl XXXV, respectively). Since the 2008 
demolition of the Miami Orange Bowl, the team has played its home games 
at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens. As of the 2011 National Football 
League season, UM had the most players active in the NFL of any university 
in the nation, with 42.[24] The Hurricanes won the national golf championships 
in 1970, 1972, 1977, 1978 and 1984.[25] The team plays its home games on 
at Deering Bay Yacht & Country Club in Coral Gables, Florida.[25] In July 
2009, Andrew Carter, a former assistant coach at Clemson University, was 
selected as head rowing coach at UM. Carter has over 20 years of experience 
coaching at the collegiate and international levels. Marc DeRose was hired 
as assistant coach.[26] Miami added a soccer team in 1957. It offered scholarships 
from the beginning by phasing in 3 scholarships per year over a four-year 
period. The Cobb Stadium for Soccer, Track and Field was built on the Coral 
Gables campus in 1998 for the program. In 2009, the team finished 8th (219 
pts.) at the ACC Championships and 24th (25 pts.) at the NCAA Championships.[22] 
The team won the AIAW national championship in 1975 and 1976.[27][28] UM 
does not currently have a varsity men's swimming team. Michael Russell 
played number one singles for the University of Miami in 1996–97.[29] He 
was named 1997 NCAA Rookie of the Year and an All-American, and finished 
No. 7 in collegiate rankings (and No. 1 among freshmen).[29][30][31][32] 
His 39 singles-match wins were a school record, and he was the first freshman 
since 1986 to win the Rolex National Intercollegiate Indoor Championships, 
defeating Fred Niemeyer in the final.[17] He was also named to the 1997 
Rolex Collegiate All-Star Team, selected by the Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association and Tennis Magazine, and the Big East Championship Most Outstanding 
Player.[33] As of 2009[update], Kevin Ludwig was the head coach, and there 
were 9 men[34] and 7 women on the tennis team.[35] The men's team is coached 
by Mario Rincon, and women's team by Paige Yaroshuk-Tews. In July 2008, 
Mike Ward, who served for five years as an assistant and 11 years as head 
coach in the University of Miami's track and cross country programs, retired.[36] 
Amy Deem, who had been the women's coach for 17 years became the Director 
of Track and Field/Cross Country.[17] Perhaps UM's most notable athlete 
is Lauryn Williams '04, who earned nine All-American honors. Internationally, 
Williams won the silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, gold at the 
2005 World Championships in Athletics, and finished 5th at the 2009 World 
Championships in Athletics.,[37] all in the 100m dash. The team plays its 
home games at Cobb Stadium on the University of Miami's Coral Gables campus. 
The women's volleyball team had a 26–6 2008 season overall with a record 
of 14–6 in conference matches.[38] UM has sponsored other varsity sports 
in the past. The University of Miami polo team was undefeated in tournament 
play from 1948–1951. However, the games were poorly attended and the program 
ran a $15,000 deficit in 1950. The sport was dropped the following year.[28] 
Boxing was one of the most popular and successful athletic programs on 
campus through the 1950s. Varsity boxing matches attracted sizeable crowds.[39] 
Miami has won 5 NCAA team national championships.[40] Below are 16 national 
team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: The Miami Hurricanes most 
recent (2013) overall program Graduation Success Rate (GSR) of 92 percent, 
according to the rates released by the NCAA. Miami's GSR is tied for third 
among ACC schools and 10th overall among FBS programs. UM has exceeded 
the NCAA average GSR in each of the last nine years. In 2012, Miami set 
a school-record with a 93 percent GSR, a year after (2011) establishing 
a then-record at 89 percent. Eight teams compiled GSR marks of 100 percent. 
Men's diving and golf each posted their ninth consecutive perfect marks, 
while women's tennis recorded its sixth straight GSR score of 100 percent. 
Baseball, women's track & field / cross country, rowing, women's swimming 
and volleyball also tallied perfect GSR scores. It was volleyball's third 
straight year with a perfect GSR; rowing and women's swimming posted perfect 
scores for the second straight year.[42] The University of Miami, as articulated 
by its former president Donna Shalala, has been very supportive of achieving 
gender equity and complying with Title IX. Shalala wrote of her support 
in a Miami Herald column on the 30th anniversary of that law.[43] However, 
in the past, female athletes filed complaints with the federal government 
in the 1970s and 1980s alleging unequal funding and facilities for UM women's 
sports.[44] Of the $46.8 million in annual athletic expenditures, $23.9 
million were spent on men's team, $9.8 million were spent on women's teams, 
and $13 million can not be allocated based on gender.[4] Miami has notable 
differences between the graduation rates of male and female student athletes. 
As of 2002[update], UM graduation rates had 64.1% graduating within 4 years, 
75.1% graduating within 5 years, and 76.8% graduating within 6 years.[45] 
Male student athletes have a 52% 4 year graduation rate, and 72% of female 
student athletes graduate within 4 years.[46] Some critics of Miami's allocation 
of fiscal resources within the Athletics Department have blamed the decision 
to drop certain men's teams on Title IX compliance.[47][48][49] The University 
of Miami Sports Hall of Fame[50] is located next to the Hecht Athletic 
Center on campus. It houses many artifacts and memorabilia from the Hurricanes' 
athletic teams over the last 80 years. Each year, the Hall of Fame inducts 
former athletes who have been out of school at least 10 years, or coaches 
and administrators, in an annual banquet. Since its inception in 1966,
