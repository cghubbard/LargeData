The Pittsburgh Pirates are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They play in the National League Central division. 
Since the establishment of the Rule 4 Draft the Pirates have selected 54 
players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[1] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning players 
from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to its franchises. 
The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, 
with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick.[1] 
In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may 
be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[2] Of these 54 players, 
21 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 15 of these were right-handed, 
while 6 were left-handed. 13 outfielders and eleven shortstops were selected. 
The Pirates have also drafted five catchers, three first basemen, and a 
third baseman, but have never selected a second baseman in the first round.[3] 
Eight players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, 
while seven came from Florida.[3] Three Pirates' first-round picks have 
won championships with the franchise. Richie Hebner (1966) won a World 
Series title on the 1971 championship team, and Steve Nicosia (1973) and 
Dale Berra (1975) won with the 1979 team (though Berra did not appear in 
the World Series).[4][5][6] No Pirates' first-round pick has ever won the 
Rookie of the Year Award. None of their picks have been elected to the 
Baseball Hall of Fame, but Barry Bonds (1985) won seven Most Valuable Player 
awards, more than any other player, including two with Pittsburgh.[7][8] 
Bonds also won 12 Silver Sluggers, 8 Gold Gloves, and holds both the single-season 
and career home run records (73 and 762).[7] The Pirates have made five 
selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have made the first 
overall selection four times (1986, 1996, 2002, 2011).[3][9] The Pirates 
have failed once in signing a draft pick. This occurred in 2012, when the 
Pirates selected RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a 
significant bonus which, according to new MLB rules, would have cost the 
Pirates a future draft pick. The Pirates will receive the 9th overall pick 
in the 2013 draft for their failure to sign Appel.[10] Pedro Alvarez (2009) 
nearly went unsigned as he faced a contentious process in which Alvarez 
and the Pirates reached an initial deal after the signing deadline (with 
permission from MLB); his agent Scott Boras and the Players Association 
filed a grievance challenging this post-deadline deal, and ultimately the 
Pirates renegotiated a deal with him in September that year.[11][12] The 
Pirates have had seven compensatory picks overall since the first draft 
in 1965.[3] These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly 
valuable free agent in the previous off-season,[2][13][V] or, more recently,
