As player As coach Joseph Earl "Joe" McEwing (born October 17, 1972) is 
a former Major League Baseball player who spent most of his career with 
the New York Mets, where he played from 2000 through 2004. Nicknamed "Super 
Joe", he was the prototypical utility player who could play any position 
on the field well. McEwing is currently the third base coach for the Chicago 
White Sox. McEwing played college baseball at the County College of Morris 
in Randolph Township, New Jersey.[1] He played high school baseball at 
Bishop Egan High School (now known as Conwell-Egan Catholic High School) 
in Levittown, Pennsylvania. In 1998, he had a total of 51 doubles with 
Triple-A Memphis and Double-A Arkansas.[2] His first full season in the 
majors was also his best. McEwing batted .275 in 1999 with 141 hits and 
nine home runs, both career highs. He also amassed a 25-game hitting streak, 
the fifth longest at that time by a rookie, and finished fifth in National 
League Rookie of the Year balloting. McEwing became an immediate fan favorite 
because of his energy, hustle and obvious love for the game.[3] During 
his rookie season, McEwing played every position on the field, except pitcher 
and catcher. In his honor, St. Louis Cardinals fans created what was known 
as "Little Mac Land," in a play on words of the official "Big Mac Land" 
created in the upper deck of Busch Stadium for Mark McGwire.[4][5] McEwing 
had a streak of 230 errorless games, which at one point was the longest 
such streak by an active major league outfielder.[6] McEwing was often 
successful against Randy Johnson, so McEwing was nicknamed "Little Unit" 
(a reference to Johnson who was called "Big Unit").[7] During Spring training 
just before the start of the 2000 season, he was traded to the New York 
Mets for Jesse Orosco. Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa admired McEwing so 
much that he requested a pair of the player's spikes upon the trade.[8] 
Released by the Mets toward the end of spring training in 2005 (which especially 
upset All-Star David Wright),[9] the Kansas City Royals signed him to provide 
extra infield insurance. The Royals called him up to the major leagues 
on March 12, when regular third baseman, Mark Teahen, went on the 15-day 
disabled list. On March 30, 2006, he was sent to the Houston Astros by 
the Royals. In 2007, he signed a minor league contract with the Boston 
Red Sox.[10] On January 16, 2008, McEwing officially announced his retirement 
from baseball. In the 2008 season, McEwing started his baseball coaching 
career as the hitting coach for the Charlotte Knights. On November 3, 2008, 
he was named manager of the Winston-Salem Dash, the Class A affiliate for 
the Chicago White Sox, for the 2009 season.[11] During that season, Baseball 
America rated McEwing as the top managerial prospect in the South Atlantic 
League.[12] McEwing was also named Manager of the Year for his work managing 
the Dash in 2009.[13] McEwing was named manager of the Charlotte Knights, 
the White Sox triple-A affiliate for the 2011 season.[14] On October 10, 
2011, several sources reported that McEwing would be promoted to serve 
as the third-base coach for the White Sox in 2012, serving under new manager 
Robin Ventura.[15][16] Several managerial and coaching positions opened 
up shortly before the end of the 2011 season when then White Sox manager 
Ozzie Guillen announced that he would be leaving.[17] McEwing was given
