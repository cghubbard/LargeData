George Clifton James (born May 29, 1921) is an American actor, best known 
for his roles as Sheriff J.W. Pepper alongside Roger Moore in the James 
Bond films Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), 
the sheriff in Silver Streak (1976), and as the floor walker prison guard 
in Cool Hand Luke (1967). James was born in Spokane, Washington, the son 
of Grace (née Dean), a teacher, and Harry James, a journalist.[1] James 
is a decorated World War II veteran, U.S. Army Combat Infantry Platoon 
Sergeant Co. "A" 163rd Inf., 41st Div. He served forty-two months in the 
South Pacific, from January 1942 until August 1945. He spent time in Australia, 
New Guinea, and the Philippines. His decorations include: Silver Star, 
Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, Combat Infantry 
Badge and six battle stars.[citation needed] James became well known for 
playing the comic-relief role of Louisiana Sheriff J. W. Pepper in the 
James Bond films Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man with the Golden Gun 
(1974). He also played a very similar character in both Superman II and 
Silver Streak, and a more serious sheriff in The Reivers. James was the 
district attorney who prosecutes Al Capone in the 1987 film The Untouchables. 
He played a Navy Master at Arms in 1973's The Last Detail starring Jack 
Nicholson and Chicago White Sox baseball team owner Charles Comiskey in 
the 1988 true story Eight Men Out, a drama about the corrupt 1919 Chicago 
White Sox. Despite being a lifelong New Yorker (and an Actors Studio member 
of long standing),[2] James has been cast as a Southerner in many of his 
roles, like his appearances in the James Bond films, and also powerful 
Houston lawyer Striker Bellman in the daytime soap opera Texas from 1981–82. 
He was a Southern character as the penitentiary's floor-walker in the Paul 
Newman film Cool Hand Luke, and again as Sheriff Lester Crabb, a temporary 
one-off replacement for regular Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) 
in the second season Dukes of Hazzard episode "Treasure of Hazzard" (1980). 
In the 1969 film The Reivers, opposite Steve McQueen, James played a mean, 
corrupt bungling country sheriff, a basic warmup for his more lovable Sheriff 
J. W. Pepper in Live and Let Die. James appeared on 13 episodes of the 
sitcom Lewis & Clark in 1981–82. Other television credits include the miniseries 
Captains and the Kings (1976), and two episodes of The A-Team as murderous 
prison Warden Beale in the first-season episode "Pros and Cons" (1983), 
and as corrupt Sheriff Jake Dawson in the second season's "The White Ballot" 
(1983). In 1996, he played the role of "Red Kilgreen" on the ABC daytime 
drama series, All My Children. His other film roles include that of a wealthy 
Montana land baron whose cattle are being rustled in 1975's Rancho Deluxe 
and as the source who tips off a newspaperman (Bruce Willis) to a potentially 
explosive story in The Bonfire of the Vanities. James has been featured 
a number of times by writer-director John Sayles, most recently in Lone 
Star (1996) and Sunshine State (2002). He resides in Gladstone, Oregon. 
He has six children, fourteen grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
