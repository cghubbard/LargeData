The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are a professional baseball team based 
in Anaheim, California. The Angels are a member of the Western Division 
of Major League Baseball's American League. The "Angels" name originates 
from the city that was their original home, Los Angeles, and was inspired 
by a minor league club of the same name. The Angels have been based in 
Angel Stadium of Anaheim since 1966. For many years, there had been talk 
of an existing American League team relocating to L.A. In 1940, the St. 
Louis Browns asked AL owners for permission to move to Los Angeles, but 
were turned down. They planned another move for the 1942 season, and this 
time got permission from the league. A schedule was even drawn up including 
Los Angeles, but the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 made major-league 
sports of any sort on the West Coast unviable. In 1953, there was again 
talk of the Browns moving to L.A. for the 1954 season, but the team was 
sold and moved to Baltimore instead as the Orioles. There were on-again, 
off-again discussions between city officials and the Washington Senators 
regarding a possible move. There were also rumors that the Philadelphia 
Athletics' move to Kansas City in 1955 was a temporary stop on the way 
to Los Angeles. In the end it was the National League that first came to 
the city, in the form of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley 
purchased the Pacific Coast League's Los Angeles Angels in early 1957 from 
Chicago Cubs owner Phil Wrigley. Under the rules of the time, he also acquired 
the rights to a major league team in Los Angeles, which he used to move 
the Dodgers there a year later. Under ordinary circumstances, that would 
have precluded any subsequent American League presence in the Los Angeles 
area. However, in an effort to prevent the proposed Continental League 
from becoming a reality, in 1960 the two existing leagues agreed to expand, 
adding two new teams to each league. Though the understanding was that 
expansion teams would be placed in cities without major league baseball, 
that agreement quickly broke down. When the National League placed a team 
in New York City (the Mets) as its tenth franchise, the American League 
announced plans to place an expansion team in Los Angeles, to begin play 
in 1961. Gene Autry, former movie cowboy, singer, actor and owner of Golden 
West Broadcasters (including Los Angeles' KMPC radio and KTLA television), 
attended the Major League Owners' meeting in St. Louis in 1960 in hopes 
of winning broadcasting rights for the new team's games. Hall of Famer 
Hank Greenberg was initially on the fast track to be the team's first owner, 
with Bill Veeck as a partner. However, when O'Malley got word of Veeck's 
involvement, he invoked his exclusive right to operate a major league team 
in Southern California. In truth, O'Malley wasn't about to compete with 
Veeck, who was known as a master promoter. After it became obvious that 
O'Malley would never sign off on the deal as long as Veeck was a part-owner, 
Greenberg was forced to bow out. After another bid by Chicago insurance 
executive and future A's owner Charlie Finley failed, Autry was persuaded 
to make a bid himself. Autry (who had been a minority stockholder in the 
Angels' PCL rival, the Hollywood Stars) agreed, and purchased the franchise. 
Autry named the new franchise the Los Angeles Angels. The origins of the 
name date back to 1892, when it was first used by a Los Angeles franchise 
in the California League. The Angel moniker has always been natural for 
Los Angeles teams, since The Angels is a literal English translation of 
the Spanish Los Angeles. It was also a nod to the long-successful PCL team 
that played in Los Angeles from 1903 through 1957. O'Malley still owned 
the rights to the Angels name even after moving the team to Spokane to 
make way for the Dodgers, so Autry paid O'Malley $300,000 for the rights 
to the name. The Angels and their fellow expansionists, the new Washington 
Senators (now the Texas Rangers) chose players from other American League 
teams in an expansion draft. In 1961, the first year of the team's existence, 
the Angels finished 70–91 for a .435 winning percentage, still the highest 
winning percentage ever for a first-year major league expansion team. Moreover, 
they not only finished 9 games ahead of the Senators, but also 9 games 
ahead of the Kansas City Athletics. The 1961 Angels, admittedly a motley 
crew, featured portly first baseman Steve Bilko, a long-time fan favorite, 
having played many years with the PCL Angels. Another favorite was the 
diminutive (5' 5⅜") center fielder, El Monte native Albie Pearson. The 
Angels played that inaugural season at Wrigley Field in South Los Angeles, 
the longtime home of the PCL Angels and also of the syndicated television 
series Home Run Derby. They originally wanted to play at the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum, where the Dodgers had played on a temporary basis since 
moving from Brooklyn. However, Commissioner Ford Frick turned this idea 
down almost out of hand after concluding that the Coliseum's extremely 
short left field fence (only 250 feet from the plate) made it unsuitable 
even as a temporary facility. In 1962, under the terms of their agreement 
with O'Malley, the Angels moved to Dodger Stadium, which they would refer 
to as Chavez Ravine. That year, the Angels were a contender for the American 
League pennant for most of the season, even leading the American League 
standings on July 4, before finishing in third place, 10 games behind the 
New York Yankees, who won their 27th American League pennant. On May 5 
of that year, Bo Belinsky, who was as famous for his dexterity with the 
pool cue and his dating of Hollywood starlets (most particularly Mamie 
Van Doren) as for his pitching prowess, tossed the first no-hit game in 
the history of Dodger Stadium/Chavez Ravine, blanking the Orioles 5–0. 
(Though raised in the Jewish faith, Belinsky later became a born-again 
Christian and counselor, advising against the lifestyle which once was 
his trademark.) In 1964, the Halos again finished fifth in the American 
League, and pitcher Dean Chance won the Major League Cy Young Award that 
year. The need for a new stadium became more and more evident. It was thought 
the Angels would never develop a large fan base playing as tenants of the 
Dodgers. Also, O'Malley imposed fairly onerous lease conditions on the 
Angels; for example, he charged them for 50% of all stadium supplies, even 
though the Angels at the time drew at best half of the Dodgers' attendance. 
Stymied in his attempt to get a new stadium in Los Angeles, Autry looked 
elsewhere. His first choice for a stadium was the site offered by the city 
of Long Beach. However, the city insisted the team be renamed the Long 
Beach Angels, a condition Autry refused to accept. He was able to strike 
a deal with the suburban city of Anaheim in Orange County, and construction 
began on Anaheim Stadium (nicknamed The Big A by Southern Californians), 
where the Angels moved in 1966. On September 2, 1965, team ownership announced 
the Los Angeles Angels would thenceforth be known as the California Angels, 
in anticipation of the team's move to Anaheim the following year. They 
were the second Major League baseball team to be named after an entire 
state, following the Minnesota Twins. At the time, though they were one 
of three major league teams in the state of California, the Angels were 
the only American League team in the state. (Despite the move of the Kansas 
City Athletics to Oakland in 1968 and the establishment of the San Diego 
Padres in 1969, the Angels retained their California moniker through 1996, 
despite any objections the other California teams may have had.) They were 
also the first Major League Baseball team that was originally from California 
(The Dodgers, Giants were from New York, the A's were from Kansas City 
and the Padres were granted Major League status after the Angels.) In their 
last year at Chavez Ravine, the Angels drew only 566,727 paying customers. 
In their 1966 inaugural year in Anaheim, the Angels drew over 1.4 million, 
leading the American League in attendance. In 1967, their second year in 
Anaheim, the Angels contended for the American League pennant as part of 
a five-team pennant race (along with Chicago, Detroit, Minnesota and eventual 
winner Boston) before fading in late August, but eventually became the 
"spoilers" by defeating Detroit at Tiger Stadium in the last game of the 
regular season to give Boston its first AL pennant in 21 years. In 1970 
the Angels finished third in the AL Western Division and Alex Johnson became 
the first (and so far only) Angel to win an American League batting title. 
Other notable Angels of this period included pitchers Clyde Wright and 
Ken McBride, shortstop Jim Fregosi, outfielders Albie Pearson and Leon 
Wagner, and catcher Buck Rodgers. Fregosi and Rodgers later managed the 
Angels. During the 1970s, although Angel fans endured some mediocre years 
on the field they also were able to enjoy the heroics of fireballer Nolan 
Ryan, who tossed four of his seven no-hitters as an Angel.[1] He also set 
several strikeout records throughout his career, most notably a 383-strikeout 
mark in 1973, still a major league record. Ryan was acquired in a trade 
that sent Jim Fregosi to the Mets. Ryan had been a middle relief pitcher 
on the "Miracle Mets" team that captured the 1969 World Series. Ryan's 
feats caused him to be named the Ryan Express, after the 1965 film Von 
Ryan's Express, which starred Frank Sinatra. His prowess, combined with 
that of fellow moundsman Frank Tanana, produced the refrain, "Tanana, Ryan 
and Two Days of Cryin'", a derivative of the refrain, "Spahn and Sain, 
then pray for rain", coined when Warren Spahn and Johnny Sain anchored 
the pitching staff of the then Boston Braves in the 1940s. Ironically, 
the 1970s came to a close with the decision by then-general manager Buzzie 
Bavasi to allow Ryan to become a free agent. At the time, Bavasi remarked 
that Ryan, whose 1979 record was 16–14 (Ryan was 26–27 under Bavasi), could 
be replaced "with two pitchers who go 8–7." Bavasi later admitted this 
was "the worst mistake I ever made in all my years in baseball."[citation 
needed] The Angels won their first American League West Division championship 
in 1979 under manager Jim Fregosi, a former Angel shortstop who was sent 
to the New York Mets in 1972 as part of the trade that brought Nolan Ryan 
to the Angels. Don Baylor became the first designated hitter to win the 
American League Most Valuable Player award. Other contributors to the team, 
which featured a powerful offense, were Bert Campaneris, Rod Carew, Dan 
Ford and Bobby Grich. However, the Angels lost what then was a best 3-out-of-5 
American League Championship Series to the Baltimore Orioles, managed by 
Earl Weaver, 3 games to 1. The Halos won Game 3 at home, scoring twice 
in the bottom of the 9th inning to shade Baltimore 4-3. This was the only 
year between 1971 and 1981 that the American League West wasn't won by 
either the Oakland Athletics or the Kansas City Royals.[2] 1979 had been 
the Angels' last season at the "old" Big A. The Los Angeles Rams agreed 
to move to Anaheim for the 1980 season, with seating increased to almost 
65,000. The expansion completely enclosed the stadium, replacing the view 
of the San Gabriel and Santa Ana Mountains with three decks of gray concrete. 
In the 1980s, like many other baseball teams of that era, the Angels learned 
the difficulties of marketing the team while playing in a multi-purpose 
facility with a seating capacity too large for baseball. The Angels nearly 
reached the World Series in the 1982 postseason. Reggie Jackson, who previously 
starred for the Oakland Athletics and the New York Yankees, joined the 
Angels that year and teamed with many holdovers from the 1979 team for 
the 1982 effort. The team was helmed by manager Gene Mauch, who would also 
manage the team during their 1986 postseason appearance. After clinching 
their second AL West championship, the Angels won the first two games of 
the best-of-five ALCS against the AL East champion Milwaukee Brewers — 
then promptly dropped the next three in a row to lose the series. As Steve 
Bisheff wrote in Tales from the Angels Dugout, "No team in history had 
ever come back from an 0–2 deficit to win in a best-of-five series. Of 
course, no team had ever faced the Angels in that situation." (At that 
time, the team with home field advantage played the first two games on 
the road before hosting the final three games at home, a format that was 
changed following the 1984 season. In subsequent years, the same has happened 
to other teams.) Again, the Halos nearly reached the World Series in the 
1986 postseason. Baylor was gone, but among the new additions were American 
League Rookie of the Year runner-up Wally Joyner and pitcher Chuck Finley. 
Champions of the AL West for the third time, the Angels faced the AL East 
champions Boston Red Sox in the ALCS. Leading in the series 3 games to 
1, the Angels were one out away from defeating Boston and going to the 
World Series for the first time in their history. Leading 5–2 in the top 
of the ninth inning of Game 5, starter Mike Witt surrendered a two-run 
home run to former Angel Don Baylor, cutting the Angels' lead to 5–4. After 
reliever Gary Lucas hit Rich Gedman with his first and only pitch, closer 
Donnie Moore came in to shut the door. Though twice the Angels were one 
strike away from the Series, Moore gave up a two-out, two-strike, two-run 
home run to Dave Henderson that put Boston ahead 6–5. Although the Angels 
managed to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth, Henderson again came 
through for the Red Sox with a sacrifice fly in the 11th, eventually giving 
Boston a 7–6 victory. Thoroughly shocked, the Angels then travelled to 
Fenway Park and were blown out in Games 6 and 7 as the Red Sox claimed 
the pennant. Boston would go on to lose the 1986 World Series in seven 
games to the New York Mets, a series known for the infamous Bill Buckner 
error in Game 6. In the aftermath of the ALCS, Angels fans regarded Henderson's 
home run off Moore as the point at which their team had been closest to 
the World Series, and thus Moore became the scapegoat for the Angels' loss 
of the pennant. Although the fans were hard on him, Moore (who had battled 
depression in the past) was even harder on himself, and that one pitch 
to Henderson that turned the tide of the ALCS haunted him for the rest 
of his days. He would take his own life three years later, claiming to 
have never gotten over that moment. Moore's suicide was the latest in a 
series of tragedies that dogged the team (star outfielder Lyman Bostock 
was shot to death in 1978 while visiting friends in Gary, Indiana) and 
gave rise to talk of a "hex" on the franchise. The Angels would not qualify 
for the playoffs for the next 16 years. For most of the 1990s, the Angels 
played sub-.500 baseball, due in no small part to the confusion which reigned 
at the top. Gene Autry, though holding a controlling interest in the Angels, 
was in control in name only due to poor health in his advanced years. Autry's 
wife Jackie, 20 years his junior, at times seemed to be the decision-maker, 
and at other times the Disney Company, then a minority owner, seemed to 
be in charge. On May 21, 1992, an Angels' team bus traveling from New York 
to Baltimore crashed on the New Jersey Turnpike. Twelve members of the 
team ensemble were injured, including manager Buck Rodgers, who was hospitalized 
and missed the next two months of the season. In 1993, the Angels had a 
new spring training camp in Tempe, Arizona after 31 previous seasons in 
Palm Springs Stadium in Palm Springs, an idea Autry developed from the 
days when he stayed in his desert resort home. The Angels hoped a new facility 
would rejuvenate and improve the roster in the long run. The 1993 and 1994 
seasons proved to be worse for the Angels than the previous three, particularly 
since the 1994 season ended in a baseball player strike that kept Angel 
fans waiting even longer for the team's fate to change. In that season, 
the Halos had the second-worst record in baseball at the time of the strike, 
and were en route to a 66-96 season, which would have been their worst 
record in team history had the season continued, and were in last place 
in their division, but just 5 1/2 games out. In 1995, the Angels suffered 
the worst collapse in franchise history. In first place in the AL West 
by 11 games in August, the team again lost key personnel (particularly 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina) and went on an extended slide during the final 
stretch run. By season's end, they were in a first-place tie with the surging 
Seattle Mariners, prompting a one-game playoff for the division title. 
The Mariners, managed by Lou Piniella and led by pitching ace Randy Johnson, 
laid a 9–1 drubbing on the Angels in the playoff game, clinching the AL 
West championship and forcing the Angels and their fans to endure yet another 
season of heartbreak and bitter disappointment. Given the clubs's inability 
to win a pennant thus far, the postseason disasters of 1982 and 1986, the 
1995 collapse, and tragedies such as Bostock's murder and Moore's suicide, 
it was suggested that there must be a "curse" on the Angels. Since there 
did not appear to be a single defining moment when things started to go 
downhill, or one where "the baseball gods" might have been offended, some 
suggested that it was Autry who was the cause, a grand life seeing all 
its good luck evened out in his ownership of a baseball team. The idea 
of a "Curse of the Cowboy" did not take hold, however, due to the great 
affection Autry engendered as a public figure, and the idea would diminish 
with the sale of the team and its later postseason success. To some extent, 
the idea of a different curse did take hold, however. Prior to the Angels' 
World Series victory in 2002, some had theorized that the team did not 
have success because its stadium, Angel Stadium of Anaheim, was supposedly 
built upon an ancient Native American burial ground (although Anaheim city 
historians have not been able to either confirm or debunk the theory). 
"Heck, people were talking about it in spring training. We were standing 
around the outfield one day and everyone was concerned about the stadium 
being cursed because it was built on an ancient Indian burial ground. We 
were going to go get an exorcist or a Catholic priest or something to get 
rid of the curse. I'm like, "I don't want to be on an Indian burial ground." 
The Walt Disney Company effectively took control of the Angels in 1996, 
when it was able to gain enough support on the board to hire Tony Tavares 
as team president. Gene Autry, however, remained as chairman until his 
death in 1998. In 1999, Tavares hired Bill Stoneman as team general manager, 
under whose watch the Angels eventually won their first World Series Championship. 
Although Disney did not technically acquire a controlling interest in the 
team until after Autry's death, for all practical purposes it ran the team 
(the Autry loyalists on the board acted as "silent partners") through its 
Anaheim Sports subsidiary, which also owned the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim 
at the time. Disney, of course, had been a catalyst for the development 
of and population growth in Orange County, having opened its Disneyland 
theme park in Anaheim in 1955. Autry had named Walt Disney himself to the 
Angels' board in 1960; Mr. Disney served on the board until his death in 
1966, and had been one of the proponents of the team's move to Orange County 
in 1965–66. Walt Disney Pictures also produced the 1994 movie Angels in 
the Outfield, which featured a fictionalized version of the team. In 1995, 
the year of the Angels' worst regular season collapse, the Los Angeles 
Rams had moved to St. Louis, citing the deteriorating conditions at Anaheim 
Stadium as a primary cause for the move. Angels management, stuck in an 
aging, oversized "white elephant" of a stadium, hinted the team might be 
moved from Southern California as well. In 1997, negotiations between the 
Angels and the city of Anaheim for renovation of Anaheim Stadium ended 
with an agreement to rehabilitate and downsize the facility into a baseball-only 
stadium once more. One condition of the stadium agreement was that the 
Angels could sell naming rights to the renovated stadium, so long as the 
new name was one "containing Anaheim therein." Anaheim Stadium was almost 
immediately renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim, though it was 
almost always referred to as simply Edison Field. Sportscasters also referred 
to the stadium at the time as The Big Ed, with a few others continuing 
to use the Big A nickname and, at times, Anaheim Stadium. Another condition 
of the stadium renovation agreement was that the team name itself be one 
"containing Anaheim therein." The emerging Disney ownership was itself 
in the process of renovating and upgrading its aging Disneyland park. Disney 
hoped to market Anaheim as a "destination city", much the same way it had 
done with Orlando, Florida, where Walt Disney World was located. Accordingly, 
the team changed its name again, to the Anaheim Angels on November 19, 
1996. Many fans of the team protested the name change, believing the Anaheim 
name was small-time, though in time the protests fizzled out.[citation 
needed] Team uniforms changed in 1997 as well. The familiar "A-N-G-E-L-S" 
spelled out on the jersey front was replaced with a logo designed by Disney 
Studios, being a stylized form of the team name with an enlarged angel 
wing to the left of the "A", on new pinstriped vest jerseys. These uniforms 
were universally ridiculed, being referred to as the "softball beer league" 
uniforms by Chris Berman of ESPN and as "periwinkle jerseys" by many Angel 
fans.[citation needed] Then came 2002. The year began with the team scrapping 
its pinstriped vest jerseys after five years, reverting to uniforms conforming 
more to the team's traditional uniforms, but now mostly red, with a bit 
of navy blue trim. Significantly, the Angels' road jerseys now read "Anaheim", 
the first time the team's geographic location had been noted on its uniforms 
since 1965. Pundits[who?] predicted the Angels to be third-place finishers 
in the four-team AL West division, and the team played to those expectations 
with a 6–14 start to the regular season. The Angels, managed by former 
Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia, then went on to win 99 games 
and earn the American League wildcard berth. The Oakland Athletics won 
103 games, putting the Angels in second place in the division. The Halos 
defeated the AL East champions New York Yankees 3 games to 1 in the American 
League Division Series, ending the Yankees' streak of 4 straight American 
League Pennants, and the Minnesota Twins 4 games to 1 in the ALCS, to win 
the American League pennant for the first time in their history. In the 
2002 World Series they met the Wildcard San Francisco Giants, paced by 
slugger Barry Bonds, in what ended up being the highest-scoring World Series 
of all time. San Francisco took Game 1 (4–3), but the Angels followed that 
up by winning Games 2 (11–10) and 3 (10–4). The Giants came back to win 
Games 4 (4–3) and 5 (16–4). The turning point in the series came in Game 
6. The Angels trailed 5–0 and were 8 outs away from elimination before 
rallying for 3 runs in both the seventh and eighth innings to win 6–5. 
The Angels then won Game 7, 4–1, to claim their franchise's first and only 
World Series Championship. Third baseman Troy Glaus was named the MVP of 
the Series. 20-year-old rookie relief pitcher Francisco Rodríguez won a 
record five postseason games, despite never having won a regular-season 
game before. Angel pitcher John Lackey became the first rookie pitcher 
to win the seventh game of the World Series in 93 years. The Angels' 2000 
season marked the introduction of a mascot known as the Rally Monkey. The 
whole movement began as a joke by the video crew in the stadium during 
a game where the Angels were trailing the Giants 5–4. A looped clip of 
Ace Ventura: Pet Detective where a monkey jumps up and down was shown on 
the Jumbotron Video Screen with the flashing sign of "Rally Monkey" during 
a pitching change. The Angels went on to win that game, and started to 
build a following as "the comeback kids", most famously exemplified in 
Game 6 of the 2002 World Series (coincidentally against the Giants). On 
May 15, 2003, Disney sold the Angels to Angels Baseball, L.P., a group 
headed by advertising magnate Arturo "Arte" Moreno. The sale made the Angels 
the first major American sports team to be owned by a Hispanic owner and 
also signaled the beginning of the end of Disney's involvement in professional 
sports. The company sold the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim hockey team two years 
later. In December 2003, after a seven-year run as Edison International 
Field of Anaheim, Edison removed its name from the stadium. The stadium 
was renamed Angel Stadium of Anaheim, again almost always referred to as 
simply Angel Stadium or, The Big A, although the original name, Anaheim 
Stadium, is still used by many locals. The stadium is owned by the City 
of Anaheim, which has shown no compunction toward changing the name. Over 
the years, there have been few, if any, complaints from Anaheim officials 
about the dropping of "of Anaheim" from common parlance when referring 
to the stadium. On January 3, 2005 Angels Baseball, L.P. announced that 
it would change the name of the club from Anaheim Angels to Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. As stated in the club's 2005 media guide: The inclusion 
of Los Angeles reflects the original expansion name and returns the Angels 
as Major League Baseball's American League representative in the Greater 
Los Angeles territory. The new name sparked outrage among Anaheim and Los 
Angeles city leaders, who argued that a team that does not play its home 
games within the city or county of Los Angeles should not claim to be from 
Los Angeles, even though the Los Angeles Rams played many years in Anaheim 
without incident. They also regarded the name a lingual farce, as the English 
"The Angels" was mixed with the Spanish "Los Angeles", especially in a 
region where Spanish is so heavily used. With the support of the city of 
Los Angeles, The Walt Disney Company, and every city in Orange County, 
the city of Anaheim sued the Angels, claiming the team violated its lease 
with the city. The team countered that they were in full compliance with 
the lease, since the lease only stipulated that the team name contain "Anaheim", 
and the new name was well within the bounds of this stipulation. A jury 
trial, which concluded February 9, 2006 resulted in a verdict siding with 
the Angels and allowing the team to keep the new name. Although organized 
fan resistance to the new name had subsided, legal challenges to restore 
the name Anaheim Angels went forward.[3][4][5] They were not successful, 
however, and on January 13, 2009, Anaheim mayor Curt Pringle announced 
that the city council had voted unanimously to drop the legal challenge.[6] 
On official press releases, and on the team's website, the entire name 
"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim" is used. In other contexts, the team uses 
simply "Angels" or "Angels Baseball." The team correctly anticipated that 
the national media and baseball fans outside of the Southern California 
media market would simply drop "of Anaheim" and refer to the team as the 
"Los Angeles Angels". When Major League Baseball uses location to identify 
a team, it refers to the Angels as "Los Angeles", as do MLB's member teams[7] 
and many sportscasters. 2003 was a tough year, following the previous season's 
championship. The Angels finished 77-85 in third place and 19 games behind 
A.L. West champions Oakland. However, all was not bleak for the Angels. 
They sent three players to the All-Star Game. Slugging third baseman Troy 
Glaus and veteran outfielder Garret Anderson were in the starting lineup, 
while relief pitcher Brendan Donnelly was selected to be in the bullpen. 
Anderson would go on to win the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award, 
as well as the Home Run Derby, and Donnelly picked up the win in the game. 
From 2004 to the present the Angels have been in the unfamiliar role of 
perennial playoff contender; however, they have not returned to the World 
Series since the 2002 campaign. In 2004, newly acquired free-agent Vladimir 
Guerrero won the American League Most Valuable Player Award as he led the 
Angels to their first American League West championship since 1986. Also 
in 2004, the Angels mounted a comeback to overcome the division leading 
Oakland Athletics in the last week of the regular season, clinching the 
title in the next-to-last game. However, they were swept in the American 
League Division Series 3 games to 0 by the AL Wild Card Boston Red Sox, 
who, after beating their longtime rivals, the New York Yankees, went on 
to win their first World Series since 1918. In the 2005 season, the Halos 
became the first team in the American League to clinch their division, 
doing so with 5 games left in the regular season. It was also the first 
time the team had made the playoffs in back-to-back years. The Angels went 
on in 2005 to beat the AL East champions New York Yankees in the Division 
Series in 5 games, but lost in the American League Championship Series 
to the eventual World Series Champions Chicago White Sox in 5 games. Pitcher 
Bartolo Colón, who went 21–8 for the season, was voted A.L. Cy Young Award 
winner in 2005, only the second Angel to be so honored (Dean Chance won 
the award in 1964). While the Angels were not able to play October baseball, 
several players met or broke individual records in 2006. Closer Francisco 
Rodríguez led the major leagues and broke a franchise record in saves with 
47, and became the youngest closer to record 100 career saves. Scot Shields 
led American League setup men in holds with 31, and was second in the league 
in innings of relief pitched with 87.2 innings. Chone Figgins was second 
in the American League in stolen bases with 52. Jered Weaver tied Whitey 
Ford's American League rookie record by winning the first nine decisions 
of his career. The Angels finished in second place in the American League 
West for the 2006 season, missing the post-season for the first time since 
2003. While a disappointing development for the franchise, the 2006 campaign 
was the Angels' third straight season with a winning record, a first in 
club history. Owner Arte Moreno vowed that the club would make "major" 
changes during the offseason, a comment that generated talk in trades or 
free agent signings of players such as Carlos Lee, Miguel Tejada, Aramis 
Ramírez or perhaps even Alex Rodriguez.[1] Center fielder Gary Matthews, 
Jr. signed a 5-year, $50-million contract in a deal. The 2007 season proved 
to be a success for the Angels. The Angels got off to the best start in 
club history, becoming the first club in the major leagues to win 50 games 
while maintaining a lead in the American League West. Chone Figgins set 
a club record for the most hits in a single month with 53, and became just 
the second Angel to go six-for-six in a single, nine-inning game. Ace John 
Lackey was the first starter in the American League to win ten games. Lackey, 
along with Francisco Rodriguez and Vladimir Guerrero, were chosen to represent 
the Angels at the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco. Guerrero became 
just the third Angel to win the Home Run Derby, and Rodriguez was the first 
to earn a save in an All-Star Game. 2007 was also a resurgent year for 
veteran outfielder Garret Anderson. On August 21, Anderson set a new club 
record for most RBIs in one game with 10 against the New York Yankees. 
He also posted a new Angel record with eleven consecutive games with an 
RBI on September 6 after hitting a single off Indians pitcher Paul Byrd. 
On September 7, Anderson again posted a new Angel record with twelve consecutive 
games with an RBI single against Cleveland's pitcher Jake Westbrook. On 
September 23, 2007 the Angels defeated the Seattle Mariners to clinch the 
championship of the American League West Division. This is the club's sixth 
division title and seventh overall playoff berth in its history. The Angels 
were unable to follow up their success in the regular season with playoff 
success, as the club, depleted by injuries, was swept by the AL East champions 
Boston Red Sox in the ALDS. After the 2007 playoff campaign ended, general 
manager Bill Stoneman retired and was replaced by Tony Reagins. Reagins 
quickly made two headline roster moves: the acquisition of free agent outfielder 
Torii Hunter, previously of the Minnesota Twins, as well as the trade of 
shortstop Orlando Cabrera to the Chicago White Sox for starting pitcher 
Jon Garland. Though hampered by injuries on Opening Day 2008 (including 
to veteran starting pitcher John Lackey), the Angels had the best record 
in the American League (tied with the Chicago Cubs for best record in MLB) 
going into the All-Star break. On July 20, closer Francisco Rodríguez accumulated 
40 saves in 98 team games, becoming the fastest pitcher to accumulate 40 
saves since John Smoltz did so in 108 team games in 2003. Rodríguez broke 
Bobby Thigpen's all-time record for saves in a season on September 13 in 
a game against the Seattle Mariners and eventually finished with 62 saves.[8] 
The Angels made another headline trade on July 29, acquiring first baseman 
Mark Teixeira from the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Casey Kotchman and 
minor league pitcher Stephen Marek. On September 10, 2008 with a win over 
the New York Yankees and a loss by the Texas Rangers to the Seattle Mariners, 
the Angels clinched their seventh American League West Division title. 
By clinching on September 10, the Angels set a new mark for the earliest 
clinch date in American League West history.[9] They would finish the 2008 
regular season setting a franchise record for wins at 100, breaking the 
previous club record of 99 wins set by the 2002 World Series championship 
team. For the second straight year, the Angels faced off against the Boston 
Red Sox (AL Wild Card) in the ALDS, but were unable to advance, losing 
the series 3 games to 1. As the Angels' much-lauded rotation was set to 
return for 2009, injuries suddenly plagued John Lackey and Ervin Santana, 
while Kelvim Escobar was experiencing setbacks to his long-awaited return. 
This caused the Angels to add long-relievers Dustin Moseley and Shane Loux 
to the rotation, as well as call up top prospect Nick Adenhart to the rotation. 
These injuries left the Opening Day start to Joe Saunders, who pitched 
a dominating game against the Oakland Athletics to start the season. Two 
days later, Nick Adenhart made his first start of the season, pitching 
six shutout innings before being pulled from the game. Hours later, he 
and two other friends were killed in a hit-and-run crash. Adenhart's death 
was a shock to the team and to all baseball fans nationwide. It caused 
the next day's game to be postponed, and the Angels' April 10 game against 
the Boston Red Sox became a tribute to Adenhart. After Adenhart's death, 
this left another gap in the rotation, which led to reliever Darren Oliver 
taking his place. Shortly after, Moseley would become injured, resulting 
in minor leaguer Matt Palmer being called up. Palmer would claim six victories 
in his first eight starts before his first loss on June 29, cementing him 
a spot in the rotation, while Escobar would make only one start after returning 
from the disabled list before becoming reinjured. Moseley (who would almost 
immediately injure himself) and Loux, after paltry beginnings to their 
season, would reclaim their long-relief spots as Lackey and Santana returned. 
However, Santana once again became injured, and minor leaguer Sean O'Sullivan 
took his place, creating a masterful debut of his own, winning his first 
two starts in dominating appearances. Amid all of the pitching rotation 
chaos, outfielder Torii Hunter quietly took the place as leader of the 
Angels' offense, with a powerful April where he hit eight home runs, then 
third in the American League. Offseason addition Bobby Abreu had a modest 
start to the season before making a powerful presence in June. The Angels 
were originally to send two players, Hunter and closer Brian Fuentes, to 
the All-Star Game. However, with just days before the game, Hunter was 
sent to the disabled list with a groin injury, effectively removing him 
from the All-Star Game. The team's offensive catalyst, Chone Figgins, was 
eligible for the All-Star Game Final Vote, but placed third. However, he 
would later be added to the roster the morning of the game to replace injured 
Tampa Bay Rays slugger Evan Longoria. As the non-waiver trade deadline 
of July 31 loomed, the Angels were seen as big contenders for Heath Bell, 
Cliff Lee and even Roy Halladay; however, all of these rumors fell through. 
Nearly a month later, however, on August 29, two days before the waiver 
trade deadline, the Angels acquired Tampa Bay Rays ace Scott Kazmir, in 
exchange for two low-level minor leaguers and prized prospect Sean Rodriguez. 
Ervin Santana shut-out the Texas Rangers for the West Division Title on 
September 28, 2009. For the third straight year, the Angels faced the Boston 
Red Sox (the AL Wild Card) in the ALDS. Despite being 0–4 in playoff series 
against the Red Sox and having lost 12 of the last 13 post-season games 
against them, the Angels swept the series 3–0. The Angels next faced the 
New York Yankees in the ALCS, but went on to lose the series 4 games to 
2. The Angels entered the 2009 offseason with countless question marks, 
most notably if they would retain pitching ace John Lackey and fan favorite 
Chone Figgins. The answer to both of these questions was no, as Lackey 
and Figgins signed with Boston and Seattle respectively. The Angels were, 
once again, big players to acquire Toronto ace Roy Halladay in the winter, 
and were rumored to have offered a package of Joe Saunders, Erick Aybar 
and Peter Bourjos for Halladay, but the Jays instead sent Halladay to two-time 
defending National League champion Philadelphia for three prospects. The 
Angels' next plan was to acquire Phillies ace Cliff Lee, but just hours 
after Halladay was dealt, Lee was traded to Seattle for a prospect package. 
On this same action-packed day, the Angels signed reigning 2009 World Series 
MVP Hideki Matsui to a one-year, $6.5 million contract, effectively spelling 
the end of longtime fan favorite Vladimir Guerrero's time with the Angels. 
On Christmas Eve, the team signed Detroit reliever Fernando Rodney to a 
two-year, $11 million deal, doing so after the loss of reliever Darren 
Oliver, who would sign with division rival Texas. The Angels headed into 
2010 with an uncertain roster, similar to how they entered the 2009 season. 
The Angels got off to a mediocre start to the season in April; however, 
things looked to be turning around near the end of May, as slugging first 
baseman Kendry Morales was on pace to top his home run totals from 2009. 
However, on May 29, in a game against the Seattle Mariners, Morales hit 
a walk-off grand slam to give the Angels a 5–1 victory; this victory was 
quite bittersweet, as Morales broke his leg jumping on home plate. This 
would send Morales to the disabled list for the remainder of the 2010 season. 
Although the Angels stormed to a record of 18–9 in the month of June, the 
team never quite recovered from the loss of Morales, as they posted three 
consecutive sub-.500 months from July to September. However, the team did 
not back down without a fight. On July 22, the team acquired third baseman 
Alberto Callaspo from the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Sean O'Sullivan 
and a pitching prospect. Although this move received mild criticism, general 
manager Tony Reagins certainly silenced the critics three days later, on 
July 25; it was on that day that he pulled off a trade with the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. The Angels acquired ace starting pitcher Dan Haren in exchange 
for pitchers Joe Saunders and Rafael Rodríguez, and prospects Patrick Corbin 
and Tyler Skaggs; it is notable that all four pitchers the Angels sent 
in return are left-handed pitchers. Haren added certainty to an already-strong 
rotation, posting an earned run average of 2.87; however, due to poor run 
support from the Angels' anemic offense, Haren posted a win–loss record 
of 5–4 in his 14 starts with the team. Attempting to replace Morales' bat, 
at least for the short term, the Angels nearly had a trade in place for 
Chicago Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee; however, even though the two parties 
agreed on the terms of the deal and were ready to pull the trigger, Lee 
invoked his no-trade clause, and the deal was nixed. This move on Lee's 
part proved fatal for the Angels, as they never did find the right bat 
to replace Morales, ending the season with a record of 80–82, in third 
place and ten games behind the division champion (and eventually American
