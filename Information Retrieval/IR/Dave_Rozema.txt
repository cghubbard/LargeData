David Scott Rozema [rose'-muh] (born August 5, 1956) is a former pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played from 1977 through 1986 for the Detroit 
Tigers and Texas Rangers. Listed at 6' 4", 185 lb., Rozema batted and threw 
right handed. He was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 'Rosey', as he was 
nicknamed, was originally selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 22nd 
round of the 1974 MLB Draft, but he decided to stay at school. He then 
played for Grand Rapids Community College in 1974 and was drafted in January 
1975 by the Detroit Tigers. In 1976, Rozema played for the Montgomery Rebels 
in the Tigers' farm system and led the Southern League pitchers with a 
1.57 earned run average.[1] The Rebels were 86-51 in 1976 and won the league 
championship. Rozema debuted in the major leagues at age 20 with the Detroit 
Tigers in 1977. On April 21, he shut out the Boston Red Sox, 8â€“0, for his 
first major league win. He finished his rookie season with a 15-7 record 
and a 3.09 ERA, ending eighth in the voting for the American League Cy 
Young Award, while ranking third in the league in winning percentage (.682), 
fifth in adjusted ERA+ (138), sixth in strikeout-to-walk ratio (2.71) and 
eight in complete games (16). That season, Rozema finished fourth in the 
Rookie of the Year voting behind Baltimore Orioles' Eddie Murray, being 
selected by The Sporting News as the Rookie Pitcher of the Year. Besides, 
Rozema formed part of a distinguished group of rookies with the 1977 Tigers 
that included Jack Morris, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker, Lance Parrish and 
Steve Kemp. After a promising rookie year, Rozema never won more than nine 
games in a season. In 1978, he finished with a 9-12 record, 11 complete 
games and an adjusted ERA+ of 124. In 1979, he again had an above-average 
adjusted ERA+ of 124, but he started only 16 games and had a record of 
4-4. Afterwards, Rozema's ERA fell off to a rate only slightly better than 
the league average, as he won six games in 1980 and five in 1981. Rozema 
got off to a tremendous start in 1982, compiling a 3-0 record and an ERA 
of 1.63 (adjusted ERA+ of 248) in his first eight games. In a televised 
game against the Minnesota Twins on May 14, a bench-clearing brawl erupted 
after Twins pitchers hit both Chet Lemon and Enos Cabell. Rozema then came 
running out of the dugout and attempted to deliver a flying karate kick 
to the Twins' John Castino, but he missed Castino and tore eight ligaments 
in his knee. As a result, Rozema had to be carried off the field on a stretcher. 
He required a knee surgery the next day and was put on the disabled list 
for the rest of the 1982 season.[2] In October 2006, Sports Illustrated 
selected Rozema as one of the "10 Greatest Characters in Detroit Tigers 
History". His selection was based on (1) the "karate kick" misfire, (2) 
a subsequent injury the same year in which Rozema fell on a flask in his 
back pocket and needed 11 stitches in his hip, (3) an incident in which 
he shoved a bar glass into the face of teammate Alan Trammell resulting 
in 47 stitches near Trammell's eye, (4) missing a team bus when he overslept 
after judging a wet T-shirt contest, and (5) using Brillo pads to wash 
his new car.[3] On July 9, 2008, the minor league team in Rozema's home 
town, the West Michigan Whitecaps, gave away an unusual promotional item, 
"Dave Rozema Karate Kick Bobbleleg" figures.[4] Rozema came back from the 
injury in 1983 with an 8-3 record and 3.43 ERA in 105 innings pitched. 
In addition, he played on the 1984 Tigers team that won the World Series. 
During the regular season, he started 16 games, compiling a 7-6 record 
with a 3.74 ERA in 101 innings pitched, but did not appear in the post-season. 
On December 27, 1984, Rozema signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers 
a contract for an estimated total of $500,000 to $600,000.[5] He appeared 
in 34 games for the Rangers in 1985 (all but four in relief) and had a 
4.19 ERA in 88 innings pitched. After compiling a 5.91 ERA at the start 
of the 1986 season, Rozema was released by the Rangers during the midseason. 
He then was signed as a free agent by the Chicago White Sox on May 20, 
1986, but did not play for them. In a 10-season career, Rozema posted a 
60-53 record with a 3.47 ERA in 248 pitching appearances (132 starts), 
striking out 448 batters while walking 258 in 1106 innings of work. In 
the early 1990s, Rozema pitched for the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the 
Senior Professional Baseball Association, and with the London Majors of 
the Intercounty Baseball League based in London, Ontario, Canada. On December 
22, 1985, Rozema and his former teammate Kirk Gibson married sisters, JoAnn 
and Sandy Sklarski in a double ceremony at Grosse Pointe Memorial Church 
in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. In 2003, Crain's Detroit Business reported 
that Rozema was working as a salesman for Disposal Management LLC of Bloomfield 
Hills, Michigan, selling the company's services to waste generators in 
the Detroit area.[6] Beginning in 2014, Rozema began appearing on the History 
Channel series American Pickers. In addition to picking, he was presented
