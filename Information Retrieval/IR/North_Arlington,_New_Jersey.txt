North Arlington is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 15,392,[8] 
reflecting an increase of 211 (+1.4%) from the 15,181 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 1,391 (+10.1%) from the 13,790 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] As the site of Holy Cross Cemetery, which has interred 
almost 290,000 individuals since its establishment in 1915, and with another 
Jewish cemetery including several thousand more burials, North Arlington 
has more than 20 times as many dead people than living, with more burials 
than the living population of Newark, the state's largest city. Holy Cross 
has an average of 2,600 interments each year, of which about 65% are burials, 
with the remainder split between entombment in mausoleums or crypts and 
burial of cremated remains. Expansion of the mausoleum will bring its capacity 
to nearly 36,000 interments, with the cemetery's total capacity of about 
750,000 expected to last past the year 2090. The cemetery covers 208 acres 
(84 ha) and was assessed at $185 million, though its non-profit status 
means that the municipality generates no tax revenue from a property that 
covers almost an eighth of the borough's land area.[20][21] North Arlington 
was formed by a referendum passed on March 9, 1896, and incorporated as 
a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 11, 1896, from 
area taken from Union Township.[22] It was called North Arlington because 
it was north of the Arlington section of Kearny, which had been named from 
the Arlington Station on the Erie Railroad.[23] North Arlington was originally 
part of an area called "New Barbadoes Neck".[24] Copper was mined at the 
Schuyler Copper Mine here in the 18th and 19th centuries.[25] It was one 
of the first true copper mines in North America. In 1755, the first steam 
engine in North American was assembled in North Arlington.[26] The Newcomen 
steam engine was imported from England by John Schuyler to pump water out 
of his copper mine. He hired engineer Josiah Hornblower to assemble the 
machinery.[27] North Arlington, together with Lyndhurst and Rutherford 
was the site of the EnCap project, an effort to remediate landfills on 
the 785-acre (3.18 km2) site and construct homes and golf courses on top 
of the cleaned up site. On May 27, 2008, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission 
terminated its agreement with EnCap Golf Holdings, the company that had 
the contract to redevelop the site, after the company had missed targets 
to clean up the landfills as part of the project.[28] According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.623 square

Arlington is governed under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. 
The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising 
six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan 
basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly 
by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists 
of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, 
with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[6] 
The Borough form of government used by North Arlington, the most common 
system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government 
in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding 
at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[47][48] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of North Arlington Borough 
is Republican Joseph P. Bianchi, whose term of office ends on December 
31, 2018. Members of the North Arlington Borough Council are Council President

2018), Mario Karcic Jr. (R, 2016; elected to serve an unexpired term) and 
Allison Sheedy (R, 2018).[3][49][50][51][52][53] In January 2015, the borough 
council selected Brian Fitzhenry from a list of three candidates nominated 
by the Republican municipal committee to fill the council seat that was 
vacated by Joseph Bianchi when he took office as mayor; Fitzhenry would 
serve on an interim basis until the November 2015 election.[54] Republicans 
swept the November 2015 general election, giving the party full control 
of municipal government. Brian Fitzhenry and Allison Sheedy were elected 
to full three-year terms, while Mario Karcic Jr., was elected to fill the 
balance of Joseph Bianchi's council seat expiring in 2016.[55] Peter Norcia 
was appointed in February 2013 to fill the vacant seat of Steve Tanelli,
