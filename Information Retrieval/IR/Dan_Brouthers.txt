Dennis Joseph "Dan" Brouthers (/ˈbruːθərz/;[1] May 8, 1858 – August 2, 
1932) was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball whose career 
spanned the period from 1879 to 1896, with a brief return in 1904. Nicknamed 
"Big Dan" for his size, he was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and weighed 207 
pounds (94 kg), which was large by 19th-century standards.[2] Recognized 
as the first great slugger in baseball history,[3] and among the greatest 
sluggers of his era, he held the record for career home runs from 1887 
to 1889,[4] with his final total of 106 tying for the fourth most of the 
19th century. His career slugging percentage of .519 remained the Major 
League record for a player with at least 4,000 at bats until Ty Cobb edged 
ahead of him in 1922. At the time of his initial retirement, he also ranked 
second in career triples (205), and third in runs batted in (1,296) and 
hits.[5] A dominant hitter during the prime of his career, he led (or was 
in the top of) the league in most offensive categories, including batting 
average, runs scored, runs batted in (RBI), on-base percentage and hits. 
He led the league in batting average five times, the most by a 19th-century 
player, and his career .342 batting average still ranks ninth all-time. 
Brouthers is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date who have 
appeared in Major League games in four decades. He was also an active players' 
union member, and was elected vice president of the Brotherhood of Professional 
Base Ball Players. Brouthers was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1945 by the Veterans Committee. Born in Sylvan Lake, New York,[6] he played 
organized baseball from the time that he was a child, from playing in the 
local sandlots[7] to the semi-professional Actives of Wappingers Falls, 
New York. On July 7, 1877, while running the bases, he collided at home 
plate with a catcher, named Johnny Quigley, of the Clippers of Harlem. 
Quigley was knocked unconscious, having suffered a traumatic head injury, 
and later died from these injuries on August 12. The 19-year-old Brouthers 
was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities.[8] Brouthers made his 
Major League debut on June 23, 1879, for the Troy Trojans, and contributed 
a single in a come-from-behind victory against the Syracuse Stars.[8] Although 
he was a first baseman, he was called upon to pitch that season with the 
Trojans in three games, one of which was on August 21 against Tommy Bond 
and the Boston Red Caps. Brouthers lost 16–0, and within two weeks he was 
released from the club.[8] He hit .274 that first season, with four home 
runs, and had 17 RBIs in 39 games played.[6] After his release, Brouthers 
played for a minor league team in Rochester, New York, and on one occasion 
in 1880, he hit a game-winning home run in an exhibition game versus the 
Buffalo Bisons, off future Hall of Fame pitcher Pud Galvin.[8] He hit well 
enough in the minors to get another shot with the Trojans, which lasted 
just three games when he had only two hits in 12 at bats, and he was released 
again.[9] He got his first chance to be an everyday player in 1881, when 
he was signed by the Bisons, the team that he did well against the previous 
year. That season he batted .319, and played with them until the team folded 
after the 1885 season. In his first season with the Bisons, he led the 
National League (NL) in home runs and slugging percentage.[8] Brouthers, 
along with teammates Jack Rowe, Hardy Richardson and Deacon White, became 
known as the "Big Four".[8] In 1882 and 1883 he won his first two batting 
titles, posting .368 and .374 averages, respectively. Along with his two 
batting titles, during his time in Buffalo he also led the NL in slugging 
five times, hits and total bases twice each, and triples and RBIs once 
each,[9] with his 1883 total of 97 RBIs setting a new Major League record; 
Cap Anson had set the previous mark of 83 the year before, and retook the 
record the following year with a total of 102. On July 19, 1883, Brouthers 
went 6-for-6 with two doubles in a 25–5 defeat of the Philadelphia Quakers.[8] 
At the end of the 1885 season, Buffalo was going through financial trouble 
and were forced to sell off their players, so "The Big Four" were sold 
to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL for US$7,000.[9] In 1886, his first 
season in Detroit, he again led the league in slugging percentage, the 
sixth year in a row, and led the league in total bases and doubles and 
claimed his first home run title. He finished within the top 10 in most 
offensive categories, including a third-place finish in the batting race 
with a lofty .370 average.[9] On September 10, 1886, Brouthers hit three 
home runs‚ along with a double and a single, to set the NL record with 
15 total bases in one game. This mark tied the Major League record at the 
time, as Guy Hecker of the Louisville Colonels totaled 15 the previous 
month in the American Association.[8] The Detroit team was filled with 
stars from the era, including future Hall of Famers Sam Thompson and Ned 
Hanlon, as well as second baseman Fred Dunlap, the "Big Four", and the 
pitching of Lady Baldwin and Charlie Getzien.[10] The team finished with 
a record of 87 wins and 36 losses, but finished in second place behind 
the Chicago White Stockings by 2 1⁄2 games.[11] During the off-season, 
on November 11, 1886, The Executive Council of the Brotherhood of Professional 
Base Ball Players‚ formed in 1885 as the first organized players' union, 
met and re-elected John Montgomery Ward as president, and elected Brouthers 
as vice president.[8] In 1887, with the 1886 roster intact,[12] the Wolverines 
finished in first place, besting the Quakers by 3 1⁄2 games. Brouthers 
batted .338, and led the league in runs scored with 153, doubles with 36, 
and on-base percentage, while again finishing in the top 10 in most offensive 
categories.[9] The Wolverines, behind the bats of Brouthers, Thompson and 
Richardson, led the League in batting, runs scored and slugging,[13] and 
went on to face the St. Louis Browns in a best-of-15 post-season tournament, 
the "World's Series". The Wolverines sealed a series championship with 
their eighth victory in 11 games; however, the two teams finished the series 
anyway, with Detroit winning 10 games to the Browns' five.[8][14] Brouthers 
only played in one of those games, getting two hits in three at bats.[15] 
Following the season, on November 17, 1887, members of the NL officially 
recognized the Brotherhood and met with a Brotherhood committee that consisted 
of three players – Ward‚ Hanlon and Brouthers.[8] The 1888 Detroit team 
did not fare as well, finishing in fifth place with a record of 68–63, 
which was a full 16 games behind the first-place New York Giants.[16] Brouthers' 
numbers declined as well, as he did not produce at the same level of his 
previous seasons. Even with the lower numbers, he still led the league 
in runs scored with 118, and doubles for the third year in a row.[9] The 
team's decline is attributed to prolonged injuries sustained by key players, 
while turmoil that unfolded concerning veteran stars' salary demands, and 
with falling attendance numbers, the club was forced to fold at the season's 
end.[13] Brouthers was then purchased by the Boston Beaneaters of the NL 
on October 16.[9] In 1889, his only season with the Beaneaters, he batted 
a league-leading .373, along with 105 runs scored and 118 runs batted in; 
he struck out only six times.[9] The first strikeout occurred on June 11, 
when he fell victim to Mickey Welch of the Giants.[8] After the season, 
he – along with many Major League players – jumped to the Players' League, 
a league established by the Brotherhood which competed against the two 
other Major Leagues already in existence.[17] Brouthers signed with the 
Boston Reds, and batted .330 while leading the league in on-base percentage 
and slugging.[6] The Reds, behind the talents of Brouthers, Harry Stovey, 
Hardy Richardson, Charles Radbourn and player-manager King Kelly,[18] finished 
in first place, 6 1⁄2 games ahead of the Brooklyn Ward's Wonders.[19] The 
Players' League lasted just the one season, and the Reds merged into the 
American Association, carrying many of the championship team's previous 
players.[20] Again, the team won the league's championship, finishing 8 1⁄2 
games ahead of the St. Louis Browns.[21] Brouthers led the league in batting 
average (.350), on-base percentage and slugging, while finishing second 
in triples with 19, sixth in doubles with 26, and third in RBIs with 109.[9] 
After the American Association folded following the 1891 season, Brouthers 
was sent to the Brooklyn Grooms of the NL,[9] where he played two seasons. 
Most of his success came in that first season, when he led the league in 
batting average, hits, RBIs and total bases.[9] For the 1893 season, he 
played in only 77 of the team's games, but did well, hitting .337.[9] After 
the season, Brouthers was traded along with Willie Keeler to the Baltimore 
Orioles for Billy Shindle and George Treadway.[8] This trade brought in 
two future Hall of Fame players, which added to the already established 
Orioles core of players including third baseman John McGraw, catcher Wilbert 
Robinson, shortstop Hughie Jennings, and center fielder Joe Kelley, all 
future Hall of Fame members.[22] The Orioles won the league's championship 
that season, and it was Brouthers' last full season in the majors, as he 
again produced great numbers, batting .347, finishing seventh in total 
bases, fifth in RBIs (128), fourth in doubles (39), and fifth in triples 
(23).[9] During his career, and most notably during his time in Baltimore, 
he was known to always have his dog, an Irish setter named Kelly, and had 
him sit in the players' area. It is claimed that the players never minded 
much, as he was very well-behaved and never left the area to run out on 
the field or made very much noise.[23] Early in the 1895 season, Baltimore 
sold Brouthers to the Louisville Colonels for $500, as his skills seemed 
to have diminished, and he only played in 24 of Louisville's games that 
season; he came back to hit .309 for them, ending the year with a .300 
overall mark.[9] Following the season, Louisville sold him to the Philadelphia 
Phillies for $500, where he played in 57 games in 1896, batting .344.[9] 
It was his last season in the majors until he appeared for the 1904 New 
York Giants, where he was hitless in a two-game stint before retiring.[9] 
Brouthers is still among the all-time leaders in many offensive categories. 
His .342 batting average ranks ninth, 205 triples ranks eighth, and his 
.423 on-base percentage ranks 15th.[9] He is tied with Mike Tiernan for 
fourth among 19th-century home run hitters with a total of 106, behind 
Roger Connor (138), Sam Thompson (127) and Stovey (122).[24] Brouthers 
played minor league baseball for the 1898 Toronto Maple Leafs of the Eastern 
League, where he won a batting title with a .415 average.[2] Later he played 
for the Poughkeepsie, New York, team of the Hudson River League, batting 
a league-leading .373 at age 46.[7] He remained near baseball for many 
years, working for his former teammate and New York Giants manager John 
McGraw, who placed him in charge of the Polo Grounds press gate.[2] He 
was with the Giants for nearly 20 years in this and other capacities.[7] 
Brouthers died at the age of 74 of a heart attack[25] in East Orange, New 
Jersey, and is interred at Saint Mary's Cemetery in Wappingers Falls, New 
York.[6] There is a statue dedicated to him located in Veteran's Park in 
this small village.[26] In 1945, Brouthers and several other stars of the 
era prior to 1910 were elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans 
Committee.[2][3] In honor of his achievements in Buffalo, he was inducted 
into the newly formed Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.[27] In 1999, 
a survey of the Society for American Baseball Research ranked him as the
