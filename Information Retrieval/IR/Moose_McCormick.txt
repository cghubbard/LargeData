Harry Elwood "Moose" McCormick (February 28, 1881 â€“ July 9, 1962), was 
a professional baseball outfielder. He played all or part of five seasons 
in Major League Baseball between 1904 and 1913 for the New York Giants, 
Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies. McCormick also served in 
the United States Army during World War I, and as a civilian director of 
the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Under manager John 
McGraw of the Giants, he was one of the first pinch hitters in the game's 
history, and was considered one of the best pinch hitters in the game.[1] 
McCormick's father worked in the Philadelphia Gas Works, while his mother 
raised their five children. McCormick's father died when he was five years 
old, making him legally an orphan under Pennsylvania laws, and eligible 
to attend Girard College.[2] In high school, McCormick excelled in both 
baseball and American football. He got his nickname from classmates because 
of his large size.[2] McCormick graduated from Girard College in 1898, 
and enrolled at Bucknell University, where he played baseball, American 
football, basketball, and track and field for the Bucknell Bison.[2] He 
succeeded future Giants teammate Christy Mathewson as Bucknell's starting 
fullback.[3] Rather than graduating with his class at Bucknell in 1904, 
he left Bucknell to play minor league baseball for the Jersey City Skeeters 
of the Eastern League in 1903. He joined the New York Giants of the National 
League in Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1904. McCormick was traded to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a three-team trade, with the Pirates 
sending Jimmy Sebring to the Cincinnati Reds and the Reds sending Mike 
Donlin to the Giants. After the season, the Pirates traded McCormick to 
the Philadelphia Phillies with Kitty Bransfield and Otto Krueger for Del 
Howard. However, McCormick stopped playing baseball, working as a steel 
salesman for the next three years.[2] McCormick returned to baseball in 
1908. After appearing in eleven games for the Phillies, batting .091, the 
Phillies sold McCormick to the Giants.[2] McGraw decided to use McCormick 
as a pinch hitter due to his lack of speed.[2] While rounding third base 
during a game, Cy Seymour, who was coaching third base, tackled McCormick. 
When Giants manager John McGraw inquired, Seymour made an excuse about 
having the sun in his eyes.[4] This led McGraw, now realizing the need 
for a full-time coach, to hire Arlie Latham for the role, the first full-time 
base coach in MLB.[5][6] McCormick scored the potential winning run in 
the infamous 1908 Merkle game. The run was eventually nullified, the game 
ended in a tie, and the Giants lost the pennant by a single game.[2] McCormick 
again worked as a salesman in 1910 and 1911. He returned to MLB to play 
for the Giants in 1912 and 1913. He retired after the 1913 season.[2] McCormick 
managed the Chattanooga Lookouts in 1914 and 1915.[7] He worked for the 
Hess Steel Company in Baltimore, Maryland after his retirement. In 1917, 
he enlisted in the United States Army. He fought in France as a first lieutenant 
and captain in the 167th Infantry Regiment of the 42nd Infantry Division, 
known as the "Rainbow Division", during World War I.[2][3] He then coached 
the Bucknell Bison baseball team in 1923 through 1925, and the Army Black 
Knights baseball team in 1928.[8] McCormick remained with the military, 
serving as a civilian director in the United States Army Air Forces during 
World War II.[3] After the war, he served as Bucknell's director of housing.[9] 
He died in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1962.[2] McCormick was inducted
