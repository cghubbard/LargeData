Neal James Cotts (born March 25, 1980) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher who is currently a free agent.[1] He has played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, 
Milwaukee Brewers, and Minnesota Twins. Cotts attended Illinois State University 
where he won first-team All-Missouri Valley Conference honors and was named 
to the ABCA All-Midwest Region team. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics 
69th overall in the 2nd round of the 2001 draft, becoming the second highest 
player drafted in the history of Illinois State. Neal finished his collegiate 
career ranked fifth all-time in school history in strikeouts with 263 in 
just three seasons with the Redbirds. Cotts spent the 2002 season at Single-A 
Modesto of the California League, winning 12 games in 28 starts. During 
the off-season, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox in a six-player 
deal involving relief pitchers Billy Koch and Keith Foulke. Cotts began 
the 2003 season ranked as the number three prospect in the White Sox farm 
system. He started his year at Double-A Birmingham, of the Southern League, 
going 9–6 with a 2.12 ERA and 131 strikeouts. In July 2003, he started 
for the United States in Major League Baseball's Futures Game. Cotts made 
his Major League debut for Chicago on August 12, 2003, when he started 
against the Anaheim Angels. He pitched 2.1 innings and allowed two runs, 
two hits, and six walks. He received a no-decision in the game. On August 
22, he won his first game when he pitched five innings and allowed five 
hits against the Texas Rangers. He ended the season with a record of 1–1 
and an 8.10 ERA. In 2004, new manager Ozzie Guillén inserted Cotts into 
the bullpen. He finished April with a 0.90 ERA, but from May–July had an 
ERA of 8.28. He finished the season with 65.1 innings pitched, a 4–4 record, 
and an ERA of 5.65. On June 18, he got his first major league hit, a double, 
off Luis Ayala of the Montreal Expos. In 2005, Cotts went 4–0 while appearing 
in 69 games, throwing 60.1 innings, compiling a 1.94 ERA, striking out 
58, and yielding just 1 home run. MLB.com awarded him the "Setup Man of 
the Year Award", an award determined by fan voting. In the American League 
Championship Series, he was the only White Sox reliever to appear in Chicago's 
4–1 series win, throwing 2/3 of an inning in Game 1. Cotts pitched in all 
four games of the World Series and was the winning pitcher in Game 2. On 
November 16, 2006, Cotts was traded to the Chicago Cubs for relief pitcher 
David Aardsma and minor league pitcher Carlos Vásquez. On May 21, 2007, 
the Cubs optioned Cotts to Triple-A Iowa, recalling left-handed pitcher 
Sean Marshall. On December 13, 2007, the Cubs re-signed Cotts to a one-year 
contract for $800,000.[2] He began the 2008 season in AAA, as he'd ended 
the previous season. He would be recalled from AAA, however, in May and 
remained with Cubs as their primary left handed reliever after the club 
had traded away veteran pitcher Scott Eyre. In 2009, Cotts started with 
the Cubs, but was demoted to the team's AAA minor league Iowa club in May. 
On June 24, he felt a sharp pain while pitching for Iowa, and his season 
was over with an elbow ligament injury. He underwent successful Tommy John 
surgery in July 2009.[3] He was non-tendered on December 12 and became 
a free agent. On January 4, 2010, Cotts signed a minor-league contract 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates with an invite to spring training. In June 
2010, he had the first of four surgeries on his hip ending his comeback 
bid for the season. On September 17, 2010, the Pirates released him. On 
November 22, 2010, Cotts signed a minor league contract with the New York 
Yankees with an invitation to 2011 spring training.[4][5] Due to the results 
of his physical, the Yankees released him on February 16, 2011.[6] For 
the second straight season, he did not pitch professionally. Cotts signed 
with the Texas Rangers and was in contention in spring training to return 
to the Major Leagues, but suffered an arm strain injury. He finally appeared 
in a professional game for the first time since 2009 on June 11, 2012, 
pitching for the Texas Rangers' Triple-A affiliate Round Rock. He finished 
the season with Round Rock posting a 4.55 ERA with 3 saves while striking 
out 41 in 31.2 innings. On November 12, 2012, Cotts signed a minor league 
deal with an invitation to spring training to return to the Rangers organization.[7] 
He failed to make the Rangers out of spring training in 2013 and rejoined 
Round Rock. He posted a 0.78 ERA with a 3–1 record and was promoted to 
the Rangers on May 21, 2013.[8] After a nearly four-year absence from the 
Major Leagues, he threw six pitches against Oakland on May 21. His agent 
Joe Bick said, "When he went back to the mound that first time, I had a 
lump the size of a softball in my throat."[9] He said of his return to 
the Major Leagues, "There's a point where you go through all of it where 
you don't know if you're ever going to play again; I never was really accepting 
of that."[10] He became a left-handed specialist for the Rangers bullpen. 
However, he had better platoon splits against right-handed batters than 
left-handed batters after joining the Rangers. In 2013, he held opposing 
right-handed batters to a measly .436 on-base plus slugging (OPS) percentage 
while left-handed hitters had a .565 OPS. Cotts returned to the Rangers 
in 2014 and pitched in a career high 73 games. However, he was not as effective 
as he was the year before. He was granted free agency after the season 
and was not re-signed by the club. On January 29, 2015, Cotts signed a 
one-year, $3 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers.[11] On August 
21, 2015, Cotts was traded to the Minnesota Twins for a player to be named 
later or cash considerations.[12] In 68 appearances split between the Brewers 
and Twins, he was 1-0 with a 3.41 ERA in 63.1 innings while striking out 
8.2 and walking 3.1 per nine innings. On February 26, 2016, Cotts signed 
a minor league contract with the Houston Astros. He was released in March 
and signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim,[13] 
where he began the year with Triple-A Salt Lake. On May 17, he exercised 
an opt-out clause in his contract and became a free agent.[14] On May 20, 
2016, Cotts signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees and 
was assigned to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.[15] On June 20, 2016, 
Cotts signed a minor league contract to return to the Texas Rangers organization[16]
