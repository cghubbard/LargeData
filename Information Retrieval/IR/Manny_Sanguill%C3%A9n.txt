Manuel De Jesus Sanguillén Magan, better known as Manny Sanguillén or "Sangy" 
(born March 21, 1944 in Colón, Panama), is a former professional baseball 
player who was a catcher in the Major Leagues.[1] He was named to the All-Star 
team three times, in 1971, 1972, and 1975.[1] He played primarily for the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, but also for the Oakland Athletics in 1977. With the 
Pirates, he won the 1971 World Series and the 1979 World Series, both over 
the Baltimore Orioles. Sanguillen's lifetime batting average of .296 is 
the fourth highest by a catcher since World War II, and tenth highest for 
catchers in Major League Baseball history.[2] Although he was often overshadowed 
by his contemporary, Johnny Bench, Sanguillén was considered one of the 
best catchers in Major League baseball in the early 1970s.[3][4] While 
he didn't possess Bench's power hitting ability, Sanguillen hit for a higher 
batting average.[3][5] He was an integral member of the Pirates teams that 
won three consecutive National League Eastern Division pennants between 
1970 and 1972, and a World Series victory in 1971.[5] Sanguillen was also 
a fast baserunner for a catcher and was a good defensive player with a 
strong throwing arm.[6] Sanguillen was notorious for being a "bad-ball" 
hitter.[5] Most pitchers will try to strike out an aggressive, free-swinging 
hitter by forcing him to swing at pitches outside the strike zone when 
he has two strikes on him. Sanguillen often irritated opposing pitchers 
and managers by hitting bad pitches for base hits.[5] He rarely walked, 
and was the only player since 1900 with at least six straight seasons with 
475 plate appearances and fewer than 22 walks.[citation needed] This was 
also why, in spite of his high batting average, his on-base percentage 
was lower than the league average over his career.[citation needed] After 
playing for three years in the minor leagues, Sanguillen joined the Pirates 
in 1967, playing in 30 games.[1] He played another season in the minor 
leagues in 1968, before returning to the Major Leagues in 1969. He replaced 
Jerry May as the Pirates starting catcher and posted a .303 batting average.[1] 
He solidified his reputation as one of the top hitting catchers in baseball 
by hitting for a .325 batting average in 1970, finishing third in the National 
League batting championship behind Rico Carty and Joe Torre.[7] Sanguillen 
was a valuable member of the world champion 1971 Pirates. He had his best 
year in terms of offensive production by hitting for a .319 batting average, 
while hitting 7 home runs and 81 runs batted in.[1] He also had his best 
year defensively, finishing third among National League catchers in games 
caught (135), second in base runners caught stealing (37), caught stealing 
percentage (51.4%), fielding percentage (.994) and first in assists (72).[8] 
The Pirates won the National League Eastern Division pennant by 7 games 
over the St. Louis Cardinals, then defeated the San Francisco Giants in 
the 1971 National League Championship Series, before winning the World 
Series against the Baltimore Orioles.[9][10][11] In the seven-game series, 
Sanguillen had a .379 batting average with 11 hits, second only to the 
12 hits by Roberto Clemente.[11][12] After the tragic death of Roberto 
Clemente before the 1973 season, the Pirates slated Sanguillen to take 
Clemente's place in right field.[13][14] By mid-June, it was apparent that 
Sanguillen couldn't adapt to playing the outfield and he was moved back 
to the catcher's position.[14] Sanguillen had another strong year in 1975, 
when he posted a .328 batting average, third in the National League batting 
championship behind Bill Madlock and Ted Simmons.[15] In 1977, Sanguillen 
was traded by the Pirates to the Oakland Athletics for the services of 
then-A's manager Chuck Tanner and $100,000 as a settlement of Tanner's 
contract with the A's.[16] After one season with the A's, Sanguillen was 
traded back to the Pirates for Miguel Diloné and Elías Sosa.[16] He played 
in only 85 games in 1978, mostly as a first baseman as Ed Ott and Duffy 
Dyer platooned at the catcher's position.[17] His playing time diminished 
further in 1979, playing in only 56 games, although he contributed a two-out, 
game-winning single and RBI for the Pirates in Game 2 of the 1979 World 
Series against the Orioles.[12][18] Sanguillen would retire after the 1980 
season.[1] Sanguillen was a close friend of his teammate Roberto Clemente. 
In 1972, Sanguillen, who had been playing winter baseball with the San 
Juan Senators, spoke to Clemente about accompanying him on a relief mission 
to Nicaragua. Sanguillen missed the plane because he had misplaced his 
car keys; he was devastated when he learned that the plane had crashed, 
killing Clemente. Against the advice of Pirates General Manager Joe Brown, 
Sanguillen insisted on helping to recover the bodies of those who died 
in the crash. The sight of many sharks swimming in the water did not stop 
Sanguillen. As Pirates teammate Steve Blass told The Sporting News, "Manny 
dove from dawn till midnight." So focused on his task was he that he missed 
the January 4th memorial service attended by his Pirate teammates.[19] 
In a 13-year career, Sanguillen played in 1,448 games, accumulating 1,500 
hits in 5,062 at bats for a .296 career batting average, along with 65 
home runs and 585 runs batted in.[1] He ended his career with a .986 fielding 
percentage.[1] Sanguillen was the Pirates' catcher on September 20, 1969 
when Bob Moose pitched a no-hitter.[20] Along with his three All-Star Game 
appearances, he was a member of two world championship winning teams in 
1971 and 1979, and finished in eighth place in the 1971 Most Valuable Player 
Award balloting results.[21] Sanguillen edged out Johnny Bench on The Sporting 
News National League All-Star Team in 1971, the only time between 1967 
and 1975 that Bench was not selected.[22] Sanguillen currently operates 
"Manny's BBQ", a barbecue-style concession stand at the Pirates' current 
home, PNC Park. He sits in a chair greeting fans in line to buy food, signing
