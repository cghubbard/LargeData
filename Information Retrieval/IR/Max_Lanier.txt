Hubert Max Lanier (August 18, 1915 – January 30, 2007) was an American 
left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most of his career 
with the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in earned run 
average in 1943, and was the winning pitcher of the clinching game in the 
1944 World Series against the crosstown St. Louis Browns. His son Hal became 
a major league infielder and manager. Born in Denton, North Carolina, Lanier 
was one of just a handful of players who remained active during the World 
War II years. A naturally right-handed player, he had become a left-handed 
pitcher only because he twice broke his right arm in childhood. After signing 
with the Cardinals in 1937, he reached the major leagues in 1938. He had 
arguably his best season in 1943, compiling a 15–7 record with a league-best 
1.90 ERA. In 1944 he won a career-high 17 games, and was the winner of 
the final game of the World Series against the crosstown Browns. He was 
named an NL All-Star in both 1943 and 1944. Lanier, along with a dozen 
other major leaguers, defected to the Mexican League in 1946 after being 
offered a salary nearly double what he was making with the Cardinals. Disappointed 
by poor playing conditions and allegedly broken contract promises, he tried 
to return to the Cardinals in 1948, but was barred by an order from commissioner 
Happy Chandler, imposing a five-year suspension on all players who had 
jumped to the Mexican League. In response, Lanier and teammate Fred Martin, 
as well as Danny Gardella of the New York Giants, sued Major League Baseball 
in federal court, challenging baseball's reserve clause as a violation 
of U.S. antitrust law (preceding the similar suit by Curt Flood some 25 
years later). Chandler reinstated Lanier and the other players in June 
1949.[1] Lanier immediately held out for more money than he was being paid 
at the time of his leaving for Mexico,[2] but eventually signed a contract 
paying him the same amount as in 1946.[3] Lanier rejoined the Cardinals 
in 1949. After winning a total of 101 games for the club, he ended his 
career with the New York Giants (1952–53) and the Browns (1953). In a 14-season 
career, Lanier posted a 108–82 record with 821 strikeouts and a 3.01 ERA 
in 1619-1/3 innings pitched, including 21 shutouts and 91 complete games.
