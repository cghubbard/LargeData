Robert Abial "Red" Rolfe (October 17, 1908 – July 8, 1969) was an American 
third baseman, manager and front-office executive in Major League Baseball. 
The native of Penacook, New Hampshire, Rolfe, a graduate of Phillips Exeter 
Academy, also was an Ivy Leaguer: a graduate, then long-time athletic director 
of Dartmouth College, and (from 1943–46) baseball and basketball coach 
at Yale University. During his playing career, Rolfe was the starting third 
baseman on the New York Yankees of the late 1930s. The "Bronx Bombers" 
of Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey, Lefty Gomez and Red Ruffing won 
American League pennants from 1936–39 and took all four World Series in 
which they appeared, winning 16 games and losing only three in Fall Classic 
play over that span. Rolfe played 10 major league seasons, all with New 
York, batting .289 in 1,175 games. His finest season came in 1939, when 
he amassed 213 hits, 139 runs scored, and 46 doubles while hitting .329 
with 14 home runs and 80 runs batted in. He retired following the 1942 
season. After his four-year coaching stint at Yale, Rolfe coached the Toronto 
Huskies of the BAA in 1946–1947 and returned to the Yankees as a coach. 
After the 1947 season, Rolfe joined the Detroit Tigers as director of their 
farm system. But he returned to the field after only one season, when he 
succeeded Steve O'Neill as Tiger manager after the 1948 campaign. In 1949, 
Rolfe's first season as manager, the Tigers improved by nine games and 
returned to the first division. Then, in 1950, they nearly upset the Yankees, 
winning 95 games and finishing second, three games behind. A fluke botched 
double play was the team's undoing. Late in September at Cleveland, the 
Indians had the bases loaded in the tenth inning with one out and the score 
tied. Visibility was poor because smoke from Canadian forest fires was 
blowing across Lake Erie. On an apparent 3-2-3 double-play grounder to 
first base, Detroit catcher Aaron Robinson thought he simply needed to 
touch home plate for a force play to retire the Indians baserunner charging 
in from third. But in the smoky conditions Robinson had not seen that a 
putout had already been made at first base, necessitating that the catcher 
tag the runner, not the plate, to record an out. Robinson mistakenly tagged 
the plate, the run counted and Cleveland won the game. It was the turning 
point in the pennant race, for the postwar Tigers, and for Rolfe's managerial 
career. Beset by an aging starting rotation, the Tigers faltered in 1951, 
slipping to 73 wins and finishing fifth, 25 games behind New York. Then 
Detroit completely unraveled in 1952, winning only 23 of 72 games under 
Rolfe. On July 5, he was fired and replaced by one of his pitchers, Fred 
Hutchinson. The 1952 club won only 50 games, losing 104 – the first time 
ever that the Tigers lost 100 or more games. Rolfe then returned to Dartmouth 
as the athletic director of his alma mater from 1954 to 1967. The college's 
baseball diamond is named in his honor. Rolfe died in Gilford, New Hampshire, 
in 1969 at age 60 of chronic kidney disease.[1] Pound sign (#) denotes
