The 758th Tank Battalion was a tank battalion of the United States Army 
that served during World War II. The first armored unit to consist of African-American 
soldiers, the 758th was formed in 1941 and served in Italy. On 13 January 
1941, the U.S. Army established the 78th Tank Battalion, the first black 
armored unit. On March 1941 The tankers reported to Fort Knox, Kentucky, 
to begin armored warfare training. On 8 May 1941 at Fort Knox, Kentucky 
the 78th Tank Battalion was re-designated as the 758th Tank Battalion (Light). 
It was the first of three units that would form the all-black 5th Tank 
Group. The 758th trained in mechanized warfare using the M5 light tank. 
One of the battalion's more notable members was future baseball star Jackie 
Robinson. Robinson was transferred to the unit from the 761st Tank Battalion 
after an incident in which he refused to move to the back of a civilian 
bus. The 758th was permanently attached to the 92nd Infantry Division until 
22 September 1945 when the unit was deactivated. The unit's insignia is 
the head of a black African elephant with large white tusks accompanied 
by the motto, "We Pierce". The 758th was re-designated as the 64th Heavy 
Tank Battalion from 1949 to 1957. Today the unit exists as the 1st Battalion, 
64th Armor Regiment assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team of 
the 3rd Infantry Division.[1] The 1â€“64th has served with distinction in 
several armed conflicts including Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert 
Fox, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit 
currently operates from Fort Stewart, Georgia. The African elephant remains 
the insignia of the unit and has earned them the nickname "The Tusker Regiment".
