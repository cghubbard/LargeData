The San Diego Padres are a professional baseball franchise based in San 
Diego, California. They began play in 1969, but did not achieve their first 
winning season until 1978, though they failed to sustain this over the 
next half-decade. However, in 1984 the Padres surprisingly reached their 
first-ever postseason appearance and won the National League Championship 
before losing to a very strong Detroit Tiger outfit in the World Series. 
This did not usher in a prolonged period of success for the Padres, who 
failed to achieve a second postseason appearance until 1996, and after 
a disappointing 1997 they rebounded again with a franchise-best 98 wins 
and reached the World Series only to face another exceptionally formidable 
opponent in the late-1990s Yankees dynasty. The Padres yet again faltered, 
but achieved four consecutive winning seasons for the only time in franchise 
history between 2004 and 2007 without winning more than one playoff game. 
The Padres have not played in the postseason since 2007 despite only the 
fourth 90-win season in franchise history during 2010. The following table
