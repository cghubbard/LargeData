Lonas Edgar Bailey, Jr. (April 15, 1931 – March 23, 2007) was an American 
professional baseball player.[1] He played as a catcher in Major League 
Baseball from 1953 through 1966.[1] A six-time All-Star, Bailey was one 
of the top catchers in the National League in the late 1950s and early 
1960s.[2] Born in Strawberry Plains in Jefferson County, Tennessee, Bailey 
was contracted by the Cincinnati Redlegs in 1950 as an amateur free agent. 
He reached the Majors in 1953 and in 1955 he was given a chance as the 
Reds' starting catcher, replacing Andy Seminick. When his offensive production 
floundered, the Reds traded Seminick for catcher Smoky Burgess and Bailey 
was sent down to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League.[2] With 
the help of some batting advice from Reds manager and former catcher Birdie 
Tebbetts, his hitting improved in the minor leagues and continued to improve 
in the Venezuelan Winter League.[2] Bailey began the 1956 season as the 
backup catcher to Burgess, but when the team faltered early in the season, 
Tebbetts decided to shake things up and named Bailey as the Reds' starting 
catcher.[2] By mid-season, he was the leading hitter in the National League 
with a .335 batting average, helping to spur the Reds into first place.[3][4] 
His hitting performance earned him a place as the starting catcher for 
the National League in the 1956 All-Star Game.[5] The Reds stayed in the 
pennant race until the last day of the season, ending up with a 91–63 record, 
two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.[4] Bailey ended the 1956 season 
with career-highs in batting average (.300), home runs (28), runs batted 
in (75), and led the league in baserunners caught stealing (23).[1][2] 
In 1957, the Reds were once again in first place at mid-season, but faltered 
to finish the season in fourth place.[6] Bailey earned his second consecutive 
start for the National League All-Star Team, led National League catchers 
with a 46.2 Caught Stealing percentage and finished second to Roy Campanella 
with a .992 fielding percentage.[7][8] He remained as the Reds' starting 
catcher for the rest of the 1950s up until 12 games into the 1961 season, 
when he was traded to the San Francisco Giants for catcher Bob Schmidt.[9] 
In 1962, Bailey platooned with catcher Tom Haller, as the two players combined 
to give the Giants 35 home runs and 100 runs batted in from the catcher's 
position.[10] In June of that year, Bailey had a streak of 3 clutch home 
runs in four games that propelled the Giants into first place.[11] The 
Giants battled the Los Angeles Dodgers in a tight pennant race as the two 
teams ended the season tied for first place and met in the 1962 National 
League tie-breaker series.[12] The Giants won the three-game series to 
clinch the National League championship.[12][13] Bailey appeared in six 
games of the 1962 World Series, hitting a home run in Game 3 as the Giants 
lost to the New York Yankees in seven games.[14][15] He had another strong 
year in 1963, hitting 21 home runs with 68 runs batted in, earning his 
fifth and final All-Star berth.[16] In December 1963, Bailey was traded 
along with Felipe Alou and Billy Hoeft to the Milwaukee Braves for Del 
Crandall, Bob Hendley and Bob Shaw.[9] He served as Joe Torre's back up 
for two seasons with the Braves before being traded back to the Giants 
in February 1965.[9] After just fourteen games of the 1965 season, he was 
traded again, this time to the Chicago Cubs, where he served as a backup 
catcher to Vic Roznovsky.[9] On July 22, 1965, Bailey hit a grand slam 
home run, a three-run home run and a run-scoring single to drive home eight 
runs during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies.[17] After the 1965 
season, he was traded to the California Angels and was released after appearing 
in only five games of the 1966 season.[9] In a fourteen-season major league 
career, Bailey played in 1,212 games with 915 hits in 3,581 at bats for 
a .256 batting average along with 155 home runs and 540 runs batted in, 
including 423 runs, a .355 on-base percentage and a .986 fielding percentage.[1] 
He was a five-time All-Star and led National League catchers in baserunners 
caught stealing and caught stealing percentage once each.[1] At the time 
of his retirement, he ranked 11th overall for career home runs by a catcher.[18] 
His younger brother, pitcher Jim Bailey, also played in the Major Leagues.[19] 
When his brother joined the Reds in 1959, the Bailey brothers became one 
of the few brother-batteries in Major League history.[20] In between, Bailey 
guided both the Lácteos de Pastora[21] and Industriales de Valencia[22] 
to Venezuela League championship titles,[23] and later played with them 
in the Caribbean Series tournament in 1954 and 1956, respectively.[24] 
In 1957, Bailey and six of his Redleg teammates—Roy McMillan, Johnny Temple, 
Don Hoak, Gus Bell, Wally Post and Frank Robinson—were voted into the National 
League All-Star starting lineup, the result of a ballot stuffing campaign 
by Redlegs fans.[25][26] Major League Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick 
intervened, removing Bell and Post from the starting line up and replacing 
them with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Frick allowed Bell to remain on the 
team as a reserve while Post was removed from the team altogether. The 
Commissioner also transferred the responsibility for All-Star voting to 
the players, managers and coaches the following year.[25] Bailey later 
served on the Knoxville, Tennessee city council from 1983 to 1995. He died
