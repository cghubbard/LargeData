As player As manager George F. Gore (May 3, 1854 â€“ September 16, 1933), 
nicknamed "Piano Legs",[1] was an American center fielder in Major League 
Baseball who played for 14 seasons, eight for the Chicago White Stockings, 
five for the New York Giants, one for the St. Louis Browns (1892) of the 
National League (NL), and the New York Giants of the Players' League (1890). 
Born in Saccarappa, Maine, Gore led the NL in several seasonal offensive 
categories. He won his only batting title in 1880 while playing for Chicago, 
along with league leading totals in on-base percentage and slugging percentage. 
He also led the league twice in runs scored, bases on balls three times, 
and games played by a center fielder once. Gore was also the all-time leader 
for most errors by major league outfielder upon his retirement with 368 
total, including a record 346 errors in the National League, records he 
still holds today. (He made 217 errors for Chicago; 122 for New York; and 
seven for St. Louis, all National League teams; and 22 for the New York 
Giants of the Players' League.)[2] Gore played for many successful teams 
throughout his career. During his eight seasons with the White Stockings, 
they won the league title five times, including appearances in two World 
Series. Chicago played the St. Louis Browns in both 1885, which ended in 
a series tie, and 1886, with St. Louis winning the championship. He was 
also a member of the New York Giants' two National League championship 
teams in 1888 and 1889. Both Giants teams went on to claim World Series 
victories, against the St. Louis Browns in 1888, and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms 
in 1889. Twice he set single-game records, one for stealing seven bases, 
and the other for collecting five extra-base hits. Although he had statistics 
that put him consistently among the seasonal league leaders, he reportedly 
had a poor work ethic resulting from an active social life outside of baseball. 
This behavior did not endear him to his team captain, Cap Anson, which 
caused them to feud during Gore's time in Chicago. After his career, he 
had major financial difficulties, having to move from job to job to just 
support his bare necessities. He died at the age of 79 in Utica, New York. 
Officially born in Saccarappa, Maine (although it is also claimed he was 
born in Hartland, Maine), Gore was born into a poor, country family.[3][4] 
As a young man, he grew up playing baseball in and around his hometown 
of Hartland. While working for, and playing for the S.D. Warren Paper Mill 
in Westbrook, Maine, his skills caught the attention of pro scouts and 
in 1877 he signed a contract with a team in Fall River, Massachusetts of 
the New England League.[4] He showed up to his first professional baseball 
tryout without shoes.[4] The following year, he played for the New Bedford 
Whalers, batted .324 and helped the team win the New England championship.[4] 
Scouts from seven major league teams were vying for his services, but it 
was when he was playing in an exhibition game against Anson's Chicago White 
Stockings team that he got his opportunity to sign a major league contract. 
After the game, White Stockings owner Albert Spalding offered him a contract 
to play for his team, and Gore signed.[5] Spaulding offered him $1,200 
a season, and although Gore originally asked for $2,500, they eventually 
compromised on $1,900.[4] He made his major league debut with Chicago on 
May 1, 1879.[3] He played in 63 games that first season as the club's starting 
center fielder and batted .263.[3] Gore excelled during his second season 
with Chicago, leading the league with a .360 batting average, as well as 
a .399 on-base percentage, and .463 slugging percentage.[3] Additionally, 
he finished in the top five among league leaders in runs scored, hits, 
doubles, runs batted in (RBIs), bases on balls and singles.[1] In 1881 
and 1882, Gore continued his hitting success, as he finished in the top 
10 in multiple offensive categories.[1] He led the league in runs scored 
both seasons, and walks in 1882.[3] On June 25, 1881, he became the first 
known player to record at least seven stolen bases in one game when the 
Chicago Tribune noted that Gore stole second base five times and third 
base three times.[6] It considered the all-time record even though at the 
time stolen bases were not recorded as an official statistic. This feat 
has only equaled by Billy Hamilton, who also stole seven bases on August 
31, 1894.[6] The White Stockings failed to finish the 1883 season in first 
place, after having captured league titles the previous three years.[7] 
Gore's production did not decline despite his team's sinking performance 
as he was again among the top players in several offensive categories over 
the next two seasons, including a league-leading 61 walks in 1884.[1] In 
1885 and 1886 the White Stockings returned to the top of the NL.[7] Gore's 
offensive production continued at a high level, again among league leaders 
in several categories.[1] On July 9, 1885, in a games against the Providence 
Grays and their pitcher Charles Radbourn, he gathered five extra-base hits, 
three doubles and two triples. He is the first player to accomplish this 
feat, which has since been equalled many times, but never surpassed.[6] 
After the 1885 season, Chicago played the St. Louis Browns, the American 
Association (AA) champion, in a best-of-seven series of exhibition games 
known as the "World Series." The series ended with Chicago and St. Louis 
each winning three games, and one game ending in a tie.[8] After the tie 
game, Gore was suspended for drunkenness and indifference, and was replaced 
for the rest of the series by Billy Sunday. Sunday later converted to Christianity 
and became a well-known evangelist.[8][9] In 1886, Gore established career 
highs in bases on balls with 102, which also led the NL, and runs scored 
with 150, while the White Stockings again finished in first place.[1][7] 
Following the season, the White Stockings again played the St. Louis Browns 
in another exhibition "World Series." St. Louis won the series, four games 
to two.[10] In the aftermath of the St. Louis series, there were not only 
charges of drunkenness among many of the players, but also allegations 
that players intentionally lost games for money, known then as "hippodroming".[11] 
King Kelly had the reputation as being the hardest drinker, as well as 
the having the most active social life, which management tolerated due 
to his stellar play. However, that meant instilling discipline in the other 
players, who used Kelly as an example, was extremely difficult.[11] On 
November 24, 1886, Gore was the first to go, when he was sold to the New 
York Giants for approximately $3,500.[3][11] Writer Henry Chadwick said 
Gore "cannot play in harmony with Captain and Manager Anson, and Mr. Spalding 
has wisely released a discontented player whose skill as a fielder, batter, 
and base runner was offset by his unpleasant relations with the team captain."[4] 
Weeks after Gore's contract was sold to the New York Giants, Chicago writer 
Harry Palmer wrote that whenever Gore "failed to play ball for all he was 
worth, Anson has reprimanded him." Socially, Palmer added, Anson says "Gore 
is all right. As an instance of their friendly relations, Anson says Gore 
applied to him for work this Winter, and the big Chicago captain promised 
him employment on the toboggan slides at the White Stocking Park whenever 
he wanted it."[citation needed] In 1888, after seeing him in street clothes 
during a home game, the New York Star called him "'Budweiser' Gore." In 
his 1900 book A Ball Player's Career, Anson said Gore was a good player. 
Also, "Women and wine brought about his downfall, however, and the last 
time that I saw him in New York he was broken down, both in heart and pocket, 
and willing to work at anything that would yield him the bare necessities 
of life." Gore joined a New York Giants team that had a roster that contained 
no less than six future Baseball Hall of Famers: John Montgomery Ward, 
Roger Connor, Buck Ewing, Tim Keefe, Mickey Welch, and Jim O'Rourke.[12] 
Gore took his usual position in center field, replacing O'Rourke, who was 
the starter the previous season.[12][13] Gore played well that first season 
in New York, batting .290 and scoring 95 runs, but the team finished in 
fourth place in the National League.[3][14] For the 1888 season, Gore played 
in just 64 of the team's 138 games.[15] O'Rourke had reclaimed a starting 
position, this time in left field, while Gore split his playing time between 
center and left field.[15] Gore's popularity waned early into the season, 
so much so that on May 3, New York fans screamed at on-field captain Ewing 
to play Mike Slattery instead.[6] Gore had already taken his position in 
left field, but Ewing made the change to Slattery before the game started.[6] 
New York finished the season as the National League champions, and met 
the St. Louis Browns in the World Series.[16][17] Gore appeared in three 
of the eleven games that were played during this post-season exhibition. 
New York was declared the victor, winning six games, and Gore contributed 
five hits in eleven at-bats for a .455 batting average during the series.[17] 
Gore regained his starting position in center field for the 1889 season, 
and his play improved over his 1888 performance. He batted .305, scored 
132 runs, and hit seven home runs in 120 games played, although he did 
commit 41 errors in center field, which led the league.[3] The Giants again 
finished the season as the champions of the NL, and met the Brooklyn Bridegrooms 
in the 1889 World Series after the season.[16][18] New York was again declared 
the victor after winning six of the nine games exhibition games played. 
Gore played in five of these games, collecting seven hits in 21 at-bats 
for a .333 batting average.[18] After the 1889 season, Gore's teammate, 
John Montgomery Ward, had organized a new league, the Players' League, 
and many of players were a part of his new union of baseball players called 
"The Brotherhood". The Players' League began play for the 1890 season, 
and Gore joined many of his fellow Giants as they joined the new league 
to play for the New York Giants.[19][20] Again, Gore split his playing 
time between left and center field with both Slattery and O'Rourke, but 
did finish the season appearing in 93 of the team's 132 games, and batted 
.318 with 132 runs.[3] Following the 1890 season, the Players' League folded 
and all the players were allowed to return to their previous teams. Gore 
returned the Giants along with all of his teammates. In 1891, the Giants 
did not return to their previous championship status. They finished third 
among the league's eight teams, with Gore as their starting center fielder, 
while O'Rourke had moved to left due the departure of Slattery.[21][22] 
Gore batted .284 and scored 103 runs in 130 games played.[3] Gore began 
the 1892 season as the starting center fielder of the Giants, but through 
an unknown transaction, had moved on to the position of player-manager 
for the St. Louis Browns of the NL.[3] He began his tenure on August 1, 
and it ended on August 18, during which time his Browns had a winâ€“loss 
record of 6â€“9 in the games he managed.[3] In the 20 games that he played 
in, his batting average was .205. He soon departed the team, and he never 
played major league baseball again.[3] In 1894, a judge granted a divorce 
to his wife. Married since 1882, she had accused him of living in 1891 
and into 1892 with a Florence "Florilla" Sinclaire "as his wife, and that 
they [Gore and Sinclaire] lived as man and wife in One Hundred and Twenty-ninth 
street" in New York City. Gore denied his wife's charge of having had intimate 
relations with Sinclaire. In 1933, months before his death at age 79, Gore 
told a reporter, "I haven't seen a sick day in seventy-five years, and 
I feel as good today as I did thirty years ago. I can't get around like 
I used to, but I still am able to walk three or four miles daily. That 
keeps me in good shape. I eat three hearty meals a day and my favorite 
diversion now is playing pinocle. I play it every night. It's great sport 
for us old-timers." Gore died in Utica, New York at the age of 79, after
