Mark Alan Lemke (born August 13, 1965 in Utica, New York) is a former Major 
League Baseball player. Nicknamed "The Lemmer", he was a popular second 
baseman for the Atlanta Braves from 1988 to 1997. Lemke grew up in Utica, 
New York. He attended the now closed Sacred Heart Elementary Catholic school 
in West Utica. Lemke is also a graduate of Notre Dame High School in Utica, 
NY. Lemke was drafted in the 27th round of the 1983 amateur draft by the 
Atlanta Braves. Lemke decided against attending Purdue University and spent 
the next four years in the Braves' minor league system, spending time with 
these teamsÂ : Gulf Coast League Braves, Anderson Braves, Sumter Braves, 
Durham Bulls, Greenville Braves and Richmond Braves. He made his major 
league debut on September 17, 1988 when the Braves called him up from AAA 
when the roster expanded to 40 players. In 1988, Lemke won the Hank Aaron 
Award as the top offensive player in the Braves' minor league system.[1] 
Lemke split time between the minor and major leagues until 1990. In his 
11-year career, Lemke played in 62 post season games and appeared in four 
World Series (1991, 1992, 1995, 1996). He won a World Series with the Braves 
in 1995, and he led all Braves players with a .417 batting average in the 
1991 World Series. He also was the last out in the 1996 World Series, when 
the New York Yankees won their first World Series in 18 years. Lemke is 
also known to many fans as one of the best utility infielders to ever wear 
Rec-Specs in Major League Baseball History. Lemke is the all-time record 
holder for most career plate appearances without being hit by a pitch (3664). 
The sharp fielding Lemke left the Braves after the 1997 season. On March 
26, 1998 he signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox. While trying 
to turn a double play in a game against the Chicago White Sox on May 19, 
1998, Lemke was injured in a collision with baserunner Chad Kreuter. He 
suffered a concussion that finished his season and essentially ended his 
major league career. With his big league career over, Lemke decided to 
chase a dream and signed with the New Jersey Jackals, an independent Northern 
League team, as a knuckleball pitcher in 1999. Lemke, who also worked as 
an infield coach during his stint with the Jackals, was 5-1 with a 6.68 
earned run average in 1999.[2] He returned the next season with the Jackals, 
but was released on June 20, 2000 after being hammered in his first few 
appearances. In that stint though, he was wild with his knuckleball and 
threw an independent league record nine wild pitches in successive at bats. 
Currently, Lemke hosts the Braves pregame show on the Braves Radio Network 
with co-hosts Leo Mazzone and Buck Belue on WCNN-AM in Atlanta. Lemke also 
fills in on radio during spring training and road games during the regular 
season as color man, until 2008 with Pete Van Wieren and presently with 
Jim Powell and Don Sutton. Lemke was mentioned in an episode of Saturday 
Night Live that aired in October 1995, during the Weekend Update segment. 
Lemke was also mentioned in an episode in 1994, along with many other striking 
Major League Baseball players, during an advertisement for the Fall Baseball 
cruise (Steve Martin was the announcer for the ad). He is credited as the 
accidental namesake of the popular Homestar Runner cartoon, when a friend 
of creators Mike and Matt Chapman, of Montreal band member James Huggins, 
unfamiliar with baseball terminology incorrectly referred to Lemke as the
