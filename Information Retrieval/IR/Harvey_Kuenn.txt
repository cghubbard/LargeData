As player As manager Harvey Edward Kuenn (December 4, 1930 – February 28, 
1988) was an American player, coach, and manager in Major League Baseball. 
As a shortstop and outfielder, he played with the Detroit Tigers (1952–59), 
Cleveland Indians (1960), San Francisco Giants (1961–65), Chicago Cubs 
(1965–66), and Philadelphia Phillies (1966). He batted and threw right-handed. 
After retiring, Kuenn managed the Milwaukee Brewers (1975, 1982–83). Kuenn 
/ˈkiːn/ was born in West Allis, Wisconsin, but raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin 
and attended Lutheran High School. He once kicked a 53-yard field goal 
for Lutheran in a football game, which is tied for the eighth-longest field 
goal in Wisconsin high school football history. He played collegiate baseball 
at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he was a member of Delta 
Upsilon fraternity. Signed by Detroit as an amateur free agent in 1952, 
Kuenn was named the starting shortstop after joining the team late in the 
season. In his first full season in 1953, he hit .308 with 94 runs and 
led the major leagues with 209 hits, setting a major league rookie record 
with 167 singles. He received the American League Rookie of the Year and 
TSN Rookie of the Year awards. Also in that season, he received the first 
of his ten consecutive selections to the All-Star Game. A line drive hitter 
who hit to all fields, Kuenn showed consistency in the next two seasons, 
compiling almost identical numbers: .306 with 81 runs and 201 hits in 1954; 
.306 with 101 runs and 190 hits in 1955. He raised his average to .332 
in 1956, surpassed only by Mickey Mantle (.353) and Ted Williams (.345) 
in the batting race. A year later, he slumped badly to .277. But he rebounded 
in 1958 with .319, ending third in the league behind Williams (.328) and 
Pete Runnels (.322), and surpassing Al Kaline, Vic Power, Bob Cerv, Mantle, 
Rocky Colavito, Minnie Miñoso and Nellie Fox. In that season, he switched 
to the outfield, where he played all three positions over the remainder 
of his career. After winning the American League batting crown in 1959 
with a .353 average, Kuenn was traded to Cleveland for Rocky Colavito, 
who had won the home run title with 42 homers (the trade that is often 
referred to by Cleveland fans as "the curse of Rocky Colavito"). With the 
Indians, Kuenn hit .308 in the 1960 season. He finished his career in the 
National League playing for the Giants, Cubs and Phillies,[1] retiring 
at the end of the 1966 season. In a 15-season playing career, Kuenn was 
a .303 hitter with 87 home runs and 671 RBI in 1833 games. He led the AL 
in hits and doubles four times each, and finished with 2,092 hits. Kuenn 
had the dubious distinction of making the final out in two of Sandy Koufax's 
four no-hitters—in 1963 and 1965. In the former, the final out was on a 
ground ball back to Koufax.[2] In the latter, he struck out for the final 
out in Koufax's perfect game.[3] Kuenn was activated by the Brewers for 
the last two weeks of 1970, in order for him to qualify for a pension. 
He never appeared in a game, however. Kuenn became a Milwaukee Brewers 
coach in 1972 and served as an interim manager in 1975. He suffered a series 
of medical complications beginning in the mid-1970s, including heart and 
stomach surgeries, and in February 1980, he had his right leg amputated 
just below the knee after a blood clot cut circulation. He returned to 
coaching only six months after the operation. In 1982, Kuenn managed the 
Milwaukee Brewers to their only World Series appearance to date after taking 
over the team in mid-season. He was selected by the Associated Press as 
the AL Manager of the Year, after taking the Brewers in June from a 23-24 
start to the AL East title with a 95-67 record. Milwaukee then won the 
AL pennant after rallying from a 2-0 deficit and beating the California 
Angels in the best-of-five American League Championship Series. They ultimately 
lost the 1982 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Kuenn 
was fired as manager after the Brewers finished fifth in the AL East with 
an otherwise respectable 87-75 record in 1983. He compiled a 160-118 managerial 
record. During his tenure, the hard-hitting Brewers were known as Harvey's 
Wallbangers. At the time, their roster included Cecil Cooper, Ben Oglivie, 
Ted Simmons, Gorman Thomas, and future Hall of Famers Paul Molitor and 
Robin Yount. After being replaced, he worked as a major league scouting 
consultant for the Brewers. Kuenn died at his home in Peoria, Arizona, 
in 1988. The Brewers wore a patch with his initials during the 1988 season 
to commemorate him. That same year, he was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic 
Hall of Fame. In 2002, his name was added to the Brewers' honorarium with
