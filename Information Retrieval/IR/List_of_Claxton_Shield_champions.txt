The Claxton Shield was the premier baseball competition in Australia, first 
held in 1934 and last held in 2010. The Claxton Shield is also the name 
of the trophy awarded to the champion team, and has also been awarded to 
winners of both the original Australian Baseball League (ABL) and the International 
Baseball League of Australia (IBLA).[1] The current version of the Australian 
Baseball League uses the Claxton Shield as its championship trophy in the 
same way as its predecessor of the same name did.[2] There had been interstate 
baseball tournaments held prior to the start of the Claxton Shield. The 
first was held in Hobart in 1910, won by New South Wales defeating Victoria 
and hosts Tasmania. New South Wales repeated the feat in 1912 in Melbourne 
when they won again, this time with the addition of South Australia.[3] 
None were held regularly though, and they did not always involve all baseball–playing 
states. In 1934 Norrie Claxton was the principal driver of an annual national 
competition, and donated the shield to be awarded to the champions. Though 
it was originally intended to be permanently held by the first team to 
win in three consecutive years, when South Australia won the first three 
tournaments[4][5][6] all participating states agreed that it should be 
a perpetual shield, and named it the Claxton Shield in honour of Norrie 
Claxton.[3] The Victoria Aces were the last team to win the shield under 
the Claxton Shield format, having won the 2010 tournament by defeating 
South Australia two games to nil in the final series.[7] It was the eighteenth 
time the Aces had won the shield, and the twenty second time it had been 
won by a Victorian team—the most by any state—including three times by 
the Waverley / Melbourne Reds and once by the Melbourne Monarchs.[3] The 
Perth Heat currently hold the shield, having won the 2013–14 ABL season 
by defeating the Canberra Cavalry two games to nil in the championship 
series. Though city-based teams have competed for the Claxton Shield in 
some seasons, including under the current ABL format, the name engraved 
on the shield is that of the winning state; for the 2010–11 ABL season
