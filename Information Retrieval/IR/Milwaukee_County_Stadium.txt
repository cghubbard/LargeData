Milwaukee County Stadium (mainly known simply as County Stadium locally) 
was a multi-purpose stadium in the north central United States, located 
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Opened 63 years ago in 1953, it was primarily 
a baseball park for the major league Milwaukee Braves and Brewers. It was 
also used for football games, ice skating, religious services, concerts, 
and other large events. Its final season was in 2000, when it was replaced 
by the adjacent Miller Park. Milwaukee County Stadium was originally built 
as a home for the Milwaukee Brewers of the minor league American Association, 
replacing the outdated and deteriorating Borchert Field. Both locations 
would be influenced by the future Milwaukee County freeway system, as Borchert 
Field's footprint would be cleared to make way for Interstate 43, with 
County Stadium located southwest of the interchange with the Stadium Freeway 
and Interstate 94. Several locations around the city, including the Wisconsin 
State Fair Park in West Allis[5] were considered before the city settled 
on the defunct site of the Story Quarry, on the west side of Milwaukee 
near the Story Hill neighborhood. County Stadium was the first ballpark 
in the United States financed with public funds.[6] Construction began 
in October 1950 and, hampered by steel shortages during the Korean War, 
was completed in 1953.[7] Construction cost was $5.9 million, with the 
bonds paid off in 1964.[2] The city of Milwaukee also hoped to use the 
new facility to attract a Major League Baseball franchise (the city had 
been considered a potential relocation target for years), and in this respect 
their efforts were immediately successful. In fact, the minor league Brewers 
would never get a chance to play at the new stadium. Even before it was 
completed, the new "Milwaukee County Municipal Stadium" drew the interest 
of major league clubs. The St. Louis Browns, who had played in Milwaukee 
in 1901, the inaugural season of the American League, applied for permission 
to relocate back to the city they had left half a century before. The Boston 
Braves, the parent club of the Brewers, blocked the proposed move.[8] The 
Braves had long been struggling at the gate in Boston, and rumors of them 
relocating had been floating for some time. The move to keep Milwaukee 
available as a new home indicated to many observers that the Braves would 
move to Milwaukee themselves. Three weeks before the beginning of the 1953 
season, and right before the new stadium was ready to open, the Braves 
made it official, applying for permission to relocate. The other National 
League owners agreed, with the team becoming the Milwaukee Braves. The 
Braves' first regular season home game was on April 14 against the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Bill Bruton hit a 10th inning home run to win the game 
(3-2) in dramatic style.[9][10] In their first season in Milwaukee, the 
Braves set the National League attendance record of 1.8 million. The first 
published issue of Sports Illustrated on August 16, 1954, featured County 
Stadium and batter Eddie Mathews on its cover. On July 12, 1955, County 
Stadium hosted the 22nd All-Star Game. The National League won, 6–5, on 
a 12th-inning home run by Stan Musial.[11][12] The Braves hosted back-to-back 
World Series in 1957 and 1958, both against the New York Yankees. The Braves 
defeated the Yankees in seven games in 1957, but the Yankees returned the 
favor the next year. The stadium continued to be the National League's 
top draw until 1959 when the Dodgers, who had moved to Los Angeles two 
years before, overtook the Braves (both in the stands and on the field). 
In the early 1960s attendance fell, along with the Braves' standings, amid 
an unstable ownership situation. The Milwaukee Braves used the stadium 
through the 1965 season when new owners, seeking a larger television market, 
moved the team to Atlanta. In an effort to return Major League Baseball 
to Milwaukee after the departure of the Braves, local businessman and minority 
Braves owner Bud Selig brought other teams to play at County Stadium, beginning 
with a 1967 exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox and Minnesota 
Twins. The exhibition game attracted more than 51,000 spectators, so Selig's 
group contracted with Sox owner Arthur Allyn to host nine Chicago White 
Sox home games at County Stadium in 1968. Selig's experiment was highly 
successful – those nine games drew 264,297 fans. Those games took place 
on May 15 vs. the California Angels,[13] May 28 vs. the Baltimore Orioles,[14] 
June 17 vs. the Cleveland Indians,[15] June 24 vs. the Minnesota Twins,[16] 
July 11 vs. the New York Yankees,[17] July 22 vs. the Oakland A's,[18] 
August 2 vs. Washington Senators,[19] August 8 vs. the Boston Red Sox,[20] 
and August 26 vs. the Detroit Tigers.[21] In Chicago that season, the Sox 
drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home dates.[22] In just a handful 
of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly one-third of the total 
attendance at White Sox games. In light of this success, Selig and Allyn 
agreed that County Stadium would host Sox home games again the next season. 
In 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home 
games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the 
time). Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 
fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of 
the total White Sox attendance than the previous year – over one-third 
of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium 
(in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an 
average of 6,632 per game). Those games took place on April 23 vs. the 
California Angels,[23] May 22 vs. Detroit Tigers,[24] May 28 vs. the New 
York Yankees,[25] June 11 vs. the Cleveland Indians,[26] June 16 vs. the 
Seattle Pilots (who eventually became the Brewers the next season),[27] 
July 2 vs. the Minnesota Twins,[28] July 7 vs. the Oakland A's,[29] August 
6 vs. the Washington Senators,[30] August 13 vs. the Boston Red Sox,[31] 
September 1 vs. the Baltimore Orioles,[32] and September 26 vs. the Kansas 
City Royals.[33] Despite the attendance success of the White Sox games, 
Selig was unable to attract an expansion team in the 1969 expansion. However, 
one of the teams founded in that expansion would later work in Selig's 
favor. Not discouraged, Selig instead bought the Seattle Pilots out of 
bankruptcy court. The Pilots had been a 1969 expansion team the Seattle 
franchise had serious stadium and financial issues.[34] In the spring of 
1970, Milwaukee had baseball again, and County Stadium had a new tenant. 
The new Milwaukee Brewers, named for the American Association club for 
which County Stadium was originally built over 20 years earlier, called 
it home from 1970 to 2000. The sale occurred during spring training for 
1970, and happened so fast that Selig could not get new uniforms made. 
Instead, they ripped the Pilots insignia off the pre-existing uniforms, 
and the Brewers adopted the Pilots' blue, white, and yellow instead of 
the red and navy blue that Selig originally wanted. On July 15, 1975, County 
Stadium hosted its second All-Star Game. As in 1955, the National League 
beat the American League, this time 6–3. With an attendance of 51,480, 
it was the largest crowd at the stadium at that time.[35] The Brewers were 
represented by George Scott and Hank Aaron, who had recently returned to 
Milwaukee in a trade with the Braves. Aaron spent the last two years of 
his career in Milwaukee and in the American League, where the designated 
hitter position allowed him to extend his playing days. Aaron hit his final 
home run at County Stadium, giving him a career total of 755, establishing 
at the time the career home run record he first took from Babe Ruth in 
1974. Aaron's final home run took place in the 7th inning with a solo shot 
off California Angels right-hander Dick Drago on July 20, 1976, a game 
that the Brewers would win 6–2.[36] By the 1990s, County Stadium was considered 
outdated, lacking the amenities (most notably luxury boxes) that generated 
additional revenue for teams. On July 11, 1992, Selig announced plans for 
a publicly financed replacement to be built adjacent to County Stadium, 
opening in time for the 1994 season.[37] In the meantime, a demonstration 
luxury box was built in the stadium in order to demonstrate the viability 
of one to local politicians and the city's larger corporations.[38] The 
new stadium funding plan proved to be extremely controversial, and it was 
not until 1996 that groundbreaking began on the new stadium, by now named 
Miller Park as part of a sponsorship deal with nearby Miller Brewing Company. 
Miller Park's most distinctive new feature was a retractable roof, deemed 
essential to drawing fans during the cool and unpredictable Wisconsin spring. 
At the time of the groundbreaking, Miller Park was scheduled to open in 
2000, making 1999 the final season in County Stadium. The Brewers opened 
the 1999 season intending to bid farewell to their old park. On July 14, 
three construction workers at the Miller Park site were killed in the collapse 
of the site's "Big Blue" crane while attempting to install a 400-ton roof 
panel. A good part of the construction site was also damaged as a result. 
Cleanup and an investigation delayed the closing of County Stadium to the 
2000 season. There was some talk of having the Brewers move into Miller 
Park in the middle of 2000, but it was determined that too many corners 
would have to be cut in order for it to be ready at that time.[39] The 
final major league game at County Stadium was on Thursday, September 28;[40] 
Warren Spahn threw out the first pitch to Del Crandall, and also in attendance 
were Willie Davis, Hank Aaron, and Robin Yount.[41] After the last game, 
demolition immediately began. It was demolished on February 21, 2001. Although 
most of the stadium site is now covered with parking for Miller Park, the 
site of the old infield was converted into a Little League park, and is 
now called Helfaer Field. On a picnic concourse next to the playing field 
of Helfaer Field, there is an outline of where home plate was at County 
Stadium and also a bronze marker in the nearby parking lot marking where 
Hank Aaron's 755th career home run landed. The National Football League's 
Green Bay Packers played two to four home games per year at Milwaukee County 
Stadium from 1953 to 1994,[42] after using Wisconsin State Fair Park in 
nearby West Allis from 1934 through 1951 and Marquette Stadium in 1952.[43][44] 
The Packers compiled a 76–47–3 (.615) regular season record at County Stadium 
over 42 seasons. It hosted at least one pre-season game annually during 
this time as well (except 1983), including the Upper Midwest Shrine Game. 
Financial considerations prompted the Packers to move some of their games 
to Milwaukee starting with the 1933 season, with one game played at Borchert 
Field. By 1995, multiple renovations to Lambeau Field made it more lucrative 
for the Packers to play their full home slate in Green Bay again for the 
first time since 1932.[45] Former Milwaukee ticket holders were offered 
tickets at Lambeau to one pre-season game and games 2 and 5 of the regular 
season schedule, in what is referred to as the "Gold package." Ironically, 
County Stadium was partly responsible for Lambeau Field's existence. County 
Stadium was built not only to lure major league baseball to Milwaukee, 
but also to lure the Packers to Milwaukee full-time. As originally constructed, 
County Stadium was double the size of the Packers' then-home, City Stadium, 
leading the NFL to give the Packers an ultimatum—build a bigger stadium 
or move to Milwaukee. Green Bay responded with a referendum that resulted 
in a new City Stadium, which opened in September 1957.[46] After eight 
seasons, the venue was renamed "Lambeau Field" shortly after the death 
of team founder Curly Lambeau in 1965. The Minnesota Vikings (15 times) 
were the Packers' most frequent foe at County Stadium, as the Packers would 
traditionally host at least one divisional rival from the NFC Central in 
Milwaukee each season. Only once, however, did the Packers play their ancient 
arch-rivals, the Chicago Bears, in a regular-season game in Milwaukee, 
defeating the Bears 20–3 in 1974. (The Packers and Bears played preseason 
games at County Stadium every year from 1959 to 1973, and again in 1975 
and 1984.[47]) On November 26, 1989, a County Stadium record crowd of 55,892 
saw the Packers beat the Vikings, 20–19.[48] The Packers' final game at 
County Stadium was a 21–17 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on December 
18, 1994;[49] with fourteen seconds left, the winning 9-yard touchdown 
run was scored by quarterback Brett Favre.[50][51][52] The Packers hosted 
one NFL playoff game at County Stadium, in 1967, defeating the Los Angeles 
Rams 28–7 in the Western Conference championship game.[53][54][55][56][57] 
It was the first year that the NFL playoffs expanded to a four teams, and 
Green Bay had home field advantage for both rounds, then awarded by rotation. 
Each subsequent playoff game has been played at Lambeau Field, starting 
with the Ice Bowl the following week against the Dallas Cowboys.[58] Unlike 
most publicly funded stadiums built in the 20th century, County Stadium 
was built primarily for baseball. It was thus somewhat problematic as a 
football venue. The playing surface was just barely large enough to fit 
a football field. The football field itself ran parallel with the first 
base line. The south end zone spilled onto the warning track in right field, 
while the north end zone spilled onto foul territory on the third-base 
side.[49][59] Only the bare minimum adjustments were made to accommodate 
the Packers. Both teams occupied the east sideline on the outfield side, 
separated by a piece of tape. At its height, it seated less than 56,000 
for football—just over the NFL's minimum seating capacity—and many seats 
had obstructed views or were far from the field. Over the years, upgrades 
and seat expansion almost exclusively benefited the Braves and later the 
Brewers. Season ticket prices (three games) for the first football season 
in 1953 were $5.00, $3.80, and $2.50.[60][61] The average price in the 
final year of 1994 was $25.61 per game.[62] Most of the home games of the 
Marquette University football team (7 of 9) in 1957 and 1958 were moved 
from Marquette Stadium to the larger County Stadium.[63][64][65][66] The 
final home game on November 9, 1957 against Penn State drew less than 4,800 
to County Stadium.[66][67] Marquette football returned to Marquette Stadium 
in 1959 for its final two seasons.[68][69][70][71] The University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee 
football team played home games at County Stadium 1968–1971. It was one 
of multiple home venues for the Panthers after their on-campus stadium, 
Pearse Field, was razed for new development following the 1967 season. 
County Stadium was also a popular home for concerts throughout its history. 
Bob Hope performed for fans during a Braves doubleheader in 1960. County 
Stadium also hosted the Kool Jazz Festival every year from 1976 through 
1980. In 1975, The Rolling Stones played a concert with The Eagles and 
Rufus. Following the concert, the Brewers complained that the fans destroyed 
the field. The damage was, in fact, less than that which typically occurred 
during Green Bay Packers football games. Also in 1975, Pink Floyd performed 
at County Stadium. An urban legend has sprung up around this show – according 
to legend, the dark and brooding clouds parted and revealed a brilliant 
moon just as the band was launching into the line "I'll see you on the 
dark side of the moon." Pink Floyd returned to County Stadium in 1977, 
drawing an estimated 60,000. For a third and final time, the band returned 
on September 30, 1987, on the A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. In 1978, 
the Grand Slam Jam brought in Heart, Journey, Cheap Trick & Ted Nugent. 
Other sold out concerts at County Stadium in 1978 were The Eagles on their 
Hotel California Tour, with the Steve Miller Band and Pablo Cruise and 
Jefferson Starship. September 5, 1981 saw the World Series of Rock make 
an appearance, starring REO Speedwagon, April Wine, Blackfoot, and the 
Michael Stanley Band. The second World Series of Rock took place on May 
28, 1982 and featured Foreigner, .38 Special (band), Triumph, Loverboy, 
and Quarterflash. Paul McCartney played to sellout crowds in 1993, as did 
Billy Joel and Elton John during their "Piano Men" tour in 1994. Other 
musical stars who performed at County Stadium included Simon and Garfunkel, 
Crosby Stills & Nash, Fleetwood Mac, Jimmy Buffett, Kenny Loggins, Peter 
Frampton, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, B.B. 
King, Emmylou Harris, Nancy Wilson, The Staple Singers, Archie Bell and 
the Drells, Frankie Avalon, the Hollywood Argyles, Johnny and The Hurricanes, 
James Brown, The Famous Flames, Lobo, Bread, Andy Kim, Gary Puckett, Rare 
Earth & The Honeycombs. Jehovah's Witnesses held an annual convention (including 
well known annual themes such as: "Good News for all Nations" and 'Peace 
on Earth") in the Stadium during the 1960s and 1970s, drawing as many as 
57,000 people at a time. They later opted to utilize an "Assembly Hall", 
which is constructed for the same purpose as the Stadium. Billy Graham's 
1979 Wisconsin Crusade was also held at the Stadium. Portions of the last 
three seasons (1995–1997) of the American television series Coach were 
filmed at County Stadium. The series starred Craig T. Nelson as Hayden 
Fox, coach of the Orlando Breakers (a fictional NFL expansion team), from 
whose office window County Stadium can be recognized. The movie Major League 
was shot at County Stadium during the summer of 1988. Even though the movie 
was about the Cleveland Indians, producers cast Milwaukee Brewers radio 
announcer Bob Uecker in the movie, with signage for local channels WTMJ-TV 
(Channel 4) and WCGV (Channel 24) not covered up and visible in the film. 
Announcements were made on local television news programs about the number 
of extras required for the day's shooting, and capacity crowds turned out 
for the shooting of the final scenes, which involved the Indians in the 
final games of a pennant race. Also, in the film, fans in the stands are 
visible donning T-shirts bearing the name and logo of a local Milwaukee-area 
(Sussex, Wisconsin) corporation, Quad Graphics.[72] The World Wrestling 
Federation held WrestleFest 1988 at County Stadium on July 31, 1988. The 
event was headlined by Hulk Hogan defeating André the Giant in a steel 
cage match. Due to the large seating capacity, in July 1953 the new stadium 
hosted the Ice Capades for nine consecutive nights.[73][74][75] There was 
a chalet and giant beer mug, originally at right-center field and later 
at left, where mascot Bernie Brewer would "dunk" himself whenever a Brewers 
player hit a home run. The chalet is now stored at Lakefront Brewery, a 
Milwaukee microbrewery, and can be seen on brewery tours. County Stadium 
also gave rise to the Sausage Race, during which several anthropomorphized 
sausages participate in an initially fictional race to home plate between 
the sixth and seventh innings. Whoever finished first was the "wiener" 
and whoever finished last was the "wurst". Brats with Secret Stadium Sauce, 
invented and served at County Stadium, were the favorite ballpark food 
of sportscaster Bob Costas.[76] County Stadium has hosted two Baseball 
All-Star Games, in 1955, when the National League Braves played host (and 
won 6–5 in 12 innings),[77] and in 1975, when the then American League 
Brewers played host, and lost, 6–3.[78] It also hosted the World Series 
in 1957,[79] 1958[80] and 1982,[81] as well as league playoffs in 1981,[82] 
and a Green Bay Packers playoff game in 1967.[57] On May 26, 1959, Harvey 
Haddix of the Pittsburgh Pirates set a record as he pitched 12 perfect 
innings only to lose 1–0 to the Braves in the 13th inning.[83] On April 
30, 1961, Willie Mays hit four homers and collected 8 RBI as the San Francisco 
Giants defeated the Braves, 14–8.[84] On May 1, 1975, Hank Aaron broke 
Babe Ruth's RBI record of 2211 by driving in his 2212th run at County Stadium 
as the Brewers beat the Detroit Tigers, 17-3.[85] On September 17, 1976, 
County Stadium hosted a "Salute to Hank Aaron" in which Aaron was honored. 
On October 3, 1976, in the final game of his career, Aaron singled in his 
final at-bat for hit number 3,771. The hit drove in a run and set the Major 
League Baseball career RBI record of 2,297. In this final game, Aaron also 
set Major League records for that time with career game 3,298 and career 
at-bat 12,364. The Brewers lost to the Detroit Tigers, 5-2.[86] On July 
31, 1990, Nolan Ryan won his 300th Major League Baseball game at County 
Stadium when the Texas Rangers defeated the Brewers 11–3.[87] On September 
14, 1991, Cecil Fielder of the Detroit Tigers hit the only home run to 
sail over the outfield bleachers and completely out of County Stadium. 
The blast came off Brewers' pitcher Dan Plesac.[88][89] The Tigers beat 
the Brewers, 6-4.[90] The final game at County Stadium took place on September 
28, 2000 in front of a capacity crowd of 56,354. The Brewers closed out 
their tenure at Milwaukee County Stadium with an 8-1 loss to the Cincinnati 
Reds, a ceremony aired in full on both WTMJ Radio and Midwest Sports Channel. 
Sean Casey of the Reds scored the last run at County Stadium with a single 
by Juan Castro, and the final hit was a single by the Reds' Michael Tucker.[91] 
In a closing ceremony led by legendary announcer Bob Uecker, greats from 
the Milwaukee Braves, Milwaukee Brewers, and Green Bay Packers were introduced. 
Familiar faces such as Warren Spahn, Hank Aaron, Frank Torre, and Bob Buhl 
represented the Braves. Willie Wood and Fuzzy Thurston were some of the 
notable Packers. Brewers greats that came back to salute the fans and the 
stadium included Paul Molitor, Jim Gantner, Rollie Fingers and the widow 
of 1982 manager Harvey Kuenn. When Uecker announced what would be the final 
player introduction in the stadium, he began, "his name is synonymous with 
the Brewers..." Robin Yount then appeared from the left field fence on 
another Milwaukee legend, a Harley Davidson motorcycle. This was in honor 
of Yount's famous entrance during the County Stadium celebration for the 
Brewers following the 1982 World Series, when Yount rode his Honda XR500 
dirt bike (a bike which was not street-legal, but had been nonetheless 
used by Yount for the entire season) around the warning track, much to 
the delight of the fans. Following the introductions, Uecker read a short 
requiem for the old park as the lights were turned off, standard by standard. 
He closed with a version of this trademark broadcast sign-off "...so-long 
old friend, and goodnight everybody." When it opened in 1953 it had 28,111 
permanent seats and could hold up to 36,011 people. After an expansion 
one year later, the seating capacity was increased to 43,394. Subsequent 
expansions raised the baseball capacity to 53,192 in 1973 until the final 
game was played on September 28, 2000. The stadium's final dimensions were
