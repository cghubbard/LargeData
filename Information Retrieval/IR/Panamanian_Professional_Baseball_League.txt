The Panamanian Professional Baseball League (Spanish: Béisbol Profesional 
de Panamá), currently known as Probeis, is a winter professional baseball 
league consisting of four teams. Originally founded in 1946, the PPBL joined 
Organized Baseball in 1948 and operated continuously until 1972.[1] A new 
Panamanian baseball league started the 2001–02 season as Probeis (Liga 
Profesional de Béisbol de Panamá), but it lasted that season only. By 2010, 
Los Angeles Dodgers related businessmen restarted the league as LPB (Professional 
Baseball League), but had poor logistics and operations lasted only one 
season. In 2011 Probeis made its second run since 2001. The league's champion 
team played in the Caribbean Series in its first stage from 1949 through 
1960, before Fidel Castro dismantled the Cuban Winter League and replaced 
it with a new amateur circuit. The Carta Vieja Yankees, one of the most 
distinguished clubs in the circuit, won five titles spanning 1950–58 and 
also captured the 1950 Caribbean Series, to become the only Panamanian 
team to a win a Series championship in the 20th Century.[2][3] Throughout 
its 12-year history, the team featured players as Wayne Blackburn, Chet 
Brewer, Webbo Clarke, Jim Cronin, Jerry Davie, Carl Duser, Marion Fricano, 
Milt Graff, Bill Harris, Spook Jacobs, Connie Johnson, Spider Jorgensen, 
Héctor López, Bobby Prescott, Humberto Robinson, Jean-Pierre Roy, Pat Scantlebury, 
Billy Shantz, Joe Tuminelli and Jim Umbricht, among others.[2] Four teams 
participated during the 2001–02 season: Canaleros de Panamá, Macheteros 
de Azuero, Roneros de Carta Vieja and Tiburones Atlas de Panamá Oeste. 
Carta Vieja was the champion team, while Olmedo Sáenz won the batting title 
(.331) and Miguel Gómez was the best pitcher (5-0).[4][5] Roneros Carta 
Vieja won their second Probeis title.[6][7] Caballos de Coclé won first 
title and Javier Castillo was selected as MVP with 0.397 Avg. Caballos 
de Coclé as champion represented Panama in the first Serie Latinoamericana 
held in Veracruz, Mexico, reaching third place.[8] Industriales de Herrera 
replaced Diablicos de Azuero for the 2012 tournament.[9][10] In 2010, Major 
League Baseball authorized Augusto Ávila Penabad and Rafael Ávila (at the 
time a vice president with the Los Angeles Dodgers) to run a new winter 
professional baseball league. The Liga Profesional de Beisbol or known 
as LPB started under the sponsorship of Claro with four teams: Los Santos, 
Herrera, Veraguas and Panama. The league lasted only one season due to 
poor logistics, economics and no support from main TV stations. Only UHF 
RCM Television bought the TV rights. Season ran from December 12, 2009
