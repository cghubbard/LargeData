Newark (/ˈnuː.ərk/[23] or also locally /nʊərk/[24]) is the largest city 
(by population) in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and the county seat of 
Essex County.[25][26] One of the nation's major air, shipping, and rail 
hubs, the city had a population of 277,140 in 2010, making it the nation's 
67th most-populous municipality, after being ranked 63rd in the nation 
in 2000.[14] For 2015, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program 
calculated a population of 281,944, an increase of 1.7% from the 2010 enumeration,[13] 
ranking the city the 70th largest in the nation.[27] Newark is the second 
largest city in the New York metropolitan area, located approximately 8 miles 
(13 km) west of lower Manhattan. Settled in 1666 by Puritans from New Haven 
Colony, Newark is one of the oldest European cities in the United States. 
Its location at the mouth of the Passaic River (where it flows into Newark 
Bay), has made the city's waterfront an integral part of the Port of New 
York and New Jersey. Today, Port Newark-Elizabeth is the primary container 
shipping terminal of the busiest seaport on the American East Coast. In 
addition, Newark Liberty International Airport was the first municipal 
commercial airport in the United States, and today is one of its busiest.[28][29][30] 
Several leading companies have their headquarters in Newark, including 
Prudential, PSEG, Panasonic Corporation of North America, Audible.com, 
and Manischewitz. A number of important higher education institutions are 
also located in the city, including the Newark campus of Rutgers University 
(which includes law and medical schools and the world-renowned Rutgers 
Institute of Jazz Studies); the New Jersey Institute of Technology; and 
Seton Hall University's law school. The U.S. District Court for the District 
of New Jersey holds court in the city, as well. Local cultural venues include 
the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark Symphony Hall, The Prudential 
Center, The Newark Museum, and the Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium. Newark 
is divided into five political wards; the East, West, South, North and 
Central wards and contains neighborhoods ranging in character from bustling 
urban districts to quiet suburban enclaves. Newark's Branch Brook Park 
is the oldest county park in the United States and is home to the nation's 
largest collection of cherry blossom trees, numbering over 5,000.[31][32][33][34] 
Newark was originally founded in 1666 by Connecticut Puritans led by Robert 
Treat from the New Haven Colony. It was conceived as a theocratic assembly 
of the faithful, though this did not last for long as new settlers came 
with different ideas.[35] The name of the city is thought to derive from 
Newark-on-Trent, England. This is on the grounds that the name was influenced 
by the original pastor, Abraham Pierson, who came from Yorkshire but may 
have ministered in Newark, Nottinghamshire.[36][37][38] But Pierson is 
also supposed to have said that the community reflecting the new task at 
hand should be named "New Ark" for "New Ark of the Covenant[39] and some 
of the colonists saw it as "New-Work", the settlers' new work with God. 
Whatever the origins, the name was shortened to Newark, although references 
to the name "New Ark" are found in preserved letters written by historical 
figures such as David Ogden in his claim for compensation, and James McHenry, 
as late as 1787.[40] The city saw tremendous industrial and population 
growth during the 19th century and early 20th century, and experienced 
racial tension and urban decline in the second half of the 20th century, 
culminating in the 1967 Newark riots. The city has experienced revitalization 
during the 1990s and early 21st century.[41] Newark was originally formed 
as a township on October 31, 1693, based on the Newark Tract, which was 
first purchased on July 11, 1667. Newark was granted a Royal charter on 
April 27, 1713. During the American Revolutionary War there were several 
incidents when British troops made raids into the town.[42] Established 
on February 21, 1798, it was incorporated by the New Jersey Legislature's 
Township Act of 1798, as one of New Jersey's initial group of 104 townships. 
During its time as a township, portions were taken to form Springfield 
Township (April 14, 1794), Caldwell Township (February 16, 1798; now known 
as Fairfield Township), Orange Township (November 27, 1806), Bloomfield 
Township (March 23, 1812) and Clinton Township (April 14, 1834, remainder 
reabsorbed by Newark on March 5, 1902). Newark was reincorporated as a 
city on April 11, 1836, replacing Newark Township, based on the results 
of a referendum passed on March 18, 1836. The previously independent Vailsburg 
borough was annexed by Newark on January 1, 1905. In 1926, South Orange 
Township changed its name to Maplewood. As a result of this, a portion 
of Maplewood known as Ivy Hill was re-annexed to Newark's Vailsburg.[43] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area 
of 26.107 square miles (67.617 km2), including 24.187 square miles (62.644 km2) 
of land and 1.920 square miles (4.973 km2) of water (7.35%) was water.[1][2] 
It has the third-smallest land area among the 100 most populous cities 
in the U.S., behind neighboring Jersey City and Hialeah, Florida.[44] The 
city's altitude ranges from 0 (sea level) in the east to approximately 
230 feet (70 m) above sea level in the western section of the city.[45] 
Newark is essentially a large basin sloping towards the Passaic River, 
with a few valleys formed by meandering streams. Historically, Newark's 
high places have been its wealthier neighborhoods. In the 19th century 
and early 20th century, the wealthy congregated on the ridges of Forest 
Hill, High Street, and Weequahic.[46] Until the 20th century, the marshes 
on Newark Bay were difficult to develop, as the marshes were essentially 
wilderness, with a few dumps, warehouses, and cemeteries on their edges. 
During the 20th century, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey 
was able to reclaim 68 acres (28 ha) of the marshland for the further expansion 
of Newark Airport, as well as the growth of the port lands.[30] Newark 
is surrounded by residential suburbs to the west (on the slope of the Watchung 
Mountains), the Passaic River and Newark Bay to the east, dense urban areas 
to the south and southwest, and middle-class residential suburbs and industrial 
areas to the north. The city is the largest in New Jersey's Gateway Region, 
which is said to have received its name from Newark's nickname as the "Gateway 
City".[47] Newark is New Jersey's largest and second-most racially diverse 
city (after neighboring Jersey City). It is divided into five political 
wards,[48] which are often used by residents to identify their place of 
habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific 
neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, 
the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the 
airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, 
while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, 
and West Wards.[49] State law requires that wards be compact and contiguous 
and that the largest ward may not exceed the population of the smallest 
by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, 
as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats 
and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk.[50] 
Redrawing of ward lines in previous decades have shifted traditional boundaries, 
so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. 
The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic 
reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion 
of the West Ward.[51][52][53] Newark's Central Ward, formerly known as 
the old Third Ward, contains much of the city's history including the original 
squares Lincoln Park, Military Park and Washington Park. The Ward contains 
the University Heights, The Coast/Lincoln Park, Government Center, Springfield/Belmont 
and Seventh Avenue neighborhoods. Of these neighborhood designations only 
University Heights, a more recent designation for the area that was the 
subject of the 1968 novel Howard Street by Nathan Heard, is still in common 
usage. The Central Ward extends at one point as far north as 2nd Avenue. 
In the 19th century, the Central Ward was inhabited by Germans and other 
white Catholic and Christian groups. The German inhabitants were later 
replaced by Jews, who were then replaced by Blacks. The increased academic 
footprint in the University Heights neighborhood has produced gentrification, 
with landmark buildings undergoing renovation. Located in the Central Ward 
is the largest health sciences university in the nation, UMDNJ-New Jersey 
Medical School. It is also home to three other universities – New Jersey 
Institute of Technology (NJIT), Rutgers University – Newark, and Essex 
County College. The Central Ward forms the present-day heart of Newark, 
and includes 26 public schools, two police precincts, including headquarters, 
four firehouses, and one branch library.[54] The North Ward is surrounded 
by Branch Brook Park. Its neighborhoods include Broadway, Mount Pleasant, 
Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section.[55] Forest Hill contains 
the Forest Hill Historic District, which is registered on state and national 
historic registers, and contains many older mansions and colonial homes. 
A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line 
Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has 
lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly 
further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North 
Ward historically had a large Italian population; demographics have transitioned 
to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically 
diverse.[55] The West Ward comprises the neighborhoods of Vailsburg, Ivy 
Hill, West Side, Fairmount and Lower Roseville. It is home to the historic 
Fairmount Cemetery. The West Ward, once a predominately Irish-American, 
Polish, and Ukrainian neighborhood, is now home to neighborhoods composed 
primarily of Latinos, African Americans, and Caribbean Americans.[56] The 
West Ward has struggled in recent years with elevated rates of crime, particularly 
violent crime.[57] The South Ward comprises the Weequahic, Clinton Hill, 
Dayton, and South Broad Valley neighborhoods. The South Ward, once home 
to residents of predominately Jewish descent, now has ethnic neighborhoods 
made up primarily of African Americans and Hispanics. The South Ward is 
represented by Council Member John Sharpe James. The city's second-largest 
hospital, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, can be found in the South 
Ward, as can 17 public schools, five daycare centers, three branch libraries, 
one police precinct, a mini precinct, and three fire houses.[58] The East 
Ward consists of much of Newark's Downtown commercial district, as well 
as the Ironbound neighborhood, where much of Newark's industry was located 
in the 19th century. Today, due to the enterprise of its immigrant population, 
the Ironbound (also known as "Down Neck" and "The Neck")[59] is a destination 
for shopping, dining, and nightlife.[60] A historically immigrant-dominated 
section of the city, the Ironbound in recent decades has been termed "Little 
Portugal" and "Little Brazil" due to its heavily Portuguese and Brazilian 
population; Newark being home to one of the largest Portuguese speaking 
communities in the United States. In addition, the East Ward has become 
home to various Latin Americans, African Americans, and commuters to Manhattan. 
Public education in the East Ward consists of East Side High School and 
six elementary schools. The ward is largely composed of densely packed 
housing, primarily large apartment buildings and rowhouses.[49][61][62] 
Newark lies in the transition between a humid subtropical and humid continental 
climate (Köppen Cfa/Dfa), with cold, damp winters and hot, humid summers. 
The January daily mean is 31.6 °F (−0.2 °C), and although temperatures 
below 10 °F (−12 °C) are to be expected in most years,[63] sub-0 °F (−18 °C) 
readings are rare; conversely, some days may warm up to 50 °F (10 °C). 
The average seasonal snowfall is 29.5 inches (75 cm), though variations 
in weather patterns may bring sparse snowfall in some years and several 
major Nor'easters in others, with the heaviest 24-hour fall of 25.9 inches 
(66 cm) occurring on December 26, 1947.[64] Spring and autumn in the area 
are generally unstable yet mild. The July daily mean is 77.4 °F (25.2 °C), 
and highs exceed 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 27 days per year,[64] not 
factoring in the oft-higher heat index. The city receives precipitation 
ranging from 2.9 to 4.8 inches (74 to 122 mm) per month, usually falling 
on 8 to 12 days per month. Extreme temperatures have ranged from −14 °F 
(−26 °C) on February 9, 1934 to 108 °F (42 °C) on July 22, 2011.[64] The 
city had a population of 277,140 as of the 2010 Census,[12] retaining its 
position as the largest city in the state and making it the nation's 67th 
most-populous municipality.[82] After reaching a peak of 442,337 residents 
counted in the 1930 Census, the city's population saw a decline of nearly 
40% as residents moved to surrounding suburbs, with the increase in 2010 
of 3,594 (+1.3%) from the 273,546 counted in the 2000 Census marking the 
second census in 70 years in which the city's population had grown from 
the previous enumeration.[9][10][11][83][84] "White flight" from Newark 
to the suburbs, which started in the 1940s accelerated in the 1960s.[85] 
The 1967 riots resulted in a significant population loss of the city's 
middle class, many of them Jewish, which continued from the 1970s through 
to the 1990s.[86] The city lost about 130,000 residents between 1960 and 
1990. From the 1950s to 1967, white population shrank from 363,000 to 158,000, 
its black population grew from 70,000 to 220,000.[87] The percentage of 
Non-Hispanic whites[81] declined from 82.8% in 1950 to 11.6% by 2010.[88] 
The percentage of Latinos in Newark grew between 1980 and 2010, from 18.6% 
to 33.8% while that of Blacks decreased from 58.2% to 52.4%.[89][90][91][92] 
Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark, despite its revitalization 
in recent years. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population 
was impoverished.[93] In advance of the 2000 United States Census, city 
officials made a push to get residents to respond and participate in the 
enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 
people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted 
in the loss of government aid and political representation.[94] It is believed 
that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted 
in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused 
to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit 
census forms because they believed that the information could be used to 
justify their deportation.[95] At the 2010 United States Census, there 
were 277,140 people, 94,542 households, and 61,641 families residing in 
the city. The population density was 11,458.3 per square mile (4,424.1/km2). 
There were 109,520 housing units at an average density of 4,528.1 per square 
mile (1,748.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 26.31% (72,914) White, 
52.35% (145,085) Black or African American, 0.61% (1,697) Native American, 
1.62% (4,485) Asian, 0.04% (118) Pacific Islander, 15.22% (42,181) from 
other races, and 3.85% (10,660) from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos 
of any race were 33.83% (93,746) of the population.[9] There were 94,542 
households, of which 33.7% had children under the age of 18 living with 
them, 28.0% were married couples living together, 28.9% had a female householder 
with no husband present, and 34.8% were non-families. 27.9% of all households 
were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 
65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.76 and the average 
family size was 3.36.[9] In the city, 25.6% of the population were under 
the age of 18, 11.9% from 18 to 24, 31.9% from 25 to 44, 22.1% from 45 
to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 32.3 
years. For every 100 females there were 97.9 males. For every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 96.3 males.[9] The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 
American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) 
median household income was $35,659 (with a margin of error of +/- $1,009) 
and the median family income was $41,684 (+/- $1,116). Males had a median 
income of $34,350 (+/- $1,015) versus $32,865 (+/- $973) for females. The 
per capita income for the city was $17,367 (+/- $364). About 22.0% of families 
and 25.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 34.9% 
of those under age 18 and 22.4% of those age 65 or over.[96] Newark was 
the 63rd-most-populous city as of the 2000 Census.[97] As of the 2000 United 
States Census[20] there were 273,546 people, 91,382 households, and 61,956 
families residing in the city. The population density was 11,495.0 per 
square mile (4,437.7/km²). There were 100,141 housing units at an average 
density of 4,208.1 per square mile (1,624.6//km²). The racial makeup of 
the city as of the 2000 Census was 53.46% (146,250) African American, 26.52% 
(72,537) White, 1.19% (3,263) Asian, 0.37% (1,005) Native American, 0.05% 
(135) Pacific Islander, 14.05% (38,430) from other races, and 4.36% (11,926) 
from two or more races. 29.47% (80,622) of the population were Hispanic 
or Latino of any race.[77][78] As of the 2000 Census, 49.2% of the city's 
80,622 residents who identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino were from 
Puerto Rico, while 9.4% were from Ecuador and 7.8% from the Dominican Republic.[98] 
There is a significant Portuguese-speaking community concentrated in the 
Ironbound district. 2000 Census data showed that Newark had 15,801 residents 
of Portuguese ancestry (5.8% of the population), while an additional 5,805 
(2.1% of the total) were of Brazilian ancestry.[99] There were 91,382 households 
out of which 35.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.0% 
were married couples living together, 29.3% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 32.2% were non-families. 26.6% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 8.8% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.8 and the average 
family size was 3.40.[77][78] In the city the age distribution of the population 
shows 27.9% under the age of 18, 12.1% from 18 to 24, 32.0% from 25 to 
44, 18.7% from 45 to 64, and 9.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The 
median age was 31 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.2 males. 
For every 100 females of age 18 and over, there were 91.1 males.[77][78] 
The median income for a household in the city was $26,913, and the median 
income for a family was $30,781. Males had a median income of $29,748 versus 
$25,734 for females. The per capita income for the city was $13,009. 28.4% 
of the population and 25.5% of families were below the poverty line. 36.6% 
of those under the age of 18 and 24.1% of those 65 and older were living 
below the poverty line. The city's unemployment rate was 8.5%.[77][78] 
More than 100,000 people commute to Newark each workday,[100] making it 
the state's largest employment center with many white-collar jobs in insurance, 
finance, import-export, health-care, and government.[101] As a major courthouse 
venue including federal, state, and county facilities, it is home to more 
than 1,000 law firms. The city is also a "college town", with nearly 50,000 
students attending the city's universities and medical and law schools.[102][103] 
Its airport, maritime port, rail facilities, and highway network make Newark 
the busiest transshipment hub on the East Coast in terms of volume.[104][105] 
Though Newark is not the industrial colossus of the past, the city does 
have a considerable amount of industry and light manufacturing.[106] The 
southern portion of the Ironbound, also known as the Industrial Meadowlands, 
has seen many factories built since World War II, including a large Anheuser-Busch 
brewery that opened in 1951 and distributed 7.5 million barrels of beer 
in 2007.[107] The service industry is also growing rapidly, replacing those 
in the manufacturing industry, which was once Newark's primary economy. 
In addition, transportation has become a large business in Newark, accounting 
for more than 17,000 jobs in 2011.[108] Newark is one of nine cities in 
New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by 
the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum 
of $50 million within 0.5 miles of a train station are eligible for pro-rated 
tax credit.[109][110] After the election of Cory Booker, millions of dollars 
of public-private partnership investment were made in Downtown development 
but persistent underemployment continue to characterize many of the city's 
neighborhoods.[111][112][113][114][115][116] Poverty remains a consistent 
problem in Newark. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population 
was impoverished.[93] Newark is the third-largest insurance center in the 
United States, after New York City and Hartford.[117] The Prudential Financial, 
Mutual Benefit Life, Fireman's Insurance, and American Insurance Company 
all originated in the city. The first, one of the largest insurance companies 
in the world, has its "home office in Newark.[118] Many other companies 
are headquartered in the city, including IDT Corporation, NJ Transit, Public 
Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), Manischewitz, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue 
Shield of New Jersey.[119][120] and Audible.com.[121] In 2013 Panasonic 
moved its North American headquarters to a new 250,000-square-foot (23,000 m2) 
office building.[122][123] Portions of Newark are part of an Urban Enterprise 
Zone. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment within the 
Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus 
the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.[124] While for years 
Newark was a food desert with a dearth of supermarkets, several new ones 
have opened or are planning to open since 2000, including a ShopRite supermarket 
and the upscale Whole Foods.[125][126] Port Newark is the part of Port 
Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal and the largest cargo facility in the 
Port of New York and New Jersey. Located on Newark Bay, it is run by the 
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and serves as the principal container 
ship facility for goods entering and leaving the New York metropolitan 
region and the northeastern quadrant of North America. The Port moved over 
$100 billion in goods in 2003, making it the 15th busiest in the world 
at the time, but was the number one container port as recently as 1985.[127] 
Plans are underway for billions of dollars of improvements – larger cranes, 
bigger railyard facilities, deeper channels, and expanded wharves.[128] 
There are several notable Beaux-Arts buildings, such as the Veterans' Administration 
building, the Newark Museum, the Newark Public Library, and the Cass Gilbert-designed 
Essex County Courthouse. Notable Art Deco buildings include several 1930s 
era skyscrapers, such as the National Newark Building and Eleven 80, the 
restored Newark Penn Station, and Arts High School. Gothic architecture 
can be found at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart by Branch Brook Park, 
which is one of the largest gothic cathedrals in the United States. It 
is rumored to have as much stained glass as the Cathedral of Chartres. 
Newark also has two public sculpture works by Gutzon Borglum — Wars of 
America in Military Park and Seated Lincoln in front of the Essex County 
Courthouse. Moorish Revival buildings include Newark Symphony Hall and 
the Prince Street Synagogue, one of the oldest synagogue buildings in New 
Jersey.[129] The New Jersey Performing Arts Center, located near Military 
Park opened in 1997, is the home of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and 
the New Jersey State Opera, The center's programs of national and international 
music, dance, and theater make it the nation's sixth-largest performing 
arts center, attracting over 400,000 visitors each year.[130] Prior to 
the opening of the performing arts center, Newark Symphony Hall was home 
to the New Jersey Symphony, the New Jersey State Opera, and the Garden 
State Ballet, which stills maintains an academy there.[131] The 1925 neo-classic 
building, originally built by the Shriners, has three performance spaces, 
including the main concert named in honor of famous Newarker Sarah Vaughan, 
offering rhythm and blues, rap, hip-hop, and gospel music concerts, and 
is part of the modern-day Chitlin' Circuit.[132] The Newark Boys Chorus, 
founded in 1966, performs regularly in the city. The African Globe Theater 
Works presents a new works seasonally. The biennial Geraldine R. Dodge 
Poetry Festival took place in Newark for the first time in 2010.[133] Venues 
at the universities in the city are also used to present professional and 
semi-professional theater, dance, and music. Since its opening, the Prudential 
Center in 2007 has presented Diana Ross, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Britney 
Spears, The Eagles, Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus, Spice Girls, Jonas Brothers, 
Metro Station, Metallica, Alicia Keys, Demi Lovato, David Archuleta, Taylor 
Swift and American Idol Live!, among others. Bon Jovi performed a series 
of ten concerts to mark the venue's opening.[134] The Newark Museum is 
the largest in New Jersey. Highlights of its collection include American 
and Tibetan art. The museum also contains science galleries, a planetarium, 
a gallery for children's exhibits, a fire museum, a sculpture garden and 
an 18th-century schoolhouse. Also part of the museum is the historic John 
Ballantine House, a restored Victorian mansion which is a National Historic 
Landmark. The museum co-sponsors the Newark Black Film Festival, which 
has premiered numerous films since its founding in 1974.[135] The city 
is also home to the New Jersey Historical Society, which has rotating exhibits 
on New Jersey and Newark. The Newark Public Library, the state's largest 
system with 11 locations, also produces a series of historical exhibits. 
The library houses more than a million volumes and has frequent exhibits 
on a variety of topics, many featuring items from its Fine Print and Special 
Collections.[136] Since 1962, Newark has been home to the Institute of 
Jazz Studies, the world's foremost jazz archives and research libraries.[137] 
Located in the John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers-Newark, the Institute 
houses more than 200,000 jazz recordings in all commercially available

Children's Museum of New Jersey to be created across from Newark Penn Station.[146] 
These plans have yet to be realized. According to planners, due to a reported 
lack of funding and a poor economy, "the project went to sleep".[147] Since 
2009, the Newark Planning Office, in collaboration with local arts organizations,

in 1915 to test panel switching technology; using an exchange called Mulberry 
which cutover on January 16, 1915, and then the Waverly exchange which 
cutover on June 12, 1915; the Panel system was the Bell answer to the big 
city problem. As originally introduced in these exchanges, subscribers 
had no dials on their telephones and continued to make calls by asking 
an operator to ring their called party, at which point the operator keyed 
the number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections 
manually.[156] New Jersey's first television station, WATV Channel 13,

Newark has been marred with episodes of political corruption throughout 
the years. Five of the previous seven mayors of Newark have been indicted 
on criminal charges, including the three mayors before Cory Booker: Hugh 
Addonizio, Kenneth Gibson and Sharpe James. As reported by Newsweek: "... 
every mayor since 1962 (except one, Cory Booker) has been indicted for 
crimes committed while in office".[245] Addonizio was mayor of Newark from 
1962 to 1970. A son of Italian immigrants, a tailor and World War II veteran, 
he ran on a reform platform, defeating the incumbent, Leo Carlin, whom, 
ironically, Addonizio characterized as corrupt and a part of the political 
machine of the era. In December 1969, Addonizio and nine present or former 
officials of the municipal administration in Newark were indicted by a 
Federal grand jury; five other persons were also indicted.[246] In July 
1970, the former mayor, and four other defendants, were found guilty by 
a Federal jury on 64 counts each, one of conspiracy and 63 of extortion.[247] 
In September 1970, Addonizio was sentenced to ten years in federal prison 
and fined $25,000 by Federal Judge George Herbert Barlow for his role in 
a plot that involved the extortion of $1.5 million in kickbacks, a crime 
that the judge said "tore at the very heart of our civilized society and 
our form of representative government".[248][249] His successor was Kenneth 
Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, elected in 1970. He pleaded 
guilty to federal tax evasion in 2002 as part of a plea agreement on fraud 
and bribery charges. During his tenure as mayor in 1980, Gibson was tried 
and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury.[250] 
Sharpe James, who defeated Gibson in 1986 and declined to run for a sixth 
term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and 
wire fraud by a federal grand jury sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged 
James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain 
and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices 
to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained 
a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his 
initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was 
found guilty for his role in the conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned 
properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up 
to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.[251] 
Newark is the home of the multiple institutions of higher education, including: 
a Berkeley College campus,[252] the main campus of Essex County College,[253] 
New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT),[254] the Newark Campus of Rutgers 
Biomedical and Health Sciences (formerly University of Medicine and Dentistry 
of New Jersey),[255] Rutgers University–Newark[256] and Seton Hall University 
School of Law.[257] Most of Newark's academic institutions are located 
in the city's University Heights district. The colleges and universities 
have worked together to help revitalize the area, which serves more than 
50,000 students and faculty.[258] As of the 2006–2010 American Community 
Survey, 16.0% of Newark residents ages 25 and over had never attended high 
school and 15.9% didn't graduate, while 68.1% had at least graduated from 
high school, including the 12.3% who had earned a bachelor's degree or 
higher. The total school enrollment in Newark city was 75,025 in the 2006–2010 
ACS, with pre-primary school enrollment of 10,560, elementary or high school 
enrollment of 46,691 and college enrollment of 17,774.[96] The Newark Public 
Schools, a state-operated school district, is the largest school system 
in New Jersey. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts statewide,[259] 
which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the requirement for 
the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation projects 
in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Development 
Authority.[260][261] As of the 2013–14 school year, the district's 73 schools 
had an enrollment of 34,976 students and 3,057 classroom teachers (on an 
FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.4:1.[262] Science Park High 
School, which was the 69th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out 
of 322 schools statewide, in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2010 
cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", after being ranked 
50th in 2008 out of 316 schools. Technology High School has a GreatSchools 
rating of 9/10 was ranked 165th in New Jersey Monthly's 2010 rankings. 
Newark high schools ranked in the bottom 10% of the New Jersey Monthly 
2010 list include Central (274th), East Side (293rd), Newark Vocational 
(304th), Weequahic (310th), Barringer (311th), Malcolm X Shabazz (314th) 
and West Side (319th).[263] Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg donated 
a challenge grant of $100 million to the district in 2010, choosing Newark 
because he stated he believed in Mayor Cory Booker and Governor Chris Christie's 
abilities.[264] Charter schools in Newark include the Robert Treat Academy 
Charter School, a National Blue Ribbon School drawing students from all 
over Newark. It remains one of the top performing K-8 schools in New Jersey 
based on standardized test scores.[265] University Heights Charter School 
is another charter school, serving children in grades K-5, recognized as 
a 2011 Epic Silver Gain School.[266] Gray Charter School, like Robert Treat, 
also won a Blue Ribbon Award.[267] Also, Newark Collegiate Academy (NCA) 
opened in August 2007 and currently serves 420 students in grades 9–12. 
It will ultimately serve over 570 students, mostly matriculating from other 
charter schools in the area.[268] The city hosts three high schools as 
part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark: the coeducational Christ 
The King Prep, founded in 2007, is part of the Cristo Rey Community; Saint 
Benedict's Preparatory School is an all-boys Roman Catholic high school 
founded in 1868 and conducted by the Benedictine monks of Newark Abbey, 
whose campus has grown to encompass both sides of MLK Jr. Blvd. near Market 
Street and includes a dormitory for boarding students; and Saint Vincent 
Academy, is an all-girls Roman Catholic high school founded and sponsored 
by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and operated continuously 
since 1869.[269] Link Community School is a non-denominational coeducational 
day school located serving approximately 128 students in seventh and eighth 
grades. The Newark Boys Chorus School was founded in the 1960s.[270] University 
Heights Charter School, which opened in 2006, taught 614 students in grades 
PK-8 in 2014–2015.[271] Newark is a hub of air, road, rail, and ship traffic, 
making it a significant gateway into the New York metropolitan area and 
the northeastern United States.[272] Newark Liberty International Airport 
is the second-busiest airport in the New York region and the 15th-busiest 
in the United States (in terms of passenger traffic).[273] Newark Airport 
was the New York City area's first commercial airport, opened in 1928 on 
land reclaimed by the Port Authority.[30] Just east of the airport lies 
Port Newark, the fifteenth-busiest port in the world and the largest container 
port on the East Coast of the United States. In 2003, the port moved over 
$100 billion in goods.[274] The Morris Canal, stretching 102 miles (164 km) 
to Newark from Phillipsburg on the Delaware River, was completed in 1831 
and allowed coal and other industrial and agricultural products from Pennsylvania 
to be transported cheaply and efficiently to the New York metropolitan 
area. The canal's completion led to increased settlement in Newark, vastly 
increasing the population for years to come. After the canal was decommissioned, 
the its right of way was converted into the Newark City Subway, now known 
as the Newark Light Rail. Many of the subway stations still portray the 
canal in its original state, in the form of mosaic works.[275] As the city 
became increasingly congested further means of transportation were sought, 
eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced 
by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, 
including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse[276] The 
trolley cars did not last long as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained 
popularity and slowly made the trolley system seem like a burden.[277] 
As of May 2010[update], the city had a total of 368.21 miles (592.58 km) 
of roadways, of which 318.77 miles (513.01 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
17.61 miles (28.34 km) by Essex County and 22.66 miles (36.47 km) by the 
New Jersey Department of Transportation and 9.17 miles (14.76 km) by the 
New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[278] Newark is served by numerous highways 
including the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Interstate 280, Interstate 
78, the Garden State Parkway, U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 22, and Route 
21. Newark is connected to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan by the 
Pulaski Skyway, spanning both the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers, which 
was first constructed in 1938 and will be undergoing a $900 million renovation 
project.[279] Local streets in Newark conform to a quasi-grid form, with 
major streets radiating outward (like spokes on a wheel) from the downtown 
area. Some major roads in the city are named after the towns to which they 
lead, including South Orange Avenue, Springfield Avenue, and Bloomfield 
Avenue, as well as Broadway, which had been renamed from Belleville Avenue.[280] 
In a city extensively served by mass transit, 44.2% of Newark residents 
did not have a car as of the 2000 Census, ranked second in the U.S. to 
New York City in the proportion of households without an automobile among 
cities with more than 250,000 people.[281] Newark Penn Station, situated 
just east of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served 
by the interurban PATH train (which links Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), 
three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. It was 
designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. One mile north, 
the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. 
The two train stations are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which 
also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities 
and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built in the 
bed of the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's 
downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International 
Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark.

Carmel Guild Hospital and the United Hospitals Medical Center.[290][291][292] 
University Hospital EMS (UH-EMS) operates the EMS system for the city. 
The department operates a fleet of six BLS units staffed with two EMTs 
24/7, four 12-hour power trucks, and five ALS units staffed with two paramedics 
(one of which is stationed at Newark Airport and covers the airport and 
Port Newark-Elizabeth, and frequently responds into the City of Elizabeth). 
With distinction they also staff the only hospital based heavy rescue truck 
in the country. The EMS system is the busiest system per unit in the nation. 
On average, a BLS unit may be sent to 20-25 dispatches in a 12-hour shift. 
They also provide the medical staffing for Northstar, with one of the two 
NJ State Police medevac helicopters, staffing one flight nurse and a flight 
medic around the clock. The EMS system in Newark handles upwards of 125,000 
requests for service annually.[293] The city is protected by more than 
700 full-time, paid firefighters of the Newark Fire Department (NFD). Founded

recorded a total of 99 homicides for the year, representing a significant 
drop from the record of 161 murders set in 1981.[301][302][303][304] The 
number of murders in 2008 dropped to 65, a decline of 30% from the previous 
year and the lowest in the city since 2002 when there were also 65 murders.[305] 
In 2010, Newark recorded 90 homicides.[306] March 2010 was the first calendar 
month since 1966 in which the city did not record a homicide.[307] Overall, 
there was a 6% increase in crime numbers over the previous year, including 
a rise in carjackings for the third straight year, with the 337 incidents 
raising concerns that the city was returning to its status as the "car 
theft capital of the world".[308] Along with the increase in crime, the 
Newark Police Department increased its recovery of illegally owned guns 
in 2011 to 696, up from 278 in 2010.[309] The Federal Bureau of Investigation

by FBI Crime in the United States 2011 report.[311] The city had 10 murders 
in 10 days during the period ending September 6, 2013, a statistic largely 
attributed to the reduction of the police force.[312][313] In 2013 Newark 
recorded 111 homicides, the first year ending in triple digits in seven 
years [314] and the highest tally since 1990, accounting for 27% of all 
murders statewide.[315] In 2014, the total number of homicides in Newark
