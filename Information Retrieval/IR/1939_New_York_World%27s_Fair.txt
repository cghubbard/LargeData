The 1939–40 New York World's Fair, which covered the 1,216 acres (492 ha) 
of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park (also the location of the 1964–1965 New 
York World's Fair), was the second most expansive American world's fair 
of all time, exceeded only by St. Louis's Louisiana Purchase Exposition 
of 1904. Many countries around the world participated in it, and over 44 
million people attended its exhibits in two seasons.[1] The NYWF of 1939–1940 
was the first exposition to be based on the future, with an opening slogan 
of "Dawn of a New Day", and it allowed all visitors to take a look at "the 
world of tomorrow". According to the official New York World's Fair pamphlet: 
The eyes of the Fair are on the future — not in the sense of peering toward 
the unknown nor attempting to foretell the events of tomorrow and the shape 
of things to come, but in the sense of presenting a new and clearer view 
of today in preparation for tomorrow; a view of the forces and ideas that 
prevail as well as the machines. To its visitors the Fair will say: "Here 
are the materials, ideas, and forces at work in our world. These are the 
tools with which the World of Tomorrow must be made. They are all interesting 
and much effort has been expended to lay them before you in an interesting 
way. Familiarity with today is the best preparation for the future. Within 
six months of the Fair's opening, the Second World War would begin, an 
event that lasted six years and resulted in the deaths of over 50 million 
people. In 1935, at the height of the Great Depression, a group of New 
York City businessmen decided to create an international exposition to 
lift the city and the country out of depression. Not long after, these 
men formed the New York World's Fair Corporation, whose office was placed 
on one of the higher floors in the Empire State Building. The NYWFC elected 
former chief of police Grover Whalen as the president of their committee. 
The committee included Winthrop Aldrich, Mortimer Buckner, Floyd Carlisle, 
Ashley T. Cole, John J. Dunnigan, Harvey Dow Gibson, Mayor Fiorello La 
Guardia, Percy S. Straus, and many other business leaders. Over the next 
four years, the committee planned, built, and organized the fair and its 
exhibits, with countries around the world taking part in creating the biggest 
international event since World War I. Working closely with the Fair's 
committee was Robert Moses, New York City Parks Commissioner, who saw great 
value to the City in having the World's Fair Corporation (at its expense) 
remove a vast ash dump in Queens that was to be the site for the exposition. 
This event turned the area into a City park after the exposition closed. 
Edward Bernays directed public relations of the fair in 1939, which he 
called 'democricity'.[2] Grover Whalen, a public relations innovator, saw 
the Fair as an opportunity for corporations to present consumer products, 
rather than as an exercise in presenting science and the scientific way 
of thinking in its own right, as Harold Urey, Albert Einstein and other 
scientists wished to see the project.[3] "As events transpired", reported 
Carl Sagan,[4] whose own interest in science was nevertheless sparked by 
the Fair's gadgetry, "almost no real science was tacked on to the Fair's 
exhibits, despite the scientists' protests and their appeals to high principles." 
Promotion of this great event took many forms. In 1938, the Brooklyn Dodgers, 
New York Giants, and New York Yankees baseball teams did their part to 
promote the upcoming fair by wearing patches on their jerseys featuring 
the Trylon, Perisphere, and "1939" on their left sleeve. Howard Hughes 
flew a special World's Fair flight around the world to promote the fair 
in 1938. While the main purpose of the fair was to lift the spirits of 
the United States and drive much-needed business to New York City, it was 
also felt that there should be a cultural or historical association. It 
was therefore decided that the fair opening would correspond to the 150th 
anniversary of George Washington's first inauguration as President of the 
United States, and WPA artists painted murals which appeared in the New 
York Times Magazine.[5] On April 30, 1939, a very hot Sunday, the fair 
had its grand opening, with 206,000 people in attendance. The April 30 
date coincided with the 150th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration, 
in Lower Manhattan, as the first President of the United States. Although 
many of the pavilions and other facilities were not quite ready for this 
opening, it was put on with pomp and great celebration. David Sarnoff, 
then president of RCA and a strong advocate of television, chose to introduce 
television to the mass public at the RCA pavilion. As a reflection of the 
wide range of technological innovation on parade at the fair, Franklin 
D. Roosevelt's speech was not only broadcast over the various radio networks 
but also was televised along with other parts of the opening ceremony and 
other events at the fair. On April 30, 1939, the opening ceremony and President 
Roosevelt's speech were seen on black and white television sets with 5 
to 12-inch tubes.[6] NBC used the event to inaugurate regularly scheduled 
television broadcasts in New York City over their station W2XBS (now WNBC). 
An estimated 1,000 people viewed the Roosevelt telecast on about 200 television 
sets scattered throughout the New York metropolitan area. In order to convince 
skeptical visitors that the television sets were not a trick, one set was 
made with a transparent case so that the internal components could be seen. 
As part of the exhibit at the RCA pavilion, visitors could see themselves 
on television. There were also television demonstrations at the General 
Electric and Westinghouse pavilions. During this formal introduction at 
the fair, television sets became available for public purchase at various 
stores in the New York City area.[6] After Albert Einstein gave a speech 
that discussed cosmic rays, the fair's lights were ceremonially lit. Dignitaries 
received a special Opening Day Program which contained their names written 
in Braille. One of the first exhibits to receive attention was the Westinghouse 
Time Capsule, which was not to be opened for 5,000 years (the year 6939). 
The time capsule was a tube containing writings by Albert Einstein and 
Thomas Mann, copies of Life Magazine, a Mickey Mouse watch, a Gillette 
safety razor, a kewpie doll, a dollar in change, a pack of Camel cigarettes, 
millions of pages of text on microfilm, and much more. The capsule also 
contained seeds of foods in common use at the time: (wheat, corn, oats, 
tobacco, cotton, flax, rice, soy beans, alfalfa, sugar beets, carrots and 
barley, all sealed in glass tubes). The time capsule is located at 40°44′34.089″N 
73°50′43.842″W﻿ / ﻿40.74280250°N 73.84551167°W﻿ / 40.74280250; -73.84551167, 
at a depth of 50 feet (15 m). A small stone plaque marks the position.[7] 
Westinghouse also featured "Elektro the Moto-Man": the 7-foot (2.1 m) tall 
robot that talked, differentiated colors, and even "smoked" cigarettes.[8] 
On July 3, 1940, the fair hosted "Superman Day". Notable was the crowning 
of the "Super-Boy and Super-Girl of the Day" following an athletic contest, 
and a public appearance by Superman, played by an unidentified man. Broadway 
actor Ray Middleton, who served as a judge for the contest, is often credited 
with having appeared in the Superman costume on Superman Day, but he did 
not; however, he may have played Superman during a live radio broadcast 
from the scene. Although the unknown man in the costume is often said to 
have been the first actor ever to play Superman, Bud Collyer had been performing 
the role on the Superman radio series since the preceding February. The 
fair was also the occasion for the 1st World Science Fiction Convention, 
subsequently dubbed "Nycon 1". Ralph Vaughan Williams composed his work 
for harp and string orchestra Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus on commission 
from the World's Fair. The first performance was at Carnegie Hall in June 
1939, conducted by Adrian Boult.[9] In addition, the British Council commissioned 
a piano concerto from Arthur Bliss for the British Week at the World's 
Fair. Adrian Boult conducted the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra 
in Carnegie Hall on June 10, 1939 with Solomon as the soloist.[10] Ceramic 
sculptor Waylande Gregory created The Fountain of the Atom, which displayed 
the largest ceramic sculptures in modern times.[11] It included the four 
Elements, each measuring 72 inches (180 cm) high and each weighing over 
a ton. There were also eight electrons, which were illustrated in Life 
Magazine (March 1939). Gregory also created two exhibitions featuring his 
ceramic sculptures for the General Motors Building, American Imports and 
American Exports. Nylon fabric, the View-Master, and Scentovision (an early 
version of Smell-O-Vision) were introduced at the Fair. Other exhibits 
included Vermeer's painting The Milkmaid from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam,[12] 
a streamlined pencil sharpener, a diner (still in operation as the White 
Mana in Jersey City, New Jersey), a futuristic car-based city by General 
Motors, and early televisions.[13] There was also a huge globe/planetarium 
located near the center of the fair. Bell Labs' Voder, a keyboard-operated 
speech synthesizer, was demonstrated at the Fair. The fair was divided 
into differently themed zones, such as the Transportation Zone, the Communications 
and Business Systems Zone, the Food Zone, the Government Zone, and so forth. 
Virtually every structure erected on the fairgrounds was extraordinary, 
and many of them were experimental in many ways. Architects were encouraged 
by their corporate or government sponsors to be creative, energetic and 
innovative. Novel building designs, materials and furnishings were the 
norm. Many of the zones were arranged in a semicircular pattern, centered 
on the Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz-designed Theme Center, which 
consisted of two all-white, landmark monumental buildings named the Trylon 
(over 700 feet (210 m) tall) and the Perisphere which one entered by a 
moving stairway and exited via a grand curved walkway named the "Helicline". 
Inside the Perisphere was a "model city of tomorrow that visitors" viewed 
from a moving walkway high above the floor level. The zones were distinguished 
by many color cues, including different wall colors and tints and differently 
colored lighting. The colors blue and orange were chosen as the official 
colors of the fair, as they were the colors of New York City, and featured 
prominently. Only the Trylon and Perisphere were all white; avenues stretching 
out into the zones from the Theme Center were designed with rich colors 
that changed the further one walked from the center of the grounds. For 
example, the exhibits and other facilities along the Avenue of Pioneers 
were in a progression of blues, starting with pale tints and ending in 
deep ultramarine. At night, with the latest in lighting technology switched 
on, the effect was felt by many visitors to be a magical experience.[citation 
needed] Outdoor public lighting was at the time of a very limited and pedestrian 
nature, perhaps consisting of simple incandescent pole lamps in a city 
and nothing in the country. Electrification was still very new and had 
not reached everywhere in the US. The fair was the first public demonstration 
of several lighting technologies that would become common in future decades. 
These technologies included the introduction of the first fluorescent light 
and fixture. General Electric Corporation held the patent to the fluorescent 
light bulb at the time. Approximately a year later, the original three 
major corporations, Lightolier, Artcraft Fluorescent Lighting Corporation, 
and Globe Lighting, located mostly in the New York City region, began wide-scale 
manufacturing in the US of the fluorescent light fixture. Another theme 
of the fair was the emerging new middle class, leading a hoped-for recovery 
from the Great Depression. The fair promoted the "Middleton Family"—Babs, 
Bud, and their parents—who appeared in ads showing them taking in the sights 
of the fair and the new products being manufactured to make life easier 
and affordable, such as the new automatic dishwasher. Each day at the fair 
was a special theme day, for which a special button was issued; for example, 
May 18, 1939 was "Asbury Park, New Jersey Day". Some of these buttons are 
very rare and all are considered collectibles. In 1940, the theme of the 
fair was changed to "For Peace and Freedom" as war in Europe escalated. 
One poster from that year's fair, issued by Borden's Milk, had Elsie the 
Cow proclaiming "makes you proud to be an American".[citation needed] With 
its vast area and prominent location just south of the Theme Center, the 
Transportation Zone pavilions attracted widespread attention. Perhaps the 
most popular of the Transportation Zone pavilions was the one built for 
General Motors. There, the 36,000 square feet (3,300 m2) Futurama exhibit, 
designed by famed industrial designer and theater set designer Norman Bel 
Geddes, transported fair visitors over a huge diorama of a fictional section 
of the United States that was designed with a stunning array of miniature 
highways, towns, 500,000 individually designed homes, 50,000 miniature 
vehicles, waterways, and a million miniature trees of diverse species.[14] 
These elements of the diorama gradually became larger as the visitors, 
seated in chairs overhead, moved through the exhibit, until the cars and 
other elements of the exhibit became life-size. At the conclusion of the 
ride the visitors to the pavilion exited into an area that was constructed 
as a life-size city intersection with multistory buildings and stores on 
all sides. The stores included an auto dealership and an appliance store 
where visitors could see the latest GM and Frigidaire products. As with 
almost all pavilions in the fair, these showcases were not only intended 
to get people to buy the sponsor's products, they were also intended to 
educate and inform the populace about basic materials and processes that 
were then very new and not well known. Many experimental product concepts 
and new materials were shown that were not currently available for purchase, 
but would become available in various ways over the next few years. In 
many ways the fair pavilions more resembled a modern-day government-sponsored 
science fair exhibit than they would resemble modern corporate advertising 
and sales promotions. Adjacent to the GM pavilion was the Ford Pavilion, 
where race car drivers drove on a figure eight track on the building's 
roof endlessly, day in and day out. Not far from GM and Ford was the Chrysler 
exhibit group, where an audience in a theater with air conditioning, then 
a new technology, could watch a Plymouth being assembled in an early 3D 
film. Railroads were a major form of transportation for both passengers 
and freight in 1939, as airlines are for passengers today. Many visitors 
to the fair would have arrived in New York by railroad, and most visitors 
had at least a moderate interest in the topic. The centerpiece of the Railroad 
Conference exhibits (on seventeen acres) was "Railroads on Parade", a spectacular 
live drama re-enacting the birth and growth of railroads. It had music 
by Kurt Weil and choreography by Bill Matons.[15] In addition to the show, 
there were important historical objects on display by the various railroads 
and manufacturing companies, such as the Tom Thumb engine. The Pennsylvania 
Railroad (PRR) had its S1 engine on display, mounted on rollers under the 
driver wheels and running continuously at 60 mph (97 km/h) all day long. 
The British London Midland & Scottish Railway sent their Coronation Scot 
express train with a locomotive LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 Duchess 
of Hamilton, (disguised as sister locomotive 6220 Coronation), to the fair.[16][17] 
GM's Electro-Motive Division had a display of their then new streamlined 
diesel-electric passenger locomotives. The Italian state railways displayed 
one of their record-setting ETR 200 electric multiple unit cars. A visitor 
walking to the left of the Theme Center on the Avenue of Patriots would 
visit the Communications and Business Systems focal exhibits. At the AT&T 
Pavilion the Voder, a mechanized, synthetic voice, spoke to attendees, 
foretelling the widespread use of electronic voices decades later. At the 
IBM pavilion, electric typewriters and a fantastic machine called the "electric 
calculator" that used punched cards, were on display. IBM also had a fine 
art gallery with hundreds of artworks from 70 countries around the world. 
The exhibit for Firestone Tires featured the famous pygmy hippo, Billy, 
who had been a pet of former US President Calvin Coolidge. Next door to 
these business exhibits was the "Masterpieces of Art" building housing 
300 priceless works of the Old Masters, from the Middle Ages to 1800. Whalen 
and his team were able to borrow priceless paintings and sculptures from 
Europe and hang them in a graceful, understated building in Queens for 
two years. Thirty five galleries featured great works from DaVinci and 
Michelangelo to Rembrandt, from Hals to Caravaggio and Bellini. The 60 
foreign governments that participated in the fair contributed a wide diversity 
of creatively designed pavilions housing a stunning array of cultural offerings 
to fairgoers. The Italian pavilion attempted to fuse ancient Roman splendor 
with modern styles, and a 200-foot (61 m) high waterfall defined the pavilion's 
facade. Its popular restaurant was designed in the shape of the nation's 
luxury cruise line ships. The French pavilion, on the Court of Peace that 
was the grand open space northeast of the Theme Center, ran such a celebrated 
restaurant that after the fair closed and World War II ended, the restaurant 
remained in New York City. It soon established itself as one of the finest 
French dining establishments in the city: Le Pavillon.[citation needed] 
The copy of Magna Carta belonging to Lincoln Cathedral also left Britain 
in 1939 for the first time to be in the British Pavilion at the fair. Within 
months Britain joined World War II and it was deemed safer for it to remain 
in America until the end of hostilities. It therefore remained in Fort 
Knox, next to the original copy of the American constitution, until 1947. 
The Greek pavilion was especially interesting because it was a mirror of 
how the Metaxas quasi-fascist regime wanted to show Greece to the world. 
The interior rooms were designed by Nelly, the famous Greek photographer. 
Nelly's collages expressed four aspects of Greece: the legacy of ancient 
Greece, the Christian spirituality, picturesque landscapes and the Greek 
racial continuity. On one of its outside walls there were four big murals 
featuring four historic episodes of Greek history, authored by Gerasimos 
Steris. After the Fair concluded, the pavilion was dismantled and parts 
of it were donated for the construction of the Greek Orthodox cathedral 
of Saint Nicholas in Tarpon Springs, Florida.[18] The Jewish Palestine 
Pavilion introduced the world to the concept of a modern Jewish state, 
which a decade later would become Israel. The pavilion featured on its 
façade a monumental hammered copper relief sculpture titled The Scholar, 
The Laborer, and the Toiler of the Soil by the noted Art Deco sculptor 
Maurice Ascalon. Second Polish Republic prepared some 200 tons of various 
works of art. In mid-February 1939, all items were transported by train 
to the port of Gdynia, where they were loaded on MS Batory, which left 
Gdynia on February 28. Among most important items, presented by Poland 
in New York City, were: a royal carpet of King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk, 
seven paintings presenting important events of Polish history, 150 contemporary 
Polish paintings, a gunmetal monument of Jozef Pilsudski, an armor of a 
Polish hussar from Kornik Castle, ancient Polish weaponry (14th–18th centuries), 
a bell manufactured for the purpose of the Fair, folk costumes, house furniture 
from different regions of Poland and examples of Polish inventions. Exhibitions 
in the USSR Pavilion included the life-size copy of the interior of the 
showcase Mayakovskaya station of the Moscow Metro. Designer of the station 
Alexey Dushkin was awarded Grand Prize of the 1939 New York World's Fair.[19] 
Continuing outward from the Theme Center one saw the Food Zone. Among the 
many unique exhibits was the Borden's exhibit, that featured 150 pedigreed 
cows (including the original Elsie) on a Rotolactor that allowed bathing 
them, drying them, and milking them in a highly mechanized way. While no 
such complete system has ever become common in milk production, many of 
its features are in everyday use in today's rotary milking parlors. Next 
door was the Continental Baking exhibit, presenting a vast, continuous 
process of baking breads and other products. Consistent with the representative 
design sense of the Fair, this building was fashioned in the shape of a 
huge packaged bread loaf, white with red, yellow, and blue balloons on 
its curved facade. Americans today will recognize this as the packaging 
for Wonder Bread. Behind the exhibit was a field from which wheat was harvested 
and used in the baking process. There was a sign in the field that noted 
that this was the first time in over 100 years that wheat had been grown 
within the incorporated bounds of New York City. Beyond the corporate and 
government zones, the wildly popular but less uplifting Amusements Area 
was not integrated into the thematic matrix, and was a mere Area rather 
than a Zone. Despite the high-minded educational tone that Grover Whalen 
attempted to set, the Amusements Area was the most popular part of the 
Fair, and included a roller coaster, the Life Savers Parachute Jump (later 
moved to Coney Island, where it still stands today), the 3 ft (914 mm) 
narrow gauge Gimbels Flyer train ride (later purchased by Kennywood, where 
it still runs today),[20] and carnival acts such as a collection of performing 
dwarves. Frank Buck exhibited his "Frank Buck's Jungleland", which displayed 
rare birds, reptiles and wild animals along with Jiggs, a five-year-old 
trained orangutan. In addition, Buck provided a trio of performing elephants, 
an 80-foot (24 m) "monkey mountain" with 600 monkeys, and an attraction 
that had been popular at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair: camel rides.[21] 
A number of the shows provided spectators with the opportunity of viewing 
women in very revealing costumes or topless, such as the "Frozen Alive 
Girl", the Living Pictures, and the Dream of Venus building. This last 
attraction was a pavilion designed by the Spanish surrealist artist Salvador 
Dalí which contained within it a number of unusual sculptures and statues 
as well as live nearly-nude performers posing as statues.[22][23] While 
there were a number of protests by prominent politicians over the course 
of the fair about the "low minded entertainment," and the New York Vice 
Squad raided shows in the area on several occasions, the public generally 
accepted this form of entertainment. The Bendix Lama Temple [24] was a 
28,000-piece full-sized replica of the 1767 Potala temple in Jehol, Manchuria, 
commissioned and brought back by the industrialist and explorer Vincent 
Bendix.[25][26][27] The Temple had previously been exhibited at the 1933 
Chicago World's Fair, called "Century of Progress".[28] In New York, the 
Temple contained a girlie show. The Billy Rose Aquacade was a spectacular 
musical and water extravaganza foreshadowing the form of many popular Hollywood 
musicals in the ensuing years. The show was presented in a special amphitheater 
seating 10,000 people and included an orchestra to accompany the spectacular 
synchronized swimming performance. It featured Johnny Weismuller and Eleanor 
Holm, two of the most celebrated swimmers of the era, and dazzled fairgoers 
with its lighting and cascades and curtains of water, pumped in waterfalls 
at 8000 gallons a minute. The cost of admission was 80 cents. The Aquacade 
facility itself served as an entertainment venue in the park for many years 
afterward, including the 1964–65 World's Fair, but fell into disrepair 
in the 1980s and was finally demolished in 1996. The New York World's Fair 
of 1939 was just the place to promote neighborly relations between the 
US and Latin America. Placed against the backdrop of a growing Nazi threat, 
the World's Fair was an attempt to escape from the looming prospect of 
war and to promote peace and interdependence between nations. With the 
fair boasting over 60 countries, with some coming from Latin America, this 
was the place to redefine negative Latin American stereotypes.[29] Argentina, 
Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua and the Pan American 
Union were all represented at the World's Fair. Each country seized the 
opportunity to showcase their country and to make it more appealing to 
those around the world, especially in the United States. In their bid to 
increase cultural awareness at the World's Fair, the countries promoted 
tourism and strived to compare itself to the United States in an effort 
to appeal to Americans.[30] A special subway line, the IND World's Fair 
Line, was built to serve the fair. World's Fair (now Mets – Willets Point) 
station on the IRT Flushing Line was rebuilt to handle fair traffic on 
the IRT and BMT. A Long Island Rail Road station (now Mets – Willets Point) 
was built next to the Flushing Line station. The IND extension departed 
the IND Queens Boulevard Line east of the Forest Hills – 71st Avenue station 
and before the 75th Avenue station. The World's Fair station was at the 
east side of the Meadowlands at Horace Harding Boulevard. The period system 
route map and Fair maps display this temporary extension.[31] The World's 
Fair station was a terminus of the G train (alternate E trains also ran 
to World's Fair Station), and ran at ground level, separated from the Fair 
grounds by a fence, past the Jamaica Yard, which is still in use.[32] For 
the 1939–40 Fair, a special fleet of 50 "World's Fair Steinway" cars were 
delivered in late 1938 by the St. Louis Car Company for Flushing Line service. 
Car #5655 survives in the New York Transit Museum fleet. The fair was open 
for two seasons, from April to October each year, and was officially closed 
permanently on October 27, 1940. To get the fair's budget overruns under 
control before the 1940 season and to augment gate revenues, the fair management 
in the second year replaced Whalen with a banker, Harvey Gibson, and placed 
much greater emphasis on the amusement features and less on the educational 
and uplifting exhibits. The great fair attracted over 45 million visitors 
and generated roughly $48 million in revenue. Since the Fair Corporation 
had invested 67 million dollars (in addition to nearly a hundred million 
dollars from other sources), it was a financial failure, and the corporation 
declared bankruptcy.[citation needed] Many of the rides from the World's 
Fair were sold after its closure to Luna Park, Coney Island which was allowed 
to call itself the New York World's Fair of 1941.[33] The Parachute Jump 
was sold that same year to become the Parachute Jump at Steeplechase Park. 
The Unisphere, built as the theme symbol for the 1964/1965 World's Fair, 
now stands on the site occupied by the Perisphere during the earlier Fair. 
Although the United States would not enter World War II until the end of 
1941, the fairgrounds served as a window into the troubles overseas. The 
pavilions of Poland and Czechoslovakia, for example, did not reopen for 
the 1940 season. Also on July 4 that same year, two New York City Police 
Department officers were killed by a blast while investigating a time bomb 
left at the British Pavilion.[34] Countries under the thumb of the Axis 
powers in Europe in 1940 like Poland, Czechoslovakia, and France ran their 
pavilions with a special nationalistic pride. The only major world power 
that did not participate for the 1939 season was Germany, citing budget 
pressures. The USSR Pavilion was dismantled after the first season, leaving 
an empty lot called "The American Commons". When the fair closed, many 
among the European staff were unable to return to their home countries, 
so they remained in the US and in some cases exercised a tremendous influence 
on American culture. For example, Henri Soulé moved from the French Pavilion 
at the fair to open Le Pavillon restaurant, retaining Pierre Franey as 
head chef.[35][36] World War II presented additional problems with what 
to do with the exhibits on display in the pavilions of countries under 
Axis occupation. In the case of the Polish Pavilion, most of the items 
were sold by the Polish Government in exile in London to the Polish Museum 
of America and shipped to Chicago. A notable exception was made for a monument 
of the Polish–Lithuanian King Jagiełło to which Mayor Fiorello La Guardia 
took such a liking that he helped spearhead a campaign to have it installed 
in Central Park, where it still stands today.[37] Another building saved 
from 1940 was the Belgian Building designed by Henry Van de Velde. It was 
awarded to Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, and shipped 
to Richmond in 1941. The school still uses the building for its home basketball 
games.[38] After the Fair, the Temple was again disassembled, and placed 
in storage for many years. There were proposals to erect it at Oberlin 
College, Harvard University, Indiana University, and elsewhere, but they 
all failed for lack of funding. In 1984, the approximately 28,000 pieces 
were shipped to the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm, Sweden, with plans 
to rebuild it in a nearby park. Objections from the neighboring Chinese 
Embassy have stalled the project indefinitely.[26][27][39] Some of the 
buildings from the 1939 fair were used for the first temporary headquarters 
of the United Nations from 1946 until it moved in 1951 to its permanent 
headquarters in Manhattan. The former New York City building was used for 
the UN General Assembly during that time.[40] This building was later refurbished 
for the 1964 fair as the New York City Pavilion, featuring the Panorama 
of the City of New York, an enormous scale model of the entire city.[41] 
It became the home of the Queens Center for Art and Culture (later renamed 
the Queens Museum of Art, and now called the Queens Museum), which still 
houses and occasionally updates the Panorama. One other structure from 
the 1939-40 Fair remains in original location: the Willets Point elevated 
IRT station, built new for the Fair. It also served the 1964-65 events 
and continues to serve New York Mets games and U.S. Open Tennis. The 1939 
World's Fair made a strong impression on attendees and influenced a generation 
of Americans. Later generations have attempted to recapture the impression 
it made in fictional and artistic treatments. An archive of documents and 
films from the 1939 New York World's Fair is maintained at the New York 
Public Library (NYPL). This collection of official corporate records from 
the fair is one of the richest and most heavily used collections at NYPL.[44] 
Extensive highlights from the collection can be viewed online,[44] or via 
an award-winning free iPad app.[45] In October 2010, the National Building 
Museum in Washington, D.C. opened an exhibition titled Designing Tomorrow: 
America's World's Fairs of the 1930s.[46] This exhibition, which was available 
for view until September 2011, prominently featured the New York World's
