Colbert Michael "Cole" Hamels (born December 27, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He previously played for the Philadelphia Phillies from 2006 to 2015. Originally 
from San Diego, California, Hamels excelled in Rancho Bernardo High School 
both academically and athletically. The Phillies drafted him out of high 
school in the first round of the 2002 MLB Draft (17th), and he began his 
career in the Phillies minor league system. Numerous issues, including 
an injury sustained in a bar fight as well as other injuries, occurred 
during his first few minor league seasons. Having reached the Triple-A 
level, he was the top pitcher in the Phillies' minor league system in 2006. 
In May 2006, Hamels made his major league debut for the Phillies. After 
securing a long-term spot as a member of the Phillies starting rotation 
in his rookie season, he made large strides in the 2007 Major League Baseball 
season and won the Phillies' top major league pitcher award. He was the 
top pitcher on the team entering the 2008 season, and during the Phillies' 
postseason run, during which they ultimately won the 2008 World Series, 
he won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. Since then, he has 
been a top starter in the Phillies' rotation. After the 2008 season, Hamels 
signed a three-year contract with the Phillies. His statistics declined 
over the next two seasons, struggling through a tumultuous 2009 campaign 
and somewhat bouncing back in 2010, however still not approaching his 2008 
numbers. Over the next few seasons, Hamels was joined by fellow all-star 
pitchers including Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, and Roy Oswalt, and flourished 
with them, putting up some of his top career seasons before suffering from 
poor run support in 2013. With the decline of his aging teammates as the 
team missed the postseason for the next few years, Hamels remained one 
of the Phillies' consistent stars. Hamels was traded to the Texas Rangers 
in 2015 where he sparked their run to the AL West title. Cole Hamels attended 
Meadowbrook Middle School and Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego. 
He was a "gifted student", and scored a 1510 (out of 1600) on the SAT.[1] 
[2] Scouts were interested in Hamels while he was in high school primarily 
because his fastball was clocked as high as 94 miles per hour (151 km/h), 
and his secondary offerings were considered advanced.[3] However, some 
teams lost interest when Hamels broke his left humerus during his sophomore 
year.[4][5] Nonetheless, Hamels was drafted in the first round of the 2002 
Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, who held the 
17th overall selection.[6] Hamels began his professional baseball career 
in 2003, pitching for the Class A Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic 
League. Later that season, he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He finished the year by receiving 
the Paul Owens Award, given to the best pitcher in the Phillies' minor 
league system.[7] During the next two seasons, however, Hamels suffered 
through several injuries, and pitched only sparingly. He missed most of 
the 2004 season with elbow tendinitis, making only four starts. In 2005, 
he broke his pitching hand in a bar fight before the season began;[8] after 
rehabilitation, he was assigned to Clearwater. In July, the Phillies promoted 
him to the Class AA Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, where he surrendered 
the first home run of his professional career in his first start. Subsequently, 
he was shut down for the remainder of the season with back spasms.[9]:84 
In 2006, a healthy Hamels started again at Clearwater, and after a brief 
stint in Reading, he was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons 
of the Class AAA International League. In three games at Scranton, he struck 
out 36 batters while giving up only one walk and one run.[10] His minor 
league statistics included a record of 14–4 with a 1.43 ERA and 273 strikeouts 
in 35 games pitched.[11] For his performance, the Phillies promoted him 
to the major league club.[9]:84 Hamels was called up to the Philadelphia 
Phillies in May 2006.[10] In his Major League Baseball debut on May 12, 
he pitched five scoreless innings, allowed one hit, struck out seven batters 
and walked five while earning a no-decision against the Cincinnati Reds.[12] 
In his second career start, Hamels was dominant until the seventh inning, 
during which he was pulled after he allowed several baserunners, but again 
received a no-decision.[13] A shoulder injury scratched Hamels from the 
lineup of what would have originally been his third major league start. 
He was put on the 15-day disabled list[14] and returned on June 6 to defeat 
the Arizona Diamondbacks 10–1 for his first Major League victory. On August 
14, 2006, Hamels had his best start of his rookie season, shutting out 
the New York Mets over eight innings and striking out nine in the Phillies' 
13–0 victory.[15] He finished his rookie season with a 9–8 record, a 4.08 
earned run average (ERA), and 145 strikeouts (third among NL rookies) in 
132 1⁄3 innings (sixth among NL rookies).[9]:84 Hamels entered the 2007 
season having done significant work in the weight room in the offseason 
and at spring training.[16] His tenacity came to fruition when, on April 
21, 2007, Hamels pitched his first major league complete game, allowing 
one run on five hits and two walks while setting a career high with 15 
strikeouts.[17] Just three days before, the Phillies moved their opening 
day starter Brett Myers to the bullpen to be the closer, making Hamels 
the team's number one starter.[18] On May 16, he carried a perfect game 
into the seventh inning, but then walked leadoff hitter Rickie Weeks and 
surrendered a home run to the next batter, J. J. Hardy.[19] "Barring serious 
first-half slumps, he figures to go (to the All-Star game) every year until 
the mid-2010s." For his strong performance during the first half of the 
season, Hamels was, for the first time in his career, selected a member 
of the NL All Star Team.[21] As Hamels had been the Phillies only consistent 
starter to that point, even to the point that one columnist said the Phillies 
are a joke "as long as we are forced to look forward to someone other than 
Cole Hamels on the mound",[22] the Phillies acquired Kyle Lohse to supplement 
the rotation soon before the trading deadline.[23] Several weeks later, 
Hamels was placed on the 15-day disabled list (DL) with a mild left elbow 
strain. After the Phillies activated him from the DL, on September 28, 
he helped the Phillies take over first place in the National League East 
by striking out 13 Washington Nationals over 8 innings in a 6–0 win.[24] 
Two days later, the team clinched a spot in the playoffs for the first 
time in 14 years.[25] In the first game of the National League Division 
Series, he started for the Phillies, but surrendered three runs, three 
hits, and an "uncharacteristic" four walks, while striking out seven in 
6 2⁄3 innings; he was assessed the loss.[26] Ultimately, the Phillies lost 
the series. Hamels finished with a regular-season record of 15–5, a 3.39 
ERA, and 177 strikeouts in 183 1⁄3 innings. The Philadelphia chapter of 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America presented him the "Steve Carlton 
Most Valuable Pitcher" award.[27] Before the season began in March, Hamels 
made a complaint about the Phillies underpaying him, saying it was a "low 
blow" and he was "caught off-guard" with the gap between what he and his 
agent John Boggs felt was a fair reward for his performance in the previous 
season and what he was paid (the Phillies paid him US$500,000, barely above 
the minimum salary for MLB players despite Hamels' strong performance).[28][29] 
Though Hamels was the "clear-cut ace", Charlie Manuel penciled in Brett 
Myers as the Phillies' opening day starter because Myers accepted his role 
as closer the preceding season, putting the team ahead of his personal 
wishes to start. By the end of April, Hamels led the Phillies in most pitching 
categories, including wins (3), ERA (2.70), and innings pitched (43⅓). 
Continuing his dominance into May, Hamels recorded his first career complete 
game shutout against the Atlanta Braves on the 15th of that month.[30][31] 
By June, Myers had been demoted to the minor leagues due to his ineffectiveness, 
leaving Hamels alone atop the rotation. Hamels was snubbed from a selection 
to the All-Star Game despite strong numbers.[32] For the season, Hamels 
was 14–10 with a 3.09 ERA and 196 strikeouts in 227 1⁄3 innings; he had 
the lowest on-base percentage-against (OBP) in the majors at .272.[33] 
FanGraphs also rated his changeup as the most effective in the majors.[34] 
Hamels pitched in Game 1 of the National League Division Series against 
the Brewers, pitching "eight spectacular two-hit shutout innings" during 
which he struck out nine hitters, notching his first career playoff win, 
and the Phillies' first playoff win since 1993.[35]:49 He commented, "I 
knew the importance of the game. And it's something where, because of last 
year, I learned what it really takes in trying to ... kind of mellow out, 
not to have that sort of excitement where you can't really control everything."[35]:51 
He was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the National League Championship 
Series, going 2–0 in the NLCS with a 1.93 ERA and winning the series clincher 
on October 15 in Los Angeles. Hamels was selected the Phillies starter 
for Game 1 of the World Series; the Phillies won 3–2, and Hamels earned 
his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game 5, which was 
suspended due to rain after the top of the sixth inning tied at 2-2, and 
receiving a no-decision; when game five resumed the Phillies won 4-3 to 
clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 
2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA.[36] Hamels threw a total of 35 innings 
during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he never 
allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he did not 
hold opponents scoreless.[35]:217 Hamels was named the 2008 World Series 
MVP.[37] Subsequently, Jayson Stark wrote, The names on the list are the 
names who have carved their legends in the month of October ... We know 
their names because October was their kind of month, and they belong on 
that list because they once did something very few pitchers have ever done. 
They all won four starts in the same postseason. And now they have company 
... a 24-year-old left-hander named Cole Hamels. And with every time the 
Phillies handed him the baseball in October 2009, it became more apparent 
that he is one of the sports' most special talents. The Philadelphia chapter 
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America presented him the "Steve 
Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher" award for the second consecutive year.[38] 
Hamels started his 2009 season by signing a three-year, $20.5 million contract 
with the Phillies.[39] On February 14, the first day of spring training 
for pitchers and catchers, when asked who the Opening Day starter would 
be, manager Charlie Manuel responded, "Yeah, you might as well go ahead 
and pencil him in. I don't think there's any sense in me playing games. 
Go ahead, pencil him in."[40] However, Hamels left spring training on March 
16 after feeling tightness between innings, and flew to Philadelphia to 
have his left elbow examined by Dr. Michael Ciccotti. "This will obviously 
set me back a couple of days, and I don't think that should be a big deal", 
said Hamels.[41] Ciccotti found no structural damage in his arm,[42] yet 
Hamels still did not pitch on Opening Day as expected; Myers did for the 
third consecutive season.[43][44] For the first time in his career, he 
went winless in his first four starts, and left back-to-back starts early 
due to injury in late April, sustaining a left-shoulder contusion and an 
ankle sprain respectively. From June on, however, he returned to his previous 
form, recording two complete-game shutouts (tied for the NL-lead), striking 
out at least 10 batters in two separate games, and amassing a 21-inning 
scoreless streak from August 21 to September 6, while allowing just two 
home runs in his final eight starts.[9] In July, the Phillies augmented 
their starting rotation by acquiring two former Cy Young Award winners 
in Cliff Lee and Pedro Martínez from a trade and a free agent signing respectively.[45][46] 
Due to his early season injury struggles, Hamels posted a 10–11 record 
and a 4.32 ERA in the regular season, his first major league season in 
which he posted a sub-.500 record, and the worst ERA of his career to that 
point. Hamels started Game 2 of the 2009 National League Division Series 
against the Colorado Rockies, allowing four earned runs through five innings 
to take the loss. Nevertheless, the Phillies won the series, three games 
to one. He earned the win in Game 1 of the National League Championship 
Series as the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 8–6. Hamels started Game 3 of 
the World Series against the New York Yankees, pitching 4 1⁄3 innings, 
allowing 5 earned runs and taking the loss as the Yankees won that game 
8-5. Afterward, he told reporters, "I can't wait for it (the season) to 
end. It's been mentally draining. It's one of those things where, a year 
in, you just can’t wait for a fresh start."[47] Later in the series, after 
the Phillies won game five, a confrontational Brett Myers mockingly asked 
Hamels: "What are you doing here? I thought you quit."[48] The Phillies 
lost the World Series to the New York Yankees in six games.[49] Rob Neyer 
a sabermetrician and columnist for ESPN.com, contradicted anyone who asserted 
Hamels' skills had deteriorated, instead commenting, "Last October, everybody 
was ready to anoint Hamels some sort of superhero. This was largely because 
he went 4–0 during the Phillies' championship run, but also because he 
went 14–10 with a 3.09 ERA during the regular season. Last season, Hamels' 
strikeout-to-walk ratio was 3.7; this year it's 3.8. Last year, Hamels 
gave up 1.1 home runs per nine innings; this year he's given up 1.3 homers 
per nine. The only real difference between the 2008 Hamels and the 2009 
Hamels is luck." Phillies' pitching coach Rich Dubee and Hamels himself 
blamed Hamels' demeanor for some of his decline, noting, "He is such a 
perfectionist…his approach wasn’t very good last year. His success won’t 
come back until his demeanor changes" and "The more angry you get, it's 
that much tougher to execute your next pitch. I think I let [expectations] 
get to me" respectively.[51] Entering the 2010 season, the Phillies traded 
away Cliff Lee, but in doing so, acquired Roy Halladay in a "mega-trade".[52] 
They did not re-sign Myers,[53] and Halladay was named the Phillies' opening 
day starter.[54] Among Hamels' season highlights were a start on June 7 
against the San Diego Padres during which he threw 6 1⁄3 innings of no-hit 
baseball, winning five consecutive starts including three consecutive scoreless 
starts from late-August to mid-September, and striking out 13 batters, 
tied for his second-highest career total, on September 13 against the Florida 
Marlins.[9] The Phillies finished with the best record in MLB. Hamels started 
Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds 
and, for the first time in his postseason career, pitched a complete game 
shutout.[9] The Phillies advanced to the National League Championship Series 
facing the San Francisco Giants, where Hamels took the loss in Game 3 giving 
up three runs as the Giants' Matt Cain shutout the Phillies, en route to 
the Phillies' ultimate elimination in six games.[55] Statistically, Hamels 
rebounded from his previous season by posting a 12–11 record with a 3.06 
ERA, the latter of which was, at the time, a career-best. He also struck 
out a career high 211 batters. Throughout the season, he was plagued by 
a lack of run support; in 1⁄3 of his starts, the Phillies did not score 
a single run while he was in the game. Moreover, he received the fifth-lowest 
run support in the NL. Nevertheless, he allowed three or fewer earned runs 
in 26 of his 33 starts.[9] Jeff Nelson "facetiously" evaluated Hamels' 
season as follows: "Headcase. Immature. Soft. Unprepared. He wouldn’t pitch 
on three-days rest if asked. He's not a big game pitcher. He sounds like 
a whiny 7-year old – these were some of the descriptions I heard and read 
from many Phillies fans following Cole Hamels’ disappointing 2009 season. 
Heck, some people even wanted him traded after what he said during the 
’09 World Series. To the naked eye, Cole just wasn’t right two years ago. 
Fast forward a year later and Hamels all the sudden ‘found his game.’ He 
‘flicked a switch’ or ‘put his game face on.’ He was more prepared heading 
in to 2010 or he was cured from the Verducci effect." On December 15, 2010, 
Cliff Lee returned to the Phillies as he signed a free-agent contract with 
Philadelphia for five years and $120 million with a vesting option for 
a sixth year.[57] After this signing, the Phillies' starting rotation consisted 
of Roy Halladay, Roy Oswalt, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels, and Joe Blanton.[58] 
This rotation was considered one of the best in pitching history by many.[59][60][61] 
Halladay, Oswalt, Lee, and Hamels were dubbed the 'Phantastic Phour' by 
fans and the media.[60] Hamels entered the 2011 season with a large amount 
of excitement and hype from fans and the media.[62][63] By the All-Star 
game, Hamels was 4–3.[63] On July 3, when the rosters for the 2011 MLB 
All-Star Game in Phoenix, Arizona were broadcast on TBS, it was announced 
that Hamels was voted onto the National League team along with fellow pitchers 
and teammates Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Plácido Polanco, and Shane Victorino.[64][65] 
He was not eligible to play, however, because he had pitched the Sunday 
prior to the All-Star Game.[64] Hamels shared his dismay with this rule, 
saying, "It's one of those things where people who don't play the game 
make the rules."[66] The Phillies finished with the best record in MLB 
for the second year in a row. In the 2011 National League Division Series 
against the St. Louis Cardinals, Hamels started Game 3 which resulted in 
a 3-2 win to give the Phillies a 2-1 series lead, however the Phillies 
would lose Games 4 and 5 to be eliminated. Hamels finished the 2011 season 
with a record of 14–9, 194 strikeouts, an ERA of 2.79, and a 0.986 WHIP.[67] 
He finished fifth in the Cy Young Award voting behind Clayton Kershaw, 
Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, and Ian Kennedy, respectively.[68] During the 
2011 off-season, Hamels underwent elbow and hernia surgeries. Hamels had 
missed scheduled starts in August due to a stiff shoulder, and loose bodies 
were removed from his elbow to fix his problems. Hamels was ready to pitch 
by the start of Spring training 2012.[69] On January 17, Hamels and the 
Philadelphia Phillies agreed to a one-year, $15 million contract to avoid 
arbitration.[70] This was the highest salary ever paid to a pitcher eligible 
for arbitration before free agency.[70] On May 6, Hamels was suspended 
for five games after hitting Bryce Harper in his lower back with a pitch, 
after admitting that it was intentional.[71] On July 21, 2012, Hamels hit 
his first career home run off San Francisco Giants pitcher Matt Cain, who 
had homered off of him in the top half of the same inning, the first time 
in MLB that two pitchers had hit home runs off of each other in the same 
inning.[72] Hamels would stay a Phillie when he agreed to a contract extension 
on July 24.[73] The six-year, $144 million contract was the second-largest 
contract ever signed by a pitcher.[74][75] The deal included a vesting 
option for 2019 worth $24 million. If the option didn't vest, it would 
have turned into a club option for $20 million that included a $6 million 
buyout. Hamels finished the season with career highs in wins (17) and strikeouts 
(216),[67] and finished eighth in the NL Cy Young Award voting.[76] His 
3.05 ERA ranked second-best in his career (behind only his 2.79 ERA in 
2011).[67] The Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America presented him the "Steve Carlton Most Valuable Pitcher" award.[38] 
Before the 2013 season in spring training, manager Charlie Manuel named 
Hamels the 2013 opening day starter, which Matt Gelb of The Philadelphia 
Inquirer wrote was a "long time coming".[77] In his first career opening 
day start on April 1 against the Atlanta Braves, Hamels surrendered five 
earned runs in five innings and took the loss.[78] Particularly early in 
the season, Hamels was plagued by a lack of run support; as of May 27, 
he had the fifth-lowest in the major leagues.[79] He lost his eighth start 
on May 27, declining to a record of 1–8, which one Sports Illustrated column 
attributed more to the Phillies poor offense than Hamels.[80] Nevertheless, 
it was "easily ... Hamels’ worst performance of his eight-year career".[79] 
Aside from offensive struggles while Hamels was pitching, the Phillies 
defense struggled, though Hamels kept a positive attitude, once commenting 
that his luck should improve, as "I've been doing pretty well on the plane 
in poker."[81] Towards the end of the season, however, Hamels "put it together"; 
in his final 11 starts. he surrendered more than three runs only once.[82] 
In total, he amassed an 8–14 record with a 3.60 ERA in 220 innings and 
202 strikeouts (sixth in NL).[83] Despite struggles from his teammates, 
Bill Baer noted that Hamels, "... was worse at generating swings and misses. 
His strikeout rate declined by 2.6 percent and his overall swinging strike 
rate declined by 2.1 percent. That doesn’t seem like a whole lot, but consider 
that opposing hitters swung at 1,774 pitches during the 2013 season. A 
2.1 percent decrease means 37 fewer swings and misses. That's a combination 
of 37 more balls in play or foul balls prolonging an at-bat." Despite Hamels' 
poor record and ERA, 25 of his 33 starts were quality starts, and thus 
he gave his team a chance to win 25 times, yet only got eight wins.[84] 
Before the 2014 season, Hamels announced that he would not be ready to 
pitch on Opening Day because of tendonitis in his biceps.[85] On April 
6 Hamels pitched in a Minor League Class A-Advanced game, striking out 
four while allowing two earned runs on three hits in four innings.[86][87] 
He made his first start of the season on April 23.[88] Despite lack of 
run support contributing to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the 
best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young 
candidate.[89] On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies 
combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a 
pinch hitter in the top of the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, 
and 108 pitches through six innings.[90] Overall, Hamels was the only consistent 
star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently 
mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' 
lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading 
deadline.[91][92] At the start of the 2015 season, there was much focus 
and speculation regarding trade possibilities surrounding Hamels.[93][94] 
The Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Texas Rangers, Chicago Cubs, New 
York Yankees, and San Francisco Giants expressed interest in trading for 
him during the 2015 season.[95][96][97] On July 25, 2015, in what would 
be his final start for the Phillies before being traded, Hamels no-hit 
the Chicago Cubs 5–0 at Wrigley Field, striking out 13 and only giving 
up two walks, both to Dexter Fowler and besting the Cubs' Jake Arrieta—himself 
a no-hit pitcher a month later, on August 30 of that season.[98] It was 
the first no-hitter against the Cubs since Sandy Koufax's perfect game 
in 1965, and first at Wrigley since the Cubs' Milt Pappas in 1972.[99] 
Hamels also joined Vida Blue, Mike Witt, Kent Mercker and Kevin Millwood 
as no-hit pitchers who also pitched in a combined no-hitter. On July 31, 
2015, Hamels was traded to the Texas Rangers along with Jake Diekman in 
exchange for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, 
Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff.[100][101] Hamels became the first pitcher 
to be traded during a regular season after pitching a no-hitter in his 
final start with the team that traded him. Bert Blyleven had been the last 
pitcher to pitch a no-hitter in his final start with the team that traded 
him; after pitching a no-hitter for the Rangers in his final start of the 
1977 season, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates that offseason. With 
the Rangers, Hamels went 7-1 in 12 starts with a 3.66 ERA. The Rangers 
were under .500 as late as August 3 but posted a winning record for the 
remainder of the 2015 season and eventually overtook the Houston Astros 
in September for the American League West division lead. The Rangers clinched 
the AL West title on the final day of the season, as Hamels threw a complete-game 
three-hitter in a 9-2 win over the Los Angeles Angels, the team's 6th division 
title and 7th postseason appearance in franchise history. Hamels' positive 
effect on the Rangers was compared to that of the Toronto Blue Jays' David 
Price, another ace starting pitcher who helped spearhead a run to the postseason 
after blending in seamlessly with a struggling team who acquired him at 
the trade deadline.[102] The Rangers lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in five 
games in the Division Series after squandering a 2-0 series lead. Hamels 
received a no-decision in Game 2 as he left the game tied, but the Rangers 
won in 14 innings. Hamels started Game 5, and was pulled in the bottom 
of the 7th inning while the Rangers were leading 3-2; the Jays subsequently 
scored 4 runs to win 6-3, and Hamels was charged with the loss as he was 
responsible for the runners on base.[citation needed] Starting in 2016, 
the Texas Rangers have a special cheering section known as Hamels Heroes, 
whenever Hamels starts at Globe Life Park. It was inspired by the success 
of the Seattle Mariners' "King's Court" for Felix Hernandez. Hamels was 
named the Opening Day starter for the Rangers in 2016.[103] On Opening 
Day, after allowing two home runs in two innings, Hamels calmed down to 
pitch 7 strong innings, while only allowing two runs on 4 hits and 8 strikeouts 
for a 2016 Opening Day win against the Seattle Mariners.[104] On June 12, 
in a start against Seattle, Hamels recorded his 2,000th career strikeout, 
becoming the 77th player, and 7th active player, to reach the milestone.[105] 
On September 28, at home against the Milwaukee Brewers, Hamels claimed 
his 200th strike out of the season. Hamels is known throughout baseball 
for possessing one of the better changeups in the game. In 2012, Fangraphs 
ranked Hamels as having the fourth best changeup in the game trailing only 
Jason Vargas, Tommy Milone, and Félix Hernández.[106] The Hardball Times 
called his changeup a "killer" pitch to right-handed hitters, noting that 
while it is also effective against left-handed hitters, when they put it 
in play, they generally have success.[107] Rangers pitching coach Mike 
Maddux said of Hamels, "It's a difficult task to try to get young guys 
to throw changeups, because their whole amateur career is spent staring 
at the scout with the gun. For a young guy to have a good changeup, that's 
an aptitude right there. It's pitchability."[108] The development of Hamels' 
changeup is attributed by his high school pitching coach, Mark Furtak, 
to the fact that in high school he broke his arm. He could no longer work 
on his curveball for several months, and was forced to focus on the changeup.[109][110] 
Chipper Jones, who was a star-third baseman for the rival Atlanta Braves 
commented that Hamels is the "best lefthander in the National League ... 
you have to respect his fastball, and his change-up is devastating. If 
you're guessing fastball and you get change-up, you're way out in front 
of it. His change-up is a soft sinker that just falls down."[110] Aside 
from the changeup, he throws a four-seam fastball in the low 90s (can reach 
94 to 96 miles per hour (151 to 154 km/h)), a cutter 87 to 89 miles per 
hour (140 to 143 km/h), and an "inconsistent" curveball that sometimes 
loops and other times is sharp, and hovers in the mid-70s (around 73 to 
77 miles per hour (117 to 124 km/h)).[111] Prior to the conception and 
advent of his cutter, he briefly threw a two-seam fastball around 2008 
and 2009, before debuting his cutter in 2010.[107][111] Once he attained 
a "feel" for how to effectively utilize his cutter, it helped him increase 
his groundball rate (percentage of balls in play that were groundballs), 
including to over 50-percent in 2011.[112] Hamels, who is of Dutch descent,[113]
