Johnson City is a city in Washington, Carter, and Sullivan counties in 
the U.S. state of Tennessee, with most of the city being in Washington 
County. As of the 2010 census, the population of Johnson City was 63,152,[6] 
and by 2015 the estimated population was 66,027, making it the ninth-largest 
city in the state.[1] Johnson City is ranked the #14 "Best Small Place 
for Business and Careers" in the USA by Forbes,[7] and #5 in Kiplinger's 
list of "The 10 Least-Expensive Cities For Living in the U.S.A." stating 
the low cost of living is attributed to affordable homes and below-average 
utility, transportation and health-care costs.[8] Johnson City is the principal 
city of the Johnson City Metropolitan Statistical Area, which covers Carter, 
Unicoi, and Washington counties[9] and had a combined population of 200,966[10] 
as of 2013. The MSA is also a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, 
TN-VA Combined Statistical Area – commonly known as the "Tri-Cities" region. 
This CSA is the fifth largest in Tennessee with an estimated 500,538 people 
in residence.[11] William Bean, traditionally recognized as Tennessee's 
first settler, built his cabin along Boone's Creek near Johnson City in 
1769.[12] In the 1780s, Colonel John Tipton (1730–1813) established a farm 
(now the Tipton-Haynes State Historic Site) just outside what is now Johnson 
City. During the State of Franklin movement, Tipton was a leader of the 
loyalist faction, residents of the region who wanted to remain part of 
North Carolina rather than form a separate state. In February 1788, an 
armed engagement took place at Tipton's farm between Tipton and his men 
and the forces led by John Sevier, the leader of the Franklin faction.[13] 
Founded in 1856 by Henry Johnson as a railroad station called "Johnson's 
Depot", Johnson City became a major rail hub for the Southeast, as three 
railway lines crossed in the downtown area.[14] In the late 19th and early 
20th centuries, Johnson City served as headquarters for the narrow gauge 
East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (the ET&WNC, nicknamed 
"Tweetsie") and the standard gauge Clinchfield Railroad. Both rail systems 
featured excursion trips through scenic portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains 
and were engineering marvels of railway construction. The Southern Railway 
(now Norfolk Southern) also passes through the city. During the American 
Civil War, before it was formally incorporated in 1869, the name of the 
town was briefly changed to "Haynesville" in honor of Confederate Senator 
Landon Carter Haynes.[15] Henry Johnson's name was quickly restored following 
the war, with Johnson elected as the city's first mayor on January 3, 1870. 
The town grew rapidly from 1870 until 1890 as railroad and mining interests 
flourished. However, the national depression of 1893, which caused many 
railway failures (including the Charleston, Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad 
or "3-Cs", a predecessor of the Clinchfield) and a resulting financial 
panic, halted Johnson City's boom town momentum.[16] In 1901, the Mountain 
Branch of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers (now the U.S. 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center and National Cemetery), Mountain Home, 
Tennessee[17][18] was created by an act of Congress introduced by Walter 
P. Brownlow. Construction on this 450-acre (1.8 km2) campus, designed to 
serve disabled Civil War veterans, was completed in 1903 at a cost of $3 
million. Prior to completion of the facility, the assessed value of the 
entire town was listed at $750,000. The East Tennessee State Normal School 
was authorized in 1911 and the new college campus located directly across 
from the National Soldiers Home. Johnson City began rapidly growing and 
became the fifth-largest city in Tennessee by 1930.[19] Together with neighboring 
Bristol, Johnson City was noted as a hotbed for old-time music; it hosted 
noteworthy Columbia Records recording sessions in 1928 known as the Johnson 
City Sessions. Native son "Fiddlin' Charlie" Bowman became a national recording 
star via these sessions.[20] The Fountain Square area in downtown featured 
a host of local and traveling street entertainers including Blind Lemon 
Jefferson. During the 1920s and the Prohibition era, Johnson City's ties 
to the bootlegging activity of the Appalachian Mountains earned the city 
the nickname of "Little Chicago".[21] Stories persist that the town was 
one of several distribution centers for Chicago gang boss Al Capone during 
Prohibition. Capone had a well-organized distribution network within the 
southern United States for alcohol smuggling; it shipped his products from 
the mountain distillers to northern cities. Capone was, according to local 
lore, a part-time resident of Montrose Court, a luxury apartment complex 
now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city is featured 
in a song and video by Travis Tritt called "Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde", 
although the line "rollin' north on 95" is fictionalized, as Interstate 
81 and Interstate 26 intersect near Johnson City. The city is mentioned 
in a song by Old Crow Medicine Show called "Wagon Wheel", in the lyric 
"Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke, I caught a trucker out of Philly 
had a nice long toke. But he's heading west from the Cumberland Gap, to 
Johnson City, Tennessee."[22] Johnson City is approximately 100 miles east 
of Cumberland Gap. For many years, the city had a municipal "privilege 
tax" on carnival shows, in an attempt to dissuade traveling circuses and 
other transient entertainment businesses from doing business in town.[23] 
The use of drums by merchants to draw attention to their goods is prohibited. 
Title Six, Section 106 of the city's municipal code, the so-called "Barney 
Fife" ordinance, empowers the city's police force to draft into involuntary 
service as many of the town's citizens as necessary to aid police in making 
arrests and in preventing or quelling any riot, unlawful assembly or breach 
of peace.[24] Johnson City is run by a five-person commission. The commissioners 
are as follows:[25] M. Denis "Pete" Peterson is the current city manager.[26] 
The city is served by the Johnson City Police Department. Johnson City 
is located in northeastern Washington County at 36°20′N 82°22′W﻿ / ﻿36.333°N 
82.367°W﻿ / 36.333; -82.367 (36.3354, -82.3728),[27] with smaller parts 
extending north into Sullivan County and east into Carter County. Johnson 
City shares a contiguous southeastern border with Elizabethton. Johnson 
City also shares a small contiguous border with Kingsport to the far north 
along I-26 and a slightly longer one with Bluff City to the northeast along

area of 43.3 square miles (112.1 km2), of which 42.9 square miles (111.2 km2) 
is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8 km2), or 0.75%, is water.[6] The steep 
mountains, rolling hills and valleys surrounding the region are part of 
the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley Province, and Johnson City is just west 
of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Roan Mountain, with an elevation of over 6,000 
feet (1,800 m), is approximately 20 miles (32 km) to the southeast of the 
city. Buffalo Mountain, a ridge over 2,700 feet (820 m) high, is the location 
of a city park on the south side of town. The Watauga River arm of Boone 
Lake, a TVA reservoir, is partly within the city limits. The Nolichucky 
River flows 12 miles (19 km) to the south of Johnson City. Whitewater rafting 
and kayaking opportunities exist 20 miles (32 km) south of Johnson City 
where that river flows from the North Carolina state line near Erwin. As

and affordable housing, it is ranked #8 "Best Place for African Americans 
to Retire" by Black Enterprise magazine.[36] Kiplinger ranked Johnson City 
#5 in "The 10 Least-Expensive Cities For Living in the U.S.A.", stating 
the low cost of living is attributed to affordable homes and below-average
