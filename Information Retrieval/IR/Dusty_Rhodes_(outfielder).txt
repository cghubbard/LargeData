James Lamar "Dusty" Rhodes (May 13, 1927 â€“ June 17, 2009)[1] was an outfielder 
with a 7-year career who played from 1952 to 1957 and in 1959. He played

In the first game of the 1954 World Series, Rhodes had a pinch hit home 
run in the bottom of the tenth inning off Bob Lemon to win the game.[2]

remained in the game to play left field. In the seventh inning he hit a 
homer off Early Wynn to help ensure the victory.[3] Roy Campanella, the 
Brooklyn Dodger catcher, said of Durocher and his action of pinch-hitting 
Rhodes: "If they have to pinch hit Rhodes for Irvin, they must be hurting." 
Willie Mays mocked this assumption in his autobiography. Mays considered 
Rhodes to be a "fabulous hitter", as did Durocher, who wrote in his autobiography,

abilities.[4] After his baseball career, Rhodes worked for a friend on 
a tugboat for 25 years, a job which he said he loved. When asked why his 
career was so short, Rhodes said, "After Durocher left the Giants, baseball
