The WBSC Premier12 (also "Premier 12") is the flagship international baseball 
tournament organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), 
featuring the twelve best-ranked national baseball teams in the world. 
The first tournament was held in Taiwan and Japan in November 2015. From 
1938 to 2011, the International Baseball Federation (IBAF), then the governing 
body of baseball, considered the Baseball World Cup to be the sport's major 
world championship.[1] Following the 2011 version of the event, the IBAF 
chose to discontinue the tournament in favor of the World Baseball Classic.[2] 
In 2005 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that baseball 
and softball would be removed from the Summer Olympics beginning in 2012.[3] 
Thereafter, the IOC also officially reclassified baseball and softball 
as two different disciplines of the same sport.[4] In 2013, the IBAF merged 
with the International Softball Federation to create the World Baseball 
Softball Confederation (WBSC).[5] On 27 November 2014, the WBSC announced 
the creation of the Premier12 tournament, calling it "the new flagship 
pro baseball world championship," which would be held every four years.[6][7] 
It was viewed as a spiritual successor to the Baseball World Cup and an 
attempt to boost baseball's bid for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics 
in Tokyo.[8][9] The WBSC proposed that, if baseball does return to the 
Olympics for 2020, that the 2019 WBSC Premier12 be used as a qualifying 
tournament.[10] The field of the tournament consists of the twelve best 
national teams in the world according to the most recent WBSC World Rankings.[6] 
The following twelve national teams has been chosen to participate in the 
inaugural 2015 WBSC Premier12, based on the rankings released on 22 November
