George M. Brophy (September 15, 1926 â€“ November 20, 1998) was an American 
professional baseball executive who served as farm system director for 
the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball for over 15 seasons.[1] A 
former sportswriter, Brophy was serving the general manager of the Class 
AAA Minneapolis Millers of the American Association when the club folded 
after the 1960 season due to the relocation of the then-Washington Senators 
to the Twin Cities as the Minnesota Twins. Brophy then joined the Twins 
as assistant director of farm clubs. After the death of Sherry Robertson, 
his boss, in 1970, Brophy was named to succeed him as Twins' vice president 
and farm director. Brophy stayed in this position until 1985, when he retired 
due to health problems and was succeeded by longtime deputy Jim Rantz.[2][3] 
Following his retirement, Brophy served as a special assignment scout for 
the Houston Astros until 1996. Brophy died in Edina, Minnesota, on November 
20, 1998, at the age of 72 from complications stemming from aplastic anemia.[2] 
In 1984, he was named the Topps' Long Meritorious Service Award winner.[2]
