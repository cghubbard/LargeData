The New York Cosmos (simply the Cosmos in 1977–1978) were an American professional 
soccer club based in New York City and its suburbs. The team played home 
games in three stadiums around New York before moving in 1977 to Giants 
Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey, where it remained for the rest of 
its history. Founded in 1970, the team competed in the North American Soccer 
League (NASL) until 1984 and was the strongest franchise in that league, 
both competitively and financially – based largely around its backing by 
Warner Communications President Steve Ross, which enabled it to sign internationally 
famous stars such as the Brazilian forward Pelé, Italian striker Giorgio 
Chinaglia and the West German sweeper Franz Beckenbauer. The acquisition 
of these foreign players, particularly Pelé, made the Cosmos into what 
Gavin Newsham called "the most glamorous team in world football", and contributed 
to the development of soccer across the United States, a country where 
it had previously been largely ignored. As the Cosmos declined following 
Pelé's retirement, so did the NASL. Attendances fell, the league's television 
deal was lost, and it finally folded in 1985 after playing its last season 
in 1984. The Cosmos attempted to continue operations in the Major Indoor 
Soccer League, but attendances were so low that the club withdrew without 
completing a season. The team attempted an independent schedule in 1985, 
but also cancelled that because of low attendance. The Cosmos folded, though 
the team's youth camps continued to operate under the Cosmos name and label, 
run by the franchise's former general manager, G. Peppe Pinton. The Cosmos 
name remained very well known, even after it stopped competing. Numerous 
attempts were made to revive it during the 1990s and 2000s, most notably 
as a Major League Soccer (MLS) club. Seeking to retain the Cosmos' heritage, 
Pinton refused to sell the name and image rights, believing that MLS would 
not honor them. Following a change of attitude by MLS towards the NASL's 
legacy and the revival of several former NASL names, Pinton sold the rights 
to an international, English-based consortium in August 2009. A new Cosmos 
team was announced in August 2010 by the group's honorary president, Pelé. 
The new team started play in the second-tier North American Soccer League 
(which held its first season in 2011) during the fall 2013 season. The 
club was founded in 1970 by Warner Communications executives Ahmet and 
Nesuhi Ertegun and company president Steve Ross. The team's first recruit 
was the Englishman Clive Toye, a former sports writer who had moved to 
the United States in 1967 to become general manager of the short-lived 
Baltimore Bays; he was given the same post in New York. Toye sought to 
convey the new team's ambitions within its name, and reasoned that he could 
outdo the "Metropolitans" label referenced by the then-nine-year-old New 
York Mets baseball team by calling his team the "Cosmos", shortened from 
"Cosmopolitans". However, the Erteguns wished to use the name originally 
suggested by Nesuhi, the "New York Blues". To ensure that his own chosen 
name was adopted, Toye staged a "name the team" contest, inviting supporters 
to write in with potential names. Two NYC teachers, Meyer Diller and Al 
Capelli, from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens, entered the contest 
and submitted the name "Cosmos". The two physical education teachers had 
independently come up with the name "Cosmos", having used the templates 
of the "Mets" shortened from Metropolitan, and the "Knicks", shortened 
from Knickerbockers. The two men were awarded a trip to Europe.[3] The 
name was officially unveiled, February 4, 1971.[2][4][5] The New York Cosmos 
entered the 1968-founded North American Soccer League (NASL) in 1970 and 
made their field debut in the league's fourth season in 1971. The first 
roster signing of the club was Gordon Bradley, an English professional 
who had moved to North America in 1963 and played for the New York Generals 
in 1968.[6] He was made player-coach, a position he would hold until 1975.[6] 
Bradley's team finished second in its division in its first year, playing 
at Yankee Stadium, home of the New York Yankees baseball team. Randy Horton, 
from Bermuda, was named the league's Rookie of the Year after scoring 16 
goals and 37 points, the most by any New York player.[7][8] In 1972 the 
team moved to Hofstra Stadium where they won their first league title with 
a 2–1 victory over the St. Louis Stars. Horton was the league's top scorer 
and Most Valuable Player, with 9 goals and 22 points from the 14 regular-season 
games and two post-season matches.[7] The Cosmos reached the play-offs 
once more in 1973, but were knocked out at the semi-final stage.[9] Bradley 
coached the United States national team for six games during 1973—picking 
himself in one, despite not being an American citizen—but lost them all.[6][10][11] 
Before the 1974 season, the Cosmos moved again, settling at Downing Stadium. 
In their first year at their new base, they finished bottom of their division.[9] 
Horton top scored for the Cosmos in every season before he was traded in 
1975 to the Washington Diplomats.[7] It was during the 1975 season that 
the Cosmos acquired the Brazilian star Pelé, whom they had been attempting 
to sign since the team was created.[12] Ross had apparently not heard of 
him before getting involved in soccer, but agreed to finance the transfer 
when Toye compared the Brazilian's popularity to that of the Pope. Pelé 
joined the Cosmos on June 10, 1975 on a salary of $1.4 million per year, 
an enormous wage for an athlete at that time. A number of contracts—only 
one of which mentioned soccer—were set up for Pelé to ensure that he paid 
the lowest amount of tax possible, including one as a "recording artist" 
with Warner subsidiary Atlantic Records. "We owned him lock, stock and 
barrel," Toye retrospectively boasted. They also signed Mike Dillon in 
1975.[13] The Pelé deal was later described by Gavin Newsham, an English 
writer, as "the transfer coup of the century".[14] His arrival turned the 
Cosmos from a motley crew of foreigners, semi-professionals and students 
into a huge commercial presence. The club's groundsman, on hearing that 
the Brazilian's début for New York was to be broadcast on CBS, spray-painted 
the pitch green to disguise how little grass was on it: the match, against 
the Dallas Tornado, was broadcast to 22 countries and covered by more than 
300 journalists from all over the world.[13][14] Although New York finished 
third at season end, it was still too low a placing to reach the post-season.[9] 
Bradley was replaced for the 1976 season by another Englishman, Ken Furphy, 
who paired Pelé up front with Italian international forward Giorgio Chinaglia, 
a new arrival from S.S. Lazio. He had been so popular at Lazio that when 
his move to New York was announced, supporters "threatened to throw themselves 
beneath the wheels of the plane".[13] By contrast to most of the overseas 
stars bought by NASL teams, Chinaglia was signed in his prime.[13] He played 
for the Cosmos for the rest of their history, scoring a record number of 
goals and points not only for the Cosmos, but for the entire league.[9] 
He shared an unusual personal bond with the club's ultimate controller, 
Ross, and was therefore treated differently from the other players, including 
Pelé.[13] Crowds rose with the arrival of these and other European and 
South American international players,[9] resulting in a move back to Yankee 
Stadium for the 1976 season. With numerous foreign stars arriving at the 
Cosmos, the team's competitive performance improved, as New York reached 
the play-offs at the end of the season, but lost in the divisional championship 
match to the Tampa Bay Rowdies.[9] The Cosmos relocated again before the 
1977 season, to the newly constructed Giants Stadium in New Jersey, and 
at the same time dropped the prefix "New York" and played simply as "the 
Cosmos", without a geographical name. The city name was restored in 1979.[9][15] 
Bradley returned as coach for the 1977 season in place of the dismissed 
Furphy, but was removed after half of the season to become the club's vice-president 
of player personnel.[6] South African-born former Italy international Eddie 
Firmani took his place.[6] Pelé played his last professional match on October 
1, 1977, in front of a capacity crowd at Giants Stadium:[13] in an exhibition 
match between New York and his former club Santos, Pelé appeared for both 
sides, playing one half for each. The Cosmos won the game 2–1.[13] Pelé's 
compatriot, former Brazil captain Carlos Alberto was signed in 1977, at 
the same time as Franz Beckenbauer, who had captained the 1974 FIFA World 
Cup-winning West German national team. On the field, New York won three 
out of four championships, in 1977, 1978 and 1980. A playoff game against 
the Fort Lauderdale Strikers in 1977 drew a crowd of 77,691, a record for 
American club soccer.[13] The team's average attendances, regularly over 
40,000 during the late 1970s, were the biggest in the league;[9] this helped 
it to become regarded as the league's "marquee club", both commercially 
and competitively.[6] Firmani was fired in 1979; he claimed, after falling 
out with Chinaglia.[16] His assistant, Ray Klivecka, replaced him, becoming 
the team's first American-born coach. He lasted a season before himself 
being replaced by Júlio Mazzei.[17] After the retirement of Pelé in 1977, 
much of the progress that American soccer had made during his stay was 
lost; there was no star at the same level to replace him as the NASL's 
headline act.[14] After enduring briefly during the late 1970s, attendances 
dropped after 1980. The sport's popularity fell and the media lost interest.[14] 
The deal with broadcaster ABC to broadcast NASL matches was also lost in 
1980, and the 1981 Soccer Bowl was only shown on tape delay.[18] All of 
the franchises quickly became unprofitable, and a salary cap enforced before 
the 1984 season only delayed the inevitable.[18] The league folded at the 
end of 1984, following the loss of most of its franchises.[9][18][19] The 
Cosmos had financial problems of their own, on top of those affecting the 
league in general. Much of the Cosmos' ability to attract the well-known 
overseas players it had acquired was due to the financial resources of 
parent company Warner Communications. In the early 1980s, Warner was the 
target of a hostile takeover bid by Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch; 
although this attempt did not succeed, Warner sold off several of its assets, 
among them Atari and Global Soccer, Inc., the subsidiary that operated 
the Cosmos. Chinaglia bought Global Soccer, and thus controlled the team. 
His group did not have the capital necessary to keep all of the players 
signed on expensive contracts by Warner, which resulted in many of the 
stars being sold. The club won its last title in 1982, and by the last 
season of the NASL, 1984, had missed the play-offs for the first time since 
1975.[9] The precipitous decline of the Cosmos after the 1983 season became 
for many fans and the media proof positive of the grave condition of the 
whole NASL.[9][19] Following the collapse of the NASL, the team competed 
in the Major Indoor Soccer League during the 1984–85 season, with Klivecka 
briefly returning as coach,[20] but withdrew after 33 games due to low 
attendances. Although the organization did not field a team following that 
season except for an aborted independent schedule in 1985 the Cosmos' youth 
soccer camps, which the team had started in 1977, remained in operation.[21] 
The camps were run by former Cosmos general manager G. Peppe Pinton, who 
retained ownership of the Cosmos name, logo and records. Pinton continued 
the youth programs at Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey. Summer camps 
program existed since 1978 after one year Pele's retirement.Than Pinton 
took over with the COSMOS camps and became team's soccer coach from 1989 
to 2003, replacing Ken Medaska and Peter Valente.[22][23] The Pelé and 
Giorgio Chinaglia soccer camps were located at Manhattanville College in 
Purchase, New York. Since the original New York Cosmos club stopped competing 
in 1985, there have been frequent attempts to revive it. With the rise 
of Major League Soccer (MLS), various New York area entities—including 
past and present owners of the New York Red Bulls—lobbied Pinton for the 
acquisition of the Cosmos name.[24] Pinton refused to allow an MLS team 
to use it, believing that the league would not acknowledge the Cosmos' 
legacy.[25][26] However, when old NASL names such as the San Jose Earthquakes, 
Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps were revived 
as MLS franchises, he reconsidered. He sold the Cosmos name and brand to 
English businessman Paul Kemsley in 2009,[27] whose group, fronted by Pelé 
and including many well-known soccer figures,[28] announced a new team 
with the Cosmos' name in August 2010.[29] The new Cosmos initially attempted 
to become an MLS expansion franchise,[30] but in 2012 joined the new second-tier 
incarnation of the North American Soccer League, which began play in Autumn 
of 2013.[31][32] Sometimes, in the dressing room, I think I am in Hollywood. 
When Pelé arrived at the Cosmos in 1975, American soccer was, in Newsham's 
phrase, "dying a slow, painful and largely unnoticed death".[14] The sport 
was not taken seriously by the bulk of the American media, and was of little 
interest to the public. Matches were often played in front of almost-empty 
stands, receiving modest press coverage.[14] The signing of Pelé by the 
Cosmos transformed soccer across the country almost immediately, lending 
credibility not only to the Cosmos, but also to the NASL and soccer in 
general. Within days of the Brazilian's arrival, the increased media attention 
had caused the Cosmos' office staff to increase from five people to more 
than 50. Soccer became seen as a viable alternative to more traditional 
"American" sports such as basketball, baseball and American football. The 
Cosmos, in particular, became an internationally famous club – "the most 
glamorous team in world football", in Newsham's words, or "soccer demigods" 
in those of ESPN writer David Hirshey.[14] We were as big as the Yankees 
and bigger than the Giants. We had our own tables at all the clubs. But 
we weren't any more decadent than players today. The Cosmos, as the flagship 
team of the NASL, embodied what Hirshey labelled the "nexus of soccer and 
showbiz", and became Warner Communications' most culturally visible asset.[13][14] 
After Pelé signed for New York, many other European and South American 
stars joined NASL teams; the Los Angeles Aztecs, for example, signed George 
Best and Johan Cruyff in 1976 and 1979 respectively. Cosmos road trips, 
described by traveling secretary Steve Marshall as "like traveling with 
the Rolling Stones",[14] saw the team pack out each stadium it visited,[13][14] 
while at home, the team attracted numerous high-profile supporters.[13][14] 
While soccer had previously been largely ignored by the American press, 
the Cosmos and other NASL teams now became regular fixtures on the back 
pages.[14] However, just as Pelé had kick-started the development of soccer 
in the US, his retirement in 1977 would mark the start of a decline.[14] 
With nobody of the same stature to personify the sport, the popularity 
that had been built up nosedived just as quickly as it had appeared.[14] 
The league's television deal with ABC was lost at the end of 1980 and a 
salary cap, enforced before the 1984 season,[18] caused many of the remaining 
overseas stars—lured to America by fat pay packets—to return to the European 
and South American leagues.[14] The NASL collapsed abruptly in late 1984, 
and was not replaced by a new professional soccer league until Major League 
Soccer's first season in 1996.[13] A feature-length documentary about the 
Cosmos, called Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York 
Cosmos, was released in theaters in 2006. The film, narrated by Matt Dillon, 
featured interviews with many of the players and personalities involved 
with the team.[13][33][34] After the team name was founded in 1970, Cosmos 
general manager Clive Toye chose the green and yellow of the Brazil national 
team as playing colors as part of his strategy to lure Pelé, one of that 
country's star players, to the United States.[12][35] The club's initial 
uniform was all green with yellow trim, with the colors reversed on the 
road uniform. Coincidentally, the colors were the same as those of the 
previous New York NASL team, the New York Generals, which had folded after 
the 1968 season.[9] When Pelé did come on board in 1975, the uniform was 
changed to all-white in imitation of his club in Brazil, Santos. The green 
and yellow elements were relegated to the trim. The green shirt was concurrently 
matched with white shorts to become the new away uniform.[36] Uniforms 
designed by Ralph Lauren were used from 1979 to the end; the home uniform 
remained all-white, though with navy and yellow trim replacing the green 
and white trim of the previous outfit. The away uniform became navy shirts 
and shorts with yellow trim, paired with unusual yellow-and-navy hooped 
socks, which were later replaced with plain navy blue ones.[30] The artist 
commissioned by Toye to design the team's logo was Wayland Moore, a sports 
artist from Atlanta who had already worked on the logo, uniform and program 
covers of that city's soccer team, the Chiefs. Moore attempted to create 
a design that was simple, recognisable and inclusive of New York's many 
nationalities. The three colored "blades" surrounding the soccer ball in 
the center represented its movement, while the font originally used was 
chosen simply because it was easily legible on the uniform.[12][37] The 
text on the logo was shortened to "Cosmos" in 1977, concurrently with the 
team's dropping of the "New York" label. The city name was restored two 
years later, but the badge remained unchanged. The Cosmos' first home stadium 
was Yankee Stadium, home to the New York Yankees baseball team, where they 
played throughout the 1971 season. Attendances during the club's first 
year averaged at 4,517, less than 7% of the stadium's capacity, which was 
at that time 65,010. The Cosmos therefore moved before the 1972 season 
to the 15,000-seater Hofstra Stadium, on the campus of the namesake university 
25 miles (40 km) east of metropolitan New York. After two seasons of continuing 
low crowds at this out-of-town location, the Cosmos moved again, relocating 
to the 22,500-capacity Downing Stadium before the 1974 season. It was at 
Downing Stadium that attendances started to rise significantly, buoyed 
by the arrival of stars such as Pelé, who arrived in 1975. For the Brazilian's 
first match, the stadium was full; "there must have been another 50,000 
turned away", coach Gordon Bradley later claimed.[14] These larger attendances 
necessitated another move, which occurred in 1976, when the Cosmos returned 
to Yankee Stadium. This time the team averaged 18,227 fans over the course 
of the season, over four times the average 1971 gate. The team then moved 
yet again before the 1977 season, to the newly built Giants Stadium, where 
attendances skyrocketed; crowds peaked at an average of 47,856 during 1978. 
The Cosmos remained at Giants Stadium for the rest of their time in the 
NASL. Attendances gradually fell as the league declined during the early 
1980s, then finally slumped in 1984, when they dropped by more than half 
from the 1983 seasonal average.[9] The largest crowd to attend a Cosmos 
home game was set in 1977, when the Fort Lauderdale Strikers visited for 
a playoff match. The game was attended by 77,691 fans,[13] which, at the 
time, was a record for American soccer.[38] The lowest average attendance 
for a season was 3,578, in 1974.[9] As of 2011, only Hofstra Stadium remains, 
now renamed James M. Shuart Stadium. Downing Stadium, the original Yankee 
Stadium and Giants Stadium were demolished in 2002, 2008 and 2010 respectively.[39][40][41] 
While playing in the NASL indoor soccer league, the Cosmos' home arena 
was the Brenden Byrne Arena, now the Izod Center. The Cosmos sought to 
maximize their fanbase by appealing to as wide a demographic as possible. 
The club's name and badge were designed to be inclusive of New York's many 
immigrant communities; the logo purposefully avoided the standard American 
red, white and blue. In this the Cosmos succeeded, attracting noticeable 
support from local Europeans, Middle-Easterners and South Americans. The 
association of the team with the city's high society in both social and 
sporting contexts led to it becoming very popular among celebrities, both 
American and international.[13][14][37][42] "We transcended everything, 
every culture, every socio-economic boundary," goalkeeper Shep Messing 
said in 2006. "We were international, we were European, we were cool, we 
were Americans from the Bronx. We were everything to everybody."[14] The 
New York Cosmos are famous for having fielded numerous well-known players, 
almost all of whom were from outside the United States: examples include 
Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer and Carlos Alberto.[43] American players of note 
include goalkeeper Shep Messing – who was notoriously sold after posing 
nude for a magazine in December 1974, then brought back two years later 
on Pelé's insistence.[43] The Cosmos also fielded Werner Roth, a Yugoslavian-born 
US international defender, from 1972 to 1979. A number of Cosmos players 
were named in the NASL all-star teams selected by the league at the end 
of each season.[44][45] No NASL all-star from the Cosmos was born in the 
United States or Canada, where all of the league's teams were based; apart 
from Roth, both North Americans selected—Siegfried Stritzl and John Kerr—were 
born in Yugoslavia and Scotland respectively.[46] The New York Cosmos' 
first head coach was the English-American professional Gordon Bradley, 
who had played in the English Football League's lower divisions during 
the 1950s before moving to America in 1963. Bradley came out of retirement 
to become player-coach, a role he retained until his departure in 1975. 
Bradley's team won the league championship in 1972, but after it failed 
to reach the playoffs in both 1974 and 1975, he was dismissed. His replacement 
was another Englishman, Ken Furphy. His Cosmos succeeded in reaching the 
post-season, but lost the divisional championship game to Vancouver, prompting 
Furphy's own departure in favor of a return for Bradley, whose second spell 
lasted only half a season before he was promoted to an advisory role. Eddie 
Firmani, the South African-born former Italy forward, took over midway 
through the 1977 season.[16] His star-studded team won two consecutive 
Soccer Bowls—1977 and 1978—but lost the National Conference championship 
game in 1979. Firmani lost his job after falling out with Giorgio Chinaglia, 
a favorite of the Cosmos hierarchy.[16] His assistant, Ray Klivecka, who 
was born in Lithuania, became the team's first American head coach when 
he took Firmani's place midway through 1979. Klivecka was replaced before 
the 1980 season by Brazilian coach Júlio Mazzei, who won the Cosmos' fourth 
title at the end of that campaign before being succeeded by two joint head 
coaches, Hennes Weisweiler & Yasin Özdenak, in 1980. This duo's team came 
second in the 1981 NASL before Mazzei returned in 1982 and won his second 
championship with the Cosmos during that year. Firmani returned in 1984, 
the NASL's final year, in which the Cosmos failed to make the playoffs. 
Firmani remained as the team entered the Major Indoor Soccer League for 
the 1984–85 season, but was fired in early December, halfway through the 
season, and replaced by Klivecka, who returned after two games under the 
caretaker management of goalkeeper Hubert Birkenmeier. Klivecka was retained 
until the team ceased competitive play.[20] With five championships and 
seven first-place finishes, the Cosmos still rank as tied for the most
