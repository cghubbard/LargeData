Dell Diamond is the home stadium of the Round Rock Express, the AAA minor 
league baseball affiliate of the Texas Rangers major league baseball team. 
On April 16, 2000, the then-AA affiliate Express played their first home 
game at the stadium.[6] Dell Diamond is built on 85 acres (344,000 mÂ²) 
of former farmland on the east side of Round Rock, Texas,[7] a rapidly 
growing suburban city northeast of Austin. Nolan Ryan and his son Reid 
Ryan, part owners of the Express, originally wanted a stadium inside the 
city of Austin, but found a more attractive site in the City of Round Rock, 
with support from the city leadership. The city of Round Rock contributed 
$7.35 million to the $25 million cost of the facility. The city owns the 
ballpark and gave the Express a 38-year lease. Dell Computer Corporation 
(now Dell, Inc.) contracted for naming rights in a deal that will cost 
the company $2.5 million over 15 years. The stadium has also hosted several 
college games, including some early-season University of Texas contests 
in 2007 while the Longhorns' home field, UFCU Disch-Falk Field, had been 
undergoing a major renovation project. A showcase neutral-site game was 
played on February 21, 2012, between the Baylor Bears and Texas State Bobcats.[8] 
Dell Diamond is also the designated site for the University Interscholastic 
League state baseball tournament. On February 13, 2016, the stadium hosted 
a rugby union match between Canada and USA Rugby, as part of the Americas
