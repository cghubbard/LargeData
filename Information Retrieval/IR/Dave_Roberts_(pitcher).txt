David Arthur Roberts (September 11, 1944 – January 9, 2009) was an American 
left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for eight teams 
from 1969 to 1981. He was second in the National League (NL) with a 2.10 
earned run average (ERA) in 1971 for the San Diego Padres, after which 
he was traded to the Houston Astros, where he spent the four most productive 
years of his career. Over his major league career he won 103 games. He 
was one of the best Jewish pitchers all-time in major league history through 
2010, ranking fourth in career games (445; behind only Scott Schoeneweis, 
Ken Holtzman, and John Grabow), fourth in wins (103) and strikeouts (957) 
behind Sandy Koufax, Holtzman, and Steve Stone, and seventh in ERA (3.78).[1] 
Roberts was signed in June 1963 as an undrafted amateur free agent by the 
Philadelphia Phillies. He played on farm clubs for the Phillies, Kansas 
City A's, and Pittsburgh Pirates (who claimed him on waivers in April 1964), 
and was chosen by San Diego with the 39th pick in the 1968 Major League 
Baseball expansion draft.[2] In the minor leagues from 1963–69, he was 
65–32 with a 3.00 ERA. Roberts was 1968 Pitcher of the Year for the International 
League Columbus Jets, after going 18–5. After debuting with the Padres 
in 1969, Roberts was sixth in the NL in walks per 9 innings (2.13) in 1970. 
He went 14–17 for the last-place 1971 Padres, finishing second to the New 
York Mets' Tom Seaver with a 2.10 ERA. He was sixth in the voting for the 
NL Cy Young Award, seventh in walks per 9 innings (2.04), ninth in innings 
pitched (269.7), tenth in complete games (14), and 24th in the voting for 
the NL MVP Award. He held batters to a .191 batting average when runners 
were in scoring position. In December 1971 he was traded by the Padres 
to the Houston Astros for Mark Schaeffer, Bill Greif, and Derrel Thomas. 
His being traded by the Padres was just prior to the Padres signing another 
Dave Roberts (see below), who joined the club in 1972. If this trade had 
not occurred, the Padres roster would have featured two unrelated players 
named "Dave Roberts", making this among the few occasions where a team's 
roster featured two unrelated players with the same name. In 1972 he was 
12–7 for the Astros. In 1973, he recorded a career-best 17–11 record, setting 
a club record with a career-high six shutouts (second in the NL). He was 
sixth in the NL in wins and sacrifice hits (12), seventh in games started 
(36), eighth in complete games (12), and tenth in ERA (2.85) and walks 
per nine innings (2.24). In December 1975 he was traded by the Astros with 
Jim Crawford and Milt May to the Detroit Tigers for Mark Lemongello, Gene 
Pentz, Terry Humphrey and Leon Roberts. After a 16–17 season with the 1976 
Tigers, in which he was fifth in the American League (AL) in shutouts (4), 
seventh in games started (36) and ninth in complete games (18), he had 
surgery on his knee. In July 1977 he was purchased by the Chicago Cubs. 
In 1978 he batted .327 for the Cubs, with a .500 slugging percentage, in 
52 at bats. In February 1979 he signed as free agent with the San Francisco 
Giants. In June 1979 he was traded by the Giants with Len Randle and Bill 
Madlock to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Al Holland, Fred Breining, and Ed 
Whitson. Combined, in 1979 he had a 2.90 ERA. After pitching just two games 
for the Pirates in 1980, Roberts was purchased by the Seattle Mariners 
in April. He pitched the rest of the season in Seattle, going 2–3. Following 
that season, Roberts became a free agent, and in January 1981 he was signed 
by the Mets. He pitched just seven games for the Mets, going 0–3 with a 
9.39 ERA, before being released in May. In June, Roberts was signed as 
a free agent by the Giants, but never pitched for them in the majors. He 
was one of the best Jewish pitchers all-time in major league history through 
2010, ranking fourth in career games (445; behind only Scott Schoeneweis, 
Ken Holtzman, and John Grabow), fourth in wins (103) and strikeouts (957) 
behind Sandy Koufax, Holtzman, and Steve Stone, and seventh in ERA (3.78).[3] 
Roberts had a career batting average of .194 with seven home runs. On the 
final day of the 1976 season, Roberts gave up Hank Aaron's final career 
hit and RBI in the sixth inning. Aaron was lifted for a pinch runner. On 
January 9, 2009, Roberts died of lung cancer in Short Gap, West Virginia.[4][5][6] 
As noted above, his career overlapped with another Dave Roberts, who was 
a Major League Baseball third baseman from 1972 through 1982. Both played
