John Jordan "Buck" O'Neil (November 13, 1911 – October 6, 2006) was a first 
baseman and manager in the Negro American League, mostly with the Kansas 
City Monarchs. After his playing days, he worked as a scout, and became 
the first African American coach in Major League Baseball. In his later 
years he became a popular and renowned speaker and interview subject, helping 
to renew widespread interest in the Negro leagues, and played a major role 
in establishing the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. 
O'Neil's life was documented in Joe Posnanski's award-winning 2007 book 
The Soul of Baseball. Born in rural Carrabelle, Florida, O'Neil was initially 
denied the opportunity to attend high school due to racial segregation; 
at the time, Florida had only four high schools specifically for African 
Americans.[1] However, after working a summer in a celery field with his 
father, O'Neil left home to live with relatives and attend Edward Waters 
College in Jacksonville, where he completed high school and two years of 
college courses. He left Florida in 1934 for several years of semi-professional 
"barnstorming" experiences (playing interracial exhibition games).[2] The 
effort paid off, and in 1937, O'Neil signed with the Memphis Red Sox for 
their first year of play in the newly formed Negro American League. His 
contract was sold to the Monarchs the following year. O'Neil had a career 
batting average of .288 between 1937 and 1950, including five .300-plus 
seasons at the plate, as well as five seasons in which he did not top .260. 
In 1946, the first baseman led the NAL with a .350 batting average and 
followed that in 1947 with a .305 mark in 16 games. He also posted averages 
of .344 in 1940 and .330 in 1949. He played in four East-West All-Star 
Games in three different seasons and two Negro World Series. A World War 
II tour in the U.S. Navy from 1943–1945 briefly interrupted his playing 
career. O'Neil was named manager of the Monarchs in 1948 after Frank Duncan's 
retirement, and continued to play first base as well as a regular through 
1951, dropping to part-time status afterward. He managed the Monarchs for 
eight seasons from 1948 through 1955 during the declining years of the 
Negro leagues, winning two league titles and a shared title in which no 
playoff was held during that period. His two undisputed pennants were won 
in 1953 and 1955, when the league had shrunk to fewer than six teams. O'Neil 
was known to have played full-time in 1951 and as a reserve and pinch-hitter 
as late as 1955, but Negro leagues statistics for the period 1951 and after 
are considered extremely unreliable. Source: Hall of Fame Committee on 
African-American Baseball, 2006 When Tom Baird sold the Monarchs at the 
end of the 1955 season, O'Neil resigned as manager and became a scout for 
the Chicago Cubs.[3] He was the first African American scout in Major League 
Baseball, and was named the first black coach in the major leagues by the 
Cubs in 1962 and is credited for signing Hall of Fame player Lou Brock 
to his first contract. O'Neil is sometimes incorrectly credited with also 
having signed Hall of Famer Ernie Banks to his first contract; Banks was 
originally scouted and signed to the Monarchs by Cool Papa Bell, then manager 
of the Monarchs' barnstorming B team in 1949. Banks played briefly for 
the Monarchs in 1950 and 1953, his play interrupted by Army duty. O'Neil 
was Banks' manager during those stints, and Banks was signed to play for 
the Cubs more than two years before O'Neil joined them as a scout. After 
many years with the Cubs, O'Neil became a Kansas City Royals scout in 1988, 
and was named "Midwest Scout of the Year" in 1998. O'Neil gained national 
prominence with his compelling descriptions of the Negro leagues as part 
of Ken Burns' 1994 PBS documentary on baseball. Afterwards, he became the 
subject of countless national interviews, including appearances on the 
Late Show with David Letterman and The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder. 
In 1990, O'Neil led the effort to establish the Negro Leagues Baseball 
Museum (NLBM) in Kansas City, and served as its honorary board chairman 
until his death. In 1996, O'Neil became the recipient of an Honorary Doctor 
of Business Administration degree from the University of Missouri – Kansas 
City in Kansas City, Missouri. In February 2002, at the end of the NLBM's 
Legacy Awards annual banquet, O'Neil received an induction ring from the 
baseball scouts Hall of Fame in St. Louis.[4] O'Neil and all-star Ichiro 
Suzuki developed a relationship, with Ichiro attending the Negro Leagues 
Baseball Museum with O'Neil and seeking O'Neil's knowledge of the game 
when the Seattle Mariners would have road games in Kansas City. "With Buck, 
I felt something big. The way he carried himself, you can see and tell 
and feel he loved this game."[5] On May 13, 2006, he received an honorary 
doctorate in education from Missouri Western State University where he 
also gave the commencement speech. O'Neil was a member of the 18-member 
Baseball Hall of Fame Veterans Committee from 1981 to 2000 and played an 
important role in the induction of six Negro league players from 1995 to 
2001 during the time the Hall had a policy of inducting one Negro leaguer 
per year. O'Neil was nominated to a special Hall ballot for Negro league 
players, managers, and executives in 2006, but received fewer than the 
necessary nine votes (out of twelve) to gain admission; however, 17 other 
Negro league figures were selected. God's been good to me. They didn't 
think Buck was good enough to be in the Hall of Fame. That's the way they 
thought about it and that's the way it is, so we're going to live with 
that. Now, if I'm a Hall of Famer for you, that's all right with me. Just 
keep loving old Buck. Don't weep for Buck. No, man, be happy, be thankful.[6] 
On July 29, 2006, O'Neil spoke at the induction ceremony for the Negro 
league players at the Baseball Hall of Fame.[7] Just before the Hall of 
Fame ceremonies, O'Neil signed a contract with the Kansas City T-Bones 
on July 17 to allow him to play in the Northern League All-Star Game. Before 
the game, O'Neil was "traded" to the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks and was listed 
as the starting shortstop, although after drawing an intentional walk, 
he was replaced before actually playing in the field. At the end of the 
inning, another "trade" was announced that brought O'Neil back to the Kansas 
City team, allowing him to lead off the bottom of the inning as well (drawing 
another intentional walk). The T-Bones originally claimed that O'Neil, 
at age 94 years, 8 months, and 5 days, would be by far the oldest person 
to appear in a professional baseball game (surpassing 83-year-old Jim Eriotes 
who had struck out in another Northern League game just a week earlier).[8][9] 
However, that claim was in error, as the Schaumburg Flyers of the Northern 
League had signed Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe to a one-game contract and 
allowed him to face one batter on June 19, 1999 when he was 96 years old.[10] 
While O'Neil was the second-oldest pro player, the claim was amended that 
he would be the oldest person to make a plate appearance in a professional 
baseball game. The Kansas City T-Bones retired his number on May 26, 2006.[11] 
On August 5, 2006, O'Neil was admitted to a Kansas City hospital after 
complaining that he didn't feel well. He was admitted for fatigue and was 
released three days later only to be re-admitted September 17. On September 
28, Kansas City media reported that O'Neil's condition had worsened.[12][13] 
On October 6, O'Neil died at the age of 94 of heart failure and bone marrow 
cancer.[14] During the ESPN opening day broadcast of the 2007 Kansas City 
Royals, on April 2, 2007, Joe Morgan announced that the Royals would honor 
O'Neil by placing a fan in the Buck O'Neil Legacy Seat[15] in Kauffman 
Stadium each game who best exemplifies O'Neil's spirit. The seat itself 
has been replaced by a red seat amidst the all-blue seats behind home plate 
in Section 101, Row C, Seat 1. Due to the renovations and section renumbering 
in 2009 the seat number is now Section 127, Row C, Seat 9, and the seat 
bottom is now padded. The first person to sit in "Buck's seat" was Buck 
O'Neil's brother, Warren. On December 7, 2006, O'Neil was posthumously 
awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush;[16] 
the award was given to his brother, Warren, on his behalf on December 15. 
He was chosen due to his "excellence and determination both on and off 
the baseball field", according to the White House news release. He joins 
such sports notables as Jesse Owens, Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, and 
Jack Nicklaus in receiving the United States' highest civilian honor. On 
November 13, 2012 the family of Buck O'Neil donated his Presidential Medal 
of Freedom to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in honor of what would 
have been O'Neil's 101st birthday. The medal will be showcased in a special 
area of the NLBM dedicated to O'Neil.[17] On March 31, 2007—the day of 
Major League Baseball's first annual Civil Rights Game—O'Neil was posthumously 
awarded MLB's first annual Beacon of Life Award at the inaugural MLB Beacon 
Awards luncheon.[18][19] On October 24, 2007, O'Neil was posthumously given 
a Lifetime Achievement Award named after him. He had fallen short in the 
Hall of Fame vote in 2006; however, he was honored in 2007 with a new award 
given by the Hall of Fame, to be named after him. A statue of O'Neil is 
to be placed inside the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum on 18th and Vine 
in Kansas City, and the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award will be 
presented no more than every three years.[20] At the Hall of Fame induction 
ceremony on July 27, 2008, Joe Morgan gave a dedication speech for the 
award and talked about O'Neil's life, repeatedly citing the title of O'Neil's
