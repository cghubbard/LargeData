Bronson Anthony Arroyo (born February 24, 1977) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher who is currently a free agent. He has played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates between 2000 and 2002, 
the Boston Red Sox from 2003 to 2005, the Cincinnati Reds from 2006 to 
2013, and the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2014 to 2015. Bronson Arroyo was 
born Feb 24, 1977 in Key West, Florida. Arroyo's father is originally from 
Cuba. Arroyo later moved from Key West, Florida to Brooksville, Florida 
were he attended Hernando High School in Brooksville, Florida.[1] The Pittsburgh 
Pirates selected Arroyo in the third round of the 1995 MLB draft. Arroyo 
made his major league debut with Pittsburgh on June 12, 2000. During his 
rookie season in 2000, Arroyo was 2-6 with a 6.40 earned run average (ERA) 
in 20 appearances (12 starts). Playing 24 games (13 started) in 2001, Arroyo 
complied with a 5-7 record and a 5.09 ERA. Limited in playing time due 
to injuries and time in the minors, Arroyo played nine games (four started) 
in 2002 going 2-1 with a 4.00 ERA. Before the 2003 season, the Boston Red 
Sox claimed Arroyo from the Pirates off of waivers.[citation needed][2] 
Pitching for the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League, 
Arroyo pitched the fourth nine-inning perfect game in the 121-year history 
of the International League on August 10, 2003. He struck out nine, and 
went to a three-ball count to just three hitters all game long. He made 
6 appearances in the majors with his first career save and a 2.08 ERA. 
Arroyo improved in 2004, jumping from middle relief to be the Red Sox No. 
5 starter. On July 24, 2004, Arroyo hit Alex Rodriguez with a pitch, which 
led to a bench-clearing brawl. He compiled a 10–9 mark with a 4.03 ERA 
in 178 2⁄3 innings, while posting a respectable 3.02 strikeout-to-walk 
ratio (142-to-47). He led the majors with hitting batsmen with pitches, 
totaling 20 hit by pitches. Arroyo also got his first championship title 
when the Red Sox won the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Arroyo made 2 starts and 4 relief appearances in the postseason, compiling 
a 0–0 record with 2 holds and a 7.82 ERA for the 2004 World Series champion 
Red Sox. During Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, 
Alex Rodriguez knocked away the ball from Arroyo's glove. The umpires reversed 
the ruling that Rodriguez was safe, forcing Derek Jeter to return to 1st 
base, and calling Rodriguez out on the play for runner interference. Arroyo's 
most productive season so far came in 2005, when he posted career highs 
up to that time in wins (14), starts (32), innings (205.1) and pitching 
appearances (35). He also excelled at holding runners, as he only gave 
up five stolen bases. Before the 2006 season, Arroyo signed a three-year, 
$11.25 million contract with the Red Sox.[3] Arroyo said the deal was a 
"hometown discount" and agreed to the terms against the advice of his agent.[4][5] 
During spring training before the 2006 season, the Red Sox traded Arroyo 
to the Cincinnati Reds for outfielder Wily Mo Peña.[6] 2006 was a high 
point in Arroyo's career. Highlights of the season included a league-leading 
240 2⁄3 innings pitched, his first selection to an All-Star game, as well 
as his first career shutout in the major leagues. He finished the 2006 
year going 14-11 with an ERA of 3.29. In February 2007, Arroyo signed a 
contract extension with the Cincinnati Reds which kept him with the organization 
through the 2010 season, with an option for the year 2011.[3] He finished 
the 2007 season 9-15 and a 4.23 ERA. Arroyo pitched exactly 200 innings 
in 2008 by going 15-11 with a 4.77 ERA. During the season, Arroyo gave 
up 6 or more runs in a game 7 times in 34 starts including a game on 6/24 
against the Toronto Blue Jays where he gave up 11 earned runs in 1 inning 
of work (he pitched into the second inning without recording an out). Arroyo 
was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in his pitching hand during the 
2008–09 offseason. As a result, he missed games during the 2009 spring 
training, as well as being advised to stop playing guitar until the symptoms 
disappeared. After a sub-par first half of the 2009 season, Arroyo turned 
in an excellent second half, lowering his ERA from the 5's to the 3's, 
throwing multiple shutouts and complete games, and putting himself in position 
to be the Reds top starter in 2010 since Edinson Vólquez, the #1 starter 
in 2009, was out for the start of the season following Tommy John surgery. 
Arroyo finished the 2009 year with 2 shutouts, a 15-13 record, and a 3.84 
ERA. In 2010, Arroyo was chosen as the #2 starter in the Reds' first playoff 
series in 15 years. He pitched 5 1⁄3 innings against the Philadelphia Phillies, 
allowing one earned run and leaving with the lead. However, he would earn 
a no-decision as the Reds went on to lose the game. Arroyo won his first 
Gold Glove on November 10, 2010, the first by a Reds pitcher since Harvey 
Haddix in 1958. He finished the 2010 year 17-10 and a 3.88 ERA. The Reds 
exercised the 2011 option on Arroyo's contract on November 3, 2010.[7] 
After exercising his option, the Reds and Arroyo agreed on a three-year, 
$35 million contract extension, keeping him with the team through 2013. 
On March 26, 2011 Arroyo was diagnosed with mononucleosis, a condition 
where there is a high lymphocytes count in the blood from an Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) infection. Arroyo finished the 2011 season 9-12 and a 5.07 
ERA. He led the Majors with home runs allowed as he surrendered a total 
of 46 home runs. Arroyo finished the 2012 season by going 12-10 with a 
3.74 ERA. Arroyo was chosen by Reds' manager Dusty Baker to start Game 
2 of the 2012 National League Division Series versus the San Francisco 
Giants. He took a perfect game into the fifth inning, and allowed only 
two base-runners (a base hit with two outs in the fifth, and a walk in 
the seventh) in seven scoreless innings. The Reds won the game 9-0 to take 
a 2-0 series lead. The win was Arroyo's first in thirteen postseason appearances, 
including five starts. Bronson finished 2013 with an ERA of 3.79 and a 
win-loss record of 14-12. He also was the league leader in home runs allowed, 
giving up 32 long balls. Although the numbers paint a picture of a subpar 
pitching year, Arroyo managed to throw one shutout and two complete games 
in his age 36 season. In the offseason Bronson Arroyo elected to test free 
agency. On February 7, 2014, the Diamondbacks agreed to terms with Arroyo 
on a 2-year contract with $23.5 million guaranteed.[8][9] On June 16, Arroyo 
was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career, after 
leaving a start early against the Dodgers with an elbow injury.[10] It 
was announced on July 7 that Arroyo would be undergoing Tommy John surgery 
to repair a torn UCL, forcing him out for the remainder of the 2014 season. 
In 14 starts of the 2014 year, he went 7-4 with a 4.08 ERA. Arroyo did 
not make an appearance during the 2015 season, continuing his recovery 
from Tommy John surgery. On June 20, 2015, Arroyo, along with Touki Toussaint, 
was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Phil Gosselin.[11] On July 30, 2015, 
in a three-team trade, the Los Angeles Dodgers acquired Arroyo, Mat Latos, 
Michael Morse, Alex Wood, Jim Johnson, Luis Avilán, and José Peraza, while 
the Miami Marlins acquired minor league pitchers Victor Araujo, Jeff Brigham, 
and Kevin Guzman, and the Braves received Héctor Olivera, Paco Rodriguez, 
minor league pitcher Zachary Bird and a competitive balance draft pick 
for the 2016 MLB draft.[12] He did not appear in any games in 2015 for 
any team and the Dodgers declined his 2016 option, making him a free agent.[13] 
On January 26, 2016, Arroyo signed a minor league contract with the Washington 
Nationals that included an invitation to major league spring training.[14][15] 
A day after reports claimed former Red Sox teammate David Ortiz was among 
104 Major League players to have failed drug tests in 2003, Arroyo revealed 
he had used androstenedione and amphetamines in his career. Bronson Arroyo 
remarked that he would not be surprised if he was among the 104 players 
that failed tests, as he suspected the androstenedione he was taking may 
have been tainted with steroids.[16] His name was not among those revealed 
in the Mitchell Report. Arroyo's fastball is in the 87–92 miles per hour 
range. While it is considered average among major league pitchers, his 
fastball has excellent movement and Arroyo is adept at "spotting" it. He 
also throws a hard slider that moves away from right-handed batters, and 
a straight changeup as well. Arroyo's best pitch is his curveball. He throws 
the pitch from multiple arm angles and is known to throw it in any count. 
The angle of the curveball itself can vary from a straight 12–6 to a sweeping 
1–7. Arroyo's delivery is somewhat unique; he incorporates a leg kick in 
his pitching motion, extending his front leg completely straight and lifting 
it up to a level above his waist before delivering the ball. His kick often 
appears to reach head level and deceives hitters with its exaggerated motion. 
From the stretch position with runners on base, his leg-kick is much less 
pronounced and his delivery to home plate is very quick by major league 
standards. As a result, Arroyo is one of the better pitchers at holding 
runners on base. In 2005, Bronson Arroyo released his debut album, Covering 
the Bases. It included covers from bands such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, 
Stone Temple Pilots, Foo Fighters and Incubus. The album also includes 
the Red Sox victory song "Dirty Water" by The Standells, in which Arroyo 
is accompanied by Johnny Damon, Lenny DiNardo, and Kevin Youkilis. He also 
taught Kevin Millar how to play guitar and performed vocals for the song 
"Tessie" as covered by the Dropkick Murphys. In 2008, commercials for JTM 
Food Group featuring a 'music video' by Arroyo; also featuring FSN Ohio 
color analyst and former Cincinnati Reds player Chris Welsh began airing 
during Cincinnati Reds games. Arroyo appears as a vocalist on the song 
"Since You" on Chad Perrone's album, Wake.[17] Bronson made his public 
debut on stage in January 2004 at the Hot Stove Cool Music fundraiser at 
the Paradise Rock Club in Boston. He performed a cover of Pearl Jam's "Black" 
with teammate Kevin Millar. He later performed full sets at four other 
Hot Stove Cool Music events with a full band that featured saxophonist 
Elan Trotman and two members of Gnarls Barkley (drummer Eric Gardner and
