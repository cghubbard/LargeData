Michael Patrick Barrett (born October 22, 1976) is a former Major League 
catcher and current manager of the rookie-level Gulf Coast Nationals. He 
started his professional career with the Montreal Expos at age 18.[1] Barrett 
spent three years playing in Minor League Baseball as a shortstop and catcher.[2] 
He played with the Honolulu Sharks, West Palm Beach Expos, and Delmarva 
Shorebirds, and was elected to two Minor League All-Star games.[2] Barrett 
made his Major League debut in 1998 as a third baseman, but was shortly 
outrighted to the minor leagues to play with the Harrisburg Senators for 
a season.[3] Upon Barrett's return to the Major Leagues in 1999, he ranked 
among the top offensive rookies in various statistical categories.[3] Barrett 
failed to stay healthy during the 2003 season, which prompted the Expos 
to trade him to the Oakland Athletics, who in turn, traded him to the Chicago 
Cubs.[3] During his tenure with the Cubs, Barrett won a Silver Slugger 
Award in 2005, and recorded near career-high statistics in 2004 season.[3] 
The Cubs traded Barrett to the San Diego Padres in June of 2007.[4] Barrett 
sustained two major injuries, which caused him to miss 115 games with the 
Padres, and was subsequently released after the 2008 season.[5] Barrett 
attempted to make a comeback with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2009, but continued 
to struggle with injury issues, which led to his release in the subsequent 
offseason.[6] He spent the second half of the 2010 season in the New York 
Mets minor league system, and has not played professional baseball since, 
but has not officially announced his retirement. Barrett was also a volunteer 
assistant coach for the baseball team at the University of North Georgia.[7] 
Barrett was born in Atlanta.[1] He attended Pace Academy, where he excelled 
in baseball.[8] During his senior year, Barrett won Atlanta's Gatorade's 
Player of the Year, and was named to the All-USA High School and First 
Team High School All-Americans All-star teams.[3] He was considered to 
be one of the top draft prospects that year, and declared eligibility for 
the upcoming Major League Baseball Draft shortly after graduating from 
high school.[9] The Montreal Expos selected Barrett as the 28th overall 
selection in the 1995 draft.[10] He spent the next three years in the minors, 
playing in the Gulf Coast, South Atlantic, Hawaii Winter Baseball, and 
Florida State Leagues, during which he was converted from a shortstop to 
a catcher.[2] His Minor League Baseball career was highlighted in 1996, 
when he scored 57 runs and recorded 113 hits as a member of the Delmarva 
Shorebirds.[2] The Expos called Barrett to the Major Leagues on September 
19, 1998, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds as a third baseman.[3] 
He managed to hit a home run and a single in the game. After only playing 
eight games as an Expo, Barrett was sent to play for the Harrisburg Senators, 
a Class AA team from the Eastern League.[2] He recorded 145 hits, and seventy-eight 
runs, nineteen home runs, and eighty-seven RBI en route to winning the 
Double-A All-Star Catcher and Montreal Expos Minor League Player of the 
Year awards.[2] His performance allowed him to claim a spot on the Expos’ 
starting roster during the 1999.[3] During his first full season, Barrett 
had fifty-nine starts as a catcher, sixty-two as a third-baseman, and six 
as shortstop.[3] He also led all National League rookies with thirty-two 
doubles, while ranking as one of top statistical tiers in runs, hits, and 
run batted in among all other rookies.[3][10] Barrett struggled to perform 
consistently in the 2000 season. He committed fifteen errors during the 
course of the season, while earning .891 fielding percentage as a catcher.[1] 
In addition, he hit for only a .214 batting average, with only a .288 slugging 
percentage.[1] These difficulties combined to prompt the Expos to send 
him to the minors again. After playing thirty games with the Ottawa Lynx 
of the International League, Barrett returned to the major leagues before 
2001.[2] He was named onto the team's opening day lineup, and eventually 
earned a full-time spot on the team.[3] He was one the Expos' most consistent 
hitters,[11] and posted career high statistics that season; leading all 
National League catchers with thirty-three doubles.[3] Barrett also managed 
to improve his defensive performance by raising his fielding percentage 
to .993, while only committing seven errors.[10] He also saw success during 
the 2002 season. Barrett started the season by hitting home runs in the 
first two games of the season.[3] He would go on to have one of his best 
months in the Majors, scoring with four home runs, seventeen RBI, eight 
doubles, and scored ten runs.[12] The League recognized his efforts, and 
named Barrett the "National League co-Player of the Week" for the second 
week of April after he recorded a franchise record eleven RBI within two 
games.[3] Barrett finished the season with mixed results. While increasing 
his number of stolen bases and batting and slugging percentage, he failed 
to record as many runs, hits, and RBI, as he did in the previous season.[10] 
He committed nine errors, which resulted in a lower fielding percentage, 
but excelled in throwing out base runners.[10][13] Barrett missed almost 
half of the 2003 on account of three injuries. He suffered the first during 
a game against the Colorado Rockies, during which one of Steve Reed's pitches 
accidentally hit and bruised Barrett's index finger.[14] Barrett was able 
to continue playing, but claimed the injury had hindered his playing performance.[14] 
He eventually managed to overcome the injury in July. He recorded a batting 
average of .333 and fifteen RBI.[15] During this period, Barrett began 
to complain about tightness in his right hip flexor.[15] This ailment took 
its toll on Barrett during a game against the Atlanta Braves, when he strained 
the muscles while taking a checked swing.[15] The Expos sent Barrett on 
a rehabilitation assignment to play with the Edmonton Trappers, a AAA team 
from the Pacific Coast League. He only managed to play two games with team 
before fracturing his index finger on August 9.[16] Barrett returned to 
the major leagues on September 12, although the Expos were already out 
of playoff contention.[16][17] Barrett's long tenure with the Expos ended 
in December 2003. The team traded Barrett to the Oakland Athletics in exchange 
for Minor League pitcher Brett Price.[18] The Athletics then traded Barrett 
to the Chicago Cubs for Damian Miller, only days after the initial transaction.[19] 
Barrett, who had just spent six days with three teams, shortly signed a 
one-year contract with the Cubs, which was worth nearly $1,550,000.[20] 
He first practiced with Cubs during their annual spring training sessions, 
and reported receiving a cold reception from teammates.[21] Barrett went 
on to become one of their top hitters during the 2004 season. He played 
a crucial role in their wild card chase; Barrett maintained a .287 batting 
average and hit sixteen home runs and sixty-five RBI during the 2004 season.[3] 
He finished the season as one the league's top defensive catchers (fielding 
at .994 with six errors),[3] and led the Cubs in triples and sacrifice 
flies.[22][23] Barrett continued to be one of the Cubs’ most consistent 
hitters in the 2005 season. He batted over .300 in three months of the 
season, and finished with 16 home runs, 32 doubles, and 61 RBI.[24] Although 
he failed to meet and surpass the same statistical figures in the previous 
season, Barrett received a Silver Slugger Award for his efforts.[3] Additionally, 
Barrett was selected to represent the United States in the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic. He played in four games, and recorded one run batted in.[25] Barrett 
sought to improve his numbers in the 2006 season, but ran into several 
obstacles. During the team's annual series against the Chicago White Sox 
at U.S. Cellular Field, Barrett was involved in a major altercation with 
A. J. Pierzynski,[26] which eventually led to a bench-clearing brawl. He 
received a ten-game suspension, which he served near the middle of June.[23] 
Barrett rebounded after the incident, and batted over .300 in the final 
four months of the season.[23] He suffered an intrascrotal hematoma in 
early September, and was forced to miss the rest of the season. The injury 
and suspension caused Barrett to miss a significant portion of the season.[27] 
In his shortened season, Barrett hit sixteen home runs, which matched his 
previous career high, and nearly surpassed his hit total from 2005.[1] 
Barrett was unable to live up to expectations in the 2007 season. He was 
unable to replicate his statistical figures from the previous season, and 
finished May with a .244 batting average and only seven home runs.[23] 
Barrett infamously made headlines when he was involved in a nationally 
televised dugout altercation with pitcher Carlos Zambrano.[28] Lou Piniella 
dismissed both players for the afternoon, while the League proceeded to 
fine both players.[28] Nearly two weeks later, a television camera caught 
Barrett engaging in a heated argument with Rich Hill over a pitch that 
resulted in an RBI.[29] The tensions caused Barrett to lose his role as 
the Cubs' everyday starting catcher. While Barrett increased his batting 
average over the next few games, his career with the Cubs began to come 
to a close near the middle of June.[30] Various news sources reported that 
the Cubs had traded Barrett to the San Diego Padres on the morning of June 
20.[31][32] The Cubs officially confirmed these details in the afternoon, 
and revealed that Barrett was traded in exchange for Rob Bowen and Kyler 
Burke.[33] Despite stating he had no knowledge of the trade until hearing 
rumors in the morning, Barrett expressed his appreciation and well wishes 
to the Cubs organization on his homepage.[34][35] He received a one-game 
suspension on July 22, after arguing with an umpire over a third strike.[36] 
Barrett sustained a concussion on August 5, after a base-running accident 
against the San Francisco Giants.[37] The Padres placed Barrett on the 
fifteen-day disabled list.[37] After returning from the injury, Barrett's 
performance declined. His batting average dropped from .266 to .244, while 
he produced near career low statistics.[23] Barrett became a free agent 
after the end of the season, but was offered arbitration from the Padres.[38] 
The Tampa Bay Rays expressed interest in signing Barrett, even though the 
signing would involve trading the Padres a future second round draft pick 
as compensation.[39] Barrett accepted the Padres' arbitration offer on 
December 7.[38] The Padres placed Barrett on the disabled list on April 
8, 2008, after he sustained an elbow injury.[40] The team later activated 
him on May 25, after he had recovered, and completed a minor league rehabilitation 
assignment.[40] On July 2, 2008, Barrett was rushed to the hospital after 
fouling a pitch off his face.[41] He required surgery to repair the damage, 
and had been placed on the disabled list for the second time in 2008.[42] 
The Padres waived Barrett on October 11, after he previously expressed 
interest in testing the free-agent market.[43] On December 29, 2008, Barrett 
signed a Minor League deal with the Toronto Blue Jays, and attended spring 
training as a non-roster invitee.[44] He earned the back-up catcher role 
for the Toronto Blue Jays during spring training. He was scheduled to back 
up Rod Barajas,[45] but Barrett tore a muscle in his right shoulder while 
attempting to retrieve a wild pitch on April 17, 2009.[46] Barrett was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 18, and was expected to return 
within the two weeks.[46] Prior to the injury, Barrett had made seven appearances 
with a .167 batting average.[46] The Blue Jays activated Barrett from the 
disabled list on July 6, 2009, and designated to Triple-A for a rehab assignment, 
where he sustained a season-ending injury.[47] The Jays never recalled 
Barrett to their roster after the designation, and released him in the 
following offseason.[6] He only played seven Major League games in 2009, 
in which he recorded a .167 batting average, three hits, and one home run.[23] 
Barrett signed a minor league deal with the Mets on June 29, 2010, and 
was assigned to the Class-A St. Lucie Mets.[48] In early August, he was 
reassigned to play for their Class AAA affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons.[49] 
On November 6, 2010, Barrett elected and was granted free agency.[50] He 
has not played professional baseball since. While playing for the Chicago 
Cubs, Barrett was involved in two incidents with Houston Astros pitcher 
Roy Oswalt during the 2004 season. On August 22, 2004, Oswalt struck Barrett.[21] 
Barrett, believing the pitch was a reaction to a three-run home run that 
Aramis Ramírez had previously hit, confronted Oswalt, and prompted both 
teams to take the field. Oswalt was ejected from the game, as the Astros 
went on to lose 11-6.[51][52] Five days later, during another Cubs-Astros 
game, Barrett mouthed off to Oswalt and attempted to confront him.[21] 
The game's umpires restrained the two before a fight could break out, but 
not before both benches cleared out.[52] Oswalt remained in the game, and 
defeated the Cubs 15-7.[53] In a post-game press conference, Barrett condemned 
Oswalt's actions, and stated, "We're going to see him again."[52] On May 
20, 2006, Barrett was involved in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski, 
during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and 
Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a sacrifice fly, 
which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run.[54] Pierzynski 
collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down.[55] 
Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski 
got up, he bumped into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him.[55] Scott Podsednik 
came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett.[55] Anderson and John Mabry 
eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and 
stormed the field.[55] The game's umpires ejected Barrett, Pierzynski, 
Anderson, and Mabry.[55] Barrett later received a ten-game suspension, 
while Pierzynski was fined.[26] Additionally, Anderson and the Sox's third 
base coach were also suspended for a fewer number of games.[26] The Cubs 
went on to lose the game by a score of seven to nothing.[54] On June 30, 
the two met during batting practice, and made amends.[56] The following 
season, Barrett made headlines again when he got into a fight with teammate 
Carlos Zambrano. During a game against the Atlanta Braves on June 1, 2007, 
tensions began to rise between the two players when the Cubs allowed the 
Braves to score five runs in the fifth inning.[28] The Braves recorded 
20 hits, en route to winning 8-5.[57] However, their productivity became 
overshadowed by the scuffle between Zambrano and Barrett. As the two returned 
to the dugout, they had an exchange of words, which escalated into a small 
fight.[28] After Lou Piniella dismissed the two from the game, another 
fight ensued within the Cubs’ clubhouse, and Zambrano punched Barrett's 
lip.[28] The wound required Barrett to go to the hospital immediately and 
receive stitches.[28] Zambrano remorsefully admitted he was at fault after 
the ordeal, and Barrett later stated they had resolved their differences.[58][59] 
Both players received fines for undisclosed amounts of money.[58] On December 
20, 2013, the Washington Nationals, named Michael Barrett, the manager 
of the Gulf Coast Nationals.[60] Barrett is married to Stephanie and they 
have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott 
Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, along with many other teams over his 
fifteen-year career.[61] Barrett has spent a considerable portion of his 
personal life devoted to helping children.[62] He runs several youth baseball 
programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with 
the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League.[62] He also works with the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser fortunate and sick 
children.[3] More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster 
to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital 
amaurosis. Michael Barrett donated $50,000 to Project 3000 and pledged 
an additional sum of money for every home run he hits.[63] Barrett was 
also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which
