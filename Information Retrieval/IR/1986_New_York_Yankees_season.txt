The New York Yankees' 1986 season was the 84th season for the Yankees. 
The team finished with a record of 90-72, finishing in second-place, 5.5 
games behind the Boston Red Sox. New York was managed by Lou Piniella. 
The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. 1986 was the first time since 1904 
that the Yankees finished second in the standings to the Red Sox.[14] [1]

On August 10, 1986, the Yankees retired Martin's uniform number 1 and dedicated 
a plaque in his honor for Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque contains 
the words, There has never been a greater competitor than Billy. Martin 
told the crowd, "I may not have been the greatest Yankee to put on the 
uniform, but I am the proudest." On May 24, 1986, on the season finale 
of Saturday Night Live, co-host Martin was "fired" by executive producer 
Lorne Michaels for being "drunk" in a skit, slurring his lines. During 
the goodnights, Martin "sets fire" to the dressing room in retaliation.[15] 
(Only three cast members would be re-hired the next season.) In 1988, on 
Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update, comedian Dennis Miller opened the 
sports with, "In Calgary tonight, Katarina Witt won the gold medal in figure 
skating, prompting Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to fire manager Billy 
Martin." Note: Pos = position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits;
