Luis Andrew Polonia Almonte (born October 12, 1963) is a former Major League 
Baseball outfielder and designated hitter. He currently resides in Santiago, 
in the Dominican Republic, his hometown. Signed by the Oakland Athletics 
as an amateur free agent in 1984, Polonia would make his Major League Baseball 
debut with the Oakland Athletics on April 24, 1987, and appear in his final 
game on October 1, 2000. He played for two World Series Championship teams, 
winning with Atlanta in 1995 and the New York Yankees in 2000. Polonia 
was born on October 12, 1963 in the Dominican Republic. He joined the Dominican 
League at an early age and was known as a strong contact hitter, as well 
as a below-average defensive outfielder. Though he had good speed, he was 
not a wise baserunner and led his league in caught stealing a total of 
five times between the minors and majors. He was also known for his tremendous 
performance during winter ball. He is one of the top 10 contact hitters 
in Dominican League history and is the all-time Caribbean series leader 
in hits, doubles, and runs scored as of 2008.[1] Throughout his career, 
Polonia was known as a quick runner and stolen base threat. Polonia began 
his career in 1987 with the Oakland Athletics. He played in 125 games that 
year hitting .287 with 10 triples and 29 stolen bases. The following year, 
Polonia played in only 84 games, hitting .292 with 29 steals in 36 attempts. 
Polonia's strong play helped the Oakland A's reach the postseason and advance 
to the World Series in 1988. However, Polonia was 1 for 9 in the series 
as Oakland lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[1] In 1989, he was hitting 
.286 with 13 steals in 17 attempts before being traded to the Yankees.[1] 
Polonia was traded to the Yankees in 1989 in the deal that sent Rickey 
Henderson to Oakland.[2] During the remainder of the season, he hit .313 
with 9 steals. In October, he was sentenced to 60 days in prison after 
pleading guilty to having sex with a minor that August.[2] Polonia began 
the 1990 season with seven hits in his first 22 at-bats. After only 11 
games,[3] he was traded to the California Angels for Claudell Washington 
and Rich Monteleone. Polonia finished the 1990 season with 128 hits in 
381 at-bats. Polonia hit .336 for the Angels in 1991, while attaining a 
career-high 122 OPS+ as well as tying Nelson Liriano and Lance Johnson 
for third place with nine triples in the American League, but also led 
the league in times caught stealing.[1][3] The following year, his average 
fell to .286, but he tied Shane Mack for the eighth place in the American 
League in triples. He had 48 stolen bases but was caught 23 times, leading 
the league.[1] In 1993, his average fell to .271, but he stole 51 bases, 
tying Roberto Alomar for second (behind Kenny Lofton), but tied Chad Curtis 
for the league lead with 24 times caught stealing. In 1994, he signed as 
a free agent with the Yankees, hitting .311 in the strike-shortened season. 
He stole 20 of 32 bases that year, but tied Kenny Lofton and Felix Jones 
with 12 times caught stealing.[1] When baseball resumed in 1995, he hit 
.261 before being traded to the Atlanta Braves and provided a boost down 
the stretch when he was 2 for 5 with 3 RBIs in the NLDS and NLCS, despite 
playing in a platoon role. In the game one of the 1995 World Series, Polonia 
drove in Fred McGriff for the game-winning RBI. Overall, he was 4-for-14 
with a walk, a double, 3 runs scored, and 4 RBIs as he earned his first 
World Series ring. Polonia celebrated the Series win by encasing his World 
Series ring inside what is believed to be the largest ball of twine in 
North America.[4] Prior to the season, the Seattle Mariners signed Polonia 
to a non-guaranteed contract. He was released during spring training. He 
was soon picked up by the Baltimore Orioles where he played 14 games for 
the Rochester Red Wings before being called up and hitting .240 over 58 
games. He was cut in August and signed with the Braves, where he hit .419 
down the stretch, but went 0 for 10 with just one walk that postseason 
as the Braves fell to the New York Yankees in six games.[1] In 1997, he 
signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, but instead played for the Mexico 
City Tigres. He led the Mexican League in steals and was second in average.[1] 
Playing in winter ball that year, he hit .382 with a league-leading 15 
doubles and 60 hits. In 1998, he hit .381 with 36 of 45 steals and 82 RBIs. 
In winter ball, he won the batting title with a .336 average, ahead of 
Luis Castillo. Polonia was signed late in the 1999 season by the Detroit 
Tigers, hitting .324 and slugging 10 home runs in 87 games.[3] In 2000, 
Polonia hit .273 in 80 games for the Tigers before being released. On August 
3, 2000, Polonia signed with the Yankees after being released by the Detroit 
Tigers. He served as an outfielder down the stretch while also receiving 
some time as a designated hitter.[5] In the 2000 American League Division 
Series, Polonia served as a pinch hitter for Jorge Posada in Game 4, where 
he recorded a single.[6] He received two at-bats in the 2000 World Series,
