As player As manager William Joseph Rigney (January 29, 1918 – February 
20, 2001) was an American infielder and manager in Major League Baseball. 
A 26-year Major League veteran, Rigney played for the New York Giants from 
1946 to 1953, then fashioned an 18-year career as a manager (1956–72; 1976) 
with the Giants, Los Angeles/California Angels and Minnesota Twins. The 
Bay Area native was the last manager of the Giants in New York City (1957), 
and their first in San Francisco (1958). Three years later, Rigney became 
the first manager in Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim franchise history. Born 
in Alameda, California, Rigney batted and threw right-handed, stood 6 feet 
1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 178 pounds (81 kg). He began his professional 
baseball career in 1938 when he signed with the unaffiliated Oakland Oaks 
of the top-level Pacific Coast League. After seasoning in the Class B Western 
International League, Rigney played the full seasons of 1941–42 with the 
Oaks, then performed World War II service in the United States Coast Guard 
from 1943–45. Acquired by the Giants during the war, he was a 28-year-old 
rookie in 1946 and played third base, shortstop and second base during 
his MLB career—appearing in over 100 games played in each of his first 
four MLB seasons. His most productive season came in 1947, when he reached 
career highs in home runs (17), RBI (59), runs (84), hits (142), doubles 
(24) and games played (130). He was the Giants' regular second baseman 
in 1948, and was selected to the National League All-Star team, where he 
drew a base on balls off Joe Coleman in his only plate appearance. As a 
utility infielder, Rigney was a member of the 1951 NL champion Giants, 
and he appeared in four games of the 1951 World Series, collecting one 
hit in four at bats (a single off Vic Raschi), with an RBI, as a pinch 
hitter. As a big-leaguer, Rigney was a .259 career hitter with 510 hits, 
41 home runs and 212 runs batted in 654 games. Following his MLB playing 
career, Rigney was named manager of the Giants' top farm club, the Triple-A 
Minneapolis Millers, in 1954–55, then was promoted to skipper of the Giants 
in 1956, succeeding future Baseball Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher. 
Despite the presence of Hall of Fame center fielder Willie Mays, the Giants' 
final two seasons in Upper Manhattan, 1956 and 1957, were dismal: they 
lost 87 and 85 games, respectively, finished in sixth place in the eight-team 
National League both years, and their attendance fell below 700,000. But 
upon their move to San Francisco in 1958—and rejuvenated by young players 
such as Orlando Cepeda, Jim Davenport, Felipe Alou, and, later, Willie 
McCovey—the Giants returned to the first division and contended for the 
NL pennant in 1959. The 1960 Giants moved into new Candlestick Park and 
were expected to again contend for the league title. The club got off the 
mark quickly, winning 20 of its first 29 games. But then the Giants stumbled, 
losing 16 of their next 29, and were coming off a three-game series sweep 
at home by the eventual world champion Pittsburgh Pirates when, on June 
17, Rigney was fired. At 33–25, the club was in second place, four games 
behind Pittsburgh, when Rigney was dismissed. Tom Sheehan, the veteran 
scout who replaced Rigney, fared even more poorly, however, going only 
46–50 as the Giants plummeted into fifth place by season's end. Rigney 
was not unemployed for long. He became the first skipper in the history 
of the expansion Los Angeles Angels of the American League in 1961. Rigney's 
old mentor, Durocher, was interested in returning to baseball as manager 
of the Angels. Gene Autry and Robert O. Reynolds, the Angels' owners, originally 
wanted to hire another future Hall of Fame manager, Casey Stengel, a resident 
of nearby Glendale who had been fired by the New York Yankees after the 
1960 World Series. But Stengel declined all managerial offers and spent 
1961 in temporary retirement. Autry and Reynolds bypassed Durocher and 
chose Rigney instead. While the Angels' maiden edition lost 91 games and 
finished eighth in the ten-team AL, the 1962 team, paced by young pitchers 
Dean Chance and Bo Belinsky, stunned baseball by finishing in third place 
with an 86–76 record during their second season of existence. As a result, 
Rigney was named Manager of the Year by The Sporting News. During Rigney's 
eight full years with the Angels, the club played in three home ballparks—Wrigley 
Field (Los Angeles), Dodger Stadium and Anaheim Stadium—and also compiled 
winning records in 1964 and 1967. But 1969, Rigney's ninth season, proved 
catastrophic. The Angels started the year 11–28 and were mired in a ten-game 
losing streak when Rigney was fired on May 27 and succeeded by Lefty Phillips. 
Later in 1969, Rigney joined the San Francisco Giants' radio broadcast 
team to close out the season; coincidentally, KSFO, the Giants flagship 
station, was then owned by Autry and Reynolds. Returning to the field (and 
to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis–St. Paul) the next year, Rigney succeeded 
Billy Martin as manager of the Minnesota Twins in 1970, leading them to 
98 victories and the 1970 American League West Division championship. But 
the Twins fell in three straight games to the eventual world champion Baltimore 
Orioles in the 1970 American League Championship Series, then won only 
74 games in 1971. The Twins recovered somewhat in 1972, and were at 36–34 
on July 5 when Rigney was replaced by one of his coaches, Frank Quilici. 
After serving as a scout for the San Diego Padres and California Angels 
(1973–74), Rigney had a second managerial stint with the Giants in 1976, 
a year of transition between the Horace Stoneham and Bob Lurie ownerships. 
Rigney's 1976 club went only 74–88 and finished 28 games behind the world 
champion Cincinnati Reds. Rigney finishd with a managerial record of 1,239 
wins and 1,321 losses.[1] In an 18-season managerial career, Rigney posted 
a 1,239–1,321 record (.484) in 2,561 games. The Twins' three-and-out loss 
in the 1970 ALCS was his only MLB postseason managing appearance. As a 
minor league pilot, Rigney won the 1955 American Association championship 
at the helm of the Minneapolis Millers. After leaving the Giants at the 
close of his second managerial term in 1976, he served as a front-office 
consultant and a radio and television broadcaster for the Oakland Athletics 
in the 1980s. Rigney died in Walnut Creek, California, at age of 83. The 
"Bill Rigney Good Guy Award" is given each year to a San Francisco Giant
