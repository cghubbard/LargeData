Morton Cecil Cooper (March 2, 1913 – November 17, 1958) was an American 
baseball pitcher who played eleven seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played from 1938 to 1949 for the St. Louis Cardinals, Boston Braves, 
New York Giants, and Chicago Cubs.[1] He batted and threw right-handed 
and was listed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 210 pounds (95 kg). He was 
the National League Most Valuable Player in 1942. Born in Atherton, Missouri, 
Cooper signed for the St. Louis Cardinals as an amateur free agent in 1933 
and played for seven of their minor league affiliates until 1938, when 
the Cardinals promoted him to the major leagues. Cooper debuted with the 
Cardinals in 1938 and had a 12–6 record as a 1939 rookie. He was 24–21 
over the next two seasons before hitting his stride, helping the team to 
World Series titles in both 1942 and 1944. He was the 1942 National League 
Most Valuable Player. At the start of the 1945 season, both Mort and his 
brother Walker staged contract holdouts, demanding that the Cardinals raise 
their salaries to $15,000 each.[2] Subsequently, Mort was traded that May 
to the Boston Braves after only three starts; bothered by longtime elbow 
problems, he ended the year only 9–4. After a 13–11 season in 1946, he 
began 1947 at 2–5 and was traded to the New York Giants in June. He was 
1–5 for the Giants over the rest of the season, and was released in July 
1948 after not pitching all year due to arm trouble. He ended his career 
with a single 1949 relief appearance for the Chicago Cubs in which he failed 
to record an out.[3] He retired with a record of 128–75, a 2.97 ERA, 913 
strikeouts, and 33 shutouts in 1840 2⁄3 innings. He was selected to the 
NL All-Star team four times (1942, 1943, 1945, 1946). He was married to 
Bernadine, who filed for divorce in 1945. Together, they had one son, Lonnie.[4] 
Cooper lived in Houston for several years in the 1950s. He developed cirrhosis 
and a staphylococcal infection. He was hospitalized at St. Vincent's Infirmary
