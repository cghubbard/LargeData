Henry Luther "Hinkey" Haines (December 23, 1898 – January 9, 1979) was 
a professional athlete who played American football in the National Football 
League and baseball in the Major League Baseball association. Haines was 
a star of the New York Giants football team in his time and has the distinction 
of being the only athlete to have played on national championship teams 
in both baseball and football. He won the 1923 World Series with the New 
York Yankees and the 1927 NFL Championship with the New York Giants. Haines 
was born in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. He batted and threw right-handed, was 
5'10" in height and 170 pounds in weight. Haines graduated from Red Lion 
High School in 1916 and attended Lebanon Valley College, where he played 
a major role in shaping their football program. Haines left Lebanon Valley 
in 1918 to serve in World War I. After serving in World War I, he attended 
Penn State University in 1919. He earned varsity letters in baseball, football, 
and basketball, and joined Delta Upsilon fraternity. Haines earned All-American 
honors in both football and baseball while at Penn State. He is in the 
Red Lion Area Senior High School's Hall of Fame. On April 20, 1923, Haines 
made his Major League debut at the age of 24. He only played one season, 
and was used many times as a defensive replacement/pinch runner. In his 
first three appearances, he was used as a pinch runner, coming around to 
score on all three occasions. In his overall 28 games, he collected nine 
runs, four hits, two doubles, three RBI, three stolen bases and a .160 
batting average. In the field, Haines was flawless. He had a 1.000 fielding 
percentage with 17 chances. Haines appeared in two World Series games in 
1923, registering one at bat without a hit. As a pinch runner, however, 
he was able to score one run: the tying run for the Yankees in the final 
game. Haines stayed in the game defensively, and was playing center field 
when the Yankees recorded the last out in the 1923 World Series to become 
world champions. This was Haines' last professional baseball appearance. 
In the fall, he played professional football and was the quarterback of 
the 1927 New York Giants team—a team that won the Giants' first NFL championship. 
Joe Guyon was with him in the backfield. After playing for the Giants from 
1925 to 1928, he played for the Staten Island Stapletons in 1929 and 1931, 
which he also coached. After his career as halfback for the Giants ended, 
he became their offensive coach from 1926 through 1931. Haines was an NFL 
official for a time after he finished coaching. In later years, Haines 
settled in the Philadelphia area where he became active in Little Theater 
as an actor and director. He died on January 9, 1979 in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. 
His body was laid to rest in Middletown Cemetery in Middletown, Dauphin
