tryouts in the Dominican Republic.[1] He played in the Rookie-level Arizona 
League for the Arizona League Rangers in 2008.[2] Garcia played for the

for the 2012 season.[4] After batting .292 with 12 doubles, 11 triples, 
two home runs, 30 runs batted in, and 31 stolen bases in 100 games for

season to protect him from being selected by another team in the Rule 5 
draft.[5] García played for the Dominican Republic national baseball team 
in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. He spent most games not playing, but 
observing veteran shortstops Miguel Tejada and Jose Reyes.[6] He made the

He made his major league debut on April 6 as a pinch hitter for Lance Berkman, 
striking out in his first at-bat.[8] He was optioned to the Triple-A Round 
Rock Express on June 14, 2013 when Ian Kinsler returned from the disabled 
list. On August 11, 2013, García was dealt to the Chicago White Sox as 
the player to be named later in the trade that sent Alex Ríos to the Texas 
Rangers. He was then optioned to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights.[9] The 
White Sox promoted García on August 22.[10] In 20 games with Chicago in 
2013, he hit .204 with 1 RBI and 6 SB. With both Gordon Beckham and Jeff 
Keppinger injured to begin the season, García made the Opening Day roster 
in 2014.[11] On April 16, García made his first career appearance on the 
mound, working the 14th inning in a game against Boston. He gave up 2 runs 
on 2 walks and a double, picking up the loss.[12] On June 4, García hit
