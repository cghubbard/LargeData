Eri Yoshida (吉田 えり, Yoshida Eri?, born January 17, 1992, in Yokohama, Kanagawa, 
Japan) is a Japanese professional baseball player. She plays as a sidearm 
knuckleball pitcher for the Ishikawa Million Stars of the independent Baseball 
Challenge League.[1] In 2008, at the age of 16, she became the first female 
drafted by a Japanese men's professional baseball team.[2] Yoshida was 
fourteen years old when she taught herself how to throw the knuckleball 
after watching Major League Baseball pitcher Tim Wakefield on television.[3][4] 
She stands 1.55 metres (5 ft 1 in) tall,[2] and her pitches have been clocked 
at 101 kilometres per hour (63 mph), while her knuckleball measures around 
50 mph.[5] As a high-school sophomore at Kawasaki-kita Senior High School 
in Kawasaki, she threw the pitch well enough to earn a place on the school's 
baseball team.[3] Her success caused a sensation in the national media, 
who dubbed her the Knuckle Princess.[3] In 2008, she signed a contract 
to play for the Kobe 9 Cruise of Kansai Independent Baseball League.[2][4] 
Yoshida made her professional baseball debut at the Osaka Dome in the opening 
game of the Kansai Independent Baseball League on March 26, 2009 in front 
of 11,592 fans. She faced two batters, walking the first and striking out 
the second in a 5-0 win over the Osaka Gold Villicanes.[6] She appeared 
in 11 games for the Kobe 9 Cruise and moved on after the season to focus 
on advancing up the pro ranks. She appeared in a one-inning battle against 
the top hitters of the Hiroshima Carp on November 24, 2009.[7] On December 
15, 2009 the Arizona Winter League announced that they had reached an agreement 
to allow Yoshida to play in their thirty-five game season.[5] The league 
served to showcase players who had been overlooked by major league teams 
in the draft by giving them a chance to play in front of professional scouts.[5] 
On February 12, 2010, Yoshida got her first win in Arizona Winter League 
play, throwing four shut-out innings in a 5-0 win for her team, the Yuma 
Scorpions, versus Team Canada of the Arizona Winter League.[8] On February 
28, 2010, she was offered a contract to play in the Golden Baseball League, 
the major independent minor league in western North America, by the Chico 
Outlaws.[1] The Outlaws were managed by former major league all-star Garry 
Templeton and the team president and general manager is former Los Angeles 
Dodgers outfielder Mike Marshall. On March 2, 2010, she trained with Tim 
Wakefield at the Boston Red Sox minor league training facility.[9] On April 
8, 2010, she signed the contract with the Chico Outlaws and became the 
first female professional baseball player in the U.S. since the retirement 
of Ila Borders 10 years previously, and the first ever to play professionally 
in two countries.[10] Her debut playing for the Chico Outlaws was on 29 
May 2010.[11] On Tuesday July 27, 2010, Yoshida made her first road start 
against the Victoria Seals of the independent Golden League in Victoria, 
British Columbia, making her the first woman in baseball history to pitch 
professionally in three different countries.[12][13] Yoshida was honored 
with a spot on Venus Zine's “25 under 25” list of remarkable women for 
2009.[14] On August 21, 2010, she was the feature story on FOX Sports' 
This Week In Baseball, where she was shown meeting her idol, Boston Red 
Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield. Yoshida ended the 2010 season with an 0-4 record, 
but earned praise for her work ethic from teammates and her manager, Garry 
Templeton.[1] Templeton noted that any 18-year-old would struggle in the 
Golden Baseball League.[15] Yoshida played in the Arizona Winter League, 
an instructional league, in February 2011 but chose to start the 2011 season 
with an amateur team from Japan that would be playing in southern California. 
She signed a contract with the Chico Outlaws of the professional North 
American Baseball League in July and pitched a no-decision as her team 
beat the Edmonton Capitals. She was traded later that week to Maui, rejoining 
her manager from last year, Garry Templeton, and started on August 9 as 
she pitched 5-innings of one-hit ball and picked up her first professional 
win in the U.S. as Maui defeated Edmonton 4-1. In 2012 she returned to 
Japan to play for the Hyogo Blue Sandars of the Kansai Independent Baseball 
League.[16][17] On May 3, 2012, Yoshida made her first start of the year 
for Hyogo. She hurled five innings, giving up just one run, walking 1 while 
striking out 2. She earned the win, making her the first woman to win a 
game in the Kansai Independent League.[18] In June 2012, Yoshida returned 
to pitch for Na Koa Ikaika Maui of the North American Baseball League. 
In her first start on June 9, 2012, she earned the win in a 10-2 victory 
over the Hawaii Stars. She hurled 7-2/3 innings, giving up only four hits 
and two runs, as well as walking one batter and striking out another.[19] 
Yoshida won her next two starts to begin the year with a 3-0 record, but 
then experienced problems controlling her pitches and lost five games in 
a row.[20][21] She ended the season with a record of 4 wins and 6 losses
