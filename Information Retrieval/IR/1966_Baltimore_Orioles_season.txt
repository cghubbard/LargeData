The 1966 Baltimore Orioles season involved the Orioles finishing first 
in the American League with a record of 97 wins and 63 losses, nine games 
ahead of the runner-up Minnesota Twins. It was their first AL pennant since 
1944, when the club was known as the St. Louis Browns. The Orioles swept 
the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers in four games to register their first-ever 
World Series title. The team was managed by Hank Bauer, and played their 
home games at Memorial Stadium. Right fielder Frank Robinson, acquired 
via trade from the Cincinnati Reds in the off-season, won the Triple Crown, 
leading the AL with a .316 average, 49 home runs, and 122 RBI. He was named 
winner of the American League MVP Award, becoming the first player in the 
history of Major League Baseball to win MVP honors in both the American 
and National Leagues.[7] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Infielders
