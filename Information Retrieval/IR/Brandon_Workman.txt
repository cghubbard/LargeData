Brandon Carlin Workman (born August 13, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Workman attended Bowie High School in Bowie, Texas, and the University 
of Texas at Austin, where he played college baseball for the Texas Longhorns.[1] 
At Bowie High, Workman was a four-year letter winner, playing shortstop 
and pitcher. As a senior and captain of the team, Workman went 10-2 with 
a 0.81 ERA and 171 strikeouts in 76 innings. As a hitter, he batted .481, 
and earned first-team All-State twice, first-team Louisville Slugger High 
School All-American, and Rawlings All-Region honors. During his freshman 
season at Texas, Workman went 5-2 and was named to the Honor Roll. During 
his sophomore season, Workman went 3-5 and held a 4.72 ERA in Big 12 conference 
play. Workman would then have an excellent junior season, before entering 
the MLB draft. Workman also played for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape 
Cod Baseball League, and was a Cape Cod Baseball League All-Star, posting 
a 3.44 ERA as a freshman.[2] Workman was originally drafted by the Philadelphia 
Phillies in the third round of the 2007 draft, but instead opted to attend 
college. The Red Sox drafted Workman in the second round, with the 57th 
pick of the 2010 draft, and signed him for a signing bonus of $800,000.[3] 
In 2012, Workman posted a 5–1 win–loss record for the Portland Sea Dogs 
of the Class AA Eastern League. He was named the Red Sox's 2012 Minor League 
Pitcher of the Year, after leading the Carolina League in fewest baserunners 
per nine innings while ranking second in walks plus hits per inning pitched 
and fourth in earned run average. He was promoted to the Pawtucket Red 
Sox of the Class AAA International League in 2013. He was promoted to Boston 
in July after a season-ending foot injury to Andrew Miller. In his major 
league debut against the Seattle Mariners, Workman pitched two innings, 
gave up three runs, and struck out four. Workman remained in the Red Sox' 
bullpen for the remainder of the 2013 season, posting a 6–3 record over 
20 regular season appearances and not allowing an earned run over 7 postseason 
appearances. He pitched a perfect 8th inning in the decisive Game 6 of 
the 2013 World Series, setting up Boston closer Koji Uehara. Workman also 
recorded his first professional at-bat in Game 3 of the World Series, striking 
out on 3 consecutive pitches. On June 3, 2014, Workman was fined and suspended 
for six games after throwing a high pitch behind Evan Longoria. This incident 
followed after Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price had thrown at two Boston 
Red Sox batters in a May 30 game.[4] After losing an appeal, Workman began 
serving his suspension on June 18.[5] In April 2015, Workman was placed 
on the disabled list with elbow soreness. He underwent a PRP (platelet-rich 
plasma) injection and was ordered not to throw for several weeks. When 
that was unsuccessful, he underwent Tommy John surgery in June of 2015.
