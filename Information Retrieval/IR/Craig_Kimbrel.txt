Craig Michael Kimbrel (born May 28, 1988) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is a 
five-time All-Star, and led the National League in saves for four consecutive 
seasons from 2011 through 2014. Kimbrel played for the United States national 
team in the World Baseball Classic in 2013. As a rookie with the Atlanta 
Braves in 2011, Kimbrel was named their closer, and set an MLB record for 
saves by a rookie with 46. He was awarded the National League's 2011 Rookie 
of the Year Award.[1] On June 6, 2014, he recorded his 155th save to surpass 
John Smoltz as the Braves' all-time leader in saves. Kimbrel was traded 
to the San Diego Padres prior to the start of the 2015 season, and to the 
Red Sox before the 2016 season. He is known for the speed of his fastball, 
as well as his unique and intimidating pre-pitch stare.[2] Kimbrel attended 
Lee High School in Huntsville, Alabama, and Wallace State Community College. 
He was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 33rd round of the 2007 draft, 
but elected to remain at Wallace State in order to improve his draft position. 
He was then taken by the Braves in the third round of the 2008 draft, and 
was the 96th player chosen.[3] Kimbrel got his first call-up from the Gwinnett 
Braves on May 15, 2010, to replace the injured Jair Jurrjens on the roster.[4] 
He was called up for the second time in his career on June 4, 2010, to 
replace Takashi Saito, who was placed on the 15-day DL.[5] He earned his 
first major league save on September 19, 2010 against the New York Mets. 
Kimbrel's record for the 2010 season was 4–0, with one save and a 0.44 
ERA in 20 2⁄3 innings. He recorded 40 strikeouts and 16 walks.[3] In the 
2010 playoffs, he shut down the eventual World Champion San Francisco Giants 
on several occasions; he had 7 strikeouts in a total of 4 1⁄3 innings, 
appearing in all 4 games of the NLDS between the Giants and the Braves. 
Kimbrel made the roster to start the 2011 season as the team's primary 
closer. He was successful in his first four save opportunities before blowing 
his first career save on April 21, 2011. On June 3, 2011 in a game versus 
the New York Mets, Kimbrel passed the record for most saves by a National 
League rookie before the All-Star break.[6] He is the fastest Braves pitcher 
to reach 100 career strikeouts, doing so in 59 1⁄3 career innings. His 
new record surpassed the previous record set by John Rocker in the 1998–1999 
season, where it took Rocker 70 career innings to reach the 100 career 
strikeout mark.[7] On July 5, his 26th save matched Jonathan Papelbon's 
record for most saves by a rookie before the All-Star break.[8] On July 
7, Kimbrel's 27th save of the year against the Colorado Rockies broke Papelbon's 
record.[9] Kimbrel was selected to the 2011 All Star Game during his first 
full season in the majors. San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy choose 
Kimbrel as a replacement for Giants pitcher Matt Cain. On July 22, 2011 
in a game versus the Cincinnati Reds, Kimbrel broke the Braves rookie record 
for saves in a season (31).[10] On August 9, 2011 in a game versus the 
Florida Marlins, Kimbrel tied the National League rookie record for saves 
in a season (36 by Todd Worrell of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1986). He 
broke that record on August 17 in a game versus the San Francisco Giants. 
On August 21, 2011, Kimbrel recorded his 100th strike out which coincided 
with his 39th save of the season and a string of 30 2⁄3 innings without 
yielding a run.[11][12] On August 23, 2011, Kimbrel recorded his 40th save, 
tying the rookie save record of Neftalí Feliz. He subsequently broke this 
record with his 41st save on August 31 with two strikeouts in a game against 
the Washington Nationals. At the time, he led the majors in saves and had 
not given up a run in his last 34 innings.[13] The following night September 
1, 2011, Kimbrel surpassed Cliff Lee's record of thirty four scoreless 
innings with 34 2⁄3 scoreless innings for the longest scoreless streak 
in the majors in 2011.[14] He was named the NL Rookie of the Month and 
MLB Delivery Man of the Month for August 2011.[15][16] His scoreless inning 
streak came to an end after 38 1⁄3 innings, on September 9, 2011.[17] The 
Braves season ended when he blew a save against the Philadelphia Phillies 
in the last game of the season. The loss knocked Atlanta out of playoff 
contention, completing a late-season collapse that squandered an early-September 
lead of 8½ games.[18] Kimbrel's mediocre September (4.76 ERA)[19] led to 
charges that manager Fredi González had overworked him over the course 
of the season.[20][21] Kimbrel ended the season tied for the National League 
lead with 46 saves—shattering the previous rookie record of 40, set by 
Feliz in 2010—and led the Major Leagues with 127 strikeouts in 77 innings 
of relief.[22] On November 14, the Baseball Writers' Association of America 
announced the results of their 2011 National League Rookie of the Year 
vote; Craig Kimbrel received all 32 first-place ballots—the first unanimous 
selection since 2001 winner Albert Pujols—for 160 points. Freddie Freeman 
finished second in the voting with 21 second-place votes and seven third-place 
votes, for a total of 70 points[23]—making the pair the first team-mates 
to take the top two spots since 1989, when the Chicago Cubs' Jerome Walton 
and Dwight Smith came in first and second in the balloting.[24][25] The 
only other time two Braves finished in the top five, the organization was 
still located in Milwaukee—Gene Conley was voted third-best rookie of the 
1954 season; Hank Aaron came in fourth.[22] He was also named the Players 
Choice Awards NL Outstanding Rookie by the Major League Baseball Players 
Association.[26] Kimbrel again made the All-Star team in 2012. He struck 
out the two batters he faced.[27] He won the MLB Delivery Man Award for 
September 2012.[28] On September 26, he struck out four batters in the 
ninth inning.[citation needed] Kimbrel was thoroughly dominant throughout 
the 2012 season. He led the National League with 42 saves (in 45 opportunities) 
and Win Probability Added among pitchers. He struck out 116 batters in 
62 2⁄3 innings, producing a K/9 rate of 16.7.[29] In so doing, he also 
became the first pitcher in history to strike out at least half the batters 
he faced during a season.[30] He also went to an 0–2 count on 56% of the 
batters he faced.[31] Kimbrel allowed only 3.9 hits and 2.0 walks per 9 
innings he pitched, giving him a WHIP of 0.65 and a batting average against 
of .126. He finished with an ERA of 1.01.[29] He won the NL Rolaids Relief 
Man Award.[32] Kimbrel finished fifth in the 2012 National League Cy Young 
Award voting,[33] and eighth in the 2012 National League MVP voting.[34] 
Kimbrel began the 2013 season with three blown saves during his first nine 
save opportunities, tying his personal record for blown saves during the 
entire 2012 season.[35] Nonetheless, on May 9, 2013 in a game against the 
San Francisco Giants, Kimbrel earned his 100th save making him the second 
youngest player in MLB history to reach that mark.[36] With a save against 
the Cardinals on July 27, 2013, he became only the second Atlanta pitcher 
after John Smoltz to have three 30-save seasons.[37] Kimbrel surpassed 
John Smoltz's Braves record of 27 consecutive saves on August 17, 2013.[38] 
On September 27, Kimbrel recorded his 50th save of the season in a game 
against the Philadelphia Phillies. In doing so, he became the 11th pitcher 
in Major League history to have a 50-save season.[39] He was voted the 
"GIBBY Awards" Closer of the Year – by the fans, media, team front-office 
personnel, former players, and SABR.[40] On February 16, 2014, Kimbrel 
agreed to a four-year, $42 million extension with the Braves that runs 
through 2017, with an option for 2018.[41][42] On April 2, Kimbrel tied 
Gene Garber's 141 saves with the Braves, good for second in franchise history. 
Two days later, April 4, Kimbrel recorded his 142nd career save, to move 
into sole possession of second place. On April 25, 2014, Kimbrel became 
the fastest pitcher ever to reach 400 strikeouts—reaching the mark in 236 
innings' worth of work.[43] On June 6, 2014, Kimbrel recorded his 155th 
save in a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks, surpassing John Smoltz's 
previous record of 154 saves.[44] On August 29, 2014, Kimbrel recorded 
his 40th save of the season. He became the third pitcher to reach that 
single-season milestone in four straight seasons.[a] On April 5, 2015, 
Kimbrel was traded to the San Diego Padres along with outfielder Melvin 
Upton, Jr., in exchange for Carlos Quentin, Cameron Maybin, prospects Matt 
Wisler, Jordan Paroubeck, and the 41st overall pick in the 2015 draft.[46] 
On June 8, Kimbrel recorded his 200th career save against his former team, 
the Atlanta Braves. Kimbrel also became the fastest ever to 200 career 
saves, only taking 318 games to do so.[47][48] On November 13, 2015, the 
Padres traded Kimbrel to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Manuel Margot, 
Javier Guerra, Carlos Asuaje, and Logan Allen.[49][50] On July 8, 2016, 
Kimbrel injured his knee while taking warmups. The next day, an MRI revealed 
that there was a tear in the medial meniscus of the left knee. The injury 
required surgery, and 3-6 weeks to recover.[51] Kimbrel ended his first 
season with the Red Sox with a 3.40 ERA. Kimbrel was named the closer for 
Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Despite not surrendering one 
lead off double all year with the Braves in 2012, Kimbrel gave one up to 
Nelson Cruz of the Dominican Republic in their round two matchup. Kimbrel 
would go on to give up two runs in the game, and be the losing pitcher 
in Team USA's 3–1 loss to the eventual champions. Kimbrel uses a combination 
of a four-seam fastball and a power curveball to get outs.[52][53] His 
fastball averages 96–97 mph and occasionally tops out at 101 mph.[54] His 
curve, thrown with a "spike" grip, stays in the mid-to-upper 80s. The whiff 
rate of his four-seamer is 33%, and the curve at is 52%.[55] This combination 
contributes to a strikeouts per nine innings rate of 14.61 over Kimbrel's 
career so far (as of 22 July 2015[update]).[56] He is also tied for third 
among all pitchers from 2002–2012 in the highest percentage of pitches 
that resulted in swinging strikes.[57] Kimbrel's four-seam fastball was 
the 12th-fastest among Major League relievers in the 2011 season. In addition, 
he threw the hardest curveball, averaging 87 mph. His fastball had the 
fifth-highest whiff rate among relief pitchers' fastballs (32%), and he 
also had the highest whiff rate of any reliever's curveball, at better 
than 55%.[58] His pre-pitch stance has also been widely recognized, and 
has been dubbed "Kimbreling", or "Spider Arms".[2][59] Kimbrel's parents, 
Mike and Sandy,[60] have two other sons, Alan and Matt.[61] He proposed 
to Ashley Holt in May 2012;[62] the two were married in December that year.[63][64]
