Ralph Emanuel Rowe (July 14, 1924 – February 29, 1996) was an American 
outfielder and manager in minor league baseball, and a coach at the Major 
League level. A native of Newberry, South Carolina, Rowe threw right-handed, 
batted left-handed, stood 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall and weighed 175 
pounds (79 kg). He was signed at age 17 by the Cleveland Indians after 
graduating from Newberry High School in 1942. In 1958, he played for the 
Charlotte Hornets, a Washington Senators affiliate, and moved his family 
to Charlotte, where they lived until 1974. While living in Charlotte, he 
was a player-coach for the Hornets in 1961, and managed the 1969 Hornets 
to the Double-A Southern League championship. He lived in Newberry from 
1974 until his death in 1996 at age 71. Rowe's professional career got 
off to a rousing start in 1942, when he batted .357 for the Thomasville 
Hi-Toms, a Cleveland affiliate in the Class D North Carolina State League. 
But he lost the next four full seasons (1943–46) to military service and, 
despite batting .360 and leading the 1948 Class B Tri-State League in runs 
batted in (123), he spent most of his playing career at the Double-A level. 
Rowe's career reached its apex with a 14-game trial with the Los Angeles 
Angels of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1949. He played in the farm 
systems of the Indians, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox and the Senators 
through 1958, then became a manager in the Washington/Minnesota Twins farm 
system in 1959–71, winning four league championships. His overall record 
was 836–757 (.525). He finally reached the Major Leagues as a coach, serving 
for four seasons with the Twins (1972–75) as their third base coach, and 
four more (1981–84) as the batting coach of the Baltimore Orioles. He was 
a member of the Orioles' staff during their 1983 world championship season. 
Rowe also served as a roving minor league batting coach for the Twins,
