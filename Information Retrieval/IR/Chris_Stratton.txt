Christopher Lee Stratton (born August 22, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). Stratton attended Mississippi State University from 2010 to 2012. 
As a senior he was a consensus All-American after going 11â€“2 with a 2.38 
earned run average and 127 strikeouts.[1] He was also the SEC Pitcher of 
the Year.[2] Stratton was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first 
round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft.[3] In August, he was hospitalized 
after a line drive struck him in the head.[4] Before the 2013 season, Baseball 
America ranked Stratton as the Giants' third best prospect.[5] The Giants 
added him to their 40-man roster after the 2015 season.[6] Stratton was 
called up from the Sacramento River Cats (AAA-Pacific Coast League) to 
the majors on May 28, 2016, to replace the injured Matt Cain.[7] Despite 
being primarily a starter in the minors, the Giants added Stratton to their 
bullpen and he made his major league debut against the Atlanta Braves on 
May 30, pitching a scoreless bottom of the eighth inning and recording 
two strikeouts while retiring all three batters he faced.[8] On June 11, 
he was credited with his first major league as he pitched the top of the 
10th inning in the Giants victory against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[9] On 
June 13 he was sent down again when Cain returned from the DL,[10] but 
was recalled from the minors the following day when Cain was put back on 
the DL with a reinjured hamstring.[11] Stratton pitched in seven games 
for the Giants with a 1-0 record and a 3.60 ERA. He compiled a 12-6 record
