Mark Patrick Wegner (born March 4, 1972) is a Major League Baseball umpire. 
He worked in the National League from 1998 to 1999, and throughout both 
major leagues since 2000. Wegner has umpired in seven Division Series (2003, 
2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013), three League Championship Series (2007, 
2014, 2015), and two World Baseball Classics (2009, 2013). He also officiated 
in the 2008 All-Star Game, the 2014 National League Wild Card Game, and 
the 2013 World Series. Wegner wears uniform number 14, and previously wore 
uniform number 47. On June 2, 2007, Wegner was involved in a heated argument 
with Chicago Cubs manager Lou Piniella. After Wegner ruled that Ángel Pagán 
was out at third on an attempted steal, Piniella, who later acknowledged 
the call was correct, stormed out of the dugout, threw his hat down, and 
started kicking dirt on Wegner. Piniella would be ejected and given a four-game 
suspension and he later apologized to Wegner.[1] In 2012, following Wegner's 
ejection of Chicago White Sox rookie pitcher José Quintana for throwing 
a pitch behind Ben Zobrist and White Sox manager Robin Ventura’s ejection 
for arguing the call, Chicago announcer Ken "Hawk" Harrelson lashed out 
Wegner on the air, saying: "I'll tell you what, they have got to start 
making guys be accountable. That is totally absurd. Here's an umpire in 
the American League that knows nothing about the game of baseball. They 
have got to do something about this. They have got some guys in this league 
that have no business umpiring. They have no business umpiring because 
they don't know what the game of baseball is about." On June 28, 2007, 
Wegner was behind the plate when Toronto Blue Jay Frank Thomas hit his 
500th career home run off Minnesota Twins pitcher Carlos Silva. Later in 
the game, Thomas was ejected by Wegner for arguing balls and strikes. Toronto 
manager John Gibbons was thrown out of the game as well.[2] Wegner worked 
his first career no-hitter on July 13, 2013, calling balls and strikes 
for Tim Lincecum's 148-pitch performance against the San Diego Padres. 
Replays indicate Wegner called Lincecum to the tune of 97.9% accuracy, 
missing just two pitches.[3] A Catholic known for his charity work,[4] 
Wegner has been involved in church activities and BLUE for kids, a charity 
founded by fellow MLB umpires Mike DiMuro and Marvin Hudson. At 5'8" tall, 
Wegner and Jerry Meals are the shortest umpires in Major League Baseball.
