Bolton (i/ˈbɒltən/ or locally [ˈbɜʏtn̩][2]) is a town in Greater Manchester 
in North West England. A former mill town, Bolton has been a production 
centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th 
century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition. The urbanisation 
and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of 
textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Bolton was a 19th-century 
boomtown, and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching 
and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres 
of cotton spinning in the world. The British cotton industry declined sharply 
after the First World War, and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually 
ceased in Bolton. Close to the West Pennine Moors, Bolton is 10 miles (16 km) 
northwest of Manchester. It is surrounded by several smaller towns and 
villages that together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, of which 
Bolton is the administrative centre. The town of Bolton has a population 
of 139,403, whilst the wider metropolitan borough has a population of 262,400. 
Historically part of Lancashire, Bolton originated as a small settlement 
in the moorland known as Bolton le Moors. In the English Civil War, the 
town was a Parliamentarian outpost in a staunchly Royalist region, and 
as a result was stormed by 3,000 Royalist troops led by Prince Rupert of 
the Rhine in 1644. In what became known as the Bolton Massacre, 1,600 residents 
were killed and 700 were taken prisoner. Football club Bolton Wanderers 
play home games at the Macron Stadium and the WBA World light-welterweight 
champion Amir Khan was born in the town. Cultural interests include the 
Octagon Theatre and the Bolton Museum and Art Gallery, as well as one of 
the earliest public libraries established after the Public Libraries Act 
1850. Bolton is a common Northern English name derived from the Old English 
bothl-tun, meaning a settlement with a dwelling.[3][4] The first recorded 
use of the name, in the form Boelton, dates from 1185 to describe Bolton 
le Moors, though this may not be in relation to a dwelling.[5] It was recorded 
as Bothelton in 1212, Botelton in 1257, Boulton in 1288, and Bolton after 
1307.[6] Later forms of Botheltun were Bodeltown, Botheltun-le-Moors, Bowelton, 
Boltune, Bolton-super-Moras, Bolton-in-ye-Moors, Bolton-le-Moors.[7] The 
town's motto of Supera Moras means "overcome difficulties" (or "delays"), 
and is a pun on the Bolton-super-Moras version of the name meaning literally, 
"Bolton on the moors".[8] There is evidence of human existence on the moors 
around Bolton since the early part of the Bronze Age, including a stone 
circle on Cheetham Close above Egerton,[9] and Bronze Age burial mounds 
on Winter Hill.[10] A Bronze Age mound was excavated in Victorian times 
outside Haulgh Hall. The Romans built roads from Manchester to Ribchester 
to the east and a road along what is now the A6 to the west. It is claimed 
that Agricola built a fort at Blackrod by clearing land above the forest. 
Evidence of a Saxon settlement exists in the form of religious objects 
found when the Victorian parish church was built.[11] In 1067 Great Bolton 
was the property of Roger de Poitou and after 1100, of Roger de Meresheys. 
It became the property of the Pilkingtons who forfeited it in the Civil 
War and after that the Stanleys who became Earls of Derby.[12] Great Bolton 
and Little Bolton were part of the Marsey fee, in 1212 Little Bolton was 
held by Roger de Bolton as plough-land, by the service of the twelfth part 
of a knight's fee to Randle de Marsey.[13] The parish church in Bolton 
has an early foundation although the exact date is unknown; it was given 
by the lord of the manor to the Gilbertine canons of Mattersey Priory in 
Nottinghamshire, founded by Roger de Marsey.[14] A charter to hold a market 
in Churchgate was granted on 14 December 1251 by King Henry III of England.[15] 
Bolton became a market town and borough by a charter from the Earl of Derby, 
William de Ferrers, on 14 January 1253, and a market was held until the 
18th century. Burgage plots were laid out on Churchgate and Deansgate in 
the centre of the medieval town close to where Ye Olde Man & Scythe public 
house, dating from 1251, is situated today.[16] In 1337 Flemish weavers 
settled and introduced the manufacture of woollen cloth.[17] More Flemish 
weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. 
The second wave of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of linen and 
cotton.[18] Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374.[6] There was an outbreak 
of the plague in the town in 1623.[6] During the English Civil War, the 
people of Bolton were Puritans and supported the Parliamentarian cause.[14] 
A parliamentary garrison in the town was attacked twice without success 
but on 28 May 1644 Prince Rupert's Royalist army with troops under the 
command of the Earl of Derby attacked again. The attack became known as 
the Bolton Massacre in which 1,500 died, 700 were taken prisoner and the 
town plundered.[18] At the end of the Civil War Lord Derby was tried as 
a traitor at Chester and condemned to death. When his appeal for pardon 
to parliament was rejected he attempted to escape but was recaptured and 
executed for his part in the massacre outside Ye Olde Man & Scythe Inn 
at Bolton on 15 October 1651.[6] A tradition of cottage spinning and weaving 
and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors, Richard Arkwright 
and Samuel Crompton, led to rapid growth of the textile industry in the 
19th century. Crompton, whilst living at Hall i' th' Wood, invented the 
spinning mule in 1779. Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the 
River Croal provided the water necessary for bleach works that were a feature 
of this area.[19] Bleaching using chlorine was introduced in the 1790s 
by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks. Bolton and the surrounding 
villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach 
Works in the Irwell Valley.[20] The mule revolutionised cotton spinning 
by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright's water frame with the carriage 
drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves's spinning jenny, 
producing a high quality yarn. Self-acting mules were used in Bolton mills 
until the 1960s producing fine yarn.[20] The earliest mills were situated 
by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge, but steam power led to the 
construction of the large multi-storey mills and their chimneys that dominated 
Bolton's skyline, some of which survive today.[18] Growth of the textile 
industry was assisted by the availability of coal in the area. By 1896 
John Fletcher had coal mines at Ladyshore in Little Lever; The Earl of 
Bradford had a coal mine at Great Lever; the Darcy Lever Coal Company had 
mines at Darcy Lever and there were also coal mines at Tonge, Breightmet, 
Deane and Doffcocker. Some of these pits were close to the Manchester Bolton 
& Bury Canal providing the owners with markets in Bolton and Manchester.[21] 
Coal mining declined in the 20th century. Important transport links contributed 
to the growth of the town and the textile industry; the Manchester Bolton 
& Bury Canal[18] constructed in 1791, connected the town to Bury and Manchester 
providing transport for coal and other basic materials. The Bolton and 
Leigh Railway was the oldest in Lancashire, opening to goods traffic in 
1828 and Great Moor Street station opened to passengers in 1831. The railway 
initially connected Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Leigh, an 
important link with the port of Liverpool for the import of raw cotton 
from America, but was extended in 1829 to link up with the Manchester to 
Liverpool Line.[18] Local firms built locomotives for the railway, in 1830 
"Union" was built by Rothwell, Hick and Co. and two locomotives, "Salamander" 
and "Veteran" were built by Crook and Dean.[22] Bolton's first Mayor, Charles 
James Darbishire was sympathetic to Chartism and a supporter of the Anti-Corn 
Law League. In August 1839 Bolton was besieged by Chartist rioters and 
the Riot Act was read and special constables sworn in. The mayor accompanied 
soldiers called to rescue special constables at Little Bolton Town Hall, 
which was besieged by a mob, and the incident ended without bloodshed.[23] 
By 1900 Bolton was Lancashire's third largest engineering centre after 
Manchester and Oldham. About 9,000 men were employed in the industry, half 
of them working for Dobson and Barlow in Kay Street. The firm made textile 
machinery.[24] Another engineering company Hick, Hargreaves & Co based 
at the Soho Foundry made Lancashire boilers and heavy machinery.[25] Thomas 
Ryder and Son of Turner Bridge manufactured machine tools for the international 
motor industry. Wrought iron was produced for more than 100 years at Thomas 
Walmsley and Sons' Atlas Forge.[26] By 1911 the textile industry in Bolton 
employed about 36,000 people. The last mill to be constructed was Sir John 
Holden's Mill in 1927.[27] The cotton industry declined from the 1920s. 
A brief upturn after the Second World War was not sustained, and the industry 
had virtually vanished by the end of the 20th century. During the night 
of 26 September 1916, Bolton was the target for an aerial offensive. L21, 
a Zeppelin commanded by Oberleutnant Kurt Frankenburg of the Imperial German 
Navy, dropped twenty-one bombs on the town, five of them on the working 
class area of Kirk Street, killing thirteen residents and destroying six 
houses. Further attacks followed on other parts of the town, including 
three incendaries dropped close to the Town Hall.[28][29] In 1899 William 
Lever, Lord Leverhulme, bought Hall i'th' Wood as a memorial to Samuel 
Crompton inventor of the spinning mule. Lever restored the dilapidated 
building and presented it to the town in 1902, having turned it into a 
museum furnished with household goods typical of domestic family life in 
the 16th and 17th centuries. Lever re-endowed Bolton Schools, giving land 
and his house on Chorley New Road. He presented the town with 67 acres 
(270,000 m2) of land for a public park which the corporation named Leverhulme 
Park in 1914.[30] In 1902 he gave the people of Bolton Lever Park at Rivington. 
In 1911, Lever consulted Thomas Mawson, landscape architect and lecturer 
in Landscape Design at the University of Liverpool, regarding town planning 
in Bolton. Mawson published "Bolton – a Study in Town Planning and Civic 
Art" and gave lectures entitled "Bolton Housing and Town Planning Society" 
which formed the basis of an illustrated book "Bolton – as it is and as 
it might be". In 1924, Leverhulme presented Bolton Council with an ambitious 
plan to rebuild the town centre based on Mawson's designs funded partly 
by himself. The council declined in favour of extending the town hall and 
building the civic centre.[31] Lying within the county boundaries of Lancashire, 
until the early 19th century, Great Bolton and Little Bolton were two of 
the eighteen townships of the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors.[32][33] 
These townships were separated by the River Croal, Little Bolton on the 
north bank and Great Bolton on the south.[6][13][14] Bolton Poor Law Union 
was formed on 1 February 1837. It continued using existing poorhouses at 
Fletcher Street and Turton but in 1856 started to build a new workhouse 
at Fishpool Farm in Farnworth. Townleys Hospital was built on the site 
which is now Royal Bolton Hospital.[34] In 1838 Great Bolton, most of Little 
Bolton and the Haulgh area of Tonge with Haulgh were incorporated under 
the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as a municipal borough, the second 
to be created in England. Further additions were made adding part of Rumworth 
in 1872 and part of Halliwell in 1877.[35][36] In 1889 Bolton was granted 
County Borough status and became self-governing and independent from Lancashire 
County Council jurisdiction. In 1898, the borough was extended further 
by adding the civil parishes of Breightmet, Darcy Lever, Great Lever, the 
rest of Halliwell, Heaton, Lostock, Middle Hulton, the rest of Rumworth 
which had been renamed Deane in 1894, Smithills, and Tonge plus Astley 
Bridge Urban District, and part of Over Hulton civil parish.[35][36] The 
County Borough of Bolton was abolished in 1974 and became a constituent 
part of the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester.[35][36] 
Bolton unsuccessfully applied for city status in 2011.[37][38] Bolton Metropolitan 
Borough Council is divided into twenty wards, each of which elects three 
councillors for a term of up to four years. As of 2014 there are forty 
Labour councillors, sixteen Conservatives and three Liberal Democrats, 
with one seat remaining vacant.[39] Under the Reform Act of 1832, a Parliamentary 
Borough was established. The Bolton constituency was represented by two 
Members of Parliament.[40] The Parliamentary Borough continued until 1950 
when it was abolished and replaced with two parliamentary constituencies, 
Bolton East and Bolton West, each with one Member of Parliament.[40] In 
1983 Bolton East was abolished and two new constituencies were created, 
Bolton North East, and Bolton South East covering most of the former Farnworth 
constituency. At the same time major boundary changes also took place to 
Bolton West, which took over most of the former Westhoughton constituency.[40][41] 
Under the town twinning scheme the local council have twinned Bolton with 
Le Mans in France, since 1967,[42][43] and Paderborn in Germany, since 
1975.[42] Bolton is a town in Greater Manchester, in the North West of 
England.[35] Close to the West Pennine Moors, it is 10 miles (16 km) northwest 
of the city of Manchester and surrounded by several smaller towns and villages 
which together form the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, of which Bolton 
is the administrative centre. The early name, Bolton le Moors, described 
the position of the town amid the low hills on the edge of the West Pennine 
Moors southeast of Rivington Pike (456 m). Bolton lies on relatively flat 
land on both sides of the clough or steep-banked valley through which the 
River Croal flows in a southeasterly direction towards the River Irwell.[6] 
The geological formation around Bolton consists of sandstones of the Carboniferous 
series and Coal Measures; in the northern part of Bolton the lower Coal 
Measures are mixed with underlying Millstone Grit.[14] Climate in the Greater 
Manchester area is generally similar to the climate of England, although 
owing to protection from the mountains in North Wales it experiences slightly 
lower than average rainfall except during the summer months, when rainfall 
is higher than average.[44] Bolton has mild differences between highs and 
lows, and there is adequate rainfall year round. The Köppen Climate Classification 
subtype for this climate is "Cfb" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).[45][46] 
At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, according to the Office 
for National Statistics, the Urban Subdivision of Bolton[49] was part of 
the Greater Manchester Urban Area and had a total resident population of 
139,403, of which 67,823 (48.7%) were male and 71,580 (51.3%) were female,[50] 
living in 57,827 households.[51] The settlement occupied 4,446 hectares 
(17.17 sq mi), compared with 2,992 hectares (11.55 sq mi) in the 1991 census, 
though it should be noted that the 2001 Urban census area contains a large 
rural area to the south of the town. Its population density was 31.35 people 
per hectare compared with an average of 40.20 across the Greater Manchester 
Urban Area.[50] The median age of the population was 35, compared with 
36 within the Greater Manchester Urban Area and 37 across England and Wales.[52] 
The majority of the population of Bolton were born in England (87.10%); 
2.05% were born elsewhere within the United Kingdom, 1.45% within the rest 
of the European Union, and 9.38% elsewhere in the world.[53] Data on religious 
beliefs across the town in the 2001 census show that 67.9% declared themselves 
to be Christian, 12.5% stated that they were Muslim, 8.6% said they held 
no religion, and 3.4% reported themselves as Hindu.[54] At the time of 
the 2001 Census, there were 56,390 people in employment who were resident 
within Bolton. Of these, 21.13% worked in the wholesale and retail trade, 
including repair of motor vehicles; 18.71% worked within manufacturing 
industry; 11.00% worked within the health and social work sector and 6.81% 
were employed in the transport, storage and communication industries.[61] 
In the last quarter of the 20th century heavy industry was replaced by 
service-based activities including data processing, call centres, hi-tech 
electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries 
employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, 
steel foundries and building materials. Missiles were produced at the British 
Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand's European 
headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also the home 
of the family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. 
On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.[62] Bolton 
attracts visitors to its shopping centres, markets, public houses, restaurants 
and cafes in the town centre as well retail parks and leisure facilities 
close to the town centre and in the surrounding towns and suburbs.[63][64] 
Tourism plays a part in the economy, visitor attractions include Hall i' 
th' Wood, Smithills Hall and Country Park, Last Drop Village, Barrow Bridge 
and the Bolton Steam Museum.[65][66] There are several regeneration projects 
planned for Bolton over the next ten years, including Church Wharf by Ask 
Developments and Bluemantle[67] and Merchant's Quarter by local developer 
Charles Topham group, which together will contribute 1,000,000 square feet 
(93,000 m2) of business space.[68] The Bolton Innovation Zone is a large 
£300 million development with the University of Bolton at its core. Situated 
in the town centre on the site of a former market is the Grade II* listed 
town hall, an imposing neoclassical building designed by William Hill and 
opened in June 1873 by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.[16] In the 1930s 
the building was extended by Bradshaw Gass & Hope.[16][69] Within the Town 
Hall are the Albert Halls and several function rooms. The original, single 
Albert Hall was destroyed by fire on 14 November 1981. After rebuilding 
work, it was replaced by the present Albert Halls, which were opened in 
1985.[69] The Great Hall of Smithills Hall was built in the 14th century 
when William de Radcliffe received the Manor of Smithills from the Hultons, 
the chapel dates from the 16th century and was extended during the 19th. 
Smithills Hall was where, in 1555, George Marsh was tried for heresy during 
the Marian Persecutions. After being "examined" at Smithills, according 
to local tradition, George Marsh stamped his foot so hard to re-affirm 
his faith, that a footprint was left in the stone floor. It is a Grade 
I listed building and is now a museum.[70][71] Hall i' th' Wood, now a 
museum, is a late mediaeval yeoman farmer's house built by Laurence Brownlow. 
Around 1637 it was owned by the Norris family, who added the stone west 
wing. In the 18th century it was divided up into tenements. Samuel Crompton 
lived and worked there. In the 19th century it deteriorated further until 
in 1895 it was bought by industrialist William Hesketh Lever, who restored 
it and presented it to Bolton Council in 1900.[72] Bolton's 26 conservation 
areas contain 700 listed buildings, many of which are in the town centre, 
and there is parkland including the Victorian Queen's Park, Leverhulme 
Park and other open spaces in the surrounding area.[73][74] These include 
Le Mans Crescent, Ye Olde Man & Scythe, Little Bolton Town Hall, the Market 
Place, Wood Street and Holy Trinity Church. The Market Hall of 1854 is 
a Grade II listed building.[75] Outside the town centre can be found Mere 
Hall, Firwood Fold, Haulgh Hall, Park Cottage, St Mary's Church, Deane, 
Lostock Hall Gatehouse and All Souls Church. Notable mills still overlooking 
parts of the town are Sir John Holden's Mill[76] and Swan Lane Mills.[77] 
Most views northwards are dominated by Rivington Pike and the Winter Hill 
TV Mast on the West Pennine Moors above the town.[78] Bolton is well served 
by the local road network and national routes. The A6, a major north–south 
trunk road, passes to the west through Hunger Hill and Westhoughton. The 
A666 dual carriageway (sometimes referred to as the Devil's Highway because 
of its numeric designation), is a spur from the M61/M60 motorway interchange 
through the town centre to Astley Bridge, Egerton, Darwen and Blackburn. 
The M61 has three dedicated junctions serving the borough. A network of 
local buses coordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester serves the 
Bolton district and beyond;[79] bus operators include Arriva North West, 
First Greater Manchester, Diamond Bus North West and Maytree Travel. Bolton 
is also served by the National Express coach network. The bus station on 
Moor Lane is scheduled to be replaced by a new interchange in the town 
centre next to the railway station by the end of 2014, at a cost of £48 
million.[80] Bolton Interchange is located on the Manchester loop of the 
West Coast Mainline which was served by Virgin West Coast trains passing 
through Manchester Piccadilly station. Managed by Northern, the station 
is part of a town-centre transport interchange with services to Manchester, 
Wigan, Southport, Blackburn and intermediate stations operated by TransPennine 
Express and Northern trains.[81][82] Bolton School, an independent day 
school, was founded on a site next to the parish church in 1524 as a grammar 
school for boys; it merged around 1656 with a free grammar school that 
had been founded shortly after 1641.[83][84][85] In 1898, it moved to its 
present site in Chorley New Road, and in 1913 merged with Bolton Girls' 
Day School.[86] In 1855 the Bolton Church Institute was founded by Canon 
James Slade near to the parish church. The school became Canon Slade School, 
which has since relocated to Bradshaw.[87] The town's other secondary schools 
include Bolton St Catherine's Academy, Ladybridge High School, Sharples 
School, Smithills School, Thornleigh Salesian College and UTC Bolton. Bolton 
College provides further education from sites throughout the borough.[88] 
Bolton Sixth Form College comprises the Town Centre Campus and Farnworth 
Campus.[89] The Bolton TIC (Technical Innovation Centre), opened in 2006, 
supports local schools by providing additional technical training.[90] 
The University of Bolton, formerly the Bolton Institute of Higher Education, 
gained university status in 2005.[91] There is evidence from Saxon times 
of Christian churches and at the time of the Civil War a Puritan and nonconformist 
presence in the town. The Unitarians were among the early dissenting congregations 
which eventually included Methodists, Baptists, Seventh Day Adventist and 
other denominations. More than forty churches were built during the Victorian 
era, but some have now been closed, demolished or converted to other uses.[93][94] 
Today, the parish of Bolton-le-Moors covers a small area in the town centre,[95] 
but until the 19th century it covered a much larger area, divided into 
eighteen chapelries and townships.[14][96] The neighbouring ancient parish 
of Deane centred around St Mary's Church once covered a large area to the 
west and south of Bolton,[97] and the township of Great Lever was part 
of the ancient parish of Middleton.[96] The Church of St Peter, commonly 
known as Bolton Parish Church, is an example of the gothic revival style. 
Built between 1866 and 1871 of Longridge stone to designs by Paley, the 
church is 67 ft (20.4 m) in width, 156 ft (47.5 m) in length, and 82 ft 
(25.0 m) in height. The tower is 180 ft (54.9 m) high with 13 bells.[11] 
The first church on the same site was built in Anglo-Saxon times. It was 
rebuilt in Norman times and again in the early 15th century. Little is 
known of the first two earlier churches, but the third building was a solid, 
squat building with a sturdy square tower at the west end. It was modified 
over the years until it fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1866.[14] 
Fragments of stone and other artefacts from these first three buildings 
are displayed in the museum corner of the present church.[11] St Mary's 
Deane, once the only church in a parish of ten townships in the hundred 
of Salford, is a church established in Saxon times. The current building 
dates from 1250 with extensions and restoration in the 19th century and 
is a Grade II* listed building.[98] St George's Church was built between 
1794 and 1796 when Little Bolton was a separate township. Built by Peter 
Rothwell and paid for by the Ainsworth family.[99] in 1975 it was leased 
to Bolton Council, and became a craft centre in 1994.[100] St Patrick's 
Roman Catholic Church on Great Moor Street,was built in 1861.[101] The 
New Zakaria Mosque, the first mosque in Bolton, served the Muslim community 
from Pakistan and India from the 1960s. The first place of worship for 
Hindus was in the former St Barnabus Church, converted into a Hindu temple.[93] 
Bolton Wanderers F.C. is an English Football League club which was formed 
in 1874 and for 102 years played at Burnden Park. The club moved to the 
Reebok Stadium in Horwich in 1997. The club has won four FA Cups, the most 
recent in 1958, and spent 73 seasons in the top division of the English 
league – more than any club never to have been league champions.[102] Bolton 
Hockey Club fields women's men's and junior teams and has more than 120 
playing members.[103] The town has two local cricket leagues, the Bolton 
Cricket League,[104] and the Bolton Cricket Association.[105] Bolton also 
has a rugby union club, Bolton RUFC formed in 1872 situated on Avenue Street. 
The club operates four senior teams, as well as women's and junior sections.[106] 
Bolton Robots of Doom is a baseball club started in 2003, playing home 
games at Stapleton Avenue. In addition to the adult team there is a junior 
team, Bolton Bears. Baseball in Bolton dates back to 1938 with a team called 
Bolton Scarlets.[107] An American football team, the Bolton Bulldogs, plays 
home games at Smithills School operating varsity and junior varsity teams.[108] 
Speedway racing, known as Dirt Track Racing, was staged at Raikes Park 
in the pioneering days of 1928, but the speedway was short-lived.[109] 
Greyhound racing took place at the Raikes Park Greyhound Stadium from 1927 
until 1996.[110] According to a survey of the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science Boltonians are the friendliest people in Britain.[111] 
Humphrey Spender photographed Bolton calling it Worktown for the Mass-Observation 
Project, a social research organisation which aimed to record everyday 
life in Britain. His photographs provide a record of ordinary people living 
and working in a British pre-War industrial town.[112] Bolton has several 
theatres including the Octagon and independent groups such as Bolton Little 
Theatre and the Phoenix Theatre Company. Inside the Town Hall there is 
a theatre and conference complex, the Albert Halls. Le Mans Crescent, home 
to the central library, museum, art gallery, aquarium, magistrates' court 
and town hall, is to be the centre of a new Cultural Quarter. The library 
and museum are to be extended into the area now occupied by the Magistrates 
Court. Bolton Museum and Art Gallery houses a collection of local and international 
art, including work by the Bolton-born American artist Thomas Moran.[113]Bolton 
Steam Museum houses a variety of preserved steam engines in part of the 
old Atlas Mill.[114] Bolton Central Library was one of the earliest public 
libraries established after the Public Libraries Act 1850, opening in October 
1853 in the Exchange Building on the old market square (Victoria Square) 
before moving to Le Mans Crescent in July 1938.[115] The Bolton Symphony 
Orchestra performs regular concerts at the Albert Halls and Victoria Hall 
in the town centre.[116] The 2008 BBC Radio 3 Adult Choir of the Year[117] 
and five times gold-medal winning barbershop chorus The Cottontown Chorus 
is based in Bolton.[118] The town's daily newspaper is The Bolton News, 
formerly the Bolton Evening News. There is a weekly free paper, the Bolton 
Journal and Bolton Council's monthly newspaper, Bolton Scene. The town 
is part of the BBC North West and ITV Granada television regions, served 
by the Winter Hill transmitter near Belmont. Local radio is provided by 
Tower FM, which broadcasts across Bolton and Bury; Bolton FM began broadcasting 
in 2009.[119] The fictional village of Newbank in Benjamin Disraeli's novel 
Coningsby was based in part on the industrial village of Barrow Bridge.[120] 
Spring and Port Wine by playwright, Bill Naughton was filmed and set in
