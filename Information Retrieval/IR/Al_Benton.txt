John Alton Benton (March 18, 1911 – April 14, 1968) was a Major League 
Baseball right-handed pitcher who played with the Philadelphia Athletics, 
Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indians, and Boston Red Sox. Benton was born 
in Noble, Oklahoma, a small town a few miles south of Norman, Oklahoma. 
In 1940, Benton led the American League with 17 saves. In 1941 he went 
15–6 with a 2.97 earned run average (ERA) (second in the American League 
(AL)) in 38 games. He completed seven of 14 starts and got seven saves. 
Despite his 7–13 mark a year later, his ERA was 2.90 with career-highs 
in starts (30) and innings pitched (226 2⁄3). Benton was chosen for the 
AL All-Star team in both 1941 and 1942, and then missed the 1943 and 1944 
seasons while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Benton was 
discharged from the Navy in November 1944 and had his best year in 1945. 
He compiled a record of 13–8, a career-low 2.02 ERA, five shutouts, and 
12 complete games in 191 2⁄3 innings. In a remarkable testament to the 
Tigers pitching in 1945, Hal Newhouser and Benton were No. 1 and No. 2 
in ERA among AL pitchers. Newhouser's Adjusted ERA+ in 1945 was 195 and 
Benton's was 175. The Adjusted ERA+ figures posted by Newhouser and Benton 
in 1945 rank as the first and fifth best seasons all time for a Detroit 
Tigers pitcher with at least 150 innings pitched. Benton pitched in relief 
in three games in the 1945 World Series and gave up only one earned run 
for a 1.93 World Series ERA. The rest of his career he worked largely as 
a setup man or as an emergency starter. A two-time All-Star (1941–42), 
Benton compiled a career 98–88 record with 697 strikeouts and a 3.36 ERA 
in 1688 1⁄3 innings. He died in a 1968 motel explosion in Lynwood, California, 
at the age of 57. Benton is known for being the only pitcher to face both 
Babe Ruth (in 1934) and Mickey Mantle (in 1952)[1] (Bobo Newsom was also 
active – but never actually faced Mantle). Benton is also the only player 
to have two sacrifice bunts in the same inning, against the Cleveland Indians
