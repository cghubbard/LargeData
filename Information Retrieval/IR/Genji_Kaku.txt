Genji Kaku/Yuen-chih Kuo (Kaku Genji/Kuo Yuen-chih, 郭 源治, born October 
4, 1956), is a Taiwanese former professional baseball player from Taitung, 
Taiwan. His family comes from the Taiwanese aborigines. He obtained Japanese 
citizenship in September, 1989, and holds dual Japanese/ROC citizenships 
since 1999. While in Japan, he often uses the Japanese name, 佳久 源治. Kaku 
first traveled to Japan in 1969 as part of the Taiwanese little league 
team, where his team won the little league championship. Kaku finished 
his military service in Republic of China, and joined the Chunichi Dragons 
in mid-1981. He was not regarded as a star player at that time, and arrived 
in Japan with only about 3000 yen (roughly $30) in his pocket. His sharp 
fastball (hit 94 mph) and breaking pitches quickly earned him a spot on 
the starting rotation, and he won over 10 games from 1983 to 1986. However, 
he also lost over 10 games each of these seasons due to poor run support. 
In 1987, Dragons closer Kazuhiko Ushijima was traded to the Lotte Marines 
for Hiromitsu Ochiai, and manager Senichi Hoshino chose Kaku as the new 
closer. Kaku was a huge success in the closing role, using his solid control 
and hard screwball to lead the Central League in saves in 1987 and 1988. 
The Dragons won the league championship in 1988, and Kaku received the 
league MVP award despite having to return to Taiwan during the season to 
mourn for his younger brother, who had died in a car accident. Kaku obtained 
Japanese citizenship in 1989, and currently has a Japanese wife. He returned 
to the starting rotation in 1990, winning 13 games in 1991. He became a 
reliever in 1993, and became the fifth Japanese player in history to record 
100 wins and 100 saves in 1994. He also led the league with a 2.45 ERA 
that year. He played his final season in Japan in 1996. Kaku played in 
the Chinese Professional Baseball League from 1997 to 1998,. He also participated 
in the preliminary rounds of the 2000 Summer Olympics with the Taiwanese 
national team in 1999 at the age of 42. After retiring from baseball, he 
opened a restaurant in Naka-ku, Nagoya. Kaku's jersey number (33) is a 
retired number for the Chinese Taipei national baseball team. He has been 
serving as the head consultant for the Chinese Professional Baseball League
