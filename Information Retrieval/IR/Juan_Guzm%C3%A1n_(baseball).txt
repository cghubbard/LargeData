Juan Andres Guzmán Correa (born October 28, 1966 in Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic) is a former pitcher in Major League Baseball. Guzman spent much 
of his playing career with the Toronto Blue Jays and was part of their 
World Series winning teams in 1992 and 1993. Guzmán was originally signed 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1985. He pitched 
for the Blue Jays from 1991 to 1998 and briefly played for the Baltimore 
Orioles, Cincinnati Reds, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays after leaving Toronto, 
with a career ERA of 4.08. In his first three seasons with the Blue Jays, 
he went a combined 40–11 with a 3.28 ERA, and the team made the playoffs 
all three years, including World Series wins in 1992 and 1993. Guzman won 
two games in both the 1992 and 1993 ALCS but was not able to secure a win 
in either World Series. His playoff record was 5–1 in eight starts with 
a 2.44 ERA. Guzman had an ERA of 2.93 in 1996, which was the lowest in 
the American League among qualified pitchers. Guzman possessed a very good 
fastball and strikeout ability, striking out 7.5 batters per nine innings 
during his career. On the mound, he worked very deliberately and was one 
of the slower working pitchers in the game, earning him the nickname "Human 
Rain Delay" from Toronto fans. He led the American league in wild pitches
