Jeff Luhnow is the current general manager of the Houston Astros, serving 
in the role since December 2011. He worked for the St. Louis Cardinals 
in their scouting department from 2003 through 2011. Prior to working in 
baseball, Luhnow was a business entrepreneur. News of an FBI investigation 
into potential Cardinal front office personnel hacking into the Astros' 
baseball operations datebases broke on June 16, 2015. According to reports 
at least some Cardinals employees were concerned that Luhnow might have 
taken some proprietary information with him from St. Louis, although that 
claim turned out to be false.[1] Luhnow was born and raised in Mexico City 
after his father, an American advertising executive from New York, had 
relocated his family there.[2][3] He is fluent in Spanish.[2] He graduated 
from the Webb School of California[4] and holds dual Bachelor of Science 
degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in economics and engineering.[5] 
He would eventually earn an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at 
Northwestern University.[6] Prior to baseball, Luhnow worked as an engineer, 
management consultant, and technology entrepreneur.[2] He worked for McKinsey 
and Company, a global management consulting firm, for five years. He founded 
and served as president and chief operating officer of Archetype Solutions, 
and served as general manager and vice president of marketing for Petstore.com.[7] 
Luhnow joined the front office of the St. Louis Cardinals in 2003.[5][8] 
Cardinals owner William DeWitt, Jr. had noticed what the Oakland A's had 
done with their Moneyball tactics and was looking to run his team in a 
more analytical, data-driven manner when he first hired Luhnow as vice 
president in 2003. Luhnow knew DeWitt's son-in-law from working at McKinsey 
& Company and from there, Luhnow met DeWitt and landed the job.[9] Luhnow's 
hiring initially raised eyebrows, since he had no previous experience in 
baseball and had not played the sport since high school. He was derided 
with nicknames like "the accountant" and "Harry Potter."[2] Luhnow began 
as the Cardinals' vice president of baseball development, as he established 
a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic and extended the Cardinals' 
scouting in Venezuela.[5][10] The Cardinals promoted him in 2005 to the 
role of vice president of player procurement, which made him the director 
of amateur, international and domestic scouting. He was named vice president 
of scouting and player development in 2006.[5] During his time with the 
Cardinals, he developed a reputation for scouting and player development, 
and he is credited with having a key role in the team's successes in the 
minor leagues. The Cardinals won five minor league championships under 
his watch, and had the best system-wide minor league record in 2010.[11][12] 
From 2005 to 2007, the first three Cardinals drafts overseen by Luhnow 
produced 24 future major leaguers, the most of any team during that period. 
Several players who made important contributions to the Cardinals' victory 
in the 2011 World Series, including Jaime Garcia, Allen Craig, Jon Jay 
and Lance Lynn, were drafted during Luhnow's tenure.[12] The Houston Astros 
announced Luhnow's hiring as the team's general manager on December 8, 
2011,[3] replacing Ed Wade. In making the announcement, team president 
George Postolos cited Luhnow's past successes in player development and 
scouting with the Cardinals organization. He also expressed hope that "[Luhnow's] 
bicultural background [would] be an asset in recruiting players from Latin 
America and developing the Hispanic market for Los Astros."[3] Luhnow received 
a contract extension at an undisclosed time in 2014.[13] After Luhnow's 
first season, he opted to fire Astros' manager Brad Mills, replacing him 
with Bo Porter after the 2012 season. Porter was forced to keep most of 
Mills' coaching staff, with third base coach Dave Trembley and hitting 
coach John Mallee serving as Porter's only additions to the staff for the 
2013 season.[14] Luhnow and Porter had a falling out during the 2014 season, 
leading Luhnow to fire Porter. He chose A. J. Hinch as Porter's successor, 
and allowed Hinch to choose his coaching staff, with the exception of Brent 
Strom, the pitching coach, who the team chose to retain.[15] News of an 
investigation into potential Cardinal front office personnel hacking into 
the Astros' baseball operations databases seeking information on player 
development, evaluation, and compensation broke on June 16, 2015. According 
to the Los Angeles Times (citing the New York Times), The investigation 
has drawn in the FBI. According to the LA Times, "MLB issued a statement 
Tuesday saying it has cooperated with the investigation but would take 
no action until 'the investigative process has been completed by federal
