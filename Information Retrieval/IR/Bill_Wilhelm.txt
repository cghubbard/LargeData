Bill Wilhelm (1929 – December 24, 2010) was an American college baseball 
coach who was the head coach of the Clemson Tigers from 1958 to 1993. In 
his 36 seasons as head coach, Wilhelm had a record of 1,161–536–10. Before 
coming to Clemson, Wilhelm played several seasons of minor league baseball 
and served one season as an assistant baseball coach at North Carolina.[1] 
Wilhelm played two seasons of college baseball at NC State, and he signed 
a professional contract with the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 1950, 
splitting that season between the Goldsboro Cardinals and the Allentown 
Cardinals. Wilhelm then spent two years out of baseball from 1951 to 1952, 
when he served in the United States Army in the Korean War.[1] In 1953, 
Wilhelm returned from military service and had his most successful minor 
league season. In 96 games with the Paducah Chiefs of the Class D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee 
League, he batted .291 and hit 14 home runs. After the 1954 season, which 
he split between the Columbus Cardinals and the Allentown Cardinals, Wilhelm 
left the Cardinals organization.[2] Wilhelm played the 1955 and 1956 seasons 
in the Milwaukee Braves system, advancing as high as the Double-A Atlanta 
Crackers. He played his final season of professional baseball in summer 
1957, with the Greensboro Patriots of the Boston Red Sox organization.[2] 
He appeared in a total of 401 minor league games, hitting .212 with 21 
home runs.[2] Prior to his final season of professional baseball in summer 
1957, Wilhelm had served as an assistant baseball coach for the North Carolina 
Tar Heels in spring 1957. In September 1957, Wilhelm accepted the head 
coaching position at Clemson.[1] In his first two seasons, Wilhelm led 
the program to two Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championships and its 
first two College World Series appearances, in 1958 and 1959. In the next 
13 season (1960–1972), however, Clemson made only one NCAA Tournament appearance, 
in 1967.[3] With the start of the ACC Tournament era in 1973, Wilhelm began 
a stretch of 11 regular season conference championships in 13 seasons (through 
1985), including seven consecutive from 1973–1979. This 13-season period 
included three College World Series appearances, in 1976, 1977, and 1980.[3] 
From 1986–1993, the final eight seasons of Wilhelm's head coaching career, 
Clemson won three regular season conference championships (1988, 1991, 
1992), three conference tournament championships (1989, 1991, and 1993), 
and one College World Series appearance (1991).[3] Wilhelm's teams had 
winning records in each of his 36 seasons, and he won a total of 17 ACC 
Regular Season Championships and seven ACC Tournament Championships, both 
ACC coaching records, as of the end of the 2012 season.[4] He also appeared 
in six College World Series. He coached 27 players who went on to play 
Major League Baseball.[3] The following is a table of Wilhelm's yearly
