The Pittsburgh Panthers football is the intercollegiate football team of 
the University of Pittsburgh, often referred to as "Pitt", located in Pittsburgh. 
Traditionally the most popular sport at the university, Pitt football has 
played at the highest level of American college football competition, now 
termed the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, since the beginning 
of the school's sponsorship of the sport in 1890. As of the 2013 season, 
Pitt competes as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Pitt 
has claimed nine national championships[4] and is among the top 20 college 
football programs in terms of all-time wins.[5] Its teams have featured 
many coaches and players notable throughout the history of college football, 
including, among all schools, the fifth most College Football Hall of Fame 
inductees,[6] the twelfth most consensus All-Americans,[7] and the third 
most Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees.[8] The Panthers are currently 
coached by Pat Narduzzi. Pitt plays home games at Heinz Field which they 
share with the National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers and utilize 
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Performance Complex 
as their practice facility. Football at the University of Pittsburgh began 
in the fall of 1889 when the school was still known as the Western University 
of Pennsylvania, often referred to as WUP, and was located in what was 
then known as Allegheny City and is today the city of Pittsburgh's North 
Side. A 130-pound WUP student, Bert Smyers, along with senior student John 
Scott, assembled a football team that year composed of only three players 
who had previously witnessed the sport. The team played in one informal 
game, a loss against Shady Side Academy, in which Smyers made himself quarterback 
and Scott played center. In preparation for the following year, the first 
season of football officially recognized by the university, Smyers and 
his teammates took up a collection and purchased a football for practices 
and games; players were responsible for their own uniforms. In Smyers' 
case, his uniform was pieced together by his mother and sister.[9] The 
first official game for the university was played on October 11, 1890, 
when the Allegheny Athletic Association's opponent, Shadyside Academy, 
failed to appear for its game at Exposition Park. Allegheny A.A. called 
Smyers who brought the WUP team as a replacement. In an inglorious start 
to Pitt football history, WUP was defeated 38–0.[10] Smyers' team next 
faced Washington and Jefferson College, losing 32–0, but closed out its 
inaugural three game season with the university's first win, a 10–4 victory 
over Geneva College.[11] The following season saw the university collect 
more losses en route to a 2–5 record. Smyers suffered a broken nose in 
a 40–6 loss to Washington and Jefferson, a school that would become one 
of WUP's fiercest early rivals. The WUP team did record the school's first 
shutout with a 6–0 win over Geneva, as well as the school's first blowout 
in a 54–0 win over Western Pennsylvania Medical College who, interestingly, 
became affiliated with WUP in 1892 and later became the university's medical 
school when they merged in 1908.[11][12] Perhaps the most important development 
for the second season of football was Smyers recruitment of Joseph Trees 
from Normal University of Pennsylvania. The 210 pound Trees became WUP's 
first subsidized athlete[13] and, later in life, made millions in the oil 
industry and became an important benefactor for the university and athletic 
department. Today, Trees Hall, an athletic facility on the University of 
Pittsburgh's main campus in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh, bears his 
name. The first winning record for the university came in the third season 
of competition in 1892, when the team posted a 4–2 record. The following 
season in 1893, the team had its first official coach, Anson F. Harrold, 
who led the team to an unremarkable 1–4 record. However, during that season 
the first contest was played in what would become a 96-game series versus 
Penn State, thus originating one of the longest and fiercest rivalries 
for both schools. In 1895, the school suffered a 1–6 season under coach 
J.P. Linn. The 1895 season was notable for the first Backyard Brawl on 
October 26, 1895, with WUP losing to West Virginia 8–0 in Wheeling, West 
Virginia. The university did not see another winning season until Fred 
Robinson led WUP to a 5–2–1 record in 1898. In 1899, Robinson continued 
his success with a 3–1–1 record, giving the school its first back-to-back 
winning seasons. This was followed by two more consecutive winning seasons, 
including a record seven-win season in 1901 under coach Wilbur Hockensmith. 
That season, Hockensmith led the school to its first victory over West 
Virginia, a 12–0 shutout in Morgantown on October 5, 1901. In the early 
years of the 20th century, interest in college football grew both in Pittsburgh 
and throughout the nation. In 1903, Arthur St. Leger "Texas" Mosse was 
hired away from the University of Kansas, and brought several of his players 
with him. Other players were recruited from surrounding Western Pennsylvania 
colleges, including star half back Joseph H. Thompson.[14] The 1903 season, 
the first under Mosse, was the university's first winless season at 0–9–1.[n 
1] In perhaps one of the greatest turnarounds in college football history, 
Mosse led WUP to an undefeated 10–0 season, the school's first, in 1904. 
The 1904 team surrendered only one touchdown on the way to collectively 
outscoring opponents 406–5.[17] That season also saw the school's first 
victory over Penn State, a 22–5 rout, as well as a 53–0 shutout of West 
Virginia.[n 2] The success of this period can be partially attributed to 
actions taken by the university's administration, led by newly installed 
chancellor Samuel McCormick who took special interest in athletics at the 
university. Encouraged by university trustee George Hubberd Clapp, the 
administration more actively engaged in supporting the athletic program 
during this period in order to promote the university. A football association 
was formed, the school's first booster organization, whose largest initial 
contributor was Andrew W. Mellon. The university also obtained a lease 
of Exposition Park to give the football team a more stable and permanent 
home, and its first full season at the park began with the 1904 undefeated 
team. This undefeated 1904 season was followed by a 10–2 record under Mosse 
in 1905, as well as six additional winning seasons.[21] These Mosse coached 
squads featured team captain Joe Thompson, who was recruited from Geneva 
College to play for WUP from 1904 to 1906.[22] During Thompson's playing 
years, the team compiled a 26–6 record. Thompson graduated from the university 
in 1905 and continued on with post-graduate work in the School of Law completing 
his law degree. However, Thompson had long desired the head coaching position 
and finally obtained the job in 1909, after successful coach John A. Moorehead, 
who helped facilitate the first known use of numbers on the uniforms of 
football players in 1908,[23][24][25][n 3] left coaching to pursue his 
family's business interests. That same year, the university changed its 
name from Western University of Pennsylvania to the University of Pittsburgh, 
and it soon became known as "Pitt" among fans and students. The following 
year, in 1909, the school officially adopted the Panther as a mascot. Also 
in 1909, the school moved to the Oakland section of Pittsburgh where it 
remains to this day, and the football team began playing games at Forbes 
Field, starting with the third game of the season against Bucknell on October 
16, 1909.[27] Thompson coached at Pitt until 1912, the longest tenure of 
any coach to that point, and led the football team to a 22–11–2 record. 
The highlight of his coaching tenure was the 1910 season in which Pitt, 
led by star fullback Tex Richards, went undefeated for the second time 
in school history. Of even greater significance, the 1910 team was unscored 
upon, collectively outscoring its 9 opponents 282–0, and is considered 
by many to be that season's national champion.[28] Following his coaching 
stint, Thompson went on to become a highly decorated hero of World War 
I. Winning continued under coach Joseph Duff, including an 8–1 record in 
1914 in which opponents were collectively outscored 207–38, and the university 
was well on the way to establishing itself as a regional, if not yet national, 
power. Duff would leave the Panthers after two seasons to serve in World 
War I, where he would be killed in combat in October 1918. In 1914, Pitt 
athletic booster Joseph Trees and athletic director A. R. Hamilton hired 
Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner as Pitt's head coach. Warner, who had previously 
led Carlisle, Cornell, and Georgia, had been successful at his previous 
stops, mentoring the likes of Jim Thorpe, and was known as an innovator 
of the game who originated the screen pass, single- and double-wing formations, 
and use of shoulder and thigh pads. His arrival at Pitt gave the program 
instant national credibility, lifting the perception of the program from 
a regional power to that of a national one.[29] Warner's impact was immediate. 
Led by center Robert Peck, Pitt's first First Team All-American, and All-American 
end James Pat Herron, Warner's first Pitt team in 1915 went 8–0, shutting 
out five opponents, and was trumpeted by football historian Parke H. Davis 
as that season's national champion.[30] His second season duplicated that 
success, repeating an 8–0 record while collectively outscoring opponents 
255–25, and garnering what is widely regarded as a consensus national championship.[31] 
The lone scare of the 1916 season occurred at Navy when, following a delay 
of the team's train heading to Annapolis that caused a late arrival, the 
team overcame several fumbles and eked out a 20–19 victory.[32] The 1916 
team was led again by Herron and Peck, now in his last season, as well 
as All-Americans fullback Andy Hastings and guard "Tiny" Thornhill. Also 
on that team were Jock Sutherland and H.C. "Doc" Carlson, who both would 
garner First Team All-American selections while members of the undefeated 
1917 team, and go on to become perhaps Pitt's most legendary coaches in 
football and basketball, respectively. The 1917 team, nicknamed "The Fighting 
Dentists" because over half the roster became doctors or dentists, finished 
10–0 with five shutouts despite losing several players to military service 
at the outbreak of World War I. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, which 
took the life of former Pitt star Tex Richards,[33] saw the implementation 
of quarantines that eliminated much of that year's college football season, 
including five of Pitt's originally scheduled contests. All of Pitt's games 
that year were played in November, including a high-profile game played 
as a War Charities benefit against undefeated, unscored upon, and defending 
national champion Georgia Tech, coached by the legendary John Heisman. 
Pitt swept through its first two games and then dismantled Georgia Tech 
32–0 in front of many of the nation's top sports writers including Walter 
Camp. The final game of the season at Cleveland Naval Reserve resulted 
in Warner's first loss at Pitt and is one of the most controversial in 
school history. Warner, along with some reporters covering the game, insisted 
Pitt was robbed by the officials who, claiming the official timekeeper's 
watch was broken, arbitrarily ended the first half before Pitt was able 
to score and then allowed the Reserves extra time in the fourth quarter 
to pull ahead 10–9 before calling an end to the game.[34][35] Despite the 
loss, the 4–1 Panthers of 1918 were named by multiple selectors as a national 
champion for that season.[36] In 1919, several players suffered season-ending 
injuries, and Pitt stumbled to a 6–2–1 record that included another victory 
over Georgia Tech. The Panthers returned to undefeated status during 1920, 
albeit with ties against Syracuse and undefeated Penn State. The Penn State 
game ended in a scoreless tie after Pitt star Tom Davies, who was injured 
early in the game, returned later to miss a possible game-winning field 
goal. For the 1921 season, the team's record dipped to 5–3–1, but Pitt 
made college football history on October 8, 1921. Harold W. Arlin announced 
the first live radio broadcast of a college football game in the United 
States from Forbes Field on KDKA radio as the Pitt Panthers defeated West 
Virginia 21–13 in the annual Backyard Brawl.[37] Prior to the 1922 season, 
Warner announced he was leaving Pitt to take the head coaching position 
at Stanford, but he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. 
1922 resulted in an 8–2 record, and the season ended on a high note when 
the Panthers took their first cross-country trip, by train, to defeat Stanford, 
coached by two Pitt assistants sent ahead by Warner, 16–7 at Stanford. 
Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt as the Panthers stumbled to 
a 5–4 record in 1923. However, the Warner era at Pitt closed on a high 
note with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29. In all, Warner 
coached his Pitt teams to 33 straight wins and three national championships 
(1915, 1916 and 1918).[38] He coached Pittsburgh from 1915 to 1923 to a 
combined 60–12–4 record.[39] Importantly, Warner helped raise the interest 
in Pitt football to the point where the university sought to build an on-campus 
stadium with increased seating capacity that would be dedicated to the 
football team, and the school began taking steps to secure the necessary 
land and funds to build Pitt Stadium. A natural replacement for Warner 
was Dr. John Bain "Jock" Sutherland, Warner's former All-American guard 
on the 1915 and 1916 national championship teams and 1917 undefeated team. 
A native of Coupar Angus in Scotland, Sutherland had graduated from the 
University of Pittsburgh's School of Dentistry, where he later served as 
faculty. Sutherland had served a tour in the Army and later achieved success 
as the head coach of Lafayette College from 1919 to 1923, leading the Leopards 
to the 1921 Eastern Collegiate Championship and shutting out Warner's Pitt 
teams in 1921 and 1922. So it was in 1924 that Sutherland returned to his 
alma mater to assume the head coaching duties with the goal of constructing 
dominant teams built on power and speed.[40] After a 5–3–1 record in his 
first season, Sutherland's second season kicked off the Panthers' first 
in the newly constructed Pitt Stadium and saw the team achieve an 8–1 record 
and win the 1925 Eastern Championship. The following year, the Panthers 
featured Gibby Welch, who led the nation in rushing in 1926 and helped 
Pitt to the Eastern Championship and its first bowl game, the Rose Bowl, 
in 1927. Pitt, ironically, lost the Rose Bowl 7–6 to a Stanford team headed 
by the Panthers' former coach, "Pop" Warner. In 1929, Pitt went undefeated 
in the regular season, the first of four undefeated regular seasons under 
Sutherland, and won the Eastern Championship, but lost its second appearance 
in the Rose Bowl to USC. Bowls at the time were still considered by many 
to be exhibition games, and the loss did not prevent football historian 
Parke Davis from naming Pitt as that season's national champion.[30] The 
1930 season, at 6–2–1, was a rebuilding one for Sutherland, and was marked 
by a loss to Notre Dame that would be the only meeting between Sutherland 
and Knute Rockne due to his death in a 1931 plane crash. The Irish also 
spoiled Pitt's perfect season in a 1931 game at South Bend, although the 
Panthers finished 8–1 with six shutouts, including a 40–0 dismantling of 
Nebraska. That season also saw Pitt defeat Penn State in State College, 
using only one first-string player, by a score of 41–6 en route to winning 
the Eastern Championship.[41] These accomplishments would prompt Parke 
Davis to again name the Panthers national champions.[30] Pitt would exact 
revenge at home the following season by shutting out Notre Dame 12–0, and 
would also upend undefeated Penn in Philadelphia, as well as shut out Stanford 
at home on their way to the 1932 Eastern Championship. However, the season 
ended when the Panthers, in their third Rose Bowl, were again defeated 
by USC. The 1933 season was spoiled only by a 7–3 loss at Minnesota in 
which the Panthers fumbled twice inside their own 5-yard line. Minnesota 
would best Pitt again in 1934, when the Panthers squandered a third quarter 
lead to lose 13–7 to the undefeated Gophers.[42] However, in 1934 Pitt 
also won at Nebraska 25–6, shut out Notre Dame 19–0, its third victory 
in a row over the Irish, and got revenge for the previous Rose Bowl losses 
to USC by defeating the Trojans 20–6 at Pitt Stadium. With these victories 
Pitt was named Eastern Champions as well as being awarded a share of the 
national championship by Parke Davis.[4][43][44] Pitt underwent rebuilding 
in 1935, going 7–1–2. Of historic note, in 1935, Pitt battled then football 
powerhouse Fordham, who featured the Seven Blocks of Granite which included 
guard Vince Lombardi, to the first of what would be three consecutive scoreless 
ties at New York City's Polo Grounds. Pitt ended the season with a 12–7 
win at USC. One of the greatest back-to-back stretches in Pitt football 
history occurred during the 1936 and 1937 seasons which featured Heisman 
Trophy candidate and Hall of Fame running back Marshall Goldberg. In 1936, 
Pitt shut out five of its opponents, including a 34–0 win over West Virginia, 
a 6–0 victory at Ohio State, and a 26–0 win over Notre Dame in which the 
Irish did not achieve a first down until late in the third quarter. The 
Panthers also won at Nebraska 19–6 and defeated Penn State 24–7. Only the 
second of three consecutive scoreless ties at the Polo Grounds against 
Fordham, and a mid-October 7–0 upset loss against crosstown rival Duquesne, 
marred the record. The Panthers finished the regular season winning the 
Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy as Eastern Champions and ranked third in the 
Associate Press Poll, the inaugural year of the poll, whose rankings were 
finalized before the bowl season. Pitt accepted a bid to the Rose Bowl 
to face Washington, and this time Sutherland was determined not to lose 
again out west. To avoid subpar play following the cross country train 
trip, Sutherland took his team out two weeks early to allow for adequate 
preparation. These moves paid off with a 21–0 rout of Washington which 
led many selectors to name Pitt as the 1936 national champions.[45] However, 
it was during this time that the seeds of a rift between Sutherland and 
the university's administration were being sown, partly initiated by the 
refusal of the university to supply pocket money for players during the 
Rose Bowl trip, which Sutherland then decided to supply out of his own 
pocket.[46] Pitt followed up the Rose Bowl winning 1936 season with a 9–0–1 
record in 1937 that included five shutouts, including those over West Virginia, 
Wisconsin, and at Duke as well as additional victories against Penn State, 
Nebraska, and at Notre Dame. The only blemish on the record was the third 
consecutive tie at Fordham, which resulted when an apparent winning touchdown 
by Pitt's Marshall Goldberg was called back on a holding penalty.[47] Pitt 
finished the 1937 regular season as repeat Eastern Champions and was ranked 
number one in the AP's final poll. Partly due to the developing rift with 
the university administration, and also due to the time and expense of 
the travel, Pitt became the first team to publicly decline a Rose Bowl 
invitation following a vote of the players.[48] Despite its decision to 
sit out the postseason, the 1937 Pitt team was widely regarded as consensus 
national champions.[49] During this period, Pitt regularly dominated opposing 
teams, even inducing Notre Dame to drop Pitt from its schedule.[50] However, 
it was also during this era that the university, led by chancellor John 
Gabbert Bowman, began introducing policies designed to de-emphasize the 
athletic programs. This was manifested when a plan was instituted in the 
spring of 1937 by Athletic Director James "Whitey" Hagan, who had actually 
played for Sutherland, to eliminate university subsidies for athletes.[51] 
Hagan's plan was then absorbed into a 1938 athletics code of conduct, referred 
to as "Code Bowman", which discouraged alumni help, restricted practices 
to two hours a day, and eliminated both athletic recruiting and all direct 
subsidization of athletics.[52][53] While the implementation of these policies 
was the beginning of the end for that era of Pitt football prominence, 
the Panthers still impressed during the 1938 season behind an assembly 
of talent at running back labeled the "Dream Backfield." With Goldberg 
at fullback, Dick Cassiano and Harold Stebbins at halfback, and John Chickerneo 
at quarterback, Pitt won at Wisconsin, shut out West Virginia and Penn 
State at home and Nebraska on the road, and routed Southern Methodist. 
Notably, the deadlock against Fordham was finally broken as Pitt defeated 
the Rams 24–13 at Pitt Stadium.[54] However, Pitt was tripped up against 
neighboring rival Carnegie Tech and at undefeated Duke. Following the season, 
the split between the administration and Sutherland became complete, and 
Sutherland resigned in March saying "The present system of athletic administration 
has resulted in conditions which, for me, are intolerable." The resignation 
caused a firestorm in the press and among the program's supporters, and 
resulted in student outrage and protests. However, the athletic code was 
firmly implemented and Sutherland's resignation stood.[55][56] Sutherland, 
who was described as "a national hero" in a Saturday Evening Post article,[57] 
was perhaps the most highly admired and influential coach in the history 
of the university. Following his years at Pitt he never coached again in 
college and moved on to a career in the NFL including a head coaching stint 
with the Pittsburgh Steelers before his untimely death in 1948 of a brain 
tumor. During his 15-year tenure at the university, the longest of any 
football coach at Pitt, he compiled a record of 111–20–12 which included 
79 shutouts. Sutherland never lost to rival Penn State and lost only once 
to West Virginia, and his teams were named Eastern football champions seven 
times: 1925, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937.[58] During this time, 
Pitt appeared in four Rose Bowl games (1928, 1930, 1933, and 1937) and 
turned down a bid for the 1938 Rose Bowl.[59] Sutherland's teams were named 
"National Champions" by various selectors for nine different seasons including 
1925, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, and 1938.[30][60] Of these, 
the University of Pittsburgh officially recognizes five of those years 
as national championship seasons: 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937.[60] 
The policy of deemphasis resulted in a dramatic downturn for Pitt's football 
fortunes, including a succession of coaches with short stints. Charley 
Bowser, a former player at Pitt under "Pop" Warner, took over in 1939, 
but the lack of athletic subsidies had eroded the talent base and the on-field 
results likewise steadily deteriorated. Bowser started 3–0 in 1939 and 
Pitt was ranked number one in the AP poll, but won only two more games 
and finished 5–4. Eight consecutive losing seasons followed. Pitt's stars 
during this period were running back Edgar "Special Delivery" Jones and 
guard Ralph Fife, who led Pitt to an upset win over undefeated Fordham 
in 1941. Bowser was replaced by Clark Shaughnessy in 1943; and in 1945, 
with new university chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald at the helm, athletic scholarships 
and recruiting were reinstated. However, substantial damage had already 
been done to the football program. Shaughnessy was replaced in 1946 by 
Wes Fesler, who left after his only season at Pitt to coach his alma mater 
Ohio State. Walter "Mike" Milligan took over head coaching duties in 1947 
and scored one of the most satisfying wins in Pitt history when the Panthers 
defeated the Fesler-coached Ohio State team 12–0 for their only win of 
the season. During this era Pitt's first African-American player, Jimmy 
Joe Robinson, led the team in receiving and rushing, and also excelled 
at returning punts and kickoffs. Milligan brought Pitt back to winning 
records in 1948 and 1949, achieving consecutive 6–3 seasons that included 
appearances in the national rankings and back-to-back shutouts of Penn 
State. However, Milligan resigned after the 1949 season, never to return 
to head coaching, due to a perceived snub by the university offering him 
only a one-year contract.[61] During this same period, Pitt sought entry 
into the Big Ten Conference as the replacement for the University of Chicago, 
which had withdrawn from the conference. Pitt had placed its athletic programs 
under the Big Ten's supervision in 1939, which newspapers of the time characterized 
as a probationary admission likely to result in eventual full membership.[62] 
Pitt's application for membership was never approved, partly due to opposition 
by Ohio State, out of their concern that conference membership for Pittsburgh 
would diminish a possible recruiting advantage such membership gave to 
the Buckeyes in talent-rich Pennsylvania. Instead, Michigan State, rather 
than Pitt, was eventually selected for Big Ten membership in May 1949.[63] 
Len Casanova took the job in 1950 but a disastrous campaign was followed 
by his departure following spring practice in 1951. This led to athletic 
director Tom Hamilton taking the reins of the team on an interim basis 
for the 1951 season. In 1952 Red Dawson took over, and the Panthers, led 
by future Hall of Famer Joe Schmidt, scored a huge upset at Notre Dame, 
then coached by Frank Leahy, en route to a 6–3 record. However, a losing 
record followed in 1953, and after three losses to start the 1954 season, 
and due to poor health, Dawson stepped down. For the remainder of the season 
Hamilton again took over the team, guiding Pitt to an upset of number nine 
Navy and handing West Virginia its only loss of the season.[64] In 1955 
Pitt sought a return to the roots of its previous success by turning to 
John Michelosen, a quarterback on Jock Sutherland's 1936 and 1937 championship 
teams who later served as a Sutherland assistant and as the head coach 
of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Michelosen immediately brought Pitt football 
back to respectability in his first season with the 1955 Eastern Championship 
that was capped by an appearance in the 1956 Sugar Bowl. Pitt's invitation 
to the Sugar Bowl was surrounded by controversy because Pitt, an integrated 
team, was the first to bring an African-American, Bobby Grier, to play 
in a southeastern bowl game in the segregated Deep South.[65] Grier's play 
in the Sugar Bowl cemented the university's place in civil rights history 
as the first team to break the color barrier for southeastern bowls. However, 
the game was marred by protests in the South leading up to the game, which 
Pitt lost 7–0 when a controversial interference penalty was called on Grier 
that set up the winning touchdown for Georgia Tech. The following season, 
Michelosen guided Pitt to another bowl berth, the Gator Bowl, which resulted 
in another seven-point loss to Georgia Tech.[65] Four additional winning 
seasons followed against formidable national schedules that were highlighted 
by victories over Notre Dame, USC, Miami, UCLA, Penn State, Oregon, Syracuse, 
Nebraska, and West Virginia. A three win season in 1961 that included wins 
at Miami and over Navy and USC, along with three close losses by 6 points 
or less to Baylor, Washington, and Notre Dame, was followed by a 5–5 record 
in 1962 and then perhaps the best team of the Micheloson era in 1963. The 
1963 team, led by All-American Paul Martha, swept through a schedule that 
included wins at Notre Dame, UCLA, West Virginia, and Miami and home victories 
against Washington, Cal, Syracuse, and Penn State. The only loss of the 
season was in late October at Navy, which was led by Roger Staubach and 
would finish the season ranked second in the nation. The Panthers, at 7–1 
and ranked fourth in the nation, headed into their rivalry against Penn 
State with a chance to play for a national championship. However, national 
tragedy struck on November 22 when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated 
which resulted in postponing Pitt's next-to-last game against Penn State 
from November 23 to December 7. The Panthers defeated the Miami Hurricanes 
on November 30, improving their record to 8–1. The bowls, which feared 
inviting Pitt before their season finale against Penn State the following 
week, signed other teams, leaving Pitt without a bowl invitation despite 
defeating the Nittany Lions, 22–21, and ending the season with a 9–1 record. 
Perceived as perhaps the best team of the modern football era not to appear 
in a bowl, the 1963 team finished with its number three ranking intact, 
but infamously received the label of the "No Bowl Team".[66] The bad luck 
of 1963 seemed to jinx the program for the rest of Michelosen tenure, and 
despite wins over Oklahoma, Miami, West Virginia, and Penn State, two three-win 
seasons followed. The losses prompted the removal of Michelosen as coach, 
a move that sent the football program into a tailspin. In eleven seasons 
at Pitt, the second longest coaching tenure at the school after Sutherland's, 
Michelosen achieved a 56–49–7 record with only 4 losing campaigns. Pitt 
finished ranked among the top twenty programs in four seasons with Michelosen 
at the helm. Michelosen was a major coaching influence on such modern day 
NFL coaching greats as Mike Ditka and Marty Schottenheimer, both of whom 
played at Pitt under Michelosen. The years that followed Michelosen's tenure 
were among the most downtrodden years of Pitt football as the Panthers 
compiled a sickly 16–56 record over the next six seasons. David Hart, who 
replaced Michelosen, produced three straight one-win seasons where many 
games produced embarrassing scores (the average score during Hart's three 
years was 34–9). Hart was replaced in 1969 by Carl DePasqua, who had previously 
won a Division II national title as Waynesburg's coach and had been currently 
serving as an assistant coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers. DePasqua brought 
a handful of wins, including upsets over Syracuse, West Virginia, and at 
UCLA and produced the Panthers' first non-losing season in seven years, 
but could not achieve a winning record and was relieved following a disastrous 
single win campaign in 1972. University Chancellor Wesley Posvar took action 
to revive the football program and hired Johnny Majors from Iowa State 
to resurrect the program in 1973. Majors immediately upgraded the recruiting, 
most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' 
impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game with Majors as coach, the Panthers 
travelled to the University of Georgia where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 
7–7. The excitement in the city was palpable as the Panthers improved from 
one win in 1972 to a 6–5–1 record in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers 
their first bowl bid since 1956 when they were invited to play Arizona 
State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where they lost 28–7. The next season saw 
further improvement with wins at Florida State and Georgia Tech to finish 
7–4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over Kansas capped an 8–4 record highlighted 
by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame. The stage was thus set for the 1976 
edition of the Panthers to make a run for the National Championship. The 
1976 season began with the Panthers ranked ninth in the AP preseason poll. 
The first game was at Notre Dame, where the Irish grew the grass long on 
the playing field in a failed attempt to slow down Dorsett, who had burned 
them for 303 rushing yards the year before.[67] Their efforts were in vain 
as Dorsett ran for a 61-yard touchdown on Pitt's first play from scrimmage 
on the way to a 31–10 win. The season continued with a 42–14 win at Georgia 
Tech and a 36–19 win over Miami. On October 23, the Panthers travelled 
to Annapolis to face Navy during which Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing 
record on a 32-yard touchdown run in Pitt's 45–0 victory. Dorsett's achievement 
prompted a mid-game celebration in which even Navy saluted the feat with 
a cannon blast.[68] Pitt next defeated eastern rival Syracuse 23–13, and 
on November 6, number two ranked Pitt easily handled Army while number 
one ranked Michigan lost to Purdue. For the first time since 1939, the 
Pitt Panthers were the number one ranked team in the country. The following 
week, they successfully defended their top rating in a close Backyard Brawl 
against rival West Virginia. With a record of 10–0, the Panthers headed 
into their regular season finale with only heated instate rival Penn State 
standing in the way of Pitt's national title aspirations. At a packed Three 
Rivers Stadium on the day after Thanksgiving, the Nittany Lions held Dorsett 
to 51 yards in the first half and had the game tied 7–7. Majors adjusted 
for the second half by shifting Dorsett from tailback to fullback, enabling 
him to explode for an additional 173 yards as Pitt rolled to a 24–7 victory 
that capped an undefeated regular season.[69] In December, Dorsett became 
the first Pitt Panther to win the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college 
football player. Dorsett also won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player 
of the Year Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. The 11–0 Panthers 
accepted an invitation to the 1977 Sugar Bowl to face second ranked Georgia. 
Pitt defeated the Bulldogs 27–3 and was voted number one in both the final 
Associated Press and Coaches polls, claiming their ninth national championship.[70] 
This was Pitt's first undefeated national championship since 1937. The 
American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) named Majors the 1976 Coach 
of the Year. Following this historic season, Majors returned to his alma 
mater, the University of Tennessee, to take the head coaching job.[71] 
Jackie Sherrill, an assistant under Majors at Iowa State and Pitt and the 
head coach at Washington State, succeeded Majors as head coach at Pitt. 
Under Sherrill, the winning continued with a 9–2–1 record and Gator Bowl 
win in 1977. An 8–4 record and Tangerine Bowl appearance followed in 1978. 
Sherrill stockpiled future NFL talent including Pittsburgh's own quarterback 
Dan Marino, Hall of Fame inductee Russ Grimm, and Outland Trophy winner 
Mark May. Sherrill also molded a devastating defense that was anchored 
at the defensive end position manned by Hall of Fame inductee Rickey Jackson 
and Heisman Trophy runner-up Hugh Green, who had the highest finish in 
the Heisman voting by a defensive player until 1997, when Michigan's cornerback 
Charles Woodson, who also played receiver, won the trophy. 1979 began a 
string of three straight seasons with 11–1 records. However, an early loss 
at North Carolina in 1979, a midseason loss during a driving rainstorm 
at Florida State in 1980, and a devastating season-ending defeat at the 
hands of rival Penn State in 1981 prevented those teams from clinching 
an AP or Coaches poll national championship. The 1981 loss to Penn State 
at Pitt Stadium was especially devastating, as the number one ranked Panthers 
had opened up a 14–0 first-quarter lead only to see an apparent Dan Marino 
touchdown pass intercepted in the endzone. The Nittany Lions scored 48 
unanswered points to end the Panthers' dream of a second national championship 
in five years.[72] In each of these three seasons, Pitt rebounded to win 
a bowl game: the Fiesta, Gator, and Sugar Bowls respectively. The 1982 
Sugar Bowl was highlighted by one of the most dramatic plays in Pitt history 
as Dan Marino hit a streaking John Brown on fourth down in the last seconds 
of the game for the go-ahead score against a Georgia team that featured 
Herschel Walker.[73] Sherrill's teams at Pitt are considered by some to 
be among the most talented in Pitt and college football history. The 1980 
Pitt team alone featured seven first round draft picks, 23 players who 
went on to start in the NFL, seven others who played in the NFL, and one 
player each who played in the CFL and the USFL.[74] Bobby Bowden, legendary 
coach of Florida State, is quoted as saying, "I've said it many times, 
in all my years of coaching, that Pitt team was the best college football 
team I have ever seen."[75] Sherrill left Pitt in early 1982 for Texas 
A&M, signing a then record contract worth over $1.7 million.[76] In five 
seasons, Sherrill's Panthers won fifty games, lost nine, and tied one (50–9–1), 
which places his 0.842 winning percentage at the top of the list for all 
Pitt coaches, just ahead of Jock Sutherland. Defensive coordinator and 
Pitt alumnus Foge Fazio took the reins of the preseason number one team 
for 1982. Expectations were high—dreams of a national championship seemed 
realistic.[77] The loaded Panthers, in Marino's senior season, stormed 
out to a 7–0 record and number one ranking before losing to Notre Dame 
at Pitt Stadium. A season-ending loss at Penn State and a Cotton Bowl Classic 
loss to Southern Methodist left Pitt fans disappointed. National championship 
aspirations again failed to materialize in 1983 when Pitt fell to 8–3–1, 
including a loss to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, despite inspired play 
from All-American offensive tackle Bill Fralic. A disastrous three-win 
season in 1984 was somewhat redeemed by a season-ending demolition of Penn 
State. However, a five-win season in 1985 prompted the school to relieve 
Fazio of his duties. Mike Gottfried, who was previously Kansas' head football 
coach, recruited well, defeated rival Penn State twice, and led Pitt to 
the Bluebonnet and John Hancock Sun bowls. Late in his tenure, the university's 
administration increased admissions standards for student-athletes to a 
level above those of its peer institutions and the NCAA. Gottfried fought 
these policy changes, which caused him to fall out of favor with the school's 
administration, including Chancellor Posvar. Additionally, Gottfried had 
poor relations with boosters, alumni and the media. As a result, Gottfried 
was fired after the 1989 season despite a 27–16–2 overall record.[78][79] 
Gottfried was replaced by his offensive coordinator, Paul Hackett, just 
prior to the 1989 Sun Bowl in which Pitt defeated Texas A&M. Under Hackett, 
the Panthers went 3–7–1 in 1990, improved to 6–5 in 1991 but fell to 3–8 
in 1992, leading to his dismissal as head coach. Assistant coach and Pitt 
alumnus Sal Sunseri took over as interim head coach for the final contest 
at Hawai'i. With new academic policies in place, the football program underwent 
a steep decline. Hackett only posted one winning season. Hackett's overall 
record at Pitt is 13–20–1. In 1991 Pitt joined the new Big East Football 
Conference, thus ending its history as a football independent. Pitt had 
been a member of the Big East in most other sports, including basketball, 
since 1982. The university again looked to its past to reverse its fortunes 
and brought back Johnny Majors, who had recently resigned from Tennessee 
after a successful 16-year tenure there. However, recruiting had fallen 
off significantly under Hackett, and the quality of Pitt's football facilities 
had fallen behind those of its competition. Over the next four years, Majors 
tried to recreate the magic of the 1976 season but achieved little success. 
His final campaign in 1996 resulted in a 4–7 record which included several 
humiliating defeats. A new chancellor, Mark Nordenberg, brought in athletic 
director Steve Pederson in 1996 to resurrect the program.[80] The move 
facilitated Majors' retirement from coaching following the 1996 season, 
although he continued to serve the university in the position of Special 
Assistant to the Athletic Director and Chancellor until the summer of 2007.[81] 
The Pitt football program saw many changes instituted in 1997. New athletic 
director Steve Pederson moved to revamp the athletic department after the 
preceding years had wounded the program's image.[82] A controversial emphasis 
on the use of the full name "Pittsburgh", at the expense of the university's 
abbreviated moniker "Pitt", along with new logos designed to invoke the 
heritage of the steel industry in the region, were instituted in an attempt 
to tie the school more closely to the image of the city. New shades of 
blue and gold were introduced and the athletic booster club was overhauled.[83] 
Walt Harris, who had built a reputation as a quarterback guru with a background 
in the West Coast Offense, was brought in to replace Majors in 1997 and 
undertook the task of rebuilding a program that won only fifteen games 
in the previous five seasons. Results were almost immediate as Harris took 
Pitt to the Liberty Bowl in his first season, finishing with a 6–6 record. 
Over the next two seasons, the Panthers posted a losing record as Harris 
worked on enhancing the talent in Pitt's program. At the same time, the 
university administration decided to bring the football program's deteriorating 
facilities in line with those of Pitt's peers. A state-of-the art practice 
facility, the UPMC Sports Performance Complex, was constructed on the city's 
South Side in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
In lieu of much-needed but cost-prohibitive renovations to modernize Pitt 
Stadium, the administration made a controversial decision to move home 
games to the newly proposed North Shore stadium, later named Heinz Field, 
and to demolish Pitt Stadium in order to build a long-awaited convocation 
center on its footprint.[84] 1999 was the final season for the Panthers 
in Pitt Stadium, which had served Pitt for 75 seasons. On November 13, 
1999, the Panthers upset Notre Dame 37–27 in the last game played at the 
stadium. Although the Panthers showed improvement during the 1999 season, 
their loss in the season finale at West Virginia left them with a 5–6 record 
and without a bowl. Pitt played its home games in 2000 at Three Rivers 
Stadium. Behind an increasing number of talented players, led by Biletnikoff 
Award winner Antonio Bryant, Pitt was back to a winning record in 2000 
and played Iowa State in the Insight.com Bowl. In the second game of the 
2000 season, Pitt defeated rival Penn State 12–0 in what has become the 
final game in the series which is currently on hiatus until 2016.[85] In 
2001, Pitt began playing its home games at Heinz Field. Additional bowl 
games and national rankings followed over the next four seasons. Overall 
Harris led the Panthers to a bowl game in six of his eight seasons, including 
five consecutive bowl games from 2000 through 2004, with bowl victories 
in the Tangerine Bowl over North Carolina State in 2001 and, led by Biletnikoff 
and Walter Camp Award winner Larry Fitzgerald, over Oregon State in the 
2002 Insight Bowl. Harris also led Pittsburgh to a share of the Big East 
Conference championship in 2004 and Pitt received the conference's automatic 
Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl bid, playing Utah in the Fiesta Bowl. 
Harris was named the Big East Conference Coach of the Year in 1997 and 
2004, and he was the AFCA Region I Coach of the Year in 2002. Over his 
eight years at Pitt, from 1997–2004, Harris compiled an overall record 
of 52–44. However, alumni and fans were growing restless with perceived 
recruiting deficiencies and an inability to return the program to the highest 
level. When disparaging remarks about the program were made by his agent, 
Harris' contract negotiations with the school stalled. This led to an announcement 
prior to the Fiesta Bowl in 2004 that Harris was leaving Pitt to become 
head coach at Stanford.[86] Dave Wannstedt, a Pittsburgh area native and 
former Pitt player, graduate, and graduate assistant coach (1975–78), who 
had recently resigned as head coach of the NFL's Miami Dolphins, succeeded 
Harris as Pitt's head coach on December 23, 2004. Wannstedt's return to 
his alma mater was marked by a return to the use of the wordmark "Pitt" 
as a logo, including its display on the football helmets.[87] Known for 
his prowess in college recruiting when an assistant to Jimmy Johnson, Wannstedt 
reeled in classes that were nationally ranked throughout his tenure at 
Pitt.[88][89] However, little improvement was seen at first in the record 
column as Pitt struggled with a 5–6 and 6–6 record in his first two seasons. 
The 2007 season featured several close losses, but the team showed signs 
of improvement on the way to a 4–6 record prior to the last game of the 
season at number two ranked West Virginia. The game in Morgantown on December 
1, 2007, was the 100th Backyard Brawl, and would prove to be one of the 
greatest of the series. The four touchdown favorite Mountaineers needed 
only a win over archrival Pitt to earn a spot in the BCS National Championship 
Game. However, Wannstedt earned his signature victory and marked a turning 
point for the program with perhaps the biggest upset in both schools' histories 
when Pitt defeated West Virginia 13–9 and thus prevented the Mountaineers 
from playing for the national championship.[90] The following season, Pitt 
recorded key victories against Iowa, tenth ranked South Florida, West Virginia, 
and a 36–33 four-overtime thriller at Notre Dame, the longest game ever 
for both Notre Dame and Pittsburgh. A close defeat in the River City Rivalry 
against Cincinnati cost Pitt a conference championship, but the Panthers 
played in the Sun Bowl, its first bowl bid under Wannstedt, and finished 
with a 9–3 record. In 2009, Pitt shot off to a 9–1 start, its best start 
since 1982, with impressive wins over Navy, Notre Dame, and Rutgers, and 
had climbed to ninth in the AP and BCS polls. However, Pitt lost its final 
two regular season games, including a last second loss by a field goal 
at West Virginia and a one-point loss at home for the Big East championship 
to undefeated Cincinnati. The Panthers rebounded by winning the Meineke 
Car Care Bowl over North Carolina, 19–17, to finish ranked 15th and achieve 
its first ten-win season since 1981. In addition, Pitt players garnered 
many post-season accolades, including Big East Offensive Player and Rookie 
of the Year in Dion Lewis, and Big East Co-Defensive Players of the Year 
in Mick Williams and Greg Romeus. Prior to the 2010 season, Pitt was selected 
as the preseason favorite to win the Big East and was ranked fifteenth 
in the preseason polls. However, Pitt stumbled out of the gate with an 
overtime loss at Utah and dropped out of the polls for the remainder of 
the season. Although they claimed a share of the Big East championship 
(along with Connecticut and West Virginia), Pitt ended the regular season 
with a disappointing 7–5 record and an invitation to the BBVA Compass Bowl. 
This prompted Dave Wannstedt's resignation as head coach on December 7, 
2010,[91] with defensive coordinator Phil Bennett taking over for the bowl 
game. On December 16, 2010, Mike Haywood, previously head football coach 
at Miami (OH), was introduced as Wannstedt's replacement as head coach.[92] 
At his introductory press conference, athletic director Steve Pederson 
said Haywood was "a man of integrity and character and will be a true inspirational 
leader for our football team."[92] However, Haywood's arrest on domestic 
violence charges in South Bend, Indiana on December 31, two weeks and two 
days later, prompted Pitt to fire him the following day.[93] Haywood never 
coached a game, recruited a player, led a practice or even hired an assistant 
coach at Pitt. His sixteen-day tenure at Pitt is the second shortest in 
FBS history (only to George O'Leary's five-day tenure at Notre Dame).[94] 
Despite the turmoil, Bennett led the Panthers to a 27–10 bowl victory over 
Kentucky on January 8, 2011.[95] Following the bowl win, Pitt announced 
Tulsa head coach Todd Graham as the new head coach of the Panthers.[96] 
At his introductory press conference, Graham talked about how Pitt was 
a "dream come true" and that he would work hard every day to "gain everyone's 
trust" and that he would coach his players to do the same.[97] Graham instituted 
a sweeping change of offensive and defensive philosophies[98] but staggered 
to a 6–6 regular season. However, major news for the university was announced 
in September of that season when Pitt accepted an invitation to join the 
Atlantic Coast Conference effective July 1, 2013.[99] On December 14, 2011, 
less than one year after being hired, Graham shocked Pitt when he resigned 
to take the head coaching position at Arizona State.[100] Defensive coordinator 
Keith Patterson was named as the interim head coach for the BBVA Compass 
Bowl,[101] which the Panthers lost to Southern Methodist by a score of 
28–6.[102] On December 22, 2011, Wisconsin offensive coordinator Paul Chryst 
was introduced as the head coach[103] and lead the Panthers in their final 
season of the Big East which included another appearance in the BBVA Compass 
Bowl and a 6–7 final record.[104] Chryst was the Panthers' fourth head 
football coach since December 2010 (sixth counting interims).[103] Chryst 
led Pitt into the Atlantic Coast Conference where the program competed 
in the conference's Coastal Division during the 2013 season. The Panthers 
again posted a 6–6 record in the 2013 regular season and accepted an invitation 
to the Little Caesar's Pizza Bowl, where they defeated Bowling Green 30–27.[105] 
On December 17, 2014, Chryst was announced as the new head coach at Wisconsin; 
athletic director Steve Pederson was fired on the same day as Chryst's 
departure.[106] On December 17, 2014 Joe Rudolph was named interim coach 
for the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl against the University of Houston.[107] 
On December 26, 2014 Pat Narduzzi, defensive coordinator for Michigan State, 
was named the new head football coach. He went 8–5 in his first season 
as the head football coach, the Panthers best record since 2009.[108] During 
the 2015 season, Pitt was ranked in the AP top 25 for the first time since 
2010. The team first played at Recreation Park. Beginning in 1900, the 
Panthers played their games at Exposition Park on the North Shore of Pittsburgh, 
sharing the stadium with the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1909 the Panthers, 
along with the Pirates, moved to Forbes Field, located on campus, where 
they played until 1924. In 1925, Pitt Stadium was completed on the opposite 
end of the campus, giving the Panthers their only private stadium. Pitt 
Stadium was home for the Panthers although the Steelers also used it for 
home games in the mid-1960s. Following the demolition of Pitt Stadium in 
1999, the Panthers moved to Three Rivers Stadium, again on the North Shore, 
where the Pirates and Steelers had played since 1970. A handful of nationally 
televised Pitt Panther football games from the late 1970s to 1999 were 
played as home games not at Pitt Stadium but at Three Rivers with its more 
modern facilities. Heinz Field opened in 2001, where the Panthers currently 
play as a co-tenant with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Panthers' practice 
facility is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sports Performance 
Complex which is also shared with the Steelers. Pitt football has been 
involved in several notable first-time occurrences in the history of college 
football, including: The Panther (Felis concolor) was adopted by the university 
as its official athletic mascot by a group of students and alumni in 1909. 
The suggestion to adopt the Panther as mascot was made by George M. P. 
Baird, Class of 1909. Over 20 representations of panthers can be found 
in and around the university's campus and athletic facilities, including 
outside Heinz Field. Students, alumni, and fans rub the nose of one Panther 
statue in particular, the Millennium Panther located outside the William 
Pitt Union, in order to bring good luck to the football team prior to games.[114] 
This tradition was featured in a national television advertisement for 
the 2012 Hyundai Tucson automobile.[115] In addition, a costumed mascot, 
named "Roc", performs with the Pitt Cheerleaders at various athletic and 
non-athletic university events. Among the oldest traditions is the Official 
University Yell, dating to 1890, that has survived as lyrics within the 
fight song "Hail to Pitt". This song, along with the Pitt Victory Song, 
and The Panther Song, are the most common of Pitt fight songs performed 
on game days by the Pitt Band. The Pitt Band also participates in the "Panthers 
Prowl" which begins two hours before kickoff and allows fans to meet the 
team as they make their way into Heinz Field outside Gate A. Originally, 
this tradition began as players made their way into Pitt Stadium.[116][117] 
One hour prior to kick off, the Pitt Band also engages in the "March to 
Victory" from Tony Dorsett Drive down General Robinson Street and ending 
at the stage on Art Rooney Avenue. This tradition dates back to before 
the move to Heinz Field when the Pitt Band would march throughout the streets 
of Oakland campus before arriving at Pitt Stadium.[116][117] In addition, 
at halftime, the band typically will play in at least one formation spelling 
out "PITT". Other football traditions include: During the late 1990s, athletic 
director Steve Pederson instituted a rebranding of the Pitt Stadium student 
section in an attempt to bolster enthusiasm and unity by emphasizing the 
12th man concept. The stadium was repainted with the student section changed 
to section "12" and a large inflatable jersey bearing number 12 was placed 
near the section. Upon the move to Heinz Field, the athletic department, 
in collaboration with their sideline apparel outfitter at the time Aéropostale, 
created the Aero-Zone. The Aero-Zone served as an exclusive on-field seating 
section for Pitt students where the first 200 students who lined up for 
the section before the game with student were admitted if they possessed 
tickets and proper identification.[123] The Aero-Zone failed to catch sustained 
interest and was eventually discontinued. Other groups also attempted to 
create a more unified student section for football.[124] The current official 
Pitt football student fan club and cheering section, the Panther Pitt, 
was founded in 2003 by Pitt students Robin Frank and Julie Brennan to attempt 
to organize an Oakland Zoo-like atmosphere at Heinz Field for football 
games. The Panther Pitt helped in coordinating student ticking policies 
with the athletic department and the Oakland Zoo.[125][126] In 2006, the 
Panther Pitt and the Pitt Student Government Board originated the concept 
of "Code Blue" in which students wear blue T-shirts to the game to match 
the home blue uniforms of the Pitt football team.[127][128] During some 
seasons, these shirts were commonly worn by students attending football 
games with the back of "Code-Blue" T-shirts typically include the line 
"Alle-genee-genac-genac" from the Official University Yell. In 2013, ESPN 
recognized the Panther Pitt as one of the nation's best college football 
student sections.[129] For years, Pitt's most heated and longest standing 
rival had been in-state foe Penn State. The first Pitt-Penn State game 
was played in 1893. The game has been played 97 times, with Penn State 
holding a 50–43–4 edge in the series. After a 16-year hiatus, the rivalry 
was renewed on September 10, 2016, with Pitt earning a 42-39 victory. Efforts 
to renew the rivalry have been mired in difficulties. It is widely believed 
and well documented that Paterno was not in favor of resuming the series 
despite the University of Pittsburgh having long been open to resuming 
the series on a home and away basis.[130] A four-game renewal of the series 
has been scheduled for 2016–19.[85] Pitt won the first game of this series 
42-39. One of Pitt's fiercest rivals has been with the West Virginia Mountaineers. 
Dubbed the Backyard Brawl, the rivalry was first played in 1895 and is 
one of the oldest and most played in college football. Of historic note, 
the 1921 Backyard Brawl was the first live radio broadcast of a college 
football game in the United States. On November 10, 1979, the Backyard 
Brawl was the last college football game played at old Mountaineer Field 
in Morgantown, West Virginia, with the Panthers prevailing 24–17. Through 
the 2011 season, Pitt and West Virginia have met on the gridiron a total 
of 104 times with Pitt holding a 61–40–3 edge in the series. In September 
2015 it was announced the series will renew for the 2022–2025 seasons.[131] 
Other longstanding rivals include Notre Dame and Syracuse; both schools 
are tied as the third most played rivalry for Pitt. The series with Notre 
Dame began in 1909, and since that time no more than two consecutive seasons 
have passed without the teams meeting each other with the exception of 
the periods from 1913–1929, 1938–1942, and 1979–1981. Notre Dame currently 
leads the series 48–21–1. Games between Pitt and the Irish had typically 
been scheduled annually, however, Notre Dame's agreement to play five ACC 
opponents each year starting in 2014 precluded annual games, so Pitt and 
Notre Dame will meet no more than twice during a three-year period.[132] 
The rivalry with fellow ACC conference member Syracuse began in 1916, and 
has been played annually since 1955, with the Panthers leading the series 
37–31–3. Pitt and Syracuse also shared membership in the Big East Conference 
from 1991 to 2012 before both schools simultaneously moved to the ACC where 
they are designated as cross-divisional rivals and are scheduled to meet 
annually. Pitt and Navy recently renewed their rivalry, which began in 
1912, and was played 26 times in 29 years between 1961 and 1989. Played 
consecutively between 2007 and 2009, and again in 2013, the series now 
stands with Pitt leading 22–14–3.[133] Of historic interest, it was during 
the Pitt-Navy game at Annapolis on October 23, 1976, that Pitt running 
back Tony Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record. When the University 
of Cincinnati joined the Big East Conference in 2005, the game between 
Pitt and the Bearcats was designated as the River City Rivalry with the 
annual winner of the game being awarded the Paddlewheel Trophy. Each team 
won four games during the eight-year span that both schools shared membership 
in the Big East. Pitt leads the series 8–4. The series will be renewed 
in 2023 and 2024.[134] Older rivalries against cross-town schools Duquesne 
and Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University), as well as Washington 
& Jefferson, ended following the de-emphasizing of the football programs 
at those institutions. The University of Pittsburgh claims nine National 
Championships: 1915, 1916, 1918, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, 1937, and 1976[4] 
out of a total of 12 seasons[n 4] that it has been selected as a national 
champion by a "major selector" as determined by the Official NCAA Records 
Book[136] and out of 16 seasons that it has been named the National Champion 
by at least one selector according to research by the College Football 
Data Warehouse.[30] The university bases its claim for the first eight 
national championships on a study conducted in 1970 by Sports Illustrated.[4][43] 
These championships, together with its unanimous championship of 1976, 
are the basis for the university's claim of nine national championship 
seasons. Combining CFBDW research with the Official NCAA RecordsBook and 
Sports Illustrated study, Pitt has been recognized as the National Champion 
by at least one selector in 17 different seasons.[n 5] Using the research 
compiled by Sports Illustrated, the nine National Championships claimed

According to the Official NCAA Division 1 Football Records Book, Pitt has 
been named a national champion by a "Major Selector" in 11 separate seasons.[137] 
The seasons listed in the NCAA Records Book include: 1910 • 1915 • 1916

Data Warehouse lists nine recognized national championship seasons in which 
the University of Pittsburgh was named a National Champion. CFBDW lists 
the Joe Thompson coached 1910 undefeated and unscored upon team as a recognized 
National Champion, whereas the university does not claim this championship. 
However, CFBDW does not list the 1934 season, claimed by Pitt, as a recognized 
championship season. The following nine seasons are the years Pitt is listed 
as a Recognized National Champion in College Football Data Warehouse:[138] 
1910 • 1915 • 1916 • 1918 • 1929 • 1931 • 1936 • 1937 • 1976 According 
to research conducted by College Football Data Warehouse, in 10 additional 
seasons to the ones listed above, at least one selector of national championships 
has declared Pitt as its National Champion for a total of 16 selections.

1976 • 1980 • 1981 Since the advent of the AP Poll in 1936, Pitt has been 
selected as its National Champion twice, in 1937 and 1976. It should be 
noted that until the 1968 college football season, the final AP poll of 
the season was released following the end of the regular season, with the 
exception of the 1965 season, and did not consider the results of bowl 
games. The other major national poll, the Coaches' Poll, began in 1950 
and has selected Pitt as its National Champion once, in 1976. The following 
table summarizes the source and totals for Pitt's national championship 
seasons. Pitt has had eight undefeated seasons. Six of the eight seasons 
are perfect seasons with no ties. Of the eight undefeated seasons, four 
are not claimed as national championship seasons by Pitt. Pitt football 
finished the season undefeated in: 1904 (10–0) • 1910 (9–0) • 1915 (8–0) 
• 1916 (8–0) • 1917 (10–0) • 1920 (6–0–2) • 1937 (9–0–1) • 1976 (12–0)

1980 • 1981 For much of its history, Pitt played as an independent, as 
did the majority of what are now labeled as Division I FBS football-playing 
schools located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. During this time, Eastern 
Championships were named by independent third party selectors and awarded 
of various trophies, such as the early Jolly Trophy awarded by the Philadelphia-based 
Veteran Athletic Organization which presented it to the team with the best 
record in the East.[139] The process of picking an Eastern Champion eventually 
came to be symbolized by the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy awarded by the 
New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority beginning in 1936. The Lambert-Meadowlands 
trophy, which is still awarded, is presented to the team deemed to be the 
best that located in the East or plays half its schedule against eligible 
Lambert teams. In total, Pitt has won 12 Eastern Championships.[58] In 
addition, in 1991, the majority of football independents in the East aligned
