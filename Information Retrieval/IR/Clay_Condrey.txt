Clayton Lee Condrey (born November 19, 1975) is a former Major League Baseball 
relief pitcher. Condrey featured five pitches: a sinker, cutter, curveball, 
changeup, and a four-seam fastball. The right-handed pitcher played at 
Navasota High School and McNeese State University. The New York Yankees 
selected Condrey in the 94th round, with selection No. 1,730 of the 1996 
Major League Baseball draft out of Angelina (Texas) Junior College. Condrey 
would eventually sign with the San Diego Padres in 1998. He was signed 
by then-Padres scout Theo Epstein. Condrey pitched with the San Diego Padres 
in the 2002 and 2003 seasons before he moved to the Phillies in the offseason. 
In the Padres organization as a starter, Clay started 43 games between 
the Triple-A Portland Beavers and the major leagues, giving up 118 earned 
runs in 257.1 innings (ERA of 4.13). Condrey pitched his entire 2004 season 
for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the International 
League, where he led the team in starts and innings pitched (28 ST, 162 
IP), compiling an ERA of 5.50. His 2005 campaign dropped slightly in appearances, 
where he appeared in only 24 starts (132.1 IP), but he subsequently lowered 
his ERA to 4.15. After being converted to relief, he was off to a strong 
start in 2006 as well, allowing only 3 earned runs in eight appearances, 
but was called up to the Phillies in May. Condrey began the 2007 season 
on the Phillies' active roster, but on April 14, 2007, Condrey was designated 
for assignment by the Phillies to make room on the roster for starting 
pitcher Freddy García, who had been on the DL since the end of spring training. 
Condrey would be designated for assignment three other times, up until 
August 3, 2007, when he was recalled from Triple-A Ottawa for his fifth 
stint of the season with the Phillies. Condrey was included on the postseason 
roster for the National League East Champion Phillies in 2007 and appeared 
in Game 2 of the NLDS against the Colorado Rockies. In 2008, Condrey made 
the Phillies' Opening Day squad and pitched well in middle-relief. In accordance 
with one of the oddities of the baseball rulebook, he earned a save in 
a 12–2 Phillies victory over the Nationals on May 21 by pitching three 
innings in relief of Jamie Moyer and not surrendering the lead, though 
he entered the game with the Phillies leading by twelve runs. Philadelphia 
won its second straight NL East title in 2008, and Condrey was again part 
of the postseason roster. He appeared in Game 3 of the NLDS against the 
Milwaukee Brewers and Game 3 of the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
Condrey would get a World Series ring as the Phillies defeated the Tampa 
Bay Rays in five games. Though still part of the active roster, Condrey 
did not appear in any World Series games. Condrey went 6-2 with one save 
and a 3.00 ERA in 45 appearances for the Phillies in 2009, but was not 
included on the postseason roster as Philadelphia returned to the World 
Series before falling to the Yankees in six games. On December 12, 2009, 
Condrey was non-tendered by the Phillies and became a free agent. On January 
6, 2010, Condrey signed a one-year deal with the Minnesota Twins.[1] but 
experienced some elbow discomfort at the beginning of the season and did
