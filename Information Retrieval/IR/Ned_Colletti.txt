Ned Louis Colletti, Jr. is an American sports executive. He is the senior 
adviser to the president of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was general manager 
of the Dodgers from 2006 through 2014. Before moving to the Dodgers, he 
was assistant general manager of the San Francisco Giants.[1] Colletti 
graduated from East Leyden High School in Franklin Park, Illinois, and 
attended Triton College before graduating from Northern Illinois University. 
He was inducted into the Triton College Sports Hall of Fame in 1993, the 
same year as the Major League players Kirby Puckett, Lance Johnson and 
Jeff Reboulet.[2] In 1982, Colletti began his Major League career with 
the Chicago Cubs. He was a member of the front office when the Cubs won 
the National League East in 1984 and 1989. Colletti was honored with Major 
League Baseball's Robert O. Fishel Award for Public Relations Excellence 
in 1990.[3] Colletti left the Cubs and joined the front office of the San 
Francisco Giants in 1994 as director of baseball operations. He was promoted 
to assistant general manager in October 1996. During his tenure, the Giants 
had an 813–644 overall record (.558), winning an average of 90.3 games 
per season. He was hired by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2005.[4] During 
his tenure with the Dodgers (2005-2014), Colletti had the highest winning 
percentage of any general manager in the National League. Colletti became 
the 10th general manager in Los Angeles Dodgers history and the fifth in 
eight years when he was hired on November 16, 2005.[5] The Dodgers made 
the playoffs in five of his nine seasons from 2006–14. Only once in Colletti's 
nine seasons did the Dodgers have a losing record. Los Angeles went to 
the NL Division Series in Colletti's first season in 2006 and reached the 
National League Championship Series in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The back-to-back 
appearances in 2008–09 marked the first time the Dodgers had reached the 
NLCS in consecutive years since 1977–78.[6] The Dodgers won 15 playoff 
games from 1989–2014. Fourteen of those playoff wins came under Colletti. 
The only other Dodger post-season win in that period came in the 2004 NL 
Division Series under then-GM Dan Evans.[7] During six of Colletti's nine 
seasons, the Dodgers set home attendance records. The Dodgers averaged 
3,606,151 fans per season in Colletti's nine seasons with the Dodgers. 
The Dodgers led all of Major League Baseball in home and road attendance 
in 2013 and led, again, in home attendance in 2014 with 3,782,337 fans.[8] 
In 2010, under Colletti's leadership, the Dodgers were named Topps Organization 
of the Year, an honor presented annually to the Major League franchise 
that has shown most-outstanding performance, depth and talent among its 
Major and Minor League teams.[9] In the nine seasons from the start of 
Colletti's career as general manager through 2014, the Dodgers had a 783–674 
(.537) record—the third-best record in the National League. Only the Cardinals 
(.542) and Phillies (.538) were better. Among NL West teams, the Dodgers' 
record during that stretch was 40 games better than second-best San Francisco 
Giants. Colletti reached 750 wins as a general manager on July 29, 2014, 
when the Dodgers defeated the Atlanta Braves 3–2 in 10 innings at Dodger 
Stadium before a crowd of 47,386. Only Buzzie Bavasi reached the 750-win 
mark faster in Dodger history.[10] His 783 wins from 2006–14 were most 
among all National League general managers. From June to December 2012, 
Colletti, with the backing of a new, aggressive ownership team led by Dodgers' 
president Stan Kasten, owners Mark Walter, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Peter 
Guber, and Guggenheim Baseball Management, spent more than $600 million 
to bring a parade of all-star players and prospects to Los Angeles. The 
wholesale makeover began in late June when the Dodgers spent $42 million 
to sign 21-year-old Cuban prospect Yasiel Puig to a six-year deal. On July 
25, Colletti brought in former National League batting champion Hanley 
Ramirez as the key to a four-player trade with the Miami Marlins.[11] On 
August 25, 2012, with the Dodgers three games behind the Giants in the 
National League West and 1½ games out of the final wild card spot, Colletti 
completed a nine-player trade that the Los Angeles Times called a "block-buster" 
and a "stunning development".[12] Key to the deal was the acquisition of 
four-time All-Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez from the Boston Red Sox. 
But the Dodgers also obtained the four-time All-Star outfielder Carl Crawford, 
three-time All-Star pitcher Josh Beckett, and respected, switch-hitting 
utility infielder Nick Punto. The Red Sox received first-baseman James 
Loney and four prospects, including infielder Iván DeJesús, Jr. and pitcher 
Allen Webster. The Boston Globe's Dan Shaughnessy called it "the biggest 
Red Sox trade since Babe Ruth was dealt to the Yankees for cash in 1920",.[13] 
After ending the season 86–76, but failing to make the playoffs, the Dodgers 
were active on the free-agent market, signing starting pitchers Zack Greinke, 
a former Cy Young winner, and Ryu Hyun-jin,[14] who had been an All-Star 
in each of his seven seasons in the Korea Baseball Organization from 2006-12. 
Greinke, who won the Cy Young with Kansas City in 2009, provided the Dodgers 
with what MLB.com called "unprecedented starting pitching depth."[15] On 
October 14, 2014, he was removed from his position as General Manager of 
the Dodgers after the Dodgers failed to advance to the World Series despite 
a 2014 opening day payroll more than $30 million higher than any other 
MLB team, and $55 million higher than any other National League team.[16] 
Colletti remained with the team in a new position as Senior Adviser to 
the President.[17] In addition, Colleti would be added to the Sportsnet 
LA broadcast team. Colletti was a top front office executive – either an 
assistant general manager (AGM) or general manager (GM) – continuously 
from 1997 until 2014 with two clubs, the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles 
Dodgers. Only five other GMs[18] served continuously, either as an AGM 
or a GM, from 1997-2014. Of the six GMs who served continuously for the 
past 18 seasons as assistant general manager or general manager, only Brian 
Cashman of the New York Yankees had a higher winning percentage. Colletti 
is active in several community and charity efforts in Los Angeles. He and 
the Dodgers have partnered with Guide Dogs of America to sponsor lifelong 
working partners for the visually impaired. In October 2011, Colletti joined 
radio personality Peter Tilden and Colletti's fri[19] ends from the band 
Chicago, who played a benefit concert that raised funds for Guide Dogs 
of America and the Foundation for Fighting Blindness.[20] Colletti received 
a prestigious Humanitarian Award from A Place Called Home, located in South 
Central Los Angeles, which provides at-risk youth with a secure, positive 
environment. The Los Angeles City College Foundation also honored Colletti 
for his work with youth.[21] On October 23, 2012, the Los Angeles City 
College Foundation honored Colletti for his work with youth.[22] Vicki 
Santo, widow of Cubs' Hall of Fame legend Ron Santo, and Colletti established 
a foundation RonSantoFoundation.com to place service dogs with people suffering 
from diabetes. The dogs are trained to alert their human partners when 
their blood sugar is low, helping prevent sudden, unexpected onsets of 
hypoglycemia that can be devastating. Actors Tim Robbins and Helen Mirren 
worked with Colletti to raise more than $100,000 from 2011 to 2013 for 
Get Lit, a city program designed to provide youth with opportunities to 
develop an appreciation for literature, writing, reading and poetry.[23] 
As an advisory board member of Vision To Learn, Colletti works with the 
organization founded by Austin Beutner to provide eye examinations and 
free glasses to poverty-stricken, urban youth in some of the hardest-to-reach 
communities. Vision To Learn has screened more than 120,000 kids in Los 
Angeles and Sacramento, provided over 20,000 with eye exams and more than
