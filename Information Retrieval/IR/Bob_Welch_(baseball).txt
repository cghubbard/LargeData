Robert Lynn "Bob" Welch (November 3, 1956 – June 9, 2014) was an American 
professional baseball starting pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1978–87) and Oakland Athletics (1988–94). 
Prior to his professional career, he attended Eastern Michigan University, 
where he played college baseball for the Eastern Michigan Hurons baseball 
team.[1] He helped lead the Hurons, coached by Ron Oestrike, to the 1976 
College World Series, losing to Arizona in the Championship Game. Welch 
was a two time MLB All-Star, and he won the American League Cy Young Award 
as the league's best pitcher in 1990. He was a member of three World Series 
champion teams. He is the last pitcher to win at least 25 games in a single 
season (27 in 1990).[1] In a 17-year career, Welch compiled a 211–146 record 
with 1,969 strikeouts and a 3.47 ERA in 3,092 innings. His 137 wins during 
the 1980s was third among major league pitchers during that decade, following 
Jack Morris and Dave Stieb. Welch gained national fame with Los Angeles 
in 1978, when as a 21-year-old rookie he struck out Reggie Jackson with 
two men on base and two out in the top of the ninth inning of Game 2 of 
the 1978 World Series against the New York Yankees. On May 29, 1980, Welch 
pitched a 3–0 one-hitter against the Atlanta Braves, facing the minimum 
27 batters. The only Atlanta base runner was Larvell Blanks, who singled 
in the 4th inning and was retired on a double play. Welch was the third 
starting pitcher in the rotation for the 1989 World Series champion Oakland 
A's, compiling a regular-season record of 17-8 and recording a win in his 
only start in the American League Championship Series against the Toronto 
Blue Jays. In an odd twist of fate, however, Welch did not throw a single 
pitch against the San Francisco Giants during the World Series itself. 
Just minutes before Welch was to take the mound in Game 3, Candlestick 
Park and the Bay Area were struck by the Loma Prieta earthquake, which 
caused extensive damage in the region and forced the postponement of the 
game. When the Series was resumed 11 days later, A's manager Tony La Russa 
opted to re-use his Game 1 starter, Dave Stewart, for Game 3 in place of 
Welch, and his Game 2 starter, Mike Moore, for Game 4 in place of originally 
scheduled starter Storm Davis. The strategy worked, as the A's swept the 
Series in four games. For obvious reasons, the 1989 World Series was also 
known as the "Earthquake Series". A two-time All-Star (1980 and 1990), 
Welch won 14 or more games in eight years, with a career-high 27 in 1990. 
He received the Cy Young Award that season, and was considered in the MVP 
vote. His 27 wins were the most by any pitcher since Steve Carlton also 
won 27 in 1972, and currently stands as the last time a pitcher has won 
25 or more games in a season (the closest anyone has come to that mark 
since is 24, accomplished by John Smoltz in 1996, Randy Johnson in 2002, 
and Justin Verlander in 2011). The last pitcher to win more games in a 
season was Denny McLain, with 31 wins in 1968.[2] 19 of his wins were saved 
by Dennis Eckersley, which remains a record.[3] Welch was the starting 
pitcher of Game 2 of the 1990 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. 
Welch's personal catcher throughout much of his Oakland Athletics career 
was Ron Hassey, as opposed to Terry Steinbach, who caught the majority 
of the Oakland pitching staff. Welch was the pitching coach for the Arizona 
Diamondbacks when they won the World Series in 2001.[1] During the 2006 
World Baseball Classic, Welch served as the pitching coach for The Netherlands. 
His son Riley Welch was a 34th round selection by the Oakland A's in the 
2008 MLB draft out of Desert Mountain high school in Scottsdale, Arizona 
but did not sign and went on to play college baseball at the University 
of Hawaii. Riley then signed as an undrafted free agent with the Dodgers.[4] 
He became a pitching coach at Presentation College, an NAIA school in Aberdeen, 
South Dakota in 2014.[5] Welch was a pitching coach in the Oakland Athletics 
organization at the time of his death.[6] In 1981, Welch and New York Times 
sports columnist George Vecsey co-wrote Five O'Clock Comes Early: A Cy 
Young Award-Winner Recounts His Greatest Victory, which chronicled Welch's 
battle with alcoholism that he said started at the age of 16. "I would 
get a buzz on and I would stop being afraid of girls. I was shy, but with 
a couple of beers in me, it was all right."[1] The book "...marked one 
of the first times an active professional athlete openly discussed a drinking 
addiction."[1] An updated version was published after Welch's retirement. 
The book was rereleased digitally on November 10, 2015 Welch died of a 
broken neck resulting from an accidental fall in his bathroom June 9, 2014
