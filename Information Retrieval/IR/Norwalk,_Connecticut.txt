by authority of a municipal charter, granted by the Connecticut General 
Assembly, which is the legal document that defines the organization, powers, 
functions, and essential procedures of the city government.[12] Norwalk's 
municipal government is a Weak-mayor form of a Mayor-Council government[13] 
with the mayor of Norwalk elected by its voters. The city's charter gives 
certain administrative powers exclusively to the Council and others jointly 
to the Council and Mayor. The Common Council is the law-writing body of 
the City of Norwalk. Norwalk's common council consists of fifteen council 
members, five elected at-large and ten elected by district, two from each 
district. Administration offices are located at 125 East Avenue in Norwalk 
City Hall. Norwalk is represented in the Connecticut General Assembly by 
five House Representatives corresponding to five Connecticut legislative 
districts and one senator from one Connecticut Senate district.[14][15] 
Norwalk, which lies within Connecticut's 4th congressional district is 
represented in The United States Congress by one congressional representative 
in the United States House of Representatives and, along with the rest 
of Connecticut, by two Senators in the United States Senate. The population 
of Norwalk in 2010 was reported by the U.S. Census at 85,603.[16] A population 
estimation indicates 87,214 people resided in Norwalk as of 2014, an approximate 
population growth of one percent. The estimate indicates a racially diverse 
population of 42,768 males (49%) and 44,446 females (51%).[17] The racial 
makeup of Norwalk was[when?] 55.7% White, 13.4% Black, 0.1% Native American, 
4.7% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.3 from some other race and 1.4% from

Places include the Norwalk Green Historic District (roughly bounded by 
Smith and Park Streets, Boston Post Road, East and Morgan Avenues). The 
district contains examples of Federal Style, Greek Revival, and Late Victorian 
architecture. (added 1987)[24] Another local site on the Register is the 
Former Joseph Loth Company Building (25 Grand St.). The 133,000-square-foot 
(12,400 m2) building, since renovated as an apartment building and renamed 
"Clocktower Close" in the mid-1980s, has an 85-foot (26 m)-high Romanesque 
Revival clocktower[25] (added 1984) These other sites are also on the Register: 
the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion (added 1970), the former Rock Ledge estate

2010. Baseball and softball are popular amateur sports with active leagues 
across many age groups in Norwalk. There are 4 baseball fields and 16 Little

rowing team in the 2008 Summer Olympics.[35] There are three golf courses 
in the city of Norwalk.[36] The cross town rivalry between the city's two 
largest high schools' sports teams can be rather fierce, particularly for 
the football, soccer and field hockey teams in the fall; as well as lacrosse, 
baseball, and softball teams in the spring. Brien McMahon high school's 
football team won the FCIAC (Fairfield County InterAthletic Conference) 
and Class M State Football championship in 1994. McMahon high school's 
boys lacrosse team went on to win the state division 2 lacrosse championship 
in 2000. In professional team sports, Norwalk is represented by the Connecticut 
Wildcats in the American National Rugby League. Public transport bus service 
within Norwalk is provided by Norwalk Transit District, also known as Wheels. 
Norwalk Transit District operates fixed route public bus service in Norwalk 
and Westport with Evening and Sunday shuttles (serving South Norwalk, Main 
Avenue and Connecticut Avenue), Services for the Elderly & People with 
Disabilities and Commuter Shuttles. Access to regional bus services include 
Coastal Link (Norwalk-Milford), 7 Link (Norwalk-Danbury) and Rt 41 (Norwalk-Stamford). 
All fixed route buses meet at the Wheels Hub located on Burnell Boulevard, 
between Main St and Belden Ave. Metro-North’s New Haven Line runs through 
and stops in Norwalk. The Danbury Branch runs from South Norwalk to Danbury, 
CT. There are four stations in Norwalk, three of them on the main line 
which is: Rowayton, South Norwalk and East Norwalk. The fourth station, 
Merritt 7, is on the Danbury Branch. Metro-North provides commuter service 
for all four stations.[37] A fare to any station on the New Haven line 
from South Norwalk cost less than $15 USD per adult.[38] Interstate 95 
in Connecticut and Merritt Parkway lead through Norwalk, and there are 
several exits within the Norwalk city limits. Both of these roads are designated 
to be north/south routes, although both lead east/west in Connecticut. 
The major north-south corridor in Norwalk is U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut 
which can be accessed via Interstate 95 in Connecticut, both northbound 
and southbound, via Exit 15. Traveling north on the U.S. Route 7 expressway, 
exit 3 leads to Merritt Parkway southbound only and access to northbound 
Merritt Parkway can be made via Route 123 and Norwalk's Main Ave/Street 
from exit 2. Traveling south, the half-built exit 3 also leads to the Merritt 
Parkway southbound only. There is no direct northbound access to the Merritt 
Parkway, traveling south, from this expressway. Northbound the expressway 
section ends at Grist Mill Road in Norwalk from where Route 7 resumes northbound 
along Norwalk's Main Avenue. Traveling south, access to Interstate 95, 
both north and south, can be accomplished via their respective exits. Other 
state highways in Norwalk are Route 53, Route 123, and Route 136. Electric 
power and natural gas in most of Norwalk is provided by Eversource Energy. 
The First Taxing District[39] provides water to the Third, Fourth and Fifth 
Taxing Districts.[40] The Second Taxing District[41] serves sections of 
South Norwalk, East Norwalk, West Norwalk, Rowayton and Silvermine.[41] 
and also owns and operates South Norwalk Electric and Water.[42] The Third 
Taxing District[43] provides electric power for East Norwalk. The districts 
purchase wholesale power and arrange for its delivery to, and distribution 
within, their respective districts. Power lines and meters in East Norwalk, 
South Norwalk, and parts of Rowayton are maintained by the districts. Both 
the second (SNEW) and third (TTD) district electric departments belong 
to the six member Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative which 
pools their wholesale power purchasing to obtain lower rates for their 
customers.[44] Connecticut Light and Power [now: Eversource Energy] operated 
a power plant, Norwalk Harbor Station on Manresa Island, from 1960 to 1999 
when it was acquired by NRG Energy, which then began its deactivation in 
2013.[45] In 2004 the third taxing district installed 3 diesel powered 
generators at the Norden complex on Norden Place that were initially licensed 
only for emergency power supply. By summer 2008 the generators, with a 
combined capacity of 6 Megawatts, had been upgraded to allow licensed operation 
as regular power providers for the grid (not just emergency power).[46] 
In 2007 and 2008 the construction of the Middletown-Norwalk transmission 
line disrupted traffic along the Boston Post Road, but the completion of 
the line is hoped to help provide additional power to lower Fairfield County. 
In addition a high-voltage undersea line runs from Manressa Island to Long 
Island to help provide electric power to Long Island Power Authority customers. 
In 2008 the city government of Norwalk started initial investigations of 
whether the city might resume generating power for sale to electricity 
customers in the city.[47] Norwalk is served 24/7 by Norwalk Hospital and 
Norwalk Hospital EMS, a progressive 911 paramedic service. The service 
consists of hospital based paramedics and EMT-Is who serve Norwalk as well 
as New Canaan, Wilton, Weston, and Westport. The service responded to over 
9,500 medical emergencies in 2008 in the city of Norwalk and 6,000 in the 
neighboring communities. Norwalk Hospital EMS is widely known as one of 
the top services in the state and region. Typically the ambulances respond 
out of Norwalk Hospital as the paramedics and EMT-I assist in the Emergency 
Department while not in the field. Norwalk Hospital EMS works closely with 
other Norwalk first responders (Norwalk Fire and Police Departments). High
