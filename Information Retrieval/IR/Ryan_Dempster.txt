Ryan Scott Dempster (born May 3, 1977) is a Canadian former professional 
baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida 
Marlins, Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers and Boston Red Sox. 
Dempster batted and threw right-handed. He was both a starter and a reliever 
in his career. On April 22, 2014, Dempster was hired by MLB Network as 
a studio color analyst.[1] He was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the 3rd 
round of the 1995 MLB draft and began his career with the Gulf Coast Rangers. 
He subsequently played for the Hudson Valley Renegades, the Kane County 
Cougars and the Charleston RiverDogs. Dempster was traded to the Florida 
Marlins on August 8, 1996 (with Rick Helling) for John Burkett Dempster 
made his major league debut for the Marlins, working two innings of relief, 
on May 23, 1998 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He allowed three earned 
runs on two hits in that game. He made his first start June 1 against the 
Chicago Cubs, but only lasted 1 1/3 innings as he was shelled for five 
runs while allowing 4 hits (including 2 home runs) and walking 3, to record 
his first career loss. After falling to 0–3 he got his first Major League 
win on June 28 against the Boston Red Sox, when he allowed only 1 run in 
7 innings. He was 1–5 with a 7.08 ERA in 14 appearances (11 starts) that 
season. He started 25 games in 1999 and finished 7–8 with a 4.71 ERA. In 
2000, Dempster was 13–10 with a 3.66 ERA in 33 starts, including 2 complete 
games and 1 shutout. On May 7, 2000, he tossed a one-hitter against the 
New York Mets.[2] He was selected to the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game. His stats slipped a bit in 2001 as he went 15–12 with a 4.94 ERA 
in 34 starts. In 2002 he made 18 starts for the Marlins and was 5–8 with 
a 4.79 ERA. The Marlins traded Dempster to the Cincinnati Reds on July 
11, 2002 for Juan Encarnación, Wilton Guerrero and Ryan Snare. In 15 starts 
the second half of the season, he was 5–5 with a 6.19 ERA. In the 2003 
season, he made 20 starts (and 2 relief appearances) and was 3-7 with a 
6.54 ERA. In August 2003, he underwent Tommy John surgery on his right 
elbow and missed the rest of the season. After his release by the Reds, 
he signed as a free agent with the Chicago Cubs on January 21, 2004. After 
rehabbing from his surgery, he joined the Cubs on August 1 and appeared 
in 23 games, all out of the bullpen. He picked up his first career save 
on September 15, 2004 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 2005, after starting 
6 games, Dempster was named the closer for the Cubs, replacing LaTroy Hawkins. 
He collected 33 saves in 35 opportunities, the best save percentage in 
the league; in both blown saves, he collected the win. He is the only Cub 
and one of just three players ever to both start a game and collect 30 
saves in the same season. On October 1, 2005, the Cubs signed him through 
2008 in a US$15.5 million contract extension.[3][4] He emerged as one of 
the team's most consistent relievers in 2007. At one point, Lou Piniella, 
the Cubs' manager, was considering promoting Dempster to a starting pitcher.[5] 
However, the idea was short lived, as a struggling bullpen forced Dempster 
to remain as closer. He recorded 16 saves in 18 opportunities before missing 
two weeks of playtime on account of an injured oblique muscle.[4] During 
2008 spring training, Dempster's performance resulted in his being designated 
to the third spot on the starting rotation, with the closer job going to 
Kerry Wood. On April 3, 2008, he earned his first win as a home starter 
since a 2002 win with the Marlins against the Cubs.[6] On May 15, 2008, 
Dempster recorded a career high 12 strikeouts in a game. He pitched 8 1⁄3rd 
innings, and gave up only 6 hits. On July 8, 2008 he became the first Cubs 
pitcher in 31 seasons to start 10–0 at home.[7] Dempster finished the season 
with 17–6 record, with 2.96 ERA and 183 strikeouts in 201 and 2/3 innings. 
Dempster threw sliders 32.9% of the time in 2008, more than any other NL 
starting pitcher.[8] Dempster opened the Cubs 2008 postseason campaign 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 26, 2008.[9] Dempster accumulated 
a high pitch count early and, after he was unable to get outs with 0–2 
counts twice, he surrendered a grand slam to James Loney and was pulled 
in favor of Sean Marshall. He led the majors in sacrifice hits, with 19.[10] 
Following the 2008 season, Dempster re-signed with the Cubs for four years 
and a reported $52 million.[11] In May 2009 MLB indicated that the Commissioner's 
Office would review Dempster's up-and-in pitch to Milwaukee Brewers slugger 
Ryan Braun. Cubs manager Lou Piniella commented, "You've got to tie Braun 
up from time to time. If you don't, he's going to feast on you."[12] After 
reviewing the tapes, however, Major League Baseball found no wrongdoing 
on Dempster's part, and decided not to take any action against him.[13] 
Dempster finished the season with a 3.65 ERA and a record of 11–9 in 31 
starts.[14] In 2010 he was 15–12 with a 3.85 ERA in 34 starts and in 2011 
he was 10–14 with a 4.80 ERA in 34 starts. On July 31, 2012 Dempster was 
traded to Texas at the trade deadline, for minor leaguers Christian Villanueva 
and Kyle Hendricks. He made his Rangers debut on August 2, 2012. Dempster 
had a 5.09 ERA with a 7–3 record in 12 games. He pitched 69 innings and 
had 70 strikeouts with the Rangers.[15] Dempster signed a two-year contract 
worth $26.5 million with the Boston Red Sox after the 2012 season.[16] 
He has tied for the most regular season grand slams allowed (11) with Kenny 
Rogers. Dempster has also allowed one in the postseason, for a grand total 
of 12. During a rivalry game against the New York Yankees on August 18, 
2013, Dempster was involved in an incident with Alex Rodriguez. The first 
time he faced Rodriguez, he threw one pitch behind him. Subsequently, Dempster's 
3–0 pitch struck Rodriguez on the left elbow pad and ricocheted off his 
back. Although home plate umpire Brian O'Nora warned Dempster and both 
dugouts, Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later in the top of 
the 6th inning, Dempster gave up a home run to Rodriguez and the Red Sox 
lost the game 9-6.[17] On August 20, MLB gave Dempster a five-game suspension 
(though he did not miss a start) and an undisclosed fine for hitting Rodriguez.[18] 
For years Dempster claimed he didn't mean to hit Rodriguez but finally 
admitted in August 2016 that the incident was intentional.[19] Dempster 
finished the 2013 season 8–9 with a 4.57 ERA in 32 games (29 starts). He 
was part of the 25-man active roster for the postseason making 3 relief 
appearances and won his first championship title when the Red Sox beat 
the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series. On February 16, 2014, 
Dempster announced he would not pitch in 2014, stating that he wanted to 
spend some time with his family. The Red Sox placed Dempster on the restricted 
list for the 2014 season. His salary for 2014 was $13.25 million, but was 
never paid or granted due to his absence.[20] On October 8, 2014, Dempster 
announced his retirement.[21] On December 5, it was announced that Dempster 
would be taking a job in the Cubs' front office as an assistant to general 
manager Jed Hoyer and president of baseball operations Theo Epstein.[22] 
Dempster threw five pitches with some regularity: a four-seam fastball 
and two-seam fastball averaging about 90 mph, a cut fastball in the high 
80s, a slider in the mid 80s, and a splitter in the low 80s. Dempster favored 
his slider over his splitter when throwing to right-handed hitters. He 
often imparted an obvious wiggle to his glove [23] as part of his windup, 
a move he claims is done in order to prevent tipping opposing batters to 
his pitches.[24][25] Dempster is widely known for his laid-back attitude, 
constantly joking with fans and teammates, and is said to be a positive 
contribution to a team's clubhouse. Dempster's fun and easy-going personality 
was especially evident when, in comments to an Arizona newspaper in March 
2007, Dempster stated that if his career as a closer began to tumble, he 
would pursue ninja training.[26] In early June 2009, Dempster released 
a statement explaining that his daughter, Riley Dempster, had DiGeorge 
Syndrome, also known as Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS), 22q11.2 deletion 
syndrome, and Shprintzen syndrome (after Dr. Robert Shprintzen who identified 
it in 1978). About 1 baby in 1800 is born with this genetic deletion which 
ubiquitously affects swallowing, breathing, and speech. Dempster did this 
because he wanted to help raise awareness of this genetic disease. When 
asked if she would lead a normal life, he replied, "Yeah, she will. There 
can be (problems), but so far all the signs are good. There's a lot of 
work to do. They say there are 186 symptoms you can have. You just check 
off ones as you go along." After roughly 2 months in the hospital, Riley
