Secaucus (/ˈsiːkɔːkəs/ SEE-kaw-kus[22][23]) is a town in Hudson County, 
New Jersey, United States. As of the 2010 United States Census, the town's 
population was 16,264,[11][12][13] reflecting an increase of 333 (+2.1%) 
from the 15,931 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn increased 
by 1,870 (+13.3%) from the 14,061 counted in the 1990 Census.[24] Located 
within the New Jersey Meadowlands, it is the most suburban of the county's 
municipalities, though large parts of the town are dedicated to light manufacturing, 
retail, and transportation uses, as well as protected areas.[25] Secaucus 
is a derivation of the Algonquian words for "black" (seke or sukit) and 
"snake" (achgook), or "place of snakes.[26][27] or sekakes, referring to 
snakes.[28] Sikakes, once an island, was part of the territory purchased 
by Director-General of New Netherland, Peter Stuyvesant in 1658.[29] The 
territory was part of what is considered to be the oldest municipality 
in the state of New Jersey which was first chartered in 1660 as Bergen[30] 
in the province of New Netherland and, in 1683, became Bergen Township. 
Settlement had begun by at least 1733 by the Smith family, whose namesake 
Abel I. Smith Burial Ground is part of the lore of Secaucus. Secaucus was 
originally formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
on March 12, 1900, from portions of North Bergen.[31][32] On June 7, 1917, 
Secaucus was incorporated as a town, replacing Secaucus borough, based 
on the results of a referendum held on June 5, 1917.[31] Secaucus was originally 
an agricultural community specializing in flowers. It later became known 
for its pig farms in the first half of the 20th century. In the early 1900s 
the town was home to approximately 55 pig farms, which housed nearly 250,000 
pigs, which outnumbered humans 16 to 1. These farms served the meat demands 
of Newark and New York, and made the farmers wealthy. Many of them were 
local politicians, most notably pork peddler Henry B. Krajewski, who ran 
for New Jersey senator, three times for governor and twice for U.S. President.[33][34] 
The town's pig farms, rendering plants, and junk yards gave the town a 
reputation for being one of the most odorous in the New York metropolitan 
area.[33][35] In the 1950s the pig farms began to dwindle, partially due 
to construction on the New Jersey Turnpike, which would carry tourists 
who would not appreciate the odor.[33] In 1963, debris from the demolition 
of Pennsylvania Station was dumped in the Secaucus Meadowlands. In later 
decades Secaucus became more of a commuter town. In a non-binding referendum 
in 1969, 90% of voters in Secaucus chose to leave Hudson County and join 
Bergen County, as that county was more similar in character and had lower 
taxes. However, only the state has the authority to change county lines, 
so it never came to fruition.[36] Today it remains the most suburban town 
in Hudson County.[34] New Jersey Monthly magazine ranked Secaucus as its 
182nd best place to live in its 2010 rankings of the "Best Places To Live" 
in New Jersey, after ranking the borough 11th in its 2008 rankings.[37] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area 
of 6.599 square miles (17.090 km2), including 5.822 square miles (15.078 km2) 
of it is land and 0.777 square miles (2.012 km2) of water (11.77%) is water.[2][3] 
At the southern end of Secaucus is Snake Hill (officially known as Laurel 
Hill), an igneous rock diabase intrusion jutting up some 150 feet (46 m) 
from the Meadowlands below, near the New Jersey Turnpike.[38] Being partly 
surrounded by the Hackensack Meadowlands, Secaucus provides opportunities 
to observe the recovery of natural marshes in the town's post industrial, 
post agricultural age. Some marsh areas in the northeast part of town have 
been filled to provide a new commercial area, and some to build footpaths 
for nature walks with signs illustrating birds and other wildlife to be 
seen there.[29] Unincorporated communities, localities and place names 
located partially or completely within the town include:[29][39] About 
20% of the town's employed residents commute to New York City to work.[47]

is home to several corporate headquarters, including The Children's Place,[51] 
FiberMedia[52] and Hartz Mountain Industries.[53] Goya Foods previously 
had its headquarters there.[54] According to a 2016 Fundera study, Secaucus 
ranked as the best city in New Jersey for entrepreneurs.[55] In 2011, two 
companies announced that they would be leaving Secaucus. The Manischewitz 
Company announced that it would relocate its administrative offices to 
Newark after being located in Secaucus for seven years.[56] Panasonic's 
North American headquarters, with 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) of offices 
and 500,000 square feet (46,000 m2) of warehouse space, had been located 
in Secaucus since 1973.[57] After considering new locations in New York, 
California and Georgia, the company announced it would relocate to Newark 
and would receive an Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit of $102 million from 
the State of New Jersey for the relocation 8 miles (13 km) from its Secaucus 
location.[58] The company also cited the environmental benefits possible 
by reducing the need of 1,000 employees to drive to work.[59] As of the 
2014–15 NBA season, Secaucus became the official review headquarters of 
the National Basketball Association. All reviews of controversial calls

Secaucus held a pre-Super Bowl "Winter Blast" party during the first weekend 
of February 2014 to celebrate Super Bowl XLVIII being played in New Jersey. 
The party featured a number of activities, including an ice skating rink. 
The town had planned for large crowds, even planning special court sessions 
in advance to handle the projected surge of potentially disruptive visitors. 
The turnout was much lower than expected, with Mayor Gonnelli citing the 
NFL's focus on activities in Manhattan aimed at visitors.[70] Secaucus 
is governed under the Town form of New Jersey municipal government. The 
governing body consists of a Mayor and a Town Council made up of six council 
members elected from three wards. A Mayor is elected at-large directly

Secaucus contains a wide variety of road and rail transportation. Because 
of its central location, many shipping warehouses and truck freight transfer 
stations are located in Secaucus, both for shipping companies such as UPS 
and for numerous retailers. For example, Barnes & Noble's "same day delivery" 
service to Manhattan operates from a warehouse in Secaucus. The town also 
has a large rail yard and multimode terminal run by CSX and Norfolk Southern 
where loads are switched between trains or transferred to or from trucks. 
The town is divided into four by the intersecting roads of Route 3, which 
runs east and west, and the eastern spur of the New Jersey Turnpike (part 
of Interstate 95), which runs north-south, with an interchange (16E/17)

station.[125] As the station is in the south end of Secaucus, access from 
the rest of Secaucus is limited via County Avenue, Meadowlands Parkway 
or NJ Turnpike Interchange 15X. The station opened in December 2003, with 
a 1,100-spot parking lot that allows commuters to park and ride.[126] Discount 
curbside intercity bus service is also provided outside the station by 
Megabus, with direct service to Boston and Philadelphia, among other locations.[127]

at the northeast corner of Secaucus.[129] In the first half of the 20th 
century the Jersey City, Hoboken and Rutherford Electric Railway operated 
a trolley line through the then main business district of Secaucus, on 
Paterson Plank Road from Jersey City and across the Hackensack River to 
East Rutherford. The closest airport with scheduled passenger service is 
Newark Liberty International Airport, which straddles Newark and Elizabeth. 
Secaucus is located within the New York media market, with most of its 
daily papers available for sale or delivery. Local, county and regional 
news is covered by The Jersey Journal, the daily newspaper that relocated 
its offices to Secaucus in 2014 from Jersey City's Journal Square, an area 
of the city that was named for the newspaper that operated there for 90 
years.[130] The Secaucus Reporter is part of the The Hudson Reporter group 
of local weeklies. Locally, the town is served by the Secaucus Home News, 
a weekly newspaper established in 1910.[131] Other weeklies, the River 
View Observer and El Especialito,[132] also cover local news. WWOR-TV, 
channel 9, is a television station licensed to Secaucus, serving the New 
York metro area television market as the flagship station of the MyNetworkTV 
programming service. Its studios and main offices are located in Secaucus.[133] 
The 1987 – 89 talk show The Morton Downey, Jr. Show was among the WWOR-TV 
programs filmed in Secaucus.[134][135][136] The warehouse at 10 Enterprise 
Avenue was used as the primary filming location for the hospital drama 
Mercy, which aired on NBC from 2009–2010.[137] People who were born in,
