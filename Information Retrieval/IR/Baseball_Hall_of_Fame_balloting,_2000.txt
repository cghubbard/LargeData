Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2000 followed the system in 
use since 1995. The Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) voted 
by mail to select from recent major league players and elected two: Carlton 
Fisk and Tony Perez. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions and 
selected three people from multiple classified ballots: Sparky Anderson, 
Bid McPhee, and Turkey Stearnes. Induction ceremonies in Cooperstown, New 
York, were held July 23 with George Grande as emcee. The BBWAA was authorized 
to elect players active in 1980 or later but not after 1994 (final game, 
1980 to 1994). The ballot comprised 30 candidates, 16 returning from the 
1999 ballot, where they received at least 5% support, and 14 on the ballot 
for the first time (†), chosen by a screening committee from players who 
last appeared in 1994. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to 
participate by voting for as many as 10 candidates; any candidate receiving 
votes on at least 75% of the ballots returned would be honored with induction 
to the Hall. Results were announced on January 11, 2000. A total of 499 
ballots were returned so 375 votes were required for election. A total 
of 2813 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.64 per ballot. Candidates 
who received less than 5% support, or 25 votes, would not appear on future 
BBWAA ballots (*). They were also eliminated from future consideration 
by the Veterans Committee of the time, but that possibility was restored 
by new arrangements passed in 2001 and eligibility for the Veterans Committee 
ballot remains unrelated to performance in BBWAA elections after subsequent 
reforms. Two players were elected and 15 with final games played during 
1981–94 were forwarded to next year. The newly-eligible players included 
16 All-Stars, three who were not included on the ballot, representing a 
total of 43 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 9-time All-Star 
Goose Gossage and 5-time All-Stars Steve Sax and Jack Morris. The field 
included two Rookies of the Year (Sax and Rick Sutcliffe) and two Cy Young 
Award winners (Sutcliffe and Bob Welch). Players eligible for the first 
time who were not included on the ballot were: Larry Andersen, Daryl Boston, 
Sid Bream, Tom Brunansky, Storm Davis, Steve Farr, Mike Felder, Joe Hesketh, 
Jay Howell, Mike Jeffcoat, Tim Leary, Craig Lefferts, Kevin McReynolds, 
Bob Melvin, Edwin Núñez, Bob Ojeda, Junior Ortiz, Dan Pasqua, Gary Redus, 
and Harold Reynolds. The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to elect 
as many as two executives, managers, umpires, and older major league players 
--the categories considered in all its meetings since 1953. The older players 
eligible were those with ten major league seasons beginning 1945 or earlier; 
those who received at least 100 votes from the BBWAA in some election up 
to 1990; and those who received at least 60% support in some election beginning 
1991. Players on Major League Baseball's ineligible list were also ineligible 
for election. By an arrangement since 1995 the committee separately considered 
candidates from the Negro Leagues and from the 19th century with authority 
to select one from each of those two special ballots. It elected three 
people, one fewer than the maximum number permitted: manager Sparky Anderson 
from the 1970s, center fielder Turkey Stearnes from the Negro Leagues, 
and second baseman Bid McPhee from the 19th century. Hal Lebovitz received 
the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was 
voted at the December 1999 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 1999, and conferred 
in the summer 2000 ceremonies.) Marty Brennaman received the Ford C. Frick
