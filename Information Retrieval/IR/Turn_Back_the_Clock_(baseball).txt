Turn Back the Clock is the name associated with the promotion by Major 
League Baseball (MLB) franchises when they wear throwback uniforms. Often, 
the uniforms signify a special event in the team or regions history. The 
promotion was originated in 1990 by the Chicago White Sox. Since then, 
multiple other teams have made it a yearly tradition. In 1990, the Chicago 
White Sox set up a "Turn Back the Clock" game against the Milwaukee Brewers.[1] 
The White Sox dressed in 1917 uniforms, while the Brewers wore their normal 
uniforms.[1] The promotion was aimed at celebrating Comiskey Park's final 
season.[1] To set the early baseball atmosphere, ballpark ushers wore dated 
dress and some had megaphones to announce lineups.[1] Also, ticket prices 
for general admission were $.50 and all other tickets were half price.[2] 
The 1917 season was selected because it was the last time (at the time 
of the promotion) that the White Sox won a World Series.[2] The promotion 
was considered successful.[1] The Baltimore Orioles were the second team 
to use the marketing strategy after the Chicago White Sox.[3] In that game, 
against the Minnesota Twins, the Orioles wore attire from the 1966 season 
and bleacher ticket prices were reduced to $.75.[4] After that, the Chicago 
Cubs mimicked the promotion in 1992 wearing throwback uniforms.[5] Likewise, 
the Milwaukee Brewers used the promotion in 1993 by wearing uniforms from 
the 1920s Milwaukee Brewers.[6] Multiple other teams built off the concept 
over the seasons (including the wearing of Negro League uniforms). A faux-back 
Turn Back the Clock game was featured on June 30, 2012, featuring the Tampa 
Bay Rays and the Detroit Tigers wearing uniforms from the 1979 season. 
The Rays, who did not exist as a franchise in 1979 (they were enfranchised 
in 1998), wore specially-designed throwback uniforms for the game, using 
popular design cues of the time such as two-tone caps, colored pants and 
pullover tops. In 1998, the Seattle Mariners marketing team developed a 
concept off the "Turn Back the Clock" promotion. In the "Turn Ahead the 
Clock", the team's uniforms would be transformed into a "futuristic" style. 
The Mariners promotion was successful, and in 1999 it was sold by Major 
League Baseball to Century 21 Real Estate, who made it into a league-wide 
marketing campaign. The league-wide promotion proved unsuccessful despite
