Nashville is the capital of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the county 
seat of Davidson County.[6] It is located on the Cumberland River in the 
north central part of the state. The city is a center for the music, healthcare, 
publishing, banking and transportation industries, and home to numerous 
colleges and universities. Reflecting the city's position in state government, 
Nashville is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for Middle 
Tennessee. It is known as a center of the country music industry, earning 
it the nickname "Music City U.S.A."[7] Since 1963, Nashville has had a 
consolidated city-county government which includes six smaller municipalities 
in a two-tier system. Nashville is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor, and 
40-member Metropolitan Council. Thirty-five of the members are elected 
from single-member districts; five are elected at-large. According to 2015 
estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the total consolidated city-county 
population stood at 678,889.[3] The "balance" population, which excludes 
semi-independent municipalities within Nashville, was 654,610.[5] The 2015 
population of the entire 13-county Nashville metropolitan area was 1,830,345, 
making it the largest metropolitan statistical area in the state.[4] The 
2015 population of the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Columbia combined 
statistical area, a larger trade area, was 1,951,644.[8] The town of Nashville 
was founded by James Robertson, John Donelson, and a party of Overmountain 
Men in 1779, near the original Cumberland settlement of Fort Nashborough. 
It was named for Francis Nash, the American Revolutionary War hero. Nashville 
quickly grew because of its strategic location, accessibility as a port 
on the Cumberland River, a tributary of the Ohio River; and its later status 
as a major railroad center. By 1800, the city had 345 residents, including 
136 African American slaves and 14 free blacks.[9] In 1806, Nashville was 
incorporated as a city and became the county seat of Davidson County, Tennessee. 
In 1843, the city was named the permanent capital of the state of Tennessee. 
By 1860, when the first rumblings of secession began to be heard across 
the South, antebellum Nashville was a very prosperous city. The city's 
significance as a shipping port made it a desirable prize as a means of 
controlling important river and railroad transportation routes. In February 
1862, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops. 
The state was occupied by Union troops for the duration of the war. The 
Battle of Nashville (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory 
and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in 
the war; it was also the final major military action of the war, which 
afterwards became almost entirely a war of attrition consisting largely 
of guerrilla raids and small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in 
the Deep South almost constantly in retreat. Within a few years after the 
Civil War, the Nashville chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded by Confederate 
veteran John W. Morton.[10] Meanwhile, the city had reclaimed its important 
shipping and trading position and also developed a solid manufacturing 
base. The post–Civil War years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity 
to Nashville and Davidson County. These healthy economic times left the 
city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still 
be seen around the downtown area.[11] Circa 1950 the state legislature 
approved a new city charter that provided for election of city council 
members from single-member districts, rather than at-large voting. This 
change was supported because at-large voting diluted the minority population's 
political power in the city. They could seldom gain a majority of the population 
to support a candidate of their choice. Apportionment under the single-member 
districts meant that some districts had black majorities. In 1952, after 
passage of the new charter, African-American attorneys Z. Alexander Looby 
and Robert E. Lillard were elected to the city council. The first to gain 
office since 1911, after disenfranchisement had been achieved by the state 
government. The years after World War II were a time of rapid suburbanization 
as new housing was built outside the city limits. This resulted in a demand 
for many new schools and other support facilities, which the county found 
difficult to provide. At the same time, suburbanization led to a declining 
tax base in the city, although many suburban residents used unique city 
amenities and services supported only by city taxpayers. After years of 
discussion, a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating 
city and county government. It failed to gain approval although it was 
supported by elected leaders of both jurisdictions: County Judge Beverly 
Briley of Davidson and Mayor Ben West of Nashville.[12] Following the referendum's 
failure, Nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions 
to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and 
created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter 
for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of 
service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the 
Urban Services District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents 
of the Urban Services District had a full range of city services. The areas 
that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate 
until full services were provided.[12] This helped reconcile aspects of 
services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large 
metro region. In 1963, Nashville consolidated its government with Davidson 
County, forming a metropolitan government. The membership on the Metro 
Council, the legislative body, was increased from 21 to 40 seats. Of these, 
five members are elected at-large and 35 are elected from single-member 
districts, each to serve a term of four years.[12] Since the 1970s, the 
city and county have experienced tremendous growth, particularly during 
the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of then-Mayor and later-Tennessee 
Governor, Phil Bredesen. He made urban renewal a priority, and fostered 
the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the 
Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, the downtown Nashville Public Library, 
the Bridgestone Arena, and Nissan Stadium. Nissan Stadium (formerly Adelphia 
Coliseum and LP Field) was built after the National Football League's (NFL) 
Houston Oilers agreed to move to the city in 1995. The NFL team debuted 
in Nashville in 1998 at Vanderbilt Stadium, and Nissan Stadium opened in 
the summer of 1999. The Oilers changed their name to the Tennessee Titans 
and finished the season with the Music City Miracle and a close Super Bowl 
game in which the St. Louis Rams' win was secured in the last play. In 
1997 Nashville was awarded a National Hockey League expansion team; this 
was named the Nashville Predators. Since the 2003-04 season, the Nashville 
Predators have made the playoffs every season except for three. Today, 
the city along the Cumberland River is a crossroads of American culture, 
and one of the fastest-growing areas of the Upland South. Nashville lies 
on the Cumberland River in the northwestern portion of the Nashville Basin. 
Nashville's elevation ranges from 385 feet (117 m) above sea level at the 
Cumberland River to 1,160 feet (350 m) above sea level at its highest point.[13] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area 
of 527.9 square miles (1,367 km2), of which 504.0 square miles (1,305 km2) 
of it is land and 23.9 square miles (62 km2) of it (4.53%) is water. Nashville 
has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa),[14] with moderately cold 
winters, and hot, humid summers. Monthly averages range from 37.7 °F (3.2 °C) 
in January to 79.4 °F (26.3 °C) in July, with a diurnal temperature variation 
of 18.2 to 23.0 °F (10.1 to 12.8 °C). Snowfall occurs during the winter 
months, but it is usually not heavy. Average annual snowfall is about 6.3 
inches (16 cm), falling mostly in January and February and occasionally 
in March and December.[15] The largest snow event since 2000 was on January 
22, 2016, when Nashville received 8 inches (20 cm) of snow in a single 
storm; the largest was 17 inches (43 cm), received on March 17, 1892.[16] 
Rainfall is typically greater in November and December, and spring, while 
August to October are the driest months on average. Spring and fall are 
generally warm but prone to severe thunderstorms, which occasionally bring 
tornadoes—with recent major events on April 16, 1998; April 7, 2006; February 
5, 2008; April 10, 2009; and May 1–2, 2010. Relative humidity in Nashville 
averages 83% in the mornings and 60% in the afternoons,[17] which is considered 
moderate for the Southeastern United States.[18] In recent decades, due 
to urban development, Nashville has developed an urban heat island (UHI); 
especially on cool, clear nights, temperatures are up to 10 °F (5.6 °C) 
warmer in the heart of the city than in rural outlying areas. The Nashville 
region lies within USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a.[19] Nashville's long springs 
and autumns combined with a diverse array of trees and grasses can often 
make it uncomfortable for allergy sufferers.[20] In 2008, Nashville was 
ranked as the 18th-worst spring allergy city in the U.S. by the Asthma 
and Allergy Foundation of America.[21] The coldest temperature ever recorded 
in Nashville was −17 °F (−27 °C) on January 21, 1985, and the highest was 
109 °F (43 °C) on June 29, 2012.[22] Nashville's downtown area features 
a diverse assortment of entertainment, dining, cultural and architectural 
attractions. The Broadway and 2nd Avenue areas feature entertainment venues, 
night clubs and an assortment of restaurants. North of Broadway lie Nashville's 
central business district, Legislative Plaza, Capitol Hill and the Tennessee 
Bicentennial Mall. Cultural and architectural attractions can be found 
throughout the city. Three major interstate highways (I-40, I-65 and I-24) 
converge near the core area of downtown, and many regional cities are within 
a day's driving distance. Nashville's first skyscraper, the Life & Casualty 
Tower, was completed in 1957 and launched the construction of other high 
rises in downtown Nashville. After the construction of the AT&T Building 
(commonly referred to by locals as the "Batman Building") in 1994, the 
downtown area saw little construction until the mid-2000s. Many new residential 
developments have since been constructed or are planned for various neighborhoods. 
The Pinnacle, a high rise office building, opened in 2010.[26] Many civic 
and infrastructure projects are being planned, in progress, or recently 
completed. A new MTA bus hub was recently completed in downtown Nashville, 
as was the Music City Star pilot project. Several public parks have been 
constructed, such as the Public Square. Riverfront Park is scheduled to 
be extensively updated. The Music City Center opened in May 2013. It is 
a 1,200,000 square foot (110,000 m2) convention center with 370,000 square 
feet (34,000 m2) of exhibit space. The data below is for all of Metropolitan 
Nashville-Davidson County, including other incorporated cities within the 
consolidated city-county (such as Belle Meade and Berry Hill). See Nashville-Davidson 
(balance) for demographic data on Nashville-Davidson County excluding separately 
incorporated cities. According to the 2009 American Community Survey, there 
were 628,434 people residing in the city. The population density was 1,204.2 
inhabitants per square mile (464.9/km2). There were 282,452 housing units 
at an average density of 560.4 per square mile (216.4/km2).[31] At the 
2010 census, the racial makeup of the city was 61.4% White (57.4% non-Hispanic 
white), 27.7% African American, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 
3.0% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.5% from 
two or more races. 9.8% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino 
origin (they may be of any race).[32] The non-Hispanic White population 
was 79.5% in 1970.[33] There were 254,651 households and 141,469 families 
(55.6% of households). Of households with families, 37.2% had married couples 
living together, 14.1% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 4.2% had a male householder with no wife present. 27.9% of all households 
had children under the age of 18, and 18.8% had at least one member 65 
years of age or older. Of the 44.4% of households that are non-families, 
36.2% were individuals and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size was 2.38 and the average family 
size was 3.16.[35] The age distribution was 22% under 18, 10% from 18 to 
24, 33% from 25 to 44, 24% from 45 to 64, and 11% who were 65 or older. 
The median age was 34.2 years. For every 100 females there were 94.1 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.7 males.[36] The median 
income for a household in the city was $46,141, and the median income for 
a family was $56,377. Males with a year-round, full-time job had a median 
income of $41,017 versus $36,292 for females. The per capita income for 
the city was $27,372. About 13.9% of families and 18.2% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 29.5% of those under age 18 and 
9.9% of those age 65 or over.[37] Of residents 25 or older, 33.4% have 
a bachelor's degree or higher.[3] Because of its relatively low cost of 
living and large job market, Nashville has become a popular city for immigrants.[38] 
Nashville's foreign-born population more than tripled in size between 1990 
and 2000, increasing from 12,662 to 39,596. The city's largest immigrant 
groups include Mexicans, Kurds,[39] Vietnamese, Laotians, Arabs, and Somalis. 
There are also smaller communities of Pashtuns from Afghanistan and Pakistan 
concentrated primarily in Antioch.[40] Nashville has the largest Kurdish 
community in the United States, numbering approximately 11,000.[41] In 
2009, about 60,000 Bhutanese refugees were being admitted to the U.S., 
and some were expected to resettle in Nashville.[42] During the Iraqi election 
of 2005, Nashville was one of the few international locations where Iraqi 
expatriates could vote.[43] The American Jewish community in Nashville 
dates back over 150 years, and numbered about 8,000 in 2015, plus 2,000 
Jewish college students.[44] As of 2015[update], Nashville has the largest 
metropolitan area in the state of Tennessee, spanning 13 counties and an 
estimated population of 1,830,345.[4] The Nashville metropolitan statistical 
area encompasses 13 of 41 Middle Tennessee counties: Cannon, Cheatham, 
Davidson, Dickson, Hickman, Macon, Robertson, Rutherford, Smith, Sumner, 
Trousdale, Williamson, and Wilson.[45] The 2015 population of the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Columbia 
combined statistical area was estimated at 1,951,644.[8] As the "home of 
country music", Nashville has become a major music recording and production 
center. The Big Four record labels, as well as numerous independent labels, 
have offices in Nashville, mostly in the Music Row area.[46] Nashville 
has been the headquarters of guitar company Gibson since 1984. Since the 
1960s, Nashville has been the second-largest music production center (after 
New York) in the U.S.[47] As of 2006, Nashville's music industry is estimated 
to have a total economic impact of $6.4 billion per year and to contribute 
19,000 jobs to the Nashville area.[48] Although Nashville is renowned as 
a music recording center and tourist destination, its largest industry 
is health care. Nashville is home to more than 300 health care companies, 
including Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), the world's largest private 
operator of hospitals.[49][50] As of 2012[update], it is estimated the 
health care industry contributes US$30 billion per year and 200,000 jobs 
to the Nashville-area economy.[51] The automotive industry is also becoming 
increasingly important for the Middle Tennessee region. Nissan North America 
moved its corporate headquarters in 2006 from Gardena, California (Los 
Angeles County) to Franklin, southwest of Nashville. Nissan also has its 
largest North American manufacturing plant in Smyrna, Tennessee. Largely 
as a result of the increased development of Nissan and other Japanese economic 
interests in the region, Japan moved its former New Orleans consulate-general 
to Nashville's Palmer Plaza. Bridgestone has a strong presence with their 
North American headquarters located in Nashville, with manufacturing plants 
and a distribution center in nearby counties. Other major industries in 
Nashville include insurance, finance, and publishing (especially religious 
publishing). The city hosts headquarters operations for several Protestant 
denominations, including the United Methodist Church, Southern Baptist 
Convention, National Baptist Convention USA, and the National Association 
of Free Will Baptists. Nashville is also known for some of their famously 
popular Southern confections, including Goo Goo Clusters (which have been 
made in Nashville since 1912).[52] Fortune 500 companies with offices within 
Nashville include Dell,[53] HCA, Bridgestone, Community Health Systems, 
Nissan North America, Tractor Supply Company, UBS and Dollar General. In 
2013, the city ranked No. 5 on Forbes' list of the Best Places for Business 
and Careers.[54] In 2015, Forbes put Nashville as the 4th Best City for 
White Collar Jobs.[55] In 2015, Business Facilities' 11th Annual Rankings 
report named Nashville the number one city for Economic Growth Potential.[56] 
Real estate is becoming a major driver for the city's economy. Based on 
a survey of nearly 1,500 real estate industry professionals conducted by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute, Nashville ranked 7th 
nationally in terms of attractiveness to real estate investors for 2016.[57] 
As of October 2015[update], according to city figures, there is more than 
$2 billion in real estate projects underway or projected to start in 2016. 
Due to high yields available to investors, Nashville has been attracting 
a lot of capital from out-of-state. A key factor that has been attributed 
to the increase in investment is the adjustment to the city's zoning code. 
Developers can easily include a combination of residential, office, retail 
and entertainment space into their projects. Additionally, the city has 
invested heavily into public parks. Centennial Park is undergoing extensive 
renovations. The change in the zoning code and the investment in public 
space is consistent with the millennial generation's preference for walkable 
urban neighborhoods.[58] According to the city's 2014 Comprehensive Annual 
Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:[59] Much of the city's 
cultural life has revolved around its large university community. Particularly 
significant in this respect were two groups of critics and writers who 
were associated with Vanderbilt University in the early 20th century: the 
Fugitives and the Agrarians. Popular destinations include Fort Nashborough 
and Fort Negley, the former being a reconstruction of the original settlement, 
the latter being a semi-restored Civil War battle fort; the Tennessee State 
Museum; and The Parthenon, a full-scale replica of the original Parthenon 
in Athens. The Tennessee State Capitol is one of the oldest working state 
capitol buildings in the nation. The Hermitage, the former home of President 
Andrew Jackson, is one of the oldest presidential homes open to the public.[60] 
Some of the more popular types of local cuisine include hot chicken, hot 
fish, barbecue, and meat and three. Thanks in part to Nashville's foodie 
culture, the city was ranked as the 13th "snobbiest" city in America according 
to Travel + Leisure magazine.[61] Nashville has a vibrant music and entertainment 
scene spanning a variety of genres. The Tennessee Performing Arts Center 
is the major performing arts center of the city. It is the home of the 
Tennessee Repertory Theatre, the Nashville Opera, the Music City Drum and 
Bugle Corps, and the Nashville Ballet. In September 2006, the Schermerhorn 
Symphony Center opened as the home of the Nashville Symphony. As the city's 
name itself is a metonym for the country music industry, many popular tourist 
attractions involve country music, including the Country Music Hall of 
Fame and Museum, Belcourt Theatre, and Ryman Auditorium. The Ryman was 
home to the Grand Ole Opry until 1974 when the show moved to the Grand 
Ole Opry House, 9 miles (14 km) east of downtown. The Opry plays there 
several times a week, except for an annual winter run at the Ryman. A multitude 
of music clubs and honky-tonk bars can be found in downtown Nashville, 
particularly the area encompassing Lower Broadway, Second Avenue, and Printer's 
Alley, which is often referred to as "the District".[62][63] Each June, 
the CMA Music Festival (formerly known as Fan Fair) brings thousands of 
country fans to the city. The Tennessee State Fair is also held annually 
in September. Nashville was once home of television shows such as Hee Haw 
and Pop! Goes the Country, as well as The Nashville Network and later, 
RFD-TV. Country Music Television and Great American Country currently operate 
from Nashville. The city was also home to the Opryland USA theme park, 
which operated from 1972 to 1997 before being closed by its owners (Gaylord 
Entertainment Company) and soon after demolished to make room for the Opry 
Mills mega-shopping mall. The Contemporary Christian music industry is 
based along Nashville's Music Row, with a great influence in neighboring 
Williamson County. The Christian record companies include EMI Christian 
Music Group, Provident Label Group and Word Records. Music Row houses many 
gospel music and Contemporary Christian music companies centered around 
16th and 17th Avenues South. Although Nashville was never known as a jazz 
town, it did have many great jazz bands, including The Nashville Jazz Machine 
led by Dave Converse and its current version, the Nashville Jazz Orchestra, 
led by Jim Williamson, as well as The Establishment, led by Billy Adair. 
The Francis Craig Orchestra entertained Nashvillians from 1929 to 1945 
from the Oak Bar and Grille Room in the Hermitage Hotel. Craig's orchestra 
was also the first to broadcast over local radio station WSM-AM and enjoyed 
phenomenal success with a 12-year show on the NBC Radio Network. In the 
late 1930s, he introduced a newcomer, Dinah Shore, a local graduate of 
Hume Fogg High School and Vanderbilt University. Radio station WMOT-FM 
in nearby Murfreesboro, which formerly programmed jazz almost exclusively 
and still does so on the weekends, aided significantly in the recent revival 
of the city's jazz scene, as has the non-profit Nashville Jazz Workshop, 
which holds concerts and classes in a renovated building in the north Nashville 
neighborhood of Germantown. Fisk University also maintains a jazz station, 
WFSK. Nashville has an active theatre scene, and is home to several professional 
and community theatre companies. Nashville Children's Theatre, Tennessee 
Repertory Theatre, the Nashville Shakespeare Festival, the Dance Theatre 
of Tennessee and the Tennessee Women's Theater Project are among the most 
prominent professional companies. One community theatre, Circle Players, 
has been in operation for over 60 years. Perhaps the biggest factor in 
drawing visitors to Nashville is its association with country music. Many 
visitors to Nashville attend live performances of the Grand Ole Opry, the 
world's longest running live radio show. The Country Music Hall of Fame 
and Museum is another major attraction relating to the popularity of country 
music. The Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, the Opry Mills 
regional shopping mall and the General Jackson showboat, are all located 
in what is known as Music Valley. Civil War history is important to the 
city's tourism industry. Sites pertaining to the Battle of Nashville and 
the nearby Battle of Franklin and Battle of Stones River can be seen, along 
with several well-preserved antebellum plantation houses such as Belle 
Meade Plantation, Carnton plantation in Franklin, and Belmont Mansion.[64] 
Nashville has several arts centers and museums, including the Frist Center 
for the Visual Arts, Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art, the 
Tennessee State Museum, the Johnny Cash Museum, Fisk University's Van Vechten 
and Aaron Douglas Galleries, Vanderbilt University's Fine Art Gallery and 
Sarratt Gallery, and the full-scale replica of the Parthenon. Nashville 
is a colorful, well-known city in several different arenas. As such, it 
has earned various sobriquets, including: Nashville has additionally earned 
the moniker "The Hot Chicken Capital",[83] becoming known for the local 
specialty cuisine hot chicken.[84][85] The Music City Hot Chicken Festival 
is hosted annually in Nashville and several restaurants make this spicy 
version of southern fried chicken.[86] Nashville has several professional 
sports teams, of which two, the Nashville Predators of the NHL and the 
Tennessee Titans of the NFL, play at the highest professional level of 
their respective sports. Nashville hosts the second longest continually 
operating race track in the United States, the Fairgrounds Speedway, a 
NASCAR Whelen All-American Series racetrack. Nashville hosted a team called 
the Nashville Rebels which participated in the 1938 American Football League, 
and two Arena Football League teams named the Nashville Kats: one that 
ran from 1997 to 2001 until they were sold to Atlanta and renamed as the 
Georgia Force; and another expansion franchise that competed from 2005 
to 2007. Nashville is also home to four Division I athletic programs. Nashville 
is also home to the NCAA college football Music City Bowl. Three Little 
League Baseball teams from Nashville (one in 1970; one in 2013; and, one 
in 2014) have qualified for the Little League World Series. A team from 
neighboring Goodlettsville qualifed for the 2012 series, giving the metropolitan 
area teams in three consecutive years to so qualify. Metro Board of Parks 
and Recreation owns and manages 10,200 acres (4,100 ha) of land and 99 
parks and greenways (comprising more than 3% of the total area of the county). 
Warner Parks, situated on 2,684 acres (1,086 ha) of land, consists of a 
5,000-square-foot (460 m2) learning center, 20 miles (32 km) of scenic 
roads, 12 miles (19 km) of hiking trails, and 10 miles (16 km) of horse 
trails. It is also the home of the annual Iroquois Steeplechase. The United 
States Army Corps of Engineers maintains parks on Old Hickory Lake and 
Percy Priest Lake. These parks are used for activities such as fishing, 
water skiing, sailing and boating. The Harbor Island Yacht Club makes its 
headquarters on Old Hickory Lake, and Percy Priest Lake is home to the 
Vanderbilt Sailing Club and Nashville Shores. Other parks in Nashville 
include Centennial Park, Shelby Park, Cumberland Park, and Radnor Lake 
State Natural Area. On August 27, 2013, Nashville mayor Karl Dean revealed 
plans for two new riverfront parks on the east and west banks of the Cumberland 
River downtown. Construction on the east bank park began in the fall of 
2013, and the projected completion date for the west bank park is 2015. 
Among many exciting benefits of this Cumberland River re-development project 
is the construction of a highly anticipated outdoor amphitheater. Located 
on the west bank, this music venue will be surrounded by a new 12-acre 
(4.9 ha) park and will replace the previous thermal plant site. It will 
include room for 6,500 spectators with 2,500 removable seats and additional 
seating on an overlooking grassy knoll. In addition, the 4.5-acre (1.8 ha) 
east bank park will include a river landing, providing people access to 
the river. In regard to the parks' benefits for Nashvillian civilians, 
Mayor Dean remarked that "if done right, the thermal site can be an iconic 
park that generations of Nashvillians will be proud of and which they can 
enjoy" (WKRN-TV Nashville). The city of Nashville and Davidson County merged 
in 1963 as a way for Nashville to combat the problems of urban sprawl. 
The combined entity is officially known as "the Metropolitan Government 
of Nashville and Davidson County", and is popularly known as "Metro Nashville" 
or simply "Metro". It offers services such as police, fire, electricity, 
water and sewage treatment. When the Metro government was formed in 1963, 
the government was split into two service districts—the "urban services 
district" and the "general services district." The urban services district 
encompasses the 1963 boundaries of the former City of Nashville, approximately 
72 square miles (190 km2),[87] and the general services district includes 
the remainder of Davidson County. There are six smaller municipalities 
within the consolidated city-county: Belle Meade, Berry Hill, Forest Hills, 
Oak Hill, Goodlettsville (partially), and Ridgetop (partially). These municipalities 
use a two-tier system of government, with the smaller municipality typically 
providing police services and the Metro Nashville government providing 
most other services. Previously, the city of Lakewood also had a separate 
charter. However, Lakewood residents voted in 2010 and 2011 to dissolve 
its city charter and join the metropolitan government, with both votes 
passing.[88] Nashville is governed by a mayor, vice-mayor, and 40-member 
Metropolitan Council. It uses the strong-mayor form of the mayor–council 
system.[89] The current mayor of Nashville is Megan Barry. The Metropolitan 
Council is the legislative body of government for Nashville and Davidson 
County. There are five council members who are elected at large and 35 
council members that represent individual districts. The Metro Council 
has regular meetings that are presided over by the vice-mayor, who is currently 
David Briley. The Metro Council meets on the first and third Tuesday of 
each month at 6:00 pm, according to the Metropolitan Charter. Nashville 
is home to the Tennessee Supreme Court's courthouse for Middle Tennessee 
and the courthouse for the United States District Court for the Middle 
District of Tennessee. Nashville has been a Democratic stronghold since 
at least the end of Reconstruction, and has remained staunchly Democratic 
even as the state as a whole has trended strongly Republican. Pockets of 
Republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city, but they 
are usually no match for the overwhelming Democratic trend in the rest 
of the city. The issue of school busing roiled politics for years but subsided 
after the 1990s.[90] While local elections are officially nonpartisan, 
nearly all of the city's elected officials are publicly known as Democrats. 
The city is split between 10 state house districts, all but one of which 
are held by Democrats (Republican Speaker of the House Beth Harwell holds 
the only Republican house seat). Three state senate districts and part 
of a fourth are within the county; two are held by Democrats and two by 
Republicans.[91] In the state legislature, Nashville politicians serve 
as leaders of both the Senate and House Democratic Caucuses. Representative 
Mike Stewart serves as Chairman of the House Caucus. Senator Jeff Yarbro 
serves as Chairman of the Senate Caucus. Democrats are no less dominant 
at the federal level. Democratic presidential candidates have only failed 
to carry Davidson County five times since reconstruction; in 1928, 1968, 
1972, 1984 and 1988.[92] In most years, Democrats have carried Nashville 
at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty, even in years 
when they lose Tennessee as a whole. This has been especially true in recent 
elections. In the 2000 presidential election, Tennessean Democrat Al Gore 
carried Nashville with over 59% of the vote even as he narrowly lost his 
home state. In the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry carried Nashville 
with 55% of the vote even as George W. Bush won the state by 14 points. 
In 2008, Barack Obama carried Nashville with 60% of the vote even as Republican 
John McCain won Tennessee by 15 points. Despite its large size, Nashville 
has been in a single congressional district for most of the time since 
Reconstruction; it is currently the 5th District, represented by Democrat 
Jim Cooper. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Nashville 
since 1874. Republicans made a few spirited challenges in the mid-1960s 
and early 1970s. The Republicans almost won it in 1968; only a strong showing 
by a candidate from Wallace's American Independent Party kept the seat 
in Democratic hands. However, they have not made a serious bid for the 
district since 1972, when the Republican candidate gained only 38% of the 
vote even as Nixon carried the district in the presidential election by 
a large margin. The district's best-known congressman was probably Jo Byrns, 
who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and was Speaker of the House 
for much of Franklin Roosevelt's first term as President. Another nationally 
prominent congressman from Nashville was Percy Priest, who represented 
the district from 1941 to 1956 and was House Majority Whip from 1949 to 
1953. Former mayors Richard Fulton and Bill Boner also sat in the U.S. 
House before assuming the Metro mayoral office. From 2003 to 2013, a sliver 
of southwestern Nashville was located in the 7th District, represented 
by Republican Marsha Blackburn. This area was roughly coextensive with 
the portion of Nashville she'd represented in the state senate from 1998 
to 2002. However, the 5th regained all of Nashville after the 2010 census. 
The city is served by Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools. Nashville 
is often labeled the "Athens of the South" due to the many colleges and 
universities in the city and the metropolitan area.[75] The colleges and 
universities in Nashville include: Within 30 miles (48 km) of Nashville 
in Murfreesboro is Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), a full-sized 
public university with Tennessee's largest undergraduate population. Enrollment 
in post-secondary education in Nashville is around 43,000. Within the Nashville 
Metropolitan Statistical Area—which includes MTSU, Cumberland University 
(Lebanon), Volunteer State Community College (Gallatin), Daymar College, 
and O'More College of Design (Franklin)—total enrollment exceeds 74,000. 
Within a 40 miles (64 km) radius are Austin Peay State University (Clarksville) 
and Columbia State Community College (Columbia), enrolling an additional 
13,600. Nashville is home to four historically black institutions of higher 
education: Fisk University, Tennessee State University, Meharry Medical 
College, and American Baptist College.[93] The daily newspaper in Nashville 
is The Tennessean, which until 1998 competed with the Nashville Banner, 
another daily paper that was housed in the same building under a joint-operating 
agreement. The Tennessean is the city's most widely circulated newspaper, 
while a smaller free daily called The City Paper shares the Nashville market. 
Online news service NashvillePost.com competes with the printed dailies 
to break local and state news. Several weekly papers are also published 
in Nashville, including The Nashville Pride, Nashville Business Journal, 
Nashville Scene and The Tennessee Tribune. Historically, The Tennessean 
was associated with a broadly liberal editorial policy, while The Banner 
carried staunchly conservative views in its editorial pages; The Banner's 
heritage had been carried on, to an extent, by The City Paper which folded 
in August 2013 after having been founded in October 2000. The Nashville 
Scene is the area's alternative weekly broadsheet. The Nashville Pride 
is aimed towards community development and serves Nashville's entrepreneurial 
population. Nashville Post is an online news source covering business, 
politics and sports. Nashville is home to eleven broadcast television stations, 
although most households are served by direct cable network connections. 
Comcast Cable has a monopoly on terrestrial cable service in Davidson County 
(but not throughout the entire media market). Nashville is ranked as the 
29th largest television market in the United States.[94] Major stations 
include WKRN-TV (ABC), WSMV-TV (NBC), WTVF (CBS), WNPT (PBS), WZTV (Fox), 
WNPX-TV (ion), WPGD-TV (TBN), WLLC-LP (Univision), WUXP-TV (MyNetworkTV), 
and WNAB (CW).[95] Nashville is also home to cable networks Country Music 
Television (CMT), among others. CMT's master control facilities are located 
in New York City with the other Viacom properties. The Top 20 Countdown 
and CMT Insider are taped in their Nashville studios. Shop at Home Network 
was once based in Nashville, but the channel signed off in 2008. Several 
dozen FM and AM radio stations broadcast in the Nashville area, including 
five college stations and one LPFM community radio station. Nashville is 
ranked as the 44th largest radio market in the United States. WSM-FM is 
owned by Cumulus Media and is 95.5 FM. WSM-AM, owned by Gaylord Entertainment 
Company, can be heard nationally on 650 AM or online at WSM Online from 
its studios located inside the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center. 
WSM is famous for carrying live broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry, through 
which it helped spread the popularity of country music in America, and 
continues to broadcast country music throughout its broadcast day. WLAC, 
whose over-the-air signal is heard at 1510 AM, is a Clear Channel-owned 
talk station which was originally sponsored by the Life and Casualty Insurance 
Company of Tennessee, and its competitor WWTN is owned by Cumulus. Several 
major motion pictures have been filmed in Nashville, including The Green 
Mile, The Last Castle, Gummo, The Thing Called Love, Two Weeks, Coal Miner's 
Daughter, Nashville,[96] and Country Strong, as well as the ABC television 
series Nashville. Nashville is centrally located at the crossroads of three 
Interstate Highways: I-40, I-24, and I-65. Interstate 440 is a bypass route 
connecting I-40, I-65, and I-24 south of downtown Nashville. Briley Parkway 
connects the north side of the city and its interstates. A number of arterial 
surface roads called "pikes" radiate from the city center; many carry the 
names of nearby towns to which they lead. Among these are Clarksville Pike, 
Gallatin Pike, Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro Pike, Nolensville Pike, and Franklin 
Pike. The Metropolitan Transit Authority provides bus transit within the 
city, out of a newly built hub station downtown. Routes utilize a hub and 
spoke method. Expansion plans include use of Bus rapid transit for new 
routes, with the possibility for local rail service at some point in the 
future. Nashville is considered a gateway city for rail and air traffic 
for the Piedmont Atlantic Megaregion.[97] The city is served by Nashville 
International Airport (BNA), which was a hub for American Airlines between 
1986 and 1995 and is now a focus city for Southwest Airlines. During 2011, 
Nashville International was the 34th busiest passenger airport in the U.S. 
with a total of 4,673,047 passenger boardings.[98] Major airlines serving 
Nashville include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, 
Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, WestJet, Alaska Airlines,[99] JetBlue 
Airways,[100] and AirCanada.[101] AirTran Airways offered limited routing 
to the airport until it was deemed unprofitable.[citation needed] Although 
a major freight hub for CSX Transportation, Nashville is not currently 
served by Amtrak, the second-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. to have 
this distinction.[102] Amtrak's Floridian (Chicago to Miami and St. Petersburg, 
Florida via Louisville and Nashville) served Nashville until its cancellation 
on October 9, 1979 due to poor track conditions resulting in late trains 
and low ridership. While there have been no proposals to restore Amtrak 
service to Nashville, there have been repeated calls from residents.[103] 
However, Tennessee state officials have advised it will not be happening 
anytime soon due to scarce federal funding. "It would be wonderful to say 
I can be in Memphis and jump on a train to Nashville, but the volume of 
people who would do that isn't anywhere close to what the cost would be 
to provide the service," said Ed Cole, chief of environment and planning 
with the Tennessee Department of Transportation.[103] Ross Capon, executive 
director of the National Association of Railroad Passengers, said rail 
trips would catch on if routes were expanded, but conceded that it would 
be nearly impossible to resume Amtrak service to Nashville without a substantial 
investment from the state because federal money has dried up.[103] Nashville 
launched a passenger commuter rail system called the Music City Star on 
September 18, 2006. The only currently operational leg of the system connects 
the city of Lebanon to downtown Nashville at the Nashville Riverfront station. 
Legs to Clarksville, Murfreesboro and Gallatin are currently in the feasibility 
study stage. The system plan includes seven legs connecting Nashville to 
surrounding suburbs. Bridges within the city include: Nashville is an active 
participant in the sister cities program and has relationships with the
