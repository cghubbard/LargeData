William Jones "Boileryard" Clarke (October 18, 1868 – July 29, 1959), was 
an American Major League Baseball player from New York City who played 
catcher from 1893 to 1905. He played for the Baltimore Orioles (1893–1898), 
Boston Beaneaters (1899–1900), Washington Senators (1901–1904), and New 
York Giants (1905).[1] Clarke was born on October 18, 1868 in New York 
City. He moved to New Mexico in his early childhood, was raised in Indian 
territory, and studied civil engineering in Santa Fe at Brothers College.[2] 
He began his professional career in the Three-I League in 1889, and made 
his debut for the Orioles on May 1, 1893.[2] He said that his nickname, 
"Boileryard", was given to him because of his voice, explaining, "I had 
a terrible voice which you could hear all over the diamond."[2] During 
his major league career, he also assisted the Princeton University baseball 
team as a coach from 1897 to 1901.[2] He returned to Princeton in 1909, 
approximately four years after his retirement from baseball, and stayed 
until 1927. He came out of retirement again to be an assistant coach for 
Princeton in 1934, and in 1936 was named manager of the team, and stayed 
in the position until 1944, when retired again, this time at the age of 
75. His managerial record at Princeton was 499-309, and his tenure in athletics 
there was longer than anybody else's. He also managed minor league teams 
in Allentown, Pa., Toledo, Ohio, and Albany, N.Y.[2] Bill Clarke Field, 
the home of Princeton baseball since 1961, is named for Clarke.[3] Clarke 
died in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 90, of complications suffered 
from a broken hip resulting from a fall.[1][2] He was survived by his wife 
of 64 years and a granddaughter.[2] He is interred at Druid Ridge Cemetery
