The 1974 Minnesota Twins finished 82-80, third in the American League West. 
Only one Twins player made the All-Star Game, second baseman Rod Carew. 
Carew won his fourth AL batting title with a .364 average, and set a Minnesota 
record with 180 singles. Outfielder Bobby Darwin hit 25 HR and drove in 
95 runs. Three pitchers had double digit wins: Bert Blyleven (17-17), Joe 
Decker (16-14), and Dave Goltz (10-10). Bill Campbell showed potential 
as a reliever, registering 19 saves and 8 relief wins. Only 662,401 fans 
attended Twins games, the lowest total in the American League. It was half 
the number of fans that attended in the 1960s. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
