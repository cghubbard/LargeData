Indianapolis (pronounced /ˌɪndiəˈnæpəlɪs/[7][8][9]), is the capital and 
largest city of the U.S. state of Indiana and the seat of Marion County. 
It is in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States. 
With an estimated population of 853,173 in 2015, Indianapolis is the second 
most populous city in the Midwest, after Chicago, and 14th largest in the 
U.S.[10] The city is the economic and cultural center of the Indianapolis 
metropolitan area, home to 2 million people, the 34th most populous metropolitan 
statistical area in the U.S. Its combined statistical area ranks 26th, 
with 2.4 million inhabitants. Indianapolis covers 372 square miles (963.5 km²), 
making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S. Founded in 1821 
as a planned city for the new seat of the government of Indiana, Indianapolis 
was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a 1-square-mile 
(2.6 km2) grid adjacent to the White River. The city grew beyond the Mile 
Square, as completion of the National Road and advent of the railroad solidified 
the city's position as a manufacturing and transportation hub. Indianapolis 
is within a single-day drive of 70 percent of the nation's population, 
lending to its nickname as the "Crossroads of America."[11][12] Anchoring 
the 26th largest economic region in the U.S., the city's economy is based 
primarily on business services, transportation and logistics, education, 
financial services, hospitality and tourism, and distribution services.[13][14] 
Indianapolis has developed niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing.[14][15] 
The city is perhaps best known for annually hosting the world's largest 
single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500.[16] The city's philanthropic 
community, led by the Lilly Endowment, has been instrumental in the development 
of its cultural institutions, including The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, 
Indianapolis Zoo, and Indiana Landmarks.[17][18][19][20] The city is notable 
as headquarters for the American Legion and home to a significant collection 
of monuments dedicated to veterans and war dead, the most in the U.S. outside 
of Washington, D.C.[21][22] Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known 
as Unigov, local government administration has operated under the direction 
of an elected 25-member city-county council, headed by the mayor. Indianapolis 
is considered a "high sufficiency" global city.[23] In 1816, the year Indiana 
gained statehood, the U.S. Congress donated four sections of federal land 
to establish a permanent seat of state government.[24] Two years later, 
under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), the Delaware relinquished title 
to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 
1821.[25] This tract of land, which was called the New Purchase, included 
the site selected for the new state capital in 1820.[26] The availability 
of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, 
many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although 
many of these first European and American setters were Protestants, a large 
proportion of the early Irish and German immigrants were Catholics. Few 
African Americans lived in central Indiana before 1840.[27] The first European 
Americans to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were 
either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered 
to be the town's first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe 
George Pogue and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled 
in a log cabin along the creek that was later called Pogue's Run. Other 
historians have argued as early as 1822 that John Wesley McCormick, his 
family, and employees became the first European American settlers in the 
area, settling near the White River in February 1820.[28] On January 11, 
1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site 
in central Indiana for the new state capital.[29] The state legislature 
approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821.[1] 
In April, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey 
and design a town plan for the new settlement.[30] Indianapolis became 
a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when Marion County, was 
established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832, 
when Indianapolis incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated 
city effective March 30, 1847. Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, 
led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. 
In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected 
mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to 
be revised as Indianapolis expanded.[31] Effective January 1, 1825, the 
seat of state government relocated to Indianapolis from Corydon, Indiana. 
In addition to state government offices, a U.S. district court was established 
at Indianapolis in 1825.[32] Growth occurred with the opening of the National 
Road through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway 
in the United States.[33] A small segment of the ultimately failed Indiana 
Central Canal was opened in 1839.[34] The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, 
the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation 
in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth.[35] Indianapolis 
Union Station was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 
1853.[36] During the American Civil War, Indianapolis was loyal to the 
Union cause. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President 
Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for Union army 
troops. On February 11, 1861, president-elect Lincoln arrived in the city, 
en route to Washington, D.C. for his presidential inauguration, marking 
the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history.[37] On April 
16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments 
and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters the state's volunteer soldiers.[38][39] 
Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.[40] 
Indianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing 
the city as a crucial military base.[41][42] Between 1860 and 1870, the 
city's population more than doubled.[35] An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis 
served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war.[43] On 
May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic 
convention at Indianapolis, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned, sarcastically 
referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run.[44] Fear turned to panic in July 
1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces 
turned east toward Ohio, never reaching Indianapolis.[45] On April 30, 
1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated 
crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's bier 
at the Indiana Statehouse.[42][46] Following the Civil War, Indianapolis 
experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was 
the world's third largest pork packing city, after Chicago and Cincinnati, 
and the second largest railroad center in the United States by 1888.[47][48] 
By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000.[35] Some of the city's 
most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, 
including L. S. Ayres (1872), Eli Lilly and Company (1876), Madame C.J. 
Walker Manufacturing Company (1910), and Allison Transmission (1915). Once 
home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile 
manufacturing.[49] The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 
15, 1902, would later become an iconic symbol of the city.[50] Ray Harroun 
won the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, held May 30, 1911 at 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities 
in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths[51][52][53] 
and the displacement of 7,000 families.[54] The city was an early focus 
of labor organization.[35] The Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913 and 
subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest 
labor-protection laws, including a minimum wage, regular work weeks, and 
improved working conditions.[55] The International Typographical Union 
and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor 
unions to be based in the city.[35] Indianapolis served as a stop on the 
Underground Railroad, and up to the time of the Great Migration in the 
early 20th century, the city had a higher black population (nearly 10%) 
than any other city in the Northern States.[56] Led by D. C. Stephenson, 
the Indiana Klan became the most powerful political and social organization 
in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling City Council, the Board 
of School Commissioners, and the Board of County Commissioners. More than 
40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the 
Klan. Race relations would continue to be problematic throughout the 20th 
century. Though Indianapolis abolished segregated schools before Brown 
v. Board of Education, the later action of court-ordered desegregation 
busing by Judge Samuel Hugh Dillin proved controversial.[57] On April 4, 
1968, Robert F. Kennedy delivered one of the most highly regarded speeches 
in 20th century American history from the city, urging calm after the assassination 
of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[58][59][60] Under the mayoral 
administration of Richard Lugar, the city and county governments restructured, 
consolidating most public services into a new entity called Unigov. The 
plan removed redundancies, captured increasingly suburbanizing tax revenue, 
and created a Republican political machine that dominated Indianapolis 
politics until the 2000s.[61][62] Unigov went into effect on January 1, 
1970, increasing the city's land area by 308.2 square miles (798 km2) and 
population by 268,366 people.[63][64] It was the first major city-county 
consolidation to occur in the United States without a referendum since 
the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.[65] Amid the changes 
in government and growth, the city invested in an aggressive strategy to 
brand Indianapolis as a sport tourism destination. Under the administration 
of the city's longest-serving mayor, William Hudnut (1976–1992), millions 
of dollars were poured into sport facilities.[15] Throughout the 1980s, 
$122 million in public and private funding built the Indianapolis Tennis 
Center, Major Taylor Velodrome, Indiana University Natatorium, Carroll 
Track and Soccer Stadium, and RCA Dome.[15] The latter project secured 
the 1984 relocation of the NFL Baltimore Colts and the 1987 Pan American 
Games.[15] The economic development strategy succeeded in revitalizing 
the central business district through the 1990s, with the openings of the 
Indianapolis Zoo (1988), Canal Walk (1989–2001),[34] Circle Centre Mall 
(1995), Victory Field (1996), and Bankers Life Fieldhouse (1999). During 
the 2000s, the city and state continued investing heavily in infrastructure 
projects, including two of the largest building projects in the city's 
history: the $1.1 billion Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal and $720 million Lucas 
Oil Stadium.[66][67] Construction began in 2011 on DigIndy, a $1.9 billion 
project to correct the city's combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2025.[68] 
Indianapolis is located in the East North Central region of the Midwestern 
United States, in central Indiana. According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the Indianapolis (balance) encompasses a total area of 368.2 square 
miles (954 km2), of which 361.5 square miles (936 km2) is land and 6.7 
square miles (17 km2) is water. The consolidated city boundaries are coterminous 
with Marion County, with the exception of the autonomous municipalities 
of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway.[35][69] Indianapolis 
is the 16th largest city by land area in the United States. Indianapolis 
is situated within the Tipton Till Plain, a flat to gently sloping terrain 
underlain by glacial deposits known as till.[71] The lowest point in the 
city is about 650 feet (198 m) above mean sea level, with the highest natural 
elevation at about 900 feet (274 m) above sea level.[71] Few hills or short 
ridges, known as kames, rise about 100 feet (30 m) to 130 feet (40 m) above 
the surrounding terrain.[71] The city lies just north of the Indiana Uplands, 
a region characterized by rolling hills and high limestone content. The 
city is also situated within the EPA's Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion, 
an area of the United States known for its fertile agricultural land.[72] 
Topographic relief slopes gently toward the White River and its two primary 
tributaries, Fall and Eagle creeks. In total, there are about 35 streams 
in the city, including Indian Creek and Pogue's Run.[73] Major bodies of 
water include Indian Lake, Geist Reservoir, and Eagle Creek Reservoir. 
Indianapolis is a planned city. On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General 
Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for 
the new state capital, appointing Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham 
to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis. Ralston had been a surveyor 
for the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, assisting him with the plan for 
Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a 
town of 1 square mile (2.6 km2), near the confluence of the White River 
and Fall Creek.[74] The plan, known as the Mile Square, is bounded by East, 
West, North, and South streets, centered on a traffic circle, called Monument 
Circle (originally Governor's Circle).[75] Four diagonal streets radiated 
a block from Monument Circle: Massachusetts, Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana 
avenues.[76] The city's address numbering system begins at the intersection 
of Washington and Meridian streets.[77] Before its submersion into a sanitary 
tunnel, Pogue's Run was included into the plan, disrupting the rectilinear 
street grid to the southeast. Noted as one of the finest examples of City 
Beautiful movement design in the United States, the seven-block Indiana 
World War Memorial Plaza Historic District began construction in 1921 in 
downtown Indianapolis.[78][79] The National Historic Landmark includes 
the Neoclassical American Legion and Central Library buildings, Depew Memorial 
Fountain, several sculptures and memorials, and open space, hosting many 
annual civic events.[79] After completion of the Soldiers' and Sailors' 
Monument, an ordinance was passed in 1905 restricting building heights 
on the traffic circle to 86 ft (26 m) to protect views of the 284 ft (87 m) 
monument.[80] The ordinance was revised in 1922, permitting buildings to 
rise to 108 ft (33 m), with an additional 42 ft (13 m) allowable with a 
series of setbacks.[80] A citywide height restriction ordinance was instituted 
in 1912, barring structures over 200 ft (61 m).[81] Completed in 1962, 
the Indianapolis City-County Building was the first skyscraper in the city, 
surpassing the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in height by nearly 100 ft 
(30 m).[82] A building boom, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction 
of six of the city's ten tallest buildings.[83] The tallest is Chase Tower, 
completed in 1990 at 811 ft (247 m).[84] Indiana limestone is the signature 
building material in Indianapolis, widely included in the city's many monuments, 
churches, academic, government, and civic buildings.[85] The city is divided 
into 99 community areas for statistical purposes, though many smaller neighborhoods 
exist within these areas.[87] Indianapolis' neighborhoods are difficult 
to delineate because the city lacks historical ethnic divisions, like in 
Chicago, or physical boundaries, seen in Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.[88] 
Instead, most neighborhoods are subtle in their distinctions.[88] The Indianapolis 
Historic Preservation Commission recognizes several neighborhoods as historic 
districts, including: Central Court, Chatham Arch, Cottage Home, Golden 
Hill, Herron-Morton Place, Lockerbie Square, Old Northside, and Oliver 
Johnson's Woods. Expansion of the interurban system at the turn of the 
20th century facilitated growth of several streetcar suburbs, including 
Broad Ripple, Irvington, University Heights, and Woodruff Place.[88] The 
post–World War II economic expansion and subsequent suburbanization had 
a profound impact on the physical development of the city's neighborhoods. 
From 1950 to 1970, 97,000 housing units were built in Marion County.[88] 
Most of this new construction occurred outside Center Township, expediting 
out-migration from the city's urban neighborhoods to suburban areas, such 
as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora. Between 1950 and 1990, over 155,000 
residents left Center Township, resulting in urban blight and disinvestment.[88] 
Since the 2000s, downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods, like 
Fountain Square, have seen increased reinvestment attributed to nationwide 
demographic trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials.[89] By 2020, 
downtown is projected to have 30,000 residential units, compared to 18,300 
in 2010.[90] Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute 
regarding gentrification and affordable housing.[91][92][93] Indianapolis 
is in the humid continental climate zone (Köppen: Dfa) using the 0 °C (32 °F) 
isotherm, experiencing four distinct seasons.[94] The city is in USDA hardiness 
zone 6a.[95] Using Köppen's original −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm the city is 
in the far northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) instead.[96] 
Typically, summers are hot, humid, and wet. Winters are generally cold 
with moderate snowfall. The July daily average temperature is 75.4 °F (24.1 °C). 
High temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 18 days each 
year,[97] and occasionally exceed 95 °F (35 °C). Spring and autumn are 
usually pleasant, if at times unpredictable; midday temperature drops exceeding 
30 °F or 17 °C are common during March and April, and instances of very 
warm days (80 °F or 27 °C) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not 
unusual during these months. Winters are cold, with an average January 
temperature of 28.1 °F (−2.2 °C). Temperatures dip to 0 °F (−18 °C) or 
below an average of 4.7 nights per year.[97] The rainiest months occur 
in the spring and summer, with slightly higher averages during May, June, 
and July. May is typically the wettest, with an average of 5.05 inches 
(12.8 cm) of precipitation.[97] Most rain is derived from thunderstorm 
activity; there is no distinct dry season, although occasional droughts 
occur. Severe weather is not uncommon, particularly in the spring and summer 
months; the city experiences an average of 20 thunderstorm days annually.[98] 
The city's average annual precipitation is 42.4 inches (108 cm), with snowfall 
averaging 25.9 inches (66 cm) per season. Official temperature extremes 
range from 106 °F (41 °C), set on July 14, 1936,[99] to −27 °F (−33 °C), 
set on January 19, 1994.[99][100] The U.S. Census Bureau considers Indianapolis 
as two entities: the consolidated city and the city's remainder, or balance. 
The consolidated city covers an area known as Unigov, coterminous with 
Marion County, except the independent municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, 
Speedway, and Southport. The city's balance excludes the populations of 
11 semi-autonomous municipalities that are included in totals for the consolidated 
city.[69] These are Clermont, Crows Nest, Cumberland, Homecroft, Meridian 
Hills, North Crows Nest, Rocky Ripple, Spring Hill, Warren Park, Williams 
Creek, and Wynnedale. The city's consolidated population for the year 2012 
was 844,220.[69] The city's remainder, or balance, population was estimated 
at 834,852 for 2012,[2] a 2% increase over the total population of 820,445 
reported in the 2010 U.S. Census.[3][106] As of 2010[update], the city's 
population density was 2,270 persons per square mile.[2] Indianapolis is 
the most populous city in Indiana, containing 12.8% of the state's total 
population.[69] The Indianapolis metropolitan area (MSA) (officially known 
as the Indianapolis–Carmel–Anderson MSA) consists of Marion County and 
the surrounding counties of Boone, Brown, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, 
Johnson, Morgan, Putnam, and Shelby. As of 2012[update], the metropolitan 
area's population was 1,798,634, the most populous in Indiana.[107] Indianapolis 
anchors the larger Indianapolis–Carmel–Muncie combined statistical area 
(CSA), with a population of 2,336,237. Indianapolis is also situated within 
the Great Lakes Megalopolis, one of 11 megaregions in the U.S. According 
to the U.S. Census of 2010, 97.2% of the Indianapolis population was reported 
as one race: 61.8% White, 27.5% Black or African American, 2.1% Asian (0.4% 
Burmese, 0.4% Indian, 0.3% Chinese, 0.3% Filipino, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Vietnamese, 
0.1% Japanese, 0.1% Thai, 0.1% other Asian); 0.3% American Indian, and 
5.5% as other. The remaining 2.8% of the population was reported as multiracial 
(two or more races).[106] The city's Hispanic or Latino community comprised 
9.4% of the city's population in the 2010 U.S. Census: 6.9% Mexican, .4% 
Puerto Rican, .1% Cuban, and 2% as other.[106] As of 2010[update], the 
median age for Indianapolis was 33.7 years. Age distribution for the city's 
inhabitants was 25% under the age of 18; 4.4% were between 18 and 21; 16.3% 
were age 21 to 65; and 13.1% were age 65 or older.[106] For every 100 females 
there were 93 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
90 males.[112] The U.S. Census for 2010 reported 332,199 households in 
Indianapolis, with an average household size of 2.42 and an average family 
size of 3.08.[106] Of the total households, 59.3% were family households, 
with 28.2% of these including the family's own children under the age of 
18; 36.5% were husband-wife families; 17.2% had a female householder (with 
no husband present) and 5.6% had a male householder (with no wife present). 
The remaining 40.7% were non-family households.[106] As of 2010[update], 
32% of the non-family households included individuals living alone, 8.3% 
of these households included individuals age 65 years of age or older.[106] 
The U.S. Census Bureau's 2007–2011 American Community Survey indicated 
the median household income for Indianapolis city was $42,704, and the 
median family income was $53,161.[113] Median income for males working 
full-time, year-round, was $42,101, compared to $34,788 for females. Per 
capita income for the city was $24,430, 14.7% of families and 18.9% of 
the city's total population living below the poverty line (28.3% were under 
the age of 18 and 9.2% were age 65 or older).[113] As of 2015[update], 
the Indianapolis metropolitan area had the 18th highest percentage of LGBT 
residents in the U.S., with 4.2% of residents identifying as gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, or transgender.[114] Of the 42.42% of the city's residents who 
identify as religious, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, at 11.31%.[115] 
The second highest religious group in the city are Baptists at 10.31%, 
with Methodists following behind at 4.97%. Presbyterians make up 2.13% 
of the city's religiously affiliated population, followed by Pentecostals 
and Lutherans. Another 8.57% are affiliated with other Christian faiths.[115] 
0.32% of religiously affiliated persons identified themselves as following 
Eastern religions, while 0.68% of the religiously affiliated population 
identified as Jewish, and 0.29% as Muslim.[115] According to the nonpartisan 
and nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute's American Values Atlas, 
22% of residents identify as religiously "unaffiliated," consistent with 
the national average of 22.7%.[116] Indianapolis is the seat of the Roman 
Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, based from Saints Peter and Paul 
Cathedral. In October 2016, Pope Francis announced that current archbishop 
Joseph William Tobin, C.Ss.R., would be created cardinal in November 2016, 
making him the first sitting archbishop of Indianapolis to serve in this 
role. The Archdiocese of Indianapolis also operates Bishop Simon Bruté 
College Seminary, affiliated with Marian University, while the Christian 
Theological Seminary is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples 
of Christ). Indianapolis is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, 
based from Christ Church Cathedral. The Indiana-Kentucky Synod of the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America and the Indiana Conference of the United Methodist 
Church are also based in the city. Contributing to an annual gross metropolitan 
product (GMP) of $125.9 billion, the Indianapolis metropolitan area is 
the 26th largest economic region in the U.S. and 42nd largest in the world.[117] 
The largest industry sectors by employment are manufacturing, health care 
and social services, and retail trade.[118] Compared to Indiana as a whole, 
the Indianapolis metropolitan area has a lower proportion of manufacturing 
jobs and a higher concentration of jobs in wholesale trade; administrative, 
support, and waste management; professional, scientific, and technical 
services; and transportation and warehousing.[118] The city's major exports 
include pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle parts, medical equipment and supplies, 
engine and power equipment, and aircraft products and parts.[11] As of 
2016[update], three Fortune 500 companies were based in the city: health 
insurance company Anthem Inc.; pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly; and Simon 
Property Group, the largest real estate investment trust in the U.S.[119] 
Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins will open its Global Distribution Headquarters 
in downtown Indianapolis in late-2016.[120] The city is home to three Fortune 
1000 companies: hydrocarbon manufacturer Calumet Specialty Products Partners; 
retailer hhgregg; and automotive transmission manufacturer Allison Transmission.[119] 
Other notable companies based in the Indianapolis metropolitan area include: 
financial services holding company CNO Financial Group (Carmel); media 
conglomerate Emmis Communications; retailers Finish Line, Lids (Zionsville), 
and Marsh Supermarkets (Fishers); regional airline owner Republic Airways; 
truckload carrier Celadon Group; and restaurant chains Noble Roman's, Scotty's 
Brewhouse, and Steak 'n Shake. Like many Midwestern cities, recent deindustrialization 
trends have had a significant impact on Indianapolis' economy. Once home 
to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile 
manufacturing in the early 20th century.[49] Between 1990 and 2012, approximately 
26,900 manufacturing jobs were lost in the city, including the automotive 
plant closures of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors.[121] In 2016, Carrier 
Corporation announced the closure of its Indianapolis plant, moving 1,400 
manufacturing jobs to Mexico.[122] Since 1915, Rolls-Royce Holdings has 
had operations in Indianapolis.[123] It is the third largest manufacturing 
employer and thirteenth largest employer overall in the city, with a workforce 
of 4,300 in aircraft engine development and manufacturing.[124] Biotechnology, 
life sciences, and health care are major sectors of Indianapolis' economy. 
As of 2016[update], Eli Lilly and Company was the largest employer in the 
city, with 11,382 workers.[125] The North American headquarters for Roche 
Diagnostics and Dow AgroSciences are also located in the city.[126] A 2014 
report by Battelle Memorial Institute and Biotechnology Industry Organization 
indicated that the Indianapolis–Carmel–Anderson MSA was the only U.S. metropolitan 
area to have specialized employment concentrations in all five bioscience 
sectors evaluated in the study: agricultural feedstock and chemicals; bioscience-related 
distribution; drugs and pharmaceuticals; medical devices and equipment; 
and research, testing, and medical laboratories.[127] The regional health 
care providers of Community Health Network, Franciscan Health, Indiana 
University Health, and St. Vincent Health have a combined workforce of 
43,700.[128] Four Interstate Highways converge in Indianapolis, with two 
additional auxiliary routes. The city is also the hub of Indiana's 4,700-mile 
(7,600 km) railroad infrastructure, the ninth most extensive in the U.S.[129][130] 
These distinctions have allowed the city to become an important logistics 
center, home to 1,500 distribution firms, employing 100,000 workers.[131] 
As home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world, Indianapolis 
International Airport ranks as the sixth busiest U.S. airport in terms 
of air cargo, handling over 1 million tons and employing 6,600 in 2015.[132][133] 
The city is an important hub for CSX Transportation, home to its division 
headquarters, an intermodal terminal, and classification yard (in the suburb 
of Avon).[134] Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops, in the enclave of Beech Grove, 
serve as its primary heavy maintenance and overhaul facility, while the 
Indianapolis Distribution Center is the company's largest material and 
supply terminal.[135][136] In 2011, the Indianapolis metropolitan area 
was ranked as the tenth largest inland port in the U.S. in terms of origin-destination 
freight tonnage.[121] The hospitality industry is an increasingly vital 
sector to the Indianapolis economy. A Rockport Analytics study found that 
27.4 million visitors generated a record $4.5 billion in 2015.[137] Indianapolis 
has long been a sport tourism destination, but has more recently relied 
on conventions.[138] The Indiana Convention Center (ICC) and Lucas Oil 
Stadium are considered mega convention center facilities, with a combined 
750,000 feet (230,000 m) of exhibition space.[139] ICC is connected to 
12 hotels and 4,700 hotel rooms, the most of any U.S. convention center.[140] 
In 2008, the facility hosted 42 national conventions with an attendance 
of 317,815; in 2014, it hosted 106 for an attendance of 635,701.[138] Since 
2003, Indianapolis has hosted Gen Con, one of the largest gaming conventions 
in North America.[141] USA Today named Indianapolis the best convention 
city in 2014.[142] Indianapolis is the fourth fastest high-tech job growth 
area in the U.S., with 28,500 information technology-related jobs at such 
companies as Angie's List, Appirio, BrightPoint, Interactive Intelligence, 
and Salesforce Marketing Cloud.[143][144] In 1999, Indianapolis designated 
six cultural districts to capitalize on cultural institutions within historically 
significant neighborhoods unique to the city's heritage. These include 
Broad Ripple Village, Canal and White River State Park, Fountain Square, 
Indiana Avenue, Mass Ave, and Wholesale.[146] A seventh cultural district, 
Market East, was designated in 2014.[147] After 12 years of planning and 
six years of construction, the Indianapolis Cultural Trail: A Legacy of 
Gene and Marilyn Glick officially opened in 2013.[148] The $62.5 million 
public-private partnership resulted in 8 miles (13 km) of urban bike and 
pedestrian corridors linking six cultural districts with neighborhoods, 
IUPUI, and every significant arts, cultural, heritage, sports, and entertainment 
venue downtown.[149][150][151][152] Indianapolis is home to dozens of annual 
festivals and events showcasing local culture. Notable events include the 
"Month of May" (a series of celebrations leading to the Indianapolis 500), 
Circle City IN Pride, Indiana Black Expo, Indiana State Fair, and Historic 
Irvington Halloween Festival. Founded in 1883, the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art (IMA) is the ninth oldest[153][note 1] and eighth largest encyclopedic 
art museum in the U.S.[155][note 2] The permanent collection comprises 
over 54,000 works, including African, American, Asian, and European pieces.[156] 
In addition to its collections, the museum consists of 100 Acres: The Virginia 
B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park; Oldfields, a restored house museum and 
estate once owned by Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.; and restored gardens and grounds 
originally designed by Percival Gallagher of the Olmsted Brothers firm.[157] 
The IMA also owns the Miller House, a Mid-Century modern home designed 
by Eero Saarinen located in Columbus, Indiana.[158] The museum's holdings 
demonstrate the institution's emphasis on the connections among art, design, 
and the natural environment.[154] The Indianapolis Art Center, located 
in Broad Ripple Village, was founded in 1934 by the Works Project Administration. 
The center opened at its Michael Graves-designed building in 1996, including 
three public art galleries, 11 studios, a library, auditorium, and ArtsPark 
along the White River.[159] The Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art 
was established in 2001, and is located in The Murphy Art Center in Fountain 
Square. In 2014, the museum opened a second public gallery in The Alexander 
Hotel at CityWay in downtown Indianapolis.[160] Eiteljorg Museum of American 
Indians and Western Art opened in 1989 at White River State Park as the 
only Native American art museum in the Midwest.[161] Indiana University 
– Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) contains the Herron School of 
Art and Design. Established in 1902, the school's first core faculty included 
Impressionist painters of the Hoosier Group: T. C. Steele, J. Ottis Adams, 
William Forsyth, Richard Gruelle, and Otto Stark. The university's public 
art collection is extensive, with more than 30 works. Indianapolis' most 
notable performing arts venues are located in the Mass Ave cultural district 
or Downtown. Located on Monument Circle since 1916, the 1,786-seat Hilbert 
Circle Theatre is the current home of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. 
The Indiana Theatre opened as a movie palace on Washington Street in 1927, 
currently housing the Indiana Repertory Theatre, a regional repertory theatre. 
Madame Walker Theatre Center also opened that year on Indiana Avenue, in 
the heart of the city's African American neighborhood. The theater is named 
for Madame C.J. Walker, an African American entrepreneur, philanthropist, 
and activist who began her beauty empire in Indianapolis. Mass Ave is home 
to the Old National Centre, Phoenix Theatre, and the Athenæum (Das Deutsche 
Haus). Old National Centre at the Murat Shrine is the oldest stage house 
in Indianapolis, opened in 1909.[163] The building is a prime example of 
Moorish Revival architecture and features a 2,600-seat performing arts 
theatre, 1,800-seat concert hall, and 600-seat multi-functional room, hosting 
approximately 300 public and private events throughout the year.[163] The 
nonprofit Phoenix Theatre focuses on contemporary theatrical productions.[164] 
The Athenӕum, houses the American Cabaret Theater and Young Actors Theater. 
Other notable venues include the Indianapolis Artsgarden, a performing 
arts center suspended over the intersection of Washington and Illinois 
streets, Clowes Memorial Hall on the Butler University campus, and The 
Emerson Theater in Little Flower. Indianapolis is home to Bands of America 
(BOA), a nationwide organization of high school marching, concert, and 
jazz bands, and the international headquarters of Drum Corps International 
(DCI), a professional drum and bugle corps association.[165] Annual music 
events include the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis, Midwest 
Music Summit, and Indy Jazz Fest. The Heartland Film Festival, Indianapolis 
International Film Festival, Indianapolis Jewish Film Festival, Indianapolis 
Theatre Fringe Festival, and the Indianapolis Alternative Media Festival 
are annual events held in the city. Indianapolis was at the center of the 
Golden Age of Indiana Literature, from 1870 to 1920.[166] Several notable 
poets and writers based in the city achieved national prominence and critical 
acclaim during this period, including James Whitcomb Riley, Booth Tarkington, 
and Meredith Nicholson.[12] In A History of Indiana Literature, Arthur 
W. Shumaker remarked on the era's influence: "It was the age of famous 
men and their famous books. In it Indiana, and particularly Indianapolis, 
became a literary center which in many ways rivaled the East."[167] A 1947 
study found that Indiana authors ranked second to New York in the number 
of bestsellers produced in the previous 40 years.[166] Located in Lockerbie 
Square, the James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home has been a National Historic 
Landmark since 1962. Perhaps the city's most famous 20th century writer 
was Kurt Vonnegut, known for his darkly satirical and controversial bestselling 
novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969). Vonnegut became known for including at 
least one character in his novels from Indianapolis.[168] Upon returning 
to the city in 1986, Vonnegut acknowledged the influence the city had on 
his writings: "All my jokes are Indianapolis. All my attitudes are Indianapolis. 
My adenoids are Indianapolis. If I ever severed myself from Indianapolis, 
I would be out of business. What people like about me is Indianapolis."[168][169] 
The Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library opened in 2010 in downtown Indianapolis.[169] 
Indianapolis is the current home to bestselling young adult fiction writer 
John Green, known for his critically acclaimed 2012 novel The Fault in 
Our Stars, set in the city.[170] The Children's Museum of Indianapolis 
is the largest of its kind in the world.[171] In total, the museum has 
472,900 square feet (43,933.85 m2) of floor space.[172] The museum has 
a collection of over 120,000 artifacts,[173] divided into three collections: 
Natural World, Cultural World, and American.[174] The museum's collection 
includes the Broad Ripple Park Carousel, a National Historic Landmark. 
Because of its leadership and innovations, the museum is a world leader 
in its field.[175] Child and Parents magazine have both ranked the museum 
as the best children's museum in the United States.[176] The "institution 
is considered the gold standard of museums for children."[177] The museum 
is one of the city's most popular attractions, with 1.2 million visitors 
in 2014.[178] The Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum (in Speedway) exhibits 
an extensive collection of auto racing memorabilia showcasing various motorsports 
and automotive history.[179][180] The museum is the permanent home of the 
Borg-Warner Trophy, presented to Indianapolis 500 winners.[16] Daily grounds 
and track tours are also based at the museum.[180] The NCAA Hall of Champions 
opened in 2000 at White River State Park housing collegiate athletic artifacts 
and interactive exhibits covering all 23 NCAA-sanctioned sports.[181][182] 
Indianapolis is home to several museums and organizations relating to Indiana 
history, including the Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War Museum, Hook's Drug 
Store Museum, Indiana Historical Society, Indiana State Library and Historical 
Bureau, Indiana State Museum, Indiana Medical History Museum, Indiana Landmarks, 
and the Indiana World War Memorial Military Museum. The Benjamin Harrison 
Presidential Site, located in the Old Northside Historic District, is open 
for daily tours and includes thousands of books and memorabilia relating 
to the 23rd President of the United States. The city contains the largest 
collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war dead in the country, 
outside of Washington, D.C.[21][22] Notable sites include: Indianapolis 
has an emerging food scene as well as established eateries.[184] Founded 
in 1821 as the city's public market, the Indianapolis City Market has served 
the community from its current building since 1886. Prior to World War 
II, the City Market and neighboring Tomlinson Hall (since demolished) were 
home to meat and vegetable vendors. As consumer habits evolved and residents 
moved from the central city, the City Market transitioned from a traditional 
marketplace to a food court, a function it retains today.[185] Opened in 
1902, St. Elmo Steak House is well known for its signature shrimp cocktail, 
named by the Travel Channel as the "world's spiciest food." In 2012, it 
was recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of "America's Classics."[186] 
The Slippery Noodle Inn, a blues bar and restaurant, is the oldest continuously 
operating tavern in Indiana, having opened in 1850.[187] The Jazz Kitchen, 
opened in 1994, was recognized in 2011 by OpenTable as one the "top 50 
late night dining hotspots" in the U.S.[188] In 2016, Condé Nast Traveler 
named Indianapolis the "most underrated food city in the U.S.," while ranking 
Milktooth as one of the best restaurants in the world.[189][190] Food & 
Wine called Indianapolis the "rising star of the Midwest," recognizing 
Milktooth, Rook, Amelia's, and Bluebeard, all in Fletcher Place.[191][192] 
Several Indianapolis chefs and restaurateurs have been semifinalists in 
the James Beard Foundation Awards in recent years.[193] Microbreweries 
are quickly becoming a staple in the city, increasing fivefold since 2009.[194] 
There are now about 50 craft brewers in Indianapolis, with Sun King Brewing 
being the largest.[195] For some time, Indianapolis was known as the "100 
Percent American City" for its racial and ethnic homogeneity.[196] Historically, 
these factors, as well as low taxes and wages, provided chain restaurants 
a relatively stable market to test dining preferences before expanding 
nationwide. As a result, the Indianapolis metropolitan area had the highest 
concentration of chain restaurants per capita of any market in the U.S. 
in 2008, with one chain restaurant for every 1,459 people, or 44% higher 
than the national average.[197] In recent years, immigrants have opened 
some 800 ethnic restaurants.[196] Two major league sports teams are based 
in Indianapolis: the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League 
(NFL) and the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). 
Originally the Baltimore Colts, the franchise has been based in Indianapolis 
since relocating there in 1984. The Colts' tenure in Indianapolis has produced 
11 division championships, two conference championships, and two Super 
Bowl appearances. Quarterback Peyton Manning led the team to win Super 
Bowl XLI in the 2006 NFL season. Lucas Oil Stadium replaced the team's 
first home, the RCA Dome, in 2008. Founded in 1967, the Indiana Pacers 
began in the American Basketball Association (ABA), joining the NBA when 
the leagues merged in 1976. Prior to joining the NBA, the Pacers won three 
division titles and three championships (1970, 1972, 1973). Since the merger, 
the Pacers have won one conference title and six division titles, most 
recently in 2014. Founded in 2000, the Indiana Fever of the Women's National 
Basketball Association (WNBA) have won three conference titles and one 
championship in 2012. The Fever and Pacers share Bankers Life Fieldhouse, 
which replaced Market Square Arena in 1999. The Indianapolis Indians of 
the International League (AAA) is the second oldest minor league franchise 
in American professional baseball, established in 1902.[198] The Indians 
have won 25 division titles, 14 league titles, and seven championships, 
most recently in 2000. Since 1996, the team has played at Victory Field, 
which replaced Bush Stadium. Of the 160 teams comprising Minor League Baseball, 
the Indians had the highest attendance during the 2016 season.[199] Established 
in 2013, Indy Eleven of the North American Soccer League (NASL) plays from 
IU Michael A. Carroll Stadium. Indy Fuel of the ECHL was founded in 2014 
and plays from Indiana Farmers Coliseum. Butler University and Indiana 
University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) are NCAA Division I 
schools based in the city. The Butler Bulldogs compete in the Big East 
Conference, except for Butler Bulldogs football, which plays in the Pioneer 
Football League FCS. The Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team were runners-up 
in the 2010 and 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Games. 
The IUPUI Jaguars compete in the Summit League. Traditionally, Indianapolis' 
Hinkle Fieldhouse was the hub for Hoosier Hysteria, a general excitement 
around the game of basketball throughout the state, specifically the Indiana 
High School Boys Basketball Tournament.[200] Hinkle, a National Historic 
Landmark, was opened in 1928 as the world's largest basketball arena, with 
seating for 15,000.[201] It is regarded as "Indiana's Basketball Cathedral." 
Perhaps the most notable game was the 1954 state championship, which inspired 
the critically acclaimed 1986 film, Hoosiers.[202] Indianapolis has been 
called the "Amateur Sports Capital of the World."[35][203] The National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the main governing body for U.S. 
collegiate sports, and the National Federation of State High School Associations 
are based in Indianapolis. The city is home to three NCAA athletic conferences: 
the Horizon League (Division I); the Great Lakes Valley Conference (Division 
II); and the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference (Division III). Indianapolis 
is also home to three national sport governing bodies, as recognized by 
the United States Olympic Committee: USA Gymnastics; USA Diving; and USA 
Track & Field.[204] Indianapolis hosts numerous sporting events annually, 
including the Circle City Classic (1983–present), NFL Scouting Combine 
(1987–present), and Big Ten Football Championship Game (2011–present). 
Indianapolis is tied with New York City for having hosted the second most 
NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships (1980, 1991, 1997, 2000, 
2006, 2010, and 2015).[205] The city will host the men's Final Four next 
in 2021.[206] Notable past events include the NBA All-Star Game (1985), 
Pan American Games X (1987), US Open Series Indianapolis Tennis Championships 
(1988–2009), World Rowing Championships (1994), World Police and Fire Games 
(2001), FIBA Basketball World Cup (2002), and Super Bowl XLVI (2012). Indianapolis 
is home to the OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon, the largest half 
marathon and seventh largest running event in the U.S.[207] The mini-marathon 
is held the first weekend of May as part of the 500 Festival, leading up 
to the Indianapolis 500. As of 2013[update], it had sold out for 12 consecutive 
years, with 35,000 participants.[208] Held in autumn, the Monumental Marathon 
is also among the largest in the U.S., with nearly 14,000 entrants in 2015.[209] 
Indianapolis is a major center for motorsports. Since 1911, Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway (IMS) (in the enclave of Speedway, Indiana) has been the 
site of the Indianapolis 500, an open-wheel automobile race held each Memorial 
Day weekend. Considered part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport, the Indianapolis 
500 is the world's largest single-day sporting event, hosting more than 
257,000 permanent seats.[16] The city is headquarters to INDYCAR, the sanctioning 
body for American Championship car racing, and more than 500 motorsports 
companies and racing teams, employing some 10,000 people in the region.[210] 
Indianapolis is so well connected with racing that it has inspired the 
name "IndyCar," used for both the competition and type of car used in it.[211] 
Since 1994, IMS has hosted Super Weekend at the Brickyard, a series of 
automobile races leading to one of NASCAR's highest attended events, the 
Sprint Cup Series Brickyard 400.[212] Since 2014, IMS has also hosted the 
Verizon IndyCar Series Grand Prix of Indianapolis. IMS hosted the seventh 
round of the 2016 Red Bull Air Race World Championship.[213] Lucas Oil 
Raceway at Indianapolis, in nearby Hendricks County, is home to the National 
Hot Rod Association (NHRA) U.S. Nationals, the most prestigious drag racing 
event in the world, held annually each Labor Day weekend.[214] Indy Parks 
and Recreation maintains nearly 200 parks covering 11,246 acres (4,551 ha).[215] 
Eagle Creek Park is the largest and most visited park in the city and ranks 
among the largest municipal parks in the U.S., covering 4,766 acres (1,929 ha).[216] 
Fishing, sailing, kayaking, canoeing, and swimming are popular activities 
at Eagle Creek Reservoir. Recreational trails, including the Canal Walk, 
Pleasant Run Trail, and Monon Trail, are used for walking, running, and 
cycling, accommodating 2.8 million users in 2012.[217] There are 13 public 
golf courses in the city.[218] Military Park was established as the city's 
first public park in 1852.[219] By the 20th century, the city enlisted 
landscape architect George Kessler to conceive a framework for Indianapolis' 
modern parks system.[220] Kessler's 1909 Indianapolis Park and Boulevard 
Plan linked notable parks, such as Brookside, Ellenberger, and Garfield, 
with a system of parkways following the city's waterways.[221] In 2003, 
the system's 3,474 acres (1,406 ha) were added to the National Register 
of Historic Places.[222] Two state parks are located in Marion County: 
Fort Harrison in Lawrence and White River downtown. Encompassing 250 acres 
(100 ha), White River is the city's major urban park, home to the Indianapolis 
Zoo and White River Gardens.[223] As of 2015[update], the zoo was home 
to nearly 1,400 animals of 214 species and 31,000 plants, including many 
threatened and endangered species.[224][223] The Indianapolis Zoo is the 
largest privately funded zoo in the U.S. and is one of the city's most 
visited attractions, with 1.2 million guests in 2014.[19][178] Indianapolis 
lies about 50 miles (80 km) north of two state forests, Morgan–Monroe and 
Yellowwood, and one national forest, Hoosier. Crown Hill Cemetery, the 
third largest private cemetery in the U.S., covers 555 acres (225 ha) on 
the city's north side and is home to more than 250 species of trees and 
shrubs.[225] According to the Trust for Public Land's 2016 ParkScore Index, 
Indianapolis ranks 95th of the 100 largest U.S. cities in accessibility 
to public parks and open space, with some 68% of residents under served.[226] 
The city's vast land area and low public funding contributed to the ranking.[226] 
Indianapolis has a consolidated city-county government known as Unigov, 
a status it has held since 1970. Under this system, many functions of the 
city and county governments are consolidated, though some remain separate. 
The city has a mayor-council form of government. The executive branch is 
headed by an elected mayor, who serves as the chief executive of both the 
city and Marion County. Joseph H. "Joe" Hogsett, a Democrat, is the 49th 
and current mayor of Indianapolis. The mayor appoints deputy mayors, department 
heads, and members of various boards and commissions. The legislative body 
for the city and county is the City-County Council, consisting of 25 members 
all of whom represent geographic districts. The council passes ordinances 
for the city and county and also makes appointments to certain boards and 
commissions. As the state capital, Indianapolis is the seat of Indiana's 
state government. The Indiana Statehouse, located downtown, houses the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government, including 
the office of the governor, Indiana General Assembly, Indiana Court of 
Appeals, and the Indiana Supreme Court. Most of the state's bureaus are 
located in the Indiana Government Center North. The Indiana Governor's 
Residence is located on Meridian Street in the Butler-Tarkington neighborhood, 
about 5 miles (8.0 km) north of downtown. Most of Indianapolis is within 
the 7th Congressional District of Indiana, represented by André Carson 
(D). Northern portions of the city are in the 5th District, represented 
by Susan Brooks (R).[227] Federal field offices are located in the Birch 
Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse (which houses the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana) and Minton-Capehart 
Federal Building. Until the late-1990s, Indianapolis was considered one 
of the most conservative major cities in the United States, but this trend 
has since gradually reversed. Unigov's absorption of Republican-leaning 
townships outside the city proper is considered the main factor in this 
shift.[61] Republicans held the mayor's office for 32 years (1967–1999), 
and controlled the City-County Council from its inception in 1970 to 2003.[61] 
More recently, Republicans have generally been stronger in the southern 
and western parts of the county (Decatur, Franklin, Perry, and Wayne, townships), 
whereas Democrats have been stronger in the central and northern parts 
of the county (Center, Pike, and Washington townships). Republican and 
Democratic prevalence is split in Warren and Lawrence townships.[228] As 
of 2014[update], the city is regarded as politically moderate.[229] Republican 
Greg Ballard chose not to run for a third term in the 2015 mayoral election.[230] 
Republican Chuck Brewer and Democrat Joe Hogsett were the candidates to 
replace him. The candidates had similar plans for addressing the city's 
issues, and the commonality between them contributed to a very low voter 
turnout.[231] Hogsett previously held public office as Indiana Secretary 
of State, and had served in government for over 30 years, giving him greater 
name recognition than Brewer, a local restaurateur.[232] Hogsett was elected 
with 63% of the vote, officially taking office on January 1, 2016.[232] 
The 2015 City-County Council elections also left Democrats in control of 
City-County Council, holding a 13–12 majority over Republicans, only the 
second time since the creation of Unigov that Democrats controlled both 
the mayor's office and council.[233] The Indianapolis Fire Department (IFD) 
provides fire protection services for 278 square miles (720 km2) of Marion 
County. IFD operates 44 stations, including 1,205 sworn firefighters. IFD 
responded to nearly 100,000 incidents in 2014.[234] As of 2016[update], 
Ernest Malone was the fire chief.[235] Indianapolis Metropolitan Police 
Department's (IMPD) jurisdiction covers most of Marion County, with the 
exception of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Speedway, and the Indianapolis Airport 
Authority.[236] In 2009, IMPD operated six precincts, including 1,617 sworn 
police personnel.[236] As of 2016[update], Troy Riggs was the chief of 
police.[237] Indianapolis was ranked as the 33rd most dangerous city in 
the U.S. in the 2008–2009 edition of CQ Press's City Crime Rankings and 
the 22nd most dangerous city according to Yahoo! Finance in 2012.[238][239] 
Yahoo! Finance also reported that the city averaged 52.2 forcible rapes 
per 100,000 people, double the national average of 26.8 forcible rapes 
per 100,000 people.[239] Between 2012 and 2014, the murder rate increased 
by 44%. There were 138 homicides in 2014, with 60% of victims being young 
black men.[240] With 144 criminal homicides, 2015 surpassed 1998 as the 
year with the most murder investigations in the city.[241] There were also 
447 nonfatal shootings in 2015, representing a 24% increase over the 361 
shootings recorded during the same time period in 2014.[241] Indianapolis 
has nine unified public school districts: Franklin Township Community School 
Corporation, MSD Decatur Township, MSD Lawrence Township, MSD Perry Township, 
MSD Pike Township, MSD Warren Township, MSD Washington Township, MSD Wayne 
Township, and Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS). IPS is the largest public 
school district in Indiana, serving nearly 30,000 students.[242] A number 
of private primary and secondary schools are operated through the Archdiocese 
of Indianapolis, charters, or other independent organizations. Public library 
services are provided to the citizens of Indianapolis and Marion County 
by the Indianapolis Public Library. Founded in 1873, the public library 
system includes the Central Library and 23 branches throughout the county. 
The Indianapolis Public Library served 4.2 million patrons in 2014, with 
a circulation of 15.9 million materials.[243] Indiana University – Purdue 
University Indianapolis (IUPUI) was founded in 1969 after merging the branch 
campuses of Indiana University and Purdue University.[244] IUPUI's current 
enrollment is 30,105, the third largest in the state.[245] IUPUI has two 
colleges and 18 schools, including the Herron School of Art and Design, 
Robert H. McKinney School of Law, and School of Dentistry.[246] The Indiana 
University School of Medicine is the largest medical school in the United 
States.[124][247] The city is home to the largest campus for Ivy Tech, 
Central Indiana Region, a state-funded community college serving nearly 
100,000 students across Indiana.[248] Five private universities are based 
in Indianapolis. Established in 1855, Butler University is the oldest higher 
education institution in the city, with an undergraduate enrollment of 
about 4,000.[249] Affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, Marian University 
was founded in 1936 when St. Francis Normal and Immaculate Conception Junior 
College merged, moving to Indianapolis in 1937. Marian has an enrollment 
of about 2,137 students.[250] Founded in 1902, the University of Indianapolis 
is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. The school's current enrollment 
is 4,169 students.[251] Martin University was founded in 1977 and is the 
state's only predominately black university.[252] Crossroads Bible College 
and Indiana Bible College are small Christian colleges located in the city. 
Satellite campuses located in the city include Ball State University College 
of Architecture and Planning, Grace College, Indiana Institute of Technology, 
Indiana Wesleyan University, and Vincennes University. Indianapolis is 
served by various print media. Founded in 1903, The Indianapolis Star is 
the city's daily morning newspaper. The Star is owned by the Gannett Company, 
with a daily circulation of 127,064.[253] The Indianapolis News was the 
city's daily evening newspaper and oldest print media, published from 1869 
to 1999. Notable weeklies include NUVO, an alternative weekly newspaper, 
the Indianapolis Recorder, a weekly newspaper serving the local African 
American community, the Indianapolis Business Journal, reporting on local 
real estate, and the Southside Times. Indianapolis Monthly is the city's 
monthly lifestyle publication. Broadcast television network affiliates

by Cumulus Media, Emmis Communications, iHeartMedia, and Radio One. Popular 
nationally syndicated radio program The Bob & Tom Show has been based at 
Indianapolis radio station WFBQ since 1983.[254] As of 2016[update], the 
Indianapolis metropolitan area was the 27th largest television market and 
39th largest radio market in the U.S.[255][256][257][258] Indianapolis 
natives Jane Pauley and David Letterman launched their notable broadcasting 
careers in local media, Pauley with WISH-TV and Letterman with WTHR-TV, 
respectively.[259][260] Movies at least partially filmed in the city include 
Speedway (1929),[261] To Please a Lady (1950),[262] Winning (1969),[263] 
Hoosiers (1986),[264] Eight Men Out (1988),[265] and Eagle Eye (2008).[266] 
Television series set in Indianapolis have included One Day at a Time; 
Good Morning, Miss Bliss; Men Behaving Badly; Close to Home;[267] the second 
season of anthology drama American Crime,[268] and HGTV's Good Bones.[269] 
Indianapolis was founded on the White River under an incorrect assumption 
that it would serve as a major transportation artery, but the river proved 
difficult to navigate and too shallow during much of the year.[33] After 
the steamboat Robert Hanna ran aground along the river in 1831, no steamboat 
successfully returned to Indianapolis. Flatboats continued to transport 
goods along a portion of the river until new dams impeded their ability 
to navigate its waters.[270] The first major federally funded highway in 
the U.S., the National Road, reached Indianapolis in 1836,[33] followed 
by the railroad in 1847. By 1850, eight railroads converged in the city, 
ending its isolation from the rest of the country and ushering in a new 
era of growth.[271] Indianapolis Union Station opened in the Wholesale 
District on September 20, 1853 as the world's first union station.[36] 
Citizen's Street and Railway Company was established in 1864, operating 
the city's first mule-drawn streetcar line.[272][273] By 1890, electric-powered 
streetcars began running.[274] Opened in 1904, the Indianapolis Traction 
Terminal was the largest interurban station in the world, handling 500 
trains daily and 7 million passengers annually.[275] Ultimately doomed 
by the automobile, the terminal closed in 1941, followed by the streetcar 
system in 1957.[276] Indianapolis is intersected by four Interstate Highways: 
Interstate 65, Interstate 69, Interstate 70, and Interstate 74. Two auxiliary 
Interstate Highways are located in the metropolitan area; a bypass (Interstate 
465) and connector (Interstate 865). The predominant mode of transportation 
is the automobile, with 92.6% of Indianapolis–Carmel–Anderson MSA residents 
commuting by car, most traveling alone (83.4%).[277] This reliance on the 
automobile has had a major impact on the city's development patterns, with 
Walk Score ranking Indianapolis as one of the least walkable large cities 
in the U.S.[278] Only 2.7% of residents walk or bike to work.[277] Despite 
this reliance, the city has encouraged enhanced bicycle and pedestrian 
infrastructure in recent years. Indianapolis includes some 75 miles (121 km) 
of trails and 90 miles (140 km) of on-street bike lanes.[279] A 27-station 
bike sharing system was inaugurated in 2014.[280] An electric carsharing 
program, BlueIndy, was launched in 2015. The program will ultimately include 
500 electric cars and 200 charging stations throughout the city.[281] The 
Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation, branded as IndyGo, has 
operated the city's public transportation system since 1975. Recent efforts 
to expand mass transit in the metropolitan area have been initiated through 
a $1.2 billion regional bus rapid transit plan called Indy Connect.[282] 
The first segment to be constructed is Phase I of the Red Line, traveling 
14 miles (23 km) from Broad Ripple Village to the University of Indianapolis.[283] 
In 2011, a private company called the Downtown Indianapolis Streetcar Corporation 
began studying the feasibility of a streetcar circulator for downtown Indianapolis.[276] 
Despite only 1% of residents commuting via public transportation,[277] 
IndyGo had a 2014 ridership of 10.3 million, the highest in 23 years.[284] 
In 2016, the Julia M. Carson Transit Center opened, the downtown hub for 
27 bus routes.[285] Indianapolis International Airport (IND) is the busiest 
airport in the state, serving 8 million passengers in 2015.[286] Completed 
in 2008, the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal contains two concourses, 40 gates, 
and includes parking for 14,000 vehicles.[287] IND connects to 45 domestic 
and international destinations, averaging 143 daily departures.[286] As 
home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world, IND ranks as 
the sixth busiest U.S. airport in terms of air cargo, handling over 1 million 
tons in 2015.[132][288] The Indianapolis Airport Authority also manages 
Eagle Creek Airpark and the only public-use heliport in the state, the 
Indianapolis Downtown Heliport.[289] Amtrak currently provides two intercity 
rail lines to Indianapolis via Union Station, serving about 30,000 passengers 
in 2015.[136] The Cardinal makes three weekly trips between New York City 
and Chicago, while the Hoosier State operates on the four days the Cardinal 
does not operate, running to Chicago. Indianapolis is a proposed connection 
on the Chicago Hub Network, a high-speed rail line that would run between 
Chicago and Cincinnati. Three intercity bus service providers stop in the 
city: Greyhound Lines and Burlington Trailways (via Union Station), and 
Megabus (via City Market).[290] The Indiana University Health People Mover 
opened in 2003 connecting Indiana University Health's medical centers with 
related facilities on the IUPUI campus. It is currently the lone example 
of commuter rail in Indianapolis and is also notable for being the only 
private transportation system in the U.S. elevated above public streets.[291][292] 
Indianapolis Emergency Medical Services (IEMS) covers six townships within 
the city (Center, Franklin, Lawrence, Perry, Warren, and Washington) and 
the town of Speedway. IEMS responded to nearly 100,000 emergency dispatch 
calls in 2014.[293] Indiana University Health's Academic Health Center 
encompasses Marion County, with the medical centers of University Hospital, 
Methodist Hospital, and Riley Hospital for Children. The Academic Health 
Center is anchored by the Indiana University School of Medicine, the second 
largest medical school in the U.S.[124][247] Riley Hospital for Children 
is among the nation's foremost pediatric health centers, recognized in 
all ten specialties by U.S. News and World Report, including top 25 honors 
in orthopedics (23), nephrology (22), gastroenterology and GI surgery (16), 
pulmonology (13), and urology (4).[294] The 430-bed facility also contains 
Indiana's only Pediatric Level I Trauma Center.[295] Indianapolis' public 
medical center, the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital, reopened in 2013 
after a $754 million project to replace Wishard Memorial Hospital on the 
IUPUI campus. Eskenazi includes an Adult Level I Trauma Center, 315 beds, 
and 275 exam rooms, annually serving 1.2 million outpatients.[296] Opened 
in 1932, the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center is Indiana's tertiary 
referral hospital for former armed services personnel, treating more than 
60,000 veterans annually.[297] Located on the city's far north side, St. 
Vincent Indianapolis Hospital is the flagship medical center of St. Vincent 
Health's 22-hospital system. St. Vincent Indianapolis includes Peyton Manning 
Children's Hospital, St. Vincent Heart Center of Indiana, St. Vincent Seton 
Specialty Hospital, and St. Vincent Women's Hospital. Franciscan Health 
Indianapolis' flagship medical center is located on the city's far south 
side. Community Health Network includes four medical centers in Marion 
County, including Community Westview Hospital, Community Hospital South, 
Community Hospital North, and Community Hospital East. Community Hospital 
East is currently replacing its 60-year-old facility with a $175 million, 
150-bed hospital to be completed in 2019.[298] The campus will also include 
a $120 million, 159-bed state-funded mental health and chronic addiction 
treatment facility. The Indiana Neuro-Diagnostic Institute will replace 
the antiquated Larue D. Carter Memorial Hospital in 2018.[299] According 
to Indianapolis-based American College of Sports Medicine's 2016 American 
Fitness Index Data Report, the city scored last of the 50 largest U.S. 
metropolitan areas for health and community fitness.[300] Higher instances 
of obesity, coronary heart disease, diabetes, smoking, and asthma contributed 
to the ranking.[301] Electricity is provided by Indianapolis Power & Light 
(IPL), a subsidiary of AES Corporation.[302] IPL generates 3,343 MW of 
electricity at four power stations, two wind farms,[303] and 34 solar farms,[304] 
covering a service area of 528 square miles (1,370 km2).[305] Despite a 
portfolio comprised 100% of nonrenewable energy sources in 2007, IPL ended 
coal-firing operations at its Harding Street Station in 2016.[303] In 2016, 
Indianapolis had the second highest number of photovoltaics (PVs) per capita 
in the U.S.[304] Citizens Energy Group, a public charitable trust, provides 
residents with natural gas, water, wastewater, and thermal services.[306][307] 
Covanta Energy operates a waste-to-energy plant in the city, processing 
solid waste for steam production.[307][308] Steam is sold to Citizens Thermal 
Energy's Perry K. Generating Station for the downtown Indianapolis district 
heating system, the second largest in the U.S.[309] Republic Services and 
Ray's Trash Service provides curbside solid waste and recycling removal. 
Indianapolis has six sister cities and two friendship cities as designated 
by Sister Cities International.[310] Sister cities Friendship cities Bold
