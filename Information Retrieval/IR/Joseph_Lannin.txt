Joseph John Lannin (April 23, 1866 â€“ 15 May 1928) was a Canadian-born American 
baseball entrepreneur.[1] He was born on April 23, 1866 in Lac-Beauport, 
Quebec, Canada to John Lannin and Catherine Evans. His parents were Irish 
immigrants.[1] Orphaned at the age of 14, Joseph Lannin migrated from Quebec 
to Boston, Massachusetts where he worked as a hotel bellboy. He married 
Hannah Furlong and had two children, Paul Joseph Lannin and Dorothy A. 
Lannin. He had made the road Lac-Beauport Boston on foot. Although he had 
limited education, Lannin was personable and possessed a quick mind. He 
soon learned about real estate and the commodities market by listening 
to the conversations of the wealthy patrons at his hotel and taking advice 
from those who were willing to share their insights with him.A confident 
and knowledgeable Joseph Lannin invested his savings in the commodities 
market, making a small fortune. From there he began to acquire other businesses 
and eventually built an empire of hotels, apartment buildings, and golf 
courses. On December 21, 1913, Lannin and a group of investors purchased 
50% of the Boston Red Sox baseball team from Jimmy McAleer and Robert B. 
McRoy. In 1914 he became the sole owner of the Red Sox and in that same 
year he purchased the rights to bring Babe Ruth to Boston resulting in 
his team winning the 1915 World Series and 1916 World Series. Joseph Lannin 
sold the team in 1917 to Harry Frazee for $675,000.[1] With profit made 
from the sale of his team, he continued to invest in real estate ventures 
in Boston and across New York State. He acquired Roosevelt Airfield where 
Charles Lindbergh began his historic transatlantic flight. Lannin provided 
Lindbergh with a room at his nearby hotel and watched the takeoff from 
Roosevelt Airfield on May 20, 1927. He died on May 15, 1928, aged 62, in 
Brooklyn, New York City. He had jumped from a window at the Hotel Granada.
