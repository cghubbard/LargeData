is located in Harlem in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The 20.17-acre 
(81,600 m2) park, centered on a massive and steep outcropping of schist 
and surrounded by flat lawns and playing fields, interrupts the flow of 
Fifth Avenue traffic,[1] which is routed around the park via Mount Morris 
Park West. The park is bounded by 120th Street and 124th Street and by 
Madison Avenue on its east side. The park is operated and maintained by 
the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Before the arrival 
of Europeans, the rocky hill was used by Native Americans as a lookout 
station to see over the entire island. During the American Revolutionary 
War, Hessian soldiers "mounted a battery on [the hill]," "to command the 
mouth of the Harlem River." [2] When Fifth Avenue was extended north of 
Central Park as the railroads made Upper Manhattan more accessible, the 
rocky hill proved a difficult obstacle to clear; it was set aside for public 
use in 1836 and officially opened in 1840.[3] Music has been played in 
the park since its beginnings, with the Parks Department promoting performances 
in 1872 and 1893.[4] By 1900 a refreshment booth had been built at the 
120th Street and Madison Avenue entrance to the park.[5] A long vehicular 
tunnel to send Fifth Avenue through the center of the rock was proposed 
by Manhattan Borough President Samuel Levy and approved by Robert Moses 
in 1936.[2] It was never built. In the summer of 1969 the park was the 
site of the Harlem Cultural Festival, a series of concerts that came to 
be known as "Black Woodstock." Early Dutch settlers called the hill Slang 
Berg, or Snake Hill. This name was commonly used before the park was created. 
When the park was opened to the public in 1840, the park was possibly named 
for newly elected Mayor Robert Morris, although the origin of this name 
is not certain.[6] In 1970, the Community Thing and other activist groups 
suggested naming the park for Marcus Garvey, a publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, 
activist for black nationalism, and founder of the Universal Negro Improvement 
Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL). They also asked 
that a portion of the newly built recreation center contain a Garvey Museum.[7] 
August of that year saw the African Nationalist Activist Movement calling 
for a Marcus Garvey Day celebration, with the New York Times noting that 
the park was already being "called Garvey Memorial Park by some persons."[8] 
More than 1,000 reportedly attended the celebration in the park.[9] City 
Council voted to officially rename the park to Marcus Garvey Memorial Park 
in 1973, during the same vote in which "Welfare Island" was renamed Roosevelt 
Island.[10] The portion of Fifth Avenue in Harlem was also proposed to 
be renamed Marcus Garvey Boulevard by advocates and the two surrounding 
Community Boards in 1988, but this effort ultimately failed amid complaints 
from residents who feared that the street would lose its reputation and 
lead to confusion.[11] The Harlem Fire Watchtower was designed by Julius 
H. Kroehl and erected in 1855–57 of cast iron. The tower was fitted with 
a 10,000 pound bell cast by Jones & Hitchcock. The watchtower allowed observers 
to use the natural elevation of the park and the added height of the structure 
to search for fires, in an era when most buildings were made of wood. The 
47-foot (14 m) cast-iron tower is the only one to survive of eleven that 
had been constructed in the city, and was designated as a landmark in 1967. 
The watchtower, still bearing its bell, is located at the center of the 
park on an artificial plateau called The Acropolis. Facilities in the park 
include the Pelham Fritz Recreation Center and the Richard Rogers Amphitheater 
(both located on the west side of the park at 122nd Street), and Swimming 
Pool (open in summer) on the north side of the park, and two playgrounds 
designed for infants and disabled children, which were built in 1993. A 
Little League baseball field occupies the southwest corner of the park. 
A dog run with wood chip footing is located on the southeast corner of 
the park. Much of the rusticated stonework stairs and walling has been 
patched with concrete; capstones have been dislodged by vandals. Sections 
of the upper part are closed off with chainlink fencing. Most of the park
