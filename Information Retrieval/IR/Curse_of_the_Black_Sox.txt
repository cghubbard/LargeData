The Curse of the Black Sox (also known as the Curse of Shoeless Joe) (1919â€“2005) 
was a superstition or "scapegoat" cited as one reason for the failure of 
the Chicago White Sox to win the World Series from 1920 until 2005. As 
with other supposed baseball curses, such as the crosstown Chicago Cubs' 
Curse of the Billy Goat, or the Boston Red Sox' Curse of the Bambino, these 
"curses" have been publicized by the popular media over the course of time. 
The White Sox were dealt a severe blow in 1919 by the Black Sox scandal, 
with several star players being suspended at a crucial time late in the 
1920 season. Conventional wisdom has it that the Sox were headed for another 
pennant and championship and that the suspensions knocked them out of the 
race. In reality, the last game for the "Eight Men Out" was September 27, 
just three games from the end of their season. At that point the Sox had 
won 3 in a row and were sitting at 95-56 with 3 games to play.[1] The Cleveland 
Indians were also in a hot streak, at 94-54 with 6 games to play, and halfway 
through a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Browns.[2] The Indians were 
just a few percentage points ahead of the White Sox. The Indians would 
close the season with 4 wins and 2 losses, and finish with a 98-56 record. 
The Sox would lose 2 of their final 3 to finish 96-58. If the Sox had swept 
their final series against the Browns and the Indians record stayed the 
same, the American League would have had its first pennant playoff. Even 
discounting any morale boost the Indians might have received from the news 
of the Sox players' suspensions, the Sox return to the World Series was 
by no means ensured, even if there had been no suspensions. If they had 
finished tied, it would be noted that the Indians had won 12 of the clubs' 
22 meetings, but the Sox had taken 2 of 3 in their most recent series. 
In any case, the Sox finished in second place, two games behind the Indians, 
who went on to win (and make some history) in the 1920 World Series. However, 
the New York Yankees, who finished in third place just a game behind the 
Sox in Babe Ruth's first year with the club, would go on to win the next 
three American League pennants, starting a dynasty that would be a difficult 
hurdle for the other AL clubs, including the White Sox, for many decades 
thereafter. With the players' suspensions becoming permanent, the Sox fell 
to seventh place in 1921. It would be the mid-1930s before the team returned 
to the upper half of the league, and the early 1950s before they became 
regular contenders again. When the White Sox finally won their next pennant, 
in 1959, Jack Brickhouse called the final out of the pennant-clinching 
game: "A forty year wait has now ended!" At that time, four decades was 
the longest stretch any major league team had gone without a World Series 
appearance. In that sense, the Black Sox "curse", or the apparent pall 
cast over the franchise for some decades in the wake of the scandal, had 
also finally ended. Despite the team's pennant victory, however, they lost 
the 1959 World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. The White 
Sox remained competitive for the next several years, but were not quite 
good enough to win. After a slump, they became contenders again starting 
in the late 1970s, and qualified for post-season play by winning the American 
League West division title in 1983 and 1993 and the American League Central 
division title in 2000. The "curse" discussion was revived by the national 
media during the 2005 post-season, when the Sox won their first league 
championship since 1959 (an even longer wait than before, 46 years). During 
the ensuing 2005 World Series, the White Sox swept the Houston Astros for 
their first World Series Championship in 88 years (87 if the cancelled 
1994 World Series is excluded). Some of this discussion found its way to 
the official World Series film DVD. For example, White Sox center fielder 
Aaron Rowand, in an interview for the DVD, compared the 2004 Red Sox with 
the 2005 White Sox: "If they could break their 'curse', so could we." In 
one of those ways that patterns appear to emerge in sporting events, the 
White Sox World Series win in 2005, along with the Boston Red Sox win in 
2004, symmetrically bookended the two teams' previous World Series winners 
and the long gaps between, with the Red Sox and White Sox last Series wins 
having come in 1918 and 1917, respectively. There is a large faction of 
White Sox fans who dismiss the idea of a curse against the White Sox as 
a ridiculous (yet successful) ploy by the national media to sensationalize 
the team in efforts for increased ratings, instead attributing their drought 
to the more obvious reason: team mismanagement. The Comiskeys were very 
conservative spenders (which many hypothesize to be the reason that the 
Black Sox scandal even occurred in the first place) and it was not until 
1958 that the family gave up majority ownership to Bill Veeck, who was 
an innovative marketer but lacked sufficient resources to compete with 
wealthier teams. Ownership then passed to the Allyn brothers, who almost 
moved the team to Milwaukee while mediocre on-field performance continued. 
The team was then reacquired by Veeck, who sold it to current majority 
owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who also owns the NBA's Chicago Bulls on the West
