Mark Thomas DeRosa (born February 26, 1975) is an American former professional 
baseball player. DeRosa primarily played third and second base, but started 
at every position other than center field, pitcher, and catcher. DeRosa 
was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 7th round of the June 1996 amateur 
draft. DeRosa currently works for MLB Network as a personality on MLB Central. 
DeRosa was born in Passaic, New Jersey.[1] He grew up in Carlstadt, New 
Jersey and attended Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, New Jersey 
where he earned all-state honors in baseball and in football.[2][3] He 
graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 
the class of 1997,[4] where he started at quarterback in the 1993â€“95 seasons 
and played varsity baseball from 1994 to 1996. He was originally pledging 
The Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity when their charter was revoked. This resulted 
in his pledging the Sigma Chi Fraternity and in 2009 he was honored by 
being named a Significant Sig., an award given to Sigma Chis who have achieved 
distinction in their professional fields of endeavor. DeRosa was also one 
of six Ivy Leaguers on major league rosters at the beginning of the 2009 
season.[5] DeRosa was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 7th round (212th 
overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. He made his MLB debut 
on September 2, 1998 as a shortstop. From 1998 through 2001, DeRosa spent 
much of his time as a backup utility player, playing both infield and outfield. 
In 2002, though still playing as a backup, DeRosa was starting to play 
more and more, and enjoyed a successful batting average of .297. DeRosa 
started the 2004 season as the starting third baseman for the Braves. He 
had been strictly a backup the previous bunch of years, but the departure 
of Vinny Castilla opened the spot for him. His performance as a starter 
was widely considered unacceptable. DeRosa himself spoke openly of his 
poor performance, declaring in one interview that even his mother could 
not tell him she thought he was playing well. After about a month, DeRosa 
was demoted back to a backup. Chipper Jones moved from left field to third 
base, where he had played his whole career until 2002. Jones was replaced 
in left field by a platoon of Charles Thomas, an unknown[to whom?] rookie, 
and Eli Marrero, a fairly obscure[citation needed] catcher/outfielder who 
was considered[by whom?] the much less important half of the trade in which 
the Braves acquired him and J. D. Drew for pitchers Jason Marquis, Ray 
King, and Adam Wainwright. At the end of 2004, the Braves declined to offer 
DeRosa a contract for the 2005 season. After the Braves declined to offer 
DeRosa a contract, he signed with the Texas Rangers. He logged little playing 
time due to injuries in 2005 which delayed him from playing in the starting 
lineup. Finally healthy in May 2006, he received the opportunity to start. 
DeRosa responded to this by hitting well over .300 for the first half of 
the season. At season's end, he topped his career high in RBI with 74, 
eclipsing his previous career high of 31. DeRosa also set a career high 
in home runs, with 13, and batted a respectable .296. He set a career high 
with getting 40 doubles. On November 14, 2006 he signed a three-year, $13 
million contract with the Chicago Cubs. DeRosa's signing was one of several 
off-season acquisitions by the Cubs in their spending spree. He was a pleasant 
surprise at the plate in 2007, his first year with the Cubs. He appeared 
in 149 games for the Cubs, with the majority of his time at second base, 
but filling in at times all over the field. DeRosa batted .293 with 10 
home runs and 74 RBIs.[6] DeRosa on February 23, 2008, was taken to a hospital 
after having trouble breathing and having a rapid heart beat.[7] On February 
28, 2008, DeRosa had a successful heart procedure at Northwestern Memorial 
Hospital to correct an irregular heartbeat. His heart procedure earned 
him the nickname of "the Pulse", which was also the name of his blog on 
www.cubs.com. DeRosa had a very successful 2008 season, where he helped 
the Cubs to the best record in the National League. He had career highs 
in home runs with 21 and RBIs with 87. On December 31, 2008, DeRosa was 
traded to the Cleveland Indians for minor league pitchers Jeff Stevens, 
Chris Archer, and John Gaub.[8] Playing third base for the Indians, DeRosa 
collected his first hit with the Tribe on April 10 and his first home run 
on April 12. In addition to playing 3rd base for the Indians, he also spent 
time at first base and in the outfield. Many early-season injuries to Indians 
regulars caused DeRosa to be moved around the field and the batting order 
throughout the season. In spite of this, he was on pace to make 2009 his 
most productive season yet. He received a standing ovation from Cubs fans 
when the Cleveland Indians played at Wrigley Field on June 19.[9] The fans 
applauded him, an opposing player, in an at-bat against their home team 
in a tie game. On June 27, 2009, DeRosa was traded by Cleveland to the 
Cardinals for relief pitchers Chris Perez and Jess Todd.[10] He spent some 
time on the disabled list with a wrist injury, and underwent surgery on 
October 26 to repair a torn tendon sheath. DeRosa filed for free agency 
for the 2010 season, turning down the Cardinals' offer of salary arbitration.[11] 
On December 29, 2009, DeRosa signed a 2-year, $12 million contract with 
the San Francisco Giants.[12][13] At the beginning of the 2010 season, 
DeRosa immediately went into a prolonged slump, batting only .194 in his 
first 26 games, with only four extra base hits and 10 RBIs. Experiencing 
numbness in the fingers of his left hand, he underwent a medical examination 
on May 11, 2010, and found that the wrist surgery in 2009 had been a "total 
failure".[14] On June 22, 2010, Giants officially announced DeRosa incurred 
a season ending surgery.[15] Despite his wrist, the Giants went on to win 
the World Series that year. DeRosa began the 2011 season reportedly healthy 
and ready to make an impact on the field.[16] However, on May 18, 2011, 
he reinjured his surgically repaired left wrist on a checked swing so badly 
that many speculated his career was over.[17] But DeRosa, who had torn 
a wrist tendon on that checked swing, reworked his swing to become more 
of a singles hitter and returned to the Giants on August 4, 2011, after 
a rehab assignment with the San Jose Giants and the Fresno Grizzlies.[18] 
On December 22, 2011, DeRosa signed a one-year deal with the Washington 
Nationals.[19] On April 29, 2012, DeRosa was placed on the 15-day DL with 
an oblique strain to make room for first-base/outfield prospect Tyler Moore. 
He was hitting .081, or 3-37, with 2 RBI in 13 games. He returned from 
the disabled list on September 1. Despite DeRosa's limited playing time, 
he became an important mentor for his Nationals teammates, many of whom 
are much younger. The day after the Nationals lost the game five of the 
divisional series to the St. Louis Cardinals reporters asked him if he 
was going to put a uniform on again (to retire) and DeRosa stated "I don't 
know if I'm okay with that yet."[20][21] On January 22, 2013, DeRosa signed 
a one-year deal worth $775,000 with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a $750,000 
club option for the 2014 season.[22] Pitcher Sam Dyson was designated for 
assignment to make room for DeRosa.[23] In a game against the Houston Astros 
on July 27, 2013, DeRosa hit his 100th career home run, a solo shot to 
lead off the second inning. In August, DeRosa was placed on revocable waivers 
and claimed by an unnamed team on August 7,[24] but no trade occurred. 
On the season, DeRosa was used most as a pinch-hitter, but also started 
some at third base, second base, first base and designated hitter. In 88 
games in 2013, DeRosa hit .235/.326/.407 with 7 HR and 36 RBI, including 
hitting .286/.448/.476 with 1 HR, 8 RBI and 7 BB as a pinch-hitter. In 
late October, the Blue Jays exercised their $750,000 option on DeRosa for 
the 2014 season. On November 12, 2013, the Blue Jays announced that DeRosa 
had informed the team he was retiring.[25] He retired to accept a position 
as a studio analyst with the MLB Network.[26] DeRosa is married to former 
model Heidi Miller, with whom he has a daughter, Gabriella Faith.[citation

DeRosa moved to Hillsborough, California, and currently resides in Atlanta,
