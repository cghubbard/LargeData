The Little League World Series competes in the Great Lakes Region which 
is one of eight United States regions that currently sends teams, the largest 
youth baseball competition in the world. The region's participation in 
the LLWS dates back to 1957, when it was known as the Central Region. However, 
when the LLWS was expanded in 2001 from eight teams (four U.S. teams and 
four "International" teams from the rest of the world) to 16 teams (eight 
U.S. and eight International), the Central Region was split into the Great 
Lakes and Midwest Regions. The Great Lakes Region has a unique definition 
that does not correspond with the normally understood definition of the 
"Great Lakes" area, even when the context is restricted to the U.S. Although 
eight U.S. states (and the Canadian province of Ontario) border on the 
Great Lakes, only five of the U.S. states are in Little League's Great 
Lakes Region: One state that does not border any of the Great Lakes, and 
in fact has no territory within the Great Lakes watershed, is included 
in this region: Two states that border on the Great Lakes, New York and 
Pennsylvania are part of the Mid-Atlantic region. The remaining U.S. state 
that borders on the Great Lakes, Minnesota, is in the Midwest region. All 
of Canada, including Ontario, forms a single Little League region. The
