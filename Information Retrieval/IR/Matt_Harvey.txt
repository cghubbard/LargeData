Matthew Edward "Matt" Harvey (born March 27, 1989) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Every time Harvey pitches, Mets fans refer to it as "Harvey Day".[1] Harvey 
previously played at Fitch Senior High School in Groton, Connecticut. After 
being drafted in the third round of the 2007 MLB draft by the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim, he decided not to sign with the Angels and attended 
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was drafted again in 
the 2010 MLB draft by the Mets as the seventh overall pick. In his major 
league debut on July 26, 2012, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Harvey 
set a new club record with 11 strikeouts while earning his first career 
victory.[2] Harvey had a breakout season in 2013, being selected to play 
in his first Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Harvey then missed the 
entire 2014 season due to Tommy John surgery but returned to top form in 
2015, leading the Mets to the pennant. After a 2013 magazine cover compared 
him to Batman, Harvey and his fans have embraced "The Dark Knight" as his 
nickname. Harvey was born in New London, Connecticut; he is the only son 
and youngest of three children of Ed and Jackie Harvey, both teachers.[3] 
He is of Irish and Italian descent.[4] Harvey was raised in Mystic, Connecticut, 
with his two older sisters, Jessica and Jocelyn. His father was a standout 
athlete at Groton, Connecticut's Fitch Senior High School and attended 
the University of Connecticut where he played both baseball (as a centerfielder)[5] 
and football, even appearing in the 1972 College World Series.[3] After 
UConn, he eventually returned to Groton to coach his former high school 
baseball team.[6] Harvey grew up as a New York Yankees fan, especially 
admiring Paul O'Neill and Derek Jeter, whom he has described as a childhood 
idol of his.[7][8] At the beginning of every elementary school year, when 
asked to write about his life goals, Harvey would write that he wanted 
to play professional baseball.[3] At Fitch Senior High School, Harvey played 
both baseball (where he was coached by his dad) and basketball. He was 
teammates with future Major League pitcher Jesse Hahn on both teams.[9] 
As a high school freshman, he was able on a few occasions to throw as fast 
as 90 miles per hour (140 km/h).[10] Harvey also played summer baseball 
for numerous travel teams across the country, including the South Florida 
Bandits, the Midland Redskins, and the East Coast Grays.[11] As a high 
school senior, he was selected as a Rawlings First Team All-American and 
named to their Northeast All-Region First Team.[11] He was grouped with 
Madison Bumgarner and Rick Porcello as one of the best pitchers in the 
2007 MLB draft and a likely first round pick.[3][6] Baseball America ranked 
him the best high school prospect in 2007.[12] However, he fell to the 
Los Angeles Angels in the third round with the 118th overall pick. As the 
Angels offered only a $1 million signing bonus, Harvey took the advice 
of his advisors, Bill Caudill and Scott Boras, and opted to sign with the 
UNC Tar Heels instead.[3] Harvey would go on to pitch three seasons at 
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in sports 
administration.[13][14] During his collegiate career, Harvey went 22–7 
with 3.73 earned run average (ERA) in 238 2⁄3 innings pitched.[14] He ranks 
ninth all-time in UNC history in strikeouts (263) and 10th in wins (22).[14] 
Harvey spent the summers of ’08 and ’09 pitching for the Chatham Anglers 
of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Harvey was a key component of the Anglers’ 
2008 bullpen, completing the season with a 0.83 ERA, the lowest on the 
team, pitching 21 2⁄3 innings and striking out 29 of 92 batters faced. 
Harvey returned to Chatham in 2009 after a difficult sophomore year on 
the mound. As Harvey explains, he had lost some of the mechanics and flexibility 
that had made him such a great pitcher throughout high school and the beginning 
of his college career. Although his ’09 summer was not as impressive as 
the previous one, his time on the Cape helped him return to the basics 
and set him on the road to becoming the seventh overall draft pick in the 
2010 first year player draft. According to his pitching coach at UNC, Scott 
Forbes, Harvey returned from the 2009 Cape League season with "a more professional 
approach." Harvey was selected as the seventh overall pick by the New York 
Mets in the 2010 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft.[15] Harvey 
was listed at 6' 4" and 210 lbs, batting and throwing right-handed.[16][17] 
In 2011, Harvey's first professional season in the Mets minor-league system, 
he split time between the single-A St. Lucie Mets and the Double-A Binghamton 
Mets. With St. Lucie in the Florida State League (FSL), he went 8–2 with 
a 2.37 ERA and recorded 92 strikeouts in 76 innings.[18] His performance 
garnered him two FSL Pitcher of the Week awards and he was selected as 
a FSL Mid-Season All-Star.[18] Although selected to appear in the FSL All-Star 
game, Harvey did not pitch because he was promoted to Double-A Binghamton.[19] 
In the Eastern League with Binghamton, he went 5–3 with a 4.53 ERA and 
64 strikeouts in 59.2 innings. Harvey also pitched in the 2011 All-Star 
Futures Game, recording a save for the winning U.S. team over the World 
team.[20] Harvey was ranked as the Mets organization's second best prospect 
in 2012 and the 34th overall best prospect by MLB.com.[21] He was invited 
to spring training by the Mets that year but did not make the team. Instead, 
he was promoted to the club's Triple-A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons of 
the International League (IL).[22] In the first half of his 2012 season 
at Triple-A, Harvey went 7–4 with a 3.39 ERA in 18 starts.[23] That performance 
earned him IL Mid-Season All-Star honors. His strong pitching, plus injuries 
to major leaguers Mike Pelfrey and Dillon Gee, put him in contention for 
the fifth spot in the Mets rotation.[23] Despite spending more time pitching 
at Triple-A than other top draft picks — 105 innings, recording a 3.34 
ERA and striking out over a batter per inning through mid-July[24] — the 
Mets front office (headed by general manager Sandy Alderson) did not want 
to promote Harvey until his consistency and control were better.[25] After 
an injury to staff ace Johan Santana and replacements to the Mets' major-league 
rotation failed to turn in quality starts, general manager Sandy Alderson 
and Mets manager Terry Collins backtracked and decided to promote Harvey 
to the majors, ending his stay with the Bisons with a 7–5 record and 3.68 
ERA.[26] Harvey stayed in the rotation for the remainder of the season 
as the fifth starter.[27] In Harvey's debut, a July 26 start against the 
Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona, he pitched 5 1⁄3 
innings, giving up three hits and three walks while recording 11 strikeouts.[2] 
Harvey recorded his first major-league strikeout against the first batter 
he faced, Gerardo Parra of the Diamondbacks.[2] He then had his first major 
league hit, a two-out double off of Wade Miley in the top of the following 
inning.[2] Harvey set a Mets franchise record for strikeouts in a pitching 
debut (11) and became the first player in modern baseball history (since 
1900) to strike out 10 or more batters and get two hits in his major-league 
debut.[2] After the game, Mets manager Terry Collins said:[2] "I haven't 
seen 98 out of a starting pitcher in quite some time. He's lived up to 
exactly what everybody's talked about." In his second major-league start, 
against the San Francisco Giants, Harvey pitched six innings, gave up two 
earned runs, three walks and struck out seven in his first loss.[28] His 
18 total strikeouts were a Mets record for a rookie over his first two 
games of his career.[28] After three straight losses, Harvey was able to 
earn his second win against the Cincinnati Reds on August 16.[29] In his 
next two starts, Harvey got a no-decision and a win against the Rockies 
and Phillies, respectively.[30][31] Both were quality starts and he struck 
out 15 combined in the games. Over his first 15 at-bats in seven starts, 
he posted impressive batting numbers with a .462 average, two doubles and 
three runs batted in (RBIs). Harvey then went on to lose his next two starts 
and record a no-decision in his last outing of the season on September 
19. Despite more opportunities to pitch, Mets management ended his season 
due to an innings-pitched limit. He finished his inaugural season with 
a 3–5 record, a 2.73 ERA over 10 starts in which he pitched 59 1⁄3 innings 
and recorded 70 strikeouts. He surrendered 42 hits and 26 walks. Harvey 
continued to garner accolades for his arm strength and control in 2013. 
New York sports radio host Mike Francesa has compared Harvey to standouts 
like Justin Verlander, Andy Pettitte and Curt Schilling. After watching 
Harvey's first two starts of the 2013 season, during which he struck out 
19 in 14 innings, former Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Harvey had the 
potential to be "the best Met pitcher to ever wear the uniform." [32] His 
April performance garnered him Pitcher of the Month honors after he posted 
a 1.56 ERA with 46 strikeouts in 40.1 innings. Opposing batters hit .153 
against him. Dwight Gooden gave him the nickname The Real Deal after he 
saw him pitch live. On April 13, Harvey had a no-hit bid through 6 2/3 
innings against the Minnesota Twins until Justin Morneau hit a solo home 
run in the bottom of the seventh inning. On May 7, while pitching with 
a severe nosebleed Harvey retired the first 20 Chicago White Sox batters 
he faced until Alex Ríos broke up the perfect game with an infield single. 
Harvey left the game after nine innings, having surrendered only the one 
hit, as the Mets won in 10 innings.[33] He was subsequently featured on 
the cover of the May 20, 2013 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine, dubbed 
"The Dark Knight of Gotham."[34] On June 18, Harvey took another no-hitter 
into the seventh inning, but was stymied by an infield single off the bat 
of the Atlanta Braves' Jason Heyward.[35] Harvey notched a career-high 
13 strikeouts in the game, giving up three hits over seven innings.[35] 
As the mid-season All-Star break approached, team management talked about 
limiting Harvey's innings to ensure his pitching health. Harvey had thrown 
117 innings in 17 starts at the time, which put him on a season-long pace 
for 240–250 innings. Mets manager Terry Collins said Harvey would not be 
allowed to pitch more than 215–220 innings.[36][37] Harvey was the starting 
pitcher for the 2013 MLB All-Star Game, which took place at the Mets' home 
ballpark, Citi Field in which he pitched the first two innings.[38] On 
August 7, Harvey pitched his first career complete game shutout, giving 
up four hits and striking out six in a 5–0 win over the Colorado Rockies.[39] 
On August 26, Harvey was diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral 
ligament in his right elbow and was placed on the disabled list.[40] He 
had logged 178 1/3 innings at that point. On September 17, Harvey said 
he would try rehab before opting for surgery.[41] But the Mets announced 
on October 4 that Harvey would have Tommy John surgery to repair his right 
elbow. Because of the procedure, Harvey was expected to miss the entire 
2014 season.[42] Harvey finished this past season 9–5 with a 2.27 ERA in 
26 starts with 191 strikeouts in 178 1/3 innings. It was later announced 
that Harvey had finished 4th in the Cy Young Award, losing to Los Angeles 
Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw.[43] On October 22, 2013, Harvey underwent 
successful Tommy John surgery to replace the partially torn ulnar collateral 
ligament in his right elbow. Dr. James Andrews performed the operation 
in Gulf Breeze, Florida.[44] Exactly 4 months after his Tommy John surgery 
Harvey was throwing a baseball for the first time since his injury occurred. 
He threw 20 times at a distance of 60 feet at the Mets spring training 
site Port St. Lucie, Florida, with the Mets goal being that he would be 
ready for the start of the 2015 season.[45] In March, Harvey dismissed 
the idea that he would not pitch until the start of the 2015 season by 
posting on Twitter that "2014 Harvey Day will happen".[46] He also told 
reporters around the same time that he was looking to return around September 
2014.[47] But in June of that same year the Mets officially declared that 
Harvey would not be pitching until the beginning of the 2015 season. Harvey 
had been rehabbing at such an accelerated pace that they thought it would 
be better to take a more cautious approach. After talking with Mets doctors, 
general manager Sandy Alderson decided that slowing Harvey's path would 
be best. Another factor was that the Mets at the time were out of playoff 
contention, and him pitching in meaningless games was not worth the risk 
of being injured again.[48] In 2014, Harvey was elected the team's MLB 
Players Association representative.[49] Without Harvey for the 2014 season, 
the Mets finished with a record of 79–83 (second in the NL East) with the 
pitching staff having an ERA of 3.49, good for 6th in the National League. 
On April 9, Harvey returned from surgery, and allowed no runs in six innings 
while striking out nine against the Washington Nationals. After the game, 
Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper said: "He's going to be a Cy Young one 
day and everybody knows that. He's one of the toughest at-bats I've ever 
had."[50] On May 4, Hall of Fame pitcher and former Mets ace Pedro Martínez 
said that he believed that Harvey could have a better career than his own. 
He added, "I think he has more talent than I do."[51] On May 18, Harvey 
pitched 8 innings, giving up no runs against the St. Louis Cardinals while 
striking out 9.[52] On May 23, Harvey had the worst start of his career, 
surrendering 7 runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates in four innings. Due to this 
poor outing, Harvey's ERA jumped from 1.98 to 2.91.[53] On July 11, Harvey 
hit his first career home run against the Arizona Diamondbacks' Patrick 
Corbin. Harvey also pitched 7 innings, striking out 9, and got his 8th 
win on the season.[54] In September, Harvey's agent, Scott Boras, publicly 
expressed concern with the Mets' stated plans to allow Harvey to pitch 
around 190 innings in the regular season, and also pitch "a reasonable 
amount" in the postseason. Boras suggested that better medical advice, 
allegedly given by Dr. James Andrews, was to cap the innings at 180, and 
no postseason activity.[55][56] Harvey initially appeared to agree with 
Boras,[55] in contrast with his cultivated image of toughness and desire 
to compete and win at all costs, including having previously objected to 
efforts by the Mets to both proceed cautiously in his recovery with respect 
to the timetable for his return (in 2014 Harvey expressed a desire to come 
back from the injury early, while the Mets followed a conventional recovery 
timetable[57]), and curtail his innings in 2015 by employing a six-man 
rotation.[58][59][60] After backlash against Harvey's initial comments 
from Mets fans and the media,[55] Harvey wrote in The Players' Tribune 
that the innings limit only applied to the regular season and that he would 
pitch in the playoffs.[61] On October 12, 2015, Harvey pitched against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 of the NLDS. Though he struggled a bit 
he was still able to get the win, he gave up 3 runs (2 earned), 7 hits 
& 2 walks, he also struck out 7 in the Mets' 13-7 win. Harvey pitched well 
in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Chicago 
Cubs. He started Game 1 of the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City 
Royals, giving up 3 earned runs through 6 innings in a no-decision. Kansas 
City won the game, 5-4 in 14 innings, to take the series lead. In Game 
5 of the World Series against the Royals, Harvey appeared to be on his 
way to one of the greatest pitching performances in MLB Postseason history. 
Harvey entered the mound with a 2-0 lead in the top of the ninth inning 
per his own request, to try and finish the game despite having thrown over 
100 pitches. After allowing a leadoff walk, followed by an RBI double, 
Harvey was pulled. The game-tying run eventually scored later in the inning 
on a throwing error, resulting in a no-decision for Harvey in a game the 
Mets would eventually go on to lose in 12 innings. This loss made Kansas 
City the 2015 World Series Champions. After making the Mets' opening day 
roster, Harvey began the 2016 regular season on a sour note, losing his 
first two starts before gaining traction. During his first start on Opening 
Day against the reigning World Series champions, the Kansas City Royals 
he allowed 4 runs (3 earned) and did not seem his typical self, earning 
a few amount of strikeouts and surrendering a large amount of hits. After 
observing Harvey pitch, it seemed that his typical velocity and command 
had disappeared while striking out few batters. Throughout the beginning 
of the season, Harvey seemed to be improving minimally and inconsistently. 
However, Harvey had a few quality starts, including one where he went 7 
complete innings while striking out 7 against the Chicago White Sox, and 
one against the San Diego Padres where Harvey struck out a season high 
10 and surrendered only 2 runs through out 6 innings. However Harvey was 
not pitching as successfully as he was his previous season. Mets pitching 
coach Dan Warthen said early in the season that Harvey had been struggling 
with a mechanical problem with his slider during his first two starts. 
Throughout the 2016 season it was believed Harvey was struggling mechanically, 
but it turned out he, after beginning the year 4–10, was placed on the 
15-day disabled list with shoulder pain. Harvey later opted to have season-ending 
surgery to resolve a condition called thoracic outlet syndrome. Matt Harvey 
commented on his season-ending surgery, "I'm disappointed in the way I 
pitched, and hope this cures me and we get back on track." Harvey is a 
power pitcher with a 6-foot-4-inch (1.93 m), 225-pound (102 kg) frame that 
is suitable for heavy workloads and can generate great arm speed. He has 
a four-pitch repertoire that includes a fastball, slider, curveball and 
change-up. He throws his fastball in both four-seam and two-seam varieties, 
where it is consistently in the range of 93–96 miles per hour (150–154 km/h) 
(tops out at 98 miles per hour (158 km/h)) with movement; it is considered 
a plus pitch.[63] Harvey usually relies on his slider, which comes in at 
88–92 miles per hour (142–148 km/h) and at times is a plus pitch. It gets 
good rotation and tilts when thrown well, but will occasionally flatten 
out. In high school, Harvey's curveball was an overhand power curve that 
had plus potential, but he doesn't throw it frequently in the majors because 
he favors the slider. Harvey's fourth option is the change-up, which he 
commands well in the range of 86–88 miles per hour (138–142 km/h). His 
change-up is considered an average pitch. Harvey is a passionate New York 
Rangers fan and frequently attends their games at Madison Square Garden, 
sometimes with teammate Jon Niese. He has been described as perhaps their 
most prominent and identifiable fan.[64] However, his experience as a hockey 
player is limited to casual roller hockey and ice hockey at a cousin's 
backyard rink in Vermont.[65] He is also a fan of the New England Patriots.[7] 
Harvey has a high profile in the media.[66] He is known to live a flashy 
lifestyle, drives an expensive Maserati sports car,[5][67] has been described 
as a "lothario" due to his record of dating fashion models, and is frequently 
mentioned in celebrity gossip columns in New York media.[66][68][69] In 
May 2013, Matt Harvey began dating model Anne Vyalitsyna after meeting 
her at a New York Rangers game.[70] They broke up in February 2014.[71] 
In 2015, he began dating Polish model Ania Cywinska.[68] He also appeared 
nude in The Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine in 2013.[10] Harvey appeared 
on the cover of the May 20, 2013 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine, 
dubbed "The Dark Knight of Gotham,"[34] a play on Batman's home city, its 
association with New York City and the recent Dark Knight film trilogy. 
Harvey, who had been a Batman fan since childhood,[72] as well as teammates, 
fans, the Mets and other media sources immediately embraced the comparison.[69][73][74][75] 
Harvey even had "Dark Knight" carved into the knobs of his bats to begin 
the 2015 season before replacing it with a personalized hybrid Harvey-Batman 
logo, versions of which had previously appeared on his locker and on T-shirts.[76][77][78] 
Early in the 2013 season, fans, media and teammates also began referring 
to any day on which Harvey is scheduled to start as "Harvey Day."[79][80]
