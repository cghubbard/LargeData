Edward Emil "Ed" Kranepool (born November 8, 1944) is an American former 
professional baseball player. He spent his entire Major League Baseball 
career as a first baseman for the New York Mets. Born in the Bronx, New 
York, Kranepool attended James Monroe High School, where he began playing 
baseball and basketball. Mets' scout Bubber Jonnard signed Kranepool in 
1962 at the age of 17 as an amateur free agent. After batting a combined 
.301 at three levels of the Mets' minor league system in 1962, Kranepool 
received a September call-up in just his first professional season. At 
age 17, Kranepool was six years younger than the next-youngest '62 Met, 
a reflection of the disastrous decision of Met management to select mostly 
older veterans in the expansion draft. He made his major league debut wearing 
number 21 on September 22, 1962 as a late inning defensive replacement 
for Gil Hodges at first base in a 9-2 loss to the Chicago Cubs at the Polo 
Grounds. He grounded out to Cubs second baseman Ken Hubbs in his only at 
bat.[1] He made his first start the next day, September 23, playing first 
base, and went one for four with a double.[2] Kranepool began the 1963 
season splitting playing time with "Marvelous" Marv Throneberry at first 
base and Duke Snider in right field. By May 5, Throneberry's ineptitude 
at the plate (.143 batting average and only one run batted in during the 
first 23 games of the season) wore thin on Met fans and management, and 
he was demoted to the Mets' Triple A affiliate, the Buffalo Bisons. Tim 
Harkness was awarded the first base job, with Snider shifting to left field 
and Kranepool becoming the Mets' everyday right fielder. This arrangement, 
however, did not last, as Kranepool was sent down to the minors in July 
with a .190 batting average. He resurfaced later that season as a September 
call-up, and went four for five with a run batted in and a run scored in 
his first game back.[3] He continued to hit better following his late season 
call-up, and managed to bring his batting average up to .209 for the season. 
With Harkness, Dick Smith and Frank Thomas sharing first base, Kranepool 
received most of his playing time in right field at the start of the 1964 
season. On May 24, Joe Christopher was batting .303 and had won a starting 
job in right field. He was awarded the right field job, and Kranepool was 
demoted to Buffalo with a .139 batting average. Kranepool played just 15 
games with the Bisons, hitting three home runs and batting .352 to earn 
a promotion back to the Mets. On his last day with the Bisons, Kranepool 
played all 18 innings of a double header, before getting the call to come 
to Shea Stadium where the Mets were playing two games the next day.[4] 
On Sunday, May 31, he played first base in game one of the double header 
against the San Francisco Giants. Kranepool also played first in the second 
game of the double header, which went 23 innings. Kranepool ended up playing 
all 23 innings, going four for 14 over the two games. In all, he played 
50 innings in two days. "I wish we could have played another 40 minutes", 
Kranepool was later quoted as saying of the record setting double header 
that lasted nearly 10 hours and ended at 11:20 PM. "That way, I could always 
say I played in a game that started in May and ended in June."[5] These 
two games were the start of a 13-game hitting streak that saw Kranepool's 
batting average rise to .264. For the season, Kranepool batted .257 with 
10 home runs and 45 RBI. Prior to the start of the 1965 season, the Mets 
acquired future Hall of fame pitcher Warren Spahn from the Milwaukee Braves. 
Kranepool gave up his number 21 to Spahn, who had worn that number his 
entire career, and began wearing number 7. By midseason, Kranepool was 
batting .287 with seven home runs and 37 RBIs. He was named the Mets sole 
representative on the National League All-Star team at the 1965 Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game, though he did not play. By the end of the season, 
Kranepool's batting average had fallen to .253, but that was still enough 
to lead the Mets, as the team lost 112 games that season and finished in 
tenth and last place in the National League. He also led his team with 
133 hits and 24 doubles. In 1966, Kranepool paced the Mets with a career 
high sixteen home runs to help the Mets avoid a last place finish and 100 
losses for the first time in franchise history (95). On May 21, 1969, the 
Mets won their third game in a row for a .500 winning percentage 36 games 
into the season for the first time in franchise history. This was followed 
by a five-game losing streak that saw the Mets fall into fourth place in 
the newly aligned National League East. The Mets then went on an eleven-game 
winning streak that included a two home run performance by Kranepool against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers.[6] By the end of the streak, the Mets were in 
second place, seven games back of the Chicago Cubs. On July 8, Kranepool 
hit a fifth-inning home run off Ferguson Jenkins to give the Mets a 1-0 
lead over the Cubs. By the time the Mets batted in the ninth inning, however, 
the first place Cubs had taken a 3-1 lead. The Mets scored three runs in 
the ninth to win the game, with Cleon Jones scoring the last run on Kranepool's 
single to center.[7] The Mets completed their remarkable "Miracle" 1969 
season, in which the team, backed by Kranepool, Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman, 
won their first ever World Series title against the Baltimore Orioles. 
Kranepool hit a home run in game three of the series, a 5-0 win for the 
Mets.[8] On June 23, 1970, Kranepool was batting just .118, and was demoted 
to the Mets' triple A affiliate, the Tidewater Tides. He considered retirement, 
but instead, he accepted his reassignment, and batted .310 in 47 games 
at Tidewater. He was back with the Mets by the middle of August, but saw 
very little playing time. For the season, Kranepool had only 52 plate appearances 
in 43 games. Kranepool bounced back with perhaps his best season in 1971, 
batting .280 with 14 home runs, 58 RBI and an on-base plus slugging+[9] 
of 123. He also led the National League with a .998 fielding percentage. 
The late-career demotion marked a turning point for Kranepool, with him 
becoming a useful hitter and first baseman/outfielder despite never entering 
a season with a specific full-time role. In 1973, Kranepool lost his starting 
job at first base to John Milner. Kranepool still managed to play 100 games 
and make 320 plate appearances backing up Milner at first and Cleon Jones 
in left. The Mets won the NL East, and faced the Cincinnati Reds in the 
1973 National League Championship Series. Kranepool's only appearance in 
the NLCS was in game five, and he drove in the first two runs of the Mets' 
series clinching victory to lead his team to the 1973 World Series.[10] 
Kranepool batted .300 in consecutive seasons in 1974 and 1975, sharing 
first base duties with Milner and Dave Kingman. When Mets owner Joan Payson 
died on October 4, 1975, she left the team to her husband Charles. While 
Joan had been the driving force behind the Mets, her survivors did not 
share her enthusiasm. Charles delegated his authority to his three daughters, 
who left control of baseball matters to club chairman M. Donald Grant. 
According to an interview with Kranepool, he was the only Met player invited 
to Mrs. Payson's Funeral[11] The Mets enjoyed the second best winning percentage 
in franchise history in 1976 when they went 86-76 to finish third in the 
NL East. Kranepool was again a regular first baseman with the Mets that 
season, batting .292 with 10 home runs and 49 RBIs. He compiled his best 
offensive years from 1974 through 1977, hitting .299 in 431 games with 
28 home runs and 156 runs batted in. Popular centerfielder Lee Mazzilli 
became the face of the organization. Kranepool, perhaps as a symbol of 
the Mets' past glory, emerged as a fan favorite as well, despite his relegation 
to a limited pinch hitting role at that point in his career. From 1974 
through 1978, Kranepool hit .396 as a pinch hitter, batting .486 (17-for-35) 
in the role in 1974, still the major league single-season pinch hit batting 
average record.[12] After the Mets traded Jerry Koosman at the end of the 
1978 season, Kranepool became the last of the 1969 Miracle Mets. When he 
retired after the 1979 season at the age of 34, he was the all-time Met 
leader in eight offensive categories (since surpassed). As of 2016, he 
has still played more games (1853) as a Met than any other player. He became 
a legend among Met fans for playing eighteen seasons, all with the Mets. 
No other Met player has played for the team for that long. He was the last 
of the 1962 Mets to remain with the team, and the last of that team to 
retire from Major League Baseball. Though still relatively young at that 
time, he was only useful as long as his pinch-hits kept dropping in. He 
had also reportedly had some friction with the team's ownership group, 
led by Lorinda DeRoulet, that was controlling the team after Payson's death. 
When the team was sold after the 1979 season to a group headed by Nelson 
Doubleday Jr. and Fred Wilpon, Kranepool was part of one of the groups 
offering a losing bid.[13] Kranepool had career fielding percentages of 
.994 as a first baseman and .975 as an outfielder. A 1978 television commercial 
for Gillette Foamy shaving cream began with black-and-white film footage 
of Kranepool striking out, and an announcer saying, "From 1962 to 1970, 
Ed Kranepool batted .227. Then Ed switched to Gillette Foamy." The ad showed 
Kranepool in front of a mirror, lathering up and shaving, and switched 
to color footage of him hitting a ball down the right-field line. The announcer 
said, "Since 1971, Ed's batted .283! What do you think of that, Ed?" As 
baseball players had long had a reputation for being superstitious, the 
ad closed with Kranepool standing in the dugout, in uniform but lathered 
up and holding up a can of Foamy, saying, "I don't know, but now I shave 
every other inning." The closing narration was, "Foamy: More than thick 
and rich enough for New York's heavy hitters." Another Gillette commercial 
featured Kranepool lighting a candle in his bathroom and trying to shave 
using Foamy during a blackout. The ad was clearly inspired by the New York 
blackout of the previous season, which came during a Met home game at Shea 
Stadium on July 13, 1977. Kranepool also appeared in an ad for SportsPhone 
with Jerry Koosman. He caught flak for a 1986 campaign commercial he did 
for New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato in which he appeared wearing a New 
York Mets uniform. Following protest from the Mets' ownership group, the 
commercial was quickly pulled. Kranepool also appeared on Saturday Night 
Live in a cameo appearance, being interviewed by Bill Murray during a skit 
filmed during spring training in 1979, regarding Chico Escuela's (portrayed 
by Garrett Morris) tell all book, Bad Stuff 'bout The Mets (a parody of 
Sparky Lyle's tell all book about the New York Yankees, The Bronx Zoo). 
He appeared as himself in a 1999 episode of Everybody Loves Raymond along 
with several other members of the 1969 Mets.[14] Ed Kranepool made a living 
after retirement as a stockbroker and restaurateur, and was inducted into 
the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1990. He is currently living in New York. 
He ranks second on the all-time Mets hit list with 1418. He was surpassed 
by active Met third basemen David Wright. Kranepool is associated with 
an amusing Supreme Court story. Justice Potter Stewart was a baseball fan 
who, while he was listening to oral arguments, asked one of his clerks 
to provide him with play by play accounts of the 1973 playoff game between 
the Mets and the Cincinnati Reds. It was a time of political turbulence; 
one of the notes read "Kranepool flies to right. Agnew resigns."[15] He's 
only seventeen and he runs like he's thirty. "We've got a couple of kids 
here named (Ed) Kranepool and (Greg) Goossen, and they're both 20 years 
old. In 10 years Kranepool has a chance to be a star. In 10 years Goossen 
has a chance to be 30." (Casey Stengel, allegedly saying this to reporters
