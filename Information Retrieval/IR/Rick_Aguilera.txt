Richard Warren Aguilera (born December 31, 1961) is a former Major League 
Baseball (MLB) pitcher. During a 16-year baseball career, he pitched from 
1985 to 2000 for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Boston Red Sox, and 
Chicago Cubs. Aguilera attended Edgewood High School in West Covina, California, 
and played third base for their baseball team. Following graduation, he 
was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 37th round of the 1980 amateur 
draft on June 3, but did not sign and instead chose to attend Brigham Young 
University (BYU). After three years at BYU, in which he had made the transition 
from third base to pitcher, the Mets drafted him in the third round of 
the 1983 amateur draft on June 6.[1] Although he did not sign with the 
Mets organization until September, he was able to get into 16 games (going 
5–6 with a 3.72 ERA in 104 innings) for the Little Falls Mets in the low 
A-ball New York–Penn League. The following season he was promoted to the 
Lynchburg Mets in the high-A Carolina League where he was 8–3 with a 2.34 
ERA and 101 strikeouts in 88 1/3 innings before being promoted to the Jackson 
Mets in the AA Texas League. In 1985, Aguilera was promoted to the AAA 
Tidewater Tides and was 6–4 with a 2.51 ERA in 11 starts before being promoted 
to the majors.[2] Aguilera saw his first MLB action on June 12, pitching 
two innings of scoreless relief and getting the win against the Philadelphia 
Phillies in a game started by Ron Darling.[3] In the middle of a fierce 
divisional race with the Cardinals, Aguilera was particularly effective 
in July, going 3–0 with a 0.89 ERA, and ended the season 10–7 as the Cardinals 
edged out the Mets. However, Aguilera's fine rookie season was completely 
overshadowed by 20-year-old rotation-mate Dwight Gooden, who followed up 
his Rookie of the Year win in 1984 by going 24–4 with a 1.53 ERA to win 
the Cy Young Award and the pitching triple crown.[4] Aguilera posted an 
identical record the next year in 1986 as the number five starter for the 
division-winning Mets. That season, he was involved in a fight with Houston 
police outside a disco which resulted in the arrest of not only himself, 
but also teammates Bob Ojeda, Tim Teufel, and Darling, later referred to 
as 'Cooters-gate'.[5] In the 1986 postseason, Aguilera pitched five scoreless 
innings in relief against the Houston Astros in the NLCS. Despite a horrid 
12.00 ERA in the World Series, he was the pitcher of record in the Mets' 
dramatic Game 6 comeback victory, getting the win despite giving up the 
two runs which surrendered the lead to Boston in the top of the 10th inning. 
Injuries slowed him the next two years, as he was limited to 17 starts 
in 1987 and 3 starts in 1988 by an elbow injury that required surgery.[6] 
With injury concerns and seven innings of one-run relief in the 1988 NLCS, 
the Mets decided to experiment with Aguilera as a reliever. After returning 
to the team in 1989, he was converted to a long reliever. Although he was 
unhappy in a low-leverage bullpen role and asked to be traded,[7] Aguilera 
thrived in the role, going 6–6 with a 2.34 ERA, 80 strikeouts and 7 saves 
in 36 appearances. When Dwight Gooden was placed on the disabled list in 
early July 1989, the Mets begin actively looking for a veteran starting 
pitcher via trade rather than promote from within into the open rotation 
slot with young pitchers such as Aguilera, Kevin Tapani, and David West 
rumored as trade bait.[8] After the Mets lost their seventh game in a row 
ahead of the trade deadline, Aguilera was included in a last-minute deadline 
deal,[9] along with West, Tapani, reliever Tim Drummond and a player to 
be named (which on October 16 became reliever Jack Savage), for Minnesota 
Twins ace Frank Viola. Although he got his wish and completed the season 
with the Twins as a starter,[7] going 3–5 with a 3.72 ERA and 3 complete 
games in 75 2/3 innings, he was shifted to the closer's role in 1990 and 
responded by saving 32 games for a team that went 74–88. The next year, 
his relief pitching was instrumental in the Twins' surprising division 
title, as he saved 42 games with a 2.35 ERA, a team record that would stand 
until Eddie Guardado broke it in 2002 with 45 saves. He went on to save 
three of four victories in the ALCS and the first two games of the World 
Series against the Atlanta Braves. In Game 3, he became the first pitcher 
to pinch hit in a World Series game since Don Drysdale in 1965, flying 
out in the top of the 12th with the bases loaded and two outs before giving 
up the game-winning hit in the bottom of the inning. He would also win 
Game 6 of the series. Aguilera became one of baseball's premier closers 
with the Twins from 1990–1995 and was named to three consecutive All-Star 
teams from 1991–1993. With the Twins well on their way to finishing 44 
games behind the AL Central division winning Cleveland Indians in 1995, 
Aguilera was traded to the Red Sox on July 6 in exchange for minor league 
outfielder J. J. Johnson and pitcher Frank Rodriguez. The move was made 
official while the Red Sox were in Minneapolis playing the Twins and after 
walking 20 ft down to the visitors dressing room, Aguilera was called on 
to convert a save opportunity in his very first appearance – striking out 
former teammate Kirby Puckett to help nail down a 5–4 win.[10] Although 
Aguilera would later state that the trade that brought him to Boston was 
the lowest point of his career,[11] he would perform well for the AL East 
champion, going 2–2 with 20 saves and a 2.67 ERA in 30 relief appearances. 
Like a number of his teammates, Aguilera struggled in the playoffs, giving 
up one run on three hits with one strike out in two-thirds of an inning. 
A free agent following the 1995 season, Aguilera opted to return to the 
Twins. Minnesota skipper Tom Kelly installed Aguilera as a starting pitcher—a 
position he hadn't been in since starting 11 games for the team in 1989—rather 
than his familiar closer role. Despite early season shoulder and wrist 
injuries (with the latter reportedly caused by lifting his wife's suitcase 
the last week of spring training) forcing Aguilera to miss six weeks early 
in the season,[12][13] the veteran battled his way to an 8–6 record with 
a 5.42 ERA in 19 starts, including a pair of complete games. With Aguilera 
now working as a starting pitcher, Dave Stevens led the pitching staff 
with 11 saves. Stevens was one of seven Twins pitchers to record a save 
in 1996. The following season, the experiment of Aguilera as a starting 
pitcher had ended midway through spring training and the veteran returned 
to the bullpen. At age 35, he went 5–4 with 26 saves and a 3.82 ERA in 
61 outings. In 1998, he recorded 38 saves (the most since saving 41 games 
in 1992) in 68 games for the Twins. In 1999, Aguilera had gone 3–1 with 
6 saves and a 1.27 ERA in 17 games before the Twins traded the 37-year-old 
and pitcher Scott Downs to the Chicago Cubs for Kyle Lohse and Jason Ryan. 
Aguilera pitched well for the Cubs in 1999, posting a 6–3 record with 8 
saves and a 3.69 ERA in 44 games as a middle reliever, set-up man, and 
occasionally a closer. At age 38, he entered the 2000 season, his 16th 
season in the big leagues, as the team's closer. Aguilera went 1–2 with 
29 saves in 54 appearances, but blew eight of his save opportunities and 
finished with a 4.91 ERA for the last-place Cubs. After spending the off-season 
weighing the possibility of coming back for a 17th season, Aguilera officially 
retired on February 17, 2001.[14] At the time of his retirement, his 318 
saves trailed only Lee Smith, John Franco, Dennis Eckersley, Jeff Reardon, 
Randy Myers, Rollie Fingers, and John Wetteland in career saves. As of 
December 2015, he stands 19th on the career saves list.[15] Aguilera was 
on top of the Twins / Senators franchise list for career saves with 254 
until Joe Nathan surpassed him on August 10, 2011.[11][16] In addition, 
Aguilera's save totals in 1991 (42 saves), 1992 (41), and 1998 (38) are 
5th, 7th, and 10th on the franchise's top 10 season saves list (as of the 
end of the 2015 season).[16] Aguilera is married to wife Sherry (m. 1988) 
and the couple have two children, daughter Rachel (born 1991) and son Austin 
(born 1996).[11] A devout Christian, Aguilera now lives in the San Diego 
suburb of Rancho Santa Fe, California and dedicates his time to his family 
and real estate investments. He has also served as the pitching coach for 
the Santa Fe Christian High School baseball team from 2001 to 2005 and 
as the head coach from 2005 to 2007.[17] On June 21, 2008, Rick Aguilera 
was inducted into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame. Italics denotes active
