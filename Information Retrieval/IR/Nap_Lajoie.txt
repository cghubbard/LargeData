As player As manager Napoléon "Nap" Lajoie (/ˈlæʒəweɪ/; September 5, 1874 
– February 7, 1959), also known as Larry Lajoie and nicknamed "The Frenchman", 
was an American professional baseball second baseman and player-manager. 
He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Philadelphia Athletics (twice), and Cleveland Naps between 1896 and 1916. 
He managed the Naps from 1905 through 1909. Lajoie was signed to the National 
Leagues's (NL) Phillies in 1896. By the beginning of the twentieth century, 
however, the upstart American League (AL) was looking to rival the supremacy 
of the NL and in 1901, Lajoie and dozens of former National League players 
joined the American League. National League clubs contested the legality 
of contracts signed by players who jumped to the other league but eventually, 
Lajoie was allowed to play for Connie Mack's Athletics. During the season, 
Lajoie set the all-time American League single-season mark for the highest 
batting average (.426).[1][2][3]:p.76[4]:p.88 One year later, Lajoie went 
to the Cleveland Bronchos where he would play until the 1915 season when 
he returned to play for Mack and the Athletics. While with Cleveland, Lajoie's 
popularity led to locals electing to change the club's team name from Bronchos 
to Napoleons ("Naps" for short), which remained until after Lajoie departed 
Cleveland and the name was changed to Indians (the team's present-day name). 
Lajoie led the AL in batting average five times in his career and four 
times recorded the highest number of hits. During several of those years 
with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded 
batting titles with each other, most notably coming in 1910, when the league's 
batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the 
season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson. 
Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league 
players to record 3,000 career hits. He led the NL or AL in putouts five 
times in his career and assists three times. He has been called "the best 
second baseman in the history of baseball" and "the most outstanding player 
to wear a Cleveland uniform."[5]:p.207[6] Cy Young said, "Lajoie was one 
of the most rugged players I ever faced. He'd take your leg off with a 
line drive, turn the third baseman around like a swinging door and powder 
the hand of the left fielder."[4]:p.86 He was elected to the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1937. Lajoie was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, to Jean 
Baptiste and Celina Guertin Lajoie. The elder Lajoie was French-Canadian 
and had emigrated to the United States. Upon arrival to the U.S. he first 
settled in Rutland, Vermont, but then moved to Woonsocket, where Lajoie, 
the youngest of eight surviving children, was born.[7] Throughout his childhood 
Lajoie received little formal education.[8] The elder Lajoie, who worked 
as a teamster and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, 
which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family.[9]:p.39 
Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing 
semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias 
"Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. 
He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was 
called "Slugging Cabby."[4]:p.88[9]:p.40 "When I told my father I had decided 
to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums 
and that nobody respected them, but I was determined to give it a try at 
least one season", Lajoie later said.[10] He also received the nickname 
"Larry" from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie.[10] Lajoie 
admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.[11]:p.179 
When word of Lajoie's baseball ability spread, he began to play for other 
semi-professional teams at $2 to $5 per game ($57 to $142 in current dollar 
terms). Meanwhile, Lajoie worked as a teamster.[7] He left Woonsocket and 
his $7.50 ($214 in current dollar terms) working as a taxi driver and joined 
the Class B New England League's Fall River Indians in 1896 played as a 
center fielder, first baseman and catcher where he earned $25 weekly ($712 
in current dollar terms).[9]:p.40[12]:p.19 He recorded 163 hits in 80 games, 
and led the team in batting average, doubles, triples, home runs and hits.[13] 
Lajoie was "widely regarded as an outstanding prospect" and Indians owner 
Charlie Marston rejected an offer from the Pittsburgh Pirates for Lajoie 
in exchange for $500 ($14,246 in current dollar terms). He was also scouted 
by the Philadelphia Phillies and Boston Beaneaters.[12]:p.19 The Philadelphia 
Phillies of the MLB's National League (NL) purchased Lajoie and teammate 
Phil Geier from Fall River for $1,500 ($42,738 in current dollar terms) 
on August 9. Phillies' manager Billy Nash originally went to Fall River 
intending to sign Geier only but obtained Lajoie when the team agreed to 
include him in their asking price.[14][15]:p.55 Author David Jordan wrote: 
Against the Washington Senators on August 12, 1896, Lajoie made his major 
league debut. He played first base and recorded a single.[12]:p.19 Ed Delahanty 
was being considered to play the first base position after Dan Brouthers 
retired. Delahanty, however, wanted Lajoie to play first so he could return 
to his natural position of left field. Delahanty said to Lajoie, "Look, 
sonny, you tell the boss you’re a first baseman and you and me are gonna 
get along."[10] Lajoie became the team's first baseman and by the end of 
the season, he and Delahanty were roommates. Later in 1898, new manager 
George Stallings moved Lajoie to second base, commenting that "[Lajoie 
would] have made good no matter where I positioned him."[7] Lajoie hit 
.363 and led the NL in slugging percentage in 1897 and doubles and RBIs 
in 1898.[12]:p.20[16][17] He had a .378 batting average in 1899, though 
he played only 77 games due to an injury.[1] In 1900, he missed five weeks 
due to a broken thumb suffered in a fistfight with teammate Elmer Flick.[7][18] 
John Rogers, described as a "penny-pinching" majority owner of the Phillies, 
assured Lajoie that he would make the same salary as Delahanty.[19] However, 
Lajoie discovered that while he was earning $2,600 ($74,079 in current 
dollar terms), Delahanty earned $3,000 ($85,476 in current dollar terms) 
(contracts for NL players were not allowed to surpass $2,400).[4]:p.88[20]:p.16 
Rogers increased Lajoie's pay by $200 but the damage had already been done. 
"Because I felt I had been cheated, I was determined to listen to any reasonable 
American League offer", Lajoie said.[21]:p.96 In 1901, the newly created 
American League had attracted several of the top players in the competing 
National League to join its ranks. Rogers declined Lajoie's request for 
an increase in salary and as a result, Lajoie jumped to the crosstown Philadelphia 
Athletics, owned by former Phillies' part-owner Benjamin Shibe and managed 
by Connie Mack.[7] Frank Hough offered Lajoie the contract on behalf of 
Mack. "Hough offered me $24,000 ($683,808 in current dollar terms) for 
four years. You can bet I signed in a hurry", Lajoie said.[21]:p.97 Lajoie 
was considered "the first superstar" to join the newly formed AL. He was 
also the first player whose yearly salary was for $4,000 ($113,968 in current 
dollar terms).[4]:p.88[11]:p.180[22]:p.42 "The Phillies opened their season 
and drew 6,000 fans. A week later, when we opened, there were 16,000 in 
the stands. The American League was here to stay", Lajoie later said.[10] 
Lajoie's batting average that year was .426 (it was originally recorded 
at .405, later changed to .422 before finally revised again to .426).[2][3]:p.76[4]:p.88 
The batting average mark became the all-time AL record after the number 
was revised. Previously, Ty Cobb and George Sisler had been credited with 
having the AL's all-time mark.[23] That same year in a game against the 
Chicago White Sox' Clark Griffith, Lajoie became the second Major Leaguer 
to be intentionally walked with the bases loaded in an 11–7 game after 
Abner Dalrymple in 1881.[11]:p.179 For the 1901 season, Lajoie led the 
majors in doubles (48), and led the majors in hits (232), batting average 
(.426), runs (145), on-base (.463) and slugging percentage (.643), and 
total bases (350). His 125 RBIs led the AL and his 14 home runs were a 
career-best and his 48 doubles are a Philadelphia Athletics' record.[1][24]:p.341 
Mack said of Lajoie, "He plays so naturally and so easily it looks like 
lack of effort."[7] Author Robert Kelly writes: "The .422 batting average 
of Lajoie still stands as an AL record. To some degree, however, it is 
tainted. The 1901 season was the first for the AL and the level of competition 
was presumably evolving. Such questions, however, in no way cast doubt 
on the extraordinary batting ability of the second baseman."[25] In April 
1902, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overruled an earlier decision by 
the Court of Common Pleas and upheld the reserve clause in contracts between 
players and NL clubs. President of the Chicago National League Club Jim 
Hart said the state Supreme Court's decision had dealt "a fatal blow to 
the rival league" and NL clubs "have won a great victory."[26] The Phillies' 
Rogers obtained an injunction barring Lajoie from playing baseball for 
any team other than his team.[27] However, a lawyer discovered the injunction 
was only enforceable in the state of Pennsylvania. The courts ruled the 
reserve clause was not valid for players who signed with an AL team.[28] 
Mack responded by trading Lajoie and Bill Bernhard to the then-moribund 
Cleveland Bronchos, whose owner, Charles Somers, had provided considerable 
financial assistance to the A's in the early years.[29][30][31]:p.36 Lajoie 
was also pursued by Charles Comiskey, owner of the Chicago White Sox.[32] 
Lajoie, nicknamed "The Frenchman" and considered baseball's most famous 
player at the time, arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and his play was immediately 
met with approval from fans.[9]:p.41[15]:p.55[24]:p.17 The Bronchos drew 
10,000 fans to League Park in Lajoie's first game.[5]:p.12[10] The Bronchos' 
record at the time Lajoie and fellow Athletics teammate, Bill Bernhard, 
joined was 11–24 and improved to 12–24 after the team's inaugural game 
with their new players, a 4–3 win over the Boston Americans.[5]:p.13[33] 
The team went on to finish 69–67, fifth in the AL, for the franchise's 
first winning record since the AL began as a league.[34][35] After his 
first season with the Bronchos, Lajoie's .378 average led all AL players.[36] 
New York Giants manager, John McGraw, was rumored to want to sign Lajoie 
but Lajoie stated his intentions when he said "...for I intend to stick 
to Cleveland."[37] For the remainder of 1902 and most of 1903, Lajoie and 
Flick traveled separately from the rest of the team, needing to avoid entering 
Pennsylvania so as to avoid a subpoena (the only team they could legally 
play with inside state limits was the Phillies). When the Naps went to 
play in Philadelphia, Lajoie and Bernhard would go to nearby Atlantic City 
to help pass the time.[31]:p.36 The issue was finally resolved when the 
leagues made peace through the National Agreement in September 1903 (which 
also brought the formation of the World Series).[5]:p.13[9]:p.40 To begin 
the 1903 season, the club changed its name from the Bronchos to the Naps 
in honor of Lajoie after a readers' poll result was released by the Cleveland 
Press.[5]:p.13 (The team was officially the Blues in their inaugural AL 
season but changed to the Bronchos for the 1902 season.)[35] The Bronchos 
finished the season 77–63 and Lajoie finished his first full season with 
the club again the AL's batting champion with a .344 average.[35] He also 
led the league in slugging percentage (.518), finished second in doubles 
(41), third in RBIs (93) and tied for fifth in home runs (7).[38] In the 
off-season he contracted pleurisy.[10] During the 1904, Lajoie received 
a suspension after he spat tobacco juice in an umpire's eye.[9]:p.41 He 
later informally replaced Bill Armour as the team's manager (Armour submitted 
his resignation on September 9 but as team captain, Lajoie had already 
been acting as the Naps' field manager). After the season had concluded, 
Lajoie was officially named manager.[5]:p.14 He still managed to lead the 
majors with a .376 batting average as he recorded his second consecutive 
league batting title.[1] He also led the majors in hits (208), doubles 
(49), RBIs (102) and slugging percentage (.546).[1] Lajoie forbade card 
playing and gambling from his players during the regular season.[22]:p.107 
As a manager, Lajoie was also described as "much too lenient with his players."[21]:p.98 
Lajoie contracted sepsis from an untreated spike injury after a game in 
July 1905.[31]:p.63 Dye from Lajoie's stockings entered his bloodstream 
and led to blood poisoning.[39]:p.48 (A rule was put into place requiring 
white socks to be worn underneath a player's colored socks.)[40]:p.339 
The injury worsened and Lajoie eventually came to games in a wheelchair. 
Amputation of the affected leg was also discussed.[20]:p.32 The injury 
and illness kept Lajoie out until August 28 when he began play again and 
returned as the team's first baseman. Before the season was over he also 
sustained an injury to his ankle from a foul tip during an at bat and missed 
the remainder of the season (he continued to manage from the bench).[5]:p.14 
He finished the season having only appeared in 65 games (a career-low, 
other than his rookie season when he was not called up until well after 
the season had begun).[1] The Naps finished with a 76–78 record.[35] Baseball 
historian Bill James wrote of Lajoie's higher-than-normal career putout 
total and importance to Cleveland: Lajoie led the majors in 1906 in hits 
(214) and doubles (48) and the Naps finished third in the AL again with 
a winning record, 89–64.[1][42] Lajoie finished second in the AL to George 
Stone in batting average, slugging and on-base percentage.[43] In 1906 
he married Myrtle Smith and the couple moved to a small farm outside Cleveland.[9]:p.41 
In June of the 1907 season, Lajoie's .296 average, "an average even now 
that scores of players would be glad to accept,"[44] put him at risk for 
hitting below .300 for the first time in his career. He also missed 15 
games due to a recurrence of sepsis which he contracted during the 1905 
season.[5]:p.15 Lajoie and Naps first baseman George Stovall got into an 
argument in a hotel lobby and Stovall broke a chair over Lajoie's head. 
"George didn't mean anything by it", Lajoie said, and the two maintained 
a working relationship.[15]:p.57[21]:p.98 He finished the season with an 
average of .299.[1] Naps owner Charles Somers received a trade offer from 
the Detroit Tigers for the Naps' Elmer Flick and Tigers' Ty Cobb. Tigers 
manager Hughie Jennings called Somers and told him he was offering the 
trade because Cobb was not getting along with several teammates. Somers 
decided to retain Flick, saying, "We'll keep Flick. Maybe he isn't as good 
a batter as Cobb, but he's much nicer to have on the team."[5]:p.16 The 
Naps finished the regular season in second place to the Tigers with a 90–64 
record, a half-game behind the Tigers (who finished 90–63 and were not 
forced to make-up a rained out game in accordance with league rules).[5]:p.16 
Lajoie was partly blamed for the Naps' second-place finish. Author Fred 
McMane described an instance during the season between Naps catcher Nig 
Clarke and Lajoie. Lajoie finished the season tied for third-most in hits 
(168) while Cobb's batting average, slugging and on-base percentages, and 
hit total led the American League.[45] Baseball historians have suggested 
the managerial duties Lajoie took on affected his offensive numbers.[22]:p.42 
Lajoie's dissatisfaction with the Naps' play worsened. "You can't win in 
the major leagues unless you have players who know the game. We don't have 
time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job is to win pennants, 
not run schools", he said.[39]:p.65 Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, 
wrote "Lajoie, in spite of his marvelous fielding and tremendous batting, 
was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager."[39]:p.52 Lajoie 
recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, 
although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded 
to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie 
came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly 
to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the 
added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as 
he felt it negatively affected his play.[10] The highest-paid player in 
the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($263,815 in current dollar terms) 
reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon "Jim" McGuire to 
manager.[5]:p.17 The team finished 71–82 while Lajoie's .324 average was 
third in the AL and 33 doubles second.[46] The Naps finished 1910 71–81 
but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors 
with a .384 average[a] and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 
1901 campaign.[47][48] His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases 
led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the 
majors in the latter category.[1] Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back 
seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games.[1][49] Stovall, 
the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and 
the Naps finished 80–73.[5]:p.19 Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks 
of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session 
in Chicago.[50] He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 
90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham 
as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 
75–78.[1][5]:p.19 Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 
RBIs.[5]:p.20 He finished fourth in the AL with a .368 batting average.[51] 
In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one 
incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after 
being benched during a batting slump.[5]:p.20 Lajoie hit .335 on the year, 
the last time he would hit over .300 in his career.[1] Only two other major 
league players had attained 3,000 career hits until Lajoie hit a double 
on September 27, 1914, and so joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner in the 
3,000 hit club.[3]:p.77[14] Lajoie recorded the hit off Yankees pitcher 
Marty McHale in a 5–3 Naps win.[5]:p.22[52] His .258 batting average for 
the season, however, was the lowest since he had joined the majors in 1896.[1] 
The Naps finished in last place in the American League standings with a 
51–102 record, their worst record since joining the league and the franchise's 
lowest winning percentage (.333).[53] Lajoie requested that Somers trade 
him and the club obliged, selling Lajoie to the Athletics for the waiver 
price and in so doing, Lajoie returned to Philadelphia.[5]:p.22[39]:p.74 
The following season, 1915, Lajoie returned to the Athletics when Mack 
signed him to a contract.[14] In his first season back with the Athletics, 
he finished with a .280 batting average but the team ended the season in 
last place with a 43–109 record.[1][54] The 1916 season would be Lajoie's 
last in the majors. In his final major league game, he hit a triple to 
help Athletics pitcher Joe Bush win his no-hitter.[21]:p.100 Lajoie, aged 
41 years, played in 113 games and finished with a .246 average.[1] Philadelphia's 
season record was worse than the previous season's franchise-low record, 
and finished in last place again with a 36–117 record.[55] The Athletics' 
winning percentage (.235) is the franchise's worst winning percentage (through 
2012 season).[56][57]:p.105 In 1917, Lajoie joined the Toronto Maple Leafs 
of the International League as manager. At the age of 42, Lajoie won the 
league's batting title with batting average of .380. He appeared in 151 
of 156 games and for the first time in his career, played on a team that 
won a pennant.[21]:p.100 He later was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers for 
$3,000 ($47,277 in current dollar terms) in March 1918 but the contract 
was annulled by the Commissioner's office and made a free agent to which 
Lajoie was "well pleased".[58][59] Later that same year he joined the Indianapolis 
Indians of the American Association as player-manager. He helped lead the 
team to a third-place finish but the season was impacted due to the U.S.'s 
involvement in World War I. Lajoie made his services available to the draft 
board but they rejected his offer.[9]:p.43 On December 27, 1918, Lajoie 
announced his retirement from baseball.[21]:p.101[60] Several years after 
his retirement, a story in The Milwaukee Sentinel talked of Lajoie's ability 
to "outguess any pitcher." Lajoie faced pitcher Red Donahue, who avoided 
pitching fastballs to Lajoie after seeing him go 4-for-4 against a fellow 
pitching mate. Donahue instead made pitches on the outside corner, to which 
Lajoie reached over "and hit them with ease."[61] Donahue then proceeded 
to aim a pitch at Lajoie's head and he proceeded to hit a home run. "That's 
the kind I eat", he said.[61] For the first part of the 20th century, Lajoie 
and Cobb's statistics rivaled each other like few other players in the 
American League.[57]:p.10 In 1908, Honus Wagner and Lajoie recorded their 
2,000th career hit. Baseball historian David Anderson wrote: The Lajoie-Cobb 
rivalry reached a peak in 1910, when Hugh Chalmers of the Chalmers Auto 
Company (a direct predecessor to modern-day Chrysler) promised a Chalmers 
30 Roadster to the season's batting champion.[62] The public became fascinated 
with the daily statistics of Lajoie and Cobb in what became known as the 
Chalmers Race. Sports bettors, who by this time followed the sport attentively, 
also followed the daily reports with interest. Cobb took the final two 
games, a doubleheader, off against the Chicago White Sox, confident that 
his average was safe and would allow him to win the AL batting title—unless 
Lajoie had a near-perfect final day. Going into the final game of the season, 
Cobb's average led Lajoie's, .383 to .376. Lajoie and the Naps faced a 
doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns in Sportsman's Park, Cleveland's 
final two games of the season. After a sun-hindered fly ball went for a 
stand-up triple and another batted ball landed for a cleanly hit single, 
Lajoie had five subsequent hits – bunt singles dropped in front of rookie 
third baseman Red Corriden (whose normal position was shortstop), who was 
playing closer to shallow left field on orders, it has been suggested, 
of manager Jack O'Connor.[63] In his second at bat of the second game, 
Lajoie reached base on another bunt but the runner on first base advanced. 
According to the rules of that time, the hit was scored a sacrifice and 
thus, Lajoie did not record an official at bat. He finished the doubleheader 
a perfect 8-for-8 and his batting average increased to .384, .001 greater 
than Cobb's mark. Although the AL office had not officially announced the 
results, Lajoie began to receive congratulations from fans and players, 
including eight of Cobb's Detroit Tigers teammates. Most players in the 
league preferred Lajoie's personality to that of Cobb's.[31]:p.124 Coach 
Harry Howell is reported to have said to the game's official scorer, E. 
V. Parish, "to do well by Lajoie."[62] Howell was reported to have offered 
a bribe to Parish, which described in Al Stump's biography of Cobb, was 
a $40 ($982 in current dollar terms) suit. Parish refused the offer and 
the resulting uproar ended in O'Connor and Howell being banned from the 
major leagues by AL President Ban Johnson. Johnson had the matter investigated, 
and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader statistics re-checked, 
discovered only the first game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but 
not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested 
actual batting average at .385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson 
ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which 
would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was 
greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 
at bats.[62] Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile 
to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but 
eventually relented and accepted it.[63] Cobb said, "I am glad that I won 
an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have 
no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly 
pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely."[31]:p.125 Lajoie 
said, "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President 
Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting 
me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have 
the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success."[31]:p.125 
The Sporting News published an article written by Paul MacFarlane in its 
April 18, 1981, issue where historian Pete Palmer had discovered that while 
Cobb's September 24 doubleheader was not correctly tabulated (perhaps purposefully) 
according to the correct date, the second game's statistics were in fact 
included in the next day's ledger, thus incorrectly recording a second 
2-for-3 performance from Cobb which meant Lajoie's average was greater.[62][64][65] 
Author James Vail wrote in 2001: Lajoie ended his career with a lifetime 
.338 batting average. His career total of 3,242 hits was the second-most 
in MLB history at the time of his retirement, behind only Honus Wagner's 
total (3,420). Lajoie's 2,521 hits in the American League was that league's 
record until Cobb surpassed his mark.[67] He was among the second group 
of players elected to the Hall of Fame in 1937 and was later inducted on 
June 12, 1939, when the Hall opened that same year.[68] Lajoie obtained 
the greatest number of votes as he led induction mates Tris Speaker (165 
votes) and Cy Young (153) with 168 votes (83.6 percent of ballots) from 
the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[69][70] Lajoie led all second 
basemen in the NL in putouts (1898) and the AL four times in his career 
(1901, 1903, 1906, and 1908). From 1906–1908 he led the AL in assists (amongst 
second basemen).[1] He also led the league in double plays six times in 
his career.[40]:p.339 Baseball historian William McNeil rates Lajoie as 
the game's greatest second baseman, when combining both offensive and defensive 
impact.[71] Bill James argues, "In the last 20 years several statistical

is incorrect. He was a competent fielder, even a good fielder. He was not 
a defensive superstar."[41]:p.487 During spring training before the 1928 
season, Lajoie commented on the 1927 New York Yankees. "Of course, you 
could see a lot of loafing going on but if that club is the greatest of

world champions and didn't know it."[72] He died in Daytona Beach, Florida 
in 1959, at the age of 84 from complications associated with pneumonia.[73][74] 
He had fallen in the autumn of 1958 and fractured his arm.[2] His wife 
had died earlier in 1951.[10] In 1999, he ranked number 29 on The Sporting 
News' list of the "100 Greatest Baseball Players", and was a nominee for 
the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[75] Lajoie is mentioned in 
the poem "Line-Up for Yesterday" by Ogden Nash: L is for Lajoie Whom Clevelanders 
love, Napoleon himself, With glue in his glove. Italics denotes active
