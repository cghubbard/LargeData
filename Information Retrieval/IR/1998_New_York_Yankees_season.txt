The New York Yankees' 1998 season was the 96th season for the Yankees. 
The team finished with a franchise record regular-season standing of 114â€“48, 
22 games ahead of the second-place Boston Red Sox in the American League 
East. These Yankees set an American League record for wins in a season, 
a record that would stand until 2001, when the Seattle Mariners won 116 
games in the regular season against 46 losses (the Yankees still hold the 
record for most regular season wins by a team that won the World Series). 
New York was managed by Joe Torre. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium 
in which they celebrated the stadium's 75th Anniversary. In the postseason, 
they swept the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series, won 
the American League pennant by beating the Cleveland Indians four games 
to two in the American League Championship Series, and swept the San Diego 
Padres to capture their 24th World Series. Including the playoffs, the 
1998 Yankees won a total of 125 games against 50 losses, a MLB record. 
They are widely considered to be one of the greatest teams in baseball 
history. The 125 wins (regular season and playoffs combined) was the most 
by a championship team, surpassing the previous record of 116, set by their 
cross-town rivals, New York Mets in 1986.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
