Anthony John "A. J." Pierzynski (/pɪərˈzɪnski/; born December 30, 1976) 
is an American professional baseball catcher who is a free agent. He has 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Minnesota Twins (1998–2003), 
San Francisco Giants (2004), Chicago White Sox (2005–2012), Texas Rangers 
(2013), Boston Red Sox (2014), St. Louis Cardinals (2014) and Atlanta Braves 
(2015–2016). Pierzynski is known for having a strong and colorful personality, 
a fact he acknowledges. During his turn at the microphone following the 
White Sox victory parade in 2005, he thanked team personnel "for putting 
up with me." Former White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén summed up the situation 
as, "If you play against him, you hate him. If you play with him, you hate 
him a little less."[1] Guillén also acknowledged Pierzynski's value to 
the club, despite being relatively high-maintenance: "A.J.'s been great 
for me. He's worth the work because he always shows up for you."[2] Pierzynski 
was born on December 30, 1976, in Bridgehampton, New York.[3] He attended 
Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida, where he won All-State honors 
in baseball. Future Major Leaguer Johnny Damon was one of Pierzynski's 
high school teammates.[4] Pierzynski graduated from high school in 1994 
and signed a letter of intent to play baseball at the University of Tennessee.[3] 
He was also selected by the Minnesota Twins in the third round (71st overall) 
of that year's MLB Draft and chose to sign with the ballclub on June 9.[5] 
He began his minor league career with the Gulf Coast League Twins and spent 
the next four years playing for the minor-league Elizabethton Twins, Fort 
Wayne Wizards, Fort Myers Miracle, New Britain Rock Cats, and Salt Lake 
Buzz. After four years in the Twins organization, he was called up to the 
major league team, and made his debut on September 9, 1998, when he was 
21 years old. He then spent the next five seasons, through the 2003 season, 
with Minnesota, though he was not a regular starter until 2001. From 1998-2000, 
he appeared in just 49 games for the Twins. In 2002 he made the American 
League All-Star Team as a reserve catcher. In the 2002 American League 
Division Series, Pierzynski hit an important home run in the ninth inning 
of the final game, in which the Twins clinched the series. In 2003, Pierzynski 
reached a .312 batting average, a career high that still stands.[6] After 
the 2003 season, the Twins traded Pierzynski to the San Francisco Giants 
for Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, and Boof Bonser.[7] With the Giants 
he hit .272 with 11 home runs and 77 RBIs. He spent one season in San Francisco 
before being non-tendered. Pierzynski was signed as a free agent by the 
Chicago White Sox on January 6, 2005.[5] When he signed with the White 
Sox, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a story claiming that the catcher 
had kneed Giants trainer Stan Conte in the groin during a spring training 
game in 2004.[8] Although the incident allegedly happened during the game, 
it went unreported for nearly a year in the press. Pierzynski has disputed 
the allegations publicly. "Don't you think if something like that happened, 
in spring training, you would have heard about it? I would have gotten 
in some sort of trouble?"[9] He would later go on to contribute to the 
White Sox's historic run of winning their first World Series since the 
1917 contest. In 2006, Pierzynski was named one of the five American League 
players in the All-Star Final Vote. Soon afterwards the Chicago White Sox 
organization began an election campaign using the slogan "Punch A.J." Pierzynski 
received 3.6 million votes, the most votes in the American League, subsequently 
sending him to his second All-Star appearance.[10] The "Punch A.J." campaign 
was inspired by an incident on May 20, 2006 between Pierzynski and Chicago 
Cubs catcher Michael Barrett. After a fly ball out, Pierzynski tagged up 
at third base and tried to score on the throw. After a collision at home, 
where Pierzynski knocked Barrett from his feet, Pierzynski slapped home 
plate with his hand. After getting up, Barrett grabbed Pierzynski and punched 
him in the face. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, and Pierzynski, Barrett, 
White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry were 
ejected.[11] When play finally resumed, outfielder Scott Podsednik promptly 
got on base, loading the bases up, and second baseman Tadahito Iguchi cleared 
them with a grand-slam. The White Sox won the game, 7–0.[12] Michael Barrett 
was suspended for 10 games, while Brian Anderson was suspended for five 
and A.J. Pierzynski was fined.[13] Pierzynski caught Mark Buehrle's no-hitter 
on April 18, 2007,[14] but not his perfect game on July 23, 2009. He caught 
Philip Humber's perfect game on April 21, 2012 against the Seattle Mariners 
at Safeco Field, as well.[15] On May 28, 2007, in a game versus the Minnesota 
Twins, Pierzynski twice ran down the first base line with his feet on the 
inside of the base, possibly nipping Twins first baseman Justin Morneau 
with his spikes. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire was furious with the umpires, 
which resulted in a long tirade. However, he was not ejected. Pierzynski 
denied any attempt to step on Morneau.[16] Pierzynski holds the AL record 
for consecutive errorless chances with 962, breaking Yogi Berra's previous 
record of 950, set in 1959.[17] Pierzynski agreed to a two-year contract 
to remain with the White Sox after the 2010 season.[18][19] On June 13, 
2012, Pierzynski was rated the most hated MLB player.[20] In 2012, Pierzynski 
homered in five consecutive games, tying the franchise record and becoming 
the sixth player to achieve this feat. His teammate Paul Konerko was the 
most recent Sox player to achieve this feat in 2011.[21] Pierzynski won 
a Silver Slugger Award at catcher, his first. He hit .278/.326/.501 in 
135 games, all but 5 behind the plate, with 27 HR and 77 RBI. Following 
the 2012 season, Pierzynski agreed to a one-year contract for 2013 with 
the Texas Rangers worth $7.5 million.[22] He enjoyed a solid year for Texas, 
hitting .272 with 17 home runs and 70 RBIs in 503 at-bats.[23] On December 
3, 2013, Pierzynski agreed to a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox, 
pending the completion of a physical examination.[24] The deal became official 
the next day.[25] On June 4, 2014, Pierzynski was ejected by umpire Quinn 
Wolcott after a leadoff walk by pitcher Brandon Workman because he asked 
Wolcott to "give me a new ball. One you can see."[26] This was Pierzynski's 
ninth career ejection.[27] Pierzynski's offense regressed with Boston as 
he hit .254/.286/.348 in 256 at-bats.[23] On July 9, Pierzynski was designated 
for assignment and Christian Vazquez was promoted from AAA Pawtucket.[28] 
A sports column in a Boston newspaper cited disgruntled anonymous Red Sox 
teammates who disliked Pierzynski, blaming him for the team's overall woes.[29] 
On July 16, the Red Sox officially released Pierzynski.[30] The Red Sox 
continued a disastrous slide after Pierzynski departed and finished 2014 
with a record of 71–91. On July 26, 2014, the St. Louis Cardinals signed 
Pierzynski to a major league deal.[31] Later that day, he debuted for St. 
Louis with a 3-for-4 outing and an RBI, helping to defeat the Cubs 6–3.[32] 
Former Boston teammate John Lackey soon arrived via trade, and Pierzynski 
caught him for the 19th time in 22 starts in 2014 when he debuted for the 
Cardinals on August 3. It was the pitcher's 150th career win.[33] Pierzynski's 
first home run with St. Louis came in a loss to Baltimore on August 8.[34] 
He hit .244/.295/.305 in 82 at-bats, mostly serving as a backup catcher 
to Yadier Molina. The Cardinals left Pierzynski off the playoff roster 
for the NLDS against the Dodgers,[35] but added him for the NLCS against 
the Giants.[36] Pierzynski and the Atlanta Braves finalized a one-year 
deal worth $2 million on January 7, 2015.[37] The Braves had intended to 
use him as a backup catcher and mentor to Christian Bethancourt. However, 
Bethencourt struggled defensively and was eventually sent down to Gwinnett 
in the hope that he would improve, forcing Pierzynski into a starting role.[38] 
On July 18, 2015, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Pierzynski broke 
up Jon Lester's no-hit bid in the eighth inning of the Braves' 4–0 loss.[39] 
AJ caught Foltynewicz starts 2015 and 2016 On April 27, 2016, Pierzynski 
recorded his 2,000th career hit off Steven Wright of the Boston Red Sox, 
becoming the tenth catcher to reach the 2,000 hit mark.[40] He was placed 
on 15 day DL on August 17, 2016.[citation needed] Pierzynski was hired 
by Fox to be an analyst for the 2011 MLB postseason on the pre-game and 
postgame show.[41] He joined Fox again for the 2012, 2013, and 2015 postseasons. 
On December 8, 2005, Pierzynski appeared on TNA Impact!, a professional 
wrestling television program aired by the professional wrestling promotion 
Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Accompanied by White Sox strength trainer 
Dale Torborg, Pierzynski presented TNA wrestlers A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin 
and Sonjay Dutt with memorabilia from the 2005 World Series. At the ceremony, 
an incident was staged to include Pierzynski in a controversy with the 
wrestlers. Pierzynski then made his professional wrestling managerial debut 
at TNA Turning Point 2005 on December 11, 2005, accompanying Torborg, Sabin 
and Dutt to ringside for their match against the Diamonds in the Rough. 
On October 10, 2006, Pierzynski appeared on ESPN2's Cold Pizza, wearing 
the X-Division Championship belt,[clarification needed] and challenged 
WWE Champion John Cena, who was also a guest that morning, to a Title vs. 
Title steel cage match whenever Cena wanted to have it. Cena responded 
asking if Pierzynski got his championship belt out of a gumball machine 
outside. Pierzynski returned to TNA in January 2007, when he and Torborg 
confronted Lance Hoyt. At Against All Odds 2007 Pierzynszki was in Torborg's 
corner when he was defeated by Hoyt, who had David Eckstein in his corner.[42] 
On the September 7, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, Pierzynski made his first 
appearance on WWE television, replacing Chris Jericho in a game show called 
The Price is Raw while Bob Barker was hosting. Pierzynski is married to 
Lisa Pierzynski.[43] The couple have two children, Ava and Austin.[44]
