The Columbia Giants were a professional, black baseball team based in Chicago 
at the turn of the 20th century, prior to the Negro leagues. In 1899, a 
group known as the Columbia Club, organized the Columbia Giants under the 
direction of John W. Patterson. Many of the original players including 
Patterson came from the recently disbanded Page Fence Giants. Patterson 
also signed Chicago Unions pitcher Harry Buckner. In 1899, managed by Al 
Garrett, they beat the Chicago Unions for the western championship, winning 
game one 4-2 and game two 6-0. Stars included (Grant) Home Run Johnson 
at shortstop, Charlie Grant at secondbase, and (George) Chappie Johnson 
at firstbase and catcher. They lost a cross-country title match with the 
Cuban X-Giants by a 7-4 score. Home Run Johnson homered in two of the three 
major matches. At the beginning of the season, in May, the team included 
George Wilson, Sol White, Charlie Grant, Joseph "Cannon Ball" Miller, William

team that year. In 1901, Frank Leland combined his Chicago Unions with 
the Giants and renamed the team the Chicago Union Giants, which was renamed
