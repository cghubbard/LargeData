Alfonso Carrasquel Colón, better known as Chico Carrasquel (January 23, 
1928 – May 26, 2005), was a Venezuelan-born professional baseball player.[1] 
He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop for the Chicago 
White Sox (1950–1955), Cleveland Indians (1956–1958), Kansas City Athletics 
(1958) and the Baltimore Orioles (1959). Carrasquel was the first in a 
long line of Major League shortstops from Venezuela including, Luis Aparicio, 
Dave Concepción, Ozzie Guillén and Omar Vizquel among others. He was known 
for his excellent defensive abilities and for being the first Latin American 
in MLB history to start in an All-Star Game.[2] Born in Caracas, Carrasquel 
began his professional baseball career in 1946 at the age of 17 with the 
Cervecería Caracas team, where he hit the first home run in Venezuelan 
Professional Baseball League history.[3][4] He was signed in 1949 by the 
Brooklyn Dodgers, and was immediately promoted to the Double-A Fort Worth 
Cats.[5] Carrasquel provided good fielding and hit .315 during the season 
and .364 in the playoffs to help spur the Cats to the 1949 Texas League 
championship.[6] His inability to speak English fluently may have caused 
Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey to sell him to the Chicago White 
Sox although, Rickey later admitted that the move was a mistake.[6] White 
Sox' General Manager Frank Lane solved the language communication problem 
by trading Carrasquel's uncle Alex for reliever Witto Aloma, who served 
as the interpreter between Carrasquel and White Sox' manager Jack Onslow.[7] 
Carrasquel joined the White Sox in 1950, becoming the third Venezuelan 
to play in Major League Baseball after his uncle, Alex Carrasquel (Washington 
Senators, 1939) and Chucho Ramos (Cincinnati Reds, in 1944).[1] He became 
the White Sox's starting shortstop, replacing the forty-one-year-old Luke 
Appling, who had held the position since 1930. Carrasquel soon established 
himself as an excellent defensive player, combining with second baseman 
Nellie Fox to make one of the best double play combinations in the league.[2] 
His cheerful disposition and apparent love for playing baseball, made him 
extremely popular with Chicago fans.[8] As a rookie, Carrasquel hit for 
a career-high .282 batting average in 141 games and, amassed a 24-game 
hitting streak until Red Sox pitcher Ellis Kinder stopped the streak.[9] 
In September, he suffered a torn cartilage in his right knee and had to 
sit out the remainder of the season.[10] Carrasquel finished the season 
ranked third in voting for the American League Rookie of the Year Award, 
behind Walt Dropo and Whitey Ford, and finished 12th in the 1950 American 
League Most Valuable Player Award ballot.[11][12] In 1951, Carrasquel beat 
out the reigning American League Most Valuable Player, Phil Rizzuto, in 
voting for the shortstop of the American League in the 1951 All-Star Game.[13] 
He became the first Latin American player to be selected to start in an 
All-Star Game.[2] On July 19, 1951, Carrasquel broke Rizzuto's Major League 
record by handling 297 consecutive chances in 53 games without committing 
an error.[14] The record would stand for 18 years until 1969, when Don 
Kessinger of the Chicago Cubs set a new record by playing in 54 games without 
committing an error.[15] He ended the year leading the league's shortstops 
in assists and in fielding percentage.[16] In November 1951, it was reported 
that Boston Red Sox manager, Lou Boudreau, wanted to trade Ted Williams 
for Carrasquel but, Lane refused the offer.[17] Carrasquel had an off year 
in 1952 as, a broken finger and then weight problems saw his batting average 
drop to .248 in 100 games.[18] After the 1952 season, trade rumors reportedly 
had the Cleveland Indians offering the American League's runs batted in 
champion, Al Rosen, in exchange for Carrasquel but, the trade never transpired.[19] 
In 1953, Carrasquel was once again voted as the starting shortstop for 
the American League in the 1953 All-Star Game and ended the season first 
among the league's shortstops in fielding percentage.[20][21] During spring 
training in 1954, it was reported that White Sox manager Paul Richards 
was not pleased with Carrasquel's lack of effort on the field.[22] It was 
a charge that would continue to pursue Carrasquel for the remainder of 
his tenure with the White Sox. Carrasquel responded with his most productive 
season in 1954 when, he was voted to make his third start as the American 
League shortstop in the 1954 All-Star Game and, posted career-highs in 
home runs (12), RBI (62), hits (158), runs (106), extra-base hits (43), 
walks (85).[1] Batting as the White Sox leadoff hitter, he led the league 
in games played and in plate appearances while hitting for a .255 batting 
average.[1][23] Defensively, he led the league's shortstops in double plays 
and in fielding percentage.[24][25] In July 1955, new White Sox manager, 
Marty Marion, replaced Carrasquel in favor of shortstop Jim Brideweser, 
citing Carrasquel's lackadaisical efforts and indifferent attitude towards 
playing.[26] There was some speculation among major league managers that, 
playing in the Venezuelan Winter League during the off-season might be 
wearing him down.[27] Between spring training, the regular major league 
season, and then a season of winter baseball in Venezuela, Carrasquel was 
playing in approximately 300 games a year.[8] Despite this setback, Carrasquel 
was still selected to his fourth All-Star game, this time as a reserve 
behind Harvey Kuenn.[28] He still showed flashes of his former self as 
in a game against the Baltimore Orioles on August 23 when, he scored from 
first base on a bunt.[29] Nellie Fox hit a bunt down the third base line 
and, when Orioles third baseman, Gus Triandos, left his base to field the 
ball, Carrasquel rounded second base and continued to third, where he was 
called safe on a close play. When the Orioles argued with the umpire without 
calling a time out, Carrasquel dashed to home plate without drawing a throw. 
Although his dedication was being called into question by Marion and the 
sporting press, Carrasquel still finished among the league leaders in assists, 
putouts and in fielding percentage.[30] Carrasquel had been instrumental 
in helping the White Sox sign another young, Venezuelan shortstop named 
Luis Aparicio, who went on to become a perennial All-Star player and was 
eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame.[31] By 1955, Aparicio was deemed 
ready to play in the major leagues and, with Marion dissatisfied with Carrasquel's 
level of play, he was traded along with Jim Busby to the Cleveland Indians 
for Larry Doby in October of that year.[32][33] After two and a half seasons 
with the Indians, Carrasquel was traded to the Kansas City Athletics for 
Billy Hunter in June 1958.[34] He played half a season for the Athletics 
before they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles for Dick Williams in October 
1958.[32] On May 10, 1959, Carrasquel was hit above his left eye by a thrown 
baseball as he was running the base paths and had to be carried off the 
field.[35] During a physical examination in September, it was discovered 
that Carrasquel only had fifty percent of his vision in his left eye, perhaps 
stemming from the May incident.[36] He ended the year with a career-low 
.223 batting average and, in December, the Orioles released him. He became 
a free agent and signed a contract to play for the Chicago White Sox in 
January 1960 but, was released at the beginning of the season. Carrasquel 
then signed with the Montreal Royals of the International League in April 
1960 but, was released after hitting for a .206 average in 35 games.[5] 
In a ten-year major league career, Carrasquel played in 1,325 games, accumulating 
1,199 hits in 4,644 at bats for a .258 career batting average along with 
55 home runs, 474 runs batted in and a .333 on-base percentage.[1] He was 
a disciplined hitter, posting a solid 1.052 walk-to-strikeout ratio (491-to-467).[1] 
A four-time All-Star, Carrasquel led the American League three times in 
fielding percentage, once in assists and finished his career with a .969 
fielding percentage.[1] Carrasquel had 5 hits and scored 5 runs in a game 
against the Kansas City Athletics on April 23, 1955.[37] He also had two 
other games in which he had 5 hits.[38][39] Carrasquel had a career-high 
7 runs batted in during a game against the Athletics on April 26, 1956.[40] 
Carrasquel returned to his native Venezuela where continued to play in 
the Venezuelan Winter League until 1967 when, he retired as an active player 
at the age of 41.[3] He later became the manager of the Leones del Caracas, 
leading them to the 1982 Caribbean Series championship title.[8][41] Carrasquel 
also spent time as a scout for the Kansas City Royals and the New York 
Mets.[8] He later worked as a color commentator on the White Sox' Spanish 
language broadcasts from 1990 to 1996 and, as the team's Community Relations 
Representative until 2002.[8] In 2004, Carrasquel helped start a nonprofit 
foundation to help underprivileged children in Venezuela and the United 
States.[42] The Chico Carrasquel Foundation transports barrio youngsters 
to YMCA centers, museums, baseball games, and historical places throughout 
Venezuela.[42] In 1991, the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League honored 
Carrasquel by renaming the Puerto la Cruz baseball stadium as the Estadio 
Alfonso Chico Carrasquel. The VPBL also honors annually the best manager 
in the league with the Chico Carrasquel Award.[41][42] In 2003, Carrasquel 
was selected in the inaugural class of the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of 
Fame and Museum.[43] On the occasion of Ozzie Guillén's first home game 
as White Sox manager in the 2004 season, Carrasquel joined Guillén and 
fellow Venezuelans Luis Aparicio and Dave Concepción in throwing out the 
first ball at the home opener.[44] Carrasquel called it his proudest moment.[45] 
As the first Venezuelan to become a star player in Major League Baseball, 
Carrasquel became a national idol and was an influential figure in his 
native country.[42] His accomplishments as a player influenced the aspirations 
of future Latin players including Aparicio and, helped pave the way for 
their baseball careers.[4][46] Carrasquel's influence in Venezuela may 
have extended into the geopolitical arena as well. At a time during the 
cold war when communists threatened to destabilize the country, Walter 
Donnelly, the United States Ambassador to Venezuela, arranged for members 
of the Carrasquel family, Venezuelan sportswriters and ballplayers to come 
to Yankee Stadium for an International Day honoring Carrasquel in July 
1950.[2] Donnelly Donnelly told Collier's magazine that he honestly believed 
the event was a setback for communist propagandists in Venezuela. Under 
no circumstances could a similar trip have been made to Russia or any of 
the satellite countries. [2] Carrasquel's uncle, Alex Carrasquel, and his 
nephew Cris Colón, also played in Major League Baseball.[1] Carrasquel 
died of cardiac/respiratory arrest in Caracas, Venezuela on May 26, 2005
