Pima County /ˈpiːmə/ is a county in the south central region of the U.S. 
state of Arizona. As of the 2010 census, the population was 980,263,[1] 
making it the second-most populous county in Arizona. The county seat is 
Tucson,[2] where nearly all of the population is centered. The county is 
named after the Pima Native Americans who are indigenous to this area. 
Pima County comprises the Tucson, AZ Metropolitan Statistical Area. Pima 
County contains parts of the Tohono O'odham Nation, as well as all of the 
San Xavier Indian Reservation, the Pascua Yaqui Indian Reservation, Organ 
Pipe Cactus National Monument, Ironwood Forest National Monument and Saguaro 
National Park. The vast majority of the county population lies in and around 
the city of Tucson (2011 city population: 525,796), filling much of the 
eastern part of the county with urban development. Tucson, Arizona's second 
largest city, is a major commercial and academic center. Other urban areas 
include the Tucson suburbs of Oro Valley (population 41,335), Marana (population 
35,232), Sahuarita (population 25,458), and South Tucson (population 5,695), 
a large ring of unincorporated urban development, and the growing satellite 
town Green Valley. The rest of the county is sparsely populated; the largest 
towns are Sells, the capital of the Tohono O'odham Nation, and Ajo in the 
far western region of the county. Pima County, one of the four original 
counties in Arizona, was created by the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature 
with land acquired through the Gadsden Purchase from Mexico in 1853. The 
original county consisted of all of Arizona Territory east of longitude 113° 20' 
and south of the Gila River.[3] Soon thereafter, the counties of Cochise, 
Graham and Santa Cruz were carved from the original Pima County.[4] According

Desert Conservation Plan (SDCP) is Pima County’s plan for balancing the 
conservation and protection of our cultural and natural resource heritage 
with our efforts to maintain an economically vigorous and fiscally responsible 
community. Broadly defined, the SDCP considered the following elements: 
critical habitats and biological corridors, riparian areas, mountain parks, 
historical and cultural preservation, and ranch conservation. All five 
elements, along with fiscal analysis, were critical in forming a viable
