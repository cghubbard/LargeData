Chad Douglas Fox (born September 3, 1970 in Conroe, Texas) is a former 
Major League Baseball pitcher. Fox played for the Atlanta Braves, Milwaukee 
Brewers, Boston Red Sox, Florida Marlins, and the Chicago Cubs. He won 
the 2003 World Series championship as a member of the Marlins. He is also 
known for his injuries that have set him back in his career, undergoing 
Tommy John surgery twice, including having been injured in the 2004 and 
2005 seasons. He has reached 50 innings - the minimum standard for a rookie 
season - only twice in his career, and threw less than 11 innings in the 
majors nine times between 1999 and 2009. He now teaches players of all 
ages at Prime 9 Baseball Facilities in Spring, Tx Fox attended Tarleton 
State University. The Cincinnati Reds drafted Fox in the 23rd round of 
the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft. He was traded to the Atlanta Braves 
in 1996 with a player to be named later (Ray King) for Mike Kelly. Fox 
was traded to the Brewers for Gerald Williams in 1997. Fox's best season 
came in 2001, after not pitching in the majors at all the year before. 
Fox was voted the Brewers Most Valuable Pitcher.[1] Taking on a setup role, 
Fox threw a career-best 66 2‚ÅÑ3 innings, posting a 5-2 record and 1.89 ERA 
while striking out 80. This would be his last injury-free season in the 
majors. Fox would face rehab stints in 2002 with the Brewers and 2003 with 
the Red Sox, though he managed to stay healthy after signing with the Florida 
Marlins in August 2003, posting a 2.13 ERA in 21 appearances and adding 
nine more outings in the postseason to help them to a World Series title. 
He returned to the Marlins in 2004, but was ineffective in 12 April appearances 
before being shut down the rest of the season with ulnar neuritis. He was 
equally ineffective trying to return the following season with the Chicago 
Cubs, this time throwing just eight innings before reinjuring his throwing 
elbow on April 26, 2005. This injury would temporarily end his career.[2] 
On January 11, 2008, he signed a one-year minor league deal with the Chicago 
Cubs hoping to make a comeback.[2] After several rehab starts with the 
Cubs' A and AA affiliates, Fox was added to the 25-man major league roster 
on May 2.[3] After a three-year absence he made his major league comeback 
debut on May 2, 2008 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He went 1-2-3 in 
the bottom of the 10th inning but gave up a 2-run home run in the 11th 
inning to take the loss. He would go on to make appearances on May 5 and 
May 11, throwing two scoreless innings before returning to the disabled 
list on May 20 with ulnar neuritis. Fox opted to rest rather than undergo 
another surgery on his elbow, but was ultimately transferred to the 60-day 
disabled list on September 2, ending his season.[4] In the offseason, he 
was re-signed by the Cubs to a minor league contract for 2009. On May 9, 
2009; in the top of the 8th inning in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers, 
Fox threw a wild pitch and, coming up in obvious pain, was removed from
