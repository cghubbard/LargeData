The Senator John Heinz History Center, an affiliate of the Smithsonian 
Institution,[1] is the largest history museum in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 
United States. Named after U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III (1938–1991) from 
Pennsylvania, it is located in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. The Heinz 
History Center is a 275,000-square-foot (25,500 m2)[2] educational institution 
"that engages and inspires a diverse audience with links to the past, understanding 
in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history 
and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection." 
The History Center features the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum and 
the Library and Archives, and includes six floors of permanent and changing 
exhibitions that tell the story of Western Pennsylvania. Though it was 
originally established in 1879,[3] the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania 
opened its current location in the historic Strip District along the Allegheny 
River in 1996. It is named for H. John Heinz III, the late US Senator from 
Pennsylvania who died in a 1991 plane crash.[2] The century-old Chautauqua 
Lake Ice Company building was renovated and adapted for use as the museum. 
The interior was designed to show off the building's features, as well 
as create spaces for exhibits and support space. The museum building is 
an exhibit in its own right. The History Center also features the following 
permanent exhibitions: The museum's history began in 1879, with the formation 
of a club called Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. 
In 1884 it changed its name to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania 
(HSWP) and has been operating continuously since then. It is the Pittsburgh 
region's oldest cultural organization. HSWP began the tradition of interpreting 
public history in 1911, organizing the centennial of steamboat navigation 
in Pittsburgh. In 1955 it led the organization of the city's bicentennial 
celebration. In the early years, HSWP held meetings in homes and churches, 
but in 1893, it was granted a space for its archives at the new Carnegie 
Library of Pittsburgh in the Oakland neighborhood. By 1914, it had its 
own building nearby. It operated there until 1996, when its expanded quarters 
in the renovated historic warehouse were completed in Pittsburgh's Strip 
District. The Society celebrated the opening of the new museum by an Inaugural 
Gala there on April 26, 1996 for 900 guests. Located in the Smithsonian 
wing of the Senator John Heinz History Center, the Western Pennsylvania 
Sports Museum spans 20,000 square feet (1,900 m2) of exhibit space over 
two floors. The "museum within a museum" captures the Pittsburgh region's 
evolution and influence as a sports leader over more than a century, from 
amateur to pro and across the spectrum of sports. The Sports Museum captures 
tales of Pittsburgh sports through hundreds of artifacts, more than 70 
hands-on interactive exhibits, and 20 audio-visual programs. Select artifacts 
include Franco Harris' "Immaculate Reception" shoes; Mario Lemieux's hockey 
skates; Satchel Paige's baseball glove; the pitching rubber from the 1960 
World Series; Billy Conn's gloves and light heavyweight champion belt; 
Arnold Palmer's sweater and golf bag; Chip Ganassi's 2000 Indy 500-winning 
race car; the "Ultimate Steelers Fan's Car;" the Homestead women swimmers 
Olympic medals from the 1920s and 1930s; and hundreds of Pittsburgh Pirates 
baseball cards. The History Center's Detre Library & Archives is an extensive 
scholarly resource documenting 250 years of life in Western Pennsylvania. 
The collection includes books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, atlases, 
newspapers, films, recordings and other memorabilia. The History Center 
also operates Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a world-renowned archaeological 
site south of Pittsburgh near Washington County's Avella community. The 
Rockshelter is the oldest site of human habitation in North America, with 
evidence of man living there for nearly 16,000 years. The site was named 
a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Adjacent to the Rockshelter is the 
historic village. The History Center operates this as a living museum, 
with re-enactors recreating rural life in the 19th century. The History 
Center also operates the Fort Pitt Museum, a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot 
(1,100 m2) museum that tells the story of Western Pennsylvania’s pivotal 
role during the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, and as 
the birthplace of Pittsburgh. Coordinates: 40°26′48″N 79°59′32″W﻿ / ﻿40.4466°N
