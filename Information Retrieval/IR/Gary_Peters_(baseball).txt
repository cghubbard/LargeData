Gary Charles Peters (born April 21, 1937) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played on two 
major league teams for 14 seasons, from 1959 through 1972. He was one of 
the best-hitting pitchers of his era. The Chicago White Sox drafted Peters 
as an amateur free agent in 1956 after he graduated from Grove City College. 
After four brief call-ups, he got a pitching job on the White Sox in 1963, 
winning 19 games (19-8) and the American League Rookie of the Year Award. 
A left-handed pitcher, he led the American League in earned run average 
in 1963 and 1966, with the most wins in 1964, and led in fielding average 
as a pitcher in 1968. He stayed in the White Sox organization through the 
1969 season and was traded to the Boston Red Sox, where he spent the last 
three years of his playing career. Peters was named to the American League 
All-Star roster in 1964 and 1967, and finished in the top 10 in the Most 
Valuable Player voting in 1963, 1964, and 1967.[1] He had a .222 lifetime 
batting average and hit 19 home runs. He was frequently used as a pinch-hitter, 
once winning a game with a pinch-hit home run. On May 5, 1968, Peters hit 
a grand slam in Comiskey Park, helping the White Sox to a 5-1 victory over 
the New York Yankees. He was also used as a pinch-runner. On September 
30, 2000, the Chicago White Sox announced that Gary Peters and 26 other
