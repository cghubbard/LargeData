William Joseph "Moose" Skowron Jr. (December 18, 1930 â€“ April 27, 2012) 
was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman, primarily for 
the New York Yankees. Skowron was an All-Star for six of his fourteen seasons 
playing in the major leagues and helped win five World Series. He had been 
a community relations representative for the Chicago White Sox for several 
years when he died in 2012. Skowron was born in Chicago, and was of Polish 
descent. His father was a city garbage collector. One day his grandfather 
gave the seven-year-old Skowron a haircut that resembled a known Italian 
dictator's, which resulted in his friends jokingly calling him "Mussolini", 
and caused his family to shorten the nickname to "Moose."[1] The name stuck 
throughout his career. Skowron attended Weber High School in Chicago, then 
went to Purdue University in Indiana, where he was a member of Tau Kappa 
Epsilon fraternity. Though Skowron went to the school on a football scholarship, 
he found himself better suited to baseball, hitting .500 as a sophomore 
in 1950, a record in the Big Ten Conference that lasted ten years. Following 
his sophomore year at Purdue, Skowron was signed to play baseball for the 
Austin (MN) Packers in the Southern Minny League (Class AA-level town-team 
baseball). Skowron did so well in Austin that the Yankees made a contract 
offer.[2] He was signed by Yankees scout Lou Maguolo.[3] Skowron signed 
with the New York Yankees in September 1950 as an amateur free agent and 
played his first game for the Yankees on April 13, 1954. In the beginning, 
he was platooned at first base with Joe Collins,[4] but from 1958 on he 
became the Yankees' full-time first baseman. He played in seven American 
League (AL) All-Star games as a Yankee: 1957, 1958, twice in 1959, twice 
in 1960, and 1961[5] (two All-Star Games were played in 1959 through 1962). 
On November 26, 1962, he was traded by the Yankees to the Los Angeles Dodgers 
for Stan Williams. Although Skowron floundered against National League 
pitching, batting just .203 in 237 at bats with four home runs, he stunned 
his former team in the 1963 World Series, as he led the Dodgers with a 
.385 average and a home run, as Los Angeles swept New York in four straight 
games. On December 6, 1963, he returned to the AL when he was purchased 
from the Dodgers by the then Washington Senators. On July 13, 1964, he 
was traded by the Senators to the Chicago White Sox. In 1965, he played 
in his eighth All-Star Game. On May 6, 1967, he was traded by the White 
Sox to the California Angels. He was released by the Angels on October 
9, 1967.[citation needed] He played in a total of 1478 major-league games, 
all but 15 as a first baseman. (He was in 13 games as a third baseman and 
two as a second baseman.) Skowron made the last out of the 1957 World Series, 
but the following year he knocked in the winning run in game six of the 
1958 World Series. Skowron also hit a three-run home run in game seven 
to propel the Yankees to a World Series win, and a comeback from a 3-1 
series deficit. He also scored the only run in game seven of the 1962 World 
Series against the San Francisco Giants. During his time with the Yankees, 
he resided in Hillsdale, New Jersey.[6] In 1963, he appeared as himself 
in the Mister Ed episode "Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed". Skowron was once 
a playful target of his friend, Yankee pitcher Fritz Peterson. A known 
practical joker, Peterson was reportedly popular with this teammates, entertaining 
them with his elaborate jokes.[7] He once used fake Baseball Hall of Fame 
letterhead to ask Moose Skowron to donate his pacemaker after he died Skowron 
met and married Virginia Hulquist while he was playing for Austin.[8] He 
was inducted into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame on June 12, 
1980 while living in Schaumburg, Illinois. In 1999, he became a community 
relations representative for the Chicago White Sox and was still holding 
this position when he died in 2012.[9] Skowron died at age 81 on April 
27, 2012, in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He died of congestive heart failure
