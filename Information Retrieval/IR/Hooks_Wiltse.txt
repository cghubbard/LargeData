George Leroy "Hooks" Wiltse (September 7, 1879 – January 21, 1959) was 
a professional baseball pitcher. He played twelve seasons in Major League 
Baseball from 1904 to 1915. He was the brother of pitcher Snake Wiltse. 
"Hooks" earned his nickname because of his exceptional curveball and was 
one of the earliest pitchers to have a curveball that was regarded as more 
effective than his fastball. From 1904 to 1914, he pitched for the National 
League's New York Giants. During that time, he combined with teammate Christy 
Mathewson for 435 wins, making them one of the best lefty-righty duos in 
history. Wiltse won five pennants with the Giants and pitched 3.1 innings 
in the 1911 World Series. On July 4, 1908, Wiltse pitched a perfect game 
through 26 batters until he hit Philadelphia Phillies pitcher George McQuillan 
on a 2–2 count in a scoreless game. This was the only occurrence of a pitcher 
losing a perfect game with two outs in the ninth inning by hitting a batter 
until Washington Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer did so on June 20, 2015. 
Like Wiltse, Scherzer eventually completed a no-hitter, but unlike Wiltse, 
Scherzer had a 6-0 lead and was able to retire the next batter to end the 
game. Umpire Cy Rigler later admitted that he should have called the previous 
pitch strike three, which would have ended the inning. Wiltse pitched on, 
winning 1–0 in ten innings, with the hit-batsman the only lapse separating 
him from a perfect game. Wiltse's ten-inning complete game no-hitter still 
remains a Major League record. In 1915, he jumped to the Brooklyn Tip-Tops 
of the Federal League, which is where he ended his major league career. 
He continued to play minor league baseball on and off until 1926. His last 
appearance came with the Reading Keystones, where he played in five games
