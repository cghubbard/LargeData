The Irish National Baseball Team has been in existence since 1996 and has 
taken part in several major baseball tournaments and tours. As in many 
other sports in Ireland, the team represents both the Republic of Ireland 
and Northern Ireland. These have included: Ireland finished fourth in the 
2002 tournament, won a bronze in the 2004 tournament and managed a silver 
medal in the 2006 tournament, losing to tournament favourites Croatia.
