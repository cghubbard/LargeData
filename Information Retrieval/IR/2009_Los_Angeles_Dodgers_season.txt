The 2009 Los Angeles Dodgers season saw the team defend their National 
League West title while earning the best record in the National League, 
and marked the 50th anniversary of their 1959 World Series Championship. 
The Dodgers reached the National League Championship Series for the second 
straight season only to once more fall short in five games against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. 2009 saw the Dodgers open their brand new spring 
training facility, Camelback Ranch-Glendale. The 13,000 seat stadium and 
surrounding facilities that the Dodgers share with the Chicago White Sox 
replaced their former facility at Holman Stadium in Vero Beach, Florida, 
where the team had trained in the spring since 1948. This also marked the 
Dodgers debut as a member of the Cactus League. Infielders Outfielders

The Dodgers selected 51 players in this draft. Of those, seven of them 
have played Major League Baseball as of the 2014 season. They lost their 
first round pick as a result of signing free agent Orlando Hudson but gained 
a supplemental first round pick and a second round pick as a compensation 
for losing pitcher Derek Lowe. The Dodgers top pick in this draft was left-handed 
pitcher Aaron Miller from Baylor University. In five seasons in the minors 
he was 20-19 with a 4.03 ERA in 82 games (65 starts). Mid-way through the 
2013 season, the Dodgers decided to take him off the mound and turn him 
into a position player.[50] He hit 14 homers and drove in 60 RBI in 2014 
in class-A as a designated hitter but retired after the season without 
making it to the Majors.[51] They went the opposite direction with outfielder 
Blake Smith from University of California, Berkeley. Also in the 2013 season
