The 1998 Florida Marlins season started off with the team trying to repeat 
as World Series Champions, having won the title in 1997. Their manager 
was Jim Leyland. They played home games at Pro Player Stadium. They finished 
with a record of 54â€“108, dead last in the NL East. The team is notable 
for having arguably the biggest fire sale in sports history, auctioning 
off nearly all of their most notable players. The 1998 Marlins were the 
first defending World Series champions to finish last in their division.
