Thomas Joseph Lovett (December 7, 1863 â€“ March 19, 1928) was an American 
professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of six seasons in 
Major League Baseball between 1885 and 1894. After playing for the Waterbury 
team in the Connecticut State League in 1884, Lovett made his major league 
debut on June 4, 1885 for the Philadelphia Athletics. After pitching only 
16 games, he did not pitch in the majors again until being signed by the 
Brooklyn Bridegrooms in 1889, when he helped the team to the American Association 
pennant. Brooklyn jumped to the National League in 1890, and that year, 
Lovett was arguably the best player on the club. He went 30-11 with a 2.78 
ERA. In the World Series, he pitched four complete games and won two of 
them, as Brooklyn played the Louisville Colonels to a draw. On June 22, 
1891, Lovett pitched a no-hitter against the New York Giants, a 4-0 victory. 
As quickly as Lovett rose to prominence, he fell. He sat out the 1892 season, 
and when he returned, he was largely ineffective. He played in the minor 
leagues until 1896, after which he retired. Lovett died at the age of 64 
in his hometown of Providence, Rhode Island and is interred at St. Ann
