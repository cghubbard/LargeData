The Philadelphia Phillies' 2014 season was the 132nd in the history of 
the franchise. After a disappointing 2013, the Phillies entered the offseason 
with a strategy to reload rather than rebuild; they did not want to relinquish 
the opportunity to do well in 2014 in hopes of being competitive down the 
road. Commensurate with this strategy, among their key acquisitions were 
right fielder Marlon Byrd and starting pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Phillies 
began the season with new coaches (as Ryne Sandberg entered his first season 
as manager after taking over on an interim basis in August 2013) and new 
broadcasters; Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs, two members of the 2008 World 
Series squad, replaced Chris Wheeler and Gary Matthews as analysts on Comcast 
SportsNet Philadelphia. After offseason headlines indicated a tenuous relationship 
between Sandberg and shortstop Jimmy Rollins and controversy about draft 
picks who did not sign with the team, the season began auspiciously with 
an opening-day win; however, the Phillies then lost their next two games. 
April continued in that fashion; the team played .500 ball in their first 
26 games, exceeding expectations. One commentator called them "pleasantly 
mediocre", despite a horrific performance from the bullpen.[1] May was 
a frustrating month for the Phillies; failing to win games they were in 
a position to win, they posted an 11–16 record and a .230 team batting 
average (the worst in the National League). June was almost as bad; although 
the team had 12 wins and 17 losses, the bullpen improved to one of the 
best in the NL. In the 2014 Major League Baseball draft that month the 
Phillies selected Aaron Nola as their first-round pick, encouraging optimism 
from fans and the media. Although the Phillies began July at the bottom 
of the National League East Division, they amassed a five-game winning 
streak shortly before the All-Star break. This moved them to within nine 
games of .500, but they lost the last two games and had a 42–53 record 
at the break. As the trade deadline approached, it was speculated that 
the Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They 
made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August 
they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong 
pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with 
four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from 
there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins 
and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes on the field and in the front 
office were expected during the offseason. The Phillies entered the offseason 
with a strategy of "reloading, not rebuilding".[2] According to Matt Gelb 
of The Philadelphia Inquirer, "Bold best describes what Rubén Amaro Jr. 
has done so far in putting together the 2014 Phillies and it sure is appropriate 
that the word ends with the letters O-L-D."[3] The team wanted to re-sign 
Carlos Ruiz (or find another catcher) and sign a right-handed-hitting corner 
outfielder and a middle-of-the-rotation starter to supplement Cole Hamels 
and Cliff Lee after the departure of Roy Halladay and the discovery of 
medical problems in Cuban Miguel Alfredo González, signed by the Phillies 
the previous summer.[4] The Phillies' first offseason acquisition was Shawn 
Camp, a right-handed middle reliever coming off an "awful" season with 
the Chicago Cubs who was signed on November 11, 2013 to a minor-league 
contract with an invitation to spring training.[16] The next day, they 
signed the right-handed-hitting corner outfielder for whom they were looking: 
Marlon Byrd, a member of the team from his debut in 2002 to 2005, signed 
a two-year contract for $16 million.[17] Soon after the agreement was announced, 
Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. was criticized by analyst Keith 
Law for overpaying Byrd; according to Law, Byrd's 2013 season was a "fluke" 
and an "outlier".[18] Near the end of that week, the Phillies signed two 
players to minor-league contracts with invitations to spring training: 
outfielder Clete Thomas, who led Minnesota Twins outfielders in games played 
in their 2013 season (with a .214 batting average),[19] and Cesar Jimenez, 
a left-handed specialist who pitched 17 innings with the Phillies in 2013.[7] 
The following week the team signed infielder Reid Brignac, a well-regarded 
prospect for the Tampa Bay Rays who had struggled in the major leagues, 
to a minor-league contract with a spring-training invitation.[20] Shortly 
afterwards the Phillies addressed their catching needs, re-signing Carlos 
Ruiz to a three-year contract (with an option for a fourth year) worth 
$26 million.[21] Similar to the Byrd deal, Amaro was criticized for signing 
a 35-year-old catcher to a three-year contract. Cliff Corcoran wrote for 
Sports Illustrated, "While Ruiz may have been an underrated player in the 
past, heading into his age-35 season, he doesn’t have far to fall before 
he's little more than a replacement-level catcher."[22] The Phillies made 
no more acquisitions until December; on December 2 they signed Jeff Manship, 
a right-handed pitcher who was mediocre as a starter and reliever (since 
2011, he had an 0–5 record and a 7.44 earned run average), to a minor-league 
contract with a spring-training invitation.[23] The next day they made 
their only trade of the offseason, sending 2013 backup catcher Erik Kratz 
and minor-league relief pitcher Rob Rasmussen to the Toronto Blue Jays 
in exchange for Brad Lincoln, a veteran right-handed relief pitcher who 
the Phillies hoped would improve their bullpen's depth and leadership.[24] 
Uncertain if minor-league catching prospects Cameron Rupp, Tommy Joseph 
and Sebastian Valle were ready for the major leagues, the Phillies signed 
"strong defensive catcher" Wil Nieves to a one-year contract for $1.125 million 
as a backup.[23][25] On December 12 they selected Kevin Munson, a right-handed 
pitcher from the Arizona Diamondbacks organization, in the Rule 5 draft; 
if Munson did not remain on their 40-man roster, they had to offer him 
back to Arizona.[26] On December 18 they brought back Lou Marson, a top 
catching prospect for the Phillies "languish[ing]" on the Cleveland Indians 
as part of a package of players traded for Cliff Lee, on a minor-league 
contract with an invitation to spring training. That day, the Phillies 
signed four other players to minor-league contracts with invitations to 
spring training: right-handed relief pitchers Sean O'Sullivan and Chris 
Bootcheck and outfielders Dave Sappelt and Tony Gwynn, Jr.. Right-handed 
starting pitcher Roberto Hernández, formerly known as Fausto Carmona, was 
signed to a one-year contract worth $4.5 million.[27] It was nearly a month 
before the Phillies signed another player; on January 13, 2014, journeyman 
infielder Ronny Cedeño was signed to a minor-league contract with a spring-training 
invitation.[28] Just over a week later they signed Chad Gaudin, a right-handed 
pitcher with starting and relief experience, a 5–2 record and a 3.06 ERA 
with the San Diego Padres in 2013 (before an August season-ending carpal 
tunnel injury), to a minor-league contract with an invitation to spring 
training;[29] he was released on February 13, 2014, after failing a physical.[30] 
On January 21 they signed Bobby Abreu, a member of the Phillies from 1998 
to 2006 who had not played in MLB since 2012 but had performed well in 
the Venezuelan Winter League, to a minor-league contract with a spring-training 
invitation.[31] On February 12, when Cole Hamels announced he would not 
be ready for opening day due to tendinitis in his throwing shoulder,[32] 
A. J. Burnett was reportedly signed to a one-year, $16 million contract[33] 
despite Amaro's previous assertion that the Phillies would make no more 
major acquisitions.[34] Burnett's salary was later clarified as $15 million, 
with a $1 million buyout clause and a partial no-trade clause.[35] To make 
room for Burnett on the roster, the Phillies designated former first-round 
draft pick Joe Savery for assignment; Savery was later claimed from waivers 
by the Oakland Athletics.[36] Shortly before opening day, the team acquired 
infielder Jayson Nix (younger brother of Laynce Nix, whom the Phillies 
acquired for their bench several years earlier) from the Tampa Bay Rays.[37] 
In Ryne Sandberg's first full season as manager (after replacing Charlie 
Manuel near the end of the 2013 season), he reconfigured the Phillies' 
staff. Among his first acquisitions were long-time friend Larry Bowa (who 
managed the Phillies from 2001 to 2004) as bench coach and former bench 
coach Pete Mackanin as third-base coach.[38] At the same time, the team 
announced the retention of Steve Henderson as hitting coach.[39] Shortly 
thereafter, the Phillies announced that Juan Samuel would switch from third- 
to first-base coach and Wally Joyner would return for a second season as 
assistant hitting coach.[40] About a month later, the team reported that 
the Detroit Tigers had lured Joyner away as their hitting coach.[41] Although 
the most difficult position to fill was pitching coach (vacated by Rich 
Dubee at the end of the 2013 season), on November 21 the Phillies announced 
that they had hired Bob McClure and retained pitching-coach candidate Rod 
Nichols[42] as bullpen coach and Jesús Tiamo as bullpen catcher.[43] Sandberg 
finished his staffing a week before Christmas by promoting minor-league 
assistant John Mizerock to assistant hitting coach.[44] On January 2, 2014, 
the Phillies and Comcast Sportsnet announced a 25-year, $2.5 billion TV 
contract; although it averaged $100 million a year, it was structured to 
begin below the average and end above it.[45] Soon after the agreement 
was reached, Comcast (who would hire announcers under the deal) removed 
37-year announcer Chris Wheeler and seven-year announcer Gary Matthews. 
Although the remaining Phillies announcers were disappointed with the decision, 
they all returned for the season. One replacement analyst was planned, 
and early candidates included Ricky Bottalico, Mitch Williams, John Kruk, 
Chris Coste, Jamie Moyer, Brad Lidge and Matt Stairs.[46] Lidge and Kruk 
were among the first to be contacted, but both declined. Mickey Morandini 
was a possibility,[47] but Stairs and Moyer reportedly interviewed well 
and were favored.[48] On February 11, Comcast announced that Moyer and 
Stairs would join Tom McCarthy and Gregg Murphy on the Phillies' TV broadcast 
team.[49] The company later announced that Moyer and Stairs would each 
call over 100 games, including 30 games together with McCarthy.[50] After 
the first spring-training game, it was announced that Mike Schmidt would 
join the broadcast team for Sunday afternoon games.[51] Early in the season, 
the new broadcast team "struggled"; Josh Folck called Moyer boring and 
monotonous and Stairs inarticulate, with a tendency to mumble. McCarthy 
was forced to "carry the broadcast and talk as much as possible" to minimize 
(but not eliminate) dead air.[52] By the season's second half it was agreed 
that the broadcast team had improved, but Chuck Darrow criticized Moyer's 
"esoteric" commentary and Stairs' poor enunciation; fans may have judged 
the new announcers based on standards set by Hall of Fame announcer Harry 
Kalas and partner Richie Ashburn.[53] According to Awful Announcing, the 
broadcast team was one of the most improved in the major leagues; when 
Moyer announced that he would not return in 2015, the website called it 
"a damn shame".[54] On February 20, 2014, Baseball America revealed that 
the Phillies reported Ben Wetzler and Jason Monda (two 2013 draft selections 
who did not sign with the club) to the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
for violating the NCAA's no-agent rule: student athletes may not use agents 
to negotiate professional contracts.[55] Although players observe the "patently 
ridiculous" rule by routinely hiring "advisors" (usually agents),[56] the 
NCAA suspended Wetzler for 11 games.[57] The Phillies were criticized for 
reporting the players: The question remains: What's the upside for the 
Phillies here? The practice of using agents in something less than a sanctioned 
manner will continue, and if anything they've made a number of advisors 
and college programs less likely to cooperate with them in the future. 
This is a pretty pitiful organization top to bottom these days, and now 
that indictment absolutely extends to the amateur scouting department. 
Bad show, Phillies. David Murphy of the Philadelphia Daily News asked if 
the Phillies wanted to punish Wetzler for not signing with them.[58] According 
to ESPN's Buster Olney, the Phillies' reporting of Wetzler and Monda would 
hurt the team in the long run: "As time passes and the Phillies’ silence 
continues, the impression hardens within the industry—particularly among 
agents and college coaches—that the team acted out of vindictiveness, because 
neither Wetzler nor Monda accepted their offer." He called the Phillies' 
decision "breathtakingly abhorrent", saying that the debacle would "tarnish 
the reputation of a respected organization".[59] Amaro dismissed the likelihood 
of retribution by agents or players, replying, "No, I'm not", when asked 
if he was concerned that the organization's reporting of Wetzler would 
hinder its ability to "glean accurate and detailed information about a 
player's willingness to go pro, or even gain access to said players".[60] 
A lack of rapport between veteran shortstop Jimmy Rollins and manager Ryne 
Sandberg attracted attention during the offseason; ESPN's Buster Olney 
described sentiment in the Phillies' organization that Rollins should be 
traded.[61] Amaro and Rollins dispelled the rumors, with Amaro calling 
them "absolute silliness".[62] Sandberg praised backup shortstop Freddy 
Galvis' attitude (which many in the media saw as the manager sending a 
message to the team that no one – including Rollins – was above team rules),[63] 
and one column examined the point at which Rollins ceased being the team's 
unquestioned leader.[64] Rollins (who had a good relationship with former 
manager Charlie Manuel) said, "He's [Sandberg's] completely different from 
Charlie from the very onset, their personalities. He's pretty much a real 
quiet guy, he really is. Charlie was a get-in-your face with jokes type 
of guy. We're still learning him, he's still learning us from this side 
of it. Being a coach and being a manager are completely different things 
– you deal with so much more being a manager."[65] After three spring-training 
games the Phillies' starting rotation already had significant health concerns, 
predominantly with throwing shoulders; Cole Hamels had discomfort in his 
left shoulder, and Jon Pettibone and Ethan Martin in their right shoulders. 
Although the club hoped to avoid a "patchwork" starting rotation like 2013's, 
it already lacked pitching depth;[66] two top prospects, Adam Morgan and 
Shane Watson, were lost for most of the season due to shoulder surgery.[67] 
Mike Adams, acquired by the Phillies as their setup man but who missed 
most of the 2013 season before offseason surgery, threw a bullpen session 
in late February and said he felt "real good" and hoped to join the bullpen 
by April.[68] David Buchanan started the Phillies' fourth spring-training 
game, pitching two good innings;[69] after the game, MLB.com Phillies beat 
reporter called him a dark-horse candidate for the Phillies' starting rotation.[70] 
Miguel Alfredo González was less effective in that game.[71] Early in March 
the Phillies announced that Hamels had a "setback" in his recovery (arm 
fatigue), and the likelihood of his pitching in April was "remote";[72] 
this necessitated a new fifth starter. The top candidates were Buchanan, 
who pitched well in his next few outings, and Jeff Manship; both had ERAs 
at or below 1.50 through March 11.[73] On March 8 the Phillies made their 
first minor-league demotions: seven players, including two (Michael Stutes 
and Luis García) with major-league experience, and top pitching prospect 
Jesse Biddle.[74] On March 17 Sandberg confirmed speculation that Cliff 
Lee would be the Phillies' opening-day starting pitcher against his former 
team, the Texas Rangers and Yu Darvish,[75][76] and Rule 5 draft selection 
Kevin Munson was returned to the Arizona Diamondbacks.[77] Concerns arose 
about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the Phillies' 
spring-training clubhouse at Bright House Field when, on March 21, Freddy 
Galvis was placed on the disabled list with a staph infection; Galvis was 
hospitalized, missing opening day,[78] and the clubhouse was disinfected 
after the next game. Darin Ruf was also placed on the DL with an oblique 
strain, incurred during batting practice that day.[79] On March 22 the 
Phillies demoted Maikel Franco to minor-league camp, making Cody Asche 
their opening-day starter at third base.[80] Although he had been expected 
to make the team, Kevin Frandsen was cut from their 40-man roster; this 
increased the possibility that "darkhorse candidate" César Hernández would 
make the team.[81] Frandsen rejected his minor-league assignment, electing 
to pursue free agency.[82] The Phillies also released Ronny Cedeño, once 
a top candidate to replace Galvis during his injury.[83] The club's bench 
narrowed when the Phillies announced that Bobby Abreu would not make the 
team (primarily due to lackluster defense), leaving Tony Gwynn, Jr., John 
Mayberry, Jr., Reid Brignac, Wil Nieves and Hernández likely to remain.[84] 
The team acquired Jayson Nix from the Tampa Bay Rays, assigning Brignac 
to Triple-A Lehigh Valley.[37][85] The Phillies began the season with six 
players on the DL: Galvis, Ruf, Mike Adams, Miguel Alfredo González, Cole 
Hamels and Ethan Martin.[86] The Phillies announced their opening-day roster 
on March 29, near the deadline. Since they did not need a fifth starter 
for two weeks, four starters, eight relievers, two catchers, six infielders 
and five outfielders made up the roster.[87] Two players who did not expect 
to make the team when they began spring training were left-handed reliever 
Mario Hollands (who said he was in "shock" when he heard the news) and 
outfielder Tony Gwynn, Jr., ending a "long road back to the majors".[88][89] 
Infielders The Phillies opened their season with a three-game series in 
Arlington, Texas against the Rangers.[90] On opening day, although they 
took a 6–0 lead (thanks in part to a grand slam by Jimmy Rollins, his 200th 
career home run), but Cliff Lee gave up seven runs in the next two innings. 
The Phillies tied the game in the fourth inning, and over the next several 
innings Marlon Byrd and Cody Asche homered. Texas scored two more runs, 
but the Phillies won 14–10.[91] Despite the 14 opening-day runs, Ryne Sandberg 
changed the lineup for the Phillies' second game (against left-handed Martin 
Perez) by replacing three left-handed hitters with right-handed hitters 
(perhaps to maximize the Phillies' platoon advantage).[92] A. J. Burnett 
started, pitching six innings and giving up one run. The game was scoreless 
until the sixth inning before the Rangers won, 3–2, on a walk-off single 
by Adrián Beltré in the bottom of the ninth.[93] Although Kyle Kendrick 
allowed one run in seven innings in the series' final game, Jonathan Papelbon 
gave up three runs in the ninth inning (including a walk-off walk to Shin-Soo 
Choo) to blow the save. The Phillies lost two of their first three games, 
despite strong starting pitching in the last two.[94][95] The club then 
traveled to Chicago to play the Cubs. They won the first game of the series, 
7–2, thanks to home runs by Utley and Mayberry and strong pitching from 
starter Roberto Hernández (who got credit for the win) and five relief 
pitchers who combined for 4 2⁄3 scoreless innings.[96] The next day Lee 
threw seven scoreless innings and Papelbon recorded his first save of the 
season as the Phillies defeated the Cubs, 2–0; Utley was three-for-three, 
including a home run, to lead the team offensively.[97] The Phillies lost 
the final game of the series, 8–3, as Burnett gave up eight runs (four 
earned) in 5 2⁄3 innings and the offense was 1-for-15 with runners in scoring 
position.[98] In the home opener against the Brewers, starter Kyle Kendrick 
gave up two of Ryan Braun's three home runs and allowed six runs (four 
earned) in five innings for a 10–4 loss.[99] The next day the Phillies 
again lost, 9–4, after the bullpen gave up five runs in the last three 
innings; three of the Brewers' nine runs were unearned, after two infield 
errors.[100] They were swept in the series, losing the final game 6–2 (the 
first time since 2007 the Phillies were swept in their first home series). 
In the series the Brewers scored 25 runs on 38 hits, 17 of which were extra 
base hits.[101] Sandberg said, "The good news is they are leaving town. 
Now we have to concentrate on gaining some momentum ... "[102] The home 
stand continued with a three-game series against the Miami Marlins. In 
the opener, Marlins starter José Fernández gave up a career-high six runs. 
A. J. Burnett, the Phillies' starter, left the game after five innings 
with an apparent groin injury (although he did not miss a start) and the 
Phillies won 6–3.[103] Jonathan Pettibone made his season debut the next 
day, pitching five innings and allowing one run. The game went into extra 
innings, and in the bottom of the 10th Rollins hit a walk-off home run 
for a 5–4 win.[104] The Phillies had their first series sweep of the season 
and returned to a .500 winning percentage (seven wins and seven losses) 
the next day, defeating the Marlins 4–3 with two RBIs from backup catcher 
Wil Nieves and a home run by Utley to break a late tie.[105] The Atlanta 
Braves then visited Philadelphia for a four-game series. In game one, Hernandez 
started for the Phillies and Ervin Santana for the Braves.[106] After a 
pitchers' duel through seven innings, the Braves hit back-to-back-to-back 
home runs in the top of the eighth before the Phillies rallied with five 
runs in the bottom of the inning (a two-RBI single by Byrd and a three-run 
home run by Domonic Brown) for a 6–5 lead entering the ninth. Since Papelbon 
had pitched in the previous three games, he was unavailable as a closer. 
Jake Diekman pitched the ninth inning, allowing a grand slam by Dan Uggla 
for a final score of 9–6.[107] Jackie Robinson Day, scheduled to be celebrated 
by the Phillies and Braves on April 15, was postponed to the following 
day when the game was rained out.[108] On April 16 Lee pitched nine innings, 
striking out 13 batters and giving up one run for a 1–0 loss.[109] In the 
series' last game, Burnett pitched seven shutout innings in a scoreless 
game before Ben Revere hit an RBI single in the eighth; Papelbon pitched 
a scoreless ninth inning for the save in the 1–0 win.[110] The Phillies 
finished the home stand with a 4–5 record.[111] The Phillies began a road 
trip with a three-game series against the Colorado Rockies. In game one, 
Pettibone gave up eight runs in four innings; with two hits, the Phillies 
lost 12–1. After the game, Pettibone was sent to the Triple-A (AAA) Lehigh 
Valley IronPigs.[112] Although Kendrick had a quality start in the second 
game, the Phillies scored one run in a 3–1 loss.[113] They salvaged the 
final game of the series, winning 10–9 despite Hernandez giving up six 
runs in four innings; Ryan Howard was four-for-five at the plate, including 
a home run, a triple and three RBIs. The Phillies lost the lead three times 
before winning the game.[114] The team then opened a four-game series against 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. Lee pitched a "gem" of a game, striking out 10 
batters in eight shutout innings; Carlos Ruiz, in the cleanup spot, hit 
two doubles and a home run for four RBIs (his first of the season) for 
the Phillies' 7–0 win.[115] They won the second game in 10 innings; Brown 
doubled, scoring Ruiz in the top of the 10th for a 3–2 lead held by Papelbon 
for his sixth save. Burnett had a good outing, and several relievers provided 
"stress-free performances" for the victory (which brought the team's winning 
percentage to .500).[116] The Phillies lost game three, Cole Hamels' season 
debut after an injury, 5–2; although Hamels had a quality start, the bullpen 
gave up three runs and the offense had five hits and struck out 13 times.[117] 
Kendrick pitched the final game of the series for a 7–3 win, behind strong 
offense from Ruiz (who reached base in all five plate appearances, scoring 
twice and driving in two runs) and Byrd (who had four RBIs).[118] In game 
two the Phillies rallied from a 5–0 deficit to win, 6–5. Ruiz was three-for-four, 
with two runs and an RBI; Gwynn had a pinch-hit RBI double, and Asche had 
a pinch-hit two-RBI double for the Phillies (who scored all their runs 
in the seventh and eighth innings). Papelbon recorded his seventh save.[119] 
The Phillies finished the road trip with a 2–0 victory behind a "brilliant" 
Burnett, for a 6–4 record on the trip.[120] For his .500 batting average 
on the road trip, Ruiz was named the NL Player of the Week.[121] To end 
April, the Phillies headed home for a two-game series against the New York 
Mets.[122] The first game was delayed due to rain; it rained throughout 
the game, which the Mets won 6–1 after the "truly embarrassed" Hamels struggled 
on the mound.[123] The Phillies announced that the game scheduled for April 
30 would be rescheduled for June 2 due to rain,[124] and ended the month 
with a 13–13 record.[1] Although Miguel Alfredo González had progressed 
in his rehab and Darin Ruf and Ethan Martin were closer to joining the 
team, the Phillies had no projected return date for any of them. Another 
problem during the first month of the season was the lack of third-base 
production; in the season's first 25 games the combined third-base batting 
average was .165, and the combined pitchers' batting average was .196.[125] 
Asche, Jayson Nix and Freddy Galvis had not asserted themselves, leading 
to speculation about the early arrival of prospect Maikel Franco despite 
his struggle at the AAA level.[126] At the end of the season's first month, 
the team's offensive leaders were Utley (.355 batting average), Howard 
(five home runs), Byrd (17 RBIs) and Revere (10 stolen bases). Pitching 
leaders were Lee and Antonio Bastardo (three wins), Burnett (2.15 ERA), 
Lee (41 innings pitched) and Mario Hollands (1.000 walks plus hits per 
inning pitched).[1][127] The bullpen struggled in April, with the worst 
ERA in the National League and three opening-day relievers relegated to 
AAA.[128] Philly.com columnist Justin Klugh called the team "pleasantly 
mediocre", noting their .500 record despite a tough early-season schedule.[1] 
This is an important series at the beginning of an important stretch for 
the Phillies ... If they are serious about their abilities to challenge 
for a postseason berth, this is the time to assert themselves as legitimate 
contenders. But Friday's 5-3 loss to the Nationals at Citizens Bank Park 
unfolded like so many other losses the past couple seasons. The Phillies 
took an early lead, but could not extend it. The bullpen then blew a one-run 
lead in spectacular fashion in the eighth inning to waste a fine starting 
pitching performance from Cliff Lee. The Phillies dropped to 4-7 at home, 
and 13-14 overall after spending the entire month of April fighting and 
clawing to post a winning record. The Phillies' first May game opened a 
series with the Washington Nationals on May 2. The Nationals won, 5–3, 
despite a quality start by Lee. Philadelphia won game two 7–2, thanks to 
a strong start from A. J. Burnett (the first Phillies starter of the season 
to win a home game), a Cody Asche home run and four–for-five hitting by 
Jimmy Rollins.[130] The Phillies took the series' rubber match, 1–0, with 
a strong start from Roberto Hernandez and a first-inning RBI triple by 
Jimmy Rollins.[129][131] The team then hosted the Toronto Blue Jays, with 
Kyle Kendrick starting against former Phillie J. A. Happ in the series' 
first game.[132] The Phillies lost, 3–0; Kendrick had no run support, losing 
his eighth consecutive decision (dating back to 2013) despite a "decent" 
ERA.[133] The club lost the next night as well, with Cole Hamels giving 
up five runs in six innings; despite a sixth-inning grand slam by Asche 
to tie the game, the Blue Jays came back in extra innings for a 6–5 win.[134] 
The home-and-home series then moved to Toronto for two games, where the 
Phillies gave up nine runs in the seventh inning of the first game to lose 
10–0.[135] After the game, Shawn Camp was outrighted from the roster and 
Luis García recalled.[136] The series concluded the next night, with five 
Blue Jays home runs giving them a 12–6 win.[137] The Phillies then began 
a three-game series at Citi Field with the New York Mets. Hernandez started 
game one, pitching five innings and allowing one run; in his first hit 
of the day, Marlon Byrd batted in Chase Utley (the go-ahead run) in the 
top of the 11th inning. Papelbon saved the game in the bottom of the 11th 
and the Phillies won 3–2, snapping a four-game losing streak.[138] They 
won another one-run game (5–4) the next night; Ryan Howard's RBI single 
in the top of the ninth gave the Phillies the lead, and Papelbon recorded 
his 11th save of the season.[139] In the final game of the series Hamels 
consistently had "an answer" to the Mets' offense, throwing a career-high 
133 pitches in seven innings, allowing one run and striking out 10 hitters. 
Entering the ninth inning, the Phillies led 4–1; with Papelbon unavailable, 
Antonio Bastardo and Hernandez squandered the lead and the Phillies lost 
5–4 in 11 innings.[140] The teams finished a series which was " ... ugly, 
between two deeply flawed teams: more than 12 hours of game time, nearly 
80 runners left on base combined."[141] Days after he was optioned to AAA, 
Freddy Galvis broke his clavicle and the Phillies outrighted Jayson Nix 
from the 40-man roster, leaving the team with an infield hole despite the 
recall of Reid Brignac.[142][143] The Los Angeles Angels came to Citizens 
Bank Park for a two-game series on May 13–14. On the 13th the Angels won, 
4–3; the four Angel runs (all unearned) were scored in the sixth inning, 
when Asche committed two of his three errors, and Lee received the loss 
despite having no earned runs.[144] The Phillies dropped four games below 
.500 (17–21) the next night, losing the series' second game 3–0 after Burnett 
"struggled through five innings".[145] The team then began a three-game 
series against the Cincinnati Reds. In game one, Devin Mesoraco hit a three-run 
home run and the Reds' pitching shut out the Phillies; despite a quality 
start, Kendrick had another loss.[146] After two straight shutouts the 
Phillies scored 12 runs in the next game, defeating Cincinnati 12–1 for 
Hamels' 100th career win; Domonic Brown had a home run and five RBIs, Asche 
had three RBIs and César Hernández hit his first major-league home run.[147] 
The Phillies took the rubber match of the series, winning 8–3 with four 
home runs (by Rollins, Asche, Byrd and Wil Nieves) and a solid start from 
Lee (his last before joining the 15-day disabled list May 21 with to a 
left-elbow strain; the team recalled Ruf, who returned from injury).[148][149] 
After a day off the Phillies played the Marlins in Miami, their second 
meeting of the season. The Phillies won the series' first game 6–5, with 
Burnett settling in after disagreements over the strike zone with home-plate 
umpire Will Little early in the game; Marlins manager Mike Redmond was 
later ejected from the game for arguing balls and strikes. Burnett pitched 
five innings, Rollins homered and Papelbon held on in the ninth for his 
12th save.[150] The Phillies lost the next two games: 14–5 on May 21, with 
a Marcell Ozuna grand slam, and 4–3 on May 22 with a walk-off single by 
Christian Yelich.[151][152] We just can't get on a roll, you know. Can't 
get things going in the right direction. Big win last night, and coming 
in today ... guys battled back, just couldn't pull it out. Next, the Dodgers 
came to Citizens Bank Park for a three-game series. After the Phillies 
lost game one (2–0) in a pitchers' duel between Hernandez and Clayton Kershaw, 
when they were zero-for-nine with runners in scoring position,[154] David 
Buchanan made his major-league debut on May 24. The Phillies won 5–3, with 
Buchanan getting the win after a five-inning start and Papelbon earning 
his 13th save.[155] The next day, Josh Beckett pitched a no-hitter for 
a 6–0 Dodger victory.[156] The next day (Memorial Day), Kendrick had his 
first win since August 6, 2013; Howard's five RBIs gave the Phillies a 
9–0 win over the Colorado Rockies.[157] The team lost game two of the series, 
6–2, despite Ben Revere's first major-league home run; Hamels allowed four 
runs in seven innings, and Jeff Manship gave up two more in the eighth.[158] 
The Phillies ended the month with a five-game series, continuing into June, 
against the New York Mets. Although Buchanan's second major-league start 
in the series opener was a quality start, the Phillies offense managed 
one run for a 4–1 loss.[159] The last two games of May went 14 innings 
apiece, with the Phillies winning the first and losing the second. In the 
first game A. J. Burnett threw seven innings and allowed five runs, after 
which six relievers threw a combined seven scoreless innings. Ruiz had 
four hits and Brown had four RBIs; Reid Brignac hit a walk-off RBI single 
to left field in the 14th inning, scoring Byrd for a 6–5 win.[160] The 
next night, after the Phillies fell behind 4–0, Howard hit a seventh-inning 
three-run home run; in the bottom of the ninth, Brown hit an RBI single 
to tie the game and send it into extra innings. In the 14th inning David 
Wright hit an RBI single to take the lead, which the Mets' bullpen held 
to win 5–4.[153] In May the Phillies' team batting average (.230) was the 
lowest in the National League, and they were near the bottom in runs scored, 
home runs and slugging percentage. For the season to date they were 10th 
in the NL in batting average (.243), 12th in home runs (43), fourth in 
walks and 10th in strikeouts. Despite offensive mediocrity the pitching 
staff improved since April, with the starting rotation's May ERA (3.96) 
sixth in the NL and the bullpen's ERA (3.35) eighth in the league. The 
bullpen remained near the bottom of the NL, with a 4.05 ERA for the season 
to date.[161] Asche had a strong May (unlike April) before his injury, 
with a .317 batting average, three home runs and 12 RBIs. Although Utley 
regressed from April, he had a .291 batting average and 13 RBIs. Brown 
struggled, batting .146 despite 17 RBIs (second on the team).[162] Kendrick 
led the pitching staff in May innings pitched, with 37 2⁄3; Burnett led 
with two wins, and Hernandez had a 1.73 ERA in four starts and two relief 
appearances (among the best on the staff).[163] At the end of May, the 
Phillies were 24–29 for the season and 11–16 for the month.[164] After 
two consecutive extra-inning games, the Phillies recalled Philippe Aumont 
from Triple-A and Cesar Jimenez from the 15-day disabled list (for a strained 
right quadriceps) to replace Darin Ruf and Jeff Manship before game four 
of their five-game series with the Mets; it was the first major-league 
roster appearance for both.[166] The team's first June game went into extra 
innings. With the score tied 2–2 after nine, Aumont gave up two runs in 
the top of the 11th inning; the Phillies scored once in the bottom of the 
inning, losing 4–3.[167] They lost the fifth game of the series, 11–2. 
"After five games and 57 innings of torturous baseball, the Phillies-Mets 
Citizens Bank Park horror show is finally over. And it did not go well," 
wrote John Stolnis of The Good Phight, the Phillies blog on SBNation.com.[168] 
Before their next series the Phillies demoted Aumont (who had a 21.60 ERA 
in two appearances) to the minor leagues and recalled Ethan Martin, who 
pitched well in Triple-A after an early-season shoulder injury.[169] For 
additional pitching depth they signed Jason Marquis, who was returning 
from Tommy John surgery.[170] Although before the series with the Nationals 
Sandberg had a "serious meeting" with the players to explain the need for 
greater urgency on the field,[171] the Phillies were swept.[172] In game 
one they were shut out for the seventh time in their last 27 games, losing 
7–0 as Buchanan struggled in his first road start.[173] Burnett started 
the next night, also struggling through six innings and allowing eight 
runs in a rain-delayed 8–4 loss.[174] When Kendrick started the series' 
final game, the Phillies jumped into the lead with a first-inning run before 
losing 4–2 (their sixth consecutive loss).[172] After the series, the team 
called up Ronny Cedeño for his Phillies debut.[175] The Phillies then began 
a road trip, with their first stop Cincinnati. Before the trip they placed 
Mike Adams (with an inflamed right rotator cuff) on the disabled list and 
promoted Ken Giles, a top prospect with a 100-mile-per-hour (160 km/h) 
fastball.[176] The Phillies snapped a six-game losing streak when they 
scored eight runs and Cole Hamels pitched 7 2⁄3 shutout innings for an 
8–0 win.[165] They lost the next game 6–5, as two innings ended with runners 
thrown out at home plate by relays from the outfield. The first play was 
reviewed because of the new MLB rule limiting a catcher's ability to block 
home plate, and Sandberg was ejected from the game for arguing the result 
(the first time he was thrown out since he began managing the Phillies).[177] 
The Reds won the series' final game, 4–1,[178] before the Phillies returned 
home to sweep the San Diego Padres. In game one, Burnett earned his first 
win in six starts and Papelbon his 300th career save in a 5–2 final.[179] 
The next night was a scoreless, 8 1⁄2-inning pitchers' duel between Hamels 
and Tyson Ross before Reid Brignac's three-run walk-off home run.[180] 
Brignac had another "key hit" the next day, when the Phillies won 7–3 with 
strong pitching from Kendrick.[181] The home stand continued with a series 
against the Cubs. The first game was a 1960s "turn back the clock" night, 
with both teams in 1964 uniforms. The Cubs won, 2–1; in a move called "horrible" 
by Phillies announcer Jamie Moyer, home-plate umpire Mark Ripperger ejected 
Roberto Hernandez from the game in the sixth inning for hitting Starlin 
Castro without first warning Hernandez. Sandberg was ejected for arguing 
Hernandez' ejection.[182][183] In game two Jimmy Rollins hit a single to 
right field, passing Mike Schmidt to become the Phillies' all-time hitting 
leader with 2,235. They won 7–4, with Buchanan earning his second win of 
the season and Papelbon his 15th save.[184] The Cubs won the Father's Day 
rubber match of the series 3–0, with Travis Wood holding the Phillies to 
three hits.[185] After their 4–2 home stand, the Phillies traveled to Atlanta 
to play the Braves. The series' first game lasted 13 innings, with the 
Phillies scoring five runs in the top of the 13th for a 6–1 win. Aaron 
Altherr, called up to replace Tony Gwynn, Jr. (on the bereavement list 
after the death of his father, Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn), pinch-hit in 
the bottom of the 12th inning for his major-league debut.[186] Kendrick 
started for the Phillies in game two of the series, "assertive[ly]" overcoming 
his previous first-inning struggles and allowing two runs in seven innings 
for a 5–2 win.[187] The team swept the Braves, winning the final game of 
the series 10–5; Marlon Byrd had three RBIs and a home run,[188] but backup 
catcher Wil Nieves (who had three hits in the game) hurt his leg rounding 
first base after hitting a ground rule double. The Phillies called up Cameron 
Rupp as backup catcher, demoting Altherr while Nieves recovered.[189][190] 
They then traveled to St. Louis for a four-game series with the Cardinals. 
Buchanan started for the Phillies in the "best performance of his young 
career", pitching 7 2⁄3 innings and allowing one run in a 4–1 victory. 
Ryan Howard hit a home run, his 14th of the season, in his hometown.[191] 
Brignac injured his ankle in a slide; he went on the DL, and Asche returned 
from the list.[192] The next day, Burnett pitched the Phillies to their 
ninth win (5–1) in 11 games.[193] They split the series, losing the last 
two games: a June 21 pitchers' duel between Hamels and Adam Wainwright 
(the 4–1 loss ended the Phillies' five-game winning streak) and a 5–3 loss 
the following day, with Kendrick giving up four runs in one inning.[194][195] 
The Phillies ended the month with two four-game home series, against the 
Marlins and Braves. In their first game against the Marlins, a 4–0 loss, 
they had six hits.[196] The next night the Phillies won, 7–4; Asche and 
Byrd had two RBIs each and the bullpen was solid.[197] In the third game, 
Domonic Brown failed to catch a fly ball to left field; three runs scored 
in a 3–2 loss.[198] The Phillies won the series' final game, 5–3, with 
a 14th-inning walk-off home run by Chase Utley.[199] After the game, Carlos 
Ruiz was placed on the disabled list with to a concussion sustained in 
the 11th inning.[200] After the Phillies swept the Braves earlier in the 
month, the Braves returned the favor in the month's final series for both 
teams. In game one Kendrick returned to his old ways, allowing three runs 
in the first inning of a 4–2 loss.[201] The next day, June 28, featured 
a day-night doubleheader. Hernandez started the afternoon game; two errors 
and six runs allowed by the bullpen led to a 10–3 loss.[202] In the night 
game, the Phillies called up Sean O'Sullivan for his season debut and lost 
5–1. After this game (the 81st of the 162-game season), the Phillies had 
a 36–45 record[203] before losing the series' final game 3–2.[204] In June 
César Hernández was the team's leading hitter, with a .348 batting average; 
Byrd led the team with eight home runs and 17 RBIs, and Ben Revere led 
the team with eight stolen bases. Ruiz and Mayberry struggled, with respective 
batting averages of .200 and .206 and combining for four home runs and 
15 RBIs. Mario Hollands and Justin De Fratus did not allow an earned run 
all month (22 2⁄3 combined innings pitched), with Papelbon allowing one 
earned run and accumulating five saves. Hamels was the team's best starting 
pitcher; in six starts, he posted a 1.23 ERA and his opposing hitters batted 
.214. David Buchanan and Roberto Hernandez had ERAs of over 5.00 for the 
month, with a combined eight losses.[205] The bullpen was fourth in the 
NL with a 2.63 ERA, and the starting rotation ranked 12th in the league 
with a 3.89 ERA. The Phillies' offense ranked 10th, with a .240 batting 
average; eighth in homes runs (22), and 10th in runs scored (104).[206] 
Due to their lackluster 2013 performance, the Phillies had the seventh 
first-round pick in the June 5–7 MLB draft. They selected Aaron Nola, a 
starting pitcher from Louisiana State University predicted by many to be 
one of the first draft picks to reach the major leagues, for fast-tracking 
through the Phillies' minor-league system.[207][208] In the second round, 
they selected another pitcher – lefthander Matt Imhof, who played college 
ball with the Cal Poly Mustangs – and selected Aaron Brown, a pitcher-outfielder 
from Pepperdine, in the third round. The Phillies changed their organizational 
draft philosophy from drafting unpolished players with potential to selecting 
players ready to contribute to the big-league club, picking only one high-school 
player in the first 28 rounds.[209] Michael Baumann wrote on the Crashburn 
Alley blog, "Given how high the Phillies drafted and how bad their farm 
system is at the top, I wanted them to get back into the game with one 
swing. This draft won’t do that, but generally you want to get at least 
one good major league player out of every draft class, plus some odds and 
ends."[210] The good thing is we didn't get swept. We were able to get 
a win. Hopefully it'll propel us into some more. Getting swept is a bad 
feeling. Then having to get on a plane after that is even worse. We have 
to just keep grinding away. The Phillies entered July with a 36–46 record 
(last in the NL East), and began a 10-game road trip. In the first series, 
they played the Miami Marlins; the first game was an 11-inning 5–4 loss, 
despite 10 strikeouts in six innings from A. J. Burnett and back-to-back 
home runs in the eighth by Marlon Byrd and Cody Asche.[212] The next night 
the Phillies were shut out 5–0, their 11th shutout in 84 games (which Ryne 
Sandberg called "hard to believe"). During the game, Mario Hollands' 18-inning 
scoreless streak[a] ended when he gave up a two-run homer to Jarrod Saltalamacchia.[213] 
The Phillies salvaged the final game of the series, scoring two runs in 
the ninth inning to defeat the Marlins 5–4.[211] After Miami, the Phillies' 
next stop was PNC Park to play the Pittsburgh Pirates. The first game, 
on the Fourth of July in "picture-postcard holiday weather", was an 8–2 
loss for the Phillies and their 11th in 14 games; the team never recovered 
from Roberto Hernandez' allowing four runs in the first inning.[214] They 
lost 3–2 the next night, with the Pirates again scoring in the first inning 
to lead the entire game despite a late Phillies comeback attempt.[215] 
The Phillies were swept the next day, losing 6–2 behind A. J. Burnett to 
Jeff Locke (whom Burnett mentored the previous season) and Russell Martin 
(Burnett's former catcher). Locke allowed one earned run in eight innings, 
and Martin drove in two runs.[216] The Phillies began a four-game series 
against the Milwaukee Brewers, who had the best record in the NL, with 
the third-worst record in the league.[217] The Phillies won the first game 
3–2, with a first-inning home run by Chase Utley and good pitching from 
Cole Hamels, Ken Giles and Jonathan Papelbon.[218] The next night they 
overcame a 5–1 first-inning deficit to beat the Brewers 9–7, thanks to 
three RBIs apiece from Utley and Domonic Brown.[219] Hernandez had his 
best start of the season in the series' third game, allowing one run in 
eight innings on 84 pitches (unusual, since his pitch count was among the 
highest in the major leagues).[220] The Phillies swept the Brewers the 
next afternoon; hitless in the first six innings, they scored seven runs 
in the eighth inning and two more in the ninth to win 9–1. David Buchanan, 
allowing one solo home run in seven innings, was the winning pitcher. It 
was the first Phillies sweep of a four-game series since 2011, when they 
defeated the Cincinnati Reds in late August and early September.[221] After 
the game the team called up former all-star outfielder Grady Sizemore, 
whom they had signed to a minor-league contract in June, as an extra bat 
in their final series before the All-Star break.[222][223] The Phillies 
returned home to play the Washington Nationals before the break. With Sizemore 
leading their lineup for the first time, they won 6–2; Burnett allowed 
two runs in 7 2⁄3 innings and Jimmy Rollins hit two home runs.[224] The 
team's five-game winning streak ended on July 12, when they lost to the 
Nationals 5–3 in 10 innings with 15 strikeouts.[225] The Phillies ended 
the unofficial first half of their season[b] with another loss, bowing 
to the Nationals 10–3 in the series' rubber match.[226] The second half 
of the season began on a sour note as the Phillies lost to the Braves 6–4, 
with Burnett giving up six runs in five innings.[227] The next night (July 
19) they edged the Braves 2–1 behind a "masterful" performance from Hamels, 
who struck out nine batters in seven innings and allowed one run in a pitchers' 
duel with Aaron Harang.[228] The Phillies lost the rubber match 8–2, with 
the Braves scoring six runs in the first three innings,[229] before returning 
home to face the San Francisco Giants in a four-game series. The team made 
a number of roster changes, recalling Cliff Lee, Wil Nieves and Reid Brignac 
from the disabled list, designating Tony Gwynn, Jr. for assignment, optioning 
César Hernández to Triple-A and outrighting Koyie Hill from the roster.[c][230] 
Lee started the first game of the series (a 7–4 loss despite 14 Phillies 
hits), allowing six runs and 12 hits in 5 2⁄3 innings.[231] Although the 
next evening's 14-inning game showcased Phillies trade candidates (including 
Byrd and Antonio Bastardo) to the team scouts in attendance, they lost 
9–6 when the Giants scored four runs on Jeff Manship in the 14th.[232] 
Before the second half of the series the Phillies activated Carlos Ruiz 
from the DL, recalled Philippe Aumont to replace Cameron Rupp and Manship, 
placed John Mayberry, Jr. on the DL and recalled Darin Ruf.[233] In the 
series' third game, after Burnett's eight scoreless innings Papelbon gave 
up three runs in the ninth to lose 3–1.[234] The Phillies salvaged the 
final game of the series (2–1) when Hamels struck out 10, allowed one run 
in eight innings, and Byrd and Utley drove in a run apiece.[235] The home 
stand continued with three games against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Phillies 
outfielders Sizemore, Ruf and Brown powered the team to a 9–5 victory in 
the first game; Kendrick earned the win by pitching 5 2⁄3 innings, allowing 
three runs,[236] and Sizemore recorded his 1,000th career hit.[237] The 
next night was Lee's final opportunity to pitch before interested scouts 
before the trade deadline. He allowed three runs in five innings and the 
Phillies squandered a four-run lead, losing 10–6 in 10 innings.[238] They 
won the rubber match the next day, when Roberto Hernandez pitched seven 
strong innings and Ryan Howard hit a two-run homer and scored the go-ahead 
run (ending a week in which he had been benched).[239] The team began a 
road trip against two division rivals: the Mets and the Nationals. In the 
first game of the Mets series, the Phillies lost 7–1 against Bartolo Colón; 
although Colón and A. J. Burnett (the Phillies' starter) were trade candidates, 
neither was traded.[240][241][242] The next day Utley hit a grand slam 
and Hamels continued his dominance as the Phillies shut out the Mets 6–0,[243] 
but the Mets routed the Phillies 11–2 in the series finale.[244] The last 
game of the month opened a four-game series with the Nationals; the Phillies 
won 10–4 but Lee re-injured his elbow, probably ending his season.[245] 
The Phillies batted .248 in July (11th in the National League), hit 24 
home runs (fourth in the NL) and scored 111 runs (third in the league).[246] 
For the season to date they had a .243 batting average (10th in NL), 89 
home runs (eighth in the league) and 426 runs (also eighth).[247] Of those 
who played the entire month, Ben Revere led the team with a .359 batting 
average and seven stolen bases and his July success raised his season batting 
average to .301.[248] Rollins' seven home runs in July led the team, as 
did Utley's 19 RBIs. Sizemore was a team leader at the plate, batting .328 
with one home run and five RBIs in 16 games. Ryan Howard (.165, with two 
home runs) and Tony Gwynn, Jr. (.111 before his July 31 release) struggled 
at the plate that month.[249][250] Phillies pitchers ranked 13th in the 
NL in ERA (4.62) and 11th in WHIP (1.33) and BAA (.266).[251] Their season 
ERA of 4.05 was 13th in the league.[252] The team's best starting pitchers 
in July were Cole Hamels (4–1, with a 1.94 ERA in six starts) and Roberto 
Hernandez (2–1, with a 3.76 ERA in four starts). Ken Giles led the team 
in July ERA (0.66), Justin De Fratus in appearances (14), Hamels in innings 
pitched (41 2⁄3) and Jonathan Papelbon in BAA (.159) and WHIP (0.69). Mario 
Hollands struggled on the mound that month, with a 15.26 ERA in eight appearances, 
and Kyle Kendrick was 2–3 with a 6.94 ERA in six starts.[253] At of the 
end of June the Phillies, with a 36–46 record, were at the bottom of the 
NL East[206] and most observers agreed that they should be "sellers" rather 
than "buyers" (trade better players for future prospects, rather than trading 
future prospects for established players) by the July 31 trade deadline.[254] 
However, the Phillies management (including general manager Ruben Amaro, 
Jr. and president Dave Montgomery) did not think a fire sale would benefit 
the organization. According to Amaro: "I can’t blow this team up for five 
years and expect us to be (bad) for the next five or six years. I don’t 
think that's the right way to go about our franchise. Our fans, our organization, 
I think we owe it to a lot of people, if we do have to go into a transition, 
it's going to be a shorter one than that. There's ways to do it. You have 
to make shrewd moves, make intelligent moves and try to continue to do 
that so that they drop off isn’t long term. So if we have to go a step 
backward for a year or two to move forward then that's what we’ll try to 
do." Marlon Byrd and closer Jonathan Papelbon were top trade candidates 
because of other teams' needs and the fact that neither had no-trade clauses.[256][257] 
Papelbon expressed a willingness to be traded, saying that it was "mind-boggling" 
to him that some players would prefer to remain on a losing team.[258] 
According to a USA Today article: "Amaro has been reluctant to break up 
a team that won five straight NL East titles from 2007-11, captured two 
pennants and won a World Series. But it's clear this overpriced group isn't 
going anywhere. The Phillies need prospects and don't have immediate help 
in the minor leagues. Trading some of the veterans now could help the team 
start fresh." Although Amaro announced Cole Hamels' availability, his high 
asking price hindered the possibility of a deal.[260] Cliff Lee had been 
available, but after re-injuring his elbow (and probably missing the rest 
of the season) the possibility of a deal evaporated.[261] The non-waiver 
trade deadline passed with no trades by the Phillies.[262] Amaro was harshly 
criticized for holding onto Papelbon, Byrd, Hamels, Lee, A. J. Burnett 
and Antonio Bastardo.[263] Although they did not make a deal before the 
non-waiver trading deadline, the team could still move a player on waivers;[264] 
they did so, trading Roberto Hernandez to the Dodgers on August 7 for two 
players to be named later.[265] The first named player was Jesmuel Valentin, 
son of former major leaguer José Valentín and a switch-hitting second baseman 
called a "breakout candidate" by a Baseball Prospectus writer.[266] Observers 
generally considered Valentin a good fit for the Phillies, since the team 
did not give up much in return.[267] Several weeks later the Phillies acquired 
their second named player, right-handed pitcher Victor Arano, to complete 
the trade. Arano, rated the Dodgers' 14th-best prospect by MLB.com, had 
a 94-mile-per-hour (151 km/h) fastball and a slider in his repertoire.[268][269] 
According to a Dodgers source, he had potential as a back-of-the-rotation 
starter.[270] Shortly before the September 1 waiver deadline, the Phillies 
traded "perennial fourth outfielder" John Mayberry, Jr. to the Toronto 
Blue Jays for third-base prospect Gustavo Pierre][271][272] The Phillies 
began August by placing Cliff Lee on the disabled list, replacing him on 
the roster with Cesar Jimenez; however, David Buchanan was eventually expected 
to take Lee's place in the starting rotation.[273] They continued their 
series with the Washington Nationals, winning 2–1 with another strong outing 
from Roberto Hernandez and a home run by Marlon Byrd.[274] After wins in 
the series' first two games, starting pitcher A. J. Burnett was ejected 
in the second inning of the third game for arguing with home plate umpire 
Chris Guccione about the strike zone. Burnett's first ejection in his 16-season 
career sparked 11 runs by the Nationals, who shut out the Phillies.[275] 
The team also lost the rubber match 4–0 the following day, when Cole Hamels 
had no run support in a pitchers' duel with Stephen Strasburg.[276] After 
a day off the Phillies hosted the Houston Astros, whose 47–65 record was 
two games worse than theirs.[277] The series opener was another pitchers' 
duel, with Kyle Kendrick and Dallas Keuchel allowing one run apiece in 
seven innings. Seven Phillies relievers then combined for eight shutout 
innings before they won, 2–1, in the bottom of the 15th with a Ryan Howard 
walk-off RBI single to score Grady Sizemore. Howard also hit a home run 
in the game's second inning.[278][279] The Phillies' success continued 
in their next game, when Buchanan (starting for Lee) had a quality start 
and his first career RBI at the plate in a 10–3 victory over the Astros.[280] 
In the Phillies' organization, first-round draft pick Aaron Nola was promoted 
to the Reading Fightin' Phils (the team's Double-A affiliate) and had a 
"solid" first outing.[281] Sean O'Sullivan was called up in place of the 
recently traded Roberto Hernandez. Although O'Sullivan gave up five runs 
(including three home runs) in six innings, the Phillies scored five runs 
in the eighth inning – including a grand slam by Howard – to win 6–5 and 
sweep the Astros.[282] The team then opened a four-game series with the 
Mets; in game one, the Phillies lost 5–4 after scoring three runs in the 
ninth inning.[283] Hamels' lack of run support continued in game two; although 
he allowed only one run in seven innings, Antonio Bastardo gave up an RBI 
single to Lucas Duda for a 2–1 loss.[284] That night (August 9), the Phillies 
placed former manager Charlie Manuel on their Wall of Fame.[285] The next 
afternoon Howard hit a walk-off single, capping a rally from a five-run 
deficit and giving Ken Giles his first career win.[286] Shortly after the 
Phillies claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and designated O'Sullivan 
for assignment, Williams started in the opener of a two-game series with 
the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving 
up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels 
won 7–2.[287] The Phillies also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's 
inconsistency continued.[288] The second (and final) series of the road 
trip pitted the Phillies against the San Francisco Giants.[289] Hamels 
started game one, allowing a three-run homer in the fourth inning to give 
the Giants a 3–0 lead. The Phillies rallied, with a Marlon Byrd home run 
in the fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in 
the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases 
loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give the Phillies 
a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save.[290] In the second game, the Phillies 
jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants 
rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher 
stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5.[291] The Phillies 
also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan 
and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse 
and Brandon Crawford.[292] The Phillies returned home to face the Seattle 
Mariners in a three-game series,[293] and two unlikely players were key 
contributors in the team's win in the series opener: Jerome Williams allowed 
one run in seven innings and Andrés Blanco hit a three-run homer (his first 
home run in three years) to defeat the Mariners, 4–1.[294][295][296] The 
next night, Burnett's struggles during the second half of the season continued 
as he gave up five runs in 7 2⁄3 innings for a 5–2 loss.[297] The Phillies 
then edged the Mariners 4–3, with help from Wil Nieves (three hits) and 
the bullpen (Jake Diekman, Giles and Papelbon pitched four scoreless innings, 
striking out nine).[298] The Phillies' home stand continued with a three-game 
series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kendrick started game one; despite 
his continued first-inning struggles (he allowed three runs in the first, 
raising his season first-inning ERA to 9.69), the Phillies batted around 
in the third to take a 5–4 lead and strong pitching from both teams enabled 
them to hang on for the win.[299] The next night, mental errors by the 
Phillies cost them the game 6–5 in 12 innings.[300] Williams started the 
series' rubber match, continuing his effectiveness in a 7–1 win with eight 
strong innings and driving in a run with a suicide squeeze. The series 
win was the Phillies' first consecutive-series victory since April, a 33-series 
drought and their longest since 1996–1997.[301] The final series of the 
home stand featured the Washington Nationals. After Burnett's poor pitching 
led some to suggest that he would retire after the season, he dominated 
game one by striking out 12 batters and allowing one run in seven innings 
for a 3–2 win.[302] The Phillies' success continued the next day, when 
Sandberg started Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf in place of Chase Utley and 
Ryan Howard. Ruf and Galvis combined for four hits, two runs and three 
RBIs in a 4–3 victory.[303] The team swept the series when Sizemore entered 
the game as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning, and his two-run homer helped 
the Phillies to an 8–4 final score.[304] After three series victories, 
the Phillies went to Citi Field for a three-game series with the Mets. 
Although a game-one win would have lifted them out of last place in their 
division for the first time since June, they lost 4–1 on a fielding error 
by Sizemore (who said he "let the team down").[305] The Phillies evened 
the series with Williams' quality start in the second game, winning 7–2,[306] 
but their series-victory streak ended when they lost the final game 6–5 
(A. J. Burnett's 15th loss of the season).[307] Although the Phillies won 
14 games and lost 13 in August, their first winning month since March (when 
they were 1–0), Ruben Amaro said that the team needed "significant" changes 
to contend in the near future.[308] They were in the middle of the NL in 
August, ranking eighth in batting average (.251), seventh in runs scored 
(107) and tied for fifth place in home runs (23).[309] Among the team's 
offensive leaders that month were Ruf and Revere, who batted .370 and .311; 
Byrd, who led the team with five home runs; Howard, who led with 23 RBIs 
and Rollins, who led with 13 walks. Ruiz struggled at the plate in August, 
batting .217 with two home runs and seven RBIs.[310] The difference in 
quality between starting and relief pitching persisted; in August, starting 
pitchers had a 3.76 ERA (10th in the NL) and the bullpen ERA was 2.60 (third 
in the league). The team's 3.26 August ERA was fifth in the NL.[309] Relievers 
Papelbon, Diekman and Giles had a strong month, with each below a 2.00 
ERA in at least 12 appearances, and Antonio Bastardo was the only Phillies 
reliever pitching at least 10 games with an ERA above 3.00. Jerome Williams 
led the starting staff with three wins and a 2.03 ERA in 26 2⁄3 innings 
pitched, but A. J. Burnett's struggles continued: a 1–5 record, with a 
5.50 ERA in six starts.[311] The Phillies began September in Atlanta with 
a three-game series against the Braves on a high note: Cole Hamels, Jake 
Diekman, Ken Giles and Jonathan Papelbon combined to pitch a no-hitter, 
the 11th combined no-hitter in major-league history, for a 7–0 victory.[312][313][314][315] 
The next day "Atlanta's offense remained in desultory mode" and Kyle Kendrick 
was helped by double plays to a Phillies 4–0 win, extending the Braves' 
scoreless streak to 24 innings.[316] In the series' final game, Phillies 
reliever Mario Hollands left the game with a season-ending injury and Miguel 
Alfredo González made his major-league debut in a 7–4 loss.[317] After 
a day off, the road trip continued with a three-game series against the 
Washington Nationals. In game one the Phillies came back twice from five-run 
deficits to beat the Nationals 9–8 in 11 innings, with Ben Revere hitting 
his second career home run.[318] The next day was another pitchers' duel; 
A. J. Burnett had his second consecutive solid start, allowing one run 
in seven innings for a 3–1 win. According to Ryne Sandberg, Burnett had 
the "best movement he's had on the ball this year".[319] For the second 
straight series, the Phillies won the first two games but failed to sweep. 
Starter Cole Hamels committed a balk, allowing a runner to advance to third 
base and score on a sacrifice fly for a 3–2 loss.[320] The Phillies then 
returned home for seven games against the Pirates and Marlins. In the first 
Pirates game, Jimmy Rollins tripled and scored in the fourth inning before 
leaving the game with a hamstring injury and the Phillies lost 6–4.[321] 
The Phillies won the second game, 4–3 (their lone victory of the four-game 
series), with the help of Freddy Galvis; Galvis, batting eighth in the 
order, hit a home run and scored three runs.[322] In his first start against 
the Phillies since he was traded, Pittsburgh starter Vance Worley then 
earned a 6–3 win for the Pirates.[323] The Phillies scored one run in the 
series' conclusion, a 4–1 loss.[324] Their home stand continued with a 
three-game series against the Marlins. Batting second (a career first) 
in the first game, Cody Asche hit his first career walk-off hit: a home 
run in the tenth inning for a 3–1 victory.[325] In the next game, possibly 
Kyle Kendrick's final start with the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park (since 
his contract expired at the end of the season), he pitched 6 1⁄3 innings 
and allowed one run in the Phillies' 2–1 win.[326] They failed to sweep, 
however, when Papelbon's blown save gave the Marlins a 5–4 win in the series' 
final game.[327] There has not been much to smile about lately for the 
Phillies as they approach the end of their second straight losing season. 
Saturday's 3-0 win over the A's, however, was peppered with bright spots. 
Ken Giles, the team's possible closer of the future, earned his first career 
save on his 24th birthday. Jerome Williams made baseball history, becoming 
the first pitcher to earn three wins against the same opponent as a member 
of three different teams. And Freddy Galvis continued to make the most 
of his time as the starting shortstop, hitting a two-run homer to break 
a scoreless tie in the seventh. The Phillies then headed to San Diego to 
face the Padres in a four-game series, managing two hits in the opener 
to spoil Jerome Williams' solid start with a 1–0 loss.[329] Although the 
next night a 5–4 loss (their 82nd) clinched a losing season,[330] they 
won game three 5–2 behind a "stellar outing" by Hamels.[331] The Phillies 
then lost the fourth game of the series, 7–3,[332] before continuing their 
West Coast trip with a series against the Oakland Athletics. Despite a 
good start from David Buchanan in the series' opener, the Phillies scored 
once in a 3–1 loss.[333] They won the second 3–0, a game "peppered" with 
bright spots,[328] before losing the 10-inning rubber match of the series 
8–6.[334] The team flew to Miami for the season's penultimate series. Despite 
Hamels' quality start in game one, the Phillies were shut out 2–0.[335] 
In the second game Kendrick made possibly his final start in a Phillies 
uniform a fine overall effort, allowing one run in seven innings of a 2–1 
win and going three-for-three at the plate (doubling and driving in a run).[336] 
The Phillies lost the series, with the bullpen failing to hold the lead 
in a third-game 6–4 loss.[337] Their final series of the season, at home, 
was three games with the Braves. The Phillies won the opener with a strong 
start by Williams, who ended his Phillies season with a 2.83 ERA.[338] 
Although Burnett pitched decently in game two, the Braves won 4–2.[339] 
The Phillies' season ended when Hamels, despite a quality start, was on 
the losing end of a 2–1 final score.[340] September's offense sputtered, 
with a .228 batting average, 3.31 runs per game and a .615 on-base plus 
slugging percentage (13th, 14th and 14th, respectively, of the 15 NL teams). 
Pitching was better, with the starters' 3.27 cumulative ERA fourth in the 
NL and the relievers' 3.09 cumulative ERA fifth in the league.[341] Cesar 
Hernandez led the team with a .333 batting average in 14 games, and Freddy 
Galvis and Ryan Howard hit three home runs apiece. Ben Revere's 13 RBIs 
and nine stolen bases were the Phillies' September best. Carlos Ruiz struggled, 
batting .193 despite two home runs and eight RBIs.[342] Justin De Fratus 
and Ken Giles led the bullpen with ERAs of 0.00 and 0.82 in nine and eleven 
games, respectively. Cole Hamels was the Phillies' best starting pitcher 
that month, with a 2–3 record despite a 1.96 ERA.[343] All players who
