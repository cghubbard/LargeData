WINS (1010 kHz), known on-air as "10-10 Wins", is a radio station in New 
York City, owned by CBS Radio. WINS's studios are in the combined CBS Radio 
facility in the Hudson Square area of Manhattan, and transmitting towers 
in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. WINS is the oldest all-news radio station in 
the United States, broadcasting in that format continuously since 1965. 
WINS can be heard in the HD Radio format on both its own frequency and 
at WNEW-FM's HD-3 feed.[1] The station began broadcasting first during 
1924 on 950 kHz as WGBS, named after and broadcasting from its owner, Gimbels 
department store. It moved to 860 kHz sometime around 1927, to 600 around 
1930, settling on 1180 around 1931. The station was bought by William Randolph 
Hearst in 1932, and it adopted its present callsign (named after Hearst's 
International News Service) the same year,[2] effective January 15.[3] 
WINS relocated from the Hotel Lincoln to the WINS Building, 114 East 58th 
Street, June 19, 1932.[4] It changed its frequency from 1180 to 1000 on 
March 29, 1941 as part of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement 
and then eventually to 1010 on October 30, 1943. The Cincinnati-based Crosley 
Broadcasting Corporation announced its purchase of the station from Hearst 
in 1945,[5][6] though it would be over a year before Crosley would take 
control of WINS, in July 1946.[7] Crosley sold the station to J. Elroy 
McCaw's Gotham Broadcasting Corporation in 1953,[8][9] and soon after WINS 
became one of the first stations in the United States to play rock and 
roll music. Alan Freed was WINS earliest famous personality as disc jockey. 
Freed was followed years later by Murray "the K" Kaufman. Sports broadcaster 
Les Keiter, a latter-day member of the first generation of legends in that 
field, served as sports director for a period in the 1950s. Keiter is perhaps 
best remembered for his recreations of San Francisco (formerly New York) 
Giants baseball games, which WINS carried in 1958 to keep disconnected 
Giants fans in touch with their team, who moved west along with the Brooklyn 
Dodgers the previous year. By the early 1960s, WINS faced stiff competition 
for the rock-and-roll audience from three other stations, WMCA, WMGM, and 
WABC. The competition continued after WINS was purchased by the Westinghouse 
Electric Corporation in 1962.[10] By 1963, WMCA upstaged them all and became 
the top-rated top 40 station in the New York area (only to be eclipsed 
two years later by WABC, whose 50,000-watt, clear-channel signal was 10 
times stronger than WMCA's). WINS consequently saw a decline of ratings 
between 1963 and 1965, normally trailing WMCA and WABC by some distance. 
By this time, WMGM had already defected to a beautiful music format under 
its previous call letters, WHN, in February 1962. The last song played 
on WINS before it became a news station was "Out in the Streets", by The 
Shangri-Las,[11] on April 18, 1965, at around 8 PM. On April 19, 1965, 
after weeks of speculation, WINS changed its format radically. It became 
the third radio station in the United States to attempt all-news programming, 
going with the new format around the clock.[12][13] WINS immediately established 
a template for its format with an easily identifiable, distinctive Teletype 
sound effect playing in the background (Most other all-news stations later 
dropped this, but WINS continues to use it to this day despite Teletype 
machines themselves becoming obsolete by the mid-1980s), and with slogans 
such as "All news, all the time"; "The newswatch never stops"; "Listen 
two, three, four times a day"; and "You give us 22 minutes, we'll give 
you the world". The latter tagline was a reference to WINS's format clock, 
which resets every twenty minutes. In 1995 Westinghouse Electric purchased 
CBS, a move which made WINS a sister station to its long-time rival WCBS 
(880 AM). Early on, there had been speculation that either station would 
drop the all-news format, but these notions were squelched rather quickly. 
In fact, the performance differences in both stations supplement their 
continued overlap. WINS's ratings numbers are better within New York City, 
while WCBS's listener strength is greater in the suburbs, owing primarily 
to its much stronger signal. From a programming standpoint, WINS's harder 
approach is offset by WCBS' lighter, more conversational style, especially 
in peak morning and afternoon drive periods. Since the Westinghouse-CBS 
merger, both stations have continued to perform well in both ratings and 
advertising revenue. Despite being owned by CBS, WINS was affiliated with, 
ironically, ABC News Radio until January 1, 2015, when their distributor, 
Westwood One, dropped ABC News Radio in favor for an in-house, CNN-powered 
service, "Westwood One News". WINS did not clear the network newscasts, 
but did air vocal reports and sound bites. The Top of the Hour ID words 
at the beginning was, during 1010 WINS' 50th anniversary in 2015: "Celebrating 
50 Years, of All News, All The Time. This is 1010 WINS. You give us 22 
minutes, we'll give you the world." WINS's switch to all-news was initially 
derided as a poor programming choice. Tijuana, Mexico-based border blaster 
XETRA had been programming an English-language all-news format, as was 
Chicago station WNUS and, previously WAVA-FM in the Washington, D.C. area.[14][15][16] 
Locally, WABC-FM (now WPLJ) aired a news format for several weeks during 
the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike.[17] None of the other attempts 
was a major success, and as a result many in the radio industry predicted 
a quick demise for WINS. However, Westinghouse Broadcasting supported the 
format and WINS eventually prospered with it. Westinghouse made similar 
format changes at two other stations: KYW in Philadelphia, in September 
1965;[18] and KFWB in Los Angeles, in March 1968.[19] Together, WINS, KFWB 
and KYW served as the prototype all-news stations, and all three succeeded 
in attracting both listeners and advertising revenue over the years. CBS 
was the first broadcaster to make an attempt to mimic Westinghouse's all-news 
formula. Locally in New York, WINS' success as an all-news station spurred 
CBS to make a similar transformation with WCBS in August 1967,[20][21] 
though that station did not go full-time with all-news until 1970.[22] 
After completing the conversion of WCBS to all-news, five of CBS' other 
owned-and-operated AM stations also adopted the format. With this move, 
CBS-owned WCAU in Philadelphia and KNX in Los Angeles competed directly 
against KYW and KFWB, respectively, with varying results. In 1975, NBC 
Radio tried an all-news approach themselves with its News and Information 
Service network, but it was shut down in 1977 after only two years in operation. 
In the mid-1970s Westinghouse's second Chicago station, WIND, carried the 
format part-time while competing against CBS-owned, all-news WBBM. WIND 
was not successful, and Westinghouse tried again after selling WIND in 
1985 and acquiring WMAQ from NBC in 1988, converting WMAQ (now WSCR) into 
a full-time news outlet with mixed results. And in the summer of 2011, 
New York would have a third all-news station, and its first one on the 
FM dial, in WEMP FM News 101.9; in the wake of meager ratings, the format 
abruptly flipped back to the alternative rock format that had been on the 
frequency three years prior; later in 2012, Merlin Media, LLC sold the 
frequency to CBS Radio, which turned it into an FM simulcast of WFAN, making 
it a sister station to WINS as well as WCBS (AM). Today, the New York outlets 
co-exist with the format as CBS-owned sister stations. As of 2016[update], 
CBS Radio operates 9 of the largest all-news stations in the country—WINS, 
WCBS, WBBM, KNX, KYW, KCBS in San Francisco, WBZ in Boston, WWJ in Detroit, 
and KRLD in Dallas. 1 = Clear-channel stations with extended nighttime
