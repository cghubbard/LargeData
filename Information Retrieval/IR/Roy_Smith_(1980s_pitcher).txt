Le Roy Purdy Smith is a former professional baseball pitcher and executive. 
He played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball from 1984 
until 1991. He is currently a scout for the New York Mets. Smith was drafted 
in the 3rd round of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft by the Philadelphia 
Phillies. After three seasons in the Phillies' farm system, Smith and two 
other players, were traded to the Cleveland Indians late in the 1982 season 
for pitcher John Denny. After another season and a half in the minors, 
he made his major league debut on June 23, 1984, against the Seattle Mariners, 
a game in which he also picked up his first major league win. Smith split 
1985 between the major and minor leagues once again, then was traded in 
the following off-season to the Minnesota Twins in a four-player deal. 
He continued to shuttle between the majors and minors for three more seasons 
before finally making the majors to stay in 1989. He had his best season 
that year, going 10–6 with a 3.92 ERA. He would fall to 5–10 with an ERA 
nearly a run higher the following season, and was released. Smith pitched 
one more season in the majors for the Baltimore Orioles in 1991, but with 
even less success. He continued to pitch in the minors until 1993, when 
he finally retired.[1] After spending his final season with the Buffalo 
Bisons in the Pittsburgh Pirates system, the Pirates made him a scout in 
1994. He moved into the team's front office, serving as assistant general 
manager from 1999 until 2004, then moved on to the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
There, he worked as their Vice-President for Scouting and Player Development 
for two seasons, but left the organization along with his boss, Paul DePodesta, 
and returned to the Pirates.[2] He later worked as a scout for the Toronto
