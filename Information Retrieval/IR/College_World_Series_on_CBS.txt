From 1988-2002, CBS Sports televised a portion of the annual College World 
Series. From 1988-1990, CBS only televised the championship game. From 
1991 until the end of their coverage in 2002, CBS televised one game on 
the first Saturday of the World Series besides the championship game. Prior 
to 1988, the College World Series was a pure double-elimination event. 
Beginning in 1988, the tournament was divided into two four-team double-elimination 
brackets, with the survivors of each bracket playing in a single championship 
game. The single-game championship was made for broadcast television, with 
the final game on CBS on Saturday afternoon. In 2003, the tournament was 
shifted entirely to cable on ESPN, which had begun covering all of the 
other games of the CWS since 1982 (and a partial schedule since 1980). 
The championship final became a best-of-three series between the two bracket 
winners, with games scheduled for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evenings. 
In 2015, college baseball returned to CBS Sports in the form of a multi-year 
agreement between the American Athletic Conference and CBS Sports Network.[1] 
Under the terms of the package, CBS Sports Network would air three Houston 
Baseball games in 2015, as well as the first two contests of the 2015 American 
Athletic Conference Baseball Championship. Carter Blackburn provided play-by-play 
for all seven games of the package, while analyst duties would be handled
