Rex Edward Barney (December 19, 1924 – August 12, 1997) was a Major League 
Baseball pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943 and from 1946 through 
1950. As a teenage phenom, Barney was signed by the Dodgers at the age 
of 18, in 1943. He pitched 45 innings that year. Barney returned to the 
majors in 1946. He was one of the hardest throwers in the league but struggled 
with wildness early in his career. In 1948, however, he gained control 
of his fastball and had his greatest season; he won 15 games and finished 
second in the National League with 138 strikeouts. The highlight was hurling 
a no-hitter against the New York Giants on September 9. He had to sit through 
a one-hour rain delay and showers in the 7th, 8th, and 9th innings to finish 
the game. The next season, Barney pitched semi-effectively while suffering 
lingering effects from a leg injury suffered while sliding into second 
base. Barney appeared in 3 games in the 1947 World Series – starting and 
losing Game Five – against the New York Yankees. He got knocked out early 
in his 1949 World Series start, also against the New York Yankees, after 
just 2 2/3 innings. In 1950, he walked 48 batters in just 33 innings and 
never played in the majors again. He ended his career with a 35-31 record 
and a 4.31 earned run average. After his retirement as a player, Barney 
briefly worked as a broadcaster, calling games for Mutual radio in 1958. 
That same year he also teamed with Al Helfer to call several Philadelphia 
Phillies games on New York station WOR-TV, helping to fill that city's 
void of National League baseball following the departure of the Dodgers 
and Giants to the West Coast.[1] Barney also teamed with Ted Patterson 
in 1982 and 1983 to cablecast 16 Baltimore Orioles games per year on the 
SuperTV channel. Rex Barney was the PA announcer for the Baltimore Orioles 
from 1974 until his death in 1997. He was famous for often using the phrase 
"Give that fan a contract!" when a fan snared a foul ball on the fly. However, 
if the fan misplayed the ball, Barney would intone, "Give that fan... an 
error!" This was an expansion on the old radio and TV announcers' comment, 
"Sign him up!" He would also end every announcement with his signature 
"Thank youuuuu." Barney's famous "Thank youuuuu" were the last words to 
come over the PA system at Memorial Stadium after the Orioles' last game 
there on October 6, 1991. Barney was in the hospital at the time, and the 
message was recorded from there and played over the PA system to end the 
Orioles' tenancy. Barney co-authored (with Norman L. Macht) two books about 
his life in baseball, Rex Barney's Thank Youuuu for 50 Years of Baseball 
and Orioles Memories: 1969–1994. He had become famous as an announcer, 
but to the end of his life, Barney always regretted his failure to last 
as a major league pitcher: Believe me, there isn't a day that goes by that 
I don't think about what I could and should have been. It still hurts. 
–Barney in 1992 Rex Barney died on August 12, 1997. In tribute to him, 
the Orioles game that day was held without a public address announcer.[1]
