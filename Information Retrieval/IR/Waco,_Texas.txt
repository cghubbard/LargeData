Waco (/ˈweɪkoʊ/ WAY-koh) is a city which is the county seat of McLennan 
County, Texas, United States.[3] It is situated along the Brazos River 
and I-35, halfway between Dallas and Austin. The city had a 2010 population 
of 124,805, making it the 22nd-most populous city in the state.[4] The 
US Census 2015 population estimate is 132,356.[5] The Waco Metropolitan 
Statistical Area consists of McLennan and Falls Counties, which had a 2010 
population of 234,906.[6] Falls County was added to the Waco MSA in 2013. 
The US Census 2015 population estimate for the Waco MSA is 262,813.[7] 
Indigenous peoples occupied areas along the river for thousands of years. 
In historic times, the area of present-day Waco was occupied by the Wichita 
Native American tribe known as the "Waco" (Spanish: Hueco or Huaco). In 
1824, Thomas M. Duke explored the area and reported to Stephen F. Austin, 
describing the Waco village: "This town is situated on the West Bank of 
the River. They have a spring almost as cold as ice itself. All we want 
is some Brandy and Sugar to have Ice Toddy. They have about 400 acres (1.6 km2) 
planted in corn, beans, pumpkins, and melons and that tended in good order. 
I think they cannot raise more than One Hundred Warriors." After Austin 
halted the first attempt to destroy their village in 1825, he made a treaty 
with them. The Waco eventually moved out of the region, settling north 
near present-day Fort Worth. In 1872, they joined other Wichita tribes 
on a reservation in Oklahoma. In 1902, the Waco received allotments of 
land and became official US citizens. Neil McLennan settled in an area 
near the South Bosque River in 1838.[8] Jacob De Cordova bought McLennan's 
property[9] and hired a former Texas Ranger and surveyor named George B. 
Erath to inspect the area.[10] In 1849, Erath designed the first block 
of the city. Property owners wanted to name the city Lamartine, but Erath 
convinced them to name the area Waco Village, in honor of the Native Americans 
who had lived there.[11] In March 1849, Shapley Ross built the first house 
in Waco, a double-log cabin, on a bluff overlooking the springs. His daughter 
Kate was the first white child to be born in Waco.[12] In 1866, Waco's 
leading citizens embarked on an ambitious project to build the first bridge 
to span the wide Brazos River. They formed the Waco Bridge Company to build 
the 475-foot (145 m) brick Waco Suspension Bridge, which was completed 
in 1870. The company commissioned a firm owned by John Augustus Roebling 
in Trenton, New Jersey, to supply the cables and steelwork for the bridge, 
and contracted with Mr. Thomas M. Griffith, a civil engineer based in New 
York, for the supervisory engineering work on the bridge.[13] The economic 
effects of the Waco bridge were immediate and large. The cowboys and cattle-herds 
following the Chisholm Trail north, crossed the Brazos River at Waco. Some 
chose to pay the Suspension Bridge toll, while others floated their herds 
down the river. The population of Waco grew rapidly, as immigrants now 
had a safe crossing for their horse-drawn carriages and wagons. Since 1971, 
the bridge has been open only to pedestrian traffic and is in the National 
Register of Historic Places. In the late 19th century, a red-light district 
called the "Reservation" grew up in Waco, and prostitution was regulated 
by the city. The Reservation was suppressed in the early 20th century. 
In 1885, the soft drink Dr Pepper was invented in Waco at Morrison's Old 
Corner Drug Store. In 1845, Baylor University was founded in Independence, 
Texas, making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the state 
of Texas. It moved to Waco in 1886 and merged with Waco University, becoming 
an integral part of the city. The university's Strecker Museum was also 
the oldest continuously operating museum in the state until it closed in 
2003, and the collections were moved to the new Mayborn Museum Complex. 
In 1873, AddRan College was founded by brothers Addison and Randolph Clark 
in Fort Worth. The school moved to Waco in 1895, changing its name to Add-Ran 
Christian University and taking up residence in the empty buildings of 
Waco Female College. Add-Ran changed its name to Texas Christian University 
in 1902 and left Waco after the school's main building burned down in 1910. 
TCU was offered a 50-acre (200,000 m2) campus and $200,000 by the city 
of Fort Worth to relocate there. In the 1890s, William Cowper Brann published 
the highly successful Iconoclast newspaper in Waco. One of his targets 
was Baylor University. Brann revealed that Baylor officials had been importing 
South American children recruited by missionaries and making house-servants 
out of them. Brann was shot in the back by Tom Davis, a Baylor supporter. 
Brann then wheeled, drew his pistol, and killed Davis. Brann was helped 
home by his friends, and died there of his wounds. In 1894, the first Cotton 
Palace fair and exhibition center was built to reflect the dominant contribution 
of the agricultural cotton industry in the region. Since the end of the 
Civil War, cotton had been cultivated in the Brazos and Bosque valleys, 
and Waco had become known nationwide as a top producer. Over the next 23 
years, the annual exposition would welcome over eight million attendees. 
The opulent building which housed the month-long exhibition was destroyed 
by fire and rebuilt in 1910. In 1931, the exposition fell prey to the Great 
Depression, and the building was torn down. However, the annual Cotton 
Palace Pageant continues, hosted in late April in conjunction with the 
Brazos River Festival. On September 15, 1896, "The Crash" took place about 
15 miles (24 km) north of Waco. "The Crash at Crush" was a publicity stunt 
done by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad company (known as M-K-T or "Katy"), 
featuring two locomotives intentionally set to a head-on collision. Meant 
to be a family fun event with food, games, and entertainment, the Crash 
turned deadly when both boilers exploded simultaneously, sending metal 
flying in the air. Two people died and six were seriously injured. In 1916, 
an African American teenager named Jesse Washington was tortured, mutilated, 
and burned to death in the town square by a mob that seized him from the 
courthouse, where he had been convicted of murdering a white woman. About 
15,000 spectators, mostly citizens of Waco, were present. The commonly 
named Waco Horror drew international condemnation and became the cause 
célèbre of the nascent NAACP's antilynching campaign. In 2006, the Waco 
City Council officially condemned the lynching, which took place without 
opposition from local political or judicial leaders. In the 1920s, despite 
the popularity of the Ku Klux Klan and high numbers of lynchings throughout 
Texas, Waco's authorities attempted to respond to the NAACP's campaign 
and institute more protections for African Americans or others threatened 
with mob violence and lynching.[14] In 1923, Waco's Sheriff Leslie Stegall 
protected Roy Mitchell, an African American coerced into confessing to 
multiple murders, from mob lynching. Mitchell was the last Texan to be 
publicly executed in Texas, and also the last to be hanged before the introduction 
of the electric chair.[14] In the same year, the Texas Legislature created 
the Tenth Civil Court of Appeals and placed it in Waco; it is now known 
as the 10th Court of Appeals. In 1937, Grover C. Thomsen and R.H. Roark 
created a soft-drink called "Sun Tang Red Cream Soda". This would later 
become known as the soft drink Big Red. On May 5, 1942, Waco Army Air Field 
opened as a basic pilot training school, and on June 10, 1949, the name 
was changed to Connally Air Force Base in memory of Col. James T. Connally, 
a local pilot killed in Japan in 1945. The name changed again in 1951 to 
the James Connally Air Force Base. The base closed in May 1966 and is now 
the location of Texas State Technical College, formerly Texas State Technical 
Institute, since 1965. The airfield is still in operation, now known as 
TSTC Waco Airport, and was used by Air Force One when former US President 
George W. Bush visited his Prairie Chapel Ranch, also known as the Western 
White House, in Crawford, Texas. On May 11, 1953, a tornado hit downtown 
Waco, killing 114.[15] As of 2011, it remains the 11th-deadliest tornado 
in U.S. history and tied for the deadliest in Texas state history.[16] 
It was the first tornado tracked by radar and helped spur the creation 
of a nationwide storm surveillance system. A granite monument featuring 
the names of those killed was placed downtown in 2004.[17] In 1964, the 
Texas Department of Public Safety designated Waco as the site for the state-designated 
official museum of the legendary Texas Rangers law enforcement agency founded 
in 1823. In 1976, it was further designated the official Hall of Fame for 
the Rangers and renamed the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum. Renovations 
by the Waco government earned this building green status, the first Waco 
government-led project of its nature. The construction project has fallen 
under scrutiny for expanding the building over unmarked human graves. In 
1978, bones were discovered emerging from the mud at the confluence of 
the Brazos and Bosque Rivers. Subsequent excavations revealed that the 
bones were 68,000 years old and belonged to a species of mammoth. Eventually, 
the remains of at least 24 mammoths, one camel, and one large cat were 
found at the site, making it one of the largest findings of its kind. Scholars 
have puzzled over why such a large herd had been killed all at once. The 
site is currently being looked at by the National Park Service for possible 
inclusion into the National Park system. They are conducting a special 
resource study to be presented to Congress. The bones are currently on 
display at the Waco Mammoth National Monument, part of the National Park 
Service. On February 28, 1993, a shootout occurred in which six Branch 
Davidians and four agents of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms died. After 50 days, on April 19, 1993, a standoff between 
FBI agents and Branch Davidians ended in a fire that destroyed their compound, 
referred to as Mt. Carmel, near Waco. Seventy-four people, including leader 
David Koresh, died in the blaze. This event became known as the Waco siege. 
In 1999, a charter school called the Emma L. Harrison Charter School was 
closed by the Texas Education Agency; the school was the first school of 
its kind to have its charter revoked in Texas.[18] During the presidency 
of George W. Bush, Waco was the home to the White House Press Center. The 
press center provided briefing and office facilities for the press corps 
whenever Bush visited his "Western White House" Prairie Chapel Ranch near 
Crawford, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Waco. On May 17, 2015, a 
violent dispute among rival biker gangs broke out at Twin Peaks restaurant. 
The Waco police intervened, with nine dead and 18 injured in the incident. 
More than 170 were arrested.[19] No bystanders, Twin Peak employees, or 
officers were killed in the process. This was the most high-profile criminal 
incident since the aforementioned Waco siege, and the deadliest shootout 
in the city's history. Waco is located at 31°33'5" North, 97°9'21" West 
(31.551516, -97.155930).[20] According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 95.5 square miles (247 km2). 84.2 square miles 
(218 km2) of it is land and 11.3 square miles (29 km2) of it is covered 
by water. The total area is 11.85% water. Waco experiences a humid subtropical 
climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa), characterized by hot summers 
and generally mild winters. Some 90 °F (32 °C) temperatures have been observed 
in every month of the year. The record low temperature is −5 °F (−21 °C), 
set on January 31, 1949; the record high temperature is 112 °F (44 °C), 
set on August 11, 1969.[21] As of the census[1] of 2010, 124,805 people 
resided in the city, organized into 51,452 households and 27,115 families. 
The population density was recorded as 1,350.6 people per square mile (521.5/km2), 
with 45,819 housing units at an average density of 544.2 per square mile 
(210.1/km2). The 2000 racial makeup of the city was 60.78% White, 22.65% 
African American, 1.38% Asian, 0.51% Native American, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 
12.38% from other races, and 2.26% from two or more races. About 23.6% 
of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. Non-Hispanic Whites 
were 45.8% of the population in 2010,[25] down from 66.6% in 1980.[26] 
In 2000, the census recorded 42,279 households, of which 29.5% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 38.4% were married couples living 
together, 16.2% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.4% 
were not families. Around 31.1% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 10.9% had someone living alone at 65 years of age or older. The average 
household size was calculated as 2.49 and the average family size 3.19. 
In 2000, 25.4% of the population was under the age of 18, 20.3% from 18 
to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 16.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years 
of age or older. The median age is 28 years. For every 100 females, there 
are 91.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there are 87.3 males. 
The median income for a household in the city was $26,264, and for a family 
was $33,919. Males had a median income of $26,902 versus $21,159 for females. 
The per capita income for the city was $14,584. About 26.3% of the population 
and 19.3% of families lived below the poverty line. Of the total population, 
30.9% of those under the age of 18 and 13.0% of those 65 and older lived 
below the poverty line. Waco has a council-manager form of government. 
Citizens are represented on the City Council by six elected members; five 
from single-member districts and a mayor who is elected at-large.[27] The 
city offers a full line of city services typical of an American city this 
size, including: police, fire, Waco Transit buses, electric utilities, 
water and wastewater, solid waste, and the Waco Convention and Visitors 
Bureau. The Heart of Texas Council of Governments is headquartered in Waco 
on South New Road. This regional agency is a voluntary association of cities, 
counties, and special districts in the Central Texas area. The Texas Tenth 
Court of Appeals is located in the McLennan County Courthouse in Waco.[28] 
The Waco Fire Department operates 15 fire stations throughout the city.[29] 
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Waco Parole Office 
in Waco.[30] The United States Postal Service operates the Waco Main Post 
Office along Texas State Highway 6.[31] In addition, it operates other 
post offices throughout Waco. According to the Greater Waco Chamber of 
Commerce, the top employers in the city as of July 2015 are:[32] The town 
of Waco was built around the Waco Suspension Bridge, which was a crucial 
crossing of the Brazos River upon completion in 1870. Today, downtown Waco 
is relatively small when compared to other larger Texas cities, such as 
Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, or even Fort Worth, El Paso, or Austin. However, 
each day, nearly 20,000 people commute to and from work in downtown. It 
is also the location of the McLennan County Courthouse. In May 1953, the 
worst tornado in Texas history struck downtown Waco, killing 114 and injuring 
hundreds. It caused millions of dollars in damage and dented Waco's economy 
for years after. Downtown Waco is home to the ALICO Building, which was 
completed in 1910, and was once the tallest structure in the Southwest. 
Downtown Waco, where Dr Pepper soda was invented, is also the location 
of the famous Dr Pepper Museum. A scenic riverwalk along the east and west 
banks of the Brazos River stretches from the Baylor campus to Cameron Park 
Zoo, about seven miles in all. This multiuse walking and jogging, lighted 
trail passes underneath the Waco Suspension Bridge and captures the peaceful 
charm of the river.[33] Waco Independent School District serves most of 
the city of Waco. Portions of the city also lie in the boundaries of Midway 
Independent School District, Bosqueville ISD, China Spring ISD, Connally 
ISD, and La Vega ISD. Three large public high schools are in the Waco city 
limits: Waco High School (Waco ISD), University High School (Waco ISD), 
and Midway High School (Midway ISD). The schools are all rivals in sports, 
academics, and pride. Former high schools in Waco ISD were A.J. Moore High 
School, G.W. Carver High School, Richfield High School, Jefferson-Moore 
High School, and a magnet school known as A.J. Moore Academy. Charter high 
schools in Waco include Harmony Science Academy, Methodist Children's Home, 
Premier High School of Waco, Rapoport Academy Public School, and Waco Charter 
School (EOAC). Local private and parochial schools include Live Oak Classical 
School, Parkview Christian Academy, Reicher Catholic High School, Texas 
Christian Academy, and Vanguard College Preparatory School. The three institutions 
of higher learning in Waco are: In the past, several other higher education 
institutions were located in Waco:[34] The major daily newspaper is the 
Waco Tribune-Herald. Other publications include The Waco Citizen, The Anchor 
News, The Baylor Lariat, Tiempo, Wacoan, and Waco Today Magazine. The Waco 
television market (shared with the Killeen/Temple and Bryan/College Station 
areas) is the 89th-largest television market in the US and includes these 
stations:[35] The Waco radio market is the 200th-largest radio market in 
the US and includes: Interstate 35 is the major north-south highway for 
Waco. It directly connects the city with Dallas (I-35E), Fort Worth (I-35W), 
Austin, and San Antonio. Texas State Highway 6 runs northwest-southeast 
and connects Waco to Bryan/College Station and Houston. US Highway 84 is 
the major east-west thoroughfare in the area. It is also known as Waco 
Drive, Bellmead Drive (as it passes through the city of Bellmead), Woodway 
Drive or the George W. Bush Parkway. Loop 340 bypasses the city to the 
east and south. State Highway 31 splits off of US 84 just east of Waco 
and connects the city to Tyler, Longview, and Shreveport, Louisiana. The 
Waco area is home to three airports. Waco Regional Airport (ACT) serves 
the city with daily flights to Dallas/Fort Worth International via American 
Eagle. TSTC Waco Airport (CNW) is the site of the former James Connally 
AFB and was the primary fly-in point for former President George W. Bush 
when he was visiting his ranch in Crawford. It is also a hub airport for 
L3 and several other aviation companies. McGregor Executive Airport (PWG) 
is a general-aviation facility located west of Waco. Local transportation 
is provided by the Waco Transit System, which offers bus service Monday-Saturday 
to most of the city. Multiple taxicab companies operate in the city. Nearby 
passenger train service is offered via Amtrak. The Texas Eagle route includes 
daily stops in McGregor, located 20 miles west of the city. Major Waco 
attractions include: The American Basketball Association had a franchise 
for part of the 2006 season, the Waco Wranglers. The team played at Reicher 
Catholic High School and practiced at Texas State Technical College. Previous 
professional sports franchises in Waco have proven unsuccessful. The Waco 
Marshals of the National Indoor Football League lasted less than two months 
amidst a midseason ownership change in 2004. (The team became the beleaguered 
Cincinnati Marshals the following year.) The Waco Wizards of the now-defunct 
Western Professional Hockey League fared better, lasting into a fourth 
season before folding in 2000. Both teams played at the Heart O' Texas 
Coliseum, one of Waco's largest entertainment and sports venues. The Southern 
Indoor Football League announced that Waco was an expansion market for 
the 2010 season. It was rumored that they would play in the Heart O' Texas 
Coliseum. However, the league broke up into three separate leagues, and 
subsequently a team did not come to Waco in any of the new leagues. Professional 
baseball first came to Waco in 1889 with the formation of the Waco Tigers, 
a member of the Texas League. The Tigers were renamed the Navigators in 
1905, and later the Steers. In 1920, the team was sold to Wichita Falls. 
In 1923, a new franchise called the Indians was formed and became a member 
of the Class D Texas Association. In 1925, Waco rejoined the Texas League 
with the formation of the Waco Cubs. On June 20, 1930, the first night 
game in Texas League history was played at Katy Park in Waco. The lights 
were donated by Waco resident Charles Redding Turner, who owned a local 
farm team for recruits to the Chicago Cubs. On the night of August 6, 1930, 
baseball history was made at Katy Park: in the eighth inning of a night 
game against Beaumont, Waco left fielder Gene Rye became the only player 
in the history of professional baseball to hit three home runs in one inning. 
The last year Waco had a team in the Texas League was 1930, but fielded 
some strong semipro teams in the 1930s and early 1940s. During the World 
War II years of 1943–45, the powerful Waco Army Air Field team was probably 
the best in the state; many major leaguers played for the team, and it 
was managed by big-league catcher Birdie Tebbetts. In 1947, the Class B 
Big State League was organized with Waco as a member called the Waco Dons. 
In 1948, A.H. Kirksey, owner of Katy Park, persuaded the Pittsburgh Pirates 
club to take over the Waco operation, and the nickname was changed to Pirates. 
The Pirates vaulted into third place in 1948. They dropped a notch to fourth 
in 1949, but prevailed in the playoffs to win the league championship. 
The Pirates then tumbled into the second division, bottoming out with a 
dreadful 29-118, 0.197 club in 1952. This mark ranks as one of the 10 worst 
marks of any 20th-century full-season team. When the tornado struck in 
1953, it destroyed the park. The team relocated to Longview to finish the
