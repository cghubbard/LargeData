Arnold Ray McBride (born February 3, 1949), nicknamed "Shake 'n Bake" and 
"The Callaway Kid", is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder. 
Between 1973 and 1983, he played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia 
Phillies and Cleveland Indians. He had the most success with Philadelphia 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s. After attending Fulton High School and 
Westminster College in Missouri, McBride debuted for the Cardinals in 1973. 
He was the 1974 National League Rookie of the Year, and he was a 1976 MLB 
All-Star Game selection. He was a member of the world champion 1980 Phillies 
team, and he hit a three-run home run in the first game of that year's 
World Series. Though McBride ran with impressive speed, more than half 
of his 11 MLB seasons were significantly shortened due to injury or illness. 
He had surgeries on both of his knees during his playing career, and he 
missed almost all of the 1982 season with an eye infection related to his 
use of contact lenses. After his playing career ended, McBride was a minor 
league coach for the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals. McBride 
was born in Fulton, Missouri, to Arnold McBride and Wanna Robinson McBride. 
The elder Arnold McBride had been a pitcher for the Negro league baseball 
team known as the Kansas City Monarchs. Bake McBride starred in football 
at Fulton High School, earning all-state honors, and he also played basketball 
and ran track.[1] Fulton High School did not offer a baseball program.[2] 
McBride attended Westminster College in Missouri, where he was a baseball, 
basketball, and track athlete. He set the school record in the 200-meter 
dash.[3] McBride pitched in college, but when he attended a tryout session 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, personnel at the tryout were not interested 
in McBride's pitching. They thought his running ability held promise.[4] 
McBride was selected by the Cardinals in the 37th round of the 1970 MLB 
draft.[5] Though McBride left college early to enter professional baseball, 
he later graduated from Westminster.[3] By 1972, McBride had made his way 
through the minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA affiliate in Little 
Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the 
Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially hesitant to report there, wondering 
whether he was ready for Class AAA baseball.[6] In his first at bat at 
the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed 
to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second 
base.[7] McBride made his major league debut for the Cardinals in 1973, 
but he retained his rookie status after only appearing in 40 games that 
year.[8] He became known for a distinctive appearance, as he wore one of 
the largest Afro hairstyles in the major leagues. When he stepped to home 
plate to bat, McBride made a ritual of wiping away the chalk lines that 
made up the batter's box.[9] He used an unconventional batting stance, 
placing his weight on his front foot rather than on his back foot.[10] 
Late in the 1974 season, McBride scored the winning run in a 25-inning 
game. He hit an infield single, and then he scored from first base when 
pitcher Hank Webb's pickoff attempt went into right field and the catcher 
made an error while receiving the throw to home plate. At the time, the 
game was the second longest in MLB history at seven hours and four minutes.[11] 
He finished the 1974 season with 173 base hits, 30 stolen bases, and a 
.309 batting average, and was named the National League's Rookie of the 
Year.[8] He was the first Cardinal to earn the award since Bill Virdon 
in 1955.[12] As a young Cardinals player, McBride said that he learned 
a great deal from the influence of teammate Lou Brock. McBride felt that 
Brock should have won the 1974 Most Valuable Player Award. Brock stole 
118 bases that year, which broke the single-season league record. When 
combined with McBride's 30 steals, the total set a single-season MLB record 
for stolen bases by two teammates. Other than Brock and McBride, no St. 
Louis Cardinal had stolen 30 bases in a season since 1927. The 1974 Cardinals 
outfielders (McBride, Brock and Reggie Smith) all hit over .300, the first 
time since 1902 that the team's three starting outfielders all achieved 
that mark.[13] In 1975, McBride moved from the fifth spot to the third 
spot in the Cardinals' batting order.[14] He suffered an early-season shoulder 
injury that caused him to miss almost a month of the season. He returned, 
but injured both ankles in the summer; his left ankle was hurt on a slide 
into a catcher's shin guard, and a few days later he fouled a pitch off 
of his right ankle during batting practice. By early August, McBride was 
hitting only .255 and he had 14 stolen bases on the season, a slower pace 
than the year before.[15] McBride, then known as "The Callaway Kid" after 
the name of his home county, completed a conditioning program in the offseason 
to strengthen his slender physique, gaining ten pounds before the 1976 
season and starting strong in April.[16] McBride was selected as the only 
representative from the Cardinals in the 1976 MLB All-Star Game.[17] He 
struggled with shoulder and knee injuries that year. In August, he was 
taken out of the lineup and the team announced that he would undergo season-ending 
surgery to repair cartilage in his knee. He had a .335 batting average 
when he was sidelined by the injury.[18] Before the 1977 season, the Cardinals 
hired Vern Rapp as the team's new manager. Rapp was known as a disciplinarian 
and he prohibited the players from having facial hair, which caused conflict 
with McBride and with teammate Al Hrabosky.[19] In late May 1977, the Cardinals 
signed McBride to a three-year contract.[20] About three weeks after McBride 
signed his new contract, McBride and Steve Waterbury were traded to the 
Philadelphia Phillies for Tom Underwood, Dane Iorg, and Rick Bosetti.[21] 
Broadcaster Jack Buck said that Rapp undoubtedly forced McBride's trade 
to the Phillies.[19] McBride surged to a .338 batting average during his 
time with the 1977 Phillies. The team went 69-33 after acquiring McBride 
and they made the playoffs.[22] McBride had previously played center field, 
but since Garry Maddox occupied that position in Philadelphia, McBride 
moved to right field.[4] He was well-liked by Phillies fans, and they nicknamed 
him "Shake 'n Bake".[21] McBride hit for his lowest career batting average 
in 1978 (.269), and he played in only 122 games, partly because of injuries 
and partly because manager Danny Ozark employed a platoon system.[23] Before 
the 1979 season, McBride became the subject of trade rumors. If the Phillies 
had been unable to sign him to an extension, they would have lost him to 
free agency after that year. General manager Paul Owens said that he would 
trade McBride if they could not negotiate a contract extension.[24] In 
December 1979, he was nearly traded to the Texas Rangers in exchange for 
relief pitcher Sparky Lyle, but Phillies owner Ruly Carpenter nixed the 
trade proposal. McBride re-signed with the Phillies.[25] Despite pain in 
his feet and knees during the 1980 season, McBride was characterized by 
manager Dallas Green as the most consistent player on the team.[25] The 
Phillies went to the 1980 World Series, and in the first game, McBride's 
three-run home run put the Phillies ahead of the Kansas City Royals. The 
Phillies won the game and won the World Series in six games.[8][26] McBride 
hit .304 (7 hits in 23 at bats) in his only career World Series.[8] During 
the strike-shortened 1981 season, McBride missed most of May because of 
knee problems.[27] He underwent arthroscopy on his left knee just before 
the strike. He had surgery on his right knee in November.[28] On February 
16, 1982, McBride was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Sid Monge. McBride 
said that he would have to become accustomed to pitchers in the American 
League, but he thought that the grass field in Cleveland would provide 
a more favorable playing surface for his surgically repaired knees than 
the artificial turf in Philadelphia.[29] The trade to Cleveland made McBride 
an unwitting participant in controversy. Because Monge had refused a smaller 
contract offer from the Phillies when he was a free agent before the season, 
Marvin Miller of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) 
criticized the trade as an example of collusive efforts between baseball 
owners to sidestep the rules surrounding free agency. Compensation for 
free agents had been a contentious issue in labor negotiations between 
owners and the MLBPA.[30] McBride began the year as the starting right 
fielder for the Indians, but he suffered an eye infection and did not play 
after May 21.[31] He had started the season hitting .365 in 27 games.[8] 
McBride said that the eye infection was related to his contact lenses and 
he thought that his recovery had been delayed by trying to wear other types 
of contacts.[32] He said that he had worn hard contact lenses since 1970, 
and that he had damaged his corneas by wearing contacts all of the time. 
McBride said that his corneal issue was such that he was unable to switch 
from contact lenses to glasses while his eyes healed.[33] Just before the 
1983 season, McBride said that he had not had eye problems since January, 
when he began wearing contact lenses made for him by doctors in Boston.[32] 
He played in 70 games in the 1983 season, twice ending up on the disabled 
list. He filed for free agency in October 1983.[34] After his playing career, 
McBride retired to Florissant, Missouri, where he briefly owned a liquor 
store. He was enjoying the time he could spend with his family, but the 
New York Mets called him with a coaching opportunity.[10] In 1985, the 
organization hired McBride as an outfield and baserunning coach for their 
minor league system.[35] He stayed with the organization for seven years.[10] 
In the 1990s, McBride was a minor league hitting coach for the Cardinals.[36] 
McBride married the former Celeste Woodley.[37] The couple had three children.[10] 
By 1976, McBride had opened a youth center in Fulton. He lived in St. Louis 
during the baseball offseasons.[38] His cousin, Ron McBride, played college 
football at the University of Missouri and then appeared in the National 
Football League.[37] Early in his career, McBride said that he could not
