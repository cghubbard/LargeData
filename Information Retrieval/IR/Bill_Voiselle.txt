William Symmes (Bill) Voiselle (January 29, 1919 – January 31, 2005) was 
a starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1942 through 1950, Voiselle 
played for the New York Giants (1942–47), Boston Braves (1947–49) and Chicago 
Cubs (1950). He batted and threw right-handed. While born in Greenwood, 
South Carolina, Voiselle grew up in the nearby town of Ninety Six. He received 
special permission from the National League to wear the number 96 on his 
jersey as a way to honor his hometown. At the time, this was the highest 
number ever worn in major league baseball. Voiselle debuted with the Giants 
in 1942 and reached the big leagues full-time in 1944. Nicknamed "Big Bill", 
in his rookie season, he led the NL in innings pitched and strikeouts, 
and finished third with a career-high 21 wins. He made his only All-Star 
appearance that season and finished fifth in MVP voting. To top it off, 
The Sporting News named him the National League Pitcher of the Year in 
the first season of the award. Voiselle suffered a minor sophomore jinx 
in 1945, winning 14 but with a high 4.49 ERA. After many prominent major 
leaguers returned from World War II, his role with the Giants was reduced. 
He also was on the end of a $500 fine from Giants manager Mel Ott for allowing 
St. Louis Cardinals batter Johnny Hopp to get a hit on an 0-2 count during 
a June 1 game at Sportsman's Park.[1] Voiselle was eventually traded to 
the Boston Braves for another wartime star, Mort Cooper, in the 1947 midseason. 
In 1948, Voiselle won 13 games for the Braves Champions Team as the third 
starter behind Warren Spahn and Johnny Sain. In the World Series against 
the Cleveland Indians, Voiselle came into Game 3 as a relief pitcher and 
he got the start in Game 6, taking the loss, 4–3. Most concede that Voiselle 
and the Braves out-pitched and out-hit the Indians, but the team was eliminated 
4–2. Voiselle pitched 10.2 innings in the Series and surrendered three 
earned runs for a 2.53 ERA. After that, he pitched one more season with 
the Braves, winning just seven games, before being traded before the 1950 
season to the Chicago Cubs for infielder Gene Mauch. Voiselle only spent 
a half a season with the Cubs, during which he failed to record a victory 
in 19 appearances (seven starts). It would end up being his last year in 
the majors, though he continued pitching for a significant number of minor 
league clubs. In a nine-season career, Voiselle posted a 74–84 record with 
645 strikeouts and a 3.83 ERA in 1373.1 innings. Voiselle died in Greenwood,
