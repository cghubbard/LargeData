Christopher Lee Heston (born April 10, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). On June 9, 2015, he threw the 17th no-hitter in Giants franchise 
history. He played college baseball at East Carolina. Heston graduated 
from Bayside High School in Palm Bay, Florida.[1] He played college baseball 
for two years at Seminole Community College. He was drafted by the Minnesota 
Twins in the 47th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft but did 
not sign with the team.[2] In 2008 the Washington Nationals drafted Heston 
in the 29th round, but he again did not sign and attended East Carolina 
University.[2] He was then drafted a third time, by the San Francisco Giants 
in the 12th round in 2009, and signed.[2] Heston's professional career 
got off to a rocky start with a 1–5 record and 4.11 ERA in the rookie Arizona 
League in 2009. In 2010, he finished 5–13 with a 3.75 ERA with the Single-A 
Augusta GreenJackets. With the Class A-Advanced San Jose Giants in 2011, 
he improved to 12–4 with a 3.16 ERA and 131 strikeouts. With the Double-A 
Richmond Flying Squirrels in 2012, he finished 9–8 with a 2.24 ERA, the 
second-lowest ERA in Flying Squirrels' franchise history.[2][3] He earned 
a spot in the Eastern League All-Star Game and was named Eastern League 
Pitcher of the Year.[2][3] Heston was added to the Giants' 40-man roster 
on November 20, 2012.[4] He was optioned to AAA Fresno on March 2, 2013, 
and struggled to a 7–6 record and 5.80 ERA. He was designated for assignment 
on July 13 to clear a roster spot for Jeff Francoeur and released on July 
21.[5] He was re-signed by the Giants to a minor league contract on July 
24.[6][7] In 2014, Heston improved to 12–9 with a 3.38 ERA in Fresno and 
was re-added to the 40-man roster in September 2014.[8] Heston made his 
Major League debut with the San Francisco Giants on September 13, 2014, 
in the ninth inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers where he pitched a 
scoreless inning. He eventually appeared in three games, including one 
start, and pitched five and one-third innings with a 5.06 ERA. The Giants 
clinched a wild card spot with an 88–74 record and eventually won the 2014 
World Series, their third championship in five seasons. Heston did not 
participate in any postseason activity but received his first championship 
ring for his regular season contributions.[9] Heston was slated to start 
the 2015 season in AAA Sacramento, but was called up on April 7 to replace 
the injured Matt Cain.[10] He got his first MLB win in his second start 
for the Giants on April 8, 2015, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks 5–2 
and throwing 6 innings. Heston gave up two runs, neither earned, but had 
five strikeouts gaining the win.[11] On May 12, 2015, Heston pitched a 
complete game against the Houston Astros, allowing only two hits and one 
run, with 10 strikeouts and no walks.[12][13] Heston was the first Giants 
rookie to throw a complete game with at least 10 strikeouts since Roger 
Mason on October 4, 1985, and the first Giants rookie with double-digit 
strikeouts since Tim Lincecum on July 1, 2007.[12] On June 9, 2015, Heston 
no-hit the New York Mets 5–0 at Citi Field, becoming the 22nd rookie pitcher 
since 1900 to throw a no-hitter in a major-league regular-season game. 
He struck out 11 and walked none; the only 3 runners to reach base were 
hit by a pitch.[14] Heston closed his no-hitter with three strikeouts in 
the 9th inning, a feat last accomplished by Sandy Koufax in his perfect 
game in 1965 against the Chicago Cubs.[15][16] He also became the first 
pitcher to no-hit the Mets in a Mets' home game since Pittsburgh's Bob 
Moose no-hit them at Shea Stadium in 1969. Heston's three hit by pitch 
batters in his no-hitter were the most since 1914, and has Heston as the 
fourth MLB pitcher since 1914 to have all of his base runners in his no-hitters 
be batters hit by a pitch.[17] In the same game, Heston logged his first 
career RBIs with a two-run single.[14] For his efforts, Heston was honored 
his first career National League Player of the Week Award as well as the 
key to the city by the mayor of Palm Bay, Florida.[18] On July 23, 2015, 
Heston carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the San Diego 
Padres, ultimately allowing only one hit and no runs in 7 1⁄3 innings pitched. 
The 9–3 victory over the Padres was Heston's 10th win, making him the first 
Giants rookie to reach 10 wins since Matt Cain in 2006.[19] Heston was 
optioned to Triple-A Sacramento on August 21st, 2015 to make room for recently 
acquired outfielder Marlon Byrd. Later on August 28, 2015 he was recalled 
from Triple-A Sacramento since Matt Cain was placed on the disabled list.
