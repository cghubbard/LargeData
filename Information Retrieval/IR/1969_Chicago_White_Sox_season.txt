The 1969 Chicago White Sox season was the team's 69th season in the major 
leagues, and its 70th season overall. They finished with a record 68–94, 
good enough for fifth place in the newly established American League West, 
29 games behind the first-place Minnesota Twins. The White Sox nearly left 
Chicago in 1969. White Sox owner Arthur Allyn, Jr. considered overtures 
from Bud Selig and other Milwaukee interests to move the club to County 
Stadium.[1] Instead, he sold to his brother, John. The newly established 
Seattle Pilots would move there a year after their inaugural season. [1]

in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other 
franchise in the American League at the time). Although those games were 
attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) 
they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance 
than the previous year – over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home 
games in 1969 did so at Milwaukee County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home 
dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335, for an average of 6,632 per game). 
Bud Selig felt this fan support lent legitimacy to his quest for a Milwaukee 
franchise, and he went into the 1969 owners meetings with high hopes.[citation
