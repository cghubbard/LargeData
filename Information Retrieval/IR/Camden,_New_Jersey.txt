Camden is a city in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. The county 
seat,[22][23] it is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
At the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 77,344,[10][12][13] 
representing a decline of 2,560 (3.2%) from the 79,904 residents enumerated 
during the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 7,588 (8.7%) from 
the 87,492 counted in the 1990 Census.[24] Camden ranked as the 12th-most 
populous municipality in the state in 2010 after having been ranked 10th 
in 2000.[11] Camden was incorporated as a city on February 13, 1828, from 
portions of the now-defunct Newton Township, while the area was still part 
of Gloucester County. On March 13, 1844, Camden became part of the newly 
formed Camden County.[25] The city derives its name from Charles Pratt, 
1st Earl Camden.[26][27] Three of Camden's mayors have been jailed for 
corruption, the most recent being Milton Milan in 2000.[28] From 2005 to 
2012, the school system and police department were operated by the state 
of New Jersey.[29][30][31][32] 40% of residents are below the national 
poverty line.[33] Camden had the highest crime rate in the United States 
in 2012, with 2,566 violent crimes for every 100,000 people,[34] 6.6 times 
higher than the national average of 387 violent crimes per 100,000 citizens.[35] 
Fort Nassau (within the present boundaries of nearby Gloucester City, New 
Jersey), was built by the Dutch West India Company in 1626, and was the 
first European attempt to settle the area now occupied by Camden. Initial 
European activity in the vicinity of present-day Camden occurred along 
the banks of the Delaware River where the Dutch and the Swedish vied for 
control of the local fur trade. Europeans continued to settle in and improve 
the area throughout the 17th century. Much of the growth directly resulted 
from the success of another Quaker colony across the Delaware River known 
as Philadelphia, which was founded in 1682 and soon had enough population 
to attract a brisk trade from West Jersey and Camden. To accommodate the 
trade across the river, a string of ferries began operation.[36] For over 
150 years, Camden served as a secondary economic and transportation hub 
for the Philadelphia area. But that status began to change in the early 
19th century. One of the U.S.'s first railroads, the Camden and Amboy Railroad, 
was chartered in Camden in 1830. The Camden and Amboy Railroad allowed 
travelers to travel between New York City and Philadelphia via ferry terminals 
in South Amboy, New Jersey and Camden. The railroad terminated on the Camden 
waterfront, and passengers were ferried across the Delaware River to their 
final Philadelphia destination. The Camden and Amboy Railroad opened in 
1834 and helped to spur an increase in population and commerce in Camden.[37] 
Horse ferries, or team boats served Camden in the early 1800s. They stopped 
for an hour at lunch time to feed the horses.[38] The Ridgeway was a double 
team boat, propelled by nine horses walking around a circle. She ran from 
the foot of Cooper Street. There was also a team boat named the Washington; 
she ran from Market Street, Camden, to Market Street, Philadelphia. Other 
team boats followed in succession, namely the Phoenix, Constitution, Moses 
Lancaster, and Independence.[39] The Cooper's Ferry Daybook, 1819–1824, 
documenting Camden's Point Pleasant Teamboat, survives to this day.[40] 
Originally a suburban town with ferry service to Philadelphia, Camden evolved 
into its own city, as industry and neighborhoods grew. Like other industrial 
towns, Camden prospered during strong periods of manufacturing demand and 
faced distress during periods of economic dislocation.[41] Like most American 
cities, Camden suffered from decline in the 20th century as the manufacturing 
base and many residents moved out to other locations. Currently, government, 
education, and health care are the three biggest employers in Camden; however, 
most employees commute to Camden and live in nearby suburbs such as Cherry 
Hill. Revitalization has occurred along the Camden Waterfront and in the 
neighborhoods of Cooper Grant, Cramer Hill, and Fairview, with direct access 
to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From 1901 through 1929, Camden was headquarters 
of the Victor Talking Machine Company, and thereafter to its successor 
RCA Victor, the world's largest manufacturer of phonographs and phonograph 
records for the first two-thirds of the 20th century.[42] Victor contained 
some of the first commercial recording studios in the United States, where 
Enrico Caruso, among others, recorded. General Electric reacquired RCA 
and the Camden factory in 1986.[43] In 1992, the state of New Jersey under 
the Florio administration made an agreement with GE to ensure that GE would 
not close the Camden site. The state of New Jersey would build a new high-tech 
facility on the site of the old Campbell Soup Company factory and trade 
these new buildings to GE for the existing old RCA Victor buildings. Later, 
the new high tech buildings would be sold to Martin Marietta. In 1994, 
Martin Marietta merged with Lockheed to become Lockheed Martin. In 1997, 
Lockheed Martin divested the Camden Plant as part of the birth of L-3 Communications.[44] 
The "Nipper Building" depicting RCA Victor's famous "His Master's Voice" 
trademark in its tower windows has since been renovated into a luxury apartment 
building called "The Victor". Building 8 is set to be rehabilitated into 
luxury condominiums called "Radio Lofts". Both projects are the work of 
Dranoff Properties, a Philadelphia development corporation that has specialized 
in these types of constructions.[45] Another older building, Victor Building 
No. 2, is used to this day to house the Camden City Board of Education. 
Most of the other RCA Victor buildings have long since been demolished. 
From 1899 to 1967, Camden was the home of New York Shipbuilding Corporation, 
which at its World War II peak was the largest and most productive shipyard 
in the world.[46] Notable naval vessels built at New York Ship include 
the ill-fated cruiser USS Indianapolis and the aircraft carrier USS Kitty 
Hawk. In 1962, the first commercial nuclear-powered ship, the NS Savannah, 
was launched in Camden.[47] The Fairview Village section of Camden (initially 
Yorkship Village) is a planned European-style garden village that was built 
by the Federal government during World War I to house New York Shipbuilding 
Corporation workers.[48] At Camden's peak, 12,000 workers were employed 
at RCA,[49] while another 30,000 worked at New York Shipbuilding.[50] RCA 
had 23 out of 25 of its factories inside Camden. Campbell Soup was also 
a major employer.[51] By 1969, Camden had been losing jobs and residents 
for a quarter century due in large part to urban decay, highway construction, 
and racial tensions.[52] In his book Capital Moves: RCA's Seventy-Year 
Quest for Cheap Labor, Jefferson Cowie mentions that Camden in the 1920s 
was known as "the Citadel of Republicanism".[53] On June 6, 1933, the city 
hosted the first drive-in movie.[54][55] After years of economic and industrial 
growth, the city of Camden faced years of rising crime and blight. On September 
6, 1949, mass murderer Howard Unruh went on a killing spree in his Camden 
neighborhood killing thirteen people. Unruh, who was convicted and subsequently 
confined to a state psychiatric facility, died on October 19, 2009.[56] 
Rutgers University absorbed the former College of South Jersey to create 
Rutgers University–Camden in 1950.[57] Sections of downtown were looted 
and torched after racial riots occurred following the beating and death 
of a Puerto Rican motorist by city police in August 1971.[58] The Camden 
28 were a group of anti-Vietnam War activists who, in 1971, planned and 
executed a raid on the Camden draft board, resulting in a high-profile 
trial against the activists that was seen by many as a referendum on the 
Vietnam War in which 17 of the defendants were acquitted by a jury even 
though they admitted having participated in the break-in.[59] In 1996, 
Governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman frisked Sherron Rolax, a 
16-year-old African-American youth, an event which was captured in an infamous 
photograph. Rolax alleged his civil rights were violated and sued the state 
of New Jersey.[60] In 1999, Camden was selected as the location for the 
USS New Jersey (BB-62).[61] That ship remains in Camden. In response to 
the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, various strip 
clubs, hotels, and other businesses along Admiral Wilson Boulevard were 
torn down in 1999, and a park that once existed along the road was replenished.[62] 
In 2004, conversion of the RCA Nipper Building to The Victor, an upscale 
apartment building was completed.[63] The same year, the River LINE, between 
the Entertainment Center at the Waterfront in Camden and the Transit Center 
in Trenton, was opened, with a stop directly across from the RCA Nipper 
Building. The same year, Cooper University Hospital began a large scale 
expansion in an attempt to create a regional health center in Camden. The 
main building is a block away from the Walter Rand Transportation Center. 
In 2010, massive police corruption was exposed that resulted in the convictions 
of several policemen, dismissals of 185 criminal cases, and lawsuit settlements 
totaling $3.5 million that were paid to 88 victims.[64][65][66] The Chief 
of the Camden County Police Department is John Scott Thomson.[67][68] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 10.341 
square miles (26.784 km2), including 8.921 square miles (23.106 km2) of 
land and 1.420 square miles (3.677 km2) of water (13.73%).[2][3] Camden 
borders Collingswood, Gloucester City, Haddon Township, Pennsauken Township 
and Woodlynne in Camden County, as well as Philadelphia across the Delaware 
River in Pennsylvania.[69] Just offshore of Camden is Pettys Island, which 
is part of Pennsauken Township. Camden contains the United States' first 
federally funded planned community for working class residents, Yorkship 
Village (now called Fairview).[70] The village was designed by Electus 
Darwin Litchfield, who was influenced by the "garden city" developments 
popular in England at the time.[71] Camden has more than 20 generally recognized 
neighborhoods:[72][73][74][75] On the Delaware River, with access to the 
Atlantic Ocean, the Port of Camden handles break bulk and bulk cargo. The 
port consists of two terminals: the Beckett Street Terminal and the Broadway 
Terminal. The port receives hundreds of ships moving international and 
domestic cargo annually.[76] In 2005, the Port of Camden (South Jersey 
Port Corporation) was subject to an unresolved criminal investigation[77] 
and a state audit.[78] Some activities in the port are under the jurisdiction 
of the Delaware River Port Authority. Camden has a humid subtropical climate 
(Cfa in the Koeppen climate classification). As of 2006, 52% of the city's 
residents lived in poverty, one of the highest rates in the nation.[95] 
The city had a median household income of $18,007, the lowest of all U.S. 
communities with populations of more than 65,000 residents, making it America's 
poorest city.[96] A group of poor Camden residents were the subject of 
a 20/20 special on poverty in America broadcast on January 26, 2007, in 
which Diane Sawyer profiled the lives of three young children growing up 
in Camden.[97] A follow-up was shown on November 9, 2007.[98] In 2011, 
Camden's unemployment rate was 19.6%, compared with 10.6% in Camden County 
as a whole.[99] As of 2009, the unemployment rate in Camden was 19.2%, 
compared to the 10% overall unemployment rate for Burlington, Camden and 
Gloucester counties and a rate of 8.4% in Philadelphia and the four surrounding 
counties in Southeastern Pennsylvania.[100] At the 2010 United States Census, 
there were 77,344 people, 24,475 households, and 16,912 families residing 
in the city. The population density was 8,669.6 per square mile (3,347.4/km2). 
There were 28,358 housing units at an average density of 3,178.7 per square

of any race were 47.04% (36,379) of the population.[10] The Hispanic population 
of 36,379 was the tenth-highest of any municipality in New Jersey and the 
proportion of 47.0% was the state's 16th-highest percentage.[101][102] 
The Puerto Rican population was 30.7%.[10] There were 24,475 households, 
of which 37.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 22.3%

3% other. Camden is predominately populated by African Americans and Puerto 
Ricans.[10] The Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed 
that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $27,027 
(with a margin of error of +/- $912) and the median family income was $29,118 
(+/- $1,296). Males had a median income of $27,987 (+/- $1,840) versus

In the 2000 Census, 30.85% of Camden residents identified themselves as 
being of Puerto Rican heritage. This was the third-highest proportion of 
Puerto Ricans in a municipality on the United States mainland, behind only 
Holyoke, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, for all communities in 
which 1,000 or more people listed an ancestry group.[104] About 45% of 
employment in Camden is in the "eds and meds" sector, providing educational 
and medical institutions.[105] Portions of Camden are part of an Urban 
Enterprise Zone. In addition to other benefits to encourage employment 
within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3½% sales tax 
rate (versus the 7% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.[106] 
Campbell Soup Company has decided to go forward with a scaled down redevelopment 
of the area around its corporate headquarters in Camden, including an expanded 
corporate headquarters.[107] In June 2012, Campbell Soup Company acquired 
the 4-acre (1.6 ha) site of the vacant Sears building located near its 
corporate offices, where the company plans to construct the Gateway Office 
Park, and razed the Sears building after receiving approval from the city 
government and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.[108] 
In 2013, Cherokee Investment Partners had a plan to redevelop north Camden 
with 5,000 new homes and a shopping center on 450 acres (1.8 km2). Cherokee 
dropped their plans in the face of local opposition and the slumping real 
estate market.[109][110][111] In 2014, Lockheed Martin, Holt Logistics, 
Subaru of America, WebiMax, Holtec International and the Philadelphia 76ers 
announced plans to open facilities in the city.[112][113][114] [115][116] 
They are among several companies receiving New Jersey Economic Development 
Authority (EDA) tax incentives to relocate jobs in the city.[117][118] 
Camden has historically been a stronghold of the Democratic Party. Voter 
turnout is very low; approximately 19% of Camden's voting age population 
participated in the 2005 gubernatorial election.[119] Since July 1, 1961, 
the city has operated within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional 
Municipal Charter Law, under a Mayor-Council form of government.[8] Under 
this form of government, the City Council consisted of seven Council members 
originally all elected at-large. In 1994, the City divided the city into 
four council districts, instead of electing the entire Council at-large, 
with a single council member elected from each of the four districts. In 
1995, the elections were changed from a partisan vote to a non-partisan 
system.[120] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Camden is Democrat Dana Redd, 
who was re-elected to a second term in office in 2013 and whose current 
term ends December 31, 2017.[4] Members of the City Council are Council 
President Francisco "Frank" Moran (2015; Ward 3), Vice President Curtis 
Jenkins (D, 2017; at large), Dana M. Burley (2015; Ward 1), Brian K. Coleman 
(2015; Ward 2), Angel Fuentes (D, 2017; at large - appointed to serve an 
unexpired term), Luis A. Lopez (2015; Ward 4) and Marilyn Torres (D, 2017; 
at large).[121][122][123][124] Angel Fuentes was appointed to the at-large 
term ending in December 2017 that was vacated by Arthur Barclay when he 
took office in the New Jersey General Assembly in January 2016. Mayor Milton 
Milan was jailed for his connections to organized crime. On June 15, 2001, 
he was sentenced to serve seven years in prison on 14 counts of corruption, 
including accepting mob payoffs and concealing a $65,000 loan from a drug 
kingpin.[28] Camden is located in the 1st Congressional District[125] and 
is part of New Jersey's 5th state legislative district.[12][126][127] New 
Jersey's First Congressional District is represented by Donald Norcross 
(D, Camden).[128] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate 
by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term ends 2021)[129] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 
2019).[130][131] For the 2016–2017 session (Senate, General Assembly), 
the 5th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented 
in the State Senate by Nilsa Cruz-Perez (D, Barrington) and in the General 
Assembly by Arthur Barclay (D, Camden) and Patricia Egan Jones (D, Barrington).[132] 
The Governor of New Jersey is Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[133] 
The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[134] 
Camden County is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose seven 
members chosen at-large in partisan elections to three-year terms office 
on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election 
each year.[135] As of 2015[update], Camden County's Freeholders are Freeholder 
Director Louis Cappelli, Jr. (Collingswood, term as freeholder ends December 
31, 2017; term as director ends 2015),[136] Freeholder Deputy Director 
Edward T. McDonnell (Pennsauken Township, term as freeholder ends 2016; 
term as deputy director ends 2015),[137] Michelle Gentek (Gloucester Township, 
2015),[138] Ian K. Leonard (Camden, 2015),[139] Jeffrey L. Nash (Cherry 
Hill, 2015),[140] Carmen Rodriguez (Merchantville, 2016)[141] and Jonathan 
L. Young, Sr. (Berlin Township, November 2015; serving the unexpired term 
of Scot McCray ending in 2017)[142][143][144] Camden County's constitutional 
officers, all elected directly by voters, are County clerk Joseph Ripa,[145] 
Sheriff Charles H. Billingham,[146] and Surrogate Patricia Egan Jones.[144][147] 
The Camden County Prosecutor Mary Eva Colalillo was appointed by the Governor 
of New Jersey with the advice and consent of the New Jersey Senate (the 
upper house of the New Jersey Legislature).[148] Three Camden mayors have 
been jailed for corruption: Angelo Errichetti, Arnold Webster, and Milton 
Milan.[149] In 1981, Errichetti was convicted with three other individuals 
for accepting a $50,000 bribe from FBI undercover agents in exchange for 
helping a non-existent Arab sheikh enter the United States.[150] The FBI 
scheme was part of the Abscam operation. The 2013 film American Hustle 
is a fictionalized portrayal of this scheme.[151] In 1999, Webster, who 
was previously the superintendent of Camden City Public Schools, pleaded 
guilty to illegally paying himself $20,000 in school district funds after 
he became mayor.[152] In 2000, Milan was sentenced to more than six years 
in federal prison for accepting payoffs from associates of Philadelphia 
organized crime boss Ralph Natale,[153] soliciting bribes and free home 
renovations from city vendors, skimming money from a political action committee, 
and laundering drug money.[154] The Courier-Post dubbed former State Senator 
Wayne R. Bryant, who represented the state's 5th Legislative District from 
1995 to 2008, the "king of double dipping" for accepting no-show jobs in 
return for political benefits.[155] In 2009, Bryant was sentenced to four 
years in federal prison for funneling $10.5 million to the University of 
Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) in exchange for a no-show 
job and accepting fraudulent jobs to inflate his state pension and was 
assessed a fine of $25,000 and restitution to UMDNJ in excess of $110,000.[156] 
In 2010, Bryant was charged with an additional 22 criminal counts of bribery 
and fraud, for taking $192,000 in false legal fees in exchange for backing 
redevelopment projects in Camden, Pennsauken Township and the New Jersey 
Meadowlands between 2004 and 2006.[157] As of March 23, 2011, there were 
a total of 43,893 registered voters in Camden, of which 17,403 (39.6%) 
were registered as Democrats, 885 (2.0%) were registered as Republicans 
and 25,601 (58.3%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were 4 voters 
registered to other parties.[158] In the 2012 presidential election, Democrat 
Barack Obama received 96.8% of the vote (22,254 cast), ahead of Republican 
Mitt Romney with 3.0% (683 votes), and other candidates with 0.2% (57 votes), 
among the 23,230 ballots cast by the city's 47,624 registered voters (236 
ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 48.8%.[159][160] In the 2008 presidential 
election, Democrat Barack Obama received 91.1% of the vote (22,197 cast), 
ahead of Republican John McCain, who received around 5.0% (1,213 votes), 
with 24,374 ballots cast among the city's 46,654 registered voters, for 
a turnout of 52.2%.[161] In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John 
Kerry received 84.4% of the vote (15,914 ballots cast), outpolling Republican 
George W. Bush, who received around 12.6% (2,368 votes), with 18,858 ballots 
cast among the city's 37,765 registered voters, for a turnout percentage 
of 49.9.[162] In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Democrat Barbara Buono 
received 79.9% of the vote (6,680 cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie 
with 18.8% (1,569 votes), and other candidates with 1.4% (116 votes), among 
the 9,796 ballots cast by the city's 48,241 registered voters (1,431 ballots 
were spoiled), for a turnout of 20.3%.[163][164] In the 2009 gubernatorial 
election, Democrat Jon Corzine received 85.6% of the vote (8,700 ballots 
cast), ahead of both Republican Chris Christie with 5.9% (604 votes) and 
Independent Chris Daggett with 0.8% (81 votes), with 10,166 ballots cast 
among the city's 43,165 registered voters, yielding a 23.6% turnout.[165] 
As of May 2010[update], the city had a total of 181.92 miles (292.77 km) 
of roadways, of which 147.54 miles (237.44 km) were maintained by the municipality, 
25.39 miles (40.86 km) by Camden County, 6.60 miles (10.62 km) by the New 
Jersey Department of Transportation and 2.39 miles (3.85 km) by the Delaware 
River Port Authority.[166] Interstate 676[167] and U.S. Route 30 run through 
Camden to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge on the north side of the city. Interstate 
76 passes through briefly and interchanges with Interstate 676. Route 168 
passes through briefly in the south, and County Routes 537, 543, 551 and 
561 all travel through the heart of the city. NJ Transit's Walter Rand 
Transportation Center is located at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Broadway. 
In addition to being a hub for NJ Transit (NJT) buses in the Southern Division, 
Greyhound Lines, the PATCO Speedline and River Line make stops at the station.[168] 
The PATCO Speedline offers frequent train service to Philadelphia and the 
suburbs to the east in Camden County, with stations at City Hall, Broadway 
(Walter Rand Transportation Center) and Ferry Avenue. The line operates 
24 hours a day. Since its opening in 2004, New Jersey Transit's River Line 
has offered light rail service to towns along the Delaware north of Camden, 
and terminates in Trenton. Camden stations are 36th Street, Walter Rand 
Transportation Center, Cooper Street-Rutgers University, Aquarium and Entertainment 
Center. New Jersey Transit bus service is available to and from Philadelphia 
on the 313, 315, 317, 318 and 400, 401, 402, 404, 406, 408, 409, 410, 412, 
414, and 417, to Atlantic City is served by the 551 bus. Local service 
is offered on the 403, 405, 407, 413, 418, 419, 450, 451, 452, 453, and 
457 lines.[169][170] Studies are being conducted to create the Camden-Philadelphia 
BRT, a bus rapid transit system, with a 2012 plan to develop routes that 
would cover the 23 miles (37 km) between Winslow Township and Philadelphia 
with a stop at the Walter Rand Transportation Center.[171] RiverLink Ferry 
is seasonal service across the Delaware River to Penn's Landing in Philadelphia.[172] 
Officially organized in 1869, the Camden Fire Department (CFD) is the oldest 
paid fire department in New Jersey and is among the oldest paid fire departments 
in the United States. In 1916, the CFD was the first in the United States 
that had an all-motorized fire apparatus fleet.[173][174] Layoffs have 
forced the city to rely on assistance from volunteer fire companies in 
surrounding communities when firefighters from all 10 fire companies are 
unavailable due to calls.[175] The Camden Fire Department currently operates 
out of six fire stations, located throughout the city in 2 Battalions, 
commanded by 2 Battalion Chiefs per shift, in addition to an on-duty Deputy 
Chief. The CFD fire apparatus fleet consists of 5 Engine Companies, 3 Ladder 
Companies, 1 Squad Company, 1 Rescue Company, and several other special, 
support, and reserve units. Since 2010, the Camden Fire Department has 
suffered severe economic cutbacks, including company closures and staffing 
cuts.[176] Below is a list of all fire stations and company locations in 
the city of Camden according to Battalion. One of the most popular attractions 
in Camden is the city's waterfront, along the Delaware River. The waterfront 
is highlighted by its four main attractions, the USS New Jersey; the BB&T 
Pavilion; Campbell's Field; and the Adventure Aquarium.[177] The waterfront 
is also the headquarters for Catapult Learning, a provider of K−12 contracted 
instructional services to public and private schools in the United States, 
and WebiMax, a full-service internet marketing company. The Adventure Aquarium 
was originally opened in 1992 as the New Jersey State Aquarium at Camden. 
In 2005, after extensive renovation, the aquarium was reopened under the 
name Adventure Aquarium.[178] The aquarium was one of the original centerpieces 
in Camden's plans to revitalize the city.[179] The Susquehanna Bank Center 
(formerly known as the Tweeter Center) is a 25,000-seat open-air concert 
amphitheater opened in 1995 and renamed after a 2008 deal in which the 
bank would pay $10 million over 15 years for naming rights.[180] Campbell's 
Field, opened in 2001, was home to the Camden Riversharks (which folded 
in 2015)[181] of the independent Atlantic League; and the Rutgers–Camden 
baseball team. The USS New Jersey (BB-62) was a U.S. Navy battleship that 
was intermittently active between the years 1943 and 1991. After its retirement, 
the ship was turned into the Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial, 
opened in 2001 along the waterfront. The New Jersey saw action during World 
War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and provided support off Lebanon 
in early 1983.[182] Other attractions at the Waterfront are the Wiggins 
Park Riverstage and Marina, One Port Center, The Victor Lofts, the Walt 
Whitman House,[183] the Walt Whitman Cultural Arts Center, the Rutgers–Camden 
Center For The Arts and the Camden Children's Garden. In June 2014, the 
Philadelphia 76ers announced that they would move their practice facility 
and home offices to the Camden Waterfront, adding 250 permanent jobs in 
the city creating what CEO Scott O'Neil described as "biggest and best 
training facility in the country" using $82 million in tax savings offered 
by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.[184][185] The Waterfront 
is also served by two modes of public transportation. NJ Transit serves 
the Waterfront on its River Line, while people from Philadelphia can commute 
using the RiverLink Ferry, which connects the Waterfront with Old City 
Philadelphia.[186] Riverfront State Prison,[187] was a state penitentiary 
located near downtown Camden north of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which 
opened in August 1985 having been constructed at a cost of $31 million.[188] 
The prison had a design capacity of 631 inmates, but housed 1,020 in 2007 
and 1,017 in 2008.[189] The last prisoners were transferred in June 2009 
to other locations and the prison was closed and subsequently demolished, 
with the site expected to be redeveloped by the State of New Jersey, the 
City of Camden, and private investors.[190] In December 2012, the New Jersey 
Legislature approved the sale of the 16-acre (6.5 ha) site, considered 
surplus property to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.[191] 
Camden's public schools are operated by Camden City Public Schools district. 
As of the 2011–12 school year, the district's 30 schools had an enrollment 
of 13,723 students and 1,307.9 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for 
a student–teacher ratio of 10.49:1.[192] The district is one of 31 former 
Abbott districts statewide,[193] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" 
based on the requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building 
and renovation projects in these districts under the supervision of the 
New Jersey Schools Development Authority.[194][195] High schools in the 
district (with 2011–12 enrollment data from the National Center for Education 
Statistics[196]) are: Holy Name School, Sacred Heart Grade School, St. 
Anthony of Padua School and St. Joseph Pro-Cathedral School are K-8 elementary 
schools operating under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden.[202] 
They operate as four of the five schools in the Catholic Partnership Schools, 
a post-parochial model of Urban Catholic Education.[203] The Catholic Partnership 
Schools are committed to sustaining safe and nurturing schools that inspire 
and prepare students for rigorous, college preparatory secondary schools 
or vocations. The University District, adjacent to the downtown, is home 
to the following institutions: The city was once home to two Carnegie libraries, 
the Main Building[212] and the Cooper Library in Johnson Park.[213] The 
city's once extensive library system has been beleaguered by financial 
difficulties and in 2010 threatened to close at the end of the year, but 
was incorporated into the county system.[214][215] The main branch closed 
in February 2011,[216] and was later reopened by the county in the bottom 
floor of the Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University.[217] In addition 
to the Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University, there are academic libraries 
at Cooper Medical School at Rowan and Camden County College. Morgan Quitno 
has ranked Camden as one of the top ten most dangerous cities in the United 
States since 1998, when they first included cities with populations less 
than 100,000. Camden was ranked as the third-most dangerous city in 2002. 
Camden was ranked as the most dangerous city overall in 2004 and 2005.[218][219] 
It improved to the fifth spot for the 2006 and 2007 rankings but rose to 
number two in 2008[220][221][222] and to the most dangerous spot in 2009.[223] 
Morgan Quitno based its rankings on crime statistics reported to the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation in six categories: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated 
assault, burglary, and auto theft.[224] In The Nation, journalist Chris 
Hedges describes Camden as "the physical refuse of postindustrial America",[225] 
plagued with homelessness, drug trafficking, prostitution, robbery, looting, 
constant violence, and an overwhelmed police force (which in 2011 lost 
nearly half of its officers to budget-related layoffs).[226] In 2005, reported 
homicides in Camden dropped to 34, 15 fewer murders than in 2004.[227] 
Though Camden's murder rate was still much higher than the national average, 
the reduction in 2005 was a drop of over 30%. In 2006, the number of murders 
climbed to 40. While murders fell by 10% across New Jersey in 2009, Camden's 
murder rate declined from 55 in 2008 down to 33, a drop of 40% that was 
credited to anti-gang efforts and more firearms seizures.[228] Despite 
significant cuts in the police department due to the city's fiscal difficulties, 
murders in 2009 and 2010 were both under 40, staying below the peak that 
had occurred in 2008, and continued to decline into early 2011. However, 
in 2012, the city's murder rate spiked and reached 62.[229] On October 
29, 2012, the FBI announced Camden was ranked first in violent crime per 
capita of cities with over 50,000 residents, surpassing Flint, Michigan.[230] 
In December 2012, Camden residents surrendered approximately 1,137 firearms 
to two local churches over a two-day period.[231] In 2015, the Camden Police 
Department was operated by the state.[232] In 2011, it was announced that 
a county police department would be formed.[233] On May 1, 2013, the police 
department was disbanded and the newly created Camden County Police Department 
took over full responsibility for policing the city of Camden.[234] The 
fictional Camden mayor Carmine Polito in the 2013 film American Hustle 
is loosely based on 1970s Camden mayor Angelo Errichetti.[239] The 1995 
film 12 Monkeys contains scenes on Camden's Admiral Wilson Boulevard.[240] 
In season 3 episode 19, Self-Destruct of The CW Television show Nikita, 
Camden is portrayed. Alex and Nikita destroys a drug and human trafficking 
gang and their headquarters. People who were born in, are residents of,
