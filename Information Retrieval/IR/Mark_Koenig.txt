Mark Anthony Koenig (July 19, 1904 – April 22, 1993) was an American baseball 
shortstop who played twelve seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He 
played for the New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati 
Reds and New York Giants from 1925 to 1936. A switch hitter who threw right-handed, 
he was listed at 6 feet 0 inches (1.83 m) and 180 pounds (82 kg). Although 
he primarily played as a shortstop, Koenig was utilized at second base 
and third base as well. Koenig played minor league baseball for four different 
teams until May 1925, when he signed for the New York Yankees. After making 
his debut in September 1925 and spending five seasons with the Yankees, 
he was traded to the Detroit Tigers, where he spent the next two seasons. 
He subsequently joined the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds via trades 
in 1932 and 1934, respectively, and was finally traded to the New York 
Giants, with whom he played his last game on September 27, 1936. Koenig 
is most famous for being the last surviving member of the Murderers' Row. 
Koenig was born on July 19, 1904 in San Francisco.[1] His father, Charles 
Koenig, and paternal grandfather William were both bricklayers, with the 
latter having immigrated from Germany to the United States.[2] His mother 
Stella[2] was of Swiss descent.[3] Koenig had two brothers and a sister, 
and, during his childhood, he first met and played baseball with fellow 
San Franciscan and future teammate Tony Lazzeri.[2] He attended Lowell 
High School in his hometown, but dropped out at the age of 16 in order 
to pursue a career in baseball. His high school eventually bestowed upon 
him his diploma in 1988. Koenig, who was 83 at the time, described the 
honour as a complete surprise.[4] In June 1928, Koenig got engaged to Katherine 
Tremaine, whom he married at the end of that year's baseball season.[5] 
Together, they had one daughter, Gail, who was born in 1930.[6] He later 
remarried Doris Bailey,[7] who died in 1979.[8] He appeared as himself 
in The Pride of the Yankees, an Academy Award-winning movie released in 
1942 that pays tribute to his fellow Yankees teammate Lou Gehrig.[9] After 
his baseball career ended, he settled back in his hometown and took up 
several jobs, namely owning gas stations and working as a brewer.[10] Beginning 
in 1982, Koenig's health began to deteriorate. In addition to the lung 
cancer that had developed,[8] he also suffered from gout, poor eyesight 
and back pain that necessitated the use of a cane. Because of these ailments, 
he moved to Orland, California in 1986 in order to live with his daughter 
and her family.[11][12] He died of cancer[12] on April 22, 1993 in Willows, 
California at the age of 88 and was cremated.[1] He had outlived his two 
wives[11] and was survived by his daughter, five grandchildren and nine 
great-grandchildren. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving 
member of the 1927 New York Yankees starting lineup, nicknamed "Murderers' 
Row".[12] Koenig first started playing organized baseball on the Moose 
Jaw Millers team in the Western Canada League.[13] It was here that he 
was first spotted by Bob Connery, a scout who worked for the New York Yankees 
organization. After the league collapsed in the middle of the season, he 
proceeded to play for the St. Paul Saints, a minor league baseball team 
that competed in the American Association. He spent nearly the next four 
seasons with the team; during this time, he had brief sojourns in Jamestown 
and the Des Moines Boosters in order to garner more playing experience.[2][13] 
Koenig returned to St. Paul in 1924 and though he spent the entire season 
with the team, he played just 68 games for them.[13] At the end of the 
season, the Saints advanced to the Little World Series, where they faced 
the International League's Baltimore Orioles. Having had limited playing 
time, it was in Game 5 where he finally got the chance to prove himself.[2] 
Danny Boone, St. Paul's starting shortstop, injured his ankle during batting 
practice.[3][14] Although the rules at the time stipulated that the Saints 
could temporarily utilize a player from another American Association team 
to replace Boone, the Orioles objected[2] and the National Association 
president ruled that Koenig constituted an ample substitute for Boone. 
He proved to be exactly that when he scored the Saints' only run via a 
home run. He finished the Little World Series with a .429 batting average 
and 2 home runs, including one hit off Lefty Grove.[6][14] His stellar 
performance in the series resulted in at least seven MLB teams seeking 
to acquire him in the offseason.[3] However, he stayed with the Saints 
for the first part of the 1925 season before he was traded on May 29 to 
the New York Yankees in exchange for Fred Hofmann, Oscar Roettger, $50,000 
and a player to be named later (Ernie Johnson).[1][15] Koenig made his 
major league debut for the Yankees on September 8, 1925, at the age of 
21,[1] entering the game as a defensive substitute for shortstop Pee-Wee 
Wanninger in a 5–4 win against the Boston Red Sox.[16] During his rookie 
season the following year, he posted a batting average of .271 and struck 
out just 37 times in 617 at bats,[1] a statistic which his manager Miller 
Huggins looked highly upon.[2] Defensively, he committed the most errors 
among all fielders in the American League and most errors by a shortstop 
with 52. Nonetheless, he had the AL's third highest range factor at shortstop 
of 4.99 and made a league-leading 470 putouts.[1] In the postseason, the 
Yankees advanced to the 1926 World Series, where they lost to the St. Louis 
Cardinals in seven games.[17] In the crucial Game 7, Koenig made an error 
when attempting to field a double play opportunity in the fourth inning. 
This eventually led to the Cardinals scoring—what turned out to be—the 
winning run in a 3–2 victory. Koenig was subsequently criticized by fans 
for being responsible for Yankees losing the game and, ultimately, the 
series.[2] Koenig was penciled into the two-hole spot in the Yankees' 1927 
Opening Day lineup, with Earle Combs batting in front of him at leadoff 
and Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel and Tony Lazzeri batting behind him.[18] 
This lineup, which was utilized in that order throughout the majority of 
the season, was given the nickname "Murderers' Row". Many sports analysts, 
baseball writers and fans consider the 1927 team the greatest baseball 
team of all time.[19][20][21] Although he was dismissive of the role he 
played,[22] Koenig contributed to the team's success as he batted .285 
and amassed 150 hits, 11 triples, 99 runs scored and 62 runs batted in. 
However, he once again led the league in errors with 47, but compensated 
for this by recording the highest range factor at shortstop (5.61) and 
third most assists at shortstop (423).[1] He also part of history when, 
after hitting a triple, he was the only Yankee player on base when Babe 
Ruth hit his milestone 60th home run, setting a new single-season record.[22] 
The Yankees advanced to the World Series that year, where they swept the 
Pittsburgh Pirates. Koenig performed impressively throughout the series, 
batting a team-leading .500 and committed no errors in 24 total chances.[10]
