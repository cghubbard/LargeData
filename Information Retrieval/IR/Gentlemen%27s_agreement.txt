A gentlemen's agreement or gentleman's agreement is an informal and legally 
non-binding agreement between two or more parties. It is typically oral, 
though it may be written, or simply understood as part of an unspoken agreement 
by convention or through mutually beneficial etiquette. The essence of 
a gentlemen's agreement is that it relies upon the honor of the parties 
for its fulfillment, rather than being in any way enforceable. It is, therefore, 
distinct from a legal agreement or contract, which can be enforced if necessary. 
The phrase appears in British Parliamentary records of 1821,[1] and in 
Massachusetts public records of 1835.[2] The Oxford English Dictionary 
cites P. G. Wodehouse's 1929 story collection Mr Mulliner Speaking as the 
first appearance of the term.[3] A gentleman's agreement, defined in the 
early 20th century as "an agreement between gentlemen looking toward the 
control of prices," was reported by one source to be the loosest form of 
a "pool".[4] These types of agreements have been reported to be found in 
every type of industry, and are numerous in the steel and iron industries.[4] 
A report from the United States House of Representatives detailing their 
investigation of the United States Steel Corporation asserted that there 
were two general types of loose associations or consolidations between 
steel and iron interests in the 1890s, in which the individual concerns 
retained ownership as well as a large degree of independence: the "pool" 
and the "gentleman's agreement".[5] The latter type lacked any formal organization 
to regulate output or prices, nor did they contain any provisions for forfeiture 
in the event of an infraction.[5] The efficacy of the agreement relied 
on members to keep informal pledges.[5] In the automotive industry, Japanese 
manufacturers agreed that no production car would have more than 276 bhp 
(206 kW; 280 PS); this agreement ended in 2005.[6] German manufacturers 
limit the top speed of high-performance saloons (sedans) and station wagons 
to 250 kilometres per hour (155 mph).[7][8][9] When the Suzuki Hayabusa 
motorcycle exceeded 310 km/h (190 mph) in 1999 and, fears of a European 
ban or regulatory crackdown led Japanese and European motorcycle makers 
to agree to a limit of 300 km/h (186 mph) in late 1999.[10] See List of 
fastest production motorcycles. Intense anti-Japanese sentiment developed 
on the West Coast. US President Theodore Roosevelt did not want to anger 
Japan by passing legislation to bar Japanese immigration to the US, as 
had been done for Chinese immigration. Instead, there was an informal "Gentlemen's 
Agreement" (1907–8) between the United States and Japan, whereby Japan 
made sure there was very little or no movement to the US. The agreements 
were made by Secretary of State, Elihu Root, and Japan's Foreign Minister, 
Tadasu Hayashi. The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to 
the US and rescinded the segregation order of the San Francisco School 
Board in California, which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The 
agreement did not apply to the Territory of Hawaii, which was treated at 
the time as separate and distinct from the US. The agreements remained 
effective until 1924, when Congress forbade all immigration from Japan.[11] 
Gentlemen's agreements have come to regulate international activities such 
as the coordination of monetary or trade policies.[12] According to Edmund 
Osmańczyk in the Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements, 
it is also defined as "an international term for an agreement made orally 
rather than in writing, yet fully legally valid".[13] This type of agreement 
may allow a nation to avoid the domestic legal requirements to enter into 
a formal treaty,[12] or it may be useful when a government wants to enter 
into a secret agreement that is not binding upon the next administration.[14] 
According to another author, all international agreements are gentlemen's 
agreements because, short of war, they are all unenforceable.[14] Osmańczyk 
pointed out that there is a difference between open gentlemen's agreements 
and secret diplomatic agreements.[13] In the United States, a prohibition 
against gentlemen's agreements in commercial relations between states was 
introduced in 1890, because the secretive nature of such agreements was 
beyond anyone's control.[13] In English contract law, for an agreement 
to be binding, there must be an intention to create legal relations; but 
in commercial dealings (i.e. agreements that are not between family members 
or friends) there is a legal presumption of an "intention to create legal 
relations". However, in the 1925 case of Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton 
& Bros Ltd , the House of Lords held that the phrase, "This arrangement 
is not ... a formal or legal agreement ... but is only a record of the 
intention of the parties" was sufficient to rebut the said presumption.[15] 
Gentlemen's agreements were a widely used discriminatory tactic reportedly 
more common than restrictive covenants in "preserving" the homogeneity 
of upper-class neighborhoods and suburbs in the United States.[16] The 
nature of these agreements made them extremely difficult to prove or to 
track, and were effective long after the United States Supreme Court's 
rulings in Shelley v. Kraemer and Barrows v. Jackson.[16] One source states 
that gentlemen's agreements "undoubtedly still exist", but that their use 
has greatly diminished.[16] In 1934, the National Football League entered 
into a gentlemen's agreement to ban black players.[17] Until Jackie Robinson 
was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946, a gentlemen's agreement also 
ensured that African American players were excluded from organized baseball.[18]
