The 1971 Minnesota Twins finished 74-86, fifth in the American League West. 
940,858 fans attended Twins games, the fifth highest total in the American 
League, the first time the Twins failed to attract over one million fans 
since moving to Minnesota. Five Twins made the All-Star Game: first baseman 
Harmon Killebrew, second baseman Rod Carew, shortstop Leo Cárdenas, outfielder 
Tony Oliva, and pitcher Jim Perry. On August 10, at Metropolitan Stadium, 
slugger Harmon Killebrew hit his 500th career home run, in the first inning 
off the Baltimore Orioles' Mike Cuellar. He followed that in the sixth 
inning with his 501st, also off Cuellar. Lead off batter César Tovar led 
the AL with 204 hits and was second with 94 runs. Tony Oliva won his third 
batting title with a .337 average and led the AL with a .546 slugging percentage. 
Harmon Killebrew hit 28 HR and 119 RBI. Rod Carew hit .307. Jim Perry (17-17), 
Bert Blyleven (16-15), and Jim Kaat (13-14) were the Twins' best pitchers. 
Kaat won his tenth Gold Glove Award. Shortstop Leo Cárdenas topped the 
AL with a .985 fielding percentage—the highest for an American League shortstop 
since records began in 1901. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
