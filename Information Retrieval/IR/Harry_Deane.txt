John Henry "Harry" Deane (May 6, 1846 – May 31, 1925) was an American professional 
baseball player born in Trenton, New Jersey. He mostly played center field 
in his two season career in the National Association. He played in six 
games while managing five for the 1871 Fort Wayne Kekiongas, and 46 games 
for the 1874 Baltimore Canaries.[1] In 1870, Deane was substitute player 
for the famous Cincinnati Red Stockings.[2] When the team's biggest star 
George Wright injured his knee and missed 16 games, Deane played Andy Leonard's 
outfield position while the latter replaced Wright at shortstop.[3] The 
Fort Wayne team joined the new National Association in 1871, an organization 
made of all-professional teams from around the country. He played in six 
games, batting .182, playing all of his games in Left Field.[1] After just 
14 games into the season, and 5–9 record, Bill Lennon was relieved of his 
on field command,[4] and Harry replaced him, finishing the final games 
the team played with a 2–3 record.[1] Harry joined the Baltimore Canaries 
in 1874, playing the majority of his time in Center Field. He finished 
the season with a .246 batting average in 47 games played.[1] Harry died 
at the age of 79 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and was buried at Crown Hill
