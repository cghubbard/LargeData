José Dariel Abreu Correa (born January 29, 1987) is a Cuban professional 
baseball first baseman for the Chicago White Sox of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played in the Cuban National Series for Cienfuegos before his 
defection in August 2013. After being granted free agency by MLB, Abreu 
signed with the White Sox in October 2013. Abreu has also filled in at 
designated hitter for the White Sox. Abreu set a Cuban home run record 
in 2010–2011 and was named league MVP. He had played five seasons in the 
Cuban Serie Nacional through 2007–2008, hitting .295 and slugging .467. 
After 48 games in 2008–2009, he was batting .345/~.368/.600, earning the 
infielder a spot on Cuba's provisional roster for the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic. He did not make the final cut and finished the season with a .346/.441/.630 
batting line. He led the 2008-09 Cuban National Series with 30 times hit 
by pitch. He tied Yenier Bello and Alexander Guerrero for 8th in homers 
(19), was 8th in slugging and 4th in strikeouts (69). Abreu was 2 for 10 
in the 2009 World Port Tournament, backing up Ariel Borrero at first base. 
In the 2009 Baseball World Cup, he hit .250/.333/.469 in his first major 
tournament. He was listed in the IBAF's Final Report as being one of the 
All-Star outfielders alongside teammate Alfredo Despaigne and Jon Weber, 
but other sources list Puerto Rico's Miguel Abreu, who had better statistics. 
He was not even used as a starter in the outfield, playing alongside Ariel 
Borrero at first. In the Gold Medal game, he did not appear as Borrero 
saw the action. In 2009–2010, Abreu had his best year yet, hitting .399/.555/.822 
with 82 runs, 30 homers, 76 RBI and 74 walks to 49 strikeouts in 89 games. 
He tied Leonys Martín for 6th in the Serie Nacional in runs, tied for third 
with 25 doubles, tied Yulieski Gourriel for second in home runs (one behind 
Alfredo Despaigne in a to-the-wire home run race), was third with 235 total 
bases (behind Despaigne and Gourriel), again led with 30 times hit by pitch, 
tied Enrique Esteban Díaz for 4th in walks, led with 32 intentional walks 
(12 more than runner-up Yosvany Peraza), was second in average (.005 behind 
Despaigne), led in slugging (.008 over Despaigne) and probably led in OBP. 
He was named the All-Star first baseman. Abreu was Cuba's starting first 
baseman when they won the 2010 Intercontinental Cup, their first Gold in 
an international tournament in three years. He hit .292/.320/.500. In the 
finale, he went 1 for 3 and scored the first run in the victory over the 
Dutch national baseball team; he doubled off Rob Cordemans in the third 
and came home on a Yorbis Borroto hit. He helped Cuba finish second at 
the 2010 Pan American Games Qualifying Tournament. In the 2010 World University 
Baseball Championship, he posted the best average by going 10 for 18 with 
2 walks, a double, triple, four homers, 9 runs and 12 RBI in six games 
as Cuba won the Gold. He was 0 for 4 in the finale, as Cuba edged Team 
USA. He was named the event's All-Star 1B. Abreu continued to improve in 
2010–11 Cuban National Series with one of the greatest seasons in Cuban 
history. He hit .453/.597/.986 with 79 runs, 93 RBI and 33 home runs in 
only 66 games.[1] Despite missing 23 games due to bursitis in his shoulder, 
he broke Despaigne's home run record (as did Yoenis Céspedes – both hit 
their 33rd on the season's last day). Despaigne would reclaim the record 
a year later. Abreu led the league in average (.052 over Michel Enríquez), 
slugging (a whopping .212 over runner-up Frederich Cepeda), intentional 
walks (21) and homers (tied with Yoenis Céspedes), was second in RBI (6 
behind Céspedes), tied for 8th in runs with Donal Duarte, was 7th in total 
bases (209) and 4th in times hit by pitch (21). Had he not been injured, 
he would have likely easily won a Triple Crown. He won Cuban National Series 
Most Valuable Player Award. He was the second MVP from Cienfuegos, following 
Pedro José Rodríguez, Sr. by 31 years. Abreu was named to the Cuban national 
baseball team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[1] In Cuba's six games, 
he batted .383 and hit three home runs while recording nine RBIs.[2] In 
August 2013, Abreu defected from Cuba to test the MLB free agent market.[3] 
His defection was later confirmed by former teammate Henry Urrutia.[4] 
He established residency in the Dominican Republic and was named a free 
agent. In October, he signed a six-year contract with the Chicago White 
Sox worth $68 million.[2][5] On the White Sox, Abreu joined fellow Cuban 
players Alexei Ramírez, Dayán Viciedo, and Rule 5 draft pick Adrian Nieto. 
Abreu recorded his first major league hit on March 31, 2014 against the 
Minnesota Twins. On April 8, 2014, Abreu hit the first two home runs of 
his career at Coors Field, helping his team defeat the Colorado Rockies 
15-3. On April 25, 2014, he captured his eighth home run of the year off 
Chris Archer, tying the rookie record for homers in March/April. Later 
that night, Abreu recorded his third multi-homer game with a walk-off grand 
slam off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Grant Balfour giving him nine homers in 
his first month in the Major Leagues, surpassing the record of eight shared 
by Albert Pujols (2001), Carlos Delgado (1994), and Kent Hrbek (1982). 
Two days later, Abreu broke the rookie record for RBI in the month of April 
with 31, and extended the April rookie home run record to 10.[6] For his 
performance, Abreu was awarded a share of the AL Player of the Week Award 
with Seattle Mariners' third baseman Kyle Seager. During this week, Abreu 
batted .310 with 5 home runs, 14 RBI and an .862 slugging percentage .[7] 
On May 18, Abreu was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis 
in his left ankle.[8] On June 2, Abreu returned from the DL to face the 
Los Angeles Dodgers. In his second at bat after his return, Abreu hit a 
two-run home run off Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw. On July 6, Abreu was 
selected to the 2014 MLB All-Star Game along with teammates Alexei Ramírez 
and Chris Sale. At the All-Star Break, Abreu had a .292 batting average 
with 73 RBIs and an MLB-leading 29 home runs. During the season, Abreu 
was named both player of the month and rookie of the month for April & 
July. Nobody in baseball had ever won both awards in the same month twice 
in one season. Having won the rookie honor in June, Abreu became only the 
fourth player to win the Rookie of the Month honor three or more times 
in a season.[9] Abreu finished the season with a White Sox rookie record 
36 home runs.[10] He won the 2014 Sporting News American League Rookie 
of the Year Award.[11] He was awarded the AL Silver Slugger Award for first 
basemen, becoming the only White Sox first baseman besides Frank Thomas 
to ever gain the honor. Abreu was unanimously named the 2014 AL Rookie 
of the Year by the BBWAA on November 10, 2014.[12] Abreu wears #79, an 
unusually high uniform number. His mother, Daysi Correa,[13] chose the 
number so that people would remember it. Abreu's mother and the rest of 
his extended family remained in Cuba[14] until his parents moved to the 
United States in May 2014.[13] The 2014 MLB All-Star Game was the first
