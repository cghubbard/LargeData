Robert Clinton Richardson (born August 19, 1935) is a former second baseman 
in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Yankees from 1955 
through 1966. Batting and throwing right-handed, he was a superb defensive 
infielder, as well as something of a clutch hitter, who played no small 
role in the Yankee baseball dynasty of his day. He is the only World Series 
MVP ever to be selected from the losing team. He wore the uniform number 
1 for the majority of his career (1958–1966). Richardson debuted on August 
5, 1955. He racked up 1,432 hits in his career, with a lifetime batting 
average of .266, 34 home runs and 390 RBIs. He won a Gold Glove at second 
base each year from 1961-65 (not until Robinson Canó in 2010 would another 
Yankee second baseman win a Gold Glove) while forming a top double play 
combination with shortstop and roommate Tony Kubek. With the light-hitting 
but superb-fielding Yankee third baseman Clete Boyer, Richardson and Kubek 
gave the Yankees arguably the best defensive infield in baseball. His most 
famous defensive play came at the end of the 1962 World Series, mentioned 
below, when Richardson made a clutch catch of a Willie McCovey line drive 
that prevented Willie Mays and Matty Alou from scoring the runs that would 
have beaten the Yankees and given the Series to the San Francisco Giants. 
Richardson's 12-year career statistics also include 643 runs scored and 
73 stolen bases. He also had 196 doubles and 37 triples. His best year 
was probably 1962, when he batted .302 with 8 home runs and 59 runs batted 
in. His 209 hits led the American League, and he stole 11 bases in 161 
games. He made the AL All-Star team, won his second Gold Glove, and came 
in second in the AL MVP voting, just behind teammate Mickey Mantle. One 
of the best parts of Richardson's game was his ability to make contact. 
He struck out just 243 times in his entire 12-year career, less than 5% 
of his plate appearances. He was among the top three players in the league 
in at bats per strikeout eight times during his career, and led the league 
three times, 1964–1966. He twice led the league in sacrifice bunts. He 
also led the league in at bats three times, partly because he batted early 
in the order and partly because he rarely missed a game, coming to be known 
as a workhorse. His career high was 692 at bats in 161 games in 1962. He 
had an all-time fielding percentage of .979 at second base. Richardson 
won three World Series (1958, 1961, 1962) of the seven he played with the 
Yankees (1957, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964). In the 1960 Series, 
Richardson was named Most Valuable Player after hitting .367 with 12 RBIs, 
becoming the first non-pitcher to earn the relatively new award, and is 
to this day the only MVP to play for the losing team. Two years later, 
he caught the final out of the 1962 Series; hardly moving from his position, 
he snared a screaming line drive off the bat of Willie McCovey, which, 
if it had been two or three feet higher would have won the Series for the 
San Francisco Giants. In Game One of the 1963 World Series, which the Los 
Angeles Dodgers swept in four games over the Yankees, Richardson struck 
out three times against Sandy Koufax—his only three-strikeout game in 1448 
regular-season/World Series games. (Koufax would finish with 15 strikeouts, 
then a World Series single-game record.) Just that regular season, Richardson 
had struck out only 22 times in 630 at-bats, without ever striking out 
twice in one game. In the 1964 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Richardson set a World Series record with 13 hits; this record has since 
tied by Lou Brock and Marty Barrett in the 1968 and 1986 World Series, 
respectively. However, batting against Cardinal ace Bob Gibson with the 
Yankees trailing 7-5 in the 7th and deciding game of that World Series, 
he popped out to Dal Maxvill for the final out of the Series. Richardson 
also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the 
outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he 
mishandled Dick Groat's ground ball for a double play that would have ended 
the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later 
by Ken Boyer's grand slam—the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating 
the Yankees 4-3. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled Curt Flood's 
double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without 
any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won 
the game 5-2 on Tim McCarver's 10th inning, three-run home run. Richardson 
retired at the end of the 1966 season. He was only 30 years old, and easily 
could have played longer. Richardson served as the head baseball coach 
for the South Carolina Gamecocks from 1970 to 1976. He led the Gamecocks 
to their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 1974, which set the stage 
for what would happen a year later in 1975 when South Carolina posted a 
51-6-1 record and made the College World Series for the first time ever. 
They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas 
(a 5-1 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 
season, finishing his tenure with a 221-92-1 record and three NCAA Tournament 
appearances. Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, 
and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the 
elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today. Richardson ran 
for the United States Congress from South Carolina's 5th congressional 
district in 1976 as a Republican, losing to incumbent Democrat Kenneth 
Holland by a narrow margin. Holland was aided by the strength of Jimmy 
Carter's winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a 
tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by 
former baseball players Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bob Feller, and Wilmer 
"Vinegar Bend" Mizell among others. Richardson's old friend, Yankee shortstop 
Tony Kubek, declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat.[1] 
In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach at Liberty University 
and also for two seasons (1985–86) at Coastal Carolina University in Conway, 
South Carolina, where he compiled a record of (61-38). Richardson is a 
born-again Christian. He is a national leader in the Fellowship of Christian 
Athletes and a much sought-after Christian speaker. He makes personal appearances 
at churches and on October 18, 1970, at the invitation of President Richard 
Nixon, preached at the White House. For instance, he appeared on October 
27, 2007, at North Monroe Baptist Church in Monroe, Louisiana, to sign 
autographs and share baseball tales with fans of all age groups.[2] Richardson 
also officiated at his Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle's funeral. His 2012 
book, Impact Player chronicles his life including his years with the Yankee 
Dynasty. In the late 1960s, an LP record (LP # W-3343-LP) produced and 
titled The Bobby Richardson Story, produced by Word Records Inc. of Waco, 
Texas, was released. The sub-title is "The Exciting First-Person Account
