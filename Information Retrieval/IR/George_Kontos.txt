George Nicholas Kontos (born June 12, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball player. A relief pitcher, he plays for the San Francisco Giants 
of Major League Baseball (MLB). Kontos made his MLB debut for the New York 
Yankees in 2011 before he was traded to the Giants before the 2012 season. 
Prior to playing professionally, he played college baseball at Northwestern 
University. He bats and throws right-handed. Kontos attended Niles West 
High School in Skokie, Illinois,[1] where he was named the high school 
baseball player of the year in Illinois in 2003.[2][3] He also lettered 
in golf and basketball.[2] Kontos attended Northwestern University as an 
economics major, where he played for the Northwestern Wildcats baseball 
team in the Big Ten Conference.[3] Despite his never winning five games 
in a season, or finishing a season with an earned run average (ERA) below 
5.00, the New York Yankees selected Kontos in the fifth round of the 2006 
Major League Baseball draft after his junior year.[3] Kontos signed with 
the Yankees after his college career and played for the Staten Island Yankees 
of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League in 2006, winning the league 
championship.[4] With a 7–3 win–loss record, 2.64 ERA, and 82 strikeouts 
in 78 innings pitched, Baseball America named Kontos a Short-Season All-Star.[3] 
He pitched for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State 
League in 2007[5] and the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League 
in 2008.[6] After starting the 2009 season with Trenton, he was promoted 
to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League.[7] 
After experiencing tightness in his pitching arm in June 2009, Kontos went 
on the disabled list in what he thought was a precautionary measure. Magnetic 
resonance imaging diagnosed a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow, 
which required Tommy John surgery, forcing him to miss the rest of the 
season.[8][9] Returning to action in 2010 after a ten-month recovery,[10] 
Kontos shifted into a relief pitcher.[11] That season, he pitched for Tampa, 
Trenton, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.[12] After the 2010 season, the Yankees 
opted not to protect Kontos on their 40 man roster. Consequently, he was 
selected by the San Diego Padres from the Yankees in the Rule 5 draft that 
offseason.[13] After making three appearances for the Padres during spring 
training in 2011, he was returned to the Yankees prior to the regular season.[14] 
Kontos began his 2011 minor league season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where 
he pitched to a 4–4 win–loss record and a 2.64 ERA in 40 appearances.[15] 
Kontos made his major league debut on September 10, 2011 against the Los 
Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[16][17] Appearing in seven games for the Yankees, 
Kontos pitched to a 3.00 ERA in six innings, while striking out six batters.[18] 
Kontos was also part of the Yankees postseason roster until the Yankees 
lost to the Detroit Tigers in the 2011 ALDS. Due in part to a back injury 
suffered by Yankees catcher Austin Romine, the Yankees traded Kontos to 
the San Francisco Giants in exchange for catcher Chris Stewart before the 
start of the 2012 season.[19][20] He began the season with the Fresno Grizzlies 
of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.[21] After starting the season with 
a 2–0 win-loss record and a 1.71 ERA in 23 appearances, the Giants promoted 
him to the major leagues on June 10.[22] Through August 14, he pitched 
to a 2.33 ERA and a 1.15 walks plus hits per innings pitched (WHIP) ratio 
in 26 games, becoming a reliable member of the Giants bullpen.[23] Kontos 
got his first major league win in relief of Barry Zito, successfully recording 
7 outs without allowing a baserunner. The Giants went on to win the game 
6–4 against the Astros. Kontos entered the postseason for a second straight 
season and eventually won the 2012 World Series with the Giants by performing 
a 4-game sweep over the Tigers. In 2013, Kontos was named to the opening-day 
25-man roster.[24] On June 11, 2013, Kontos was ejected for the first time 
in his Major League career after hitting Pittsburgh Pirates center fielder 
Andrew McCutchen with a pitch. Kontos was suspended three games by the 
commissioner's office and optioned to Triple-A Fresno on June 12.[25] Kontos 
was recalled to the majors on June 24.[26] On July 22, Kontos threw a career-high 
63 pitches in an 11–0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds that helped save the 
Giants' bullpen before a doubleheader the following day.[27] Kontos was 
optioned back to Triple-A on July 23 and wasn't recalled until rosters 
expanded in September. On September 20, 2013, Kontos achieved notoriety 
as he surrendered Alex Rodriguez's 24th career grand slam that broke the 
record formerly held by Lou Gehrig. For the 2013 season, Kontos made 52 
relief appearances, pitching 55 1⁄3 innings with a 2–2 record and 4.39 
ERA. In 2014, Kontos started the season in Triple-A Fresno.[28] During 
the season, he was called up to the Majors and sent back to Fresno four 
times.[29] In 24 games with the Giants, he pitched 32 1⁄3 innings with 
27 strikeouts, a 4–0 record, and 2.88 ERA. He was left off the postseason 
roster but earned his second World Series ring as the Giants won the 2014 
World Series.[30] Kontos was named to the Giants' opening-day roster for 
2015.[31] Through July 11, Kontos stranded all 25 base runners he inherited 
on the season.[32] Kontos appeared in a career-high 73 games, recording 
a career-best 0.941 WHIP and holding opponents to a .159 average with runners 
in scoring position, third-best in the Majors.[33] In 2015, Kontos pitched 
73 1⁄3 innings, with 44 strikeouts, a 4–4 record, and 2.33 ERA.[33] On 
February 1, 2016, Kontos agreed to a one-year, $1.15 million contract with 
the San Francisco Giants, avoiding arbitration.[34] After appearing in 
eight of the Giants' first 13 games of the 2016 season, Kontos went on 
the disabled list with a strained flexor.[35] Kontos' younger brother, 
Chris, played on a traveling baseball team, known as the Renegades, that
