Ernest Daniel White (September 5, 1916 – May 22, 1974) was an American 
professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1940 
to 1943 and in 1946–48. A native of Pacolet Mills, South Carolina, he threw 
left-handed, batted right-handed, stood 5 ft 11 1⁄2 in (1.82 m) (182 cm) 
tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). White pitched for two National League 
clubs, the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Braves, during his seven-year 
MLB career, and was a member of three pennant-winners and one World Series 
champion. In 108 games, he won 30 and lost 21 contests, with an earned 
run average of 2.78. All thirty victories came during his first four years 
in the league as a Cardinal. He served in the U.S. Army during World War 
II and missed the 1944–45 seasons. He pitched a complete-game shutout in 
Game 3 of the 1942 World Series, defeating the New York Yankees 2–0 at 
Yankee Stadium, as the Cardinals beat New York in five games in the only 
World Series ever lost by the Yanks during Joe McCarthy's 15+-year term 
as manager. During the previous season, 1941, White enjoyed his best campaign, 
winning 17 of 24 decisions, compiling an ERA of 2.40, and finishing sixth 
in the NL Most Valuable Player poll. Because of a sore arm, White pitched 
in only one game and four innings for the 1947 Braves, and spent most of 
that campaign as a coach on the staff of Boston manager Billy Southworth. 
But he was able to return to the mound for 15 games and 23 innings with 
Boston's 1948 NL championship team before embarking on a 15-year (1949–62; 
1964) career as a minor league manager in the farm systems of the Boston/Milwaukee 
Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Athletics, Yankees and New York Mets, 
winning three league championships. His 1952 Columbia Reds won 100 regular-season 
games, but lost in the Sally League playoffs. White also spent one season, 
1963, as pitching coach of the Mets on the staff of legendary Casey Stengel. 
Ernie White died in Augusta, Georgia, at the age of 57 from complications
