Virne Beatrice "Jackie" Mitchell Gilbert (August 29, 1913 – January 7, 
1987)[1] was one of the first female pitchers in professional baseball 
history. Pitching for the Chattanooga Lookouts Class AA minor league baseball 
team in an exhibition game against the New York Yankees, she struck out 
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in succession.[2] Jackie Mitchell was born August 
29, 1913 in Chattanooga, Tennessee,[3] to Virne Wall Mitchell and Dr. Joseph 
Mitchell.[4][5] When she learned how to walk, her father took her to the 
baseball diamond and taught her the basics of the game. Her next door neighbor, 
Dazzy Vance, taught her to pitch and showed her his "drop ball", a type 
of breaking ball.[6] Vance was a major league pitcher and would eventually 
be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[7] At the age of 16, Mitchell 
began playing for the Engelettes, a women's team in Chattanooga, Tennessee, 
and went on to attend a baseball training camp in Atlanta, Georgia. In 
doing so she attracted the attention of Joe Engel, the president and owner 
of the Chattanooga Lookouts, who was known for using publicity stunts as 
a way to draw crowds during the Great Depression. Seeing Mitchell as an 
opportunity to draw attention to the Lookouts, he signed her to the team 
on March 25, 1931.[8][9] She appeared in her first professional game on 
April 2 becoming only the second woman to play organized baseball behind 
Lizzie Arlington who pitched for the Reading Coal Heavers against the Allentown 
Peanuts in a Minor league game in 1898.[10] The New York Yankees and the 
Chattanooga Lookouts were scheduled to play an exhibition game in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee, on April 1, 1931. Due to rain the game was postponed until the 
next day. Seventeen-year-old Mitchell was brought in to pitch during the 
first inning by Lookouts manager Bert Niehoff after the starting pitcher, 
Clyde Barfoot, gave up a double and a single. The next two batters were 
Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.[9] After taking a ball, Ruth swung and missed 
at the next two pitches. Mitchell's fourth pitch to Ruth was a called third 
strike. Babe Ruth glared and verbally abused the umpire before being led 
away by his teammates to sit to wait for another batting turn. The crowd 
roared for Jackie. Babe Ruth was quoted in a Chattanooga newspaper as having 
said: "I don't know what's going to happen if they begin to let women in 
baseball. Of course, they will never make good. Why? Because they are too 
delicate. It would kill them to play ball every day."[9][11] Next up was 
the Iron Horse Lou Gehrig, who swung through the first three pitches to 
strike out. Jackie Mitchell became famous for striking out two of the greatest 
baseball players in history. A few days after Mitchell struck out Ruth 
and Gehrig, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis voided her contract 
and declared women unfit to play baseball as the game was "too strenuous."[5][12] 
Mitchell continued to play professionally, barnstorming with the House 
of David, a men's team famous for their very long hair and long beards.[13] 
While travelling with the House of David team, she would sometimes wear 
a fake beard for publicity.[14] She retired in 1937 at the age of 23 after 
becoming furious since her story about playing baseball was being used 
something of a side show – once being asked to pitch while riding a donkey.[12] 
She refused to come out of retirement when the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League formed in 1943.[14] Major League Baseball would formally 
ban the signing of women to contracts on June 21, 1952.[12] The ban lasted 
until 1992 when Carey Schueler was drafted by the Chicago White Sox for 
the 1993 season.[citation needed] In 1982 Mitchell was invited to throw 
out the ceremonial first pitch for the Chattanooga Lookouts on their season 
opening day.[15] Jackie Mitchell died in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, on January 
7, 1987, and was buried in Forest Hills Cemetery in Chattanooga.[16][17]
