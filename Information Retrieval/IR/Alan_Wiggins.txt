Alan Anthony Wiggins (February 17, 1958 – January 6, 1991) was an American 
professional baseball player. He was a second baseman and outfielder in 
Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles 
between 1981 and 1987. A speedy leadoff hitter, Wiggins established a Padres 
single-season record for stolen bases in 1984, when they won the National 
League Championship Series (NLCS) and advanced to the World Series. Wiggins 
grew up in California and attended Pasadena City College before being drafted 
by the California Angels in 1977. He played in the minor league systems 
of the Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers, setting a professional baseball 
single-season record with 120 stolen bases in 1980. He made his major league 
debut with the San Diego Padres in 1981, and he became a regular player 
within two years. In 1983, he set the Padres' single-season stolen base 
record, a mark which he extended the following season. His 1984 stolen 
bases total (70) is still a team record as of 2015. During his major league 
career, Wiggins struggled with drug addiction, which resulted in multiple 
arrests and suspensions from baseball. His drug problems prompted a 1985 
trade from San Diego to Baltimore, where Wiggins spent three seasons. After 
leaving baseball, he was diagnosed with AIDS. He was the first MLB player 
known to die of AIDS. Long after his death, two of Wiggins' children, Candice 
and Alan, Jr., became professional basketball players. Wiggins was born 
in Los Angeles, California.[1] His mother, Karla Wiggins, raised him as 
a single parent. He played baseball with his friends at a park across from 
the Rose Bowl.[2] As a child, Wiggins was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
and he looked up to Maury Wills, a Dodgers player known for stealing bases.[3] 
Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California;[a] 
the school was also the alma mater of baseball star Jackie Robinson. Gib 
Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. 
Wiggins was 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm), taller than a typical infielder. 
He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet.[5] 
The California Angels selected Wiggins as the eighth overall pick of the 
January 1977 MLB amateur draft.[6] In 1977, Wiggins played junior college 
baseball at Pasadena City College, where he was teammates with future major 
leaguers Matt Young and Rod Booker.[7] Bodet, who had moved to the Angels 
scouting staff just before the draft, joined other Angels staff members 
and worked out with Wiggins after they selected him. Angels coach Bob Clear 
told Wiggins that his excellent speed would help him to a high batting 
average even if his hitting skills were not that strong. "If you can hit 
.200, you can run the other eighty points. And if you can hit .280, you 
can lead off for anybody," Clear said.[5] Wiggins signed with the Angels 
in May for $2500 after what Bodet described as "a tough negotiation".[5][8] 
According to Bodet, Wiggins' mother "did not trust easily".[5] Wiggins 
played minor league baseball in 1977 for the Angels rookie-league affiliate 
in Idaho Falls, where he hit .271 and had 25 stolen bases in 63 games. 
In 1978, with the Class A Quad Cities Angels, Wiggins stole 26 bases in 
49 games, but his batting average fell to .201.[9] However, he had a midseason 
fight with one of his coaches,[2] and was released by the Angels organization 
in June 1978.[3] Wiggins feared that his career was near its end, but he 
reached out to Los Angeles Dodgers scout Gail Henley. After a workout in 
front of the Dodgers and manager Tommy Lasorda, Wiggins signed with the 
team before the 1979 season.[3] In 95 games for the Class A Clinton Dodgers, 
Wiggins hit .257 and had 43 steals. After having played exclusively at 
second base the prior two years, the Dodgers converted him primarily to 
shortstop that year, but he also appeared in the outfield and at all three 
of the other infield positions.[9] Playing with the Class A Lodi Dodgers 
of the California League in 1980, Wiggins batted .288 and scored 108 runs 
while stealing 120 bases in just 135 games.[10] His steals established 
a then professional-baseball single-season record,[b] surpassing the previous 
minor league mark of 116 set by Allan Lewis in 1966,[10][12] as well as 
Lou Brock's major-league record of 118 in 1974.[13][14] Wiggins caught 
the eye of San Diego Padres general manager Jack McKeon, who drafted him 
in the 1980 Rule 5 draft after the Dodgers decided to leave him unprotected.[2][15][16] 
According to the Padres, Wiggins had been arrested for possession of marijuana 
while with the Dodgers.[2] After having spent most of his minor league 
career as an infielder, he was used almost exclusively as an outfielder 
with the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League in 1981.[9] He batted 
.302 with 73 steals,[13] and received a September call-up to the major 
leagues. In his first stint with the Padres, he got five hits in 14 at 
bats.[1] Wiggins began the following season with the Islanders,[9] but 
he was called up again by the Padres in early May to replace injured outfielder 
Gene Richards.[17] Wiggins was leading San Diego with 29 stolen bases in 
59 games when he was arrested for possession of cocaine in July.[17] He 
was issued a 30-day suspension from baseball, and spent a month in a substance 
abuse treatment facility.[18] The Padres, who were one of the first sports 
teams to offer an employee assistance program to its players, paid for 
all of his treatment,[19] and he returned to the team in September.[20] 
By 1983, Wiggins had become a regular in the Padres lineup. He batted in 
the leadoff spot, playing in the outfield for most of the season.[1] Though 
he was exceptional on defense in left field,[21] he was moved to first 
base for the last 45 games of the year after Steve Garvey suffered a broken 
thumb.[22] He hit .276 and picked up 139 hits that year.[1] His 66 stolen 
bases, good for second in the league, broke the Padres single-season record 
of 61 set by Richards in 1980.[1][2][23] Wiggins was named the team's most 
valuable player that season.[2] Wiggins was moved to second base in 1984.[1] 
That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield.[24] Until 
that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already 
had a strong player there with Garvey, and they wanted to get Martínez's 
bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production.[21][25] 
Wiggins retained the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony 
Gwynn.[26] During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB 
player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record.[27] In an August 
game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins 
was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual 
Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with 
brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and 
several ejections.[28] Wiggins finished second in the league in runs scored 
(106), establishing a Padres single-season record and helping the team 
to their first division championship. He finished the season with 70 steals, 
extending his team record from the previous season.[1][29] Benefitting 
from the higher number of fastballs opposing pitchers threw in response 
to Wiggins' speed,[30] Gwynn batted above .400 when his speedy teammate 
was on base, and hit .351 overall for the first of his eight career batting 
titles.[31][32] The duo was one of the biggest reasons behind San Diego's 
success.[33] They could score fast with Wiggins getting on first, stealing 
second, and Gwynn singling him home.[34] Wiggins batted .316 in the 1984 
NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, going two-for-three with two runs scored 
in the fifth and deciding game.[35] In the 1984 World Series against the 
Detroit Tigers, Wiggins batted .364 and scored twice. His eight hits were 
the most of any Padres player in the series. The Tigers defeated the Padres 
in five games.[36] According to manager Dick Williams, Wiggins was "absolutely 
the most valuable player in the National League in 1984".[37] Before the 
1985 season, the Padres signed Wiggins to a four-year contract extension 
worth nearly $3 million. His agent described him as one of the highest-paid 
NL second basemen.[38] Wiggins missed the last two weeks of spring training 
after injuring his knee during a double-play attempt on defense when a 
baserunner slid into him. He was unavailable for the start of the season, 
but returned to the lineup after being out for five games.[39] Wiggins 
was batting .054 and without a stolen base two weeks into the season, when 
he was suspended by the Padres following a relapse into cocaine dependency.[40] 
After Wiggins completed a drug rehabilitation program, the Padres did not 
want to reactivate him, but baseball's joint review board cleared him to 
return to baseball. In June, Donald Fehr of the Major League Baseball Players 
Association (MLBPA) announced that he intended to file a grievance against 
the Padres if they did not promptly activate Wiggins. The Padres sought 
to trade Wiggins, and the Baltimore Orioles showed interest. As the trade 
deadline approached, however, the Orioles were reportedly only offering 
two minor league players in exchange for Wiggins.[41] On June 27, 1985, 
Wiggins was traded to the Orioles for pitchers Roy Lee Jackson and Richard 
Caldwell.[1] Padres owner Joan Kroc said that the team had warned Wiggins 
that he would not remain with the team if he had further problems with 
drugs. She stated that it would have been self-serving to keep Wiggins 
after his relapse when he could instead pursue a fresh start with another 
team.[42] Nonetheless, Gwynn felt that Wiggins had been shortchanged by 
the Padres.[42] Wiggins spent a few days in the minor leagues before being 
called up to Baltimore. In his first game with the Orioles, he started 
at second base and was the team's leadoff hitter, reaching base three times, 
driving in a run and scoring a run. After the game, Wiggins commented that 
he felt welcome on the team and did not feel like he was starting out with 
anything to prove.[43] In 76 games for Baltimore that year, Wiggins hit 
.285, scored 43 runs and finished eighth in the American League with 30 
stolen bases.[1] That year, he was sometimes criticized for perceived laziness. 
Wiggins later said that he had been depressed because he missed his wife 
and children, who were still living in San Diego.[44] In 1986, Wiggins 
fell into disfavor with manager Earl Weaver.[45] His contentious behavior 
had alienated many of his teammates. At the height of his difficulties, 
Wiggins was tagged out with the hidden ball trick. The next day, he made 
three errors, two of which occurred in the same inning. After the two-error 
inning, Baltimore fans booed as portions of his picture were revealed on 
the scoreboard during a "Who Am I" feature at the ballpark. Wiggins was 
angered at the response of the fans because he had family members at the 
game that day.[37] Weaver said that Wiggins "had more chances than anyone 
who ever wore an Orioles' uniform".[37] He batted .251 with 21 stolen bases 
and 30 runs scored, played only 71 games, and was reassigned to the Triple-A 
Rochester Red Wings at one point in the season.[9] The following season, 
Cal Ripken, Sr., replaced Weaver as manager of the Orioles. Baltimore signed 
Rick Burleson to play second base and Ray Knight to play third base. The 
moves seemed to leave Wiggins battling for an outfield spot, but after 
he hit .413 during spring training, Ripken made comments that suggested 
he was thinking of using Wiggins as a utility player. Just before the season 
started, Wiggins was not happy with Ripken's idea of using him in a utility 
role, feeling that his spring performance should have secured him a starting 
position. He believed that he could be an asset in the leadoff batting 
slot.[46] At the start of the 1987 regular season, Wiggins spent some time 
as a designated hitter (DH) and shared second base duties with Burleson.[47][48] 
Rookie second baseman Billy Ripken joined the club on July 10. Burleson 
was cut, but general manager Hank Peters said, "We're not bringing [Billy 
Ripken] up here to sit on the bench."[49] Wiggins was hitting .242 on July 
10, and he played mostly DH after the rookie's arrival.[47] In early August, 
Wiggins received a three-day suspension after he got into an altercation 
with teammate Jim Dwyer and grabbed the shirt of Ripken Sr.[50] On September 
1, MLB indefinitely suspended Wiggins for a behavior issue. An anonymous 
Orioles official told the media that the suspension resulted from a positive 
drug screen.[51] Wiggins was released from the Orioles on September 29. 
The Orioles had to pay him two-thirds of his $800,000 salary for 1988.[52] 
He was hitting .232 at the time of his release.[1] MLBPA officials announced 
that they would not issue grievances related to Wiggins' suspension or 
his subsequent release, noting that Wiggins wanted to be released by that 
point.[53] Though Wiggins did not give up hope for a return to baseball, 
he began to study the real-estate market after his suspension from the 
game. In the late 1980s, Wiggins began to suffer from health difficulties 
related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while 
he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, 
and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children.[2] 
He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work.[54] 
Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck 
by his visible weight loss.[16] In his final months, he sold his home in 
Poway, California, moving to Pasadena. Though he often stayed with friends, 
some of his longtime friends felt that he died in seclusion, embarrassed 
by what had happened with his life.[2] In November 1990, Wiggins was hospitalized 
with pneumonia and tuberculosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 
After lapsing in and out of consciousness for a month, he died at the hospital 
on January 6, 1991.[55] Wiggins' family initially attributed his death 
to lung cancer that had led to respiratory failure.[56] Family members 
said that he had gotten sick with a cough and that his condition had worsened 
quickly.[16] Wiggins weighed under 75 pounds at the time of his death.[2] 
Several days later, a physician disclosed that Wiggins' health problems 
were complications of AIDS.[55] Wiggins stated that he had contracted the 
disease via intravenous drug use.[57] He became the first baseball player 
known to have died from AIDS.[58] After Wiggins died, several well-known 
baseball figures commented on his death. Longtime Oriole Frank Robinson 
said, "He was a very bright individual, and you could like the guy. But 
there was always something there to back you off."[54] Former Padres player 
Garry Templeton said that he might have been Wiggins' closest friend, but 
he said that he did not know that Wiggins had been ill.[54] Wiggins is 
buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.[1] Wiggins 
met his wife Angela when they were in junior high school, and they both 
graduated from John Muir High School.[59] Two of Wiggins' three children 
became professional basketball players. Candice was an All-American at 
Stanford University and joined the Minnesota Lynx as the third overall 
pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. She has served as a spokesperson for the Greater 
Than AIDS campaign.[60] Alan, Jr., played college basketball at the University 
of San Francisco and has played professionally in several countries.[61][62] 
His oldest daughter, Cassandra, played basketball in college as well at 
New York University.[63] The Los Angeles Times reported that Wiggins had 
experienced marital strife, but that he would not entertain the thought 
of divorce; he wanted to ensure that his children did not grow up in a 
single-parent household like he did. Wiggins and his mother were very close, 
and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease diagnosis may have contributed to his 
drug problems. He was devastated that she would not be able to enjoy his 
success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he 
enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took 
his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult 
time with his father's death in May 1990.[2] Wiggins enjoyed stubbornly 
engaging in debates with his teammates, particularly Padres teammate Eric 
Show, just to provoke reactions from them.[2] Tony Gwynn suggested that 
Wiggins was sometimes misunderstood. "To not like Alan Wiggins, is to not 
know Alan Wiggins," Gwynn said.[2][16] Wiggins' agent, Tony Attanasio, 
said that Wiggins became deeply depressed in Baltimore. He had always been 
reserved and had a difficult time trusting other people.[2] Attanasio said 
that Orioles players often actively avoided Wiggins. While Wiggins enjoyed 
reading books and newspapers, Attanasio said that teammates were turned 
off by his intellect.[16][55] The Orioles once gave an IQ test, and Wiggins 
scored higher than everyone except for Weaver. According to Attanasio, 
players in Baltimore also resented Wiggins because he replaced Rich Dauer, 
who had been a well-liked member of the team. Lee Lacy was one of his only
