Fredric Michael "Fred" Lynn (born February 3, 1952) is a former center 
fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Boston Red Sox (1974–1980), 
California Angels (1981–1984), Baltimore Orioles (1985–1988), Detroit Tigers 
(1988–1989) and San Diego Padres (1990). He is best known for being the 
first player to win the Rookie of the Year award and MVP in the same season. 
Lynn was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002 and to the 
College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.[1] Lynn represented the United States 
at the 1971 Pan American Games, where he won a silver medal.[2] After graduation 
from USC, Lynn started his career for the Red Sox with a 1975 season in 
which he won the Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards, the 
first player to win both in the same season. (The feat was duplicated by 
then-Seattle Mariners right fielder Ichiro Suzuki in 2001.) Lynn and fellow 
rookie outfielder Jim Rice were dubbed as the "Gold Dust Twins". In 1975, 
Lynn led the American League in doubles, runs scored and slugging percentage, 
finished second in the batting race with a .331 average, and won a Gold 
Glove Award for his defensive play. On June 18 at Tiger Stadium, he hit 
three home runs, had 10 RBI, and 16 total bases in one game. Fred Lynn's 
career was hampered by some injuries caused by fearless play, such as a 
broken rib from crashing into an outfield wall, or knee injuries from breaking 
up double plays,and playing all out defensively. Lynn won three more Gold 
Gloves in 1978-80 and finished fourth in the 1979 MVP voting; he won the 
AL Batting title in that same year. ( 1979) while being elected to the 
All-Star team every year with the Red Sox, and nine time All Star over 
his career. He hit a home run in three All-Star games for the Red Sox, 
in 1976, 1979, and 1980 and hit the only grand slam in All-Star history 
in 1983. The Red Sox traded him along with Steve Renko to the Angels for 
Frank Tanana, Jim Dorsey and Joe Rudi after the 1980 season.[3] He never 
hit over .300 again. Lynn did go on to hit more than 20 home runs in six 
consecutive seasons starting in 1982, and was selected MVP of the 1982 
American League Championship Series, the first player from the losing team 
ever selected. In 1983, he hit the only grand slam in All-Star history 
and was named MVP after being elected to the team for the ninth consecutive 
year. His four home runs in All-Star games is second only to Stan Musial. 
In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 
100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Following the 1984 season, Lynn 
signed with the Orioles, who signed numerous free agents in the mid-1980s 
in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to win another World Series after 
their 1983 title. Lynn never played more than 150 games in a season and 
only topped 140 games four times. From 1982–1988, his home run totals were 
21-22-23-23-23-23-25. His four consecutive years with exactly 23 home runs 
tied Ken Boyer (24 each year for Cardinals from 1961–1964) for most consecutive 
years with exactly the same number of home runs (based on 20 or more home 
runs); Adam Dunn later matched this mark with 40 each year from 2005–2008. 
Detroit acquired Lynn for their 1988 pennant drive, which also proved unsuccessful. 
There was some initial controversy with this trade; though the trade was 
made on the day of the trading deadline, while Lynn was en route to Detroit, 
he was technically not in "Detroit airspace" when the deadline passed, 
so he was ruled ineligible for the postseason. MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent 
later overruled this decision, declaring that as long as the transaction 
was completed by the deadline, the player need not physically be in the 
new team's city to be eligible to play in the playoffs. Following a disappointing 
1989 season, Lynn ended his career with one season in San Diego (1990), 
retiring at the age of 38. His 306 career home runs place him ninth among 
center fielders, behind Willie Mays, Ken Griffey, Jr., Mickey Mantle, Duke 
Snider, Dale Murphy, Joe DiMaggio, Jim Edmonds, and Andruw Jones. In his 
17-year career, Lynn batted .283 with 1111 RBI, 1960 hits, 1063 runs, 306 
home runs, 388 doubles, 43 triples, and 72 stolen bases in 1969 games. 
Lynn has raised thousands of dollars through charity work, for Child Haven 
( a home for abused and neglected children) and the animal charity, FACE 
Foundation. Lynn recorded a hit on the first pitch off Lee Smith for the 
All-Star Legends softball game in St. Louis (2009). Both appeared in the 
1983 All-Star Game as opponents. Lynn also hit a home run in the 2010 All-Star 
Legends softball game in Anaheim and had many hits in subsequent Legends 
Softball games. Lynn worked as a baseball color analyst for ESPN from 1991–98, 
doing some College World Series games and some West Coast MLB games. He 
has also been a spokesman for Gillette and MasterCard, and occasionally 
entertains clients at Red Sox games from the Legends Skybox at Fenway Park. 
Fred was elected into the USC Hall of Fame in 1994, The Ted Williams Hitters 
Hall of Fame in 2011 and became of member of the All-Fenway Team in 2012.
