Dickie Ray Noles (born November 19, 1956) was a pitcher for the Philadelphia 
Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, 
and Baltimore Orioles. Today Dickie Noles is a born-again Christian and 
works for the Philadelphia Phillies. Noles was an effective relief pitcher 
for the Phillies' 1980 World Series championship team. In Game 4 of that 
series, Noles came on in relief of Larry Christenson in the first inning 
with only one out and the Phillies down 4–0 to the Kansas City Royals. 
Noles pitched the next 4 2⁄3 innings and gave up another run, but is most 
remembered for throwing a fastball under George Brett's chin in the fourth 
inning that prompted a warning by the umpires to both teams. Brett struck 
out in the at-bat and had only three singles and one RBI the remainder 
of the series. The brushback incident is looked upon as the turning point 
in that series for the Phillies. Before the 1982 season, Noles was traded 
along with Keith Moreland to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Mike Krukow and 
cash. Noles had an effective season as a starter in 1982, going 10–13. 
In early 1983, however, Noles' alcohol problems began to surface. He and 
a Cubs' teammate drunkenly assaulted a police officer after a game and 
Noles severely injured his left knee. Noles spent 16 days in jail, was 
forced to enter alcohol rehabilitation, and was forced to pay a substantial 
amount of his baseball earnings in an ensuing civil suit.[1] Noles reports 
that he has been sober since April 9, 1983, the date of the incident.[2] 
In 1987, Noles became one of only four players in history to be "traded 
for themselves", joining Harry Chiti, Brad Gulden, and John McDonald. Noles 
was traded from the Cubs to the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named 
later. 33 days later, the teams were unable to agree on what player Chicago 
would receive, and so Noles was shipped back to the Cubs, completing a
