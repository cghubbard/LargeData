Luis Ernesto Aparicio Montiel (born April 29, 1934), nicknamed "Little 
Louie", was the first Venezuelan professional baseball player to be inducted 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, in 1984.[1][2] He was one of the 
most dominant shortstops of Major League Baseball (MLB) in his era. He 
played for the Chicago White Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Boston Red Sox, 
from 1956 through 1973.[2][3] Aparicio won the American League (AL) Rookie 
of the Year Award in 1956. He helped the "Go-Go" White Sox win the American 
League Pennant championship in 1959 and was the AL Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) runner-up that season (he led the AL in stolen bases, putouts, assists, 
and fielding as shortstop). He was an AL All-Star for ten seasons,[4][a] 
an AL stolen base leader for 9 consecutive seasons, and an AL Gold Glove 
winner for 9 seasons.[5]Baseball legend Ted Williams called Aparicio "the 
best shortstop he had ever seen".[6] He was nominated for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team (one-hundred greatest players) in 1999.[2][7] 
Born in Maracaibo, Zulia State, Venezuela, Aparicio came from a baseball 
family.[3] His father, Luis Aparicio, Sr., was a notable shortstop in Venezuela 
and owned a Winter League team with Aparicio's uncle, Ernesto Aparicio.[8] 
At the age of 19, Aparicio was selected as a member of the Venezuelan team 
in the 1953 Amateur World Series held in Caracas.[3] He signed to play 
for the local professional team in Maracaibo alongside his father in 1953. 
In a symbolic gesture during the team's 1953 home opener, his father led 
off as the first hitter of the game, took the first pitch, and had Aparicio 
Jr. take his place at bat.[3] The Cleveland Indians had been negotiating 
to sign Aparicio, but Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg expressed 
the opinion that he was too small to play in the major leagues.[3] Chicago 
White Sox General Manager Frank Lane, on the recommendation of fellow Venezuelan 
shortstop Chico Carrasquel, then signed Aparicio for $5,000 down and $5,000 
in first year salary.[9] After only two years in the minor leagues, he 
made his major league debut in 1956, replacing Carrasquel as the White 
Sox shortstop.[3] Aparicio would lead the American League in stolen bases, 
assists, and putouts, and won both the Rookie of the Year and The Sporting 
News Rookie of the Year awards.[2][10][11] He was the first Latin American 
player to win the Rookie of the Year award.[3] Aparicio quickly became 
an integral member of the Go-Go White Sox teams of the mid-1950s, who were 
known for their speed and strong defense. Over the next decade, Aparicio 
set the standard for the spray-hitting, slick-fielding, speedy shortstop.[8] 
He combined with second baseman Nellie Fox to become one of the best double 
play combinations in major league baseball.[12][13] Aparicio once again 
led the American League in stolen bases and assists in 1957 as the White 
Sox would hold first place until late June before finishing the season 
in second place behind the New York Yankees.[12][14] In 1958, Aparicio 
earned recognition as one of the top shortstops in major league baseball 
when he was selected to be the starting shortstop for the American League 
in the 1958 All-Star Game.[15] The White Sox would once again finish the 
season in second place behind the Yankees, after being in last place on 
June 14.[16] Aparicio again led the league in stolen bases, assists and 
putouts, and would win his first Gold Glove Award.[2][17] Aparicio was 
the team leader when the "Go Go" White Sox won the American League pennant 
in 1959, finishing the regular season five games ahead of the Cleveland 
Indians.[18] Aparicio finished the runner-up to team-mate Nellie Fox in 
the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting.[19] He was selected 
as a starting All-Star for the second time and also won a second Gold Glove 
award.[20][21] He posted a .308 batting average in the 1959 World Series 
as the White Sox were defeated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in a six-game 
series.[22] When Aparicio stole fifty bases in his first sixty-one attempts 
in 1959, the term "Aparicio double" was coined to represent a walk and 
a stolen base.[23] In 1960 and 1961, Aparicio continued to be one of the 
top shortstops in the American League, finishing at or near the top in 
fielding percentage and assists. In 1962, he showed up overweight and had 
an off year and the White Sox offered him a reduction in salary for the 
1963 season.[24] An enraged Aparicio said that he would quit rather than 
accept a decrease in pay and demanded to be traded.[24] The White Sox eventually 
traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Al Smith for Hoyt Wilhelm, Ron 
Hansen, Dave Nicholson and Pete Ward in January 1963.[25] Aparicio regained 
his form in Baltimore and continued to lead the league in stolen bases 
and in fielding percentage, producing a career-high .983 fielding percentage 
in 1963.[2] Together with Brooks Robinson and Jerry Adair, he was part 
of one of the best defensive infields in baseball.[26][27] In 1964, he 
would lead the league in stolen bases for a ninth consecutive year and 
win his sixth Gold Glove Award.[2][28] Aparicio posted a .278 batting average 
with 178 hits in 1966, second-most hits in the league behind Tony Oliva 
and won a seventh Gold Glove Award as the Orioles clinched their first 
American League pennant.[29][30][31] He finished ninth in the American 
League Most Valuable Player Award balloting and helped the Orioles sweep 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1966 World Series.[32][33] Aparicio returned 
to the White Sox for the 1968 season after being traded for Don Buford.[25] 
He continued to play well defensively, leading the league in range factor 
in 1968 and 1969.[2] Aparicio had his best overall offensive season in 
1970, scoring 86 runs and finishing fourth in the American League batting 
race with a career-high .313 average.[2] In addition, he earned his eighth 
All-Star berth that year, as well as his ninth Gold Glove.[34][35] Despite 
the White Sox finishing in last place, Aparicio finished 12th in the 1970 
American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting.[36][37] In December 
1970, after three seasons with the White Sox, he was traded to the Boston 
Red Sox for Luis Alvarado and Mike Andrews.[25] In 1971, Aparicio was one 
at bat from tying the longest Major League hitless streak for non-pitchers 
held by Bill Bergen with 45, set in 1909 with Brooklyn Superbas, by going 
without a hit in 44 at bats.[38] Aparicio then hit a grand slam home run 
against the Indians in Cleveland and then led off a night game at Fenway 
with another home run.[39] He hit for a career-low .232 batting average 
that year.[2] In 1972, Aparicio made a late-season baserunning blunder 
that contributed to the Red Sox losing the 1972 American League Eastern 
Division title by half a game to the Detroit Tigers.[40] In his last year 
as an active player in 1973, Aparicio would hit for a .271 average and 
steal his 500th base, against the New York Yankees, on July 5.[41] He retired 
at the end of the season at the age of 39.[2] Aparicio played for 18 major 
league seasons in 2,599 games, accumulating 2,677 hits in 10,230 at bats 
for a .262 career batting average along with 394 doubles, 83 home runs, 
791 runs batted in, 1,335 runs and 506 stolen bases.[2] He ended his career 
with a .972 fielding percentage.[2] Aparicio led American League shortstops 
eight times in fielding percentage, seven times in assists, and four times 
in range factor and putouts.[2] He led the American League in stolen bases 
in nine consecutive seasons (1956–64) and won the Gold Glove Award nine 
times (1958–62, 1964, 1966, 1970).[2][42][43] Aparicio was also a ten-time 
(ten seasons) All Star[2][44] (1958–64, 1970–72); he was named to 13 out 
of 14 All-Star Games (MLB held two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962), 
and was the starting shortstop in six All-Star games and played in 10 games 
(he didn't play in the second All-Star game in 1960 and was injured and 
replaced in the 1964 and 1972 games and didn't play). At the time of his 
retirement, Aparicio was the all-time leader for most games played, assists 
and double plays by a shortstop and the all-time leader for putouts and 
total chances by an American League shortstop.[1] His nine Gold Glove Awards 
set an American League record for shortstops, that was tied by Omar Vizquel 
in 2001.[43] He tied the record of most seasons leading the league in fielding 
average by shortstops with 8, previously set by Everett Scott and Lou Boudreau.[45] 
His 2,583 games played at shortstop stood as the Major League record for 
that position from his retirement in 1973 until May 2008 when it was surpassed 
by Omar Vizquel.[45] His 2,677 hits was also the major league record for 
players from Venezuela, until it was surpassed by Omar Vizquel on June 
25, 2009.[citation needed] His 2,673 hits as a shortstop was a record until 
Derek Jeter broke it on August 17, 2009.[citation needed] He had 13 consecutive 
seasons with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting title 
and an on-base percentage less than .325, a major league record (His career 
OBP was slightly better than the shortstop average during his era; .311 
vs .309). A more impressive streak was his 16 straight seasons with more 
than 500 plate appearances, tied for fifth best in major league history. 
Aparicio never played any defensive position other than shortstop.[46] 
Aparicio was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, the 
first native of Venezuela to be honored.[1]The Chicago White Sox also retired 
Aparicio's uniform number 11 that year. In 2010, the White Sox gave number 
11 to shortstop Omar Vizquel, with Aparicio's permission. Vizquel said 
that wearing the number would preserve the name of a great Venezuelan shortstop. 
Aparicio commented, "If there is one player who I would like to see wear 
my uniform number with the White Sox, it is Omar Vizquel. I have known 
Omar for a long time. Along with being an outstanding player, he is a good 
and decent man."[47] In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included 
Aparicio in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. In 
1999, The Sporting News did not include him on their list of The Sporting 
News list of Baseball's 100 Greatest Players, but Major League Baseball 
did list him as one of their 100 nominees for their All-Century Team.[7] 
In 2003, Aparicio was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame 
and Museum.[48] In 2005, he was given the honor of throwing out the ceremonial 
first pitch at Game One of the 2005 World Series, the first World Series 
game to be played in Chicago by the Chicago White Sox since the 1959 World 
Series, when Aparicio had been the starting shortstop for the White Sox.[49] 
In 2004, the first annual Luis Aparicio Award was presented to the Venezuelan 
player who recorded the best individual performance in Major League Baseball, 
as voted on by sports journalists in Venezuela. In 2006, two bronze statues, 
one depicting Aparicio, the other depicting former White Sox second baseman 
Nellie Fox, were unveiled on the outfield concourse of U.S. Cellular Field 
in Chicago. Fox's statue shows him flipping a baseball toward Aparicio, 
while Aparicio's statue shows him preparing to receive the ball from Fox.[50] 
In 2007, Aparicio was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum 
Hall of Fame.[51] There is a stadium in Maracaibo, Venezuela, bearing his 
father's name. The full name of the stadium is Estadio Luis Aparicio El 
Grande (Luis Aparicio "the Great" Stadium) in honor to Luis Aparicio Ortega.[52] 
Also, the sports complex where the stadium is located is named Polideportivo 
Luis Aparicio Montiel. There are also several streets and avenues bearing
