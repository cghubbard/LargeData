As Player As Manager Andrew Lewis Cooper (April 24, 1898 – June 3, 1941), 
nicknamed "Lefty", was an American left-handed pitcher in baseball's Negro 
Leagues. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. An alumnus 
of Paul Quinn College in Waco, Cooper played nine seasons for the Detroit 
Stars and ten seasons for the Kansas City Monarchs. The Texan was 6 feet 
2 inches (188 cm) tall and weighed 220 pounds (100 kg; 16 st). In defiance 
of a threatened five-year Negro league ban for contract jumping, Cooper 
joined a 1927 barnstorming team that toured Hawaii and Japan. He spent 
most of his later career with the Monarchs. Cooper is the Negro league 
record holder for career saves. In a 1937 playoff game, he pitched 17 innings. 
Cooper served as manager or player-manager for the Monarchs from 1937 to 
1940, leading the team to the pennant three times during those four seasons. 
Cooper was born in Waco, Texas, and he attended A. J. Moore High School 
in Waco. He continued his education locally at Paul Quinn College.[1] Cooper 
pitched for the Detroit Stars from 1920 to 1927. The Stars played in Mack 
Park, which was noted for its short fences. Despite the hitter-friendly 
dimensions of the park, Cooper excelled as a pitcher in Detroit.[2] The 
short fences often allowed Detroit's powerful hitters to provide good run 
support for Cooper.[3] In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, 
James characterized Cooper as the best Negro league pitcher of 1923.[4] 
Cooper was traded to the Kansas City Monarchs for five players in 1928.[2] 
He became known for his durability as a pitcher. To open the 1928 season, 
the left-hander pitched a two-hit shutout against the Cleveland Tigers, 
which he followed with a 4-3 win over the Tigers the next day.[5] Cooper 
returned to the Stars for another season in 1930. In nine years with the 
Stars, he earned a 92-47 record.[6] He rejoined the Monarchs in 1931. One 
of his best years was 1936, when he went 27–8 against all levels of competition. 
He made his only All-Star appearance that season, as Negro league All-Star 
games had not been played until three years earlier.[5] Cooper became player-manager 
of the Monarchs in 1937. The Monarchs joined the newly formed Negro American 
League (NAL) that year.[7] Nearing the end of his career, Cooper pitched 
17 innings in a playoff game that year versus the Chicago American Giants.[8] 
Cooper gave up two runs in the first inning of the game, but he pitched 
16 subsequent scoreless innings. In Black Baseball in Kansas City, Cooper 
was described as having "more junk than Fred Sanford", but he walked only 
one batter.[9] The game was declared a tie after the 17th inning, but the 
Monarchs won the playoff series four games to one with the one tie.[7] 
Cooper became known for his ability to alter the speed of his pitches.[3] 
He threw a fastball, a curveball and a screwball.[10] He also had a well-known 
pickoff move.[11] He posted a 116–57 career record and went 72–30 over 
a six-year span. He often pitched three games in a five-game series, starting 
two and relieving another. He holds the Negro league career record for 
saves (29). Negro league historian Dick Clark called Cooper the greatest 
pitcher to play for Detroit, either for the Stars or the Tigers.[10] By 
1940, Cooper had managed the team to three pennants.[11] Negro league star 
Buck O'Neil said that Cooper and Kansas City owner J. L. Wilkinson were 
responsible for O'Neil joining the NAL and ultimately becoming a member 
of the Monarchs. In 1937, Cooper and Wilkinson were impressed by O'Neil 
but the team had a first baseman who was returning from an injury. They 
encouraged O'Neil to sign with the Memphis Red Sox. The Monarchs traded 
their first baseman the next year and purchased O'Neil's contract from 
Memphis.[12] Cooper also played several seasons of winter baseball. He 
played in Cuba during the winters of 1923-24, 1924–25 and 1928–29;[13] 
he compiled a 15-17 record there. By 1927, player pay had been cut and 
morale was low in the NNL and the Eastern Colored League (ECL). To limit 
the options of the players, the leagues announced a five-year ban on any 
contract-jumping players. Cooper and three other Negro league players - 
Biz Mackey, Rap Dixon and Frank Duncan - decided to test the ban. They 
joined a traveling all-star team, the Philadelphia Royal Giants, in a four-month 
barnstorming tour of Japan.[14] The team traveled by ocean liner and it 
took 20 days to arrive in Japan. On their return, they played some games 
in Honolulu. The team won all 23 games they played on the tour.[15] Upon 
his return, Cooper received a 30-day suspension and a $200 fine.[14] Cooper 
went barnstorming in the Pacific with the Royal Giants in 1932-33. The 
team earned a 47-2-1 record as they visited the Philippines, China, Korea 
and Japan. Cooper recorded a .342 batting average on the trip. The next 
year, he accompanied the Royal Giants to Japan, China, the Philippines 
and Hawaii for a four-month, 35-game trip.[16] Cooper had one son, Andy 
Cooper Jr.[2] According to reports in the Chicago Defender, Cooper reportedly 
suffered a stroke early in the 1941 pre-season. He left for his home in 
Waco to rest and recover, leaving Newt Allen as interim manager, but suffered 
a fatal heart attack on June 3, having never returned to the Monarchs. 
He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Waco.[1] Cooper was inducted into 
the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. His Hall of Fame class included 17 black 
players and executives from the Negro league or pre-Negro league eras. 
A special committee had been formed that year to select the group, and 
it narrowed down a pool of 39 candidates to arrive at the final selections.[17] 
The 109th United States Congress issued a resolution that year honoring 
the 2006 Negro league and pre-Negro league inductees.[18] As of 2014, Cooper 
is one of eleven inductees whose plaques do not depict them wearing a cap 
with a team logo.[19] In 2014, Cooper made the final ballot for election
