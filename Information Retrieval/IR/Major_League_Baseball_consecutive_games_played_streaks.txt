Listed below are the longest consecutive games played in Major League Baseball 
history. To compile such a streak, a player must appear in every game played 
by his team. The streak is broken if the team completes a game in which 
the player neither takes a turn at bat nor plays a half-inning in the field. 
The record of playing in 2,632 consecutive games over more than 16 years 
is held by Cal Ripken, Jr. of the Baltimore Orioles. Ripken surpassed Lou 
Gehrig of the New York Yankees, whose record of 2,130 consecutive games 
had stood for 56 years. Before Gehrig, the record was held by Everett Scott 
(1,307 consecutive games), a shortstop with the Red Sox and Yankees whose 
streak ended in 1925, less than a month before Gehrig's began. Scott broke 
the previous record which was established by George Pinkney (577 consecutive 
games) from 1885–1890. The record for a National League player is held 
by Steve Garvey of the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres (1975–1983), 
though Garvey's 1,207-game streak is less than half the length of Ripken's. 
Previous holders of the National League record include Billy Williams of 
the Chicago Cubs (1963–1970), Stan Musial of the St. Louis Cardinals (1952–1957), 
and Gus Suhr of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1931–1937). Of the top 17 streaks 
on this list, 9 were compiled by members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Two others are separate streaks compiled by Pete Rose, who was named one 
of the top 30 players of the 20th century but is banned from the Hall of 
Fame. Minimum 500 consecutive games played[1][2] MLB's rule 10.23(c), defining 
consecutive game streaks, is as follows: "A consecutive game playing streak 
shall be extended if the player plays one half inning on defense, or if 
he completes a time at bat by reaching base or being put out. A pinch running 
appearance only shall not extend the streak. If a player is ejected from 
a game by an umpire before he can comply with the requirements of this 
rule, his streak shall continue."[7] Thus it is possible for a pinch-runner 
to enter a game and record a statistic—steal a base, be caught stealing, 
or score a run—without being credited with a (consecutive) game played. 
Indeed, Juan Pierre appeared in 821 consecutive games from 2002 to 2007, 
but on June 3, 2005, he was used solely as a pinch runner. Under Rule 10.23(c), 
this resulted in separate games-played streaks of 386 and 434 games. [8] 
Similarly, a fielder can field a ball in play, make a putout or an assist, 
and even commit an error, without being credited with a (consecutive) game 
played. For example, Hideki Matsui's consecutive games streak was ended 
when he broke his wrist diving for a ball with two outs in the first inning 
of the Yankee game of May 11, 2006. That game would have been #519 in his 
MLB streak and #1,769 in his MLB/Japan game streak (see below), but since 
Matsui did not play a full half inning on defense, that game is not counted 
in his streak. MLB and the Society for American Baseball Research[9] both 
credit Matsui with having played 518 consecutive MLB games. Lou Gehrig's 
streak started as a pinch-hitter. The next day he started at first base 
in place of slumping Wally Pipp[10] and stayed there for fourteen years. 
On July 14, 1934, Gehrig, suffering from an attack of lumbago, was listed 
in the Yankee lineup at shortstop. He batted in the top of the first inning 
to preserve the streak, singled, and was promptly removed from the game.[11][12] 
Gehrig's streak was ended by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the disease 
that would take his life. His physical abilities rapidly declining, Gehrig 
told manager Joe McCarthy to take him out of the lineup on May 2, 1939. 
He never played again, dying in 1941. Garvey's streak was ended when he 
dislocated his thumb in a home plate collision against the Atlanta Braves.[13] 
Scott's streak was ended when Manager Miller Huggins benched him in favor 
of Pee Wee Wanninger. Ripken says that the closest he ever came to not 
playing during his streak was the day after he twisted his knee during 
a bench-clearing brawl against the Seattle Mariners in June 1993.[14] When 
the 1994–95 player's strike threatened to destroy Ripken's streak as baseball 
owners planned to use replacement players, Baltimore owner Peter Angelos 
announced that the Orioles would rather not field a team than see Ripken's 
streak snapped.[15] The replacement player scenario never came to pass, 
as the remainder of the 1994 season—including the World Series—was cancelled 
due to the strike. Ripken broke Gehrig's record on September 6, 1995.[16] 
Ripken himself made the decision not to play on September 20, 1998, the 
Orioles' last home game of the season. Rookie Ryan Minor played third base 
for Ripken in a 5–4 loss to the Yankees.[17] Ripken's record is considered 
by many to be unbreakable.[18][19] Miguel Tejada's streak ended after Doug 
Brocail hit Tejada on the wrist with a pitch on June 20, 2007. During the 
game on June 21, Tejada took an at-bat in the top half of the first inning, 
bunting into a fielder's choice. He was removed from the game for a pinch 
runner, officially keeping the streak alive. But Tejada was then diagnosed 
with a broken wrist and went to the disabled list, ending his streak at 
1,152 games.[20][21] From June 5, 1982 to September 14, 1987, Ripken played 
8,264 consecutive innings, which is believed to be a record, although not 
one that is officially kept by MLB. The second-longest streak known to 
have occurred is 5,152 consecutive innings by George Pinkney from 1885 
to 1890. The World record for consecutive innings played is currently held 
by former Hanshin Tigers player and now coach Tomoaki Kanemoto playing 
1492 games without missing an inning[22] Hideki Matsui assembled a consecutive 
games streak of 1,768 games combined between the Japanese league Yomiuri 
Giants and the Major league New York Yankees, placing him behind only Ripken 
and Gehrig for streaks in top-flight professional baseball. The MLB portion 
of Matsui's streak lasted for 518 games and is a MLB record for consecutive 
games to start a player's career. The entire combined streak stretched 
from August 22, 1993, to May 10, 2006, and was ended by a wrist injury 
sustained during what would have been his 519th consecutive game (see above). 
The MLB portion of the streak extended from March 31, 2003 (opening day),
