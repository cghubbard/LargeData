The 1938 Philadelphia Phillies season was a season in American baseball. 
The team finished in eighth place – last in an eight-team National League 
– with a record of 45–105, 43 games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs 
and 24.5 games behind the seventh-place Brooklyn Dodgers. It was the first 
of five straight seasons in which the Phillies finished in last place. 
The Phillies wore blue and yellow on their uniforms in honor of the Tercentenary 
of New Sweden.[1] The Phillies moved from their old home park, Baker Bowl, 
to Shibe Park midway through the season. Phils president Gerald Nugent 
was eager to cut expenses and he cited the move as an opportunity for the 
Phillies to cut expenses by sharing stadium upkeep with the Philadelphia 
Athletics.[2] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters
