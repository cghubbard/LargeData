Kenneth R. Coleman (April 22, 1925 – August 21, 2003) was an American radio 
and television sportscaster for 38 years (1952–1989). A native of Quincy, 
Massachusetts and a graduate of Curry College, Coleman broke into broadcasting 
with the NFL Cleveland Browns (1952–1965), calling play-by-play of every 
touchdown that Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown ever scored. He also 
began his MLB broadcasting career in Cleveland, calling Cleveland Indians 
games on television for ten seasons (1954–1963). In his first year with 
the Indians, Coleman called their record-setting 111-win season and their 
World Series loss to the New York Giants. In 1965, Coleman got a job with 
the Boston Red Sox, replacing Curt Gowdy. He broadcast the 1967 World Series 
(which the Red Sox lost to the St. Louis Cardinals) for NBC television 
and radio. From 1975 to 1978 Coleman worked with the Cincinnati Reds' television 
crew. Coleman broadcast college football for various teams, including Ohio 
State, Harvard, and BU. He was the play-by-play announcer for the 1968 
Harvard-Yale football game, a game that will be forever be remembered for 
the incredible Harvard comeback from a 16-point deficit to tie Yale at 
29-29. He also called NFL games for NBC in the early 1970s, and later in 
his career called Connecticut and Fairfield basketball games for Connecticut 
Public Television. After the legendary radio combination of Ned Martin 
and Jim Woods were fired for failing to follow the dictates of sponsors 
following the 1978 season, Coleman returned to Boston in 1979. He broadcast 
the Red Sox' 1986 World Series loss to the New York Mets and two Red Sox 
ALCS (1986 and 1988). Coleman remained in the Red Sox radio booth until 
his retirement in 1989. Additionally, he wrote books on sportscasting, 
was one of the founding fathers of the Red Sox Booster Club and the BoSox 
Club, and was intimately involved with the Jimmy Fund, which raises money 
for cancer research. Coleman had the routine of taking a swim in the Atlantic 
Ocean as often as he could through the late fall and into the earliest 
days of spring, until his death. He was the father of the late Cleveland 
sports and newscaster Casey Coleman, who died in 2006 from pancreatic cancer. 
Coleman was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame on May 18, 2000 
at the age of 75. He died three years later, aged 78, in Plymouth, Massachusetts. 
In 1972, Coleman, along with Dick Stockton rotated play-by-play duties
