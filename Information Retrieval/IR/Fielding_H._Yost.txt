Fielding Harris Yost (April 30, 1871 – August 20, 1946) was an American 
football player and coach and college athletics administrator. He served 
as the head football coach at Ohio Wesleyan University (1897), the University 
of Nebraska–Lincoln (1898), the University of Kansas (1899), Stanford University 
(1900), San Jose State University (1900), and the University of Michigan 
(1901–1923, 1925–1926), compiling a career college football record of 198–35–12. 
During his 25 seasons as the head football coach in Ann Arbor, Yost's Michigan 
Wolverines won six national championships, captured ten Big Ten Conference 
titles, and amassed a record of 165–29–10. From 1901 to 1905, his "Point-a-Minute" 
squads went 55–1–1, outscoring their opponents by a margin of 2,821 to 
42. The 1901 team beat Stanford, 49–0, in the 1902 Rose Bowl, the first 
college football bowl game ever played. In 1921, Yost became Michigan's 
athletic director and served in that capacity until 1940. He was inducted 
into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.[1] Yost was 
born in Fairview, West Virginia, in April 1871. Yost's family had settled 
in West Virginia, in 1925. He was the oldest of four children of Parmenus 
(sometimes Permenus) Wesley Yost (1845–1920) and Elzena Jane (Ammons) Yost 
(1852–1943), both natives of West Virginia. His father was a farmer. Yost 
was educated in the local schools and became a deputy marshal in Fairview 
as a teenager.[2] Yost began his college education at Fairmont Normal School 
in Fairmont, West Virginia. He then taught school at Patterson Creek, West 
Virginia, during the 1889–90 school year.[2] Yost next enrolled at Ohio 
Normal School (now known as Ohio Northern University). Yost played for 
the Ohio Normal baseball team.[3] After three years at Ohio Normal, Yost 
returned to West Virginia to work in the oil fields. In 1895, Yost enrolled 
at West Virginia University where he studied law, receiving an LL.B. He 
also played football for West Virginia University football team.[4] A 6-foot, 
200 pounder, Yost was a standout at tackle at West Virginia into the 1896 
season. In October 1896, after his team lost three times to Lafayette in 
home games played on three different fields over the course of three days,[5][6] 
Yost became a remarkable personification of "if you can't beat 'em, join 
'em." He transferred in mid-season to join Coach Parke H. Davis's national 
championship team at Lafayette. Just a week after playing against Davis 
in West Virginia, Yost was playing for Davis in Lafayette's historic 6–4 
win over the Penn Quakers.[6] The fortuitous timing of Yost's appearance 
on the Lafayette roster did not go unnoticed by Penn officials. They called 
it "the Yost affair." The Philadelphia Ledger quoted Yost as saying that 
he came to Lafayette only to play football. The fact that Yost appeared 
in a Lafayette uniform only once, in the Penn game,[7] and that he returned 
to West Virginia within two weeks of the contest did not help appearances. 
He assured all concerned that he would return to Lafayette for at least 
three years of study.[8] Yost began his coaching career in 1897 at age 
26 as the football coach at Ohio Wesleyan University. The 1897 Ohio Wesleyan 
team compiled a 7–1–1 record, shut out six of its nine opponents, outscored 
all opponents by a combined total of 144 to 32, and won the Ohio Conference 
championship. On October 9, 1897, Yost's team played Michigan to a scoreless 
tie in Ann Arbor. In 1898, Yost was the head coach of the Nebraska football 
team that compiled an 8–3 record. The season included victories over Iowa 
State (23–10), Missouri (47–6), Kansas (18–6), and Colorado (23–10), and 
losses to Drake (6–5) and Iowa (6–5). In June 1899, the University of Kansas 
Athletic Association offered Yost $350 and an additional $150 conditionally 
to coach the school's football team.[9] Yost coached the 1899 Kansas team 
to an undefeated 10–0 record, outscoring opponents 280 to 37. The season 
included victories over the Haskell Indians (12–0 and 18–0), Nebraska (36–20), 
and Missouri (34–6). In May 1900, Yost was hired as the football coach 
at Stanford University,[10] and, after traveling home to West Virginia, 
he arrived in Palo Alto, California, on August 21, 1900.[11] Yost led the 
1900 Stanford team to a 7–2–1, outscoring opponents 154 to 20. Yost was 
hired in 1901 by Charles A. Baird as the head football coach for the Michigan 
Wolverines football team.[citation needed] Yost coached at Michigan from 
1901 through 1923, and again in 1925 and 1926. He was highly successful 
at Michigan, winning 165 games, losing only 29, and tying 10 for a winning 
percentage of .833. Under Yost, Michigan won four straight national championships 
from 1901 to 1904 and two more in 1918 and 1923. Yost's first Michigan 
team in 1901 outscored its opposition by a margin of 550–0 en route to 
a perfect season and victory in the inaugural Rose Bowl on January 1, 1902 
over Stanford, the team Yost had coached the year before. From 1901 to 
1904, Michigan did not lose a game, and was tied only once in a legendary 
game with the Minnesota Golden Gophers that led to the establishment of 
the Little Brown Jug, college football's oldest trophy. Before Michigan 
finally lost a game to Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons squad at the 
end of the 1905 season, they had gone 56 straight games without a defeat, 
the second longest such streak in college football history. During their 
first five seasons under Yost, Michigan outscored its opponents 2,821 to 
42,[12] earning the Michigan team the nickname "Point-a-Minute."[13] In 
tribute to the school where Yost began his coaching career, Yost arranged 
for Michigan to play its first game at Ferry Field (September 30, 1905) 
and its first game at Michigan Stadium (October 1, 1927) against Ohio Wesleyan.[14] 
After retiring from coaching, Yost remained at Michigan as the school's 
athletic director, a position he held until 1940, thereafter holding the 
title of athletic director emeritus. Under his leadership, Michigan Stadium, 
Yost Fieldhouse, now Yost Ice Arena, and the university's golf course were 
constructed. Yost invented the position of linebacker; co-created the first 
ever bowl game, the 1902 Rose Bowl, with then legendary UM athletic director 
Charles Baird; invented the fieldhouse concept that bears his name; and 
supervised the building of the first on-campus building dedicated to intramural 
sports.[citation needed] Arguably, no one has left a larger mark on University 
of Michigan athletics and varsity football than Fielding Yost. A longtime 
football coach and athletic director, his career was marked with great 
achievements both on and off the field. Yost was also a successful business 
person, lawyer, author, and a leading figure in pioneering the explosion 
of college football into a national phenomenon. A devout Christian, he 
nevertheless was among the first coaches to allow Jewish players on his 
teams, including Joe Magidsohn and Benny Friedman. However, Murray Sperber's 
book Shake Down the Thunder places principal responsibility for the Big 
Ten blackballing and boycotting of Notre Dame on Yost, as well as the charge 
that this was motivated by anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant prejudice common 
in the early 20th century. Although John Kyrk's book Natural Enemies points 
out that there was a bitter feud between Yost and Knute Rockne, head coach 
of the Notre Dame football team. Yost initiated the concept of coaching 
as an actual profession near the turn of the century when he was paid as 
much as a UM professor. The professionalization of coaches that started 
with Yost and earlier, Walter Camp at Yale University, symbolized how serious 
college football was becoming, and Yost symbolized this more so than any 
of his peers. It was Yost who first articulated the now accepted premise 
about student-athletes in the sport that: "Football builds character." 
Yost was also known for a series of admonitions to his players beginning 
with the words, "Hurry up," for example, "Hurry up and be the first man 
down the field on a punt or kick-off." This inclination earned him the 
nickname, "Hurry up" Yost. He also was an innovator of the hurry up offense. 
A native of West Virginia, Yost's unusual pronunciation of the school's 
name, "MEE-she-gan," copied by long-time Michigan football broadcaster 
Bob Ufer, is affectionately carried on by many Michigan football fans and 
often referenced by ESPN sportscaster Chris Fowler. Yost was among the 
inaugural class of inductees to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. 
Yost's all-time All-America backfield was Heston, Walter Eckersall, Jim 
Thorpe, and Elmer Oliphant.[15] No fewer than 72 men who either played 
for Yost or coached under him as an assistant went on to become head coaches 
in college football. Two, Benny Friedman and Tommy Hughitt, helmed teams 
in the National Football League (NFL). Yost's disciples include: Yost was 
in poor health for several years before his death and was hospitalized 
at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in May 1946.[19] He reportedly suffered 
from a stroke, but was released after two weeks and returned to his home 
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[20] In August 1946, Yost died of a gall bladder 
attack at his home. He was survived by his wife, whom he married in 1906, 
a son, Fielding H. Yost, Jr., two brothers, Ellis and Nichola, and a sister, 
Mrs. Charles Barry.[21] Yost was buried at Ann Arbor's Forest Hill Cemetery 
near the University of Michigan campus.[22] Gruver, Edward (2002), Nitschke.
