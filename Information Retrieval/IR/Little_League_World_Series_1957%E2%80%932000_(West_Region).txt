The West Region was a region that competed in the Little League World Series 
between 1957 and 2000 until it was split into the Northwest and West regions 
in 2001. The West Region was inaugurated in 1957.[1] The Region consisted 
of teams from Alaska, Arizona, Northern and Southern California, Colorado, 
Hawaii (after 1962), Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, 
Washington, and Wyoming. Before 1962, Hawaiian teams competed in the Pacific 
Region (see below). Prior to 1966, teams from Western Canada also competed 
in the West Region. Little League Baseball expanded the LLWS to sixteen 
teams for the 2001 Little League World Series. The West Region was split 
into the West region – Arizona, Northern California, Southern California, 
Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah – and the Northwest region – Alaska, 
Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. Colorado and 
New Mexico moved to the Southwest Region for the 2002 tournament. Between 
2002 and 2005, Hawaii competed in the Northwest region and Wyoming competed 
in the West region, before switching back to the original configuration 
in 2006. The following table indicates the West Region champion and its 
LLWS performance in each year between 1957 and 2000. A team from Hawaii 
represented the Pacific Region in the Little League World Series between 
1958 and 1961.[2] Between 1958 and 1960, the Hawaiian state champions received 
an automatic berth; in 1961, Hilo American Little League defeated a team 
from Japan in a playoff for the Pacific Region berth. Starting in 1962, 
teams from Japan competed in the Far East Region and Hawaii moved to the 
West Region. Total does not include Hawaii's four appearances representing
