The Radiology Associates Field at Jackie Robinson Ballpark (also known 
as Jackie Robinson Stadium or City Island Ball Park) is a historic baseball 
field in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. It is located at 105 East 
Orange Avenue on City Island, in the Halifax River. The ballpark, originally 
known as City Island Ball Park, opened in 1914. It consisted of a baseball 
field and a set of wooden bleachers. The present day grandstand and press 
box were built in 1962.[2] It is the home of the Daytona Tortugas and the 
Bethune-Cookman Wildcats. The Daytona Tortugas were founded in 1993. They 
have won six Florida State League championships, 1994, 2000, 2004, 2008, 
2011, and 2013. The Bethune-Cookman Wildcats have also achieved recent 
success, including six consecutive Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) 
baseball championships from 1999–2004, and seven more in 2006–2012. One 
reason the stadium is named for Jackie Robinson is the fact that Daytona 
Beach was the first Florida city to allow Robinson to play during the 1946 
season's spring training. Robinson was playing for the Triple-A Montreal 
Royals, who were in Florida to play an exhibition game against their parent 
club, the Brooklyn Dodgers. Both Jacksonville and Sanford refused to allow 
the game due to segregation laws. Daytona Beach permitted the game, which 
was played on March 17, 1946. This contributed to Robinson breaking the 
Major Leagues' color barrier the following year when he joined the Dodgers. 
The refusal by Jacksonville, previously the Dodgers' spring training home, 
led the team to host spring training in Daytona in 1947 and build Dodgertown 
in Vero Beach for the 1948 season. A statue of Robinson is now located 
at the south entrance to the ballpark. The ballpark was previously the 
home field of the Daytona Beach Islanders (1920–24, 1936–41, 1946–66, 1977, 
1985–1986), Daytona Beach Dodgers (1968–73), and Daytona Beach Astros (1978–84). 
The major league Montreal Expos conducted their spring training at the 
park from 1973–80. On October 22, 1998, the stadium was added to the United 
States National Register of Historic Places. This property is part of the 
Daytona Beach Multiple Property Submission, a Multiple Property Submission 
to the National Register. The stadium sustained heavy damage during Hurricane 
Donna in 1960. A $2 million historic renovation project was accelerated 
after Hurricane Floyd ripped off the metal roofs over the seating in 1999. 
In 2004, the ballpark suffered moderate damage during Hurricane Charley, 
causing several home games to be moved to Melching Field at Conrad Park
