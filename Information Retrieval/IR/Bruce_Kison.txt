Bruce Eugene Kison (born February 18, 1950) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher. He pitched from 1971–85 for three teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1971–79), California Angels (1980–84) and Boston Red Sox (1985). He won 
two World Series championships with the Pirates, both over the Baltimore 
Orioles. He batted and threw right-handed. During a 15-year career, Kison 
compiled 115 wins, 1,073 strikeouts, and a 3.66 ERA. When Bruce Kison pitched 
for Pasco High in 1968, he was already 6-foot-4½ and so slender that one 
manager later cracked he could look right through him.[citation needed] 
However, his size did have its advantages. When Kison uncoiled his long 
right arm and stretched out to the plate, there were very few right-handed 
hitters who could keep both feet in the batter's box. Kison also threw 
mostly sidearm back then and intimidation was as much a part of his game 
as his 95-mph fastball. He threw three no-hitters during his senior season 
at Pasco High School. Three years later, he was pitching for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Coming out of high school, Kison had hoped to play college baseball.[citation

a tryout camp in Sunnyside, Washington. Kison pitched a one-hitter June 
3, 1979, losing his no-hit bid when San Diego's Barry Evans doubled down 
the left field line with two out in the eighth. The Pirates hit 5 home 
runs that game in a 7 -0 victory on their way to the MLB title. Kison also 
had a no-hitter broken up in the ninth on April 23, 1980 while with the 
Angels. With his team leading the Minnesota Twins 17-0 at Metropolitan 
Stadium, Kison had the no-hit bid broken up by a Ken Landreaux double with 
one out; the hit was the only one Kison would allow. [1] The no-hitter 
would have been the most lopsided in modern-day Major League history; Frank 
Smith of the Chicago White Sox had no-hit the Detroit Tigers by a 15-0 
score on September 6, 1905. Kison was 30-9 in the minors and was called 
up in the middle of the 1971 season and was the winning pitcher when Pittsburgh 
beat San Francisco to make it into the World Series. He later became the 
winning pitcher in the first night game ever played in the classic. After 
tearing his rotator cuff during winter ball (which was usually a career-ending 
injury at the time), he spent 14 more years in the majors and changed his 
throwing motion.[citation needed] Kison also has spent time as pitching 
coach for both the Kansas City Royals and the Baltimore Orioles. A highly 
respected talent evaluator, Kison has spent the better part of the past
