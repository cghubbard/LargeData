The St. Louis Cardinals 1993 season was the team's 112th season in St. 
Louis, Missouri and the 102nd season in the National League. Under their 
manager Joe Torre, the Cardinals went 87-75 during the season and finished 
3rd in the National League East Division, ten games behind the NL Champion 
Philadelphia Phillies. This was the final season in the NL East for the 
Cardinals, before their move to the NL Central for the following season. 
Reliever Lee Smith became baseball's all-time saves leader this year, which 
has since been surpassed. On September 7 at Riverfront Stadium, Mark Whiten 
hit four massive home runs and had twelve runs batted in against the Cincinnati 
Reds.[3] In the process, Whiten tied two Major League records in one game. 
Gregg Jeffries finished third in the NL in batting (.342) and stole 46 
bases, a club record for a first baseman. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos
