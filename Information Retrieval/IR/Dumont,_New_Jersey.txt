comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on 
a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected 
directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council

basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year

system used in the state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government 
in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding 
at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances 
subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The 
mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and 
most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of 
the council.[40][41] As of 2016[update], the Mayor of the Borough of Dumont 
is Republican James J. Kelly, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019.[3]
