The 1935 Boston Red Sox season involved the Red Sox finishing fourth in 
the American League with a record of 78 wins and 75 losses. This was the 
Red Soxâ€™ first season with more wins than losses since 1918, when they 
won the World Series, and ended what was then the longest run of non-winning 
seasons in Major League Baseball. This has been since equalled by the Philadelphia 
Phillies between 1933 and 1948 and beaten by the Pittsburgh Pirates between 
1993 and 2012, but remains a record for the American League. [1] [2] [3]
