Malverne is a village in the town of Hempstead in Nassau County, New York, 
United States. The population was 8,514 at the 2010 census.[1] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.0 
square mile (2.6 km2), all of it land. Malverne was originally settled 
by the Rockaway Indians at an unknown point in history with the current 
Ocean Avenue serving as an Indian path. Western settlements can be dated 
back to the 1790s when the Cornwell family first settled and began farming 
the area. Norwood, as it was originally known, formed a movement to become 
an incorporated village in the early 1920s. This area originally consisted 
of the communities of North Lynbrook and Malverne Park. It is widely believed 
that residents of the now Malverne Park area did not wish to become part 
of the new village and therefore requested not to be included. North Lynbrook 
was believed to be removed from the borders by then New York Lieutenant 
Governor Jeremiah Wood, who lived in that area at that time and did not 
wish to be in an incorporated village. A vote was taken and voters decided 
to form an incorporated village by an overwhelming majority. The spelling 
of the name was originally Malvern, minus the "e" as in the English connection. 
When the Long Island Rail Road started service to Malvern they spelled 
the name Malverne, with the "e". Although Malvern attempted to fix the 
error, the village changed the name to Malverne as so many people thought 
the name was spelled with the "e".[citation needed] This is a further indication 
how important rail service was to villages across the country and how powerful 
their effects were felt upon them. The name was changed from Norwood to 
Malverne because a Village of Norwood already existed in upstate New York. 
The name Malverne originates from Malvern, England. Alfred Wagg, the main 
developers from the Amsterdam Development and Land Corporation, had visited 
Malvern and liked the name. The extra "e" was added to make it fancier.[citation 
needed] Malverne's incorporation was finalized on April 13, 1921, however 
it had been acting as a village since October 1920. The village has celebrated 
the 1921 anniversary at the 25-year, 50-year, and 75-year. Malverne was 
originally made up of many different communities (under one incorporated 
village). The communities were mostly made up of the original farmer of 
that area and those he sold his land to. While it is no longer viewed the 
same way, some of the neighborhood names can be found in the street names. 
The village's growth has been credited to two major events – the selling 
of farm land for development and the Long Island Rail Road. The Amsterdam 
Development Corporation is responsible for the building of many of the 
homes in the village. Today, there are over 3000 homes in the village. 
Today, many of its residents commute to New York City via the two Long 
Island Rail Road stations in the village – Malverne and Westwood, both 
located on the West Hempstead Branch. After a three-year hiatus, weekend 
train service was restored to the branch in November 2014.[2] The village 
is governed by a Board of Trustees of which the Mayor sits as the chair. 
Each member of the board is elected to a four-year term of office. There 
is also a village judge that presides over violations of the village code. 
Elections are scheduled for the third Tuesday of March in odd numbered 
years. The current elected officials are: The mayor appoints a deputy mayor 
to act in his/her absence. She/he also appoints liaisons and/or commissioners 
to each department in the village. The office of mayor was originally called 
president. Malverne considered a "full service" municipality with nearly 
all government services provided by the village itself. The Village hosts 
its own Police Department, Volunteer Fire Department (Norwood Hook, Ladder 
& Hose Company), Volunteer Ambulance Corps, Police Reserve, Department 
of Public Works, Emergency Management Commission, Public Library, Youth 
Board, and village television station – MalverneTV. Recent studies have 
found that Malverne is considered to be one of the safest communities in 
both the state and country. A report based on 2012 statistics place the 
village the second-safest in New York, behind only Briarcliff Manor.[3][4] 
In 2009, Standard & Poor's gave Malverne an AA+ credit bond rating, one 
of the highest ratings the financial institution gives out.[5] Malverne 
was home to the original Brown Derby restaurant, which was a popular hang-out 
to many vaudevillians. This restaurant spawned the opening of the more 
famous Brown Derby in Los Angeles following the demise of Vaudeville. The 
Lighting of Malverne, a holiday celebration and parade along Hempstead 
Avenue, is held annually on the first Saturday of December. It attracts 
thousands of people from Malverne and surrounding communities. The entire 
business district remains dark until the Mayor and the board flip a switch 
and all the holiday decorative lights are turned on. This kicks the start 
to a parade and many after As of the 2010 census the makeup of the village
