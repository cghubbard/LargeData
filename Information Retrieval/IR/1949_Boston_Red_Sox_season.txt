The 1949 Boston Red Sox season involved the Red Sox finishing second in 
the American League with a record of 96 wins and 58 losses. The Red Sox 
set a Major League record which still stands for the most base on balls 
by a team in a season, with 835.[1] During the season, Mel Parnell was 
the last pitcher to win at least 25 games in one season for the Red Sox 
in the 20th century.[2] George Kell beat Ted Williams for the American 
League batting title by 0.0002 percentage points.[3] Ted Williams set a 
major league record for the most consecutive games reaching base safely 
with 84. The streak began on July 1, and ended on September 28. The streak 
was ended by Washington Senators pitcher Ray Scarborough.[3] Williams was 
in the on-deck circle when Johnny Pesky made the final out, depriving him 
of one more chance to extend the streak. In 1949, Boston Red Sox owner 
Tom Yawkey and Yankees GM Larry MacPhail verbally agreed to trade Joe DiMaggio 
for Williams, but MacPhail refused to include Yogi Berra.[4] Joe DiMaggio 
came back from heel surgery to demolish the Red Sox in a three-game series 
at Fenway Park. He hit four home runs, three of them game winners. It sent 
the Sox reeling, and they fell 12.5 games back by July 4. But Boston rallied 
late in the season and went into Yankee Stadium for the final two games 
of the schedule with a one-game lead. The Red Sox needed just one win in 
two games and were to pitch Mel Parnell in the first game. After trailing 
4–0, the Yankees came back to beat Parnell 5–4, as Johnny Lindell hit an 
eighth-inning, game-winning, home run and Joe Page had a great relief appearance 
for New York.[5][6] And so it came down to the last game of the season. 
It was Ellis Kinder facing Vic Raschi. The Yankees led 1–0 after seven 
innings, having scored in the first. In the eighth inning, manager Joe 
McCarthy lifted Kinder for a pinch hitter who did not come through. Then 
he brought in Mel Parnell in relief, and Parnell yielded a homer to Tommy 
Henrich and a single to Yogi Berra. Parnell was replaced by Tex Hughson, 
who had been on the disabled list and said his arm still hurt. But he came 
on and, with the bases loaded, Jerry Coleman hit a soft liner that Al Zarilla 
in right field tried to make a shoestring catch, but he missed and it went 
for a triple and three runs.[7] In the ninth inning the Red Sox rallied 
for three runs but still fell short. "Why", said critics, "with a power-laden 
lineup, pinch hit for Kinder? See what happened in the ninth?" McCarthy 
had walked on thin ice. Hughson also claimed his manager ruined his career 
by making him pitch with a sore arm. It was the second year in a row McCarthy's 
late-season managing was called into question. In 1948, McCarthy had chosen 
journeyman pitcher Denny Galehouse to start the tie breaker that decided 
who went to the 1948 World Series, and the Red Sox lost that tiebreaker 
to the Cleveland Indians. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other
