WGN America is an American basic cable and satellite television channel 
that is owned by Tribune Broadcasting. The channel (short for World's Greatest 
Newspaper) is one of several flagship properties owned by Chicago, Illinois-based 
corporate parent Tribune Media, which also owns the channel's former parent 
television station during its existence as a superstation, WGN-TV (channel 
9), regional cable news channel Chicagoland Television (CLTV) and radio 
station WGN (720 AM). As of July 2015, WGN America is available in approximately 
72.987 million pay television households (62.7% of households with at least 
one television set) in the United States.[2] WGN America carries a variety 
of programs consisting mainly of recent and classic off-network sitcoms, 
drama series and feature films, along with first-run original television 
series produced exclusively for the channel. Despite retaining the "WGN" 
name that it borrowed from its former parent station, since December 15, 
2014, it no longer carries any local, syndicated or sports programming 
that airs in the Chicago market on WGN-TV. Conversely, WGN-TV does not 
carry WGN America's original series, outside of any special presentations 
of a program's series premiere (such as with the July 2014 premiere of 
Manhattan, which aired on WGN-TV and several other Tribune-owned stations 
on the night of its debut on WGN America). Until December 31, 2015, WGN 
America broadcast on an Eastern Time schedule (with programs shown at earlier 
or later times depending on the location). As such, promos for WGN America 
programs referenced airtimes for both the Eastern and Pacific time zones 
(for example, America's Funniest Home Videos is promoted as airing at "6 
p.m. East/3 p.m. West", a scheduling reference format used in promotions 
beginning in 2008, instead of referring to both zones as "Eastern" and 
"Pacific"). WGN America launched a Pacific Time Zone feed on January 1, 
2016, an addition made as part of Tribune Broadcasting's renewal of the 
channel's carriage agreement with AT&T on October 26, 2015, which expanded 
its distribution by five million additional subscribers through the two 
pay television providers that carried the East Coast feed initially, AT&T 
U-verse and DirecTV.[3][4] WGN America is available in the United States 
on most cable providers, as well as on DirecTV, AT&T U-verse and Verizon 
FiOS. However, it continues not to be available on cable in portions of 
the western United States and much of the New England region of the northeastern 
United States. Moreover, some cable providers in select markets where Tribune 
Broadcasting owns a television station do not carry WGN America on analog 
or digital cable. In particular, the channel was not available in portions 
of the New York City metropolitan area until January 15, 2016, when Cablevision 
started carrying the network as part of an overall deal with Tribune Media 
that also included its purchase of Tribune's 2.8% ownership interest in 
Newsday Holdings.[5] On 12 June 2016, the carriage contract between Dish 
Network and Tribune Broadcasting expired. At 19:00 EDT, Dish Network ceased 
carriage of Tribune Broadcasting's television networks, including WGN America 
and Chicago's WGN-TV.[6][7] Local station feeds, like those of WGN-TV, 
were replaced with a repeating recorded video message prepared by Dish 
Network.[8] WGN America was replaced by a duplicate feed of TNT. The 2 
sides reached a deal to re-add the networks on 3 September, with the channels 
being put back on Dish hours after the announcement. In the Chicago metropolitan 
area, WGN America is not available over-the-air as a digital subchannel 
of WGN-TV. The channel is available within the Chicago market via the area's 
three major cable providers (Comcast Xfinity, RCN and WOW!), AT&T U-verse 
and DirecTV, in addition to the WGN-TV broadcast signal. Prior to its conversion 
into a basic cable channel in December 2014, those living in the market 
could only receive WGN America on the latter two satellite providers.[9][10] 
WGN America was previously carried in Canada on most cable and satellite 
providers; however, its distribution in that country was reduced significantly 
on January 17, 2007, when Shaw Broadcast Services – the main supplier of 
WGN in Canada – replaced the superstation feed with the WGN-TV Chicago 
broadcast signal. The decision to switch to the Chicago area feed is believed 
to have been made in order to avoid paying fees that are required to carry 
the then WGN superstation feed. Although satellite provider Star Choice 
(now Shaw Direct) and most Canadian cable systems that had been carrying 
WGN America began receiving WGN-TV/Chicago from that point forward (satellite 
provider Bell TV had been carrying the Chicago area signal for several 
years), select cable providers continued to carry the WGN national feed 
in lieu of or – as was the case with providers such as MTS TV and Cogeco 
Cable – in tandem with WGN-TV Chicago, resulting in the duplication of 
CW network and many syndicated programs that are available within the country 
on other broadcast and specialty channels (such as fellow superstations 
KTLA and WSBK-TV). While the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission (CRTC) had approved the Chicago station's broadcast signal and 
its national cable feed for carriage on any domestic multichannel video 
programming distributor (including cable, satellite, IPTV and MMDS providers), 
the conversion of WGN America from a superstation into a conventional cable 
channel and its resulting programming separation from WGN-TV led Tribune 
Broadcasting to announce on December 15, 2014 that it would terminate all 
Canadian distribution rights for WGN America, effective January 1, 2015,[11] 
likely due to genre protection rules then enforced by the CRTC that prohibited 
domestic or foreign cable channels from maintaining a general entertainment 
programming format. However, most cable and satellite providers across 
Canada – including some that lost access to WGN America – continue to receive 
WGN-TV (which, in addition to being available to subscribers of premium 
channels such as The Movie Network and Super Channel, is also carried in 
Canada as part of the NHL Centre Ice sports package, primarily for simulcasts 
of Chicago Blackhawks games), as the station is still authorized for domestic 
distribution as a superstation. In October 1978, United Video Satellite 
Group uplinked the signal of Chicago independent station WGN-TV (channel 
9) to the Satcom-3 satellite for distribution to cable and satellite subscribers 
throughout the United States. For about eleven years afterward, the national 
WGN-TV signal carried the same programming schedule as that seen in the 
Chicago area; the national feed also used the same on-air branding as the 
Chicago area signal (which was referred to on-air at the time as either 
"Channel 9" or "WGN Channel 9") until 1997, when it became known as simply 
"WGN" outside of Chicago (although it retained the varied forms of the 
WGN logo wordmark until 2008). After United Video launched Prevue Guide 
(now the entertainment-based Pop) in the late 1980s, it utilized WGN's 
audio subcarrier channel – which was unheard by viewers – to transmit programming 
schedules in a 2400 bit/s data stream to local cable providers. On May 
18, 1988, the Federal Communications Commission passed the Syndication 
Exclusivity Rules (or "SyndEx") into law; the regulations required cable 
providers to black out syndicated programs shown on any out-of-market television 
stations that the provider carried, when a station within a television 
market obtains the exclusive rights to broadcast that particular program.[12][13][14] 
In response, a separate national feed of WGN-TV was launched on January 
1, 1990 to avoid any potential blackouts, save for some sports programming 
(the feed was originally similar in structure to the now-defunct WWOR EMI 
Service, a superstation feed of Secaucus, New Jersey-based WWOR-TV that 
launched seven months after WGN-TV achieved superstation status, only with 
fewer programming blackouts). By the early 1990s, WGN began to increase 
its national coverage when many cable systems began to swap out WWOR and 
its New York City area rival (and sister station to WGN-TV) WPIX for the 
WGN superstation feed;[15][16] its distribution expanded further as it 
gradually gained carriage on direct broadcast satellite via DirecTV, Dish 
Network and Primestar during that decade. On December 3, 1993, Tribune 
Broadcasting signed an affiliation agreement with WGN-TV/Chicago to become 
a charter affiliate of The WB Television Network, a joint venture between 
the Warner Bros. Television unit of Time Warner, the Tribune Company and 
original network president Jamie Kellner (the latter two partners held 
minority ownership stakes in the network); this made the station an affiliate 
of a broadcast network for the first time since the August 1956 shutdown 
of the DuMont Television Network (WGN-TV had been a primary CBS/secondary 
DuMont affiliate from its sign-on on April 6, 1948, before becoming exclusively 
affiliated with DuMont after CBS moved to WBKB-TV (channel 4, now WBBM-TV 
on channel 2) in 1953).[17] Through the agreement and Tribune's ownership 
interest in The WB – which resulted in most of the company's independent 
stations becoming charter affiliates of the network – The WB allowed the 
WGN superstation feed to nationally distribute its prime time (and when 
it was added by The WB in September 1995, children's) programming, in order 
to make the network available to areas of the United States that did not 
initially have a local affiliate. The WB was the second network to make 
its programming available directly to pay television providers to designated 
"white areas" without broadcast affiliate clearances; Fox had earlier launched 
Foxnet, a cable channel created specifically for the same impetus behind 
the WGN-WB agreement, which operated from June 1991 to September 2006.[18] 
The superstation feed became a de facto national WB affiliate upon the 
network's January 11, 1995 launch, giving The WB an early advantage over 
the United Paramount Network (UPN), which declined to allow WWOR to carry 
its programming to areas without an affiliate.[19] While The WB's programming 
was initially split between two stations in the Chicago market, WGN-TV 
(which aired the network's prime time programming), and WCIU-TV (channel 
26) (which ran Kids' WB children's programming until it moved to WGN-TV 
in September 2004), The WB's entire programming schedule was carried by 
the WGN superstation feed. In addition, as The WB only carried programming 
on Sundays when it launched and would not expand its prime time schedule 
to six nights a week until September 1999, the superstation feed – as with 
most over-the-air WB affiliates during the network's early years – filled 
the 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot on nights without WB network programming 
with either sports telecasts from WGN-TV that were cleared for national 
broadcast (which as The WB expanded its programming to other nights over 
a four-year period beginning with the launch of its Wednesday lineup in 
September 1995, would result in pre-emptions of the network's programs 
until later in the week) or movies. In December 1996, not long after WGN-TV 
temporarily lost rights to broadcast Chicago Bulls basketball games due 
to a lawsuit between the station and the National Basketball Association, 
the WGN superstation feed was dropped from cable systems operated by Tele-Communications, 
Inc. in several U.S. cities outside of the Chicago area. The move was partly 
made in order to make room for additional cable networks due to limited 
space (cable providers around the country at this time were regularly making 
upgrades to their headend infrastructures to allow the carriage of additional 
channels, culminating in the adoption of digital cable in the latter part 
of the decade). TCI's removal of WGN had a minor complication for The WB 
as even though the network had been slowly adding stations to its roster 
at the time, it still did not have local affiliates in many medium-sized 
and smaller markets. Outcry from some TCI subscribers over the decision 
to drop WGN resulted in the cable provider later backing off plans to drop 
the superstation feed in five Midwestern states.[20][21] In 1997, TCI and 
Tribune had discussed a proposal to sell a 50% ownership stake in the WGN 
superstation feed to TCI and convert it into a basic cable channel (similar 
to what Atlanta superstation WTBS did that same year, as well as Tribune's 
conversion of WGN America into a basic service that began in 2014); this 
ultimately did not go forward.[22] On October 7, 1999, WGN stopped carrying 
The WB's programming on its superstation feed at the network's request, 
on mutual grounds between Time Warner and Tribune that The WB had increased 
its national broadcast coverage (through affiliation agreements signed 
with local broadcast stations after its launch and the debut of a cable-only 
affiliate group in markets where no over-the-air affiliate was present 
in September of the previous year) to the point that discontinuing the 
network's carriage on the superstation feed was deemed necessary. Kids' 
WB programming on weekday mornings and afternoons and on Saturday mornings 
was replaced with syndicated series, while feature films replaced The WB's 
prime time programs, resulting in the superstation's schedule more so resembling 
an independent station than a general entertainment cable network due to 
the presence of local programming from WGN-TV.[23][24] The removal of WB 
programming from the superstation feed reduced The WB's potential household 
audience by 10 million homes, and was cited as the reason behind the network's 
ratings declines during the 1999–2000 television season (The WB fell to 
sixth place in the Nielsen ratings that season, behind UPN), as the network 
lost an estimated 19% of its household audience through the decision.[25] 
For similar reasons to those that necessitated the decision to remove WB 
programming from the channel, WGN America also did not carry any programming 
from The CW when WGN-TV became its charter affiliate for the Chicago market 
at that network's launch in September 2006, due to the fact that The CW 
is widely available throughout the United States via over-the-air broadcast 
stations and affiliations with digital subchannels and local cable outlets 
(including through The CW Plus in smaller markets) when that network launched 
in September 2006. In September 2001, the superstation feed was rebranded 
as WGN Superstation, before undergoing another name change as Superstation 
WGN in November 2002, coinciding with the introduction of WGN-TV Chicago's 
current logo (to which the superstation feed used a stylized version that 
added an ovular die-cut "S" emblem to represent its superstation status, 
alongside the text logo that included WGN-TV's wordmark). On May 24, 2008, 
Superstation WGN changed its name to WGN America (initially, the use of 
the new name was limited to on-air promotions, as the Superstation WGN 
channel IDs remained in place). The new WGN America name and logo went 
into full-time use on May 26, 2008. The new logo was also the first used 
by the superstation feed not to incorporate WGN-TV's on-air logo branding 
in some capacity (the "WGN" text was similar in resemblance, although the 
"G" was not formed into an ovular arrow as it is in WGN-TV's logo), and 
its design featured the eyes of a female, which was used alongside the 
new slogan "TV You Can't Ignore". The channel would soon begin to slowly 
revamp its programming lineup, starting with the introduction of the weekly 
classic sitcom block "Outta Sight Retro Night" (which ran from August 2007 
to September 5, 2010, airing on Sunday evenings from 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. 
Eastern Time, with a breakaway at 10:00 p.m. Eastern for the channel's 
simulcasts of WGN News at Nine and Instant Replay). The block featured 
series such as WKRP in Cincinnati, Newhart, ALF, Barney Miller and The 
Honeymooners – some of these programs had previously aired on WGN prior 
to implementation of the SyndEx rules, or even after the rules went into 
effect on the Chicago signal only, and in some cases, the superstation 
feed as well (some of the shows aired as part of the block have also since 
aired on Antenna TV, a classic television-focused broadcast network that 
Tribune launched on January 1, 2011, four months after WGN America discontinued 
"Outta Sight Retro Night").[26] A few shows were dropped from the channel, 
such as former WGN staples U.S. Farm Report and Soul Train, primarily due 
to the dissolution of Tribune's television production and distribution 
unit.[27] In late July 2008, the network's logo bug was revised with the 
eyes element of the logo being morphed into the "WGN America" text – the 
eyes element remained a part of the general logo in all other uses until 
January 2009, when it was deemphasized in favor of using the channel's 
wordmark text as the primary logo. In the fall of 2008, then-Tribune chairman/CEO 
Sam Zell and co-CEO Randy Michaels stated to the media during a nationwide 
tour promoting the Tribune properties that the company was interested in 
producing a late night talk show hosted by comedian Jay Leno, following 
the end of his initial run as host of NBC's The Tonight Show that year, 
by launching it on Tribune's television stations and using WGN America 
to broadcast the show nationally.[28] However, in December 2008, NBC agreed 
to a deal to let Leno host a weeknight primetime talk show at 10:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time, called The Jay Leno Show (which was cancelled in February 
2010, due to low ratings, with Leno returning as host of Tonight one month 
later). In April 2009, WGN America underwent another rebrand, with a new 
retro-style logo (which was given a minor update on July 1, 2010 with the 
rounded trapezoid containing the "WGN" letters simplified into rounded 
squares and the letters in the "america" wording being spaced), a new five-note 
sounder (which was also used on WGN radio in Chicago), new graphics, a 
new slogan ("Everywhere America Calls Home"), and the introduction of some 
original programming. The changes were made in order to increase its cable 
carriage outside the channel's traditional coverage area and position itself 
as a general entertainment network that programs to the entire nation, 
not just Chicago and the Midwest.[29] With ownership and management changes 
occurring at the Tribune Company as it exited protracted Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization proceedings in December 2012 (which led to the August 2014 
spin-off of its publishing division to focus on the company's broadcasting, 
digital media and real estate units[30]), Tribune announced plans to convert 
WGN America from a superstation into a conventional cable network, similar 
to TBS's transition to a basic cable channel in the 1990s. Ironically, 
it was the national TBS cable channel's separation from its parent Atlanta 
station WTBS (channel 17, which became WPCH-TV) in October 2007 that resulted 
in WGN America becoming the last remaining national superstation in the 
U.S. to be distributed through both cable and satellite television. WGN 
America was also one of four superstations that were owned by Tribune, 
alongside CW affiliates KTLA/Los Angeles, KWGN-TV/Denver and WPIX/New York 
City, the latter three of which were available on cable in their respective 
regions of the United States, and on Dish Network nationally for those 
who subscribed to the provider's a la carte superstations tier prior to 
its decision to halt its sale to new subscribers in September 2013; KTLA 
and WPIX are also available on Canadian cable and satellite providers via 
authorization by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission 
(CRTC) as WGN-TV is and remains to this day due to providers in that country 
having previously substituted the national channel with the WGN-TV Chicago 
signal (although KWGN-TV is also authorized by the CRTC for carriage in 
Canada, that station is not carried on any pay television providers within 
that country). Plans called for WGN America to incorporate scripted original 
programming, to migrate from "limited basic" (or "lifeline") programming 
tiers (where it is carried alongside local broadcast stations and public, 
educational, and government access channels) to the "expanded basic" tiers 
of cable providers, and to adopt a retransmission consent model in future 
carriage agreements in which Tribune would receive revenue for the network's 
carriage (changing its existing model in which pay television providers 
carrying WGN America make royalty payments to the United States Copyright 
Office under compulsory license provisions for retransmitting out-of-market 
stations).[31][32] Matt Cherniss was appointed as the first president and 
general manager of WGN America and Tribune Studios, a newly formed production 
unit that would produce some of the network's original content, on March 
19, 2013.[33][34] The network's logo was overhauled again in January 2014, 
in advance of the launch of its first original scripted programs, to a 
simpler and neutral variant removing the flourishes of the Zell/Michaels 
era of Tribune ownership, and focusing more on the "WGN" call letters for 
branding; the new imaging was unveiled on December 19, 2013, as part of 
a promotional trailer for its first scripted drama series, Salem.[35] Salem 
and WGN America saw a major promotional push which began with Fox's broadcast 
of Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, where local advertising time on Tribune 
Broadcasting's fifteen Fox affiliates (including stations in Seattle and 
Denver, the two cities whose local NFL teams played in the game) was used 
to air an extended promotional ad for Salem, followed by further promotion 
on Tribune's other local television stations in the lead-up to the show's 
April 20 premiere.[36] In a May 2014 symposium at the MoffattNathanson 
Media & Communications Summit, Tribune Company president and CEO Peter 
Liguori (a former Fox and Discovery Communications executive who joined 
Tribune in December 2012) stated that with its new programming strategy, 
about 50% of U.S. cable providers would begin offering WGN America as a 
conventional cable channel by the end of 2014, with all cable providers 
offering it as a basic cable service by around 2016. Most notably, on December 
15, 2014, Tribune reached a carriage agreement with Comcast Xfinity that 
saw WGN America move from limited to expanded basic tiers on its systems 
in four markets (Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Seattle) the 
following day on December 16, while also making it available on cable in 
the Chicago market for the first time on the provider's systems in that 
area.[9][10] As of 2015[update], WGN America's programming slate relies 
primarily on a variety of reruns such as How I Met Your Mother, 30 Rock, 
Blue Bloods, Parks and Recreation, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Elementary, 
Walker, Texas Ranger, In the Heat of the Night and Rules of Engagement. 
As is typical for cable networks, some of the shows airing on the channel 
are also available on other broadcast television stations throughout the 
United States; for much of its post-Syndex existence as a superstation, 
many of these programs were cleared by television syndication distributors 
for "full-signal" rights – therefore allowing them to air on WGN America 
as they do not fall under syndication exclusivity regulations (for example, 
although How I Met Your Mother is syndicated to other television stations 
nationwide, including WGN-TV/Chicago, it is allowed to air on WGN America 
due to its clearance by 20th Television for "full-signal" carriage). However, 
in 2013, WGN America began to acquire exclusive cable rights to programs 
eligible for syndication, such as Person of Interest, as part of its shift 
towards a conventional cable network.[37] Feature films on WGN America 
are also cleared for "full-signal" carriage, as the channel runs movies 
from film packages distributed for local broadcast syndication by Warner 
Bros. Television, Disney-ABC Domestic Television, 20th Television, Sony 
Pictures Television and other distributors. Movies formed much of the superstation's 
prime time schedule for much of its existence until the "Superstation WGN" 
branding era – though there have been exceptions: fewer prime time movies 
aired during the week during its four-year run as a cable-only affiliate 
of The WB from 1995 to 1999 as that network's programming expanded to additional 
nights, with films airing on a nightly basis again once WB programming 
was dropped (films were later removed from Sunday nights with the launch 
of the "Outta Sight Retro Night" block in 2007 and from Thursday nights 
between 2009 and 2010). WGN America then relegated its movie telecasts 
to Sunday afternoons and weekend late nights from September 18, 2010[38] 
until prime time films returned on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in 
May 2013. Until 2012, the channel's morning and early afternoon schedule 
heavily relied on reruns of television series produced between the 1960s 
and the early 1990s. During the early 2000s, WGN America acquired sub-run 
syndication rights to series that had previously aired in their original 
broadcast runs during the channel's affiliation with The WB, including 
7th Heaven, The Wayans Bros., Sister, Sister, and The Parent 'Hood. Between 
2006 and 2009, WGN America ran teen- and preteen-oriented sitcoms during 
mid-afternoon timeslots such as Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens and Sister, 
Sister, only for these shows to quickly be moved to overnight graveyard 
slots, when the show's target audiences are usually not awake, and then 
removed entirely shortly afterward. This was likely due to the restructuring 
of Tribune's television division and a distribution agreement with the 
Disney Channel that proved too expensive to maintain. On August 21, 2008, 
WGN America announced a partnership with Indianapolis radio station WFBQ 
to carry the television broadcast of The Bob & Tom Show radio program – 
which was originally produced for Tribune's duopoly of Fox affiliate WXIN 
(channel 59) and CW affiliate WTTV (channel 4, now a CBS affiliate) in 
that market. The program debuted on WGN America on November 3, 2008, originally 
airing in a standard late night slot,[39] before being moved to overnights 
until the television broadcast ended on September 13, 2010. On December 
19, 2008, WGN America reached a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment 
to broadcast WWE Superstars as an hour-long weekly program, starting on 
April 16, 2009.[40] The program was dropped from WGN America after the 
April 7, 2011 telecast (it is now available on WWE's subscription-based 
WWE Network). In April 2010, WGN America announced it would begin carrying 
Earl Pitts Uhmerikun, a television version of the radio commentary series 
created by Gary Burbank, which began airing that same month. Burbank had 
long maintained a close relationship with certain Tribune Company executives 
at that time, who approached him about bringing the segments to television.[41] 
The commentary was aired in the form of a series of 90-second segments 
that aired on WGN America until November 2011, usually during simulcasts 
of WGN-TV newscasts. As part of WGN America's restructuring, the channel 
began to develop original programming – some of which will be produced 
through Tribune Studios, a production and distribution unit formed in March 
2013 to develop syndicated programs that will be seen primarily on Tribune 
Broadcasting's television properties (the subsidiary's predecessor, Tribune 
Entertainment, was a contributing supplier of syndicated programs to WGN 
America prior to the unit's 2007 shutdown).[33][34][42] On June 4, 2013, 
WGN America placed a 13-episode order for its first original scripted program, 
the drama series Salem (which is based around the Salem witch trials), 
which premiered on April 20, 2014.[43] The network debuted its first unscripted 
series, Wrestling with Death, on January 13, 2015. WGN America had aired 
news programming from WGN-TV since the Chicago signal was uplinked to satellite 
in 1978, with syndicated programming having replaced them after the national 
channel became a conventional cable network. It originally aired John Drury 
and Newsnine, a traditional late-evening newscast which evolved into WGN-TV's 
current 9:00 p.m. program with its expansion to one hour in October 1980. 
From the implementation of SyndEx in 1990, syndicated programming substituted 
The Nine O'Clock News/WGN News at Nine on WGN America whenever sports events 
not cleared to air outside the Chicago market and/or (with the exception 
of a period from September 13, 2010[44] to May 2013, when it filled the 
prime time lineup with sitcom reruns) movies intended for broadcast only 
on the national channel were scheduled to run past 9:00 p.m. Central Time. 
WGN America removed the 9 p.m. news simulcast outright after the January 
30, 2014 edition; its companion Sunday sports highlight program Instant 
Replay last aired nationally on January 26 (also dropped as a result, were 
certain specials produced by the WGN-TV news department and many of chief 
meteorologist Tom Skilling's weather specials, which typically aired following 
half-hour abbreviated editions of the newscast).[45] Although Tribune Broadcasting 
CEO Matt Cherniss stated that he did not expect for the newscast's removal 
to cause any issues with viewers, disapproval of the move by some former 
Chicago residents living elsewhere in the United States resulted in the 
creation of a Facebook page asking for the broadcast to be returned to 
WGN America's schedule, citing concerns about a perceived inability to 
stay updated on news from the Chicago area.[46] However, all of WGN-TV's 
newscasts are streamed live worldwide on WGNTV.com, with the only restriction 
coming from the omission of sports highlights due to rights issues with 
the major professional sports leagues and the station's lack of contractual 
streaming rights. The WGN Midday News, which originated as the hour-long 
newscast Newscope in 1984, has also seen occasional – albeit, far rarer 
– pre-emptions due to Cubs or White Sox baseball games scheduled for broadcast 
on WGN-TV/WGN America at 1 p.m. Eastern Time; only the 12 p.m. hour of 
the program aired nationally (despite gradually expanding to include an 
11 a.m. hour in October 2009), before it was dropped from WGN America on 
December 13, 2014. The WGN Morning News aired nationally from its debut 
in September 1994 until September 1996 and again starting on February 3, 
2014 (at which point, only the 4 a.m. (Central Time) hour was simulcast);[45] 
SyndEx rules on paid segments featured within the newscast (to which WGN-TV's 
sales department negotiates the appearance and the terms, under which it 
would be charged a national rate if the segments aired outside of the Chicago 
market) reportedly resulted in the initial removal of the program and prohibited 
the last five hours (from 5 to 10 a.m. Central Time) from airing outside 
of Chicago when the morning news simulcast returned – although beginning 
on December 15, 2014, WGN America added the 5 a.m. hour, but restricted 
its broadcast in some markets with paid programming as an alternate substitute. 
WGN America had also broadcast Nightbeat, an overnight news program that 
ran until 1983, as well as WGN-TV's previous weekend morning news efforts 
during the 1990s, both of which were dropped by the superstation feed as 
a result of those newscasts' cancellations: a Saturday edition that ran 
from 1992 to 1998 and a Sunday edition that ran from 1992 to 1994. For 
undetermined reasons, WGN America never cleared other local newscasts that 
WGN-TV has added from September 2008 until the national channel's conversion 
to a conventional cable channel: its weekday 4 p.m. and weeknight 5 p.m. 
newscasts (the former of which debuted in September 2014, while the latter 
launched in September 2008 as a 5:30 p.m. newscast, and was expanded to 
weekends in July 2014), and the current incarnation of its weekend morning 
newscasts (which launched in October 2010). WGN-TV anchors referenced the 
WGN America simulcast at the beginning of each nationally televised newscast 
beginning in 2008 (until the 9 p.m. newscast was dropped, this excluded 
weekend evenings and the various predetermined pre-emptions of the 9 p.m. 
newscast outside of Chicago). Aside from programming shared by both the 
local and national superstation feeds that were cleared for "full-signal" 
carriage, other local programs shared by both feeds until WGN America restructured 
as a conventional cable network in December 2014 (in addition to newscasts), 
included the bi-weekly Saturday morning local public affairs programs Adelante, 
Chicago and People to People. WGN America also aired other Chicago-based 
programs produced by WGN's local programming department via simulcast or 
on a delayed basis, such as local parades, event coverage and retrospective 
shows on WGN-TV's past (including the McDonald's Thanksgiving Parade and 
the special Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics). WGN-TV/Chicago and the 
national superstation feed initially maintained similar programming schedules 
in the years after the SyndEx rules became law, running much of the same 
programs with limited substitutions outside of Chicago – though from the 
early 2000s onward (particularly since the rebrand to WGN America), WGN-TV/Chicago 
and the national channel shared substantially fewer common programs between 
the two feeds. From 1978 to 1987 and again from 1994 to 2014, WGN America 
aired the Illinois Lottery's daily drawings (making it the only U.S. state 
lottery whose drawings, including multi-jurisdictional games, were televised 
nationally). The midday and evening drawings were shown daily during news 
simulcasts; however, if newscasts aired in the drawings' designated time 
periods were pre-empted or were not provided by both WGN-TV and WGN America 
during the scheduled draw times, the winning numbers were instead shown 
as either a static full-screen or lower-third graphic. WGN America effectively 
acted as the default drawing broadcaster for Mega Millions (beginning with 
its 1998 inception as The Big Game) and Powerball (beginning when Illinois 
became a participant in 2011) in areas of lottery-participating states 
where no local station televised the drawings (the Iowa Lottery used Illinois' 
lottery numbers for its own daily Pick 3 and Pick 4 games as a result of 
the channel's widespread distribution in that state until April 2014, coinciding 
with the end of WGN's national carriage of lottery drawings);[47][48] both 
games were broadcast on their respective drawing nights (Tuesdays and Fridays 
for Mega Millions; Wednesdays and Saturdays for Powerball) at 10:59 p.m. 
Eastern Time, except during ongoing sports telecasts. The nighttime drawings 
(which are held at 9:22 p.m. Central Time) as well as Powerball and Mega 
Millions were dropped with the removal of the 9:00 p.m. news simulcast 
on January 31, 2014, with the midday drawings (held at 12:40 p.m. Central 
Time) following suit on December 15.[49] Through WGN-TV's longtime association 
as the MDA Love Network station for Chicago, WGN America had simulcast 
the annual MDA Show of Strength on Labor Day and the preceding Sunday night 
each September (having aired the telethon in its 21½-hour format from 1979 
to 2010, the six-hour evening format used in 2011 and the three-hour primetime-only 
format used in 2012), including the locally produced segments featuring 
WGN-TV personalities; as a result, donations to the Chicago-based segments 
of the telethon also came from various other areas of the United States 
and Canada. The MDA moved the telethon from syndication to ABC beginning 
with the 2013 broadcast (lasting for only one more year before the MDA 
chose to end its annual telethon outright in March 2015), ending the WGN 
America simulcast and WGN-TV's rights to the telethon with the 2012 edition.[50] 
Beginning at its inception via WGN-TV's satellite uplinking for distribution 
to cable providers, WGN America carried most sporting events produced and 
aired by its now-former Chicago broadcast parent. Through 2014, the national 
channel aired all Chicago Cubs and White Sox Major League Baseball games, 
and about 20 to 30 Chicago Bulls NBA games televised by WGN-TV/Chicago.[51] 
WGN-TV/Chicago had rights to carry additional Bulls games, as well as a 
number of Chicago Blackhawks NHL games; however, due to broadcast rights 
restrictions imposed respectively by the National Basketball Association 
and the National Hockey League, WGN America was not allowed to carry other 
games from the television station's Bulls schedule outside of those allowed 
to air outside the Chicago market, or any Blackhawks game that the local 
station carries (in the latter case due to the exclusive broadcast contracts 
with the NHL, such as its exclusive contract with Comcast/NBCUniversal 
that began in 2008). WGN America substituted games not cleared for national 
carriage with either movies or syndicated programming. Certain related 
programs carried locally, such as the Blackhawks' victory parade following 
the 2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs and a half-hour special paying tribute to 
the late Cubs player and broadcaster Ron Santo in 2011, have also not been 
shown on WGN America, though a few Tribune and Local TV-owned partner stations 
aired the funeral on their digital subchannels and the Blackhawks' victory 
parade was shown on the NHL Network using the WGN-TV feed. As a side effect 
of Tribune's conversion of WGN America into a general entertainment cable 
channel, the network phased out its carriage of WGN-TV's sports telecasts, 
with Tribune president/CEO Peter Liguori citing limited viewership and 
advertising revenue generated from the sports broadcasts relative to its 
expense (the Cubs package cost five times as much for rights fees alone 
as the revenue it brought in).[52] The final WGN Sports-produced game telecast 
to air on WGN America was a contest between the Bulls and the Golden State 
Warriors, from Chicago's United Center on December 6, 2014. WGN America 
later aired the Cubs' victory parade after the 2016 World Series on November 
4th of that year. WGN America HD is a high definition simulcast feed of 
WGN America, which broadcasts programming available in HD in the 1080i 
picture format. Original programming and select acquired programs (such 
as Elementary, How I Met Your Mother and Law & Order: Criminal Intent) 
are currently broadcast in high definition on the feed. The HD feed is 
available regionally through Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Xfinity 
by Comcast, AT&T U-verse, Verizon FiOS and other select cable providers, 
and nationally through satellite provider DirecTV. In relation to WGN America's 
prior history as a cable affiliate of The WB, the following articles discuss
