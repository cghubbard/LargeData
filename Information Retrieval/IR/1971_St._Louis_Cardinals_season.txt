The 1971 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 90th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and its 80th season in the National League. The Cardinals went 
90-72 during the season and finished second in the National League East, 
seven games behind the eventual NL pennant and World Series champion Pittsburgh 
Pirates. The Cardinals scrapped their traditional buttoned jerseys for 
T-shirt style uniform tops, and would keep them until they switched back 
in 1992. Third baseman Joe Torre won the MVP Award this year, batting .363, 
with 24 home runs and 137 RBIs. Pitcher Bob Gibson won a Gold Glove this 
year, and threw a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 14.
