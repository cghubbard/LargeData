James Louis Beattie (born July 4, 1954) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher. He also served as the Montreal Expos' General Manager from 1995 
to 2001,[1] and was the Baltimore Orioles general manager with Mike Flanagan 
from 2003 to 2005. As of 2010, Beattie is serving as a professional scout 
in the Toronto Blue Jays organization.[2] Beattie starred in baseball and 
basketball at South Portland High School in South Portland, Maine.[3] Beattie 
earned All New England honors playing basketball at Dartmouth College in 
1974, and was MVP of the Kodak Classic in 1975.[4] He was drafted by the 
New York Yankees in the fourth round of the 1975 Major League Baseball 
draft, and was soon tabbed one of the top pitching prospects in the Yankees' 
farm system, along with Ken Clay and Gil Patterson. Each vocalized frustration 
with the organization when they acquired pitchers Rich Gossage, Andy Messersmith 
and Rawly Eastwick after the 1977 season believing that it hindered their 
chances of making the major league roster that Spring.[5] That turned out 
not to be the case, as a rash of injuries opened the door for Beattie, 
and he made the club out of Spring training 1978. He pitched 6.1 innings 
and gave up just one run in his major league debut to beat Hall of Famer 
Jim Palmer and the Baltimore Orioles.[6] After a second win against the 
Chicago White Sox on May 15, Beattie lost his next seven decisions in a 
row. He was, however, on the mound for two of the Yankees' most important 
games that September. With the Yankees having been as far back as fourteen 
games to the Boston Red Sox on July 19, they surged to just four games 
back by the time they headed to Fenway Park for a four-game set from September 
7–10. Beattie started the second game of the series, holding Boston to 
just three hits and no runs over his first eight innings of work. After 
the Red Sox scored two unearned runs in the ninth, he handed the ball over 
to Ron Davis for the final out.[7] The Yankees swept the series to move 
into a tie with Boston. They moved on to Detroit for a three-game set next, 
and Beattie won game two of that series to give the Yankees sole possession 
of first place.[8] Following a one-game playoff with the Red Sox, the Yankees 
headed into the postseason. Beattie won game one of the 1978 American League 
Championship Series against the Kansas City Royals,[9] and earned a complete 
game victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in game five of the World Series.[10] 
Despite his late season and postseason heroics, Beattie failed to make 
the club the following Spring.[11] He was, however, called up by the beginning 
of May. On June 20, a line drive off the bat of the Toronto Blue Jays' 
John Mayberry shelved Beattie for two months.[12] On September 12, 1979, 
Boston Red Sox legend Carl Yastrzemski singled off Beattie for his 3,000th 
career hit.[13] After the season, he, Rick Anderson, Juan Beníquez and 
Jerry Narron were traded to the Seattle Mariners for Ruppert Jones and 
Jim Lewis.[14] Despite a high 5.01 earned run average, Beattie's record 
stood at 3-3 on May 21, 1980 following a victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. 
He only won two more games for the rest of the season, and finished at 
5-15 with a 4.85 ERA. He started the 1981 season in the bullpen, but after 
getting rocked in three outings, was reassigned to the triple A Pacific 
Coast League Spokane Indians. He returned to the majors after the 1981 
Major League Baseball strike, and pitch an eight inning gem against the 
California Angels on August 11 for his first victory of the season.[15] 
Beattie went 3-2 with one save with a 2.02 ERA while holding batters to 
a .212 batting average in the second half, as opposed to the eight earned 
runs he gave up in 4.1 innings of work prior to his demotion to Spokane. 
His success carried over into the 1982 seasons. Despite an 8-12 record, 
his 3.34 ERA was seventh best in the American League, 140 strikeouts was 
eighth best, and the .233 batting average he held batters to was sixth 
best. On September 27, 1983, Beattie hurled the first one-hitter in Seattle 
Mariners history against the Kansas City Royals. Outside of a U.L. Washington 
single in the third inning, Beattie was perfect.[16] Perhaps the second 
best pitching performance of his career came in a losing effort. On July 
25, 1984, he and the California Angels' Ron Romanick locked up in a pitchers' 
duel. Beattie pitched eight innings of one hit ball while striking out 
nine. With the game still scoreless heading into extra innings, Beattie 
took the mound again in the tenth inning. Gary Pettis ended it with a two 
out single in the tenth. After the game, Beattie smashed a water cooler 
and refused to talk to reporters.[17] Beattie began dealing with shoulder 
tendinitis late in his career.[18] He missed six weeks of the 1985 season 
with tendinitis,[19] then tore his rotator cuff upon his return.[20] He 
returned from surgery midway through the 1986 season. He pitched effectively 
in his first start against the Chicago White Sox, and was in line for the 
victory until the bullpen imploded.[21] From there, Beattie himself imploded 
as he went 0-6 with a 6.02 ERA through August 7, when he was placed back 
on the disabled list. Rather than trying to catch on with another big league 
club after being released by the Mariners, Beattie opted to go back to 
school. He received his M.B.A. from the University of Washington in 1989, 
(he also has a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth) then returned to the Mariners 
as their player development director in 1990. He remained in that position 
through the 1995 season, when he was named general manager and vice president 
of the Montreal Expos.[22] He quit at the end of the 2001 season; after 
a year away from the game, he joined the Baltimore Orioles as executive 
vice president of baseball operations.[23] He served as co-GM of the Orioles 
with former Orioles pitcher Mike Flanagan through the 2005 season, when 
Flanagan was given the job solely.[24] When Boston Red Sox GM Theo Epstein 
threatened to leave the Red Sox shortly afterwards, Beattie interviewed 
for the job.[25] He also interviewed for the vacant Houston Astros GM job 
in 2007. In something of an unexpected career turn, Beattie finished the 
2007 season as the Florida Marlins' bullpen coach. After former bullpen 
coach Steve Foster moved into the pitching coach position following Rick 
Kranitz's departure, Beattie jokingly offered his services to Marlins GM
