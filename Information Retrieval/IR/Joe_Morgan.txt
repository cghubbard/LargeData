Joe Leonard Morgan (born September 19, 1943) is a former Major League Baseball 
second baseman who played for the Houston Astros, Cincinnati Reds, San 
Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Oakland Athletics from 1963 
to 1984. He won two World Series championships with the Reds in 1975 and 
1976 and was also named the National League Most Valuable Player in those 
years. Considered one of the greatest second basemen of all-time, Morgan 
was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990. He became a baseball 
broadcaster for ESPN after his retirement, and now hosts a weekly nationally 
syndicated radio show for Sports USA. He is currently a special adviser 
to the Reds. Born in Bonham, Texas, and raised in Oakland, California, 
Morgan was nicknamed "Little Joe" for his diminutive 5'7" stature. He was 
a standout at Castlemont High School before being signed by the Houston 
Colt .45s as an amateur free agent in 1962. Early in his career, Morgan 
had trouble with his swing because he kept his back elbow down too low. 
Teammate Nellie Fox (also a stocky second baseman) suggested to Morgan 
that while at the plate he should flap his back arm like a chicken to keep 
his elbow up.[1] Morgan followed the advice, and his flapping arm became 
a familiar sight to baseball fans. Morgan played ten seasons for Houston, 
compiling 72 home runs and 219 stolen bases. He made the All Star Team 
twice during this period, in 1966 and 1970. On June 25, 1966, Morgan was 
struck on the kneecap by a line drive (hit by Lee May) during batting practice.[2] 
The broken kneecap forced Morgan out of the lineup for 40 games, during 
which the Astros went 11-29 (for a .275 winning percentage). Although Morgan 
played with distinction for Houston, the Astros wanted more power in their 
lineup. Additionally, manager Harry Walker considered Morgan a troublemaker.[3] 
As a result, they traded Morgan to the Cincinnati Reds as part of a blockbuster 
multi-player deal on November 29, 1971, announced at baseball's winter 
meetings. To this day the trade is considered an epoch-making deal for 
Cincinnati and one of the worst trades in Astros' history.[4] Power-hitting 
Lee May, All-Star second baseman Tommy Helms, and outfielder/pinch hitter 
Jimmy Stewart went to the Astros. In addition to Morgan, included in the 
deal to the Reds were César Gerónimo (who became their regular center fielder) 
and pitcher Jack Billingham (who soon joined the Reds pitching rotation 
as a leading starter), veteran infielder Denis Menke, and minor league 
outfielder Ed Armbrister. The deal facilitated a shift in Reds team philosophy 
towards speed over power, with Morgan and outfielder Pete Rose now two 
key figures batting back-to-back. Morgan added unusual home run power (at 
that time) for a second baseman to outstanding speed on the basepaths and 
excellent defense. After joining The Big Red Machine, Morgan's career reached 
a new level. This included eight consecutive All-Star Game appearances 
(1972–79) to go along with his 1966 and 1970 appearances with Houston. 
Morgan, along with teammates Pete Rose, Johnny Bench, Tony Pérez, and Dave 
Concepción, led the Reds to consecutive championships in the World Series. 
He drove in Ken Griffey for the winning run in Game 7 of the 1975 World 
Series. Morgan was also the National League MVP in 1975 and 1976. He was 
the first second baseman in the history of the National League to win the 
MVP back to back.[5] In Morgan's NL MVP years he batted .327 with 17 Home 
Runs & 94 RBIs in 1975 and he batted .320 with 27 Home Runs, 111 RBIs, 
& 60 stolen bases in 1976. Morgan was an extremely capable hitter—especially 
in clutch situations. While his lifetime average was only .271, he hit 
between .288 and .327 during his peak years with the Reds. Additionally, 
he drew many walks, resulting in an excellent .392 on-base percentage. 
He also hit 268 home runs to go with 449 doubles and 96 triples, excellent 
power for a middle infielder of his era, and was considered by some the 
finest base stealer of his generation (689 steals at greater than 80% success 
rate). Besides his prowess at the plate and on the bases, Morgan was an 
exceptional infielder, winning the Gold Glove Award in consecutive years 
from 1973 to 1977. Morgan returned to Houston in 1980 to help the young 
Astros win the NL West. The Astros then lost the National League Championship 
Series to the Philadelphia Phillies. Morgan went to the San Francisco Giants 
for the next two seasons. His home run in the last game of the 1982 season 
eliminated the Dodgers from the division race. He won the 1982 Willie Mac 
Award for his spirit and leadership. He then went to the Phillies, where 
he rejoined ex-teammates Pete Rose and Tony Pérez. After the Phillies lost 
to the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series, Morgan finished his career 
with the Oakland Athletics. After his career ended, Morgan was inducted 
into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1987, and his jersey number 8 
was retired. He threw out the first pitch at the Reds' first spring training 
game at Goodyear Ballpark on March 5, 2010. In March 1988 while transiting 
through Los Angeles International Airport, Morgan was violently thrown 
to the floor, handcuffed and arrested by LAPD detectives who racially profiled 
him as a drug courier.[6] He subsequently launched and won a civil rights 
case against the LAPD in 1991;[7] and was awarded $540,000.[8] In 1993 
a federal court upheld his claim that his civil rights had been violated.[9] 
In the New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James named Morgan 
the best second baseman in baseball history, ahead of #2 Eddie Collins 
and #3 Rogers Hornsby. He also named Morgan as the "greatest percentages 
player in baseball history", due to his strong fielding percentage, stolen 
base percentage, walk-to-strikeout ratio, and walks per plate appearance. 
The statement was included with the caveat that many players in baseball 
history could not be included in the formula due to lack of data.[10] In 
1999 Morgan ranked Number 60 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players,[11] and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team. Morgan currently serves as a member of the board 
of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated 
to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players 
through financial and medical hardships. Morgan started his broadcasting 
career in 1985 for the Cincinnati Reds. On September 11, 1985, Morgan, 
along with his television broadcasting partner Ken Wilson, was on hand 
to call Pete Rose's record breaking 4,192 career hit. A year later, Morgan 
started a nine-year stint as an announcer for the San Francisco Giants. 
Morgan added one more local gig when he joined the Oakland Athletics' broadcasting 
team for the 1995 season. From 1985 to 1988 Morgan called college baseball 
games for ESPN. In 1989, Morgan teamed with Brent Musburger to call the 
championship game of the College World Series for CBS. From 1988 to 1989 
Morgan served as an announcer for ABC, where he helped announce Monday 
Night and Thursday Night Baseball games (providing backup for the lead 
announcing crew composed of Al Michaels, Tim McCarver and Jim Palmer), 
the 1988 American League Championship Series[12] with Gary Bender and Reggie 
Jackson, and served as a field reporter for the 1989 World Series along 
with Gary Thorne (Morgan's regular season partner in 1989). Morgan was 
on the field at San Francisco's Candlestick Park alongside Hall of Famer 
Willie Mays (whom Morgan was getting set to interview) the moment the Loma 
Prieta earthquake hit at 5:04 pm. From 1994 to 2000 Morgan teamed with 
Bob Costas and Bob Uecker (until 1997) to call baseball games on NBC (and 
in association with The Baseball Network from 1994 to 1995). During this 
period Morgan helped call three World Series (1995, 1997, and 1999) and 
four All-Star Games (1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000). Morgan also called three 
American League Championship Series (1996, 1998, and 2000) and three National 
League Championship Series (1995 alongside Greg Gumbel, 1997, and 1999). 
Morgan had spent a previous stint (from 1986 to 1987) with NBC calling 
regional Game of the Week telecasts alongside Bob Carpenter.[13] During 
NBC's coverage of the 1985[14] and 1987 National League Championship Series, 
Morgan served as a pregame analyst alongside hosts Dick Enberg (in 1985) 
and Marv Albert (in 1987). Morgan was a member of ESPN's lead baseball 
broadcast team alongside Jon Miller and Orel Hershiser. Besides teaming 
with Miller for Sunday Night Baseball (since its inception in 1990) telecasts, 
Morgan also teamed with Miller for League Championship Series and World 
Series broadcasts on ESPN Radio. In 1999, Morgan teamed with his then-NBC 
colleague Bob Costas to call two weekday night telecasts for ESPN. The 
first was on Wednesday, August 25 with Detroit Tigers playing against the 
Seattle Mariners. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the Atlanta 
Braves playing against the New York Mets. In 2006, he called the Little 
League World Series Championship with Brent Musburger and Orel Hershiser 
on ABC, replacing the recently fired Harold Reynolds.[15] During the 2006 
MLB playoffs, the network had Morgan pull double duty by calling the first 
half of the Mets–Dodgers playoff game at Shea Stadium before traveling 
across town to call the Yankees–Tigers night game at Yankee Stadium.[16] 
In his time at ESPN, Morgan was a vocal critic of statistics-based analysis 
of baseball, including sabermetrics. Michael Lewis' book Moneyball, which 
describes Billy Beane's sabermetric-influenced approach to running the 
Oakland Athletics, was a particular target of Morgan's criticism. Morgan 
has repeatedly refused to actually read the book, stating that in his opinion 
statistics are not more helpful than observation.[17] In 2009, Sports Illustrated's 
Joe Posnanski spoke about the perceived disparity between Morgan's celebrated 
playing style and his on-air persona: In the wake of Morgan taking an official 
role with the Cincinnati Reds as a "special adviser to baseball operations", 
it was announced on November 8, 2010 that Morgan would not be returning 
for the 2011 season as an announcer on ESPN Sunday Night Baseball. His 
former broadcast partner Jon Miller's contract expired in 2010 and ESPN 
chose not to renew his contract. Morgan and Miller were replaced by Bobby 
Valentine and Dan Shulman, respectively (while ESPN retained Orel Hershiser, 
who joined the Sunday Night Baseball telecasts in 2010). Morgan's announcing 
work with ESPN inspired the title of firejoemorgan.com, a sports blog that 
updated regularly from 2005 to 2008. Considered one of the most influential 
sports blogs of the decade,[19] the blog criticized sports journalism, 
particularly in baseball. Morgan (especially towards the end of his work 
with ESPN) was accused of often not doing his homework prior to broadcasts 
and seeing no team as performing better than his own 1975–76 Cincinnati 
Reds teams. He was also criticized for coming across as dry and humorless, 
while making statements perceived as aloof and distant,[20][21] despite 
his partner Jon Miller's efforts to draw him into conversations. While 
Morgan himself was a frequent target, the blog was also critical of other 
opponents of sabermetrics, as well as sports journalists who misstated 
or misrepresented the concepts of Moneyball. He was also a broadcaster 
in the MLB 2K series from 2K Sports. It was announced on June 17, 2011, 
that Morgan would begin a daily, one-hour general-sports-talk radio program, 
beginning August 22. "While I’m best known for baseball, I’ve always had 
a love of all sports", Morgan said in a statement. "I’m fortunate that 
my career has allowed me to meet some of the most amazing people, and I 
have heard so many remarkable stories. With my new show, I am looking forward 
to sharing these stories, as well as speaking with today's sports personalities 
and newsmakers", Morgan concluded. [22] On April 21, 2010, it was announced 
that Morgan was returning to the Reds in the role of "special adviser to 
baseball operations." Morgan's role is to work in both baseball and community 
outreach for the Reds.[23] Morgan stressed to Marty Brennaman during the 
April 21 radio broadcast that he will not be involved in trade decisions
