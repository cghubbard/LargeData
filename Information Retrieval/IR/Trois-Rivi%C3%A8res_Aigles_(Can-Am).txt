The Trois-Rivières Aigles is a Canadian professional baseball team based 
in Trois-Rivières, Quebec. It is a member of the Canadian-American Association 
of Professional Baseball, and they play their home games at Stade Fernand-Bédard. 
The Aigles are named to honor the previous Trois-Rivières Aigles, which 
called Stade Fernand-Bédard home from 1971 until 1977 as a member of the 
Eastern League and an affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. In addition, a 
team in the Ligue de Baseball Junior Élite du Québec bore that name, winning 
the 2007 LBJEQ pennant. The Aigles mascot is Grand Chelem de Aigle, which 
means Grand Slam the Eagle in French. After various attempts to place a 
franchise in Trois-Rivières (including various exhibition games), the Can-Am 
League finally announced the Aigles' membership on October 3, 2012. Notable 
co-owners include 2003 National League Cy Young Award winner Éric Gagné 
and Carolina Hurricanes defenceman Marc-André Bergeron.[1] On November 
14, it was announced that Pierre-Luc Laforest would serve as the Aigles' 
inaugural manager. Laforest is best known for his time among the Aigles' 
provincial rivals the Québec Capitales, winning the Can-Am League MVP award 
in 2009 and serving as player/hitting coach in 2011 and 2012 (Laforest 
has been a member of all four of the Capitales' four consecutive Can-Am 
league pennant winners).[2] In 2015, the Aigles qualified for the playoffs 
for the first time in the franchise's history. On September 13, 2015, the 
Aigles defeated the Rockland Boulders in Game 5 by a score of 7-2 and won 
the opening series 3 games to 2 and advanced to the championship for the 
first time in franchise history. They played the New Jersey Jackals and 
defeated them 3 games to 2 to win the 2015 Can-Am League championship, 
their first in franchise history. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
