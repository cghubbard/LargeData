The first Ohio State League was a baseball league in 1887 before changing 
names to the Tri-State League. The first 20th century Ohio State League 
started in 1908 as a class D loop and ran through 1916. Another Ohio State 
League was formed in 1936 and ran through 1947 except for a break in '42-'43 
due to World War II. In 1945, the OSL was one of just four class D circuits 
in operation, yet it was one of the first of dozens of leagues to collapse 
after World War II. The class D Ohio–Indiana League was formed in 1948 
with eight teams, with seven of the eight cities coming from the Ohio State 
League. Six teams made their home in Ohio and the remaining two where from 
Indiana. This league lasted through 1951. Secretary: L. A. Moore #Canton
