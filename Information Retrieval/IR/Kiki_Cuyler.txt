Hazen Shirley "Kiki" Cuyler (/ˈkaɪˈkaɪ ˈkaɪlər/; August 30, 1898 – February 
11, 1950) was a Major League Baseball right fielder from 1921 until 1938 
who later was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Cuyler established 
a reputation as an outstanding hitter with great speed. He regularly batted 
.350 or higher and finished with a .321 lifetime batting average. In 1925 
Cuyler hit 18 home runs and 102 RBI. Cuyler's Pirates won the World Series 
that year, the only time in his career that he contributed to a World Series 
winner. Cuyler was born in Harrisville, Michigan on August 30, 1898.[1] 
He was one of six children born to George and Anna Cuyler. His father had 
come to the United States from Canada, but his ancestors lived in New York 
from the 17th century until they moved to Canada at the start of the Revolutionary 
War.[2] Cuyler started his professional baseball career with the Bay City 
Wolves in 1920. He appeared briefly in the major leagues with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates over the next three seasons, but still spent the majority of each 
season in the minor leagues. He hit .340 in 1923 for the Nashville Vols 
of the Southern Association. He was promoted to the Pirates for his first 
full major league season in 1924.[3] Two explanations have been given for 
the origin of Cuyler's nickname, "Kiki". In the first version, he had been 
known as "Cuy" for a long time. When a fly ball was hit to the Nashville 
outfield and it was judged to be Cuyler's play, the shortstop would call 
out "Cuy" and this call would be echoed by the second baseman. The echoed 
name caught on with Nashville's fans. In the second explanation, "Kiki 
Cuyler" came from the player's stuttering problem and the way it sounded 
when Cuyler said his own last name.[4] In August 1925, Cuyler hit two inside-the-park 
home runs in a single game at Baker Bowl, the very compact baseball stadium 
in Philadelphia.[5] Cuyler led the 1925 Pirates to a World Series title, 
the only one of his career. In 1927, Cuyler was benched for nearly half 
the season because of a dispute with first-year manager Donie Bush. The 
Pirates again went to the World Series, but Cuyler did not play. That November, 
Cuyler was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Sparky Adams and Pete Scott. 
Between 1926 and 1930, the 1927 season was the only time that Cuyler did 
not lead the league in stolen bases.[6] Between 1931 and his retirement 
in 1938, Cuyler never stole more than 16 bases in a season. Though he hit 
for a .338 batting average and a league-leading 42 doubles in 1934, Cuyler 
was made a free agent by July 1935. He signed with the Cincinnati Reds, 
hitting .326 in 1936 and .271 in 1937. He was released after the 1937 season 
and signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers for his final season in 1938. Cuyler 
finished his career with a .321 batting average, 128 home runs, 1065 RBI 
and 328 stolen bases.[6] After the end of his playing career, Cuyler managed 
in the minor leagues, winning the regular-season Southern Association pennant 
in 1939 under Joe Engel with the Chattanooga Lookouts, with one of the 
only fan-owned franchises in the nation. He was a coach for the Cubs and 
Boston Red Sox during the 1940s, and was still active in the role for Boston 
in February 1950 when he died of a heart attack at the age of 51. His remains 
are interred in Harrisville, Michigan, and the bar he owned still operates 
under his name.[1] Cuyler was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1968. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book 
The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. In Harrisville, Michigan 
his former eponymous bar still operates; and M-72 is named the Kiki Cuyler
