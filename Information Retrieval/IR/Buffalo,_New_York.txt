Buffalo (/ˈbʌfəloʊ/) is a city in western New York state and the county 
seat of Erie County, on the eastern shores of Lake Erie at the head of 
the Niagara River. As of 2014[update], Buffalo is New York state's 2nd-most 
populous city after New York city, with 258,703 residents. The metropolitan 
area has a population of 1.13 million. Buffalo grew significantly in the 
19th and 20th centuries as a result of the Erie Canal, railroads and Lake 
Erie, providing an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to 
the midwestern United States, while grooming its economy for the grain, 
steel and automobile industries during the 20th century. After an economic 
downturn in the latter half of the 20th century, Buffalo's economy has 
transitioned to sectors that include financial services, technology, biomedical 
engineering and education. Residents of Buffalo are called "Buffalonians". 
The city's nicknames include "The Queen City", "The Nickel City", and "The 
City of Good Neighbors".[1] The city of Buffalo received its name from 
a nearby creek called Buffalo Creek.[2] British military engineer Captain 
John Montresor made reference to 'Buffalo Creek' in his journal of 1764, 
which may be the earliest recorded appearance of the name.[3] There are 
several theories regarding how Buffalo Creek received its name.[4][5][6] 
While it is possible that Buffalo Creek's name originated from French fur 
traders and Native Americans calling the creek Beau Fleuve (French for 
"Beautiful River"),[4][5] it is also possible that Buffalo Creek was named 
for the American buffalo, whose historical range may have extended into 
western New York.[6][7] Prior to European colonization, French observers 
report the region's inhabitants were an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot 
of the large Neutral Nation called the Wenro people or 'Wenrohronon', who 
lived along the south shore of Lake Ontario and east end of Lake Erie and 
a bit of its southern shore. Later, during the 1640s–50s Beaver Wars, the 
combined warriors of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy conquered 
the populous Neutrals[8] and their peninsular territory,[8] while the Senecas 
alone took out their weak neighbors, the Wenrohronon, and their territory, 
c. 1651[8][9]–1653.[10] In 1804, as principal agent opening the area for 
the Holland Land Company, the architect of Washington D.C., Joseph Ellicott, 
designed a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown 
like bicycle spokes similar to the street system he used in the nation's 
capital. Although Ellicott named the settlement "New Amsterdam," the name 
did not catch on.[11] During the War of 1812, on December 30, 1813,[citation 
needed] Buffalo was burned by British forces.[12] The Coit House 1818 and 
Schenck House 1823 are currently the oldest houses within the limits of 
the City of Buffalo.[13][14] On October 26, 1825,[15] the Erie Canal was 
completed with Buffalo a port-of-call for settlers heading westward.[16] 
At the time, the population was about 2,400.[17] The Erie Canal brought 
about a surge in population and commerce, which led Buffalo to incorporate 
as a city in 1832.[18] In 1845, construction began on the Macedonia Baptist 
Church, an important meeting place for the abolitionist movement.[better source needed] 
Buffalo was a terminus point of the Underground Railroad with many fugitive 
slaves crossing the Niagara River to Fort Erie, Ontario in search of freedom.[19] 
During the 1840s, Buffalo's port continued to develop. Both passenger and 
commercial traffic expanded with some 93,000 passengers heading west from 
the port of Buffalo.[20][better source needed] Grain and commercial goods 
shipments led to repeated expansion of the harbor.[citation needed] In 
1843, the world's first steam-powered grain elevator was constructed by 
local merchant Joseph Dart and engineer Robert Dunbar.[21] "Dart's Elevator" 
enabled faster unloading of lake freighters along with the transshipment 
of grain in bulk from barges, canal boats, and rail cars.[22] By 1850, 
the city's population was 81,000.[18] At the dawn of the 20th century, 
local mills were among the first to benefit from hydroelectric power generated 
by the Niagara River. The city got the nickname City of Light at this time 
due to the widespread electric lighting.[citation needed] It was also part 
of the automobile revolution, hosting the brass era car builders Pierce 
Arrow and the Seven Little Buffaloes early in the century.[23] President 
William McKinley was shot and mortally wounded at the Pan-American Exposition 
in Buffalo on September 6, 1901.[24] He died in the city eight days later[25] 
and Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in at the Wilcox Mansion as the 26th President 
of the United States.[25] The Great Depression of 1929–39 saw severe unemployment, 
especially among working class men. The New Deal relief programs operated 
full force. The city became a stronghold of labor unions and the Democratic 
Party.[26] During World War II, Buffalo saw the return of prosperity and 
full employment due to its position as a manufacturing center.[27][28] 
With the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1957, which cut the city 
off from valuable trade routes; deindustrialization; and the nationwide 
trend of suburbanization; the city's economy began to deteriorate.[29][30] 
Like much of the Rust Belt, Buffalo, home to more than half a million people 
in the 1950s, has seen its population decline as heavy industries shut 
down and people left for the suburbs or other cities.[29][30][31] Like 
other rust belt cities such as Pittsburgh and Cleveland, Buffalo has attempted 
to revitalize its beleaguered economy and crumbling infrastructure. In 
the first decade of the 21st century, a massive increase in economic development 
spending has attempted to reverse its dwindling prosperity. In the early 
2010s, growth from local colleges and universities continued to spur economic 
development. Buffalo is on Lake Erie's eastern end, opposite Fort Erie, 
Ontario, and at the beginning of the Niagara River, which flows northward 
over Niagara Falls and into Lake Ontario. The city is 50 miles (80 km) 
south-southeast from Toronto. Buffalo's position on Lake Erie, facing westward, 
makes it one of the few major cities on the East Coast to have sunsets 
over a body of water. According to the United States Census Bureau, the 
city has a total area of 52.5 square miles (136 km2), of which 40.6 square 
miles (105 km2) is land and 11.9 square miles (31 km2) is water. The total 
area is 22.66% water. Buffalo's architecture is diverse, with a collection 
of buildings the 19th and 20th centuries.[32] Most structures and works 
are still standing, such as the country's largest intact parks system designed 
by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.[33] At the end of the 19th century, 
the Guaranty Building—constructed by Louis Sullivan—was a prominent example 
of an early high-rise skyscraper.[34][35] The 20th century saw works such 
as the Art Deco-style Buffalo City Hall and Buffalo Central Terminal, Electric 
Tower, the Richardson Olmsted Complex, and the Rand Building. Urban renewal 
from the 1950s–1970s gave way to the construction of the Brutalist-style 
Buffalo City Court Building and the One Seneca Tower—formerly the HSBC 
Center, the city's tallest building.[36] Buffalo has a continental-type 
climate, which is common in the Great Lakes region. (Köppen climate classification 
"Dfb" – uniform precipitation distribution).[37][38] Buffalo has snowy 
winters, but it is rarely the snowiest city in New York state.[39][40] 
The Blizzard of 1977 resulted from a combination of high winds and snow 
previously accumulated on land and on frozen Lake Erie.[41] Snow does not 
typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage 
during the autumn as with the October 2006 storm.[42][43] In November 2014, 
the region had a record-breaking storm, producing over five and a half 
feet (1.7 metres) of snow (168 cm).[44] Buffalo has the sunniest and driest 
summers of any major city in the Northeast, but still has enough rain to 
keep vegetation green and lush.[38] Summers are marked by plentiful sunshine 
and moderate humidity and temperature.[38] Obscured by the notoriety of 
Buffalo's winter snow is the fact Buffalo benefits from other lake effects 
such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently 
temper the warmest days.[38] As a result, temperatures only rise above 
90 °F (32.2 °C) three times per year,[38] and the Buffalo station of the 
National Weather Service has never recorded an official temperature of 
100 °F (37.8 °C) or more.[45] Rainfall is moderate but typically occurs 
at night. Lake Erie's stabilizing effect continues to inhibit thunderstorms 
and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July.[38] 
August usually has more showers and is hotter and more humid as the warmer 
lake loses its temperature-stabilizing influence.[38] The highest recorded 
temperature in Buffalo was 99 °F (37 °C) on August 27, 1948,[46] and the 
lowest recorded temperature was −20 °F (−29 °C) on February 9, 1934 and 
February 2, 1961.[47] Like most former industrial cities of the Great Lakes 
region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression 
from suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The city's population 
peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, 
and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since 
then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial 
cities of the region, including Buffalo, was significant; based on the 
2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's population was equivalent to its population 
in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.[citation needed] 
At the 2010 Census, the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic 
White alone), 38.6% Black or African-American, 0.8% American Indian and 
Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two 
or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of 
any race.[58] Since 2003 there has been an ever-growing number of Burmese 
refugees, mostly of the Karen ethnicity, with an estimated 4,665 now residing 
in Buffalo.[59] The median income for a household in the city is $24,536, 
and the median income for a family is $30,614. Males have a median income 
of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The per capita income for the city 
is $14,991. 26.6% of the population and 23.0% of families are below the 
poverty line. Out of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age 
of 18 and 14.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line. 
Buffalo's economic sectors include industrial, light manufacturing, high 
technology and services.[citation needed] The State of New York, with over 
15,000 employees, is the city's largest employer.[60] Other major employers 
include the United States government, Kaleida Health, M&T Bank, the University 
at Buffalo, General Motors, Time Warner Cable, and Tops Friendly Markets.[citation 
needed] In banking, Buffalo is the headquarters of M&T Bank and First Niagara 
Bank. Buffalo is home to Rich Products, Canadian brewer Labatt, cheese 
company Sorrento Lactalis, Delaware North Companies[61] and New Era Cap 
Company. The loss of traditional jobs in manufacturing, rapid suburbanization 
and high labor costs have led to economic decline and made Buffalo one 
of the poorest U.S. cities with populations of more than 250,000 people. 
An estimated 28.7–29.9% of Buffalo residents live below the poverty line, 
behind either only Detroit,[62] or only Detroit and Cleveland.[63] Buffalo's 
median household income of $27,850 is third-lowest among large cities, 
behind only Miami and Cleveland; however the metropolitan area's median 
household income is $57,000.[64] This, in part, has led to the Buffalo-Niagara 
Falls metropolitan area having the most affordable housing market in the 
U.S. The quarterly NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) noted 
nearly 90% of the new and existing homes sold in the metropolitan area 
during the second quarter were affordable to families making the area's 
median income of $57,000.[citation needed] As of 2014[update], the median 
home price in the city was $95,000.[65] Buffalo's economy has begun to 
see significant improvements since the early 2010s.[66] Money from New 
York State Governor Andrew Cuomo through a program known locally as "Buffalo 
Billion" has brought new construction, increased economic development, 
and hundreds of new jobs to the area.[67] As of March 2015, Buffalo's unemployment 
rate was 5.9%,[68] slightly above the national average of 5.5%.[69] In 
2016, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis valued the Buffalo area's economy 
at $54.9 billion.[70] The Buffalo area's varied cuisine is the result of 
variety of cultural contributions, including Italian, Irish, Jewish, German, 
Polish, African-American, Greek, Indian and American influences. In 2015, 
the National Geographic Society ranked Buffalo third on their list of "The 
World's Top Ten Food Cities".[71] Locally owned restaurants offer Chinese, 
German, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Mexican, Italian, Arab, Indian, 
Caribbean, soul food, and French cuisine.[72][73] Buffalo's local pizzerias 
differ from that of the thin-crust New York-style pizzerias and deep-dish 
Chicago-style pizzerias, and is locally known for being a midpoint between 
the two.[74] The Beef on weck sandwich, kielbasa, sponge candy, pastry 
hearts, pierogi, and haddock fish fries are local favorites, as is a loganberry-flavored 
beverage that remains relatively obscure outside of the Western New York 
and Southern Ontario.[75] Teressa Bellissimo first prepared the now widespread 
Buffalo wing at the Anchor Bar on October 3, 1964.[76] Buffalo has several 
well-known food companies. Non-dairy whipped topping was invented in Buffalo 
in 1945 by Robert E. Rich, Sr.[77] His company, Rich Products, is one of 
the city's largest private employers.[78] General Mills was organized in 
Buffalo, and Gold Medal brand flour, Wheaties, Cheerios and other General 
Mills brand cereals are manufactured here. Archer Daniels Midland operates 
its largest flour mill in the city.[79] Buffalo is home to one of the largest 
privately held food companies in the world, Delaware North Companies, which 
operates concessions in sports arenas, stadiums, resorts, and many state 
& federal parks.[80] Buffalo is home to over 50 private and public art 
galleries,[81] most notably the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, home to a world-class 
collection of modern and contemporary art, and the Burchfield-Penney Art 
Center.[citation needed] In 2012, AmericanStyle ranked Buffalo twenty-fifth 
in its list of top mid-sized cities for art.[82] The Buffalo area's largest 
theater is Shea's Performing Arts Center, designed to accommodate 4,000 
people with interiors by Louis Comfort Tiffany. Built in 1926, the theater 
presents Broadway musicals and concerts.[83] The theater community in the 
Buffalo Theater District includes over 20 professional companies.[84][85][86] 
The Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, which performs at Kleinhans Music Hall, 
is one of the city's most prominent performing arts institutions. During 
the 1960s and 1970s, under the musical leadership of Lukas Foss and Michael 
Tilson Thomas, the Philharmonic collaborated with Grateful Dead and toured 
with the Boston Pops Orchestra.[87] Buffalo has the roots of many jazz 
and classical musicians, and it is also the founding city for several mainstream 
bands and musicians, including Rick James, Billy Sheehan, The Quakes and 
The Goo Goo Dolls. Vincent Gallo, a Buffalo-born filmmaker and musician, 
played in several local bands.[citation needed] Jazz fusion band Spyro 
Gyra and jazz saxophonists Grover Washington Jr. also got their starts 
in Buffalo.[citation needed] Pianist and composer Leonard Pennario was 
born in Buffalo in 1924 and made his debut concert at Carnegie Hall in 
1943.[citation needed] Buffalo's "Colored Musicians Club", an extension 
of what was long ago a separate musicians' union local, is thriving today, 
and maintains a significant jazz history within its walls. Well-known indie 
artist Ani DiFranco hails from Buffalo.[citation needed] Festivals have 
become part of the Buffalo's culture and tradition. Though most occur during 
the summer, the city has winter festivals that reflect its snowy reputation. 
Popular summer festivals include the Allentown Art Festival, Taste of Buffalo, 
National Buffalo Wing Festival, Thursday at the Square, and the Juneteenth 
Festival. Winter festivals include the Buffalo Ball Drop,[88] Buffalo Powder 
Keg Festival,[89] and Labatt Blue Pond Hockey.[90] The city of Buffalo's 
points of interest include the Edward M. Cotter fireboat, considered the 
world's oldest active fireboat[91] and is a United States National Historic 
Landmark, Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens, the Buffalo and Erie 
County Historical Society,[92] Buffalo Museum of Science,[93] the Buffalo 
Zoo, the third oldest zoo in the United States,[94] Forest Lawn Cemetery, 
Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, the Anchor Bar, and Darwin 
D. Martin House. Buffalo and the surrounding region is home to two major 
league professional sports teams. The NHL's Buffalo Sabres play in the 
City of Buffalo, and the NFL's Buffalo Bills play in suburban Orchard Park, 
New York. Buffalo is also home to several minor sports teams, including 
the Buffalo Bisons (baseball; an affiliate of the MLB's Toronto Blue Jays), 
Buffalo Bandits (indoor lacrosse) and FC Buffalo (soccer) as well as a 
professional women's team the Buffalo Beauts (Hockey). The Buffalo Bulls 
are a Division I college team representing the State University of New 
York at Buffalo, and several other Buffalo-area colleges and universities 
are also active in college athletics. The Buffalo Bills, established in 
1959, played in War Memorial Stadium until 1973, when New Era Field was 
constructed. The team competes in the AFC East division. Since the AFL–NFL 
merger in 1970, the Bills have won the AFC conference championship four 
consecutive times (1990, 1991, 1992, 1993), resulting in four lost Super 
Bowls. The Buffalo Sabres, established in 1970, played in Buffalo Memorial 
Auditorium until 1996, when Marine Midland Arena, now KeyBank Center, opened. 
The team is within the Atlantic Division of the NHL. The team has won one 
Presidents' Trophy (2006–07) and three conference championships (1974–75, 
1979–80, 1998–99). However, like the Buffalo Bills, the team does not have 
a league championship. The Buffalo Bandits, established in 1992, played 
their home games in Buffalo Memorial Auditorium until their move to Marine 
Midland Arena. They have won eight division championships and four league 
championships (1992, 1993, 1996, 2008). * American Football League (AFL) 
championships were earned prior to the NFL merging with the AFL. † Date 
refers to current incarnation; Buffalo Bisons previously operated from 
the 1870s until 1970 and the current Bisons count this team as part of 
their history. The Buffalo parks system has over 20 parks with several 
parks accessible from any part of the city. The Olmsted Park and Parkway 
System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of 
city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, 
eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Constructed 
in 1868 by Frederick Law Olmsted and his partner Calvert Vaux, the system 
was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to 
lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted 
designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks 
Conservancy (BOPC), a non-profit, for public benefit corporation which 
serves as the cities parks department. It is the first non-governmental 
organization of its kind to serve in such a capacity in the US.[96] Situated 
at the confluence of Lake Erie and the Buffalo River and Niagara Rivers, 
Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through 
its waterways in the form of transshipment, manufacturing, and an endless 
source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, 
a hub of commerce, trade, and industry. Beginning in 2009, a significant 
portion of Buffalo's waterfront began to be transformed into a focal point 
for social and recreational activity. To this end, Buffalo Harbor State 
Park, nicknamed "Outer Harbor", was opened in 2014.[97] Buffalo's intent 
was to stress its architectural and historical heritage to create a tourism 
destination, and early data indicates that they were successful.[98] At 
the municipal level, the City of Buffalo has a mayor and a council of nine 
councilmembers. Buffalo also serves as the seat of Erie County with some 
of the 11 members of county legislature representing at least a portion 
of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state assemblymembers and 
two state senators representing parts of the city proper. At the federal 
level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the House of Representatives. 
In a trend common to northern "Rust Belt" regions, the Democratic Party 
has dominated Buffalo's political life for the last half-century. The last 
time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo 
was Chester A. Kowal in 1965. In 1977, Democratic Mayor James D. Griffin 
was elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the Conservative Party 
and the Right to Life Party, after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor 
to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker Arthur Eve. Griffin switched political 
allegiances several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing 
to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat Anthony M. 
Masiello (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on social conservatism, 
often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, 
however, Democrat Byron Brown was elected the city's first African-American 
mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over Republican Kevin Helfer, who ran on 
a conservative platform. In 2013, the Conservative Party endorsed Brown 
because of his pledge to cut taxes.[citation needed] This change in local 
politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic 
decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city 
deep in debt and on the edge of bankruptcy. At New York State Comptroller 
Alan Hevesi's urging, the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, 
appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Mayor Tony Masiello 
began conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County 
government the following year, but they came to naught. The offices of 
the Buffalo District, US Army Corps of Engineers are next to the Black 
Rock Lock in the Erie Canal's Black Rock channel. In addition to maintaining 
and operating the lock, the District plans, designs, constructs and maintains 
water resources projects from Toledo, Ohio to Massena, New York. These 
include the flood-control dam at Mount Morris, New York, oversight of the 
lower Great Lakes (Lake Erie and Lake Ontario), review and permitting of 
wetlands construction, and remedial action for hazardous waste sites. Buffalo 
is also the home of a major office of the National Weather Service (NOAA), 
which serves all of western and much of central New York State. Buffalo 
is home to one of the 56 national FBI field offices. The field office covers 
all of Western New York and parts of the Southern Tier and Central New 
York. The field office operates several task forces in conjunction with 
local agencies to help combat issues such as gang violence, terrorism threats 
and health care fraud.[99] Buffalo is also the location of the chief judge, 
United States Attorney, and administrative offices for the United States 
District Court for the Western District of New York. Buffalo Public Schools 
serve most of the city of Buffalo. The city has 78 public schools, including 
a growing number of charter schools. As of 2006[update], the total enrollment 
was 41,089 students with a student-teacher ratio of 13.5 to 1. The graduation 
rate is up to 52% in 2008, up from 45% in 2007, and 50% in 2006.[100] More 
than 27% of teachers have a master's degree or higher and the median amount 
of experience in the field is 15 years. When considering the entire metropolitan 
area, there are 292 schools educating 172,854 students.[101] Buffalo's 
magnet school system features schools that attract students with special 
interests, such as science, bilingual studies, and Native American studies. 
Specialized facilities include the Buffalo Elementary School of Technology; 
the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Multicultural Institute; the International 
School; the Dr. Charles R. Drew Science Magnet; BUILD Academy; Leonardo 
da Vinci High School; PS 32 Bennett Park Montessori; the Buffalo Academy 
for Visual and Performing Arts, BAVPA; the Riverside Institute of Technology; 
Lafayette High School/Buffalo Academy of Finance; Hutchinson Central Technical 
High School; Burgard Vocational High School; South Park High School; and 
the Emerson School of Hospitality. The city is home to 47 private schools 
and the metropolitan region has 150 institutions. Most private schools, 
such as Bishop Timon - St. Jude High School, Canisius High School, Mount 
Mercy Academy, and Nardin Academy have a Catholic affiliation. In addition, 
there are two Islamic schools, Darul Uloom Al-Madania and Universal School 
of Buffalo. There are also nonsectarian options including The Buffalo Seminary 
(the only private, nonsectarian, all-girls school in Western New York state),[102] 
Nichols School and numerous Charter Schools. Complementing its standard 
function, the Buffalo Public Schools Adult and Continuing Education Division 
provides education and services to adults throughout the community.[103] 
In addition, the Career and Technical Education Department offers more 
than 20 academic programs, and is attended by about 6,000 students each 
year.[104] The State University of New York (SUNY) operates three institutions 
within the city of Buffalo. The University at Buffalo is known as "Buffalo" 
and is the largest public university in New York.[105] The University at 
Buffalo is the only university in Buffalo and is a nationally ranked tier 
1 research university.[106] Buffalo State College and Erie Community College 
are a college and a community college, respectively. Additionally, the 
private institutions Canisius College and D'Youville College are located 
within the city. The city is home to two private healthcare systems, which 
combined operate eight hospitals and countless clinics in the greater metropolitan 
area, as well as three public hospitals operated by Erie County and the 
State of New York. Buffalo General/Gates Vascular Institute have earned 
top rankings in the US for their cutting edge research and treatment into 
stroke and neurological care. ECMC has been accredited as a Level One Trauma 
Center and serves as the trauma and burn care center for Western New York, 
much of the Southern Tier as well as portions of Northwestern Pennsylvania 
and Ontario, Canada. Over the years, Roswell Park has also become recognized 
as one of the United State's leading cancer treatment and research centers, 
and each year recruits physicians and researchers from across the world 
to come live and work in the Buffalo area. Catholic Health Kaleida Health 
The Erie County Medical Center (ECMC) (Eastern Buffalo) Roswell Park Cancer 
Institute (Downtown Buffalo) The Buffalo State Hospital (State operated 
facility for the mentally ill, located in Northwest Buffalo) The Niagara 
Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) operates Buffalo Niagara International 
Airport, reconstructed in 1997 and located in the suburb of Cheektowaga.[citation 
needed] The airport serves Western New York and much of the Finger Lakes 
and Southern Tier Regions. The Buffalo Metro Rail, also operated by the 
NFTA, is a 6.4 miles (10.3 km) long,[citation needed] single line light 
rail system that extends from Erie Canal Harbor in downtown Buffalo to 
the University Heights district (specifically, the South Campus of University 
at Buffalo) in the city's northeastern part.[citation needed] The line's 
downtown section runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers.[citation 
needed] North of Theater Station, at the northern end of downtown, the 
line moves underground until it reaches its northern terminus at University 
Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.[citation 
needed] Two train stations, Buffalo-Depew and Buffalo-Exchange Street serve 
the city, and are operated by Amtrak. Historically, the city was a major 
stop on through routes between Chicago and New York City through the lower 
Ontario peninsula.[107] Buffalo is at the Lake Erie's eastern end, and 
it serves as a playground for many personal yachts, sailboats, power boats 
and watercraft.[citation needed] The city's extensive breakwall system 
protects its inner and outer harbors, which are maintained at commercial 
navigation depths for Great Lakes freighters.[citation needed] A Lake Erie 
tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the Buffalo River and Buffalo 
Creek.[citation needed] Eight New York State highways, one three-digit 
Interstate Highway and one U.S. Highway traverse the city of Buffalo. New 
York State Route 5, commonly referred to as Main Street within the city[citation 
needed], enters through Lackawanna as a limited-access highway and intersects 
with Interstate 190, a north-south highway connecting Interstate 90 in 
the southeastern suburb of Cheektowaga with Niagara Falls. NY 354 (Clinton 
Street) and NY 130 (Broadway) are east to west highways connecting south 
and downtown Buffalo to the eastern suburbs of West Seneca and Depew. NY 
265 (Delaware Avenue) and NY 266 (Niagara Street and Military Road) both 
start in downtown Buffalo and end in the city of Tonawanda. One of three 
U.S. highways in Erie County, the other two being U.S. 20 and U.S. 219, 
U.S. 62 (Bailey Avenue) is a north to south trunk road that enters the 
city through Lackawanna and exits at the Amherst town border at a junction 
with NY 5. Within the city, the route passes by light industrial developments 
and high density areas of the city. Bailey Avenue has major intersections 
with Interstate 190 and the Kensington Expressway. Three major expressways 
serve the city of Buffalo. The Scajaquada Expressway (NY 198) is primarily 
a limited access highway connecting Interstate 190 near Unity Island to 
New York State Route 33. The Kensington Expressway (NY 33) starts at the 
edge of downtown and the city's East Side, continues through heavily populated 
areas of the city, intersects with Interstate 90 in Cheektowaga and ends 
at the airport. The Peace Bridge is a major international crossing near 
the city's Black Rock district. The bridge connects Fort Erie, Ontario 
with the city.[citation needed] Buffalo's water system is operated by Veolia 
Water.[108] To reduce large-scale ice blockage in the Niagara River, with 
resultant flooding, ice damage to docks and other waterfront structures, 
and blockage of the water intakes for the hydro-electric power plants at 
Niagara Falls, the New York Power Authority and Ontario Power Generation 
have jointly operated the Lake Erie-Niagara River Ice Boom since 1964.[citation 
needed] The boom is installed on December 16, or when the water temperature 
reaches 4 °C (39 °F), whichever happens first.[citation needed] The boom 
is opened on April 1 unless there is more than 650 square kilometres (250 sq mi) 
of ice remaining in Eastern Lake Erie.[citation needed] When in place, 
the boom stretches 2,680 metres (8,790 ft) from the outer breakwall at 
Buffalo Harbor almost to the Canadian shore near the ruins of the pier 
at Erie Beach in Fort Erie.[citation needed] Originally, the boom was made 
of wooden timbers, but these have been replaced by steel pontoons.[109]

The Buffalo area is home to 14 AM stations and 21 FM stations. Major station 
operators include Entercom, Townsquare Media and Cumulus Media. In addition, 
National Public Radio operates a publicly funded station, WBFO 88.7.[citation

is the 52nd largest in the United States as of 2013[update].[110] Although 
no major cable outlets have offices or bureaus in the Buffalo area, the 
four major networks have established affiliates in the area: WGRZ 2 (NBC), 
WIVB-TV 4 (CBS), WUTV 29 (FOX), and WKBW-TV 7 (ABC).[citation needed] Other 
stations in Buffalo with network affiliations include publicly funded WNED-TV 
17 (PBS), WNLO 23 (The CW), WNYO-TV 49 (MyNetworkTV), and WBBZ-TV 67 (MeTV/independent).[citation

the system-exclusive Time Warner Cable News Buffalo, part of the statewide 
Time Warner Cable News network.[citation needed] The Buffalo market also 
has access to multiple Canadian broadcast stations over-the-air from the 
Hamilton and Toronto areas, though only CBLT 5 (CBC) and CFTO 9 (CTV) are 
carried on Time Warner Cable.[citation needed] Movies shot with significant

Although additional movies, such as Promised Land (2012), have used Buffalo 
as a setting, filming often takes place in other locations such as Pittsburgh 
or Canada. High production costs are blamed for filmmakers shooting all 
or most of their Buffalo-based scenes elsewhere.[114] Buffalo is one of 
the largest Polish-American centers in the United States. As a result, 
many aspects of Polish culture have found a home within the city from food 
to festivals. One of the best example's is the yearly celebration of Easter 
Monday, known to many Eastern Europeans as Dyngus Day.[115] Buffalo has 
a number of sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International
