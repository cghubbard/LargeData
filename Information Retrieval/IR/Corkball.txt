Corkball is a "mini-baseball" game featuring a 1.6-ounce (45 g) ball, which 
is stitched and resembles a miniature baseball. The bat has a barrel that 
measures 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. Originally played on the streets 
and alleys of St. Louis, Missouri as early as 1890,[1] today the game has 
leagues formed around the country as a result of St. Louis servicemen introducing 
the game to their buddies during World War II and the Korean War. It has 
many of the features of baseball, yet can be played in a very small area 
because there is no base-running.[2] Corkball uses a 1.6-ounce (45 g) ball, 
which is stitched and resembles a baseball. The bat has a barrel that measures 
up to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter and a maximum of 38 inches (97 cm) 
in length. Playing fields are traditionally 30 feet (9.1 m) in width and 
250 feet (76 m) in length. Different measurements are paced off to determine 
hits. A batter must hit the ball at least 15 feet (4.6 m) in order to register 
a hit. Any hit between 15 feet (4.6 m) and 150 feet (46 m) is a single, 
up to 200 feet (61 m) is a double, up to 250 feet (76 m) is a triple and 
beyond 250 feet (76 m) is a home run. Measurements can be modified based 
on available conditions. Baserunning is non existent due to the measured 
hits. Teams have a minimum of two players (pitcher and catcher) and a maximum 
of five players on the field at a time. Fielders may wear baseball gloves 
but are not required to. The catcher must wear a catcher's mask while behind 
the plate. Pitching rubber and home plate are the same as used in baseball. 
"Runners" advance as many bases as the batter gets on the hit. If a runner 
is on first and the batter hits a double, then the resulting runners will 
be on second and third. If a runner is on first and the batter hits a single,
