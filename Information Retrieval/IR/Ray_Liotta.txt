Democratic club.[1][4] His adoptive parents both unsuccessfully ran for 
local office.[5] He has a sister, Linda Liotta, who is also adopted. Liotta

After research and talks with his biological mother, he learned he is part

about them. Horses are unbelievable: Smart, loyal -- and moody, [laughing] 
which I can relate to."[6] On February 19, 2007, Liotta was arrested under 
suspicion of driving under the influence after crashing his Cadillac Escalade 
into two parked vehicles in Pacific Palisades.[27] He pleaded no contest.[28]
