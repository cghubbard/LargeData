Patrick Henry "Patsy" Dougherty (October 27, 1876 in Andover, New York 
â€“ April 30, 1940 in Bolivar, New York) was a Major League Baseball outfielder. 
Dougherty was the first player to hit two home runs in a single World Series 
game, doing so on October 2, 1903 with the Boston Americans in the first 
and sixth innings of Game 2 of the 1903 World Series, the first modern 
World Series. By doing so, he became the first player for the Red Sox to 
hit a World Series home run.[1] In that game he was the only man to hit 
a leadoff inside-the-park World Series home run until 2015, when Kansas 
City Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar did it in Game 1. Dougherty died 
in Bolivar, NY at the age of 63 and was buried at St. Mary Catholic Cemetery
