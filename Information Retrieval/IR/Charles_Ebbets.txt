Charles Hercules Ebbets, Sr. (October 29, 1859â€“April 18, 1925) was an American 
sports executive who owned the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1902 to 1925.[1] Ebbets 
was born in New York City and was a draftsman and architect who designed 
numerous New York City buildings, including the Metropolitan Hotel and 
Niblo's Garden. He served on the Brooklyn City Council for four years, 
and was a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly (Kings Co., 
12th D.) in 1896.[1] Ebbets started with the Dodgers as a bookkeeper in 
1883 and became a shareholder in 1890. He took an active role in marketing 
baseball to families and took over the Dodgers' team operations in 1898. 
He also managed the Dodgers that year and the team finished tenth. Ned 
Hanlon, the owner and manager of the Baltimore Orioles, bought some of 
the remaining stock in the Dodgers after the 1898 season and took the best 
Baltimore players to the Brooklyn team. The Dodgers won pennants in both 
1899 and 1900. In 1905, Hanlon wanted to move the team to Baltimore, but 
Ebbets bought out his shares. Ebbets is credited with inventing the concept 
of the rain check and of proposing a player draft favoring teams which 
finished low in the standings. He financed the building of Ebbets Field 
in 1912 by selling half his shares in the team to the McKeever Brothers. 
Ebbets died of heart failure at age 65 in New York City and is interred
