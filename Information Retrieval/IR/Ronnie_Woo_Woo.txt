Ronnie "Woo Woo" Wickers (born October 31, 1941[1]) is a longtime Chicago 
Cubs fan and local celebrity in the Chicago area. He is known to Wrigley 
Field visitors for his idiosyncratic cheers at baseball games, generally 
punctuated with an exclamatory "Woo!" (e.g., "Cubs, woo! Cubs, woo! Big-Z, 
woo! Zambrano, woo! Cubs, woo!") Longtime Cubs announcer Harry Caray dubbed 
Wickers "Leather Lungs" for his ability to shout for hours at a time.[2] 
Wickers grew up on the South Side of Chicago. Born premature and abused 
by his mother, he was raised by his grandmother, who brought him to his 
first Chicago Cubs games during the late 1940s.[3] Wickers explained in 
a 2004 Chicago Tribune interview that he started "wooing" in 1958 or 1959. 
"It just came to be. I had fun with it," he remarked.[1] He has remained 
a fixture at Wrigley Field ever since, even singing "Take Me Out to the 
Ball Game" during a May 24, 2001 game.[4] In 2005, filmmaker Paul Hoffman 
released a documentary film about Wickers, called WooLife. The film premiered 
at the Chicago Historical Society.[3] Wickers worked nights as a custodian 
at Northwestern University for much of his life. After the deaths of both 
his grandmother and girlfriend in the 1980s, a distraught Wickers found 
himself homeless and without a stable job.[5] From 1984 to 1990, he attended 
Cubs games with donated tickets.[2] Wickers was absent at Wrigley Field 
games for a brief period in 1987, which prompted some Cubs fans to worry 
that he had died. He eventually contacted news organizations to say that 
he was alive and well.[6] Since 1990, most of Wickers' income has come 
from washing windows in the neighborhood around Wrigley Field. He also 
makes paid appearances at parties and has starred in local commercials.[1] 
In 2000, two Wrigleyville bar owners organized a much-publicized fundraiser 
to provide Wickers with a new pair of dentures.[3] Wickers was treated 
and released from Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical center after being 
hit by a car after a Cubs game on April 18, 2005. He has since recovered. 
Upon leaving Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical center he was struck by 
another vehicle and was released on April 29, 2005.[7] As of 2016, Ronnie 
is still attending Cubs games, taking pictures with fans and tourists alike.
