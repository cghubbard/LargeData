The St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers are the 19 teams that represent St. Francis 
College in athletics. The Terriers are members of the NCAA Division I and 
participate in the Northeast Conference, with the exception of the men's 
and women's water polo teams which compete in the CWPA and the MAAC, respectively. 
In 2006, St. Francis College added women's bowling, while dropping baseball 
and softball.[2] St. Francis College previously sponsored a football team, 
but the program was dropped in 1935. In 2007, Irma Garcia, '88, became 
the athletic director of the Terriers replacing longtime director Edward 
Aquilone, '60. As of 2010, she is the country's only female Latina athletic 
director in Division I sports.[3][4] For the 2014–15 academic year, Garcia 
was named NACWAA D1 (FCS) Administrator of the Year.[5] The award was in 
part because of the Terriers success in Men's Soccer (NEC Champions and 
NCAA Tournament Participants), Men's Basketball (NEC Regular Season Champions 
and NIT Participants) and Women's Basketball (NEC Champions and NCAA Tournament 
Participants). Beginning on November 27, 2012, St. Francis College rebranded 
its Athletics programs from St. Francis (NY) to St. Francis Brooklyn.[6]

Terrier teams play in the Battle of Brooklyn tournament against the Blackbirds, 
which has been played annually since 1974–75.[8] The Terriers also compete 
against Wagner College Seahawks, and it is referred to as Battle of the

College in Staten Island by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The Battle of 
the Verrazano dates back to the 1973–74 season.[9] The St. Francis College’s
