The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2005 season was the franchise's 45th 
since its inception. The regular season ended with a record of 95-67, resulting 
in the Angels winning the American League West division title for the second 
consecutive season, its fifth in franchise history. In the postseason, 
the Angels defeated the New York Yankees in the American League Division 
Series, 3-2, but were subsequently defeated by the eventual World Series 
champion Chicago White Sox in the American League Championship Series, 
4-1. The season was also notable for being the first the team played under 
its controversial present-day "Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim" moniker.

the AL Central champion Chicago White Sox. The series began on October

but after an incredibly controversial second game loss, the Angels dropped 
the next three and lost the series 4–1. Because of the controversy surrounding 
game two, Angel fans to this day (as of the 2013 season) give A. J. Pierzynski 
a poor welcome at Angel Stadium and still think that Doug Eddings suffers 
from "Dumbass Umpire Syndrome". Note: Major League Baseball's playoff format
