As player As manager Joseph "Joe" James Quinn (December 25, 1864[1] – November 
12, 1940) was an Australian second baseman who played 17 seasons in Major 
League Baseball. Born in Ipswich, Queensland, to Patrick Quinn and Catherine, 
née McAfee, both from Ireland,[2] he was the only Australian-born player 
to reach the major leagues until 1986. Quinn started his career in 1884 
with the Union Association's St. Louis Maroons, which won the pennant. 
He was one of few players from that league to later find success in the 
National League. Throughout his career, Quinn was known for his defensive 
skills, and he led NL second basemen in fielding percentage twice. Quinn 
also had two stints as a big league manager, with the St. Louis Browns 
in 1895 and the Cleveland Spiders in 1899. His Browns club went 11–28 under 
his guidance, and the Spiders were even worse, going 12–104. His career 
.148 winning percentage is one of the lowest in baseball history. He was, 
as a player, arguably the best hitter on the Spiders team that he managed, 
which is considered to have been the worst team in major league history. 
In 1894 and 1896, he served as an umpire for the National League. In the 
offseason, Quinn was a mortician, and he owned a funeral home after his 
playing days ended. He died at age 75 in St. Louis, Missouri. Quinn was 
inducted into the Baseball Australia Hall of Fame on 4 May 2013. In 2014, 
the Australian sports writer Rochelle Llewelyn Nicholls published a biography 
of Joe "Undertaker" Quinn as Joe Quinn – Among the Rowdies.[3][4] Notes
