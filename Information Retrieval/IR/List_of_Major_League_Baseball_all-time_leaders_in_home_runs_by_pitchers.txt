In baseball, a home run (HR) is typically a fair hit that passes over an 
outfield fence or into the stands at a distance from home base of 250 feet 
or more, which entitles the batter to legally touch all bases and score 
without liability.[1][2] Atypically, a batter who hits a fair ball and 
touches each base in succession from 1st to home, without an error being 
charged to a defensive player, is credited with an inside-the-park home 
run.[3][4] If, during a play, defensive or fan interference is called, 
and the awarded bases allow the batter to cross home plate, the batter 
is credited with a home run.[3][5] Wes Ferrell holds the all-time Major 
League Baseball record for home runs hit while playing the position of 
pitcher. He hit 37 as a pitcher.[6] Baseball Hall of Famers Bob Lemon and 
Warren Spahn are tied for second with 35 career home runs apiece.[7][8] 
Red Ruffing, Earl Wilson, and Don Drysdale are the only other pitchers 
to hit at least 25 home runs.[9][10][11] Jack Stivetts hit a total of 35 
home runs in his playing career, 21 as a pitcher.[12] Madison Bumgarner, 
with 14 home runs, holds the lead among all active pitchers. Ferrell also 
holds the single-season record for home runs by a pitcher, with nine, a 
mark that he reached in 1931.[6] The record had previously been held by 
Stivetts, who had hit seven in 1890.[12] Since 1931, six different pitchers 
have hit seven home runs in a season: Ferrell, Lemon, Don Newcombe, Don 
Drysdale (twice), Wilson, and Mike Hampton.[6][7][10][11][13][14] The first 
pitcher to officially hit a home run was Jack Manning, who accomplished 
the feat on August 3, 1876.[15] The most home runs by a pitcher in a single 
game is three, achieved by Jim Tobin on May 13, 1942.[16] Noah Syndergaard 
of the New York Mets hit two home runs in one game win against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, 4-3 on May 11 2016. Both of his home runs accounted for
