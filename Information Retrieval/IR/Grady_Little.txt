As manager As coach William Grady Little (born March 30, 1950) is a former 
manager in Major League Baseball, currently working in the front office 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He managed the Boston Red Sox from 2002 to 2003 
and the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2006 to 2007. He was inducted into the 
Kinston, North Carolina, Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001 and 
was inducted into the Hagerstown Suns Hall of Fame on April 13, 2009. In 
his second season with the Red Sox, Little guided the team to a record 
of 95–66 and an appearance in the 2003 American League Championship Series 
against the New York Yankees. Despite his accomplishments, Little is best 
remembered for his decision to leave starting pitcher Pedro Martinez in 
the eighth inning of Game 7 while the Red Sox held a three run lead, and 
faced blame for the team's subsequent loss when the Yankees were able to 
tie the score and win in extra innings. He graduated from Garinger High 
School in Charlotte, North Carolina, before he was selected by the Atlanta 
Braves in the 12th round of the 1968 MLB Draft. After spending the 1969 
season in the Marine reserves, Grady played in 167 games as a catcher over 
five minor-league seasons in the Braves and New York Yankees organizations. 
He posted a career .207 batting average with two home runs and 37 runs 
batted in. He retired from playing in 1973. From 1996 to 2001, Little served 
as a coach for the Padres, Red Sox, and Indians.[1] Grady Little is currently 
the Director of Baseball Operations and Head Coach of the Men's Varsity 
Baseball team at Hickory Grove Christian School in Charlotte, NC.[2] Little 
became a player–coach for the West Haven Yankees while still playing in 
1971 and continued through his retirement as a player, remaining as a coach 
with West Haven until 1974. During the 1975–79 seasons he stayed away from 
baseball and worked as a cotton farmer. He managed in the minor leagues 
for 16 years, compiling a record of 1,054–903 (.539). The minor league 
teams he managed: While manager of the Durham Bulls, Little served as Baseball 
Trainer for the movie Bull Durham.[3] In March 2002, the Boston Red Sox 
hired Little as their manager. Little was enormously popular with his players 
as he enhanced the loose nature of the clubhouse and supported struggling 
players. His tenure was successful, as the Red Sox won a combined 188 games 
in his two seasons and nearly took the pennant in 2003. However, the 2003 
season (and Little's entire tenure with the Red Sox) is mostly remembered 
for his controversial decision during Game 7 of the 2003 American League 
Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The Red Sox led the game 
5–2 in the 8th inning, and were five outs away from reaching the World 
Series. Little visited the mound after starting pitcher Pedro Martínez 
gave up three straight hits, and a run from Derek Jeter, but he decided 
against taking out the ace pitcher, who had thrown 118 pitches to that 
point. The Yankees tied the game the next at-bat when Jorge Posada hit 
a two-run double, and went on to win the game (and the pennant) in the 
11th inning off of a home run by Aaron Boone. Little was the target of 
great angst in the aftermath of the Red Sox' loss (which turned out to 
be the final manifestation of the so-called Curse of the Bambino). Critics 
pointed out that Martinez' ERA almost tripled when his pitch count exceeded 
100, and the Red Sox had three well-rested relief pitchers (Alan Embree, 
Mike Timlin, and Scott Williamson) in the bullpen waiting to take over 
in the eighth inning with a three-run lead. In fact, the strong performance 
of the bullpen in relief of Martinez that day would seem to suggest that 
Little's decision was ultimately responsible for the Game 7 ALCS result. 
Supporters responded that Little's decision to trust Martinez was in keeping 
with his intuitive style that had brought the Red Sox that far in the first 
place. Nevertheless, the management made the determination that the Red 
Sox needed a change, and decided not to renew Little's contract, instead 
hiring Terry Francona who would go on to manage the club from 2004 to 2011 
and lead them to World Series titles in 2004 and 2007. When Little's contract 
was not renewed by the Red Sox, the independent minor league Brockton Rox 
announced plans to give away Grady Little bobble arm dolls to the first 
1,000 fans to attend the May 29, 2004 game. The doll's arm bounces to simulate 
a manager's call to the bullpen, displays the date October 16, 2003 (the 
date of Game 7 of the ALCS) and Little's win total from the 2002 and 2003 
seasons. The plans were canceled when Little objected to his likeness being 
used. In an agreement with the Rox, Little permitted the dolls to be sold 
with the provision that the money raised from the sale would go "to the 
Professional Baseball Scouting Foundation, which provides relief to retired 
scouts in financial peril".[4][5][6] The initial selling price was $38.36 
(two times $19.18, 1918 being the last time the Red Sox won the World Series) 
but later auctions of autographed versions sold for as high as $255.[7] 
Little spent 2004 and 2005 as a consultant, instructor, and scout with 
the Chicago Cubs. On December 8, 2005, after an organizational shakeup 
that resulted in the dismissal of both manager Jim Tracy and GM Paul DePodesta, 
the Los Angeles Dodgers turned to Little to be the team's 7th manager since 
its 1958 move to L.A. As manager of the Dodgers, Little was reunited with 
several players from the 2002–2003 Boston team, including pitcher Derek 
Lowe, third baseman Bill Mueller, and shortstop-turned-first baseman Nomar 
Garciaparra. Little and new GM Ned Colletti were widely credited for bringing 
a fresh outlook to a team that had been wracked by instability over the 
previous decade. The Dodgers won 88 games in 2006 and earned the NL wild-card 
spot in the playoffs during Little's first season; however, they were swept 
by the New York Mets in the NLDS. Plagued by injuries to several key players 
and fielding a lineup loaded with youngsters, the Dodgers failed to reach 
the playoffs in 2007. Dodgers GM Ned Colletti initially confirmed that 
Little would return as manager of the ballclub in 2008. However, Little 
appeared hesitant to do so after Colletti partly blamed him and his staff 
for the Dodgers' disappointing 2007 season. Little failed to contact Colletti 
for over two weeks. This resulted in Colletti entering into a tentative 
agreement with Joe Girardi, and when it fell through, negotiations with 
Joe Torre. Citing personal reasons, Little subsequently resigned on October 
30, 2007.[8] On December 8, 2014, Little joined the Pittsburgh Pirates 
as a senior advisor to the team's front office.[9] Little with his wife, 
Debi, have a son, Eric, and three grandchildren (Braden, Luke, and Jace).
