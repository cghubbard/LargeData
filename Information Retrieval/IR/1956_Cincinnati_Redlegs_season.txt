The 1956 Cincinnati Redlegs season consisted of the Redlegs finishing in 
third place in the National League with a record of 91–63, two games behind 
the NL Champion Brooklyn Dodgers. The Redlegs were managed by Birdie Tebbetts 
and played their home games at Crosley Field. The Redlegs were in first 
place at mid-season and stayed in the pennant race until the last day of 
the season, ending up with a 91–63 record, two games behind the Brooklyn 
Dodgers.[4] For his efforts, the Baseball Writers' Association of America 
voted Birdie Tebbetts as the 1956 Manager of the Year.[5] The 1956 Redlegs 
tied the National League and MLB record for home runs in a season, hitting 
221 over a 155 regular-season games. (The 1947 Giants also slugged 221 
in 155 games played.) Three Redlegs hit more than 35 homers, with Frank 
Robinson (38) establishing a record for rookies; Wally Post (36) and Ted 
Kluszewski (35) were the others. Gus Bell (29) and Ed Bailey (28) came 
within reach of the 30-home-run mark, Bailey in only 383 at bats. The mark 
stood until 1961, when the New York Yankees hit 240 homers in the first 
year of the modern 162-game schedule. On Sunday, June 24, following a doubleheader 
sweep of the Brooklyn Dodgers,[6] eleven Redlegs players appeared on the 
panel quiz show What's My Line?.[7] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
