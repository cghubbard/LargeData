Michael Warren "Mike" Scott (born April 26, 1955) is an American former 
right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the New York Mets and 
the Houston Astros. He won the National League Cy Young Award in 1986. 
Scott is part of a select group of pitchers that have thrown a no-hitter 
and struck out 300 batters in the same season. Scott was drafted by the 
Mets in the 2nd round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft. He made 
his Major League debut with the Mets in 1979. The Mets traded Scott to 
the Astros for Danny Heep on December 11, 1982. By the end of the 1982 
season, Scott had compiled a 14-27 major league record and was happy to 
be traded away from the Mets because his results there were not good. He 
pitched poorly. Scott continued to struggle in his first two seasons with 
the Astros, going 15-17. The turning point in Scott's career came in 1985, 
when he became a student of legendary pitching coach Roger Craig. Craig 
taught Scott the split-finger fastball, a pitch he had made famous while 
coaching the pitchers of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers. 
Scott became an 18-game winner in 1985 and was rewarded with a new three-year 
deal with the Astros, valued at around two million dollars. Scott had his 
most successful season in 1986, when he posted an 18-10 record with a 2.22 
ERA, striking out a league-leading 306 batters.[1][2] In addition, on September 
25 of that season, he threw a 2-0 no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants 
at the Astrodome to clinch the National League West division title for 
the Astros. This game was voted one of the top-5 games played in the Astrodome 
after the Astros moved to Enron Field following the 1999 season.[3] He 
led a strong starting rotation consisting of pitchers Bob Knepper, Nolan 
Ryan, and Jim Deshaies. Scott's outstanding form continued into the postseason, 
when Houston faced the Eastern Division champion New York Mets in the 1986 
National League Championship Series. The Astros lost the series, 4 games 
to 2, but those two Astros' victories were courtesy of Scott's overwhelming 
starting pitching performances in Games 1 and 4, however there were rumors 
that Scott's dominating performance was the result of doctoring the baseball 
or cutting it or "scoffing" it. The New York Mets aggressively made their 
suspicions to the media in 1986. In fact, so dominating was Scott against 
the Mets' batting order in those two games that Game 6 was considered something 
of a "must win" for the Mets' pennant hopes; a Game 6 loss to the Astros 
would have meant that New York would again face an apparently unbeatable 
Mike Scott in a deciding Game 7 in the Astrodome. The Mets did win that 
Game 6 in sixteen innings—averting another Mike Scott appearance—to win 
the league pennant. In recognition of his regular season performance, Scott 
was awarded the 1986 National League Cy Young Award as the league's best 
pitcher. Additionally, Scott was voted the NL 1986 NLCS MVP, the first 
time in NLCS history that a member of the losing team was so honored (a 
year later, the San Francisco Giants' Jeffrey Leonard would become the 
second consecutive NLCS MVP of the losing team). In 1987, Scott was the 
National League starter in the All-Star Game, and threw two scoreless innings. 
He was also the opening day starter for the Astros. In 1988, Scott once 
more was named the Astros' opening day starter. On June 12, he was denied 
a second no-hitter when the Atlanta Braves' Ken Oberkfell singled to right 
with two outs in the ninth inning. In 1989, Scott won 20 games and finished 
second in NL Cy Young Award voting, behind reliever Mark Davis of the San 
Diego Padres. He was for the third consecutive time, the opening day starter 
for the Astros. Injuries began to plague him shortly thereafter. Scott 
retired after the 1991 season. As of the 2014 season, Mike is fourth all-time 
for the Astros in wins (110) and fifth in strikeouts (1318), and sixth 
in games started (259). "Astros Individual Records". 1992 his jersey #33
