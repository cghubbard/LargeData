William John (Bill) O'Neill (January 22, 1880 â€“ July 20, 1920) was an outfielder 
in Major League Baseball who played for the Boston Americans (1904), Washington 
Senators (1904) and Chicago White Sox (1906). O'Neill was a switch-hitter 
and threw right-handed. He was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. 
Playing at shortstop in his 1904 rookie season for the Red Sox, O'Neill 
committed six errors during a 13-inning 5-3 loss to the St Louis Browns 
on May 21 to become the only 20th century Major League player to record 
six errors in a game.[1] In the midseason he was traded to Washington in 
the same transaction that brought Kip Selbach to Boston. In 1906 O'Neill 
was a member of the Chicago White Sox team that won the World Championship 
over the Chicago Cubs in six games. In a two-season career, O'Neill was 
a .243 hitter with two home runs and 42 RBI in 206 games played. O'Neill
