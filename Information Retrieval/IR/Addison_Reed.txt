Addison Devon Reed (born December 27, 1988) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He pitched in MLB for the Chicago White Sox from 2011 through 2013 and 
for the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2014 through 2015. Reed attended Los 
Osos High School in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and San Diego State University.[1] 
Reed was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the third round of the 2010 
Major League Baseball draft.[2] He was named the relief pitcher on Baseball 
America's 2011 Minor League All Star team.[3] Reed was called up to the 
majors for the first time on September 2, 2011.[4] Reed picked up his first 
career save on May 5, 2012, against the Detroit Tigers pitching one-third 
of an inning striking out the only batter he faced, Austin Jackson, during 
a 3-2 White Sox victory. On May 23, 2012, manager Robin Ventura officially 
named Reed as the team's closer.[5] Reed finished the 2012 season with 
29 saves despite owning an ERA of 4.75 in 62 games. Reed played the 2013 
season as the team's closer. Reed earned his 50th career save in a game 
against the Kansas City Royals on June 22, 2013. On August 22, 2013, Reed 
saved a sixth consecutive game, becoming the first player in Chicago White 
Sox history to do so, and the first player in the Major Leagues since Éric 
Gagné did it for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2003.[6] Reed finished the 
year going 40-48 in save opportunities, going 5-4 with a 3.79 ERA, striking 
out 72 in 71.1 innings in 68 appearances. On December 16, 2013, the White 
Sox traded Reed to the Arizona Diamondbacks for infielder Matt Davidson.[7] 
Reed was named the new Diamondbacks closer for the 2014 season. He was 
removed from the closer role in May 2015,[8] and optioned to the Reno Aces 
in June after allowing 16 runs in 24 innings.[9] The Diamondbacks recalled 
Reed in July.[10] Reed finished the 2014 season with a record of 1-7, a 
4.25 ERA, 32 saves with a 1.21 WHIP in 59 1⁄3 innings pitched in 62 games.[citation

Mets for two minor league players.[11] Reed was the losing pitcher in the 
deciding Game 5 of the 2015 World Series. Reed finished the 2015 season 
with a record of 3-3, 3.38 ERA, 4 saves with 51 K's and a WHIP of 1.38 
in 56 innings pitched in 55 games with both the Diamondbacks and the Mets. 
Reed made the 2016 Opening Day Roster as the setup man for Jeurys Familia.[citation

as well as nabbing the Mets franchise record for the most holds in a season.
