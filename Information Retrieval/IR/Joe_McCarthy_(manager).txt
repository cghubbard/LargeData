Joseph Vincent McCarthy (April 21, 1887 – January 13, 1978) was a manager 
in Major League Baseball, most renowned for his leadership of the "Bronx 
Bombers" teams of the New York Yankees from 1931 to 1946. The first manager 
to win pennants with both National and American League teams, he won nine 
league titles overall and seven World Series championships – a record tied 
only by Casey Stengel. McCarthy was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 1957.[2] McCarthy's career winning percentages in both the regular season 
(.615)[2] and postseason (.698, all in the World Series)[2] are the highest 
in major league history. His 2,125[1] career victories rank eighth all-time 
in major league history for managerial wins, and he ranks first all-time 
for the Yankees with 1,460 wins.[3] Born in Philadelphia, where he grew 
up idolizing Athletics manager Connie Mack, McCarthy is among a handful 
of successful major league managers who never played in the majors. After 
attending Niagara University in 1905 and 1906 on a baseball scholarship, 
he spent the next 15 years in the minor leagues, primarily as a second 
baseman with the Toledo Mud Hens, Buffalo Bisons, and Louisville Colonels. 
In 1916 he signed with the Brooklyn Tip-Tops of the Federal League—then 
considered a third major league—but the league folded before he could play 
a game with them.[4] McCarthy briefly served as player-manager in Wilkes-Barre 
in 1913. He resumed his managing career with Louisville in 1919, leading 
the team to American Association pennants in 1921 and 1925 before being 
hired to manage the Chicago Cubs for the 1926 season.[1] He turned the 
club around, guiding them to the 1929 NL title, but was fired near the 
end of the 1930 season. He wasn't unemployed for long, however; the Yankees 
hired him in 1931.[1] With the Yankees, his strict but fair managing style 
helped to solidify the team's place as the dominant franchise in baseball, 
winning a World Series in 1932. His most successful period came from 1936 
to 1943. During that time, they won seven out of a possible eight pennants, 
all by nine games or more, and won six World Series—including four in a 
row from 1936 to 1939. They were the first American League team, and the 
third in major league history, to win four straight pennants, and the first 
to win more than two World Series in a row. The only time during this stretch 
that the Yankees' dominance was even threatened was in 1940, when they 
struggled all season and finished third. McCarthy struggled to control 
his emotions at the moving testimonial held for Lou Gehrig at Yankee Stadium 
on July 4, 1939. After describing Gehrig as "the finest example of a ballplayer, 
sportsman, and citizen that baseball has ever known", McCarthy could stand 
it no longer. Turning tearfully to Gehrig, he said, "Lou, what else can 
I say except that it was a sad day in the life of everybody who knew you 
when you [...] told me you were quitting as a ballplayer because you felt 
yourself a hindrance to the team. My God, man, you were never that."[5] 
McCarthy resigned in May 1946, partially due to conflict with new owner 
Larry MacPhail. McCarthy returned as manager of the Boston Red Sox from 
1948 to June 1950, but was unable to capture a pennant despite reaching 
a one-game playoff with the Cleveland Indians in 1948. Despite his teams' 
great performance, McCarthy was not without his detractors, who believed 
he was simply fortunate enough to be provided with great talent and was 
not a strong game tactician. During his peak period from 1936 to 1943, 
when the Yankees won seven pennants in eight seasons, White Sox manager 
Jimmy Dykes described McCarthy as a "push-button" manager. Yet McCarthy 
was an outstanding teacher and developer of talent, and was particularly 
adept at handling temperamental players such as Babe Ruth, who had hoped 
to become New York's manager and resented a team "outsider" being hired.[6] 
Ruth and McCarthy's relationship was lukewarm at best, and chilled considerably 
in 1934 when Ruth began openly campaigning to become manager. Partly due 
to this, Ruth was traded to the lowly Boston Braves after the season.[7] 
While managing, McCarthy utilized a low-key approach, never going to the 
mound to remove a pitcher or arguing with an umpire except on a point of 
the rules, preferring to stay at his seat in the center of the dugout. 
He also declined to wear a numbered uniform with the Yankees and Red Sox.[8][not 
in citation given] In order to draw attention to his presumed masterful 
leadership of the Yankees, McCarthy was given the nickname of "Marse Joe" 
by sportswriters. "Marse" is a Southern English rendition of the word "master".[9] 
McCarthy's success throughout his career was such that in 32 years of managing, 
his 1922 Louisville club was the only team which finished either with a 
losing record or below fourth place. McCarthy was named Major League Manager 
of the Year by The Sporting News in 1936 – the first year the award was 
given – and again in 1938 and 1943.[10] In a 1969 poll by the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America to commemorate the sport's professional 
centennial, McCarthy finished third in voting for the greatest manager 
in history, behind John McGraw and Casey Stengel. In a similar BBWAA poll 
in 1997 to select an All-Century team, he finished second behind Stengel.[11] 
On April 29, 1976, the Yankees dedicated a plaque for their Monument Park 
to McCarthy. The plaque calls him "One of baseball's most beloved and respected 
leaders."[12] In honor of his commitment to Buffalo, McCarthy became a 
charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.[13] McCarthy 
died of pneumonia at age 90 in Buffalo, New York,[14] and is buried in 
Mount Olivet Cemetery, (Roman Catholic) in Kenmore, New York.[15] McCarthy's
