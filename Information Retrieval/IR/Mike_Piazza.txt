Michael Joseph Piazza /piːˈɑːtsə/ (born September 4, 1968) is an Italian-American 
former professional baseball catcher who played 16 seasons in Major League 
Baseball (MLB), from 1992–2007. He played most notably for the New York 
Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers, while also having brief stints with the Florida 
Marlins, San Diego Padres, and Oakland Athletics. A 12-time All-Star and 
10-time Silver Slugger Award winner at catcher, Piazza produced strong 
offensive numbers at his position; in his career, he recorded 427 home 
runs—a record 396 of which were hit as catcher—along with a .308 batting 
average and 1,335 runs batted in (RBIs). Piazza was drafted by the Dodgers 
in the 1988 MLB draft as a favor from Tommy Lasorda to Piazza's father. 
Initially a first baseman, Piazza converted to catcher in the minor leagues 
at Lasorda's suggestion to improve his chances of being promoted. He made 
his major league debut in 1992 and the following year was named the National 
League (NL) Rookie of the Year and was an All-Star for the first of 10 
consecutive seasons. Piazza immediately impressed with his ability to hit 
for power and average. His best year as a Dodger came in 1997 when he batted 
.362, hit 40 home runs, and had 124 RBIs, leading to a runner-up finish 
in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1998, he was traded 
to the Marlins and then a week later to the Mets, with whom he spent most 
of the remainder of his career. He helped the Mets reach the 2000 World 
Series, the only World Series appearance of his career. After the 2005 
season, Piazza left the Mets to play one season each for the Padres and 
Athletics before retiring after the 2007 season. Piazza is regarded as 
one of the best offensive catchers in baseball history. He had at least 
one RBI in 15 consecutive games for the Mets in 2000, the second-longest 
RBI streak ever. In 2013, the Mets inducted Piazza into the New York Mets 
Hall of Fame. In 2016, Piazza was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame 
as a Met, receiving 83% of the vote.[1] Mike Piazza is owner of the Italian 
soccer team A.C. Reggiana 1919. Piazza was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, 
grew up in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, and attended Phoenixville High School. 
He is of Italian and Slovak ancestry, and is the second-oldest son of Vince 
and Veronica, with brothers Vince, Jr., Danny, Tony, and Tommy. Vince Piazza 
earned a fortune of more than $100 million in used cars and real estate, 
and attempted several times to purchase a MLB franchise.[2] When the Dodgers—managed 
by Vince Piazza's childhood friend Tommy Lasorda, the godfather of Mike 
Piazza's youngest brother, Tommy[3]—visited Philadelphia, Piazza visited 
the Dodger clubhouse and served as a bat boy in the dugout.[4] Vince Piazza's 
own hopes of playing baseball had ended at the age of 16 when he left school 
to support his family. He saw that Mike Piazza had potential in the sport, 
and began encouraging his son to build his arm strength at the age of five.[2] 
When he was 12, Piazza received personal instruction in his backyard batting 
cage from Ted Williams.[5] The Hall of Famer praised his talent, advised 
him not to let anyone change his swing, and autographed Piazza's copy of 
Williams' The Science of Hitting.[4] Vince Piazza threw hundreds of pitches 
nightly to his son,[2] who shared his father's focus on baseball, clearing 
snow if necessary to practice his hitting and, after reaching the major 
leagues, practicing on Christmas Eve.[4] He attended Phoenixville Area 
High School and graduated in 1986. After his father asked Lasorda to select 
Piazza as a favor,[6] the Miami-Dade Community College student was drafted 
by the Dodgers in the 62nd round of the 1988 MLB amateur draft as the 1,390th 
player picked overall.[7][4] Lasorda asked Piazza to give up his first 
base position and learn how to catch to improve his chances of reaching 
the major leagues, and helped him attend a special training camp for catchers 
in the Dominican Republic.[4] Although critics saw him as unfairly privileged 
due to his relationship with Lasorda, Piazza became an excellent hitter, 
especially for a catcher.[6] His MLB debut came with the Dodgers on September 
1, 1992, against the Chicago Cubs. He drew a walk in his first plate appearance 
and then doubled to deep center field in his first official at-bat, against 
Mike Harkey of the Cubs.[8] He hit his first home run on September 12, 
1992, against Steve Reed of the San Francisco Giants.[9] He only appeared 
in 21 games that season, hitting .232. He won the NL MLB Rookie of the 
Year Award in 1993 after appearing in 149 games, hitting .318, slugging 
35 home runs, and driving in 112 RBIs. He was also selected to the 1993 
Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first of 10 consecutive (and 12 
total) All-Star appearances. Until Joc Pederson passed him in 2015, Piazza's 
18 home runs before the All Star break was a Dodgers' rookie record.[10] 
In 1996, Piazza hit .336 with 36 home runs and 105 RBIs, finishing second 
in MVP voting, behind Ken Caminiti. Piazza's best season with the Dodgers 
was 1997, when he hit .362, with 40 home runs, 124 RBIs, an on-base percentage 
of .431, and a slugging percentage of .638. He finished second in voting 
MVP for the second consecutive season, behind Larry Walker. He played seven 
seasons for the Dodgers until he was traded to the Florida Marlins on May 
15, 1998. Piazza and Todd Zeile went to the Marlins in return for Gary 
Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Bobby Bonilla, Manuel Barrios, and Jim Eisenreich.[11] 
He only appeared in five games with the Marlins, where he hit .278. One 
week later, on May 22, Piazza was traded from the Marlins to the New York 
Mets for Preston Wilson, Ed Yarnall, and Geoff Goetz. Despite stellar numbers 
from Piazza, the Mets missed the 1998 postseason by one game. Piazza helped 
the Mets to two consecutive playoff appearances in 1999 and 2000. The latter 
of the two resulted in a NL pennant and a World Series appearance in the 
2000 Subway Series. Of note, all five games were decided by two runs or 
fewer, something that had not occurred in a World Series in almost 70 years. 
He became known as the Monster after coach John Stearns was caught on tape 
during the 2000 National League Championship Series after a Piazza hit 
saying "The Monster is out of the Cage".[11][12] Piazza was involved in 
a bizarre incident during the 2000 World Series. Earlier in the season 
during interleague play, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens hit Piazza in the 
head with a fastball. Piazza suffered a concussion and was forced to miss 
the 2000 MLB All-Star Game. Clemens was widely criticized by Mets fans 
for the incident, but Clemens maintained that the play was not intentional. 
Clemens and Piazza faced each other again in the first inning of World 
Series Game 2. During the at-bat, Clemens threw a pitch that broke Piazza's 
bat as he fouled it off, sending the barrel and a sharp edge of the broken 
bat directly at Clemens on the mound just as he finished his pitch. Clemens 
caught the barrel, and then almost immediately threw it with apparent frustration 
across the first base line towards the Yankees' dugout and just past Piazza 
who was running down to first. Piazza gave a long stare at Clemens and 
slowly started walking towards Clemens to confront him, and Clemens asked 
the umpire for a new ball as if nothing had happened. During replays, Clemens 
can be seen shouting "I thought it was the ball!" and asking the umpire 
for a new ball multiple times as the two benches cleared and met at the 
mound. Words were exchanged between the two players, but no punches were 
thrown from either team and nobody was ejected. Piazza later caught for 
Clemens when both were on the NL team in the 2004 All-Star Game. Clemens 
gave up six runs in the first inning.[13] To ease the stress on his deteriorating 
knees, Piazza began to split his time between catching and playing first 
base during the 2004 season, an experiment which was abandoned before the 
end of the season because of Piazza's defensive deficiencies.[citation 
needed] Although recognized as a great hitter, Piazza has had some notable 
defensive accomplishments. Among them, Piazza caught two no-hitters thrown 
by Ramón Martínez and Hideo Nomo while playing with the Dodgers. Nomo's 
was particularly impressive because it happened at Coors Field, notorious 
at the time for being a hitter-friendly ballpark. Additionally, Piazza's 
.997 fielding percentage was tops among NL catchers in 2000.[14] On May 
5, 2004, Piazza surpassed Carlton Fisk for most home runs by a catcher 
with his 352nd. On October 2, 2005, Piazza played his final game in a Mets 
uniform, as it was well-reported that the All-Star catcher and the team 
would part ways following the season, as Piazza's seven-year Mets contract 
expired. During the game against the Colorado Rockies, Mets manager Willie 
Randolph replaced Piazza after the eighth inning, when the Shea Stadium 
crowd of 47,718 serenaded him with a standing ovation, and Piazza humbly 
bowed to the stands and blew kisses to the adoring fans. The game was delayed 
for eight minutes while fans shouted and clapped rhythmically, with the 
ballpark's video screen displaying memories of Piazza's 972-game Mets career 
over nearly eight years in New York, as players from both the Mets and 
Rockies stood at the steps of their dugouts and clapped in appreciation 
of Piazza's legendary Mets tenure. Following the 2005 season, Piazza filed 
for free agency and he signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Padres 
on January 29, 2006. Prior to the start of the 2006 season, Piazza represented 
Italy in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Serving as the Padres' starting 
catcher and clean-up hitter, Piazza experienced somewhat of a rejuvenation 
in 2006, batting .283 with 22 homers and helping the Padres to a division 
title. On July 21, 2006, Mike Piazza collected his 2,000th career hit in 
the major leagues. On August 8, 2006, Piazza played his first game at Shea 
Stadium since leaving the Mets. During the three-game series, Piazza drew 
frequent, repeated standing ovations which were indicative of the high 
level of regard held by New York's fans. It was on par with that of Tom 
Seaver on his return to pitch at Shea Stadium in 1977 and 1978. Even more 
telling was during that series, on August 9, he drew a rare curtain call 
in the opposing park following a home run off Mets pitcher (and former 
Dodgers teammate) Pedro Martínez in the 4th inning. Not done for the day, 
Piazza went deep off Martinez again in the 6th. And with the Mets ahead 
4-2 in the 8th, and two runners aboard, Piazza hit one to the wall in center, 
nearly bashing his third homer of the day and putting the Padres ahead. 
Piazza signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics on December 8, 
2006. On July 25, 2007, in the top of the ninth inning in a game between 
the Angels and Athletics at Angel Stadium, a fan threw a water bottle that 
hit Piazza, who had homered earlier in the game. Piazza then pointed his 
bat in the stands at the fan he believed threw the water bottle to get 
the attention of security. The fan, who was identified as Roland Flores 
from La Puente, California, was arrested by the ballpark security. Piazza 
pressed charges against Flores.[15] Flores was sentenced to 30 days in 
jail and three years of probation on March 27, 2008. After not being signed 
to any MLB team for the 2008 season, Piazza announced his retirement on 
May 20, 2008, saying, "After discussing my options with my wife, family 
and agent, I felt it is time to start a new chapter in my life. It has 
been an amazing journey."[16] Piazza made a return to Shea Stadium during 
the "Shea Goodbye" closing ceremony on September 28, 2008, where he received 
the final pitch in the history of the stadium from Hall of Famer Tom Seaver. 
Piazza and Seaver were also afforded the immense honor of officially "closing" 
Shea when they walked off together into the center field exit and closed 
the door on the park after waving goodbye to the capacity crowd. On April 
13, 2009, Piazza received the first pitch in Citi Field history from Seaver 
before the Mets opening game against the Padres. Mets teammate Tom Glavine 
called Piazza a "first-ballot Hall of Famer, certainly the best hitting 
catcher of our era and arguably the best hitting catcher of all time".[6] 
On May 8, 2010, while receiving an award, Piazza said to reporters that 
if he got into the Hall of Fame, he would like to be inducted as a Met, 
for whom he played seven-plus seasons.[17] Piazza managed the USA team 
in the 2011 futures game wearing a Mets cap to the event.[18] On January 
9, 2013, Piazza failed to be elected to Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 
only 57.8% of the votes and falling short of the 75% qualifying votes. 
He stated that he would address the performance-enhancing drugs and steroid 
rumors in his book Long Shot.[19] In his second appearance on the ballot, 
Piazza's percentage numbers did rise (62.2%), but not to the 75% needed 
to be inducted. Piazza again failed to make the Hall of Fame in 2015, receiving 
69.9% of the votes needed (28 votes shy of the mark).[20] On January 6, 
2016, Piazza was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, receiving 83% of 
the vote.[1] Piazza was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame on 
September 29, 2013.[21] Piazza's autobiography, entitled Long Shot, was 
released in February 2014.[22] Piazza is known as among the best-hitting 
catchers of all time, hitting 427 career home runs and having an OPS of 
.922. Only nine other players have ever had over 400 home runs with over 
a .300 lifetime average while never striking out more than 100 times in 
a season (Ted Williams, Stan Musial, Lou Gehrig, Mel Ott, Hank Aaron, Babe 
Ruth, Vladimir Guerrero, Albert Pujols, and Chipper Jones). In addition 
to his hitting, Piazza's defense has undergone a more positive reassessment 
in light of new defensive metrics. His pitch framing, in particular, ranks 
seventh-best among all catchers going back to the first data in 1988.[23] 
Another report published in 2008 put him third among all catchers since 
1948 in improving the performances of his pitchers.[24] The New York Mets 
retired his uniform number, 31, in a ceremony on July 30, 2016[25] prior 
to the Mets' game against the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field. Piazza has 
appeared in the movie Two Weeks Notice and has acted in various TV shows 
and commercials.[26] On May 3, 2013, Piazza debuted with the Miami City 
Ballet, saying a few lines in the role of a hit man in the troupe's production 
of Slaughter on Tenth Avenue. Piazza wants to increase the reputation of 
ballet among sports fans as a result of his daughters' attendance at a 
ballet school.[26][27] On January 29, 2005, Piazza married Playboy Playmate 
Alicia Rickter at St. Jude's Catholic Church in Miami, Florida, before 
120 guests, including Brande Roderick, Lisa Dergan, Anjelica Bridges, Al 
Leiter, John Franco, Iván Rodríguez, Eddie Trunk, and his best friend Eric 
Karros. On February 3, 2007, Piazza's wife gave birth to the couple's first 
child. He is known to be a fan of heavy metal music, and is featured on 
the CD Stronger Than Death by Black Label Society. He is also godfather 
to Zakk Wylde's son, Hendrix. He often cohosts Eddie Trunk's Friday Night 
Rocks show on WAXQ ("Q-104.3 FM") in New York City and was featured as 
the primary guest on an episode of That Metal Show. Despite his mother 
being brought up in the Jewish faith, Piazza is a devout Roman Catholic, 
and was featured in Champions of Faith, a DVD documentary exploring the 
intersection of Catholic religious faith and sports. He also appeared in 
the follow-up video Champions of Faith: Bases of Life. Piazza is also avidly 
involved in the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in Chicago. 
While playing with the Mets, Piazza was a resident of Cresskill, New Jersey.[28] 
He was represented his entire career by sports agent Dan Lozano and in 
his retirement, his marketing is being handled by Octagon (Sports Agency).[29]
