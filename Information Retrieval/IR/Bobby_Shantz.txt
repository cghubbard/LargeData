Robert Clayton Shantz (born September 26, 1925) is a former Major League 
Baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Athletics (1949–1954), Kansas City 
Athletics (1955–1956), New York Yankees (1957–1960), Pittsburgh Pirates 
(1961), Houston Colt .45's (1962), St. Louis Cardinals (1962–1964), Chicago 
Cubs (1964), and the Philadelphia Phillies (1964).[1] A left-hander, Shantz 
began his career as a starting pitcher, but about halfway through he converted 
to a competent relief pitcher. In 1951 he added the knuckleball to his 
repertoire. Standing only 5 ft 6 in (1.68 m), Shantz had a career record 
of 119 games won, 99 games lost, and an earned run average of 3.38. Shantz 
enjoyed his best season in 1952 when he led the American League in wins 
(24) and won the MVP Award.[1] In the process, he led the A's to a fourth-place 
finish. This was their last winning season in Philadelphia. The 1952 A's 
had some good players, including batting champion Ferris Fain, shortstop 
Eddie Joost, home run hitter Gus Zernial, and fleet center fielder Dave 
Philley. In a September 1952 game, Shantz's left wrist was broken after 
it was hit by a pitch thrown by Walt Masterson.[2] The following season, 
Shantz injured his shoulder in a game against the Boston Red Sox.[3] Shantz 
saw only limited action for the rest of 1953 and pitched only eight innings 
in 1954.[4] After the 1954 season was complete, the Athletics were sold 
and moved to Kansas City for the 1955 season. A highly skilled fielder, 
Shantz won eight consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1957 to 1964 (American 
League, 1957–60; National League, 1961–64; in 1957 the award was rendered 
for both leagues). Shantz also was selected for the All-Star Game in 1951, 
1952 and 1957.[1] In the fifth and final inning of the 1952 All Star Game, 
the left–handed Shantz exhibited his distinctive sidearm delivery and sharp 
curve and control and struck out three consecutive National League hitters: 
Whitey Lockman, Jackie Robinson and Stan Musial. Shantz appeared in relief 
three games each in the 1957 and 1960 World Series with the Casey Stengel 
managed New York Yankees.[1] Shantz had the distinction of being selected 
in expansion drafts in consecutive seasons. He was selected in the 1960 
MLB expansion draft by the Washington Senators from the New York Yankees, 
and in the 1961 MLB expansion draft by the Colt .45s from the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. He is the brother of former Major League catcher Billy Shantz.
