draft. Dye made his Major League debut with the Braves, hitting a home 
run in his first Major League at-bat. He was traded to the Royals during 
the 1997 offseason in a package that brought Michael Tucker and Keith Lockhart 
to Atlanta. He was traded to Kansas City on March 27, 1997. In 1999 Dye 
played in 158 games for the Royals, hitting 26 home runs. He was one of 
the more well-liked Royals at that time, with fans frequently chanting 
"Dye-no-mite" after he came up to bat. The next year he made the American 
League All-Star team. In 2001 Dye was traded to Oakland as part of a three-way 
deal in which the Royals received Neifi Pérez. Jermaine wore jersey number

he fouled a ball off of his left knee.[5] Prior to the 2005 season, Dye 
was signed by the Chicago White Sox to a two-year, $10.15 million free-agent 
contract with an option for 2007.[1] He played 145 games in 2005, the most 
since his injury, including an appearance at first base and shortstop. 
He batted .274 with 31 home runs, slugged .512 and stole 11 bases in regular 
season play, and was named World Series MVP, batting .438 with one home 
run and three RBIs. His RBI single off Houston Astros closer Brad Lidge 
provided the deciding run in Chicago's 1-0 Game 4 victory, clinching the 
Series sweep 2006 proved to be his best offensive season; he finished second 
in the league with 44 home runs, third in slugging at .622, fifth in runs 
batted in with 120, batted .315, and placed fifth in AL Most Valuable Player 
voting.[6] On Mother's Day, May 14, Dye was one of more than 50 hitters

his career after a scorching first half in which he batted .318, struck 
25 home runs and slugged .646. Dye was awarded a Silver Slugger for his 
offensive performance. On October 30, 2006, the White Sox exercised their 
$6.75 million option for Dye's 2007 season.[7] Dye, along with many other 
Chicago hitters, struggled in the first half of 2007, including a cold 
June in which he batted just .203 with one home run. He turned his game 
around in the second half, batting .298 and knocking out 20 doubles and 
16 home runs, and finished with a batting line of .254/.317/.486. He was 
signed to a two-year contract extension in August. He returned to form 
in 2008 for the division champion White Sox, finishing second in the American 
League with 77 extra-base hits and batting .292 with 34 home runs overall. 
Dye finished second to Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria in Final Vote balloting 
for the last spot on the American League All-Star roster. On November 6, 
2009, Dye's $12 million mutual option was bought out for $950,000, making 
him a free agent.[8] On March 31, 2011, Dye announced his retirement.[4][9]
