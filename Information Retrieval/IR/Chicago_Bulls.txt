The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in 
Chicago. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) 
as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The 
team was founded on January 16, 1966. The team plays its home games at 
the United Center, an arena shared with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National 
Hockey League (NHL). The Bulls saw their greatest success during the 1990s. 
They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning 
six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. All six 
championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and coach Phil Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple 
championships and never lose an NBA Finals series in their history. The 
Bulls won 72 games during the 1995–96 NBA season, setting an NBA record 
that stood until the Golden State Warriors won 73 games during the 2015–16 
NBA season. The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 games 
or more in a single season, and the only NBA franchise to do so until the 
2015–16 Warriors.[3][4][5] Many experts and analysts consider the 1996 
Bulls to be one of the greatest teams in NBA history. As of 2016, the Bulls 
are the third most valuable NBA franchise according to Forbes, with an 
estimated value of $2.3 billion, earning approximately $67.6 million in 
operating income from the 2015–16 NBA season.[6] Michael Jordan and Derrick 
Rose have both won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award while playing for 
the Bulls, for a total of six MVP awards. The Bulls share rivalries with 
the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Miami Heat, and Cleveland Cavaliers. 
The Bulls-Pistons rivalry was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s 
and early 1990s. On January 16, 1966 Chicago was granted an NBA franchise 
to be called the Bulls. The Chicago Bulls became the third NBA franchise 
in the city, after the Chicago Stags (1946–1950) and the Chicago Packers/Zephyrs 
(now the Washington Wizards). The Bulls' founder, Dick Klein, was the Bulls' 
only owner to ever play professional basketball (for the Chicago American 
Gears). He served as the Bulls' president and general manager in their 
initial years. After the 1966 NBA Expansion Draft, the newly founded Chicago 
Bulls were allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams 
in the league for the upcoming 1966–67 season. The team started in the 
1966–67 NBA season, and posted the best record by an expansion team in 
NBA history. Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star Johnny "Red" Kerr, 
and led by former NBA assist leader Guy Rodgers, guard Jerry Sloan and 
forward Bob Boozer, the Bulls qualified for the playoffs, the only NBA 
team to do so in their inaugural season. In their first two seasons, the 
Bulls played most of their home games at the International Amphitheatre, 
before moving to Chicago Stadium. Fan interest was diminishing after four 
seasons, with one game in the 1967–68 NBA season having an official attendance 
of 891 and some games being played in Kansas City. In 1969, Klein dropped 
out of the general manager job and invited Pat Williams, who as the Philadelphia 
76ers' business manager created promotions that helped the team become 
third in attendance the previous season. Williams revamped the team roster, 
acquiring Chet Walker from his old team in exchange for Jim Washington 
and drafting Norm Van Lier – who was traded to the Cincinnati Royals and 
only joined the Bulls in 1971 – while also investing in promotion, with 
actions such as creating mascot Benny the Bull. The Bulls under Williams 
and head coach Dick Motta qualified for four straight playoffs and had 
attendances grow to over 10,000.[7] In 1972, the Bulls set a franchise 
win-loss record at 57 wins and 25 losses. During the 1970s, the Bulls relied 
on Jerry Sloan, forwards Bob Love and Chet Walker, point guard Norm Van 
Lier, and centers Clifford Ray and Tom Boerwinkle. The team made the conference 
finals in 1975 but lost to the Golden State Warriors, 4 games to 3. After 
four 50-win seasons, Williams returned to Philadelphia, and Motta decided 
to become GM as well. The Bulls ended up declining, winning only 24 games 
in the 1975–1976 season. Motta was fired and replaced by Ed Badger.[7] 
Artis Gilmore, acquired in the ABA dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls 
squad which included guard Reggie Theus, forward David Greenwood and forward 
Orlando Woolridge. In 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to 
select first in the NBA draft (Rod Thorn, the Bulls' General Manager, called 
"heads"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected Magic Johnson; 
instead, they selected David Greenwood with the second pick. The Los Angeles 
Lakers selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the New Orleans Jazz, 
who traded the selection for Gail Goodrich. After Gilmore was traded to 
the San Antonio Spurs for center Dave Corzine, the Bulls employed a high-powered 
offense centered around Theus, and which soon included guards Quintin Dailey 
and Ennis Whatley. However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided 
to change direction, trading Theus to the Kansas City Kings during the 
1983–84 season. In the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of 
the 1984 NBA draft, after Houston and Portland. The Rockets selected Hakeem 
Olajuwon, the Blazers picked Sam Bowie and the Bulls chose shooting guard 
Michael Jordan. The team, with new management in owner Jerry Reinsdorf] 
and general manager Jerry Krause, decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan 
set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in 
the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to the playoffs, 
where they lost in four games to the Milwaukee Bucks. For his efforts, 
he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA 
Rookie of the Year Award. In the following off-season, the team acquired 
point guard John Paxson and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for 
the rights to power forward Charles Oakley. Along with Jordan and center 
Dave Corzine, they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two 
years. After suffering a broken foot early in the 1985–86 season, Jordan 
finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for 
the playoffs, and took the eighth-place Bulls against the 67–15 Boston 
Celtics, led by Larry Bird. At the time, the Bulls had the fifth worst 
record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[8] Though 
the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points 
in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 
'God disguised as Michael Jordan.' In the 1986–87 NBA season, Jordan continued 
his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 
points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First 
Team. The Bulls finished 40–42, which was good enough to qualify them for 
the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs. 
In the 1987 draft, to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center 
Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, 
then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, 
small forward Scottie Pippen. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, 
Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, 
and rookies Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games 
and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten 
by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games. 
For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player, an award he 
would win four more times over his career. The 1987–88 season would also 
mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 
to 1991. The 1988–89 season marked a second straight year of major off-season 
moves. Power forward Charles Oakley, who had led the league in total rebounds 
in both '87 and '88, was traded on the eve of the 1988 NBA draft to the 
New York Knicks along with a first round draft pick used by the Knicks 
to select Rod Strickland for center Bill Cartwright and a first round pick, 
which the Bulls used to obtain center Will Perdue. In addition, the Bulls 
acquired three-point shooter Craig Hodges from Phoenix. The new starting 
lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time 
to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all 
the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six 
games by the NBA champion Pistons. In 1989–90, Jordan led the league in 
scoring for the fourth straight season, and was joined on the all-star 
squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during 
the off-season, where head coach Doug Collins was replaced by assistant 
coach Phil Jackson. The Bulls also picked up rookie center Stacey King 
and rookie point guard B.J. Armstrong in the 1989 draft. With these additional 
players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it 
to the Conference Finals, and pushed the Pistons to seven games before 
being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat 
as NBA champions. In the 1990–91 season, the Bulls recorded a then-franchise 
record 61 wins, and romped through the playoffs, where they swept the Knicks 
in the first round, defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the semifinals, 
then eliminated defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals and 
won the NBA Finals in five games over the Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles 
Lakers. The Bulls won their second straight title in 1992 after racking 
up another franchise record for wins with 67. They defeated the Miami Heat 
in three games in the first round, the Knicks in seven hard-fought games 
in the second round, then the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the Eastern 
Conference to the Finals for the second year in a row where they defeated 
the Clyde Drexler-led Portland Trail Blazers in six games. In 1993, the 
Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the Atlanta 
Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks in the first three rounds 
and then defeating regular season MVP Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns, 
with John Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99–98 
victory in Game 6 in Phoenix, Arizona. On October 6, 1993, Michael Jordan 
shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months 
after his father's murder. The Bulls were then led by Scottie Pippen, who 
established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning 
the 1994 All-Star MVP. He received help from Horace Grant and B.J. Armstrong, 
who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by 
Cartwright, Perdue, shooting guard Pete Myers, and Croatian rookie forward 
Toni Kukoč. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the 1993–94 season, 
they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of the 
playoffs, after a controversial foul call by referee Hue Hollins in game 
5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the finals that year, but 
lost to the Houston Rockets. The Bulls opened the 1994–95 season by leaving 
their home of 27 years, Chicago Stadium, and moving into their current 
home, the United Center. In 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and 
Scott Williams to free agency, and John Paxson to retirement, but picked 
up shooting guard Ron Harper, the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant 
coach Tex Winter's triple-post offense, and small-forward Jud Buechler. 
The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kukoc 
at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter 
Steve Kerr, whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993–94 season, 
Myers, and centers Luc Longley (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota 
Timberwolves) and Bill Wennington. However, they were struggling during 
the season, on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan 
was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in 
only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in the playoffs, 
where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls 
were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando 
Magic, which included Horace Grant, Anfernee Hardaway, and Shaquille O'Neal. 
When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45 (which was 
his number while playing for the Birmingham Barons, a minor-league affiliate 
of the Chicago White Sox). He chose the No. 45 because his older brother 
Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to be half as good 
as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, 
Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic 
series. In the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, 
and Krause traded Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for rebounding specialist 
Dennis Rodman, who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had 
also been a member of the Detroit Pistons' "Bad Boys" squad that served 
as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s. With a lineup of Harper, 
Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench 
in Steve Kerr, Kukoc, Wennington, Buechler, and guard Randy Brown, the 
Bulls posted one of the best single-season improvements in league history 
and the best single-season record at that time, moving from 47–35 to 72–10, 
becoming the first NBA team to win 70 or more games.[9] Jordan won his 
eighth scoring title, and Rodman his fifth straight rebounding title, while 
Kerr finished second in the league in three-point shooting percentage. 
Jordan garnered the elusive triple crown with the NBA MVP, NBA All-Star 
Game MVP, and NBA Finals MVP. Krause was named NBA Executive of the Year, 
Jackson Coach of the Year, and Kukoc the Sixth Man of the Year. Both Pippen 
and Jordan made the All-NBA First Team, and Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman 
made the All-Defensive First Team, making the Bulls the only team in NBA 
history with three players on the All-Defensive First Team.[10] In addition, 
the 1995–96 team holds several other records, including the best road record 
in a standard 41-road-game season (33–8), the all-time best start by a 
team (41–3), and the best start at home (37–0). The Bulls also posted the 
second-best home record in history (39–2), behind only the 1985–86 Celtics 
40–1 home mark. The team triumphed over the Miami Heat in the first round, 
the New York Knicks in the second round, the Orlando Magic in the Eastern 
Conference Finals and finally Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp and the Seattle SuperSonics 
for their fourth title. The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls are widely regarded as 
one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball.[11] In the 1996–97 
season, the Bulls narrowly missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season 
by losing their final two games to finish 69–13. They repeated their home 
dominance, going 39–2 at the United Center.[12] The Bulls capped the season 
by defeating the Bullets, Hawks and Heat in the first three rounds of the 
playoffs en rote to winning their fifth NBA championship over John Stockton, 
Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz. Jordan earned his second straight and ninth 
career scoring title, while Rodman earned his sixth straight rebounding 
title. Jordan and Pippen, along with Robert Parish, who was a member of 
the Bulls at the time, were also honored as members of the 50 greatest 
players of all-time with the NBA celebrating its 50th season.[13] Parish, 
whose single season with the Bulls would be his last year in the league, 
was nominated for his stellar career with the Boston Celtics.[14] The 1997–98 
season was one of turmoil for the NBA champion Bulls.[15] Many speculated 
this would be Michael Jordan's final season with the team.[15] Phil Jackson's 
future with the team was also questionable, as his relationship with team 
general manager Jerry Krause was one of growing tension. Scottie Pippen 
was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, 
but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that 
surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final 
regular-season record of 62–20. Michael Jordan would be named the league 
MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs 
as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference. The first round of the 
playoffs for the Bulls was against the New Jersey Nets, a team led by Keith 
Van Horn, Kendall Gill and Sam Cassell. The Bulls swept the Nets three 
to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more 
challenging with the Charlotte Hornets stealing game two from the Bulls 
at the United Center, and tying the series 1–1. But the Bulls easily defeated 
the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals 
was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the Reggie Miller-led 
Indiana Pacers. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best 
chance to defeat the Bulls.[15] The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, 
winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven 
at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88–83, winning 
their 6th Eastern Conference Championship. In a much anticipated Finals, 
The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the Utah Jazz. Led 
by Karl Malone and John Stockton, the Jazz felt confident that they could 
defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's Delta Center. Facing a potential 
two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied 
the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the 
next two games, took a 3–1 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 
83–81. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams, as the Jazz had a lead 
late in the game. Down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led 
the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 
1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit the game winning shot with 
5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87–86, John Stockton 
put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship 
in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time 
in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. The 
summer of 1998 brought an abrupt end to the championship era.[16] Krause 
felt that the Bulls were on the verge of being too old and unable to compete. 
He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow 
decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft 
picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising 
free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous 
attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf, Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy 
Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round 
draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis 
Rodman, and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He 
hired a new coach, Tim Floyd, who had run a successful program at Iowa 
State University. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his 
second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy 
Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper, newcomer Brent Barry at small forward, 
power forward Toni Kukoč, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the 
lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, 
and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of 
the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, 
the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in 
a game in the shot clock era. The previous year's dismal finish came with 
one highlight: the team won the draft lottery and the rights to power forward 
Elton Brand. Since the team lost Harper, Wennington and Barry in the offseason, 
Brand and fellow rookie Ron Artest led the team throughout the year, especially 
after Kukoc missed most of the season due to injury and was then dealt 
for a draft pick at the trading deadline. Brand recorded the first 20–10 
average for the Bulls since the days of Artis Gilmore. He led all rookies 
in scoring, rebounds, blocks, field goal percentage and minutes, while 
Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring. 
For his efforts Brand was named 1999–2000 co-Rookie of the Year with Houston's 
Steve Francis, and to the all-rookie first team, while Artest was named 
to the all-rookie second team. However, the team established a franchise 
low at 17–65, second worst in the league. After a summer in which the Bulls 
witnessed most major and minor free agents Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy 
McGrady, Eddie Jones and even Tim Thomas choose to stay with their teams 
(or go elsewhere) rather than sign with them, Krause signed free agent 
center Brad Miller and shooting guard Ron Mercer, and drafted power forward 
Marcus Fizer and traded draft pick Chris Mihm to Cleveland for the rights 
of guard Jamal Crawford. Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds 
with another 20–10 season, but the new acquisitions failed to make a major 
impact, and they finished with the worst record in team history and the 
league's worst for the season at 15–67. Krause shocked Bulls fans on draft 
day in 2001 when he traded franchise player Brand to the Los Angeles Clippers 
for the second pick in the draft, Tyson Chandler. He also selected Eddy 
Curry with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry came straight 
out of high school, neither was expected to make much of a contribution 
for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The 
team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded 
their top three scorers—Mercer, Artest, and Miller along with Kevin Ollie—to 
the Indiana Pacers for veteran guard Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Norman 
Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed 
in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, 
following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls 
improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in 
the league. For the 2002–03 season, the Bulls came to play with much optimism. 
They picked up college phenom Jay Williams with the second pick in the 
draft. Williams teamed with Jalen Rose, Crawford, Fizer, newcomer Donyell 
Marshall, Curry, Chandler, and guard Trenton Hassell to form a young and 
exciting nucleus which improved to 30–52 in Bill Cartwright's first full 
season as head coach. Curry led the league in field goal percentage, becoming 
the first Bull since Jordan to lead the league in a major statistical category. 
During the summer of 2003, long-time GM Jerry Krause retired, and former 
player and color commentator John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay 
Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured 
in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 
2004 and he has yet to return to the game. Paxson selected point guard 
Kirk Hinrich with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free 
agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, 
Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson in the front office, the Bulls 
hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return. However, 
the 2003–04 season was a resounding disappointment. Eddy Curry regressed, 
leading to questions about his conditioning and commitment. Tyson Chandler 
was plagued by a chronic back injury, missing more than thirty games. Pippen's 
ability to influence games was impaired by knee problems, and he openly 
contemplated retirement. Jamal Crawford remained inconsistent. Bill Cartwright 
was fired as head coach in December and replaced with former Phoenix coach 
Scott Skiles. A trade with the Toronto Raptors brought Antonio Davis and 
Jerome Williams in exchange for Rose and Marshall in what was seen as a 
major shift in team strategy from winning with athleticism to winning with 
hard work and defense. After struggling throughout the season, the Bulls 
finished with 23 wins and 59 losses, the second-worst record in the league. 
Fizer was not re-signed, and Crawford was re-signed and traded to the Knicks 
for expiring contracts. Hinrich provided the lone bright spot, becoming 
a fan favorite for his gritty determination and tenacious defense. He won 
a place on the All-Rookie first team. During the 2004 off-season, Paxson 
traded a 2005 draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in return for an additional 
pick in the 2004 NBA draft. He used the picks to select Connecticut guard 
Ben Gordon and Duke small forward Luol Deng in the first round, and Duke 
point guard Chris Duhon in the second. Paxson also signed free agent small 
forward Andrés Nocioni, who had recently won an Olympic gold medal as a 
member of the Argentine national team. After losing the first nine games 
of the season, the Bulls began to show signs of improvement behind their 
improved team defense and clutch fourth-quarter play from Gordon. The Bulls, 
who were 0–9 to start the season, finished the regular season 47–35, with 
the third-best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the NBA 
playoffs for the first time since Jordan's departure. In the first round, 
the 4th-seeded Bulls played the Washington Wizards. Despite an injury to 
Deng and a heart issue with Curry, The Bulls opened the series with two 
wins at home, but lost the next four games and the series. After the season, 
Ben Gordon became the first rookie to win the NBA Sixth Man Award and the 
first Bull to win the award since 1996 with Toni Kukoč. During the 2005 
off-season, the Bulls re-signed free agent Tyson Chandler. However, Curry 
showed possible symptoms of a heart disease resulting of a heart murmur 
during checkups, and Paxson would not clear him to play without extensive 
DNA testing. Ultimately, Curry refused to participate in the tests, and 
he was traded along with Antonio Davis to the New York Knicks for Michael 
Sweetney, Tim Thomas, and what became the second pick of the 2006 NBA draft—as 
well as the right to swap picks with New York in the 2007 NBA draft. Without 
a significant post presence, the Bulls struggled for most of the 2005–06 
season. However, a late-season 12–2 surge allowed them to finish 41–41 
and qualify for the 2006 playoffs as the seventh seed. There, the Bulls 
faced the Miami Heat. After two close losses in Miami, the Bulls broke 
through with a blowout win in Game 3, and another win in Game 4. However, 
the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that 
year's championship. The Bulls' several young players nevertheless earned 
additional postseason experience, and Nocioni turned in a remarkable series 
of performances that far exceeded his season averages. In the 2006 NBA 
Draft, the Bulls were awarded forward-center LaMarcus Aldridge and immediately 
traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers for forward Tyrus Thomas and forward 
Viktor Khryapa. In a second draft-day trade, the Bulls selected Rodney 
Carney and traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for guard Thabo Sefolosha. 
Later that summer, four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace signed 
with the Bulls for a reported four-year, $60 million contract. Following 
the signing of Wallace, the Bulls traded Tyson Chandler, the last remaining 
player of the Krause era, to the (then) New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets 
for veteran power forward P.J. Brown and J. R. Smith and salary cap space 
that was used to sign former Chicago co-captain Adrian Griffin. In 2006–07, 
the Bulls overcame a 3–9 season start to finish 49–33, the third-best record 
in the Eastern Conference. In the first round, the Bulls again faced Miami, 
the defending NBA champions. The Bulls narrowly won Game 1 at home, then 
followed it with a blowout victory in Game 2. In Miami, the Bulls rallied 
from a 12-point second-half deficit to win Game 3 and then posted another 
comeback win in Game 4. The Bulls' four-game sweep of the defending champions 
stunned many NBA observers. It was Chicago's first playoff series victory 
since 1998, Jordan's last season with the team. The Bulls then advanced 
to face the Detroit Pistons, marking the first time the Central Division 
rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three 
games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had ever come back 
from a 0–3 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by 
winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, 
and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 
10, and the Pistons won the series 4–2 on May 17. During the off season, 
the Bulls signed forward Joe Smith and guard Adrian Griffin, and drafted 
center Joakim Noah. However, distractions began when Luol Deng and Ben 
Gordon turned down contract extensions, never citing reasons. Then rumors 
surfaced that the Bulls were pursuing stars like Kevin Garnett, Pau Gasol, 
and most notably, Kobe Bryant. None of these deals happened, and general 
manager John Paxson denied a deal was ever imminent. The Bulls started 
the 2007–08 NBA season by losing 10 of their first 12 games and on December 
24, 2007, after a 9–16 start, the Bulls fired head coach Scott Skiles. 
Jim Boylan was named the interim head coach on December 27, 2007. On February 
21, 2008, Ben Wallace, Joe Smith, Adrian Griffin and the Bulls' 2009 2nd 
round draft pick[17] were exchanged for Drew Gooden, Cedric Simmons, Larry 
Hughes and Shannon Brown in a three-team trade deal involving the Cleveland 
Cavaliers and the Seattle SuperSonics.[18] Boylan was not retained on April 
17 at the conclusion of the 2007–08 season after compiling a 24–32 record 
with the Bulls. The Bulls ended the 2007–08 campaign with a 33–49 record, 
a complete reversal of last year's record. After Jim Boylan's interim tenure 
expired, the Bulls began the process of selecting a new head coach. They 
were in talks with former Phoenix head coach Mike D'Antoni, but on May 
10, 2008, he signed with the New York Knicks. Other possible options included 
former Dallas head coach Avery Johnson and former Bulls head coach Doug 
Collins. Collins resigned from the coaching list on June 4, 2008, reporting 
that he did not want to ruin his friendship with Jerry Reinsdorf. On June 
10, 2008, the Chicago Bulls G.M. John Paxson hired Vinny Del Negro, with 
no coaching experience, to coach the young Bulls. On July 3, 2008, the 
Chicago Tribune reported that Del Harris agreed to become an assistant 
coach for the Chicago Bulls along with former Charlotte Bobcats head coach 
Bernie Bickerstaff and longtime NBA assistant Bob Ociepka. Along with Bickerstaff 
and Ociepka, Harris helped establish a veteran presence on the coaching 
staff and helped rookie head coach Del Negro. With a slim 1.7% chance of 
winning the rights to draft number 1, the Bulls won the 2008 NBA Draft 
Lottery and selected first overall. With this, the Bulls became the team 
with the lowest chance of winning to ever win the lottery since it was 
modified for the 1994 NBA draft, and second lowest ever. On June 26, 2008, 
the Bulls drafted Chicago native Derrick Rose from the University of Memphis 
as the number 1 draft pick. At pick number 39 they selected Sonny Weems. 
The Bulls later traded Weems to the Denver Nuggets for Denver's 2009 regular 
second-round draft pick. The Bulls then acquired Ömer Aşık from the Portland 
Trail Blazers (selected with the 36th pick) for Denver's 2009 regular second-round 
draft pick, New York's 2009 regular second-round draft pick, and the Bulls' 
2010 regular second-round draft pick. The Bulls re-signed Luol Deng to 
a six-year $71 million contract on July 30, 2008. He was later plagued 
with an injury keeping him from action for most of the 2008–2009 season. 
Ben Gordon signed a one-year contract on October 2, 2008. On February 18, 
2009, the Bulls made their first of several trades, sending Andrés Nocioni, 
Drew Gooden, Cedric Simmons,and Michael Ruffin to the Sacramento Kings 
for Brad Miller and John Salmons.[19] Then on February 19, 2009, the NBA 
trade deadline, the Bulls traded Larry Hughes to the New York Knicks for 
Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson.[20] Later that day the 
Bulls made the third trade in a span of less than 24 hours by sending swingman 
Thabo Sefolosha to the Oklahoma City Thunder for a 2009 first-round pick.[21] 
The trades brought a late-season push for the Bulls, which finally clinched 
a playoff berth on April 10, 2009, their fourth in the last five years. 
They finished the season with a 41–41 record. Their record was good enough 
to secure a No. 7 seed in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, playing a tough series 
against the Boston Celtics. In Game 1, Derrick Rose scored 36 points, along 
with 11 assists, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for most points scored 
by a rookie in a playoff debut. After breaking the record for most overtimes 
played in an NBA Playoffs Series, the Boston Celtics managed to overcome 
the Bulls after 7 games and 7 overtimes played.[22] The Bulls had two first 
round picks in the 2009 NBA draft and decided to take Wake Forest stand 
out forward James Johnson and athletic USC forward Taj Gibson.[23] In the 
2009 NBA off-season the Bulls lost their leading scorer, Ben Gordon, when 
he signed with their divisional rival, the Detroit Pistons. On February 
18, 2010, John Salmons was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Joe Alexander 
and Hakim Warrick. Meanwhile, Tyrus Thomas was traded to the Charlotte 
Bobcats for Acie Law, Flip Murray and a future protected first round pick. 
On April 14, 2010, the Bulls clinched the playoffs with the number 8 seed. 
Unlike the previous year, however, the Bulls' playoff run was shorter and 
less dramatic as they were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in five 
games. On May 4, 2010, the Bulls officially fired head coach Vinny Del 
Negro.[24] In early June 2010, Boston Celtics assistant Tom Thibodeau accepted 
a three-year contract to fill the Bulls' head coaching vacancy.[25] He 
was officially introduced on June 23.[26] On July 7, it was revealed that 
Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz had verbally agreed to an $80 million, five-year 
contract. Afterwards, the Bulls traded veteran point guard Kirk Hinrich 
to the Washington Wizards to create more cap space. The Bulls also signed 
former 76er and Jazz sharpshooter Kyle Korver to a three-year, $15 million 
contract. The same day that the Bulls signed Kyle Korver, they signed Turkish 
All-Star Ömer Aşık. After being matched by the Orlando Magic for J. J. 
Redick, they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season 
in shooting guard Ronnie Brewer, traded for former Warrior point guard 
C.J. Watson, and signed former Bucks power forward Kurt Thomas as well 
as former Spurs player Keith Bogans and former Celtic Brian Scalabrine. 
Rose earned the 2011 NBA MVP Award, thereby becoming the youngest player 
in NBA history to win it. He became the first Bulls player since Michael 
Jordan to win the award. As a team, Chicago finished the regular season 
with a league-best 62–20 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern 
Conference for the first time since 1998. The Bulls defeated the Indiana 
Pacers and the Atlanta Hawks in five and six games, respectively, thereby 
reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1998, and 
faced the Miami Heat. After winning the first game of the series, they 
lost the next four games, ending their season. During the off-season, the 
Bulls drafted Jimmy Butler 30th overall in the 2011 NBA draft. After the 
NBA lockout ended, the Bulls lost Kurt Thomas to free agency, and released 
Keith Bogans. The Bulls signed veteran shooting guard Richard "Rip" Hamilton 
to a three-year deal, after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. The Bulls 
also gave MVP Derrick Rose a 5-year contract extension worth $94.8 million. 
Derrick Rose was voted as an NBA All-Star starter for the second consecutive 
year, and was the third leading voted player overall behind Dwight Howard 
and Kobe Bryant. Luol Deng was also selected as a reserve for the Eastern 
Conference. This was the first time that the Bulls had two all stars since 
1997, when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the duo. Derrick Rose 
was injured for most of the 2011–12 NBA season; however, the team was still 
able to finish with a 50–16 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern 
Conference for the second straight year and the best overall record in 
the NBA (tied with the San Antonio Spurs). Rose suffered a new injury when 
he tore his ACL during the 4th quarter of the first playoff game on April 
28, 2012, against the Philadelphia 76ers and missed the rest of the series. 
Head coach Tom Thibodeau was criticized for keeping Rose in the game even 
though the Bulls were essentially minutes away from their victory over 
the 76ers. The Bulls lost the next three games, and also lost Noah to a 
foot injury after he severely rolled his ankle stepping on Andre Iguodala's 
foot in Game 3; he briefly returned for part of the fourth quarter of that 
game, but missed the following games in the series. After winning Game 
5 at home, Bulls were eliminated by the 76ers in Game 6 in Philadelphia, 
becoming the fifth team in NBA history to be eliminated as a first seed 
by an eighth seed. In Game 6, Andre Iguodala sank two free throws with 
2.2 seconds left to put the 76ers up 79–78 after getting fouled by Ömer 
Aşık, who had missed two free throws five seconds earlier. At the end of 
the season, Boozer and Aşık were the only members on the Bulls' roster 
to have played in every game, with Korver and Brewer missing one game apiece. 
In the offseason, the Bulls gave up Lucas to the Toronto Raptors, Brewer 
to the New York Knicks, Korver to the Atlanta Hawks, Watson to the Brooklyn 
Nets and Aşık to the Houston Rockets, but brought back Kirk Hinrich. In 
addition, they added Marco Belinelli, Vladimir Radmanovic, Nazr Mohammed 
and Nate Robinson to the roster via free agency. Rose missed the entire 
2012–13 season, but despite his absence, the Bulls finished 45–37, second 
in the Central Division (behind the Indiana Pacers) and 5th in their conference. 
They defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4–3 (after leading 3–1) in the first round 
of the playoffs and lost to the Miami Heat 4–1 in the next round. During 
the season, the Bulls snapped both Miami's 27-game winning streak and the 
New York Knicks' 13-game winning streak, becoming the second team in NBA 
history to snap two winning streaks of 13 games or more in a season. Just 
10 games into the 2013–14 season, Derrick Rose would tear his medial meniscus 
on a non-contact play. He declared he would miss the remainder of the season. 
On January 7, 2014, veteran forward Luol Deng was traded to the Cleveland 
Cavaliers for center Andrew Bynum and a set of picks. Bynum was immediately 
waived after the trade went through. The Bulls would finish second in the 
Central Division with 48 wins, and earned home-court advantage in the first 
round. However, due to lack of a strong offensive weapon, they failed to 
win a single home game en route to losing to the Washington Wizards in 
five games. In the 2014 NBA draft, the Bulls traded their #16 and #19 picks 
for Doug McDermott, the former Creighton star and 5th leading scorer in 
NCAA history, who was selected with the 11th pick, and in the second round, 
took Cameron Bairstow with the 49th pick. That offseason, they signed Pau 
Gasol, re-signed Kirk Hinrich and brought over Eurostar Nikola Mirotić, 
who was acquired via a draft day trade in 2011, but could not come over 
sooner due to salary cap constraints. The second return of Derrick Rose 
gave the Bulls and their fans optimism for the 2014–15 season. With 2-time 
NBA Champion Pau Gasol and a deep bench consisting of Taj Gibson, Nikola 
Mirotić, Tony Snell, Aaron Brooks, Doug McDermott, Kirk Hinrich, among 
others, the Bulls were one of the two favorite teams to come out of the 
Eastern Conference along with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Bulls started 
off the season in style with a blowout win of the New York Knicks, and 
then winning 7 of their first 9 games (losses coming to the Cleveland Cavaliers 
and Boston Celtics). The emergence of Jimmy Butler as a primary scorer 
for the Bulls was a major surprise and he surged into the forefront of 
the "Most Improved Player of the Year" award race. Butler's statistical 
jump was noted by many as one of the greatest in NBA History,[27] going 
from scoring just 13 points per game in 2013–14 to scoring 20 points per 
game in 2014–15. Pau Gasol was considered a huge asset for the Bulls and 
averaged a double-double throughout the season. Both Butler and Gasol ended 
up making the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The Bulls' second half 
of the season was marred by inconsistency and frustration set in with Derrick 
Rose blasting the team for not being on the same page. Tension between 
management and Tom Thibodeau continued to be a dark cloud hanging over 
the organization. The Bulls finished with a 50–32 record and the 3rd seed 
in the Eastern Conference. They faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the first 
round, and took advantage of the young and inexperienced Bucks by going 
up a quick 3–0 in the series. However, inconsistency and not being on the 
same page yet again plagued the Bulls as the Bucks won the next two games, 
sending a scare to Chicago. The Bulls bounced back with fury in Game 6 
however, beating the Bucks by a playoff record 54 points winning the series 
4–2. The next round saw the Bulls facing their arch-rival Cleveland Cavaliers, 
and their biggest nemesis, LeBron James, who had beaten the Bulls in all 
three of their previous playoff meetings. The Bulls shocked the Cavs in 
Game 1 dominating them and never trailing. The Cavs answered back in Game 
2 in the same fashion, never trailing the entire game. In a pivotal Game 
3 in Chicago, the Bulls and Cavs battled closely all the way through, but 
the Bulls prevailed on a last-second buzzer beating 3-pointer by Derrick 
Rose. In Game 4, the Cavs would answer once again, with LeBron James hitting 
the buzzer-beating shot to win the game. The Bulls lack of consistency 
and poor offensive showing doomed them once again as the Cavs won the next 
2 games handily and closed out the series 4–2. After the series, speculation 
erupted about Tom Thibodeau's job security due to escalating feud between 
Thibodeau and Bulls front office managers Gar Forman and John Paxson. On 
May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a "change in approach".[28] 
The Bulls named Fred Hoiberg as their head coach on June 2, 2015.[29] The 
Bulls had only 1 draft pick in the 2015 NBA draft, and selected center 
Bobby Portis from the University of Arkansas. Bulls forward Mike Dunleavy 
Jr. was ruled out for at least the first four months of the season after 
completing back surgery. With Dunleavy out indefinitely, the Bulls promoted 
Doug McDermott to the starting lineup in his place at small forward. Before 
the season started, coach Fred Hoiberg made an incredibly controversial 
move by putting Nikola Mirotić as his starting power forward to pair with 
center Pau Gasol, meaning Joakim Noah, a long-time Bulls veteran and a 
fan-favorite was to come off the bench. Hoiberg told the media that the 
move was suggested by Noah himself but Noah denied having made any suggestions 
to Hoiberg, which sparked a distrust between the two before the season 
even began. The Bulls started the 2015–16 season off well with an impressive 
season-opening 97-95 victory against archrivals and defending Eastern Conference 
Champion Cleveland Cavaliers and jumped to an 8-3 record in the first month. 
The ending games in November and all of December however proved to be a 
tough stretch for the Bulls, going 10-9 and playing very inconsistent basketball. 
During Christmas break and after a bad home loss to the hapless Brooklyn 
Nets, one of the NBA's worst teams, Bulls shooting guard and franchise 
cornerstone Jimmy Butler publicly criticized coach Fred Hoiberg for "not 
being tough enough" with his players. The move was seen by many as a giant 
rift between the Bulls star player and their hopeful coach, fueling controversy 
over Hoiberg's possible firing or the possibility of Butler being traded. 
After the criticism, the Bulls came back and knocked off 6 straight wins, 
with Jimmy Butler dropping 40 points in 2 quarters against the Toronto 
Raptors in what many called a monumental performance by him. However soon 
afterwards, they went back to the inconsistent ways, losing 12 of their 
next 17 games. The situation didn't get much better when Jimmy Butler injured 
his knee and had to miss close to 4 weeks. The Bulls were eliminated from 
playoff contention after a loss to the Miami Heat on April 7, 2016 although 
finishing with season with a winning record of 42-40. It was the first 
time in nearly 8 years that the Bulls had missed the playoffs. On June 
22, 2016, Derrick Rose and Justin Holiday, along with a 2017 second-round 
draft pick, were traded to the New York Knicks for center Robin Lopez, 
and point guards Jerian Grant and José Calderón, who was soon traded to 
the Los Angeles Lakers.[30] On July 7, the Bulls announced the signing 
of Rose's replacement, guard Rajon Rondo.[31] On July 15, the Bulls signed 
Chicago native Dwyane Wade.[32] On October 17, 2016, the Bulls acquired 
2014 Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams in exchange for Tony Snell.[33] 
The Bulls' main division rivals have been the Detroit Pistons ever since 
the Jordan-led Bulls met the "Bad Boy" Pistons in the 1988 Eastern Conference 
semifinals. The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with 
the Pistons winning each time until 1991. The Eastern Conference Finals 
in 1991 ended with a four-game sweep of the Pistons, who walked off the 
floor with time still on the game clock.[34] The rivalry was renewed in 
the 2007 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which former Detroit cornerstone 
Ben Wallace met his former team (the Pistons won in 6 games). The geographic 
proximity and membership in the Central Division further intensify the 
rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since 
the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans have been known to have a 
disliking for Detroit professional teams, as it was in the same division 
as Chicago in all four major North American sports until recently when 
the Red Wings moved to the Eastern Conference for the 2013–14 season. The 
Bulls and the Miami Heat rivalry began once the Heat became contenders 
during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 
3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry 
has come back due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post-Michael 
Jordan era and the emergence of Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose. The revived 
rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between 
players, most notably the actions of former Heat player James Posey. The 
Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat 
winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game 
winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern 
Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4–1. Since LeBron James's departure 
from Miami, the Bulls-Heat rivalry has experienced a tough in comparison 
to the better part of the century. Another franchise that the Bulls have 
competed fiercely with is the New York Knicks. The two teams met in the 
playoffs in four consecutive years (1991–94) and again in 1996, with the 
teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first 
playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called 
"teams on the rise" under Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, respectively 
(rivalry that started their freshman year in the 1982 NCAA Men's Division 
I Basketball Championship Game with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper 
of the final). That first confrontation would belong to Chicago within 
six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls triumphed in the first three 
years (1991–93) before narrowly losing in 1994 but exacted revenge in 1996. 
As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity 
between the teams and occasionally their fans. During the Bulls' run of 
dominance, the player introductions became world-famous. Longtime announcer 
Tommy Edwards was the first to use "Sirius",[35] "On The Run" and other 
songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for 
employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by Ray Clay in 1990, and Clay 
continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including 
the music, The Alan Parsons Project's "Sirius", for all six championship 
runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, 
accompanied by "The Imperial March" from Star Wars composed by John Williams 
or "On the Run" by Pink Floyd, or "Tick of the Clock" by Chromatics. Virtually 
all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, 
and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto 
the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the 
introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks 
have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, 
computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics 
feature the 3D-animated 'Running of the Bulls' en route to the United Center, 
along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, 
Alan Parsons wrote "Sirius" for his own band and was the sound engineer 
for "On the Run" from Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon. Traditionally, 
the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, 
power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. Thus during the championship 
era, Scottie Pippen was usually the first (or second) Bulls player introduced, 
and Michael Jordan the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to 
play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with Derrick Rose's 
arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred 
point guard the last player introduced. Although internal disputes eventually 
led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of 
Tommy Edwards as the announcer.[36] As part of Edwards' return, the introductions 
changed as a new introduction was developed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, 
Ethan Stoller and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago. The introduction 
also included a newly composed remix of the traditional Sirius theme. The 
Bulls have an unofficial tradition of wearing black shoes (regardless of 
being home or away) during the playoffs, which dates all the way back to 
1989 when they debuted the tradition.[37] Then-Bulls backup center Brad 
Sellers suggested to wear black shoes as a way to show unity within the 
team. For the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks 
with the black shoes, similar to the University of Michigan and the Fab 
Five which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since, many 
teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs. It was noted 
when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004–05 season 
after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.[38] 
Even though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 
1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the 1995 playoffs against 
the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his Air Jordan XI shoe, he wore 
the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined 
by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the 2009 
playoffs, the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players 
wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston 
Celtics.[39] More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color 
rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance 
of the tradition. The Bulls and their arena mates, the Chicago Blackhawks, 
share an odd tradition dating back decades. Every fall, the Ringling Bros. 
and Barnum & Bailey Circus comes to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since 
this circus plays large venues instead of tents, it takes over the United 
Center for its entire run and the Bulls are forced, along with the Blackhawks, 
to take an extended road trip that usually lasts two weeks. The start of 
the "circus trip", as many sportscasters have dubbed it, is usually noted 
on shows such as SportsCenter.[40][41] Dick Klein wanted a name that evoked 
Chicago's traditional meat packing industry and the Chicago Stadium's proximity 
to the Union Stock Yards. Klein considered names like Matadors or Toreadors, 
but dismissed them, saying, "If you think about it, no team with as many 
as three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for 
the [Montreal Canadiens]." After discussing possible names with his family, 
Klein settled on Bulls when his son Mark said, "Dad, that's a bunch of 
bull!"[42] The iconic Bulls' logo is a charging red bull's face (seen at 
left). The logo was designed by noted American graphic designer Dean P. 
Wessel[43] and was adopted in 1966. At one point, the Bulls also had an 
alternate logo during the early 70s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but 
with a cloud that says "Windy City" below the bull's nose. The Bulls have 
three different uniforms: a white home uniform, a red road uniform, and 
a black alternate road uniform. The design of the white and red sets are 
nearly identical, with the team name featured on the front over the number, 
and the player's last name over the number on the back and under the Bulls' 
logo. The shorts have the Bulls logo in a diamond shaped design on the 
sides of the legs. The red and white uniforms have remained mostly unchanged 
since 1966, with minor modifications from off-centered numbers, drop shadows 
and side stripes to white lettering and "Chicago" wordmark on the road 
uniforms. The present red/white uniform design was unveiled in the 1985–86 
season, first using screen printing (with the player names in block lettering 
without the additional trim), before returning to the traditional sewing 
methods (player names are in serifed block lettering and with added trim). 
The Bulls logo was added atop the player's name in 2004. Since the 2014–15 
season, a gold tab representing the Bulls' six championships was added 
on the back hemline, while the NBA logo replaced the Bulls logo atop the 
player's name. The classic red uniform with the script "Chicago" wordmark 
was revived as throwback uniforms during the 2003–04 and 2015–16 seasons. 
During the former season, the uniform featured player names in black with 
white trim (similar to the early 1970s iterations), but in the latter season, 
it featured names in white block lettering (similar to the uniforms worn 
in Michael Jordan's rookie season of 1984–85). The less-often used black 
uniform (often used about 10 times per season) shares the same design as 
the white and the red ones, except that "Bulls" is replaced with "Chicago" 
on the front of the jersey. Black jerseys were first introduced during 
Chicago's 72-win run in the 1995–96 NBA season, and shared a similar design 
to the Bulls' regular road and home uniforms except that they featured 
pinstripes and a diamond that was not featured around the Bulls' logo in 
the shorts. This design was resurrected as part of the NBA Hardwood Classics 
Nights program, as well as NBA Heritage Week presentations (December 7–14, 
2007) throughout the 2007–08 season. The black pinstriped uniform was used 
again for Hardwood Classics Night during the 2012–13 season as part of 
the NBA's tribute to the 1990s during the month of February. In the 1997–98 
NBA season the pinstripes were removed. In 1999 "Chicago" replaced "Bulls" 
above the number in the jersey front, along with a change to v-necked jerseys 
and loss of arm piping a few years later. During the 2006–07 NBA season, 
the player's name on the back of the alternate jersey was changed to white 
from the red/black/white combination, and the red diamond was added to 
surround the logo in the sides of the shorts. The names reverted to red 
lettering with white trim in the following season. In the 2014–15 season, 
the diamonds on the shorts were tweaked, now featuring a black background 
and red striping, while a sleeved version of the black uniforms was used 
for select games. In the 2015–16 season, the Bulls wore a grey "Pride" 
sleeved uniform, featuring the team name and other lettering in red with 
white trim. The shorts featured a more modernized version of the diamond, 
along with four six-pointed stars on either side. The Bulls wear white 
shoes at home during the regular season, but black shoes on the road and 
black shoes all throughout the playoffs, both at home and on the road. 
The unofficial playoff tradition goes back to the Jordan era, recommended 
by Brad Sellers as a show of team unity. The Bulls also wear only their 
red uniform on the road during the playoffs. During the 2008–09 season 
and first three games of the playoffs, however, the Bulls wore black sneakers 
on away games only while wearing white sneakers on home games. Since the 
2009–10 season, however, the NBA has relaxed its rules on specific sneaker 
colors on home and away games, and several Bulls players are seen wearing 
white sneakers on the road, or black at home during the regular season, 
even seen wearing red on occasion. In 2006 the Bulls were one of three 
teams to take part in the NBA's first ever St. Patrick's Day uniform program 
(with the Boston Celtics and formerly the New York Knicks). The program 
consisted of the teams wearing specially designed green uniforms. For the 
program the Bulls' changed their red road uniforms to green while maintaining 
the traditional red and black bull's head on the shorts and the back of 
the jersey as well as the wording of "Bulls" on the front remaining black. 
In the 2014–15 season, a sleeved version of the St. Patrick's uniforms 
was used, with tweaks such as white lettering with gold and black trim, 
and the city name in front. The Bulls kept the lettering the following 
season, but reverted to the sleeveless version. The Bulls also participated 
in the NBA's "Noche Latina" celebrations throughout March, beginning in 
2009. They used a slightly altered version of their regular red road uniforms, 
with the wording "Los Bulls" to honor Hispanics throughout Chicago. The 
uniforms were used every season except for 2014, when they used a sleeved 
black version with "Los Bulls" in white with red and black trim. During 
the NBA's "Green Week" celebrations, the Bulls also wore green uniforms, 
but with a slightly darker shade from their St. Patrick's Day counterparts. 
They used their black alternate uniforms as its template. They donned the 
uniforms in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on April 9, 2009. Benny 
the Bull is the main mascot of the Chicago Bulls. He was first introduced 
in 1969. Benny is a red bull who wears number 1. Benny is one of the oldest 
and best known mascots in all of professional sports. The Bulls also had 
another mascot named Da Bull. Introduced in 1995, he was described on the 
team website as being the high flying cousin of Benny, known for his dunking 
skills. The man who portrayed Da Bull was arrested in 2004 for possession 
and selling marijuana from his car.[44] Da Bull was retired soon after 
the incident. While Benny has a family-friendly design, Da Bull was designed 
as a more realistic bull. Unlike Benny, Da Bull was brown. He also had 
a meaner facial expression and wore number 95. In 1992, the team began 
training at the Berto Center, located at 550 Lake Cook Rd, Deerfield, Illinois. 
However, on June 13, 2012, the team announced that it would move its practice 
facility to a downtown location closer to the United Center to reduce game 
day commutes.[45] On September 12, 2014, the Bulls officially opened their 
new training facility, the Advocate Center.[46] Tom Amberry has worked 
with the Bulls to help the players with their free-throw shooting.[47] 
Roster • Transactions Last transaction: 2016–10–27 The Bulls hold the draft 
rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside 
the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college 
draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign 
with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft 
rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA 
team ends.[48] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from 
trades with other teams. The flagship station for the Bulls is WLS AM 890. 
The Bulls signed a multiyear deal with Cumulus Media to broadcast regular 
and postseason games on WLS through 2021.[54] Chuck Swirsky and Bill Wennington 
are the announcers. The Bulls' television broadcasts are split among Comcast 
SportsNet Chicago, which broadcasts most of the games, WGN-TV, and WCIU-TV.[55] 
So far, WGN Sports and Comcast SportsNet Chicago will at least air all 
of the home games in High Definition. The announcers are Neil Funk and 
Stacey King. Also worth noting is that WGN-TV does not air all of its Chicago 
Bulls games nationwide: only a select few, usually Saturday games, were 
nationally televised on WGN America from 1999–2014. The rest are only available
