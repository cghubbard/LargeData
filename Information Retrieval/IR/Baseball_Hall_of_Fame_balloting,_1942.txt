The 1942 election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was 
the first conducted in three years. The Baseball Writers' Association of 
America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from 20th century players and elected 
Rogers Hornsby. This was the only election or committee meeting scheduled 
between 1939 and 1945. The only other activities were the special election 
of Lou Gehrig following his 1939 farewell and the prompt election of Commissioner 
Landis following his death late in 1944. After the National Baseball Museum 
opened in 1939, it remained to be determined how the membership in its 
Hall of Fame would be determined in the future. The Baseball Writers' Association 
of America (BBWAA) had determined to vote every three years rather than 
annually, although it had voted in special election to consider Lou Gehrig. 
That move was a widely criticized, as observers generally agreed that it 
was a good pace to elect about three recent players annually, as from 1936 
to 1939. After the Centennial Committee made six selections in 1939 from 
the figures of the 19th century, baseball's Commissioner Landis completely 
revised the committee's membership, designating it the Hall of Fame Committee 
and establishing it as the institution's permanent governing body. From 
1939 to 1944 its four members were Athletics owner and manager Connie Mack, 
Yankees president Ed Barrow, Braves president Bob Quinn, and sportswriter 
Sid Mercer. This committee was responsible, in its function as the Old-Timers 
Committee, for selecting additional worthy candidates from the 19th century, 
but it never convened during this 5-year period, and thereby selected no 
one. Inaction fostered greater complaints that the stars of the 1880s and 
1890s were being ignored. The relative slight was tiny because the baseball 
writers voted only once between 1939 and 1945 and elected only one recent 
player. Members of the BBWAA again had the authority to select any players 
active in the 20th century, provided they had been retired for one year. 
Voters were instructed to cast votes for 10 candidates; any candidate receiving 
votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to 
the Hall. A total of 233 ballots were cast, with 2,328 individual votes 
for 72 specific candidates, an average of 9.99 per ballot; 175 votes were 
required for election. Players of the 1900s and 1910s, who many voters 
felt should be given priority, dominated the voting to an even greater 
extent than they had in 1939. Of the top 22 candidates in the voting, 17 
had not seen any substantial play since 1917; only 3 of the top 32 had 
played their final season anytime between 1918 and 1933. Players who had 
been retired over 24 years – 42 of the 72 named – received 66% of the votes. 
The results were announced in January 1942. The sole candidate who received 
at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; 
candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated
