Vermont (i/vərˈmɒntˌ vɜːr-/[6][a]) is a state in the New England region 
of the northeastern United States. It borders the other U.S. states of 
Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the 
west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Lake Champlain 
forms half of Vermont's western border with the state of New York and the 
Green Mountains run north–south the length of the state. Vermont is the 
second least populous of the U.S. states, with fewer than 50,000 more residents 
than Wyoming. The capital is Montpelier, the least populous state capital 
in the U.S. The most populous municipality, Burlington, is the least populous 
city in the U.S. to be the most populous within a state. As of 2015, Vermont 
continued to be the leading producer of maple syrup in the U.S.[7] It was 
ranked as the safest state in the country in January 2016.[8] For thousands 
of years inhabited by indigenous peoples, including the Algonquian-speaking 
Abenaki and Mohawk, much of the territory that is now Vermont was claimed 
by France's colony of New France. France ceded the territory to Great Britain 
after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War. For many years, the 
nearby colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, 
disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants). Settlers 
who held land titles granted by New York were opposed by the Green Mountain 
Boys militia, which supported the many settlers whose claims were based 
on grants from New Hampshire. Ultimately, those settlers prevailed in creating 
an independent state, the Vermont Republic. Founded in 1777 during the 
American Revolutionary War, the republic lasted for 14 years. Aside from 
the original 13 states that were formerly colonies, Vermont is one of only 
four other U.S. states that were previously sovereign states (along with 
California, Hawaii, and Texas). Vermont was also the first state to join 
the U.S. as its 14th member state after the original 13. While still an 
independent republic, Vermont was the first of any future U.S. state to 
partially abolish slavery.[9][10] It played an important geographic role 
in the Underground Railroad.[11] Vermont State House in Montpelier The

Autumn along Route 73 Winhall River Trail, in winter Burke Mountain from 
Lyndonville Mount Mansfield, at 4,393 feet (1,339 m), is the highest point 
in Vermont. Vermont is located in the New England region in the eastern 
United States and comprises 9,614 square miles (24,900 km2), making it 
the 45th-largest state. It is the only state that does not have any buildings 
taller than 124 feet (38 m).[12] Land comprises 9,250 square miles (24,000 km2) 
and water comprises 365 square miles (950 km2), making it the 43rd-largest 
in land area and the 47th in water area. In total area, it is larger than 
El Salvador and smaller than Haiti. The west bank of the Connecticut River 
marks the eastern (New Hampshire) border of the state (the river is part 
of New Hampshire).[13] 41% of Vermont's land area is part of the Connecticut 
River's watershed.[14] Lake Champlain, the major lake in Vermont, is the 
sixth-largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont 
from New York in the northwest portion of the state. From north to south, 
Vermont is 159 miles (256 km) long. Its greatest width, from east to west, 
is 89 miles (143 km) at the Canada–US border; the narrowest width is 37 
miles (60 km) at the Massachusetts line. The width averages 60.5 miles 
(97.4 km). The state's geographic center is approximately three miles (5 km) 
east of Roxbury, in Washington County. There are fifteen US federal border 
crossings between Vermont and Canada. The origin of the name "Vermont" 
is uncertain, but likely comes from the French les Verts Monts, meaning 
"the Green Mountains".[15] Thomas Young introduced it in 1777.[16] Some 
authorities[specify] say that the mountains were called green because they 
were more forested than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and 
Adirondacks of New York; others say that the predominance of mica-quartz-chlorite 
schist, a green-hued metamorphosed shale, is the reason. The Green Mountain 
range forms a north–south spine running most of the length of the state, 
slightly west of its center. In the southwest portion of the state are 
the Taconic Mountains; the Granitic Mountains are in the northeast.[17] 
In the northwest, near Lake Champlain, is the fertile Champlain Valley. 
In the south of the valley is Lake Bomoseen. Several mountains have timberlines 
with delicate year-round alpine ecosystems, including Mount Mansfield, 
the highest mountain in the state; Killington Peak, the second-highest; 
Camel's Hump, the state's third-highest; and Mount Abraham, the fifth-highest 
peak.[18] Areas in Vermont administered by the National Park Service include 
the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park (in Woodstock) 
and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.[19] Vermont has nine incorporated 
cities. The most populated city in Vermont by population is Burlington, 
and its metropolitan area is also the most populous in the state with an 
estimate of 214,796 as of 2013. Although these towns are large enough to 
be considered cities, they are not incorporated as such. The annual mean 
temperature for the state is 43 °F (6 °C).[20] Vermont has a humid continental 
climate, with muddy springs, in general a mild early summer, hot Augusts;[citation 
needed] it has colorful autumns: Vermont's hills reveal red, orange, and 
(on sugar maples) gold foliage as cold weather approaches. Winters are 
colder at higher elevations.[21] It has a Köppen climate classification 
of Dfb, similar to Minsk, Stockholm, and Fargo.[22] The rural northeastern 
section (dubbed the "Northeast Kingdom") often averages 10 °F (5.6 °C) 
colder than the southern areas of the state during winter. The annual snowfall 
averages between 60 and 100 inches (1,500 and 2,500 mm) depending on elevation. 
Vermont is the seventh coldest state in the country.[23] In winter, until 
typical El Niño conditions, Vermont's winters are "too cold to snow"; the 
air is too cold to contain sufficient moisture to prompt precipitation.[24] 
The highest recorded temperature was 105 °F (41 °C), at Vernon, on July 
4, 1911; the lowest recorded temperature was −50 °F (−46 °C), at Bloomfield, 
on December 30, 1933; this is the lowest temperature recorded in New England 
(Big Black River, Maine, also recorded a verified −50 °F (−46 °C) in 2009).[25][26] 
The agricultural growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days.[27] The USDA 
Plant hardiness zones for the state range between zone 3b (no colder than 
−35 °F (−37 °C)) in the Northeast Kingdom and northern part of the state 
and zone 5b (no colder than −15 °F (−26 °C)) in the southern part of the 
state.[28] The state receives between 2,000 and 2,400 hours of sunshine 
annually.[29] There are five distinct physiographic regions of Vermont. 
Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern 
Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, 
and the Vermont Piedmont.[30] About 500 million years ago, Vermont was 
part of Laurentia and located in the tropics.[31] The central and southern 
Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont, formed about 
one billion years ago during the first mountain building period (or orogeny). 
Subsequently, about 400 million years ago, the second mountain building 
period created Green Mountain peaks that were 15,000–20,000 feet (4,600–6,100 m) 
tall, three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas. 
The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the 
Champlain Thrust, running north–south to the west of the mountains (now 
the eastern shore of Lake Champlain). It is an example of geological fault 
thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation. As a result 
of tectonic formation, Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be 
formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods. Western 
Vermont mainly from the older Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian material.[32] Several 
large deposits within the state contain granite.[citation needed] The remains 
of the Chazy Formation can be observed in Isle La Motte. It was one of 
the first tropical reefs. It is the site of the limestone Fisk Quarry, 
which contains a collection of ancient marine fossils such as stromatoporoids 
that date back to 200 million years ago. It is believed that at one point, 
Vermont was connected to Africa (Pangaea) and the fossils found and the 
rock formations found on the coasts in both Africa and America are further 
evidence of the Pangaea theory.[33][34][35] In the past four centuries, 
Vermont has experienced a few earthquakes rarely centered under Vermont, 
the highest being a Richter magnitude scale 6.0 in 1952.[36] The state 
contains 41 species of reptiles and amphibians, 89 species of fish, of 
which 12 are non native;[37] 193 species of breeding birds, 58 species 
of mammals, more than 15,000 insect species, and 2,000 higher plant species, 
plus fungi, algae, and 75 different types of natural communities.[38] Vermont 
contains one species of venomous snake, the eastern timber rattlesnake, 
which is confined to a few acres in western Rutland County.[39] By the 
mid-19th century, wild turkeys were exterminated in the state through overhunting 
and destruction of habitat. Sixteen were re-introduced in 1969 and had 
grown to an estimated flock of 45,000 in 2009.[40] in 2013, hunters killed 
6,968 of these.[41] Since 1970, reduction of farmland has resulted in reduced 
environment for, and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including 
the American woodcock, brown thrasher, eastern towhee, willow flycatcher, 
golden-winged warbler, blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore 
oriole.[42] DDT destroyed the eggshells of ospreys, which resulted in their 
disappearance from the state. This species began reviving in 1998. As of 
2010, they were no longer endangered in the state.[43] White-nose syndrome 
killed an estimated two-thirds of all cave-wintering bats in the state 
from 2008 to 2010.[44] The New England cottontail disappeared from the 
state in the early 1970s, out-competed by the eastern cottontail rabbit, 
imported in the 1800s for hunting, and which is better able to detect predators.[45] 
Out of a total of 33 species of bumblebee, there were 19 or 20 in the state 
in 2013. Bombus terricola (the yellow-banded bumblebee), although once 
common in Vermont, has not been seen in most of its range since 1999 and 
is now absent from Vermont.[46] For honey bees, colony collapse disorder 
has affected bee population in the state, as elsewhere.[47] Invasive species 
included the Asian spotted-wing drosophila, which started damaging berry 
crops in 2012. Vermont was the initial point of invasion in New England.[48] 
Since 2010 the Vermont Department of Health has worked with the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct blood serum surveys of the 
state's deer and moose populations. Tests for eastern equine encephalitis 
virus antibodies were positive in moose or deer in each of Vermont's counties. 
In 2012, 12% of deer and 2.4% of moose tested positive.[49] Vermont is 
in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. Much of the state, 
in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern 
hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The western border with New 
York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the Eastern Great Lakes 
lowland forests. The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut 
River are covered by Northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak.[50] Invasive 
wild honeysuckle has been deemed a threat to the state's forests, native 
species of plants, and wildlife.[51] Many of Vermont's rivers, including 
the Winooski River, have been subjected to man-made barriers to prevent 
flooding. Climate change appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry. 
Sugar maples have been subject to stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, 
pear thrips, and, in 2011, an excessive deer herd that is forced to eat 
bark in the winter. These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce 
sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week 
in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples, 
in effect forcing the sugar maples to "migrate" north to Canada.[52] Between 
8500 and 7000 BCE, at the time of the Champlain Sea, Native Americans inhabited 
and hunted in present-day Vermont. During the Archaic period, from the 
8th millennium BCE to 1000 BCE, Native Americans migrated year-round. During 
the Woodland period, from 1000 BCE to 1600 CE, villages and trade networks 
were established, and ceramic and bow and arrow technology was developed. 
In the western part of the state there lived a small population of Algonquian-speaking 
tribes, including the Mohican and Abenaki peoples. Sometime between 1500 
and 1600 CE, the Iroquois, based in present-day New York, drove many of 
the smaller native tribes out of Vermont, later using the area as a hunting 
ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki. The population in 1500 CE 
was estimated to be around 10,000 people. The first European to see Vermont 
is thought to have been Jacques Cartier in 1535. On July 30, 1609, French 
explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed Vermont as part of New France. In 
1666, French settlers erected Fort Sainte Anne on Isle La Motte,[53] the 
first European settlement in Vermont. In 1638 a "violent" earthquake was 
felt throughout New England, centered in the St. Lawrence Valley. This 
was the first seismic event noted in Vermont.[36] In 1690 a group of Dutch-British 
settlers from Albany established a settlement and trading post at Chimney 
Point 8 miles (13 km) west of present-day Addison.[citation needed] During 
Dummer's War the first permanent British settlement was established in 
1724 with the construction of Fort Dummer. It was to protect the nearby 
settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro.[54] From 1731 to 1734 the French 
constructed Fort St. Frédéric, which gave the French control of the New 
France/Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley. With the outbreak 
of the French and Indian War in 1754, the North American front of the Seven 
Years' War between the French and British, the French began construction 
of Fort Carillon at present-day Ticonderoga, New York in 1755. The British 
failed to take Fort St. Frédéric or Fort Carillon between 1755 and 1758. 
In 1759 a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops 
under Sir Jeffery Amherst captured Carillon, after which the French abandoned 
Fort St. Frédéric. Amherst constructed Fort Crown Point next to the remains 
of the Fort St. Frédéric, securing British control over the area.[citation 
needed] Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, through the 
1763 Treaty of Paris they ceded control of the land to the British. Colonial 
settlement was limited by the Crown to lands east of the Appalachians, 
in order to try to end encroachment on Native American lands. The territory 
of Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort 
William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog.[citation 
needed] With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont. Ultimately, 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.[citation 
needed] On July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between 
New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, 
north of Massachusetts, and south of 45 degrees north latitude.[55] New 
York refused to recognize the land titles known as the New Hampshire Grants 
(towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth) 
and dissatisfied New Hampshire settlers organized in opposition. In 1770 
Ethan Allen, his brothers Ira and Levi, and the Allens' cousins Seth Warner 
and Remember Baker, recruited an informal militia known as the Green Mountain 
Boys to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against 
newcomers from New York.[citation needed] In 1775, after the outbreak of 
the American Revolutionary War, the Green Mountain Boys assisted a force 
from Connecticut, led by Benedict Arnold, in capturing the British fort 
at Ticonderoga. Thereafter, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia directed 
the New York colony's revolutionary congress to fund and equip Allen's 
militia as a ranger regiment of the Continental Army, which it did. Seth 
Warner was chosen by the men of the regiment to lead, while Ethan Allen 
went on to serve as a colonel in Schuyler's Army of Northern New York.[citation 
needed] On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants 
declared the independence of Vermont.[56] For the first six months of its 
existence, it was called the Republic of New Connecticut.[57] On June 2, 
1777, a second convention of 72 delegates met and adopted the name "Vermont." 
This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian, Dr. Thomas Young, friend 
and mentor of Ethan Allen, who wrote to them on how to achieve admission 
into the newly independent United States of America as the 14th state.[57] 
On July 4, they completed the drafting of the Constitution of Vermont at 
the Windsor Tavern, and adopted it on July 8. This was the first written 
constitution in North America to ban adult slavery,[58] saying male slaves 
become free at the age of 21 and females at 18. It provided for universal 
adult male suffrage, and required support of public schools. It was in 
effect from 1777 to 1786.[59] The revised constitution of 1786, which established 
a greater separation of powers, continued in effect until 1793, two years 
after Vermont's admission to the Union. Slavery was fully banned by state 
law on November 25, 1858, less than three years before the American Civil 
War.[60][61][62] Vermont played an important geographical role in the Underground 
Railroad, which helped American slaves escape to Canada.[63] The Battle 
of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history 
of the state of Vermont and the United States. A combined American force, 
under General John Stark's command, attacked the Hessian column at Hoosick, 
New York, just across the border from Bennington. It killed or captured 
virtually the entire Hessian detachment. General Burgoyne never recovered 
from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man 
force at Saratoga, New York, on October 17 that year.[64] The battles of 
Bennington and Saratoga together are recognized as the turning point in 
the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British 
army. The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a 
legal holiday. The Battle of Hubbardton (July 7, 1777) was the only Revolutionary 
battle within the present boundaries of Vermont. Although the Continental 
forces were technically defeated, the British forces were damaged to the 
point that they did not pursue the Americans (retreating from Fort Ticonderoga) 
any further. Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based 
in the eastern town of Windsor for 14 years. The independent state of Vermont 
issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788[65] and operated a statewide postal 
service. Thomas Chittenden was the Governor in 1778–89 and in 1790–91. 
Because the state of New York continued to assert a disputed claim that 
Vermont was a part of New York, Vermont could not be admitted to the Union 
under Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution until the legislature of 
New York consented. On March 6, 1790, the legislature made its consent 
contingent upon a negotiated agreement on the precise boundary between 
the two states. When commissioners from New York and Vermont met to decide 
on the boundary, Vermont's negotiators insisted on also settling the property 
ownership disputes with New Yorkers, rather than leaving that to be decided 
later in a federal court.[66] The negotiations were successfully concluded 
in October 1790 with an agreement that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New 
York to be distributed among New Yorkers who claimed land in Vermont under 
New York land patents.[67] In January 1791, a convention in Vermont voted 
105–4[68] to petition Congress to become a state in the federal union. 
Congress acted on February 18, 1791 to admit Vermont to the Union as the 
14th state as of March 4, 1791.[69] Vermont became the first to enter the 
Union after the original 13 states. From the mid-1850s on, Vermonters became 
activists opposing slavery, which they had previously worked to contain 
in the South. Abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens was born in Vermont and later 
represented a district in Pennsylvania in Congress. He developed as a national 
leader and later promoted Radical Republican goals after the American Civil 
War. While the Whig Party shriveled, and the Republican Party emerged, 
Vermont supported Republican candidates. In 1860 it voted for Abraham Lincoln 
for US President, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.[70] 
During the American Civil War, Vermont sent 33,288 men into United States 
service. 5,224 Vermonters, over 15%, were killed or mortally wounded in 
action or died of disease.[71] The northernmost land/battle action of the 
war, the St. Albans Raid, took place in Vermont. However, the raiders were 
forced to return the possessions after the Canadians captured them at their 
border.[72] Beginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont attracted numerous 
Irish, Scots-Irish and Italian immigrants, adding to its residents of mostly 
English and French-Canadian ancestry. Many migrated to Barre, where the 
men worked as stonecutters of granite, for which there was a national market. 
Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states. Many 
Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses in the late 19th century 
to support their families. Such facilities helped absorb new residents, 
who peaked between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people 
of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.[73] 
The state has suffered some natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries 
related to hurricanes, extensive rain and flooding. Large-scale flooding 
occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 84 people died, 
including the state's lieutenant governor.[74] The 1938 New England hurricane 
in the fall of that year blew down 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km2) of trees, 
one-third of the total forest at the time in New England. Three billion 
board feet were salvaged. Today many of the older trees in Vermont are 
about 75 years old, dating from after this storm.[75] Another flood occurred 
in 1973, causing the deaths of two people and millions of dollars in property 
damage. The state suffered severe flooding in late August 2011 caused by 
Tropical Storm Irene. Heavy rains caused flooding in many towns built in 
narrow river valleys. The governor described it as one of the worst natural 
disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries, second only to the flood of 1927.[76] 
Vermont approved women's suffrage decades before it became part of the 
national constitution. Women were first allowed to vote in the elections 
of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited suffrage. They were 
first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative 
races. In 1964 the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. Sims required 
"one-man, one-vote" redistricting in all states; this resulted in major 
changes in Vermont. This ruling required city residents to be given an 
equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont 
had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states 
in those years.[77] Until that time, apportionment was based on county 
jurisdictions, which had given more power to rural counties and decreased 
representation of urban residents. This arrangement had meant that urban 
issues were not considered in proportion to the number of people affected 
by them.[citation needed] In July 2000 Vermont became the first state to 
introduce civil unions. In 2009 Vermont became the first state to legislate 
same-sex marriage unforced by court challenge or ruling.[78] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, as of April 15, 2015, Vermont has an 
estimated population of 626,042,[80] which was an increase of 297, since 
April 15, 2010.[81] This includes a natural increase 3,178 (31,716 births 
minus 28,538 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 2,432 people 
out of the state.[81] In 2006 it had the second lowest birthrate in the 
nation, 42/1000 women.[82] The center of population of Vermont is located 
in Washington County, in the town of Warren.[83] As of 2014, 51.3% of Vermont's 
population was born in the state (compared with 58.7% for the United States).[84] 
The changing demographics between those with multi-generational ties to 
the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, 
has resulted in a degree of tension between the two perspectives. This 
tension is expressed in the terms, "Woodchuck", being applied to those 
established in the state, and "Flatlander", applied to the newcomers.[85] 
Vermont is the least populous New England state. As of 2012, Vermont was 
one of only two states in the U.S. with fewer people than the District 
of Columbia—the other was Wyoming.[86] From 2010 to 2013, 16 out of Vermont's 
251 towns experienced an increase in population. All towns in Chittenden 
increased with the exception of Burlington. More than 180 towns experienced 
a decrease, which hadn't happened since the mid-19th century.[87] 94.3% 
of the population identified as white not of Hispanic or Latino origin 
in a 2013 US Census estimate.[88] Vermont is the second whitest state in 
the Union, second only to Maine.[89] In 2009, 12.6% of people over 15 were 
divorced. This was the fifth highest percentage in the nation.[90] As of 
2008 the median age of Vermonters was 40.6 and that of the work force was 
43.7, compared with the national average of 41.1 years.[91] Linguists have 
identified speech patterns found among Vermonters as belonging to Western 
New England English, a dialect of New England English, which features of 
full pronunciation of all r sounds, pronouncing horse and hoarse the same, 
and pronouncing vowels in father and bother the same, none of which are 
features traditionally shared in neighboring Eastern New England English.[92] 
Some rural speakers replace a t with a glottal stop (mitten sounds like 
"mi'in" and Vermont like "Vermon' "[a]).[93] A dwindling segment of the 
Vermont population, generally both rural and male—especially in northwestern 
Vermont, pronounces certain vowels in a distinctive manner (e.g. cows sounds 
like "cayows," fight like "foight,"[94] calf like "caaf," there like "thair,"[95] 
hand like "hay-nd," and back like "bah-k").[96] Eastern New England English—also 
found in New Hampshire, Maine and eastern Massachusetts—was common in eastern 
Vermont in the mid-twentieth century and before, but has become rare.[97] 
There the practice of dropping the r sound in words ending in r (farmer 
sounds like "farm-uh") and adding an r sound to words ending in a vowel 
(idea sounds like "idee-er") was common.[95][97] Those characteristics 
in eastern Vermont appear to have been inherited from West Country[98] 
and Scots-Irish ancestors.[96] In 2015 Vermont was ranked by Forbes magazine 
as 42nd best among states in which to do business.[99] It was 32nd in 2007, 
and 30th in 2006.[100] In 2008 an economist said that the state had "a 
really stagnant economy, which is what we are forecasting for Vermont for 
the next 30 years."[101] In May 2010 Vermont's 6.2% unemployment rate was 
the fourth lowest in the nation.[102] This rate reflects the second sharpest 
decline among the 50 states since the prior May.[103] According to the 
2010 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis report, Vermont's gross state product 
(GSP) was $26 billion.[104] Not accounting for size, this places the state 
50th among the 50 states. It stood 34th in per capita GSP.[105][106] Components 
of GSP were:[107][108] Canada was Vermont's largest foreign trade partner 
in 2007. The state's second-largest foreign trade partner was Taiwan.[109] 
The state had $4 billion worth of commerce with Québec.[110] One measure 
of economic activity is retail sales. The state had $5.2 billion in 2007.[111] 
In 2008, 8,631 new businesses were registered in Vermont, a decline of 
500 from 2007.[112] The median household income from 2002 to 2004 was $45,692. 
This was 15th nationally.[113] The median wage in the state in 2008 was 
$15.31 hourly or $31,845 annually.[114] In 2007 about 80% of the 68,000 
Vermonters who qualify for food stamps received them.[115] 40% of seniors 
75 years or older live on annual incomes of $21,660 or less.[116] In 2011, 
15.2% of Vermonters received food stamps. This compares to 14.8% nationally.[117] 
In 2011, 91,000 seniors received an annual average of $14,000 from Social 
Security. This was 59% of the average senior's income. This contributed 
$1.7 billion to the state's economy.[118] Agriculture contributed 2.2% 
of the state's domestic product in 2000.[119] In 2000 about 3% of the state's 
working population engaged in agriculture.[120] Farms in the state were 
estimated to have hired 1,000 illegal immigrants as of 2009, largely tolerated 
by local police and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.[121] Dairy 
farming is the primary source of agricultural income. In the last half 
of the 20th century, developers had plans to build condos and houses on 
what was relatively inexpensive, open land. Vermont's government responded 
with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering 
initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont's dairy industry. Still, the 
number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85% from the 11,206 
dairy farms operating in 1947. In 2003 there were fewer than 1,500 dairy 
farms in the state; in 2006 there were 1,138; and in 2007 there were 1,087. 
The number of dairy farms has been diminishing by 10% annually.[122] The 
number of cattle in Vermont had declined by 40%; however, milk production 
has doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow.[123] 
While milk production rose, Vermont's market share declined. Within a group 
of states supplying the Boston and New York City markets,[124] Vermont 
was third in market share, with 10.6%; New York has 44.9% and Pennsylvania 
has 32.9%.[125] In 2007 dairy farmers received a record $23.60 for 100 
pounds (45 kg) of milk. This dropped in 2008 to $17.[126] The average dairy 
farm produced 1.3 million pounds of milk annually in 2008.[127] The dairy 
barn remains an iconic image of Vermont, but the 87% decrease in active 
dairy farms between 1947 and 2003[128] means that preservation of the dairy 
barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining 
a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy. The Vermont 
Barn Census, organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit 
state and local historic preservation programs, has developed educational 
and administrative systems for recording the number, condition, and features 
of barns throughout Vermont.[129] In 2009 there were 543 organic farms. 
Twenty percent of the dairy farms were organic and 23% (128) vegetable 
farms were organic. Organic farming increased in 2006–07, but leveled off 
in 2008–09. Nor are any expected for 2010.[130] A significant amount of 
milk is shipped into the Boston market. Therefore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts sanitary standards. Without 
this certification, a farmer may not sell milk for distribution into the 
bulk market.[131] Forest Products have always been a staple to the economy 
comprising 1% of the state total Gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing 
as of 2013.[132] In 2007 Windham County contained the largest concentration 
of kilns for drying lumber east of the Mississippi River. The decline of 
farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological 
succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and 
non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful 
forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared 
to only 37% forest in 1880s when sheep farming was at its peak and large 
amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing land.[133] Over 85% of that 
area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families. 
In 2013 73.054 million cubic feet of wood was harvested in Vermont[134] 
A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21.504 million 
feet being shipped overseas plus an additional 16.384 million cubic feet 
to Canada.[134] Most of it was processed within the state. In this century 
the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half. The annual 
net growth has been estimated at 172.810 million cubic feet.[134] The USDA 
estimates that 8.584 billion cubic feet remain in the state.[134] Forest 
products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used 
in houses and furniture hold carbon for long periods of time while the 
trees that were removed are replaced overtime with new growing stock.[135] 
While wood pellets are replacing coal in European power plants reducing 
CO2 emissions by up to 90% and preventing mountaintop removal for coal 
mining.[136] An important and growing part of Vermont's economy is the 
manufacture and sale of artisan foods, fancy foods, and novelty items trading 
in part upon the Vermont "brand," which the state manages and defends. 
Examples of these specialty exports include Cabot Cheese, the Vermont Teddy 
Bear Company, Fine Paints of Europe, Vermont Butter and Cheese Company, 
several micro breweries, ginseng growers, Burton Snowboards, Lake Champlain 
Chocolates, King Arthur Flour, and Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream. There were 
about 2,000 maple products producers in 2010.[137] In 2001 Vermont produced 
275,000 US gallons (1,040,000 L) of maple syrup, about 25% of U.S. production. 
For 2005 that number was 410,000 US gallons (1,600,000 l; 340,000 imp gal) 
accounting for 37% of national production.[138] This rose to 920,000 US 
gallons (3,500,000 l; 770,000 imp gal) in 2009.[139] The state's share 
of the nation's production rose to 42% in 2013. It had the second lowest 
price at $33.40/gallon.[140] Wine industry in Vermont started in 1985. 
As of 2007 there were 14 wineries.[141] Vermont's largest private employer, 
GlobalFoundries, in the village of Essex Junction, Chittenden County, provides 
jobs to 3,000 employees.[142] A 2010 University of Connecticut study reported 
that Vermont, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire tied as the most costly states 
in the U.S. for manufacturers.[143] An increasingly aging population is 
expected to improve the position of aging services and health care in the 
state economy. In 2013, Fletcher Allen Health Care, with 7,100 employees, 
was the second-largest employer of people in the state and the largest 
private employer.[144] In 2010 all of Vermont's hospitals billed patients 
$3.76 billion, and collected $2 billion.[145] 92,000 people are enrolled 
in Medicare. In 2011, Medicare spent $740 million on health care in the 
state.[118] In 2007 Vermont was the 17th highest state in the nation for 
mortgage affordability. However, in 41 other states, inhabitants contributed 
within plus or minus 4% of Vermont's 18.4% of household income to a mortgage.[146] 
Housing prices did not rise much during the early 2000s. As a result, the 
collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either. While foreclosure 
rose significantly in 2007, the state stood 50th—the most favorable—in 
ratio of foreclosure filings to households.[147] While housing sales dropped 
annually from 2004 to 2008, prices continued to rise.[148] In 2007 Vermont 
was best in the country for construction of new energy efficient homes 
as evaluated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under 
the Energy Star program.[149] However, about 60% of Vermont homes were 
heated with oil in 2008.[150] In August 2008 the cost in Vermont of various 
heating sources per 1 million BTU ranged from $14.39 for cord wood to $43.50 
for kerosene. While the number of houses sold in the state has dropped 
from 8,318 in 2004 to 8,120 in 2005, 6,919 in 2006, and 5,820 in 2007, 
the average price has continued to rise to $202,500 in 2008 ($200,000 in 
2007).[151] In 2009 the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment was $920 
per month. Rental vacancy was 5.4%, the lowest in the nation. 2,800 people 
were counted as homeless in January 2010, 22% more than in 2008.[152] In 
2011 Vermont was fifth among the states with the greatest backlog of foreclosures 
needing court processing, taking an estimated 18 years. The national average 
was eight years.[153] As of 2006 there were 305,000 workers in Vermont. 
Eleven percent of these are unionized.[154][155] Out of a workforce of 
299,200 workers, 52,000 were government jobs, federal, state and local. 
[156] A modern high unemployment rate of 9% was reached in June 1976. A 
modern low of 2.4% was measured in February 2000.[157] As of September 
2010 the unemployment rate was 5.8%.[158] Employment grew 7.5% from 2000 
to 2006. From 1980 to 2000, employment grew by 3.4%; nationally it was 
up 4.6%. Real wages were $33,385 in 2006 constant dollars and remained 
there in 2010; the nation, $36,871.[159] Captive insurance plays an increasingly 
large role in Vermont's economy. With this form of alternative insurance, 
large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies 
to insure their own risks, thereby substantially reducing their insurance 
premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks 
to be covered. There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from 
the formation and operation of captive insurance companies. According to 
the Insurance Information Institute, Vermont in 2009 was the world's third-largest 
domicile for captive insurance companies, following Bermuda and the Cayman 
Islands.[160] In 2009 there were 560 such companies.[161] In 2010 the state 
had 900 such companies.[162] Tourism is an important industry to the state. 
Some of the largest ski areas in New England are located in Vermont. Skiers 
and snowboarders visit Burke Mountain Ski Area, Bolton Valley, Smugglers' 
Notch, Killington Ski Resort, Mad River Glen, Stowe Mountain Resort, Sugarbush, 
Stratton, Jay Peak, Okemo, Suicide Six, Mount Snow, Bromley, and Magic 
Mountain Ski Area. Summer visitors tour resort towns like Stowe, Manchester, 
Quechee, Wilmington and Woodstock. Resorts, hotels, restaurants, and shops, 
designed to attract tourists, employ people year-round. Summer camps contribute 
to Vermont's tourist economy. Visitors participate in trout fishing, lake 
fishing, and ice fishing. Some hike the Long Trail. In winter, Nordic and 
backcountry skiers visit to travel the length of the state on the Catamount 
Trail. Several horse shows are annual events. Vermont's state parks, historic 
sites, museums, golf courses, and new boutique hotels with spas were designed 
to attract tourists. According to the 2000 Census, almost 15% of all housing 
units in Vermont were vacant and classified "for seasonal, recreational, 
or occasional use".[163][clarification needed] This was the second highest 
percentage nationwide, after Maine. In some Vermont cities, vacation homes 
owned by wealthy residents of New England and New York City constitute 
the bulk of all housing stock. According to one estimate, as of 2009, 84% 
of all houses in Ludlow, Vermont, were owned by out-of-state residents.[164] 
Other notable vacation-home resorts include Manchester and Stowe. In 2005 
visitors made an estimated 13.4 million trips to the state, spending $1.57 
billion.[165] In 2012 fall accounted for $460 million of income, about 
one-quarter of all tourism.[166] In 2011 the state government earned $274 
million in taxes and fees from tourism. 89% of the money came from out-of-state 
visitors. Tourism supported over 26,000 jobs, 7.2% of total employment.[167] 
In 2000–01 there were 4,579,719 skier and snowboarder visits to the state. 
There were 4,125,082 visits in 2009–2010, a rise from recent years.[168] 
In 2008 there were 35,000 members of 138 snowmobiling clubs in Vermont. 
The combined association of clubs maintains 6,000 miles (9,700 km) of trail 
often over private lands. The industry is said to generate "hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of business."[169] Hunting is controlled for 
black bear, wild turkeys, deer, and moose.[170] There are 5,500 bears in 
the state. The goal is to keep the numbers between 4,500 and 6,000.[171] 
In 2010 there were about 141,000 deer in the state, which is in range of 
government goals. However, these are distributed unevenly and when in excess 
of 10–15 per square mile, negatively impact timber growth.[172] In 2012 
hunting of migratory birds was limited to October 13 to December 16. Waterfowl 
hunting is also controlled by federal law.[173] The towns of Rutland and 
Barre are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving 
in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest 
union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. 
The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East 
Dorset.[174] The granite industry attracted numerous skilled stonecutters 
in the late 19th century from Italy, Scotland, and Ireland. Barre is the 
location of the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest dimension stone granite 
quarry in the United States. Vermont is the largest producer of slate in 
the country. The highest quarrying revenues result from the production 
of dimension stone.[citation needed] The Rock of Ages Quarry in Barre is 
one of the leading exporters of granite in the country. The work of the 
sculptors of this corporation can be seen 3 miles (4.8 km) down the road 
at the Hope Cemetery, where there are gravestones and mausoleums.[citation 
needed] There were 2,682 non-profit organizations in Vermont in 2008, with 
$2.8 billion in revenue.[175] The state ranked ninth in the country for 
volunteerism for the period 2005–08. 35.6% of the population volunteered 
during this period. The national average was 26.4%.[176] Vermont's main 
mode of travel is by automobile. 5.7% of Vermont households did not own 
a car in 2008.[177] In 2012 there were 605,000 motor vehicles registered, 
nearly one car for every person in the state. This is similar to average 
car ownership nationwide.[178] In 2012 about half the carbon emissions 
in the state resulted from vehicles.[179] On average, 20–25 people die 
each year from drunk driving incidents; as well as 70–80 people in fatal 
car crashes in the state.[180] Motorists have the highest rate of insurance 
in the country, 93%, tied with Pennsylvania.[181] In 2010 Vermont owned 
2,840 miles (4,570 km) of highway. This was the third smallest quantity 
among the 50 states. 2.5% of the highways were listed as "congested," the 
5th lowest in the country. The highway fatality rate was 1 per 100,000,000 
miles (160,000,000 km), tenth lowest in the nation. The highways cost $28,669 
per 1 mile (1.6 km) to maintain, the 17th highest in the states. 34.4% 
of its bridges were rated deficient or obsolete, the 8th worst in the nation.[182] 
Individual communities and counties have public transit, but their breadth 
of coverage is frequently limited. Greyhound Lines services a number of 
small towns. Two Amtrak trains serve Vermont, the Vermonter[183] and the 
Ethan Allen Express.[184] In 2011 Amtrak evaluated the track used by the 
Ethan Allen Express between Rutland and Whitehall as the worst in the nation.[185] 
Trucks weighing less than 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg) can use Vermont's interstate 
highways. The limit for state roads is 99,000 pounds (45,000 kg). This 
means that vehicles too heavy for the turnpikes can legally only use secondary 
roads.[186][187] In 1968 Vermont outlawed the use of billboards for advertisement 
along its roads. It is one of four states in the US to have done this, 
along with Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska.[188][189] The state has 2,843 miles 
(4,575 km) of highways under its control.[190] A 2005–06 study ranked Vermont 
37th out of the states for "cost-effective road maintenance", a decline 
of thirteen places since 2004–05.[191] Federal data indicates that 16% 
of Vermont's 2,691 bridges had been rated structurally deficient by the 
state in 2006.[192] In 2007 Vermont had the sixth worst percentage of structurally 
deficient bridges in the country.[193] The state is served by Amtrak's 
Vermonter and Ethan Allen Express, the New England Central Railroad, the 
Vermont Railway, and the Green Mountain Railroad. The Ethan Allen Express 
serves Castleton and Rutland,[184] while the Vermonter serves St. Albans, 
Essex Junction, Waterbury, Montpelier, Randolph, White River Junction, 
Windsor, Bellows Falls, and Brattleboro.[183] Greyhound Lines stops at 
Bellows Falls, Brattleboro, Burlington, Montpelier, and White River Junction.[194] 
Megabus, as of November 2014, stops in Burlington and Montpelier.[195] 
Vermont Translines, an intercity bus company started by Premier Coach in 
2013 partnering with Greyhound and starting service on June 9, 2014, serves 
Milton, Colchester, Burlington, Middlebury, Brandon, Rutland, Wallingford, 
Manchester and Bennington on its Burlington to Albany line, and Rutland, 
Killington, Bridgewater, Woodstock, Queechee and White River Junction along 
the US Route 4 corridor.[196] The town of Bennington also has the weekday-operating 
Albany-Bennington Shuttle, an intercity bus operated by Yankee Trails World 
Travel.[197] Other transportation includes:[198] There is ferry service 
to New York State from Burlington, Charlotte, Grand Isle, and Shoreham. 
All but the Shoreham ferry are operated by the LCTC (Lake Champlain Transportation 
Company). Vermont is served by two commercial airports: Vermont statute[203] 
requires the Vermont secretary of state to designate newspapers that provide 
general coverage across the state as the "Newspapers of Record." On June 
30, 2010, the secretary of state designated the following newspapers for 
publishing administrative rule notices during the period of July 1, 2010 
through June 30, 2011:[204] Vermont hosts 93 radio broadcast stations. 
The top categories are talk/information (11), country (9) and classic rock 
(9). The top owner of radio broadcast stations is Vermont Public Radio 
(11 broadcast frequencies and 13 low-power, local transmitters).[205] Other 
companies had five or fewer stations. The state has 15 online radio stations.[206] 
Vermont hosts 10 high-power television broadcast stations, three of which 
are satellites of a primary station. Represented are the following networks 
and number of high-power transmitters, ABC (1), CBS (1), Fox (1), NBC (2), 
PBS (4), and RTV (1). In addition, it has 17 low-power television broadcast 
stations, which in several cases are satellites of the high-power stations. 
2008 peak demand in the state was 1,100 megawatts (MW).[207] In May 2009 
Vermont created the first state-wide renewable energy feed-in law.[208] 
In 2010 there were about 150 methane digesters in the nation, Vermont led 
the nation with six online.[209] While Vermont paid the lowest rates in 
New England for power in 2007, it is still ranked among the highest eleven 
states in the nation; that is, about 16% higher than the national average.[210] 
In 2009 the state paid the highest rates for energy (including heating) 
in the U.S. and had the worst affordability gap nationwide.[116] In 2009 
the state received one-third (400 MW)[207] of its power from Hydro-Québec 
and one-third from Vermont Yankee.[211] In total, the state got half its 
power from Canada and other states. It received 75% of the power it generated 
in the state from Vermont Yankee.[212] The state is part of the Northeast 
Power Coordinating Council for the distribution of electricity. The state's 
two largest electric utilities, Green Mountain Power Corporation and Central 
Vermont Public Service Corporation, together serve 80% of Vermont households.[116] 
The state has 78 hydropower dams. They generate 143 MW, about 12% of the 
state's total requirement.[207] Vermont experts estimate that the state 
has the capacity to ultimately generate from 134 to 175 megawatts of electricity 
from hydro power.[213] In 2006 the total summer generating capacity of 
Vermont was 1,117 megawatts.[214] In 2005, the inhabitants of the state 
used an average of 5,883 kilowatt-hours (21,180 MJ) of electricity per 
capita.[215] Another source says that each household consumed 7,100 kilowatt-hours 
(26,000 MJ) annually in 2008.[216] Until the Vermont Yankee nuclear power 
plant was shut down in 2014, Vermont had the highest rate of nuclear-generated 
power in the nation, 73.7%.[217] Vermont is one of two states with no coal-fired 
power plants.[218] All Vermont utilities get their power from lines run 
by ISO New England. Each utility pays a share of transmitting power over 
these lines. Vermont's share is about 4.5%.[219] A 2013 survey found that 
of 18,790 miles (30,240 km) of roads surveyed, all but 3,118 mi had cellular 
coverage by at least one carrier. The roads surveyed are concentrated in 
the more heavily populated areas.[220] A June 2013 survey found that of 
nearly 249,976 addresses surveyed, 84.7% had fixed (as opposed to mobile) 
broadband available. It was projected that all but 29 addresses would have 
fixed broadband available by the end of 2013.[221] Vermont is federally 
represented in the United States Congress by two senators and one representative. 
The state is governed by a constitution which divides governmental duties 
into legislative, executive and judicial branches: the Vermont General 
Assembly, the Governor of Vermont and the Vermont Supreme Court. The governorship 
and the General Assembly serve two-year terms including the governor and 
30 senators. There are no term limits for any office. The state capital 
is in Montpelier. There are three types of incorporated municipalities 
in Vermont: towns, cities, and villages. Like most of New England, there 
is slight provision for autonomous county government. Counties and county 
seats are merely convenient repositories for various government services 
such as state courts, with several elected officers such as a state's Attorney 
and sheriff. All county services are directly funded by the state of Vermont. 
The next effective governmental level below state government are municipalities. 
Most of these are towns.[222] Vermont is the only state in the union not 
to have a balanced budget requirement, yet Vermont has had a balanced budget 
every year since 1991.[223] In 2007 Moody's gave its top bond credit rating 
(Aaa) to the state.[224] The state uses enterprise funds for operations 
that are similar to private business enterprises. The Vermont Lottery Commission, 
the Liquor Control Fund, and the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, 
are the largest of the State's enterprise funds.[225] In 2007 Vermont was 
the 14th highest out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state 
and local taxation, with a per capita load of $3,681. The national average 
was $3,447.[226] However, CNNMoney ranked Vermont highest in the nation 
based on the percentage of per capita income. The rankings showed Vermont 
had a per capita tax load of $5,387, 14.1% of the per capita income of 
$38,306.[227] Vermont collects a state personal income tax in a progressive 
structure of five different income brackets, with marginal tax rates ranging 
from 3.6% to 9.5%. In 2008, the top 1% of Vermont residents provided 30% 
of the income tax revenue; around 2,000 people had sufficient income to 
be taxed at the highest marginal rate of 9.5%.[228] Vermont's general state 
sales tax rate is 6%, which is imposed on sales of tangible personal property, 
amusement charges, fabrication charges, some public utility charges and 
some service contracts. Some towns and cities impose an additional 1% Local 
Option Tax. There are 46 exemptions from the sales tax, including exemptions 
for food, medical items, manufacturing machinery, equipment and fuel, residential 
fuel and electricity, clothing, and shoes. A use tax is imposed on the 
buyer at the same rate as the sales tax. The buyer pays the use tax when 
the seller fails to collect the sales tax or the items are purchased from 
a source where no tax is collected. The use tax applies to items taxable 
under the sales tax. Vermont does not collect inheritance taxes, but does 
impose a state estate tax; a Vermont estate tax return must be filed if 
the estate must file a federal estate tax return (the requirement for which 
depends on federal law).[229] Vermont does not collect a state gift tax.[229] 
Property taxes are levied by municipalities for the support of education 
and municipal services. Vermont does not assess tax on personal property.[230] 
Property taxes are based on appraisal of the fair market value of real 
property.[230] Rates vary from 0.97% on homesteaded property in Ferdinand, 
Essex County, to 2.72% on nonresidents' property in Barre City.[231] Statewide, 
towns average 1.77% to 1.82% tax rate. In 2007, Vermont counties were among 
the highest in the country for property taxes. Chittenden ($3,809 median), 
Windham ($3,412), Addison ($3,352), and Windsor ($3,327) ranked in the 
top 100, out of 1,817 counties in the nation with populations greater than 
20,000. Twelve of the state's 14 counties stood in the top 20%.[232] Median 
annual property taxes as a percentage of median homeowners income, 5.4%, 
was rated as the third highest in the nation in 2011.[233][234] To equitably 
support education, some towns are required by Act 60 to send some of their 
collected taxes to be redistributed to school districts lacking adequate 
support.[235] Vermonters have been known for their political independence. 
Vermont is one of four states (aside from the original Thirteen Colonies) 
that were once independent nations (the others being Texas, California, 
and Hawaii). It has sometimes voted contrarian in national elections. Notably, 
Vermont is the only state to have voted for a presidential candidate from 
the Anti-Masonic Party, and Vermont was one of only two states to vote 
against Franklin D. Roosevelt in all four of his presidential campaigns 
(the other was Maine). Vermont's history of independent political thought 
has led to movements for the establishment of the Second Vermont Republic 
and other plans advocating secession.[236] Republicans dominated local 
Vermont politics from the party's founding in 1854 until the mid-1970s. 
Before the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, 
cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were 
neglected and fell into decay. People began to move out to newer suburbs. 
Vermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party. Ethno-political 
culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout 
in the Green Mountain State. Americans of French descent overwhelmingly 
vote Democratic, and are the largest ethnicity in Vermont. Vermonters of 
English descent (sometimes known as the "Yankee" Vermonters) overwhelmingly 
vote Republican. Americans of English descent make up between a fifth and 
a quarter of the state and Americans of French descent make roughly one 
third of the state. All other ethnicities in the state break down roughly 
50–50 along political lines, however the predominance of French-Canadian 
descended Vermonters who vote Democratic the overwhelming majority of the 
time has led to a dwindling of the "Yankee Republicanism" for which Vermont 
was once synonymous. The Irish Catholic vote has fluctuated during this 
time, while the French-Canadian vote has remained solidly Democratic and 
the vote of the "Yankee" Vermonters of English descent has remained solidly 
Republican. Since 1992, Vermont has voted for the Democrat in every Presidential 
election. Before 1992, Vermont voted for the Republican in every single 
Presidential election with the exception of 1964.[237][238][239][240] A 
series of one man, one vote decisions made by the United States Supreme 
Court in the 1960s required states to redraw their legislative districts 
to more fairly reflect population. As a result, urban areas in Vermont 
gained political power. After the legislature was redistricted under one-person, 
one-vote in the 1960s, it passed legislation to accommodate[clarification 
needed] the new arrivals to the state. This legislation was the Land Use 
and Development Law (Act 250) in 1970. The law, which was the first of 
its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions 
consisting of private citizens, appointed by the Governor, who must approve 
land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact 
on the state's environment and many small communities. As a result of Act 
250, Vermont was the last state to get a Wal-Mart (there are now five Wal-Marts 
in the state, as of December 2013, but only two – in Williston and St. 
Albans – were newly built from the ground up). Because of the successful 
attempts to dilute what is perceived as the original intent of Act 250,[241] 
and other development pressures, Vermont has been designated one of America's 
most "endangered historic places" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[242] 
In 1995 the state banned the spreading of manure from 15 December to 1 
April, to prevent runoff and protect the water. Therefore farms must have 
environmentally approved facilities to store manure during this time frame.[243] 
While the state voted largely Democratic, Republican Governor Douglas won 
all counties but Windham in the 2006 election. A controversy dating from 
1999 has been over the adoption of civil unions, an institution which grants 
same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the 
state, but not federal, level. In Baker v. Vermont (1999), the Vermont 
Supreme Court ruled that, under the Constitution of Vermont, the state 
must either allow same-sex marriage or provide a separate but equal status 
for them. The state legislature chose the second option by creating the 
institution of civil union; the bill was passed by the legislature and 
signed into law by Governor Howard Dean. In April 2009 the state legislature 
overrode governor Jim Douglas's veto to allow same-sex marriage, becoming 
the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation.[244] 
In September 2009 Vermont became the fourth state in which same-sex couples 
could marry.[245] In 2007 the state's House of Representatives rejected 
a measure which would have legalized assisted suicide for the terminally 
ill, by a vote of 82–63.[246] Then with the governor's signature on May 
20, 2013, Vermont became the fourth state to pass a "death with dignity" 
law—the first to be passed through legislation rather than by ballot initiative.[247] 
Minor parties and Independents flourish. Rules which eliminate smaller 
parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont. As a result, 
voters often have extensive choices for general elections. Among others, 
this more open policy enabled independents like Bernie Sanders to win election 
as mayor of Burlington, U.S. Congressman and U.S. Senator. A political 
issue has been Act 60, which balances taxation for education funding. This 
has resulted in the town of Killington trying to secede from Vermont and 
join New Hampshire due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden.[248][249] 
The Vermont constitution and the courts supports the right of a person 
to walk (fish and hunt) on any unposted, unfenced land. That is, trespass 
must be proven by the owner; it is not automatically assumed.[250] The 
state is an alcoholic beverage control state. In 2007, through the Vermont 
Department of Liquor Control, it took in over $14 million from the sale 
and distribution of liquor.[251] In 2013 Vermont became the 17th state 
to decriminalize marijuana. The statute makes possession of less than an 
ounce of the drug punishable by a small fine rather than arrest and possible 
jail time.[252] In 2014 Vermont became the first state to call for a constitutional 
convention to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United 
v. FEC.[253] In 2014 Vermont became the first state to mandate labeling 
of genetically modified organisms in the retail food supply. Historically, 
Vermont was considered one of the most reliably Republican states in the 
country in terms of national elections. From 1856 to 1988, Vermont voted 
Democratic only once, in Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory of 1964 
against Barry M. Goldwater. It was also one of only two states—the other 
being Maine—where Franklin D. Roosevelt was completely shut out in all 
four of his presidential bids. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
Republican presidential candidates frequently won the state with over 70% 
of the vote. In the 1980s and 1990s many people moved in from out of state.[85][89][254] 
Much of this immigration included the arrival of more liberal political 
influences of the urban areas of New York and the rest of New England in 
Vermont.[89] The brand of Republicanism in Vermont has historically been 
a moderate one, and combined with the newcomers from out of state, this 
made Vermont friendlier to Democrats as the national GOP moved to the right. 
As evidence of this, in 1990 Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic 
socialist, was elected to Vermont's lone seat in the House as an independent. 
Sanders became the state's junior Senator in 2007. However, for his entire 
career in the House and Senate, Sanders has caucused with the Democrats 
and is counted as a Democrat for the purposes of committee assignments 
and voting for party leadership.[255] After narrowly supporting George 
H. W. Bush in 1988, it gave Democrat Bill Clinton a 16-point margin in 
1992—the first time the state had gone Democratic since 1964. Vermont has 
voted Democratic in every presidential election since. Since 2004, Vermont 
has been one of the Democrats' most loyal states. It gave John Kerry his 
fourth-largest margin of victory in the presidential campaign against George 
W. Bush; he won the state's popular vote by 20 percentage points, taking 
almost 59% of the vote. (Kerry, from neighboring Massachusetts, also became 
the first Northern Democrat ever to carry Vermont; Johnson was from Texas, 
Clinton from Arkansas and Al Gore, triumphant in the Green Mountain State 
in 2000, from Tennessee.) Essex County in the state's northeastern section 
was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont is the only state that did 
not receive a visit from George W. Bush during his tenure as President 
of the United States.[256] Indeed, George W. Bush and Donald Trump are 
the only Republicans to win the White House without carrying Vermont. In 
2008, Vermont gave Barack Obama his third-largest margin of victory (37 
percentage points) and third-largest vote share in the nation by his winning 
the state 68% to 31%. Only Obama's birth state of Hawaii and Washington, 
D.C. were stronger Democratic victories. The same held true in 2012, when 
Obama carried Vermont 67% of the vote vs 31% for Romney, and in 2016, when 
Clinton won with 55.7% of the vote vs 29.8% for Trump. Vermont's two Senators 
are Democrat Patrick Leahy, the longest-serving member of the Senate, and 
independent Bernie Sanders. The state is represented by an at-large member 
of the House, Democrat Peter Welch, who succeeded Sanders in 2007. In 2010 
Vermont was the sixth highest ranked state for Well-Being in a study by 
Gallup and Healthways.[257] In 2010 the state stood third in physical well-being 
of children.[258] In 2010 Vermont was ranked the highest in the country 
for health outcomes.[259] In 2000 the state implemented the Vermont Child 
Health Improvement Program to improve preventive services and management 
of chronic conditions. In 2011, the state ranked third in the nation in 
child health system performance.[260] In 2011, the March of Dimes gave 
Vermont an "A," ranking it number one in the country on its Prematurity 
Report Card.[261] In 2008 Vermont was ranked number one in the nation as 
the healthiest place to live for the seventh time in eight years. Criteria 
included low teenage birth rate, strong health coverage, the lowest AIDS 
rate in the country, and 18 other factors.[262] The state scored well in 
cessation of smoking, obesity, fewer occupational fatalities, prevalence 
of health insurance, and low infant mortality. A problem area was a high 
prevalence of binge drinking.[263] While ranking sixth from best for adults 
in obesity in 2009, the state still had 22% obese with a rate of 27% for 
children 10–17. The ranking for children was ninth best in the nation.[264] 
In 1993, the obesity rate for adults was 12%. Vermonters spend $141 million 
annually in medical costs related to obesity.[265] The combined figures 
for overweight and obese adults rose from 40.7% in 1990 to 58.4% in 2010. 
This is better than most other states.[266] In 2011 Vermont led the nation 
in the rate of young people who had consumed alcohol in the past month; 
one-third of people aged 11 through 20. One-fifth of that group had binged 
during that time. The state was second for the use of marijuana by young 
people; 30% of adults 18 to 25 in the past month.[267] In 2009 Vermont 
was ranked second in the nation for safety. Crime statistics on violence 
were used for the criteria.[268] Vermont has some of the least restrictive 
gun control laws in the country. A permit or license is not required for 
purchasing or carrying firearms. concealed carry and open carry of a firearm 
is legal over the age of 16, with those below 16 requiring parental permission.[269][270][271][272] 
In 2007 Vermont was ranked among the best five states in the country for 
preventing "premature death" in people under 75 years of age. The rate 
of survival was twice that of the five lowest performing states.[273] In 
2007 Vermont was ranked the third safest state for highway fatalities.[274] 
In 2007 a third of fatal crashes involved a drunken driver.[275] In 2008, 
Vermont was the fifth best state for fewest uninsured motorists – 6%.[276] 
Parts of the state have been declared federal disaster areas on 28 occasions 
from 1963 to 2008.[277] In 2007 the Environmental Protection Agency cited 
Chittenden and Bennington as counties with 70 parts per billion of smog 
which is undesirable.[278] In northern Vermont particularly, moose are 
not uncommon, including in urban areas.[279] They constitute a traffic 
threat since they are unaware of vehicles. There are several deaths each 
year from automobiles striking moose. In 2008 about 100,000 Vermonters 
got their health care through the federal government, Medicare, Tri-Care 
and the Veteran's Administration. An additional 10,000 work for employers 
who provide insurance under federal law under ERISA. About 20% of Vermonters 
receive health care outside of Vermont; 20% of the care provided within 
the state is to non-Vermonters.[280] In 2008 the state had an estimated 
7.6% with no medical insurance, down from 9.8% in 2005.[281] In 2008 the 
Vermont Health Access Program for low-income, uninsured adults cost from 
$7 to $49 per month.[282] A "Catamount Health" premium assistance program 
was available for Vermonters who do not qualify for other programs. Total 
monthly premiums ranged from $60 to $393 for an individual. There was a 
$250 deductible. Insured paid $10 toward each generic prescription. 16.9% 
of residents 18 to 35 were uninsured, the highest group.[283] Health care 
spending increased from $2.3 billion in 2000 to $4.8 billion in 2009.[284] 
In 2009, adult day care services cost more in Vermont than any other state 
– $150 daily.[285] The state started air drops of rabies bait for raccoons 
in 1997. Known rabies cases in raccoons peaked in 2007 at 165. The program 
is in cooperation with neighboring states and Canada.[286] Vermont was 
named the nation's smartest state in 2005 and 2006.[287] In 2006 there 
was a gap between state testing standards and national, which is biased 
in favor of the state standards by 30%, on average. This puts Vermont 11th-best 
in the nation. Most states have a higher bias.[288] However, when allowance 
for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores shows 
Vermont white fourth graders performed 25th in the nation for reading (229), 
26th for math (247).[289] White eighth graders scored 18th for math (292) 
and 12th for reading (273). The first three scores were not considered 
statistically different from average. White eighth graders scored significantly 
above average in reading. Statistics for black students were not reliable 
because of their small representation in the testing. The average effective 
spending per pupil in Vermont was $11,548 in 2008.[290] Education Week 
ranked the state second[291] in high school graduation rates for 2007.[292] 
In 2011, 91% of the population had graduated from high school compared 
with 85% nationally. Almost 34% have at least an undergraduate degree compared 
with 28% nationally.[293] In 2013 the ratio of pupils to teachers was the 
lowest in the country.[294] Experimentation at the University of Vermont 
by George Perkins Marsh, and later the influence of Vermont-born philosopher 
and educator John Dewey brought about the concepts of electives and learning 
by doing. Vermont has five colleges within the Vermont State Colleges system, 
University of Vermont (UVM), and fourteen other private, degree-granting 
colleges, including Bennington College, Burlington College, Champlain College, 
Goddard College, Marlboro College, Middlebury College, Saint Michael's 
College, the Vermont Law School, and Norwich University. Winter sports 
are popular in New England, and Vermont's winter sports attractions are 
a big part of Vermont tourism. Some well known attractions include, Burke 
Mountain Ski Area, Jay Peak Resort, Killington Ski Resort, The Quechee 
Club Ski Area, and Smugglers' Notch Resort. Vermont natives in the snowboarding 
profession include: Kevin Pearce, Ross Powers, Hannah Teter, and Kelly 
Clark. Others learned snowboarding in the state such as: Louie Vito, and 
Ellery Hollingsworth. Vermont Olympic gold medalists include Barbara Cochran,[295] 
Hannah Kearney,[296] Kelly Clark,[297] Ross Powers,[298] and Hannah Teter.[299] 
The largest professional franchise is the Vermont Lake Monsters, a single-A 
minor league baseball affiliate of the Oakland Athletics, based in Burlington. 
They were named the Vermont Expos before 2006.[300] Up until the 2011 season, 
they were the affiliate of the Washington Nationals (formerly the Montreal 
Expos). Currently the highest teams in basketball, representing Vermont 
are the NCAA's Vermont Catamounts – male and female.[301] The Vermont Frost 
Heaves, the 2007 and 2008 American Basketball Association national champions, 
were a franchise of the Premier Basketball League, and were based in Barre 
and Burlington from the fall of 2006 through the winter of 2011. The Vermont 
Ice Storm, a semi-professional football team, is based in South Hero.[302][303] 
It plays its home games at the Colchester High School stadium. It is a 
member of the Empire Football League. The Vermont Voltage is a USL Premier 
Development League soccer club that plays in St. Albans. Annually since 
2002, high school statewide all stars compete against New Hampshire in 
ten sports during "Twin State" playoffs.[304] Vermont also has a few auto 
racing venues. The most popular of them is Thunder Road International Speedbowl 
in Barre, Vermont. It is well known for its tight racing and has become 
well known in short track stock car racing. Other racing circuits include 
the USAC sanctioned Bear Ridge Speedway, and the NASCAR sanctioned Devil's 
Bowl Speedway. Some NASCAR Cup drivers have come to Vermont circuits to 
compete against local weekly drivers such as Tony Stewart, Clint Bowyer, 
Kevin Harvick, Kenny Wallace, and Joe Nemechek. Kevin Lepage from Shelburne, 
Vermont is one of a few professional drivers from Vermont. Racing series 
in Vermont include NASCAR Whelen All-American Series, American Canadian 
Tour, and Vermont's own Tiger Sportsman Series. Vermont festivals include 
the Vermont Maple Festival, Festival on the Green,[305] The Vermont Dairy 
Festival in Enosburg Falls,[306] the Apple Festival (held each Columbus 
Day Weekend), the Marlboro Music Festival, and the Vermont Brewers Festival.[307] 
The Vermont Symphony Orchestra is supported by the state and performs throughout 
the area. Since 1973 the Sage City Symphony, formed by composer Louis Calabro, 
has performed in the Bennington area. In 1988 a number of Vermont-based 
composers including Gwyneth Walker formed the Vermont Composers Consortium,[308][309] 
which was recognized by the governor proclaiming 2011 as The Year of the 
Composer.[310] The Brattleboro-based Vermont Theatre Company presents an 
annual summer Shakespeare festival. Brattleboro also hosts the summertime 
Strolling of the Heifers parade which celebrates Vermont's unique dairy 
culture. The annual Green Mountain Film Festival is held in Montpelier. 
In the Northeast Kingdom, the Bread and Puppet Theatre holds weekly shows 
in Glover in a natural outdoor amphitheater. Vermont's most recent best 
known musical talent was the group Phish, whose members met while attending 
school in Vermont and spent much of their early years playing at venues 
across the state. The Vermont-based House of LeMay[311] performs several 
shows a year, hosts the annual "Winter is a Drag Ball,"[312] and performs 
for fundraisers. Examples of folk art found in Vermont include the Vermontasaurus 
in Post Mills, a community in Thetford. The rate of volunteerism in Vermont 
was eighth in the nation with 37% in 2007. The state stood first in New 
England.[313] In 2011 Vermont residents were ranked as the healthiest in 
the country.[314] Also in 2011, Vermont was ranked as the fourth most peaceful 
state in the United States.[315] In 2011 Vermont residents were ranked 
as the sixth most fit/leanest in the country.[316] Vermonters were the 
second most active citizens of state with 55.9% meeting the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention's physical activity requirements.[317] Vermont 
was ranked as the 12th happiest state in the country.[318] There are a 
number of museums in the state. State symbols include: Vermont is the birthplace 
of former U.S. Presidents Chester A. Arthur and Calvin Coolidge. The following
