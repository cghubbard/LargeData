The 2010 Pittsburgh Pirates season was the 129th season of the franchise; 
the 124th in the National League. The 2010 season was the Pirates' MLB-record 
18th consecutive losing season. (This is also the longest for any major 
professional North American sport). The Pirates finished sixth and last 
in the National League Central with a record of 57–105. The Pirates used 
the off-season to pick up bullpen help, signing relievers Javier López, 
Brendan Donnelly and former closer Octavio Dotel to one-year contracts. 
They also added a shortstop, Bobby Crosby and re-signed shortstop Ronny 
Cedeño. The Pirates were intent on not having a losing season for the 18th 
straight year, though it happened. Infielders Outfielders Coaches 2010
