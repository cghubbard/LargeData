Tim Donaghy (/ˈdɒnəɡi/;[2] born January 7, 1967)[3] is a former professional 
basketball referee who worked in the National Basketball Association (NBA) 
for 13 seasons from 1994 to 2007.[4] During his career in the NBA, Donaghy 
officiated in 772 regular season games and 20 playoff games.[4] Donaghy 
resigned from the league on July 9, 2007[5] before reports of an investigation 
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for allegations that he bet 
on games that he officiated during his last two seasons and that he made 
calls affecting the point spread in those games.[6] On August 15, 2007, 
Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. 
However, he could face more charges at the state level if it is determined 
that he deliberately miscalled individual games. Donaghy was sentenced 
to 15 months in federal prison on July 29, 2008.[7] He served 11 months 
in a federal prison camp in Pensacola, Florida to spend the remainder of 
his sentence in a halfway house,[8][9] but was sent back to prison in August 
for violating his release terms. He was released on November 4, 2009 after 
serving out his sentence. Born in the Philadelphia suburb Havertown, Pennsylvania, 
Donaghy attended Cardinal O'Hara High School in Springfield, Pennsylvania[4] 
along with three other NBA referees: Joe Crawford, Mike Callahan, and Ed 
Malloy.[10] In 1989, Donaghy graduated from Villanova University with a 
degree in sales and marketing.[4][8] While at Villanova, he played on the 
school's baseball team.[1][4] According to the National Basketball Referee's 
Association, Donaghy participated and earned All-Catholic and All-Delaware 
County honors in baseball and All-Delaware County honors in basketball 
during high school,[3] but then–Villanova baseball coach George Bennett 
contends that Donaghy did not play on the varsity team and that no records 
indicate that he was selected to the All-Catholic team in baseball or named 
to the All-Delaware County basketball team.[11] Donaghy and his wife Kimberly 
had four daughters before terminating their 12-year marriage in 2007.[12] 
Before officiating in the NBA, Donaghy spent five years in prison Pennsylvania 
[3] and seven seasons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), 
and he was the head official for the 1993 CBA All-Star Game.[13] The following 
year, he joined the NBA, where he worked for 13 years, officiating in 772 
regular-season games and 20 playoff games.[4] Donaghy was a participant 
in the NBA's Read to Achieve program, for which he participated in an event 
at the Universal Charter school during the 2002 NBA Finals.[4] His uniform 
number was 21.[3] Donaghy was one of three referees who worked the Pacers–Pistons 
brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004, which ended in 
a fight between Pacers players and Pistons fans.[14][15][16] Donaghy was 
involved in another controversial incident in 2003, when he called a technical 
foul on Rasheed Wallace, then playing with the Portland Trail Blazers, 
for allegedly throwing a ball at another official during a game played 
at the Rose Garden Arena in Portland, Oregon.[17] While Donaghy was leaving 
the arena, Wallace confronted him at the arena's loading dock, where he 
screamed obscenities at Donaghy.[17] Donaghy claimed that Wallace threatened 
him, and after an investigation by the NBA, Wallace was suspended for seven 
games;[17] this was the longest suspension issued by the league for an 
incident not involving violence or drugs.[18] On July 20, 2007, columnist 
Murray Weiss of the New York Post reported an investigation by the FBI 
into allegations of an NBA referee betting on games to control the point 
spread.[19] It was revealed that Donaghy, who has a gambling problem, placed 
tens of thousands of dollars in bets on games during the 2005–06 and 2006–07 
season and had been approached by low-level mob associates to work on a 
gambling scheme.[20] Mike Missanelli of The Stephen A. Smith Show suggested 
that Donaghy had gotten himself into debt and tried to make it up by betting 
on games.[21] The report sent shock waves through the NBA. While the league 
devotes significant resources to monitor officials' performance, it only 
found out about the affair when the FBI stumbled upon Donaghy in the midst 
of a broader organized crime investigation.[22] NBA Commissioner David 
Stern said in a statement, "We would like to assure our fans that no amount 
of effort, time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation, 
to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust 
in professional sports, and to take the necessary steps to protect against 
this ever happening again."[20] He called the scandal a "wakeup call that 
says you can't be complacent".[23] Sports gambling expert R. J. Bell, president 
of sports betting information site Pregame.com, tracked every game Donaghy 
worked from 2003 to 2007. He discovered that during the two seasons investigated 
by the NBA, the teams involved scored more points than expected by the 
Las Vegas sports books 57% of the time. In the previous two seasons, this 
only happened 44% of the time. According to Bell, the odds of such a discrepancy 
are 1 in 1,000, and there was "a 99.9% chance that these results would 
not have happened without an outside factor". He also found 10 straight 
games in 2007 in which Donaghy worked the game that the point spread moved 
1.5 points or more before the tip—an indication that big money had been 
wagered on the game. The big money won every time—another indication that 
"something (was) going on". However, Bell suggested that there was no way 
anyone who wasn't in on the fix could have known that something was amiss 
about Donaghy's actions during a game; he said it would have been another 
year at the earliest before anyone could have caught on.[24] Handicapper 
Brandon Lang told ESPN that it is fairly easy for a crooked sports official 
to fix a game, despite Stern's insistence that Donaghy was a "rogue official". 
According to Lang, an official can directly influence the outcome of a 
game 75% of the time if he has money on the game. Lang also believed that 
a bookie connected to the mob turned Donaghy in to the FBI.[25] On July 
27, U.S. Congressman Bobby Rush of Illinois, chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, asked to 
meet with Stern regarding the Donaghy matter. In a letter to Stern, Rush 
indicated that he might call a hearing "should the facts warrant public 
scrutiny." He also said that the affair could potentially be "one of the 
most damaging scandals in the history of American sports".[26] Earlier 
in the day, federal sources told the New York Daily News that Donaghy would 
surrender to the FBI and pleaded guilty to gambling charges. The Daily 
News also learned that the bookies in the scandal were two high school 
classmates of Donaghy's who embellished their mob ties. The Daily News 
reported that at his friends' request, Donaghy passed word about the crews 
working the games they planned to bet on.[27] The Associated Press identified 
one of the men as James Battista, former owner of a sports bar in Havertown, 
Pennsylvania; a Philadelphia suburb. Battista's lawyer told the AP that 
his client expected to be indicted.[28] At his home in Bradenton, Donaghy 
did not initially comment on his situation. He reportedly claimed to be 
"the butler" to visiting reporters and turned his sprinklers on a freelance 
photographer for the New York Times when he got too close.[27] His wife 
(at the time), Kimberly, passed a note to reporters telling them not to 
bother asking them any questions.[29] On August 15, Donaghy appeared in 
a Brooklyn federal court and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to engage in 
wire fraud and transmitting wagering information through interstate commerce. 
Donaghy told U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon that he used coded language 
to tip Battista about players' physical condition and player/referee relations. 
In doing so, Donaghy disclosed classified information that he obtained 
as an NBA referee. Donaghy initially received $2,000 per correct pick, 
but his calls were so accurate that Battista increased his take to $5,000. 
In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies.[30] 
Another high school friend of Donaghy's, Thomas Martino, acted as the middle 
man. Donaghy also admitted that he had a severe gambling addiction, for 
which he was taking antidepressants.[31] Donaghy specifically admitted 
to passing information about two games during the 2006–07 season. Prosecutors 
also said that Donaghy bet on games himself. Donaghy was fined $500,000, 
and will also have to pay at least $30,000 in restitution.[32] ESPN legal 
analyst Lester Munson believes that Battista is one of the FBI's prime 
targets, based on the large amounts of money he bet.[33] Donaghy was released 
on a $250,000 bond and awaited sentencing on January 25, 2008.[34] On June 
19, 2008, the NBA filed a demand that Donaghy reimburse the league for 
the costs of his airfare and meals, complimentary game tickets, and other 
expenses, including $750 in shoes. Donaghy's lawyer said that this was 
the league trying to retaliate against Donaghy for his misconduct.[35] 
A judge delayed sentencing to allow for more time to decide how much restitution 
Donaghy and two co-conspirators should pay the NBA for their roles in the 
betting scandal. The NBA has claimed Donaghy owes it $1.4 million, including 
$577,000 of his pay and benefits over four seasons, plus hefty legal fees 
and other expenses related to an internal investigation. His lawyer has 
argued that the punishment should apply to only one season—a position supported 
by the government in court papers.[36] According to the Associated Press, 
Andrew Thomas, the former county attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona, 
asked the NBA and FBI if Donaghy intentionally miscalled two Phoenix Suns 
road playoff games. The games in question occurred on April 29, 2007 versus 
the Los Angeles Lakers and May 12, 2007 versus the San Antonio Spurs. In 
a letter to Stern and FBI director Robert Mueller, Thomas said that Donaghy's 
conduct may have violated Arizona criminal law, and could face charges 
there.[37] Per the United States Supreme Court's decision in Ponzi v. Fessenden, 
federal plea bargains have no standing regarding state charges.[38] On 
June 10, 2008, Donaghy's attorney filed a court document alleging, among 
other things, that Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between 
the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings was fixed by two referees. 
The letter states that Donaghy "learned from Referee A that Referees A 
and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and 
F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that 
night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series."[39] 
The Lakers won Game 6, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in 
the fourth quarter, and went on to win the 2002 NBA Finals. The teams were 
not named, but the Western Conference Finals was the only seven-game series 
that year.[40] The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that 
to increase television ratings and ticket sales, "top executives of the 
NBA sought to manipulate games using referees".[39] It also said that NBA 
officials would tell referees to not call technical fouls on certain players, 
and states that a referee was privately reprimanded by the league for ejecting 
a star player in the first quarter of a January 2000 game.[39] Stern denied 
the accusations, calling Donaghy a "singing, cooperating witness".[40] 
On July 29, 2008, Donaghy was sentenced in the United States District Court 
for the Eastern District of New York[41] to 15 months in prison for his 
participation in the gambling scandal. Donaghy could have faced up to 33 
months, but Judge Carol Amon reduced his sentence to 15 months (two 15-month 
terms served concurrently, followed by 3 years of supervised release) in 
exchange for his cooperation. His lawyer, John Lauro, asked for probation, 
but the request was denied. Donaghy apologized in court, saying "I brought 
shame on myself, my family and the profession."[7] Battista and Martino 
were sentenced earlier that month, earning sentences of 15 months and 366 
days, respectively.[42] As a result of the betting scandal, Stern revised 
the guidelines on the behavior of NBA referees during the Board of Governors' 
meeting in 2007. Despite the labor agreement for referees, which restricted 
them from participating in almost all forms of gambling, it was revealed 
that about half of the NBA's officials had made bets in casinos, albeit 
not with sportsbooks. In addition, all referees had admitted to engaging 
in some form of gambling. Stern stated that "[the] ban on gambling is absolute, 
and in my view it is too absolute, too harsh and was not particularly well-enforced 
over the years". The gambling rules were revised to allow referees to engage 
in several forms of betting—though not on sports. There were several other 
referee-related rule changes made: the announcement of referees of a game 
was moved from 90 minutes before tip-off to the morning of the game, to 
reduce the value of the information to gamblers; referees received more 
in-season training and counseling on gambling; more thorough background 
checks were carried out; the league declared its intention to analyze the 
statistical relationship between NBA games and referees' gambling patterns 
for those games; and the interactions between referees and NBA teams were 
made easier and more formal.[43] In the federal prison camp in Pensacola, 
Florida, Donaghy started to write his memoir, Blowing the Whistle: The 
Culture of Fraud in the NBA. The book was to have covered his NBA career, 
described his dealings with the "underworld" during the betting scandal, 
and explained how he would determine the winning team in the games he refereed. 
Donaghy also promised to "discuss the relationship that players, coaches 
and referees have with each other".[8] The book was due to be published 
in October 2009. However, Donaghy's publisher, Triumph Books, canceled 
it because of liability concerns. Pat Berdan, Donaghy's liaison with Triumph, 
said the book was canceled after the NBA threatened legal action—which 
the NBA denies.[44] Donaghy found a new publisher, VTi-Group, willing to 
release the book, which was renamed Personal Foul: A First-Person Account 
of the Scandal That Rocked the NBA. The book was released in December 2009.[45][46] 
During his imprisonment, Donaghy was attacked and threatened. In November 
2007, a man claiming to be an associate of the New York Mafia struck Donaghy 
with a paint roller extension bar, resulting in injuries to his knee and 
leg which required surgery.[8][9] Donaghy was released from prison after 
serving 11 months and was due to finish his sentence in a recovery house 
near Tampa, Florida, where he will be treated for his gambling addiction 
as mandated by the court.[8][9] He was arrested and put in the county jail 
in late August after being caught at a health club without permission, 
when he should have been at work. His lawyer and his ex-wife both insisted 
that Donaghy should not have been taken into custody, as he was allowed 
to visit the center to rehabilitate his injured knee.[47][48] On November 
4, 2009, Donaghy was released from prison in Hernando County after serving 
out the remainder of his sentence.[49] Donaghy sued VTi-Group, the publisher 
of his memoir, for not paying him. In June 2012, a jury found VTi liable 
for breach of contract.[50] Donaghy was awarded $1.3 million. On April 
22, 2014, Donaghy claimed that the league office was going to push referees 
to fix playoffs games to have Brooklyn Nets beat the Toronto Raptors, so 
they could advance to the second round and face the Miami Heat because 
it would be good for ratings,[51] which it was.[52] On May 4, 2014, the 
Nets eliminated the Raptors after winning game seven of the series by a
