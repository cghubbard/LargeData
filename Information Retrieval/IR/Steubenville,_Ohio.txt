Steubenville is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Ohio, 
United States.[2] Located along the Ohio River, it had a population of 
18,659 at the 2010 census. The city's name is derived from Fort Steuben, 
a 1786 fort that sat within the city's current limits and was named for 
German-Prussian military officer Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. Today, 
a replica of the fort is open to the public.[8] Steubenville is known as 
the "City of Murals", after its more than 25 downtown murals.[1] It is 
home to Franciscan University of Steubenville and Eastern Gateway Community 
College (formerly Jefferson Community College).[9] In 1786-87, the soldiers 
of the 1st American Regiment built Fort Steuben to protect the government 
surveyors mapping the land west of the Ohio River, and named the fort in 
honor of Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. When the surveyors completed 
their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, 
settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. 
The name Steubenville was derived from Fort Steuben to honor Baron von 
Steuben (the fort was named for the Baron). The town was sometimes referred 
to as La Belle City, a franglais interpretation of "The Beautiful City."[10] 
On July 29, 1797, Jefferson County was organized by a proclamation of Governor 
Arthur St. Clair, and Steubenville was selected as the County seat and 
was platted in the same year by Bezaliel (Bezaleel) Wells and James Ross, 
the city's co-founders. Wells, a government surveyor born in Baltimore, 
received about 1,000 acres (4 km2) of land west of the Ohio River; Ross, 
a lawyer from Pittsburgh, owned land north of his.[10] On March 1, 1803, 
Ohio was admitted to the Union as the 17th state.[11] During the first 
half of the nineteenth century, Steubenville was primarily a port town, 
and the rest of the county was small villages and farms. Steubenville received 
a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a 
rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal 
and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the Pittsburgh, 
Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad, which connected Pittsburgh 
to Chicago and St. Louis. In 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded 
by the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular.[12] In 1980, its name 
was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to Franciscan 
University of Steubenville.[13] In 1966, the Jefferson County Technical 
Institute was founded. In 1977, its name was changed to Jefferson Technical 
College. In 1995, it became a community college and was renamed Jefferson 
Community College. In 2009, the college expanded its service district by 
three Ohio counties, and was renamed again: Eastern Gateway Community College.

west from the floodplains to the hills that surround the city. It lies 
within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[15] The city's population 
peaked in 1940 and has been in continuous decline since. The 2010 census 
found 18,659 residents, down 1.8 percent from the 2000 census, while the 
2011 estimate put the population at 18,440, a drop of another 1.2 percent

The proportion of the population that is white remained at 79.5 percent, 
while the Hispanic proportion more than doubled to 2.4 percent as the black 
population dropped to 15.9 percent.[21] From 1980 to 2000, census figures 
show that the Weirton–Steubenville population decreased faster than any 
other urban area in the United States.[22] Steubenville is a principal 
city of the Weirton-Steubenville, WV-OH Metropolitan Statistical Area,

Weirton, West Virginia, have experienced sluggish economies since the steel 
industry waned during the 1980s. Corporations such as Weirton Steel have 
had to reduce their workforce in order to become more efficient and competitive 
against other steel producers and lower steel prices worldwide.[citation

as a toll-access highway between Pittsburgh International Airport at Interstate 
376 and U.S. Route 22 in northwestern Washington County. Travel time between 
the Pittsburgh International Airport and the city of Steubenville is now 
approximately 25 minutes. Steubenville is located near two large shale 
formations - the Marcellus and Utica formations. Fort Steuben, located 
downtown on South Third Street, is a reconstructed 18th century fort on 
its original location overlooking the Ohio River. Built in 1787 to protect 
the government surveyors of the Seven Ranges of the Northwest Territory, 
Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit 
organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding 
block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain 
and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home 
to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention & Visitors Bureau and 
is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.[citation needed] Adjacent 
to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 
1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away 
as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the 
Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest 
Territory.[citation needed] "Ohio Valley Steelworker" Statue was created 
by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the Ohio Valley Steelworkers. The 
life-size figure carries a long-handled dipping ladle and is wearing the 
hooded fire-proof suit worn in the steel mills. The statue was located 
at the junction of Hwy 22 (University Blvd) and Hwy 7 (Dean Martin Blvd). 
In the fall of 2014, the statue was moved to its new home, displayed on 
South Fourth Street at the site of the Public Library of Steubenville and 
Jefferson County.[24] There is a statue downtown commemorating Edwin Stanton, 
President Abraham Lincoln's secretary of war. Stanton was born and raised 
in Steubenville.[citation needed] As of 2012, the Steubenville High School 
football team, Big Red, has the twentieth-most wins among U.S. high school 
football teams.[citation needed] The team had a 15–0 record in the 2005 
season, ending as Ohio Div-III State Champions. The team went 15-0 in the 
2006 season, repeating as state champions. The streak of regular-season 
victories eventually reached 68 games, and ended on October 23, 2009, with 
a loss to the Inkster (Michigan) Vikings.[25] Big Red also won the 1984 
Division II State Championship in football and were runners-up in Division 
II in 1987 and 1988, and runners-up in Division IV in 2008.[citation needed] 
Steubenville High has the second-most victories in the state for baseball 
state poll champions 1994, 1998, and 2011. and twelfth-most wins in the 
state for basketball.[citation needed] The city is also home to Steubenville 
Catholic Central High School, 1993 Div-V State Champion and 2005 Div-VI 
State runner-up.[citation needed] The Steubenville Stampede was a member 
of the Continental Indoor Football League. Steubenville Board of Parks 
and Recreation maintains four parks within the City. Belleview Park is 
the main park, where the Steubenville Little League holds all of their 
games. Belleview also has a swimming pool, tennis courts, and picnic areas. 
The golf course that once was part of Belleview Park is now the property 
of Franciscan University. The grounds are open to the public during daylight 
hours and students at the University frequent the hills for cross country 
practice runs. Beatty Park, located in the south side of Steubenville, 
was reopened for public use in September 2007. A newly installed Disc Golf 
Course was the focus for the Park's reopening. Other activities for Beatty 
Park may include hiking trails, a dog park, and bird watching. Thanks to 
efforts by local individuals working with the Steubenville Parks and Recreation 
Department, the idea of Beatty Park in “state of disrepair for sometime“ 
is no longer the theme. North End Park maintains a softball diamond (for 
use by Steubenville High School), playgrounds, and a picnic area. Jim Woods 
Park, in the west end of Steubenville, has a walking/jogging track, baseball 
diamond, and a picnic area. The newest elementary school in Steubenville 
is located at Jim Woods Park. The Steubenville City Council has successfully 
sold the Belleview Golf Course along with the "Green Strip" to Franciscan 
University of Steubenville. This move will allow the University to expand 
its operations and attract more potential students. The sale has come under 
scrutiny as the Belleview Golf Course was the only public course in the 
city. Smaller Parks Exist within the city as well The Flats Park on Highland 
Ave. and Maple Way, Linda Way Park at the end of Linda Way, Piece of Pie 
Park at the end of Maryland Ave., Veterans Memorial Park near the Pleasant 
Heights Fire Station, Pico Park at the corner of Pico Street and Cherry 
Street, and Murphy's Field and Playground also on Pleasant Height. Also 
there is a rec center located downtown called the Martin Luther King center 
where they host basketball games due to the courts, weight lifting and 
also zumba.[citation needed] (Update 10/2014) Piece of Pie park was closed 
in late September 2014 due to increase shootings near the park, and city 
officials have noted it will be only temporary closure to protect the citizens. 
Piece of Pie park swings, tables, and all activities have all been removed 
at the end of September 2014. The climate in this area is characterized 
by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout 
the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Steubenville 
has a Humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.[26] 
The City of Steubenville is part of the 6th Congressional district of Ohio 
and is represented by Bill Johnson. The 6th district is the longest US 
House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio. 
Steubenville has had a reputation for political corruption. Over a period 
of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits 
involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including 
$400,000 between 1990 and 1996. In 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice 
alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals 
to "excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports" and had engaged 
in practices regarding "improper stops, searches, and seizures." The report 
from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against 
individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those 
who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals 
were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they 
were "likely to complain of abuse." It also stated that the officers involved 
also falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that 
"misconduct would not be recorded."[28] As a result, the city's police 
force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree 
with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights 
lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the "pattern 
or practice" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve 
the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, 
establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an "early warning system."[29] 
The speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in 
revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time 
period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled 
that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal 
and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, 
because it stated it was "bound by contract to continue the services" of 
Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. 
Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the 
judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing 
citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting 
vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.[30] In mid-2006, an attorney 
filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally 
collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He 
won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands 
of tickets totaling $258,000.[31] Stern also gathered enough signatures 
from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the 
question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program 
should continue. On November 8, 2006, city residents voted to end the city's 
speed camera program with a 76.2 percent majority.[32] Steubenville is 
home to two institutions of higher education. The Franciscan University 
of Steubenville is a private, four-year university affiliated with the 
Roman Catholic Church. It was founded in 1946. The second institution is 
Eastern Gateway Community College. It is a public, two-year college that 
opened its doors in 1968; its service district includes Columbiana, Mahoning, 
and Trumbull Counties as well as Jefferson County. On July 24, 2012, after 
being threatened with a lawsuit from the atheist Freedom from Religion 
Foundation, the Steubenville city council decided to remove the image of 
Franciscan University from its town logo rather than pay for a lawsuit.[33] 
The city later proposed a logo that included a chapel and cross.[34] Public 
schools in Steubenville are operated by the Steubenville City School District. 
There are a total of five schools in the district: Wells Academy, West 
Pugliese, Garfield, Harding Middle, and Steubenville High School. A portion 
of far western Steubenville is served by the Indian Creek Local School 
District. Several private schools are located in Steubenville. The Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Steubenville operates Bishop John King Mussio Central 
Elementary School, Bishop John King Mussio Central Junior High School and
