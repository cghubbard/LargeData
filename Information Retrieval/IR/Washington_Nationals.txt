The Washington Nationals are a professional baseball team based in Washington, 
D.C. The Nationals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club 
of the National League (NL) East division. From 2005 to 2007, the team 
played in RFK Stadium; since 2008 their home stadium has been Nationals 
Park on South Capitol Street in Southeast D.C., near the Anacostia River.[2] 
As the Major League Baseball team in the U.S. capital, the Nationals are 
the successors to the original Washington Nationals, renamed Senators in 
1956 (both "Nats" for short). A Washington Senators team — one from 1891 
to 1899 played in the early National League, the American League Nationals 
from 1901 to 1960 (becoming the Senators in 1956) then moving to Minnesota 
to become the Minnesota Twins. The expansion Senators existed from 1961 
to 1971 then moved to Arlington as the Texas Rangers. An expansion franchise, 
National League club was founded in 1969 as the Montreal Expos, the first 
major league team in Canada.[3] They were based in Montreal, and played 
their home games at Jarry Park Stadium and later in Olympic Stadium. During 
the strike-shortened 1981 season, the Expos won a division championship 
and made their only post-season appearance as a Montreal franchise, defeating 
the Philadelphia Phillies, 3–2, in the National League Division Series, 
but losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers, 3–2, in the National League Championship 
Series. The franchise had its highest winning percentage in the strike-shortened 
season of 1994, when the team had the best record in baseball. The team's 
subsequent shedding of players caused fan interest to drop off, and after 
the 2001 season, MLB considered revoking the team's franchise, along with 
either the Minnesota Twins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[4][5] After being 
purchased by MLB in 2002, the team was moved before the 2005 season to 
Washington, D.C. and renamed the Nationals, the first relocation since 
the expansion Washington Senators moved to Arlington, Texas, and became 
the Texas Rangers in 1972. Including their time in Montreal, the Nationals 
are one of two franchises, and the only one in the National League, never 
to have played in a World Series. (The American League's Seattle Mariners 
are the other).[6][7] The Montreal Expos joined the National League in 
1969, along with the San Diego Padres, with a majority share held by Charles 
Bronfman, a major shareholder in Seagram. Named after the Expo 67 World's 
Fair, the Expos' initial home was Jarry Park. Managed by Gene Mauch, the 
team lost 110 games in their first season, coincidentally matching the 
Padres inaugural win-loss record, and continued to struggle during their 
first decade with sub-.500 seasons. Starting in 1977, the team's home venue 
was Montreal's Olympic Stadium, built for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Two 
years later, the team won a franchise-high 95 games, finishing second in 
the National League East. The Expos began the 1980s with a core group of 
young players, including catcher Gary Carter, outfielders Tim Raines and 
Andre Dawson, third baseman Tim Wallach, and pitchers Steve Rogers and 
Bill Gullickson. The team won its only division championship in the strike-shortened 
split season of 1981, ending its season with a three games to two loss 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series. 
The team spent most of the 1980s in the middle of the NL East pack, finishing 
in third or fourth place in eight out of nine seasons from 1982 to 1990. 
Buck Rodgers was hired as manager before the 1985 season and guided the 
Expos to a .500 or better record five times in six years, with the highlight 
coming in 1987, when they won 91 games. They finished third, but were just 
four games behind the division-winning Cardinals. Bronfman sold the team 
to a consortium of owners in 1991, with Claude Brochu as the managing general 
partner.[8][9] Rodgers, at that time second only to Gene Mauch in number 
of Expos games managed, was replaced partway through the 1991 season. In 
May 1992, Felipe Alou, a member of the Expos organization since 1976, was 
promoted to manager, becoming the first Dominican-born manager in MLB history.[8] 
Alou would become the leader in Expos games managed, while guiding the 
team to winning records, including 1994, when the Expos, led by a talented 
group of players including Larry Walker, Moisés Alou, Marquis Grissom and 
Pedro Martínez, had the best record in the major leagues until the 1994–95 
Major League Baseball strike forced the cancellation of the remainder of 
the season. After the disappointment of 1994, Expos management began shedding 
its key players, and the team's fan support dwindled. Brochu sold control 
of the team to Jeffrey Loria in 1999,[10][11] but Loria failed to close 
on a plan to build a new downtown ballpark, and did not reach an agreement 
on television and English radio broadcast contracts for the 2000 season, 
reducing the team's media coverage. In November 2001, Major League Baseball's 
owners voted 28–2 to contract the league by two teams — according to various 
sources, the Expos and the Minnesota Twins, both of which reportedly voted 
against contraction.[12] Subsequently, the Boston Red Sox were sold to 
a partnership led by John W. Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins.[12][13] 
In order to clear the way for Henry's group to assume ownership of the 
Red Sox, Henry sold the Marlins to Loria, and baseball purchased the Expos 
from Loria.[12] However, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, 
operator of the Metrodome, won an injunction requiring the Twins to play 
there in 2002.[12] Because MLB was unable to revoke the Twins franchise, 
it was compelled to keep both the Twins and Expos as part of the regular 
season schedule. In the collective bargaining agreement signed with the 
Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in August 2002, contraction 
was prohibited until the end of the contract in 2006.[14] By that time, 
the Expos had become the Washington Nationals and the Twins had made sufficient 
progress towards the eventual building of a new baseball-specific stadium 
that contraction was no longer on the agenda. With contraction no longer 
an option for the immediate term, MLB began looking for a relocation site 
for the Expos. Some of the choices included Oklahoma City; Washington, 
D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Monterrey, Mexico; Portland, Oregon; somewhere 
in Northern Virginia such as Arlington or Dulles; Norfolk, Virginia; Las 
Vegas; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Washington, D.C. and Virginia emerged 
as the front-runners. In both 2003 and 2004, the Expos played 22 of their 
home games in San Juan, Puerto Rico at the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, and the 
remaining 59 in Montreal. On September 29, 2004, MLB announced that the 
Expos would move to Washington, D.C. in 2005.[15][16] The Expos played 
their final game on October 3 at Shea Stadium, losing by a score of 8–1 
against the New York Mets, the same opponent that the Expos first faced 
at its start, 35 years earlier. On November 15, a lawsuit by the former 
team owners against MLB and former majority owner Jeffrey Loria was struck 
down by arbitrators, bringing to an end all legal actions that would impede 
a move. The owners of the other MLB teams approved the move to Washington 
in a 28–1 vote on December 3 (Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos cast 
the sole dissenting vote). Numerous professional baseball teams have called 
Washington, D.C. home. The Washington Senators, a founding member of the 
American League (AL), played in the nation's capital from 1901 to 1960 
before moving to Minnesota and becoming the Twins. The original Washington 
American League Base Ball Club was founded by three local businessmen: 
Edward J. Walsh, Benjamin Minor, and Harry Rapley. Clark Griffith was hired 
as manager in 1912 and became a part owner, accumulating majority shares 
in later years. The stadium, known as Washington American League Base Ball 
Park, later became known as Griffith Stadium. With notable stars including 
Walter Johnson and Joe Cronin, the Senators won the 1924 World Series and 
pennants in 1925 and 1933. The franchise became more successful after moving 
to Minnesota for the 1961 season to be renamed the Minnesota Twins. A second 
Washington Senators team (1961–1971) had a winning record only once in 
its 11 years, although it featured slugger Frank Howard, who was inducted 
into the Ring of Fame at the new Nationals Park in 2016. This team was 
notable also because Ted Williams was manager in 1971. The expansion Senators 
moved to Arlington, Texas for the 1972 season and changed its name to the 
Texas Rangers. The city of Washington spent the next 33 years without a 
baseball team. Although there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators 
when the Montreal Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, political 
considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the 
first American League franchise's official name used from 1901 to 1956.[17] 
Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name 
Senators because the District of Columbia does not have voting representation 
in Congress.[18] In addition, the Rangers still owned the rights to the 
Senators name,[19] although the Nationals were able to acquire the rights 
to the curly "W" logo from the Rangers. Washington, D.C., mayor Anthony 
A. Williams supported the name "Washington Grays", in honor of the Negro-league 
team the Homestead Grays (1929–1950), which had been based in Pittsburgh, 
but played many of their home games in Washington. In the end, the team 
owners chose the name "Washington Nationals." When Ted Lerner took over 
the club in mid-2006, he hired Stan Kasten as team president. Kasten was 
widely known as the architect of the Atlanta Braves before and during their 
run of 14 division titles. Kasten was also the general manager or president 
of many other Atlanta-area sports teams, including the Atlanta Hawks and 
Atlanta Thrashers. "The Plan", as it became known, was a long-range rebuilding 
and restructuring of the team from the ground up. This plan included investing 
in the farm system and the draft, and having a suitable team to go along 
with their new stadium. In the front office, the Nationals hired the well-respected 
former Arizona scouting director Mike Rizzo to be the vice president of 
baseball operations, second in charge under then-general manager Jim Bowden.[20] 
Thanks to back-to-back No. 1 picks of Stephen Strasburg (in 2009) and Bryce 
Harper (in 2010), and other strong moves to their farm system, the Nationals 
became a contending team by 2012, winning division titles in 2012, 2014, 
and 2016.[21] In April 2015, Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that Nationals 
Park was selected by Major League Baseball to host the 2018 All Star Game.[22]

Van Horne During the franchise's period in Montreal, the Montreal Expos 
retired three numbers in honor of four players, plus Jackie Robinson's 
number 42 which was retired throughout all Major League Baseball in 1997.[25] 
Following the move to Washington, D.C., the numbers (except 42) were returned 
to circulation and remain in use as of 2016[update], although the "Team 
History" section of the Nationals' website continues to refer to the numbers 
as "retired."[25] After the Expos' departure from Montreal, the National 
Hockey League′s Montreal Canadiens hung a banner in Bell Centre honoring 
the Expos' retired numbers. On August 10, 2010, the Nationals unveiled 
a "Ring of Honor"[note 1] at Nationals Park to honor Major League Baseball 
Hall of Fame members who had played "significant years" for the Washington 
Nationals, original Washington Senators (1901–1960), expansion Washington 
Senators (1961–1971), Homestead Grays, or Montreal Expos.[26][27] In late 
August 2016, the team dropped the criterion that an inductee be a member 
of the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame, opening membership to "anyone 
who has made a significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, 
D.C.;"[27] the first inductee under the new criteria was Frank Howard.[27] 
The ring includes:[26][27][28][29][30] Sources[31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] 
One prominent fan is "Rubber Chicken Man" Hugh Kaufman, who waves a rubber 
chicken over the dugout to ward off "JuJu". Local sports writers have noted 
that his ritual "sacrifices" of rubber chickens often precede turnarounds 
in the Nationals' performance.[42] Kaufman has built a following at the 
Stadium and in 2013 started a group called the "Secret Society of the Rubber 
Chicken" that now claims several Nationals players among its members.[43]

Dream Foundation is the team's charity which is "committed to community 
partnerships that improve the lives of children and families across the 
Washington Capital Region. The foundation plans to open a youth baseball 
academy in partnership with the D.C. government, a pediatric diabetes care 
center at Children's National Medical Center in partnership with the Center. 
The foundation also provides grants to local organizations.[46] On August 
1, 2011, the foundation, in partnership with several local organizations, 
formally opened Miracle Field in Germantown, Maryland as part of an effort 
to encourage athletic activity in children with "mental and/or physical 
challenges."[47] According to Steven Miller of MLB.com, what sets Miracle 
Field apart in terms of safety is its unique design, as it "is made entirely 
of a cushioned synthetic turf that is five-eighths of an inch thick-- providing 
a safe surface for children in wheelchairs or with other handicaps." [48] 
The Nationals' flagship radio station is WJFK-FM (106.7 FM) "The Fan", 
which is owned by CBS Radio. Charlie Slowes and Dave Jageler are the play-by-play 
announcers. Most games are simulcast on WFED (1500 AM), which had been 
the flagship station since the 2006 season[49] until a multi-year agreement 
was reached between the Nationals and WJFK before the 2011 season.[50] 
WJFK (1580 AM) airs any games that WFED is unable to air due to conflicts. 
The other former flagship is WWZZ (104.1 FM), which carried games in the 
2005 season.[51] Nationals' telecasts are predominantly on Mid-Atlantic 
Sports Network (MASN), with a few games picked up for free TV by Fox by 
way of WTTG. MASN simulcasts 20 games per season (the season opener plus 
19 weekend games) on free TV in the Washington area, on WUSA.[52] Bob Carpenter 
is the TV play-by-play announcer and F.P. Santangelo was hired in January 
2011 as color analyst.[53] Former color analysts are Tom Paciorek, Don 
Sutton, and Rob Dibble, who was fired in September 2010 after criticizing 
Stephen Strasburg for not pitching while injured.[53][54] Ray Knight and 
Johnny Holliday host the postgame show "Nats Xtra". Knight filled in as 
color analyst in September 2010 after Dibble was fired.[53] TV ratings 
were among the worst in the league as of July 2008[55][56] but increased 
during the 2010 and 2011 seasons.[57][58] The Nationals have an interleague 
rivalry with the nearby Baltimore Orioles nicknamed the Beltway Series. 
The teams have played two series a season – one in Baltimore and one in
