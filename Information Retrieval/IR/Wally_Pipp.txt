Walter Clement Pipp (February 17, 1893 – January 11, 1965) was an American 
professional baseball player. A first baseman, Pipp played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, and Cincinnati 
Reds between 1913 and 1928. After appearing in 12 games for the Tigers 
in 1913 and playing in the minor leagues in 1914, he was purchased by the 
Yankees before the 1915 season. They made him their starting first baseman. 
He and Home Run Baker led an improved Yankee lineup that led the league 
in home runs. He led the American League in home runs in 1916 and 1917. 
With Babe Ruth, Bob Meusel, Joe Dugan, and Waite Hoyt, the Yankees won 
three consecutive American League pennants from 1921 through 1923, and 
won the 1923 World Series. In 1925, he lost his starting role to Lou Gehrig, 
after which he finished his major league career with Cincinnati. Pipp is 
considered to be one of the best power hitters of the dead ball era.[1] 
Pipp is now best remembered as the man who lost his starting role to Lou 
Gehrig at the beginning of Gehrig's streak of 2,130 consecutive games. 
According to a popular legend, Pipp asked to sit due to a headache. Walter 
Clement Pipp was born on February 17, 1893, in Chicago, Illinois, to Pauline 
(née Stroeber) and William H. Pipp. He was raised as a Roman Catholic, 
and different sources describe him as being of Irish or German ancestry. 
He was raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[1][2] As a child, Pipp said that 
he was hit in the head with a hockey puck, which resulted in headaches 
throughout his life.[3] Pipp enrolled at the Catholic University of America 
in Washington, D.C., where he studied architecture and played baseball 
for the Catholic University Cardinals.[4] Pipp graduated in 1913.[1] In 
1912, Pipp made his debut in professional baseball with the Kalamazoo Celery 
Champs of the Class D Southern Michigan League. In 68 games played, he 
had a .270 batting average. The Detroit Tigers of the American League purchased 
his contract late in the 1912 season. Pipp attempted to hold out from the 
Tigers, demanding a portion of the purchase price, and threatened to return 
to college.[1] After graduating from college, Pipp ended his holdout without 
receiving a share of the purchase price.[2] Pipp made his major league 
debut with the Tigers on June 29, 1913.[1] After playing 12 games for Detroit, 
batting .161, the Tigers reassigned Pipp to the Providence Grays of the 
Class AA International League. He committed seven errors in 14 games for 
Providence, and was demoted to the Scranton Miners of the Class B New York 
State League, where he only batted .220.[2] In 1914, Pipp played for the 
Rochester Hustlers of the International League. Pipp had a .314 batting 
average and 27 triples. He led all batters in the league with 15 home runs, 
a .526 slugging percentage, and 290 total bases.[1][2] In January 1915, 
Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston agreed to purchase the 
New York Yankees of the American League. As part of the agreement, the 
other team owners in the American League agreed to help the Yankees restock 
their system with prospects. One of the deals Ruppert and Huston negotiated 
was their purchase of Pipp. After the purchase was completed, all owners, 
with the exception of Frank Navin, the owner of the Tigers, broke their 
word.[2] On February 4, 1915, the Tigers sold Pipp and outfielder Hugh 
High to the Yankees, receiving $5,000 for each player ($117,155 in current 
dollar terms).[1] The Yankees had struggled prior to Ruppert and Huston's 
purchase, having only one winning record in their previous eight seasons. 
They made Pipp their starting first baseman in time for Opening Day of 
the 1915 season. The Yankees added Home Run Baker in 1916, and they formed 
the center of the Yankees' batting order.[5] Pipp led the American League 
in home runs with 12 in 1916; Baker finished second with 10. Pipp hit nine 
home runs in 1917, again leading the league.[2] In 1918, Pipp hit only 
two home runs, but batted .304. He missed playing time under the nation's 
"work or fight" rule during World War I; he worked as a naval aviation 
cadet at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He batted .275 with 
seven home runs in 1919, as Babe Ruth surpassed him as the best power hitter 
in the American League.[1] The Yankees moved to strengthen their team after 
the 1919 season, adding Ruth and fellow outfielder Bob Meusel and third 
baseman Joe Dugan. Between 1920 and 1924, Pipp had a .301 average, with 
season averages of 29 doubles, 94 runs scored, and 97 runs batted in (RBI) 
per season. Led by their strong lineup and additions to the pitching staff, 
such as Waite Hoyt, the Yankees finished in second place in 1920. Pipp 
became the cleanup hitter, behind Ruth in the batting order. Pipp hit .296 
in 1921, and the Yankees won the American League pennant.[2] However, they 
lost the 1921 World Series to the crosstown rival New York Giants of the 
National League.[6] On July 26, 1922, Pipp bobbled a ball during the fifth 
inning of a game against the St. Louis Browns. When the Yankees returned 
to the dugout, Ruth criticized Pipp's fielding. Pipp attacked Ruth, and 
the two were separated by teammates. Though Ruth insisted they'd "settle 
this after the game", Ruth and Pipp led the Yankees to a victory with their 
hitting, and when Pipp approached Ruth after the game, ready to fight, 
Ruth opted against it. Pipp said this resulted in reduced tension among 
the Yankees, which he attributed to their improved play from that point 
forward.[2] Pipp batted .329 in 1922 and the Yankees again won the American 
League pennant.[2] In a rematch, the Giants again defeated the Yankees 
in the 1922 World Series.[7] Meanwhile, Pipp scouted Lou Gehrig, who was 
playing college baseball for Columbia University, and suggested to Miller 
Huggins, the Yankees' manager, that he should sign Gehrig. Pipp personally 
helped develop Gehrig after he signed.[8] Pipp had a strong 1923 season, 
but he injured his right ankle while stepping off of a train in Boston 
late in the year. The Yankees used Gehrig, whom they promoted from the 
minor leagues, to play the Yankees' final four games.[2] Though Huggins 
initially thought Pipp would not be able to play in the 1923 World Series,[9] 
Pipp recovered sufficiently in time to play.[10] The Yankees won the series 
in six games over the Giants.[2][11] The Yankees finished in second place 
in the American League in 1924,[2] and Pipp led the American league with 
114 RBIs and 19 triples.[12] The Yankees began the 1925 season struggling, 
and Huggins began to replace players in his lineup in response. Huggins 
benched starting shortstop Everett Scott on May 6, replacing him with Pee 
Wee Wanninger. At the time, Scott had the longest streak of consecutive 
games played, with 1,307. The Yankees continued to struggle. The Yankees 
entered play on June 2 on a five-game losing streak. Their 15–26 win-loss 
record had them in seventh place out of the eight teams in the American 
League, half a game better than the last place team, and 13 1⁄2 games out 
of first place in the standings. Before their game against the Washington 
Senators, Huggins replaced Pipp in the Yankees' lineup with Gehrig, and 
benched second baseman Aaron Ward and catcher Wally Schang as well. Pipp 
was batting .244 with only three home runs and 23 RBIs, and had a .181 
batting average over the previous three weeks. This was the first game 
of Gehrig's then-record 2,130 consecutive games played, which lasted for 
14 seasons.[2] According to the most popular version of the story, Pipp 
showed up at Yankee Stadium that day with a severe headache, and asked 
the team's trainer for two aspirin. Miller Huggins, the Yankees' manager, 
noticed this, and said "Wally, take the day off. We'll try that kid Gehrig 
at first today and get you back in there tomorrow." Gehrig played well 
and became the Yankees' new starting first baseman. This story first appeared 
in a 1939 New York World-Telegram on Gehrig's career, in which Pipp was 
interviewed. Pipp was later quoted to have said, "I took the two most expensive 
aspirin in history."[2][3][13] According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 
1942 film about Gehrig's life, Pipp asked out of the game because he was 
experiencing double vision from being hit in the head two days prior.[2] 
By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was taken out of the 
lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell 
during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch 
from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month 
after Pipp's benching.[2] The New York Sun reported that the benching was 
due to Pipp's struggles against left-handed pitchers, as southpaw George 
Mogridge was the scheduled starting pitcher for the Senators on June 2. 
Other sources suggest Yankee manager Miller Huggins may have actually benched 
Pipp and other veterans in order to "shake up" the slumping lineup.[2] 
According to another story, supported by Gehrig's wife, Pipp was not at 
the game on June 2 because he was gambling on horse racing at a race track.[14] 
His son Tom denied this rumor, stating that his father never bet on horses.[15] 
When interviewed by Sports Illustrated, Pipp's own children disagreed on 
the reason for their father's benching, believing it was either due to 
Pipp being beaned, or struggling.[2] One of his sons believes that Pipp 
told Huggins to play Gehrig in his place, as he knew that Gehrig had a 
future with the Yankees, while he likely did not.[15] Ruth had returned 
to the Yankees' lineup on June 1, the day before Pipp, Ward, and Schang 
were benched. Despite Ruth's return and the strong play of Gehrig, who 
batted .295 with 20 home runs and 68 RBIs,[2][12] the Yankees finished 
in seventh place. Pipp was hospitalized for a week after being hit in the 
head by Caldwell on July 2, and he played sparingly during the remainder 
of the season.[2] He ended the year with a .230 average, three home runs, 
and 24 RBIs.[12] Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made personnel changes 
during the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American 
League team, but could not agree on the terms with any team.[2] They put 
Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National 
League,[16] who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 
waiver price.[1] The Reds, who had not had a strong starting first baseman 
since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from 
the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and 
so acquired Pipp instead.[17] Pipp again attempted to acquire a portion 
of the purchase price, but was rebuffed.[2] Pipp played 372 games for the 
Reds over the next three seasons. In 1926, he had a .291 batting average, 
and his 99 RBIs and 15 triples were both fourth-best in the National League. 
He batted .260 with 41 RBIs in 1927, and .283 in 1928.[1] With first baseman 
George Kelly also on their roster, the Reds released Pipp before the 1929 
season. Pipp signed with the Newark Bears of the International League for 
the season.[18] He earned $40,000 that year, more than he made during his 
major league career. He batted .312 for Newark, and retired after the season.[2] 
Pipp played 1,872 games.[3] He had three seasons with a .300+ batting average, 
and two seasons with 100 or more RBI. Pipp had a .281 career batting average. 
He led both the American and National leagues in fielding percentage. His 
226 sacrifices as a Yankee remain a team record. Pipp was the first Yankee 
to lead the American League in home runs.[2] Due to his famous replacement 
by Gehrig, players began to say they were "Wally Pipped" when replaced 
in a lineup, especially if it is due to a minor injury.[2][19][20][21][22][23][24] 
Pipp often attended Old-Timers' Day at Yankee Stadium and Tiger Stadium, 
playing in 12 Old-Timers' games.[15] He was later hired by Sports Illustrated 
as one of the magazine's first writers.[2] After retiring, Pipp invested 
in the stock market, but lost his wealth in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.[3] 
He authored a book, titled Buying Cheap and Selling Dear. He worked as 
a broadcaster on a pregame baseball show for the Tigers, wrote radio scripts, 
and worked in publishing. He organized baseball programs around his community 
for the National Youth Administration.[2][15] He also spent time unemployed 
during the Great Depression.[2] In 1940, Pipp was on the verge of bankruptcy, 
but he managed to pay off his debts without going bankrupt.[15] During 
World War II, Pipp worked at the Willow Run manufacturing complex in Ypsilanti, 
building B-24 bombers. Following the war, Pipp worked for the Rockford 
Screw Products Corporation as a machine parts salesman, selling bolts and 
screws to automotive companies based in Detroit and Grand Rapids.[1][25] 
Pipp and his wife, Nora,[15] had four children:[2] three sons (Walter, 
Tom, and Wally Jr.) and a daughter (Dorothy).[15] Pipp's brother, the Reverend 
W.B. Pipp, was a Catholic priest and golfer.[4][26] The Pipps moved to 
Lansing, Michigan, in 1949. After suffering a number of strokes, Pipp moved 
to a nursing home in Grand Rapids in September 1963.[1] He died there on 
January 11, 1965, of a heart attack at the age of 71.[27][28] He is interred
