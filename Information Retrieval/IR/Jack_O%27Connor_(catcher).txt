As player As manager John Joseph O'Connor (June 2, 1866 – November 14, 
1937), also known as Peach Pie, was a utility player in Major League Baseball 
in the American Association, the National League, and the American League, 
primarily used as an outfielder. He began his career as a left fielder 
and catcher for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, and he soon moved his way 
around the infield. He also played for the Columbus Solons from 1889 to 
1891, and in 1892, he joined the Cleveland Spiders, where he would stay 
until 1898, when the owners of the St. Louis Browns were buying their players 
from the Spiders, who ceased to exist in 1899. O'Connor moved west to play 
with the Perfectos until 10 games into the 1900 season, he was traded to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played one season with the New York Highlanders 
before finishing his career back in St. Louis with the Browns. O'Connor 
is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date who have appeared 
in Major League games in four decades. He died in St. Louis at age 71. 
O'Connor was the player-manager of the Browns in 1910, finishing a dismal 
47–107. He is best known for trying to help Nap Lajoie win the batting 
title and the associated 1910 Chalmers Award over Ty Cobb in the last two 
games of the season, a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park. Cobb was leading 
Lajoie .385 to .376 in the batting race going into that last day. O'Connor 
ordered rookie third baseman Red Corriden to station himself in shallow 
left field. Lajoie bunted five straight times down the third base line 
and made it to first easily. On his last at-bat, Lajoie reached base on 
a fielding error, officially giving him a hitless at-bat and lowering his 
average. O'Connor and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, 
a woman, to change the call to a hit, offering to buy her a new wardrobe. 
Cobb won the batting title by less than one percentage point over Lajoie, 
.385069 to .384095. The resulting outcry triggered an investigation by 
American League president Ban Johnson, who declared Cobb the rightful winner 
of the batting title (though Chalmers awarded cars to both players). At 
his insistence, Browns' owner Robert Hedges fired both O'Connor and Howell, 
and released them as players; both men were informally banned from baseball 
for life.[1] In 1981, however, research revealed that one game was counted 
twice for Cobb when he went 2-for-3. As a result, his 1910 batting statistics 
should have been shown as 194-for-506 and .383399, less than 0.0007 behind
