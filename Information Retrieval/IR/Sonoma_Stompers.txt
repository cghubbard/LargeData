The Sonoma Stompers are an independent professional baseball team based 
out of Sonoma, California. They began play as a member of the Pacific Association 
of Professional Baseball Clubs in 2014. They are a successor franchise 
to the defunct Sonoma County Grapes, and are the first professional team 
to make Sonoma County home since the Sonoma County Crushers ceased play 
following the 2002 season. The Stompers announced their first professional 
signing, Tommy Lyons in March 2014, and shortly there after traded for 
local hero, Jayce Ray. The team's first manager was Ray Serrano, who led 
the Stompers to a 42–36 record in their inaugural season. In 2015, Serrano 
accepted a full-time position with the Atlanta Braves to serve as the organization's 
catching instructor.[1] Former major league pitcher Bill "Spaceman" Lee 
started a game for the Stompers on August 12, 2014, pitching the team to 
victory over the Pittsburg Mettle (since renamed the Pittsburg Diamonds). 
Lee set a record with the win, becoming the oldest person (at age 67) to 
ever win a professional baseball game.[2] Lee pitched 5⅔ innings, and batted 
for himself.[3] In 2015 the Sonoma Stompers allowed Ben Lindbergh and Sam 
Miller of Baseball Prospectus's "Effectively Wild" podcast to serve as 
the Baseball Operations department, under General Manager Theo Fightmaster. 
The duo wrote about their experience in a book entitled The Only Rule is 
it Has to Work that came out on May 3, 2016.[4] The team made history in 
June 2015, when pitcher Sean Conroy became the first openly gay active 
professional baseball player.[5] In June 2016, the Stompers announced that 
two female baseball players would join their roster starting in July. Upon 
joining the roster, the two players, outfielder-pitcher Kelsie Whitmore 
and infielder Stacy Piagno, will make the Sonoma Stompers the first coed 
professional baseball team since the 1950s.[6][7] The Stompers added catcher 
Anna Kimbrell in July 2016.[8] Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders
