Nicholas Maddox (November 9, 1886 in Govanstown, Maryland – November 27, 
1954 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball 
who played from 1907 through 1910 for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Maddox is 
one of the few pitchers to throw a no-hitter in his rookie season. He defeated 
the Brooklyn Superbas 2–1 at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park on September 
20, 1907, one week after pitching a 4–0 shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals 
in his major league debut. At the age of 20 years and ten months, he became 
the youngest pitcher ever to throw a no-hitter in major league history. 
Not until Cliff Chambers in 1951 would another Pirate pitch a no-hitter, 
and the next no-hitter in Pittsburgh would not come until 1971, when Bob 
Gibson of the Cardinals no-hit the Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium. The 
Pirates' home stadium in between, Forbes Field, had not witnessed a no-hitter 
in its 61-year (mid-1909 to mid-1970) history. Through 2013, Maddox is 
still the youngest pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the majors. Maddox was 
also the last Pirate to win his first 4 career starts (in 1907) until the 
feat was matched by Gerrit Cole in 2013.[1] William F. Kirk of the New 
York American in 1908 called Maddox a "...a well formed youth with a face 
like a dried apple."[2] After his rookie season, Maddox spent two more 
years with the Pirates as a starting pitcher and finished his career in 
1910 as a relief pitcher. In his career, he had 43 wins, 20 losses, and
