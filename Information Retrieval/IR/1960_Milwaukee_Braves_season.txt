The 1960 Milwaukee Braves season was the eighth for the franchise in Milwaukee, 
and the 85th overall in the National League. The Braves finished in second 
place in the NL with a record of 88–66, seven games behind the NL and World 
Series Champion Pittsburgh Pirates. After 3 1⁄2 seasons at the helm of 
the Braves and compiling a record of 341–231 (.596) with two NL pennants 
and the 1957 World Series championship, manager Fred Haney, 63, resigned 
on October 5 in the wake of the 1959 playoff loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[8] 
On October 24, the Braves appointed another veteran skipper, Chuck Dressen, 
65, well known as the manager of the "Boys of Summer" Brooklyn Dodgers 
of 1951–1953, as Haney's successor for 1960.[9] The Braves had considered 
a number of high-profile former big-league managers,[8] as well as minor 
league skipper Ben Geraghty, before settling on Dressen. Pitching coach 
Whit Wyatt was Dressen's only 1960 holdover from Haney's coaching staff, 
with Billy Herman, John Fitzpatrick and George Susce all departing with 
Haney. Infielders Other batters Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
