Eliot Asinof (July 13, 1919 – June 10, 2008)[1] was an American writer 
of fiction and nonfiction best known for his writing about baseball. His 
most famous book was Eight Men Out, a nonfiction reconstruction of the 
1919 Black Sox scandal. Asinof was born in Manhattan and lived in and around 
New York City for much of his life. In his youth, he worked in his family's 
tailoring business. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1940, then 
played briefly as a minor-league first baseman in the Philadelphia Phillies' 
organization. During World War II, Asinof served in the U.S. Army on Adak 
in the Aleutian Islands.[2] He was married for five years to Jocelyn Brando, 
an actress who was the elder sister of Marlon Brando; the marriage ended 
in divorce in 1955. Besides playing the game seriously, Asinof wrote extensively 
about baseball. His 1955 debut novel, Man on Spikes, was based on the experience 
of a friend, Mickey Rutner, who played minor league ball and twelve games 
in the majors. The work was chosen as one of "the golden dozen" baseball 
books by noted author Roger Kahn. Asinof's most famous book, Eight Men 
Out, painstakingly reconstructed the events of the Black Sox scandal that 
marred the World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Cincinnati 
Reds in the same year that Asinof was born. The book was published in 1963; 
the screenplay for the film Eight Men Out, co-written by Asinof and director 
John Sayles, appeared in 1988. An article in the September 2009 issue of 
Chicago Lawyer magazine argued that Eliot Asinof's 1963 book Eight Men 
Out, purporting to confirm Jackson's guilt, was based on inaccurate information; 
for example, Jackson never confessed to throwing the Series as Asinof claimed. 
Further, Asinof omitted key facts from publicly available documents such 
as the 1920 grand jury records and proceedings of Jackson's successful 
1924 lawsuit against Comiskey to recover back pay for the 1920 and 1921 
seasons. Asinof's use of fictional characters within a supposedly non-fiction 
account added further questions about the historical accuracy of the book.[3] 
Asinof also worked on other projects related to the scandal, including 
TV documentaries such as the 2001 ESPN Sports Century Flashback: The 1919 
Black Sox Scandal and the 2005 The Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame the 1919 
Chicago White Sox for "Throwing" the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati 
Reds. In 1968, Asinof signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” 
pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.[4] 
Asinof wrote other novels and nonfiction books unrelated to baseball including 
The Fox is Crazy Too (1976), the story of skyjacker Garrett Brock Trapnell. 
His career as a scriptwriter was curtailed when he was blacklisted for
