John Clement Schulte (September 8, 1896 – June 28, 1978) was an American 
catcher and coach in professional baseball. A native of Fredericktown, 
Missouri, Schulte appeared on five Major League Baseball teams in his five-year 
MLB career. Schulte played as a catcher for the St. Louis Browns (1923 
and 1932), St. Louis Cardinals (1927), Philadelphia Phillies (1928), Chicago 
Cubs (1929) and Boston Braves (1932). In Chicago, he played under Joe McCarthy, 
whom he would later serve as a longtime coach. After his maiden coaching 
assignment with the Cubs in 1933,[1] Schulte joined McCarthy and the New 
York Yankees beginning in 1934. He coached 15 full seasons (1934–48) in 
the Bronx,[2] even serving under Bill Dickey, Johnny Neun and Bucky Harris 
after McCarthy's retirement in May 1946. The Yankees won seven World Series 
titles and eight American League pennants during Schulte's decade and a 
half as a coach. Then, in 1949, he rejoined McCarthy with the Boston Red 
Sox.[3] When McCarthy retired for the final time on June 23, 1950, Schulte 
was reassigned to scouting duties by the Red Sox. He coached in minor league 
baseball for the Yankees' Kansas City Blues Triple-A affiliate before returning 
to scouting with the Cleveland Indians. He died in St. Louis, Missouri,
