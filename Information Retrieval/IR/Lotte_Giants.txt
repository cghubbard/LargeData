The Lotte Giants (Korean: 롯데 자이언츠) are a professional baseball team based 
in the southeastern city of Busan, South Korea, and one of the original 
franchises of the KBO League. The Lotte Giants are owned by the South Korean-Japanese 
Lotte conglomerate, which also owns the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional 
Baseball. From 1982 through 1986, they played at Gudeok Baseball Stadium 
and since then have played at Sajik Baseball Stadium. They won the KBO 
Championship twice, in 1984 and 1992. The team drew about 1.38 million 
spectators during the 2009 season, a record which remains as the most attendance[2] 
in a single season in any Korean sports league. They are often called the 
Busan Seagulls (Korean: 부산 갈매기) because the official bird of the city of 
Busan is the seagull, and their main fight song is Busan Seagulls. Concidentally, 
a seagull also serves as the mascot for the Chiba Lotte Marines. The Lotte 
Giants were founded as an amateur baseball team of the Korea Baseball Association 
in Seoul, South Korea, on 6 May 1975, when there was no professional sports 
team in the country. On 22 February 1982, the Giants became professional 
and moved to Busan, the second largest city after Seoul in South Korea. 
The Lotte Giants made their the KBO League debut against the Haitai Tigers 
at Gudeok Baseball Stadium on 28 March 1982. They defeated the Tigers 14–2, 
but finished in fifth place out of six teams with a .388 winning percentage. 
Choi Dong-won, Yu Do-yeol, and Sim Jae-won of the Korea national baseball 
team postponed joining the Giants to play for the country in the 1982 Amateur 
World Series held in Seoul. In 1984, the Giants won their first Korean 
Series title in the third season after the KBO League was launched. They 
beat the Samsung Lions 4–3 in the Korean Series. They were led by Choi 
Dong-won, one of the most dominant pitchers in Korea Professional Baseball 
league, who finished 1984 with 27 wins, 223 strikeouts, and a 2.40 ERA 
and won the regular season MVP Award.[3] In the 1984 Korean Series, he 
appeared in five out of seven games, had a 4–1 record (one shutout, three 
complete games, and one five-inning relief appearance), and pitched 40 
innings in ten days.[3] The Giants are the most popular team in the Korea 
Baseball Organization league.[4] According to a Gallup Korea's survey conducted 
in 2011, the Giants were chosen as the most popular team three times in 
a row.[4] They attracted over 1 million fans to Sajik Baseball Stadium 
in 1991 for the first time in the league. In the 2009 season, they set 
the all-time record of home attendance of 1,380,018 fans.[2] In the 2011 
season, they also led the league in the total home attendance with 1,358,322 
fans at 67 home games.[5] The average attendance was 20,273 fans per game, 
and therefore the stadium was about 71 percent full.[5] From 2008 to 2011, 
they drew over 1 million fans four years consecutively, which is the first 
time in Korean professional baseball history. Bullpen Closer Infielders
