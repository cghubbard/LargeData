Ronald Michael "Pop" Warner (born December 2, 1968, at Alhambra, California) 
is an American professional baseball coach, and a former minor league manager 
and player. Warner spent 2014 as manager of the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds 
of the Pacific Coast League, his third successive year in the post.[1] 
His professional career began in 1991 and its entirety has been spent in 
the St. Louis Cardinals' organization. On December 10, 2014, Warner was 
named the Cardinals' roving minor league infield coordinator, and was replaced 
as manager of the Redbirds by Mike Shildt.[2] Warner was selected in the 
17th round of the 1991 Major League Baseball Draft after graduating from 
the University of Wyoming. During his pro playing career (1991–1999) he 
played every infield position (although he was primarily a shortstop and 
second baseman) as well as corner outfield positions, and even pitched 
in three games. He threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet 3 inches 
(1.91 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). His career peaked at Triple-A 
with 307 games played between 1997–1999 with the Louisville and Memphis 
Redbirds. In 792 minor league games, he rang up 594 hits, including 40 
home runs, and batted .267.[3] In 2000, Warner retired as a player and 
spent the season as the batting practice pitcher for the Major League Cardinals. 
After working as a minor league coach in 2001–2002, he received his first 
managerial assignment in 2003 in the Rookie-level Appalachian League. He 
was a minor league coach again in 2004, then resumed his managerial career 
in the Cardinal farm system in 2005, progressing from Class A (Palm Beach 
Cardinals) in 2005–2006 to Double-A (Springfield Cardinals) from 2007–2011.[1] 
He was named manager of the Memphis Redbirds on November 21, 2011. Through 
eleven seasons as a manager, Warner has compiled a record of 734–730 (.501).[1]
