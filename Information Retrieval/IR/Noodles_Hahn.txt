Frank George "Noodles" Hahn (April 29, 1879 – February 6, 1960) was a starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Cincinnati Reds and 
New York Highlanders between 1899 and 1906. The left-hander posted a 130–94 
win-loss record with 917 strikeouts and a 2.55 earned run average in 1020-1/3 
innings pitched. Hahn was the first pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the 
20th century. He also struck out 16 batters in a single game in 1901, the 
highest major league total since the 1880s. Hahn completed veterinary school 
while playing for Cincinnati and he entered the profession after he retired 
from baseball. He worked out with the Reds on game days until he was almost 
70 years old. Hahn was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Hahn acquired his 
nickname as a child, but said that he did not know how he had gotten it. 
Hahn's biography from the Society for American Baseball Research suggests 
four possible origins for the nickname, all involving the fact that Hahn 
had frequently carried, sold or enjoyed noodle soup.[1] Before he turned 
15 years old, he signed a contract for $35 per month with a team in Clarksville, 
Tennessee. Hahn later talked about having to wait outside of saloons as 
his teammates went in for drinks. He moved on to the Southern League before 
reaching the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds at the age of 20.[2] 
During his first MLB season, Hahn threw a one-hit game to defeat the Louisville 
Colonels.[3] Though not armed with a powerful fastball, Hahn developed 
a reputation as a strikeout pitcher. Long after Hahn's retirement, sportswriter 
Grantland Rice described Hahn's pitching style. "Hahn was a left hander 
who belonged to the Herb Pennock, Eddie Plank school. He lacked the blazing 
speed of a Grove or a Rube Waddell, but he could tie up batters into more 
knots than 10 sailors could untie in a week. And you could see the seams 
on the ball as it came floating up", Rice wrote.[4] By 1900, Hahn was beginning 
to look at careers beyond baseball. Though his friends had urged him to 
develop his talent for piano, Hahn wanted to pursue the study of electricity. 
He made plans to work for a large Memphis electrical company in the offseason 
following the 1900 season.[5] He pitched the first no-hitter in the 20th 
century on July 12, 1900 against the Philadelphia Phillies. The day after 
being shut down by Hahn, the Phillies scored the most runs the team posted 
all year, defeating Pittsburgh 23–8.[6] Hahn led the NL in shutouts that 
season.[7] In 1901, Hahn recorded 22 wins but Cincinnati finished in last 
place.[8] He was the first NL pitcher to win 20 or more games with an eighth-place 
team.[9] Winning 22 of his team's 52 victories, Hahn accounted for the 
highest percentage of a team's victories until Steve Carlton won 27 of 
the 59 games that the Philadelphia Phillies won in 1972.[10] He led the 
league in innings pitched that season and was the league's strikeout leader 
for the third consecutive season.[7] In a 1901 game, Hahn struck out 16 
batters, the highest single-game total in any major league since 1887.[11] 
In February 1903, Hahn was a student at Cincinnati Veterinary College. 
Asked how long he planned to play baseball, he replied that he would like 
to play a few more seasons. Hahn had given up beer and liquor over the 
winter and said that he felt good going into the season, but he entertained 
the possibility that the coming year could be his last. Hahn planned to 
finish school the next winter and had thoughts of completing postgraduate 
work and taking a trip to Germany before beginning veterinary practice.[12] 
In 1904, Hahn turned down an offer to become the city veterinarian for 
Dallas, Texas and remained with the Cincinnati club.[13] During the 1905 
season, Cincinnati manager Joe Kelley announced that the team was searching 
for a left-handed pitcher who could replace Hahn. Kelley said, "While we 
have not lost confidence in Hahn, we realize that he can't last forever... 
he has already passed the limit that usually is fixed for southpaws in 
fast company, about five or six years at the most."[14] Hahn retired in 
1906 due to arm trouble. Using his education as a veterinary surgeon, he 
took a position as a government meat inspector in Cincinnati.[15] An Ohio 
newspaper issued an article in July 1908 stating that Hahn had pitched 
well in semipro baseball and that he would soon be back with the Reds.[16] 
In 1909, another newspaper report indicated that Hahn had sought medical 
attention for the arm issue and that he would attempt a major league comeback.[17] 
By 1910, Hahn was giving private instruction to pitching prospect Rube 
Benton, who Cincinnati had signed to a $6,000 contract.[18] After his retirement 
from baseball, Hahn continued to work out with the Reds on game days until 
he was at least 68 years old. Author Lee Allen wrote that the members of 
a Reds team in the 1940s did not know that Hahn had been a successful Reds 
pitcher until one of the players found an old newspaper clipping about 
him. Allen said that Hahn was "never one to get a rookie off in a corner 
and tell him how baseball used to be played or should be played. He was 
never a mine of information about the game, and was even reluctant to discuss 
his own career."[19] He died in Candler, North Carolina at the age of 80.
