Gene A. Budig (born May 25, 1939) was the last official president of Major 
League Baseball's American League from 1994 to 1999, when the presidencies 
of the American League and the National League were abolished. Budig graduated 
from the University of Nebraska. Budig served as president of Illinois 
State University from 1973–1977 and of West Virginia University from 1977–1980 
and was the chancellor of the University of Kansas from 1980-1994. A lecture 
hall at KU, Budig Hall, is named in his honor. Active in the Air National 
Guard, Budig retired at the rank of Major General in 1992. On June 8, 1994, 
Budig was named President of the American League. He served in that role 
for six seasons, before the position was officially abolished. In that 
role, Budig presented then-Yankee owner George Steinbrenner with the Commissioner's 
Trophy after the Yankees won the first World Series to be telecast by Fox 
in 1996, 4 games to 2. The trophy presentation was made in the Yankees' 
locker room at Yankee Stadium following Game 6. He also presented the trophy 
to the Yankees following their victories in 1998 and 1999. The position 
was abolished when Commissioner Bud Selig restructured Major League Baseball 
and eliminated the offices of American and National League President.[1] 
In January 2007, Budig became part-owner of the Charleston RiverDogs, a 
minor-league affiliate of the New York Yankees who play in the South Atlantic
