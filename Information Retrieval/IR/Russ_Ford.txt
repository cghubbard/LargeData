Russell William Ford (April 25, 1883 â€“ January 24, 1960) was a Major League 
Baseball pitcher during the dead-ball era of the early 1900s. Ford is best 
known as the creator of the "emery" or "scuff" ball, a pitch that was thrown 
with a ball that had been scuffed with a piece of emery. Ford came across 
the "scuff ball" by accident when playing for the Atlanta Crackers of the 
Southern Association in 1908.[1] When pitching under a grandstand due to 
rain, Ford accidentally threw a ball into a wooden upright, marking the 
surface.[1] Ford threw another pitch with the damaged ball, and noticed 
how it curved more than previous pitches.[1] Ford won 26 games in his rookie 
season of 1910, becoming only the third player in major league history 
to win 20 games and strike out at least 200 batters in his first season 
(Christy Mathewson and Grover Cleveland Alexander are the others). His 
pitch selection included the famed scuff/emery ball, a spitball, fastball, 
and knuckle ball.[2] Ford was elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of 
Fame in 1989 and into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 2002.
