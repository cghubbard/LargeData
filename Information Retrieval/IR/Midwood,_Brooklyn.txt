Coordinates: 40°37′24″N 73°57′42″W﻿ / ﻿40.623334°N 73.961678°W﻿ / 40.623334; 
-73.961678 Midwood is a neighborhood in the south-central part of the New 
York City borough of Brooklyn. It is within Community District 14; is patrolled 
by the 61st, 66th, and 70th precincts of the New York City Police Department; 
and is served by the New York City Fire Department at a station on East 
14th Street housing Engine 276, Ladder 156 and Battalion Chief 33. It is 
bounded on the north by the Bay Ridge Branch tracks just above Avenue I 
and Brooklyn College campus of the City University of New York, and on 
the south by Avenue P and Kings Highway. The eastern border is Nostrand 
Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, or Coney Island Avenue; with McDonald Avenue or 
Ocean Parkway as the western boundary.[1] The name, Midwood, derives from 
the Middle Dutch word, Midwout (middle woods; Modern Dutch: Midwoud), the 
name the settlers of New Netherland called the area of dense woodland midway 
between the towns of Boswyck (Bushwick) and Breuckelen (Brooklyn). Jan 
Snedeker, Jan Stryker, and Tomys Swartwout solicited from Director-General 
Stuyvesant the right of settling together on a level area of wilderness 
(vlacke bosch, the flat bush), adjacent to the outlying farms at Breukelen 
and Nieuw Amersfoort. Through Swartwout's suggestion, the settlement was 
named the village of Midwout or Midwolde. In April 1655, Stuyvesant and 
the Council of New Netherland appointed Swartwout a schepen (magistrate), 
to serve with Snedeker and Adriaen Hegeman as the Court of Midwout.[2] 
Later, it became part of old Flatbush, situated between the towns of Gravesend 
and Flatlands.[3] Settlement was begun by the Dutch in 1652;[2][3] they 
later gave way to the English, who conquered it in 1664, but the area remained 
rural and undeveloped for the most part until its annexation to the City 
of Brooklyn in the 1890s. It became more developed in the 1920s when large 
middle class housing tracts and apartment buildings were built.[4] Many 
Midwood residents moved to the suburbs in the 1970s, and the neighborhood 
and its commercial districts declined. Drawn by its quiet middle-class 
ambiance, new residents began pouring into Midwood during the 1980s; many 
of them were recently landed immigrants from all over the world. The largest 
group were from the Soviet Union, but substantial numbers also arrived 
from Jamaica, Haiti, Mexico, Guyana, and elsewhere in South America; from 
Ireland, Italy, Poland, the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), 
and elsewhere in eastern Europe; and from Greece, Turkey, Israel, Syria, 
the Persian Gulf states, Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, China, and 
Korea. In a short time, Midwood was transformed, from a predominantly Jewish 
neighborhood with a smattering of Irish-Americans and German-Americans, 
to a remarkably polyglot section of the borough of Brooklyn. Many residents 
refer to Midwood as "Flatbush," or, erroneously, as being "part of Flatbush", 
an older and more established neighborhood and former township, which in 
the 19th century included modern Midwood. The usage of Flatbush to mean 
Midwood dates to the period when the neighborhood was first formed, and 
known as South Greenfield.[5] This usage is especially common among Orthodox 
Jews. Many also consider the nearby neighborhood of Fiske Terrace/Midwood 
Gardens to be part of Midwood, but, as in many cities, neighborhood boundaries 
in Brooklyn are somewhat fluid and poorly defined. The main shopping streets 
in the area are Kings Highway, Avenue J, Avenue M, Flatbush Avenue, Nostrand 
Avenue, and Coney Island Avenue. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Kings 
Highway had Dubrow's Cafeteria, a classic cafeteria where holes would be 
punched in patrons' printed tickets, which would total the cost of the 
meal. It was a popular place to eat and socialize. In his run for the White 
House, Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy held a massive 
campaign rally just outside Dubrow's Cafeteria. A huge crowd of people 
turned out to hear this popular political icon speak, stretching for blocks 
in all directions. Years later, his brother Senator Robert F. Kennedy ("Bobby") 
held a similar campaign rally there for his run for President, with a similarly 
large audience. The community has long been known as a Democratic stronghold. 
Additionally, "Levine's" was the king of the bar mitzvah suit trade, and 
"Jimmy's" catered to high fashion customers. Kings Highway was home to 
the now famed Crazy Eddie Electronics Empire. The first Original Crazy 
Eddie store was located on Kings Hwy., then moved to larger quarters just 
south of Kings Highway on Coney Island Avenue. A branch of the Brooklyn 
Public Library can be found on the east side of Ocean Avenue just south 
of Kings Highway. There were three movie theaters on Kings Highway, the 
"Kingsway", the Jewel and the "Avalon" (which closed in 1982). Visitors 
to Kings Highway are amused by the colored holiday-style lights that are 
strung across above the street and feature a lighted gold "Kings Crown" 
at a few intersections. In the fall of 2008, the NYCDOT planned to implement 
an experimental congestion parking plan in the Kings Highway Business District, 
which would have raised parking meter rates from 75 cents to as much as 
$2.50 an hour. Specific streets were not then designated.[6] Kings Highway 
is currently anchored by several chain stores, such as Rite-Aid, Petland 
Discount, and TJ Maxx, and multiple ethnic food stores. Unique businesses 
include the ornate Amazon Caffe (kosher dairy), Kings Games (the largest 
gaming center in New York City), several high fashion outlets, jewelry 
stores, and sushi restaurants. In the 1960s and the early 1970s, Nostrand 
Avenue between Avenues M and N was considered one of New York's best streets 
for shopping by New York magazine.[citation needed] The street was known 
for fashionable boutiques such as "Edna Nelkin's Jewelry," America's finest 
children's wear boutique, "Greenstone's" (now located on both Columbus 
and Madison Avenues in Manhattan), "Burton's", "Shirtland", and "The Shoe 
Box". As retailers retired, the street changed and became known for its 
automobile showrooms, including Plaza Honda. A U.S. Postal Service Facility 
(Zip Code 11210) can be found on Nostrand Ave. between Avenues I and J. 
Avenue M, the heart of Midwood, is the central location for kosher food 
and butchers. While in the past it was home to Cookie's, one of Brooklyn's 
best known restaurants and hang-outs (also popular with the NBC studio 
staff), today there are no fewer than 9 kosher restaurants and 3 kosher 
bakeries. From the 1920s through the 1940s, the "Dorman Square Restaurant" 
was popular with the Vitagraph studios employees, as well as playing a 
role in a Vitagraph film or two. One of Brooklyn's most legendary Italian 
restaurants, "Restaurant Bonaparte", also catered to the actors and actresses 
working on Avenue M in the NBC studios at that time. Restaurant Bonaparte 
was known for its "Three Musketeers". It also had a wishing well fountain 
in its lobby entrance, filled with customers' coins. The Avenue has an 
elevated subway station. Until the 1970s, Avenue M had its own movie theater, 
The Century "Elm" (later an Emigrant Savings Bank branch, now a branch 
of Apple Bank for Savings). Near the end of June each year, the Midwood 
Development Corporation hosts the popular Midwood Mardi Gras Street Fair 
along The Avenue, from East 12th St. to Ocean Avenue. Shoppers can find 
a municipal muni-meter parking lot on East 17th Street at Chestnut Ave. 
just north of Avenue M. Many of the retail businesses are closed on the 
Jewish Sabbath and Higher Holy Days. Notable exceptions are 7–11, Pete's 
Pizza, Dunkin' Donuts, Chock Full O' Nuts, as well as some other non-Jewish-owned 
establishments like Chinese restaurants, Russian bakeries, grocers, fruit 
markets and newsstands. Avenue J is a low-key commercial strip, with many 
kosher restaurants, deli, pizzerias, and butchers. Di Fara Pizza (at E. 
15th St.) was cited by the 2008 Zagat Survey as "The Best Pizza in NYC." 
At $5.00 for a regular slice, DiFara's Pizza is the only non-kosher pizzeria 
on Ave J, likely only thriving due to its high-quality pizza, and there 
is usually a waiting line outside to get in. Others specialize more narrowly, 
such as one bakery concentrating on Russian bread. Ostrovitsky's Bakery 
sells gourmet cookies and cakes. A number of large fruit grocers such as 
Fruit Palace and Blue Ribbon offer high quality produce at competitive 
prices. A large selection of exotic dried fruits and nuts can be found 
at "Oh Nuts!" There was also once a Cookie's restaurant on the corner of 
East 16th St. and Ave. J. A branch of the Brooklyn Public Library can be 
found on East 16th. St. just north of Avenue J. The avenue had its own 
movie theater simply named the "Midwood" Theater (closed in the early 1980s). 
But Avenue J can also be hectic during weekdays, with much foot and vehicle 
traffic, and finding a parking spot is a big problem. Many of the retail 
businesses are closed on the Jewish Sabbath and Higher Holy Days. Notable 
exceptions are Walgreens, Associated Supermarkets, and grocers and newsstands 
serving the Muslim community. On Coney Island Avenue in Midwood, primarily 
between Avenue H and Avenue P, are the U.S. Postal Service Midwood station 
(Zip Code 11230), The "Kent Triplex Movie Theater", and other assorted 
retailers. Between Avenue O and Quentin Road are Turkish restaurants and 
a hookah bar. Near Avenue L what was believed to be the largest all-kosher 
supermarket in the United States opened in August 2008.[7] The 20,000-square-foot 
(1,900 m2) Pomegranate was "also hoping to lure customers who don't keep 
kosher with its array of organic meats and chemical-free produce."[8] Parks 
consist of Kolbert Park and the Rachel Haber Cohen Playground and adjacent 
handball and basketball courts,[9] near Edward R. Murrow High School, and 
the track and playing fields of Brooklyn College and Midwood High School. 
Local Yeshiva boys often play basketball during lunch breaks at Kolbert 
Park. Kolbert is also very popular with many Russian male Seniors who can 
be seen heavily engaged in daily board games such as Chess. Long-time and 
past residents alike still refer to Kolbert Park as simply "Avenue L Park." 
Another park is "Friends Field" at East Second Street and Avenue L. The 
park is popular with baseball-playing Yeshiva boys on Friday afternoons. 
"Friends Field" features Baseball Diamonds and Tennis Courts. Just opposite 
Friends Field along McDonald Avenue is the Erasmus Hall High School Football 
Field (Closed to the public when not in use). The Sprawling Square block-long 
Midwood High School Field (East 16th–17th Street at Avenues K-L) features 
handball courts, tennis courts, a runners track and a field used for football, 
rugby and soccer. It is quite visible to passengers on the adjacent BMT 
Subway line. NYPD-FDNY Charity Sporting Games, as well as NY-based Daytime 
TV "Soap Opera" Cast Baseball Games are often held there- (The studios 
used for CBS TV's "As The World Turns" is nearby). Annual NYC Public School 
JV Varsity Football Championship and Playoff Games are held there as well. 
Students from adjacent Edward R. Murrow High School also use the field 
during school hours. For historical purposes, in 1977, Current Borough 
President Marty Markowitz ("Mr. Brooklyn"), (then known as State Senator 
Markowitz), and other pols began the Annual "Midwood Field Concerts" Series 
at the Midwood High School Field. The concert series was later moved to 
its present home at Asser Levy Park (along Sea Breeze Avenue) in Brighton 
Beach (opposite the NY Aquarium), and is these days is known as the "Seaside 
Summer Concert Series" (held Thursday evening's July and August of each 
year). There are two popular public pedestrian "rest" spots within the 
community. The first is 'Corporal Wiltshire Square', named in Honor of 
Corporal Clifford T. Wiltshire, located at the intersection of Ocean Avenue 
where it merges with Avenue P and Kings Highway. The other is 'Sgt. Joyce 
Kilmer Triangle', located at the crossroads of Kings Highway and Quentin 
Road (E. 12th–13th Streets), so named in honor of American journalist and 
poet Sgt. Joyce Kilmer (1866–1918). Kilmer is a second cousin of American 
Actor Val Kilmer. Midwood is a diverse multi-ethnic and multi-religious 
neighborhood; however, the neighborhood is predominately Jewish. In the 
1980s and 1990s, a wave of Orthodox Jews moved into the area from Borough 
Park, attracted by Midwood's large homes and tree-lined streets. Today, 
in addition to European Orthodox Jews, the area is home to a burgeoning 
Sephardic population. Along Kings Highway from Coney Island to McDonald 
Avenues are many Middle Eastern restaurants and take-out food shops. The 
East Midwood Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue, was founded in 1924. 
The building, located on Ocean Avenue, is a 1929 Renaissance revival structure 
with a capacity of 950 in the main sanctuary. It was listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places in 2006.[10][11] The Kingsway Jewish Center 
is an historic synagogue from the 1950s on Nostrand Avenue. It was listed 
on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.[12] There are several 
branches of Touro College there, a college that was started in 1970. Midwood 
is also home to several large orthodox synagogues, including the Young 
Israel of Midwood,[13] Agudas Yisroel Bais Binyomin of Avenue L, Congregation 
Talmud Torah of Flatbush, the minyan factory known as Landau's Shul (offering 
minyanim every 15 minutes on an average day), Rabbi Avraham Schorr's former 
Synagogue, known as Khal Tiferes Yaakov on East 15th Street and Avenue 
L, The Bostoner Rebbe on Avenue J, Steinwurtzels, The Young Israel of Avenue 
J, The Agudah of Midwood, and several Syrian Orthodox synagogues.[14] Synagogues 
based out of homes, called Shtiebelach, are also common. In November 2009, 
the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary agency of the 
UJA-Federation of New York, partnered with Masbia to open a kosher soup 
kitchen on Coney Island Avenue.[15] On November 12, 2011, four cars were 
torched, and many Ku Klux Klan icons, swastikas, and other hate symbols 
were spray-painted on benches and other items. The following day, state 
Assemblyman Dov Hikind and state Sen. Eric Adams joined a protest march 
the against the hate crime.[16] St. Brendan's Parish and Our Lady Help 
of Christians are two Roman Catholic Church congregations located in Midwood. 
The Church of the Three Hierarchs Greek Orthodox serves the Greek residents 
of the community. The Episcopal Church of the Epiphany also serves the 
community. The area around Newkirk Avenue has one of the largest mosques 
in Brooklyn, the Muslim Community Center of Brooklyn, also known as Makki 
Masjid.[17] East of Ocean Avenue, the community is also known as "East 
Midwood" or "Nottingham". The volunteer ambulance service serving Midwood 
is Flatbush Hatzoloh. The nearest hospitals are New York Presbyterian Community 
Hospital, and Beth Israel Kings Highway. Both are certified "9-1-1 FDNY-EMS" 
receiving emergency facilities. Currently many homes within the community 
are valued at more than 500 thousand dollars, with some over a million 
dollars. One of Brooklyn's last remaining farms was located on the site 
of the apartment complex at 1279 East 17th St. (just north of Ave. M) until 
it was torn down in the mid-1960s. The elm tree is the community's official 
tree, and one local street is named Elm Avenue as a homage to that. The 
area is served by the New York City Subway's BMT Brighton Line (B Q trains), 
IND Culver Line (F train), and the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line (2 5 trains). 
MTA New York City Transit routes serving the community include the B2, 
B6, B7, B9, B11, B31, B41, B44, B49, B68, B82 local buses and the B44 SBS 
Select Bus Service bus. MTA Bus Company routes include the B100, B103 local 
buses and the BM2, BM3, BM4 express buses. Midwood has long played a part 
in both film and television production. The film industry established itself 
in the neighborhood in 1907, when the Vitagraph company occupied studios 
at 1277 East 14th near Avenue M. Scenes from films like "Hey Pop" and "Buzzin' 
Around," starring Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, were filmed on streets in Midwood.[18] 
Warner Bros. purchased the studio in the 1920s, using it for short subjects, 
and moved the studio operation to Hollywood in 1939.[19] Until 2015 the 
building was home to the Shulamith Yeshiva School for Girls,[1] which moved 
to Manhattan Beach. A large smokestack bearing the name Vitagraph is still 
on the property, visible from the BMT Brighton Line, as are two brick walls 
from the original studio. Many Vitagraph Employees resided within the community. 
After Warner Bros. vacated the land (in the late 1960s-early 1970s), Yeshiva 
University purchased it for Brooklyn Torah Academy, the Brooklyn branch 
of their high school. The Shulamith School purchased the property some 
years later, when it merged BTA into Manhattan Torah Academy. Present day, 
many within the community have no clue that the Shulamith School buildings 
and property were once a film studio in its heyday. The Brooklyn Historical 
Society and the Museum of the Moving Image (Astoria, New York) have collections 
on The Vitagraph Studios. One present-day, longterm resident possesses 
a small but "private" collection (and wealth of history) on the Vitagraph 
Studios.[citation needed] An Old Vintage aerial photograph of The Vitagraph 
Complex (and its streets) hangs today on a wall in the Offices of the Midwood 
Development Corporation. The Vitagraph Studios were later featured in a 
New York Times Article (2007), and in the PBS, WNET-13 TV Special 'A Walk 
Through Brooklyn,' hosted by David Hartman and historian Barry Lewis. Old 
historic photographs of the studio show that part of it also existed across 
the Brighton line subway tracks where Edward R. Murrow High School now 
stands. "The Leading Male" men's attire store, which was once located at 
the corner of Kings Highway and East 12th Street, was the source for the 
disco attire that John Travolta and the other male cast members wore in 
the film Saturday Night Fever. A duplicate of the white suit Travolta wore 
in the film was at that time displayed in one of the showcase windows. 
In 1952, NBC Television purchased part of the Vitagraph Studios, which 
then became known as NBC Brooklyn. Studio 1 is along Locust Avenue. A new 
larger studio known as Color Studio 2 is at 1268 East 14th Street, on the 
northwest corner of its intersection with Avenue M. Programs including 
The Perry Como Variety Show, TV's adaptation of Broadway's Peter Pan with 
Mary Martin, The Sammy Davis, Jr. Variety Show, the nighttime version of 
the quiz show Tic Tac Dough, Sing Along With Mitch Miller (And His "Sing-Along 
Gang") (1961–64) which featured a then-young singer named Leslie Uggams, 
who years later became best known for her role in the historic TV epic 
Roots, were all taped there for later broadcast. Old NBC press releases 
show that two of the earliest shows to emanate from there (both then considered 
early NBC "Big Specials") were The Esther Williams Aqua Special (October 
29, 1956), and Satins & Spurs (10/12/1954). The same Brooklyn studios were 
used in more recent decades to broadcast the soap opera Another World (1964–99), 
Another World "spin-off" soap drama Somerset (1971–76), the situation comedy 
The Cosby Show, and three 1975 episodes of Saturday Night Live. There was 
also an NBC News NASA Apollo Space Mission Special taped here, a short-lived 
mystery detective drama, and a weekly circus variety show (the later two 
for another network). Bill Cosby and crew after a period of time relocated 
the show to their new home at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens. 
The "second" NBC Cosby Show that followed (co-starring Madeline Kahn, most 
notably of Mel Brooks hit comedy films Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein) 
was also taped at Kaufman Astoria Studios.[20] In 1965–66, the studios 
were also home to Hullabaloo, a popular weekly NBC prime-time musical variety 
series, produced by Gary Smith and Dwight Hemion (Smith being best known 
for producing Barbra Streisand TV specials). Hullabaloo first aired on 
NBC on the evening of December 1, 1965, and its final episode was aired 
on 4/11/66. The program featured bands at the top of the music charts, 
singers and other celebrity entertainers of the period such as Sonny & 
Cher and Tina Sinatra, and many performers from the so-called British Invasion, 
like The Rolling Stones, Herman's Hermits, The Dave Clark Five, Petula 
Clark, Marianne Faithfull, The Moody Blues, and Donovan. It first originated 
from the NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and its premiere was hosted 
by Jack Jones. After a brief period of time the program was moved east 
to NBC Color Studio 2 in Midwood. During its New York heyday a few episodes 
were also recorded at NBC's headquarters studios in Rockefeller Center. 
Brian Epstein, manager of The Beatles, also hosted a Hullabaloo program 
from London. Neither The Beatles nor Elvis Presley were ever a guest or 
host of the aforementioned variety shows, however.[20] The Sammy Davis, 
Jr. show was taped in the much smaller Studio 1 located along Locust Ave. 
The audience entrance was on the northernmost part of East 13th, opposite 
the outdoor scenic storage yard. In the early 1970s the NBC TV variety 
show Kraft Music Hall was taped in Studio 2. Ed McMahon, country music 
star Eddy Arnold, and John Davidson were frequent hosts. Guests included 
Johnny Cash, Simon & Garfunkel, Woody Allen, Wayne Newton, Bill Dana, Alan 
King, Bobby Darin, Dionne Warwick, her sister Dee Dee Warwick, Mitzi Gaynor, 
Roy Rogers and his wife Dale Evans, and many others. Desi Arnaz hosted 
one episode. His ex-wife actress/TV icon comedian Lucille Ball and her 
kids specifically flew in from Hollywood to cheer him on, on this his return 
to TV. One memorable episode of the Kraft Music Hall program was hosted 
by comedian Don Rickles, which featured him walking off a Coney Island–bound 
Brighton Line subway train at the Avenue M station, then speaking about 
old Brooklyn memories, old childhood street games of the past while walking 
the avenue, then playing a game of "Kick-the-Can" and New York-style stickball, 
all actually taped on location on East 15th Street between Avenue M and 
the old Vitagraph Studios building at Chestnut Avenue.[20] Many of the 
noted variety shows (with the exception of Mitch Miller) had a live studio 
audience for both rehearsals and/or actual show recording. Often NBC Guest 
Relations staff could be found standing on the street outside the studio 
offering free tickets to the dress rehearsals and/or the actual taping 
of those 1960s programs, and sometimes even The Cosby Show. The only exception 
to that was the brief Saturday Night Live stint at the studio (which was 
pre-filled to capacity) as well as "big name" guest or host show tapings 
(e.g. The Rolling Stones or Desi Arnaz, especially with the presence of 
Lucille Ball at the studio to cheer on Arnaz). NBC Guest Relations operated 
a charter bus to/from their Rockefeller Center headquarters to the Brooklyn 
studio for pre-ticketed 1960s audience members, so that they did not have 
to travel by car or subway. They also did so for The Cosby Show. Fans in 
the know could always be found outside the studio entrance waiting to greet 
their favorite celebrity, many of whom in turn were happy to stop and chat, 
sign an autograph, pose for a photo, all without the hassle of present-day 
out-of-control paparazzi. From the 1950s through the original Cosby Show 
years, the NBC Brooklyn studio presence in Midwood basically transformed 
the community's Avenue M into Brooklyn's own versions of Broadway and Hollywood. 
Fond memories of the great many "A-List" celebrities that had performed 
inside the former NBC Studios and walked the local streets still exist 
today. Now, many within the community, and visitors alike, do not even 
know that a television production studio exists at the location, nor that 
the adjacent present-day Shulamith School property was once an early major 
silent film studio. A few old classic episodes of Perry Como, Hullabaloo, 
and Kraft Music Hall (taped at the studio) can be found on VHS and DVD, 
as well as on YouTube. The Museum of Television and Radio (New York and 
Los Angeles) has a collection on the noted television programs.[20] NBC 
sold the studio in 2000.[20] The facility became JC Studios. The CBS soap 
opera As the World Turns was taped here from January 2000 until June 2010. 
The series was cancelled after 54 years. The final episode aired on September 
17, 2010. When NBC Brooklyn Color Studio 2 was built, the studio was at 
the time said to be "the largest color TV production studio in America", 
rivaling Pinewood Studios just west of London. According to the NYC Mayor's 
Office Of Film, Television and Theater, the building consists of Stage 
1, which is 11,200 sq ft (163' × 70', w/a 24-foot (7.3 m) ceiling height), 
and Stage 2 which is 9,700 sq ft (130' × 75', with a 38'-10" ceiling height).[21] 
There are 31 dressing rooms, two control rooms, hair, makeup and dressing 
areas, and one edit suite. Two very large and visible NBC 'N' logo signs 
were placed on the East 13th and 14th Street upper parts of the big Red 
Brick Studio 2 Building on Avenue M until The Cosby Show years. To the 
dismay of many remaining long-time residents,[who?] both were taken down 
when NBC vacated the premises, prior to the studios being sold to JC Studios. 
In 2014, JC Studios closed. In June 2015, OHEL Children's Home and Family 
Services began creating offices in the former Studio 1 on Locust Avenue, 
part of the original Vitagraph Studios. Studio 2, built by NBC, will become 
a self-storage facility. The nearby Edward R. Murrow High School offers 
its students classes in television production and had its own student-produced 
local Public-access television program on BCAT called T.E.R.M. Many of 
its former students are currently employed in some form of television production, 
including news at WNBC and Fox 5 WNYW.[citation needed] Among movies and 
TV shows that have been filmed in Midwood are: It is also mentioned in 
the quote "Midwood, Brooklyn, A Community From Which Great Television Entertainment 
Has Emanated ... from Perry Como to the '60s Hip Hullabaloo to 'The Cosby
