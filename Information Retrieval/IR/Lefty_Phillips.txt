Harold Ross "Lefty" Phillips (May 16, 1919 – June 12, 1972) was an American 
coach, manager, scout and front office executive in Major League Baseball. 
Phillips was the second manager in Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim franchise 
history. A native of Los Angeles, Phillips attended Franklin High School. 
He was a left-handed pitcher in his playing days but, because of a sore 
arm, his professional playing career consisted of fewer than five games 
with the Bisbee Bees of the Class D Arizona–Texas League in 1939. With 
his playing days behind him, Phillips embarked on his scouting career in 
his early 20s, working for the St. Louis Browns. After the Second World 
War, Phillips returned to baseball and became a highly respected scout 
for the Cincinnati Reds (1948–50) and the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers 
(1952–64). Among the players he signed for the Dodgers were Baseball Hall 
of Fame pitcher Don Drysdale and 21-year MLB veteran Ron Fairly.[1] He 
also signed future Hall of Fame manager Sparky Anderson to his first playing 
contract in 1953. In 1965, Phillips reached the Major Leagues when he was 
named pitching coach of the Dodgers. During his first two seasons in that 
post, he worked with Hall of Famers Drysdale, Sandy Koufax and Don Sutton, 
as Los Angeles won back-to-back National League pennants and the 1965 World 
Series. Although the Dodgers fell back in the standings in 1967–68, after 
Koufax' retirement, they still boasted one of the strongest pitching staffs 
in the majors. At the end of the 1968 season, Phillips joined former Dodger 
executive Dick Walsh in the Angels' front office. Walsh was appointed general 
manager, while Phillips was named to the high-ranking post of director 
of player personnel. But when the Angels started only 11–28 in 1969 under 
their longtime (and original) manager, Bill Rigney, Phillips was asked 
to return to the field, first as a coach, and then as Rigney's replacement 
on May 27, despite his never before having managed in the minor leagues 
or in MLB. The Angels responded to Phillips, however, improving from sixth 
(last) place to third in the American League West Division in 1969 and 
then—led by batting champion Alex Johnson—winning 86 games in 1970 to again 
finish third. But Johnson was a disciplinary problem. In 1971 he was suspended 
by Phillips five times for lack of hustle (culminating in a season-long 
suspension beginning June 26) and the Angels won only 76 games. Walsh and 
Phillips were fired at the end of the season,[2] and Johnson was traded.[3] 
Phillips' record in 2½ seasons as Angel manager was 222–225 (.497). Phillips 
then resumed his scouting career with the Angels, but in June 1972, he 
was fatally stricken with an attack of asthma. He died in Fullerton, California, 
at age 53.[4] He is buried at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in
