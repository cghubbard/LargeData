As player As coach Leon "Bull" Durham (born July 31, 1957) is a former 
first baseman and outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for 10 
seasons, a longtime minor league hitting coach, and the current assistant 
hitting coach of the Detroit Tigers. Durham played with the St. Louis Cardinals 
(1980, 1989), Chicago Cubs (1981-1988), and Cincinnati Reds (1988). Durham 
batted and threw left-handed. Durham graduated from Cincinnati Woodward 
High School in 1976 where he was a high school All-American selection his 
senior year, posting a .385 batting average with 16 home runs and an 11-3 
record as a pitcher. Durham was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in 
the 1976 amateur draft in the first round and 15th overall. Durham made 
his major league debut on May 27, 1980 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He 
was traded that off-season to the Cubs for Bruce Sutter, and his career 
took off. He hit 10 home runs and drove in 55 runs in a strike-shortened 
1981 season, then followed that with a stellar 1982 season in which he 
had a .312 batting average with 22 homers, 90 RBI, and 28 stolen bases. 
He won the Silver Slugger Award as the Cubs' left fielder and made the 
All-Star team. He followed that with a hot first half in 1983 of 12 homers 
and 55 RBI and another All-Star Game appearance, but was injured shortly 
after the break and missed the rest of the season. In 1984, the Cubs made 
several team-improving deals. They acquired Bob Dernier and Gary Matthews 
from the Phillies, moved Keith Moreland to right field, and Durham to first 
base. Durham essentially supplanted Bill Buckner, who was then dealt to 
the Red Sox for Dennis Eckersley. Durham responded with another stellar 
year by hitting .279 with 23 homers and 96 RBIs as the Cubs won the National 
League East. For good measure, Durham homered in both Games 4 and 5 of 
the 1984 NLCS. Durham would follow that season with three more consecutive 
20-homer seasons, including a career-high 27 in 1987. However, his RBI 
totals decreased from 96 in 1984 to 75, 65, and 63, respectively. In 1988, 
Durham got off to a miserable start, hitting only .218 with 3 homers after 
21 games. Mark Grace began to see more time at first, and the Cubs traded 
Durham to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Perry amid rumors of drug use. Durham 
played in only 21 games for the Reds that season before entering into drug 
and alcohol rehabilitation. He tried a comeback with the Cardinals the 
next season, but only went 1 for 18 before retiring. He missed getting 
his pension by 10 games[1] In a 10-year Major League career, Durham compiled 
a lifetime batting average of .277, hitting 147 home runs and driving in 
530 runs. Leon Durham is widely remembered for an error that he made at 
first base during the 1984 National League Championship Series. In the 
bottom of the seventh inning in the decisive fifth game[2] between Durham's 
Chicago Cubs and the San Diego Padres, the Padres sent pinch-hitter Tim 
Flannery to face the Cubs' ace pitcher Rick Sutcliffe. Through the top 
of the sixth inning, the Cubs had a 3-0 lead. In the bottom of the sixth 
inning, the Padres cut the Cubs' lead to 3-2 with a pair of singles by 
Alan Wiggins and Tony Gwynn, a walk to Steve Garvey, and sacrifice flies 
by Graig Nettles and Terry Kennedy. The bottom of the seventh inning kicked 
off with Carmelo Martínez walking on four pitches from Sutcliffe. Garry 
Templeton then sacrificed Martínez to second, setting things up for Tim 
Flannery. Martinez would then score when Flannery hit a sharp grounder 
that trickled through Leon Durham's legs for an error. Groundball hit to 
Durham...RIGHT THROUGH HIS LEGS!!! Here comes Martínez, we're tied at three! 
The error became known as the "Gatorade Glove Play" because before taking 
his position in the field that inning, Gatorade was spilled on Durham's 
glove. Some Cub fans believe the Gatorade spilled on Durham's glove amounted 
to a curse, similar to the goat and Bartman curses of Cub lore. The play 
would also turn out to be very similar, in style and effect, to Bill Buckner's 
much-discussed error in the 1986 World Series. The coincidental connection 
between these two events is that Durham had been moved from the outfield 
to first base during the 1984 season, replacing Buckner after the Cubs 
traded him to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Dennis Eckersley. Buckner's 
error, like Durham's, would be seen as turning a post-season series around. 
The same joke even circulated for both incidents: That they had been despondent, 
jumped in front of a moving truck, and "the truck went between their legs". 
The Padres wound up winning the game 6-3 to reach the World Series for 
the first time ever. What was especially frustrating was the fact that 
the Cubs had a 2 games to 0 lead (1984 marked the last time that the League 
Championship Series was a best-of-five series) over the Padres. Durham 
previously served as the hitting coach for the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A 
affiliate the Toledo Mud Hens. On October 21, 2016, he was named the assistant 
hitting coach of the Detroit Tigers, after 17 seasons as a coach with the 
Mud Hens.[3] Durham has been married over 30 years to his wife Angela; 
they have 3 children: Ashley Lauren, Ian, and Lance. They have two granddaughters 
and one grandson. Durham and his wife currently reside in Cincinnati, Ohio.
