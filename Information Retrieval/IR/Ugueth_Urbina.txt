Rangers on December 23, 2002. He went 0-4 with 26 saves and a 4.19 ERA 
in 39 games for the Rangers in 2003 before being traded during the midseason. 
On July 11, 2003, Urbina was traded by Texas to the Florida Marlins in 
exchange for Adrian Gonzalez, Ryan Snare, and a minor leaguer. For the 
remainder of the season, Urbina served as a setup man for Marlins closer 
Braden Looper, going 3-0 with six saves and a 1.41 ERA in 33 games. He 
posted a combined record of 3-4 with 32 saves and a 2.81 ERA in 54 appearances

York Yankees in six games. During his only postseason in the majors, he 
went 1-0 along with four saves and a 3.46 ERA in 10 games. Urbina signed 
a two-year contract with the Detroit Tigers on March 29, 2004. That marked 
his last year where he was closer for at least part of the season. In 54 
games, he went 4-6 with 21 saves and a 4.50 ERA. He began the 2005 season 
in good form, collecting a 1-3 record with a 2.63 ERA while contributing 
with nine saves, but then found himself on the move again for the third 
time in his career. On June 8, 2005, the Tigers traded Urbina along with 
infielder Ramón Martínez to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for second

October 2, 2005, during a 9–3 Phillies victory over the Washington Nationals 
at RFK Stadium.[3] Urbina's pitches included a moving fastball and a slider 
that enabled him to hold left-handed hitters in check. He also threw a 
changeup which tailed away from right-handers and a splitter that broke 
sharply.[4] In September 2004, Urbina's 54-year-old mother, Maura Villarreal, 
was kidnapped and held for a $6 million ransom in southwest Venezuela. 
Urbina's family refused to pay the ransom and an anti-kidnapping unit rescued 
her in a military-style operation on February 18, 2005.[5] On November 
7, 2005, Urbina was arrested by Venezuelan authorities on a charge of attempted 
murder for an incident that occurred a few weeks previous, on October 16.[6] 
Urbina attacked five farm workers on his property whom he had accused of 
stealing a gun. The pitcher tried to injure the men with a machete and 
also attempted to pour gasoline on them.[7] On March 28, 2007, Urbina was 
convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to fourteen years and seven 
months in prison.[8] He was released, however, on December 24, 2012, after 
serving just over seven years of his sentence.[9] Urbina has a son Juan 
who pitched in the Mets organization never making it past single A short
