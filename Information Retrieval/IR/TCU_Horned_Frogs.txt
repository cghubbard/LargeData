The TCU Horned Frogs are the athletic teams that represent Texas Christian 
University, consisting of 18 varsity teams. The "horned frog" nickname 
and mascot refer to the Texas horned lizard, also known as the "horned 
frog".[2] The teams participate in the NCAA Division I and in the Football 
Bowl Subdivision (FBS) for football competing in the Big 12 Conference. 
On October 10, 2011, TCU announced that it had accepted an invitation to 
join the Big 12 Conference.[3] Texas Christian University began its athletic 
life as an independent program with a six-year (1914–1920) stint in the 
Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association before eventually joining its 
longtime home, the Southwest Conference (SWC), in 1923. TCU remained a 
member of the SWC until it disbanded after the 1995–96 academic year when 
the University of Texas, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University and 
Baylor University defected from the conference to form the Big 12 Conference 
together with the members of the Big Eight Conference; the University of 
Arkansas had previously left for the Southeastern Conference in 1990, in 
the aftermath of the Southern Methodist University football scandal, leaving 
the SWC with no presence outside of the state of Texas). The Horned Frogs, 
without a conference to call home after 72 years, joined the Western Athletic 
Conference (WAC), along with SMU and Rice. TCU called the WAC home from 
1996 through 2000. In 2001, TCU joined Conference USA (C-USA) and remained 
there through 2004. TCU joined the Mountain West Conference (MWC) in 2005. 
In 2010, TCU accepted an invitation to join the Big East Conference in 
all sports starting in 2012; however, on October 10, 2011, TCU announced 
that it had reversed its decision and would be joining the Big 12 (headquartered 
in another Metroplex city, Irving) in 2012 instead, a move that went into 
effect July 1.[3] Texas Christian University sponsors teams in nine men's 
and twelve women's NCAA sanctioned sports:[4] Men's intercollegiate sports 
Women's intercollegiate sports The return of national prominence of TCU 
football began under the watch of Dennis Franchione when TCU defeated the 
Trojans of USC in the 1998 Sun Bowl. From 1939, the year after TCU's last 
national championship, to 1997, TCU's record was 314–383–24.[6] In those 
67 years, TCU won 6 Southwest Conference titles and attended 11 bowl games 
winning only one of those games. Since the 1998 season, TCU has won 6 conference 
titles, two in the Western Athletic Conference (1999 & 2000), one in Conference 
USA (2002), and three in the Mountain West Conference (2005, 2009, and 
2010). Since 1998, TCU has amassed a record of 79–30. In four of the last 
five years, the Horned Frogs have won at least 10 games in a season, and 
won 11 games in three of the last four. During this period TCU has won 
games against Louisville, Oklahoma, Texas Tech, Utah and BYU. From 1998 
to 2006, TCU has attended 8 bowl games, winning five of them. The record 
of TCU in bowl games as of 2006 is 9–13–1.[7] TCU also claims two national 
championships from 1935 and 1938.[8][9] TCU has 41 1st team All-Americans, 
listed at TCU Horned Frogs football. The school's most famous past players 
include Rags Matthews, Sammy Baugh, Davey O'Brien (a Heisman Trophy winner, 
and namesake of the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award), Johnny Vaught 
(later one of the most celebrated coaches of the University of Mississippi), 
Ki Aldrich, Darrell Lester, Jim Swink, Sonny Gibbs, Norm Bulaich, Bob Lilly, 
Kenneth Davis, 2006–07 NFL MVP LaDainian Tomlinson and two-time consensus 
All-American Jerry Gaither. TCU have achieved success under numerous coaches 
including Matty Bell, L.D. "Dutch" Meyer, Abe Martin, Dennis Franchione, 
and current coach Gary Patterson. Gary Patterson received nine National 
Coach of the Year honors in 2009.[10] Coaches Matthews, Baugh, O'Brien, 
Aldrich, Lester, Swink, Lilly, and Dutch Meyer are all members of the College 
Football Hall of Fame. Baugh and Lilly are also members of the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame. The TCU Football team plays its games in Amon G. Carter Stadium. 
The stadium opened in 1930 and has a capacity of 44,008.[11] On December 
5, 2010 the west wing of the Amon G. Carter Stadium was imploded in order 
accommodate 24 suites, including six Founder's suites on the lower level, 
and 2,300 club seats on the West side.[12] Total cost of the renovation 
of Amon G. Carter Stadium is $105 million. TCU has fielded a baseball team 
since 1896, before the school found its home in Fort Worth, TX. The Horned 
Frog baseball team began playing baseball in the Southwest Conference when 
it became a member of the conference in 1923.[13] That year they finished 
the year with a 13–11 overall record and a 2–10 conference record.[14] 
In 1933 Dutch Meyer, also the coach of the football team, led TCU to its 
first SWC title with a 9–1 record. During the rest of their time in the 
SWC, the Frogs would win 6 more regular-season SWC baseball titles. Their 
next conference championship would come while members of Conference USA 
in 2004 and 2005.[14][15][16][17][18] 2006 saw the Horned Frogs in a new 
conference, the Mountain West Conference. The Frogs went 17–5 in their 
first year in the MWC and never left first place. They also only had to 
play 3 games in the conference tournament to win the MWC Tournament Title 
to complement the regular season title.[19][20] TCU has made 14 appearances 
in the NCAA Baseball Tournament: 1956, 1994, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016.[20][21] TCU has 23 All-Americans, 
six Freshman All-Americans, three players of the year awards, two pitchers 
of the year, and numerous All-Conference selections. The TCU Baseball Team 
makes its home in Lupton Stadium, with a capacity of 3,500. TCU has played 
since the 1908–1909 season. That first year they entered the Waco City 
League and left with a record of 2–3, losing to the Baylor teams and defeating 
the Waco High teams. The Horned Frogs played basketball in the Southwest 
Conference from the 1923–24 seasons until the breakup of the conference 
after the 1995–96 season. During their time in the SWC they won 10 conference 
titles (1931, 1934, 1951*, 1952, 1953, 1959, 1968, 1971, 1986*, 1987; * 
denotes shared title).[22] Buster Brannon owns the most wins as a coach 
in TCU Men's Basketball history with a career that spanned 20 years he 
earned a record of 205–259, a 104–144 record in SWC play, won 4 conference 
titles and earned three trips to the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1952, 
1953 and 1959.[23] The TCU Men's Basketball Team would only win one more 
conference championship after the breakup of the Southwest Conference.[22] 
During the 1997–98 season under Coach Billy Tubbs, the team went 27–6 and 
14–0 in WAC play. The team earned a trip to the Midwest Regional played 
in Oklahoma City, OK. They would lose in the first round to Florida State. 
TCU never won a title during their time in Conference USA or the Mountain 
West Conference.[22] How they will fare in the Big 12 remains to be seen. 
TCU's other NCAA tournament appearances occurred in 1968, 1971 and 1987.[24] 
Along with NCAA Tournament appearances, TCU appeared in the National Invitational 
Tournament six times – 1983, 1986, 1992, 1997, 1999 and 2005. They advanced 
to the quarterfinal round three times – 1983, 1999 and 2005, but have never 
earned a birth to play in the semifinal round in Madison Square Garden.[25] 
The TCU Men's Basketball Team was coached from 2002 to 2007 by Neil Dougherty. 
He was fired in March, 2008, after TCU limped through yet another season 
with a losing record. Jim Christian, previously with Kent State University, 
was hired shortly after Dougherty was fired. Christian resigned on April 
2, 2012, to accept the head coaching position at University of Ohio. On 
April 6, 2012, it was reported that Louisiana State University head coach 
Trent Johnson would be announced as TCU's new men's basketball head coach 
at a press conference on Monday, April 9, 2012. Johnson previously served 
as head coach at LSU, Stanford, and Nevada-Reno. In his four years at LSU, 
Johnson led the Tigers to 1 NCAA Tournament, 1 SEC Championship, and one 
NIT berth. He also earned one SEC coach of the year honor. During his four 
years at Stanford, Johnson led the Cardinal to 3 NCAA Tournaments, including 
one Sweet 16 appearance, and 1 NIT berth. He earned one Pac-10 coach of 
the year honor. Finally, during his stint at Nevada-Reno, Johnson led the 
Wolfpack to 1 NCAA Tournament appearance. Johnson will lead the TCU Horned 
Frogs into their first season in the Big 12 Conference. The TCU Men's Basketball 
Team plays their home games in Schollmaier Arena, formerly known as the 
Daniel–Meyer Coliseum, on the campus of TCU. Kurt Thomas, considered by 
some as the best athlete to attend TCU, played for the basketball team 
from 1990–1995. He was a three time All-American and averaged 29 points 
and 15 rebounds his senior year. The Horned Frogs fielded their first women's 
basketball team in the 1977–78 season[26] and recorded a 5–18 record. They 
improved significantly the following year, going 19–8. Current coach Raegan 
Pebley has been the coach of the team since the 2014–15 season. During 
the 2000–01 season, the Horned Frogs won their first regular season and 
conference championship at the WAC Tournament. The program matched that 
accomplishment the next season, their first season in Conference USA during 
the 2001–2002 season. They then proceeded to win the C-USA tournament in 
2002–03 and 2004–05. Of the four years the Horned Frogs were in C-USA, 
they won the conference title four out of five years.[27] TCU has also 
reached the Women's NCAA Tournament for six consecutive years, stretching 
back to the 2000–01 season. Each year, they have won their first game of 
the tournament and lost the second game, except for first-round losses 
to Oregon in 2005 and to South Dakota State in 2009. TCU women's basketball 
has reached the post season 11 out of 12 years that Coach Jeff Mittie has 
been head of the program. The Horned Frogs share Schollmaier Arena with 
the men's team, playing under the roof there for the entire history of 
the program. As of the 2010–11 athletics' season, women's sports at TCU 
will no longer use the term "Lady Frogs". The TCU Women's Volleyball Team 
is coached by Prentice Lewis with the help of associate head coach Jason 
Tanaka who both joined the team in February 2002.[28] Since Lewis' arrival, 
the volleyball team has had the third best record to date at 12–18.[29] 
The next year, 2003, the Horned Frogs recorded their best record to date 
at 20–11 and made it to the second round of the C-USA tournament, a first 
for a TCU Volleyball team. 2005 the Horned Frog Volleyball team saw their 
first year in the Mountain West Conference. The team finished the season 
16–18 and were seeded 8th in the conference tournament. They defeated the 
number 9 seed, Air Force, in the play-in match 3–1. The Frogs then fell 
to the top seeded BYU 3–0 in the quarterfinals round. 2006 the Frogs recorded 
a 17–15 record and were the sixth seed in the MWC tournament. They eventually 
lost to Colorado State University 3–1. The 2006 season marked the Horned 
Frogs third winning season in four years.[30] The Women's Volleyball Team 
plays their home games in the Student Recreation Center on the TCU campus. 
The Men's and Women's TCU Harriers Cross Country teams compete in the Big 
12 Conference. For purposes of qualifying for the NCAA Men's and Women's 
Cross Country Championships, the TCU Harriers compete in the South Central 
Regional while the rest of the conference competes in the Rocky Mountain 
Regional. From 2003–2005 the TCU Harriers sent a runner to the NCAA Men's 
or Women's Cross Country Championships. The TCU Harriers Cross Country 
team is coached by Eric Heins. In December 2005 it was announced that starting 
in the 2006–2007 academic year women's equestrian would become a varsity 
sport sponsored by TCU. The NCAA designated equestrian as an emerging sport 
in 1998, and, in 2013, there were 37 intercollegiate programs recognized 
for NCAA competition. Programs in the region include Baylor, Kansas State, 
Oklahoma State, SMU, Stephen F. Austin, Texas A&M, and West Texas A&M. 
Intercollegiate equestrian programs support an average of 70 student-athletes. 
The TCU Men's Golf team is led by 20-year Head Coach Bill Montigel. During 
his tenure, Coach Montigel has guided the men's golf team to five consecutive 
conference titles from 2001–2005 between the Horned Frogs time in the WAC 
and MWC. Since 1990, the Horned Frogs have qualified as a team to the NCAA 
South Central Regional every year. In ten of those years, the team moved 
on to the NCAA Championships. Among the most notable TCU men's golf alumni 
is J. J. Henry who was a member of the United States team during the 2006 
Ryder Cup. The TCU golf team practices at the Colonial Golf & Country Club. 
They have won nine conference titles: SWC (1986), WAC (1997, 1998, 2001) 
C-USA (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005), and MWC (2009). In 1983, the TCU Women's 
Golf team accounted for the school's lone national championship outside 
of football. Currently the women's golf team is led by Head Coach Angie 
Ravaioli-Larkin. The Horned Frogs have at least four former players now 
playing professionally. The most notable is multiple LPGA Tour-winner Angela 
Stanford. TCU practices at the Colonial Country Club. The Women's Rifle 
team has had a number of firsts in the history of TCU athletics. In 1972, 
Sue Ann Sandusky was recorded as Texas Christian University's first All-American.[31] 
Also, In 2010, the team became the first all-female squad to win a National 
Championship. The TCU Women's Rifle team is currently led by head coach 
Karen Monez, who has been a part of the program since 2003.[32] In June, 
2013, the Horned Frogs became a charter member of the Patriot Rifle Conference. 
All-Americans In 1986, the TCU Women's Soccer team played its first season 
in Fort Worth, Texas.[33] Since their emergence in 1986 the Women's Soccer 
Team has achieved an all-time record of 194–233–29. As yet, they have no 
NCAA appearances and no conference championships. They are a part of the 
Mountain West Conference. Being only the second head coach of the Horned 
Frogs since its start is Dan Abdalla who has now coached the team for 6 
seasons. His record at TCU (as of the beginning of his 6th season) is 43–44–6. 
He led the TCU soccer women's program to the Mountain West Conference Tournament 
in 2007 for the first time in the program's history. Prior to coaching 
the Horned Frogs, Dan Abdalla was the Head Coach at UNLV (University of 
Nevada Las Vegas) for 5 seasons. Before taking over the Head Coach position 
at UNLV, Abdalla was the Assistant Coach at the University for 1 season. 
UNLV was also his Alma Mater from 1994 to 1997. The Assistant Coach is 
Kerri Hanks, who started coaching at TCU in 2010. She graduated from Notre 
Dame where she received the Hermann Trophy award two times, awarded to 
the top female college soccer player of the year. She helped the Fighting 
Irish advance to the NCAA National Championship match during the 2006 and 
2008 seasons. In 2007, the TCU Women's Soccer team received an award for 
being one of the best academic sports teams in the nation. For the second-consecutive 
year the womenʼs soccer program was recognized by the National Soccer Coaches 
Association of America with the NSCAA Team Academic Award. The Horned Frogs 
also placed 14 individuals on the Fall Academic All-Mountain West Conference 
Team.[34] The women's soccer team plays their home matches at Garvey-Rosenthal 
Stadium, which seats 1,500. The Horned Frogs reached a season high of 2,300 
attendees at the game against The University of Southern California in 
the 2010 fall season. In August 2010, the Jane Justin Field House was added 
to the complex.[35] The Jane Justin Field House contains a locker room 
for the TCU women's soccer team, its visitors, and officials. There are 
also coaches' meeting rooms and an athletic training room. The field house 
was named honoring Jane C. Justine, who graduated from TCU in 1943. The 
facility's field house was a $1.5 million gift from the John and Jane Justin 
Foundation. This is the largest gift solely provided for woman's athletics 
at Texas Christian University to date.[36] All-Conference Players The Texas 
Christian University swimming and diving program officially formed in 1979 
by a man named Richard Sybesma. Sybesma has been the head coach for TCU 
swimming and diving for thirty one years, since its inception in 1979. 
Although there was an actual swim team before 1979, but the team did not 
keep records, therefore we know little about the team. Sybesma has had 
a very successful career while at TCU. He has been named Conference Coach 
of the year on five occasions and was selected as the Nicaraguan Olympic 
Swim Team Coach in 1996. The TCU swimming and diving program has won over 
400 dual meets including championship meets. The TCU swimming and diving 
team has been in three different conferences since its beginning. First 
was the Southwest conference from 1979–1993, then moved to the Western 
Atlantic Conference (WAC) in 1994–2000, in 2001 they proceeded to Conference 
USA, and finally from 2005–present the TCU swim team has been in the Mountain 
West Conference (MWC). While in the Conference USA conference the men's 
swimming and diving team dominated the pools across the country. They were 
the Conference USA champions in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. The women's 
team also had much success in the Conference USA. In 2002 and 2004 TCU 
swimming and diving swept Conference USA by winning both on the men and 
women's side. The TCU swimming and diving team had yet to achieve such 
awards until 2010 when the men's team won the Mountain West Conference 
dual meet Championship. The Texas Christian University Swimming and Diving 
program are not only an athletic team, but they also have a great record 
for academics, The College Coaches Association has honored Sybesma's women's 
program as an Academic All-American swim team for thirty-five consecutive 
semesters while the men's program has been honored on thirteen occasions. 
This program along with all the athletic programs at Texas Christian University 
have been in many different conferences including, the Western Atlantic 
Conference, Conference USA, Mountain West Conference, and starting in 2012 
the Horned Frogs will be joining the Big 12 Conference. All home meets 
are located in the Student Recreation Center on the campus of TCU. Men 
and Women Swimming All-Americans The TCU Horned Frog Swimming and Diving 
have produced fourteen All-Americans within the AIAW and NCAA. Between 
these swimmers are twelve women and two men. Source:[37] Individual Championships 
Individual Champions **collegite record; NCAA meet record[38] The TCU Tennis 
teams play their home matches at the Bayard H. Friedman Tennis Center,[39] 
rated the #1 facility in the nation by Tennis Magazine. The TCU Men's Tennis 
team was coached by Dave Borelli. Before he became coach of the men's team, 
Borelli coached the TCU Women's Tennis team four years before.[40] They 
are the 2005–2006 Mountain West Conference Tournament Champions.[41] Currently, 
the horned frogs are coached by David Roditi. TCU men's tennis is currently 
ranked #3 in the country. The TCU Women's Tennis team was coached by Jefferson 
Hammond. They are the 2005–2006 Mountain West Conference regular season 
and tournament champions.[41] Lee Walker is the current head coach of TCU 
Women's tennis who are ranked #22 for this upcoming season. The Texas Christian 
University Rugby Football Club plays in Division 1 of college rugby in 
the Southwest conference against other in-state rivals. TCU rugby plays 
its home games at the TCU Rugby Pitch, located at 3400 W. Berry St.[42] 
TCU rugby has been led since 2008 by head coach Ben Cole, a USA Rugby certified 
coach.[43] The Horned Frog first appeared in 1897 on the cover of the first 
AddRan yearbook. By 1915, the mascot made its way onto the first TCU seal. 
During the post-WWII years, the Horned Frog Mascot was embraced in costume, 
on stationery, class rings and the band's bass drum. In 1979 the mascot 
was renamed from Addy the All-American Frog to Super Frog.[44][45] TCU 
has capitalized on its mascot by marketing a bumper sticker (in a role 
reversal of where a frog, once kissed, turns into a prince) stating "My 
Princess Turned into a Frog". The TCU fight song "TCU March" was written 
for the marching band by Claude Sammis in 1928.[46] One notable cheer at 
TCU is the Hey Song' TCU has won 3 NCAA team national championships.[47] 
Below are 3 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: 1 
– Named Co-National Champion by the Williamson System along with LSU. SMU 
was named National Champion by the Dickinson System which was favored at 
the time. Princeton and Minnesota also claim a National Championship from 
this season by other poll systems active at the time. 2 – Although the 
NCAA Rifle Sport is coed, the TCU Rifle National Championship Team was 
made up of only females, marking the first time an all-women team has won
