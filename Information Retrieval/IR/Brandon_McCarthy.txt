Brandon Patrick McCarthy (born July 7, 1983) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He has also pitched in MLB for the Chicago White Sox, Texas Rangers, Oakland 
Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, and New York Yankees. McCarthy was born 
and raised in Glendale, California. McCarthy graduated from Cheyenne Mountain 
High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2001. McCarthy was drafted 
in the 17th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the Chicago 
White Sox. In the minor leagues in 2003, McCarthy posted impressive stats 
and showed excellent control, pitching 101 innings, striking out 125 batters, 
and walking only 15 batters. In 2004, he led all minor league pitchers 
in strikeouts, with 202.[1] McCarthy made his major league debut on May 
22, 2005, as a spot starter for the White Sox, allowing two runs in 5 1⁄3 
innings, in a game against the Chicago Cubs. He picked up his first win 
when he pitched 7 2⁄3 scoreless innings against the Texas Rangers in the 
second game of a double-header on August 30. He pitched in 12 games (10 
starts) with the club, going 3–2, but did not pitch in the postseason as 
the White Sox went on to win the World Series. He earned a permanent spot 
on the team as a reliever in 2006, appearing in 53 games while making a 
few spot starts. He finished the season 4–7 in 84.2 innings.[2] On December 
23, 2006, McCarthy and minor leaguer David Paisano were traded to the Texas 
Rangers for John Danks, Nick Masset and Jake Rasner.[3] He endured an injury-plagued 
season in his first year for the Rangers (and his first full year as a 
starter) in 2007, most notably dealing with a stress fracture in his right 
shoulder blade that kept him sidelined for nearly 2 months. He finished 
the season with a 5–10 record in 22 starts.[2] In 2008, as he developed 
inflammation in his right elbow during spring training. He began rehabbing 
between July and August and finished the season making 5 starts for the 
Rangers. After opening the 2009 season in the rotation, McCarthy went on 
to pitch 17 starts in a row before undergoing surgery in July.[4] He missed 
the remainder of the season. He missed the whole 2010 season recovering 
from the surgery on his right shoulder, though he did make 11 rehab starts 
in the minor leagues, going 4–2.[2] After being outrighted by the Rangers,[5] 
McCarthy signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics on December 
14, 2010 for one year and $1 million.[6] As part of the starting pitcher 
rotation for the Athletics in 2011, McCarthy strengthened his mechanics 
and had his most productive major league season, pitching twenty-five games, 
five complete.[7] He adapted his pitch repertoire to emphasize two-seam 
fastballs and cutters, which helped increase his ground-ball percentage 
and lower his home-run rate while developing control and limiting walks 
allowed.[8] McCarthy finished the year with the lowest FIP among American 
League starters.[9] He signed a one-year contract worth $4.275 million 
with the Athletics for the 2012 season, avoiding salary arbitration.[10] 
McCarthy was the Athletics opening day starter for the 2012 season. On 
September 5, he took a line drive to the head off the bat of Erick Aybar 
of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. McCarthy subsequently underwent surgery 
for 2 hours to relieve cranial pressure after CT scans revealed he had 
suffered an epidural hemorrhage, a brain contusion, and a skull fracture. 
While he did not pitch again that season, he recovered well enough to join 
his teammates in the dugout as a spectator during their postseason run.[11] 
He was 8–6 in 18 starts for the Athletics in 2012.[2] On December 7, 2012, 
the Arizona Diamondbacks signed McCarthy to a 2-year $15.5 million contract.[12] 
In June, while on the disabled list for continued shoulder problems, McCarthy 
experienced a seizure related to his head injury the previous year. He 
was placed on medication and expected to return to pitch as his shoulder 
allowed.[13] In his first season in the National League and with the Diamondbacks, 
McCarthy finished 5–11 with 2 complete games in 22 starts.[2] He started 
3–10 with a 5.01 ERA in 18 starts for the Diamondbacks in 2014.[2] On July 
6, 2014, the New York Yankees acquired McCarthy from the Diamondbacks in 
exchange for Vidal Nuño.[14] The Yankees had McCarthy resume the use of 
his cut fastball, which the Diamondbacks had him stop using, while decreasing 
the use of his sinker.[15] On September 17, 2014, he pitched an immaculate 
inning, striking out all three batters in the seventh inning against the 
Tampa Bay Rays, throwing only nine pitches, becoming the 77th pitcher to 
do so in the history of Major League Baseball.[16] In 14 starts for the 
Yankees he was 7–5 with a 2.89 ERA.[2] On December 16, 2014, McCarthy and 
the Los Angeles Dodgers signed a four-year contract worth $48 million.[17][18] 
However, on April 27, 2015 McCarthy was placed on the disabled list after 
he felt tightness in his right elbow in a start against the San Diego Padres 
and was diagnosed with a torn UCL.[19] He underwent season-ending Tommy 
John surgery on April 30, 2015.[20] In four starts before his injury, he 
was 3–0 with a 5.87 ERA.[21] After a lengthy recovery and a few rehab starts 
in the minors, McCarthy rejoined the Dodgers on July 3, 2016, making his 
season debut in a 4–1 win against the Colorado Rockies.[22] In his first 
four starts he went 5 or more innings, won two games and pitched fairly 
effectively however on July 27 he allowed three runs in four innings and 
his next three starts after that he couldnt get past the fourth inning 
and walked five batters in each game, including five in 1 2⁄3 innings on 
August 13.[23] On August 14th, 2016, he was placed on the 15-day disabled 
list with stiffness in his right hip.[24] He thought his career might be 
in jeopardy but he rejoined the team on September 25 and allowed only two 
runs in 5 1⁄3 innings against the Colorado Rockies.[25] His last appearance 
of the season was a relief appearance against the San Francisco Giants 
on September 30. He allowed six runs on five hits and one walk without 
retiring a single batter.[26] He appeared in a total of 10 games for the
