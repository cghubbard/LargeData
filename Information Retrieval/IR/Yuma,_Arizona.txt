Yuma (Cocopah: Yuum) is a city in and the county seat[4] of Yuma County, 
Arizona, United States. It is located in the southwestern corner of the 
state, and the population of the city was 93,064 at the 2010 census, up 
from the 2000 census population of 77,515.[2] Yuma is the principal city 
of the Yuma, AZ Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of Yuma County. 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the 2014 estimated population 
of the Yuma MSA is 203,247,[5] though more than 85,000 retirees make Yuma 
their winter residence.[6] The area's first settlers were Native American 
tribes whose descendants now occupy the Cocopah and Quechan reservations. 
In 1540, expeditions under Hernando de Alarcon and Melchior Diaz visited 
the area and immediately saw the natural crossing of the Colorado River 
as an ideal spot for a city, as the Colorado River narrows to slightly 
under 1,000 feet wide in one small point. Later military expeditions that 
crossed the Colorado River at the Yuma Crossing include Juan Bautista de 
Anza (1774), the Mormon Battalion (1848) and the California Column (1862). 
During and after the California Gold Rush to the late 1870s, the Yuma Crossing 
was known for its ferry crossings for the Southern Emigrant Trail, the 
gateway to California, as it was one of the few natural spots where travelers 
could cross the otherwise very wide Colorado River. Following the establishment 
of Fort Yuma, two towns sprang up 1 mile down river. The one on the California 
side was called Jaeger City, named after the owner of Jaeger's Ferry that 
crossed the river there. It was for a time the larger of the two, with 
the Butterfield Overland Mail office and station, two blacksmiths, a hotel, 
two stores, and other dwellings.[7] The other called Colorado City, a land 
speculation by Charles Poston and site of the custom house, sprang up on 
the south side of the Colorado River in what is now Arizona, but at that 
time was just north of the border between Sonora, Mexico and California. 
After the Gadsden Purchase it bordered on the Territory of New Mexico, 
that became the Territory of Arizona in 1863. The Colorado City site at 
the time was duly registered in San Diego, demonstrating that both banks 
of the Colorado River just below its confluence with the Gila were recognized 
as being within the jurisdiction of California. The county of San Diego 
collected taxes from there for many years.[7][8] From 1853 a smaller settlement, 
Arizona City, grew up on the high ground across from the fort and was organized 
under the name of its post office in 1858. It had adobe dwellings, two 
stores and two saloons. Colorado City and Jaeger City were almost completely 
destroyed by the Great Flood of 1862 and had to be rebuilt on higher ground 
and Colorado City became part of Arizona City.[7][9] It took the name Yuma 
in 1873. From 1854, Colorado City was the major steamboat stop on the way 
up and down the Colorado River. After the 1862 flood, it became Arizona 
City. The steamboats transported passengers and equipment for the various 
mines and military outposts along the Colorado; Colorado City was the terminus 
of wagon traffic up the Gila River into New Mexico Territory. They offloaded 
the cargo from ships at the mouth of the Colorado River at Robinson's Landing 
and from 1864 at Port Isabel. From 1864, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, 
today a state historic park, supplied all forts in present-day Arizona, 
as well as large parts of Colorado and New Mexico. After Arizona became 
a separate territory, Yuma became the county seat for Yuma County in 1871, 
replacing La Paz its first county seat. The Southern Pacific Railroad bridged 
the river in 1877, and acquired George Alonzo Johnson's Colorado Steam 
Navigation Company, the only steamboat company on the river. Yuma became 
the new base of navigation on the river, ending the need for Port Isabel, 
which was abandoned in 1879. The warehouses and shipyard there were moved 
to Yuma. Yuma is located near the borders of California to the west and 
Mexico to the south, and just west of the Gila River's confluence with 
the Colorado. The city is approximately 60 miles from the Gulf of California 
(Sea of Cortez), a branch of the Pacific. According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 106.7 square miles (276 km2), 
of which 106.6 square miles (276 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) 
(0.07%) is water. Yuma is noted for its weather extremes. Of any populated 
place in the contiguous United States, Yuma is the driest, the sunniest, 
and the least humid, has the lowest frequency of precipitation and has 
the highest number of days per year–175–with a daily maximum temperature 
of 90 °F (32 °C) or higher.[10][11] Yuma features a hot desert climate 
(Köppen climate classification BWh), with extremely hot summers and warm 
winters. Atmospheric humidity is usually very low except during what are 
called "Gulf surges", when a maritime tropical air mass from the Gulf of 
California is drawn northward, usually in connection with the summer monsoon 
or the passage of a tropical storm to the south. The sun is said to shine 
during about 90% of the daylight hours, making Yuma the sunniest place 
in the world.[12] An annual mean sunshine duration of 4,015 h would have 
been recorded in the desert city.[11][13] On average, Yuma receives 3.36 
inches (85 mm) of rain annually, and even in the wettest year of 2005, 
only 7.39 in (188 mm) fell. The driest year at Yuma Airport has been 2007 
with only 0.15 in (3.8 mm). September is the wettest month of the year, 
while June is the driest. In 1995, Yuma reached its all-time high of 124 °F 
(51 °C).[14] The lowest recorded temperature fell to −6 °C (21 °F) on the 
Yuma-Mesa area in January 2007. The temperature fell to −6 °C (21 °F) for 
approximately two hours and harmed many crops grown in and around Yuma. 
The crop that suffered the most damage was the citrus on the Yuma mesa, 
most notably the lemon crop which suffered a 75% to 95% loss of crop and 
trees as stated by the Arizona Department of Agriculture in a February 
2007 report. On average, the temperature lowers to the freezing mark in 
less than a quarter of years, and there are 118 days per year that reach 
or exceed 100 °F (38 °C), usually from April through October, and during 
July and August fails to reach the century mark on at most a few days. 
In 1997, the desert city sustained a full tropical storm after Hurricane 
Nora made landfall at the mouth of the Colorado River and quickly moved 
due north along it. This rare event cut power to 12,000 customers in Yuma, 
and dropped 3.59 inches (91 mm) of rain at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma. 
The last time a hurricane had hit near Yuma was in mid-August 1977, when 
similar falls were recorded. As of the census of 2010, there were 93,064

Citing April 2014 data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Yuma as having 
the highest unemployment rate in the United States at 23.8 percent, above 
the 21.6 percent in El Centro, California.[20] Yuma's agricultural workforce, 
which adjusts to the picking season, is cited as the reason for the high 
unemployment by the Arizona Department of Commerce.[21] The Yuma Metropolitan 
Statistical Area has the highest unemployment rate in the United States 
as of 2014 at 23.8%.[22] According to the City's 2014 Comprehensive Annual 
Financial Report,[23] the top employers in the Yuma Metropolitan Statistical 
Area in 2013 were: Other large employers include Bose, Dole Fresh Vegetables 
and Shaw Industries.[24] Yuma contains the historical Yuma Territorial 
Prison, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Park (formerly known 
as the Yuma Crossing Historic Park), and a historic downtown area. Yuma 
is an Arizona Main Street City. Because of budget cutbacks, Arizona State 
Parks no longer operates the Territorial Prison and Quartermaster Depot. 
They are now operated by the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area and the 
City of Yuma. The Yuma Visitors' Bureau oversees the Welcome Center at 
the Quartermaster Depot and is the official visitors' center for the Yuma 
Community. Near Yuma are the Kofa Mountain Range and wildlife refuge, Martinez

in free fall parachute operations to Special Forces units in all branches 
of service, as well as those of other nations. The Colorado River runs 
along the north and west side of town, and serves as the border between 
Arizona and California. Yuma is an important station for trucking industry 
movement of goods between California, Arizona and Mexico. The Rialto movie
