Derrek Leon Lee (born September 6, 1975), or "D-Lee", is a former Major 
League Baseball first baseman. Lee played with the San Diego Padres (1997), 
the Florida Marlins (1998–2003), Chicago Cubs (2004–2010), Atlanta Braves 
(2010), Baltimore Orioles (2011) and Pittsburgh Pirates (2011). He bats 
and throws right-handed. Lee was a World Series Champion with Florida in 
2003, and he won the National League batting title in 2005. He was a two-time 
All-Star selection, and won the Gold Glove Award three times. Lee was born 
on September 6, 1975. Leon Lee is his father and Leron Lee is his uncle. 
Each of them played professional baseball in Japan. During his elementary 
years Lee lived in Japan, and during his high school years he often lived 
there during his summer breaks. Lee was born in Sacramento, California. 
Lee played Little League Baseball at Whitney Little League and graduated 
from El Camino High School in 1993. Lee was drafted in the first round 
(14th overall) of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft by the San Diego 
Padres, and made his major league debut on April 28, 1997. Traded, along 
with prospects, to the Florida Marlins a year later for Kevin Brown, Lee 
was a member of the 2003 World Series Marlins championship team. Lee won 
his first Gold Glove during the 2003 championship season and his spectacular 
grab and unassisted putout on a hard hit Hideki Matsui one-hop line drive 
snuffed out a Yankees rally and ended Game 5 of the World Series with a 
Marlins victory. The Marlins went on to win the World Series in Game 6. 
Lee was traded to the Cubs for Hee-seop Choi. He hit .278 with 32 home 
runs and 98 RBIs in his first year with the Cubs. In 2005, Lee had a career 
first half of the season, with a MLB-leading .376 batting average, 72 RBIs, 
and a tie for the major league lead in home runs with 27. The Cubs had 
traded superstar Sammy Sosa, who had previously been one of their best 
hitters, before the 2005 season. Lee showed early on that he could more 
than compensate for the loss, and while Sosa had a disappointing 2005 season 
with the Baltimore Orioles, Lee had a career year. By midseason, he was 
among MLB's leaders in each of the triple crown categories: batting average, 
home runs, and RBIs. Lee hit his 200th career home run on August 28, 2005, 
off Florida Marlins starter Josh Beckett. He finished the year with a career-best 
46 HR. His .335 batting average was the highest by a Cub since Bill Madlock's 
.339 in 1976 and made him the first Cub since Bill Buckner in 1980 to win 
a National League batting title. He also won the Gold Glove at first base 
that year. Lee was named to the U.S. roster for the 2006 World Baseball 
Classic, where he was the first player to hit a home run for Team USA in 
the World Baseball Classic. On April 10, 2006, Lee signed a five-year, 
$65 million extension with the Chicago Cubs.[1] The deal replaced his contract 
for the 2006 season and extended him as the Cubs' first baseman through 
the 2010 season and included a no-trade clause. He broke his wrist less 
than two weeks later, in a collision involving baserunner Rafael Furcal, 
and he missed 59 games due to the injury. The Cubs posted a 19–40 record 
during Lee's stint on the disabled list. Later, Lee went back on the disabled 
list with a post-traumatic inflammation in the outer bone of the medial 
side of the wrist. In 2008, Lee hit 20 home runs, 90 RBIs and had a .291 
batting average as the Cubs had the best regular-season record in the National 
League. In 2009, Lee ranked ninth in the voting for NL MVP, as he had a 
.306 batting average, and hit for 35 home runs and 111 RBIs, though the 
Cubs did not qualify for the NL playoffs. On June 9, 2010, Lee hit his 
300th career home run in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. On June 
25, 2010, Lee was involved in a dugout altercation with Cubs pitcher Carlos 
Zambrano after the pitcher gave up four runs in the first inning and apparently 
blamed Lee for failing to field a sharply-hit lead-off double. Zambrano 
was suspended for his behavior. In late July 2010 Lee used his ten and 
five rights to veto a trade to the Los Angeles Angels.[2] On August 18, 
2010, Lee, with his approval, was traded to the Atlanta Braves for minor 
league pitching prospects Robinson Lopez, Tyrelle Harris, and Jeffrey Lorick.[3] 
Lee began to serve as the Braves' starting first baseman on August 20, 
2010, including postseason play in the NLDS. Lee was signed from free agency 
to a one-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles for the 2011 season.[4] 
He played in 85 games with the struggling Orioles, batting .246 with 12 
home runs and 41 runs batted in. On July 30, 2011, Lee was traded to the 
Pirates for minor league Class A first baseman Aaron Baker and cash considerations.[5] 
Lee hit two home runs in his first game as a Pirate. He was hit by a pitch 
and broke a bone in his left wrist on August 3, and missed most of the 
next month, but then finished the season productively as the Pittsburgh 
first baseman. Playing in 28 games as a Pirate in 2011, Lee batted .337 
with 7 home runs and 18 RBIs. Lee is the son of Leon Lee. Leon never played 
in the Major Leagues, but did play professionally in Japan. Today, he is 
a scout for Major League Baseball and, coincidentally, he was the scout 
who "found" Hee-Seop Choi who was later traded for his son. Lee is the 
nephew of former Major League outfielder Leron Lee, who played eight seasons 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, Dodgers, Indians, and Padres. Currently, 
he works with the Cincinnati Reds as an advising batting coach to scouted 
players. In September 2006, Lee's three-year-old daughter Jada was diagnosed 
with Leber's congenital amaurosis, a rare genetic disease resulting in 
loss of vision. Lee and Boston Celtics co-owner and CEO Wyc Grousbeck with 
the University of Iowa established Project 3000 in an effort to eradicate 
the disease, which affects both their families. Lee guest starred in an 
episode of NBC's drama series ER, "Gravity", which was first broadcast 
in October 2007. Lee agreed to the brief appearance because the producers 
of ER aired an episode in January 2008 that deals with Leber's congenital 
amaurosis. Lee's efforts to raise awareness and funds for research into 
the condition have helped to raise over $1,000,000 of additional research 
funds. An eventual cure for the disease depends greatly on getting data 
on patients and Lee's support has had a significant impact both in fundraising 
and testing patients who have the disease. In 2009 Lee revealed that Jada 
had been misdiagnosed and does not have the disease, but Lee continues 
to be active in raising money for Project 3000.[6] The 1st Touch Foundation 
was established in 2005 by Lee and his wife as a vehicle to encourage and 
support the educational aspirations of the community's young people. The 
initial vision was to build The 1st Touch Academic Youth Center in Sacramento, 
California. In 2009, Lee unveiled a cabernet wine called CaberLee through 
Charity Wines where 100% of the proceeds will benefit the 1st Touch Foundation.[7] 
However, in September 2012, the foundation closed after helping children 
in Sacramento for seven years. Lee has visited countries such as Uganda 
and Israel to help out with the baseball programs. He visited the Israel 
Baseball Academy in 2015 helping them out with skills while visiting the
