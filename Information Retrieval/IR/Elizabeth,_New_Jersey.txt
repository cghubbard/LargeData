Elizabeth is both the largest city and the county seat of Union County, 
in New Jersey, United States.[20][21] As of the 2010 United States Census, 
the city had a total population of 124,969,[8][9][10] retaining its ranking 
as New Jersey's fourth largest city (by population).[22] The population 
increased by 4,401 (3.7%) from the 120,568 counted in the 2000 Census, 
which had in turn increased by 10,566 (+9.6%) from the 110,002 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[23] For 2015, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates 
Program calculated a population of 129,007, an increase of 3.2% from the 
2010 enumeration,[12] ranking the city the 210th largest in the nation.[24] 
In 2008, Elizabeth was named one of "America's 50 Greenest Cities" by Popular 
Science magazine, the only city in New Jersey selected.[25] Elizabeth, 
originally called "Elizabethtown" and part of the Elizabethtown Tract, 
was founded in 1664 by English settlers. The town was not named for Queen 
Elizabeth I as many people may assume, but rather for Elizabeth, wife of 
Sir George Carteret, one of the two original Proprietors of the colony 
of New Jersey.[26][27][28] She was the daughter of Philippe de Carteret 
II, 3rd Seigneur de Sark and Anne Dowse. The town served as the first capital 
of New Jersey.[29] During the American Revolutionary War, Elizabethtown 
was continually attacked by British forces based on Manhattan and Staten 
Island, culminating in the Battle of Springfield which decisively defeated 
British attempts to gain New Jersey. After independence, it was from Elizabethtown 
that George Washington embarked by boat to Manhattan for his 1789 inauguration.[30] 
There are numerous memorials and monuments of the American Revolution in 
Elizabeth.[31] On March 13, 1855, the City of Elizabeth was created by 
an act of the New Jersey Legislature, combining and replacing both Elizabeth 
Borough (which dated back to 1740) and Elizabeth Township (which had been 
formed in 1693), subject to the results of a referendum held on March 27, 
1855. On March 19, 1857, the city became part of the newly created Union 
County. Portions of the city were taken to form Linden Township on March 
4, 1861.[32] The first major industry, the Singer Sewing Machine Company 
came to Elizabeth and employed as many as 2,000 people. In 1895, it saw 
one of the first car companies, when Electric Carriage and Wagon Company 
was founded to manufacture the Electrobat, joined soon by another electric 
car builder, Andrew L. Riker. The Electric Boat Company got its start building 
submarines for the United States Navy in Elizabeth, New Jersey, beginning 
with the launch of USS Holland (SS-1) in 1897. These pioneering naval craft 
[known as A-Class] were developed at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard in 
Elizabeth between the years 1896–1903.[33] Elizabeth grew in parallel to 
its sister city of Newark for many years, but has been more successful 
in retaining a middle-class presence and was mostly spared riots in the 
1960s.[34] On September 18, 2016, a backpack holding five bombs was discovered 
outside NJ Transit's Elizabeth train station. One bomb detonated accidentally 
when a bomb squad robot failed to disarm the contents of the backpack; 
no one was hurt. Police were initially unsure if this event was related 
to bombs in Seaside Park, New Jersey and Manhattan that had exploded the 
previous day.[35] On September 19, police arrested Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 
28-year-old Afghan-born naturalized U.S. citizen, for questioning in connection 
with all three incidents; the FBI considered Rahami, whose last known address 
was within 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of the train station, to be armed and dangerous.[36][37] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area 
of 13.464 square miles (34.873 km2), including 12.319 square miles (31.907 km2) 
of land and 1.145 square miles (2.966 km2) of water (8.51%).[1][2] Elizabeth 
is bordered to the southwest by Linden, to the west by Roselle and Roselle 
Park, to the northwest by Union and Hillside, to the north by Newark (in 
Essex County). To the east the city is across the Newark Bay from Bayonne 
in Hudson County and the Arthur Kill from Staten Island, New York.[38] 
Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the township include Elizabethport and Great Island.[39] 
The borders of Elizabeth, Bayonne, and Staten Island meet at one point 
on Shooters Island, of which 7.5 acres (3.0 ha) of the island is owned 
by Elizabeth, though the island is managed by the New York City Department 
of Parks and Recreation.[40] The city of Elizabeth has several distinct 
districts and neighborhoods. Midtown also occasionally known as Uptown, 
is the main commercial district and a historic section as well. It includes 
the First Presbyterian Church and St. John's Episcopal Church, and its 
St. John's Episcopal Churchyard. The First Presbyterian Church was a battleground 
for the American Revolution. Located here are also the 1931 Art Deco Hersh 
Tower,[41] the Thomas Jefferson Arts Academy, and the Ritz Theatre which 
has been operating since 1926. Midtown/Uptown includes the area once known 
as "Brittanville" which contained many English type gardens. Bayway is 
located in the southern part of the city and borders the City of Linden. 
From US 1&9 and Allen Street, between the Elizabeth River and the Arthur 
Kill, it has maintained a strong Polish community for years. Developed 
at the turn of the 20th century, many of the area residents once worked 
at the refinery which straddles both Elizabeth and Linden. There are unique 
ethnic restaurants, bars, and stores along Bayway Avenue, and a variety 
of houses of worship. Housing styles are older and well maintained. There 
are many affordable two to four-family housing units, and multiple apartment 
complexes. The western terminus of the Goethals Bridge, which spans the 
Arthur Kill to Staten Island can be found here. A small section of the 
neighborhood was isolated with both the completion of the Goethals Bridge 
in 1928 and the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1950s. This 
section known as "Relocated Bayway" will soon be a memory and piece of 
history as many of the residents have been relocated themselves to make 
way for the expansion of the Goethals Bridge. Downtown / E-Port (a.k.a. 
The Port and Elizabethport) is the oldest neighborhood in Elizabeth and 
perhaps the most diverse place in the city. It is a collection of old world 
Elizabeth, new America, and a mix of colonial-style houses and apartment 
buildings that stretch east of 7th Street to its shores. The name derived 
from its dependency of businesses catering to seagoing ventures. It was 
a thriving center of business between approximately the 1660s through the 
middle of the 20th century. This area has had a great deal of improvement 
in the last fifteen years. Many homes have been refurbished or replaced 
with new, more ornate constructions. Housing projects that stood for years 
along First Street were demolished and replaced with attractive apartment 
complexes for those with low to moderate incomes. New townhomes on the 
waterfront have been developed, and new two-family homes are currently 
under construction. The area formerly had three neighborhoods called Buckeye, 
New Mexico and Diamondville. It is the former home of the Singer Manufacturing 
Company, makers of Singer sewing machines, which constructed a 1,400,000-square-foot 
(130,000 m2) facility on a 32-acre (13 ha) site in 1873. Shortly after 
it opened, the factory manufactured the majority of all sewing machines. 
With 6,000 employees working there in the 1870s, it was the largest number 
of workers at a single facility at the time of its construction. The company 
moved out in 1982.[42] The Elizabeth Marina, which in the past was filled 
with trash and debris along its walkway, was also beautified and many celebrations 
are held year round, from a Hispanic festival in the late spring to the 
lighting of a Christmas tree in the winter. Living conditions in this area 
continue to improve year after year. Historically, there was a Slavic community 
here, centered by a church (Sts. Peter and Paul Byzantine) and a Lithuanian 
(Sts. Peter and Paul, R.C.) and Polish (St. Adalbert) Roman Catholic Church 
still stands in the neighborhood. St. Patrick Church, originally Irish, 
dominates the 'Port and had its cornerstone laid in 1887.[43] Elmora is 
a middle/working-class neighborhood in the western part of Elizabeth. The 
main thoroughfare, Elmora Avenue, boasts some of the best restaurants, 
shops and boutiques. A few of the city's most luxurious high-rise building 
complexes, affording views of the New York skyline, dot the edge of this 
neighborhood and are convenient to the Midtown NJ Transit Train Station. 
The neighborhood area forms a "V" from its approximate borders of the Central 
RR tracks to Rahway Avenue. The northwestern part of Elmora is known as 
Elmora Hills. It is a strongly middle- to upper-middle-class neighborhood. 
Originally called Shearerville, the name Elmora came from the developers 
of the area, the El Mora Land Company. This area was annexed from Union, 
returning to Elizabeth in the early part of the 20th century. This was 
done to increase the city's tax base as major improvements to infrastructure 
were necessary at the time. Frog Hollow is a small community of homes east 
of Atlantic Street, west of the Arthur Kill, and south of Elizabeth Avenue. 
Its name is derived from the excellent frog catching in its marshes as 
well as the excellent oyster and fishing of the past. The area expanded 
east and includes the area formerly known as Helltown. Helltown included 
many of the docks and shipyards, as well as several drydocks. The area's 
developer was Edward N. Kellogg, who also laid out the neighborhood in 
Keighry Head. Frog Hollow contains older-style, affordable homes, rentals, 
and some quality restaurants in a working-class community. The statue honoring 
former Mayor Mack on Elizabeth Avenue is a landmark in the community. Frog 
Hollow is also convenient to the Veteran's Memorial Waterfront Park. Its 
name is attributed to James Keighry of the Isle of Kerry, Ireland. He was 
a notable resident who owned a business facing the square formed at the 
junction of Jackson, Madison, Chestnut and Magnolia Avenues. The approximate 
borders of this neighborhood extended north from East Grand Street to Flora 
Street and from Walnut to Division Street. Developed by Edward N. Kellogg, 
many of the streets were named after family and friends. Keighry Head is 
located close to Midtown, containing affordable one and two-family homes, 
and apartment houses, convenient to the Midtown shopping district, and 
transportation. The North End, also known as "North Elizabeth", is a diverse 
working-class neighborhood. The borders are approximately the Arch north 
to the city line between North Broad Street and US 1&9. It was developed 
mostly in the 1920s for workers in the Dusenburg automobile plant (later 
Durant Auto, Burry Biscuits and Interbake Foods). The area was heavily 
settled by the Irish and then Portuguese. The North End has easy access 
to New York and Newark via its own NJ Transit train station, Routes 1&9 
and the NJ Turnpike. The neighborhood also has Crane Square, the Historic 
Nugents Tavern, and Kellogg Park and its proximity to Newark Airport. There 
is currently a plan in place to develop the former Interbake Foods facility 
into shopping and residential townhouses and condominiums. This community 
contains many larger one and two-family homes that have been rebuilt over 
the past decade. North Elizabeth also features many well-kept apartment 
houses and condominium units on and around North Avenue that are home to 
professionals who work in New York or the area. The only Benedictine women's 
community in New Jersey is located at Saint Walburga Monastery on North 
Broad Street. Peterstown (also known as "The Burg") is a middle/working-class 
neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city. Its borders run west 
of Atlantic Street to South Spring Street from 1st Avenue to the Elizabeth 
River. Its name is derived from John Peters, who owned most of the land 
with George Peters. They divided the land and developed it during the end 
of the 19th century. The area of Peterstown was once predominantly occupied 
by its earliest settlers, who were German, and during the 1920s was gentrified 
by newly immigrated Italians. Peterstown has clean, quiet streets and has 
many affordable housing opportunities with a "village" feel. The area contains 
the historic Union Square, which is home to produce stands, meat markets, 
fresh fish and poultry stores. Peterstown is also home of the DeCavalcante 
crime family, one of the most infamous Mafia families in the United States. 
The Point, formally known as the Crossroads, is centrally located and defined 
by New Point Road and Division Street. It is close to Midtown and contains 
many new affordable two-family homes, apartment houses and is undergoing 
a transformation. The former Elizabeth General Hospital site is currently 
being demolished and awaiting a new development. Home to St. Mary's and 
the "Hilltoppers", this area once was lined with mansions. Its approximate 
borders were South Broad Street to Grier Avenue and Pearl Street to what 
is now US 1&9. During its development in the 1860s it was the most fashionable 
area of the city to live. It is now a quiet middle class community experiencing 
a re-development with many new condominiums. Developed by Edward J. Grassman, 
Westminster got its name from the city's largest residential estates of 
the Tudor style and was inhabited by many residents who traced their ancestry 
to England. This neighborhood borders Hillside with the Elizabeth River 
running its border creating a dramatic splash of greenery and rolling hills 
off of North Avenue, near Liberty Hall. Residents use this area for recreation, 
whether it is at the newly christened Phil Rizzuto Park area, or for bird 
watching or for sunbathing by the river. It is one of the more affluent 
areas of Elizabeth. The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid 
summers and cold winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification 
system, Elizabeth has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on 
climate maps.[44] At the 2010 United States Census, there were 124,969 
people, 41,596 households, and 29,325 families residing in the city. The

of 8,731 Elizabeth residents as of the 2000 Census. This exceeded the combined 
total of Mexico and Central America of 8,214. It also far exceeded the 
next highest single nation count of Cuba at 5,812. The largest number for 
a non-Spanish speaking country and third highest overall was immigrants 
from Portugal numbering 4,544. The next largest groups were Salvadoran 
immigrants numbering 4,043, Peruvians 3,591 and Dominican immigrants,once

Since World War II, Elizabeth has seen its transportation facilities grow; 
the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal is one of the busiest ports in 
the world, as is Newark Liberty International Airport, parts of which are 
actually in Elizabeth. Elizabeth also features Little Jimmy's Italian Ices 
(since 1932), the popular Jersey Gardens outlet mall, Loews Theater, and 
the Elizabeth Center, which generate millions of dollars in revenue. Companies 
based in Elizabeth include New England Motor Freight. Together with Linden, 
Elizabeth is home to the Bayway Refinery, a Phillips 66 refining facility 
that supplies petroleum-based products to the New York/New Jersey area, 
producing approximately 230,000 barrels (37,000 m3) per day. Celadon, a 
mixed-use development containing 14 glass skyscrapers, offices, retail, 
a hotel, boardwalk and many other amenities is proposed to border the east 
side of the Jersey Gardens mall, directly on the Port Newark Bay. Groundbreaking 
was scheduled for the summer of 2008 on the ferry, roads and parking, and 
construction will continue for at least twelve years.[65] Portions of the 
city are covered by the Urban Enterprise Zone, which cuts the sales tax 
rate to 3½% (half of the 7% charged statewide) and offers other incentives 
to businesses within the district.[66] The Elizabeth UEZ has the highest 
business participation rate in the state, with approximately 1,000 businesses 
participating in — and benefiting from — the program. The UEZ has helped 
bring in more than $1.5 billion in new economic development to the city 
and has brought in over $50 million in sales tax revenue that has been 
reinvested in funding for additional police, streetscape and other infrastructure 
improvements.[67] The City of Elizabeth is governed within the Faulkner 
Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council 
system of municipal government. The city government of Elizabeth is made 
up of a Mayor and a City Council. The Elizabeth City Council is made up 
of nine members, who are elected to serve four-year terms of office on 
a staggered basis with elections held in even years. The three Council 
members elected at-large and mayor come up for election together in leap 
years and two years later the six members who are elected from each of 
Elizabeth's six wards are all up for election.[6] As of 2016[update], the 
city's Mayor is Democrat Chris Bollwage, a lifelong resident of Elizabeth 
who is serving his sixth term as Mayor, serving a term of office that ends 
December 31, 2016.[3] City Council members are Council President Nelson

Elizabeth is located in the 8th Congressional District[74] and is part 
of New Jersey's 20th state legislative district.[9][75][76] Prior to the 
2010 Census, Elizabeth had been split between the 10th Congressional District

and emergency medical services to the city of Elizabeth.[111] The Elizabeth 
Fire Department was established as a volunteer organization in 1837 when 
Engine Company # 1 was organized. In 1901, the volunteer department was 
no longer adequate and the department reorganized into a paid department 
on January 1, 1902.[112] The department is part of the Metro USAR Strike 
Team, which consists of nine North Jersey fire departments and other emergency 
services divisions working to address major emergency rescue situations.[113] 
Emergency medical services are provided by the Elizabeth Fire Department's 
Division of Emergency Medical Services. This is a civilian division of 
the fire department and handles approx 20,000 calls a year. The division 
is made up of an EMS chief, 5 supervisors, 28 full-time emergency medical 
technicians, and approximately 12 per-diem EMTs. The division, at its maximum 
staffing, aims to operate five ambulances and a supervisor on days (7am-7pm) 
and three ambulances and a supervisor on nights (7pm-7am). The city's public 
schools are operated by Elizabeth Public Schools, serving students in pre-Kindergarten 
through twelfth grade. The district is one of 31 former Abbott districts 
statewide,[114] which are now referred to as "SDA Districts" based on the 
requirement for the state to cover all costs for school building and renovation 
projects in these districts under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools 
Development Authority.[115][116] As of the 2011–12 school year, the district's 
34 schools had an enrollment of 23,386 students and 1,846.0 classroom teachers 
(on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 12.67:1.[117] With 5,300 
students, Elizabeth High School was the largest high school in the state 
of New Jersey and one of the largest in the United States, and underwent 
a split that created five new academies and a smaller Elizabeth High School 
under a transformation program that began in the 2009–10 school year.[118] 
The school was the 294th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 
322 schools statewide, in New Jersey Monthly magazine's September 2010 
cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", after being ranked 
302nd in 2008 out of 316 schools.[119] Before the 2008–09 school year, 
all of the district's schools (except high schools) became K–8 schools, 
replacing the middle schools and elementary schools. SchoolDigger.com ranked 
Elizabeth 449th of 558 districts evaluated in New Jersey.[120] These and 
other indicators reveal a seriously declining performance standard in the 
city's schools. Data reported by the state Department of Education showed 
that a majority of students in a majority of the Elizabeth public schools 
failed basic skills tests.[121] In the 2008–09 school year, Victor Mravlag 
Elementary School No. 21 was recognized with the Blue Ribbon School Award 
of Excellence by the United States Department of Education,[122] the highest 
award an American school can receive.[123][124] For the 2006–07 school 
year, William F. Halloran Alternative School #22 was one of four schools 
in New Jersey recognized with the Blue Ribbon Award.[125] William F. Halloran 
Alternative School #22 earned a second award when it was one of 11 in the 
state to be recognized in 2014 by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program.[126][127][128] 
Elizabeth is also home to several private schools. The coeducational St. 
Mary of the Assumption High School, which was established 1930,[129] and 
the all-girls Benedictine Academy, which is run by the Benedictine Sisters 
of Saint Walburga Monastery,[130] both operate under the auspices of the 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark.[131] The Newark Archdiocese also 
operates the K–8 schools Our Lady of Guadalupe Academy and St. Genevieve 
School.[132] Following the closure of Saint Patrick High School by the 
Newark Archdiocese in June 2012 in the face of increasing costs and declining 
enrollment, administrators and parents affiliated with the defunct school 
opened an independent non-denominational school located on Morris Avenue 
in Elizabeth called "The Patrick School" in September 2012.[133][134][135] 
The Benedictine Preschool, operated by the Benedictine Sisters, is housed 
at Saint Walburga Monastery.[136] The Jewish Educational Center comprises 
the Yeshiva of Elizabeth (nursery through sixth grades), the Rav Teitz 
Mesivta Academy (boys, sixth through twelfth grades), and Bruriah High 
School (girls, seventh through twelfth grades).[137] Princeton University 
was founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the College of New Jersey.[138] The 
Elizabeth Public Library, the free public library with a main library, 
originally a Carnegie library, and three branches[139] had a collection 
of 384,000 volumes and annual circulation of about 115,000 in 2016.[139][140] 
Elizabeth is a hub of several major roadways including the New Jersey Turnpike 
/ Interstate 95, Interstate 278 (including the Goethals Bridge, which carries 
Interstate 278 over the Arthur Kill between Elizabeth and Howland Hook, 
Staten Island), U.S. Route 1/9, Route 27, Route 28, and Route 439. Elizabeth's 
own street plan, in contrast to the more usual grid plan, is to a large 
degree circular, with circumferential and radial streets centered on the 
central railroad station. As of May 2010[update], the city had a total 
of 153.78 miles (247.48 km) of roadways, of which 123.75 miles (199.16 km) 
were maintained by the municipality, 12.27 miles (19.75 km) by Union County 
and 11.80 miles (18.99 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation 
and 5.96 miles (9.59 km) by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[141] Elizabeth 
was once home to several smaller bascule bridges. The South First Street 
Bridge over the Elizabeth River, originally built in 1908, was replaced 
by a fixed span. The South Front Street Bridge (also over the Elizabeth 
River), built in 1922, has been left in the open position since March 2011.[142] 
A study is underway to determine if the bridge can be rehabilitated.[143] 
The bridge is notable in that it is the only remaining movable road bridge 
in Union County (movable railroad bridges still exist). Elizabeth is among 
the U.S. cities with the highest train ridership. It is serviced by NJ 
Transit on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor Line. There are two active stations 
in Elizabeth. Elizabeth station, also called Broad Street Elizabeth or 
Midtown Station, is the southern station in Midtown Elizabeth.[144] The 
other train station in Elizabeth is North Elizabeth station.[145] NJ Transit 
has planned a segment of the Newark-Elizabeth Rail Link (NERL), designated 
as the Union County Light Rail (UCLR). The UCLR was planned to connect 
Midtown Station with Newark Liberty International Airport and have seven 
or eight other stations in between within Elizabeth city limits.[146][147] 
A possible extension of this future line to Plainfield would link the city 
of Elizabeth with the Raritan Valley Line. New Jersey Transit provides 
bus service on the 111, 112, 113 and 115 routes to and from the Port Authority 
Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan, on the 24, 40, 48, 59 and 62 routes 
to Newark, New Jersey, with local service available on the 26, 52, 56, 
57 and 58 routes.[148] The Colombian airline Avianca operates a private 
bus service from John F. Kennedy Airport to Union City and Elizabeth for 
passengers on Avianca flights departing from and arriving to JFK.[149]

The city is the focal point of Elizabeth native Judy Blume's 2015 novel 
In The Unlikely Event, the backdrop for which was the crash of three commercial 
airliners in Elizabeth within a period of two months in 1951–52.[151] In 
the opening credits of The Sopranos, part of the city is shown.[152] Elizabeth 
is the hometown of Mary Dawn Dwyer Levov, the principal female character 
in Philip Roth's 1997 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel American Pastoral.[153]
