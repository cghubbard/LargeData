Ed Smith Stadium is a baseball field located in Sarasota, Florida. The 
stadium was built in 1989 to replace Payne Park as a Spring Training and 
Minor League Baseball site. In 2010, the Baltimore Orioles began playing 
spring games at the ballpark. Ed Smith Stadium was formerly the spring 
home of the Chicago White Sox (1989–1997) and the Baltimore Orioles (1991). 
In 1998, it replaced Plant City Stadium as the spring training home of 
the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds remained at the facility through 2008. After 
Cincinnati's club moved its spring activities to Arizona, Ed Smith Stadium 
spent a year without major league Spring Training.[1] The Orioles became 
the stadium's tenant and operator in 2010.[2] Baltimore had trained in 
Sarasota before—at Twin Lakes Park in 1989 and 1990, as well as at Ed Smith 
in 1991—before moving to St. Petersburg and then Ft. Lauderdale for spring 
games.[1] From 1989 to 2009, the stadium hosted a series of Minor League 
Baseball teams, the Single-A Sarasota White Sox, Sarasota Red Sox, and 
Sarasota Reds. From 2004 until 2009, it housed the Gulf Coast League's 
Gulf Coast Reds. Ed Smith has also hosted high school and college baseball 
tournaments. On November 1, 2008, Barack Obama gave a speech to a crowd 
of 10,000 spectators as part of his 2008 presidential campaign. In 2008, 
a planned renovation fell through when a proposed bond issue from the city 
of Sarasota to partially fund the renovation was rejected by the voters. 
The Reds, whose lease with the city and the stadium expired after the season, 
announced that they intend to seek a new spring training home.[3] They 
moved to Goodyear Ballpark, located in Arizona, in 2010. The Baltimore 
Orioles reached a tentative 30-year agreement to begin spring training 
at Ed Smith Stadium starting in 2010 which included renovations to the 
stadium and surrounding areas. The $31.2 million renovation was completed 
prior to the beginning of spring training in February 2011.[4] Seats in 
the renovated stadium are refurbished seats from the Orioles' revolutionary 
home ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Three air-conditioned suites 
added to the park are numbered Suites 66, 70, and 83, corresponding to 
the club's three World Series championships. A fabric sun shade system 
extends from the stadium's original roof to nearly double the number of 
seats in the shade.[2] A series of photos produced by the Orioles shows 
the dramatic changes resulting from the renovation.[5] Seating is available 
for 7,428 spectators, with standing room space taking the park's total 
capacity to 8,500. Two concourses include food and beverage stands, a cafe, 
and a 2,000-square-foot (190 m2) gift shop. 100 high-definition televisions 
are located throughout the stadium and a high-definition LED video board 
in the outfield measures 17 feet (5.2 m) high by 30 feet (9.1 m) across.[2]
