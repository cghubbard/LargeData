James William "Junior" Gilliam (October 17, 1928 – October 8, 1978) was 
an American second baseman, third baseman, and coach in Negro League and 
Major League Baseball who spent his entire major league career with the 
Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was named the 1953 National League 
Rookie of the Year, and was a key member of ten National League championship 
teams from 1953 to 1978. As the Dodgers' leadoff hitter for most of the 
1950s, he scored over 100 runs in each of his first four seasons and led 
the National League in triples in 1953 and walks in 1959. Upon retirement, 
he became one of the first African-American coaches in the major leagues. 
Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Gilliam began playing on a local semi-pro 
team at age 14 and dropped out of high school in his senior year to pursue 
his baseball career. He joined the Negro National League's Baltimore Elite 
Giants, with whom he played from 1946 to 1950. He received his nickname, 
"Junior", during this time. He was voted an All-Star three straight years 
from 1948 to 1950. Veteran George Scales taught him to switch hit. In 1951, 
he was signed as an amateur free agent by the Brooklyn Dodgers, who sent 
him to play for their Triple-A International League farm team, the Montreal 
Royals; he couldn't play for the Dodgers' Double-A affiliate, the Fort 
Worth Cats, as blacks were still barred from the Texas League. He led the 
International League in runs in both 1951 and 1952. Gilliam made his debut 
with the Dodgers in April 1953, with the formidable task of taking over 
second base from Jackie Robinson, who was shifted to the outfield and third 
base; he proved capable, batting .278 with a team-leading 125 runs for 
the National League champions. His 17 triples led the National League, 
and remain the most by a Dodger since 1920; he was second in the league 
(behind Stan Musial) with 100 walks, and third with 21 stolen bases. For 
his excellent season he earned National League Rookie of the Year honors, 
as well as The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award. He continued to 
play well during the team's Brooklyn years, batting .282 in 1954 with a 
career-high 13 home runs before slipping to a .249 average for the 1955 
champions; he scored over 100 runs both years, as well as in 1956. With 
the 1956 pennant winners, he batted a career-best .300 and made his first 
major league All-Star team, also finishing fifth in voting for the Major 
League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award; he was again second in the 
league in walks (95, behind teammate Duke Snider) and steals (21, behind 
Willie Mays). On July 21 of that year, he tied John Montgomery Ward's 1892 
major league record of 12 assists in a game. In the Dodgers' last season 
in Brooklyn in 1957, he batted .250 but led the National League in putouts 
and fielding percentage and again finished second behind Mays in stolen 
bases. He continued to star with the team after their 1958 move to Los 
Angeles, though he gradually shifted to third base; for the 1959 champions 
he led the National League in walks (96), along with 23 steals, and was 
again an All-Star, hitting a home run in that year's second All-Star Game. 
During the team's Los Angeles years, he moved back to second base from 
1961 to 1963, batting .282 in the 1963 pennant year and placing sixth in 
that year's MVP vote; he also relinquished the leadoff role to Maury Wills 
in the 1960s, instead batting second in the order. Gilliam was named a 
coach after the 1964 season, and intended to end his playing career, but 
team injuries resulted in his seeing substantial play at third base in 
1965 and 1966, with the team again winning the National League championship 
in both seasons. In 1965 he was part of the major leagues' first all-switch-hitting 
infield, with shortstop Wills, first baseman Wes Parker, and second baseman 
Jim Lefebvre. On September 5, Gilliam hit a 2-run pinch triple in a road 
game against the Houston Astros, giving the Dodgers a 3–2 lead in the ninth 
inning; the Los Angeles Rams, playing a preseason game against the Philadelphia 
Eagles at the Coliseum, were playing so poorly despite their 10–0 win that 
the biggest cheer from the stands came from people listening to portable 
radios tuned to the Dodger game who cheered when Gilliam got the hit.[1] 
He finally retired as a player following the 1966 season with a .265 career 
batting average, 1,889 hits, 1,163 runs, 65 home runs, 558 runs batted 
in, 304 doubles, 71 triples, 1,036 walks, and 203 stolen bases over 14 
seasons. Gilliam played in seven World Series with the Dodgers, four of 
them against the New York Yankees. In the 1953 World Series he singled 
to lead off Game 1, and had a solo homer in the fifth inning batting left-handed. 
He hit three doubles, scoring once and driving in two runs, in the 7–3 
Game 4 victory; he had another homer, this time batting right-handed, in 
the 11–7 loss in Game 5. In Game 3 of the 1955 World Series, he drew a 
walk with the bases loaded in the second inning to give the Dodgers the 
lead for good, and he drove in the first run of the 8–5 Game 4 win; the 
Dodgers won in seven games for their first Series championship. In the 
1956 World Series, he walked with one out in the tenth inning of Game 6 
and scored on a single by Robinson to give the Dodgers a 1–0 victory, tying 
the Series; in Game 5 he had struck out and grounded out twice in the perfect 
game pitched by the Yankees' Don Larsen. In the 1963 World Series he scored 
the only run of Game 3 in the first inning after walking and advancing 
to second base on a wild pitch; after advancing all the way to third base 
on an error by Joe Pepitone in the seventh inning of Game 4, he scored 
on a Willie Davis sacrifice fly to give the Dodgers a 2–1 win and a Series 
sweep. He was also on Dodger teams which won the Series in 1959 against 
the Chicago White Sox and 1965 against the Minnesota Twins. His final major 
league appearance was in Game 2 of the 1966 World Series against the Baltimore 
Orioles. Gilliam served as a player-coach beginning in 1964, and became 
a full-time coach in 1967. He continued as a coach with the Dodgers until 
his death in 1978, including three more Dodger pennant teams in 1974, 1977, 
and 1978; they lost the World Series in each year. Gilliam suffered a massive 
brain hemorrhage at his home on September 15, 1978, and, following surgery, 
lapsed into a coma from which he did not recover. He died in Inglewood, 
California, nine days before his 50th birthday, one day after the Dodgers 
clinched their tenth pennant during his tenure in the 1978 National League 
Championship Series. His uniform number 19 was retired by the Dodgers two 
days after his death, prior to Game 1 of the 1978 World Series. His number 
is the only one retired by the Dodgers of a player not in the Hall of Fame. 
He is interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery. Gilliam was respected for 
his personal qualities and sportsmanship, in addition to his playing ability, 
over his 28-year career with the Dodgers. Quotations about him include 
the following: What a great team player he was. He'd hit behind Maury, 
take pitch after pitch after pitch. And when Maury got to second, he'd 
give himself up by hitting the ball to the right side, even with two strikes, 
which most hitters won't do. He didn't hit with power, he had no arm, and 
he couldn't run. But he did the little things to win ballgames. He never 
griped or complained. He was one of the most unselfish ballplayers I know. 
Father, friend, and locker room inspiration that will never be forgotten. 
The book Carl Erskine's Tales from the Dodgers Dugout: Extra Innings (2004) 
includes short stories from former Dodger pitcher Carl Erskine. Gilliam 
is prominent in many of these stories. In 1981, the City of Los Angeles 
dedicated a park in honor of Junior Gilliam's legacy. In 1984 the Jim Gilliam 
Park opened to the public, and is located on La Brea Avenue. The Jim Gilliam 
Park is marked by several facilities named after him. The first ball ceremony 
was thrown by the Honor Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles (1973–1993). 
On May 21, 2015, the Nashville Metro Council passed an ordinance renaming 
a part of Jackson Street between Second Avenue and to an alley slightly 
past Fifth Avenue to "Junior Gilliam Way". The center part of this stretch 
named for Gilliam is the location of Nashville's First Tennessee Park, 
a minor league baseball stadium built in 2015 for the Triple-A Nashville
