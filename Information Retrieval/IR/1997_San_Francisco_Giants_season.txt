The 1997 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 115th season in Major 
League Baseball, their 40th season in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their 38th at 3Com Park at Candlestick 
Point. The Giants finished in first place in the National League West with 
a record of 90 wins and 72 losses. They lost the National League Division 
Series in three games to the Florida Marlins. Infielders Coaches The White 
Flag Trade was a trade made in 1997. On July 31, 1997, the Chicago White 
Sox traded three major players to the San Francisco Giants for six minor 
leaguers. At the time, the trade was maligned by the vast majority of White 
Sox fans as Jerry Reinsdorf giving up on the team, as they were only 3.5 
games behind the Cleveland Indians for the American League Central Division 
lead. In 2000, however, the White Sox won the Central Division title, receiving 
large contributions from two of the players received in this trade. Note:
