Edgar Charles "Sam" Rice (February 20, 1890 – October 13, 1974) was an 
American pitcher and right fielder in Major League Baseball. Although Rice 
made his debut as a relief pitcher, he is best known as an outfielder. 
Playing for the Washington Senators from 1915 until 1933, he was regularly 
among the American League leaders in runs scored, hits, stolen bases and 
batting average. He led the Senators to three postseasons and a World Series 
championship in 1924. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed. Rice 
played his final year, 1934, for the Cleveland Indians. He was elected 
to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1963. Rice was best known for making a 
controversial catch in the 1925 World Series which carried him over the 
fence and into the stands. While he was alive, Rice maintained a sense 
of mystery around the catch, which had been ruled an out. He wrote a letter 
that was opened after his 1974 death which claimed that he had maintained 
possession of the ball the entire time. Rice was the first of six children 
born to Charles Rice and Louisa Newmeyer. Charles and Louisa married about 
two months after his birth. He grew up in various towns near Morocco, Indiana, 
on the Indiana-Illinois border, and considered Morocco, Indiana, his hometown.[1] 
He was known as "Eddie" during his childhood. In 1908, Rice married 16-year-old 
Beulah Stam.[2] They lived in Watseka, where Rice ran the family farm, 
worked at several jobs in the area, and attended tryouts for various professional 
baseball teams.[3] By April 1912, Rice and his wife had two children, aged 
eighteen months and three years. While Rice's wife cared for the children, 
Rice traveled to Galesburg, Illinois, to play for a spot on a minor league 
baseball team, the Galesburg Pavers of the Central Association.[4] Rice 
spent about a week with the team, appearing in three exhibition games. 
In an appearance on April 21, Rice entered the game as a relief pitcher 
and finished the last three innings of a Pavers victory, giving up one 
run in a game marked by forceful winds.[5] That same day, Rice's wife took 
their children on a day trip to the homestead of Rice's parents in Morocco, 
about 20 miles from Watseka. A storm arose and a tornado swept across the 
homestead, destroying the house and most of the outbuildings. The tornado 
killed Rice's wife, his two children, his mother, his two younger sisters 
and a farmhand. Rice's father survived for another week before also succumbing 
to his injuries. Rice had to attend two funerals: one for his parents and 
sisters, and a second for his wife and children.[6] Probably wracked with 
grief, Rice spent the next year wandering the area and working at several 
jobs. In 1913 he joined the United States Navy and served on the USS New 
Hampshire, a 16,000-ton battleship that was large enough to field a baseball 
team. Rice played on that team during one season.[7] He was on the ship 
when it took part in the United States occupation of Veracruz, Mexico. 
In 1914, Rice joined the Petersburg Goobers of the Virginia League as a 
pitcher. He compiled a 9–2 record with a 1.54 earned run average (ERA) 
that year, then returned in 1915, earning an 11-12 record with a 1.82 ERA.[8] 
Team owner "Doc" Lee owed a $300 debt to Clark Griffith, who owned the 
major-league Washington Senators at the time, and he offered Rice's contract 
to Griffith in payment of the debt. Lee is credited with two acts which 
influenced Rice's subsequent career: he changed the player's name from 
"Edgar" to "Sam", and he convinced the Senators to let Rice play in the 
outfield instead of pitching. Rice played 19 of his 20 seasons with the 
Washington Senators. He appeared in only 62 total major league games in 
1915 and 1916. He played 155 games in 1917, registering a .302 batting 
average in 656 plate appearances.[9] Rice was recalled up to the army in 
1918.[10] He joined the 68th Coast Artillery Regiment and was stationed 
at Fort Terry in New York. He appeared with the Senators in a few games 
during two furloughs.[11] By September, his company was sent to France 
and they prepared for combat, but the men did not see any action before 
the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.[12] In 1919, Rice played 
in 141 games and hit .321, one of 13 seasons in which he hit at least .300. 
He hit .338 in 1920, recorded a league-leading and career-high 63 stolen 
bases and was caught stealing a league-high 30 times. In 1921, he hit 13 
triples, the first of ten consecutive seasons in which he finished in double 
digits in that category. He collected a league-high 216 hits in 1924. Though 
not the league leader in 1925, he recorded a career-high 227 hits, 87 rbi, 
and a .350 batting average, career highs among his full seasons. The most 
famous moment in Rice's career came on defense. During game three of the 
1925 World Series with the Senators playing the Pittsburgh Pirates, the 
Senators were leading the Pirates 4–3. In the bottom of the 8th inning, 
Sam Rice was moved from center field to right field. With two outs in the 
bottom of the inning, Pirates catcher Earl Smith drove a ball to right-center 
field. Rice ran down the ball and appeared to catch the ball at the fence, 
potentially robbing Smith of a home run that would have tied the game. 
After the catch, Rice toppled over the top of the fence and into the stands, 
disappearing out of sight. When Rice reappeared, he had the ball in his 
glove and the umpire called the batter out. The umpire's explanation was 
that as soon as the catch was made the play was over, and so it did not 
matter where Rice ended up. His team lost the Series in seven games. Controversy 
persisted over whether Rice actually caught the ball and whether he kept 
possession of it. Rice himself would not tell, only answering: "The umpire 
called him out", when asked. Magazines offered to pay him for the story, 
but Rice turned them down, saying: "I don't need the money. The mystery 
is more fun." He would not even tell his wife or his daughter. The controversy 
became so great that Rice wrote a letter to be opened upon his death.[13] 
Leading the league in hits again in 1926, Rice finished fourth in the Most 
Valuable Player Award voting.[9] His batting average dipped to .297 in 
1927, but he hit .328, .323 and .349 from, respectively, the 1928 through 
1930 seasons.[9] Though Rice hit .310 in 1931 across 120 games, Dave Harris 
got significant playing time when the team was facing lefthanded pitchers. 
The Senators also began to explore younger players for their outfield spots.[9][14] 
The Senators held "Sam Rice Day" in late 1932, where the team presented 
him with several gifts, including a check for more than $2200 and a new 
Studebaker automobile. He played only 106 games that year, often appearing 
as a pinch hitter. In 1933, the team returned to the World Series. Though 
the team lost, Rice batted once in the third game, getting a hit. The Senators 
released him after the season.[15] He played 1934 with the Cleveland Indians, 
then retired at the age of 44. Cleveland manager Walter Johnson talked 
to Rice about returning in 1935, but Rice refused.[15] Rice retired with 
a .322 career average. He stood erect at the plate and used quick wrists 
to slash pitches to all fields. He never swung at the first pitch and seldom 
struck out, once completing a 616-at-bat season with nine strikeouts. As 
the ultimate contact man with the picture-perfect swing, Rice was never 
a home run threat, but his speed often turned singles into doubles, and 
his 1920 stolen base total of 63 earned him the timely nickname "Man o' 
War". With 2,987 hits, Rice has the most of any player not to reach 3,000. 
Rice later said, "The truth of the matter is I did not even know how many 
hits I had. A couple of years after I quit, [Senators owner] Clark Griffith 
told me about it, and asked me if I'd care to have a comeback with the 
Senators and pick up those 13 hits. But I was out of shape, and didn't 
want to go through all that would have been necessary to make the effort. 
Nowadays, with radio and television announcers spouting records every time 
a player comes to bat, I would have known about my hits and probably would 
have stayed to make 3,000 of them."[16] See:Career Statistics for a complete 
explanation. [17] By the 1940s, Rice had become a poultry farmer. His farm 
was located in Maryland next to that of Harold L. Ickes, the United States 
Secretary of the Interior. Rice and Ickes employed several workers of Japanese 
descent who were displaced from the West Coast by order of the U.S. Army 
after the outbreak of World War II.[18] Rice was inducted into the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1963. He and three other players – John Clarkson, Elmer 
Flick and Eppa Rixey – were elected unanimously that year by the Hall of 
Fame's Veterans Committee, which considered players who had been inactive 
for 20 or more years. Rice said that he was glad to be inducted and said 
that he thought he would probably be elected if he survived long enough.[19] 
Rice remarried twice, first to Edith and at age 69 to Mary Kendall Adams. 
Mary had two daughters by a prior marriage, Margaret and Christine.[20] 
In 1965 Rice and his family were interviewed in advance of a program to 
honor his career. The interviewer asked Rice about the tornado, and as 
he told of the storm and its destruction, his wife and children learned 
for the first time of the existence of his previous family.[21] Rice made 
one of his last public appearances at the Baseball Hall of Fame induction 
ceremonies honoring Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle in August 1974. He died 
of cancer that year on October 13.[13] He was buried in Woodside Cemetery 
in Brinklow, Maryland. After Rice's death, officials could not immediately 
locate the letter describing his World Series play. However, in an interview, 
his wife Mary said, "He did catch it. You don't have to worry about that 
anymore."[13] When the letter was located, its conclusion stated, "At no
