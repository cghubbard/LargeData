Ridgefield Park is a village in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. 
as of the 2010 United States Census, the village's population was 12,729,[8][9][10] 
reflecting a decline of 144 (-1.1%) from the 12,873 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 419 (+3.4%) from the 12,454 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] Of 565 municipalities statewide, Ridgefield Park 
is one of only four with a village type of government in New Jersey, though 
it operates a Walsh Act (City Commission) form of government. Of the four 
New Jersey villages, only Loch Arbour had retained the village form of 
government, while Ridgewood operates under the Council-Manager form and 
the Township of South Orange Village operates under a Special Charter form 
with many characteristics of village government.[20] Ridgefield Park was 
formed as a village on June 15, 1892, within Ridgefield Township, based 
on the results of a referendum passed on June 6, 1892. Overpeck Township 
was formed on March 23, 1897, to be coextensive with Ridgefield Park village, 
and was created within Ridgefield Township for the purpose of administering 
a Board of Education. Portions of the village were taken gained in both 
1921 and 1926 from Bogota and Teaneck. On May 31, 1938, Overpeck Township 
became Ridgefield Park Township.[21] The village was named for the area's 
terrain.[22] The village's Fourth of July Parade, first established in 
1894, is said to be the longest continuously celebrated such event in New 
Jersey and one of the oldest in the country.[23] The village eliminated 
its July 4 fireworks in 2009, citing the $50,000 cost in the face of the 
difficult economy, but committed to retain its parade.[24] According to 
the United States Census Bureau, the village had a total area of 1.919 
square miles (4.971 km2), including 1.723 square miles (4.464 km2) of land
