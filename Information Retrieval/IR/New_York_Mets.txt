The New York Mets are an American professional baseball team based in the 
New York City borough of Queens. The Mets compete in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East division. The Mets 
are one of two Major League clubs based in New York City; the other is 
the New York Yankees. One of baseball's first expansion teams, the Mets 
were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the Brooklyn 
Dodgers and the New York Giants. The Mets' colors are composed of the Dodgers' 
blue and the Giants' orange, which also comprises the outer two bands of 
the New York City flag. During the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets played 
their home games at the Polo Grounds. From 1964 to 2008, the Mets' home 
ballpark was Shea Stadium. In 2009, they moved into their current ballpark, 
Citi Field.[4] In their 1962 inaugural season, the Mets posted a record 
of 40–120, the worst regular season record since MLB went to a 162-game 
schedule (two games were canceled). The team never finished better than 
second to last until the 1969 "Miracle Mets" beat the Baltimore Orioles 
in the 1969 World Series in what is considered one of the biggest upsets 
in World Series history.[5] Since then, they have played in four additional 
World Series, including a dramatic run in 1973 that ended in a seven-game 
loss to the Oakland Athletics, a second championship in 1986 over the Boston 
Red Sox, a Subway Series loss against their cross-town rivals the New York 
Yankees in 2000,[6] and a five-game loss to the Kansas City Royals in 2015. 
The Mets made the playoffs in 2006 when they came within one game of the 
World Series, losing to the eventual champion St. Louis Cardinals in the 
NLCS.[7] The Mets missed the playoffs with losses on the last day of the 
regular season in 2007 and 2008.[8] The Mets made the playoffs in 2015 
for the first time in nine years, and won their first NL pennant in 15 
years. The team again returned to the playoffs in 2016, this time with 
a wild card berth. This is the team's second back-to-back playoff appearance, 
the first occurring during the 1999 and 2000 seasons. After the 1957 season, 
the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated from New York to California 
to become the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants, respectively, 
leaving the largest city in the United States with no National League franchise 
and only one major league team in the American League (AL) - the New York 
Yankees. With the threat of a New York team in a third league, the National 
League expanded, adding the New York Mets after requests from William Shea. 
The new team took as its primary colors the blue of the Dodgers and the 
orange of the Giants as a symbolic return to National League baseball to 
New York. Blue and orange are also the colors of the New York City flag. 
The team took their name from a 19th-century club, the New York Metropolitans; 
that club was named after "Metropolis", a nickname for New York City.[3][4] 
For the first two years of its existence, the team played its home games 
at the historic Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan. In 1964, they moved into 
newly constructed Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, where the Mets played 
until the 2008 season. In 2009, the club moved into Citi Field, adjacent 
to the former Shea Stadium site. During their history, the Mets have won 
two World Series titles (1969 and 1986), five National League pennants 
(1969, 1973, 1986, 2000, 2015) and six National League East titles (1969, 
1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the postseason 
as the National League wild card team in 1999, 2000, and 2016. The Mets 
have appeared in five World Series, more than any other expansion team 
in MLB history. Their two championships are the most titles among expansion 
teams, equal to the tallies of the Toronto Blue Jays, Miami Marlins, and 
Kansas City Royals.[9] The Mets held the New York baseball single-season 
attendance record for 29 years. They broke the Yankees' 1948 record by 
drawing nearly 2.7 million spectators in 1970. The Mets broke their own 
record five times before the record was regained by the Yankees in 1999.[10][11] 
The 1962 Mets posted a 40–120 record, a record for the most losses in a 
season since 1899. In 1966, the Mets famously bypassed future Hall of Famer 
Reggie Jackson in the amateur draft, instead selecting Steve Chilcott, 
who never played in the majors. But the following year, they acquired future 
Hall of Famer Tom Seaver in a lottery. Seaver helped the 1969 "Miracle 
Mets" win the new National League East division title, then defeat the 
Atlanta Braves to win the National League pennant and the heavily favored 
Baltimore Orioles to win the 1969 World Series. In 1973, the Mets rallied 
from 5th place to win the division, despite a record of only 82–79. They 
shocked the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds "Big Red Machine" in the NLCS 
and pushed the defending World Series champion Oakland Athletics to a seventh 
game, but lost the series. Notably, 1973 was the only NL East title between 
1970 and 1980 that wasn't won by either the Philadelphia Phillies or the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.[12][13] Star pitcher Tom Seaver was traded in 1977, 
on a day remembered as "the Midnight Massacre",[14] and the Mets fell into 
last place for several years. The franchise turned around in the mid-1980s. 
During this time the Mets also drafted slugger Darryl Strawberry (#1 in 
1980) and 1985 Cy Young Award winner Dwight Gooden (#5 in 1982). In addition, 
former National League MVP and perennial Gold Glove winner Keith Hernandez 
was obtained by the Mets in 1983. In 1985, they acquired Hall of Fame catcher 
Gary Carter from the Montreal Expos and won 98 games, but narrowly missed 
the playoffs. In 1986, they easily won the division with a record of 108-54, 
one of the best in National League history. They won a dramatic NLCS in 
six games over the Houston Astros. The sixth game of the series went sixteen 
innings long, the longest playoff game in history until 2005. They came 
within one strike of losing the World Series against the Boston Red Sox 
before a series of hits and defensive miscues ultimately led to an error 
by Boston's Bill Buckner which gave the Mets a game 6 victory. They then 
won Game 7 to win their second World Series title. The Mets continued playing 
well after 1986 and won the division in 1988, but were eliminated from 
the playoffs that year and declined into the 1990s. They were out of contention 
until the 1997 season when they were in wild card contention until the 
final week of the season. In 1998, the Mets acquired catcher Mike Piazza 
in a blockbuster trade and missed the postseason by only one game. In 1999, 
they made the playoffs after a one-game playoff but lost the 1999 National 
League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves. In 2000, they easily 
clinched a wild card spot in the playoffs, and earned a trip to the 2000 
World Series against their crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees for a 
"Subway Series". The Mets were defeated by the Yankees in five games. The 
Mets had a near playoff miss in 2001 and struggled from 2002 to 2004. In 
the aftermath of the 2004 season, the Mets hired a new general manager, 
Omar Minaya, who immediately turned the franchise around by signing pitcher 
Pedro Martínez and hiring a new manager, Willie Randolph. The Mets finished 
2005 four games over .500, and the franchise's resurgence was complete 
by 2006 as they won 97 games and the NL East title behind new acquisitions 
Carlos Beltrán and Carlos Delgado, as well as young superstars José Reyes 
and David Wright. The Mets advanced to game seven of the 2006 NLCS but 
lost after Yadier Molina's game-winning two-run home run in the top of 
the ninth inning. The Mets loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom 
of the inning, but Adam Wainwright struck out Beltran looking with a devastating 
curveball. In 2007, the Mets entered the final 17 games in the season with 
a seven-game lead in the division. But the team went on an ill-timed losing 
streak, losing 11 of the next 15 games and needing to win their final two 
games to make the playoffs. The Mets won their penultimate game, but on 
the final day of the season, Tom Glavine gave up seven runs in the first 
inning en route to an 8-1 loss that eliminated the team from contention. 
The Philadelphia Phillies won the division by one game after a win on the 
season's last day. The Mets held a more modest 3.5-game lead after 145 
games of the 2008 season, their final season at Shea Stadium. While their 
7–10 mark down the stretch was better than the previous season's 5–12, 
it still allowed the Phillies to pass them once again for the division 
crown, which they lost by three games. The Mets opened Citi Field in 2009, 
but were not a factor due to a rash of injuries to numerous key players 
including Reyes, Carlos Beltrán, Carlos Delgado, Óliver Pérez and Liván 
Hernández. The effect of the injuries plummeted the Mets to a 70–92 record. 
The Mets improved to a 79-83 in 2010, but still finished in fourth place, 
missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year. After the 2010 season, 
the Mets fired Minaya and manager Jerry Manuel. Former Oakland Athletics 
G.M. and MLB executive Sandy Alderson was hired to run the team, who hired 
Terry Collins as manager. In 2012, Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz 
settled a lawsuit brought against them on behalf of the victims of Bernard 
Madoff's Ponzi scheme for $162 million. As a result of this agreement the 
liquidator, Irving Picard, agreed to drop the charges that Wilpon and Katz 
blindly went along with the scheme for their personal benefit. Picard had 
originally sought to recover $1 billion from the Wilpon family and Katz, 
but settled for $162 million along with the admission that neither the 
Wilpons nor Katz had any knowledge of the Ponzi scheme. In 2011–2012, Mets 
ownership sold twelve minority 4% shares (48%) of the franchise at $20 
million apiece to provide a cash infusion of $240 million for the team.[15] 
Despite yet another losing season, the Mets made history in 2011 when closer 
Jason Isringhausen converted his 300th save with the team, the third player 
in franchise history to reach the milestone while with the organization 
(after John Franco and Billy Wagner). Also, Reyes became the first Met 
in franchise history to win a National League batting title, posting a 
.337 batting average. In 2012, as the Mets tried to bounce back from three 
consecutive losing seasons, they lost star shortstop Reyes to free agency, 
when he signed with the Miami Marlins. The team started out strong, getting 
a career-year performance from the league's only knuckleballer, R.A. Dickey, 
and strong production from Wright. But they faltered midseason and ended 
with a 74-88 record, again finishing fourth in the division. Prior to the 
2012 season the Mets had yet to throw a no-hitter, and the franchise's 
hurlers had gone 8,019[16] games without pitching one – longer than any 
other major-league franchise. They were one of only two major-league teams 
to never have a pitcher throw a no-hitter (the other being the San Diego 
Padres). However, on June 1, 2012 Johan Santana pitched a no-hitter against 
the St. Louis Cardinals. Averting the spotlight from Carlos Beltrán's return 
to Citi Field, Santana turned a routine game into a memorable moment in 
Mets history. Santana risked being removed from the game after he went 
over his limit of 110 pitches, placed by the team because of his shoulder 
surgery. Still Santana stayed in the game and threw 134 total pitches that 
evening in an 8-0 Mets victory, helped by a few great defensive plays as 
well as a controversial foul-ball call (coincidentally on Beltran), to 
pull off the first no-hitter in Mets history.[17] That was the high point 
of 2012 along with pitcher R.A. Dickey winning the National League Cy Young 
Award. This would be Dickey's final season as a Mets though as he along 
with Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas were traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for 
prospects Travis d'Arnaud, Noah Syndergaard, Wuilmer Becerra, and veteran 
catcher John Buck. The 2013 season brought another 74-88 finish but they 
were able to finish in 3rd place. The highlight of the season was sweeping 
the season series between their cross town rivals Yankees, a first since 
interleague play started in 1997. Prior to the start of the 2014 season 
the Mets made a big splash in the free agent market by signing former New 
York Yankees outfielder Curtis Granderson to a 4-year $60 million contract. 
They also signed former Oakland Athletics starting pitcher Bartolo Colón 
to a 2-year deal to help offset losing ace pitcher Matt Harvey for the 
year after he required Tommy John surgery. They would improve to 79-83 
and finish the season tied for 2nd place with Atlanta but it was their 
6th consecutive season where they finished under .500. Pitcher Jacob deGrom 
would win the National League Rookie of the Year.[18] On April 23, 2015 
the Mets tied a franchise season record of eleven straight wins. For the 
first time in its history the Mets won ten straight homestand games, becoming 
the 7th team since 1900 to win at least 10 straight homestand games.[19] 
On September 26, 2015, the Mets clinched the NL East division title, and 
thus their first postseason berth since 2006, by defeating the Cincinnati 
Reds 10-2. They defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, three games 
to two, and swept the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS for their first pennant 
in 15 years. In the 2015 World Series, they were defeated by the Kansas 
City Royals in five games. After the season ended, pitcher Matt Harvey 
won the NL Comeback Player of the Year award. Outfielder Yoenis Céspedes 
won the AL Gold Glove award as a left fielder. "Meet the Mets" is the Mets' 
signature song, written in 1961, one year before the first season, by Bill 
Katz and Ruth Roberts. It is played on the radio, during television broadcasts 
and at Mets' home games.[20] Mr. Met is the official mascot of the New 
York Mets. He was introduced on the cover of game programs in 1963, when 
the Mets were still playing at the Polo Grounds in northern Manhattan.[21] 
When the Mets moved to Shea Stadium in 1964, fans were introduced to a 
live costumed version.[21] Mr. Met is believed to have been the first mascot 
in Major League Baseball to exist in human (as opposed to artistically 
rendered) form.[21] Mrs. Met (formerly Lady Met) is the female counterpart 
to Mr. Met.[22] The Mets' colors are blue and orange, originally chosen 
to honor the city's history of National League baseball; blue for the Brooklyn 
Dodgers, and orange for the New York Giants. Blue and orange are also the 
colors of New York City, as seen on its flag.[4] In 1998, black was officially 
added to the color scheme, although beginning with 2012 the black elements 
in the uniform began to be phased out, and were eliminated in 2013. The 
cap logo is identical to the logo used by the New York Giants in their 
final years, and is on a blue cap reminiscent of the caps worn by the Brooklyn 
Dodgers. In the primary logo, designed by sports cartoonist Ray Gatto, 
each part of the skyline has special meaning—at the left is a church spire, 
symbolic of Brooklyn, the borough of churches; the second building from 
the left is the Williamsburgh Savings Bank, the tallest building in Brooklyn; 
next is the Woolworth Building; after a general skyline view of midtown 
comes the Empire State Building; at the far right is the United Nations 
Building. The bridge in the center symbolizes that the Mets, by bringing 
National League baseball back to New York, represent all five boroughs.[4] 
With the introduction of black as an official color, an alternate team 
logo was created in 1999. It is identical to the original logo, but the 
skyline is black instead of blue and the "Mets" script is blue trimmed 
in orange and white instead of orange trimmed in white (the alternate black 
jerseys displayed the primary blue and orange logo on the left sleeves 
in 1998; in 1999 this was changed to the alternate black and blue logo). 
The logo fell into disuse after the Mets dropped the alternate black jerseys 
and caps in 2012. Also in 1999, the logo received a slight alteration. 
The "NY" to the left of the team script was removed. No other notable changes 
were made. Currently, the Mets wear an assortment of uniforms. The home 
uniforms are white with blue pinstripes, and feature the "Mets" script 
and block lettering and numbers in blue with orange outline. The uniforms 
are paired with a standard blue cap featuring the "NY" script in orange, 
plus blue undersleeves, belts and socks. The white pinstriped uniforms 
replaced both the cream pinstriped uniform and the alternate white uniform 
starting with the 2015 season. The gray road jerseys feature a radially-arched 
"NEW YORK" script in Tiffany style, player numerals and names in blue outlined 
in orange, and blue placket and sleeve piping. Like the home uniforms, 
the road grays are worn with blue caps, undersleeves, belts and socks. 
On November 14, 2012, the Mets introduced two new blue alternate jerseys. 
The home alternate features the "Mets" script, player numerals and names 
in orange outlined in white, while the road alternate feature the "NEW 
YORK" script, player numerals and names in gray outlined in orange.[23] 
On December 10, 2012, the Mets unveiled an alternate blue fielding cap, 
featuring an orange brim and a white trim around the orange "NY" insignia.[24] 
Currently it is only worn in games featuring the home blue alternates. 
For 2015, another alternate blue cap, this time featuring the "NY" in gray 
outlined in orange, was introduced, and is paired with the road blue alternates. 
For the 2014 season, a Mr. Met sleeve patch was added to the blue alternate 
jerseys.[25] The Mets' standard blue batting helmet with the "NY" in orange 
is currently used regardless of the cap and jersey design they wear. This 
was in contrast to previous seasons where they play with alternate batting 
helmets to match their caps and jerseys. Roberto Alomar Richie Ashburn

Nelson Major League Baseball retired Jackie Robinson's number 42 on April 
15, 1997, when the Mets played the Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Butch Huskey 
wore the number throughout the rest of his Mets career because of a grandfather 
clause placed on the retired number by MLB.[28] Mo Vaughn also wore 42 
during his stint with the Mets, because of the same clause.[28] On the 
final opening day at Shea Stadium, April 8, 2008, the Mets unveiled a sign 
bearing the name "Shea" next to the team's retired numbers honoring William 
Shea and his contributions to the franchise.[29] The Mets – New York Yankees 
rivalry is the latest incarnation of the Subway Series, the competition 
between New York City's teams, the American League New York Yankees and 
the National League Mets. Until Interleague play started, the two teams 
had only met in exhibition games. Since the inception of interleague play 
the two teams have met every regular season since 1997, and since 1999 
they have met six times each season, playing two three-game series, one 
in each team's ballpark. From the 2013 season however the number of games 
was reduced to four, two at each ballpark with the Mets winning six of 
the last eight games in that span. They have made the postseason in the 
same year four times: 1999, 2000, 2006, and 2015, and faced off in the 
2000 World Series. The Braves–Mets rivalry is a rivalry between two teams 
in the National League East, featuring the Atlanta Braves and the Mets.[33] 
Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the 
Braves in the 1969 NLCS, en route to their first World Series championship, 
the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff 
appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially 
heated until the 1990s, when division realignment put the Mets and the 
Braves in the same division.[34][35] The two teams faced each other again 
in the 1999 NLCS, and the Braves won the series four games to two. However, 
they would go on to lose to the Yankees in the 1999 World Series. The rivalry 
between the Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies from 2006 to 2008 was said 
to be among the "hottest" rivalries in the National League.[36][37] The 
two National League East divisional rivals have met each other recently 
in playoff, division, and wild card races. Aside from several brawls in 
the 1980s, the rivalry remained low-key before the 2006 season,[38] as 
the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time. Since 2006, the 
teams have battled for playoff position. The Mets won the division in 2006 
and contended in 2007 and 2008, while the Phillies won five consecutive 
division titles from 2007 to 2011.[39] The Phillies' 2007 Eastern Division 
Title was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven-game 
lead with 17 games remaining while losing 12 of 18 games that season to 
the Phillies, including being swept at home in the first 3 games of the 
remaining 17, dropping their lead from 7 games to 3.5. Front Office Coordinators

York Mets Foundation is the philanthropic organization of the New York 
Mets. Founded in 1963, it funds and promotes charitable causes in the Mets 
community. One of these causes is Tuesday's Children, is a non-profit family 
service organization that "has made a long term commitment to meet the 
needs of every family who lost a loved one in the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001".[40] The Mets host the annual Welcome Home Dinner, 
which raised over $550,000 for the Mets Foundation in 2012. All proceeds 
were distributed to Katz Institute for Women's Health and Katz Women's 
Hospitals of North Shore-LIJ Health System and The Leukemia & Lymphoma 
Society. Most Mets games are carried by SportsNet New York (SNY), a joint 
venture of the Mets and Comcast SportsNet. The team's terrestrial broadcast 
home is WPIX, where the team has broadcast games since 1999. Longtime Mets 
radio announcer Gary Cohen does the play-by-play, having moved to television 
with the launch of SNY in 2006. Former Mets Keith Hernandez and Ron Darling 
are the color commentators. In early January 2016, Keith Hernandez re-signed 
with SNY. Reports indicate that Hernandez received a raise and three-year 
contract.[41] As of 2014[update], the Mets' radio flagship is WOR.[42] 
The Mets were previously carried by WFAN, which inherited the team's broadcast 
rights from WHN when it took over its frequency in 1987, and WFAN-FM, which 
simulcasts the AM signal. Spanish language broadcasts are carried by WEPN. 
Since 2012, Howie Rose and Josh Lewin have been the radio broadcast team; 
they share play-by-play and analyst duties. Rose, who has spent much of 
his career covering the Mets, replaced Bob Murphy as Gary Cohen's partner 
in 2004 following Murphy's retirement. Lewin joined the broadcast after 
the team parted ways with Wayne Hagin following the 2011 season. Pregame 
and postgame shows are hosted by Wayne Randazzo. Both Rose and Lewin have 
other broadcasting duties that conflict with their baseball duties. Rose 
is the television voice of the New York Islanders while Lewin is the radio 
voice for the San Diego Chargers. In late season NHL games that conflict 
with Rose's Mets duties, Jiggs McDonald substitutes for him for Islander 
games most times, but Lewin will sometimes man a booth with Randazzo. Lewin's 
duties with the Chargers prevent him from calling weekend games throughout
