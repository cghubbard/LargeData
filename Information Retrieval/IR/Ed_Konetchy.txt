Edward Joseph Konetchy (September 3, 1885 – May 27, 1947), nicknamed "Big 
Ed" and "The Candy Kid", was an American first baseman in Major League 
Baseball for a number of teams, primarily in the National League, from 
1907 to 1921. He played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1907–1913), Pittsburgh 
Pirates (1914), Pittsburgh Rebels of the Federal League (1915), Boston 
Braves (1916–1918), Brooklyn Robins (1919–1921), and Philadelphia Phillies 
(1921). He batted and threw right-handed. Konetchy was born in La Crosse, 
Wisconsin. While he was considered an above-average hitter (he batted over 
.300 four times) he was more known around the league for his supreme consistency, 
his never-faltering speed, and his high degree of defensive skill at first 
base. Konetchy made his Major League debut with the St. Louis Cardinals 
in 1907, and went on to acquire 25 stolen bases in 1909, hit .302 in 1910, 
and pick up 88 RBIs in 1911.[1] He also had a 20-game hitting streak in 
1910. In 1911, with the Cards only three games out of first place in early 
July, the team was involved in a train crash on its way from Philadelphia 
to Boston. 47 passengers were injured, while twelve died. None of the Cardinals 
were seriously injured, due to a pre-trip change in the location of their 
car to the rear of the train. Konetchy and Cards manager Roger Bresnahan 
led the rescue effort, carrying many passengers to safety, some of whom 
may have died. Despite posting their first winning season since 1901, the 
Cardinals never recovered from the incident, finishing a distant fifth; 
but Konetchy led the NL with 38 doubles, and his own team with six home 
runs and 88 RBIs. He led the Cardinals in hits in 1909, 1910, 1911, and 
1912.[2] When Konetchy moved to the Pirates in 1914, he had a below-average 
season, followed by an above-average one in the same city, but on a different 
team in a different league. Playing for Pittsburgh of the Federal League, 
he tied his career high with a .314 average, with 10 home runs and 93 RBIs. 
Soon, he was back in the National League, and he was picking up hits in 
droves. In 1920 with Brooklyn, Konetchy got his only shot at postseason 
play during his career, although Brooklyn (93-61) lost the World Series 
in seven games to the 98–56 Cleveland Indians. In the Series, Konetchy 
picked up four hits in 23 at bats, a .174 average. However, he did have 
2 RBIs in the Series, and three walks. By the end of 1920, he had surpassed 
2000 career hits and was quite high on the all-time leaderboard (into the 
top 25). His final season was spent in Brooklyn and then Philadelphia, 
when the Phillies selected him off waivers on July 4, 1921. Konetchy's 
major league career ended there. Besides playing first base, he had tried 
out pitching, having thrown in 3 games. One of them, at Chicago in 1918, 
was a fairly bad start in which he pitched a complete game and allowed 
8 runs (6 earned). This is believed to be the last instance of a non-pitcher 
pitching even the first two innings of a game: Alvin Dark and Cesar Tovar 
pitched a first inning, once each. His two relief appearances were more 
successful: in one, he went 4 and 2/3 innings and gave up no runs on one 
hit to get the win. In 2085 games, he batted a solid .281 with 74 home 
runs and 992 RBIs. He had 2150 career hits in 7649 at bats. Konetchy also 
picked up 255 career stolen bases. He ended with a total of 344 doubles, 
and after having reached doubles figures in triples ten times, retired 
with 182, tying him for the 11th highest total in history. After leaving 
the majors, he played with Fort Worth of the Texas League from 1922 through 
1927, batting .345 with 41 home runs in 1925. After retiring, he went into 
business with pitching star Joe Pate. He died in Fort Worth, Texas at the 
age of 62. The cause was heart disease. He was posthumously inducted into 
the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1961. His interment was located
