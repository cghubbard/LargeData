industries existed at one time, including the manufacturing of canvas gloves 
and silk products. The population was 5,719 at the 2010 census. The name 
Moosic probably derives from the Unami language of the Lenape people, meaning 
"elk place."[2][3][4] The Lenape, a Native American people, are the earliest-known 
inhabitants of Moosic. The borough was incorporated on December 9, 1898.[5] 
Before incorporation, the villages of Moosic and Greenwood had been a part 
of Lackawanna Township.[5] From 1886 to 1987, Moosic was the site of Rocky
