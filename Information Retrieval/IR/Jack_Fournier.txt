John Frank "Jack" Fournier (September 28, 1889 – September 5, 1973) was 
an American baseball first baseman who played fifteen seasons in Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He played for the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, 
St. Louis Cardinals, Brooklyn Robins, and Boston Braves from 1912–1918 
and 1920–1927. Fournier died on September 5, 1973 at a nursing home in 
Tacoma, Washington. Fournier was notorious for having outstanding batting 
abilities, but subpar fielding abilities. When purchased by the White Sox 
from the Boston Red Sox in 1912, Fournier presented Clarence "Pants" Rowland 
and a half-dozen other managers with the dilemma of what to do with his 
pure hitting, but poor fielding abilities. Rowland solved that problem 
in 1916, a year after Fournier had led the AL in slugging, by replacing 
him at first base with the marginal Jack Ness. Before 1920, a first baseman 
was one of the key fielding positions because of the constant threat of 
the bunt; Fournier could not field the bunt with any degree of competence. 
Fournier hit .350 for the Yankees in limited duty in 1918 before they passed 
him off to the Cardinals. After three productive years in St. Louis, Fournier 
was dealt to Brooklyn on February 15, 1923. Fournier said he would quit 
the game rather than leave St. Louis, but he eventually ended his holdout 
and reported to the Dodgers. Fournier had found his spot, among an offensive 
unit that included Zack Wheat, Milt Stock, and Zack Taylor. He turned in 
a six-for-six performance on June 29 of that year, hit .351, and made a 
league-high 21 errors. In 1924, Fournier led the NL with 27 home runs, 
and in 1925 was second to Rogers Hornsby with 130 RBI. Fournier hit 136 
career home runs in 14 seasons while rapping .313 with a .392 on-base percentage. 
He also racked up three straight seasons (1923–25) with 20+ home runs, 
20+ doubles, a .400 or higher on-base percentage, a .330 plus batting average, 
and 90+ runs. Bill James ranked him as the 35th best first baseman of all-time.[1] 
Following his playing career, Fournier was the head coach at UCLA from 
1934 to 1936. He later scouted for the St. Louis Browns (1938–1942, 1944–1949), 
Chicago Cubs (1950–1957), Detroit Tigers (1960), and Cincinnati Reds (1961–1962).
