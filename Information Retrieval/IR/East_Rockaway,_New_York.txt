East Rockaway is a village in Nassau County, New York, in the United States. 
The population was 9,818 at the 2010 census.[1] The Incorporated Village 
of East Rockaway is in the town Hempstead, adjacent to Lynbrook, Hewlett, 
Rockville Centre, and Oceanside. The primary ethnicities are mainly Italian 
and Irish. The Waverly Park neighborhood, near the Hewlett-East Rockaway 
Jewish Center [1] and along the border with Hewlett, has a sizable Jewish 
community. Originally named Near Rockaway, the village began as a shipping 
and trading center for the south shore of Long Island. The village's location 
was desirable for ships because of its deep channels inland. Eventually 
a grist mill was built on the Mill River by Joseph Haviland through a land 
grant in 1688. The Haviland-Davison Grist Mill, located in Memorial Park, 
was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[2] Later 
an oven was purchased to make bread for the surrounding population. The 
village prospered in shipping and milling over the years, even after several 
sales of the land.[3] The village's name was changed in 1869 to East Rockaway. 
The village was incorporated in 1900, and Floyd Johnson was president. 
At the time of incorporation the town had a population of 969.[4] Back 
in the 1960s a student from East Rockaway High School, named Donald Scaglione, 
attempted to steal the school's bell from the bell tower.[citation needed] 
Unknowingly the bell weighed too much to carry, even for Don, who was one 
of the football team's star offensive linemen. The bell was dropped. The 
Scaglione family was responsible for fixing the bell. The bell tower remains 
empty as of October 18, 2009. As of the census[7] of 2000, there were 10,414 
people, 3,926 households, and 2,787 families residing in the village. The
