Clark is the official team mascot of Major League Baseball's Chicago Cubs. 
He was announced on January 13, 2014 as the first official mascot in the 
modern history of the Cubs franchise.[1] He was introduced that day at 
the Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center's pediatric developmental 
center along with some of the Cubs' top prospects such as number one draft 
pick Kris Bryant and Albert Almora, Jorge Soler, Mike Olt and Eric Jokisch.[2] 
Over a dozen Cubs prospects were attending the Cubs' Rookie Development 
Program that week.[3] The Cubs become the 27th team in Major League Baseball 
to have a mascot, leaving the Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and 
New York Yankees as the remaining franchises without mascots.[1] According 
to the Cubs' press release, Clark is a response to fan demands (expressed 
via surveys and interviews)[3] for more kid-friendly elements at Wrigley 
Field Cubs games to keep pace with games in other cities that have more 
to offer youth fans.[4] He is a "young, friendly Cub" who will wear a backwards 
baseball cap and greet fans entering Wrigley Field, which is located at 
the corner of Clark Street (for which he is named) and Addison Street.[1] 
North Clark Street borders the third base side of Wrigley Field.[4] According 
to the Cubs, the fictional character Clark is descended from Joa, the franchise's 
original live Bears mascot in 1916.[1] According to the various stories 
"The mascot also will greet fans at Wrigley Field before and during games, 
as well as assist kids in running the bases on Family Sundays. Families
