The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in The Bronx, New York City, New York. They play in the American League 
East division. This list consists of the owners, general managers (GMs) 
and other executives of the Yankees. The GM controls player transactions, 
hires the manager and coaching staff, and negotiates with players and agents 
regarding contracts.[1] The longest-tenured general manager in team history 
is Ed Barrow, who served in that role for 23 years.[2] He was inducted 
in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. The longest-tenured owner in team 
history is George Steinbrenner, who was the team's principal owner from 
1973 until his death in 2010. The Yankees are currently overseen by Hal 
Steinbrenner, who owns the team in conjunction with his brother Hank Steinbrenner, 
and GM Brian Cashman. During the 1901 and 1902 seasons, the franchise played 
in Baltimore as the "Baltimore Orioles". They became defunct, but were 
purchased by William Stephen Devery and Frank J. Farrell for $18,000 and 
moved to New York in 1903.[3] Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu 
Huston purchased the Yankees in 1915,[4] and Ruppert bought out Huston 
in 1922.[5] Dan Topping, Larry MacPhail, and Del Webb purchased the Yankees 
from Ruppert's estate in 1945.[6] Topping and Webb forced MacPhail out 
of the Yankees ownership group due to his confrontational behavior after 
the 1947 World Series.[7] In 1964, Topping and Webb sold the team to CBS,[8] 
during which time the franchise struggled. Selling the team at a loss,[9] 
CBS sold the team to a group headed by George Steinbrenner in 1973.[10] 
While Steinbrenner initially owned less than half of the team, he bought 
out many of his partners, eventually owning 70% of the team.[11][12] John 
McMullen, one of Steinbrenner's limited partners, said, "There is nothing 
in life quite so limited as being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner."[13] 
Under Steinbrenner's ownership, YankeeNets was formed after a merger of 
the business operations of the Yankees and New Jersey Nets.[14] After the 
Nets were sold to Bruce Ratner, YankeeNets became a limited liability company 
(LLC) known as Yankee Global Enterprises.[15] The LLC owns the Yankees 
and the YES Network. Hal Steinbrenner succeeded his father as control person 
of the Yankees in 2008.[16] Four Yankees GMs are enshrined in the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame: Ed Barrow,[23] George Weiss,[24] Larry MacPhail,[25] 
and his son, Lee MacPhail.[26] Ralph Houk,[27] Gene Michael,[28] Lou Piniella,[29] 
and Bob Watson[30] were former Yankees players. Houk,[31] Michael[32] and 
Piniella[33] served as field managers for the Yankees before becoming GM.
