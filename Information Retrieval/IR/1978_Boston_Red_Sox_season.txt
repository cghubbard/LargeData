The 1978 Boston Red Sox season was a season in American baseball. It involved 
the Red Sox finishing second in the American League East with a record 
of 99 wins and 64 losses, after at one point having a 10-game lead. [1] 
[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Boston at one 
point in July held a 14-game lead over rival New York. However, after working 
their way back capped by a 4-game sweep at Fenway, the Yanks tied the division. 
Then, in a one-game playoff, the Yanks won 5-4 with the help of a home 
run by Bucky Dent.[7] The Yanks went on to win the World Series in 6 games 
over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the 
Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their 
manager during a series at Fenway Park.[7][8] Infielders Coaches Note:
