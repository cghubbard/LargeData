Easley is a city in Pickens County (with parts extending into Anderson 
County) in the State of South Carolina. It is a principal city of the Greenville–Mauldin–Easley 
Metropolitan Statistical Area. Most of the city lies in Pickens County, 
with only a very small portion of the city in Anderson County. Easley has 
been hosting the Big League World Series for several years. The Upper South 
Carolina State Fair is located about 2 miles (3 km) east of Easley. It 
is held annually in early September. In 1791 Washington District was established 
by the state legislature out of the former Cherokee territory. Rockville 
was also created in 1791 but changed to Pickensville in 1792. Pickensville 
became the district seat of Washington District which was then composed 
of Greenville and Pendleton Counties. In 1798 Washington District was divided 
into Greenville and Pendleton Districts. In 1828 Pendleton District was 
divided further with the upper portion becoming Anderson County and the 
lower becoming Pickens County named after Andrew Pickens. Robert Holcombe 
became a co-founder of the town by starting off as a farmer in the area. 
His farming ventures enabled him to establish the storeroom in 1845 as 
the first business in the area. The namesake of the town of Easley comes 
from William King Easley. Easley was born in Pickens County, South Carolina 
in 1825. Easley and four others from Greenville represented the Greenville 
area in the South Carolina Secession Convention. When the American Civil 
War erupted, Easley raised a company of cavalry from Greenville and Pickens 
counties. During the war Easley served as a major in the Confederate Army.[4] 
After the civil war Easley became a local attorney and persuaded the Atlanta 
and Charlotte Air Line Railway to be established through Pickensville by 
raising $100,000 to invest in the railroad. Holcombe was considered to 
be the first citizen of Easley building the first dwelling and train depot 
in the town. Holcombe became the first mayor of the town and was also the 
first agent of the train depot.[5] The town of Easley was chartered in 
1873. The Pickensville Post Office became Easley Post Office in 1875. The 
railroad transformed Easley into an industrious and thriving textile town. 
The Easley Textile Company, later known as Swirl Inc., came to Easley in 
1953. The construction of U.S. Route 123 helped establish retail and new 
business to Easley. On April 25, 1951 a department store was on fire threatening 
many buildings in downtown Easley but the quick response of the fire department 
extinguished the fire.[6] Easley is located in southeastern Pickens County
