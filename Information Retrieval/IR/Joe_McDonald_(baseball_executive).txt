Joseph A. McDonald (born July 5, 1929 in Staten Island, New York[1]) is 
a former front office executive in American Major League Baseball. He played 
prominent roles in the New York Mets' organization during his tenure there 
between 1965 and 1980. McDonald was the Mets' administrative secretary, 
minor league clubs, where he dealt with farm system operations in 1965–66. 
In 1967, he was the director of scouting. In 1968, he moved up and became 
director of minor league operations, and he stayed in that position until 
1971. In 1972, he served as the Mets' director of player development operations. 
In 1973, he again became director of minor league operations, and he stayed 
in that position until October 1974, when he was promoted to general manager. 
He served in that role until 1978. In 1979, he was named a vice president 
and also worked as an assistant general manager. He stayed in that position 
until he was fired on February 21, 1980 when the team was sold.[2] In 1981, 
he became the St. Louis Cardinals' executive assistant, where he served 
as an assistant general manager to Whitey Herzog, the Cards' GM and field 
manager. McDonald and Herzog had worked closely together in the Mets' farm 
system from 1966–72. He was assistant GM in St. Louis until April 10, 1982, 
when he became the Cardinals' general manager, thus enabling Herzog to 
focus on his on-field responsibilities. McDonald resigned from that post 
on January 3, 1985. In 1987, he became the Detroit Tigers' director of 
player development (he also served as vice president). He stayed in that 
position until 1991, when he became a senior vice president as well as 
general manager through 1992. He later scouted for the California Angels,[3] 
Colorado Rockies[4][5] and in 2004 he became a scout at the professional 
level for the Boston Red Sox, based in Lakeland, Florida, the position 
he still held during the 2013 season.[6] His son, Jody McDonald, is a sports 
talk radio host who has worked in Philadelphia and New York City. McDonald 
has earned five World Series rings: 1969 with the Mets, 1982 with the Cardinals,
