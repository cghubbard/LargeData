John Lee Lowenstein (born January 27, 1947) is a former professional baseball 
player who played Major League Baseball primarily as an outfielder from 
1970 to 1985. He attended the University of California, Riverside, where 
he played college baseball for the Highlanders from 1966–1968.[1] Lowenstein 
was born in Wolf Point, Montana. He is known for being part of a platoon 
with Gary Roenicke for the Baltimore Orioles.[2][3] Lowenstein hit an extra 
inning walk-off home run for the Baltimore Orioles to win Game 1 of the 
1979 American League playoffs against the California Angels.[4][5] He also 
hit a home run for the Orioles in Game 2 of the 1983 World Series.[2] Although 
he never played in a major league game for them, Lowenstein was briefly 
a member of the expansion Toronto Blue Jays between the 1976 and 1977 seasons. 
He was traded by the Indians to the Blue Jays for designated hitter Rico 
Carty, and reacquired in the same off-season for utility infielder Héctor 
Torres. As a member of the Indians, he famously proclaimed himself President 
and General Manager of the John Lowenstein Apathy Club, since no Indians 
follower had ever started a John Lowenstein Fan Club during his tenure 
with the team. In 1980, after being hit in the back of the neck on the 
basepaths with a thrown ball, Lowenstein was taken off the field on a stretcher. 
As he reached the dugout, he abruptly sat up, and pumped his fists to the 
crowd.[6] Lowenstein was an announcer for Oriole television broadcasts 
on Home Team Sports for eleven seasons, working as an analyst with Mel 
Proctor. After he was told before the 1996 season that he would not be 
retained, Lowenstein speculated that the Orioles put pressure on Home Team 
Sports to remove him from the booth.[7] In 1986, Lowenstein served as a 
backup color commentator (behind Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek) on NBC's 
Game of the Week broadcasts alongside play-by-play man Ted Robinson. For 
example, Lowenstein and Robinson called the May 17 game between Kansas
