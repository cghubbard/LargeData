The 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC) was an international professional 
baseball competition, held from March 2, to March 19, 2013. This was the 
third iteration of the WBC, following the two previous tournaments, held 
in 2006 and 2009. Unlike the two previous WBCs, which consisted of the 
same sixteen countries, only the twelve countries that won at least one 
game in the 2009 WBC were guaranteed a berth in the main tournament.[1] 
The automatic qualifiers were Australia, China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, 
Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, South Korea, the United 
States, and Venezuela. Four qualification brackets were held in late 2012 
and respectively won by Canada, Taiwan, Spain, and Brazil, who joined the 
WBC as the final four teams (the latter two making their Classic debuts). 
As in the 2006 tournament, the first round had a round-robin format, which 
led to South Korea being eliminated on a run difference tiebreaker. Venezuela 
also failed to advance out of a tough group. The fourth-place teams in 
each group – Brazil, Australia, Spain, and Mexico – will have to participate 
in the qualifying round in order to return for the 2017 tournament. The 
second round was a modified double-elimination format, as in the 2009 tournament, 
where the modification was that the final game of each bracket was winner-take-all, 
even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket, although that 
game only affected seeding as two teams advanced from each bracket. The 
Netherlands improved on its surprising 2009 run by advancing to the semifinal 
game, as did two-time defending champion Japan. In the final game, the 
Dominican Republic defeated Puerto Rico to become the first WBC champion 
from the Western Hemisphere, as well as the first team to complete the 
WBC with an undefeated record. Robinson Canó was named the Most Valuable 
Player of the Classic.[2] The preparations for the third World Baseball 
Classic were complicated by a dispute between the Japanese Professional 
Baseball Players Association (JPBPA), the union for all Nippon Professional 
Baseball players, and MLB over revenue sharing. JPBPA demanded a larger 
share of advertising and merchandise sponsorship revenue for the tournament, 
a large chunk of which came from Japanese companies. MLB resisted the move 
in part due to the fact that the World Baseball Classic is a joint production 
of MLB and the MLB Player's Association, meaning that those two organizations 
bore the cost of the tournament. In July 2012 the JPBPA voted unanimously 
to boycott the 2013 World Baseball Classic.[3][4] The move was interpreted 
by some news outlets as a non-final decision, aimed at raising the pressure 
on MLB.[5][6] In September 2012, Japanese players agreed to take part after 
reaching a compromise with tournament organizers on sharing sponsorship 
and licensing revenue.[7] Although the 2006 and 2009 editions of the World 
Baseball Classic were contested by the same pre-selected field of 16 teams, 
for the 2013 tournament only the 12 teams that won at least one game in 
2009 were guaranteed a berth in the main tournament. The automatic qualifiers 
were Australia, China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Italy, Japan, Mexico, 
the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, South Korea, the United States, and Venezuela. 
The other four teams from the 2009 tournament (Canada, Taiwan, Panama, 
and South Africa) contested a qualifying round in late 2012, along with 
12 additional teams invited by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF).[8] 
The qualifying round was organized as four independent modified double-elimination 
tournaments.[1] The modification was that the final game was winner-take-all, 
even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket. Although this 
modified double-elimination format was used in some rounds of the 2009 
World Baseball Classic, in that tournament the final game was only for 
seeding and never for elimination. As practiced in the 2013 qualifiers, 
the team emerging from the winner's bracket might be eliminated from the 
tournament despite losing only one game (as, in fact, happened to Israel 
in Qualifier 1). The composition of the qualifying pools was determined 
based on geographical location, competitive balance, and regional rivalries.[8] 
In Qualifier 1, South Africa took on France, Israel, and Spain, with the 
games taking place in Jupiter, Florida, United States. In Qualifier 2, 
Canada took on the Czech Republic, Germany, and Great Britain, with the 
games taking place in Regensburg, Germany. In Qualifier 3, Panama took 
on Brazil, Colombia, and Nicaragua, with the games taking place in Panama 
City, Panama. In Qualifier 4, Taiwan took on New Zealand, the Philippines, 
and Thailand, with the games taking place in New Taipei City, Taiwan.[9] 
Canada and Taiwan dominated Qualifiers 2 and 4 (respectively) to advance 
easily. In Qualifier 1, South Africa was eliminated in the second round, 
and Spain narrowly defeated Israel to advance to the main tournament. In 
Qualifier 3, Brazil narrowly defeated Panama to earn the final berth in 
the main tournament. Under WBC rules, non-Israeli players of Jewish ancestry 
were eligible to play for Israel, and Major League All Stars first baseman 
Kevin Youkilis, second baseman Ian Kinsler, and outfielder Ryan Braun (whose 
father is Israeli)[10][11][12] expressed a desire to do so. However, Qualifier 
1 took place in September, during the MLB season, precluding the participation 
of those major league players as well as Jewish major leaguers catcher 
Ryan Lavarnway, first baseman Ike Davis, third baseman Danny Valencia, 
outfielders Sam Fuld and Ryan Kalish, and pitchers Jason Marquis, Scott 
Feldman, Craig Breslow, and John Grabow.[1][13][14][15][16][17] Without 
its Major Leaguers, Israel, coached by former major league All Star Brad 
Ausmus, was evenly matched with Spain. It narrowly failed to qualify for 
the main tournament despite 4 home runs in 12 at-bats from minor league 
first baseman Nate Freiman. Canada similarly was unable to utilize its 
Major League players, including Joey Votto and Justin Morneau, as Qualifier 
2 also took place in September. However, Canada easily qualified anyway. 
They were led by minor league first baseman Jimmy Van Ostrand (.538; 10 
RBIs in 13 at-bats). By contrast, all four teams in Qualifier 3 boasted 
Major League players, as it took place in November and did not conflict 
with the MLB season. Panama had five established Major Leaguers, and Nicaragua 
two.[18] However, Brazil won the qualifier despite playing only one Major 
Leaguer, rookie Yan Gomes. Although Qualifier 4 also took place in November, 
Taiwan did not play its available Major Leaguers, but easily qualified 
anyway. In the first round, each team played the other three teams in its 
pool once. Teams were ranked by winning percentage in the first round, 
with the top two teams in each pool advancing to the second round. There, 
the teams from Pools A and B (in Pool 1) and the teams from Pools C and 
D (in Pool 2) competed in a double-elimination format. The top two teams 
in each pool in the second round entered the four-team single-elimination 
semifinals. The four qualifying teams crossed over for the semifinals, 
with the winner of each pool playing against the runner-up from the other 
pool. In the final, the team with the higher winning percentage of games 
in the tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the 
final had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball 
Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the 
home team. In the first round, ties were to be broken in the following 
order of priority:[19] In the final standings, ties were to be broken in 
the following order of priority:[citation needed] These standings and tiebreaking 
procedures are based on International Baseball Federation (IBAF) rules.[citation

but teams had until February 20 to finalize their roster decisions. Many 
Major League Baseball (MLB) players participated. The United States provisional 
roster was made up entirely of players from MLB, and champions Dominican 
Republic provisional roster had only one player not signed to a MLB team 
in 2013. The Canadian team had 12 players who appeared in MLB in 2012. 
Japan had none and two prominent Japanese MLB players, Yu Darvish and Ichiro 
Suzuki, chose not to play. Though five members who competed for the Cuban 
national team in the 2009 WBC have since defected, the Cuban team was considered 
strong despite its 2nd-round sacking. Three members of MLB.com's Top 100 
prospect participated: Xander Bogaerts, Eddie Rosario, and Jameson Taillon. 
Eight stadiums were used during the main tournament: The top 12 teams that 
participated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic were invited back for the 
2013 tournament.[20] Spain, Canada, Brazil, and Chinese Taipei won their 
pools of qualification.[21] NOTE: Tiebreaker notes: HTH − Head-to-head.

number of pitches thrown in a game, though the limits themselves were changed 
from the previous tournament: If a pitcher reached his limit during an

from the game at the end of the at bat. A pitcher must: For purposes of 
the pitcher use limitation rules, both semifinal games were to be deemed 
to have been played on the day of the latest semifinal game. A mercy rule 
came into effect when one team led by either fifteen runs after five innings, 
or ten runs after seven innings in the first two rounds. Instant replay 
was also available to umpires during the tournament. As was introduced 
in Major League Baseball during the 2008 season, replays were only used 
to adjudicate on home run decisions, to determine whether the ball was 
fair or foul, over the fence or not, and the impact of fan interference. 
An alternative version of the IBAF's extra inning rule was also used. If 
after 12 innings the score was still tied, each half inning thereafter 
would have started with runners on second and first base. The runners would 
have been the eighth and ninth hitters due in that inning respectively. 
For example, if the number five hitter was due to lead off the inning, 
the number three hitter would have been on second base, and the number 
four hitter on first base. However, this rule was never actually employed 
in this year's Classic, as the only extra-inning game in the tournament 
ended prior to a 13th inning. US$14,000,000 MLB Network has been announced
