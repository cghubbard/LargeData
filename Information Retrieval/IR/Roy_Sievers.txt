Roy Edward Sievers (born November 18, 1926) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman/left 
fielder. From 1949 through 1965, Sievers played for the St. Louis Browns 
(1949–53), the original Washington Senators (1954–59), Chicago White Sox 
(1960–61), Philadelphia Phillies (1962–64), and finally the new Senators 
(1964–65). He batted and threw right-handed. Signed by the St. Louis Browns 
as a free agent in 1947, Sievers debuted in the major leagues on April 
21, 1949. Sievers won the American League Rookie of the Year and TSN Rookie 
of the Year awards in 1949, batting .306 with 16 home runs and 75 RBI. 
He struggled to .238 in 1950, and for the next three years he suffered 
shoulder and arm injuries that limited his playing time to 134 games. He 
was traded to the Washington Senators for Gil Coan before the 1954 season. 
In Washington, Sievers collected 95 or more RBI and played at least 144 
games during five consecutive years (1954–58) and made the AL All-Star 
team three times (1956–57, 1959). His most productive season came in 1957, 
when he led the league in home runs (42), RBI (114), extra base hits (70) 
and total bases (331), batting .301. He finished third in the MVP ballot 
with four first-place votes and 205 points –Mickey Mantle got six and 233, 
Ted Williams five and 209.[1] On April 4, 1960, Sievers went to the Chicago 
White Sox in the same trade that sent Earl Battey and Don Mincher to Washington.[2] 
In his first year with the Sox, he hit .295 with 28 homers and 93 RBI, 
and had almost an identical season in 1961 with .295, 27, 92, making his 
fourth All-Star appearance. From 1962-64, Sievers remained productive with 
the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League. In the 1964 midseason, 
his contract was sold to the AL expansion Senators, playing his final game 
on May 9, 1965. He is the oldest living member of the expansion Senators 
team. At a time when achieving 300 home runs was still a rarity, Sievers 
became only the 22nd ballplayer to reach the plateau. He also shares the 
dubious distinction with Gil Hodges of being one of the first two major 
leaguers to hit 300 career home runs and not make the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. Siever hit his 300th home run on July 19, 1963. Hodges hit No. 300 
on April 23, 1958. In a 17-season career, Sievers was a .267 hitter with 
318 home runs and 1147 RBI in 1887 games. After his playing career ended, 
he served one season (1966) as a coach for the Cincinnati Reds and managed 
in the minor leagues. Sievers currently resides in St. Louis, and attends 
the annual St. Louis Browns Alumni gathering each year. Sievers was one 
of only nine players to don the uniform of both the original and expansion 
Washington Senators teams, the others being Don Mincher, Camilo Pascual, 
Pedro Ramos, Johnny Schaive, Zoilo Versalles, Hal Woodeshick, Rudy Hernández,
