Guillermo Antonio Quiroz (Spanish pronunciation: [ɡiˈʝermo kiˈɾos]; born 
November 29, 1981) is a Venezuelan professional baseball catcher who is 
currently a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 
the Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, Baltimore Orioles, 
Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants. Quiróz was born in Maracaibo, 
Venezuela on November 29, 1981. He played Little League Baseball for Cocquivacoa, 
and was teammates with Yusmeiro Petit. In 1994, Cocquivacoa won Venezuela's 
first Little League World Series title.[1] Then aged 10, Quiróz started 
every game that season as a catcher.[2] Two year later, Quiróz won the 
Senior League World Series.[3] Quiróz was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays 
as a non-drafted free agent in 1998, before his 17th birthday, with a $1 
million signing bonus.[4] He progressed through Toronto's system as the 
team's number-one catching prospect. In addition, Baseball America rated 
him as the Blue Jays' third best prospect in their 2004 pre-season rankings, 
and the 35th best prospect in all of baseball.[5][6] Defensively, Quiróz 
has good skills. In 2003 he threw out 45% of base stealers, and was the 
starting catcher for the World Team in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game.[7] 
He missed the end of the 2003 season with a collapsed lung.[8] The broken 
hand and torn arm muscle he suffered in 2004 hurt his chances of taking 
over as the Blue Jays' starting catcher in 2005.[9] Greg Zaun and Greg 
Myers were re-signed to give Quiróz more time in the minors.[10] However, 
Quiróz was set further back that season, due to shoulder strain and another 
collapsed lung.[9] In 2006, the Blue Jays signed catcher Jason Phillips 
initially as the backup to Gregg Zaun. They later signed Bengie Molina 
to be their new starter. This placed three catchers ahead of Quiróz on 
the Blue Jays' depth chart.[11][12] On March 31, 2006, Quiróz was put on 
waivers by the Blue Jays, but was picked up by the Seattle Mariners on 
the same day.[13] Quiróz started the seventh game of the 2006 season for 
the Mariners, but was outrighted to Triple-A Tacoma Rainers eight days 
later.[14] Quiróz spent the rest of the season between Triple-A Tacoma 
and the Double-A San Antonio Missions. Quiróz was signed by the Texas Rangers 
on December 28, 2006.[15] He spent most of the 2007 season with the Triple-A 
Oklahoma RedHawks until a September call-up to the majors. At the end of 
the 2007 season, the Rangers outrighted Quiróz to the minors, but he refused 
the assignment and became a free agent.[16][17] On December 3, 2007, Quiróz 
signed a one-year major league contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[18] 
He spent the 2008 season as the backup to catcher Ramón Hernández.[19][20] 
He was invited to spring training and expected to compete for the backup 
catcher position at the start of the 2009 season,[21][22] but was released 
on March 21.[23] In April 2009 Quiróz signed a minor league deal with the 
Seattle Mariners.[24] On May 14, 2009, he was assigned to the Double-A 
West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx from the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers.[25] On May 
26, 2009, he was called up from West Tennessee to the Seattle Mariners.[26] 
On June 19, 2009, Quiróz was designated for assignment.[27] He refused 
an assignment to the Rainers at the end of the season and became a free 
agent on November 3, 2010.[28] On January 5, 2011, Quiróz signed a minor 
league deal with the San Diego Padres.[29] He was invited to spring training 
to be the backup to Nick Hundley,[30] but did not win the job and spent 
the season playing for the Tucson Padres. Quiróz signed a minor league 
contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 13, 2011.[31][32] He received 
an invitation to spring training, but did not play for the Mariners in 
2012. Instead he played for their Triple-A affiliate Tacoma Rainiers. On 
September 4, 2012, the Mariners traded Quiróz to the Boston Red Sox for 
cash considerations.[33][34] Quiróz was designated for assignment on October 
4.[35] According to the International League transactions page, Quiróz 
was outrighted to the Pawtucket Red Sox on October 10, but chose to become 
a free agent. He signed a minor league deal with an invite to spring training 
with the San Francisco Giants in November 2012.[36] On May 4, 2013 Quiróz 
hit his first career walk-off home run, a tenth inning, pinch-hit homer 
against former battery mate Brandon League of the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
leading the Giants to a 10-9 victory.[37] On November 15, 2013 Quiróz signed 
a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants.[38] In November 
2014 Quiróz was outrighted to Triple A.[39] He refused the assignment and 
became a free agent on November 3,[40] then subsequently re-signed a minor 
league contract with the San Francisco Giants.[41] On February 12, 2016, 
Quiróz signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians with an
