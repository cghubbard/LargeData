The Polo Grounds was the name of three stadiums in Upper Manhattan, New 
York City, used mainly for professional baseball and American football 
from 1880 until 1963. The third Polo Grounds, built in 1890 and renovated 
after a fire in 1911, is the one generally indicated when the Polo Grounds 
is referenced. It was located in Coogan's Hollow and was noted for its 
distinctive bathtub shape, very short distances to the left and right field 
walls, and an unusually deep center field. As the name suggests, the original 
Polo Grounds, opened in 1876 and demolished in 1889, was built for the 
sport of polo. Bounded on the south and north by 110th and 112th Streets 
and on the east and west by Fifth and Sixth (Lenox) Avenues, just north 
of Central Park, it was converted to a baseball stadium when leased by 
the New York Metropolitans in 1880. In baseball, the original Polo Grounds 
was home to the New York Metropolitans from 1880 until 1885, and the New 
York Giants from 1883 until 1888. The Giants played in the second Polo 
Grounds for part of the 1889 season and all of the 1890 season, and at 
the third and fourth Polo Grounds from 1891 through 1957. The Polo Grounds 
was also the home field of the New York Yankees from 1913 until 1922 and 
the New York Mets in their first two seasons of 1962 and 1963. It hosted 
the 1934 and 1942 Major League Baseball All-Star Games. In football, the 
third Polo Grounds was home to the New York Brickley Giants for one game 
in 1921 and the New York Giants from 1925 to 1955. The New York Jets of 
the American Football League played at the stadium from the league's inaugural 
season of 1960 through 1963. Other sporting events held at the Polo Grounds 
included soccer, boxing, and Gaelic football. The last sporting event at 
the Polo Grounds was a football game between the New York Jets and the 
Buffalo Bills on December 14, 1963. Shea Stadium opened in 1964 and replaced 
the Polo Grounds as the home of the Mets and Jets. The Polo Grounds was 
demolished over a period of four months that year and a public housing 
complex, known as the Polo Grounds Towers, was built on the site. The original 
Polo Grounds stood at 110th Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, 
directly across 110th Street from the northeast corner of Central Park. 
The venue's original purpose was for the sport of polo, and its name was 
initially merely descriptive, not a formal name, often rendered as "the 
polo grounds" in newspapers. The Metropolitans, an independent team of 
roughly major-league caliber, was the first professional baseball team 
to play there, beginning in September 1880, and remained the sole professional 
occupant through the 1882 season. At that time the Metropolitans' ownership 
had the opportunity to bring it into the National League, but elected instead 
to organize a new team, the New York Gothams—who soon came to be known 
as the Giants—mainly using players from the Metropolitans and the newly 
defunct Troy Trojans, and entered it in the National League, while bringing 
what remained of the Metropolitan club into the competing American Association. 
For this purpose the ownership built a second diamond and grandstand at 
the park, dividing it into eastern and western fields for use by the Giants 
and Metropolitans respectively. Polo Grounds I thus hosted its first Major 
League Baseball games in 1883 as the home stadium of two teams, the American 
Association Metropolitans and the National League Gothams.[1] The dual-fields 
arrangement proved unworkable because of faulty surfacing of the western 
field, and after various other arrangements were tried, the Metropolitans 
and Giants alternated play on the eastern field in later years until the 
Metropolitans moved to the St. George Cricket Grounds on Staten Island 
in 1886. An early highlight of Giants' play at the Polo Grounds was Roger 
Connor's home run over the right-field wall and into 112th Street; Connor 
eventually held the record for career home runs that Babe Ruth would break 
in 1920. The original Polo Grounds was used not only for polo and professional 
baseball, but often for college baseball and football as well—even by teams 
outside New York. The earliest known surviving image of the field is an 
engraving of a baseball game between Yale University and Princeton University 
on Decoration Day, May 30, 1882.[2] Yale and Harvard also played their 
traditional Thanksgiving Day game there on November 29, 1883 and November 
24, 1887.[3] (See Football below) New York City was in the process of extending 
its street grid into uptown Manhattan in 1889. Plans for an extended West 
111th Street ran through the grounds of the Polo Grounds. City workers 
are said[by whom?] to have shown up suddenly one day and begun cutting 
through the fence to lay out the new street. With the Giants having won 
the National League pennant the year before there was significant sentiment 
in the city against the move; a bill was even passed by the state legislature 
giving the Giants a variance which would allow the park to stand. Governor 
David B. Hill, who had campaigned for office on a "home rule" pledge, vetoed 
it on the grounds that whatever he might think of the forced destruction 
of the park, the will of the city government was to be respected. The loss 
of their park forced the Giants to look quickly for alternative grounds. 
The Giants opened the 1889 season at Oakland Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, 
playing their first two games there.[4][5] Four days later, they moved 
to the St. George Cricket Grounds (where the Metropolitans had continued 
to play until their demise in 1887).[6] After closing out a homestand at 
the St. George Grounds on June 14, the Giants went on the road. Upon their 
return on July 8 they had relocated again, to another site within Manhattan 
at the far terminus of the then Ninth Avenue Elevated at 155th Street and 
8th Avenue (now Frederick Douglass Boulevard).[7] Despite their vagabond 
existence in 1889, the Giants managed to win the pennant for the second 
consecutive year. The new site was overlooked to the north and west by 
a steep promontory known as Coogan's Bluff. Because of its elevation, fans 
frequently watched games from the Bluff without buying tickets.[8] The 
ballpark itself was in bottomland known as Coogan's Hollow. The grandstand 
had a conventional curve around the infield, but because of the shape of 
the property left the center field area actually closer than left center 
or right center. This was not much of an issue in the "dead ball era" of 
baseball. The land remained in the Coogan estate, and the Giants were renters 
for their entire time at the ballpark. The Brooklyn Dodgers played a pair 
of home series at this ballpark in late July and early August 1890.[9] 
After the National League version of the New York Giants moved into Polo 
Grounds III in 1891, Polo Grounds II was referred to as Manhattan Field, 
and was converted for other sports such as football and track-and-field. 
It still existed as a structure for nearly 20 more years. Babe Ruth's first 
home run as a Yankee, on May 1, 1920, was characterized by the New York 
Times reporter as a "sockdolager" (i.e. a decisive blow), and was described 
as traveling "over the right field grand stand into Manhattan Field."[10] 
Bill Jenkinson's modern research indicates the ball traveled about 500 
feet in total, after clearing the Polo Grounds double decked right field 
stand. Manhattan Field was a playground or vacant lot by then. Some years 
later, the area was paved over, to serve as a parking lot for the Polo 
Grounds. Polo Grounds III was the stadium that made the name famous. Built 
in 1890, it initially had a completely open outfield bounded by just the 
outer fence, but bleachers were gradually added. By the early 1900s, some 
bleacher sections encroached on the field from the foul lines about halfway 
along left and right field. Additionally, there was a pair of "cigar box" 
bleachers on either side of the "batter's eye" in center field. The expansive 
outfield was cut down somewhat by a rope fence behind which carriages (and 
early automobiles) were allowed to park. By 1910, bleachers enclosed the 
outfield, and the carriage ropes were gone. The hodge-podge approach to 
the bleacher construction formed a multi-faceted outfield area. There were 
a couple of gaps between some of the sections, and that would prove significant 
in 1911. Known as "Brotherhood Park" when it opened in 1890, Polo Grounds 
III was the home of a second New York Giants franchise in the Players' 
League. The latter was a creation of Major League Baseball's first union, 
the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players. After failing to win 
concessions from National League owners, the Brotherhood founded its own 
league in 1890. The Players' League Giants played in a new stadium called 
Brotherhood Park, located in the northern half of Coogan's Hollow, next 
door to the old Polo Grounds II, otherwise bounded by rail yards and the 
bluff. Brotherhood Park hosted its first game on April 19, 1890.[11] For 
one year the two editions of the Giants were neighbors, with the National 
League Giants still playing in Polo Grounds II. If the teams played on 
the same day, fans in the upper decks could watch each other's games, and 
home run balls hit in one park might land on the other team's playing field. 
After only one season the Players' League folded, and the Brotherhood's 
members went back to the National League. The National League Giants then 
moved out of Polo Grounds II and into Brotherhood Park, which was bigger. 
They took their stadium's name with them, turning Brotherhood Park into 
the Polo Grounds. They stayed there for 69 seasons.[12] On Friday, April 
14, 1911, a fire of unknown origin swept through the stadium's horseshoe-shaped 
grandstand, consuming wood and leaving only steel uprights in place. The 
gaps between some sections of the stands saved a good portion of the outfield 
seating and the clubhouse from destruction. Giants owner John T. Brush 
decided to rebuild the Polo Grounds with concrete and steel, renting Hilltop 
Park from the Yankees during reconstruction. Progress was sufficient to 
allow the stadium to reopen just three months later, June 28, 1911, the 
date some baseball guides date the structure. As configured, it was the 
ninth concrete-and-steel stadium in the Majors and fourth in the National 
League. Unfinished seating areas were rebuilt during the season while the 
games went on. The new structure stretched in roughly the same semicircle 
from the left field corner around home plate to the right field corner 
as prior but was extended into deep right-center field. The surviving wooden 
bleachers were retained basically as is, with gaps remaining on each side 
between the new fireproof construction. The Giants rose from the ashes 
along with their ballpark, winning the National League pennant in 1911 
(as they also would in 1912 and 1913). As evidenced from the World Series 
programs, the team renamed the new structure Brush Stadium in honor of 
their then-owner John T. Brush, but the name did not stick, and it died 
with him. The remaining old bleachers were demolished during the 1923 season 
when the permanent double-deck was extended around most of the rest of 
the field and new bleachers and clubhouse were constructed across center 
field. This construction gave the stadium its familiar bathtub style shape, 
as well as a new nickname, "The Bathtub". This version of the ballpark 
had its share of quirks. The "unofficial" distances (never marked on the 
wall) down the left and right field lines were 279 and 258 feet respectively, 
but there was a 21-foot overhang in left field, which often intercepted 
fly balls which would otherwise have been catchable and turned them into 
home runs. Contrasting with the short distances down the lines were the 
450 distances in deepest left and right center (the gaps), with the base 
of the straightaway centerfield clubhouse standing 483 feet distant from 
home plate, up a 58-foot fairway from the grandstand corners on either 
side of the clubhouse, which were themselves 425 feet from home plate. 
The famous photo of The catch made by Willie Mays in the 1954 World Series 
against Vic Wertz of the Cleveland Indians occurred immediately in front 
of the "batter's eye", a metal screen atop the grandstand wall directly 
to the right of the centerfield fairway. Consequently, the ball travelled 
less than 425 feet (probably about 410–415 feet), admittedly a prodigious 
smash, but far less than the legendary length many assume. It would have 
been a home run in several other ballparks of the time as well as in most 
of today's modern ballparks. The bullpens were actually in play, in the 
left and right center field gaps.[13] The outfield sloped downward from 
the infield, and people in the dugouts often could only see the top half 
of the outfielders. The New York Yankees sublet the Polo Grounds from the 
Giants during 1913–1922 after their lease on Hilltop Park expired. After 
the 1922 season, the Yankees built Yankee Stadium directly across the Harlem 
River from the Polo Grounds, which spurred the Giants to expand their park 
to reach a comparable seating capacity to stay competitive. However, since 
nearly all the new seating was in the outfield, Yankee Stadium still had 
more desirable seats than did the Polo Grounds for watching baseball. However, 
the Polo Grounds became better suited for football due to the new seating 
placement. The Giants' first night game at the stadium was played on May 
24, 1940. On July 4, 1950, Bernard Doyle, a 56-year-old New Yorker originally 
from Dublin, was accidentally shot and killed while in his seat at the 
Polo Grounds. Doyle had brought a friend's 13-year-old son with him to 
see the Brooklyn Dodgers play the Giants. He was killed by a stray bullet 
about an hour prior to the start of the game.[14] A 14-year-old boy later 
confessed to having shot a gun into the air from his rooftop at 515 Edgecombe 
Avenue, out of frustration with his view of the ballpark being obstructed 
by a parapet. On August 17, 1920, Indians shortstop Ray Chapman was hit 
in the head by a pitch thrown by the Yankees' Carl Mays. There were no 
batting helmets back then. Chapman died 12 hours after he was hit, at 4:30 a.m. 
He remains the only baseball player to die from a head injury in MLB.[15] 
The Polo Grounds' end was somewhat anticlimactic, especially compared to 
other "Jewel Box" parks. Part of the problem was that the stadium was not 
well maintained from the late 1940s onward; while the baseball Giants owned 
the stadium, they did not own the parcel on which it stood. Moreover, the 
neighborhood around the stadium had deteriorated by the early 1950s. All 
of this combined to severely suppress ticket sales, even when the Giants 
played well. In 1954, for example, the baseball Giants only drew 1.1 million 
fans (compared to over two million for the Milwaukee Braves) even as they 
won the World Series. The football Giants left for Yankee Stadium across 
the Harlem River following the 1955 NFL season, and the baseball Giants' 
disastrous 1956 season (most of which they spent in last place before a 
late-season surge moved them up to sixth) caused a further drag on ticket 
sales. The Giants' 1956 attendance was less than half of the figure for 
the Giants' World Series-winning 1954 season. This hit Giants owner Horace 
Stoneham particularly hard. He was not nearly as wealthy as his fellow 
owners; the Giants were his sole source of income. As such, the departure 
of the football Giants and the baseball Giants' increasingly meager ticket 
sales left him with little to no money for stadium upkeep. Frustrated with 
the obsolescence and increasing dilapidation of the Polo Grounds, Stoneham 
seriously considered having the Giants become tenants of the Yankees in 
the Bronx. He also considered moving to a proposed stadium that would have 
been owned by the city.[16] However, when both of those plans fizzled, 
the Giants announced on August 19, 1957, that they would move following 
that season, after nearly three-quarters of a century, to San Francisco, 
California, following the Dodgers to the West Coast. The Giants had won 
five World Series in the Polo Grounds. The ballpark then sat largely vacant 
for nearly three years, until the newly formed Titans of New York (present-day 
New York Jets) began play in 1960, followed by the newly formed Mets in 
1962, using the Polo Grounds as an interim home while Shea Stadium was 
being built. As a 1962 baseball magazine noted, "The Mets will have to 
play in the Polo Grounds, hardly the last word in 20th Century stadia." 
In 1961, the city of New York decided to claim the land under eminent domain, 
for the purpose of condemning the stadium and building a high-rise housing 
project on the site. The Coogan family, which still owned the property, 
fought this effort until it was finally settled in the city's favor in 
1967.[17] In the 1992 book The Gospel According to Casey, by Ira Berkow 
and Jim Kaplan, it is reported (p. 62) that in 1963, Mets manager Casey 
Stengel, who had bittersweet memories of his playing days at the Polo Grounds, 
had this to say during a rough outing to pitcher Tracy Stallard, whose 
greatest claim to fame had been giving up Roger Maris' 61st homer in 1961: 
"At the end of this season, they're gonna tear this joint down. The way 
you're pitchin', the right field section will be gone already!" The final 
iteration of the Polo Grounds was demolished in 1964, beginning in April 
with the same wrecking ball (painted to look like a baseball) that had 
been used four years earlier on Ebbets Field. The wrecking crew wore Giants 
jerseys and tipped their hard hats to the historic stadium as they began 
dismantlement. It took a crew of 60 workers more than four months to level 
the structure. The site is now home to the Polo Grounds Towers, a public 
housing project opened in 1968 and managed by the New York City Housing 
Authority. The various incarnations of the Polo Grounds were well-suited 
for football, and hundreds of football games were played there over the 
years. Yale University played football in the original 110th Street Polo 
Grounds in the 19th century, for some games which were expected to draw 
large crowds, including the Thanksgiving contests in 1883 and 1887.[3] 
(See also List of Harvard-Yale football games). The first professional 
football game played in New York City was played at the Polo Grounds on 
December 4, 1920. The game featured the Buffalo All-Americans against the 
Canton Bulldogs in the first year of the American Professional Football 
Association. The Buffalo All-Americans won the game, 7-3. Some argue that 
the Buffalo All-Americans are tied with the Akron Pros for the first championship 
of the American Professional Football Association, which soon came to be 
known as the National Football League. In 1921 the NFL's New York Brickley 
Giants played the final game of their 1921 season against the Cleveland 
Indians at the Polo Grounds. The game ended in a 17–0 Giants loss.[18] 
Shortly afterwards, the team folded. The Brickley Giants were originally 
formed with the intent of competing in 1919, and having all of their home 
games held at the Polo Grounds. However, after the team's first practice, 
the 1919 schedule, that began with an opening day game against the Massillon 
Tigers, was scratched because of conflict with New York's blue laws. In 
1919, the city allowed professional baseball on Sunday and the Giants thought 
the law would also apply to football. However, it was ruled that professional 
football was still outlawed on Sundays, so the team disbanded until 1921. 
Other than the name, there is no relation between the Brickley Giants and 
the modern New York Giants franchise.[19] Both the New York Giants of the 
National Football League and the New York Jets (then known as the New York 
Titans) of the American Football League used the Polo Grounds as their 
home field before moving on to other sites. The Giants moved initially 
to Yankee Stadium in 1956 while the Jets, founded in 1960, followed the 
New York Mets to Shea Stadium in 1964. The grounds were also used for many 
games by New York-area college football teams such as Fordham and Army. 
An upset victory by the visiting University of Notre Dame over Army in 
1924 led to Grantland Rice's famous article about the Irish backfield, 
which he called "The Four Horsemen". The field was also the site of several 
Army–Navy Games in the 1910s and 1920s. The football Giants hosted the 
1934, 1938, 1944, and 1946 NFL championship games at the Polo Grounds. 
In addition the Boston Redskins moved the 1936 game from Boston to the 
Polo Grounds, as part of their transition in relocating to Washington. 
The Polo Grounds held its fair share of international soccer matches as 
well over the years. In 1926, Hakoah, an all-Jewish side from Vienna, Austria, 
"drew the largest crowds ever to watch soccer in America up to that time: 
three successive games drew 25,000, 30,000, and 36,000 spectators. The 
highlight of the tour was a May 1, 1926 exhibition game between Hakoah 
and an American Soccer League all-New York team which drew 46,000 fans 
to the Polo Grounds in New York."[20] (The ASL team won 3–0.) The first 
soccer played at the Polo Grounds was as far back as 1894 when the owners 
of the various major baseball clubs thought it would be a great way to 
fill their stadiums in the off-season. Six famous baseball franchises of 
the era formed Association Football sections and fans were told that many 
would be fielding their baseball stars on the football field in the opening 
season. The New York Giants soccer team took the field in all-white uniforms 
with black socks and played six games before the threat of a rival baseball 
league being formed diverted the owner's attention away from their new 
venture and caused it to be suspended mid-season. The Giants lay third 
in the league after six games with two victories, having played their matches 
in midweek in front of attendances in the high hundreds paying 25 cents 
a game. Although the owners remained positive about the venture and wanted 
to run it again the following season this never happened and the Giants' 
soccer team was no more.[21][22] On May 19, 1935, the Scotland national 
team toured the United States, and in their first game played against an 
ASL All-Star squad which was unofficially representing the United States. 
Scotland won 5–1 in front of 25,000 people at the Polo Grounds. In 1939, 
the Scots returned to America for another tour, and played at the Polo 
Grounds twice. In their first game at the Polo Grounds on May 21, 1939, 
Scotland tied the Eastern USA All-Stars 1–1 in front of 25,072 fans. In 
their second game at the Polo Grounds on June 18, 1939, Scotland beat the 
American League Stars 4–2. Following World War II, on September 26, 1948, 
the USA beat Israel 3–1 in their first ever game since independence before 
25,000 fans at the Polo Grounds. On June 9, 1950, a crowd of 21,000 fans 
came to the Polo Grounds to watch an 'International Dream Double Header'. 
Beşiktaş J.K. of Turkey defeated the American Soccer League All-Stars 3–1, 
and then Manchester United defeated Jönköping (the top amateur team in 
Sweden) 4–0. On May 17, 1960, Birmingham City of England played Third Lanark 
of Scotland and lost 4–1 at the Polo Grounds in New York City. On August 
6 of the same year, 25,440 patrons showed up at the Polo Grounds to watch 
the inaugural International Soccer League Final which saw Bangu of Brazil 
edge out Kilmarnock FC of Scotland 2–0. Bangu's six games on Polo Ground 
had a total attendance of 104,274. The following year, 1961, may have been 
the last year documented that soccer was played at the Polo Grounds. The 
second edition of the International Soccer League held most of its game 
at the Polo Grounds, with a few games held in Montreal. On July 16, 1961 
Shamrock Rovers beat Red Star Belgrade 5–1, on August 9, Dukla Prague beat 
Everton 7–0, and four days later on August 13, Dukla Prague beat Everton 
again 2–0, thus winning the Dwight D. Eisenhower Trophy. The combined attendance 
for both games at the Polo Grounds was 31,627. In domestic league soccer, 
the Polo Grounds was the home to the New York Nationals of the American 
Soccer League in 1928. On September 14, 1947, the Polo Grounds hosted the 
final of the All-Ireland Senior Gaelic Football championship between Cavan 
and Kerry. It was decided that New York would host this match as a commemoration 
of the 1847 Irish famine which forced a large number of Irish people to 
emigrate to North America. This novel location for the game was chosen 
for the benefit of New York's large Irish immigrant population. It was 
the only time that the final has been played outside Ireland. The last 
Gaelic game at the Polo Grounds was on 1 June 1958 when Cavan played New 
York. The Polo Grounds was the site of many famous boxing matches. These 
included the legendary 1923 heavyweight championship bout between Jack 
Dempsey and Luis Firpo, Harry Greb's defense of the middleweight championship 
title against reigning World Welterweight Champion, Mickey Walker in July 
1925, and Billy Conn's near-upset over heavyweight champion Joe Louis in 
June 1941. It was also the venue for the rematch between World Heavyweight 
Champion Ingemar Johansson and former champion Floyd Patterson on June 
20, 1960. In what turned out to be the last major boxing match at the Polo 
Grounds, Patterson became the first heavyweight boxer to regain the championship 
over the Swedish-born Johansson, who almost one year to the day, took the 
crown from Patterson at Yankee Stadium. The Polo Grounds were the site 
of three different oval tracks. The first track, a ¼ mile dirt oval, was 
used for midget racing in 1940 and 1941. The second, a 1/5 mile board track, 
was used briefly in 1948. The final track, a ¼ mile paved oval, was used 
for stock car racing in 1958 and 1959, after the Giants moved to San Francisco.[23][24] 
A performance of Verdi's Requiem took place at the Polo Grounds on 4 June 
1916, presented by the National Open Air Festival Society. It was given 
by a chorus of 1,200 singers (chorus master, Arnaldo Conti), selected from 
among the leading choral societies of New York; and an augmented New York 
Philharmonic Orchestra of 120 players. The soloists were Lucile Lawrence, 
Maria Gay, Giovanni Zenatello and Leon Rothier, and the performance was 
conducted by Louis Koemmenich.[25][26][27] One of the oddest features at 
the Polo Grounds were the deep dimensions in straight away center field. 
The wall was so far away from home plate, at 483 feet (147 m), that few 
players ever hit home runs over it. Before its 1923 reconstruction, only 
Babe Ruth ever reached the centerfield stands; after 1923 only four players 
would reach the distant centerfield bleachers. The clubhouse was also located 
in that area, and was considered in play, as the windows were on the in-play 
side of the wall. The ground rules of the Polo Grounds were set up so that 
if a ball went through an open window in the clubhouse, it was a ground 
rule double, rather than a home run. Since no ball ever reached the clubhouse 
in the life of the stadium, that rule was never tested. In Game 1 of the 
1954 World Series, Giants outfielder Willie Mays made a sensational catch 
of a fly ball hit by the Cleveland Indians' Vic Wertz into deep center 
field, a catch which, in the words of NBC television sports announcer Jack 
Brickhouse, "must have looked like an optical illusion to a lot of people", 
and which turned the tide of that Series in the Giants' favor. On October 
2, 1936, in Game 2 of the 1936 World Series, Yankees centerfielder Joe 
DiMaggio made a similar, though far less crucial, catch (his team being 
ahead 18–4) for the final out of the game.[28][29] The Giants' Hank Leiber 
hit a long fly ball to deep center field that DiMaggio caught in the runway, 
perhaps 430–440 from the plate, and his momentum carried him partway up 
the clubhouse steps. He then stopped and turned around, as the crowd stood 
and acknowledged the departure of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was in attendance 
that day.[30] Babe Ruth hit many of his early signature blasts at the Polo 
Grounds, reaching the center field seats on several occasions. His longest 
blast at the grounds, over the right-center upper deck in 1921, was estimated 
at over 550 feet. Had Ruth played regularly in the remodeled Polo Grounds, 
he would have been capable of hitting the clubhouse if conditions were 
right.[speculation?] Neither he nor anyone else ever did, but a few came 
close. After the 1923 remodeling, only four players ever hit a home run 
into the center field stands:[31] The deep center field was complemented 
by the short right-field fence. Its foul pole was 258 feet (79 m) from 
home, one of the shortest ever used in the major leagues. Since the early 
20th century, home runs that just cleared a field's shortest fence had 
been known as "Chinese home runs", from a stereotype of Chinese immigrant 
workers as doing the bare minimum required for the low wages they received 
for menial labor. Within baseball, by the 1940s those home runs were largely 
associated with the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. The 511 
career homers hit by Giants outfielder Mel Ott, whose physique and batting 
technique were not those associated with power hitting, have often been 
downplayed because a significant number were hit to right at home, a criticism 
he often responded to by asking why few other hitters in the league were 
making that hit if it were so easy.[32] Bobby Thomson's "Shot Heard 'Round 
the World" that won the 1951 National League pennant for the Giants was 
hit over the left field fence. But arguably the best-remembered home run 
hit to that side was the walk-off three-run shot by Dusty Rhodes, batting 
for Monte Irvin in the 10th inning of Game 1 of the 1954 Series, after 
Mays' catch had kept the Giants tied. It just barely cleared the fence, 
leading Al López, manager of the heavily-favored Indians, to attribute 
the Giants' stunning victory in the Series opener to the ballpark's unusual 
dimensions.[33] The only part of the Polo Grounds that still remains is 
the "John T. Brush Stairway",[34] which runs down Coogan's Bluff from Edgecombe 
Avenue to Harlem River Drive at about 158th Street.[35] The stairway, named 
for John T. Brush—the then-recently deceased owner of the Giants—opened 
in 1913 and led to a ticket booth overlooking the stadium. The stairway 
reportedly offered a clear view of the stadium for fans who did not purchase 
tickets to a game. A marker on the stairway reads: "The John T. Brush Stairway 
Presented By The New York Giants."[35] In November 2011, it was reported 
that the stairway would undergo a $950,000 restoration, thanks to donations 
from the New York Giants, Jets, Yankees, Mets, San Francisco Giants, and 
Major League Baseball.[36][37] The restoration was scheduled to be completed 
in September 2012, but in February 2013 it was announced that a "soft opening" 
would take place in spring 2013.[36][38] After numerous delays, the restored 
steps opened finally in early August 2014.[39] The restored stairway is 
considered a city historic landmark.[40] The light poles from the Polo 
Grounds remain in use at Phoenix Municipal Stadium, a minor league facility 
in Phoenix, Arizona, built in 1964. When the stadium was built, Horace 
Stoneham, owner of the San Francisco Giants, had the original Polo Grounds 
light poles shipped there. The Giants held spring training at the stadium's 
predecessor since 1947 and played at the new ballpark during spring training 
1964. The poles were installed in the stadium where they currently remain 
standing.[41] Compiled from various photos, baseball annuals, The Official

in some of the posted distances, notably straightaway center, have not 
been fully reconciled by researchers. The closest object in straight center 
field was the Grant Memorial, followed by the post supporting the overhang 
of the clubhouse (above which the 483 or 475 signs were posted), and a 
roll-up door several feet behind the overhang at ground level. The roof 
of the protruding part of the clubhouse sloped back and met the vertical 
wall of the larger part of the clubhouse. The exact objects referred to 
by the numbers 475, 483, and 505 can be speculated but remain unconfirmed.
