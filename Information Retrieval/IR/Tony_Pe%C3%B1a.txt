Antonio Francisco Peña Padilla (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈtoni ˈpeɲa]; born 
June 4, 1957) is a Dominican former professional baseball player, manager 
and current coach.[1] He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for 
the Pirates, Cardinals, Red Sox, Indians, White Sox, and Astros.[1] Peña 
was the manager of the Kansas City Royals between 2002 and 2005. He is 
currently the first base coach for the New York Yankees. As a player, Peña 
was known for his defensive abilities as well as his unorthodox squat behind 
home plate.[2] Peña was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur 
free agent in 1975.[1] Originally an outfielder, he didn't start playing 
as a catcher until 1977 while playing in the minor leagues.[2] As a catcher, 
Peña adopted an unorthodox squat behind the plate when there were no runners 
on base, extending his left leg straight out while squatting on his right 
leg.[3] He did this in order to help his pitchers keep their pitches low 
in the strike zone. In 1979 while playing for the Buffalo Bisons, Peña 
hit for a .313 batting average along with 34 home runs and 97 runs batted 
in.[4] The following year with the Portland Beavers he posted a .323 batting 
average with a .367 on-base percentage before making his major league debut 
with the Pirates on September 1, 1980.[1][4] In 1981, Peña platooned alongside 
Steve Nicosia, hitting for an impressive .300 batting average in 66 games 
and finished in sixth place in the 1981 National League Rookie of the Year 
Award.[1][5][6] In 1982, he took over as the Pirates full-time catcher 
and had a .340 batting average on the first of July, helping him earn a 
spot as a reserve for the National League team in the 1982 All-Star Game.[7][8] 
He finished the year with a .296 batting average.[1] While he committed 
16 errors, he finished second among National League catchers in assists 
and third in putouts and caught stealing percentage.[9] Peña had one of 
his best seasons in 1983, posting career-highs with a .301 batting average 
and 15 home runs as the Pirates improved to finish in second place in the 
National League Eastern Division.[1] He led National League catchers with 
976 putouts and finished second to Gary Carter with a .992 fielding percentage, 
earning him his first Gold Glove Award.[10][11] Peña also finished 12th 
in voting for the 1983 National League Most Valuable Player Award.[12] 
After the 1983 season, the Pirates went into a period of decline, finishing 
in last place for three consecutive years between 1984 and 1986. Although 
his offensive statistics tapered off, Peña continued to be productive defensively 
during this period, leading National League catchers in assists, putouts 
and baserunners caught stealing in 1984 and, again leading the league in 
assists and baserunners caught stealing in 1985, winning two more Gold 
Glove Awards and two more All-Star selections in the process.[13][14] When 
Peña broke the 100 assists barrier in 1985, he joined Johnny Bench, Jim 
Sundberg and Gary Carter as the only catchers to have more than 100 assists 
in a season since the end of the Second World War.[15] In a 1986 poll of 
major league managers, Peña was selected as the best throwing catcher in 
the major leagues.[16] In November 1986, Peña led a team of major league 
All-Stars to victory over a team of Japanese All-Stars and, was chosen 
as the most valuable player of the American team.[17] Before the start 
of the following season, with Peña nearing the end of his contract, the 
Pirates made a decision to trade him rather than lose him through free 
agency.[18] On April 1, 1987, Peña was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals 
for Andy Van Slyke and Mike LaValliere.[19] Three games into his Cardinals' 
career, he suffered a broken left thumb in a game against his former team, 
the Pirates.[20] He missed more than a month and returned to post a career-low 
batting average of .214.[21] Nevertheless, the Cardinals won the National 
League Eastern Division crown with Peña rebounding to post a .381 batting 
average in the 1987 National League Championship Series as, the Cardinals 
defeated the San Francisco Giants.[22] In the 1987 World Series against 
the Minnesota Twins he produced 9 hits with 4 runs batted in as the Cardinals 
lost in a seven-game series.[22][23] In 1988, Peña recovered with a .263 
batting average along with 10 home runs and 51 runs batted in.[1] He also 
led National League catchers with a .994 fielding percentage and was second 
in putouts and third in assists.[24] In 1989 he earned his fifth All-Star 
selection and, once again led the league's catchers with a .997 fielding 
percentage, committing only 2 errors in 134 games.[25] In November 1989, 
Peña was granted free agency and signed a contract to play for the Boston 
Red Sox.[1] With the Red Sox in 1990, he led American League catchers in 
games played, range factor, putouts and finished second in assists and 
in fielding percentage.[26] His performance earned him the Gold Glove Award, 
making him only the second catcher after Bob Boone to earn a Gold Glove 
in both the American and National Leagues.[27] The Red Sox won the American 
League Eastern Division pennant before eventually losing to the Oakland 
Athletics in the 1990 American League Championship Series.[28] In October 
1993, Peña again filed for free agency and signed to play for the Cleveland 
Indians.[1] Although his batting statistics weren't as strong as his earlier 
career, Peña was still valued for his strong defensive skills as a catcher.[29] 
He proved invaluable for the Indians in 1994 as a substitute for the injury-prone 
starting catcher, Sandy Alomar, Jr., while posting a .296 batting average 
with a .341 on-base percentage.[29] He caught the majority of the Indians' 
games in 1995 as they made it all the way to the 1995 World Series before 
losing to the Atlanta Braves.[30] Peña's batting average dropped to .195 
in 1995 and, he once again filed for free agency at the end of the season, 
signing a contract with the Chicago White Sox.[1] He played with the White 
Sox until August 1997 when he was traded to the Houston Astros. At the 
end of the year, he retired as a player at the age of 40.[1] In an eighteen-year 
major league career, Peña played in 1,988 games, accumulating 1,687 hits 
in 6,489 at bats for a .260 career batting average along with 107 home 
runs, 708 runs batted in and a .309 on-base percentage.[1] He ended his 
career with a .991 fielding percentage.[1] He led his league five times 
in putouts and twice in fielding percentage, assists, range factor and 
in baserunners caught stealing.[1] A five-time All-Star, he won four Gold 
Glove Awards during his career. Peña's 1,950 games played as a catcher 
rank him sixth on the all-time list.[31] His 156 career double plays ranks 
fifth all-time among major league catchers.[32] In 2011, Peña was inducted 
into the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons Hall of Fame along with Cleveland Indians 
broadcaster Jim Rosenhaus.[33] In 1999, Peña became the manager of the 
New Orleans Zephyrs and in 2001 he led them to a first-place finish in 
the East Division of the Pacific Coast League.[34][35] He also led Águilas 
Cibaeñas of the Dominican Winter Baseball League to two domestic championships 
in 1998 and 2000, and also led them to the 2001 Caribbean Series title. 
Peña was hired by the Kansas City Royals in 2002 to replace Tony Muser 
(John Mizerock had served as interim manager).[36] Peña led the 2003 Royals 
to a seven-game lead in the American League Central Division by mid-season 
before settling into a third-place finish in with a record of 83–79. It 
was the Royals' first season with a winning record since the strike-shortened 
1994 season. Peña was rewarded with the 2003 American League Manager of 
the Year Award.[37] Peña's Royals were less successful in 2004, finishing 
in last place in the Central Division of the American League with 104 losses. 
He resigned as manager of the Royals after a loss to the Toronto Blue Jays 
on May 10, 2005, as the Royals had the worst record in the American League 
at 8–25.[38] He was replaced by interim manager Bob Schaefer. On November 
3, 2005, Peña was named first base coach of the New York Yankees.[39] On 
October 21, 2007, the Yankees announced that Peña would interview to replace 
Joe Torre as manager.[40] However, the Yankees chose to hire former catcher 
Joe Girardi to manage the team instead.[41] Peña remained as the Yankees 
first base coach in 2008, before shifting to the role he played as bench 
coach from 2009 – 2014. He assumed the role of Yankees first base coach 
once more when they hired Joe Espada as the third base coach for the 2015 
season and shifted former Yankees third base coach Rob Thomson to the role 
of current Yankees bench coach.[42] Peña was considered a candidate to 
replace Terry Francona as the manager of the Red Sox in 2011 before the 
job went to Bobby Valentine.[43] In 2012, Valentine was fired as Red Sox 
manager after just one year, and Peña was interviewed to be the Red Sox 
manager.[44] In 2013, Peña was named the manager of the Dominican Republic 
National Baseball Team for the World Baseball Classic. Armed with a roster 
that included Jose Reyes, Robinson Canó, Nelson Cruz, Edwin Encarnación, 
Fernando Rodney, and many others, the Dominican team stormed through the 
WBC with an 8-0 record, culminating in a championship with a 3-0 victory 
over Puerto Rico. They were the first team in WBC history to go undefeated 
throughout the tournament.[45] Peña is married to Amaris and they have 
three children. He is the father of pitcher Tony Francisco Peña (mistakenly 
known as "Tony, Jr. or just as TJ"), as well as Francisco Peña, a catcher 
for the Baltimore Orioles organization. Francisco was recently recalled 
from Triple A Norfolk to serve as No. 2 catcher for the Orioles behind 
Matt Wieters. He debuted for the Orioles and hit his first major league 
home run on June 2, 2016 contributing to a huge 12 to 7 win over the Boston 
Red Sox. [46] Peña's daughter, Jennifer Amaris, won Miss RD USA 2007 and 
represented the Dominican Community in the USA in Miss Dominican Republic 
2008 and came in sixth place.[47] His brother, Ramón Peña, pitched with
