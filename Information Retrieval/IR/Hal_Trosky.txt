Harold Arthur Trosky, Sr., born Harold Arthur Trojovsky (November 11, 1912 
– June 18, 1979), was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball 
for the Cleveland Indians (1933–1941) and the Chicago White Sox (1944, 
1946). Trosky was born in Norway, Iowa. He batted left-handed and threw 
right-handed. His son, Hal Trosky, Jr., pitched briefly (3 innings) with 
the White Sox in 1958. Trosky had a career .302 batting average, with a 
high of .343 in 1936. He hit 228 career home runs and had 1012 RBIs. He 
had 1561 career hits. His 216 HRs with the Indians ranks him fifth on the 
team's all-time list, behind Earl Averill, Manny Ramirez, Albert Belle, 
and Jim Thome.[1] His best numbers came in his third full year in the major 
leagues, 1936, when he had 42 home runs, 162 RBIs, and a .644 slugging 
percentage. Despite being hailed as the next Babe Ruth, being one of only 
other rookies to tally a combined 200 home runs and RBI, he is widely considered 
one of the best players to never make an All-Star team.The reason for this 
omission was the ill-fortune of being an American League first baseman 
at the same time as Hall of Fame first basemen Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx 
and Hank Greenberg. Starting in 1938, Trosky started experiencing near 
constant migraine headaches, which began to affect his vision. After nearly 
being hit by a pitch, he announced on July 12, 1941, to Indians manager 
Roger Peckinpaugh and reporters, "a fellow can't go on like this forever. 
If I can't find some relief, I'll simply have to give up and spend the 
rest of my days on my farm in Iowa." [2] Peckinpaugh replaced Trosky with
