Jason Raymond Bay (born September 20, 1978) is a Canadian-American former 
professional baseball left fielder. Bay played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, New 
York Mets and Seattle Mariners. Bay was the National League Rookie of the 
Year in 2004 and he won the Silver Slugger Award in 2009. He is a three-time 
MLB All-Star and a three-time Tip O'Neill Award winner as the best Canadian 
baseball player. In youth baseball, Bay's Trail little league team reached 
the 1990 Little League World Series. Bay attended North Idaho College in 
Coeur d'Alene and Gonzaga University in Spokane, where he played college 
baseball from 1996–99.[1] In 1999, he played for the Chatham Athletics 
in the Cape Cod Baseball League. Bay was drafted by the Montreal Expos 
in the 22nd round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft and was assigned 
to the Expos' Short-Season A team in Burlington, Vermont, the Vermont Expos. 
In 2001, Bay was assigned to the Expos’ High Single-A team in Jupiter. 
He began the year slowly, and in May he was moved to Clinton of the Midwest 
League. Bay reached base in his first 26 games, then went on to bat .362 
and win the league batting title. In all, he batted .315 with 14 home runs 
and 75 runs batted in on the year. The Expos traded Bay to the New York 
Mets on March 24, 2002 with Jim Serrano for Lou Collier. The Mets traded 
Bay to the San Diego Padres with Josh Reynolds and Bobby Jones for Jason 
Middlebrook at the 2002 trading deadline. Bay debuted with the Padres on 
May 23, 2003, getting his first major league hit, a home run, in the ninth 
inning. Two days later, he suffered a broken right wrist after being hit 
by a pitch. On August 26, 2003, Bay was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
along with Óliver Pérez and Cory Stewart in exchange for Brian Giles. He 
finished the season with a .287 batting average, four home runs, and 14 
RBI in 30 games. Bay began the 2004 season on the disabled list due to 
surgery during the offseason, and did not rejoin the team until May. Despite 
missing the beginning of the season, he still produced the best offensive 
numbers of any National League rookie. He batted .282 in 120 games, leading 
all major league rookies in home runs (26) and RBIs (82). He also led all 
NL rookies in slugging percentage (.550), extra base hits (54) and total 
bases (226). With his 26 home runs, Bay broke a Pirates rookies record 
of 23 set by Johnny Rizzo in 1936 and matched by Ralph Kiner in 1946. Selected 
as the 2004 NL Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News, Bay was the second 
Pittsburgh Pirates player honoured with the award, after second baseman 
Johnny Ray in 1982. Bay was also the first Canadian player to win the award.[2] 
In 2005, Bay was selected to his first All-Star Game as a reserve outfielder. 
He was the only player on either roster not to appear in the game. Bay 
also appeared in the 2005 Century 21 Home Run Derby, representing Canada 
in the nationality-themed contest; he was eliminated in the first round 
after hitting no home runs. Bay finished the season with a .306 average, 
32 home runs, and 101 RBI, leading the Pirates in every major hitting category. 
After the 2005 season, Bay signed a four-year contract extension worth 
a guaranteed $18.25 million.[3] Bay batted .321 with 12 home runs (a Pirate 
record for home runs in a month) and 35 RBIs in May 2006. From May 22 to 
May 28, he hit home runs in six consecutive games, two short of the major 
league record held by Dale Long, Don Mattingly, and Ken Griffey, Jr. He 
had actually hit 10 home runs in ten games, but he had failed to hit a 
home run in one of the games, and hit two the next day. Following an aggressive 
public relations campaign by the Pirates in 2006, Bay led all National 
League outfielders in All-Star voting. Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder 
even urged fans to vote for Bay during a summer concert at Pittsburgh's 
Mellon Arena.[4] Bay became the first member of the Pittsburgh Pirates 
voted into the All-Star game as a starter since Andy Van Slyke. In the 
game, Bay went 1 for 3, with a single. After battling injuries, Bay's 2007 
season was less productive. Despite having a strong first couple of months, 
he batted .247 with 21 home runs and 84 RBIs.[5] Bay had a much more productive 
2008 with Pittsburgh, batting .282 with 22 home runs and 64 runs batted 
in through the All-Star break. In a May series against the Chicago Cubs, 
Bay had extra-inning walk-off hits in back-to-back games; the first two 
walk-off hits of his career.[6] A month later, he got his third walk-off 
hit of the season and his career with a 13th-inning solo home run against 
the Tampa Bay Rays.[7] On July 31, 2008, Bay and a player to be named later 
(Josh Wilson)[8] were traded to the Boston Red Sox in a three team deal 
that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Andy LaRoche with 
Bryan Morris to the Pittsburgh Pirates from the Dodgers and Brandon Moss 
with Craig Hansen to the Pirates from the Red Sox.[9] In his Red Sox debut, 
Bay scored both runs, the second coming after he hit a triple in bottom 
of the 12th inning and scored the game-winning run on a Jed Lowrie RBI 
infield single. Bay hit his first home run with Boston the next night against 
the Oakland Athletics. In one game, he hit multiple home runs against the 
Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park. He would end the 2008 season with Boston 
batting .293 with 9 home runs and 37 RBIs. The Red Sox' 2008 American League 
Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was the first 
playoff series of Bay's career. Bay hit a home run in each of the first 
two games of the series. Bay finished the series batting 7 for 17 (.412), 
with 2 doubles, 2 home runs, and 5 RBIs. In the 2008 American League Championship 
Series, he scored the first run in game one. In game two, he opened the 
door for the Red Sox with a two-run double and a home run in the fifth 
inning. However, the Red Sox lost in seven games. In 2009, after a strong 
first half that included an All-Star selection, Bay went on to lead the 
Red Sox with a career-high 36 home runs and 119 RBIs during the regular 
season. Early in the season, he also had a streak of 11 home runs with 
men on base, tying the team record and falling one shy of the major league 
record. In 2009, he was named #41 on the Sporting News' list of the 50 
greatest current players in baseball.[10] He filed for free agency after 
the season, turning down the Red Sox's offer of salary arbitration.[11] 
On December 29, 2009, Bay agreed to a four-year, $66 million contract with 
the New York Mets, which also included a vesting option for a fifth year.[12][13] 
General manager Omar Minaya, who engineered the deal, originally traded 
Bay to the Mets in 2002 when he was GM for the Montreal Expos. On January 
5, 2010, Minaya and Jeff Wilpon held a press conference at Citi Field in 
which Jason Bay was presented with his uniform, number 44 for the Mets. 
The Red Sox received the 39th (Anthony Ranaudo) and 57th (Brandon Workman) 
selections in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft as compensation.[14] 
On April 27, in the first game of a double header against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Bay hit his first home run as a member of the New York Mets in 
the bottom of the fourth inning to give the Mets a 2–0 lead. The Mets went 
on to win the first game, 4–0, and win the second game, 10–5. In his first 
season with the Mets, Bay played in only 95 games. He suffered a concussion 
in a game against the Dodgers, when he ran into a fenced wall and his head 
jerked back. He finished his season with a .259 batting average, only six 
home runs (he hit 36 the year before), 47 RBIs, and scored 48 runs. Bay 
began 2011 on the disabled list with a rib injury[15] and returned to the 
Mets on April 21 in a game against the Houston Astros. On that day (a 9–1 
Mets win), Bay batted and scored in the 8th on a rare four-base error when 
Hunter Pence failed to catch Bay's fly ball; David Wright, on first base 
from a walk, scored ahead of him. Bay also had a ground-rule double and 
scored a run in the 4th inning.[16][17] On June 28, 2011, Bay hit a grand 
slam off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Daniel Schlereth. It was the first grand 
slam by the Mets since Ángel Pagán hit one on August 1, 2009.[18] On August 
8, Bay hit his 200th career home run against the San Diego Padres, becoming 
the third Canadian MLB player after Larry Walker and Matt Stairs to reach 
this milestone.[19] Bay hit another grand slam in September en route to 
winning his fifth career National League Player of the Week Award.[20] 
Bay got off to a slow start to the 2012 season, finishing spring training 
with no home runs or RBI, and his regular season, which was derailed further 
by a broken rib[21] suffered while making a diving catch in the April 23 
game against the San Francisco Giants. When Bay returned from the DL on 
June 8, 2012 against the New York Yankees, he went 0-for-3 with one strikeout. 
He continued to go 0-for-16 in his return from the DL through June 12, 
before hitting a single on June 13 against the Tampa Bay Rays.[22] In a 
home game against the Cincinnati Reds on June 15, Bay left the game in 
the second inning after crashing into the left field wall and suffering 
a concussion while attempting to catch a fly ball by Jay Bruce that became 
an inside-the-park home run. He was subsequently placed on the DL again, 
and returned again on July 17 against the Washington Nationals. On September 
2, Bay hit a grand slam off of Miami Marlins pitcher Mark Buehrle in the 
first inning of a 5–2 Mets win. Bay also hit a home run off of Buehrle 
on September 22 in a 4–3 Mets win. Bay finished the 2012 season with a 
.165 batting average, 8 home runs and 20 RBI. On November 7, 2012, the 
Mets and Bay agreed to terminate their contract a year early and make the 
outfielder an unrestricted free agent.[23] On December 8, 2012, the Seattle 
Mariners signed Jason Bay to a one-year $1 million deal.[24] Bay appeared 
in 68 games with the Mariners and batted .204 with 11 home runs and 20 
RBI before being designated for assignment on July 29, 2013.[25] Bay was 
released on August 6.[26] On March 31, 2014, Bay officially announced his 
retirement from professional baseball.[27] Bay and his wife, Kristen, have 
two daughters, Addison, who was born on November 19, 2006, in Pittsburgh, 
and Evelyn, who was born on September 16, 2008, in Boston, and a son, Garrett, 
who was born on May 3, 2011 in New York City.[28] Bay's sister, Lauren 
Bay Regula, is a professional softball player who pitched for Canada in 
the 2004 Olympics, and was on the 2008 Olympic team as well. Bay remains 
friends with Anaheim Ducks centre Shawn Horcoff, who was also born in Trail. 
He is close friends with Grady Sizemore, who was a groomsman at Bay's wedding. 
In Bay's opening interview with the Boston media, he stated that his father 
was a die-hard Red Sox fan who had bought him a Red Sox onesie to wear 
when he was young. Bay believed it was still in his parents' basement along 
with his two childhood TV room posters of Red Sox greats Jim Rice and Carl 
Yastrzemski.[29] On Thursday, July 2, 2009, Bay became a US citizen after
