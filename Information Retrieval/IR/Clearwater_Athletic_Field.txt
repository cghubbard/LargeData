stadium in Clearwater, Florida. It was first used by professional baseball 
teams for spring training in 1923. The grandstand sat approximately 2,000 
and bleachers increased capacity to close to 3,000. Home plate was located 
on Pennsylvania Avenue, which ran south to north along the third base line, 
near Seminole Street. Left field ran parallel to Palmetto Street, and right 
field ran parallel to Greenwood Ave. The grandstand was destroyed by fire 
in April 1956.[1] The North Greenwood Recreation and Aquatic Complex now 
stands on the site of ballpark. In October 1922, the Brooklyn Dodgers agreed 
to train in Clearwater in 1923 provided the city would clear a field and 
construct grandstands. The Clearwater city council voted to issue $25,000 
in bonds for the purpose of construction. The Dodgers' move to Florida 
brought the number of major league clubs conducting spring training in 
the state to seven.[2] The first game was played on March 15, 1923 between 
the Dodgers, and the Boston Braves who trained in St. Petersburg. The game 
was preceded by a parade to the park and Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain 
Landis threw out the first pitch to Clearwater mayor Frank J. Booth.[3] 
More than 4,000 fans saw the Dodgers defeat the Braves 12-7.[4] It was 
the spring training home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Newark Bears (when the 
top minor league baseball teams held their own spring training), Cleveland, 
and the Philadelphia Phillies. The Florida State League's Clearwater Pelicans[5] 
and the Amateur Softball Association national-champion Clearwater Bombers 
played their home games at Athletic Field.[6] The Florida State Negro Baseball 
League Clearwater Black Sox played at the park in 1952.[7] Fire destroyed 
the grandstand in 1956 but the field remained in use. The Baltimore Orioles 
team in the Winter Instructional League trained at Athletic Field in October 
1959 and played their home games next door at Jack Russell Stadium.[8] 
The ballpark is often identified as "Clearwater Athletic Field" or "Clearwater's 
Athletic Field". It was renamed Ray Green Field in honor of Ray Green, 
mayor of Clearwater from 1935 to 1938,[9] who was instrumental in upgrading 
the facility during his tenure as mayor.[10] In a 1980 interview, Eddie 
Moore, director of Clearwater parks and recreation from 1938 to 1978, recalled 
that the ballpark was called "Brooklyn Field" during the Dodgers' tenure.[11] 
Indeed, a 1939 news article recounts the Clearwater Senior Softball League 
playing at "Brooklyn field".[12] One of the largest crowds for a spring 
training game was on March 24, 1951, when the Phillies drew 3,851 for a 
game against the Boston Red Sox.[13] It was replaced in 1955 by Jack Russell 
Stadium, into which both the Phillies and Bombers moved after the 1954 
season. Even after moving into Jack Russell in 1955, the Phillies continued 
to practice at the field.[14] At the time of the fire which destroyed the 
grandstands on April 12, 1956, it was reported that city managers planned 
to tear down the grandstands in 1957 and replace them with temporary bleachers.[15] 
The North Greenwood Recreation and Aquatic Complex now stands on the site 
of ballpark. In 2003, the city opened the Ray E. Green Aquatic Center, 
named in honor of the mayor.[16] Ray Green Field was also used for parking
