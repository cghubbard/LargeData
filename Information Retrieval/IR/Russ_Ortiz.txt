Russell Reid Ortiz (born June 5, 1974) is a retired Major League baseball 
pitcher. Ortiz played for the Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Baltimore 
Orioles, San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers. 
He is 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) tall, and weighs 220 pounds. Ortiz attended Montclair 
School in Van Nuys, California before he continued on to the University 
of Oklahoma. In 1994, he pitched for a Sooners squad that would win the 
College World Series. In 38 innings, he had three saves and 30 strikeouts. 
The right-hander was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 4th round 
of the June 1995 Major League Baseball draft. He was drafted as a closer, 
but converted to the starting rotation while in the Giants' farm system. 
On April 2, 1998, Ortiz made his major league debut in relief, collecting 
four strikeouts over two innings. The rookie bounced all over the Giants 
pitching staff and between San Francisco and Triple-A Fresno, working in 
relief, out of the rotation and in the minors as injuries and inconsistency 
plagued the Giants rotation. In 1999, Ortiz came into his own and held 
on to his spot in the Giants' rotation, jumping on the scene as one of 
the National League's premier starters. His 18 wins was good for a tie 
of 4th in the NL and was in the top 10 in the senior circuit in many other 
pitching statistics. 2000 was a tale of two seasons for Ortiz, as he was 
rocked hard before the All-Star break to a tune of 3 wins, 8 losses and 
7.55 ERA falling out of favor with manager Dusty Baker. He allowed 10 runs 
in a game versus the Milwaukee Brewers on May 21, 2000. Despite the ten 
runs, Ortiz won the game as the Giants outslugged Milwaukee 16–10, making 
Ortiz the first pitcher since Bob Friend in 1954 to allow 10 or more runs 
and still earn a win. Injuries in the second half of the season gave Ortiz 
the opportunity to redeem himself, and the California native shined. His 
10–4 record and 3.22 ERA after the mid-summer classic helped San Francisco 
into the National League playoffs, and Ortiz started Game 3 of 2000 NLDS 
versus the New York Mets. Ortiz returned to form in 2001 owning a 17–9 
record a solid 3.29 ERA, anchoring the pitching staff, for a competitive 
Giants squad. He also set career highs in innings (218.2 innings) and strikeouts 
(169). 2002 would prove to be another good effort on Ortiz's part as he 
and the Giants came within one game of a world championship. Yet again, 
Ortiz had another stellar second half effort helping the Giants capture 
the 2002 NL Wild Card. His personal six-game winning streak down the stretch 
propelled San Francisco into the playoffs and Ortiz captured two more victories 
(with a 2.19 ERA) over Atlanta in the Division Series. He was not as successful 
however in the NLCS versus St. Louis surrendering four runs in 4.2 innings 
in Game 3 of that series. The World Series versus the Angels also featured 
two polar opposite games for the starter. The Halos shelled him for 7 runs 
in Game 2 of the World Series, as the Giants went on to lose 11–10. He 
returned to pitch the pivotal Game 6, and again redeemed himself working 
6.1 innings of two-hit baseball. Manager Dusty Baker gave him the game 
ball when he took him out, assuming they would hold on to a 5–0 lead. The 
Angels came back to win the game by a final score of 6–5, and went on to 
win the World Series in 7 games. Ortiz landed on the trading block in the 
2002 offseason and was dealt to Atlanta for pitchers Damian Moss and Merkin 
Valdéz on December 17, 2002.[1] United with pitching guru Leo Mazzone, 
Ortiz put together a spectacular season, going 21–7 with a 3.81 ERA and 
collecting his only All-Star nod. With Ortiz as staff ace, the Braves won 
their 12th consecutive NL East title, and Ortiz took fourth place in the 
NL Cy Young voting. In a demonstration of how far the pitcher had come, 
Ortiz pitched a 1–0 complete game shutout and knocked in the game's only 
run against the eventual world champion Florida Marlins. Ortiz lost Game 
1 of the 2003 NLDS against Chicago however, but once again bounced back 
to win Game 4 and force a deciding Game 5 that Atlanta would lose. Ortiz 
displayed more pitching prowess in 2004 helping Atlanta to another division 
title while collecting a 15–9 record, with a slightly inflated 4.19 ERA. 
Another stellar late season game came in Montréal on September 4, as Ortiz 
carried a perfect game into the 6th inning and allowed only two Expos to 
reach second base in the complete game 9–0 shutout. That improved Ortiz 
to 5–0 with 1.13 ERA against the Expos in 2004. Still, Ortiz and the Braves 
could not advance past the first round of the playoffs as he was clobbered 
by Houston for 5 runs in 3 innings as the Astros advanced. Ortiz was on 
the move again in 2005, this time to Arizona as the Diamondbacks tried 
to overhaul their starting rotation and line-up after a 111 loss season 
the year before. Arizona's hefty four-year, $33 million deal lured the 
righty to the desert.[2] The pitcher who had never spent as much as a day 
on the disabled list in the previous seven seasons, battled a rib fracture 
after winning four of his first six games for the D-Backs. When he returned 
from the disabled list, Ortiz proceeded to lose six straight decisions 
and ended the year on a 1–9 slide. 2006 saw another injury (this time to 
his calf) and more poor pitching performances. On June 13, 2006, Ortiz 
was designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks as he sunk to 0–5 with 
an ERA of 7.54. The five losses contributed to 1–14 mark from May 2005 
to May 2006, and the Diamondbacks simply could not afford to allow Ortiz 
to work out his issues at the major league level.[3] With nearly $22 million 
and over two-and-a-half years remaining on the contract, Arizona's cut 
of Ortiz is thought to be the most expensive release in Major League Baseball 
history.[4] On June 25, 2006, the Orioles signed Ortiz to a one-year deal.[5] 
His first start for Baltimore and in the American League ended in a no 
decision on July 1 against one of his former clubs, the Atlanta Braves; 
but by the time the season ended, Ortiz had compiled a record of 0–8 with 
an ERA of 8.14. To his credit up to this point, in 251 career games (241 
starts) and 1,483.2 IP, Ortiz had 108 career wins to 76 losses, and an 
overall ERA of 4.28. He also had 1,072 career strikeouts to 773 walks. 
Ortiz had been a decent batter (for a pitcher) with a .208 lifetime batting 
average and 96 hits in 462 at-bats. He also had 22 career doubles, 6 career 
home runs and 44 total RBI. The pitcher also had a solid glove, committing 
only four errors in over 1,400 innings of work. Ortiz was picked up by 
the Giants on January 9, 2007, and signed to a one-year contract for $380,000 
to compete in spring training for the fifth starting position in the Giants' 
rotation. San Francisco general manager Brian Sabean noted that Ortiz while 
pitching winter ball in Puerto Rico showed both increased velocity and 
renewed movement in his pitches and was signed on that basis. Ortiz won 
the fifth starter spot with an excellent spring training, posting a 3.00 
ERA – over five points lower than his regular season ERA the previous year 
– in 18 innings pitched. In his second regular start, he posted his first 
win since 2005, and in his third start, he won again, this time defeating 
the Diamondbacks, who were still paying Ortiz the large majority of his 
salary. However, later in the year, Ortiz was placed on the DL for an inflamed 
elbow, and when top prospect Tim Lincecum shined in his place, Ortiz was 
sent to the bullpen after his return. Ortiz was later placed again on the 
DL for a forearm strain and he returned in early August. On August 21, 
2007, Ortiz left a game in the 5th inning after throwing three balls. Ortiz 
appeared to be suffering from elbow pain. Ortiz had missed 73 games in 
2007 before this injury.[6] Ortiz underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed 
the entire 2008 MLB season.[7] On January 13, 2009, the Houston Astros 
signed Ortiz to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.[8] 
Ortiz won the job as the fifth starter for the Astros with a 3.18 ERA in 
seven spring training games.[9] Pitching in relief on April 8, 2009, he 
gave up a three-run home run to Mike Fontenot on his first pitch in an 
official major league game in almost two years.[10] However, after struggling 
in his first outing, Ortiz started this season 2–0. After that he went 
1–6. He had a record of 3–6 with a 5.57 ERA on July 30, 2009 when he was 
released by the Astros. On August 5, 2009 Ortiz signed a minor league contract 
with the New York Yankees.[11] He reported to AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
and joined a minor league starting rotation. On August 17, Ortiz opted 
out of his contract with the Yankees to become a free agent. On August 
22, 2009 Ortiz signed a minor-league deal with the Colorado Rockies and 
assigned to the Triple-A affiliate Colorado Springs. After going 0–1 with 
a 7.07 ERA for Colorado Springs he was released by the Rockies on September 
5, 2009.[12] On January 8, 2010, Ortiz signed a minor league deal with 
the Los Angeles Dodgers with an invite to spring training.[13] After good 
performances in spring training games, Ortiz was added to the Dodgers Major 
League roster to start the season. He was 0–1 with a 10.29 ERA in six appearances 
for the Dodgers and then was designated for assignment on April 18. He 
chose to decline a minor league assignment and became a free agent. He 
announced his retirement shortly afterward. Ortiz resides in Mesa, Arizona 
with his wife Stacy, two daughters Grace Elaine and Lilian Reid and son 
Hudson. In high school he was a teammate of future major league DH Brad 
Fullmer. Fullmer's Angels faced off against Ortiz' Giants in the 2002 World 
Series, and a 7th inning, Game 6 single by Fullmer chased Ortiz from the 
game (despite the Giants being up 5–0 at the time). Anaheim would rally 
to win the game 6–5 and eventually the World Series four games to three.
