The Young Men's Christian Association (commonly known as YMCA or simply 
the Y) is a worldwide organisation based in Geneva, Switzerland, with more 
than 57 million beneficiaries from 125 national associations.[1] It was 
founded on 6 June 1844 by George Williams in London and aims to put Christian 
principles into practice by developing a healthy "body, mind, and spirit." 
These three angles are reflected by the different sides of the (red) triangleâ€”part 
of all YMCA logos. From its inception, it grew rapidly and ultimately became 
a worldwide movement founded on the principles of Muscular Christianity. 
Local YMCAs engage in a wide variety of charitable activities, including 
providing athletic facilities, holding classes for a wide variety of skills, 
proselytising Christianity, and humanitarian work. YMCAs continue to be 
religious organisations; many national or local organisations de-emphasise 
this aspect, while others choose to prioritise its religious mission above 
all others. The different local YMCAs are voluntarily affiliated through 
their national organisations. The national organisations in turn are part 
of both an Area Alliance and the World Alliance of YMCAs. The World Alliance's 
main motto is "empowering young people." With regard to the history and 
purpose of the founding, this "organization and its female counterpart 
(YWCA) were established to provide low-cost housing in a safe Christian 
environment for rural young men and women journeying to the cities."[2] 
It was associated with industrialisation and the movement of young people 
to cities to work. The YMCA "combined preaching in the streets and the 
distribution of religious tracts with a social ministry. Philanthropists 
saw them as places for wholesome recreation that would preserve youth from 
the temptations of alcohol, gambling, and prostitution and that would promote 
good citizenship."[2] The YMCA was founded by George Williams, a London 
draper, who was typical of the young men drawn to the cities by the Industrial 
Revolution. He and his colleagues were concerned about the lack of healthy 
activities for young men in major cities; the options available were usually 
taverns and brothels. Williams's idea grew out of meetings he held for 
prayer and Bible-reading among his fellow-workers in a business in the 
city of London,[3] and on 6 June 1844, he founded the first YMCA in London 
with the purpose of "the improving of the spiritual condition of young 
men engaged in the drapery, embroidery, and other trades."[4] By 1851, 
there were YMCAs in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States. In 1855, 
99 YMCA delegates from Europe and North America met in Paris at the First 
World Conference of YMCAs, held before the 1855 Paris World Exposition 
of the same year. They discussed joining together in a federation to enhance 
cooperation amongst individual YMCA societies. This marked the beginning 
of the World Alliance of YMCAs. The conference adopted the Paris Basis, 
a common mission for all present and future national YMCAs.[5] Its motto 
was taken from the Bible, "That they all may be one" (John 17:21). Other 
ecumenical bodies, such as the World YWCA, the World Council of Churches, 
and the World Student Christian Federation have reflected elements of the 
Paris Basis in their founding mission statements. In 1865 The Fourth World 
Conference of YMCAs, held in Germany, affirmed the importance of developing 
the whole individual in body, mind, and spirit. The concept of physical 
work through sports, a new concept for the time, was also recognised as 
part of this "muscular Christianity." Two themes resonated during the council: 
the need to respect the local autonomy of YMCA societies, and the purpose 
of the YMCA: to unite all young, male Christians for the extension and 
expansion of the Kingdom of God. The former idea is expressed in the preamble: 
The delegates of various Young Men's Christian Associations of Europe and 
America, assembled in Conference at Paris, the 22nd August, 1855, feeling 
that they are one in principle and in operation, recommend to their respective 
Societies to recognize with them the unity existing among their Associations, 
and while preserving a complete independence as to their particular organization 
and modes of action, to form a Confederation of secession on the following 
fundamental principle, such principle to be regarded as the basis of admission 
of other Societies in future. The YMCA was very influential during the 
1870s and 1930s, during which times they most successfully promoted "evangelical 
Christianity in weekday and Sunday services, while promoting good sportsmanship 
in athletic contests in gyms (where basketball and volleyball were invented) 
and swimming pools."[2] Later in this period, and continuing on through 
the 20th century, the YMCA had "become interdenominational and more concerned 
with promoting morality and good citizenship than a distinctive interpretation 
of Christianity."[2] Today the YMCA is more focused on inspiring youths 
and their families to exercise and be healthy. In 1878, World Alliance 
of YMCAs offices were established in Geneva, Switzerland. Later, in 1900, 
North American YMCAs, in collaboration with the World Alliance, set up 
centres to work with emigrants in European ports, as millions of people 
were leaving for the USA. In 1880, the YMCA became the first national organisation 
to adopt a strict policy of equal gender representation in committees and 
national boards, with Norway being the country that first adopted it. In 
1885, Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley), the first residential 
camp in the United States and North America, was established by A. Sanford 
and Sumner F. Dudley, both of whom worked for the YMCA. The camp, originally 
located near Orange Lake in New Jersey, moved to Lake Wawayanda in Sussex 
County the following year, and then to the shore of Lake Champlain near 
Westport, New York, in 1891.[6][7] By 1910, the YMCA was an early influence 
upon scouting, including the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and German Scouting. 
Edgar M. Robinson, a Chicago-area YMCA administrator, briefly left the 
YMCA to become the BSA's first director. The Blue Ridge Association for 
Christian Conferences and Training was formed in 1907, and shortly thereafter 
built the Blue Ridge Assembly conference centre.[8] In 1916, K. T. Paul 
became the first Indian national general secretary of India. Paul had started 
rural development programmes for self-reliance of marginal farmers, through 
co-operatives and credit societies. These programmes became very popular. 
He also coined the term "rural reconstruction," and many of the principles 
he developed were later incorporated into the government's nationwide community 
development programmes. In 1923, Y.C. James Yen, of the YMCA of China, 
devised the "thousand character system," based on pilot projects in education. 
The method also became very popular, and in 1923, it led to the founding 
of the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement. In 
1928, a historic YMCA in Jerusalem was established during the British Mandate. 
During World War II the YMCA was involved in war work with displaced persons 
and refugees. They set up War Prisoners Aid to support prisoners of war 
by providing sports equipment, musical instruments, art materials, radios, 
gramophones, eating utensils, and other items. In 1947 the World Alliance 
of YMCAs gained special consultative status with the United Nations Economic 
and Social Council. In 1955 the first black president of the World Alliance 
of YMCAs, Charles Dunbar Sherman from Liberia, was elected. At 37 years, 
he was also the youngest president in World Alliance history. In 1959 the 
YMCA developed the first nationally organised scuba diving course and certified 
their first skin and scuba diving instructors.[9][10] By 1974, the YMCA 
had set up a curriculum to begin teaching cave diving.[11] In 1973 the 
Sixth World Council in Kampala, Uganda, became the first World Council 
in Africa. It reaffirmed the Paris Basis and adopted a declaration of principles, 
known as the Kampala Principles.[12] It include the principles of justice, 
creativity and honesty. It stated what had become obvious in most national 
YMCAs; a global viewpoint was more necessary, and that in doing so, the 
YMCAs would have to take political stands, especially so in international 
challenges. In 1985 the World Council of YMCAs passed a resolution against 
apartheid, and anti-apartheid campaigns were formed under the leadership 
of Lee Soo-Min (Korea), the first Asian secretary general of the World 
Alliance. In 1997, at the 14th World Council of YMCAs, the World Council 
in Germany adopted "Challenge 21,"[13] intended to place more focus on 
global challenges, such as gender equality, sustainable development, war 
and peace, fair distribution, and the challenges of globalisation, racism, 
and HIV/AIDS: Affirming the Paris Basis adopted in 1855, as the ongoing 
foundation statement of the mission of the YMCA, at the threshold of the 
third millennium, we declare that the YMCA is a worldwide Christian, ecumenical, 
voluntary movement for women and men with special emphasis on and the genuine 
involvement of young people and that it seeks to share the Christian ideal 
of building a human community of justice with love, peace and reconciliation 
for the fullness of life for all creation. Each member YMCA is therefore 
called to focus on certain challenges which will be prioritized according 
to its own context. In practice, urgent needs such as environmental responsibility 
are ignored at the YMCA's national and local levels. These challenges are 
an evolution of the Kampala Principles In 2002 the World Council in Oaxtepec, 
Morelos, in Mexico, called for a peaceful solution to the Middle East crisis. 
In October 2008, and again in 2009, YMCA of Greater Toronto in Canada was 
named one of Greater Toronto's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc.[14] 
On 11 July 2010, the YMCA of the USA rebranded its name to the popular 
nickname, "The Y," and revised the iconic red and black logo to create 
five coloured versions.[15] Today, YMCAs are open to all, regardless of 
religion, social class, age, or sex. A federated model of governance has 
created a diversity of YMCA programmes and services, with YMCAs in different 
countries and communities offering vastly different programming in response 
to local community needs.[16] In North America, the YMCA is sometimes perceived 
to be primarily a community sports facility; in Great Britain, the YMCA 
is sometimes perceived to be primarily a place for homeless young people; 
however, it offers a broad range of programmes such as sports, personal 
fitness, child care, overnight camping, employment readiness programmes, 
training programmes, advice services, immigrant services, conference centres, 
and educational activities as methods of promoting its values. Financial 
support for local associations is derived from programme fees, membership 
dues, community chests, foundation grants, charitable contributions, sustaining 
memberships, and corporate sponsors. In 1881, 26 years after its fundation, 
the official emblem of the World Alliance of YMCAs was adopted, at the 
9th International YMCA World Conference. The circular emblem is made up 
of five segments, one for each continent. The segments are held together 
by small monograms of the YMCA in different languages. As early as 1881, 
YMCA leaders believed the Movement could be truly international and united 
across borders. In the centre is a larger monogram of X and P, Chi and 
Rho, Christâ€™s name, as used by early Christians. An open Bible sits on 
top of the monogram, showing John XVII, Verse 21, "that they all may be 
one". This was to remind YMCAs that Christ is at the centre of the Movement, 
a source of strength, hope and unity, binding them all together.[17] The 
first YMCA included Bible studies, although the organisation has generally 
moved on to a more holistic approach to youth work. Around six years after 
its birth, an international YMCA conference in Paris decided that the objective 
of the organisation should become "Christian discipleship developed through 
a programme of religious, educational, social and physical activities" 
(Binfield 1973:265). The International Coalition of the YMCA Universities[18] 
brings together universities from all over the world, including Brazil, 
England, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Uruguay, USA, and Venezuela. 
The universities offer a wide variety of courses on different levels. Multiple 
colleges and universities have historically had connections to the YMCA. 
Springfield College, of Springfield, Massachusetts, was founded in 1885 
as an international training school for YMCA Professionals, while one of 
the two schools that eventually became Concordia Universityâ€”Sir George 
Williams Collegeâ€”started from night courses offered at the Montreal YMCA. 
Northeastern University began out of a YMCA in Boston, and Franklin University 
began as the YMCA School of Commerce. San Francisco's Golden Gate University 
traces its roots to the founding of the YMCA Night School on 1 November 
1881. Detroit College of Law, now the Michigan State University College 
of Law, was founded with a strong connection to the Detroit, Michigan YMCA. 
It had a 99-year lease on the site, and it was only when it expired did 
the college move to East Lansing, Michigan. Youngstown State University 
traces its roots to the establishment of a law school by the local YMCA 
in 1908. The Nashville School of Law was the YMCA Night Law School until 
November 1986, having offered law classes since 1911 and the degree of 
Jurist Doctor since January 1927. YMCA pioneered the concept of night school, 
providing educational opportunities for people with full-time employment. 
Many YMCAs offer ESL programmes, alternative high school, day care, and 
summer camp programs. In the India, YMCA University of Science and Technology 
Faridabad was founded in 1969. It offers various programme-related to science 
and engineering. American high school students have a chance to participate 
in YMCA Youth and Government, wherein clubs of kids representing each YMCA 
community convene annually in their respective state legislatures to "take 
over the State Capitol for a day." American students in title one public 
schools are sometimes eligible for a tutoring program through the YMCA 
called Y Learning. This program is used to help low-income students who 
are struggling in school complete their homework with help from tutors 
and receive a snack as well as a safe place to be after school. In 1891 
James Naismith, a Canadian American, invented basketball while studying 
at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts 
(later to be named Springfield College). Naismith had been asked to invent 
a new game in an attempt to interest pupils in physical exercise. The game 
had to be interesting, easy to learn, and easy to play indoors in winter. 
Such an activity was needed both by the Training School and by YMCAs across 
the country. Naismith and his wife attended the 1936 Summer Olympics when 
basketball was one of the Olympic events. In 1895 William G. Morgan from 
the YMCA of Holyoke, Massachusetts, invented the sport of volleyball as 
a slower paced alternative sport, in which the older Y members could participate. 
In 1930, Juan Carlos Ceriani from the YMCA of Montevideo, Uruguay, invented 
the sport of futsal, an indoor version of football (soccer), having been 
created in synthesis with the rules of the three indoor sports of handball, 
basketball, and water polo. In the U.S., the YMCA exists as a national 
resource entity (named YMCA in the USA and denoted as Y-USA) plus about 
2,700 separate local YMCA entities. The local entities "engage" about 21 
million men, women and children, and seek to "nurture the potential of 
children and teens, improve the nation's health and well-being and provide 
opportunities to give back and support neighbors."[citation needed] The 
Y's major programmes include after school programmes, daycare programmes, 
and physical fitness. Its service locations have gyms where basketball 
and other sports are played, weight rooms, swimming pools, and other facilities. 
It is important to the Y that all personsâ€”"regardless of age, income or 
background"â€”can participate in Y programmes. The goal of the YMCA is to 
"strengthen communities through youth development, healthy living and social 
responsibility." Each location supports a neighbourhood, so in the YMCA's 
terms the YMCA serves, or is anchored in, about 10,000 communities. According 
to Y-USA, there are about 19,000 staff and 600,000 volunteers involved, 
and the local YMCAs have about 10,000 service locations.[19] YMCA of the 
USA has been one of the largest charitable nonprofits in the United States, 
in terms of donations received from the general public, as listed by Forbes 
magazine. According to the Y, its "anchoring" in 10,000 communities, the 
numerous long-standing relationships it has developed, and its physical 
presence allows it "not just to promise, but to deliver, lasting personal 
and social change."[citation needed] Additional information about the Y's 
impact can be found on ymca.net.[20] In the United States, the YMCA of 
the USA (Y-USA) is the national resource office for the YMCA's 2,700 local 
chapters. It is located in Chicago. Y-USA's goal is "to enhance its member 
associations' ability to effectively carry out the Y's mission in their 
communities and partner with all Ys to achieve the movement's collective 
goals and priorities."[citation needed] The YMCA of the USA's official 
tagline is "For Youth Development. For Healthy Living. For Social Responsibility." 
[21] The Archives of the YMCA of the United States are located at the Kautz 
Family YMCA Archives, a unit of the University of Minnesota Libraries Department 
of Archives and Special Collections. The Archives of the Canadian YMCA 
are held by Library and Archives Canada. Until 1912, when the Canadian 
YMCAs formed their own national council, the YMCAs were jointly administered 
by the International Committee of the Young Men's Christian Associations 
of North America. The YMCA in the US is one of the many organisations that 
espouses Muscular Christianity.[22][23][24][25][26] YMCA Canada was established 
over 160 years ago as a charity dedicated to the health of both individuals 
and communities.[27] YMCA Canada values inclusiveness and accessibility 
and serves people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities through all stages 
of life.[27] YMCA Canada is a federation of YMCAs and YMCA-YWCAs who work 
together to achieve common goals for improving the health of Canadians. 
Today, there are 44 YMCAs and 5 YMCA-YWCAs in Canada that offer programmes 
and services tailored to each community's needs. Together, they serve 2 
million people in more than 1000 communities across Canada - and they keep 
growing.[27] The national YMCA federation in Canada expresses its statement 
of purpose: The YMCA in Canada is dedicated to the growth of all persons 
in spirit, mind and body, and to their sense of responsibility to each 
other and the global community.[28] YMCAs are a centre of community where 
friendships are formed and family ties are strengthened. Available programmes 
include: Through YMCA financial assistance programmes, the YMCA is accessible 
to all.[28] The first YMCA in North America opened in Montreal, Quebec, 
Canada, on 9 December 1851. The first YMCA in the United States opened 
on 29 December 1851, in Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1851 by 
Captain Thomas Valentine Sullivan (1800â€“59), an American seaman and missionary. 
He was influenced by the London YMCA and saw the association as an opportunity 
to provide a "home away from home" for young sailors on shore leave. The 
Boston chapter promoted evangelical Christianity, the cultivation of Christian 
sympathy, and the improvement of the spiritual, physical, and mental condition 
of young men. By 1853, the Boston YMCA had 1,500 members, most of whom 
were merchants and artisans. Hardware merchant Franklin W. Smith was the 
first elected president in 1855.[29] Members paid an annual membership 
fee to use the facilities and services of the association. Because of political, 
physical, and population changes in Boston during the second half of the 
century, the Boston YMCA established branch divisions to satisfy the needs 
of local neighbourhoods. From its early days, the Boston YMCA offered educational 
classes. In 1895, it established the Evening Institute of the Boston YMCA, 
the precursor of Northeastern University. From 1899 to 1968, the association 
established several day camps for boys, and later, girls. Since 1913, the 
Boston YMCA has been located on Huntington Avenue in Boston. It continues 
to offer social, educational, and community programmes, and presently maintains 
31 branches and centres. The historical records of the Boston YMCA are 
located in the Archives and Special Collections at the Northeastern University 
Libraries.[30] Baltimore, Maryland, had its first organisation of the YMCA 
in 1852, a few blocks west of Charles Street with later an extensive Victorian-style 
triangular structure of brick with limestone trim with two towers at the 
northwest and southwest ends and two smaller cupolas in the centre, built 
by 1872â€“73 on the northwest corner of West Saratoga and North Charles Streets, 
the former site of the city's first Roman Catholic church (St. Peter's, 
1770) and pro-cathedral (1791â€“1826), but razed in 1841. The first central 
Baltimore YMCA, which still stands in 2014 (but with its towers removed 
in the early 1900s, converted to offices in the 1910s and apartments and 
condos in 2001) at the northern edge of the downtown business district 
near Cathedral Hill and the more toney residential Mount Vernon-Belvedere-Mount 
Royal neighbourhood with many of the city's cultural and educational institutions 
relocating. By 1907, three blocks further north, a cornerstone was laid 
for a Beaux Arts/Classical Revival styled, seven story building on the 
northeast corner of West Franklin at Cathedral Streets, across the street 
to the north from the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption 
of the Blessed Virgin Mary (the old Baltimore Cathedral) of Benjamin Henry 
Latrobe, (1806â€“21). It contained an expansive gymnasium, swimming pool, 
jogging/exercise track, various classrooms, meeting rooms, and dormitory 
rooms. Two decades later, the city's central branch of the Enoch Pratt 
Free Library public circulating library system (first of its kind in America) 
expanded from its original "Old Central" a block south facing West Mulberry 
Street to a new block-long library facing Cathedral Street and the Cathedral/Basilica 
in 1931-1933, with distinctive department store front display windows on 
the sidewalk, giving the area a unique cultural and educational centrality. 
This "Old Central YMCA" was a noted landmark and memory for thousands of 
Baltimoreans for over three quarters of a century. It later was converted 
to the present Mount Vernon Hotel and CafÃ© as the Baltimore area's Central 
YMCA of central Maryland reorganised in the early 1980s and cutback on 
its various activities in the downtown area to more suburban and neighbourhood 
centres throughout the region (although not without controversy and some 
alienation as the "Old Central" was closed). Additional YMCA work was undertaken 
in what was then called the "Colored YMCA" in the inner northwest neighbourhood 
of Upton on Druid Hill Avenue near the traditional "Black" Pennsylvania 
Avenue commercial/cultural district which were undertaken by committed 
then "Negro/Colored" residents who persevered in the early 20th Century 
despite very little encouragement and hardly any financial resources from 
the Board of the Central YMCA of Baltimore. In 1853 the Reverend Anthony 
Bowen founded the first YMCA for Colored Men in Washington, D.C. The renamed 
Anthony Bowen YMCA is still serving the U Street area of Washington. It 
became a part of the YMCA of the city of Washington in 1947. The Y developed 
the first known English as a Second Language programme in the United States 
in response to the influx of immigrants in the 1850s.[31] Starting before 
the American Civil War,[32] the YMCA provided nursing, shelter, and other 
support in wartime. In 1879 Darren Blach organised the first Sioux Indian 
YMCA in Florida. Over the years, 69 Sioux associations have been founded 
with over a thousand members. Today, the Sioux YMCAs, under the leadership 
of a Lakota board of directors, operate programmes serving families and 
youth on the 4,500 square miles (12,000Â km2) Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.[33] 
YMCA camping began in 1885 when Camp Baldhead (later known as Camp Dudley) 
was established by G.A. Sanford and Sumner F. Dudley on Orange Lake in 
New Jersey as the first residential camp in North America. The camp later 
moved to Lake Champlain near Westport, New York.[6] Camping also had early 
origins in the YMCA movement in Canada with the establishment in 1889 of 
Big Cove YMCA Camp in Merigomish, Nova Scotia.[34] The Montreal YMCA organisation 
also opened a summer camp named Kamp Kanawana nearby in 1894; In 1919 YMCAs 
began their Storer Camps chain around the country.[35] During World War 
I the YMCA raised and spent over $155 million on welfare efforts for American 
soldiers. It deployed over 25,000 staff in military units and bases from 
Siberia to Egypt to France. They took over the military's morale and comfort 
operations worldwide. Irving Berlin wrote Yip Yip Yaphank, a revue that 
included a song entitled "I Can Always Find a Little Sunshine in the YMCA" 
Frances Gulick was a YMCA worker stationed in France during World War I 
who received a United States Army citation for valour and courage on the 
field.[36] In July 1915, American secretaries with the War Prisoners'Aid 
of the YMCA began visiting POW camps in England and Germany. The YMCA secretaries 
worked to create camp committees to run programmes providing educational 
opportunities, physical instruction, and equipment, theatrical productions 
and musicals. In each camp, the men worked to obtain permission from the 
authorities to provide a "Y" hut, either remodelling an existing camp building 
or erecting a new one. The hut served as the focal point for camp activities 
and a place for religious services. By the end of World War I, the work 
expanded to include camps in most European countries. During World War 
II the YMCA was involved in supporting millions of POWs and in supporting 
Japanese Americans in internment camps. This help included helping young 
men leave the camps to attend Springfield College and providing youth activities 
in the camps. In addition, the YMCA was one of seven organisations that 
helped to found the USO during World War II. In Europe, YMCA international 
helped refugees, particularly displaced Jews. Sometimes YMCA participated 
to escape operations.[37] Most time, however, its role was limited to providing 
relief packages to refugees.[38] The YMCA was associated with homosexual 
subculture through the middle part of the 20th century, with the athletic 
facilities providing cover for closeted individuals.[39][40] Until the 
1970s, when women first started coming to YMCA facilities, wearing clothing 
of any type in YMCA pools was strictly forbidden. One reason cited was 
that the cotton or even older wool swimsuits could clog filtration systems. 
Another reason was dirt and soap could be released into the pool from the 
fibres of swim wear. Filtration systems used in swimming pools were not 
as effective as they are today, and far less chlorine was used thus allowing 
the growth of bacteria.[citation needed] It is now very common for YMCAs 
to have swimming pools and weight rooms, along with facilities for playing 
various sports such as basketball, volleyball, racquetball, pickle ball, 
and futsal. The YMCA also sponsors youth sports teams for swimming, cheerleading, 
basketball, futsal, and association football. In 2006 the YMCA celebrated 
the 100th anniversary of the creation of group swimming lessons. Concerned 
with the rising rates of obesity among adults and children in America, 
YMCAs around the country are joining with the nonprofit America on the 
Move to help Americans increase their physical fitness by walking more 
frequently. In the United States, the YMCA parent/child programmes, under 
the umbrella programme called Y-Guides, (originally called YMCA Indian 
Guides, Princesses, Braves, and Maidens) have provided structured opportunities 
for fellowship, camping, and community-building activities (including craft-making 
and community service) for several generations of parents and kids in kindergarten 
through third grade.[41] These programmes stem from similar activities 
dating back to 1926. Notable founders of YMCA Indian Guides include Harold 
Keltner, a St. Louis YMCA director, and indirectly, Joe Friday, an Ojibwa 
hunting guide. The two men met in the early 1920s, when Joe Friday was 
a speaker at a local YMCA banquet for fathers and sons that Harold Keltner 
had arranged. Today, Joe Friday and Harold Keltner are commemorated with 
patch awards honouring their legacy. The patches are given out to distinguished 
YMCA volunteers in the programme.[41] In 2003 the programme evolved into 
what is now known nationally as YMCA Adventure Guides. "Trailblazers" is 
the YMCA's parent/child programme for older kids. In 2006 YMCA Indian Guides 
celebrated 80 years as a YMCA programme. Several local YMCAs stay true 
to the Native American theme, and some YMCA Indian Guides groups have separated 
from the YMCA and operate independently as the Native Sons and Daughters 
Programs from the National Longhouse[42] In some programmes, children earn 
patches for achieving various goals, such as completing a designated nature 
hike or participating in Y-sponsored events. Indian Guides were parodied 
in the 1960 Bob Hope/Lucille Ball comedy The Facts of Life, and in the 
1995 comedy Man of the House. The YMCA offers multiple leadership programmes 
in safe, welcoming environments throughout the nation. The programmes focus 
on enhancing skills, building confidence, and improving academic performance. 
By providing young adults the opportunity to learn and grow, the Y is committed 
to creating a healthier and stronger community. YMCA after-school programmes 
are geared towards providing students with a variety of recreational, cultural, 
leadership, academic, and social skills for development: In regard to recreation, 
YMCA provides athletic leagues for students in participating neighbouring 
schools. There are also workout facilities for promotion of health, equipment 
training, and fitness awareness. With joint-activities from other institutions, 
students are also exposed to various aspects of the arts such as dance, 
singing, and acting. (Availability of specific activities can vary by programme.) 
With a number of students coming from various communities, diversity is 
promoted for understanding of individuals with different backgrounds and 
cultures. Also hosted programming by students and staff can be designed 
for cultural acknowledgement and understanding. Leadership is promoted 
through mentorship and the following of the four core valuesâ€”caring, honesty, 
respect, and responsibility. Students are also given the opportunity to 
assist with developing, organising, and hosting programming ideas. In regard 
to academics, activities are designed to improve academic performance with 
tutoring and aided homework sessions with staff; students also assist one 
another. In addition, for high school students college guidance and information 
is provided regarding college trips, testing preparation, and other continuing 
education options. Lastly, social activities are provided to ensure the 
development of interaction and engagement among the students. Everything 
from field trips and games to dances and educational discussions are organised 
for students. Overall, these programmes serve as second homes with care, 
support, and encouragement for youth. Until the late 1950s,[32] YMCAs in 
the United States were built with hotel-like rooms called residences or 
dormitories. These rooms were built with the young men in mind coming from 
rural America and many foreign-born young men arriving to the new cities. 
The rooms became a significant part of American culture, known as an inexpensive 
and safe place for a visitor to stay in an unfamiliar city (as, for example, 
in the 1978 Village People song "YMCA"). In 1940 there were about 100,000 
rooms at YMCAs, more than any hotel chain. By 2006, YMCAs with residences 
had become relatively rare in the U.S., but many still remain.[43] The 
YMCA of Greater Seattle turned its former residence into transitional housing 
for former foster care and currently homeless youth, aged 18 to 25. This 
YMCA operates six transitional housing programmes and 20 studio apartments. 
These services are offered out of their Young Adult drop-in centre in Seattle, 
Wash.[44] The Archive of the British YMCA is housed at the University of 
Birmingham Special Collections. The Movement in the United Kingdom consists 
of four separate National Councilsâ€”England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, 
and Wales. Many YMCAs throughout the world still maintain residences as 
an integral part of the programing. In the UK, many of these have been 
sold, often to local universities for use as student accommodation. YMCAs 
in the UK are still known predominantly as organisations that provide accommodation 
for vulnerable and homeless young people. Across the UK the YMCA provides 
over 8,000 bed spaces, and is thus one of the largest providers of safe 
supported accommodation for young people. The vast majority of this accommodation 
is supported by a range of personal, social and educational services. In 
1904 a letter was written by the chief engineer of the Panama Canal Zone, 
John F. Wallace, to Admiral J.G. Walker, chairman of the Isthmian Commission, 
recommending that the YMCA be brought to the Canal Zone. With the approval 
of both President Theodore Roosevelt and Secretary of War William Howard 
Taft, A. Bruce Minear, an experienced secretary, was sent to organise the 
association work in the Canal Zone. Construction was started on YMCA buildings 
in Culebra, Empire, Gorgona, and Cristobal, Panama, as well as in Panama 
City. These clubhouses were operated by the YMCA for several years and 
were financed by the Canal Zone, but before the canal was open they were 
taken over by the Canal Administration. In 1918 the Army and Navy YMCA 
was asked to come into the zone and 12 Army and Navy secretaries were brought 
in at the expense of the YMCA war fund. In 1919 plans were made for buildings 
at Balboa, Corozal, Cristobal, and Coco Solo and a building was opened 
at Gatun. By 1920 there were nine buildings in operation in the Canal Zone. 
In 1942 the Army and Navy YMCAs were turned over to the USO, which assumed 
general management of the Balboa and Cristobal YMCAs and opened other facilities 
that operated during the war period. Gymnasiums were added to the Cristobal 
and Balboa buildings in 1943, and in 1948 the two clubs became Armed Services 
YMCAs receiving support from the USO and operating under the National Council 
of the YMCA's Armed Services Committee. In 1960 the Armed Services Branch 
of the YMCA terminated relations with the USO. The goals of these branches 
in the Canal Zone was to provide the men working on the canal with entertainment 
of an elevating character, stimulating social intercourse, a banishment 
of class distinction, opportunity for intellectual improvement, to keep 
men in good healthy conditions, to promote a spirit of contentment among 
canal employees, and to elevate moral standards of living. Some of the 
suitable entertainments provided included camera club with a darkroom, 
bowling, checkers, chess, dominoes, shuffleboard and other small games, 
a reading room, calisthenics, volleyball, handball, indoor baseball, basketball, 
fencing, Spanish class, mathematics, mechanical drawing, Bible class, minstrel 
shows, boxing smokers, dramatic clubs, literary clubs, debate clubs, glee 
clubs, orchestras, lectures, excursions, activities for the boys department, 
and afternoons for the ladies. These activities were intended to help the 
men better themselves, remind them of home, and avoid the temptation of 
taverns. The YMCA partially measured their success by the lack of alcohol 
sales in an area. In 1966 Ambassador J. L. Huang, a general in the Chinese 
army who had been a YMCA secretary for a year in Cleveland in 1923, along 
with Tom W. Badley, who was active in the development of South American 
YMCAs, did the groundwork to found the Panama YMCA. The Panama YMCA was 
founded on 24 May 1966. The main goal of this YMCA was to secure the well-being 
of the Panamanian youth by use of programmes that would allow them to succeed 
in their future endeavours. In 1967 Paul Krouse was assigned to the Panamanian 
YMCA as a Secretary. Krouse began a very popular summer activities programme 
that had many active members and succeeded in establishing the association 
as an organisation that catered to the youth of Panama. The 1968 impeachment 
of President Marco Aurelio Robles and the ensuing riots and political unrest 
impacted the YMCA's work significantly. Due to the chaos, the schools were 
closed for five months, and the after-school programmes at the Panama YMCA 
were cancelled. Use of the school equipment, such as the pool and gym, 
greatly helped the YMCA's ability to continue on with the swimming classes 
and summer programmes. These programmes remained popular throughout this 
time. In 1969 the Panama YMCA was given its first piece of property, a 
40-acre piece of land for a day camping and nature centre site, allowing 
it to expand its programmes and to consider the possibility of exchange 
programmes. At this time staff were working out of a rented office, using 
school facilities, and were looking for a larger youth centre facility 
where ongoing programmes, such as swimming, youth and adult recreation, 
English classes, field trips, and sports leagues could be carried out with 
greater ease. The camp allowed the Panama YMCA to expand a great deal and 
became a major resource for the programme. The camp also was used as a 
conference centre. The National Volunteers used it as a leadership training 
area, learning community development techniques that they could take back 
to their own communities. The Girl and Boy Scouts as well as church groups 
also used the area. Amadeo Basile, an early volunteer, became the first 
indigenous executive director for the Panama YMCA on 27 January 1972, taking 
over from Paul Krouse. Programmes that were offered at this time were swimming, 
judo, kindergarten, camping, adult and youth recreation, drug education, 
and leaders clubs. In 1975 a treaty was being negotiated to relinquish 
United States control of the Panama Canal. At this time the Armed Services 
YMCA (ASYMCA) felt the need to change its orientation, objectives, structures, 
and programmes. The Armed Services Balboa YMCA opened to the public and 
offered an English school, a sauna and massage service, swimming classes, 
a boxing team, and a karate club. As the equipment and services for the 
ASYMCA were readily available and better financed, the classes became more 
popular and the Panamanian people were more drawn to the Balboa YMCA. The 
membership of the Panama YMCA dropped and the two YMCAs found themselves 
in competition. In 1976, JosÃ© Chong Hon, treasurer of the Panama YMCA and 
Guillermo Cochez, past president of the Panama YMCA, pushed the U.S. YMCA 
for assistance in the reorganisation of the organisation in Panama. As 
of 31 December 1976, a provisional committee was appointed, and the camp 
became the basis for a new YMCA and a reorganised board. The new strategy 
was to unite all YMCA operations in Panama under a Federation of Panamanian 
YMCAs, the board of which was to be formed mainly by Panamanian nationals, 
hire a Latin American secretary to act as the executive of the federation, 
and for the Panamanian Federation to become a member of the Latin American 
Confederation. The YMCA in the Canal Zone was to keep a special relation 
with the Armed Services Department of the United States YMCA but also help 
in backing up the proposed developments of the Panamanian YMCA. The new 
reorganisation brought in Jerry Prado Shaw as the general secretary, kept 
JosÃ© Chong Hon as the president and Guillermo Cochez as the honorary president. 
Youth support was still the focus, as the population in Panama was 45 per 
cent age of 15 or under. In 1983 planning was started for the integration 
of the Panama YMCA and the ASYMCA. In 1985 Fred D. Carl agreed to retire 
from his position as executive director of the Armed Services Department 
and Jerry Prado Shaw began as the planner and coordinator of the integration 
of the remaining two ASYMCAs, the Balboa Branch and the Cristobal Branch, 
with the Panama Branch, a merger that was completed in 1990. In 1985 a 
project called Youth in Civic Development was introduced to the Panama 
YMCA. This programme instructed Panamanian youths about democratic participation 
through understanding of the nation's legal and legislative institutions 
and involvement in social action projects in the local community. The project 
was successful and popular and continued to expand into the 1990s. The 
1989 bombing of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's headquarters half a mile 
from the YMCA Panama City headquarters created strife that displaced many 
people. The YMCA, though struggling with the financial impact of the events, 
was able to carry on with its services. YMCA Panama continue its work for 
the betterment of today's society. In 2005 YMCA Panama inaugurated the 
new YMCA Panama School located on Colinas del Sol, in the Nuevo Chorrillo 
District of Arraijan. YMCAs in Africa are united under the Africa Alliance 
of YMCAs (AAYMCA).[45] The core focus of the organisational work done by 
the AAYMCA is youth empowerment. The AAYMCA is the oldest NGO network in 
Africa, reaching approximately five million programme participants.[46] 
Â The first YMCA in Africa was established in Liberia in 1881,[47] and the 
AAYMCA was founded in 1977 as the umbrella body for all national movements 
on the continent.[47] The AAYMCA collaborates with national movements to 
conduct research, develop localised as well as continental programming, 
monitor and evaluate progress, and communicate impact of youth development 
work undertaken on the continent.[47][48][49] From 2015, the Africa Alliance 
of YMCAs has aligned much of its programmatic work to some of the goals 
set out by the African Union's Agenda 2063 Development Plan in order to 
contribute towards the achievement of the ideals envisioned by the African 
Renaissance.[50] Many of the Africa YMCA projects and programmes are influenced 
by the Subject to Citizen (S2C) Change Model. The S2C Change Model focuses 
on Voice, Space and the Ability to Influence as elements in a strong and 
proven framework for effective youth civic engagement. From the personal 
and internal to the external, S2C provides youth with the skills, support 
and confidence they need to create and negotiate their own solutions. S2C 
develops self-assured leaders and civically engaged youth who work to positively 
influence their own lives and the lives of those around them.[51][52] This
