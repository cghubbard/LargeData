Shin-Soo Choo (Hangul: 추신수; Hanja: 秋信守; born July 13, 1982) is a South 
Korean professional baseball right fielder for the Texas Rangers of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He has also played for the Seattle Mariners, Cleveland 
Indians, and Cincinnati Reds. Choo was selected as the Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) and Best Pitcher of the 2000 World Junior Baseball Championship as 
South Korea won the event. Choo signed a $1.35 million contract with the 
Mariners after the championship and converted to the outfield. Choo made 
his Major League Baseball debut with the Seattle Mariners on April 21, 
with the Class A affiliate for the Seattle Mariners the Wisconsin Timber 
Rattlers in 2005, but spent most of the 2005 season and the first half 
of the 2006 season in the minor leagues with the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate, 
the Tacoma Rainiers. He batted .068 in a handful of major league at-bats 
over two years. He was traded to the Cleveland Indians along with minor 
leaguer Shawn Nottingham on July 26, 2006, for first baseman Ben Broussard.[1] 
Two days after being traded, Choo hit a solo home run against his former 
club in a 1–0 Indians victory. In 45 games with the Indians, he batted 
.295 (43 for 146) with three home runs and 22 RBIs. He spent the first 
few weeks of the 2007 regular season with the Buffalo Bisons, a Triple-A 
team in the International League affiliated with the Indians, before being 
called up on April 23, 2007, to take the place of the injured third baseman 
Andy Marte.[2] He was optioned back to Buffalo on May 3.[3] Choo missed 
several months of the 2007 season due to injury and in September 2007 underwent 
Tommy John surgery on his left elbow.[4] In the 2008 season, Choo was called 
up on May 31 and spent the rest of the season with the Indians. He finished 
the season (after 317 at-bats) with a .309 batting average, 98 hits, 14 
home runs, and 66 RBIs. His hit and RBI totals were also a new record by 
a South Korean-born player in the MLB. Thanks to a hot September where 
he put up a .400 batting average, 34 hits, 5 home runs, and 24 RBIs, Choo 
was named the AL Player of the Month.[5] In February 2009, he signed a 
one-year contract with the Indians.[6] During that season, he broke his 
own records for home runs, RBIs, stolen bases and hits. On July 3, Choo 
hit two home runs and a career-high seven RBIs in an Indians 15–3 victory 
over the Oakland Athletics. On October 3, 2009, Choo hit his twentieth 
homer off of Paul Byrd of the Boston Red Sox, thus joining the 20-20 club. 
He is the first Asian to accomplish this feat in the Major Leagues.[7] 
He was also the only player in the AL to have a .300 average, 20 home runs, 
and 20 stolen bases at the same time. He finished the season with 20 home 
runs, 21 steals, 86 RBIs, and a .300 batting average. On February 26, 2010, 
Choo hired baseball agent Scott Boras.[8] Choo became eligible for arbitration 
after the 2010 season, and agreed to a $3.975 million deal.[9] Choo hit 
three home runs in a road game against the Kansas City Royals on September 
17, 2010. He first hit a two-run homer 420 ft to right in the top of the 
fourth inning. In his next at bat he hit a towering grand slam to deep 
center. In the top of the eighth Choo hit a 405 ft solo homer over the 
right field wall. Choo finished the game a three-run homer away from the 
elusive "home run cycle". On September 19, 2010, Choo again reached the 
20-20 club of 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases for the second straight 
year. He also led the AL right fielders in assists with 14.[10] Choo showed 
promise in spring training, hitting for a .322 average with three home 
runs in 19 games. However, Choo's season fell apart quickly. In what was 
his worst statistical season as an Indian, Choo finished the season with 
eight home runs, a .259 batting average, 12 stolen bases, and 36 RBIs while 
accumulating 78 strikeouts and 36 walks in 313 at-bats. On June 24, Choo 
was hit by San Francisco Giants pitcher Jonathan Sánchez on his left thumb. 
The resulting fracture kept him out for six weeks.[11] On August 23, during 
the first game of a double header against his former club, the Seattle 
Mariners, a game in which during an earthquake he hit a double. In the 
ninth inning, Choo hit his first walk-off home run. On September 1, Choo 
pulled a side muscle and was placed on the disabled list again, ending 
his season.[12] On April 14 in a game against the Kansas City Royals which 
would see bench clearings by both teams, Choo was hit by Royals starter 
Jonathan Sánchez on his right knee. It was a pitch from Sanchez that hit 
Choo in 2011, resulting in a broken thumb and nearly two months on the 
disabled list. Choo would finish the game and win it for the Indians in 
the tenth inning when he hit a two-run double.[13] On April 24, Choo left 
in the eighth inning in a game versus the Royals after suffering a mild 
hamstring strain.[14] Choo would return on May 2 in a 6–3 Indians win versus 
the Chicago White Sox.[15] On May 24 in series finale home game against 
the Detroit Tigers, Choo hit a second-deck home run off of Tigers starter 
Justin Verlander in the first inning. That was Choo's first career lead-off 
home run. The Indians won that game 2-1, finishing the sweep against the 
Tigers. On December 11, 2012, Choo was traded to the Cincinnati Reds along 
with Jason Donald in a three team, nine player deal also involving the 
Arizona Diamondbacks. The trade brought Trevor Bauer, Matt Albers, Bryan 
Shaw, and Drew Stubbs to the Cleveland Indians.[16] On February 11, 2013, 
Choo avoided arbitration with his new team, the Reds, by agreeing to a 
one-year, $7.375 million deal, the exact midpoint between both sides.[17] 
On May 8, 2013, Choo hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th inning 
in a game with the Atlanta Braves. It was his second walk-off home run 
in Major League Baseball.[18] On August 27 in a game against the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Choo hit his 100th career home run. On September 9, 2013, Choo 
set the Reds' team record for hit by pitches in a season.[19] On October 
2, 2013 Choo homered in the bottom of the 8th inning in the wild-card game 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He is the first South Korean batter who 
hit a home run in Major League Baseball postseason.[20] On December 21, 
2013, it was reported that Choo had agreed a seven-year, $130 million contract 
with the Texas Rangers, pending a physical examination.[21] The Rangers 
officially introduced Choo on December 27. However his first season with 
the team did not go well. He battled ankle injuries for most of the season 
and played in only 123 games while putting up a slash line of .242/.340/.374; 
making 2014 the worst season of his ten-year career. It was a major blow 
to the Rangers as they heavily invested that he and newly acquired Prince 
Fielder would contribute to help the team win a division title. Instead 
he was added unto the long list of injuries that kept the Rangers out of 
contention along with Prince Fielder, Mitch Moreland, Matt Harrison, Derek 
Holland, and many others.[22] On July 21, 2015, Choo hit for the cycle 
against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field. In doing so, he became the 
ninth player in Rangers history to hit for the cycle as well as the first 
Asian player in the MLB to accomplish this feat. He vastly improved in 
2015. In a crucial role, he hit .276 with 22 home runs and 82 RBIs with 
a .375 OBP. [23] On August 16, 2016, it was announced that Choo would miss 
the rest of the season when he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with 
a fracture in his left forearm.[24] Choo was on the 2009 World Baseball 
Classic South Korean roster. Cleveland allowed Choo to play under the condition 
that he play only one game or less as an outfielder in the first round, 
and only in two non-consecutive games of the second round.[25] Cleveland 
lifted this restriction from the semifinals on, and Choo started as an 
outfielder in the semifinal match against Venezuela. He helped South Korea 
win 10-2 against Venezuela with a three-run home run against Carlos Silva 
in the first inning. He also contributed a solo home run in the fifth inning 
in the finals against Hisashi Iwakuma of Japan, where South Korea lost 
to Japan 5–3. Choo and his wife Won-mi Ha have three children, Alan, Aiden, 
and Abigail.[26][27] Choo is the nephew of Park Jeong-Tae, a former second 
baseman for the Lotte Giants.[28] Choo has been a close friend of Lee Dae-Ho, 
infielder in the Seattle Mariners organization, since attending the same 
elementary school together.[29] Early in the morning on Monday, May 4, 
2011, Choo was arrested and charged with drunk driving in Sheffield Lake, 
Ohio.[30] He was pulled over by police around 2:25 a.m. because of his 
vehicle weaving, and Choo's blood alcohol content (via Breathalyzer test) 
was reportedly 0.20%, more than twice the legal limit in the state.[31]
