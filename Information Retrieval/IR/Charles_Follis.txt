Charles W. Follis, a.k.a. "The Black Cyclone," (February 3, 1879 – April 
5, 1910) was the first black professional American football player. He 
played for the Shelby Blues of the "Ohio League" from 1902 to 1906. On 
September 16, 1904, Follis signed a contract with Shelby making him the 
first black contracted to play professional football. He was also the first 
black catcher to move from college baseball onto a black professional baseball 
team.[1] Charles W. Follis was born on February 3, 1879 to James Henry 
and Catherine Matilda Anderson Follis in Cloverdale, Virginia. James Henry 
(b. 1846– d. 1910) and Catherine Matilda (b. 1848– d.1922) were married 
in Virginia in 1873. Charles W. Follis' father was a farm laborer. Charles 
was probably the third born of seven children. The older siblings were 
Lelia M. (b. 1874) and Cora Belle (b. 1876). Sister Laura Alice was born 
in 1880 and brother Curtis W. was born in 1884 and died in 1903. In 1885, 
the family moved to Wooster, Ohio where Walter Joseph (b. 1888) and Lucy 
Jane (b. 1890) were born. Follis entered Wooster College, in 1901, however 
he chose to play football for the amateur Wooster Athletic Association, 
rather than the college squad. As a member of the Wooster Athletic Association 
that he would earn the nickname, "The Black Cyclone." At the end of the 
1901 season, Wooster played the Shelby Blues in a two-game series. Follis' 
performance brought him to the attention of the Shelby team manager, Frank 
C. Schiffer, who decided he wanted Follis to play with his team, not against 
them. He secured Follis for his team and set him up with a job at a local 
hardware store. Charles' working hours were arranged so that he could both 
practice and play football.[2] During the 1902 and 1903 seasons, Follis 
played for Shelby. During a 58–0 win over a team from Fremont, Follis ran 
for a 60-yard touchdown. In 1904, he helped lead the Blues to an 8–1–1 
record. Their only loss was to the Massillon Tigers, the 1904 Ohio League 
champions. In 1906, the Blues became an entirely open professional team. 
Charles missed the early part of the season due to an injury, however he 
did return in the second half of the season. Finally, on Thanksgiving Day 
1906, while playing against the Franklin Athletic Club of Cleveland, he 
suffered another injury, though this one ended his career. Follis was also 
the first black catcher to move from college baseball into the Negro Leagues. 
During the 1901 and 1902 seasons, while playing for Wooster University, 
Follis became well known in the Ohio college circuit. His closest competitor 
at the position, was Branch Rickey of nearby Ohio Wesleyan University. 
In 1902, he left Wooster University and by 1909 he was catching for the 
Cuban Giants. He became the Giants' star catcher, their leading slugger 
and their most popular player. Follis was credited with many stolen bases, 
double plays, and even two triple plays in his career. However he had a 
better reputation as a power hitter. On May 16, 1906, Buttons Briggs, a 
pitcher formerly of the National League's Chicago Cubs, was brought in 
by Elyria to pitch against the Wooster Giants. This moved was intended 
to intimate Wooster, since Briggs won 20 games in 1905. However Follis 
as the lead-off batter in the first inning, first ball hit a home run off 
the former major league star's first pitch. He completed the day with four-for-six 
against Buttons.[1] In 1910, Follis died at the age of 31, from pneumonia.[2] 
While Follis’ professionalism was reported by the local press, his role 
as the first black professional football player was not known by sports 
historians until many years later. In 1975, researchers rediscovered halfback 
Follis’ on-the-field-achievements while reviewing old pages of the Shelby 
Daily Globe, with the goal to locate evidence that Follis had played as 
a professional. After hours of examining the tattered newspapers, researchers 
finally came across an article in the September 16, 1904 edition that announced 
Follis had signed a contract for the upcoming season.[3] One of Follis' 
Shelby teammates during the 1902 and 1903 seasons was Branch Rickey. Rickey 
would later become the general manager of baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers and 
Pittsburgh Pirates. He was often hired to play for Shelby while attending 
nearby Ohio Wesleyan University. Rickey also played against Follis on October 
17, 1903, when he ran for a 70-yard touchdown against the Ohio Wesleyan 
football team. It is highly probable that Rickey's first-hand observation 
of Follis influenced his decision to sign Jackie Robinson to a Major League 
Baseball contract in 1947, breaking baseball's color barrier[1] In 1998, 
the football field/outdoor track facility at Wooster High School, Follis 
Field, was dedicated in his honor. In August 2013, a play named "The Black 
Cyclone" was put on at the Malabar Farm State Park in Lucas, Ohio. The 
script was written by an area playwright, Jim Stoner. The story relives
