The 1984 Detroit Tigers won the 1984 World Series, defeating the San Diego 
Padres, 4 games to 1. The season was their 84th since they entered the 
American League in 1901 and their fourth World Series championship. Detroit 
relief pitcher Willie Hernández won the Cy Young Award and was chosen as 
the American League Most Valuable Player. The 1984 season is also notable 
for the Tigers leading the AL East division wire-to-wire. They opened with 
a 9–0 start, were 35–5 after 40 games, and never relinquished the lead 
during the entire season. Catcher Lance Parrish, known as the "Big Wheel", 
led the team in home runs (33) and RBIs (98) -- and strikeouts (120) as 
well. Parrish was the starting catcher for the American League All Star 
team and won the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards in 1984. He hit 2 
home runs and had 5 RBIs in postseason play. Dave Bergman was acquired 
from the Giants (via the Phillies) in March 1984 and became the Tigers' 
principal first baseman, playing 114 games at the position. He hit .273 
in the regular season, but failed to get a hit in 5 games of the 1984 World 
Series. On June 4, 1984, Bergman had an 11th inning at-bat at home in a 
big game against second-place Toronto, who at that point trailed the Tigers 
by only five games. The at-bat lasted 13 pitches (7 minutes), with Bergman 
fouling off seven straight pitches from Roy Lee Jackson before hitting 
a walk-off, three-run home run. Sparky Anderson called it the greatest 
at-bat he had ever seen.[1] Second baseman Lou Whitaker, known as "Sweet 
Lou", had his best year in 1983, hitting .320 with 40 doubles and 206 hits. 
Though his batting numbers were much lower in 1984 (.289 average, 25 doubles 
and 161 hits), he was selected as the starting second baseman for the American 
League All Star team and won the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards in 
1984. Shortstop Alan Trammell had a big year in 1984. His .314 batting 
average was 5th best in the American League and 25 points higher than any 
other Tiger. He was selected for the American League All Star team and 
won his 4th Gold Glove award at shortstop. Trammell was also named the 
Most Valuable Player of the 1984 World Series after batting .450, driving 
in 6 runs and hitting 2 home runs. Third base was a weak spot in the Detroit 
lineup, with light-hitting Tom Brookens entering as the starter from 1980 
to 1983. In 1984, manager Sparky Anderson searched for the right third 
baseman, as five different players appeared in 19 or more games at the 
position that season: 108 by Howard Johnson, 68 by Brookens, 33 by Marty 
Castillo, 20 by Bárbaro Garbey, and 19 by Darrell Evans. Howard Johnson, 
nicknamed "HoJo", was the starting third baseman on Opening Day and through 
most of the 1984 season. Johnson had a disappointing year, batting .248 
with 12 home runs and 50 RBIs. In the 1984 World Series, Sparky Anderson 
gave the third base job to Marty Castillo, and HoJo had only 1 pinch-hit 
at bat. Johnson was traded to the Mets less than 2 months after the World 
Series, and went on to have some big years in New York (36 HRs, 101 RBIs 
in 1989). The image of Kirk Gibson with his arms raised above his head 
after hitting a 3-run home run in the 1984 World Series has become the 
iconic symbol of the Tigers' 1984 season. The blast came off Goose Gossage, 
the best reliever in the National League, in the 8th inning of the 5th 
and final game. It put the Tigers ahead, 8–4, and sealed the championship. 
During the regular season, the Detroit area native played right field and 
led the team with a .516 slugging percentage. He also contributed 27 home 
runs, 91 RBIs and 29 stolen bases, and was #6 in the American League Most 
Valuable Player voting. Chet Lemon was the starting center fielder in the 
1984 All Star game and a major contributor to the Tigers' success in 1984. 
One of the best defensive outfielders in baseball, Lemon had 427 putouts 
in 1984 with a .995 fielding percentage; his 3.09 Range factor rating was 
far above the league average of 2.17. Lemon also contributed to the team's 
offensive output with a .287 batting average, 20 home runs, 34 doubles, 
76 RBIs, and a.495 slugging percentage. Larry Herndon played 117 games 
in left field for the 1984 Tigers and hit .280. In the World Series, he 
had a .333 batting average and hit a home run. His 2-run homer in Game 
1 was the difference in a 3–2 Tigers win. He also caught the final out 
of the World Series, a fly ball off the bat of Tony Gwynn. Jack Morris 
was the leader of the Tigers pitching staff. He started the season with 
a no-hitter in April and was 10–1 before the end of May. He was selected 
for the 1984 All Star team, but finished the season 9–10 from June through 
September. He was 19–11 in the regular season with a 3.60 ERA. He won all 
three of his post-season starts, tossing two complete games and allowing 
only five earned runs in 25 innings (1.80 ERA). The team's #2 starter, 
Dan Petry, finished the year 18–8 with the 3rd best winning percentage 
(.692) in the American League. His 3.24 ERA in the regular season was the 
lowest among the Tiger starters. The team's #3 starter, Milt Wilcox, was 
17–8 with a 4.00 ERA. Wilcox was 2–0 in the post-season, giving up only 
1 run in 14 innings. He combined with the bullpen to shut out the Royals, 
1–0, in the third and final game of the ALCS. Though Morris was the ace, 
the Tigers' MVP was Willie Hernández. The Tigers traded John Wockenfuss 
and Glenn Wilson to the Phillies in March for Hernández and Dave Bergman. 
Hernández appeared in a team record 80 games for the 1984 Tigers and was 
virtually untouchable. He allowed 96 hits and only 6 home runs while throwing 
an incredible 140 1⁄3 innings out of the bullpen, and finished the season 
with a stellar 1.92 ERA. His Adjusted ERA+ of 204 is one of the highest 
in Detroit Tigers history. With 32 saves and 68 games finished, Hernandez 
won the Cy Young Award and was voted the American League's Most Valuable 
Player. His 32 saves came in 33 opportunities, his only blown save coming 
in late September after the Tigers had already secured the AL East Division 
title. Hernandez saved three post-season games, including the series-clinching 
games in both the ALCS and World Series. The popular Aurelio López, known 
as "Señor Smoke", also had a strong season as the Tigers #2 relief pitcher. 
Lopez finished the season with 41 games finished, a record of 10–1 and 
a 2.94 ERA. He also saved 14 games while pitching 137 2⁄3 innings. Lopez 
earned a win in Game 2 of the ALCS, tossing three scoreless innings as 
the Tigers won in 11 innings. Almost lost in the World Series Game 5 hitting 
heroics of Kirk Gibson was Lopez earning the win with 2 1⁄3 innings of 
scoreless relief, in which he didn't allow a baserunner. Darrell Evans 
was the Tigers' big free agent signing before the 1984 season. Though he 
had big years in 1985 (40 HRs, 94 RBIs) and 1987 (34 HRs, 99 RBIs), Evans 
struggled in his first year in the American League, batting .232 with 16 
home runs and 63 RBIs. In the 1984 World Series, Evans went 1-for-15 for 
an .067 batting average. The 1984 Tigers had several non-starters who made 
big contributions to the team's success. As a rookie in 1984, Bárbaro Garbey 
played in 110 games, including appearances at first base, second base, 
third base, DH, and each of the outfield positions. Garbey hit .287 and 
had more RBIs (52) than several starters, including Howard Johnson, Larry 
Herndon and Dave Bergman. Ruppert Jones was signed as a free agent one 
week into the season on April 10, 1984. He played in 79 games, mostly as 
a backup in left field. Jones contributed 12 home runs and 49 RBIs in only 
215 at-bats. His .516 slugging percentage was tied with Kirk Gibson for 
the team lead. Slick-fielding outfielder Rusty Kuntz played in 84 games, 
primarily as a late-inning defensive replacement, and hit .286 in 140 at-bats—easily 
the best offensive season of his major league career. The most popular 
of the role players was Marty Castillo. In 1984, Castillo appeared in 70 
games as a third baseman and backup catcher, and came through in the clutch 
at several key moments, including: scoring 3 runs to secure a win on August 
26; hitting a home run to beat the Yankees on September 23; collecting 
the game-winning, pennant clinching RBI in Game 3 of the ALCS, a 1–0 victory; 
catching the ball at third base for the final out of the ALCS; hitting 
.333 with a .455 on-base percentage and a .667 slugging percentage in the 
World Series; hitting a two-run home run in Game 3 of the World Series; 
and scoring in Game 5 when Kirk Gibson hit his 3-run home run off Goose 
Gossage. Detroit manager Sparky Anderson is fifth on the all-time list 
for manager career wins in Major League Baseball, and in 1984 he became 
the first manager to win the World Series while leading clubs in both leagues. 
He previously managed the Cincinnati Reds to the 1975 and 1976 championships, 
but the Reds inexplicably fired him after a second-place finish in the 
1978 season. Sparky kept a journal during the 1984 season, which was published 
under the title "Bless You Boys: Diary of the Detroit Tigers' 1984 Season". 
On the day the Tigers clinched the pennant, Sparky wrote in his journal: 
"I have to be honest. I've waited for this day since they fired me in Cincinnati. 
I think they made a big mistake when they did that. Now no one will ever 
question me again." [2] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]

an unprecedented start of 35–5. For the rest of the season, the team went 
69–53. There was a stretch in late July and August where the team went 
6–12. The Tigers finished with a 104–58 record, 15 games ahead of the second 
place Toronto Blue Jays. They outscored their opponents 829–643. The 1984

League Championship Series, three games to none. Detroit won the opening 
game 8–1. Jack Morris pitched 7 innings and allowed a single run, with 
Willie Hernández pitching the final 2 innings. Alan Trammell hit a triple 
and a home run for 3 RBIs, and Larry Herndon and Lance Parrish also hit 
home runs for Detroit. In Game 2, the Tigers won in extra innings 5–3. 
Kirk Gibson doubled to drive in Lou Whitaker in the 1st inning and hit 
a home run in the 3rd. Dan Petry pitched 7 innings and gave up 2 runs, 
but a rare blown save by Willie Hernández cost him a victory. Johnny Grubb 
hit a double off Dan Quisenberry in the 11th inning to drive in Darrell 
Evans and Ruppert Jones. Aurelio López held the Royals scoreless in the 
9th, 10th and 11th innings to earn the win. Game 3 was a pitching duel 
between Milt Wilcox and Charlie Leibrandt. Leibrandt pitched a complete 
game, allowing only 1 run and 3 hits, while Wilcox gave up 2 hits and struck 
out 8 Royals, with Hernández pitching the 9th inning for the save. Marty 
Castillo batted in Chet Lemon for the game's only run, as the Tigers completed 
a 3-game sweep and advanced to the World Series. Kirk Gibson was named 
the Most Valuable Player of the AL Championship Series. The Tigers beat 
the San Diego Padres in the 1984 World Series, winning the series 4 games 
to 1. In Game 1, the Padres led, 2–1, until Larry Herndon hit a 2-out, 
2-run home run in the 5th. Jack Morris did not allow another run in his 
complete-game effort, and the Tigers won, 3–2. The Padres evened the series 
in Game 2, on the strength of a Kurt Bevacqua 3-run homer off Dan Petry, 
as San Diego won its first (and to date only) World Series game. In Game 
3, the Tigers scored 4 runs in the 2nd inning, including 2 on a home run 
by Marty Castillo, en route to a 5–2 victory for Milt Wilcox. In Game 4, 
Alan Trammell hit a pair of 2-run home runs to account for all of Detroit's 
offense as the Tigers beat Eric Show, 4–2. Jack Morris got his 2nd Series 
victory and 2nd complete game. In Game 5, the Tigers scored 3 runs in the 
1st inning, but the Padres rallied to tie it in the 4th inning. In the 
8th, with Detroit leading 5–4, the Tigers got runners to 2nd and 3rd with 
1 out. Padres manager Dick Williams called on Goose Gossage to walk Kirk 
Gibson and set up a possible double play. Gossage talked Williams into 
letting him pitch to Gibson, and Gibson responded with a 3-run blast into 
the right-field upper deck. Detroit radio announcer Ernie Harwell called 
Gibson's home run on WJR radio as follows: Following the Tigers' victory 
in Game 5, the celebration by Detroit fans turned violent. A well known 
photograph taken outside Tiger Stadium shows a Tigers "fan" holding a World 
Series pennant in front of an overturned burning Detroit Police car. The 
image was printed in newspapers across the country, and became a symbol 
of Detroit's decline. One writer described the press reaction to the post-game 
violence as follows: Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg.
