Kenneth Lee McMullen (born June 1, 1942) is a former Major League Baseball 
third baseman. He batted and threw right-handed. McMullen signed with the 
Los Angeles Dodgers upon graduation from Oxnard High School.[1] After two 
minor league seasons in which he batted .285 with 42 home runs and 177 
runs batted in, McMullen made his major league debut as a September call-up 
in 1962 at just twenty years old. He collected three hits in eleven at-bats. 
He was awarded the starting third base job out of Spring training 1963, 
but after committing five errors while batting just .205 with one home 
run and three RBIs through April, he was optioned to triple A Spokane. 
After Manager Walter Alston shifted left fielder Tommy Davis to third,[2] 
and tried several other players at third base, McMullen was brought back 
up from Spokane at the end of June. His first major league home run was 
a grand slam off the St. Louis Cardinals' Ernie Broglio on the Fourth of 
July.[3] He raised his average to a far more respectable .236 by the end 
of the season while hitting five home runs with 28 RBIs. He pulled a hamstring 
on September 26 against the New York Mets, thereby missing the World Series 
against the New York Yankees.[4] He started the 1964 season with the Dodgers, 
but poor fielding and a .209 batting average landed him back with the Spokane 
Indians by the middle of June. At the end of the season, he was traded 
with Frank Howard, Phil Ortega and Pete Richert to the Washington Senators 
for John Kennedy and Claude Osteen.[5] McMullen won an everyday job batting 
second for Gil Hodges' Senators. Though he led the American League with 
22 errors in 1965, he soon earned a reputation as one of the slicker fielding 
third basemen in the AL. On August 13, 1965, he tied an AL record by starting 
four double plays against the Baltimore Orioles.[6] On September 26, 1966, 
he set an AL record with eleven assists from third against the Boston Red 
Sox (a mark later tied by Mike Ferraro).[7] He led AL third basemen in 
total chances over three seasons from 1967 to 1969, and led AL third basemen 
in double plays in 1967 and putouts in 1969. McMullen had his first career 
multi-home run game on July 16, 1967.[8] Later in the same month, he embarked 
on a career-high 19-game hit streak, which saw him hit a game-winning home 
run to end a twenty inning marathon with the Minnesota Twins on August 
9.[9] He batted a career-high .272 while driving in a career-high 87 runs 
in 1969. In all, clubbed 86 home runs and drove in 327 during five plus 
seasons with the Senators. Shortly into the 1970 season, he was dealt to 
the California Angels for Rick Reichardt and Aurelio Rodriguez.[10] After 
a subpar first season in California, McMullen rebounded in 1971 to hit 
a career-high 21 home runs. On July 17, 1971, McMullen scored from third 
on a sacrifice bunt by Bruce Christensen, giving his rookie teammate his 
first major league RBI. He had a 17-game hit streak from July 23 to August 
16, 1972. On November 28, 1972, McMullen was part of a blockbuster trade, 
as he and Andy Messersmith were sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Billy 
Grabarkewitz, Frank Robinson, Bill Singer, Mike Strahler and Bobby Valentine.[11] 
McMullen played the 1973 season opener at third base, but was soon displaced 
by rookie Ron Cey. From there, he served mostly as a pinch hitter, going 
six-for-nineteen with a walk, two home runs and nine RBIs in that role. 
He spent two more seasons backing up Cey and pinch hitting in Los Angeles, 
clubbing a pinch hit grand slam against the San Diego Padres on April 24, 
1975.[12] He was released during Spring training 1976, but soon afterwards 
caught on with the Oakland Athletics. He spent one season in Oakland, serving 
primarily as a designated hitter and pinch hitter. He spent his final season 
with the Milwaukee Brewers before retiring. He hit a pinch hit home run 
against the Seattle Mariners in his final career at bat.[13] Robbed of 
the opportunity to play in the 1963 World Series by an injury, McMullen 
returned to the post-season in the twilight of his career with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. In the 1974 National League Championship Series, he struck 
out against the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bruce Kison in his only post-season 
at-bat.[14] His wife, Bobbie, died of breast cancer on April 6, 1974.[15] 
They have three children. As of 2009, McMullen is a member of the Los Angeles 
Dodgers organization serving as a representative of the Dodgers Legend
