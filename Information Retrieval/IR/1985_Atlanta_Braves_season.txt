The 1985 Atlanta Braves season was the 115th season in franchise history. 
The Braves failed to qualify for the postseason for the third consecutive 
season. Joe Torre had managed the Braves to the 1982 National League West 
Division title, then to a second-place 1983 finish (three games from the 
division title). But his 1984 Braves fell below the .500 mark and 12 lengths 
behind the division-champion San Diego Padres. Torre was fired when the 
1984 campaign ended[3] and replaced by coach Eddie Haas, who had been a 
successful pilot in the Braves' farm system. But Haas' appointment did 
not rouse the 1985 Braves, who were at 50–71 (.413), in fifth place in 
the NL West and mired in a six-game losing streak when Haas was relieved 
of his duties August 25.[4] Haas' immediate successor, coach Bobby Wine, 
finished the season and compiled a 16–25 (.390) mark. During the offseason, 
the Braves would hire former Pittsburgh Pirates skipper Chuck Tanner as 
their 1986 manager. In addition to a new manager, the 1985 Braves had a 
new relief ace in Bruce Sutter. They also had slugger Bob Horner in the 
lineup and Dale Murphy was back as well. The Braves started the season 
4–1 but lost three consecutive games to the Reds at home to fall to .500. 
A 9–5 win over the Astros on Friday, April 19, gave the Braves a 5–4 record, 
good enough for second place, a half-game out. However, the Braves would 
not be above the .500 mark again. They lost three straight games to drop 
into fifth place with a 5–7 mark. Later, the Braves beat the Reds twice, 
8–4 and 17–9 to even their record at 10–10, and to climb within a game 
of first place. This was on May 1, and the Braves led the National League 
in runs scored. Things changed quickly, however. The Braves not only lost 
eight of their next ten games (May 3–14), they were also shut out four 
consecutive games (May 8–12). They were held to only one run in each of 
the two games that followed, one of which was a win. The 12–18 Braves were 
in last place, six games out. Atlanta improved to 16–19 and 4 1⁄2 games 
out of first following a 3–0 win over Chicago on May 19. The Braves then 
lost three straight to the Cardinals, the beginning of a 4–11 stretch that 
lowered their record to 20–30 on June 7. Atlanta was 10 1⁄2 games behind 
at that point and the Braves' situation was becoming precarious. They won 
their next three games by impressive margins, 7–3 and 10–3 over Los Angeles 
and 70 over San Francisco. By June 28, Atlanta was 33–38 and 9 1⁄2 games 
of first place. They were mired in fifth place, however. The Braves lost 
nine of their next 11 games and were 35–47 on July 10, in fifth place and 
12 games out. They swept the Philadelphia Phillies in four games just before 
the All-Star Break. Atlanta was 39–47 at the half, in fifth place and 9 
1⁄2 out. The Braves were 49–59 on August 11, in fifth place and 15 games 
out. It was basically over for the Braves, with no real chance at first 
place. Atlanta lost six in a row and were 16 games below the .500 mark, 
the first time since 1979. After a 6–3 win over San Diego halted the losing 
streak the Braves lost six straight again. At this point the Braves were 
50–71 and 22 games out of first, Haas was fired and Wine took the helm. 
The Braves won their first five games under the new manager. However, they 
fizzled out with an 11–25 finish that dropped them to 66–96 and 29 games 
out of first place. Thanks to the San Francisco Giants' even poorer performance, 
the Braves avoided last place and finished in fifth place, a position they 
had held for all but one day since May 15. Infielders Coaches With Tanner's 
hiring, Braves' owner Ted Turner had employed four different managers in 
the period of 13 months. But Turner made a more momentous change in his 
executive offices on October 22, 1985, when he replaced general manager 
John Mullen, on the job since Bill Lucas' sudden death in May 1979, with 
former Atlanta field manager Bobby Cox, who had just piloted the Toronto 
Blue Jays to the 1985 American League East Division pennant. As general 
manager, Cox began a long rebuilding process that would last five seasons, 
and see Cox draft, develop or acquire players like Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, 
Chipper Jones, David Justice and Steve Avery. But the continued struggles 
of the Braves on the field would result in Cox' return to uniform as Atlanta's 
field manager on June 23, 1990. Although the Braves continued their losing 
ways, going only 40–57 (.412) under Cox in 1990, they were poised to break 
into sustained contention in 1991, with 14 division titles in 15 seasons, 
five National League championships and the 1995 World Series title. Cox 
would enter the Baseball Hall of Fame on the strength of his successful 
managerial career, which ended with his 2010 retirement. Note: Pos = Position;
