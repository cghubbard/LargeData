Edward Tilden Siever (April 2, 1875 – February 4, 1920) was an American 
baseball pitcher. He played professional baseball for 12 seasons from 1899 
to 1910, including seven years in Major League Baseball with the Detroit 
Tigers (1901–1902, 1906–1908) and St. Louis Browns (1903–1904). He led 
the American League with a 1.91 earned run average (ERA) in 1902. In seven 
major league seasons, Siever compiled an 83–83 Win–loss record with a 2.60 
ERA and 470 strikeouts in 1,507 innings pitched. Siever was born in Goddard, 
Kansas, in 1875.[1] Siever began his professional baseball career with 
the London Cockneys in 1899 and 1900.[2] He compiled a 14-8 record in 1899 
and helped lead the Cockneys to the Canadian League pennant.[3] In 1900, 
he joined the Detroit Tigers, then a minor league club, compiling a 6-5 
record with a 3.97 earned run average (ERA).[2] He was described by a writer 
in the Detroit Free Press as having "a great pitching arm and a physique 
as strong as a young lion."[3] In 1901, the American League became a major 
league. In the Tigers' inaugural season as a major league club, Siever 
and Roscoe Miller were the team's leading pitchers. Siever appeared in 
38 games, 33 as a starter, compiled an 18-14 record and a 3.24 ERA with 
30 complete games and 85 strikeouts in 288-2/3 innings pitched.[1] In 1902, 
Siever led the American League with a 1.91 ERA, and his Adjusted ERA+ of 
195 remains the second best in Tigers history for a pitcher with more than 
150 innings pitched. However, the 1902 Tigers lacked hitting and finished 
in seventh place. Despite his 1.91 ERA, Siever compiled an 8-11 record 
in 1902.[1] On August 11, 1902, Siever and Rube Waddell engaged in a pitching 
duel that held both sides scorless through 12 innings. Waddell hit a triple 
off Siever in the 13th inning to drive in the game's only run.[4] Siever 
suffered from arm strain after the pitching duel with Waddell and was only 
able to pitch in two more games that season. According to one account, 
"His arm was in bad condition owing to strain, the results of that famous 
battle."[3] In December 1902, contract negotiations between the Tigers 
and Siever broke down over money.[5] In the end, Siever was sold to the 
St. Louis Browns.[3] In 1903, he compiled a record of 13-14 with a 2.48 
ERA in 254 innings pitched. The following year, he had a 10-15 record 2.65 
ERA in 29 games with the Browns.[1] In January 1905, the Browns released 
Siever to the Indianapolis Indians in the minor leagues.[6] He ended up 
with the Minneapolis Millers and, with his arm in "perfect working order,"[3] 
compiled a 23-11 record with a 2.74 ERA in 35 games for the Millers.[2] 
In February 1906, Siever signed with the Detroit Tigers.[7] He appeared 
in 30 games for the 1906 Tigers and compiled a 14-11 record and 2.71 ERA 
in 222-2/3 innings pitched.[1] The following year, Siever compiled an 18-11 
for the 1907 Tigers team that went 92-58 and lost to the Chicago Cubs in 
the 1907 World Series. Siever's 2.16 ERA ranked 10th in the American League 
in 1907.[1] Siever started one game in the 1907 World Series and gave up 
two earned runs in four innings pitched.[1] The Detroit Free Press later 
called 1907 season "the zenith of his career" and described a change in 
strategy in Siever's approach to the game: "While control and speed were 
'Eddie's' best assets in his early career, in later years he resorted to 
the use of a slow ball, by using it in conjunction with a ball that burned 
its way plateward, he got away with many sensational victories."[3] In 
his final major league season, he compiled a 2-6 record for the 1907 Tigers.[1] 
During his seven years in the major leagues, Siever compiled an 83–83 record 
with a 2.60 ERA and 470 strikeouts in 1,507 innings pitched.[1] Although 
his major league career ended in 1908, he pitched for two additional years 
in the minor leagues with Aberdeen and Grays Harbor in 1909 and Chattanooga 
in 1910.[2][3] After retiring from professional baseball, Siever continued 
to play amateur baseball in a Detroit Masonic league until he was badly 
injured in a fall. Siever was employed by the Board of Water Commissioners. 
He was married and had three sons with his wife, Charlotte. Siever died 
suddenly in 1920 at age 44. The cause of death was believed to be heart
