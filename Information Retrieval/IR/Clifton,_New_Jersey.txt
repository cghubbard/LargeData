Manager Law. The government consists of a City Council comprising seven 
council members, with all positions elected at large in nonpartisan elections 
to four-terms of office on a concurrent basis. The mayor is chosen by the 
City Council, with the position usually given to the top vote getter in 
the previous election.[8] Clifton's municipal elections are held in even 
numbered years, and had been held in May as required for municipalities 
conducting nonpartisan elections. Following the passage of a state law 
in 2010 allowing nonpartisan elections to be shifted to November, Clifton 
voters were overwhelmingly in favor of the move in a non-binding referendum 
held in November 2013. On December 13, 2013, the Clifton City Council voted 
6-0, with one abstention, to make the move to a November election binding, 
which had the effect of extending the terms of all sitting council members 
by six months, from June 30 to December 31. Officials cited increased voter 
participation and reduced costs as the justifications behind supporting 
the shift.[39] As of 2016[update], Clifton's mayor is James Anzaldi, whose 
term of office ends December 31, 2018. Anzaldi had been a member of the 
City Council since 1978 and was first selected to be Mayor in 1990, succeeding 
two-term Mayor Gloria Kolodziej. Anzaldi is the first mayor in Clifton's 
history to be elected to six terms.[40] Members of the City Council are 
Peter C. Eagler, William "Bill" Gibson, Raymond Grabowski (elected to serve 
an unexpired term), Steven Hatala Jr., Joseph C. Kolodziej and Lauren E. 
Murphy, all of whom are serving concurrent terms of office that end on 
December 31, 2018.[4][41][42][43][44] In March 2015, the City Council appointed 
Joseph Cupoli, the eighth-place finisher in the 2014 election, to fill 
the vacant seat of Matthew Grabowski, who had died in office the previous 
month.[45] In the November 2015 General Election, Raymond Grabowski was 
elected to serve the balance of his brother's unexpired term of office, 
and was sworn into office after the election results were certified.[43][46] 
If a vacancy occurs at any time in the term, a special election is held 
in November of the year the seat became vacant unless it is a council election 
year. Since 1990, Clifton has called special elections to fill council 
seats three times.[47] In 1992, councilman George Bayeux died and Richard 
Stockinger was elected to replace him.[48] The next special election came 
in 1996 when Stockinger himself died of lung cancer, with Edward M. Welsh 
elected to fill his seat.[49] In 2006, just before the new council was 
to be sworn in, Antonio Latona was disqualified from taking his seat due 
to a conflict of interest involving his work for the Clifton Fire Department 
and eighth-place vote getter Matt Ward was temporarily appointed to the 
council in Latona's place.[50] Ward ran for his seat in the subsequent 
special election called for November 2007 and won the balance of the term.[51]

basis, with two or three seats coming up for election each year as part 
of the November general election in a three-year cycle. At a reorganization 
meeting held in January, the board selects a Director and Deputy Director 
from among its members to serve for a one-year term.[63] As of 2015[update],
