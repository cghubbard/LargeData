Elmer John Smith (September 21, 1892 – August 3, 1984) born in Sandusky, 
Ohio was an outfielder for the Cleveland Indians (1914–16, 1917 and 1919–21), 
Washington Senators (1916–17), Boston Red Sox (1922), New York Yankees 
(1922–23) and Cincinnati Reds (1925). His World War I draft registration 
card shows that he was born in 1893 not 1892. But the information is not

shows a birth year of 1892. He helped the Indians win the 1920 World Series 
and the Yankees win the 1922 American League Pennant and 1923 World Series.
