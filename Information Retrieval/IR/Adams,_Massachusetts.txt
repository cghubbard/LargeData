Adams is a town in northern Berkshire County, Massachusetts, United States. 
It is part of the Pittsfield, Massachusetts Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
The population was 8,485 at the 2010 census.[1] Nathan Jones purchased 
the township of East Hoosac at auction in 1762 from the state for £3,200. 
In 1778, the town was officially incorporated as Adams, named in honor 
of Samuel Adams, a revolutionary leader and signer of the Declaration of 
Independence. Much of the land had been subdivided into 100-acre (0.40 km2) 
and 200-acre (0.81 km2) lots. These were mostly farms with frontage on 
the Hoosic River, which over time would provide water power for woolen, 
cotton, lumber, and plastic mills. First settled in 1745, North Adams was 
originally part of Adams until the town split in 1878. Although there has 
never been a town of South Adams, the name was used prior to 1878 to specify 
the southern part of the town that had long had two primary centers, and 
survives in the name of the South Adams Savings Bank, which was incorporated 
in 1869. Early settlers in the 1760s included a group of Quakers, many 
of whom came together from Smithfield, Rhode Island. The Quaker civil rights 
leader, abolitionist, and suffragist Susan B. Anthony was born in Adams, 
and her childhood home is today a museum. The town's population declined 
from 1810 to 1820 as farmers moved west for better soil. But the War of 
1812 allowed the textile industry to gain a foothold in the United States 
because British textiles were no longer available. In 1814, the Adams South 
Village Cotton Manufacture Company opened. With the establishment of a 
number of mills on the Hoosic River, Adams' population more than doubled 
to 4,000 between 1820 and 1835. Growth in both halves of Adams was further 
propelled by the opening of the Hoosac Tunnel in 1875. In the late 1800s, 
during the expansion of the cotton mills, the downtown was further urbanised 
by the construction of four large brick buildings on Park Street - P. J. 
Barrett Block, Jones Block, Armory Block, and the Mausert Block, opposite 
the Town Hall. President William McKinley made two visits to the town, 
the second in 1897 to lay the cornerstone of the Adams Free Library. He 
was a friend of the Plunkett brothers (founders in 1889 of the Berkshire 
Cotton Manufacturing Company), and of the textile industry generally. In 
1903, the assassinated president was honored with a larger-than-life statue 
beside the library. Berkshire Cotton later became a major part of Berkshire 
Hathaway, whose large factory in Adams was closed in 1958 (the 1,000 lost 
jobs were not the fault of Warren Buffett, who did not take over the firm 
until 1965). The mill town's only major remaining mill, Specialty Minerals, 
mines and processes limestone for calcium carbonate, used in antacids and 
food supplements, as well as paper whiteners and other industrial purposes. 
The town's more recent move toward tourism, part of a broader trend in 
the Berkshires, is primarily centered on its natural beauty and outdoor 
activities, and on its proximity to the galleries, museums and colleges 
of North Adams. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town 
has a total area of 23.0 square miles (59.5 km2), of which 22.9 square 
miles (59.3 km2) is land and 0.077 square miles (0.2 km2), or 0.33%, is 
water.[1] The town lies along the valley surrounding the Hoosic River and 
its tributary brooks. Set between the Taconic Range to the west and the 
Hoosac Range of the Berkshires to the east, Adams includes the summit of 
Mount Greylock, elevation 3,491 feet (1,064 m) above sea level. The mountain, 
located within the state reservation of the same name, is the highest point 
in Massachusetts, a waypoint on the Appalachian Trail, and in the 19th-century 
inspired writers including Herman Melville. The town also includes a corner 
of Savoy Mountain State Park. Adams is bordered to the north by North Adams, 
to the east by Florida and Savoy, to the south by Savoy and Cheshire, and 
to the west by New Ashford and Williamstown. Massachusetts Route 8 is the 
primary north-south road through town, and was originally signed as New 
England Interstate Route 8, which extended southward to Bridgeport, Connecticut. 
The town is the northern terminus of Route 116, which extends southeast 
to Springfield. Freight rail once ran through the town, but is now mostly 
converted to the paved Ashuwillticook Rail Trail. The town lies along the 
northern route of the Berkshire Regional Transit Authority. Regional bus 
service can be found in North Adams, as can regional air service at Harriman-and-West 
Airport. The nearest airport with international flights is Albany International 
Airport in New York. See also: Adams (CDP), Massachusetts As of the census[12]
