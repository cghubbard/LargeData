Philip Francis "Phil" Rizzuto (September 25, 1917 – August 13, 2007), nicknamed 
"The Scooter", was an American Major League Baseball shortstop. He spent 
his entire 13-year baseball career with the New York Yankees (1941–1956), 
and was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994. A popular 
figure on a team dynasty which captured 10 AL titles and seven World Championships 
in his 13 seasons, Rizzuto holds numerous World Series records for shortstops. 
His best statistical season was 1950, when he was named the American League's 
Most Valuable Player. Despite this offensive peak, Rizzuto was a classic 
"small ball" player, noted for his strong defense in the infield. The slick-fielding 
Rizzuto is also regarded as one of the best bunters in baseball history. 
When he retired, his 1,217 career double plays ranked second in major league 
history, trailing only Luke Appling's total of 1,424, and his .968 career 
fielding average trailed only Lou Boudreau's mark of .973 among AL shortstops. 
After his playing career, Rizzuto enjoyed a 40-year career as a radio and 
television sports announcer for the Yankees. His idiosyncratic style and 
unpredictable digressions charmed listeners, while his lively play-by-play 
brought a distinct energy to his broadcasts. He was well known for his 
trademark expression, "Holy Cow!".[1] Rizzuto was born on September 25, 
1917 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a streetcar motorman. There has 
been confusion about his year of birth, stemming from Rizzuto's "shaving 
a year off" the date at the beginning of his pro career, on the advice 
of teammates. Throughout his career, his birth year was reported as 1918 
in both The Sporting News Baseball Register and the American League Red 
Book; later reference sources revised the year to 1917, indicating his 
age at the time of his death to be 89. After Rizzuto's death, the New York 
Post broke a story reporting Rizzuto's actual year of birth as 1916.[2] 
However, it was subsequently reported that the New York City Department 
of Health said Rizzuto's official birth certificate is, in fact, dated 
1917.[2] Despite his modest size—usually listed during his playing career 
as five feet, six inches tall and either 150 or 160 pounds, though he rarely 
reached even the lower figure[3]—Rizzuto played baseball as well as football 
at Richmond Hill High School, Queens, New York.[4] Rizzuto was signed by 
the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1937. His nickname, at 
times attributed to Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen, was actually bestowed 
on Rizzuto (according to him) by minor league teammate Billy Hitchcock 
because of the way Rizzuto ran the bases. After being named the Minor League 
Player of the Year by The Sporting News in 1940 while playing with the 
Kansas City Blues, he played his first major league game on April 14, 1941. 
Taking over for the well-liked Frank Crosetti, whose batting average had 
dropped to .194 after several strong seasons, Rizzuto quickly fit into 
the Yankees lineup to form an outstanding middle infield with second baseman 
Joe Gordon. In his syndicated column on October 1, Grantland Rice compared 
the pair favorably to the middle infield of the crosstown Brooklyn Dodgers: 
"Billy Herman and Pee Wee Reese around the highly important keystone spot 
don't measure up, over a season anyway, with Joe Gordon and Phil Rizzuto, 
a pair of light-footed, quick-handed operatives who can turn seeming base 
hits into double plays often enough to save many a close scrap."[5] Rizzuto's 
rookie season ended in the World Series, and though he hit poorly, the 
Yankees beat the Dodgers. The following year, Rizzuto led all hitters, 
for both the Yankees and the opposing St. Louis Cardinals, with 8 hits 
and a .381 average in the 1942 World Series; the light-hitting shortstop 
even added a home run after hitting just 4 in the regular season. Like 
many players of the era, his career was interrupted by a stint in the United 
States Navy during World War II. From 1943 through 1945, he played on a 
Navy baseball team alongside Dodgers shortstop Reese; the team was managed 
by Yankees catcher Bill Dickey. In 1947 Rizzuto recorded a .969 fielding 
average, breaking Crosetti's 1939 team record for shortstops of .968. He 
broke his own record the following year with a .973 mark. Shortly after 
Rizzuto's return to the Yankees for the 1946 season, he attracted the ire 
of new Yankees general manager, president, and co-owner Larry MacPhail, 
former president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. MacPhail 
had served in both World Wars, was hard-drinking, tempestuous, and often 
paranoid, but as a baseball executive was innovative and considered a near-genius 
despite being hobbled by alcohol and a volatile temper.[6] In 1946 MacPhail 
became aware that Mexican millionaire and ball club owner Jorge Pasquel, 
just named president of the Mexican League and who with his wealthy 2 brothers 
had poached American players from the Negro League since 1943, was now 
courting Major League men. Several clubs lost players with others mentioned 
including the Yankees, and Phil Rizzuto was rumored to be considering a 
$100,000, 3-year contract. For that matter, a number of players on various 
teams had begun "moonlighting" in winter playing for Cuban teams. The disarray 
had to end. Baseball Commissioner Albert Happy Chandler, former Kentucky 
governor, announced on Opening Day that exclusivity clauses still ruled—all 
contract-jumping players heading to Mexico or Cuba would be suspended from 
the Major League for 5 years.[7] The New York Herald Tribune sent one of 
its star sportswriters, Rutherford "Rud" Rennie, down to Mexico to see 
what was up with the invigorated Mexican League and the ambitious Pasquel 
Brothers. By that time they had hired a trio of Mariachi musicians wearing 
sombreros to play outside at least one American stadium. The Trib's Rennie 
sent several dispatches from Mexico, liking some things about the scene 
but disliking others. Rennie, who had covered the Yankees since the Roaring 
Twenties, was soon astounded when MacPhail sued the Mexican Baseball League 
and the restraining order named Rud Rennie as an "agent" of the foreigners. 
Court papers alleged that he had "been seen" in the Yankees locker room 
talking with his good friend Phil Rizzuto and other players and advocating 
contract-jumping.[8] Hours later, the Dodgers and Giants owners hastened 
into court also; their teams were among the 10 who had actually lost a 
combined number of 23 players that season.[9] The situation was hardly 
helped when retired Yankees slugger-hero Babe Ruth took his family on an 
extended Mexican vacation as guest of the Pasquels, and new rumors flew 
that Ruth was being wooed for a Mexican club manager's job.[10] The lawsuits 
soon moved to the US Supreme Court, but the Yankees' MacPhail saw he had 
overreacted in pushing a restraining order on Rennie for merely covering 
the news and maintaining good relationships with Rizzuto and teammates; 
the order was dropped,[11] avoiding a potential first amendment fracas 
for Larry MacPhail, who would be edged out in a year.[12] Perhaps at least 
partially caused by the court action and negative attention, the Yankees 
finished third in 1946 and Rizzuto's average went down to .257.[13] By 
1947, Commissioner Chandler let Americans return to their home clubs with 
no penalty.[14] And In 1947 the increasingly valued Rizzuto recorded a 
.969 fielding average, breaking Crosetti's 1939 team record for shortstops 
of .968. He broke his own record the following year with a .973 mark. Rizzuto's 
peak as a player was 1949-50, when he was moved into the leadoff spot. 
In 1950, his MVP season, he hit .324 with 200 hits and 92 walks, and scored 
125 runs. While leading the league in fielding percentage, Rizzuto handled 
238 consecutive chances without an error, setting the single-season record 
for shortstops.[15] From September 18, 1949 through June 7, 1950, he played 
58 games at shortstop without an error, breaking the AL record of 46 set 
by Eddie Joost in 1947-48; the record stood until Ed Brinkman played error-free 
for 72 games in 1972. Rizzuto recorded 123 double plays in 1950, three 
more than Crosetti's total from 1938; it remains the Yankee record. Rizzuto's 
1950 fielding percentage of .9817 led the league, and came within less 
than a point of Lou Boudreau's league record of .9824, set in 1947. Rizzuto's 
mark was a franchise record until 1976, when Yankees shortstop Fred Stanley 
posted a mark of .983.[citation needed] Rizzuto was voted the American 
League's Most Valuable Player by a large margin in 1950, after having been 
the runner-up for the award behind Ted Williams in 1949. He became the 
only MVP in history who led the league in sacrifice bunts. Rizzuto played 
in five All-Star Games, in 1942 and each year from 1950 to 1953. In 1950, 
he also won the Hickok Belt, awarded to the top professional athlete of 
the year, and was named Major League Player of the Year by The Sporting 
News. He was voted top major league shortstop by The Sporting News four 
consecutive years (1949–52).[citation needed] Rizzuto batted .320 in the 
1951 World Series, for which the New York chapter of the BBWAA later voted 
him the Babe Ruth Award as the Series' top player. Decades later, Rizzuto 
still spoke resentfully of the incident in which pugnacious New York Giants 
second baseman Eddie Stanky sparked a rally by kicking the ball out of 
Rizzuto's glove on a tag play. Ty Cobb named Rizzuto and Stan Musial as 
"two of the few modern ball players who could hold their own among old 
timers." Yankees manager Casey Stengel had famously dismissed Rizzuto during 
that Brooklyn Dodgers tryout in 1935 when Stengel was managing that team, 
advising him to "go get a shoeshine box." But Stengel ended up managing 
Rizzuto during five consecutive championship seasons, and would later say, 
"He is the greatest shortstop I have ever seen in my entire baseball career, 
and I have watched some beauties." During his heyday, Yankees pitcher Vic 
Raschi noted, "My best pitch is anything the batter grounds, lines or pops 
in the direction of Rizzuto." Decades into his retirement, teammate Joe 
DiMaggio characterized Rizzuto's enduring appeal to fans: "People loved 
watching me play baseball. Scooter, they just loved."[16] Rizzuto was noted 
for "small ball", strong defense, and clutch hitting, which helped the 
Yankees win seven World Series. As an offensive player, he is particularly 
regarded as one of the best bunters of his era; he led the AL in sacrifice 
hits every season from 1949 to 1952. In retirement, he often tutored players 
on the bunt during spring training. In the announcing booth, Rizzuto talked 
about the several different kinds of bunts he would use in different situations. 
Later during his broadcasting career, he occasionally expressed disappointment 
that the art of bunting had largely been lost in baseball. Rizzuto was 
among the AL's top five players in stolen bases seven times. Defensively, 
he led the league three times each in double plays and total chances per 
game, twice each in fielding and putouts, and once in assists. Rizzuto 
ranks among the top ten players in several World Series categories, including 
games, hits, walks, runs, and steals. Three times during his career, the 
Yankees played until Game Seven of the World Series; Rizzuto batted .455 
in those three games (1947, 1952, 1955). In Rizzuto's obituary, The New 
York Times recalled a play that had occurred on September 17, 1951, with 
the Yankees and Cleveland Indians tied for first place and just 12 games 
left in the season: As the winning run scored, Lemon angrily threw both 
the ball and his pitching glove into the stands. Rizzuto was released by 
the Yankees on August 25, 1956. Rizzuto often talked about the unusual 
circumstances of his release. Late in the 1956 season, the Yankees re-acquired 
Enos Slaughter, who had been with the team in 1954–55, and asked Rizzuto 
to meet with the front office to discuss adjustments to the upcoming postseason 
roster. They then asked Rizzuto to look over the list of Yankee players 
and suggest which ones might be cut to make room for Slaughter. For each 
name Rizzuto mentioned, a reason was given as to why that player needed 
to be kept. Finally, Rizzuto realized that the expendable name was his 
own. He called former teammate George Stirnweiss, who told him to refrain 
from "blasting" the Yankees because it might cost him a non-playing job 
later. Rizzuto said many times that following Stirnweiss' advice was probably 
the best move he ever made.[citation needed] When he retired, his 1,217 
career double plays ranked second in major league history, trailing only 
Luke Appling's total of 1,424, and his .968 career fielding average trailed 
only Lou Boudreau's mark of .973 among AL shortstops. He also ranked fifth 
in AL history in games at shortstop (1,647), eighth in putouts (3,219) 
and total chances (8,148), and ninth in assists (4,666). At the time of 
his last game, he had also appeared in the most World Series games ever 
(52), a record soon surpassed by five of his Yankees teammates. Rizzuto 
still holds numerous World Series records for shortstops, including the 
most career games played, singles, walks, times on base, stolen bases, 
at-bats, putouts, assists and double plays. Rizzuto married Cora Anne Ellenborn 
on June 23, 1943; the two first met the previous year when Rizzuto substituted 
for Joe DiMaggio as a speaker at a Newark communion breakfast. "I fell 
in love so hard I didn't go home", Rizzuto recalled. He rented a nearby 
hotel room for a month to be near her. The Rizzutos moved to Hillside, 
New Jersey, in 1950, to a home on Windsor Way. With later financial successes, 
they moved to a Tudor home on Westminster Avenue, where they lived for 
many years. During his playing days, Rizzuto (along with several other 
big leaguers) would work in the off season at the American Shops off U.S. 
Route 22 near Bayonne, New Jersey. At a charity event in 1951, Rizzuto 
met a young blind boy named Ed Lucas, who had lost his sight when he was 
struck by a baseball between the eyes on the same day as Bobby Thomson's 
"Shot Heard 'Round the World." Rizzuto took an interest in the boy and 
his school, St. Joseph's School for the Blind. Until his death, Rizzuto 
raised millions for St. Joseph's by donating profits from his commercials 
and books, and also by hosting the Annual Phil Rizzuto Celebrity Golf Classic 
and "Scooter" Awards. Rizzuto and Lucas remained friendly, and it was through 
the Yankee broadcaster's influence that Lucas's 2006 wedding was the only 
one ever conducted at Yankee Stadium. Lucas was one of Rizzuto's last visitors 
at his nursing home, days before his death. Rizzuto had options following 
his release by the Yankees, including a player contract from the Cardinals 
and a minor league offer from the Dodgers. But Rizzuto, who had filled 
in for the New York Giants' wraparound host Frankie Frisch in September 
1956 following Frisch's heart attack, received a favorable response. With 
his eye on a post-playing career, Rizzuto submitted an audition tape to 
the Baltimore Orioles. The Yankees' sponsor, Ballantine Beer, took notice, 
and insisted that the team hire Rizzuto as an announcer for the 1957 season. 
General manager George Weiss was obliged to fire Jim Woods, who had only 
been with the Yankees for one year, to make room for Rizzuto in the booth. 
When Weiss told Woods he was out in favor of Rizzuto, he said that it was 
the first time he had had to fire someone for no reason. Rizzuto broadcast 
Yankee games on radio and television for the next 40 years. His popular 
catchphrase was "Holy cow." Rizzuto also became known for saying "Unbelievable!" 
or "Did you see that?" to describe a great play, and would call somebody 
a "huckleberry" if he did something Rizzuto did not like. He would frequently 
wish listeners a happy birthday or anniversary, send get-well wishes to 
fans in hospitals, and speak well of restaurants he liked, or of the cannoli 
he ate between innings. He also joked about leaving the game early, saying 
to his wife, "I'll be home soon, Cora!" and "I gotta get over that bridge", 
referring to the nearby George Washington Bridge, which he would use to 
get back to his home in Hillside. In later years, Rizzuto would announce 
the first six innings of Yankee games; the TV director would sometimes 
puckishly show a shot of the bridge (which can be seen from the top of 
Yankee Stadium) after Rizzuto had departed. Rizzuto was also very phobic 
about lightning, and sometimes left the booth following violent thunderclaps. 
Rizzuto started his broadcasting career working alongside Mel Allen and 
Red Barber in 1957. Among a number of announcers that Rizzuto worked with 
over the course of his career, Frank Messer (1968–1985) and Bill White 
(1971–1988) were the two most memorable. Rizzuto, Messer, and White were 
the main broadcast trio that presided over an important time period for 
the Yankees, which spanned from the non-winning CBS years through the championship 
seasons and other years of struggle during the Steinbrenner era. On television, 
for example, the Yankees broadcast team went unchanged from 1972-82. Rizzuto 
was twice assigned to broadcast the World Series while with the Yankees. 
He worked the 1964 series on radio with Joe Garagiola when the Yankees 
faced the Cardinals. The next time the Yankees made it into the series, 
in 1976, Rizzuto joined Garagiola and Tony Kubek as part of the series 
coverage on NBC-TV. The 1976 World Series was the last to have a local 
voice from each of the two teams as part of its announcing team. WPIX and 
its usual Rizzuto-Messer-White broadcast trifecta carried the ALCS in 1976, 
1977, 1978, 1980 and 1981, providing metropolitan area viewers a local 
alternative to the nationally-broadcast telecasts.[citation needed] Rizzuto 
would typically refer to his broadcast partners by their last names, calling 
them "White", "Murcer" and "Seaver" instead of "Bill", "Bobby" or "Tom." 
Reportedly, he did the same with teammates during his playing days. Rizzuto 
developed a reputation as a "homer", an announcer who would sometimes lapse 
into rooting for the home team. As an announcer, Rizzuto devised the unique 
scoring notation "WW" for his scorecard; it stood for "Wasn't Watching." 
Rizzuto's most significant moments as a broadcaster included the new single-season 
home run record set by Roger Maris on October 1, 1961, which he called 
on WCBS radio: Rizzuto also called the pennant-winning home run hit by 
Chris Chambliss in the American League Championship Series on October 14, 
1976, on WPIX-TV: "He hits one deep to right-center! That ball is out of 
here! The Yankees win the pennant! Holy cow, Chris Chambliss on one swing!" 
[As fans poured onto the field, tearing it up for souvenirs] "And the Yankees 
win the American League pennant. Unbelievable, what a finish! As dramatic 
a finish as you'd ever want to see! With all that delay, we told you Littell 
(Mark Littell, the Royals' reliever who gave up the homer) had to be a 
little upset. And holy cow, Chambliss hits one over the fence, he is being 
mobbed by the fans, and this field will never be the same, but the Yankees 
have won it in the bottom of the 9th, seven to six!" Rizzuto was also on 
the mic for the one-game playoff that decided the dramatic 1978 AL East 
race between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, the Pine Tar game involving 
George Brett in 1983, and Phil Niekro's 300th career win in 1985. Malapropisms 
and stream-of-consciousness commentary were fairly common for Rizzuto, 
which annoyed his critics but amused his fans: As Dave Righetti hurled 
his no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox on July 4, 1983 at Yankee Stadium, 
Rizzuto—broadcasting on WABC radio—described the video of a close play 
as if his listeners could see it. Partner Frank Messer gently jogged the 
Scooter's memory by quipping "Which side of the radio are we looking at?" 
(To be fair, Rizzuto and Messer alternated that day between WABC radio, 
TV's SportsChannel (now MSG Plus) and the Fan Appreciation giveaways on 
the field.) During the openings to two separate telecasts, Rizzuto began 
by reading off a teleprompter, "Welcome to New York Yankee Baseball. I'm 
Bill White... wait a minute." Both times, this caused White, standing to 
Rizzuto's left, to burst out in laughter. On another occasion, Rizzuto 
introduced the team as "Bill Rizzuto" and "Phil White." Rizzuto's relationships 
with White and Fran Healy (the latter first worked with Rizzuto on radio) 
produced some good-humored exchanges, including one with White during the 
WPIX telecast of the American League Eastern Division title game on October 
2, 1978. Red Sox batter Bob (Beetle) Bailey, who had gained a little weight, 
had just stepped into the batter's box: On another occasion, at a 1978 
game at Comiskey Park, Healy impishly introduced Rizzuto's return to the 
broadcast booth by saying, "And back from the men's room, Phil Rizzuto" 
leading to the following exchange: One broadcast, while still on WPIX channel 
11, after a commercial break a shot of the full moon appeared on the screen. 
Rizzutto, in his clever way quipped, "Look, you can see Texas!" Not all 
of Rizzuto's broadcasting experiences were jovial. On the evening of the 
funeral of former teammate Mickey Mantle (August 15, 1995 in Dallas, Texas), 
the Yankees were set to play a road game against the Boston Red Sox. Rizzuto 
understandably assumed that he would be allowed to miss the game to attend 
the funeral with former teammates, but was scheduled to call the game. 
WPIX and/or the Yankees refused to let him go, citing that "someone needed 
to do the color commentary." Rizzuto eventually gave into emotion and abruptly 
left the booth in the middle of the telecast saying he could not go on. 
Rizzuto announced his retirement from announcing soon afterwards, which 
many attributed to the incident. He was eventually persuaded to return 
for one more season in 1996[18] where he called another Yankee shortstop 
protégé, Derek Jeter's first home run. When he retired that season, he 
had spent parts of seven decades—virtually all of his adult life—in the 
Yankee organization as a minor league player, major league player and broadcaster. 
Although Mel Allen is to this day identified as "The Voice of the Yankees", 
Rizzuto was the longest serving broadcaster in the history of the club; 
he called Yankees games for 40 years to Allen's 35. See List of New York 
Yankees broadcasters The Yankees retired Rizzuto's number 10 in a ceremony 
at Yankee Stadium on August 4, 1985. During this ceremony, he was also 
given a plaque to be placed in the stadium's Monument Park. The plaque 
makes reference to the fact that he "has enjoyed two outstanding careers, 
all-time Yankee shortstop, one of the great Yankee broadcasters." Humorously, 
Rizzuto was accidentally bumped to the ground during his own ceremony, 
by a live cow wearing a halo (that is, a "holy cow"); both honoree and 
cow were unhurt. Rizzuto later described the encounter: "That big thing 
stepped right on my shoe and pushed me backwards, like a karate move." 
In that day's game, future broadcast partner Tom Seaver recorded his 300th 
career victory. Most baseball observers, including Rizzuto himself, came 
to believe that Derek Jeter had surpassed him as the greatest shortstop 
in Yankees history. The Scooter paid tribute to his heir apparent during 
the 2001 postseason at Yankee Stadium; jogging back to the Yankee dugout, 
he flipped the ceremonial baseball backhand, imitating Jeter's celebrated 
game-saving throw to home plate that had just occurred during the Yankees' 
2001 American League Division Series triumph. ESPN reported that the photo 
of Jeter and Rizzuto taken that evening is one of Jeter's most prized possessions. 
In the spring of 1957, following Rizzuto's release, Baltimore Orioles manager 
Paul Richards said, "Among those shortstops whom I have had the good fortune 
to see in action, it's got to be Rizzuto on top for career achievement. 
For a five-year period, I would have to take Lou Boudreau. ... But, year 
after year, season after season, Rizzuto was a standout." Sportswriter 
Dan Daniel wrote at the time, "It seems to me that Rizzuto must be included 
among the few players of the past five years who may look forward to ultimate 
election to the Hall of Fame." [3] However, Daniel's assessment did not 
come to pass for over 35 years. Rizzuto was elected to the Hall of Fame 
along with Leo Durocher (who was selected posthumously), in 1994 by the 
Veterans Committee, following a long campaign for Rizzuto's election by 
Yankee fans who were frustrated that he had not received the honor. Some 
of Rizzuto's peers supported his candidacy, including Boston's Ted Williams. 
Williams once claimed that his Red Sox would have won most of the Yankees' 
1940s and 1950s pennants if they had had Rizzuto at shortstop,[19] but 
Rizzuto himself was more modest: "My stats don't shout. They kind of whisper."[20] 
The push for Rizzuto became especially acute after 1984, when the committee 
elected Pee Wee Reese, the similarly-regarded shortstop of the crosstown 
Brooklyn Dodgers. Bill James later used Rizzuto's long candidacy as a recurring 
focus in his book Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, devoting several 
chapters to the shortstop's career and comparisons with similar players. 
James assessed Rizzuto's career statistics as historically substandard 
by Hall of Fame standards, although he acknowledged that credit must be 
given for the years he missed in World War II, and criticized many of the 
public arguments both for and against his selection; but despite noting 
that Rizzuto was a great defensive player and a good hitter he stated that 
he could not endorse his candidacy, as there were too many similar players 
with virtually identical accomplishments.[21] The book's final paragraph 
noted Rizzuto's election to the Hall in February 1994. James, however, 
did point out that there were numerous players in the Hall who were inferior 
to Rizzuto, and in 2001 he selected Rizzuto as the 16th greatest shortstop 
of all time,[22] ahead of eight other Hall of Famers. Rizzuto was modest 
about his achievements, saying, "I never thought I deserved to be in the 
Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is for the big guys, pitchers with 100 mph 
fastballs and hitters who sock homers and drive in a lot of runs. That's 
the way it always has been, and the way it should be."[23] Rizzuto gave 
a memorably discombobulated induction speech at Cooperstown, in which he 
repeatedly complained about the buzzing flies that were pestering him. 
Rizzuto's "inimitable and wondrous digressions and ramblings" were mimicked 
by New York Times columnist Ira Berkow: Anyway, somewhere in the speech 
(Rizzuto) told about leaving home in Brooklyn for the first time when he 
was 19 years old and going to play shortstop in the minor league town of 
Bassett, Virginia, and he was on a train with no sleeper and when he got 
his first taste of Southern fried chicken and it was great and it was also 
the first time that he ever ate -- "Hey, White, what's that stuff that 
looks like oatmeal?"—and Bill White, his onetime announcing partner on 
Yankee broadcasts, and, like all his partners, never seemed to learn their 
first names, though he knew the first and last names of a lot of the birthdays 
he forever is announcing and the owners of his favorite restaurants even 
though as he admits he often talks about the score or the game, but after 
38 years of announcing games and after a 13-year playing career with championship 
Yankee teams few seem to care about this either, well, White was in the 
audience and stood up and said "Grits". In 1999, the minor league Staten 
Island Yankees named their mascot "Scooter the Holy Cow", after Rizzuto.[24] 
He was inducted in 2009 into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[25] There is 
a park named after him in Elizabeth, New Jersey, directly across from Kean 
University. When Rizzuto did not attend the annual Cooperstown reunion 
in 2005 and the annual New York Yankees Old Timers Day in 2006, questions 
were raised about his health. His last public appearance came early in 
2006; visibly frail, he announced that he was putting much of his memorabilia 
on the market. In September 2006, Rizzuto's 1950 MVP plaque fetched $175,000, 
three of his World Series rings sold for $84,825, and a Yankee cap with 
a wad of chewing gum on it went for $8,190. The majority of the proceeds 
went to Rizzuto's longtime charity of choice, Jersey City's St. Joseph's 
School for the Blind.[26] On September 12, 2006, the New York Post revealed 
that Rizzuto was currently in a "private rehab facility, trying to overcome 
muscle atrophy and problems with his esophagus."[26] Rizzuto died in his
