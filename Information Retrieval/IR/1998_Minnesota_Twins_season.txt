Like many Twins teams of its half-decade, the 1998 Minnesota Twins neither 
impressed nor contended. The team finished with a 70-92 record, with subpar 
batting and pitching. The season was not without its bright spots, as individual 
players had solid seasons and Hall of Fame designated hitter Paul Molitor 
announced his retirement at the end of the season. Unfortunately, Tom Kelly's 
team suffered plenty of lowlights, most notably David Wells' perfect game 
against the team on May 17 at Yankee Stadium. In 1998, Twins fans witnessed 
the emergence of Matt Lawton and Todd Walker as major league hitters. The 
team believed Walker would be able to fill the void left after the trade 
of Chuck Knoblauch, who had been traded to the New York Yankees on February 
6. Fans also saw the merciful end to Twins' Scott Stahoviak era. Otis Nixon 
had a surprising year for a 39-year-old, hitting .297 and stealing 37 bases 
(leading the team). Molitor's hitting continued its gradual decline from 
his stellar 1996 campaign, with his average down to .281 and RBIs down 
to 69. These numbers were still competent and he was able to retire while 
playing solid baseball. Bob Tewksbury was the opening day starter for the 
Twins, the last opening day starter not named Brad Radke until 2006. Tewksbury, 
Radke, LaTroy Hawkins, and rookie Eric Milton (acquired in the Knoblauch 
trade) were in the rotation for most of the year. Mike Morgan and Frank 
Rodriguez also started 17 and 11 games, respectively. While Morgan had 
an impressive year for a forty-year-old journeyman before being traded 
in August, Rodriguez's season was a major disappointment. In his last year 
for the Twins, Rodriguez went 4-6 with an ERA of 6.56. This could not have 
been what the team had in mind when it acquired him for Rick Aguilera in 
1995. Subsequent to that trade, the Twins reacquired Aguilera, and he served 
as the teams' closer in 1998, earning a respectable 38 saves. Also in the 
bullpen, Eddie Guardado, Mike Trombley, Héctor Carrasco, and Greg Swindell 
had competent seasons. In his penultimate year as a major league catcher, 
Minnesota native Terry Steinbach, then 36, had a mediocre season, with 
Javier Valentín as his backup. David Ortiz was projected as the starting 
first baseman, but was hampered by injuries. Orlando Merced, Molitor, and 
Stahoviak saw time at the position in Ortiz's absence. Walker played second, 
while Ron Coomer saw a majority of the time at third. Pat Meares was the 
starting shortstop, but was unceremoniously dumped by the team following 
the season. The outfield consisted of a declining Marty Cordova, Nixon, 
and Lawton. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]
