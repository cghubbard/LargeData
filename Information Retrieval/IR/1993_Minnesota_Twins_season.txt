The 1993 Minnesota Twins underperformed in their last year in the old American 
League West Division, finishing with a 71-91 record, leaving the team tied 
for fifth place with the California Angels. There were bright spots for 
Manager Tom Kelly. This included Kirby Puckett winning the All-Star MVP 
award on July 13. Another bright spot was St. Paul native Dave Winfield 
getting his 3,000th hit in his first year back with his hometown team. 
Not only did Winfield get his 3,000th hit, but he also got his 500th double 
and 450th homer. He had a serviceable year as the team's primary designated 
hitter, hitting .271 with 21 home runs and 76 RBI. Other offensive highlights 
included Kent Hrbek becoming the second Twin (along with Harmon Killebrew) 
to reach 1,000 RBI and Brian Harper becoming only the fourth catcher in 
the prior 40 years to hit .300 in three consecutive seasons. Chuck Knoblauch 
continued his solid leadoff hitting, batting .277 and stealing a team-leading 
29 bases. The weaker spots in the regular lineup included Pedro Mu√±oz (.233 
average). The starting rotation was reasonably competent, with Kevin Tapani, 
Willie Banks, and Jim Deshaies having ERAs in the low fours. Unfortunately, 
Scott Erickson was not able to follow up his very successful first three 
years in the majors, posting an ERA of 5.19 and leading the majors in losses 
(19). The fifth spot in the rotation was uncertain, with Eddie Guardado 
making 16 starts and Mike Trombley 10. There were strong pitchers in the 
bullpen, starting with closer Rick Aguilera. He had 34 saves, and was American 
League Pitcher of the Month for June. Also having strong years were Larry 
Casian with an ERA of 3.02, Mike Hartley (4.00), and Carl Willis (3.10). 
This was not so much the case for pitchers such as George Tsamis (6.19) 
and Brett Merriman (9.67). The team was strong defensively. Harper was 
a strong catcher, with a .988 fielding percentage. Hrbek was always strong 
at first base as well, making only five errors in 1993. Knoblauch was a 
good second baseman at this point in his career. Mike Pagliarulo played 
in about half the team's games at third, with reasonable competence. (Jeff 
Reboulet and Terry Jorgensen also saw time at the position.) The team intended 
Scott Leius to be the starting shortstop, but an early injury prevented 
this from occurring. It paved the way for Pat Meares to man the position 
for several years. He surprised the team by playing reasonably well during 
his rookie year. Puckett always excelled in center field, while Shane Mack 
and Munoz did okay on either side of him. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
