As player As manager Burleigh Arland Grimes (August 18, 1893 – December 
6, 1985) was an American professional baseball player, and the last pitcher 
officially permitted to throw the spitball. Grimes made the most of this 
advantage and he won 270 games and pitched in four World Series over the 
course of his 19-year career. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic 
Hall of Fame in 1954, and to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964. Grimes 
was born in Emerald, Wisconsin. He was the first child of Nick Grimes, 
a farmer and former day laborer, and the former Ruth Tuttle, the daughter 
of a former Wisconsin legislator. Having previously played baseball for 
several local teams, Nick Grimes managed the Clear Lake Yellow Jackets 
and taught his son how to play the game early in life.[1] Burleigh Grimes 
also participated in boxing as a child.[2] He made his professional debut 
in 1912 for the Eau Claire Commissioners of the Minnesota–Wisconsin League.[3] 
He played in Ottumwa, Iowa, in 1913 for the Ottumwa Packers in the Central 
Association. Grimes played for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1916 and 1917. 
Before the 1918 season, he was sent to the Brooklyn Dodgers in a multiplayer 
trade.[4] When the spitball was banned in 1920, he was named as one of 
the 17 established pitchers who were allowed to continue to throw the pitch. 
According to Baseball Digest, the Phillies were able to hit him because 
they knew when he was throwing the spitter. The Dodgers were mystified 
about this; first they thought the relative newcomer of a catcher, Hank 
DeBerry, was unwittingly giving away his signals to the pitcher, so they 
substituted veteran Zack Taylor, to no avail. They suggested that a spy 
with binoculars was concealed in the scoreboard in old Baker Bowl in Philadelphia, 
reading the signals from a distance, but the Phils hit Grimes just as well 
in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. A batboy solved the mystery by pointing out 
that Burleigh's cap was too tight. It sounded silly, but he was right. 
The tighter cap would wiggle when Grimes flexed his facial muscles to prepare 
the spitter. He got a cap a half-size larger and the Phillies were on their 
own after that.[citation needed] He then pitched for the New York Giants 
(1927), the Pirates again (1928–1929), the Boston Braves (1930) and the 
St. Louis Cardinals (1930-1931). He was traded to the Chicago Cubs before 
the 1932 season in exchange for Hack Wilson and Bud Teachout.[5] He returned 
to the Cardinals in 1933 and 1934, then moved to the Pirates (1934) and 
the New York Yankees (1934). Grimes was nicknamed "Ol' Stubblebeard", related 
to his habit of not shaving on days in which he was going to pitch.[6] 
At the time of his retirement, he was the last of the 17 spitballers left 
in the league. He had acquired a lasting field reputation for his temperament. 
He is listed in the Baseball Hall of Shame series for having thrown a ball 
at the batter in the on-deck circle.[7] His friends and supporters note 
that he was consistently a kind man when off the diamond. Others claim 
he showed a greedy attitude to many people who 'got on his bad side.' He 
would speak mainly only to his best friend Ivy Olson in the dugout, and 
would pitch only to a man named Mathias Schroeder before games. Schroeder's 
identity was not well known among many Dodger players, as many say he was 
just 'a nice guy from the neighborhood.' Grimes moved to the minor leagues 
in 1935 as a player-manager for the Bloomington Bloomers of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa 
League. He started 21 games for the team, recording a 2.34 ERA and a 10-5 
record.[8] He did not pitch again after that season, moving on to manage 
the Louisville Colonels of the American Association.[8] Grimes was the 
manager of the Dodgers in 1937-38. He followed Casey Stengel's term as 
Dodgers manager.[9] He compiled a two-year record of 131-171 (.434), with 
his teams finishing sixth and seventh respectively in the National League. 
Babe Ruth was one of Grimes's coaches. Leo Durocher was the team's shortstop 
in 1937 and a coach in 1938.[10] When Grimes was fired by general manager 
Larry MacPhail after the 1938 season, Durocher was hired to replace him. 
MacPhail said that the team's morale had not been right for a long period 
of time.[11] Grimes remained in baseball for many years as a minor league 
manager and a scout. He managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International 
League from 1942 to 1944, and again in 1952 and 1953, winning the pennant 
in 1943. As a scout with the Baltimore Orioles, Grimes discovered Jim Palmer 
and Dave McNally.[10] Grimes also assisted in managing the Independence 
Yankees in Independence, Kansas in 1948 and 1949, where Mickey Mantle started 
his professional career in 1949.[12] Grimes was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1964. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included 
Grimes in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Grimes 
died of cancer in 1985 in Clear Lake, Wisconsin. His wife Lillian survived
