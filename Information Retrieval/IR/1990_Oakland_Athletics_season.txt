The Oakland Athletics' 1990 season was their 23rd in Oakland, California. 
It was also the 90th season in franchise history. The team finished first 
in the American League West with a record of 103-59. The Athletics' 1990 
campaign ranks among the organization's finest. Oakland, in winning 103 
games, led the league in wins for a third consecutive season. The Athletics 
benefited from stellar performances in all areas of the game. The team's 
offense was led by eventual Hall-of-Famer Rickey Henderson. Henderson finished 
the season with 65 stolen bases, 28 home runs, and a .325 batting average; 
for his efforts, he took home the 1990 American League MVP Award. The Athletics 
also benefited from strong performances by superstars Mark McGwire and 
Jose Canseco. The pair clubbed 39 and 37 home runs, respectively; in doing 
so, they drove in a combined total of 209 runs. Over the course of the 
season, the team added to an already strong offense; the additions of recent 
All-Stars Willie Randolph, Willie McGee, and Harold Baines further widened 
the gap between the Athletics and the rest of the league. Established veterans 
(such as Carney Lansford, Terry Steinbach, Dave Henderson, and Mike Gallego) 
and promising young players (mainly Walt Weiss and Mike Bordick) rounded 
out arguably the deepest roster in all of Major League Baseball. Eight 
of the Athletics' nine main postseason starters (R. Henderson, McGwire, 
Canseco, McGee, Steinbach, Randolph, Baines, and Lansford) played in at 
least one All-Star Game between 1988 and 1990. The Athletics pitching staff, 
in many regards, had an even stronger campaign. The starting rotation was 
led by veteran Bob Welch. Welch would finish the season with both an MLB-leading 
27 wins and a 2.95 ERA; this performance was strong enough to net the 1990 
Cy Young Award. Welch, as of 2014, remains the last MLB pitcher to win 
at least 25 games in a season.[1] Fellow starter Dave Stewart, winner of 
22 games, finished in a tie (with Pittsburgh starter Doug Drabek) for the 
second-most wins in MLB. 1989 All-Star Mike Moore, 1991 All-Star Scott 
Sanderson, and longtime Athletic Curt Young rounded out the American League's 
top rotation. The Athletics' bullpen was led by superstar closer Dennis 
Eckersley, who posted a microscopic 0.61 ERA while recording 48 saves. 
As a team, the Athletics allowed only 570 runs (the fewest in the American 
League by a wide margin). The Athletics easily won the American League 
West for a third consecutive season. They swept the Boston Red Sox, four 
games to none, in that year's American League Championship series; in doing 
so, they won a third consecutive American League pennant. The Athletics 
entered the 1990 World Series as heavy favorites. Despite this, however, 
they were themselves swept by the Cincinnati Reds. The Athletics have not 
reached the World Series since. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
