As player As manager As coach Howard Rodney Edwards (born December 10, 
1936 in Red Jacket, West Virginia) was a backup catcher with the Cleveland 
Indians, Kansas City Athletics, New York Yankees, and the Philadelphia 
Phillies over parts of five seasons spanning eight years. He earned his 
nickname of "Doc" as a Navy medic. Signed by the Indians, he spent some 
time in the minors before being traded to the Kansas City Athletics for 
Dick Howser in 1963. After two years, he was traded to the Yankees, and 
less than a year later, he was sent back to Cleveland. In 1967, he was 
traded to the Houston Astros, who quickly released him. He was picked up 
by the Philadelphia Phillies in November for whom he became a bullpen coach. 
In June 1970, a series of injuries left the Phillies short a catcher and 
they activated the then 32-year-old Edwards. Edwards responded with two-hits 
and then caught a Jim Bunning–Dick Selma two-hitter.[1] He coached with 
both the Phillies and Indians before becoming a manager at the minor league 
level, including for the Québec Metros in 1977. In 1981, he managed the 
Rochester Red Wings against the Pawtucket Red Sox in a 33-inning game, 
the longest in professional baseball history. In 1987, he was hired[2] 
by the Indians to replace Pat Corrales, but their futility continued (they 
had only two winning seasons between 1968 and 1987). Edwards was fired 
with 19 games remaining in the 1989 season and replaced with scout John 
Hart. Edwards is currently the field manager for the San Angelo Colts, 
a team in the independent United League Baseball. He has been managing 
this team for 6 years. On September 2, 2009, Edwards was awarded the 2009 
United League Baseball Manager of the Year award. Doc also managed the 
Atlantic City Surf to the championship during the inaugural season of the
