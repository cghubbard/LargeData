In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 home run club is a group of batters 
who have hit 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On 
August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended 
his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank 
Aaron surpassed it in 1974.[1] Aaron's ultimate career total, 755, remained 
the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 
season.[1] Twenty-seven players are members of the 500 home run club. At 
.344, Ted Williams holds the highest batting average among the club members 
while Harmon Killebrew holds the lowest at .256. Of these 27 players, 14 
were right-handed batters, 11 were left-handed, and 2 were switch hitters. 
The San Francisco Giants and Boston Red Sox are the only franchises to 
see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: for the Giants, 
Mel Ott while the team was in New York, Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, and 
most recently Bonds, and, for the Red Sox, Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, and 
more recently Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz. Five 500 home run club members—Aaron, 
Mays, Eddie Murray, Rafael Palmeiro, and Alex Rodriguez—are also members 
of the 3,000 hit club. Gary Sheffield's 500th home run was his first career 
home run with the New York Mets, the first time that a player's 500th home 
run was also his first with his franchise.[2] Alex Rodriguez, at 32 years 
and 8 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Ted Williams, 
at 41 years and 291 days, was the oldest.[2][3]The most recent player to 
reach 500 home runs is David Ortiz, who hit his 500th home run on September 
12, 2015.[4] Membership in the 500 home run club is sometimes described 
as a guarantee of eventual entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although 
some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years.[5][6][7][8] 
Five eligible club members—Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, 
Gary Sheffield and Sammy Sosa—have not been elected to the Hall. Bonds 
and Sosa made their first appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot in 2013; 
Bonds received only 36.2% and Sosa 12.5% of the total votes, with 75% required 
for induction.[9] Eligibility requires that a player has "been retired 
five seasons" or be deceased for at least six months,[10] disqualifying 
three retired living players who have been active within the past five 
seasons -- Jim Thome, Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz. Some believe the milestone 
has become less important with the large number of new members; 10 players 
joined the club from 1999 to 2009.[5] Additionally, several of these recent 
members have had ties to performance-enhancing drugs.[5][8][11] Some believe 
that by not electing McGwire to the Hall the voters were establishing a 
"referendum" on how they would treat players from the "Steroid Era".[12][13] 
On January 8, 2014, Rafael Palmeiro became the first member of the 500 
Home Run Club to be removed from the BBWAA Hall of Fame ballot. As the 
BBWAA announced the selections for the Baseball Hall of Fame Class of 2014, 
Palmeiro appeared on just 4.4% of the ballots. Players must be named on 
at least of 5.0% of ballots to remain on future ballots.[14] Two players 
on the 500 club are still active: Rodriguez and Albert Pujols. Of these, 
Rodriguez is active leader in home runs with 696.[15] Italics denotes active
