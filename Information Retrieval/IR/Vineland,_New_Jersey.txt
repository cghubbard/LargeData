Vineland is a city in Cumberland County, New Jersey, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a total population of 60,724,[10][11][12] 
reflecting an increase of 4,453 (+7.9%) from the 56,271 counted in the 
2000 Census, which had in turn increased by 1,491 (+2.7%) from the 54,780 
counted in the 1990 Census.[21] Vineland, Millville and Bridgeton are the 
three principal New Jersey cities of the Vineland-Millville-Bridgeton Primary 
Metropolitan Statistical Area, which encompasses those three cities and 
all of Cumberland County for statistical purposes and had a population 
of 156,898 as of the 2010 Census.[22] Vineland was formed on July 1, 1952, 
through the merger of Landis Township and Vineland Borough, based on the 
results of a referendum held on February 5, 1952.[3][23][24] Festivities 
on July 1, 1952, when the merger took effect, included a parade and speeches 
from such notables as Senator Estes Kefauver.[25] The name is derived from 
the plans of its founder to use the land to grow grapes.[26][27] Charles 
K. Landis purchased 30,000 acres (121 km2) of land in 1861 and another 
23,000 acres (93 km2) in 1874, near Millville, New Jersey, and along the 
West Jersey railroad line with service between Camden and Cape May, to 
create his own alcohol-free utopian society based on agriculture and progressive 
thinking. The first houses were built in 1862, and train service was established 
to Philadelphia and New York City, with the population reaching 5,500 by 
1865 and 11,000 by 1875.[28][29] Established as a Temperance Town, where 
the sale of alcohol was prohibited, Landis required that purchasers of 
land in Vineland had to build a house on the purchased property within 
a year of purchase, that 2 1⁄2 acres (10,000 m2) of the often-heavily wooded 
land had to be cleared and farmed each year, and that adequate space be 
placed between houses and roads to allow for planting of flowers and shade 
trees along the routes through town. Landis Avenue was constructed as a 
100-foot (30 m) wide and about 1-mile (2 km) long road running east-west 
through the center of the community, with other, narrower roads connecting 
at right angles to each other.[30] After determining that the Vineland 
soil was well-suited for growing grapes (hence the name), Landis started 
advertising to attract Italian grape growers to Vineland, offering 20 acres 
(81,000 m2) of land that had to be cleared and used to grow grapes. Thomas 
Bramwell Welch founded Welch's Grape Juice, and purchased the locally grown 
grapes to make "unfermented wine" (or grape juice).[30] The fertile ground 
also attracted the glass-making industry and was home to the Progresso 
soup company. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, most of the 
city was involved in the poultry industry, which led to the city being 
dubbed "The Egg Basket of America."[31] Vineland Poultry Laboratories (now 
Lohman Animal Health) was started by Arthur Goldhaft. Dr. Goldhaft is credited 
with putting "a chicken in every pot" after developing the fowl pox chicken 
vaccine that saved millions of chickens from death. Dr. Goldhaft's work 
at Vineland Poultry Laboratories in Vineland, helped protect the world's 
chicken supply from the fowl pox disease.[32] Vineland had New Jersey's 
first school for the intellectual disabled, the Vineland Developmental 
Center, which now has an east and west campus. These institutions housed 
mentally handicapped women in fully staffed cottages. Henry H. Goddard, 
an American psychologist, coined the term "Moron" while directing the Research 
Laboratory at the Training School for Backward and Feeble-minded Children 
in Vineland. This facility was so sufficiently well known that one American 
Prison Association pamphlet in 1955 heralded Vineland as "famous for its 
contributions to our knowledge of the feebleminded".[33] The city of Vineland 
celebrated its 150th birthday in 2011. Mayor Robert Romano initially ordered 
a custom cake from Buddy Valastro of Carlo's Bake Shop in Hoboken, the 
business featured in the TLC reality television series Cake Boss. After 
outcry from local business owners, the order was canceled and five Vineland 
bakeries were commissioned to create elaborate cakes for the event.[34] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area 
of 69.029 square miles (178.785 km2), including 68.424 square miles (177.218 km2) 
of land and 0.605 square miles (1.568 km2) of water (0.88%).[1][2] Of all 
the municipalities in New Jersey to hold the label of City, Vineland is 
the largest in total area. (Hamilton Township in Atlantic County is the 
largest municipality in New Jersey in terms of land area. Galloway Township, 
also in Atlantic County, is the largest municipality in total area, including 
open water within its borders.)[35] Vineland borders Deerfield Township, 
Millville, and Maurice River Township. Vineland also borders Salem County, 
Gloucester County, and Atlantic County.[36] The city is approximately 38 
miles (61 km) from the Atlantic Ocean. Unincorporated communities, localities 
and place names located partially or completely within the city include 
Clayville, Hances Bridge, Leamings Mill, Menantico, North Vineland, Parvins 
Branch, Pleasantville, South Vineland and Willow Grove.[37] Vineland has

merchants.[52] The main street in Vineland is Landis Avenue. The traditional 
downtown area is located several blocks east and west of the intersection 
of Landis Avenue and the Boulevard. The Boulevard is a pair of roads that 
flank the main north/south railroad, which connected Vineland with Cape 
May to the south and Camden/Philadelphia to the north. After many years 
of decline there has been much recent activity to restore the vitality 
of "The Avenue" and the center city area. New construction includes a new 
transportation center, courthouse, post office, elementary school / community 
center and sidewalk upgrades. In 2005, Vineland was designated a Main Street 
Community and, through the work of this group, money has been earmarked 
to continue this improvement through property and facade improvements, 
business retention and marketing.[53] The City of Vineland is governed 
within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter 
Law, under the Mayor-Council (Plan A), implemented based on the recommendations 
of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1952, months after the city's 
formation.[54] The mayor serves as the city's chief executive, while the 
City Council is its legislative branch. The mayor and council are elected 
concurrently to serve four-year terms of office in non-partisan elections 
held in leap years as part of the November general election.[8][4] An ordinance 
passed by the council in 2011 shifted elections from May to November, effectively 
extending the term of members serving at the time by six months.[55] As
