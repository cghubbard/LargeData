Immediately after World War II, New York City became known as one of the 
world's greatest cities. However, after peaking in population in 1950, 
the city began to feel the effects of white flight to the suburbs, a downturn 
in industry and commerce as businesses left for places where it was cheaper 
and easier to operate, an increase in crime, and an upturn in its welfare 
burden, all of which reached a nadir in the city's fiscal crisis of the 
1970s, when it barely avoided defaulting on its obligations and declaring 
bankruptcy. As many great cities lay in ruins after World War II, New York 
City assumed a new global prominence. It became the home of the United 
Nations headquarters, built 1947–1952; inherited the role of Paris as center 
of the art world with Abstract Expressionism; and became a rival to London 
as an international art market. Yet the population declined after 1950, 
with increasing suburbanization in the New York metropolitan area as pioneered 
in Levittown, New York. November 15, 1948, saw a turning point in the city's 
economy: the Interstate Commerce Commission began allowing barges to charge 
fees for transporting goods from rail terminals in New Jersey to piers 
in Manhattan.[1] This led to the decline of the port, the piers, and places 
such as Washington Market in Lower Manhattan. Meanwhile, Midtown Manhattan, 
fueled by postwar prosperity, was experiencing an unprecedented building 
boom that changed its very appearance. Glass-and-steel office towers in 
the new International Style began to replace the ziggurat-style towers 
of the prewar era. Also rapidly changing was the eastern edge of the East 
Village close to FDR Drive. Many traditional apartment blocks were cleared 
and replaced with large-scale public housing projects. In Lower Manhattan, 
urban renewal began to take shape around 1960, led by David Rockefeller's 
construction of the One Chase Manhattan Plaza building. In a built-out 
city, construction entails destruction. After the old Beaux Arts Pennsylvania 
Station was torn down, growing concern for preservation led to the 1965 
Landmarks Preservation Commission Law. The city's other great train station, 
Grand Central, was also threatened with demolition but was eventually saved. 
Meanwhile, New York City's network of highways spread under the guidance 
of Robert Moses, with consequent increased traffic congestion, but the 
defeat in 1962 of Moses' planned Lower Manhattan Expressway by community 
activists led by Jane Jacobs was an indication that Moses would no longer 
have the free hand he had enjoyed in the past. During the '60s, a gradual 
economic and social decay set in. A symptom of the city's waning competitiveness 
was the loss of both its longtime resident National League baseball teams 
to booming California; the Dodgers and the Giants both moved after the 
1957 season. A sports void was partially filled with the formation of the 
Mets in 1962, who played their first two seasons at the Polo Grounds, the 
former home of the Giants, before moving to Shea Stadium in Queens in 1964. 
The passage of the federal Immigration Act of 1965, which abolished national-origin 
quotas, set the stage for increased immigration from Asia, which became 
the basis for New York's modern Asian American community. On November 9, 
1965, New York endured a widespread power blackout along with much of eastern 
North America. (The city's ordeal became the subject of the 1968 film, 
Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?) The postwar population shift 
to the suburbs resulted in the decline of textile manufacturing and other 
traditional industries in New York, most of which also operated in extremely 
outdated facilities. With the arrival of container shipping, that industry 
shifted to New Jersey where there was more room for it. Blue-collar neighborhoods 
began to deteriorate and become centers of drugs and crime. Strip clubs 
and other adult businesses started filling Times Square in the late '60s. 
In 1966, the US Navy decommissioned the Brooklyn Navy Yard, ending a command 
going back to the early 19th century. It was sold to the city. The Yard 
continued as a site for shipbuilding for another eleven years. John Lindsay, 
a liberal Republican, was a highly visible and charismatic mayor from 1965 
to 1973. The city was a national center of protest movements regarding 
civil rights for black citizens, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the 
newly emerging feminist and gay movements. There were jolting economic 
shocks as the postwar prosperity came to an end with many factories and 
entire industries shutting down. There was a population transition with 
hundreds of thousands of blacks and Puerto Ricans moving in, and an exodus 
of whites to the suburbs. Labor unions, especially in teaching, transit, 
sanitation and construction, fractured over major strikes and internal 
racial tensions.[2] The Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) led by 
Mike Quill shut down the city with a complete halt of subway and bus service 
on mayor John Lindsay's first day of office. As New Yorkers endured the 
transit strike, Lindsay remarked, "I still think it's a fun city," and 
walked four miles (6 km) from his hotel room to City Hall in a gesture 
to show it.[3] Dick Schaap, then a columnist for the New York Herald Tribune, 
coined and popularized the sarcastic term in an article titled Fun City.[3][4] 
In the article, Schaap sardonically pointed out that it was not.[3][4] 
The transit strike was the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 the teachers' 
union (the United Federation of Teachers, or the UFT) went on strike over 
the firings of several teachers in a school in Ocean Hill and Brownsville.[5] 
That same year, 1968, also saw a nine-day sanitation strike.[6][7] Quality 
of life in New York reached a nadir during this strike, as mounds of garbage 
caught fire, and strong winds whirled the filth through the streets.[8] 
With the schools shut down, the police engaged in a slowdown, firefighters 
threatening job actions, the city awash in garbage, and racial and religious 
tensions breaking to the surface, Lindsay later called the last six months 
of 1968 "the worst of my public life."[9] The Stonewall riots were a series 
of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took 
place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, 
in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently 
cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual 
community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted 
sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked 
the start of the gay rights movement in the United States and around the 
world. By 1970, the city gained notoriety for high rates of crime and other 
social disorders. A popular song by Cashman & West in the autumn of 1972, 
"American City Suite", chronicled, in allegorical fashion, the decline 
in the city's quality of life. The city's subway system was regarded as 
unsafe due to crime and suffered frequent mechanical breakdowns. Prostitutes 
and pimps frequented Times Square, while Central Park became feared as 
the site of muggings and rapes. Homeless persons and drug dealers occupied 
boarded-up and abandoned buildings. The New York City Police Department 
was subject to investigation for widespread corruption, most famously in 
the 1971 testimony of whistle-blowing police officer Frank Serpico.[10] 
US economic stagnation in the 1970s hit New York City particularly hard, 
amplified by a large movement of middle-class residents to the suburbs, 
which drained the city of tax revenue.[11] The city neared bankruptcy under 
Mayor Beame but avoided that step with the aid of a $2.3 billion federal 
loan. A statement by Mayor Beame was drafted and ready to be released on 
October 17, 1975, if the teachers' union did not invest $150 million from 
its pension funds in city securities. "I have been advised by the comptroller 
that the City of New York has insufficient cash on hand to meet debt obligations 
due today," the statement said. "This constitutes the default that we have 
struggled to avoid."[12] The Beame statement was never distributed because 
Albert Shanker, the teachers' union president, finally furnished $150 million 
from the union's pension fund to buy Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds. 
Two weeks later, President Gerald R. Ford angered New Yorkers by refusing 
to grant the city a bailout. Ford later signed the New York City Seasonal 
Financing Act of 1975 which extended $1.3 billion worth of federal loans 
to the city for three years; the loans were repaid with interest.[13][14] 
The first solution proposed was the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which 
tried to pool the city's money and refinance its heavy debts. It failed 
to achieve results and the state came up with a much more drastic solution 
the Emergency Financial Control Board (EFCB). It was a state agency, and 
city officials had only two votes on the seven-member board. The EFCB took 
full control of the city's budget. It made drastic cuts in municipal services 
and spending, cut city employment, froze salaries and raised bus and subway 
fares. The level of welfare spending was cut. Some hospitals were closed 
as were some branch libraries and fire stations. The labor unions helped 
out, by allocating much of their pension funds to the purchase of city 
bonds—putting the pensions at risk if bankruptcy took place. The city's 
banks and the state of New York did not have enough credit to handle the 
entire crisis, Federal loans and loan guarantees were needed, which Congress 
provided it in the "New York City Seasonal Financing Act" of December 1975.[15][16][17][18] 
The opening of the mammoth World Trade Center complex in 1972, however, 
was one of the few high points of the city's history at that time. Conceived 
by David Rockefeller and built by the Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey on the site of the Radio Row electronics district in Lower Manhattan, 
the Twin Towers displaced the Empire State Building in Midtown as the world's 
tallest; it was displaced in turn by Chicago's Sears Tower in 1973. A fiscal 
conservative, Democrat Ed Koch, was elected as mayor in 1977. The New York 
City blackout of 1977 struck on July 13 of that year and lasted for 25 
hours, during which black and Hispanic neighborhoods fell prey to destruction 
and looting. Over 3,000 people were arrested, and the city's already crowded 
prisons were so overburdened that some suggested reopening the recently 
condemned Manhattan Detention Complex.[19] The financial crisis, high crime 
rates, and damage from the blackouts led to a widespread belief that New 
York City was in irreversible decline. By the end of the 1970s, nearly 
a million people had left, a population loss that would not be recouped 
for another twenty years. To Jonathan Mahler, the chronicler of The Bronx 
is Burning, "The clinical term for it, fiscal crisis, didn't approach the
