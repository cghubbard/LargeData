Hugh N. Nicol (January 1, 1858 – June 27, 1921) was a Scottish-American 
professional baseball player. An outfielder, Nicol played in Major League 
Baseball for the Chicago White Stockings, St. Louis Browns, Cincinnati 
Red Stockings, and Cincinnati Reds. Nicol's debut game took place on May 
3, 1881. His final game took place on August 2, 1890. Nicol had 138 stolen 
bases in 1887, however prior to 1898 a stolen base was credited to a baserunner 
who reached an extra base on a hit from another player. He had 103 stolen 
bases in 1888. Despite the fact that he had two 100 stolen-base seasons, 
only 383 of his total career stolen bases are known. He also managed the 
Browns in 1897. Nicol became the head baseball coach and athletic director 
at Purdue University for the Purdue Boilermakers. He also scouted for the 
Reds during the summers, beginning in 1911.[1] Nicol resigned from Purdue 
in 1914, after accusations that the American football team played like 
"rowdies."[2] He died in Lafayette, Indiana on June 27, 1921. Pound sign
