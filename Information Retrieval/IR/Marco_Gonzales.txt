Marco Elias Gonzales (born February 16, 1992) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He attended Gonzaga University, where he played college baseball for the 
Bulldogs as a pitcher and first baseman. The Cardinals selected him with 
the 19th overall pick in the first round of the June 2013 MLB draft, and 
he made his MLB debut one year later against the Colorado Rockies. At Gonzaga, 
he won West Coast Conference Player of the Year, Pitcher of the Year, and 
Freshman of the Year awards. Gonzales also was chosen as an All-American 
and named the John Olerud Award winner for 2013. In Minor League Baseball 
in 2014, he was a Texas League midseason All-Star and Pitcher of the Week 
selection and the Cardinals' Minor League Pitcher of the Year. Gonzales 
attended Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins, Colorado.[1] He lettered 
in baseball in all four years.[2] In his sophomore, junior, and senior 
seasons, he was named All-Colorado and All-Front Range. As a senior, he 
was named the Colorado High School Baseball Player of the Year after compiling 
an 11–0 won–loss record (W–L) with a 2.20 earned run average (ERA) and 
87 strikeouts (SO) in 54 innings pitched (IP). He also batted .486 with 
seven home runs and 36 runs batted in (RBI).[2] He started the Class 5A 
state championship game for Rocky Mountain in all four years of his high 
school career, winning all four.[1][2] The Colorado Rockies selected Gonzales 
in the 29th round of the 2010 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. As the 
Rockies did not make a significant offer and advised him to attend college, 
Gonzales opted not to sign. Instead, he enrolled at Gonzaga University 
to play college baseball for the Bulldogs.[1] That summer, he played collegiate 
summer baseball for the Wenatchee AppleSox of the West Coast League.[3] 
As a freshman at Gonzaga, Gonzales finished with an 11–2 W–L and 2.57 ERA, 
and was named West Coast Conference (WCC) co-Player of the Year and co-Freshman 
of the Year, along with Kris Bryant.[1][4] As a sophomore, he had an 8–2 
W–L and a 1.55 ERA, and was named WCC Pitcher of the Year and an All-American.[1][2][5] 
That summer, he played for the United States national collegiate baseball 
team in tournaments in Cuba and the Netherlands, being named most valuable 
player of the Netherlands tournament.[2] In 2013, his junior year, he pitched 
a 7–3 record with a 2.80 ERA, and led the team in hitting with a .311 average, 
two home runs and 26 RBI, earning him Co-West Coast Conference Player of 
the Year honors.[1][6] Gonzales was named a semifinalist for the Golden 
Spikes Award.[7] In 2013, he won the John Olerud Award, awarded annually 
by the College Baseball Foundation to the best two-way player of the season.[8] 
Gonzales was widely considered to be a first-round pick before the 2013 
MLB draft[1] The St. Louis Cardinals selected him 19th overall.[9] He signed 
on June 19 for $1.85 million.[10] Baseball America rated him #28 in their 
Top 500 prospects. The Cardinals assigned him to the Gulf Coast League 
Cardinals in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, then promoted him to the 
Palm Beach Cardinals of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. He completed 
23 1⁄3 IP with a 2.70 ERA between the two squads. In addition, he allowed 
18 hits and eight walks for a 1.114 walks plus hits per inning pitched 
ratio (WHIP) while striking out 23.[11] Gonzales began the 2014 season 
with Palm Beach, and received a promotion to the Springfield Cardinals 
of the Class AA Texas League in May.[12] His statistics after seven starts 
at Springfield included 38 2⁄3 IP, a 3–2 won-loss record, a 2.33 ERA. He 
allowed 33 hits, two home runs, and 10 walks while striking out 46. He 
was rated the #4 prospect in the Cardinals' organization. The Cardinals 
called him up to the major leagues, and, the day before he made his MLB 
debut, he was named to the 2014 All-Star Futures Game at Target Field in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota.[13][14] Filling in for the injured Jaime García, 
Gonzales made his major league debut as the starter against the Rockies 
on June 25.[15] Due to his promotion to the major leagues, he was removed 
from the Futures Game roster.[16] He doubled in his first major league 
at-bat. Left fielder and former Rockie Matt Holliday singled him home to 
score his first run. On the mound, he gave up five earned runs and seven 
hits, with one home run in five innings, walking two, striking out three, 
facing 24 batters, and received a no-decision. Gonzales began with three 
scoreless innings, but got into trouble in the fourth by giving up a lead-off 
home run to Drew Stubbs, two doubles and two singles. The Cardinals eventually 
won, 9–6.[17] Gonzales became the first Cardinals' starter to make his 
debut without playing at the Triple A level since Cliff Politte in April 
1998.[18] Gonzales' second MLB start came against the San Francisco Giants 
at AT&T Park. The outing went similar to his first MLB appearance, he started 
with three scoreless innings but yielded multiple runs in the fourth. In 
4 1⁄3 IP, he yielded five earned runs, seven hits, four walks and two strikeouts. 
The Giants won 5–0, giving him his first MLB loss.[19] After posting a 
7.07 ERA in first three MLB starts, the Cardinals optioned him to the Triple-A 
Memphis Redbirds on July 7, where he appeared for the first time.[20] On 
August 30, the Cardinals recalled Gonzales, and he gained his first MLB 
win in a 13–2 romp over the Chicago Cubs. He completed six innings, allowed 
one run on three hits, two walks, and struck out five.[21] Gonzales' third 
win of the season came against the Rockies by a score of 4–1 on September 
14 as he struck out nine in 5 2⁄3 IP. The nine strikeouts were the most 
by a Cardinals left-handed rookie since Rick Ankiel on September 13, 2000.[22] 
He made 10 total MLB appearances, five as a starter, completing 34 2⁄3 
IP, allowing 32 H, 21 BB, 16 ER and a 4.15 ERA with a 4–2 W–L.[23] In 31 
total games – including 26 starts – between three minor league levels and 
the major leagues, Gonzales allowed a 2.81 ERA with a 13–7 W–L record and 
148 SO in 156 2⁄3 IP.[24] The Cardinals made the playoffs in 2014, and 
Gonzales made his MLB postseason debut, pitching in relief. He recorded 
three total scoreless innings in the National League Division Series (NLDS) 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He picked up two of the club's three wins, 
including the series clincher.[25] He pitched another three innings against 
the Giants in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), giving up 
three earned runs as the Cardinals were eliminated from the postseason.[23] 
In December, the Cardinals named him their Minor League Pitcher of the 
Year.[24] Having struggled with a shoulder injury for much of the 2015 
season, Gonzales totaled 13 starts and 64 innings with Memphis, allowing 
a 5.20 ERA with 81 hits and a .315 batting average against. His record 
was 1–4. The Cardinals activated him with the roster expansion on September 
1.[26] He made his first major league appearance and start of the season 
against the Washington Nationals that day, allowing four runs in less than 
three innings.[27] Prior to the 2016 season, Baseball America ranked him 
as the fifth-best prospect in the Cardinals' system.[28] He was sidelined 
on April 13, 2016, after a diagnosis on his ailing elbow from a torn ligament, 
requiring Tommy John surgery, requiring a rehab time of 12 to 15 months. 
He was ranked the seventh-best prospect in the Cardinals' organization.[29] 
Gonzales throws a fastball between 88 to 91 miles per hour (142–146 km/h). 
He features a changeup that was regarded as one of the best in his draft 
class.[6] His command is above average, and throws two different breaking 
pitches with his curve being better than his slider.[10] After his first 
MLB stint from June–July 2014, manager Mike Matheny advised him to add 
a curveball and cut fastball to keep hitters from focusing on his four-seam 
fastball and changeup.[20] Gonzales' father, Frank, played baseball at 
La Junta, Colorado High School, leading it to a state championship in the 
1980s. He went on to pitch at Colorado State University and was drafted 
in the 16th round by the Detroit Tigers in 1989. He then played some ten 
years in the minor leagues, coached high school and continues as a pitching 
coach the Colorado Rockies’ Class A minor-league club.[1] Gonzales' mother, 
Gina, is a firefighter; his brother Alex also plays baseball for Gonzales'
