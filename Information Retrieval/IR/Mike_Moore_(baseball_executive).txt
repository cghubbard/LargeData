Mike Moore is a retired baseball executive, whose most significant role 
was as president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues 
from 1991 through 2007.[1] Moore was born and raised in Columbus, Indiana.[2] 
He enrolled the University of Tampa in 1960, where he earned a degree in 
business education in 1963 and then became the UTâ€™s sports information 
director. From 1971 to 1988, he served as vice president, general manager 
and part owner of the Tampa Tarpons, a Florida State League affiliate of 
the Cincinnati Reds organization, while working as a sportscaster in Tampa.[3] 
In 1988 Moore worked as chief administrative officer for the National Association 
of Professional Baseball Leagues, working with president Sal Artiaga. Moore 
was elected the10th president of the NAPNL in December 1991. One of his 
most important moves came in 1992, when he was to convene a constitutional 
convention that would rewrite the National Association Agreement, which 
controlled the relationship between the NAPBL and its member leagues. The 
aforementioned agreement had not materially changed since the organization 
was founded in 1901.[1] Other important change was converting the NAPBL 
to more of a corporate structure than a political one, which prompted a 
intensively grown to the organization under his leadership. Back to 1991, 
prior to becoming President, Moore established an agency agreement partnership 
between the Professional Baseball Promotion Corporation, a NAPBL subsidiary, 
and Major League Baseball Properties to authorize licensed merchandise.[1] 
As attendance increased steadily with the years, Minor League Baseball 
set a new all-time attendance record of 42.8 million fans in 2007, the 
last season for Moore after spending 16 years in the office.[4] In 2009, 
Moore became an inaugural inductee in the Florida State League Hall of
