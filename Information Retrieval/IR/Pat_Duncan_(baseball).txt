Louis Baird "Pat" Duncan (October 6, 1893 in Coalton, Ohio – July 17, 1960 
in Columbus, Ohio), was a professional baseball player who played outfielder 
in the Major Leagues from 1915-1924. He would play for the Cincinnati Reds 
and Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1921, the park (Crosley Field) was in its tenth 
season and no one had yet hit a ball over the fence without the benefit 
of a bounce. The first ball to clear the fence on the fly was hit in late 
May by John Beckwith of the Chicago Giants of the Negro National League. 
Then on June 2, with the last-place Reds playing the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Duncan dug in against left-handed hurler Ferdie Schupp with a runner on 
second and one out. Duncan connected. The ball rocketed toward left field, 
easily cleared the wall, and Duncan had registered Organized Baseball’s 
first home run to go out of the park in Redland Field. It cleared the 12-foot 
concrete wall by four to six feet, and it traveled an estimated 400 feet.
