In baseball, a cutter, or cut fastball, is a type of fastball which breaks 
slightly toward the pitcher's glove side as it reaches home plate.[1] This 
pitch is somewhere between a slider and a fastball, as it is usually thrown 
faster than a slider but with more motion than a typical fastball.[1] Some 
pitchers use a cutter as a way to prevent hitters from expecting their 
regular fastballs. A common technique used to throw a cutter is to use 
a four-seam fastball grip with the baseball set slightly off center in 
the hand. When a batter is able to hit a cutter pitch, it often results 
in soft contact and an easy out, due to the pitch's movement keeping the 
ball away from the bat's sweet spot. The cutter is typically 2–5 mph slower 
than a pitcher's four-seam fastball. In 2010, the average pitch classified 
as a cutter by PITCHf/x thrown by a right-handed pitcher was 88.6 mph; 
the average four-seamer was 92.1 mph.[2] The New York Yankees' former closer 
Mariano Rivera, one of the foremost practitioners of the cutter,[1] made 
the pitch famous though the pitch itself has been around since at least 
the 1950s.[3] When the cut fastball is working correctly, mainly against 
opposite-handed batters (e.g., a right-handed pitcher facing a left-handed 
hitter), the pitch can crack and split a hitter's bat hence the pitch's 
occasional nickname of "the buzzsaw." Ryan Klesko, then of the Atlanta 
Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World 
Series while facing Mariano Rivera. A few switch hitters have even been 
known to bat right-handed against the right-handed Rivera (the "wrong" 
side; switch hitters generally bat from the side of home plate opposite 
to the pitcher's throwing hand).[4][5] In 2011, Dan Haren led all major 
league starting pitchers with nearly 48% of his pitches classified by PITCHf/x 
as cutters. Roy Halladay was close behind at 45%.[6] Other pitchers who 
rely heavily on a cut fastball include Jon Lester, James Shields, Josh 
Tomlin, Mark Melancon, Jaime Garcia, Kenley Jansen, David Robertson, and 
Andy Pettitte.[7][8][9] The cutter has achieved a boost in popularity in 
recent years due to its use by certain pitchers, such as Dan Haren, as 
a way to compensate for declining four-seam fastball speed as the pitcher 
ages.[1] Braves third baseman Chipper Jones attributed the increased dominance 
of pitchers from 2010–2011 to a more prolific use of the pitch, as did 
Cleveland Indians pitcher Chris Perez.[10][11] By 2011, it was commonly 
being called the "pitch du jour" in the baseball press.[7][12] A backlash 
developed as the cutter's use became more widespread, due to concerns that 
a pitcher overusing the pitch could develop arm fatigue.[13] Baltimore 
Orioles General Manager Dan Duquette instructed prized prospect Dylan Bundy 
not to throw the pitch in the minor leagues, believing that its adoption
