Charles Herbert "Red" Ruffing (May 3, 1905 – February 17, 1986) was an 
American professional baseball player. A pitcher, he played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) from 1924 through 1947. He played for the Boston Red Sox, 
New York Yankees, and Chicago White Sox. Ruffing is most remembered for 
his time with the highly successful Yankees teams of the 1930s and 1940s. 
Ruffing dropped out of school as a child to work in a coal mine in his 
native Illinois. He played for the mine's company baseball team as an outfielder 
and first baseman. After he lost four toes from his left foot in a mining 
accident, he became unable to run in the field, and switched to pitching. 
He played in minor league baseball in 1923 and 1924 before making his MLB 
debut with the Red Sox. After struggling with Boston, pitching to a 36–93 
win–loss record, the Red Sox traded Ruffing to the Yankees, where he became 
successful, pitching as the Yankees' ace through 1946. After one season 
with the White Sox, Ruffing retired from pitching to work in coaching. 
He served as a bullpen coach for the White Sox, a pitching coach for the 
New York Mets, and a scout and minor league instructor for the Cleveland 
Indians. Ruffing was a member of six World Series championship teams with 
the Yankees. He also appeared in six MLB All-Star Games. He was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1967. The Yankees dedicated a plaque 
to Ruffing in Monument Park in 2004. Ruffing was born on May 3, 1905, in 
Granville, Illinois.[1] He was one of five children. His parents, John 
and Louise Ruffing, emigrated to the United States from Germany.[1] Ruffing 
was raised in Coalton, Illinois[1] and Nokomis, Illinois.[2] He went to 
school in Nokomis.[1] His father was a coal miner, working in a mine in 
Coalton, Illinois, until he suffered a broken back. John became the superintendent 
of the mine, and also served as mayor of Coalton.[1] Red quit school at 
the age of 13 to work for his father in the mine, earning $3 per day ($47 
in current dollar terms), working as a coupler. Conditions in the mine 
were dangerous. Red's cousin, who also worked in the mine, died in an accident.[1] 
He also played baseball as an outfielder and first baseman for the mine's 
company team,[1][3] and for a semi-professional team in Nokomis.[4][5] 
When Ruffing was 15 years old, he suffered an accident in the mine, where 
his left foot was crushed between two cars. Though the doctor was able 
to save his foot, Red lost four toes.[1][3] He was supposed to begin his 
professional baseball career in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League 
that year, but he found himself unable to run as fast as he previously 
could.[3] Doc Bennett, the manager of a nearby semi-professional team, 
suggested that Ruffing should try to continue pursuing a baseball career 
by becoming a pitcher.[1] Bennett helped arrange for Ruffing to sign his 
first professional contract when he reached the age of 18. Ruffing signed 
with the Danville Veterans of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, a minor 
league baseball team in the Class B designation level. With Danville, Ruffing 
had a 12–16 win–loss record. After pitching for Danville in the 1923 season, 
the Boston Red Sox purchased Ruffing from Danville for $4,000 ($55,648 
in current dollar terms).[1][3] The Red Sox assigned Ruffing to the Dover 
Senators of the Class D Eastern Shore League to pitch at the start of the 
1924 season.[1] He had a 4–7 record for Dover.[3] Ruffing made his major 
league debut with the Red Sox on May 31, 1924. He pitched without earning 
a decision in over 23 innings pitched, and had a 6.65 earned run average 
(ERA).[6] He saw regular playing time with the Red Sox over the next few 
years but had limited success. He had a 9–18 win-loss record with a 5.01 
ERA in the 1925 season, as the Red Sox finished in last place in the eight 
team American League (AL).[7] Ruffing had a 6–15 win-loss record and a 
4.39 ERA in the 1926 season,[8] and a 5–13 win-loss record with a 4.66 
ERA in the 1927 season,[9] with the Red Sox finishing in last place both 
years. His best season to date, in terms of earned run performance, came 
in 1928, when he posted a 3.89 ERA. However, he led the AL in earned runs 
allowed, with 125, and had a 10–25 win-loss record, which led the AL in 
losses.[1][10] On a positive note, he also led the AL with 25 complete 
games.[4] As Ruffing had a .314 batting average during the 1928 season, 
the Red Sox and Ruffing considered having him shift to the outfield. The 
team decided against a position change due to the limitations of Ruffing's 
left foot.[1][3] The Red Sox chose Ruffing to be their Opening Day starting 
pitcher for the 1929 season.[11] During the 1929 season, he again led the 
AL in losses, with 22, and earned runs, with 135.[12] He won only nine 
games.[13] Ruffing often had difficulty pitching more than five innings 
in a game.[14] Someone in the Red Sox organization suggested to Ruffing 
that he should try to gain weight by drinking beer, which saw him grow 
from 185 pounds (84 kg) to 240 pounds (110 kg).[3] During the 1930 season, 
Bob Quinn, the owner of the Red Sox, was in debt and afraid he would lose 
the team due to foreclosure. To raise capital, he traded Ruffing to the 
New York Yankees for reserve outfielder Cedric Durst, $50,000 ($709,462 
in current dollar terms), and a $50,000 loan from Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees' 
owner.[1] Ruffing ended his five-and-a-half year tenure with the Red Sox 
with a 39–93 win-loss record;[3][4] his winning percentage (.289) was lower 
than that of the Red Sox during his tenure (.344).[1] Miller Huggins, who 
served as the Yankees' manager through 1929, had attempted to acquire Ruffing 
from the Red Sox for the last couple years of his Yankees' tenure. When 
Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield, Huggins 
told him he should continue as a pitcher.[3] Bob Shawkey, a former pitcher 
who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930, had convinced 
Ed Barrow, the Yankees' general manager, to acquire Ruffing. Shawkey believed 
he could change Ruffing's approach to pitching to obtain better results.[14] 
Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery, so that Ruffing 
used his body more. This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later 
innings of the game.[1][14] The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned 
as one of the most lopsided trades in baseball history; Durst was a reserve 
outfielder who always batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used.[15] 
The 1930 season proved to be Durst's last year in the majors.[16] Ruffing 
had a 0–3 record with the Red Sox before the trade. He won 15 games for 
the Yankees after the trade, losing only five games.[4][14] The Yankees 
chose Ruffing as their starting pitcher for Opening Day in 1931.[17] During 
the 1931 season, Ruffing had a 16–14 win-loss record with a 4.41 ERA. The 
Yankees finished the season in second place.[18] On August 13, 1932, Ruffing 
threw a complete game shutout and hit a home run in the tenth inning off 
of Washington Senators' pitcher Tommy Thomas to give the New York Yankees 
a 1–0 victory.[19] Ruffing became the first pitcher in major league history 
to win a game 1–0, hit a home run in the game, and strike out ten or more 
batters. Two other pitchers have since achieved this feat: Early Wynn in 
1957, and Yovani Gallardo, who did it in 2009.[20] Ruffing won 18 games 
during the 1932 season. He had a 3.09 ERA, second in the AL only to Lefty 
Grove's 2.84. Ruffing had 190 strikeouts, which led the AL.[1][21] The 
Yankees won their first pennant since 1928. Ruffing won his first World 
Series game during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs.[22] 
He started Game One, and the Yankees swept the Cubs four games to zero.[23] 
Ruffing had a 9–14 win-loss record with a 3.91 ERA in the 1933 season, 
as the Yankees finished in second place in the AL.[24] He threw a one-hitter 
on June 20, 1934, against the Cleveland Indians.[25] Two weeks later, Joe 
Cronin selected Ruffing for the 1934 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. 
At that point, he had a 9–3 win-loss record on the season.[26] He finished 
the season with a 19–11 win-loss record, as the Yankees finished second 
in the AL.[27] Ruffing pitched to a 16–11 record in the 1935 season, as 
the Yankees again finished second in the AL.[28] His 3.12 ERA was third 
in the league, behind only Grove and Ted Lyons.[29] Ruffing won 20 games 
during the 1936 season.[4] His 3.85 ERA was the sixth-best in the league, 
and his 20 wins tied him for third place, with Johnny Allen and Wes Ferrell, 
behind Tommy Bridges and Vern Kennedy.[30] He started Game One of the 1936 
World Series against the New York Giants,[31] but lost. The Yankees defeated 
the Giants four games to two.[32] In a salary dispute with the Yankees, 
Ruffing did not report to spring training, and he held out at the start 
of the 1937 season, missing the first month. He signed in May, receiving 
a $15,000 salary ($247,326 in current dollar terms).[33] Ruffing had a 
20–7 win-loss record for the Yankees in 1937.[34] He finished with the 
fourth-best ERA in the league, 2.98, trailing Lefty Gomez, Monty Stratton, 
and Allen, and his 20 wins were second only to Gomez, who had 21.[35] His 
performance earned him eighth place in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award 
voting.[36] He started Game Two in the 1937 World Series, earning the victory, 
as the Yankees defeated the Giants four games to one.[37] The Yankees started 
Ruffing on Opening Day for the 1938 season.[38] He was again named an All-Star 
during the 1938 season. Yankees' manager Joe McCarthy, who managed the 
AL team in the All-Star Game, chose teammate Lefty Gomez as the starting 
pitcher. As McCarthy did not believe in pitching two players from the same 
team in an All-Star Game, Ruffing did not appear in the game.[39][40] He 
led the AL with 21 wins in the 1938 season. He also tied for the AL lead 
in shutouts during with three, while his 3.31 ERA was third-best in the 
league, behind only Grove.[4][41][42] Ruffing pitched the opening game 
of the 1938 World Series against the Cubs.[43] He won two games in the 
series as the Yankees defeated the Cubs.[22][44] Ruffing finished fourth 
in AL MVP voting for the 1938 season.[45] McCarthy named Ruffing to be 
the starting pitcher for the Yankees on Opening Day in 1939.[46] McCarthy, 
managing the AL All-Star team that year, also selected Ruffing as his starter 
for the 1939 MLB All-Star Game.[47] He missed several weeks late in the 
1939 season due to an arm injury,[43] but managed to start Game One of 
the 1939 World Series. He defeated the Cincinnati Redlegs in that game, 
and the Yankees won the series in a four games to zero sweep.[48] Ruffing 
won 21 games during the 1939 season.[49] His four shutouts in the 1939 
season again tied him for the AL lead,[4] while he finished second in wins 
behind Bob Feller, and fourth in ERA (2.93) behind Grove, Lyons, and Feller.[50] 
He finished fifth in the balloting for the AL MVP.[51] Ruffing was the 
Yankees' Opening Day starting pitcher in 1940.[52] He was named to the 
1940 All-Star team, and Cronin, acting as manager, selected Ruffing as 
his starting pitcher.[53][54] Ruffing finished the season with a 15–12 
win-loss record.[55] Ruffing was a member of the 1941 All-Star team as 
well, but he did not pitch in the game.[56] He had a 15–6 win-loss record 
during the 1941 season, and was named the starting pitcher for Game One 
of the 1941 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[57] Ruffing defeated 
the Dodgers, as the Yankees won the series four games to one.[58] Ruffing 
pitched for the Yankees during Opening Day of the 1942 season.[59] On the 
year, he compiled a 14–7 win-loss record. He was again named an All-Star, 
and again did not pitch in the All-Star Game, which was started by teammate 
Spud Chandler.[60] Though teammate Tiny Bonham had a better season, pitching 
to a 21–5 win-loss record, McCarthy again chose Ruffing as his Game One 
starter for the 1942 World Series,[61][62] setting a record with six World 
Series Game One starts that stood until Whitey Ford started his seventh 
Game One in the 1963 World Series.[63] Ruffing defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 
in Game One, his seventh World Series victory. This set a record that was 
surpassed by Ford in 1960.[1] Ruffing pitched again in the Game Five, with 
the Yankees down three games to one. Ruffing lost the game, as the Cardinals 
defeated the Yankees to win the series.[22][64] After the 1942 season, 
Ruffing took a job with Vultee Aircraft, a defense contractor. Despite 
his age (37) and missing toes, a United States Army doctor certified Ruffing 
as Class 1-B in the Selective Service System, overruled Ruffing's personal 
physician, who had ruled Ruffing unfit for service. The Army decided that 
Ruffing could serve in a non-combat role.[1][65] Ruffing missed the 1943 
and 1944 seasons due to his service during World War II. He served in the 
Sixth Ferrying Group of the Air Transport Command of the United States 
Army Air Forces at the rank of private. However, he did pitch for the Air 
Transport Command's baseball team, throwing a perfect game against Joe 
DiMaggio's team,[66] and leading his team to the championship against Ted 
Lyons' team.[67] In 1944, he played with an All-Star team for troops stationed 
in Hawaii.[1] Ruffing turned forty years of age during the war, resulting 
in his discharge in June 1945.[68][69] He rejoined the Yankees that month, 
signing for the same $20,000 salary ($263,327 in current dollar terms) 
he earned in 1942.[70] He made his first appearance with the Yankees since 
the 1942 season in July 1945.[71] Pitching for the Yankees as a spot starter 
in 1946, he had a 5–1 win-loss record and a 1.77 ERA when he suffered a 
broken kneecap from a line drive hit by Hank Majeski, and missed the remainder 
of the season.[1] In total, Ruffing won 231 games with the Yankees. This 
mark was the most in franchise history, until Ford surpassed it in 1965.[72] 
He remains the winningest right-handed pitcher in Yankees' history.[73] 
Suffering from recurrent knee injuries, the Yankees released Ruffing after 
the 1946 season. He signed with the Chicago White Sox for the 1947 season,[74] 
but continued to be limited by his knee. In May, the White Sox removed 
Ruffing from their active roster after he was hit in his bad knee with 
another line drive.[75] He rejoined the White Sox' active roster in July.[76] 
He pitched to a 3–5 win–loss record and a 6.11 ERA in nine games pitched 
on the season.[77] Ruffing retired after the 1947 season.[4] Ruffing finished 
his career with 273 wins, 225 losses, 1,987 strikeouts and a 3.80 ERA.[4] 
He also had 16 saves.[78] Ruffing compiled 335 complete games in his 536 
games started.[79] Ruffing could also handle the bat very well compared 
to most other pitchers, hitting 36 home runs and batting .269 in 1,937 
career at-bats. He hit over .300 in eight different seasons, and was frequently 
used as a pinch hitter in games he did not pitch.[4] He also played in 
the outfield in emergency situations.[80] Ruffing's home run total as a 
pitcher trails only Ferrell, Warren Spahn, and Bob Lemon.[81] Ruffing holds 
the AL record for most runs and earned runs allowed.[82] Ruffing threw 
a fastball, a "sharp" curveball, and a slider.[78] According to AL umpire 
Bill Summers, "[O]n account of Red Ruffing, the slider got to be the thing."[1] 
Joe Paparella, also an AL umpire, said "The first game I ever worked behind 
the plate in the major leagues was against the guy who invented the slider 
and had the best slider ever seen — Red Ruffing".[78] After he retired 
from pitching, Ruffing stayed with the White Sox organization to instruct 
their players. The White Sox named Ruffing the manager of their Class A 
minor league affiliate, the Muskegon Clippers of the Central League, for 
the 1949 season.[83] That season, the Clippers finished in fifth place 
out of six teams.[84] In 1950, Ruffing managed the Daytona Beach Islanders 
of the Florida State League, a Cleveland Indians' affiliate.[85][86] When 
Al Simmons retired from his coaching position with the Indians just before 
the 1951 season due to his failing health, bullpen coach Jake Flowers was 
moved to the third base coaching position, and Ruffing took over Flowers's 
duties.[86][87] From 1952 through 1961, Ruffing was a player personnel 
executive for the Indians. Ruffing returned to the baseball field serving 
as pitching coach for the expansion New York Mets in 1962,[88] which were 
run by George Weiss, the general manager, and Casey Stengel, the manager. 
Weiss and Stengel had held the same positions with the Yankees during Ruffing's 
tenure.[1] As a team, the Mets had a 5.04 ERA across the 1962 season, which 
was the worst in the major leagues. The job also involved scouting duties, 
which Ruffing did not like, and he retired shortly after the season ended.[1] 
He returned to baseball again for the 1969 season, at the request of former 
teammate Don Heffner, who was managing the Denver Bears of the American 
Association. Ruffing served as Heffner's pitching coach.[5] Ruffing married 
Pauline Mulholland, a native of Chicago, at the end of the 1934 season. 
The couple settled in Long Beach, California.[3] When he worked for the 
Indians in the 1950s, the Ruffing family relocated to Cleveland. The couple 
had a son, named Charles, Jr.[1] Ruffing suffered a stroke in 1974, at 
the age of 68, which left him paralyzed on his left side. As a result, 
he used a wheelchair for the remainder of his life.[1][89] This was Ruffing's 
second stroke, and he also suffered from kidney and heart problems.[4] 
He contracted skin cancer, necessitating the partial amputation of one 
of his ears. He died on February 17, 1986, at Hillcrest Hospital in Mayfield 
Heights, Ohio, of heart failure.[1][90] In balloting for the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame following his retirement, Ruffing often received votes from 
approximately 50% of the voters in the Baseball Writers' Association of 
America, short of the 75% required for induction. Bob Feller wrote an article 
in The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, calling Ruffing, Satchel Paige, and 
Luke Appling the three most deserving players who had yet to be elected.[1] 
The balloting of 1967 was Ruffing's final year of eligibility, as he had 
retired twenty years prior. Ruffing finished with 212 votes, tied with 
Joe Medwick for the highest vote count, but was seven votes short of the 
219 required for induction.[91] However, a runoff election held the next 
month saw Ruffing into the Hall of Fame the next month.[92] During an Old-Timers' 
Day ceremony held on July 10, 2004 at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees dedicated 
a plaque in Ruffing's memory. The plaque is displayed in Monument Park.[73] 
ESPN.com ranked Ruffing as the ninth greatest Yankee of all time.[93] A 
museum in Nokomis, Illinois, the Bottomley-Ruffing-Schalk Museum, is dedicated 
to Ruffing and fellow Hall of Famers Ray Schalk and Jim Bottomley.[94]
