Thomas David Henrich (February 20, 1913 – December 1, 2009), nicknamed 
"The Clutch" and "Old Reliable", was an American professional baseball 
player. He played his entire Major League Baseball career as a right fielder 
and first baseman for the New York Yankees (1937–1942 and 1946–1950). Henrich 
led the American League in triples twice and in runs scored once, also 
hitting 20 or more home runs four times. He is best remembered for his 
numerous exploits in the World Series; he was involved in one of the most 
memorable plays in Series history in 1941, was the hitting star of the 
1947 Series with a .323 batting average, and hit the first walk-off home 
run in Series history in the first game of the 1949 World Series. Henrich 
batted left and threw left. Throughout much of his career he claimed to 
have been born in 1916, saying later that this was to make up for the three 
years that he lost by playing softball instead of baseball. He was signed 
by the Cleveland Indians in 1934, but was ruled a free agent in April 1937 
after he and his father wrote to Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, 
who decided that the Indians had illegally concealed him in their farm 
system. He signed for the Yankees, and also pocketed a $25,000 bonus.[1] 
He debuted with the Yankees – his longtime favorite team – in 1937, hitting 
.320 in 67 games, and gradually replaced George Selkirk in right field. 
In his first four seasons he posted productive if unspectacular totals, 
peaking with 22 home runs and 91 runs batted in in 1938 and batting .307 
in 1940. But on a team which featured Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Bill Dickey 
and Joe Gordon, Henrich's contributions were of a decidedly supporting 
nature as he competed for playing time with Selkirk and Charlie Keller. 
In the 1938 World Series against the Chicago Cubs, manager Joe McCarthy 
placed him third in the batting order; he batted .250 and had a solo home 
run late in Game 4 as the Yankees swept the Series. He did not appear in 
the 1937 or 1939 World Series, also won by the Yankees. Henrich broke out 
with a 1941 season in which he had a career-high 31 homers – third in the 
AL behind Ted Williams and Keller – and was fifth in the league with 106 
runs. Facing the Brooklyn Dodgers in the World Series, he singled and scored 
in a 2-run eighth inning in Game 3, and New York hung on to win 2-1. But 
one of the most famous moments in postseason history occurred when he came 
to the plate with two out in the ninth inning of Game 4; Brooklyn had a 
4-3 lead, one out away from tying the Series. Henrich swung at a full-count 
breaking curveball for strike three, but catcher Mickey Owen couldn't handle 
the ball, which got past him (see photo); Henrich began to move toward 
first base almost as soon as he saw the ball had dropped sharply, and when 
he saw it get past Owen he took off running. DiMaggio then singled, and 
Keller doubled to score both runners and take the lead; Gordon later doubled 
to bring in two more runs, and the Yankees had a 7-4 victory and a 3-1 
Series lead. Henrich had a solo home run in Game 5 as the Yankees took 
the game 3-1, and won another championship. He made his first AL All-Star 
team in 1942, but again didn't appear in the World Series. He went on to 
miss the 1943 through 1945 seasons while serving in the Coast Guard in 
Sault Ste Marie MI during World War II. While there, he volunteered as 
the girls high school basketball coach at Loretto Catholic High School. 
Upon returning in 1946 he batted only .251, but finished among the league's 
top ten players in walks (87), runs (92), homers (19) and RBI (83). With 
Dickey and Gordon gone, he began to bear a greater share of the responsibility 
for the team's offense in 1947, and came through quite effectively as he 
formed one of the game's great outfields with Keller in left field and 
DiMaggio in center. He led the AL with 13 triples and was second with 109 
runs and 98 RBI; he was also third in doubles (35) and fourth in slugging 
average (.485) and total bases (267). Again facing the Dodgers in the Series, 
he had a pair of RBI in the Game 1 victory, and a solo homer in the 10-3 
Game 2 win. He came to the plate with the score tied 2-2, the bases loaded 
and two out in the fourth inning of Game 7, and drove in Phil Rizzuto with 
the deciding run in a 5-2 win. Henrich then enjoyed his best years, gradually 
moving from the outfield to first base. He hit .308 with 25 HRs and 100 
RBI in 1948, leading the league in triples (14) and runs (138) and finishing 
second in doubles (42) and total bases (326) and third in slugging (.554); 
he tied an AL record with four grand slams, and placed sixth in the MVP 
voting. He was again sixth in the MVP balloting in 1949 after placing third 
in the AL in HRs (24) and slugging (.526), often getting crucial hits late 
in the season as the Yankees captured another flag under new manager Casey 
Stengel. The new skipper succeeded in getting Henrich to avoid outside 
curveballs by threatening to send him back to the minor leagues, and he 
picked up two RBI in a 5-3 win over the Boston Red Sox on the season's 
last day, giving New York the pennant by a single game. He caught the final 
out when Birdie Tebbetts hit a foul popup near first base. Meeting the 
Dodgers for a final time in the Series, he gave New York a 1-0 victory 
in Game 1 when he homered against Don Newcombe on a 2-0 pitch to lead off 
the ninth inning, the first walk-off home run ever in the World Series. 
He scored twice in the 10-6 win in Game 5 as the Yankees again took the 
championship. Henrich was an All-Star in each of his last four seasons. 
Henrich retired after batting .272 with 6 home runs and 34 RBI in a 1950 
season during which he was injured most of the year. In an 11-season career, 
he was a .282 hitter with a .491 slugging average, 183 home runs, 901 runs, 
795 RBI, 1297 hits, 269 doubles, 73 triples and 37 stolen bases in 1284 
games. He was dubbed "Old Reliable" – after a train which ran from Ohio 
to Alabama – by Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen for his knack of getting 
a hit just when it was needed. He later became a coach with the Yankees 
(1951), New York Giants (1957) and Detroit Tigers (1958–59), and worked 
as a color commentator for ABC television's baseball coverage in 1965. 
Henrich received the Pride of The Yankees Award in 1987, presented annually 
by the club to memorable figures in the organizations' history. At his 
death Henrich was the fifth oldest living MLB player and was the last surviving 
member of the 1938 World Champion New York Yankees. There were no living 
former baseball players who played on the winning team in an earlier World 
Series. He was also Lou Gehrig's final surviving teammate. Tommy Henrich 
died at the age of 96 on December 1, 2009, after being weakened by a series 
of strokes he suffered in recent years. he is buried in Dayton National
