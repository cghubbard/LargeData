In baseball, striking out the side refers to when a pitcher records three 
strikeouts resulting in outs in the defensive half-inning in which he pitches. 
There is no official statistic in regard to this accomplishment, though 
it is often noted by commentators and fans when it occurs. There is a disagreement 
as to the exact definition of striking out the side. Some feel a pitcher 
should be credited with striking out the side when all three outs in the 
inning were obtained via the strikeout, regardless of what other hitters 
the pitcher has faced have done. Others believe a pitcher only has struck 
out the side when he has retired 3 batters in succession without allowing 
anyone to reach base. In theory, a pitcher can record any number of strikeouts 
in an inning, since it is possible for a batter to safely reach first base 
without recording an out if the catcher does not hold the third strike. 
Recording more than three strikeouts in an inning, however, is a rare occurrence. 
An immaculate inning is the rare feat of retiring all three batters faced 
in an inning on strikeouts with only nine pitches thrown. http://blogs.thescore.com/djf/2013/07/31/steve-delabars-immaculate-inning-from-last-night/
