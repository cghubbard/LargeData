The 2004 Minnesota Twins met their goal of three-peating as American League 
Central Division champions. The team was able to do this in spite of several 
new players and the absence of three former all-stars. Closer Eddie Guardado, 
set-up man LaTroy Hawkins, starter Eric Milton, and catcher A. J. Pierzynski 
had all been dealt prior to the beginning of the season, while first baseman 
Doug Mientkiewicz was traded midway through the season. The season had 
both highs – such as Johan Santana winning the Cy Young Award – and lows, 
such as highly anticipated rookie catcher Joe Mauer injuring his knee and 
playing for only 35 games. For the second year in a row, the team was not 
able to carry its regular season success into the post-season. The New 
York Yankees eliminated the Twins for the second year in a row in four 
games in the 2004 American League Division Series. For a playoff team, 
the offense was not strong. This was partly due to injuries and starters 
absent from the lineup. Lew Ford surprised many by batting .299 in his 
first full year in the major leagues. Free agent acquisition José Offerman 
saw a majority of time in the designated hitter spot, but hit only .256 
with two home runs. Shannon Stewart did hit .304, but injuries limited 
him to 378 at bats. In 107 at bats, Mauer was able to hit .307. In his 
absence, catcher Henry Blanco hit only .206. First baseman Doug Mientkiewicz's 
hitting continued to decline, as he hit .246 with five home runs before 
being dealt to the Boston Red Sox. Nine players hit ten or more home runs. 
When the Twins hit their record 225 homers in 1963, only eight players 
reached double figures. Brad Radke was the opening day starter, but he 
was soon overshadowed by Johan Santana's Cy Young year. Radke, Santana, 
and Carlos Silva anchored the starting rotation. Unfortunately, Kyle Lohse 
had a bad year that saw his ERA balloon to 5.34, while the fifth spot in 
the rotation was nebulous. (41-year-old Terry Mulholland made 15 starts, 
while Seth Greisinger made nine.) The Twins set their club record of 32 
consecutive scoreless innings in June, which included back-to-back-to-back 
shutouts by Radke, Santana and Lohse. In the bullpen, Joe Nathan blew everyone 
away during his first year as a closer at any level, earning 44 saves with 
a 1.62 ERA. Juan Rincón and J. C. Romero continued playing as excellent 
set-up men, while the rest of the bullpen was weaker. Romero set a Twins 
record by going 36 innings over 32 appearances without allowing a run to 
score. Santana finished the year with thirteen straight wins without a 
loss, then went 1-0 with a no-decision in the American League Division 
Series. He set the Twins record with 265 strikeouts this season. Blanco 
and Mauer (when he played) were solid catchers, both with .991 fielding 
percentages. Mientkiewicz was a one-time Gold Glove winner, but his successor 
Justin Morneau surprised people with his .995 fielding percentage. Luis 
Rivas was dependable at second base, while Cristian Guzmán could turn exceptional 
plays at shortstop. (It was the routine ones that fooled him.) Corey Koskie 
was defensively average, while the outfield quartet of Hunter, Jacque Jones, 
Shannon Stewart and Ford were solid – especially Hunter, who won a Gold 
Glove. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Infielders 
Coaches The Twins entered and exited the postseason almost exactly the 
same as the previous season, losing to the Yankees, 3 games to 1. The Yankees 
would go on to be upset by the Boston Red Sox on their way to breaking 
the curse. See 2004 American League Division Series. Note: Pos = Position;
