Bob R. Simpson is an American businessman. He is the co-founder of XTO 
Energy and co-owner of the Texas Rangers Major League Baseball (MLB) team. 
In 1985, Simpson founded Cross Timbers Oil Company and has served as Chairman 
of the Board since July 1, 1996.[1] In 2001, the name of the company was 
changed to XTO Energy. In 2009 XTO Energy was ranked 325th on the Forbes 
Global 2000.[1] In December 2009, ExxonMobil announced a proposal to acquire 
XTO Energy for $41 billion.[2] The merger was completed in June 2010.[3] 
In August 2010, Simpson and another Texas oil magnate, Ray Davis, served 
as co-lead investors in the $593 million winning bid to take the Texas 
Rangers baseball team out of bankruptcy.[4] Simpson and Davis initially 
remained in the background, leaving the Rangers in the hands of managing 
partner and CEO Chuck Greenberg and President Nolan Ryan. They served largely 
as senior consultants, an arrangement that continued after Greenberg resigned 
in 2011, making Ryan the undisputed day-to-day head of the franchise.[5] 
In October 2010, the Texas Rangers played in the World Series for the first 
time in franchise history, but lost the series to the San Francisco Giants.[6] 
In October 2011, the team again reached the World Series, but lost again, 
this time to the St. Louis Cardinals.[7] Ryan left the ownership group 
in 2013, but Davis and Simpson have mostly left the Rangers in the hands 
of former General Manager and now team President Jon Daniels and have rarely 
interfered. Simpson received a BS in accounting and an MBA from Baylor 
University.[8] He was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award in 2010.[9] 
In 2012, Simpson, along with his wife Janice, started a record label for 
emerging musicians named RayLynn Records. Hear Me, the debut album from 
up and coming rock musician Kyle Sherman, was the first recording produced
