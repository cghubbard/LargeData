Juan Cespedes Uribe Tena (born March 22, 1979) is a Dominican professional 
baseball third baseman who is currently a free agent. He stands 6 feet 
(1.8 m) tall and weighs 235 pounds (107 kg). He previously played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Colorado Rockies, Chicago White Sox, San 
Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and 
Cleveland Indians. He bats and throws right-handed. Uribe began his professional 
career in 1997 when he was signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing 
through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He 
became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. 
He missed part of 2003 with an injury and was traded to the Chicago White 
Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became 
the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position 
for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team 
won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home 
runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 
but had a low batting average with runners in scoring position (RISP). 
In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and 
shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei 
Ramírez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due 
to an injury to Joe Crede. In 2009, Uribe signed with the Giants and was 
again used as utility player. He spent most of 2010 as the Giants' shortstop, 
hit a career-high 24 home runs, and had several key hits in the playoffs 
as the Giants won the 2010 World Series. Following that season, he signed 
a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The next two years 
were plagued by injuries and poor hitting, but he regained his starting 
role at third base and made strong contributions to the team in 2013 and 
2014. Uribe was traded to the Braves in late May of the 2015 season and 
again to the Mets in July of the 2015 season. Before the start of spring 
training in 2016, he signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Indians. 
He was injured by a ground ball on June 12, 2016 and was later diagnosed 
with a testicular contusion. The Indians designated him for assignment 
on August 1 and released him on August 5. Uribe was born in Baní, Dominican 
Republic. Growing up, he became interested in baseball partly due to José 
Uribe. José was Juan's second cousin, although Juan calls him his "uncle" 
because of their age difference.[1] When Major League Baseball (MLB) was 
not in season, José would come home to the Dominican Republic and tell 
Juan about his time in the majors playing shortstop for the San Francisco 
Giants. Juan proved to have baseball ability too. In 1997, Colorado Rockies 
scout Jorge Posada, Sr., spotted Uribe while he was scouting pitcher Enemencio 
Pacheco. Posada offered him a $5,000 contract, but Uribe and his father 
tried to get a higher amount from agent Bob Michelin. Eventually, Uribe 
settled for $5,000.[2][3][4] Uribe started his professional career playing 
in the Dominican Summer League (DSL) for the DSL Rockies. In 1998 and 1999, 
he played for the rookie-level Arizona Rookie League and the Single-A Asheville 
Tourists in the South Atlantic League. While in Asheville, he batted .392 
with 28 doubles, compiling a 15-game hitting streak at one point in the 
season. Uribe played for the Single-A advanced Salem Avalanche of the Carolina 
League in 2000, batting .256 with 13 home runs.[3] Following the season, 
Baseball America named him the number two prospect in the Rockies' organization.[5] 
In 2001, he was called up by the Rockies.[3] Uribe played 72 games for 
the Rockies in his rookie season of 2001. He batted .300, had eight home 
runs, and had 53 runs batted in (RBIs). He also had 11 triples, tying a 
club record held by Neifi Pérez and Juan Pierre. He made his major league 
debut on April 8, pinch-hitting and striking out against Jay Witasick in 
an 11–3 loss to the San Diego Padres.[6] Three days later, he had his first 
major league hit against Matt Morris in a 3–1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.[7] 
He was sent down to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Pacific 
Coast League a few times during the season. However, after July 25 he took 
over the shortstop position for the Rockies when they traded Pérez. On 
August 2, he hit his first major league home run against Dave Coggin in 
a 4–2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies.[8] He tied three other franchise 
records with two hits, two extra base hits, and six total bases in a single 
inning during an October 7 game against the San Diego Padres.[3] Uribe 
played his first full season in the majors for the Rockies in 2002. He 
started 150 games at shortstop, posting a .240 average, six home runs, 
49 RBIs, and 25 doubles. He had a 17-game hitting streak during the months 
of April and May, a career high. However, his offensive production slumped 
from May through August, and he also played poor defensive, leading the 
team with 27 errors.[9] Uribe saw a little improvement offensively late 
in the season, though, as he tied a career high for hits in a game with 
four on September 17 in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim; 
he finished that game a home run short of the cycle.[3] In 2003, Uribe 
did not play until June 3 because of an injury suffered when he was rounding 
the bases during a spring training game on March 1. In his first game back, 
he homered twice against Ricardo Rodríguez of the Cleveland Indians.[10] 
He began to play in the outfield for the Rockies, starting at center field 
on June 15. However, he returned to the shortstop position when José Hernández 
was traded.[9] In 87 games, he batted .253 with 80 hits, 19 doubles, 10 
home runs, and 33 RBIs.[3] Uribe was traded to the Chicago White Sox on 
December 2, 2003, for Aaron Miles.[9] Although Uribe did not have a starting 
role at the beginning of his tenure with the White Sox, he wound up appearing 
in 134 games for them in 2004, playing second base, shortstop, and third 
base.[11] On June 19, he had seven RBIs (one short of the White Sox single-game 
record) in a 17–14 loss to the Montreal Expos.[12] He set many career highs 
in batting categories, including batting average with the bases loaded 
(.556), RISP (.340), batting average (.283), home runs (23), RBIs (74), 
hits (142), and runs (82). He played much better at home, batting .315 
with six home runs compared to .248 with seven home runs on the road.[3] 
On December 16, he agreed to a contract extension through 2008 with the 
White Sox.[13] In 2005, Uribe spent the entire season playing shortstop 
after the White Sox did not re-sign José Valentín.[3][14] In 146 games, 
a number that would have been higher had it not been for minor injuries, 
Uribe batted .252 with 121 hits, 23 doubles, 16 home runs, and 74 RBIs.[3] 
In Game 1 of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Uribe hit a home 
run and had three RBIs as the White Sox defeated the Boston Red Sox 14–2.[15] 
Uribe made two memorable defensive plays for the final two outs of the 
2005 World Series, first catching a ball while crashing into the third 
base stands and then ranging over the middle and firing an off-balance 
throw on a slow grounder to beat Houston Astro Orlando Palmeiro to give 
the White Sox their first title in 88 years.[16] On July 2, 2006, Uribe 
had five RBIs in a 15–11 loss to the Chicago Cubs;[17] two days later, 
he again had five RBIs in a 13–0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.[18] 
Uribe had one of his best power seasons in 2006, batting .235 with 21 home 
runs and 71 RBIs in 132 games. However, he had the lowest on-base percentage 
of his career, at .257.[3] Injuries prevented him from appearing 10 games, 
and he also lost some starts at shortstop to Alex Cintrón because of his 
low on-base percentage.[19] He led the White Sox in sacrifice hits and 
ranked fourth in the AL with a .977 fielding percentage. He also joined 
Derek Jeter, Miguel Tejada, Edgar Rentería, and Michael Young as the only 
shortstops to top 70 RBIs in '04, '05, and '06.[3] On September 29, 2007, 
Uribe had a walkoff RBI single against Fernando Rodney to give the White 
Sox a 3–2 win over the Detroit Tigers.[20] In 150 games in 2007, Uribe 
batted .234 with 120 hits, 18 doubles, 20 home runs, and 68 RBIs. He was 
second in the league in fielding percentage (.976), but he batted .198 
with runners in scoring position.[3] The White Sox declined Uribe's option, 
but on November 7, 2007, they signed him to a one-year, $4.5 million deal.[21] 
The White Sox acquired Orlando Cabrera to play shortstop in 2008, forcing 
Uribe to compete with Alexei Ramírez, Danny Richar, and Pablo Ozuna for 
the position in spring training.[22] Uribe won the second base job, but 
after an injury in May, Uribe lost his spot in the White Sox starting lineup 
to Ramírez.[23][24][25] However, Uribe took over third base from Josh Fields 
(who had spent a week filling in for an injured Joe Crede) on August 1.[24][26][27] 
In 110 games (324 at-bats), Uribe had 80 hits, 22 doubles, seven home runs, 
and 40 RBIs.[3] On October 30, Uribe filed for free agency.[28] While with 
the White Sox, Uribe was always regarded as a talented player. He was especially 
adept at fielding and hitting home runs. However, Ozzie Guillén had issues 
with Uribe's low on-base percentage and his conditioning.[22] On January 
29, 2009, Uribe signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants.[29] 
It was announced on April 4 that Uribe had made the Giants final roster 
as a utility player.[30] Uribe wound up making a lot of starts at second 
base, shortstop, and third base throughout the season.[31] On July 10, 
Uribe bobbled a ground ball with one out in the eighth inning of Jonathan 
Sánchez's no-hitter against San Diego, allowing Chase Headley to reach 
first base. The effort had been perfect up to that point, and Sánchez went 
on to retire each of the remaining five batters, meaning this error lost 
the first perfect game since Randy Johnson 's in 2004. This was the first 
no-hit, no-walk, no–hit batsman game that was not also a perfect game since 
Terry Mulholland's no-hitter in 1990.[32] In 122 games (398 at-bats), Uribe 
batted .289 (his highest average since 2001) with 115 hits, 26 doubles, 
16 home runs, and 55 RBIs.[3] In 2010, Uribe re-signed a one-year, $3.25 
million contract with the Giants.[33] He began 2010 as the Giants' second 
baseman because of an injury to Freddy Sanchez.[34] At the beginning of 
May, he moved over to shortstop to replace the injured Rentería; for most 
of the remainder of the season, he was the Giants' starting shortstop.[35][36] 
He hit a game-winning two-run home run on September 5 against Jonathan 
Broxton, turning a 4–3 deficit into a 5–4 victory over the Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[37] On September 23, Uribe hit a grand slam against Ryan Dempster 
and a two-run home run in the second inning against the Cubs for a total 
of six RBIs, helping the Giants win 13–0.[38] He finished the season batting 
.256 with a career-high 24 home runs and a career-high 85 RBIs. He had 
129 hits on the year in 521 at-bats, bringing his career hit total above 
the 1,000 mark. He had 24 doubles and 2 triples.[3] In Game 4 of the National 
League Championship Series against the Phillies on October 20, Uribe had 
a walk-off sacrifice fly against Roy Oswalt in a 6–5 victory.[39] In Game 
6, on October 23, he hit a go-ahead solo home run against Ryan Madson in 
the top of the eighth, which gave the Giants a 3–2 victory, sending them 
to the World Series.[40] In Game 1 of the World Series on October 27, he 
hit a three-run home run against Darren O'Day which proved decisive in 
the Giants' 11–7 victory over the Texas Rangers.[41] He produced an RBI 
that made it 2–0 against C. J. Wilson in the seventh inning of Game 2; 
he added another RBI in the eighth as the Giants won 9–0.[42] The Giants 
won the series in five games, and Uribe earned his second World Series 
championship.[43] After the 2010 season, Uribe reached an agreement on 
a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.[44] His first season 
with the Dodgers was one of his worst seasons as he made two trips to the 
disabled list and only managed to appear in 77 of 162 games, his fewest 
amount of games since 2001. His production was the weakest of his career, 
as he hit a subpar .204 with four home runs and 28 RBIs.[3] He was placed 
on the disabled list on July 30, with what was described as abdominal pain.[45] 
He was expected to return after 15 days, but the injury didn't get better 
and was recharacterized as a sports hernia, which needed season-ending 
surgery.[46] In the 2012 season, Uribe mostly stayed healthy but his production 
remained similar to his 2011 totals. From May 14 to June 10, he was on 
the disabled list with a left wrist injury.[47] After June, he lost his 
starting role and was relegated to pinch-hitting duties over the second 
half of the season.[48] He played in just 66 games and hit only .191 (his 
lowest career total) with two home runs and 17 RBIs.[3] Uribe began 2013 
as a utility player. However, he made frequent starts at third base, and 
by June, he had taken over the position.[49][50] On July 5, Uribe had seven 
RBIs and was a single short of hitting for the cycle in a 10–2 victory 
over the Giants.[51] On September 9, 2013, Uribe went four for four and 
homered in each of his first three trips to the plate against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. It was his first 3 home run game in the Major Leagues.[52] 
He played in 132 games for the Dodgers in 2013, almost as many as his first 
two seasons with them combined (143). He hit .278 with 12 homers and 50 
RBI.[3] On October 7, during Game 4 of the National League Division Series, 
Uribe hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the 8th inning to put Los 
Angeles ahead of the Atlanta Braves 4–3. The Dodgers held on to defeat 
the Braves and took the series 3–1. On December 14, 2013, Uribe agreed 
to a 2-year, $15 million contract extension with the Dodgers.[53] Uribe 
continued his resurgence in 2014, hitting .311 in 103 games. He also had 
9 home runs and 54 RBIs. Uribe was well-liked by his teammates, and hailed 
as a key part of maintaining clubhouse chemistry. Don Mattingly let him 
manage the Dodgers for the final game of the regular season, a 10–5 Dodgers 
win.[54] Uribe started slowly in 2015 and wound up falling behind both 
Justin Turner and Alex Guerrero on the depth chart.[55] In 29 games he 
hit .247 with one homer and six RBIs.[56] On May 27, 2015, Uribe was traded 
to the Atlanta Braves (with Chris Withrow) in exchange for Alberto Callaspo, 
Eric Stults, Ian Thomas and Juan Jaime.[57] The trade was finalized during 
the Braves' three-game series at Dodger Stadium, and Uribe appeared in 
his new team's uniform in the third game, going 0 for 3 in the Atlanta 
win.[58] When asked for an opinion on the trade, Uribe commented, "I would've 
felt bad if they traded me to a soccer, basketball or football team. But 
it's another baseball team, so I'm happy".[59] Uribe's popularity as a 
Dodger extended past his trade, as a scheduled bobblehead night went ahead 
as planned after he had left the team for the Braves.[60] On July 24, 2015, 
the Braves traded Uribe and Kelly Johnson to the New York Mets for John 
Gant and Rob Whalen.[61] During his second game with New York, Uribe hit 
the walk-off single in the tenth inning to win the game for the Mets, 3-2 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers.[62][63] Uribe missed the National League 
Division Series and National League Championship Series due to a chest 
contusion in September,[64] but was added to the Mets' World Series roster 
and came off the bench in the sixth inning of Game 3 to deliver a pinch-hit 
single, driving in a run.[65] Just before the start of spring training 
2016, Uribe signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the Cleveland Indians.[66] 
On June 12, 2016 in Anaheim, Uribe had to be carted off the field after 
being hit in the crotch by a ground ball which came off the bat of Mike 
Trout at 106 miles per hour (171 km/h).[67] He was later diagnosed with 
a testicular contusion.[68] He was designated for assignment on August 
1, 2016 and released on August 5. Uribe and his wife Ana have four children: 
Juan Luis, Juanny, Janny, and Johanny.[3] He also has a brother named Elpidio.[69] 
Uribe does not speak English well and has used a translator throughout 
his career when conducting interviews.[4][22] He plays winter baseball 
in the Dominican Republic every year. He has done work for many different 
charity organizations. In 2004, he read to children on the Golden Apple 
Foundation Bus. He also helped with the United States military children's 
coloring contest.[3] In October 2006, Uribe was alleged to have been involved 
in a shooting in his native Dominican Republic. A farmer named Antonio 
Gonzalez Perez accused Uribe of wounding him with a pellet gun. Despite 
claims by the San Cristóbal Province District Attorney that there was no 
firm evidence that Uribe was involved in the incident, a judge decided 
to press forward with the case. Although a defense motion to bar him from 
leaving the country was rejected, it was ruled on January 5, 2007, that 
Uribe must appear before a court on the 15 and the 30 of every month until 
the case was resolved. Uribe, who denied any involvement in the case, suggested 
that he might not play baseball until the legal proceedings were concluded. 
He was confident that he would win in court, and the White Sox expected 
him to be free for spring training.[70] In February, his name was cleared 
of any involvement with the shooting, and the court ruled he no longer 
had to appear on the 15 and 30 of every month. Uribe called the incident 
"blackmail", saying it was an attempt by Perez to get money from him.[69]
