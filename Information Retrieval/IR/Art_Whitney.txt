Arthur Wilson Whitney (January 16, 1858 – August 15, 1943) was an American 
professional baseball player whose career spanned from 1877 to 1893. He 
played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a third baseman 
(802 games) and shortstop (168 games), for eight different major league 
clubs. Whitney's longest stretches were with the Pittsburg Alleghenys (368 
games, 1884–1887) and New York Giants (219 games, 1888–1889). He helped 
the Giants win the 1888 and 1889 World Series. In 11 major league seasons, 
Whitney compiled a .223 batting average and a .285 on-base percentage, 
scored 475 runs, and had 820 hits, including 137 extra base hits. Whitney's 
true value, however, was as a defensive player on the infield. He four 
times led his league in fielding percentage, three times as a third baseman 
(1886, 1887, and 1891) and once as a shortstop (1885). In 1886, his Defensive 
WAR rating of 1.6 was the fourth highest among all position players in 
the American Association. His career range factor of 3.39 at third base 
remains the 23rd highest in major league history.[1] Whitney was born in 
1858 in Brockton, Massachusetts.[1] His parents, George and Paulene Whitney, 
were both Massachusetts natives. Whitney grew up in North Bridgewater, 
Massachusetts, where his father was a dentist.[2][3] Whitney's older brother, 
Frank "Jumbo" Whitney, also played professional baseball.[4] Whitney began 
his professional baseball career with the Lowell, Massachusetts team during 
the 1877 and 1878 seasons.[5] He also played for a team in New Bedford, 
Massachusetts.[6] In 1879, he played for the Worcester Ruby Legs.[5] In 
1880, the Worcester Ruby Legs were admitted to the National League and 
attained major league status. Whitney was the starting third baseman for 
the 1880 Ruby Legs, appearing in 76 games and compiling a .222 batting 
average.[1] Whitney next played for the Detroit Wolverines of the National 
League during the 1881 season and part of the 1882 season. He appeared 
in a total of 89 games for Detroit, 80 of them at third base, eight at 
shortstop, and three as a pitcher. He compiled a batting average of .182 
for Detroit in 1881 and .183 in 1882.[1] Whitney also appeared in 11 games, 
all of them at shortstop, for the Providence Grays during the 1882 season. 
He compiled an .075 batting average for Providence and was released in 
June 1882.[1] After a poor showing at the plate during the 1881 and 1882 
seasons, Whitney returned to the minor leagues. He played for the Saginaw, 
Michigan team in the Northwestern League during the 1883 and 1884 seasons.[5] 
In 1885, Whitney joined the Pittsburg Alleghenys and remained there for 
four years through the 1888 season. In his four years with the Alleghenys, 
Whitney appeared in 368 games and compiled a .248 batting average. With 
the benefit of 123 bases on balls and nine times hit by pitch, Whitney 
boosted his on-base percentage during that same time period to .312. He 
also scored 190 runs and had 134 RBIs for the Alleghenys.[1] In June 1888, 
the Alleghenys traded Whitney to the New York Giants for Elmer Cleveland. 
Whitney remained with the Giants through the 1889 season and appeared in 
219 games, all at third base. He scored 99 runs and compiled a .218 batting 
average and .279 on-base percentage with the Giants.[1] The Giants won 
the pennant both years that Whitney was with the team, and Whitney helped 
the Giants win both the 1888 World Series and the 1889 World Series, contributing 
20 hits, 15 RBIs and 11 runs scored in two years of World Series play.[1] 
Whitney jumped to the Players' League for the 1890 season, signing with 
the New York Giants. He appeared in 119 Players' League games, including 
88 at third base and 31 at shortstop. He compiled a .219 batting average, 
but 64 bases on balls boosted his on-base percentage to .322.[1] The Players' 
League disbanded after one season, and in March 1891, Whitney signed as 
a free agent with the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers of the American Association. 
He appeared in 93 games for Cincinnati, all at third base, and compiled 
a .199 batting average and .270 on-base percentage. He was released by 
Cincinnati in late August and concluded his major league career with the 
St. Louis Browns. He appeared in only three games for the Browns, with 
his last major league game occurring on August 22, 1891, while Whitney 
was age 33.[1] Before retiring from the game, Whitney played two additional 
seasons, 1892 and 1893, with the Lowell, Massachusetts team in the New 
England League.[5] Whitney was married in approximately 1881 to Rowena 
Locke.[7] After retiring from baseball, Whitney worked for many years for 
the Victor Sporting Goods Company in Springfield, Massachusetts. Whitney's 
brother, Charles Whitney, founded the company, which was later absorbed 
by A. G. Spalding & Sons.[6] At the time of the 1900, 1910, 1920 and 1930 
censuses, Whitney was living in Springfield, Massachusetts with his wife, 
Rowena. In 1900, he was employed in the sporting goods manufacturing business.[7][8][9][10] 
Whitney died in 1943 at age 85 at his home in Lowell, Massachusetts, after
