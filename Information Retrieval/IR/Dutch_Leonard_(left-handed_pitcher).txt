Hubert Benjamin "Dutch" Leonard, (April 16, 1892 – July 11, 1952) was an 
American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who had an 11-year 
career from 1913 to 1921, and 1924 to 1925. He played for the Boston Red 
Sox and Detroit Tigers, and holds the major league modern-era record for 
the lowest single-season ERA of all time — 0.96 in 1914. The all-time record 
holder is Tim Keefe with a 0.86 ERA in 1880. Another pitcher named Dutch 
Leonard pitched in the National League around a decade later. Born in Birmingham, 
Ohio, Leonard played baseball for the Saint Mary's College of California 
"Gaels" in Moraga, California, from 1910 to 1911. In 1912, he played for 
the Denver Grizzlies of the Western League, where he compiled a 22–9 record 
with 326 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.50. Leonard broke in with the Boston 
Red Sox in 1913. In his second year in the major leagues, 1914, Leonard 
led the American League with a remarkable 0.96 ERA – the MLB record for 
single-season ERA when not counting Tim Keefe's record of 0.86 in his first 
MLB season, since it was only in 105 innings pitched. (The lowest ERA since 
then is Bob Gibson's 1.12 in 1968.) Leonard also pitched well in Boston's 
1915 and 1916 World Series victories. He won Game 3 of the 1915 World Series, 
outduelling the Phillies' Grover Cleveland Alexander 2–1. He also won Game 
4 of the 1916 World Series against the Brooklyn Robins. Leonard also pitched 
two no-hitters for the Red Sox, the first in 1916 against the St. Louis 
Browns and the second in 1918 against the Detroit Tigers. In January 1919, 
the Red Sox sold Leonard to the Detroit Tigers, where Leonard played from 
1919 to 1921 and 1924–1925. Leonard became embroiled in a salary dispute 
with Tigers' owner Frank Navin in 1922, and Leonard opted to play for Fresno, 
in the San Joaquin Valley League in 1922 and 1923. Leonard was suspended 
by the American League for his actions, but he rejoined the Tigers in 1924 
where he feuded with Tigers manager Ty Cobb. Leonard pitched his final 
major league game in July 1925. Even before their player-manager feud, 
Leonard and Cobb had a history. In 1914, Leonard hit Cobb in the ribs with 
a fastball. In the next at bat, Cobb dragged a bunt which the Red Sox first 
baseman was forced to field. A full feud broke when Cobb took over as the 
Tigers' manager in 1921. Cobb took pleasure in fining Leonard, who enjoyed 
late nights, for violating curfew. At one point in the 1921 season, Leonard 
was 11–13, despite a respectable ERA; Cobb left his office door open so 
that Leonard could hear him on the phone, faking a call: "I'm putting that 
damned Dutchman on waivers." (Al Stump, Cobb, p. 140) In 1922, Leonard 
and Cobb fought over how to pitch to George Sisler and Tris Speaker. Leonard 
cursed Cobb to his face during the dispute, and Leonard ended up quitting 
the team in 1921, calling Cobb a "horse's ass." (Al Stump, Cobb, p. 340) 
When Leonard returned to the Tigers in 1924 after two seasons in the San 
Joaquin Valley League, the feud with Cobb resumed. By the middle of the 
1925 season, Leonard was 11–3, but that did not stop Cobb from accusing 
Leonard of being a shirker. In front of the team, Cobb berated Leonard: 
"Don't you dare turn bolshevik on me. I'm the boss here." (Richard Bak, 
Peach, p. 147) Leonard accused Cobb of over-working him, and Cobb responded 
in July 1925 by leaving Leonard on the mound for an entire game despite 
Leonard's giving up 20 hits and taking a 12–4 beating. After that, Leonard 
refused to pitch for Cobb. As a result, the Tigers put Leonard on waivers, 
and when no team picked him up, his baseball career came to an end. (Al 
Stump, Cobb, p. 364) Rumors began to spread that Leonard was claiming he 
"had something" on Cobb. Leonard was quoted as saying, "I am going to expose 
that bastard Cobb, I'll ruin him." (Al Stump, Cobb, p. 371) And in 1926 
Leonard sought his revenge, contacting American league president Ban Johnson 
and accusing Cobb of being involved in gambling and/or fixing games with 
Tris Speaker. Leonard claimed that Speaker and Cobb had conspired before 
a 1919 Tigers-Indians game to allow the Tigers to win, enabling the team 
to reach third place and qualify for World Series money. To corroborate 
his story, Leonard produced letters written at the time (one by Cobb and 
one by Smoky Joe Wood) that obliquely referred to gambling or game-fixing. 
When Johnson made Leonard's letter public in December 1926, it started 
a scandal. Cobb was called to testify at a hearing before Commissioner 
Landis, and denied Leonard's allegations. Cobb noted that Leonard "had 
the reputation in the past of being a bolshevik on the club." (Al Stump, 
Cobb, p. 382) Leonard declined to appear and testify at the hearing, saying 
he feared a physical attack from "that wild man." In the absence of Leonard's 
testimony, Landis found Cobb and Speaker not guilty. Leonard did well for 
himself after baseball. He became a very successful California fruit farmer 
and wine maker. He was also an expert left-handed golfer. Leonard died 
in 1952 at age 60 from complications of a stroke. He is buried at Mountain 
View Cemetery in Fresno, California. His estate at the time of his death
