Mario Matthew Cuomo (/ˈkwoʊmoʊ/; Italian: [ˈkwɔːmo]; June 15, 1932 – January 
1, 2015) was an American Democratic politician. He served as the 52nd Governor 
of New York for three terms, from 1983 to 1994,[1][2][3] Lieutenant Governor 
of New York from 1979 to 1982;[1][2] and Secretary of State of New York 
from 1975 to 1978.[1][2] Cuomo was known for his liberal views and public 
speeches, particularly his keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic National 
Convention[1] where he criticized Ronald Reagan's policies.[1] The speech 
brought him to national attention, and he was widely considered a front-runner 
for the Democratic nomination for President in both 1988 and 1992, but 
he declined to seek the nomination in both instances. His legacy as a reluctant 
standard-bearer for the Democrats in presidential elections led to him 
being dubbed "Hamlet on the Hudson".[4][5] Cuomo was defeated for a fourth 
term as governor by George Pataki in the "Republican Revolution" of 1994, 
and he subsequently retired from politics. He was the father of five, including 
Andrew Cuomo, the current Governor of New York, and journalist Chris Cuomo, 
currently at CNN.[1][2] He died of natural causes due to heart failure 
in Manhattan, New York City, on New Year's Day, 2015. Cuomo was born in 
the Briarwood section of the New York City borough of Queens to a family 
of Italian origin.[1][2] His father, Andrea Cuomo,[1][2] was from Nocera 
Inferiore (Campania), and his mother, Immacolata[1][2] (née Giordano), 
was from Tramonti, Campania.[6] The family owned a store in South Jamaica, 
Queens, in New York City. Cuomo attended New York City P.S. 50 and St. 
John's Preparatory School. Cuomo was a baseball player, and while attending 
St. John's University in 1952, he signed as an outfielder with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates organization for a $2,000 bonus, which he used to help purchase 
the engagement ring for his wife, Matilda.[7] Cuomo played for the Brunswick 
Pirates of the Class D Georgia–Florida League, where his teammates included 
future major leaguer Fred Green[8]; Cuomo attained a .244 batting average, 
and played center field until he was struck in the back of the head by 
a pitch.[9] Batting helmets were not yet required equipment, and Cuomo's 
injury was severe enough that he was hospitalized for six days.[8] After 
his recovery, Cuomo gave up baseball and returned to St. John's, earning 
his bachelor's degree in 1953.[1][2][10] Deciding on a legal career, Cuomo 
attended St. John's University School of Law, from which he graduated tied 
for first in his class in 1956.[1][2][10] Cuomo clerked for Judge Adrian 
P. Burke of the New York Court of Appeals.[10] Despite having been a top 
student, when he applied to law firms, the ethnic prejudice of the time 
led to his rejection by more than 50 before he was hired by a small but 
established office in Brooklyn.[11][12] In addition to practicing law, 
Cuomo was an adjunct professor at St. John's Law School.[13] Cuomo first 
became widely known in New York City in the late 1960s when he represented 
"The Corona Fighting 69", a group of 69 home-owners from the Queens neighborhood 
of Corona, who were threatened with displacement by the city's plan to 
build a new high school. He later represented another Queens residents 
group, the Kew Gardens–Forest Hills Committee on Urban Scale, who opposed 
Samuel J. LeFrak's housing proposal adjacent to Willow Lake in Queens. 
In 1972, Cuomo became known beyond New York City when Mayor John Lindsay 
appointed him to conduct an inquiry and mediate a dispute over low-income 
public housing slated for the upper-middle-class neighborhood of Forest 
Hills.[5] Cuomo described his experience in that dispute in the book Forest 
Hills Diary, and the story was retold by sociologist Richard Sennett in 
The Fall of Public Man. In 1974, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New 
York on a ticket headed by gubernatorial candidate Howard J. Samuels, and 
both won the designation of the Democratic State Committee at the party 
convention. But their entire ticket, including the nominees for attorney 
general and U.S. Senator, was defeated in the Democratic primary election: 
Samuels by Rep. Hugh Carey of Brooklyn, and Cuomo by State Senator Mary 
Anne Krupsak, the first woman to be nominated for statewide office in New 
York. After Carey and Krupsak were elected, the new governor appointed 
Cuomo Secretary of State of New York in January 1975. Two years later, 
Cuomo ran for Mayor of New York City at Carey's urging.[5] Incumbent Mayor 
Abraham Beame was very unpopular and Cuomo was one of five major challengers 
to Beame in the Democratic primary. In a close and highly fractured election, 
U.S. Representative Ed Koch finished first with 19.81% of the vote and 
Cuomo came second with 18.74%. As no candidate cleared 40% of the vote, 
Koch and Cuomo advanced to a runoff. Koch emerged victorious with 54.94% 
of the vote to Cuomo's 45.06%. Cuomo had received the nomination of the 
Liberal Party several months previously and was urged to drop out of the 
race but he contested the general election against Koch and token Republican 
opposition.[5] During the mayoral campaign, placards appeared saying: "Vote 
for Cuomo, not the homo" in reference to rumors about Koch's sexuality. 
Cuomo denied responsibility for this, but Koch never forgave him "as he 
made clear with a pointedly disparaging reference to Mr. Cuomo in a recorded 
interview with The New York Times that was not to be made public until 
Mr. Koch's death."[14] Cuomo ran on his opposition to the death penalty, 
which backfired amongst New Yorkers as crime was very high. Cuomo then 
went negative with ads that likened Koch to unpopular former mayor John 
Lindsay. Meanwhile, Koch backers accused Cuomo of antisemitism and pelted 
Cuomo campaign cars with eggs.[15] Cuomo was also defeated by Koch in the 
general election,[15] taking 40.97% to Koch's 49.99%. The race is discussed 
in Jonathan Mahler's book Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning.[15] 
In 1978, incumbent Lieutenant Governor Krupsak declined to seek re-election 
because of how Governor Carey treated her in office; she felt she was not 
given enough to do. She withdrew from the ticket and unsuccessfully challenged 
Carey in the gubernatorial primary, accusing him of incompetence.[5] Cuomo 
easily won the primary for lieutenant governor and was elected alongside 
Carey in the general election. In 1982, Carey declined to run for re-election 
and Cuomo declared his candidacy. He once again faced Ed Koch in the Democratic 
primary. This time, Koch's support for the death penalty backfired and 
he alienated many voters from outside New York City when, in an interview 
with Playboy magazine, he described the lifestyle of both suburbia and 
upstate New York as "sterile" and lamented the thought of having to live 
in "the small town" of Albany as governor, saying it was "a city without 
a good Chinese restaurant".[5] Cuomo won the primary by ten points and 
faced Republican nominee businessman Lewis Lehrman in the general election. 
With the recession aiding Democratic candidates, Cuomo beat Lehrman 50.91% 
to 47.48%. Cuomo actively campaigned for Walter Mondale in the 1984 presidential 
election, and was named on Mondale's list of vice presidential candidates. 
Geraldine Ferraro was ultimately nominated as his running mate, but Cuomo 
was chosen to give the keynote speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention 
in San Francisco.[1] He vigorously attacked Ronald Reagan's record and 
policies in a speech that brought him to national attention,[1] most memorably 
saying: "There is despair, Mr. President, in the faces that you don't see, 
in the places that you don't visit, in your shining city."[16][17] He was 
immediately considered one of the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination 
for President in 1988 and 1992. Cuomo was re-elected in a landslide in 
1986 against Republican nominee Andrew P. O'Rourke by 64.3% to 31.77%. 
He consistently ruled out the possibility of running in the 1988 presidential 
election, announcing on February 19, 1987, that he would not run[1] and 
then going on to publicly decline draft movements in the wake of Gary Hart's 
withdrawal following the Donna Rice affair.[18] In the 1990 gubernatorial 
election, Cuomo was re-elected with 53.17% of the vote to Republican Pierre 
Andrew Rinfret's 21.35% and Conservative Herbert London's 20.40%. When 
Cuomo was asked if he was planning to run for President in 1992, he would 
say: "I have no plans and no plans to make plans", but he refused to rule 
it out. In October 1991, news broke that he was interested in running and 
was taking advice from consultant Bob Shrum. At the same time, he began 
working on a budget with the New York State Legislature, and promised not 
to make any announcements about a presidential run until he had reached 
an agreement with the Republican-controlled State Senate and the Democratic-controlled 
State Assembly. Two polls taken in November of the New Hampshire Democratic 
primary showed him leading the field by at least twenty points, and a poll 
in December showed him trailing President George H. W. Bush 48% to 43%, 
having been behind by 28% two months previously.[5] The filing deadline 
for the New Hampshire primary was on December 20, 1991, and Cuomo was expected 
to wait until the deadline before filing and declaring his candidacy. In 
the days before the deadline, Cuomo was not able to negotiate an agreement 
with Republicans in the Legislature and on deadline day, but on the date 
of the deadline, he would be required submit a ballot application in person. 
In an extraordinary display of political indecision,[19] which was later 
fictionalized in Joe Klein's Primary Colors,[20] he kept an airplane idling 
on the tarmac as he decided whether to fly to New Hampshire to enter the 
race.[21] Democratic party leaders asked him to run and he prepared two 
statements, one in case he ran and one in case he did not. He tried to 
come to a final agreement over the budget, but as he could not, he made 
an announcement at 3:30 p.m. that day: "It is my responsibility as governor 
to deal with this extraordinarily severe problem. Were it not, I would 
travel to New Hampshire today and file my name as a candidate in this presidential 
primary. That was my hope and I prepared for it. But it seemed to me that 
I cannot turn my attention to New Hampshire while this threat hangs over 
the head of the New Yorkers I have sworn to put first."[5] Cuomo's supporters 
launched a draft movement and encouraged people to write-in his name in 
the Democratic primary,[1] which was held on February 18, 1992. Cuomo did 
not discourage it, which many saw as implicit endorsement of the campaign.[22] 
Cuomo went on to receive 6,577 votes in the primary, 3.92% of the total 
cast and subsequently asked the draft committee to close down, saying, 
"I am flattered by their support and impressed by their commitment, but 
I am also convinced that in fairness to themselves they ought now to end 
their effort."[22] The group closed down, but Cuomo refused to rule out 
joining the primaries later in the year, stating, "I have said more than 
once that the nomination should go to someone willing and able to campaign 
for it. I am willing, but because New York's budget has not been settled 
I am not able to campaign for it."[22] Ultimately, Cuomo did not enter 
the race and Bill Clinton went on to win the Democratic nomination and 
the general election. Because of Cuomo's refusal to run for national office, 
despite his popularity, he was referred to as the "Hamlet on the Hudson".[23] 
After Bill Clinton won the Democratic nomination for President in 1992, 
Cuomo was a candidate for vice president but he refused to be considered 
and did not make Clinton's final shortlist.[24] He was also spoken of as 
a candidate for nomination to the United States Supreme Court, but when 
President Clinton was considering nominees during his first term to replace 
the retiring Byron White, Cuomo stated he was not interested in the office.[25] 
George Stephanopoulos wrote in 1999 that Clinton came within 15 minutes 
of nominating Cuomo before the latter pre-emptively rejected the post.[26] 
In 1994, Cuomo ran for a fourth term. In this election, Republicans attacked 
him for the weak economic recovery within the state since the early 1990s 
recession and the resulting high unemployment as well as his opposition 
to the death penalty by highlighting the case of Arthur Shawcross, a multiple 
murderer convicted of manslaughter who was paroled from New York in 1987 
and on release became a serial killer. Republicans were able to associate 
Shawcross with Cuomo much like Willie Horton with Michael Dukakis six years 
earlier. Cuomo was defeated by George Pataki[1] in the 1994 Republican 
landslide, taking 45.4% of the vote to Pataki's 48.8%. Cuomo lost mainly 
because his support outside of New York City all but vanished; he only 
carried one county outside the Five Boroughs, Albany County. Cuomo and 
fellow Democrat Ann Richards, the Governor of Texas who had been defeated 
in her re-election campaign by George W. Bush, appeared in a series of 
humorous television advertisements for the snack food Doritos shortly afterwards, 
in which they discussed the "sweeping changes" occurring. The changes they 
were discussing turned out to be the new Doritos packaging. In Cuomo's 
first term as Governor of New York State, he produced a balanced budget 
and earned the highest credit rating over the long term for the State in 
one decade.[10] His philosophy in leading the State was one of "progressive 
pragmatism."[1][10] Cuomo and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives 
(Democrats had over a 3:2 margin in House) was successful in stopping U.S. 
President Ronald Reagan's administration from eliminating "federal income 
tax deductibility of state, local and property taxes."[10] During his second 
term as governor, Cuomo successfully pushed for the enactment of sweeping 
fiscal reforms for the State.[10] Comprehensive reform measures were also 
enacted in governmental ethics for New York State under Cuomo's leadership.[10] 
Cuomo extended New York State's economic reach in business, globally, contributing 
to both strengthening and developing it.[10][27] Cuomo is also known for 
beginning the "Decade of the Child" initiative, an effort that included 
multiple health care and educational strategies to better the lives of 
children[1] in New York State.[10] Further, in 1988, the "Rebuild NY" Transportation 
Bond Act was an initiative under Cuomo that was a continuance of efforts 
to rebuild bridges and roads throughout the State.[10] Cuomo increased 
assistance to local law enforcement agencies in order to help reduce or 
eliminate crime;[10] and prison expansion in the State was continued which 
he is said to have regretted.[10] Under Cuomo, New York State was also 
the first in the nation to enact seat belt laws.[1] Governor Mario and 
his wife Matilda Cuomo presided over the First New York State Family Support 
Conference in 1988. His statewide initiatives in developing over 1,000 
[family support] programs are today termed "individual and family support" 
nationwide and are cited by the National Council on Disability. He was 
the first governor to support an ecological approach to families which 
was represented by [community integration] and community development as 
the goal of deinstitutionalization. Healthcare was also an area that Cuomo 
improved as governor, implementing initiatives that succeeded in reducing 
costs of prescription medications.[10] This endeavor assisted senior citizens 
in making the medications more affordable.[10] Under Cuomo's leadership, 
a public health plan that tackled the AIDS epidemic was the most intense 
in the nation.[10] Overseeing programs for environmental preservation and 
conservation, Cuomo implemented aggressive initiatives in these areas.[10] 
Under Cuomo's leadership, New York State was the first in the United States 
to integrate both environmental protection and energy conservation goals.[10] 
Cuomo's progressivism was also evident in his appointments of judges to 
the New York Court of Appeals.[1] Cuomo appointed all of the judges to 
the State Appeals Court, including the first two female judges, as well 
as both the first African-American and Hispanic judges.[1] Cuomo eliminated 
the New York State Regents Scholarship given to all students who ranked 
high on a statewide special examination. Cuomo was notable for his liberal 
political views, particularly his steadfast opposition to the death penalty,[28] 
an opinion that was unpopular in New York during the high-crime era of 
the 1980s and early 1990s.[28] While governor, he vetoed several bills 
that would have re-established capital punishment in New York State.[28] 
The death penalty was reinstated by Governor Pataki the year after he defeated 
Cuomo in the 1994 election, although it was never put into effect and the 
statute was declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals 
in 2004.[29] Cuomo, a Roman Catholic,[2] was personally opposed to abortion,[1] 
but he was pro-choice on the issue, believing that the State does not have 
the right to ban it.[1] In a speech at the University of Notre Dame on 
September 13, 1984, he used the statements of the American Catholic hierarchy 
to make an argument: What is ideally desirable isn't always feasible, ... 
there can be different political approaches to abortion besides unyielding 
adherence to an absolute prohibition."[30] For this political position, 
Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor considered excommunicating him.[31][32] He 
was also outspoken on what he perceived to be the unfair stereotyping of 
Italian Americans, including the existence or at least pervasiveness of 
the Mafia. Joseph Pistone, after undercover FBI role as Donnie Brasco, 
wrote disparagingly of the New York governor in Unfinished Business. Cuomo 
opposed the move of the National Football League's New York Giants and 
New York Jets to the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, choosing 
instead to attend the home games of the Buffalo Bills while serving as 
governor, referring to the Bills as "New York State's only team". From 
1995 until his death, Cuomo worked as an "of counsel" at the New York law 
firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher.[27] From 1996 until his death, Cuomo served 
on the board of Medallion Financial Corp., a lender to purchasers of taxi 
medallions in leading cities across the U.S. He was named to the board 
through his personal and business relationship with Andrew M. Murstein, 
president of Medallion.[33][34][35] Cuomo also sat on the Advisory Council 
of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. Cuomo's first book, Forest 
Hills Diary: The Crisis of Low-income Housing, became an influential text 
in the fields of political science and housing policy, and it helped make 
his name with the public outside New York. In 1996, Cuomo wrote Reason 
to Believe. He also wrote a narrative essay titled "Achieving the American 
Dream" about his parents' struggles in coming to America and how they prospered. 
Cuomo was the author of Why Lincoln Matters, published in 2004, and he 
co-edited Lincoln on Democracy, an anthology of Abraham Lincoln's speeches. 
Cuomo also wrote and delivered numerous speeches and remarks. At its 1983 
commencement ceremonies, Barnard College awarded Cuomo its highest honor, 
the Barnard Medal of Distinction. In 1983, Yeshiva University awarded Cuomo 
an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Cuomo was married for 60 years to Matilda 
(née Raffa), from 1954 until 2015.[2] She is a graduate of St. John's University's 
Teachers College.[36] They had five children,[2] Andrew, Maria, Margaret, 
Madeline, and Christopher. Cuomo's older son Andrew married Kerry Kennedy, 
a daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, on June 9, 1990. 
They have three daughters, twins Cara Ethel Cuomo and Mariah Matilda Cuomo, 
born on January 11, 1995; and Michaela Andrea Cuomo, born on August 26, 
1997. Kennedy and Cuomo divorced in 2005 during Cuomo's term as New York 
Attorney General. He served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
under President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2001. In an attempt to succeed 
his father, he ran as Democratic candidate for New York governor in 2002, 
but withdrew before the primary. He withdrew after criticizing Republican 
incumbent George Pataki's leadership following the terrorist attacks on 
the city on September 11 the previous year. In November 2006, Andrew was 
elected New York State Attorney General; and on November 2, 2010, he was 
elected governor of New York, being inaugurated on January 1, 2011, and 
subsequently re-elected and sworn in on January 1, 2015. Cuomo's younger 
son Chris was a journalist on the ABC Network news magazine Primetime. 
He anchored news segments and served as co-host on Good Morning America, 
before moving to CNN in 2013, where he is now co-host of the morning news 
magazine New Day. He was picked as one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful 
People in 1997.[37] Cuomo's daughter Maria is married to Kenneth Cole, 
a well known New York fashion designer. She is Chair of the Board of HELP 
USA, a charitable foundation[38] that is also associated with the organization 
her mother founded, Mentoring USA.[36] Cuomo's daughter Margaret, a physician, 
is married to Howard Maier. She "is a board certified radiologist, teaching 
professional, and national advocate for the prevention of cancer, heart 
disease, and diabetes."[39] She is the author of A World Without Cancer: 
The Making of a New World and the Real Promise of Prevention (2013),[39] 
and she serves on the Board of Directors of the nonprofit organization, 
LessCancer.[39] She has been featured on such TV shows as Good Morning 
America, Good Day New York, Morning Joe, and Inside Edition.[39] In 2011, 
she was awarded the Commendation of the Order of the Star by the president 
and prime minister of Italy.[39][40] Cuomo remained a fan after his baseball 
career ended, reportedly only watching baseball games or C-SPAN on television.[8] 
He was an avid player of fantasy baseball, always with an Italian player 
on his team regardless of how many Italian players are available or how 
well they are doing.[41] In 1994, he was featured several times on the 
Ken Burns PBS series Baseball where he shared personal memories of his 
life in baseball before he entered politics. Cuomo was the first guest 
on the long-running CNN talk show Larry King Live that began in 1985 and 
ended in 2010.[42] Neal Conan described Cuomo as both the most intelligent 
and wittiest politician he has ever interviewed.[43] Cuomo was hospitalized 
for a heart condition, and received treatment in November 2014. He was 
described as being "in good spirits" at that time. Cuomo died on January 
1, 2015, in his home in Manhattan, New York, of heart failure, only hours 
after his son Andrew was sworn-in to a second term as Governor of New York 
State. Andrew Cuomo said his father was unable to attend the ceremony because 
of his health but was present in spirit. "He is in the heart and mind of 
every person who is here", Andrew Cuomo told the crowd. "He is here and 
his inspiration and his legacy and his experience is what has brought the 
state to this point. So let's give him a round of applause."[44] Cuomo 
had a recent history of heart issues, which contributed to his death at 
the age of 82.[45] His wake was held on January 5, 2015, and his funeral 
was held at Saint Ignatius Loyola Church in Manhattan on January 6.[46] 
His body was transported to St. John Cemetery, in Middle Village, Queens, 
where he was laid to rest.[47] In a statement on the day of his death from 
the White House Press Office, President Barack Obama stated: "An Italian 
Catholic kid from Queens, born to immigrant parents, Mario paired his faith 
in God and faith in America to live a life of public service – and we are 
all better for it. He rose to be chief executive of the state he loved, 
a determined champion of progressive values, and an unflinching voice for 
tolerance, inclusiveness, fairness, dignity, and opportunity. His own story 
taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people, and 
our country's success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate 
few."[48] Vice President Joe Biden stated: "He was one of the most principled 
and courageous public servants I have ever known. He was a forceful voice 
for civil rights, for equal rights, for economic opportunity and justice. 
He had the courage to stand by his convictions, even when it was unpopular. 
Mario Cuomo was full of hope and optimism, because he believed in this 
country, and he believed in its people. He knew what we could all achieve 
together."[49] New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio stated: "Tonight, New 
York has lost a giant. Mario Cuomo was a man of unwavering principle who 
possessed a compassion for humankind that was without equal. He established 
the gold standard in New York State for how public servants should act, 
and set an example that the rest of us continue to aspire to today."[50] 
Former Governor of New York George Pataki stated: "Libby and I extend our 
deepest condolences to Matilda, Governor Cuomo and the entire family on 
the passing of Governor Mario Cuomo. Governor Cuomo was a proud son of 
immigrants and a compassionate leader who possessed a soaring intellect. 
He was a great New Yorker who will be missed."[51] Governor of New Jersey 
Chris Christie stated: "Our country and our region lost a giant today with 
the passing of Governor Mario Cuomo. He was a strong, eloquent leader who 
loved New York and its people. As an Italian-American, he was also a role 
model for future generations that anything was possible through hard work 
and education. Finally, he was a great husband, father and grandfather. 
Mary Pat and I send our deepest condolences to Matilda, Governor Andrew 
Cuomo and the entire Cuomo family."[52] Former Mayor of New York City Rudy 
Giuliani stated: “Judith and I extend our deepest condolences to Matilda 
and the wonderful Cuomo family on the loss of a truly exceptional American. 
Mario was a giant political influence of his generation. His ability to 
make riveting political speeches was only exceeded by his ability to logically 
argue and defend his position. Even when you disagreed with him you could 
understand his position and it increased your knowledge of the issue. My 
endorsement of him was very controversial at the time. It took some time 
to establish my relationship with my party and with my good friend George 
Pataki. I was proud to have endorsed a truly exceptional man of conscience 
and of great intellect. He raised the level of respect for Italian Americans 
and for all elected public servants. And he and Matilda raised two sons 
Andrew and Chris who I know Mario was very proud of for their own accomplishments."[53] 
U.S. Rep. Peter King (NY-2) stated: "Mario Cuomo was a giant of New York 
government and politics. As much as anyone he understood and appreciated 
the mosaic that was New York. All who knew Mario Cuomo were better for
