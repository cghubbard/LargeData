As player As manager Ryne Dee Sandberg (born September 18, 1959), nicknamed 
"Ryno", is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and 
manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman for the 
Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs for sixteen years (1981–1994 and 
1996–97). He became "interim manager" of the Philadelphia Phillies in August 
2013. He was officially named manager of the Philadelphia Phillies on September 
22, 2013, making him the only Hall of Fame player managing in the league. 
Sandberg established himself as a perennial All-Star and Gold Glove candidate, 
making 10 consecutive All-Star appearances and winning nine consecutive 
Gold Gloves from 1983 to 1991. His career .989 fielding percentage is a 
major-league record at second base. Sandberg was elected to the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in January 2005; he was formally inducted in ceremonies 
on July 31, 2005. He resigned from his managerial duties for the Phillies 
on June 26, 2015, and was succeeded by Pete Mackanin. Born in Spokane, 
Washington, Sandberg's parents were Elizabeth, a nurse, and Derwent D. 
"Sandy" Sandberg, a mortician.[1][2] He was named for relief pitcher Ryne 
Duren.[3] Sandberg was a three-sport star in high school at North Central 
and graduated in 1978.[4] The previous fall he was named to Parade Magazine's 
High School All-America football team, one of the eight quarterbacks,[5][6] 
and one of two players from the state of Washington. The school's baseball 
field was named in his honor in 1985 as "Ryne Sandberg Field", and his 
varsity number was retired in both football and baseball.[2][7] Sandberg 
was recruited to play quarterback at NCAA Division I colleges, and eventually 
signed a letter of intent with Washington State University in Pullman. 
He opted not to attend after being selected in the 20th round of the 1978 
baseball amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies.[8][9] Sandberg made 
his major-league debut as a shortstop for the Phillies in 1981. Playing 
for a total of 13 games, Sandberg had one hit in six at-bats for a .167 
batting average during his brief playing stint for the Phillies. That one 
hit occurred at Wrigley Field using a bat borrowed from (later) fellow-Phillies-manager 
Larry Bowa.[10] However, the Phillies didn't have much room in the lineup 
for him at the time. The Phillies didn't think he could play shortstop, 
though he would have probably had trouble dislodging Larry Bowa from that 
spot in any event. While he'd seen time in the minors at both second and 
third base, he was blocked from those positions by Manny Trillo and Mike 
Schmidt, respectively. Accordingly, he was traded along with Bowa to the 
Cubs for shortstop Iván DeJesús prior to the 1982 season. The trade, now 
reckoned as one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history, came about 
after negotiations between Bowa and the Phillies broke down for a new contract.[11] 
However, Cubs general manager Dallas Green, a former Phillies manager, 
wanted a young prospect to go along with the aging Bowa (as it turned out, 
Bowa would be out of baseball by 1985). Green had largely been responsible 
for the Phillies drafting Sandberg in 1978, when Green worked in the Phillies 
front office. The two have remained very close over the years.[8] Years 
later, Phillies general manager Paul Owens said that he didn't want to 
trade Sandberg, but Green and the Cubs weren't interested in any of the 
other prospects he offered. Owens then went back to his scouts, who told 
him Sandberg wouldn't be any more than a utility infielder. However, Sandberg 
had hit over .290 in the minors two years in a row.[12] The trade is now 
considered one of the best (if not the best) in recent Cubs history. At 
the same time, it is considered one of the worst trades in Phillies, if 
not MLB history; DeJesus, despite helping anchor the Phillies infield on 
their way to the 1983 World Series, would only last three years in Philadelphia, 
and was out of baseball by 1988. Sandberg is one of two Hall of Famers 
who came up through the Phillies farm system and earned their Hall of Fame 
credentials primarily as Cubs, the other being Ferguson Jenkins. Similarly, 
Jenkins was traded to the Cubs in another lopsided trade (a multi-player 
trade for pitchers Larry Jackson and Bob Buhl). The Cubs, who initially 
wanted Sandberg to play center field, installed him as their third baseman, 
and he went on to be one of the top-rated rookies of 1982. After the Cubs 
acquired veteran Ron Cey following the 1982 season, they moved Sandberg 
to second base, where he became a star. After winning a Gold Glove Award 
in his first season at the new position, Sandberg emerged with a breakout 
season in 1984, in which he batted .314 with 200 hits, 114 runs, 36 doubles, 
19 triples, 19 homers, and 84 RBIs. He nearly became only the third player 
to collect 20 doubles, triples, home runs, and stolen bases in the same 
season, led the Cubs to the National League's Eastern Division title (their 
first championship of any kind since 1945), and won the National League 
Most Valuable Player Award, the first by a Cub since Ernie Banks' back-to-back 
honors in 1958 and 1959. After his great season in which he garnered national 
attention, he wrote an autobiography Ryno with Fred Mitchell. One game 
in particular was cited for putting Sandberg (as well as the 1984 Cubs 
in general) "on the map", an NBC national telecast of a Cardinals–Cubs 
game on June 23, 1984.[13] The Cubs had been playing well throughout the 
season's first few months, but as a team unaccustomed to winning, they 
had not yet become a serious contender in the eyes of most baseball fans. 
As for Sandberg, he had played two full seasons in the major leagues, and 
while he had shown himself to be a top-fielding second baseman and fast 
on the basepaths (over 30 stolen bases both seasons), his .260-ish batting 
average and single-digit home run production were respectable for his position 
but not especially noteworthy, and Sandberg was not talked about outside 
Chicago. The Game of the Week, however, put the sleeper Cubs on the national 
stage against their regional rival, the St. Louis Cardinals. Both teams 
were well-established franchises with strong fan bases outside the Chicago 
and St. Louis areas. In the ninth inning, the Cubs trailed 9–8, and faced 
the premier relief pitcher of the time, Bruce Sutter. Sutter was at the 
forefront of the emergence of the closer in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
and was especially dominant in 1984, saving 45 games. However, in the ninth 
inning, Sandberg, not yet known for his power, slugged a solo home run 
to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer, tying the game. Answering 
this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. 
Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter 
with one man on base. As Cubs' radio announcer Harry Caray described it: 
The Cubs went on to win in the 11th inning, with the winning run being 
driven in by a single off the bat of Dave Owen. The Cardinals' Willie McGee, 
who hit for the cycle during the game, had already been named NBC's Player 
of the Game before Sandberg's first home run; Sandberg would later share 
that distinction with McGee. As NBC play-by-play man Bob Costas (who called 
the game with Tony Kubek) said when Sandberg hit the second home run, "Do 
you believe it?!" The game is sometimes called "The Sandberg Game". In 
1990, Sandberg led the National League in home runs–a rarity for a second 
baseman–with 40. Sandberg was only the third second baseman to hit 40 home 
runs; Rogers Hornsby and Davey Johnson hit 42, and no American League second 
baseman had reached forty until Brian Dozier in 2016. Sandberg also batted 
in 100 runs, despite batting second in the order. His batting average did 
not suffer from his new level of power, as he finished at .306 for the 
season. Sandberg, Brady Anderson and Barry Bonds are the only players to 
have both a 40-homer (1990) and 50-steal (1985) season during their careers. 
Sandberg played a then major league-record 123 straight games at second 
base without an error. This record was later broken in 2007 by Plácido 
Polanco, then of the Detroit Tigers. Sandberg played in front of his hometown 
fans in the 1990 MLB All-Star Game which was held in Wrigley Field, home 
of the Cubs. Sandberg won the Home Run Derby with three home runs over 
the left-field bleachers.[citation needed] Not until the Cincinnati Reds' 
Todd Frazier in 2015 would another player win the Home Run Derby in his 
home stadium. In 1991, Sandberg batted .291 with 26 home runs and batted 
in 100 runs for the second consecutive season. He also won his ninth consecutive 
Gold Glove at second base, breaking a tie he had shared with Bill Mazeroski 
for most Gold Gloves at that position (Roberto Alomar has since broken 
this record). On March 2, 1992, Sandberg became the highest paid player 
in baseball at the time, signing a $28.4 million ($47,970,880 today) four-year 
extension worth $7.1 million ($11,992,720 today) a season.[14] He earned 
a spot on the NL All-Star roster and an NL Silver Slugger Award at second 
base with a .304 batting average, 26 home runs, 100 runs, and 87 runs batted 
in.[citation needed] Sandberg, a notoriously slow early season starter, 
found himself struggling even more so than usual early in the 1994 season. 
With his average at a career low .238 and having recorded only fifty-three 
hits in fifty-seven games, Sandberg decided to step away from baseball 
and on June 13, 1994, he announced his retirement. In his book, Second 
to Home, Sandberg said, Sandberg returned to the Chicago Cubs for the 1996 
and 1997 seasons, then retired with a career batting average of .285, and 
a record 277 home runs as a second baseman; this record was surpassed in 
2004 by Jeff Kent. Initially, Sandberg kept a low profile after retiring. 
However, in 2005, Sandberg accepted his first marketing deal since his 
retirement, agreeing to be spokesman for National City Bank. He also appeared 
on ESPN Radio 1000 as an analyst during the 2004 baseball season. He is 
also a former baseball columnist for Yahoo! Sports. Sandberg delivered 
what many traditionalist fans considered a stirring speech at his Hall 
of Fame induction ceremony in 2005.[15] He thanked the writers who voted 
for him because it meant that he played the game the way he had been taught 
it should be played. He spoke several times of respect for the game, and 
chided a subset of current players who, in his opinion, lack that respect. 
Specifically, he spoke of how the game needs more than home run hitters, 
citing that turning a double-play and laying down a sacrifice bunt are 
weapons many of today's greats don't value. He also made a strong pitch 
for induction of his former teammate, Andre Dawson, who was ultimately 
elected to join the Hall in 2010, and famously promoted the election of 
a long-snubbed former Cub to the Hall by saying, "For what it's worth, 
Ron Santo just earned one more vote on the Veterans Committee." Following 
his Hall of Fame induction, Sandberg had his number 23 retired in a ceremony 
at Wrigley Field on August 28, 2005, before a Cubs game against the Florida 
Marlins. He became only the fourth Chicago Cub to have his number retired, 
following respectively Ernie Banks (#14), Billy Williams (#26), and Ron 
Santo (#10). Since then, Ferguson Jenkins (#31) and Greg Maddux (also #31) 
have been retired. Sandberg has worn his uniform number 23 in past jobs 
as a Cubs spring training instructor and Peoria Chiefs manager. He also 
wore that number during his time with the Iowa Cubs as their manager and 
as the manager of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. Sandberg formerly served 
as a spring training instructor for the Cubs in Mesa, Arizona. On December 
5, 2006, Sandberg was named manager of the Cubs' Class-A Peoria Chiefs 
in the Midwest League. In his first season as a manager, he took his team 
to the Midwest League championship game. In December 2008, Sandberg was 
promoted to manager of the Class Double-A Team Tennessee Smokies in the 
Southern League.[16] In December 2009, he was again promoted, to manager 
of the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. Upon leading Iowa to an 82–62 record, the Pacific 
Coast League named him its 2010 Manager of the Year.[17][18] Sandberg has 
said that his ideal job would be to manage the Chicago Cubs.[19] Former 
manager Lou Piniella suggested that Sandberg, as manager of the Cubs' top 
minor-league affiliate, would be in the mix to replace him when he retired 
after the 2010 season.[20] However, the position was given to interim manager 
Mike Quade. On November 15, 2010, Sandberg left the Cubs organization and 
returned to his original organization as manager of the Phillies' top minor-league 
affiliate, the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.[21] He led the IronPigs to their 
first-ever playoff appearance and the International League championship 
series. Baseball America named him its 2011 Minor League Manager of the 
Year.[18] After the 2012 season, Sandberg was promoted to third base coach 
and infield instructor of the Philadelphia Phillies. He was promoted to 
interim manager of the Phillies after they fired Charlie Manuel on August 
16, 2013. Sandberg earned his first win as a manager against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers on Sunday August 18, 2013.[22] On September 22, 2013, Sandberg 
was named permanent manager, with a three-year contract, with an option 
for 2017.[23] He became the first Hall-of-Fame player to manage a team 
full-time since Frank Robinson managed the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals 
from 2002–2006. On April 26, 2015, Sandberg earned his 100th win as a major 
league manager on a 5-4 win against the Atlanta Braves. Two months later, 
on June 26, 2015, Sandberg resigned from the position of Phillies manager 
with his team in last place in the National League East Division at a record 
of 26-48, the worst record in Major League Baseball. Sandberg married his 
high school sweetheart, Cindy, and the couple had two children, Justin 
and Lindsey. They divorced in July 1995. Sandberg has five children in 
total, the final three with his second wife Margaret: BR, Adriane and Steven. 
He also has six grandchildren. Ryne's nephew, Jared Sandberg, was a third 
baseman for the Tampa Bay Rays from 2001–2003.[25] Sandberg and his wife, 
Margaret, founded Ryno Kid Care[26] to assist in the lives of children 
with serious illnesses. The organization provided anything from "big brothers" 
(mentors and older companions) to a home-cooked meal. Ryno Kid Care also 
provided massage therapists and clowns dressed up as doctors and nurses 
to brighten the children's day. Ryno Kid Care's mission was "dedicated 
to enhancing the lives of children with serious medical conditions and 
their families, by providing supportive, compassionate and meaningful programming."
