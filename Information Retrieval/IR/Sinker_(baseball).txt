In baseball, a sinker or sinking fastball is a type of fastball pitch which 
has significant downward and horizontal movement and is known for inducing 
ground balls.[1] Pitchers who use the sinker tend to rely on it heavily 
and do not need to change pitch speeds as much as other pitchers do because 
the sinking action induces weak bat contact. Other pitchers normally change 
pitch speeds to achieve this effect.[2][cited link refers to one analysts 
opinion] The sinker is much more often used by right-handed pitchers than 
left-handed pitchers.[citation needed] Before the 1950s, pitchers did not 
know what caused their pitches to sink or "hop." They regarded either ability 
as a "gift from heaven." Bill James cites Curt Simmons as the first pitcher 
to be able to throw both sinkers and rising fastballs, apparently indicating 
that it was not known how to make a pitch sink and how to make one hop.[1]

are current major league players who rely heavily on the sinker. One method 
of throwing the sinker is to simply grip the baseball along the two seams 
and throw it similar to a fastball. Some pitchers use a downward motion 
on their wrist when throwing it. The pitcher's palm turns to the right 
at release for a right handed pitcher. This causes a sharper sink, but 
also has a greater risk of a wild pitch. This wrist movement is also called 
pronation. Many sinker ball pitchers today turn the inside of the ball 
over just before releasing the ball, combined with slightly increasing 
the pressure on the ball with the index finger ("press inside") which creates 
a tilted sidespin motion that causes horizontal movement.[1] The sinker 
drops 3 to 6 inches more than a typical two-seam fastball which causes 
batters to hit ground balls more often than other fastballs, mostly due 
to the tilted sidespin on the ball.[1] Horizontal movement also occurs 
when sinkers are thrown.[2] Sinkerball pitchers can often get called strikes 
and swinging strikes on the pitch, so sinkerball pitches can obtain large
