The Baseball Network was a short-lived television broadcasting joint venture 
between ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball.[2] Under the arrangement, beginning 
in the 1994 season, the league produced its own in-house telecasts of games,[3] 
which were then brokered to air on ABC and NBC. This was perhaps most evident 
by the copyright beds shown at the end of the telecasts, which stated "The 
proceeding program has been paid for by the office of The Commissioner 
of Baseball".[4] The Baseball Network was the first television network 
in the United States to be owned by a professional sports league.[5] The 
package[6] included coverage of games in primetime on selected nights throughout 
the regular season (under the branding Baseball Night in America[7]), along 
with coverage of the postseason and the World Series.[8] Unlike previous 
broadcasting arrangements with the league, there was no national "game 
of the week"[9] during the regular season;[10] these would be replaced 
by multiple weekly regional[11] telecasts on certain nights of the week. 
Additionally, The Baseball Network had exclusive coverage windows; no other 
broadcaster could televise MLB games during the same night that The Baseball 
Network was televising games. The arrangement did not last long; due to 
the effects of a players' strike on the remainder of the 1994 season,[12] 
and poor reception from fans and critics over how the coverage[13][14][15][16][17] 
was implemented, The Baseball Network would be disbanded after the 1995 
season. While NBC would maintain rights to certain games, the growing Fox 
network became the league's new national broadcast partner[18] beginning 
in 1996, with its then-parent company News Corporation eventually purchasing 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. After the fall-out from CBS's financial problems[19] 
from their exclusive, four-year-long, US$1.2 billion television contract 
with Major League Baseball (a contract that ultimately cost the network 
approximately $500 million[20]), Major League Baseball decided to go into 
the business of producing the telecasts themselves and market these to 
advertisers on its own. In reaction to the failed trial with CBS, Major 
League Baseball was desperately grasping for every available dollar. To 
put things into proper perspective, in 1991, the second year of the league's 
contract with the network, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in 
the third quarter of the year. A decline in advertiser interest caused 
revenue from the sale of commercials during CBS' baseball telecasts to 
plummet. All the while, CBS was still contractually obligated to pay Major 
League Baseball around $260 million a year through 1993.[21] As part of 
MLB's attempt to produce and market the games in-house, it hoped to provide 
games of regional interests to appropriate markets. Major League Baseball 
in the process, hoped to offer important games for divisional races to 
the overall market. Owners hoped that this particular technique, combined 
with the additional division races created through league expansion (the 
Colorado Rockies and Florida Marlins had begun play the year prior) and 
the quest for wild card spots for the playoffs (1994 was the first year 
of three divisions for each league) in increasing[22] the national broadcast 
revenue for Major League Baseball in the foreseeable future. After a four-year 
hiatus, ABC and NBC[23] (who last aired Thursday Night Baseball games and 
the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week[24] respectively) returned to Major 
League Baseball under the umbrella of a revenue sharing venture called 
The Baseball Network.[25][26] Under a six-year plan, Major League Baseball 
was intended to receive 85% of the first US$140 million in advertising[27] 
revenue (or 87.5%[28] of advertising revenues[29] and corporate sponsorship[30] 
from the games until sales topped a specified level), 50% of the next $30 
million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball 
was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a 
typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous TV 
deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of 
the broadcasting revenue. The advertisers[31] were reportedly excited about 
the arrangement with The Baseball Network because the new package included 
several changes intended to boost ratings, especially among younger viewers. 
Arranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, 
to benefit NBC and ABC (who each contributed $10 million in start-up funds[32]) 
since it gave them a monopoly on broadcasting Major League Baseball games. 
The deal was similar to a time-buy, instead of a traditional rights fee[33] 
situation. It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the 
risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright (in stark 
contrast to CBS's disastrous contract with Major League Baseball from the 
1990–1993 seasons). NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment 
for each other and keep an emerging Fox, which had recently made an aggressive 
and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the television rights for 
National Football Conference games (thus, becoming a major player in the 
sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's 
NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by affiliate changes, as a number of 
stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in Detroit, WWJ-TV replaced 
WJBK). Key figures involved in the creation and production for The Baseball 
Network: The Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994 
with the All-Star Game from Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The game 
was televised on NBC[42] with Bob Costas (who during NBC's last go-around 
with Major League Baseball in 1989, teamed with Tony Kubek as the backup 
team to Vin Scully and Tom Seaver on the Game of the Week broadcasts as 
well as serving as NBC's perennial American League Championship Series 
broadcast crew in odd-numbered years beginning in 1983), Joe Morgan (who 
had previously worked for NBC from 1986 to 1987 on regional Game of the 
Week telecasts alongside Bob Carpenter[43] and served as a pre-game analyst 
alongside hosts Dick Enberg and Marv Albert during NBC's coverage of 1985 
and 1987 National League Championship Series respectively), and Bob Uecker 
calling the action and Greg Gumbel (who had just recently left CBS Sports[44] 
following their losses of the Major League Baseball and National Football 
League packages to ABC/NBC and Fox respectively) hosting the pre-game show. 
Helping with interviews were Hannah Storm and Johnny Bench. The 1994 All-Star 
Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots. This was considered 
an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost 
US$300,000.[45] After the All-Star Game was complete,[46] ABC (with a reunited 
Al Michaels,[47] Tim McCarver, and Jim Palmer along with CBS baseball alumnus 
Lesley Visser as the primary broadcasting crew[48]) was scheduled to televise 
six regular season games on Saturdays[49] or Mondays[50] in prime time. 
On the subject of play-by-play announcer Al Michaels returning to baseball 
for the first time since the infamous Loma Prieta earthquake interrupted 
the 1989 World Series, Jim Palmer (who along with Michaels and Tim McCarver 
called the 1985, 1987 and 1989 World Series, as well as the 1986 and 1988 
All-Star Games, and 1988 National League Championship Series for ABC) said, 
"Here Al is, having done five games since 1989, and steps right in. It's 
hard to comprehend how one guy could so amaze." NBC[51][52] would then 
pick up where ABC left off by televising six more regular season Friday 
night[53][54] games. The networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular 
season dates, in that no regional or national cable service (such as ESPN 
or superstations like Chicago's WGN-TV or Atlanta's WTBS) or over-the-air[55] 
broadcaster was allowed[56] to telecast a Major League Baseball game on 
those dates. Baseball Night in America[57] (which premiered on July 16, 
1994) usually aired up to fourteen games[58] based on the viewers' region 
(affiliates chose games of local interest to carry) as opposed to a traditional 
coast-to-coast format.[59] Normally, announcers who represented each of 
the teams playing in the respective games were paired with each other. 
More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-"national" 
broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call 
the games involving their teams together. Every Baseball Night in America 
game was scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or 8:00 p.m. Pacific 
Time if the game occurred on the West Coast[60]). A single starting time 
gave the networks the opportunity to broadcast one game and then, simultaneously, 
cut to another game when there was a break in action. Games involving the 
Toronto Blue Jays and Montreal Expos, were not always included in the Baseball 
Night in America package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast 
the games. When TSN (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and 
Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the BNA feed across 
their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos 
would be featured on TSN. Also, CBET (the CBC affiliate in Windsor, Ontario) 
would air Blue Jays games if the Detroit Tigers were not playing at home 
that night or if the Blue Jays scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or 
not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which 
time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team. 
Ratings for both seasons of the Baseball Night in America regular season 
coverage were substantially higher than CBS' final season in 1993 (3.8) 
or any subsequent season on Fox. Baseball Night in America earned a 6.2 
during the strike-shortened 1994 season and a 5.8 in 1995.[61] All of these 
games aired on ABC; due to the strike[62][63] NBC was unable[64] to air 
its slate of games, which were supposed to begin on August 26.[65][66] 
In even-numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game 
and both League Championship Series while ABC would have the World Series[103] 
and newly created Division Series.[104][105] In odd-numbered years, the 
postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate. 
When ABC and NBC last covered baseball together from 1976 to 1989, ABC 
had the rights to the World Series in odd-numbered years while NBC would 
cover the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in said years. 
Likewise, this process would alternate in even numbered years, with ABC 
getting the All-Star Game and both LCS in years that NBC had the World 
Series. The networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend 
broadcasts after 7:20 p.m. Eastern Time.[106] When CBS held the television 
rights, postseason games routinely aired on the East Coast at 8:30 p.m. 
at the earliest. This meant that Joe Carter's dramatic World Series clinching 
home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball 
coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8:00 p.m. pregame coverage 
(in favor of airing sitcoms such as Evening Shade) before finally starting 
its coverage at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally 
arrive at approximately 8:45 p.m. ABC won the rights to the first dibs 
at the World Series in August 1993 after ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson 
won a coin toss[107][108] by calling "heads." Ken Schanzer,[109] who was 
the CEO of The Baseball Network, handled the coin toss. Schanzer agreed 
to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining 
the order in which they would divide up the playoffs. What separated The 
Baseball Network from previous television deals with Major League Baseball, 
and was by far the most controversial part of the deal, was that not all 
postseason games (aside from the World Series) were guaranteed to be shown 
nationally.[110][111][112] To increase viewership by preventing games from 
being played in the afternoon (the league was the only professional sports 
league in the country to play postseason games during the afternoon), the 
National League and American League's division and championship series 
games were instead played simultaneously[113] in primetime, and affiliates 
could only air one game each night, which were again determined regionally.[114][115] 
If one playoff series had already concluded, the remaining games would 
be aired nationally.[116][117] Despite the frustration of not being able 
to see both League Championship Series on a national level, the 1995 LCS 
averaged a 13.1 rating.[118] Besides the 1994 All-Star Game and Game 6 
of the 1995 World Series,[119] arguably, the most famous Baseball Network 
broadcast was Game 5 of the 1995 American League Division Series between 
the New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners, broadcast on ABC.[120] It 
ended with the Mariners winning in 11 innings (via Edgar Martínez's game 
winning double), to clinch their first ever trip to the American League 
Championship Series. A major problem with Baseball Night in America[121] 
was the idea that viewers could not watch "important" games. Marty Noble 
put it in perspective by saying "With the Network determining when games 
will begin and which games are made available to which TV markets, Major 
League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy." 
What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that Baseball 
Night in America held exclusivity over every market. This most severely 
impacted markets with two teams, specifically New York City[122] (Mets[123] 
and Yankees), the Greater Los Angeles Area (Dodgers and Angels), Chicago[124] 
(Cubs and White Sox), the San Francisco Bay Area (Giants and A's), and 
even Texas[125] (Astros and Rangers). For example, if Baseball Night in 
America showed a Yankees game, this meant that nobody in New York could 
see that night's Mets game and vice versa. Things got so bad for The Baseball 
Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. KSMO-TV 
in Kansas City, the primary over-the-air station for the Kansas City Royals, 
went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from 
their broadcasts being "overexposed" and violating its territorial exclusivity. 
Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate 
could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate 
for the time zone. For example, if the Detroit Tigers (the only team in 
their market) played a road game in Seattle, Oakland[126] or Anaheim[127] 
beginning at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time (a late game), Detroit's Baseball Network 
affiliate (either WXYZ-TV or WDIV, depending on the network which held 
the rights to the game) could not air the game because the start time was 
too late for the Detroit area (11:00 p.m. Eastern Time[128]). Detroit viewers 
only had the option of viewing the early game of the night. Sports Illustrated 
columnist Tom Verducci for one, was very harsh on The Baseball Network, 
dubbing it both "America's regional pastime" and an "abomination." ABC 
Sports president Dennis Swanson,[129] in announcing the dissolution of 
The Baseball Network, said "The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball 
seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, 
whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in Washington, 
with the advertising community here in Manhattan, or with its TV partners."[130] 
Shortly after the start of the strike, Stanford University's Roger Noll[131] 
argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement ESPN cable 
renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) 
reflected "poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run 
attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters." He added that 
the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before 
the strike) from TBN was underestimated by "one-third to one-half" and 
fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal 
after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of Baseball and Billions, 
and a players' union consulting economist, insisted that baseball could 
have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of CBS (which 
offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), Fox and TBS. Baseball 
shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out." Five 
years after The Baseball Network dissolved, NBC Sports play-by-play announcer 
Bob Costas[132] wrote in his book Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball[133] 
that The Baseball Network was "stupid and an abomination." Costas further 
wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance 
of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an 
unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. 
He believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game 
and acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented[134] 
from watching many of the playoff games that they wanted to see, as all 
playoff games had been broadcast nationally[135] for decades. Costas added 
that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now 
merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a 
Big Ten football game between Wisconsin and Michigan. According to Curt 
Smith's book, The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story, the longtime New York 
Yankees broadcaster and This Week in Baseball host was quoted as saying 
"You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS]. What kind of show cancels 
a twenty-six-week-season's first fourteen weeks?"[136] (in response to 
TBN's tagline, "Welcome to the Show"[137]). During the 1995 Division Series, 
the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere 
mention of it during the Mariners–Yankees ALDS from public address announcer 
Tom Hutyler at Seattle's Kingdome brought boos from most of the crowd. 
The long-term plans for The Baseball Network began to crumble after players 
and owners went on strike on August 12, 1994.[138][139] In addition to 
the cancellation of that year's World Series,[140] ABC was denied its remaining 
Baseball Night in America telecasts and NBC was shut out of its game broadcast 
slate (which in 1994, was scheduled to begin on August 26[141]) altogether. 
Both networks elected to dissolve the partnership with Major League Baseball 
on June 22, 1995.[142][143][144][145] Both networks figured that as the 
delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement,[146] there 
was no guarantee against another strike. The Baseball Network's contract 
stipulated that negotiations could only take place with NBC and ABC[147] 
for 45 days, starting on August 15, 1995. But with NBC and ABC's refusal 
to continue after the 1995 season, baseball had to look at its future options.[148] 
In October 1995, when it was a known fact that ABC and NBC were going to 
end their television deal/joint venture with Major League Baseball, preliminary 
talks rose about CBS returning.[149][150] It was rumored that CBS would 
show Thursday night games[151] (more specifically, a package of West Coast 
interleague games scheduled for the 11:30 Eastern/8:30 Pacific Time slot) 
while Fox would show Saturday afternoon games. CBS and Fox were also rumored 
to share rights to the postseason. In the end however, CBS' involvement 
did not come to pass and NBC became Fox's over-the-air national television 
partner. Whereas each team earned about $14 million in 1990 under CBS the 
later TV agreement with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996 earned each team 
about $6.8 million.[152] To salvage the remains of the partnership, ABC 
and NBC elected to share coverage of the 1995 postseason[153] including 
the World Series.[154] ABC[155] wound up broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 
of 1995 World Series[103] while NBC would broadcast Games 2,[156] 3,[157] 
and 6[158] (which turned out to be the decisive game). Had the 1995 World 
Series gone to a seventh game, it would have then been broadcast by ABC. 
As it stands, Game 5 of the 1995 World Series is to date, the final Major 
League Baseball game to be broadcast on ABC. Others would argue that a 
primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets 
in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by 
turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the National Football 
League's television package, which focuses on localized games, with one 
or two "national" games. In the end, the venture would lose US$95 million 
in advertising[159] and nearly $500 million in national and local spending. 
The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue 
for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, 
in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this 
could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, 
which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 
on average in 1995. Both ABC and NBC soon publicly vowed to cut all ties 
with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century,[160][161] 
and Fox[162] signed on to be the exclusive network carrier of Major League 
Baseball regular season games in 1996.[163] However, NBC kept a postseason-only 
(with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the 
All-Star Game) deal in the end, signing a deal to carry three Division 
Series games, one half of the League Championship Series (the ALCS in even 
numbered years and the NLCS in odd numbered years; Fox would televise the 
other LCS in said years), and the 1997[164] and 1999 World Series respectively 
(Fox had exclusive rights to the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series). Beginning 
in 2001, Fox would become the exclusive broadcast network for the World 
Series, although it still alternates LCS series with ESPN each year (so 
that any LCS that is not televised by Fox in a given year is then broadcast 
on ESPN, and vice versa). Fox's end of the new contract[165] (which the 
network paid US$575 million for the initial five-year contract) restored 
the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week broadcasts[166] during the regular 
season (approximately 16 weekly telecasts annually that normally began 
on Memorial Day weekend), although it continued to offer a selection of 
games based on region, with usually three regionalized telecasts airing 
each week.[167][168] With ABC[169] being sold to The Walt Disney Company 
in 1996, ESPN would pick up daytime and late-evening Division Series games 
with a provision similar to its National Football League games, in which 
the games would only air on network affiliates in the local markets of 
the two participating teams. ESPN's Major League Baseball contract was 
not affected then, but would take a hit in 1998 with the new National Football 
League contract. In 2012, Fox would revive the Baseball Night in America 
title (previously used for The Baseball Network's games) for a series of 
Saturday night games.[170] Unlike The Baseball Network, Fox did not carry 
every game that was scheduled for a given Saturday, only choosing five 
to six games to distribute to its affiliates. As previously mentioned announcers 
who represented each of the teams playing in the respective games were 
typically paired with each other during games[171] on regular season Baseball 
Night in America telecasts. Also as previously mentioned, ABC used Al Michaels, 
Jim Palmer, Tim McCarver and Lesley Visser as the lead broadcasting team 
(Brent Musburger, CBS alumnus Jim Kaat, and Jack Arute became the secondary 
team for ABC). Meanwhile, NBC used Bob Costas, Joe Morgan, Bob Uecker and 
Jim Gray as their lead broadcasting team. John Saunders[172][173] was the 
studio host for ABC's Baseball Night in America coverage. Hannah Storm 
hosted NBC's studio show for the lone season in which the network was able 
to participate in The Baseball Network; Greg Gumbel[174] was NBC's studio 
host for its coverage of the 1994 All-Star Game (as previously mentioned). 
In 1995, Gumbel became the secondary play-by-play announcer for NBC (working 
with Joe Morgan on the National League Championship Series) behind Bob 
Costas. Dick Enberg[175] was supposed to be the secondary play-by-play 
announcer in 1994 for NBC, but by the following season, his other commitments 
for NBC such as golf and football rendered him unavailable to broadcast 
baseball.[176] Oh man, oh man, Tony Peña on 3 and 0! Sends everybody home!
