Phillip P. Piton (January 14, 1903 – January 23, 1983) was an American 
baseball executive, whose most significant role was as president of the 
National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues from 1964 through 
1971. He was born in Columbus, Ohio.[1][2] Piton was a valuable collaborator 
to baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis during 15 years. In this 
lapse of time, Piton excelled as an operator within the professional baseball 
industry. He retired temporarily from the commissioner’s office during 
World War II, but returned to the baseball activities when George Trautman 
was elected as the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues 
president in 1947.[2] Following his retirement in 1971, Piton turned over 
20 leagues and 155 clubs to his successor Hank Peters and, while attendance 
still was not improving, the downward slide had ended and the upward progression 
began its call.[2] Piton died in 1973 in Franklin, Ohio, just nine days
