Somerville is a borough in Somerset County, New Jersey, United States. 
As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 12,098,[8][9][10] 
reflecting a decline of 325 (-2.6%) from the 12,423 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 791 (+6.8%) from the 11,632 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] It is the county seat of Somerset County.[20][21] 
Somerville was originally formed as a town on March 25, 1863, within a 
portion of Bridgewater Township. Somerville was incorporated as a borough 
by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 16, 1909, based on the 
results of a referendum held on May 4, 1909, at which point it was fully 
set off from Bridgewater Township.[22][23] The borough is named for Somerset 
in England.[24][25] Somerville was settled in colonial times primarily 
by the Dutch who purchased land from the English proprietors of the colony. 
The Dutch established their church near what is today Somerville and a 
Dutch Reformed minister or Domine lived at the Old Dutch Parsonage from 
about 1754. The early village grew up around a church, courthouse and a 
tavern built at a crossroads shortly after the American Revolution. The 
name "Somerville" was taken from four brothers of the Somerville family, 
William, Edward, John and James from Drishane and Castlehaven, County Cork, 
Ireland, who first founded the town in the 1750s. Somerville was originally 
a sparsely populated farming community, but rapidly grew after the completion 
of the railroad in the 1840s and development of water power along the Raritan 
River in the 1850s. Early industry included brick making from the plentiful 
red clay and shale on which Somerville is built. While much of the borough 
features distinctive Victorian architecture in several neighborhoods and 
along its Main Street, other periods are represented. National Register 
sites in Somerville include the white marble 1909 Somerville Court House 
and the wooden and stone colonial Wallace House (today a museum) where 
George Washington spent a winter during the American Revolutionary War. 
Near the Wallace House is the Old Dutch Parsonage, where Reverend Jacob 
Rutsen Hardenbergh, a founder and first president of Rutgers University, 
then called Queens College, lived. Register listed Victorian structures 
include the James Harper Smith Estate (privately owned), St. John's Episcopal 
Church and rectory, and the Fire Museum (a vintage fire house). Other notable, 
register eligible structures are the Victorian train station (privately 
owned) and the municipal building, the former Robert Mansion.[26] Originally 
the center of local commerce, the borough has evolved into a destination 
for boutique retail and dining. Modern highways today surround and traverse 
Somerville, including U.S. Route 22, U.S. Route 202, U.S. Route 206 and 
Route 28 and is within 5 miles (8.0 km) of Interstate 287 and Interstate 
78, making it an important hub in central New Jersey. Main Street Somerville 
maintains most of its historical buildings, although many are now boutique 
specialty shops and second hand shops. Somerville has quite a diverse and 
large selection of restaurants that draw people from the surrounding area. 
In many ways, Somerville remains Somerset County's downtown, and is the 
heart of its designated Regional Center. Several of the factories in Somerville 
were abandoned and replaced with modern office buildings or remodeled as 
apartments. Somerville today and historically has had an important African 
American community, a distinguished member of which was Paul Robeson. Another 
famous Somerville native was famed character actor Lee Van Cleef. One of 
the founders of modern American Dance, Ruth St. Denis, made her professional 
debut at Somerset Hall, once a vaudeville theatre and today a local restaurant. 
The mix of modern amenities and an interesting and diverse past make Main 
Street, Somerville a unique destination for dining, strolling and visiting. 
The shopping center on the west side of the downtown area was demolished 
and a new shopping center, town homes and other amenities will be built 
on the shopping center land and on adjacent land in the former borough 
landfill to the south. Ground was broken for a new "world class" ShopRite 
supermarket in March 2011 and opened in November 2011.[27] Borough planners 
envision a transit village style redevelopment centered around the Somerville 
train station.[28] Somerville was hit hard by Hurricane Floyd in September 
1999, despite its having been downgraded to a tropical storm by the time 
it impacted the vicinity. The borough received a record 13.34 inches (339 mm)

flooding and considerable damage.[29] According to the United States Census 
Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.362 square miles (6.118 km2),

Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. The governing body consists 
of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all 
positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November 
general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year 
term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to 
serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for 
election each year in a three-year cycle.[6] The Borough form of government 
used by Somerville, the most common system used in the state, is a "weak 
mayor / strong council" government in which council members act as the 
legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in 
the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override 
by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee 
and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are 
made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[41][42] The 
Borough Council elects a member to serve as Council President to act in 
the absence of the Mayor. Each council member is appointed by the Mayor 
to one of six standing committee's during the Annual Reorganization Meeting 
held on January 1 of each year. As of 2016[update], the Mayor of Somerville 
is Republican Brian G. Gallagher, whose term of office expires December 
31, 2019. Members of the Somerville Borough Council are Council President 
Steve Peter (D, 2018), Jane E. Kobuta (D, 2016), Jason Kraska (R, 2017; 
elected to serve an unexpired term of office), Thompson H. Mitchell (D, 
2018), Dennis Sullivan (D, 2017), and Kenneth G. Utter (R, 2016).[3][43][44][45][46][47] 
In March 2015, Jason Kraska was chosen by the borough council to fill the 
vacant seat of Amanda O'Neill, who had resigned from office the previous 
month after having taken office for a new three-year term in January 2015.[48] 
He was elected in November 2015 to serve the balance of the term.[45] Somerville 
is located in the 7th Congressional District[49] and is part of New Jersey's 
16th state legislative district.[9][50][51] Prior to the 2010 Census, Somerville

terms of office on a staggered basis, with one or two seats coming up for 
election each year. At an annual reorganization meeting held in the beginning 
of January, the board selects a Director and Deputy Director from among
