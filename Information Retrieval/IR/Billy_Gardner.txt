As player As manager William Frederick Gardner (born July 19, 1927) is 
an American former professional baseball player, coach and manager. During 
his ten-season active career in the Major Leagues, Gardner was a scrappy, 
light-hitting second baseman for the New York Giants, Baltimore Orioles, 
Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. 
His only significant time on any team was with the Orioles, where he had 
four straight full seasons with them in 1956–59. He threw and batted right-handed, 
stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 170 pounds (77 kg). After retiring 
as a player, he spent over 20 years as a coach or manager, and is notable 
for managing the Minnesota Twins and Kansas City Royals during the 1980s. 
Gardner was signed by the Giants in 1945 and came up with them on April 
22, 1954, but he could not break into the contending team's lineup. In 
early 1956, he was purchased by the Orioles, which is where his career 
really began, and he would begin to secure himself as an everyday player. 
Gardner was not speedy, picking up a career-high of only 10 steals, but 
in his best season of 1957, he did lead the league in doubles with 36, 
and at bats with 644. He played in every one of the 154 games that season, 
batting .262 with 6 home runs and 55 RBIs. In his career, Gardner also 
came in the top 10 in hit by pitches twice (1956, '57), with a career-high 
of 8 in 1957 (fifth in the league). He wound up as a utility infielder 
on the powerful 1961 Yankees, winning the 1961 World Series with them against 
the Cincinnati Reds. In his one and only at bat of the post-season, he 
lined out to shortstop in the ninth inning of Game 2. The Yankees lost 
the game 6–2. He was never an everyday player with the Yankees, because 
they had Bobby Richardson to fill the second base spot. Gardner ended his 
career with two years on the Red Sox, picking up 70 hits with them in 283 
at bats. Nicknamed "Shotgun" for his rifle arm,[1] Gardner led American 
League second basemen in fielding percentage in 1957 (.987), including 
55 consecutive errorless games, and finished with a .976 fielding mark 
all-time. In all or parts of ten seasons, Gardner batted .237 with 41 home 
runs and 271 RBIs in 1034 games played. He picked up 841 hits, with 159 
doubles and 18 triples in 3544 career at bats. He finished with 19 career 
steals. After finishing his career with the Red Sox, Gardner stayed in 
the Boston organization for eight more seasons as a minor league coach 
and manager (1964; 1967–71) and Major League third-base coach (1965–66).[2] 
He then managed in the Kansas City Royals farm system from 1972–76, coached 
at first base for the Montreal Expos in 1977–78, and was a skipper in the 
Montreal farm system in 1979–80. Gardner rejoined the Twins as a third-base 
coach for the 1981 season. He was promoted to manager on May 23, 1981, 
replacing Johnny Goryl, and served until June 21, 1985, never leading Minnesota 
to the play-offs and avoiding a losing record only once (1984, at 81–81). 
On the bright side, Gardner incorporated young players such as Kent Hrbek, 
Kirby Puckett, Frank Viola and Tim Laudner into the Twin lineup, beginning 
the foundation of the club's two World Series clubs to come. After a 268–353 
record with Minnesota, Gardner received a second chance to manage under 
difficult circumstances with the 1987 Royals. Gardner initially signed 
as the Royals' 1987 third-base coach. But terminally ill Royals manager 
Dick Howser, diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor during the summer of 
1986, was forced to retire during spring training, and Gardner was promoted 
to fill the vacancy. He was fired on August 28 of that year after going 
62–64, and John Wathan took over. His career record as a manager was 330–417, 
a .442 winning percentage. His son, Billy Gardner, Jr., a former minor 
league infielder, is a manager in the Washington Nationals' organization. 
In 2014, Gardner Jr. was appointed the skipper of the Syracuse Chiefs of 
the International League, the Nationals' Triple-A affiliate,[3] marking
