Richard Alexander Ankiel (/ˈæŋkiːl/; born July 19, 1979) is an American 
former professional baseball center fielder and pitcher. Ankiel played 
in Major League Baseball from 1999 through 2013 for the St. Louis Cardinals, 
Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, Washington Nationals, Houston Astros, 
and New York Mets. Ankiel was a pitcher with the Cardinals from 1999 until 
2004, when he lost his ability to throw strikes consistently. After trying 
to regain his pitching form in the minor leagues, he switched to the outfield 
in early 2005. For two and a half years, he honed his skills as a hitter 
and fielder in the Cardinals' minor-league system. He returned to the Cardinals 
on August 9, 2007. As a Cardinal until 2009, Ankiel hit 47 home runs as 
an outfielder and two as a pitcher. After the 2009 season, Ankiel became 
a free agent. Subsequently, he was signed by the Royals and later was traded 
to the Braves. Ankiel became the first player since Babe Ruth to have won 
at least 10 games as a pitcher and also hit at least 50 home runs. Ankiel 
is also the only player other than Ruth to both start a postseason game 
as a pitcher and hit a home run in the postseason as a position player. 
His change of position, and the fact that he played for six teams in a 
five-season span, suggest that Ankiel's playing history represents "one 
of the stranger careers in baseball history" in the words of journalist 
Barry Petchesky.[1] Ankiel attended Port St. Lucie High School in Florida, 
where he went 11–1 with a 0.47 earned run average (ERA) during his senior 
season, striking out 162 batters in 74 innings pitched,[2] and was named 
the High School Player of the Year by USA Today in 1997.[3] The St. Louis 
Cardinals selected Ankiel in the second round of the 1997 Major League 
Baseball Draft. He received a $2.5 million signing bonus, the fifth-highest 
ever given to an amateur player.[4] In 1998, he was voted the best pitching 
prospect in both the Carolina and Midwest League, and was the Carolina 
League's All-Star starting pitcher, Baseball America's first-team Minor 
League All-Star starting pitcher, and the Cardinals' Minor League Player 
of the Year. That year, he led all minor league pitchers in strikeouts 
with 222.[5] In 1999, Ankiel was named the Minor League Player of the Year 
by both Baseball America and USA Today.[6] He was also Texas League All-Star 
pitcher, Double-A All-Star starting pitcher, Cardinals Minor League Player 
of the Year,[7] and Baseball America First Team Minor League All-Star starting 
pitcher.[8] Ankiel debuted in 1999 in Montreal, against the Expos. He pitched 
his first full season in 2000 at the age of 20 (second youngest in the 
league), posting an 11–7 record, a 3.50 ERA (tenth in the league), and 
194 strikeouts (seventh in the league) in 30 games started.[9] Ankiel threw 
a 94- to 97-mph fastball, a heavy sinker, and a fall-off-the-table curveball 
that was his main strikeout pitch. He struck out batters at a rate of 9.98 
strikeouts per nine innings (second in the National League only to Randy 
Johnson), and allowed only 7.05 hits per nine innings (second only to Chan 
Ho Park). He came in second (to the Atlanta Braves' Rafael Furcal) in the 
NL Rookie of the Year voting.[9] He received The Sporting News Rookie Pitcher 
of the Year Award. The Cardinals won the National League Central Division 
championship in 2000. Injuries to other pitchers left Ankiel and Darryl 
Kile as the only fully healthy starters left on the roster. Cardinals manager 
Tony La Russa chose Ankiel to start Game One of the National League Division 
Series against veteran pitcher Greg Maddux of the Braves. To shield Ankiel 
from media pressure, La Russa had Kile answer questions to the media as 
if to start Game One, and afterwards informed the media that Ankiel was 
starting.[10] In game one, Ankiel did not allow a run through the first 
two innings. His performance suddenly deteriorated in the third. He allowed 
four runs on two hits, four walks and throwing five wild pitches before 
being removed with two outs. Despite Ankiel facing eight batters and throwing 
35 pitches, the Cardinals won the game.[11] Ankiel shrugged off the event, 
joking that he was the first pitcher to throw five wild pitches in an inning 
since Bert Cunningham of the Players' League in 1890.[12] In his next start, 
Game Two of the National League Championship Series against the New York 
Mets, Ankiel was removed in the first inning after throwing 20 pitches, 
five of which went past catcher Eli Marrero (only two were official wild 
pitches, as no runners were on base for the others), and the first of which 
sailed over the head of Mets' hitter Timo Perez. Ankiel appeared again 
in the seventh inning of Game Five facing four hitters, walking two and 
throwing two more wild pitches. The Cardinals lost the series four games 
to one to the Mets. The source of Ankiel's problems were unknown,[13] and 
his loss of control has been compared to that of Steve Blass, who also 
became unable to consistently throw strikes for unknown reasons. A section 
of a book about Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa, Three Nights in August, 
details Ankiel's rise to the big leagues and loss of control as a pitcher 
in 2000–2001. LaRussa has stated that putting Ankiel into Game One of the 
2000 NLDS was "a decision that perhaps haunts him more than any he has 
ever made."[14] Ankiel returned to the majors in 2001 but again had issues 
controlling his pitches, walking 25 batters and throwing five wild pitches 
in 24 innings,[9] and was sent down to Triple-A. His problems in the minors 
became dramatic. In 4 1⁄3 innings, Ankiel walked 17 batters and threw 12 
wild pitches, accumulating an overwhelming 20.77 ERA.[9] He was demoted 
all the way down the Rookie League Johnson City Cardinals, where he was 
successful as both a starting pitcher and a part-time designated hitter 
(sporting a .638 slugging percentage with 10 home runs and 35 RBIs in 105 
at-bats).[9] He was voted Rookie Level Player of the Year, Appalachian 
League All-Star left-handed pitcher, Rookie League All-Star starting pitcher, 
Appalachian League Pitcher of the Year, and Appalachian League All-Star 
designated hitter. In 2002, Ankiel sat out the season due to a left elbow 
sprain, and was not cleared to throw until December. He returned to the 
minors in 2003, posting a 6.29 ERA in 10 starts[9] before undergoing season-ending 
ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (Tommy John surgery) for his left 
elbow in July. In 54 1⁄3 innings, he walked 49 batters and threw 10 wild 
pitches.[9] Ankiel returned to the majors in September 2004, posting a 
5.40 ERA in five relief appearances. Ankiel's control problems appeared 
to be gone, as he walked just one while striking out nine in ten innings.[9] 
In the minors, he walked only two batters in 23 2⁄3 innings, while striking 
out 23. However, on March 9, 2005, after a successful winter pitching in 
the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, Ankiel announced that he 
was switching to the outfield,[15] after a spring training game in which 
he threw only three strikes out of 20 pitches. He slugged .514 in Single-A, 
and .515 in Double-A, with 5 outfield assists in 55 games. In 2006, Ankiel 
was invited to spring training by the Cardinals as an outfielder, with 
a slim chance to make the team as a reserve player. His fielding impressed 
scouts and managers, and he had shown flashes of power hitting in the minor 
leagues. However, he injured his left knee before the season started, and 
had season-ending surgery on May 26.[16] Ankiel was invited to the Cardinals' 
2007 spring training and began that season at Triple-A Memphis. On May 
28, 2007, he hit two home runs in a game against the Round Rock Express. 
He also hit an RBI double and made an over-the-shoulder catch in deep center 
field that saved two runs. Ankiel was named a starting outfielder for the 
2007 Triple-A All-Star Game. Through August 8, he had 32 home runs, 89 
RBIs and was hitting .267, including a three-home run performance on June 
16 against the Iowa Cubs. He was the home run leader in the Pacific Coast 
League, and tied for second in RBIs. Defensively, Ankiel had seven errors 
in 95 games. On August 9, 2007, the Cardinals promoted Ankiel[17] from 
Memphis after a roster spot was vacated by Scott Spiezio's departure. In 
his first game, Ankiel batted second and played right field. In his first 
at bat, he received a prolonged standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd. 
During the seventh inning, he hit a three-run home run off Doug Brocail 
to right field to help the Cardinals defeat the San Diego Padres, 5–0. 
It was his first home run in the majors since April 2000 (as a pitcher), 
and made him the first player since Clint Hartung (1947) to hit his first 
major league home run as a pitcher and then hit a home run as a position 
player. The player before Hartung who accomplished this was Babe Ruth. 
After the game, Tony La Russa said that his only happier moment as a Cardinal 
was when they won the 2006 World Series.[18] Two days later, against the 
Dodgers on August 11, Ankiel drew three standing ovations. He had three 
hits, including two home runs and three RBIs and made a spectacular catch 
in right field. Ankiel's comeback prompted syndicated columnist Charles 
Krauthammer to write on August 17, 2007:[19] Ankiel hit his first grand 
slam in St. Louis against left-hander Eddie Guardado of the Cincinnati 
Reds on August 31 with the team trailing, 4–3, for an 8–5 win that broke 
a tie with Red Schoendienst for La Russa for most wins by a Cardinals manager. 
In a home game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 6, he recorded 
his second two-home run game of the season with a 3-for-4, 7 RBI effort, 
along with an over-the-shoulder catch in deep right field. On September 
23, Ankiel had his first walk-off hit, a two-run triple to win the last 
Sunday Night Baseball game of the season against the Astros, 4–3. Ankiel 
finished the year with a .285 batting average, 11 home runs, 39 RBIs, a 
.328 on-base percentage, .535 slugging percentage and an .863 OPS in 47 
games and 172 at-bats.[9] The Cardinals, who had won division titles from 
2004–2006 and the 2006 World Series, finished 2007 with a 78–84 record 
and missed the playoffs. Following the season, Ankiel admitted to using 
human growth hormone (HGH), but said he was following doctor's orders.[20] 
HGH was not banned by Major League Baseball until 2005.[21] Major League 
Baseball concluded that there was insufficient evidence of any wrongdoing 
by Ankiel.[21][22] Ankiel helped the Cardinals defeat the Colorado Rockies 
on May 6 by recording two outfield assists and a home run to propel St. 
Louis to a 6 to 5 victory. Ankiel, on both assists, threw the ball from 
deep center field to Troy Glaus at third. He finished 2008 with a .264 
batting average, 25 home runs, and 71 runs batted in.[9] Ankiel was the 
Cardinals' leading hitter in spring training but struggled at the plate 
when the season started. During a May 4 game against the Philadelphia Phillies, 
Ankiel collided with the outfield wall and was carried off the field. The 
injury was reported as whiplash, and Ankiel was placed on the disabled 
list on May 7.[23] He was re-activated on May 24.[24] Ankiel platooned 
with Colby Rasmus for much of the remainder of the year and finished the 
season with 11 home runs, 38 RBI, and a .231 batting average.[9] In January 
2010, Ankiel signed a one-year, $3.25 million contract with the Kansas 
City Royals.[25][26] He began the season as the Royals' starting center 
fielder, but was placed on the disabled list in early May with a strained 
right quadriceps after playing sparingly from April 24 on.[27] He was activated 
on July 23, and replaced an injured David DeJesus midway through the game 
in center field.[28] On July 31, Ankiel and reliever Kyle Farnsworth were 
traded to the Atlanta Braves for Jesse Chavez, Gregor Blanco and Tim Collins.[29] 
On October 8, in the second game of the 2010 NLDS against the San Francisco 
Giants, Ankiel hit his first career postseason home run into McCovey Cove 
off Giants reliever Ramón Ramírez in the top of the 11th inning, leading 
the Braves to a 5–4 win. Rick joined Barry Bonds as the only two players 
to hit a ball into the cove in the postseason.[30] Speaking on television 
after the game, Ankiel called the home run "the pinnacle of anything I've 
ever done."[31] He finished the 2010 season with a .232 batting average, 
6 HR and 24 RBI in only 74 games. On November 2, 2010, the Braves declined 
Ankiel's club option, making him a free agent.[32] On December 20, 2010, 
the Washington Nationals signed him to a one-year, $1.5 million contract. 
Ankiel played in 122 games for the Nationals in 2011, hitting .239 with 
9 home runs and 37 RBIs while platooning in center field with Roger Bernadina. 
He had a .996 fielding percentage for the season, committing one error 
in 113 games in the outfield.[33] The Nationals re-signed Ankiel to a one-year, 
$1.25 million minor league deal for 2012.[34] He began the season on the 
disabled list, rehabbing in the minors. Once promoted, his role was limited 
as a backup outfielder. In 68 games, he hit .228 with five home runs and 
15 RBIs in 158 at-bats. He started 37 games in center field and played 
62 total games in center with a .983 fielding percentage. On July 19, Nationals 
closer Drew Storen was added to the roster, and Ankiel was designated for 
assignment by the Nationals to make room.[35] On July 27, Ankiel was released 
by the Nationals. On January 17, 2013, the Houston Astros signed Ankiel 
with an invite to spring training as a non-roster invitee. On March 31, 
Ankiel homered in the Astros' regular season opener against the Texas Rangers 
in Houston. He was designated for assignment on May 6 and released shortly 
thereafter. One week later on May 13, the New York Mets signed Ankiel and 
immediately placed him into their starting lineup. He collected two hits, 
including a two-run homer, against the Cardinals in St. Louis on May 15.[36] 
His offensive production regressed, and following an 0-for-4, three-strikeout 
performance against the Miami Marlins on June 8 (giving him a combined 
60 strikeouts in 128 at-bats for the season), Ankiel was designated for 
assignment by the Mets. He became a free agent on June 13. In 45 games, 
he batted .188 with 7 HR and 18 RBI and a .422 slugging percentage. Ankiel 
announced his retirement from Major League Baseball on March 5, 2014. On 
January 8, 2015, the Washington Nationals announced they hired Ankiel as 
a "Life Skills Coordinator." In this role, Ankiel mentors players both 
at the major league level as well as in the Nationals' farm system.[37][38]
