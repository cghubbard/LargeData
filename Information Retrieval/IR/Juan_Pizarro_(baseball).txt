Juan Ramon Pizarro Cordova a.k.a. "Terín" (born February 7, 1937) is a 
former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher. He played for 18 seasons on 
9 teams, from 1957 through 1974. In 1964, he won 19 games (19–9) and pitched 
4 shutouts for the Chicago White Sox. He also was an All-Star player in 
1963 and 1964. Pizarro was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He began his 
baseball career in 1955 in Puerto Rico as a pitcher for the Cangrejeros 
de Santurce. During the 1957–1958 Winter League of Puerto Rico of the Liga 
de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Baseball League), he 
played for the Criollos de Caguas and was selected as the Most Valuable 
Player of the season. From 1959 to 1960 he pitched for the last time in 
Puerto Rico for the Cangrejeros del Santurce.[1] Pizarro signed with the 
Milwaukee Braves as an amateur free agent in 1956. After going 27–6 with 
a 2.06 earned run average in the minors,[2] he made his major league debut 
on May 4, 1957 against the Pittsburgh Pirates at only twenty years old. 
He pitched seven strong innings, giving up only one run, however, the Braves 
managed only two hits off opposing pitcher Vern Law, and Pizzarro lost 
his debut, 1–0.[3] For the season, he went 5–6 with a 4.62 ERA. The Braves 
beat the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series that year; Pizarro's 
only appearance came in Milwaukee's 12–3 loss in game three.[4] He split 
1958 between Milwaukee and the triple A Wichita Braves, and was again included 
on the Braves' post-season roster as they faced the Yankees in the World 
Series for the second year in a row. This time the Yankees won the Series 
in seven games. Pizarro's only appearance again came in a loss in game 
five.[5] Pizarro remained with the Braves through 1960, compiling a 23–19 
record and 3.93 ERA in Milwaukee. On December 15, 1960, he was traded with 
Joey Jay to the Cincinnati Reds for Roy McMillan, then immediately sent 
by the Reds with Cal McLish to the Chicago White Sox for Gene Freese. Pizarro 
enjoyed his greatest success as a member of the Chicago White Sox. In 1961, 
despite being the youngest pitcher in the starting rotation, Pizarro emerged 
as the staff's ace, leading the Chisox with fourteen wins, 188 strikeouts 
and 194.2 innings pitched. He also made fourteen appearances out of the 
bullpen, and earned his first career save on August 27.[6] He was given 
the opening day nod in 1962, and pitched a complete game 2–1 victory over 
the Los Angeles Angels.[7] In 1963, he was named to the American League 
All-Star roster, and pitched a scoreless seventh inning during the All-Star 
Game.[8] Pizarro's best season was 1964, when he went 19–9 with a 2.56 
ERA and four shutouts. Coincidentally, it was also his best season with 
the bat, as he batted .211 with a career high three home runs and career 
high fifteen runs batted in. From there, things rapidly deteriorated for 
him. Injuries limited Pizarro to just eighteen starts in 1965.[9] In 1966, 
he was used primarily in relief. Despite a respectable 8–6 record and 3.76 
ERA in 34 appearances, he pitched only 88.2 innings. Following the season, 
he was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates.[10] Though he made nine starts 
for the 1967 Pirates, he was mainly a relief pitcher, earning a career 
high nine saves. He was limited to "mop up duty" by manager Larry Shepard 
in 1968. He appeared in twelve games with the Pirates prior to being placed 
on waivers; eleven were losses. The one win, Pizarro entered the game with 
the Pirates trailing, and earned the win himself.[11] The Boston Red Sox 
claimed Pizarro off waivers on June 27. He was used primarily as a starter 
in Boston, going 6–6 with six complete games as a starter. He also earned 
two saves for the Bosox. At the start of the 1969 season, he, Dick Ellsworth 
and Ken Harrelson were sent to the Cleveland Indians for Joe Azcue, Vicente 
Romo and Sonny Siebert. Toward the end of the season, he was placed on 
waivers and claimed by the Oakland Athletics. After beginning the 1970 
season with Oakland's triple A affiliate, Pizarro was released and signed 
a minor league contract with the California Angels. He was 9–0 for the 
Hawaii Islanders when the Angels dealt him to the Chicago Cubs for Archie 
Reynolds. On September 11, he shut out the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley 
Field.[12] In his next start, he shutout Tom Seaver and the New York Mets 
1–0 at Shea Stadium. The one run was a solo shot by Pizarro in the eighth 
inning.[13] Seaver had won seven in a row at that point. His previous loss 
came on August 1, also courtesy of a complete game by Pizarro.[14] It would 
be more than 40 years before another starting pitcher broke a 0–0 tie by 
hitting a home run in the eighth inning or later: Clayton Kershaw of the 
Dodgers did this, also in the eighth inning, on Opening Day 2013.[15] For 
the 1971 season, Pizarro went 7–6 with a 3.46 ERA. He was 4–5 with a 3.94 
ERA in 1972. He spent most of the first half of the 1973 season assigned 
to the Cubs' triple A affiliate, the Wichita Aeros. After a blown save 
against the Atlanta Braves on June 17,[16] Pizarro was placed on waivers. 
He was claimed by the Houston Astros on July 8. Pizarro was 2–2 with a 
6.56 ERA out of Houston's bullpen in 1973. He was released the following 
Spring, and rejoined the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates won the National 
League East by a game and a half over the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing 
Pizarro to return to the post season for the first time since 1958. His 
only appearance in the 1974 National League Championship Series came in 
the fourth game, which the Los Angeles Dodgers won to head to the 1974 
World Series. Pizarro was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Caribbean 
Confederation and the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame.[1] Pizarro had
