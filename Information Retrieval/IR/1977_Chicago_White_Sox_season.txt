The 1977 Chicago White Sox season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished third in the American League West, 12 games behind the Kansas 
City Royals. White Sox owner Bill Veeck tried a new philosophy during the 
offseason: figuring that if he could not compete with the bigger spending 
clubs for free agents, he would "rent" them, even if only for one year. 
With this strategy in mind, he traded for Richie Zisk (who had one year 
remaining on his contract) and Oscar Gamble (also in the final year of 
his contract), hoping that he would be able to continue the practice financially.[1] 
On April 7 in Toronto, the White Sox played the Toronto Blue Jays in the 
first game in Blue Jays history.[10] The White Sox, who came to be called 
the "South Side Hitmen", were in solid contention for most of the season, 
battling the division-winning Royals and Minnesota Twins most of the way.[1] 
moved into first place in the AL West on July 1 and remained there until 
August 12.[1] Their primary weapon was their power hitting. As a team, 
the White Sox hit 192 home runs, a record which lasted until 1996.[1] Their 
displays of power caused fans to cheer for "curtain calls", where players 
came out of the dugout after hitting a home run to acknowledge those cheers. 
Some Royals players greatly resented this, and called such behavior "bush" 
and "unprofessional." The climax of this came on August 5, when White Sox 
pitcher Bart Johnson and Royals catcher Darrell Porter had a fistfight 
in a game at Kansas City.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]
