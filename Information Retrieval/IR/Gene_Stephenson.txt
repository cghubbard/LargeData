Gene Stephenson is an American college baseball coach, who served as the 
head baseball coach at Wichita State from the start of the 1978 season 
until June 2013, after that year's season was complete. As of the end of 
the 2012 season, he had compiled a 1798-647-3 (.735) record. He has the 
second most wins among active coaches, and ranks second all time in career 
victories. Only Augie Garrido of the Texas Longhorns has had more wins. 
He reached 1200 career wins in 22 seasons, a record. On May 21, 2003, he 
became only the third head coach in NCAA history to win 1400 games, and 
on May 21, 2005, he became only the second coach to win 1,500 games. Augie 
Garrido reached that mark two weeks later, and has since surpassed his 
win total. When he arrived at Wichita State, he inherited a program that 
had been dormant for over seven years. In his first year, despite not playing 
a home game until their 18th game, his Shockers finished with a winning 
record. In his third year, they made the first NCAA Tournament appearance 
in school history, and in his fifth they advanced all the way to the title 
game. The team, with four first team All-Americans (seven overall), lost 
to Miami. This was all the more remarkable considering that until 1984, 
they played at a bare-bones stadium with only a tiny bleacher section for 
seating. The momentum from their 1982 title game appearance helped spearhead 
the building of a permanent facility, Eck Stadium, in 1985. Under his leadership, 
the Shockers made seven College World Series and 26 NCAA tournament appearances, 
including 14 straight tournaments from 1987-2000. His teams never had a 
losing season. His 1982 team went 73-14, establishing an NCAA record for 
single-season wins.[2] Stephenson won his first CWS championship in 1989; 
also in 1989, the Shockers won 24 consecutive games. Prior to coaching 
at WSU, he served as an assistant coach at Oklahoma. During that tenure, 
the Sooners won five league championships, and went to five College World 
Series. For most of the day on July 10, 2005, Stephenson was the head coach 
of Oklahoma. Several hours after accepting the job, however, Stephenson 
decided to remain at Wichita State, reportedly due to scholarship issues 
at Oklahoma.[3] After 36 years, Stephenson was fired on June 4, 2013.[4][5][6][7] 
Born in Guthrie, Oklahoma; Gene attended Guthrie High School, then attended 
the University of Missouri with his first year on a football scholarship. 
He had better luck playing baseball, however; as a first baseman under 
legendary coach Hi Simmons, he was an All-American in 1967. Stephenson 
served a three-year stint in the United States Army, spending one year 
in Vietnam. Gene has two children, Jay and Ginny.[8] His younger brother 
is Phil Stephenson, who played under him from 1980 to 1983. Gene and Phil 
were inducted into the Guthrie High School Hall of Fame in 1994. Gene was 
a first team all-state honoree in football and baseball in his senior year.[8]
