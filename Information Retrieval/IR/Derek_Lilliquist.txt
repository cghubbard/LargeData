As player As coach Derek Jansen Lilliquist (born February 20, 1966) is 
the pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals and a retired professional 
baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1989 to 1996. The 
Atlanta Braves selected him in the first round of the 1987 MLB draft from 
the University of Georgia (UGA). In his MLB career, Lilliquist played for 
the Braves (1989–90), San Diego Padres (1990–91), Cleveland Indians (1992–94), 
Boston Red Sox (1995) and the Cincinnati Reds (1996). Since 2002, he has 
coached in the Cardinals organization, and began serving on the major league 
staff in 2011. While playing for UGA, Lilliquist was selected as Baseball 
America's Pitcher of the Year and was an All-American in 1987. In the major 
leagues, he functioned primarily as a relief pitcher. With Cleveland in 
1992, he posted career lows in earned run average (2.25), hits per nine 
innings (5.7), and walks plus hits per inning pitched (0.924) while appearing 
in a career-high 71 games. Derek Lilliquist graduated from Sarasota High 
School in Sarasota, Florida[1] in 1984. He played college baseball for 
the Georgia Bulldogs. In 1987, Lilliquist was an All-American selection 
according to both the American Baseball Coaches Association and Baseball 
America (BA). He was also BA's Pitcher of the Year for that season.[2] 
He helped lead to UGA to their first-ever Southeastern Conference title 
and trip to the College World Series. In three seasons at UGA, Lilliquist 
posted a 31–12 won–loss record and 3.30 earned run average (ERA).[1] The 
Atlanta Braves selected Lilliquist as the sixth overall pick in the 1987 
Major League Baseball draft and assigned him to the Gulf Coast League Braves 
in the Rookie League of Minor League Baseball that same season. There he 
made two starts, totaling 13 innings pitched (IP), allowing just three 
hits and no runs. He was promoted to the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League, 
where he made three starts, totaling 25 IP, two complete games and a 2.88 
ERA. The next season, the Braves again promoted him, this time to the AAA 
Richmond Braves of the International League, where he spent the entire 
season. Lilliquist started all 28 games in which he appeared, posting a 
3.38 ERA in a professional-high 170 2⁄3 IP. While striking out just 80 
batters, he also allowed just 36 bases on balls (BB).[3] Facing the San 
Diego Padres at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego in his MLB debut on April 
13, 1989, Lilliquist pitched the Braves to a 4–1 victory. In 7 1⁄3 IP, 
he allowed just the run on three hits while earning the win.[4] For the 
season, he pitched his MLB career-high 165 2⁄3 innings and allowed a 3.97 
ERA. However, he also allowed 202 hits for an average of 11.0 hits per 
nine innings pitched (H/9). He finished second in the National League (NL) 
in bases on balls per 9 innings pitched (BB/9) with 1.847 and fourth in 
the NL Rookie of the Year voting. On May 1, 1990, at Atlanta in Atlanta–Fulton 
County Stadium, Lilliquist become of the few pitchers to have a multi-homer 
game when he hit two home runs off Ron Darling in a Braves' 5–2 victory 
over the New York Mets.[5] His batting statistics for the Braves that season 
included eight hits in 23 at bats for a .348 batting average, two home 
runs and three runs batted in with a .609 slugging percentage. However, 
his pitching had declined since his rookie year. With a 6.28 ERA and two 
wins and eight losses in 11 starts, the Braves traded Lilliquist to the 
San Diego Padres for Mark Grant on July 12, 1990. Lilliquist's only career 
MLB complete game and shutout occurred on August 12, 1990, in a 9–0 defeat 
of the Houston Astros. He allowed four hits while striking out three.[6] 
With the Padres that season, he fared better, posting a 4.33 ERA. Spending 
most of the 1991 season in the minor leagues, the Padres assigned Lilliquist 
to the Las Vegas Stars of the Pacific Coast League. Here, he allowed 142 
hits in 105 IP and 33 games for 5.38 ERA, contributing as both a starter 
and reliever. With the Padres, he allowed 14 earned runs in 14 1⁄3 IP for 
a 8.79 ERA. The Cleveland Indians claimed Lilliquist off waivers from the 
Padres on November 22, 1991. He converted to full-time relief duty in 1992. 
Here, he posted some of his career-best numbers, including ERA, H/9, and 
walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP). In 71 games, he pitched 61 2⁄3 
innings, allowed just 39 hits for 5.7 H/9, 0.924 WHIP and a 2.25 ERA. His 
71 appearances placed fourth in the American League (AL) among pitchers. 
He also finished 22 games and saved six. Continuing on his success in 1993, 
Lilliquist appeared in 56 games, posting a 2.25 ERA, 1.297 WHIP while saving 
ten games and finishing 28. His final year in Cleveland saw his ERA rise 
to 4.91 in 1994. He signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox before 
the 1995 season, but could not replicate his success in Cleveland. He appeared 
in 28 games while posting a 6.26 ERA. The Red Sox released him in July, 
making him a free agent. The Los Angeles Dodgers signed Lilliquist on August 
1, 1995, and assigned him to their AAA minor league affiliate, the Albuquerque 
Dukes. They never called him up to the major leagues. He again became a 
free agent following the season and signed with the Cincinnati Reds for 
the 1996 season. The Reds assigned him to their AA minor league affiliate, 
the Indianapolis Indians, where he appeared in 47 games – all as a reliever 
– and posted a 2.60 ERA. The Reds called Lilliquist up to the major leagues, 
where he appeared in five games. His last MLB game was on September 6, 
1996, against the San Francisco Giants, where he faced one batter and gave 
up a hit.[7] After retiring as a player, Lilliquist coached for Vero Beach 
High School in Vero Beach, Florida, from 1998 to 2001.[1] Next, he became 
a coach in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. In 2002, he served as 
the pitching coach for the Johnson City Cardinals of the Rookie League, 
where his pitching staff posted a 5.04 ERA and 7.8 strikeouts per 9 innings 
pitched (K/9) in 67 games.[8] The next season, he handled the same role 
for the Class A Peoria Chiefs. This team posted a 3.48 ERA and 5.8 K/9 
in 138 games.[9] Lilliquist spent the next four seasons as the pitching 
coach for the Class A Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League 
(FSL) in Jupiter, Florida. His clubs twice made the playoffs. Palm Beach 
won the 2005 FSL Championship as the pitching staff registered the league's 
second-best ERA at 3.94.[1] He then contributed as the Cardinals' pitching 
coordinator from 2008–10, helping to rehabilitate injured pitchers at the 
club's spring training complex in Jupiter.[10] The Cardinals named Lilliquist 
as the Cardinals major league bullpen coach on November 2, 2010.[10] Late 
in the Cardinals' 2011 World Series–championship season, he temporarily 
replaced incumbent pitching coach Dave Duncan, who took a leave of absence 
for family reasons. On January 6, 2012, the Cardinals announced that Lilliquist 
would permanently replace Duncan, whose future remained uncertain.[11] 
During the offseason, Lilliquist resides in Vero Beach. He has two children,
