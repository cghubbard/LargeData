As Player As Coach David Lawrence McKay (born March 14, 1950 in Vancouver, 
British Columbia) is a Canadian former Major League Baseball player and 
a longtime coach at the MLB level, currently the first base coach for the 
Arizona Diamondbacks.[1] As an active player, he was an infielder for the 
Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays (where he was a player for the maiden 
edition of the Jays as an expansion team) and the Oakland Athletics. He 
is the father of Cody McKay. He is a member of the Canadian Baseball Hall 
of Fame, elected in 2001.[2] He was inducted into the Columbia Basin College 
Hall of Fame in January 2012.[3] McKay signed as an amateur free agent 
with the Minnesota Twins on June 20, 1971, and worked his way through the 
Twins minor league organization. McKay made his Major League debut on August 
22, 1975, hitting a home run in his first at-bat against Vern Ruhle of 
the Detroit Tigers in an 8-4 victory. McKay appeared in 35 games with the 
Twins, hitting .256 with two home runs and 16 runs batted in. He spent 
the majority of the 1976 season in the minor leagues, but McKay did appear 
in 45 games with Minnesota, batting .203 with no homers and eight RBI. 
On November 5, the Twins left McKay unprotected at the 1976 MLB expansion 
draft, and he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays. McKay was the Blue 
Jays starting third baseman for their first ever game on April 7, as the 
Canadian-born player had two hits in Toronto's 9-5 victory over the Chicago 
White Sox. In 95 games with the Blue Jays, McKay hit .197 with three home 
runs and 22 RBI, splitting time between second base, third base and shortstop. 
McKay became the Blue Jays starting second baseman in 1978, as he played 
in a career high 145 games, batting .238 with seven homers and 45 RBI. 
He finished sixth in the American League with six triples, and fifth with 
a .984 fielding percentage at second base. He struggled in 1979, losing 
his starting job and spending time with the Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate, 
the Syracuse Chiefs, for a majority of the season. With Toronto, McKay 
hit .218 with 0 HR and 12 RBI in 47 games. On November 5, the Blue Jays 
released McKay. McKay signed with the Oakland Athletics on April 4, 1980, 
and in 129 games with the Athletics, McKay hit .244 with one homer and 
29 RBI as a utility infielder. He improved offensively in 1981, as McKay 
hit .263 with four home runs and 21 RBI in 79 games, helping Oakland reach 
the playoffs. In the 1981 American League Divisional Series, McKay hit 
.273 with a home run and an RBI as the Athletics defeated the Kansas City 
Royals to advance to the American League Divisional Series. In the ALCS, 
McKay again hit .273, with an RBI, as Oakland lost to the New York Yankees. 
McKay struggled during the 1982 season, hitting only .198 with four HR 
and 17 RBI in 78 games. He spent the 1983 season with Oakland's A and AAA 
teams before retiring as a player; he joined the Oakland coaching staff 
under manager Jackie Moore the following season. McKay appeared in 645 
games during his career, as he recorded 441 hits and had a .229 batting 
average with 21 HR and 170 RBI. In six career playoff games, McKay hit 
.273 with 1 HR and 2 RBI. The 2014 season will mark McKay's 31st consecutive 
campaign as a Major League coach, and his first with the Diamondbacks. 
The previous three decades were spent with three teams: the Athletics (1984–95), 
St. Louis Cardinals (1996–2011) and Chicago Cubs (2012–13). Although almost 
every year of his coaching career (including his current post) has been 
spent as a first-base coach, he spent 1988 as the strength and conditioning 
coach of the A's. He and José Canseco co-authored a book on proper weight 
training techniques for baseball players. McKay began a long-term professional 
association with both manager Tony La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan 
from the midpoint of the 1986, when LaRussa and Duncan took over their 
respective positions with Oakland, through 2011 with the Cardinals. The 
three were on staff for six pennant-winning and three world championship 
teams—the 1989 Athletics and the 2006 and 2011 Cardinals. A close friend 
of LaRussa's, McKay had intended to retire from baseball when LaRussa did. 
When LaRussa announced his retirement in 2011, McKay realized he wasn't 
ready. He was offered the opportunity to remain with the Cardinals in another 
capacity, and didn’t blame the organization for not welcoming him back 
to his former job as first base coach, as the Cardinals' front office was 
under the impression that he planned on retiring with LaRussa. He joined 
the Cubs for the 2012 season.[4] After two years with the Cubs, working 
under Dale Sveum, McKay was named to the Diamondbacks' 2014 coaching staff 
by manager Kirk Gibson, replacing Steve Sax. McKay is responsible for coaching 
the team's outfielders as well as for his work at first base.[1] Duncan, 
who had been officially out of baseball for two years, returned in an advisory 
role with the Diamondbacks starting in 2014. Reversing his earlier decision 
to retire, LaRussa also joined the Diamondbacks in May 2014, in a front 
office role as Chief Baseball Officer. 2014 therefore marks the 27th season
