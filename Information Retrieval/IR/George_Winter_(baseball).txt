George Lovington Winter, nicknamed "Sassafrass" (April 27, 1878, New Providence, 
Pennsylvania – May 26, 1951), was a professional baseball pitcher. He played 
eight seasons in Major League Baseball, from 1901 through 1908, for the 
Boston Americans/Red Sox (1901–08) and the Detroit Tigers (1908). Listed 
at 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) and 155 pounds, Winter batted and threw right-handed. 
Winter attended Gettysburg College, where he was a teammate of future Hall 
of Famer Eddie Plank.[1] Winter was a member of the original Boston American 
League team, which joined the league in 1901 when it became a major league. 
The Philadelphia Athletics passed on signing him because their owner and 
manager, Connie Mack, believed he was too small to pitch in the major leagues.[1] 
He won 16 games in his rookie season for the second-place Americans, following 
up with 11 wins in 1902. Late in the season he became seriously ill with 
typhoid fever, which was nearly fatal.[2] Winter was chosen to start on 
Opening Day of the 1903 Boston season, defeating Rube Waddell and the Philadelphia 
Athletics, 9–4, at Huntington Avenue Grounds. He also wound up pitching 
in the game in which the Americans clinched the pennant, although he did 
not play in the 1903 World Series as Boston used only Cy Young, Bill Dinneen 
and Long Tom Hughes. Winter worked as a ticket taker during the series.[1] 
He was intermittently effective during the 1903 season, which the 1904 
Reach Guide attributed to not being fully recovered from his illness.[2] 
In 1904, Winter slipped down to the Americans' fifth starter behind Young, 
Dinneen, Jesse Tannehill and Norwood Gibson. He appeared in 20 games, going 
8-4. In 1905, he equaled his career high, winning 16 games while losing 
17. He had perhaps the best game of his career that year in a losing effort. 
Against the Washington Senators, he pitched a one-hitter but lost the game, 
1–0. A single by his pitching rival George Mullin was the only hit.[citation 
needed] In 1906, Winter's record slipped to 6-18 for the last-place Americans, 
with a career-worst 4.12 earned run average. He bounced back in 1907 to 
win 12 games and have a career-best 2.07 ERA. In 1908, Winter was the only 
member of the 1901 team to remain with the team, which was now known as 
the "Red Sox". However, he would not last the season in Boston, as he was 
claimed off waivers by the Tigers on July 26.[3] After not appearing in 
the 1903 World Series, Winter made his last major league appearance in 
1908 with Detroit, when he pitched one scoreless inning of relief in Game 
Four.[4] The Tigers lost to the Chicago Cubs, four games to one, in what 
is, as of 2013, the Cubs' last World Championship. Winter played two seasons 
of minor league baseball with the Montreal Royals before retiring after 
the 1910 season. In an eight-season career, Winter posted an 83–102 record 
with 568 strikeouts and a 2.87 ERA in 220 appearances, including 182 starts, 
146 complete games, nine shutouts, 36 games finished, four saves, and 1656 
innings pitched. He helped himself with the bat, hitting .193 with one 
home run and 20 RBI. He pitched 200 or more innings five times. In 2007, 
Winter was ranked at #94 in a list of the Top 100 Red Sox by a group of 
Red Sox bloggers.[5] Winter died in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey at age 73.
