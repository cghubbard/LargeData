Steven Patrick Garvey (born December 22, 1948) is an American former professional 
baseball player and current Southern California businessman.[1] He played 
in Major League Baseball as a first baseman, most notably for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers.[1] Nicknamed "Mr. Clean" because of the wholesome image he portrayed 
throughout his career in baseball, Garvey was the 1974 National League 
Most Valuable Player Award winner, a two-time National League Championship 
Series MVP (1978 and 1984), a 10-time All-Star, and a two-time MVP of the 
All-Star Game (1974 and 1978). He holds the National League record for 
consecutive games played (1,207). Born in Tampa, Florida to parents who 
had recently relocated from Long Island, New York,[2] from 1956 to 1961, 
Garvey was a bat boy for the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees and Detroit 
Tigers during spring training. Garvey played football and baseball at Michigan 
State University after graduating from Chamberlain High School. Garvey 
played his entire career in the National League West for two teams; the 
Los Angeles Dodgers (1969–82) and San Diego Padres (1983–87).[1] He batted 
and threw right-handed. In a nineteen-year career, Garvey was a .294 hitter 
with 272 home runs and 1308 RBI in 2332 games played.[1] Garvey credits 
Spartan head football coach Duffy Daugherty encouraging him to be a multi-sport 
athlete in his choosing MSU.[3] He recorded 30 tackles and earned a letter 
as a defensive back in 1967.[4] His first at-bat in a Spartan uniform resulted 
in a grand-slam home run, with the ball landing in the Red Cedar River.[5] 
His baseball jersey number 10 was retired from Michigan State University 
in 2014,[6] he was named Michigan State Baseball Distinguished Alumnus 
of the Year in 2009,[7] and he was inducted into the Michigan State University 
Hall of Fame in 2010.[4] Garvey was featured in the LA Times as one of 
the three Spartan athletes that have helped Los Angeles professional sports 
teams win a combined seven world championships.[8] Garvey was drafted by 
the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1st round of the 1968 MLB draft (June secondary 
phase).[1] He made his Major League debut on September 1, 1969 at the age 
of 20.[1] He had three plate appearances in 1969, all as a pinch hitter, 
and recorded his first hit on September 10, off Denny Lemaster of the Houston 
Astros. He played third base for the Dodgers in 1970 and hit his first 
home run on July 21, 1970, off Carl Morton of the Montreal Expos. He moved 
to first base in 1973 after the retirement of Wes Parker. Garvey was part 
of the most enduring infield in baseball history[9][citation needed] along 
with third baseman Ron Cey, shortstop Bill Russell and second baseman Davey 
Lopes. The four infielders stayed together as the Dodgers' starters for 
eight and a half years. Garvey is one of only two players to have started 
an All-Star Game as a write-in vote, doing so in 1974. That year he won 
the NL MVP award, and had the first of six 200-hit seasons. Only 15 players 
in all of Major League Baseball history have had six or more 200 hit seasons 
(as of the end of 2010). In the 1978 National League Championship Series, 
which the Dodgers won over the Philadelphia Phillies, Garvey hit four home 
runs, and added a triple for five extra base hits, both marks tying Bob 
Robertson's 1971 NLCS record and earning him the League Championship Series 
Most Valuable Player Award; Jeffrey Leonard would tie the NLCS home run 
record in the 1987 NLCS. With the Dodgers, Garvey played in 1,727 games 
over 14 seasons and hit .301 with 211 homers and 992 RBI.[1] He was selected 
to eight All-Star Games, and won the All-Star Game MVP Award for the 1974 
and 1978 games.[1] He also won the 1981 Roberto Clemente Award, finished 
in the top 10 in the NL MVP Award voting five times and won four straight 
Gold Glove Awards from 1974–1977. In December 1982 Garvey signed with the 
Padres for $6.6 million over five years in what some felt was a "masterstroke" 
to General Manager Jack McKeon's effort to rebuild the team.[10] Though 
San Diego had vastly outbid the Dodgers, McKeon particularly noted Garvey's 
value in providing a role model for younger players.[11] Additionally, 
Garvey's "box office appeal"—his impending departure from the Dodgers provoked 
some Girl Scouts to picket the stadium—helped San Diego increase its season 
ticket sales by 6,000 seats in Garvey's first year.[11] Sports Illustrated 
ranked the signing as the fifteenth best free agent signing ever as of 
2008.[12] His first season in San Diego allowed him to break the National 
League's record for consecutive games played, a feat that landed him on 
the cover of Sports Illustrated as baseball's "Iron Man."[13] (In an unusual 
homecoming, Garvey tied the record in his first appearance back at Dodger 
Stadium in Padre gold.[14]) It was Garvey's second season in San Diego, 
however, that would provide his highlight in a Padres uniform. Led by Garvey, 
winning his second National League Championship Series MVP award, the Padres 
won their first National League pennant over the Chicago Cubs in 1984.[15] 
Game 4, "the best game of the series, and one of the best games in memory", 
provided a particularly notable effort by Garvey.[15] His hot bat provided 
excellent insurance for the top of the order, including future Hall of 
Famer Tony Gwynn, who drew an intentional walk that Garvey converted into 
one of his four crucial RBI.[15] After supplying critical hits in the third, 
fifth, and seventh innings, Garvey capped off his efforts with a two-run 
walk-off home run off future all-time saves leader Lee Smith in the ninth 
inning.[15] As he rounded third base, Garvey, who after the game would 
be compared by teammates to fictional baseball hero Roy Hobbs, was met 
by fellow Padres who later carried him off the field in celebration.[15] 
Following the 7–5 Padres victory, grateful fans thronged against stadium 
barricades chanting Garvey's name.[15] Garvey, about to play in his fifth 
World Series, called the experience "the greatest playoffs I've ever seen."[16] 
Garvey set a National League record with 1207 consecutive games played, 
from September 3, 1975, to July 29, 1983. The streak ended when he broke 
his thumb in a collision at home plate against the Atlanta Braves. It is 
the fourth-longest such streak in Major League Baseball history. He is 
a member of the Irish American Hall of Fame[17] and the Michigan State 
University Athletics Hall of Fame.[18] Steve Garvey Junior High School, 
in Lindsay, California, is named for him.[19] Garvey's jersey No. 6, worn 
when he was both a Padre and Dodger, is retired by the Padres. His number 
was displayed at the site of his 1984 NLCS home run in right field at Qualcomm 
Stadium. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their 
book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Garvey, a Republican 
who harbored political ambitions after baseball, earned the nickname "Senator" 
from teammates. Those aspirations diminished after the public learned embarrassing 
details of his personal life. Also, starting in the mid-1980s he began 
the Steve Garvey celebrity Blue Marlin tournament, as well as the Steve 
Garvey celebrity skiing challenge. These were featured on ESPN co-hosted 
with wife Candace Garvey starting in 1989. Since 1988, he has been running 
Garvey Communications mainly involved in television production including 
infomercials. He is also the host of Baseball's Greatest Games. In addition 
he is hired out to do motivational speaking, mainly for corporations. Garvey 
spent 15 years in the Community Affairs department for the Dodgers, where 
he was a greeter for VIP season ticket holders and a consultant for community 
relations.[20] He was fired by the team on July 8, 2011 after some public 
comments he made critical of Dodger owner Frank McCourt and his involvement 
in a group trying to take over ownership of the team.[21] Garvey subsequently 
put together a group, that also included fellow former Dodger Orel Hershiser, 
that became involved in the bidding process for the Dodgers when the team 
was later put up for sale in 2012. His group did not make it past the first 
round of the bidding.[22][23] Garvey, who made over $10 million in his 
career only to go broke afterwards,[24] currently serves as a member of 
the board of the Baseball Assistance Team, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization 
dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League 
players through financial and medical hardships. He currently resides in 
Los Angeles and Palm Desert, California.[25] Garvey, known as "Mr. Clean", 
seemingly had a "clean" personal life during his early playing days. Manager 
Tommy Lasorda once commented, "If he ever came to date my daughter, I'd 
lock the door and not let him out."[24] In the mid to late-1980s, however, 
Garvey engaged in a series of over-lapping relationships. At the age of 
22, Garvey married Cynthia Truhan"[24] in 1971. They had two children, 
Krisha and Whitney. Cynthia left Garvey for composer Marvin Hamlisch.[24] 
(Cyndy would later claim Garvey "gave me away" to Hamlisch after a private 
two-hour conversation.[24]). Garvey was already romantically involved with 
his secretary.[24] The couple divorced in 1983. Garvey discovered in July 
1988 that Cheryl Moulton was pregnant with his child, Ashleigh, a pregnancy 
Garvey subsequently claimed was intentional on Moulton's part, but without 
his "consent."[24] Although Moulton was pregnant with his child, Garvey 
proposed to Rebecka Mendenhall, who was unaware of Moulton, in November 
1988. Garvey and Mendenhall had been in a relationship since August 1986. 
He claimed to have asked her to become engaged because of what he termed 
her "ultimatum" to move on. In January 1989, Garvey also became engaged 
to Candace Thomas, whom he met at a benefit for the Special Olympics. He 
broke the engagement with Mendenhall in a phone call the night of January 
23, within hours of learning she was pregnant. Their only child, Slade, 
was born October 13, 1989. Over the next few weeks, Garvey and Thomas began 
a whirlwind courtship that included trips to the inauguration of President 
George H.W. Bush and the Super Bowl.[24] When these details became public, 
Garvey's post-baseball political ambitions were widely seen to have disappeared 
under the weight of two illegitimate children.[24] Garvey, in the midst 
of what he later termed a "midlife disaster", sued Cyndy, his ex-wife, 
for access to his two children.[24] His daughters testified in court they 
did not love their father and did not wish to see him.[24] Cyndy Garvey 
was handcuffed and jailed, based on 167 counts of contempt.[24] Under the 
shadow of multiple lawsuits and damage to his reputation, Garvey lost business 
opportunities, declared himself broke, and found himself paying half his 
monthly television earnings in child support,[24] and millions in legal 
fees. He and Candace Thomas married in February 1989, and had three children, 
Ryan, Olivia, and Sean. The Garveys remain married and still reside in 
Southern California. In the fall of 2012, Garvey underwent an operation 
to treat prostate cancer, and continues to raise awareness for diagnosis
