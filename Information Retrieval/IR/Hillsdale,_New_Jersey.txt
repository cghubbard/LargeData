Hillsdale is a borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 10,219,[8][9][10] 
reflecting an increase of 132 (+1.3%) from the 10,087 counted in the 2000 
Census, which had in turn increased by 337 (+3.5%) from the 9,750 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[19] The populated area today known as Hillsdale took 
form in the mid-to-late 19th century as land speculators, led by David 
P. Patterson, developed subdivisions to profit from the coming of the Hackensack 
and New York Railroad (later New Jersey and New York Railroad). The area 
was incorporated as Hillsdale Township on March 25, 1898, from portions 
of Washington Township, which had, in turn, been set off from Harrington 
Township in 1840. Portions of the township were taken on April 30, 1906, 
to create the township of River Vale. Hillsdale was reincorporated as a 
borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1923, based 
on the results of a referendum held on April 24, 1923.[20] The borough's 
name derives from its location in a "dale among the hills".[21] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.957 
square miles (7.659 km2), including 2.949 square miles (7.639 km2) of land

of Woodcliff Lake Reservoir lies inside the borough, at the southeast end 
of the reservoir, with Church Road following along the southern end of 
the spillway.[22][23] The borough borders Ho-Ho-Kus, Park Ridge, River 
Vale, Saddle River, Washington Township, Westwood, and Woodcliff Lake.[24]

under the Borough form of New Jersey municipal government. The governing 
body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, 
with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the 
November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to 
a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members 
elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats 
coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[6] The Borough 
form of government used by Hillsdale, the most common system used in the 
state, is a "weak mayor / strong council" government in which council members 
act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting 
only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an 
override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes 
committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments 
are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.[39][40]

vacancy of Jonathan DeJoseph when he was named as borough administrator, 
Frank Pizzella replacing Rod Capawana, and John MacEwen replacing the seat 
that Leslie Becker had briefly occupied.[47] Hillsdale is located in the
