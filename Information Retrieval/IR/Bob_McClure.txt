As player As coach Robert Craig McClure (born April 29, 1952) is an American 
professional baseball coach and a former Major League pitcher. On November 
21, 2013, he was named to manager Ryne Sandberg's staff as the 2014 pitching 
coach of the Philadelphia Phillies.[1] McClure was born in Oakland, California 
and attended Terra Nova High School in Pacifica, California and College 
of San Mateo in San Mateo, California. He was originally drafted by the 
Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round of the January phase of the 1973 
Major League Baseball draft, however chose not to sign. Instead, he signed 
with the Kansas City Royals, who selected him in the secondary phase of 
the draft that June, also in the third round. The Royals used McClure as 
a starting pitcher his first professional season in the Pioneer League 
in 1973. He went 10–2 with a 2.11 earned run average for the Billings Mustangs. 
He started in 1974 as well, and was converted to a relief pitcher in 1975. 
He made his major league debut with the Royals on August 13, 1975 against 
the Baltimore Orioles, pitching one inning, striking out one and walking 
one.[2] On September 23, he entered a ballgame at Kauffman Stadium against 
the Texas Rangers with one out and one on in the second inning. He pitched 
six scoreless innings to earn his first major league win.[3] McClure spent 
most of 1976 with the triple A Omaha Royals, appearing in only eight games 
and pitching only four innings with the big league club. On December 6, 
1976, the Milwaukee Brewers sent catcher Darrell Porter and pitcher Jim 
Colborn to the Kansas City Royals for Jamie Quirk, Jim Wohlford and a player 
to be named later. On March 15, 1977, McClure was sent to the Brewers to 
complete the deal. With the Brewers, McClure led his team in saves in 1978 
and 1980, then spent almost all of 1981 on the disabled list with arm problems. 
In 1982, he was moved to the starting rotation and had a 12–7 mark for 
the American League champion Brewers, but he returned to the bullpen after 
incumbent closer Rollie Fingers was unavailable for the postseason. In 
the 1982 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, McClure made five 
appearances, saving Games Four and Five, but he also had two losses, including 
a blown save in the decisive Game Seven. McClure came back to the Brewers 
starting rotation in 1983 and 1984, before returning to relief duties in 
1985. Midseason 1986, he was traded to the Montreal Expos, going 2–5 with 
a 3.02 ERA his first season in the National League. The following season, 
his record improved to 6–1 out of the Montreal bullpen. McClure was 1–3 
with a 6.16 ERA when the Expos released him in July 1988. He signed with 
the New York Mets shortly afterwards, where he was reunited with his CSM 
teammate Keith Hernandez, with whom he also played Little League baseball 
when they were younger.[4] After just one season with the Mets, he was 
released, and signed as a free agent with the California Angels for 1989. 
Despite going 8–1 in his first two seasons with the Angels, McClure pitched 
poorly in early 1991, and was released by the Angels in June. McClure signed 
with the St. Louis Cardinals for the remainder of the 1991 season, and 
remained with the Cards through 1992. He signed with the expansion Florida 
Marlins for their inaugural season in 1993, and retired after being released 
by the Marlins in May. Following his playing career, McClure worked as 
a pitching coach for the Colorado Rockies organization from 1999 through 
2005, including four seasons at Triple-A Colorado Springs. For the 2006 
season, new Royals manager Buddy Bell asked McClure to replace Guy Hansen 
as their new pitching coach.[5] The Royals fired McClure from his pitching 
coach position following the 2011 season.[6] In November 2011, the Boston 
Red Sox confirmed reports that they had hired McClure as a scout, roving 
minor league pitching instructor, and special assistant for player development.[7] 
On December 21, 2011, McClure was promoted to pitching coach for Boston's 
major league team.[8] He was fired from this position on August 20.[9] 
In November 2013, McClure was hired by the Phillies as their pitching coach,
