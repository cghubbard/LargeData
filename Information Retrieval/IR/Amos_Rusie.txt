Amos Wilson Rusie (May 30, 1871 – December 6, 1942), nicknamed "The Hoosier 
Thunderbolt", was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball 
during the late 19th century. He had a 10-season career in the National 
League (NL), which consisted of one season with the Indianapolis Hoosiers 
in 1889, eight with the New York Giants from 1890 to 1898, and one with 
the Cincinnati Reds in 1901. He is best known for the speed in which he 
pitched a baseball. The velocity of his fastball was unknown, but it has 
been estimated that he threw it in the mid- to upper 90s. He led the league 
in strikeouts five times, and won 20 or more games eight times. Though 
he did throw hard, he did not have good control of his pitches, leading 
the league in walks five times and being seventh all-time among the career 
pitching leaders in that category. In 1890 he walked 289, the all-time 
single-season record. In 1897 one of his fastballs struck future Hall of 
Fame Hughie Jennings in the head, rendering him comatose for four days 
before recovery. Rusie's wildness had been a catalyst for officials to 
change the distance from the pitching rubber to home plate from 50 feet 
(15 m) to the current 60 feet (18 m), 6 inches. This ruling was made effective 
for the 1893 season, at the peak of Amos Rusie's pitching prowess. The 
distance change did not reduce Rusie's effectiveness, as he led the league 
in strikeouts for three straight seasons afterward, while also winning 
what later would be known as the pitching triple crown in 1894. For his 
accomplishments, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977 
by the Veterans Committee. Rusie was born on May 30, 1871 in Mooresville, 
Indiana, to mason and plasterer William Asbury Rusie and his wife Mary 
Donovan.[1] When he was still young, his family moved to nearby Indianapolis, 
Indiana, where he eventually quit school to work in a factory.[1] It was 
during this time, when he was playing for a Semi-professional Indianapolis 
baseball team named the "Sturm Avenue Never Sweats", that scouts first 
took notice of the speed with which he threw a baseball, and his effectiveness 
as a pitcher when he shutout touring National League baseball teams, the 
Boston Beaneaters and the Washington Senators.[1] In 1889, at the age of 
18, Rusie signed with the Burlington Babies of the Central Interstate League.[2] 
However, he was signed shortly thereafter by the Indianapolis Hoosiers 
of the NL, and made his major league debut on May 9 in a 13-2 loss to the 
Cleveland Blues, pitching in relief of starting pitcher Jim Whitney.[3][4] 
In 33 games pitched during the 1889 season, he posted a 12–10 win–loss 
record, he started 22, completed 19, and recorded one shutout.[4] Although 
his fastball was difficult to hit, he did not have good control of it, 
walking 116 batters in 225 innings pitched, although he struck out 109 
and led the league with 11 games finished (as a relief pitcher).[4] The 
Hoosiers disbanded at the conclusion of the 1889 season, and on March 22, 
1890, he, along with many of his teammates, were transferred to the New 
York Giants by the league to strengthen the NL's largest market.[1][4] 
Coming into the 1890 season, Rusie filled the starting position that was 
vacated by future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe, who had joined the New York 
Giants of the newly formed Players' League (PL).[5][6] Instead of evenly 
splitting pitching duties with Mickey Welch, another future Hall of Fame 
player, as Keefe had done the preceding five seasons, he started 62 games 
to Welch's 37.[6][7][8][9][10][11] Rusie quickly became a sensation among 
fans, media, and society owing to the combination of his pitching velocity 
and physical size at 6-foot-1-inch (1.85 m), 200-pound (91 kg), which was 
considered large for the era.[1] The fans began calling him the "Hoosier 
Thunderbolt", while famed vaudeville act Weber and Fields used his name, 
a paperback book, Secrets of Amos Rusie, The World's Greatest Pitcher, 
How He Obtained His Incredible Speed on Balls, was available for a quarter, 
a drink was named after him, and he received a message from the popular 
performer Lillian Russell.[1] On May 9, the Giants defeated the Boston 
Beaneaters by a score of 16–3, doing so by committing no errors, very rare 
for the era, and with Rusie allowing just 6 hits.[12] Three days later, 
on May 12, Rusie was on the winning side of a pitching duel with future 
Hall of Famer Kid Nichols, in a game that ended with a home run by the 
Giants' Mike Tiernan in the 13th inning.[12] The home run was described 
as a "tape measure" hit, sailing over the outfield fence and landing in 
an adjacent baseball field, Brotherhood Park, where a PL game was being 
played at the same time, causing fans of both parks to cheer.[12] Rusie 
completed the season with 67 games pitched, 62 games started, 56 complete 
games, four shutouts, 548.2 innings pitched, 2.56 earned run average (ERA), 
and a league-leading total of 341 strikeouts, the highest seasonal total 
he would have in his career.[13] Due to the lack of control of his pitches, 
however, he also led the league with 289 walks, the all-time record for 
a season, and tossed 36 wild pitches, another total that topped the league.[13][14] 
The Giants finished in sixth place among the eight NL teams, while Rusie 
won 29 games and had a league-leading 34 losses.[13][15] As a hitter, he 
had a successful season with .278 batting average in 284 at bats, 13 doubles, 
six triples, and he scored 31 runs.[13] Rusie married May Smith in Muncie, 
Indiana on November 8, 1890, in the Delaware County Clerk's Office.[1] 
After the demise of the PL following the 1890 season, the Giants absorbed 
many of the players who had been on the crosstown rival's roster. Future 
Hall of Famers Roger Connor, Jim O'Rourke, Buck Ewing, and Tim Keefe simply 
returned to the team, as well as George Gore, while John Ewing, and Danny 
Richardson were new signings, solidifying both a powerful hitting line-up 
and a solid pitching rotation for the 1891 season.[11][16] While the upgraded 
Giants improved their final standings by finishing in third place among 
eight teams in the NL, and had a four-game lead over the Chicago Colts 
on June 16 when Rusie held them scoreless, and were 2.5 games behind the 
Colts on September 19, they were 13 games back at the close of the season.[12][17] 
After having been on the losing end of no-hitter by Tom Lovett of the Brooklyn 
Bridegrooms on June 22, Rusie returned the favor by throwing one of his 
own against them just over a month later on July 31.[12] After winning 
both games of a doubleheader against the Bridegrooms in September, Rusie 
and several other star players were rested for the remainder of the season, 
a five-game series against the Boston Beaneaters.[12] Rusie's 337 strikeouts 
and 262 bases on balls led the league for the second consecutive year, 
and his six shutouts marked the first time he led the league in that category. 
His record improved to 33-20, and he followed that up in 1892 with a record 
of 32-31, 304 strikeouts and 270 walks. With the pitching area being moved 
back in 1893, Rusie's strikeout total dropped to 208; still he was the 
league leader. The 1893 campaign was a truly extraordinary one for Amos 
Rusie. He had 50 complete games in 52 starts and went 33-21. In 1894, Rusie 
won pitching's triple crown. He led the league in wins with 36-13, strikeouts 
with 195, and with a league best ERA of 2.78 (especially spectacular considering 
that the league average that year was 5.32). He also led the league in 
walks for the fifth straight time with an even 200. After the conclusion 
of the 1894 regular season, a Pittsburgh sportsman named William C. Temple 
sponsored a trophy for the winner between the regular season 1st and 2nd 
place teams in the National League. The runner-up Giants swept the Baltimore 
Orioles, who featured Hall of Famers John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson, 
4-0. Amos Rusie was virtually untouchable in the Temple Cup, giving up 
only one earned run while winning two complete games and compiling a 0.50 
ERA; if that was not enough, he even batted .429. Amos Rusie's win total 
that year was fourth best since the establishment of the modern pitching 
distance of 60’-6". Amos Rusie won his last strikeout crown in the 1895 
campaign with 201. However, he finished with a mediocre (by Rusie's standards) 
23 wins and 23 losses. After a bitter contract dispute with Giants' owner 
Andrew Freedman, Rusie responded by publicly thumbing his nose at Freedman 
— the 19th century variant of the middle finger. He was fined $200 (he 
made only $2,500 a year). Rusie refused to play until Freedman returned 
his money and ended up holding out for the entire 1896 season. It was a 
fiasco for baseball; fans boycotted and the press railed against the owners. 
Owners implored Rusie and Freedman to compromise; neither would budge. 
The holdout was finally settled just before the 1897 season, as the owners 
collaborated for recoupment of the garnished wages, as well as a $5,000 
settlement. This was partially out of respect for Rusie. However, the primary 
motivator was the threat of legal action against the reserve clause had 
his case gone to court.[citation needed] Following the 1898 season, a combination 
of hearing damage from a line drive to the head, arm trouble, and personal 
problems kept him out of baseball for two years.[citation needed] In 1900, 
he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Christy Mathewson. In 1901, Rusie 
pitched poorly in three games before retiring. He finished his career with 
245 wins, 174 losses, 1934 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA. Rusie was inducted
