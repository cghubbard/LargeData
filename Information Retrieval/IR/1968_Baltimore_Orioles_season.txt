The 1968 Baltimore Orioles season was a season in American baseball. The 
team finished second in the American League with a record of 91 wins and 
71 losses, 12 games behind the AL and World Series champion Detroit Tigers. 
The team was managed by Hank Bauer, until he was replaced right after the 
All-Star break by Earl Weaver. The Orioles' home games were played at Memorial 
Stadium. Following the season, it was announced that the American League, 
along with the National League, would be split into two divisions for the 
1969 season in order to accommodate the admittance of two new franchises 
to each league. The Orioles were assigned to the new American League East 
division. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Infielders Coaches Note:
