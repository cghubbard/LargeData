The 1953 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 20th playing of the 
mid-summer classic between the All-Stars teams of the American League (AL) 
and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. 
The game was held on July 14, 1953 at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, home 
of the Cincinnati Redlegs National League team. The team changed its name 
from Reds to Redlegs during the height of anti-communism in the United 
States. From 1949 through 1952, manager Casey Stengel had taken the New 
York Yankees to four consecutive World Series titles, but this time turned 
on his fourth defeat in a row at the helm of the American League team. 
Robin Roberts (NL) and Billy Pierce (AL) found themselves in a pitching 
duel during three innings of one-hit shutout ball, but they were not a 
factor in the decision. AL relievers Allie Reynolds (2), Mike Garcia (1) 
and Satchel Paige (2) combined to give up five runs to the NL hitters. 
The NL attack was led by Enos Slaughter, who went 2-for-3 with two runs 
and an RBI, while Pee Wee Reese hit a single and a double and drove in 
two runs. Minnie Miñoso went 2-for-2 and drove in the only run for the 
AL team. NL relievers Warren Spahn and Curt Simmons pitched two scoreless 
innings each and Murry Dickson allowed the only AL run in two innings of 
work. Spahn was the winning pitcher and Reynolds the loser, while Dickson 
earned the save. In one of the greatest defensive plays in All-Star Game 
history, Slaughter ran down a line-drive hit by Harvey Kuenn, making a 
diving, tumbling grab on the right field line. The National League extended 
their winning-streak to four consecutive games, matching the previous record 
set by the American League from 1946 to 1949, After the game, the American 
League leads 12–8. Players in italics have since been inducted into the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame. Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager
