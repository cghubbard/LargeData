On June 28, 1997, the Phillies played the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field 
in Atlanta. In honor of the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking 
professional baseball's color-line, the Braves hosted a Turn Back the Clock 
game. The Braves wore 1938 Atlanta Black Crackers home uniforms and the 
Phillies wore 1938 Philadelphia Stars road uniforms. In 1938, the Black 
Crackers had played in the Negro American League and the Stars in the Negro 
National League.[5] Phillies' first round draft pick J. D. Drew and his 
agent Scott Boras elected not to sign with the Phillies, sticking to their 
guarantee that they would not sign for less than $10 million. The Phillies 
had no plan to pay an unproven player this amount of money, and despite 
Boras' warnings, drafted Drew nonetheless. Consequently, Drew ended up 
playing for the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. The 
Phillies played extremely poorly in the first 100 games of the season, 
going 30-70, including a 4-22 stretch in the month of June. The team made 
a miraculous comeback in the last 62 games, going 38-24, the best of any 
team in the National League during that span. It was not enough, however, 
to get them out of last place. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position;
