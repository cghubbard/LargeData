Hudson County, a county in the U.S. state of New Jersey, lies west of the 
lower Hudson River, which was named for Henry Hudson, the sea captain who 
explored the area in 1609.[4] Part of New Jersey's Gateway Region in the 
New York metropolitan area, Jersey City is its largest city and county 
seat.[1][5] As of 2015, Hudson County was the fastest growing county in 
New Jersey compared to 2010, with a Census-estimated population in 2015 
of 674,836,[3][6] an increase of 6.4% from the 2010 United States Census, 
when its population was enumerated at 634,266,[2] in turn an increase of 
25,291 (+4.2%) from the 608,975 enumerated in the 2000 Census.[7] Hudson 
County is the fourth-most populous county in the state.[8][9] Hudson County 
is the geographically smallest and most densely populated county in New 
Jersey and the sixth-most densely populated county in the United States, 
with 13,731.4 residents per square mile of total area in 2010.[10] There 
are 12 municipalities in Hudson County, listed with area in square miles 
and 2010 Census data for population and housing.[11] North Hudson and West 
Hudson each comprise municipalities in their distinct areas. According 
to the 2010 Census, the county had a total area of 62.31 square miles (161.4 km2), 
including 46.19 square miles (119.6 km2) of land (74.1%) and 16.12 square 
miles (41.8 km2) of water (25.9%).[12] Based on land area, it is the smallest 
of New Jersey's 21 counties, less than half the size of the next smallest 
(Union County)[12] and the eighth-smallest of all counties in the United 
States.[13] Hudson is located in the heart of New York metropolitan area 
in northeastern New Jersey. It is bordered by the Hudson River and Upper 
New York Bay to the east; Kill van Kull to the south; Newark Bay and the 
Hackensack River or the Passaic River to the west; its only land border 
is shared with Bergen County to the north and west.[14] The topography 
is marked by the New Jersey Palisades in the north with cliffs overlooking 
the Hudson to the east and less severe cuesta, or slope, to the west. They 
gradually level off to the southern peninsula, which is coastal and flat. 
The western region, around the Hackensack and Passaic is part of the New 
Jersey Meadowlands. Much of the land along the county's extensive shoreline 
and littoral zone was created by land reclamation.[15] The highest point, 
at 260 feet (79 m) above sea level, is in West New York;[16][17] the lowest 
point is at sea level. North Bergen is the city with the second most hills 
per square mile in the United States behind San Francisco.[18] Ellis Island 
and Liberty Island, opposite Liberty State Park, lie entirely within Hudson 
County's waters, which extend to the New York state line. Liberty Island 
is wholly part of New York. Largely created through land reclamation, Ellis 
Island covers a land area of 27.5 acres (11.1 ha), with the 2.74-acre (1.11 ha) 
natural island and contiguous areas comprising an 3.3 acres (1.3 ha) exclave 
of New York.[19][19][20] Shooters Island, in the Kill van Kull, is also 
shared with New York. Robbins Reef Light sits atop a reef which runs parallel 
the Bayonne and Jersey City waterfront. Much of the county lies between 
the Hackensack and Hudson Rivers on geographically long narrow peninsula, 
(sometimes called Bergen Neck), that is a contiguous urban area where it's 
often difficult to know when one's crossed a civic boundary. These boundaries 
and the topography-including many hills and inlets-create very distinct 
neighborhoods. Kennedy Boulevard runs the entire length of the peninsula.[21] 
Numerous cuts for rail and vehicular traffic cross Bergen Hill. Counties 
adjacent to Hudson are New York County, New York and Kings County, New 
York to the east; Essex County, New Jersey and Union County, New Jersey 
to west; Richmond County, New York to the south; and Bergen County, New 
Jersey, the only one with which it shares a land border, to the north and 
west. Given its proximity to Manhattan, it is sometimes referred to as 
New York City's sixth borough.[22][23][24] At the time of European contact 
in the 17th century, Hudson County was the territory of the Lenape (or 
Lenni-Lenape), namely the bands (or family groups) known as the Hackensack, 
the Tappan, the Raritan, and the Manhattan. They were a seasonally migrational 
people who practiced small-scale agriculture (companion planting) augmented 
by hunting and gathering which likely, given the topography of the area, 
included much (shell)fishing and trapping. These groups had early and frequent 
trading contact with Europeans. Their Algonquian language can still be 
inferred in many local place names such as Communipaw, Harsimus, Hackensack, 
Hoboken, Weehawken, Secaucus, and Pamrapo Henry Hudson, for whom the county 
and river on which it sits is named, established a claim for the area in 
1609 when anchoring his ship the Halve Maen (Half Moon) at Harsimus Cove 
and Weehawken Cove.[25] The west bank of the North River (as it was called) 
and the cliffs, hills, and marshlands abutting and beyond it, were settled 
by Europeans (Dutch, Flemish, Walloon, Huguenot) from the Lowlands around 
the same time as New Amsterdam. In 1630, Michael Pauw received a land patent, 
or patroonship and purchased the land between the Hudson and Hackensack 
Rivers, giving it the Latin-ized form of his name, Pavonia.[26] He failed 
to settle the area and was forced to return his holdings to the Dutch West 
India Company. Homesteads were established at Communipaw (1633), Harsimus 
(1634), Paulus Hook (1638) and Hoebuck (1643). Relations were tenuous with 
the Lenape, and eventually led to Kieft's War, which began as a slaughter 
by the Dutch at Communipaw and is considered to be one of the first genocides 
of Native Americans by Europeans. A series of raids and reprisals across 
the province lasted two years, and ended in an uneasy truce. Other homesteads 
were established at Constable Hook (1646), Awiehaken (1647), and other 
lands at Achter Col on Bergen Neck. In 1658, Director-General Peter Stuyvesant 
of New Netherland negotiated a deal with the Lenape to re-purchase the 
area named Bergen, "by the great rock above Wiehacken," including the whole 
peninsula from Sikakes south to Bergen Point/Constable Hook.[27] In 1661, 
a charter was granted the new village/garrison at the site of present-day 
Bergen Square, establishing what is considered to be the oldest self-governing 
municipality in New Jersey. The British gained control of the area in 1664, 
and the Dutch finally ceded formal control of province to the English in 
1674. By 1675, the Treaty of Westminster finalized the transfer and the 
area became part of the British colony of East Jersey, in the administrative 
district of Bergen Township. The county's seat was transferred to Hackensack 
in 1709, after Bergen County was expanded west. Small villages and farms 
supplied the burgeoning city of New York, across the river, notably with 
oysters from the vast beds in the Upper New York Bay, and fresh produce, 
sold at Weehawken Street, in Manhattan. During the American Revolutionary 
War the area was under British control which included garrisons at Bulls 
Ferry and the fort at Bergen Neck. Colonialist troops used the heights 
to observe enemy movements. The Battle of Paulus Hook, a surprise raid 
on a British fortification in 1779, was seen as a victory and morale booster 
for revolutionary forces. Many downtown Jersey City streets bear the name 
of military figures Mercer, Greene, Wayne, and Varick among them. Weehawken 
became notorious for duels, including the nation's most famous between 
Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804. Border conflicts for control 
of the waterfront with New York (which claimed jurisdiction to the high 
water line [28] and the granting of ferry concessions) restricted development 
though some urbanization took place in at Paulus Hook and Hoboken, which 
became a vacation spot for well-off New Yorkers. The Morris Canal, early 
steam railroads, and the development of the harbor stimulated further growth. 
In September 1840, Hudson County was created by separation from Bergen 
County and annexation of some Essex County lands, namely New Barbadoes 
Neck. During the 19th century, Hudson played an integral role in the Underground 
Railroad, with four routes converging in Jersey City.[29] Most of Hudson 
County, apart from West Hudson, was part of Bergen Township, which dates 
back to 1661 and was formally created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
on February 21, 1798, as one of the first group of 104 townships formed 
in New Jersey, while the area was still a part of Bergen County.[30] As 
originally constituted, Bergen Township included the area between the Hudson 
River on the east, the Hackensack River to the west, south to Constable 
Hook/Bergen Point and north to the present-day Hudson-Bergen border. For 
the next 127 years civic borders within the county took many forms, until 
they were finalized with the creation of Union City in 1925. The City of 
Jersey was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 
28, 1820, from portions of Bergen Township. The city was reincorporated 
on January 23, 1829, and again on February 22, 1838, at which time it became 
completely independent of Bergen Township and was given its present name. 
On February 22, 1840, it became part of the newly created Hudson County.[30] 
As Jersey City grew, several neighboring communities were annexed: Van 
Vorst Township (March 18, 1851), Bergen City and Hudson City (both on May 
2, 1870), and Greenville Township (February 4, 1873).[30] North Bergen 
was incorporated as a township on April 10, 1843, by an act of the New 
Jersey Legislature, from Bergen Township. Portions of the township have 
been taken to form Hoboken Township (April 9, 1849, now the City of Hoboken), 
Hudson Town (April 12, 1852, later part of Hudson City), Hudson City (April 
11, 1855, later annexed by Jersey City), Guttenberg (formed within the 
township on March 9, 1859, and set off as an independent municipality on 
April 1, 1878), Weehawken (March 15, 1859), Union Township and West Hoboken 
Township (both created on February 28, 1861), Union Hill town (March 29, 
1864) and Secaucus (March 12, 1900).[30] Hoboken was established in 1804, 
and formed as a township on April 9, 1849, from portions of North Bergen 
Township and incorporated as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held 
on March 29, 1855, ratified an Act of the New Jersey Legislature signed 
the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born.[30][31] Weehawken was 
formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 15, 
1859, from portions of Hoboken and North Bergen. A portion of the township 
was ceded to Hoboken in 1874. Additional territory was annexed in 1879 
from West Hoboken.[30] West New York was incorporated as a town by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on July 8, 1898, replacing Union Township, 
based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier.[30] Kearny 
was originally formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature 
on April 8, 1867, from portions of Harrison Township. Portions of the township 
were taken on July 3, 1895, to form East Newark. Kearny was incorporated 
as a town on January 19, 1899, based on the results of a referendum held 
two days earlier.[30] Bayonne was originally formed as a township on April 
1, 1861, from portions of Bergen Township. Bayonne was reincorporated as 
a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 10, 1869, replacing 
Bayonne Township, subject to the results of a referendum held nine days 
later.[30] Soon after the Civil War the idea of uniting all of the town 
of Hudson County in one municipality of Jersey City began to gain favor. 
In 1868 a bill for submitting the question of consolidation of all of Hudson 
County to the voters was presented to the board of chosen freeholders. 
The bill did not include the western towns of Harrison and Kearny but included 
all towns east of the Hackensack River.[32] The bill was approved by the 
State legislature on April 2, 1869 and the special election was scheduled 
for October 5, 1869. An element of the bill provided that only contiguous 
towns could be consolidated. The results of the election were as follows: 
In Favor/Against While a majority of the voters approved the merger, only 
Jersey City, Hudson and Bergen could be consolidated since they were the 
only contiguous approving towns. Both the Town of Union and Union Township 
could not be included due to the dissenting vote of West Hoboken which 
lay between them and Hudson City. On March 17, 1870, Jersey City, Hudson 
City and Bergen merged into Jersey City. Only three years later the present 
outline of Jersey City was completed when Greenville agreed to merge into 
the Greater Jersey City. Union City was incorporated as a city by an act 
of the New Jersey Legislature on January 1, 1925, replacing both Union 
Hill and West Hoboken Township.[30] During the latter half of the 19th 
and early part of the 20th centuries, Hudson experienced intense industrial, 
commercial and residential growth.[26][33] Construction, first of ports, 
and later railroad terminals, in Jersey City, Bayonne, Hoboken, and Weehawken 
(which significantly altered the shoreline with landfill) fueled much of 
the development. European immigration, notably German-language speakers 
and Irish (many fleeing famine) initiated a population boom that would 
last for several decades. Neighborhoods grew as farms, estates, and other 
holdings were sub-divided for housing, civic and religious architecture. 
Streets (some with trolley lines) were laid out. Stevens Institute of Technology 
and Saint Peter's University were established. Before the opening, in 1910, 
of the Pennsylvania Railroad's North River Tunnels under the Hudson, trains 
terminated on the west bank of the river, requiring passengers and cargo 
to travel by ferry or barge to New York. Transfer to the Hudson and Manhattan 
Railroad tubes (now PATH) became possible upon its opening in 1908. Hoboken 
Terminal, a national historic landmark originally built in 1907 by the 
Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad to replace the previous one, 
is the only one of five major rail/ferry terminals that once dotted the 
waterfront still in operation. West Shore Railroad Terminal in Weehawken, 
Erie Railroad's Pavonia Terminal and Pennsylvania Railroad's Exchange Place 
in Jersey City were all razed. Central Railroad of New Jersey's Communipaw 
Terminal, across a small strait from Ellis Island and The Statue of Liberty, 
played a crucial role in the massive immigration of the period, with many 
newly arrived departing the station to embark on their lives in America. 
Many, though, decided to stay, taking jobs on the docks, the railroads, 
the factories, the refineries, and in the sweatshops and skyscrapers of 
Manhattan. Many manufacturers, whose names read as a "who's who" in American 
industry established a presence, including Colgate, Dixon Ticonderoga, 
Maxwell House, Standard Oil, and Bethlehem Steel. North Hudson, particularly 
Union City became the "embroidery capital of America". Secaucus boasted 
numerous pig farms and rendering plants. It was during this period that 
much of the housing stock, namely one and two family homes and low-rise 
apartment buildings, was built; municipal boundaries finalized, neighborhoods 
established. Commercial corridors such as Bergenline, Central, Newark and 
Ocean Avenues came into prominence. Journal Square became a business, shopping, 
and entertainment mecca, home to The Jersey Journal, after which it is 
named, and movie palaces such as Loew's Jersey Theater and The Stanley. 
Upon entry to World War I, the U.S. government took over control of the 
Hamburg-American Line piers in Hoboken under eminent domain, and Hudson 
became the major point of embarkation for more than three million soldiers, 
known as "doughboys". In 1916, an act of sabotage literally and figuratively 
shook the region when German agents set off bombs at the munitions depot 
in New York Bay at Black Tom. The fore-runner of Port Authority of New 
York and New Jersey was established on April 30, 1921. Huge transportation 
projects opened between the wars: The Holland Tunnel in 1927, The Bayonne 
Bridge in 1931, and The Lincoln Tunnel in 1937, allowing vehicular travel 
between New Jersey and New York City to bypass the waterfront. Hackensack 
River crossings, notably the Pulaski Skyway, were also built. What was 
to become New Jersey City University opened. Major Works Progress Administration 
projects included construction of stadiums in Jersey City and Union City. 
Both were named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who attended the opening 
of the largest project of them all, The Jersey City Medical Center, a massive 
complex built in the Art Deco Style. During this era the "Hudson County 
Democratic Machine", known for its cronyism and corruption, with Jersey 
City mayor Frank Hague at its head was at its most powerful. Industries 
in Hudson were crucial to the war effort during WWII, including the manufacture 
PT boats by Elco in Bayonne. Military Ocean Terminal at Bayonne (MOTBY) 
was opened in 1942 as a U.S. military base and remained in operation until 
1999. After the war maritime and manufacturing industries still dominated 
the local economy, and union membership provided guarantees of good pay 
packages. Though some returning servicemen took advantage of GI housing 
bills and moved to close-by suburbs, many with strong ethnic and familial 
ties chose to stay. Baseball legend Jackie Robinson made his minor league 
debut at Roosevelt Stadium and "broke" the baseball color line. Much of 
Hudson County experienced the phenomenon of ethnic/economic groups leaving 
and being replaced by others, as was typical of most urban communities 
of the New York Bay region. When the big businesses decided to follow them 
or vice versa, Hudson County's socioeconomic differences became more profound. 
Old economic underpinnings disintegrated. Attempts were made to stabilize 
the population by demolishing so-called slums and build subsidized middle-income 
housing and the pockets of so-called "good neighborhoods" came in conflict 
with those that went into decline. Lower property values allowed the next 
wave of immigrants, many from Latin America, to rent or buy in the county. 
North Hudson, particularly Union City, saw many émigrés fleeing the Cuban 
revolution take up residence. Riots occurred in Jersey City in 1964. The 
county since the mid-1990s has seen much real estate speculation and development 
and a population increase, as many new residents purchase existing housing 
stock as well as condominiums in high and mid rise developments, many along 
the waterfront. What had started as a gentrification in the 1980s became 
a full-blown "redevelopment" of the area as many suburbanites, transplanted 
Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities 
in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the "Jersey" 
side of the Hudson their home, and the "real-estate boom" of the era encouraged 
many to seek investment opportunities. The exploitation of certain parts 
of the waterfront and other brownfields led to commercial development as 
well, especially along former rail yards. Hudson felt the short- and long-term 
impact of the destruction of the World Trade Center intensely: its proximity 
to lower Manhattan made it a place to evacuate to, many residents who worked 
there lost their jobs (or their lives), and many companies sought office 
space across the river. Re-zoning, the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and New 
Jersey State land-use policy of transit villages have further spurred construction. 
Though very urban and with some of the highest residential densities in 
the United States the Hudson communities have remain fragmented, due in 
part to New Jersey's long history of home rule in local government; geographical 
factors such as Hudson River inlets/canals, the cliffs of the New Jersey 
Palisades and rail lines; and ethnic/demographic differences in the population. 
As the county sees more development this traditional perception is challenged. 
Hudson County is the most densely populated county in New Jersey and one 
of the most densely populated counties in the United States. The only city 
in Hudson County among the 100 most populous cities in the United States 
was Jersey City which was ranked 75th in the United States Census Bureau's 
rankings based on the 2012 population estimate.[40] Of municipalities with 
over 50,000 people, Union City, New Jersey is the most densely populated 
in the United States, while several Hudson county municipalities are among 
the most densely populated in the United States as well as worldwide.[41] 
North Hudson has the second largest Cuban American population in the United 
States behind Miami.[41]Jersey City is the 21st-most ethnically diverse 
city in the United States and the most ethnically diverse on the East Coast 
of the United States.[42] Hudson has three communities on the list of the 
100 cities (population 5,000 and up) with the highest percent of foreign-born 
residents: West New York (65.2%), Union City (58.7%), and Guttenberg (48.7%)[43] 
Hudson County has the smallest proportion of persons over age 65 in New 
Jersey.[44] Advocates for the homeless counted 2,227 people without homes 
in Hudson County as of January 2008.[45] In 2009, the Hudson County Alliance 
to End Homelessness counted 1,779 homeless people.[46] The same number 
was counted in 2010. Three homeless shelters are located in the county: 
Lucy's Shelter in Jersey City, Palisades Emergency Residence Corp. in Union 
City and the Hoboken Homeless Shelter in Hoboken.[47] At the 2010 United 
States Census, there were 634,266 people, 246,437 households, and 148,355 
families residing in the county. The population density was 13,731.4 per 
square mile (5,301.7/km2). There were 270,335 housing units at an average 
density of 5,852.5 per square mile (2,259.7/km2). The racial makeup of 
the county was 54.05% (342,792) White, 13.23% (83,925) Black or African 
American, 0.64% (4,081) Native American, 13.39% (84,924) Asian, 0.05% (344) 
Pacific Islander, 14.25% (90,373) from other races, and 4.39% (27,827) 
from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 42.23% (267,853) 
of the population.[2] There were 246,437 households, of which 27.6% had 
children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.8% were married couples 
living together, 16.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 
and 39.8% were non-families. 29.9% of all households were made up of individuals, 
and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.54 and the average family size was 3.2.[2] 
In the county, 20.7% of the population were under the age of 18, 10% from 
18 to 24, 36% from 25 to 44, 22.9% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65 
years of age or older. The median age was 34.2 years. For every 100 females 
there were 97.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 
95.9 males.[2] As of the 2000 United States Census, the population was 
608,975. It is part of the New York Metropolitan Area. There were 230,546 
households and 143,630 families residing in the county. The population 
density was 13,044 people per square mile (5,036/km²). It is the sixth-most 
densely populated county in the United States, trailing only four of New 
York City's boroughs (all except Staten Island) and San Francisco County, 
California.[48][49] There were 240,618 housing units at an average density 
of 5,154 per square mile (1,990/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 
55.58% White, 13.48% Black or African American, 0.42% Native American, 
9.35% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 15.48% from other races, and 5.63% 
from two or more races. 39.76% of the population were Hispanic or Latino 
of any race.[7][50] According to Census 2000, 10.0% were of Italian and 
6.7% Irish ancestry, according to Census 2000.[50][51] There were 230,546 
households out of which 29.6% had children under the age of 18 living with 
them, 39.8% were married couples living together, 16.6% had a female householder 
with no husband present, and 37.7% were non-families. 29.5% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 9.6% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average 
family size was 3.27.[7] In the county the population was spread out with 
22.6% under the age of 18, 10.4% from 18 to 24, 35.6% from 25 to 44, 20.0% 
from 45 to 64, and 11.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 34 years. For every 100 females there were 96.50 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.20 males.[7] The median income 
for a household in the county was $40,293, and the median income for a 
family was $44,053. Males had a median income of $36,174 versus $31,037 
for females. The per capita income for the county was $21,154. About 13.3% 
of families and 15.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
22.0% of those under age 18 and 15.7% of those age 65 or over.[50][52] 
Hudson County is a major port of entry for immigration to the United States 
and a major employment center at the approximate core of the New York City 
metropolitan region; and given its proximity to Manhattan, Hudson County 
has evolved a globally cosmopolitan ambience of its own, demonstrating 
a robust and growing demographic and cultural diversity with respect to 
metrics including nationality, religion, race, and domiciliary partnership. 
Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Philippines, and India are the five 
most common nations of birth for foreign-born Hudson County residents.[53] 
Jersey City is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world.[54][55] 
There were an estimated 273,611 Hispanic Americans in Hudson County, according 
to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] representing a 2.1% increase 
from 267,853 Hispanic Americans enumerated in the 2010 United States Census.[57] 
Several municipalities in northern Hudson County are listed among those 
places in the United States with the highest population densities, with 
several towns more dense overall than adjacent New York City. Numerous 
towns on the Hudson Palisades in northern Hudson County have populations 
where more than 50% of the residents are foreign-born, often with a Hispanic 
majority.[58] There were an estimated 58,197 Puerto Rican Americans in 
Hudson County, according to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] representing 
a 3.1% increase from 56,436 Puerto Rican Americans enumerated in the 2010 
United States Census.[57] There were an estimated 28,900 Cuban Americans 
in Hudson County, according to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] 
representing a 0.9% increase from 28,652 Cuban Americans enumerated in 
the 2010 United States Census.[57] The Cuban Day Parade of New Jersey, 
since its inception at the millennium, has run along Bergenline Avenue 
and grown to be the centerpiece of large festivities which have taken place 
at Scheutzen Park or Celia Cruz Park.[59][60] There were an estimated 194,192 
non-Hispanic whites in Hudson County, according to the 2013 American Community 
Survey,[56] representing a 0.7% decrease from 195,501 non-Hispanic whites 
enumerated in the 2010 United States Census.[57] Italian Americans have 
historically played an important cultural role in Hudson County. Ever since 
the settling of New Netherland in the 1600s, comprising what is now the 
Gateway Region of northeastern New Jersey as well as portions of Downstate 
New York in the New York City metropolitan area, the Dutch and British, 
along with German and Irish Americans, have established an integral role 
in the subsequent long-term development of Hudson County over the centuries. 
Irish Americans, specifically Irish Catholics played a significant role 
in the politics of Jersey City. Many of the city's mayors were of Irish 
descent. The Greenville, Jersey City neighborhood was the center of the 
city's Irish community until the 1950s and early 1960s.[citation needed] 
There were an estimated 89,164 Asian Americans in Hudson County, according 
to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] representing a 5.0% increase 
from 84,924 Asian Americans enumerated in the 2010 United States Census.[57] 
India Square, also known as "Little India" or "Little Bombay",[61] home 
to the highest concentration of Asian Indians in the Western Hemisphere,[62] 
is a rapidly growing Indian American ethnic enclave in Jersey City. This 
area has been home to the largest outdoor Navratri festivities in New Jersey 
as well as several Hindu temples;[63] while an annual, color-filled spring 
Holi festival has taken place in Jersey City since 1992, centered upon 
India Square and attracting significant participation and international 
media attention.[64][65] There were an estimated 39,477 Indian Americans 
in Hudson County, according to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] 
representing a 6.0% increase from 37,236 Indian Americans enumerated in 
the 2010 United States Census.[57] Seven per cent (7%) of Jersey City's 
population is Filipino.[66] The Five Corners district is home to a thriving 
Filipino community and Jersey City's Little Manila, which is the second 
largest Asian American subgroup in the city. A variety of Filipino restaurants, 
shippers and freighters, doctors' officers, bakeries, stores, and an office 
of The Filipino Channel have made Newark Avenue their home. The largest 
Filipino-owned grocery store on the East Coast of the United States, Phil-Am 
Food, has been there since 1973. An array of Filipino-owned businesses 
can also be found at the section of West Side of Jersey City, where many 
of its residents are of Filipino descent. In 2006, a Red Ribbon pastry 
shop, one of the Philippines' most famous food chains, opened its first 
branch on the East Coast in the Garden State.[1] Manila Avenue in Downtown 
Jersey City was named for the Philippine capital city because of the many 
Filipinos who built their homes on this street during the 1970s. A memorial, 
dedicated to the Filipino American veterans of the Vietnam War, was built 
in a small square on Manila Avenue. A park and statue dedicated to Jose 
P. Rizal, a national hero of the Philippines, exists in downtown Jersey 
City.[67] Jersey City is the host of the annual Philippine-American Friendship 
Day Parade, an event that occurs yearly in June, on its last Sunday. The 
City Hall of Jersey City raises the Philippine flag in correlation to this 
event and as a tribute to the contributions of the Filipino community. 
The Santakrusan Procession along Manila Avenue has taken place since 1977.[68] 
There were an estimated 21,622 Filipino Americans in Hudson County, according 
to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] representing a 4.8% increase 
from 20,638 Filipino Americans enumerated in the 2010 United States Census.[57] 
Hudson County, highly accessible to Lower Manhattan in New York City and 
its Chinatown by rapid transit, was home to an estimated 13,381 Chinese 
Americans, according to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] representing 
a notably rapid growth of 19.1% from the 11,239 Chinese Americans enumerated 
in the 2010 United States Census.[57] There were an estimated 83,576 African 
Americans in Hudson County, according to the 2013 American Community Survey,[56] 
representing a 0.4% decrease from 83,925 African Americans enumerated in 
the 2010 United States Census.[57] However, modest growth in the African 
immigrant population, most notably the growing Nigerian American population 
in Jersey City, is partially offsetting the decline in Hudson County's 
American-born black population, which as a whole has been experiencing 
an exodus from northern New Jersey to the Southern United States.[69] Arab 
Americans numbered an estimated 14,518 individuals in Hudson County as 
per the 2012 American Community Survey, representing 2.3% of the county's 
total population,[70] the second highest percentage in New Jersey after 
Passaic County.[71] Arab Americans are most concentrated in Jersey City 
and Bayonne, led by Egyptian Americans, including the largest population 
of Coptic Christians in the United States.[54][55] Hudson County's growing 
Muslim American population includes a significant Latino contingent comprising 
adherents converting from other religious affiliations.[72] A growing Jewish 
American population has been noted in Hudson County, particularly in Jersey 
City. A significant Jewish presence has also been established in Bayonne.[73] 
There were 2,726 same-sex couples in Hudson County in 2010, second in New 
Jersey only to Essex County,[74] prior to the commencement of same-sex 
marriages in New Jersey on October 21, 2013.[75] The County Executive is 
elected by a direct vote of the electorate. The executive, together with 
the Board of chosen freeholders in a legislative role, administer all county 
business. Nine members are elected concurrently to serve three-year terms 
as Freeholder, each representing a specified district which are equally 
proportioned based on population. Each year, in January, the Freeholders 
select one of their nine to serve as Chair and one as Vice Chair for a 
period of one year. As of 2014[update], Hudson County's County Executive 
is Thomas A. DeGise, whose term of office expires December 31, 2015.[76] 
Hudson County's Freeholders (all serving concurrent terms that end on December 
31, 2014) are:[77][78] Hudson County's Clerk is Barbara A. Netchert,[97] 
the Sheriff Frank Schillari[98] and the Surrogate is Donald W. De Leo.[99] 
The county seat of Hudson County is located near Five Corners on Newark 
Avenue in Jersey City, northeast of Journal Square. The Hudson County Courthouse, 
and the adjacent Hudson County Administration Building, at 595 Newark Avenue, 
are home to various courts, agencies and departments. Hudson County constitutes 
Vicinage 6 of the New Jersey Superior Court.[100] Vicinage 6 is seated 
at the Administration Building, with additional facilities at the Hudson 
County Courthouse; the Assignment Judge for Vicinage 6 is the Honorable 
Peter F. Bariso Jr.[101][102] The Hudson County court system consists of 
several municipal courts, including the busy Jersey City Court in addition 
to the Superior Court. Many county offices and Hudson County Sheriff's 
patrol headquarters are located at Hudson County Plaza at 257 Cornelison 
Avenue in Jersey City.[103][104][105] The Hudson County Correctional Facility 
is located in South Kearny. The Hudson County Meadowview Psychiatric Hospital 
is on County Avenue, Secaucus. Three federal Congressional Districts cover 
the county, including portions of the 8th, 9th and 10th districts.[106][107] 
New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District is represented by Albio Sires 
(D, West New York).[108] New Jersey's Ninth Congressional District is represented 
by Bill Pascrell (D, Paterson).[109] New Jersey's Tenth Congressional District 
is represented by Donald Payne Jr. (D, Newark).[110] The county is part 
of the 31st, 32nd and 33rd Districts in the New Jersey Legislature.[111] 
At 6.4 square miles (17 km2), the 33rd Legislative District has the smallest 
land area for a Legislative District.[44] Hudson County is politically 
Democratic overall. According to The Hudson Reporter, the most conservative 
town in the county is Secaucus.[112] Colleges and universities are Hudson

in Hoboken. The University of Phoenix and Rutgers University offer classes 
within the county. The Christ Hospital School of Nursing was established 
in 1890 and since 1999 has run a cooperative program with HCCC.[119] In 
2014 it will merge with the Bayonne Medical Center nursing school.[120] 
Each municipality has a public school district. All but two have their 
own public high schools. East Newark students attend Harrison High School[121] 
and Guttenberg students attend North Bergen High School.[122] Hudson County 
Schools of Technology is a public secondary and adult vocational-technical 
school with locations in North Bergen, Jersey City, Union City and Harrison.[123] 
There are private and parochial elementary and secondary schools located 
throughout Hudson, many of which are members of the Hudson County Interscholastic 
Athletic Association.[124] The confluence of roads and railways of the 
Northeastern U.S. megalopolis and Northeast Corridor passing through Hudson 
County make it one of the Northeast's major transportation crossroads and 
provide access to an extensive network of interstate highways, state freeways 
and toll roads, and vehicular water crossings. Many long distance trains 
and buses pass through the county, though Amtrak and the major national 
bus companies – Greyhound Lines and Trailways – do not provide service 
within it. There are many local, intrastate, and Manhattan-bound bus routes, 
an expanding light rail system, ferries traversing the Hudson, and commuter 
trains to North Jersey, the Jersey Shore, and Trenton. Much of the rail, 
surface transit, and ferry system is oriented to commuters traveling to 
Newark, lower and midtown Manhattan, and the Hudson Waterfront. Public 
transportation is operated by a variety of public and private corporations, 
notably New Jersey Transit, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 
and NY Waterway, each of which charge customers separately for their service. 
Hudson is the only county in New Jersey where more residents (127,708) 
used public transportation than who drove (124,772).[125] Hoboken Terminal, 
Bergenline Avenue at 32nd Street, 48th Street, and Nungessers in North 
Hudson, and Journal Square Transportation Center and Exchange Place in 
Jersey City are major public transportation hubs. The Port Authority Bus 
Terminal and Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, the World Trade Center 
in Lower Manhattan, and Newark Penn Station also play important roles within 
the county's transportation network. Secaucus Junction provides access 
to eight commuter rail lines.[126] New Jersey Transit bus routes 120 -129 
provide service within Hudson and to Manhattan. New Jersey Transit bus 
routes 1-89 provide service within the county and to points in North Jersey. 
Additionally, private bus companies, some of which operate dollar vans 
(mini-buses or carritos) augment the state agency's surface transport. 
Located at the heart of the Port of New York and New Jersey, Hudson has 
since the 1980s seen the restoration of it once extensive ferry system. 
As of 2010[update], the county had a total of 616.81 miles (992.66 km) 
of roadways, of which 515.38 miles (829.42 km) are maintained by the local 
municipality, 47.31 miles (76.14 km) by Hudson County, 33.23 miles (53.48 km) 
by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 20.89 miles (33.62 km) 
by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.[133] Major highways include New Jersey 
Routes 3, 7, 139, 185, 440, 495, Interstates 78, 95, and 280, and U.S. 
Routes 1 and 9, as well as the New Jersey Turnpike and the Pulaski Skyway.

(via Weehawken to midtown Manhattan) and the Holland Tunnel (via Jersey 
City to lower Manhattan), and over the Bayonne Bridge to Staten Island. 
County Route 501 runs the length of Hudson as Kennedy Boulevard. In 2013, 
two main thoroughfares in Hudson County, Kennedy Boulevard and U.S. Route 
1/9, were included among the Tri-State Transportation Campaign's list of 
the top ten most dangerous roads for pedestrians in New Jersey, New York 
and Connecticut. Kennedy Boulevard was ranked #6 for the six pedestrian 
fatalities that occurred on it from 2009 to 2011, while Route 1/9 was tied 
for the #10 place on the list for the five pedestrian deaths during the 
same period. Route 1/9 is monitored by state police, while Kennedy Boulevard 
is patrolled by the respective municipalities through which that road runs. 
In total, 37 pedestrians – 12 in 2009, 14 in 2010 and 11 in 2011 – were 
killed on Hudson County roads. According to state police statistics there 
were nine pedestrian fatalities in the county in 2012, which was not included 
in the study. From 2010 through 2012, 25 people were killed each year in 
Hudson County motor vehicle accidents.[134] Most airports which serve Hudson 
County are operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Hudson 
has many county parks, including Hudson County Park, Mercer Park, Lincoln 
Park, Washington Park, Columbus Park, and North Hudson Park, West Hudson 
Park and the newest, Laurel Hill.[135] There are many municipal parks and 
plazas, some of which were developed as "city squares" during the 19th 
century, such as Hamilton Park, Church Square Park and Ellsworth (locally 
known as Pigeon) Park. The German-American Volksfest has taken place annually 
since 1874 at Schuetzen Park[136] This private park and the many nearby 
cemeteries-Flower Hill Cemetery, Grove Church Cemetery, Hoboken Cemetery, 
Macphelah Cemetery and Weehawken Cemetery that characterize the western 
slope create the "green lung" of North Hudson County. Jersey City Reservoir 
No.3 and Pershing Field constitute one of the largest "green spaces" in 
the county. The reservoir, no longer in use, is site of a passive recreation 
area/nature preserve. Hackensack Number Two, the other remaining reservoir 
in Weehawken Heights, is not accessible to the public. Extensive athletic 
fields opened in 2009 in Weehawken and Union City, the latter on the site 
of the former Roosevelt Stadium. Promenades are being developed along the 
rivers. The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway and Hackensack RiverWalk. Sections 
of the Secaucus Greenway are in place and eventually will connect different 
districts of the town including the North End, site Schmidts Woods (which 
contains an original hard wood forest) and Mill Creek Point Park, and Harmon 
Meadow Plaza. Kearny Riverbank Park runs along the Passaic River. The future 
of the Harsimus Stem Embankment is uncertain, though many community groups 
hope the landmark will be opened to the public as elevated greenway, possibly 
as part of East Coast Greenway. Liberty State Park, the county's largest, 
is sited on land that had once been part of a vast oyster bed, was filled 
in for industrial, rail, and maritime uses, and was reclaimed in the 1970s. 
Ellis Island and Liberty Island, a national protected area and home to 
the Statue of Liberty National Monument, lie entirely within Hudson's waters 
across from Liberty State Park, from which ferry service is available.[137] 
The New Jersey Meadowlands Commission has designated several areas within 
its jurisdiction as wetlands preservation zones including the Riverbend 
Wetlands Preserve, Eastern Brackish Marsh, and Kearny Marsh, an extension 
of De Korte Park, home of the Meadowlands Environment Center.[138] Hudson 
County is home to the Bayonne Golf Club and Liberty National Golf Club, 
both located on Upper New York Bay.[139] Various businesses and industries 
are headquartered or had their start in Hudson County. Secaucus is home 
to My Network TV's flagship station WWOR-TV,[140] Red Bull New York,[141] 
MLB Network,[142] NBA Entertainment,[143][144][145] Goya Foods,[146] The 
Children's Place[147] and Hartz Mountain.[148] Jersey City is home to Verisk 
Analytics[149] and WFMU 91.1FM (WMFU 90.1FM in the Hudson Valley), the 
longest running freeform radio station in the United States.[150] Hoboken 
is the birthplace of the first Blimpie restaurant,[151] and home to one 
of the headquarters of publisher John Wiley & Sons.[152] In the 20th century, 
Union City was the "embroidery capital of the United States", the trademark 
of that industry appearing on that city's seal.[153][154][155] North Bergen 
is home to The Vitamin Shoppe's headquarters.[156] Weehawken is home to 
the headquarters of NY Waterway,[157] as well as offices for Swatch Group 
USA,[158] UBS[159] and Hartz Mountain.[160] Television producers had long 
held an attraction for New Jersey, and Hudson County in particular, due 
to the tax credits afforded such various productions. The HBO prison drama 
Oz was filmed in an old warehouse in Bayonne, with much of the series filmed 
around the now-defunct Military Ocean Terminal Base.[161] The NBC drama 
Law and Order: Special Victims Unit filmed police station and courtroom 
scenes at NBC's Central Archives building in North Bergen,[162][163] and 
filmed other scenes throughout the county, such as a 2010 episode filmed 
at the Meadowlands Parkway in Secaucus.[161] The short-lived hospital drama 
Mercy filmed at a warehouse in Secaucus, a private residence in Weehawken 
and a public school in Jersey City.[164] The Law and Order and Mercy productions 
left New Jersey for New York in 2010 after New Jersey Governor Chris Christie 
suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal 
Year 2011 to close budget gaps.[161] There are several museums and other 
exhibitions spaces throughout the county, some of which maintain permanent 
collections. Other are focused on local culture, history, or the environment.

or ethnic culture are highlighted. There are also private galleries. The 
venues include: Average temperatures in the county seat of Jersey City 
have ranged from a low of 27 °F (−3 °C) in January to a high of 84 °F (29 °C)

1934 and a record high of 106 °F (41 °C) was recorded in July 1936. Average 
monthly precipitation ranged from 3.21 inches (82 mm) in February to 4.60
