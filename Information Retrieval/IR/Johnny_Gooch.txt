John Beverley Gooch (November 9, 1897 – March 15, 1975) was an American 
professional baseball player, coach, minor league manager and scout.[1] 
He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1921 to 1933, most 
notably for the Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] Born in Smyrna, Tennessee, Gooch 
began his professional baseball career in 1916 at the age of 18 with the 
Talladega Tigers of the Georgia–Alabama League.[2][3] He didn't play professionally 
in 1917 or 1918 as he returned to help on the family farm after his oldest 
brother had died in a drowning accident and his second oldest brother had 
been called into military service during World War I.[2] Gooch was also 
called into military service and was aboard a train heading to the service 
when news of the Armistice broke.[2] In 1918, Gooch tried out to play for 
the New Orleans Pelicans but didn't make the team.[2] Despite this setback, 
the eager Gooch continued to show up for the team's practices.[2] His eagerness 
to play finally convinced the Pelicans to sign him to a contract.[2] He 
was sent to play in Cleveland and then to Mobile, where he was released.[2] 
The Birmingham Barons then signed him after The Barons’ manager, Carlton 
Molesworth, remembered his dedication during one of his team's visits to 
play in Mobile.[2] It was in Birmingham where Gooch first played with future 
Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Pie Traynor, and the two men developed 
a lifelong friendship.[2] In 1920, he posted a .288 batting average in 
136 games for the Barons.[3] Gooch made his major league debut with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates on September 9, 1921 at the age of 22.[1] Gooch had 
his best season offensively in 1922 when veteran catcher Walter Schmidt, 
held out for more pay and didn't play until August.[2] He posted a career-high 
.329 batting average in 105 games, and collected an extra-inning six-hit 
game, two four-hit games, and eight three-hit games.[1] He also had 102 
assists defensively, third best in the league.[4] In 1925, he played as 
a backup catcher to Earl Smith while posting a .298 batting average along 
with 30 runs batted in to help the Pirates win the National League pennant.[1] 
The Pirates then went on to defeat the Washington Senators in the 1925 
World Series.[5] He appeared in three games of series and went hitless 
in 3 at bats.[6] Gooch played in 101 games in 1927 and had a career-high 
48 runs batted in, as the Pirates once again won the National League championship.[1] 
However, they faced the powerful New York Yankees led by Babe Ruth and 
Lou Gehrig in the 1927 World Series and were defeated in four straight 
games.[7] In 1928, the Pirates acquired future Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, 
Burleigh Grimes, who was the last pitcher allowed to throw the spitball 
in the major leagues.[8] Pirates manager, Donie Bush chose Gooch to be 
Grimes' personal catcher, due to his previous experience at catching the 
tricky spitball.[8] After spending six and a half years with the Pirates, 
Gooch was traded in June 1928 along with Joe Harris to the Brooklyn Robins 
in exchange for Charlie Hargreaves, as the Pirates were seeking a right-handed 
batter.[9] It was also reported that he had fallen out of favor with the 
Pirates because of a salary dispute during the off-season.[9] News reports 
surfaced in January 1929 that Gooch wasn't happy in Brooklyn after having 
spent so many years in Pittsburgh, and was contemplating retirement.[10] 
That April, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Val Picinich.[1] He 
experienced a rejuvenation by hitting for a .300 batting average in 92 
games for the seventh-place Reds.[1] After one more season with the Reds 
where his batting average dropped to .243, he was traded to the Nashville 
Volunteers in the Southern Association for Joe Cicero.[1] He posted a .334 
batting average in 117 games during the Volunteers' 1932 season.[1] In 
January 1933, he returned to the major leagues when his contract was bought 
by the Boston Red Sox.[11] Gooch's playing time was diminished when the 
Red Sox acquired catcher Rick Ferrell in May.[2] He appeared in 37 games 
for the Red Sox and played in his final major league game on September 
12, 1933 at the age of 37.[1] In an eleven-year major league career, Gooch 
played in 805 games, accumulating 662 hits in 2,363 at-bats for a .280 
career batting average along with 7 home runs, 293 runs batted in and an 
on-base percentage of .342.[1] He had a career fielding percentage of .973.[1] 
Gooch was hired by the Cincinnati Reds to be a player-manager for the Durham 
Bulls of the Piedmont League in December 1935.[12] He was credited with 
helping young pitcher Johnny Vander Meer cure the wildness of his pitching.[13] 
Vander Meer went on to become the only pitcher in Major League Baseball 
history to pitch two consecutive no hitters.[13] Gooch was then hired as 
the manager for the Mount Airy Reds of the Bi-State League.[14] In January 
1937, the Pirates hired Gooch to be their pitching coach, at the urging 
of his old friend, Pie Traynor, who was then managing the Pirates.[15] 
In October 1939, the Pirates released him as a coach, then immediately 
rehired him as a scout.[16] The Pirates then named him to be the manager 
for their minor league affiliate, the Hutchinson Pirates of the Western 
Association for the 1941 season.[17] His final year in baseball was 1942, 
as a player-manager for the Bluefield Blue-Grays in the Mountain State 
League.[2] After retiring from baseball management, Gooch opened a baseball 
bat factory in Nashville.[2] In 1972, Gooch was inducted into the Tennessee 
Sports Hall of Fame.[18] Gooch died on May 15, 1975 in Nashville, Tennessee,
