Andrew Scott "Drew" Hutchison (born August 22, 1990) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He was considered one of the Toronto Blue Jays top prospects before the 
start of the 2012 Major League Baseball season.[1] Hutchison was drafted 
by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 15th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball 
Draft from Lakeland High School in Lakeland, Florida.[2] He made his minor 
league baseball debut with the Auburn Doubledays in 2010, and was later 
promoted to the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts. In 68 2⁄3 innings that year, Hutchison 
pitched to a 2–3 record with a 2.49 ERA and 63 strikeouts.[3] He began 
the 2011 season with Lansing, and later made starts with the High-A Dunedin 
Blue Jays and the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. In 2011 Hutchison 
posted a record of 14–5 with an ERA of 2.53 and 171 strikeouts over 149 
1⁄3 innings.[3] Before the 2012 season, Baseball America ranked Hutchison 
as the Blue Jays' ninth best prospect.[4] He made 3 starts with New Hampshire 
in 2012, and posted a 2–1 record with a 2.16 ERA.[3] The Blue Jays purchased 
Hutchison's contract from the Fisher Cats on April 19, 2012.[5] He made 
his first MLB start on April 21, 2012 against the Kansas City Royals in 
Kansas City, pitching 5 1⁄3 innings and yielding 5 earned runs, with 4 
strikeouts and 3 walks in a 9–5 win. After making 11 starts, Hutchison 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right ulnar collateral ligament 
sprain.[6] Hutchison was later transferred to the 60-day disabled list, 
and on August 7 it was announced that he would require Tommy John surgery 
to repair his injured elbow. Hutchison posted a 5–3 record with a 4.60 
ERA and 49 strikeouts over 11 starts (58 2⁄3 innings) in his first professional 
season.[7][8] The Blue Jays placed Hutchison on the 60-day disabled list 
on March 22, 2013 to make room for Todd Redmond on their 40-man roster.[9] 
On May 7, 2013, it was reported that Hutchison was on track to return in 
early August, one year since undergoing surgery.[10] The Blue Jays announced 
on August 8 that Hutchison would start for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons 
on August 9 as part of his rehab assignment.[11] He was activated from 
the disabled list on August 10, and optioned to Buffalo. Hutchison did 
not appear for the Blue Jays in 2013, and posted a 0–4 record and 4.84 
ERA in 10 minor league appearances that year.[3] Fully healthy, Hutchison 
entered 2014 Spring Training and earned a spot in the starting rotation. 
He recorded his first 2 hits in an interleague game against the Philadelphia 
Phillies on May 6, 2014.[12] In a game against the Texas Rangers on May 
16, Hutchison pitched his first career complete game shutout, giving up 
just 3 hits and 1 walk with 6 strikeouts.[13] He established a then career-high 
in strikeouts, with 10, in a 4–1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on July 
1, 2014.[14] Hutchison experienced inconsistency in his performance from 
June 13 to early August, posting a 6.64 ERA over 8 starts in that time 
span. On August 6, he pitched 8 2⁄3 innings and took the win against the 
Baltimore Orioles 5–1, yielding only 1 hit (a solo home run by Chris Davis). 
In doing so, he joined Dave Stieb and Roy Halladay as the only Toronto 
pitchers to retire 26 of 27 batters faced in a start.[15] Hutchison struck 
out a career-high 11 in a game on September 16 against the Baltimore Orioles.[16] 
He would record the win in his final start of the season on September 26, 
finishing the 2014 campaign with an 11–13 record, 4.48 ERA, and a 1.26 
WHIP over 184 2⁄3 innings pitched.[8] Hutchison finished 8th in the American 
League in both strikeouts and K/9, with 184 and 8.97 respectively.[17] 
On March 31, 2015, Hutchison was named the Opening Day starter for the 
Blue Jays, and became the youngest Opening Day starter in franchise history.[18][19] 
After taking the win on Opening Day, Hutchison struggled in his next two 
starts. On April 23, took a perfect game into the 6th inning against the 
Baltimore Orioles. He finished the day with 8 innings pitched, and yielded 
2 runs on 4 hits, while striking out 8, as the Blue Jays won 7–6.[20] On 
May 25, Hutchison pitched his second career complete game shutout, defeating 
the Chicago White Sox 6–0. He needed only 96 pitches to complete the game, 
yielding 4 hits and striking out 8.[21] He would struggle with his command 
from that point onward, posting an ERA above 5 into August. After earning 
his 12th win of the season on August 16, Hutchison was optioned to Triple-A 
Buffalo, as the Blue Jays did not need a fifth starter until August 29.[22] 
Hutchinson received the most run support in the American league leading 
him to record 12 wins in 28 starts despite posting an ERA of 5.57. On January 
16, 2016, Hutchison and the Blue Jays avoided salary arbitration by agreeing 
to a one-year, $2.2 million contract.[23] Hutchison entered spring training 
in competition for the fifth starter role with Aaron Sanchez, Gavin Floyd, 
and Jesse Chavez. On March 28, it was announced that Sanchez would be the 
team's fifth starter, and that Hutchison would be optioned to the Triple-A 
Buffalo Bisons.[24] Bisons manager Gary Allenson announced on April 5 that 
Hutchison would start on Opening Day against the Pawtucket Red Sox.[25] 
Hutchison was recalled by the Blue Jays on April 23 for a spot start against 
the Oakland Athletics the next day.[26] He was optioned back to Buffalo 
after the game. On July 2, Hutchison was recalled from Triple-A.[27] He 
would make two more appearances for Toronto; the latter one a start against 
the Detroit Tigers in place of Marco Estrada, who was unable to play due 
to lower back pain.[28] He was returned to Buffalo the following day. On 
August 1, the Blue Jays traded Hutchison to the Pittsburgh Pirates for 
Francisco Liriano, Reese McGuire, and Harold Ramirez.[29] Hutchison was 
assigned to the Pirates' Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians.
