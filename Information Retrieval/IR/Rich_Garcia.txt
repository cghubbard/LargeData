Richard Raul Garcia (born May 22, 1942) is a former umpire in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) who worked in the American League (AL) from 1975 to 1999. 
Garcia wore uniform number 19 when the AL adopted numbers for its umpires 
in 1980. After graduating from his hometown's Key West High School in 1960, 
Garcia served in the United States Marine Corps as a combat engineer until 
1964. Stationed in Okinawa and North Carolina during his tour of duty, 
he also played on the Marine Corps baseball team for three years.[1] He 
completed his training from MLB's Umpire Specialization Course in 1970.[1][2] 
He progressed up the minor leagues, starting with the Florida State League 
in 1970 and 1971, followed by the Southern League in 1972 and the International 
League in 1973 and 1974. During those five years he worked during the offseason 
in the Florida Instructional League (1970–1971, 1973–1974) and the Dominican 
Winter Baseball League (1972–1973).[1] Garcia was hired by the American 
League in 1975, working at third base in his major league debut in the 
Minnesota Twins' season-opening 11–4 victory over the Texas Rangers at 
Arlington Stadium on April 8.[3] His first assignment behind the plate 
was the Rangers' 7–5 loss to the defending World Series Champion Oakland 
Athletics in the same ballpark three nights later on April 11.[4] Garcia 
was promoted to AL crew chief in 1985. Garcia worked two All-Star Games 
(1980, 1992), three American League Division Series (1995, 1997, 1998), 
five American League Championship Series (1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1996) 
and four World Series (1981, 1984, 1989, 1998). He was crew chief for the 
1989 and 1998 World Series, as well as the 1990 ALCS. Garcia is one of 
seven major leagues umpires who have officiated in two perfect games. He 
was behind the plate when Len Barker did it in the Cleveland Indians' 3–0 
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on May 15, 1981.[5] Garcia was umpiring 
at second base for the one David Wells pitched in the New York Yankees' 
4–0 win over the Minnesota Twins on May 17, 1998.[6] In 1996, Garcia made 
a controversial call during Game 1 of the American League Championship 
Series between the Baltimore Orioles and the Yankees; he was umpiring in 
right field. In the 8th inning, the Yankees tied the game 4-4 when Derek 
Jeter hit a fly ball to right field that 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier 
pulled into the stands after reaching over the right field wall. Garcia 
ruled it a home run, but after seeing a replay admitted that he had made 
a mistake after the game; the Yankees won the game in 11 innings and would 
go on to win the series.[7][8] Another call by Garcia that was questioned 
by some media members came in Game 1 of the 1998 World Series.[9][10] Padres 
pitcher Mark Langston appeared to have struck out Tino Martinez on a 2–2 
pitch with the bases loaded and two outs in the 7th inning with the game 
tied at 5-5. Garcia, however, called the pitch a ball, and Martinez hit 
Langston's next pitch for a grand slam.[9] Garcia took part in the 1999 
Major League Umpires Association mass resignation which was engineered 
by Richie Phillips, the union's executive director. When the strategy backfired, 
Garcia lost his job because his resignation was one of the 22 accepted 
by Major League Baseball. After working as a consultant for the baseball 
commissioner's office, he was hired as a MLB umpire supervisor in 2002.[11] 
On March 8 of that year, the New York Daily News disclosed that in 1989 
he and National League umpire Frank Pulli had associated with Florida-based 
bookmakers who were known drug dealers. Three days later, the Boston Herald 
reported that, according to information collected from federal wiretaps, 
both umpires had problems paying off their gambling debts. The punishment 
MLB had applied to Garcia and Pulli at the time was only two years' probation.[12] 
Garcia, along with fellow supervisors Marty Springstead and Jim McKean, 
were ousted on March 6, 2010 as a result of a 2009 postseason which was 
plagued by various high-profile questionable calls that drew a firestorm 
of criticism from fans and the media.[13] Garcia has instructed at various 
umpire schools for several years and also conducted umpiring clinics during 
the offseason while serving as an active major league umpire. Garcia played 
the first base umpire in the 1999 movie For Love of the Game, starring 
Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston. Garcia currently resides in Clearwater. 
He and his wife Sheryl have four children and ten grandchildren. He is
