Harold Douglas Baines (born March 15, 1959) is a former designated hitter 
and right fielder in Major League Baseball who played for five American 
League teams from 1980 to 2001. He is best known for his three stints with 
the Chicago White Sox, a team he coached with until 2015, before moving 
into a role of team ambassador and spring training instructor.[1] He ranked 
7th in AL history in games played (2,830) and 10th in runs batted in (1,628) 
upon his retirement. Noted as well for his power hitting in clutch situations, 
he is tied for 7th in AL history in grand slams (13),[2] 4th in three home 
run games (3),[3] and tied for 7th in major league history in walk-off 
home runs (10).[2] Baines batted over .300 eight times and hit .324 in 
31 career postseason games, topping the .350 mark in five separate series. 
A six-time All-Star, he led the AL in slugging average in 1984. He held 
the White Sox team record for career home runs from 1987 until Carlton 
Fisk passed him in 1990; his eventual total of 221 remains the club record 
for left-handed hitters, as do his 981 RBI and 585 extra base hits with 
the team. His 1,652 games as a designated hitter are a major league record, 
and he held the mark for career home runs as a DH (236) until Edgar Martínez 
passed him in 2004. He also led the Major Leagues in hits as a DH (1,688) 
until the mark was surpassed by David Ortiz on July 10, 2013. Baines graduated 
in 1977 from St. Michaels High School on Maryland's Eastern Shore where, 
as a senior, he batted .532 and was named a high school All-American.[4] 
A month later, the White Sox made Baines the first overall selection in 
the amateur draft. The owner of the White Sox at the time, Bill Veeck, 
had spotted Baines playing Little League ball years before at the age of 
12. In 1980, Baines became a regular outfielder on the White Sox, and he 
began to produce in 1982 when he had 165 hits, 25 home runs and 105 RBI. 
In 1984, baseball writer Bill James called Baines his favorite opposing 
player to watch, saying, "He is gorgeous, absolutely complete. I've seen 
him drop down bunts that would melt in your mouth, come up the next time 
and execute a hit and run that comes straight off the chalkboard. I've 
seen him hit fastballs out of the yard on a line, and I've seen him get 
under a high curve and loft it just over the fence."[5] Baines ended the 
longest game in major league history (eight hours and six minutes over 
25 innings on successive evenings) with a walk-off home run against the 
Milwaukee Brewers' Chuck Porter on May 8, 1984; the bat he used is currently 
kept at the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1986, a succession of knee problems 
began which gradually ended his fielding career, forcing him to become 
a regular designated hitter. Despite the knee ailments and the resulting 
lack of speed, he remained a powerful hitter, picking up 166 hits in 1988. 
Baines holds the record for the most seasons by a player between 100 runs 
batted in, with 14 seasons between 113 RBI for Chicago in 1985 and 103 
for Baltimore and Cleveland in 1999.[6] Midway through the 1989 season, 
the Texas Rangers acquired Baines, along with Fred Manrique, from the White 
Sox in a much-derided trade which sent Wilson Álvarez, Scott Fletcher and 
Sammy Sosa to Chicago. After the trade, the White Sox retired Baines' #3 
on August 20, 1989, a rare occurrence for a player who was still active 
in the major leagues (the number would be "un-retired" each time Baines 
returned to the White Sox, and he wore it as a coach). In 1990 Baines was 
traded to the Oakland Athletics for minor league pitchers Scott Chiamparino 
and Joe Bitker, and he helped them reach the postseason only to be swept 
by the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. In 1992 the Athletics returned 
to the playoffs, only to lose to the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS.[7] 
Prior to the 1993 season, Baines was traded by the A's to the Baltimore 
Orioles for minor league pitchers Bobby Chouinard and Allen Plaster. Baines 
batted .313, .294 and .299 over his three seasons with Baltimore. He returned 
to the White Sox as a free agent in 1996 but was traded back to Baltimore 
midway through the 1997 season; he helped the Orioles reach the playoffs, 
losing to the Cleveland Indians in the League Championship Series. His 
final contract with the White Sox was not renewed following the 2001 season, 
after his third stint with the team. He finished his career with 2,866 
hits, 384 home runs and 1,628 RBIs. His career RBI total is 30th all-time; 
his hit total ranks 41st all-time. Baines' fourth stint with the Chicago 
White Sox began when he was named bench coach in March 2004 under new manager 
Ozzie Guillén, his White Sox teammate, from 1985 to 1989 and in 1996–97. 
In 2005, as a coach for the White Sox, he earned a World Series ring when 
the White Sox won the 2005 World Series. On July 20, 2008, the White Sox 
unveiled a bronze statue of Baines at U.S. Cellular Field prior to their 
game against the Kansas City Royals; it is the seventh statue featured 
on the park's outfield concourse.[8][9] In August 2009 the Orioles announced 
that Baines would be inducted into the Orioles Hall of Fame as the 46th 
member. In his seven seasons with the Orioles he batted .301, had 107 home 
runs, and 378 RBIs as their designated hitter. Baines' hometown of St. 
Michaels has designated January 9 as Harold Baines Day. He has also created 
the Harold Baines Scholarship Fund to help deserving college-bound students.[10] 
Baines is married to Marla Henry and has four children: Toni, Britni, Harold, 
Jr., and Courtney. Harold, Jr. went to McDaniel College which is NCAA Division 
III in athletics and formerly known as Western Maryland College, located 
in Westminster, Maryland. All attended Baines' alma mater, St. Michaels 
Middle/High School.[11] Baines had been eligible for the National Baseball 
Hall of Fame beginning with the 2007 election. While 75% of the vote is 
needed for induction, he never received greater than 6.1% (which he received 
in 2010).[12] On January 5, 2011, Baines received just 28 votes (4.8%) 
in the 2011 Hall of Fame election, dropping him off all future Hall of
