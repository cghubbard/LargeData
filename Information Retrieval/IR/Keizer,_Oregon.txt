Keizer /ˈkaɪzər/ is a city located in Marion County, Oregon, United States, 
along the 45th parallel. As of the 2010 United States Census, its population 
was 36,478. It lies inside of the Willamette Valley and is part of the 
Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named after brothers Thomas 
Dove (T. D.) and John Brooks (J. B.) Keizur, two pioneers who arrived in 
the Wagon Train of 1843, and later filed donation land claims. The original 
settlement was at Keizer Bottom, near the banks of the Willamette River. 
The community was named after Thomas Dove Keizur, one of its first settlers. 
Somewhere in the translation of donation land claim records, his name was 
misspelled.[6][7] The settlement suffered in the flood of 1861, and the 
inhabitants rebuilt their homes on higher ground. Further floods in 1943, 
1945, 1946 and 1948 hampered the growth of the community, and it was not 
until dams were built in the 1950s to regulate the flow of the Willamette 
that Keizer began to flourish. Many times the City of Salem tried to annex 
the growing community adjacent to its city limits.[8] Beginning in 1964, 
a number of Keizer residents tried to convince the people of Keizer that 
it would be cheaper and better to form their own city. It was not until 
November 2, 1982, when, with the support of the nearby unincorporated community 
of Clear Lake, residents voted to make Keizer a city.[8] Keizer Bottom 
is now the site of Keizer Rapids Park, a public park whose attractions 
include a dog park, playground, boat-in camping, nature trails, a disc 
golf course, and sport courts. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 7.21 square miles (18.67 km2), of which, 7.09 
square miles (18.36 km2) is land and 0.12 square miles (0.31 km2) is water.[2]
