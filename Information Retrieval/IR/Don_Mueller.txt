Donald Frederick Mueller (April 14, 1927 – December 28, 2011) was a professional 
baseball player who played mainly as a right fielder in Major League Baseball 
for 12 seasons from 1948 until 1959. The first 10 of those years were spent 
with the New York Giants, for whom he batted over .300 for three consecutive 
seasons (1953–55) and led the National League in hits (212) in 1954. Mueller, 
who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, never hit more than 16 home 
runs in a season. He earned the nickname Mandrake the Magician for being 
adept at consistently putting the ball in play and delivering hits through 
the infield.[1] His lifetime batting average was .296. He was born in St. 
Louis, Missouri on April 14, 1927.[2] His father, Walter Mueller, was also 
a major leaguer who spent parts of four seasons during the 1920s with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] The younger Mueller was signed as an amateur free 
agent out of Christian Brothers College High School by the Giants in 1944.[3] 
Mueller played a central, but painful, role in the famous October 3, 1951, 
playoff game that won the NL pennant for the Giants. With New York trailing 
the Brooklyn Dodgers, 4–1, in the ninth inning, Mueller singled Alvin Dark 
to third base. With one out, Whitey Lockman doubled to score Dark, but 
Mueller sprained his ankle sliding into third. He was carried from the 
field, and missed both Bobby Thomson's game-winning home run that followed 
Lockman's hit and the 1951 World Series.[citation needed] But in 1954 – 
when he finished second to teammate Willie Mays in the NL batting race 
– Mueller batted .389 in the 1954 Fall Classic to help lead the Giants 
to a four-game sweep of the Cleveland Indians. Mueller finished his playing 
career with the 1958–59 Chicago White Sox. In 1,245 MLB games played—1,171 
as a Giant—he compiled 1,292 hits, including 139 doubles, 37 triples and 
65 home runs. His career OPS was .712. He briefly scouted for the San Francisco 
Giants after his playing career ended. Mueller died on December 28, 2011,
