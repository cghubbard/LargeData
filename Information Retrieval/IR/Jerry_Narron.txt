As Player As Manager Jerry Austin Narron (born January 15, 1956) is a former 
American Major League Baseball catcher and manager. During an 8-year playing 
career, he played from 1979 to 1987 for three teams. During a 7-year managing 
career, he managed from 2001 to 2007 for the Texas Rangers and the Cincinnati 
Reds. He went to college at East Carolina University.[1] Narron was born 
in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Through his childhood he played baseball 
at the Wayne County Boys Club, and played football and baseball at Goldsboro 
High School where he graduated in 1974. Narron was drafted out of high 
school in the sixth round by the New York Yankees in the 1974 Major League 
Baseball Draft and played alongside brother Johnny in Johnson City, Tennessee, 
during his first professional season. Narron played for the Yankees as 
the backup catcher to Thurman Munson, who died in a plane crash in August, 
1979. Narron was then traded to the Seattle Mariners, and also played for 
the California Angels before retiring as a player in 1989. He was the Yankees' 
starting catcher the day after Munson's death,[2][3] and remained in the 
dugout during the pregame ceremonies, leaving the catcher's position empty, 
out of respect for Munson.[2] Narron was a manager in the Baltimore Orioles 
farm system from 1989 through 1992, when he was hired as a coach for the 
Orioles by skipper Johnny Oates. After two seasons in Baltimore, he moved 
with Oates to the Texas Rangers. Narron was third-base coach for the Rangers 
from 1995 until he was named interim manager May 4, 2001 after the firing 
of manager Johnny Oates. He had the interim tag removed and coached the 
team during the 2002 campaign. He was replaced in Texas by Buck Showalter 
in December 2002. Narron then served as bench coach for the Boston Red 
Sox during their 2003 run to the ALCS and performed the same role for Cincinnati 
in 2004–05. In 1995, when the Rangers opened their season after the strike 
which canceled the World Series the previous year, it was at Yankee Stadium. 
The first game back from the strike held special significance for Narron 
since it reminded him of the day after Thurman Munson died and he was the 
Yankees' starting catcher for the first game after that tragedy, which 
was also played at the old Yankee Stadium. On this particular day after 
the baseball strike ended, Narron was the Rangers' 3rd-base coach.[3] Narron 
was named as the Reds' interim manager on June 20, 2005. On September 29 
of that year, his contract was extended to cover the 2006 season with mutual 
option for 2007. Narron was fired as manager of the Reds on July 1, 2007. 
The Reds named advance scout Pete Mackanin as the interim manager. Narron's 
record with the Reds was 157–179. On February 25, 2008, Narron was named 
a special assignments scout and front-office consultant with his former 
team, the Rangers. Narron, served as bench coach for the Milwaukee Brewers 
from 2011-2015. Narron was the third base coach for Israel at the 2017 
World Baseball Classic qualifier.[4] Narron is the recent husband to Donna 
Narron. He is a father to seven children, 5 of his own Callie, Caitlyn, 
Clare, Cara, and Connor and 2 Stepchildren, Hunter and Chelsy. Connor was 
the fourth ranked prospect for the high school class of 2010 by ESPN's 
Perfect Game. Narron's brother, Johnny is the former hitting coach for 
the Milwaukee Brewers, when he replaced Dale Sveum. He is the nephew of 
former Major League catcher Sam W. Narron and cousin of pitcher Sam F.
