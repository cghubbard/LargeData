Logansport is a city in and the county seat of Cass County, Indiana, United 
States.[6] The population was 18,396 at the 2010 census. Logansport is 
located in northern Indiana at the junction of the Wabash and Eel rivers, 
northeast of Lafayette. Logansport was settled circa 1826 and named for 
a half Shawnee soldier named James Renick-Logan, better known as “Captain 
Logan” who served as a scout for U.S. forces in the surrounding area during 
the War of 1812.[7] Logansport is home to a refurbished Dentzel Carousel.[8] 
Of many carousels built by the Dentzel Carousel Company, the refurbished 
Dentzel Carousel is "one of the three earliest Dentzel menagerie carousels 
that are virtually intact".[9] The carousel resides in Riverside Park on 
the banks of the Eel River. Riders may attempt to grab a brass ring while 
riding, this carousel game serves as the current basis for the local economic-development 
slogan “Logansport – Cass County: Grab the brass ring”. The Carousel is 
on the National Register of Historic Places and is a national landmark.[10] 
Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Bankers 
Row Historic District, Courthouse Historic District, Ferguson House, Jerolaman-Long 
House, John Keip House, Kendrick-Baldwin House, Willard B. Place House, 
Point Historic District, Pollard-Nelson House, and Henry Tousley House.[11] 
Logansport Community High School is the home of the oldest known high school 
mascot in Indiana, Felix the Cat.[12] Three competing legends claim to 
tell its origin story, however all accounts agree that at some point between 
1925 and 1926, Felix the Cat was brought into the high school's tradition.[13] 
Logansport also has a diverse transportation history. The Wabash and Erie 
Canal reached Logansport in 1837, contributing the “port” to Logansport's 
name, as in “Logan's port”. The Historic Michigan Road runs through Logansport. 
Michigan Road was one of the first roads in Indiana. It runs from Madison, 
Indiana (South), to Michigan City, Indiana (North).There are many different 
names for the road, including Michigan Road, State Road 29, and US 421. 
Also several different passenger and freight train routes also served Logansport. 
The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and Ladies Auxiliary held its 1935 
convention in Logansport. Logansport still has two active railroads and 
a switch yard, as well as a small refurbished depot downtown, although 
the much larger Pan Handle Depot was demolished in 1962. Early in the 20th 
century, Logansport was home to the pioneering brass era automobile company 
Rutenber that had been based previously in Chicago and that renamed itself 
the Western Motor Company when it moved to Logansport. Edwin Rutenber started 
the Western Motor Company after inventing the first four-cylinder automobile 
engine. Rutenber was a prolific inventor who held dozens of patents ranging 
from the first automobile four-cylinder engine and distributor cap system 
to many electric home appliances, whose modern versions are still in use 
today. In 2009, Logansport was designated a Preserve America Community. 
This designation was bestowed upon Logansport by former First Lady Laura 
Bush, as one of her last unofficial duties before leaving the White House. 
Preserve America Executive Order Signed by President George W. Bush on 
March 3, 2003, Executive Order 13287, "Preserve America," complements the 
Preserve America initiative. Preserve America Community designations are 
awarded to communities that: Logan's Landing is a nonprofit economic development 
organization that focuses on the downtown of Logansport between the junction 
of the southernmost terminus of the Eel River as it joins the Wabash River. 
The City of Logansport Economic Development Organization is another nonprofit 
economic development organization that focuses on development outside of 
the downtown area, such as industrial parks, available commercial buildings 
other than downtown buildings, and other available undeveloped land. The 
Logansport – Cass County Chamber of Commerce is a forum for local business 
leadership, as an interface between businesses and the local community. 
Logansport is home to the McHale Performing Arts Center, adjacent to Logansport 
High School. As a fine facility and technically one of the best equipped 
auditoriums in the state, McHale PAC plays host to the annual Winter Fantasy 
Production, as sponsored by a union of the organizations in the Logansport 
High School Performing Arts Department. These musicals are held every year 
during the last weekend prior to the Thanksgiving holiday. The facility 
also holds the rest of the department's annual events, including the LHS 
Tony Awards, SNL, the All School Production and various music department 
concerts. Out-of-town live soloists and troupes also put on several live-performance 
shows per year at McHale. As a modern facility for the performing arts, 
Loganport's McHale is comparable to similar-sized venues in similar-sized 
towns and cities throughout the Great Lakes region, such as the Honeywell 
Center in Wabash, Indiana, The Tibbits Opera House in Coldwater, Michigan, 
The Croswell Opera House in Adrian, Michigan, The Opera House of Sandwich 
in Sandwich, Illinois, The Round Barn Theatre in Nappanee, Indiana, and 
the Williams Theatre on the campus of IPFW in Fort Wayne. The loaning of 
the facility's equipment is in high demand by many amateur as well as professional 
venues throughout the state. Logansport also has the oldest art organization 
in Indiana. The Logansport Art Association (LAA) was founded in February 
1911. What began as a Neightborhood Art Club in 1894 is now an art center 
that offers art classes, show opportunities, art supplies, and special 
events. The LAA holds annual fine art competitions and shows that draw 
local and statewide artists. This includes the Black & White Show in February, 
Youth Art Shows in March and April, Fine Arts Show in May and June, The 
Photography Competition in October, and our Members Invitational in November. 
Logansport hosts an annual arts festival Art on the Avenue, every September, 
which is the largest art festival in the region. Many of the area's festivals 
and events are held at Little Turtle Waterway. Little Turtle Waterway is 
an architect-designed public space and trail system along the Wabash River 
in downtown Logansport. Logansport also hosts the annual Med Flory Jazz 
Festival every spring in downtown Logansport. Med Flory is a well-known 
jazz musician and actor from Logansport. Until recent years, to honor its 
rich railroad history, Logansport held its annual Iron Horse Festival. 
When many of the trains were taken out of the area, the festival had turned 
into a Heritage Festival, but then eventually canceled. Other annual festivals 
in Logansport include: Logansport Community School Corporation serves the 
city of Logansport and surrounding area. With an enrollment of over 4,500,[14] 
the corporation utilizes 8 different buildings: Despite also having Felix 
the Cat as their official mascot (which is considered as Indiana's oldest 
recognized mascot)[15] and de facto logo throughout academic and athletic 
programs, the moniker of Logansport High School's athletic teams is the 
Loganberries, which is a pun regarding on the city's name vis a vis the 
loganberry hybrid of a blackberry and a red raspberry. The basketball gymnasium 
at Logansport High School furthers the pun by being officially named the 
Berry Bowl. The Berry Bowl is connected through the school to the McHale 
Performing Arts Center which boasts a beautiful view of the adjacent courtyard 
and entrance hall. The town is home to two institutions of higher learning, 
a regional campus of Indiana’s Ivy Tech community college that offers associates, 
bachelors, and certification, as well as a satellite campus of Trine University 
offering associates, bachelors, and master's degrees.[16][17] Logansport
