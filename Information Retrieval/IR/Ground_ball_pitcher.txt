In baseball, a ground ball pitcher (also ground-ball pitcher or groundball 
pitcher) is a type of pitcher that has a tendency to induce ground balls 
from opposing batters.[1] The average ground ball pitcher has a ground 
ball rate of at least 50% with extreme ground ball pitchers maintaining 
a ground ball rate of around 55%. Pitchers with a ground ball rate lower 
than 50% may be classified as flyball pitchers or as pitchers who exhibit 
the tendencies of both ground ball and fly ball pitchers.[2] Ground ball 
pitchers rely on pitches that are low in the strike zone with substantial 
downward movement,[1] such as splitters and sinker balls.[3] Baseball analysts 
and sabermetricians Tom Tango, Mitchel Lichtman, and Andrew Dolphin agree 
that ground ball pitchers are generally better pitchers than those with 
fly ball tendencies.[4] Meanwhile, baseball writer and analyst Bill James 
argues the opposite because of injury patterns among ground ball pitchers.[5] 
Against a ground ball pitcher, batters tend to ground out rather than fly 
out.[6] A ground ball pitcher’s ability to keep balls in the infield in 
turn keeps balls from resulting in home runs which, according to Hardball 
Times writer David Gassko, is the strongest benefit of a ground ball pitcher. 
When a ground ball pitcher does allow a pitch to be bat into the air, it 
is likely to result in a line drive.[7] Compared to fly ball pitchers, 
ground ball pitchers generally allow fewer extra base hits yet more total 
hits. Likewise, ground ball pitchers tend to give up fewer home runs than 
fly ball pitchers.[8] Ground ball pitchers tend to perform better against 
ground ball hitters than they perform against fly ball hitters.[4] Compared 
to fly ball pitchers, ground ball pitchers are more likely to allow unearned 
runs. David Gassko notes that 2.23% of ground balls result in an error, 
and these errors account for 85% of all errors. Accordingly, as Gassko 
argues, the susceptibility of ground balls to errors results in more unearned 
runs.[7] With runners on base, ground ball pitchers often force double 
plays because the weak contact batters make with a ground ball pitcher’s 
pitches prevents the ball from passing the infield defense.[1] Ground ball 
rate, or ground ball percentage, is the percentage of batted balls that 
are hit as ground balls against a pitcher.[8] A typical ground ball pitcher 
has a ground ball rate over 50% while an extreme ground ball pitcher maintains 
a ground ball rate of 55% or higher.[2] Pitchers with high ground ball 
rates sustain lower BABIP, or Batting Average against Balls in Play (Hardball), 
on ground balls than those with low ground ball rates.[8] Ground ball pitchers 
rely on pitches that are likely to induce weak contact from the batter, 
thus resulting in a ground ball.[1] Pitches that are low in the strike 
zone with high negative horizontal or vertical movement and high velocity, 
such as splitters, sinkers, curveballs, and two-seam fastballs, result 
in the highest percentage of ground balls. According to data from the 2012 
major league season, splitters and sinker balls result in the highest percentages 
of ground balls compared to other pitches, with 50.3% and 49.8%, respectively.[3] 
The sinker ball has an ability to “dive” at the plate, often resulting 
in ground balls.[9] Several ground ball pitchers such as Tim Hudson, Greg 
Maddux, Derek Lowe, Chien-Ming Wang, Brandon Webb, and Jake Westbrook rely 
heavily on their sinker pitches and may often be considered sinkerballers.[10][11][12][13][14][15] 
Self-proclaimed ground ball pitcher Zach Day has indicated that his primary 
pitch is a sinker ball as well.[16] Tim Hudson notes that he transformed 
from a strikeout pitcher to a ground ball pitcher because of the capabilities 
of his sinker ball. He also notes that he feels double plays are easy to 
force with a ground ball.[10] As of 1998, 72% of balls put in play against 
Greg Maddux resulted in ground balls,[17] who often relies on a sinker 
ball.[11] In June 2002, Lowe allowed eleven fly balls to 129 batters, relying 
on his sinker to induce ground balls.[12] According to a scouting report 
by Lewis Shaw, Brandon Webb’s sinker possesses heavy downward movement 
and high velocity, and one of his notable tendencies is to induce ground 
balls from right-handed hitters.[14] In a World Series game on October 
21, 1996, against the New York Yankees, then-Atlanta Braves pitcher Greg 
Maddux pitched one fly ball and eighteen ground balls, earning nineteen 
of twenty-four outs on ground balls with Wade Boggs grounding into a double 
play. Yankees’ catcher Joe Girardi said of Maddux’s performance, “[H]e 
has a great sinker and he gets a lot of ground balls.” Braves center fielder 
Marquis Grissom noted, “He [Maddux] works fast. His games are not boring, 
by no means. That’s his style of pitching. He’s a ground ball pitcher.” 
Baseball writer Murray Chass noted the similarities between this World 
Series game and a World Series game Maddux pitched against the Cleveland 
Indians a year prior, which resulted in a loss by the Indians, who scored 
two unearned runs. In this game, Maddux earned nineteen ground outs and 
pitched two fly balls.[11] In game three of the American League Championship 
Series between the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox in 2007, Indians 
pitcher Jake Westbrook used his sinker ball to induce fifteen ground ball
