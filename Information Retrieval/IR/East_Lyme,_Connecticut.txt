East Lyme is a town in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The 
population was 19,159 at the 2010 census.[1] East Lyme is located in southern 
New London County, west of Waterford and Montville, east of Lyme and Old 
Lyme, and south of Salem. Long Island Sound is to the south. According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 42.0 square 
miles (109 km2), of which 34.0 square miles (88 km2) is land and 7.9 square 
miles (20 km2), or 18.89%, is water. The town consists primarily of two 
villages, Flanders and Niantic. It is common for the town of East Lyme 
to be erroneously called "Niantic", due to this side of town being the 
"beach" side which is popular with tourists and visitors in the summer 
months. Niantic's population doubles in the summer months for the beach 
season, and it has a much higher density than the more sparsely populated 
Flanders side of town, which is known for its apple orchards, the town's 
high school, and forest. The village of Niantic gets its name from the 
Niantic or Nehantic people, whose ranging grounds once extended from Wecapaug 
Brook, in what is now Rhode Island, to the Connecticut River. Shortly before 
the first settlers arrived, the Pequots had invaded Nehantic territory 
and annexed about half of the land claimed by the tribe. According to local 
historian Olive Tubbs Chendali: It was the construction of the railroad 
in 1851 that lured people to the shoreline which up to this time had been 
known - not as Niantic - but as "The Bank". Long before this time, however, 
as evidenced by The Diary of Joshua Hempstead - 1711 - 1758 it was known 
as "Nahantick" "Nyantick" or "Nehantic", the home territory of the Nehantic 
Indians.[2] Sportfishing and marinas dominate the village's industry along 
with summer tourism and restaurant trade. Strong regional businesses include 
seafood restaurants and hotels/motels serving the town's beaches and the 
casinos at Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. Rocky Neck State Park features camping, 
swimming and picnic areas along with numerous marinas and sportfishing 
companies. The Niantic Bay Boardwalk is a one-mile (1.6 km) long walkway 
that runs parallel to Amtrak shoreline railroad tracks and spans the length 
of Niantic Bay from the Niantic River inlet to Hole-in-the-Wall municipal 
beach. It first opened to the public in 2005, but was closed from about 
2011 due to a combination of Amtrak building a new railroad bridge across 
the Niantic River, which required a re positioning of the approach tracks 
and damage caused by Hurricane Irene in October 2011.[3] The boardwalk 
fully re-opened to the public in March 2016.[4] The Children's Museum of 
Southeastern Connecticut is located in East Lyme's original public library 
on Main Street. The museum is aimed primarily at children ages infant to 
ten years old. The current public library is located on Society Road, away 
from Niantic. The village of Niantic includes the beach communities of 
Attawan Beach, Black Point, Crescent Beach, Giants Neck Beach, Giants Neck 
Heights, Oak Grove Beach, Old Black Point, Pine Grove, and Saunder's Point. 
The village of Flanders, originally a farming area along the Old Post Road, 
gets its name from the development of woolen mills similar to that in Flanders, 
Belgium.[5] The heart of the village is located at Flanders Four Corners 
which is the intersection of Chesterfield Road (Route 161) with the Boston 
Post Road (Route 1) This area is the site of many small stores and businesses, 
as well as East Lyme High School, Flanders Elementary School, and the Board 
of Education. Flanders was the original center of the East Lyme society 
with dozens of 18th century homes, shops and public inns situated along 
the Boston Post Roads until the early 1800s. It losts its pre-eminance 
as Niantic began to flourish, first with the growth of commercial fishing 
and then with the construction of the Shore Line Railway.[6] Many of the 
original Flanders homes have been lost as a result of the construction 
Interstate 95 in the 1950s and subsequent commercial construction at the 
Four Corners area. For example, the old Caulkins Tavern stood at the site 
of the current CVS and was a well traveled and documented stopping place 
in the 18th century from none other than Sarah Knight in his diary as well 
as General George Washington who stopped here with thousands of troops 
in 1776.[7] Some homes remain closer to the Waterford line at the site 
of the old Beckwith Shipyard at the head of the Niantic River. Golden Spur 
is a community located at the head of the Niantic River, which earned it 
its other name, "Head of the River". In the eighteenth century it was the 
site of the Beckwith shipyard. By the turn of the 20th century it was the 
site of an amusement park accessible by trolley run by the East Lyme Street 
Railway. The park operated until 1924.[8] The topography of East Lyme consists 
of rolling hills and lush valleys rounded by glaciers during the last Ice 
Age. Hills rise to elevations of 250 to 350 feet (76 to 107 m) above sea 
level in the eastern and central areas of the town. The highest point in 
town is an unnamed hilltop with an elevation of 500 feet (150 m) located 
in Nehantic State Forest in the northwest corner of the town.[9] East Lyme 
is especially scenic in the summer when the trees are in bloom. On its 
east and southern sides, the town abuts tidewater. The tidal Niantic River 
on the east feeds Niantic Bay, an arm of Long Island Sound, which forms 
the southern edge of the town. As of the census[12] of 2000, there were 
18,118 people, 6,308 households, and 4,535 families residing in the town. 
The population density was 532.3 people per square mile (205.6/km2). There

years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average 
family size was 2.96. In the town the population was spread out with 21.9% 
under the age of 18, 6.3% from 18 to 24, 33.4% from 25 to 44, 25.8% from 
45 to 64, and 12.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was

age 18 and over, there were 90.8 males. The median income for a household 
in the town was $66,539, and the median income for a family was $74,430. 
Males had a median income of $53,333 versus $37,162 for females. The per

of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.0% of those 
under age 18 and 3.5% of those age 65 or over. The town's public schools 
are operated by the East Lyme School District. The school district consists 
of one high school, East Lyme High School; one middle school, East Lyme 
Middle School (grades 5-8); and three elementary schools: The East Lyme 
High School has been recognized by Newsweek magazine[14] as one of the 
top 1,000 high schools in the country and by U.S. News & World Report[15] 
as one of the top 500 high schools in the United States. East Lyme High 
School hosts the East Lyme Aquatic & Fitness Center. The center contains 
an eight-lane, 25-yard-long (23 m), competition swimming and diving pool, 
and a fitness facility with Nautilus equipment, free weights, and a cardiovascular 
line. The facility is used by high school swimming and diving teams as 
well as being open to the public, on a fee basis, when not in use by the 
school. East Lyme High School athletic teams have recently won the Class 
L State Championships in girls volleyball for the 2010 and 2011 seasons, 
and reached the Class M State Finals in girls tennis in 2012. Students 
from the neighboring town of Salem also attend East Lyme High School. The 
East Lyme Middle School[16] is a 1999–2000 National Blue Ribbon School 
and a 2004 New England League of Middle Schools Spotlight School. It is 
also the Connecticut Association of Schools 2013-2014 School of the Year. 
It includes a high tech computer lab and a spacious library. The Middle 
School uses a team program called kivas. A kiva contains a science teacher, 
a language arts or English teacher, a social studies teacher and a math 
teacher. Some kivas are smaller and have a math and science teacher and 
a language arts and social studies teacher. There are 11 kivas consisting 
of two types: multi-age looping and two-year looping. The last kiva is 
a world language kiva where students can study French or Spanish. The Thomas 
Lee House, built circa 1660, is the oldest house in Connecticut that is 
still in its primitive state. This building is located in the southwestern 
section of East Lyme, adjacent to Rocky Neck State Park, at the intersection 
of Connecticut Route 156 and Giants Neck Road. Co-located on this site 
is the one-room Little Boston Schoolhouse, which was relocated to its current 
location from across Route 156. The town features six homes from 1699 or 
earlier, and the Old Stone Church Burial Ground from 1719 located off Society 
and Riverview roads. The area occupied by the town was originally inhabited 
by the Nehantic people, who maintained villages in the present-day Indian 
Woods section as well as on Black Point, in the McCooks Beach area and 
near the Niantic River. The tribe allied itself with the colonists in the 
1636 war against the Pequot people. The Nehantic eventually died out in 
the mid-19th century. The 1750s Ezra Stiles map shows the Nehantic village 
in what is now Indian Woods as consisting of "12 or 13 huts". East Lyme, 
then a part of Lyme, had several taverns which offered stopping places 
for travelers such as Sarah Kemble Knight. These included Calkins Tavern 
on what is now Boston Post Road, Royce's Tavern, and Taber Tavern near 
present-day I-95. At least 45 Revolutionary War veterans are buried within 
the borders of East Lyme, and countless more veterans from East Lyme found 
resting places in upstate New York, New Hampshire and Ohio. Moses Warren, 
along with General Samuel Holden Parsons originally of Lyme and Moses Cleaveland, 
set out to survey the Ohio Territory in the latter part of the 1790s and 
has Warren County, Ohio named after him.[17] The first library was started 
in 1888 and was called the Niantic Library and Reading Room Association. 
There were 65 founding members. In 1897 the library was formally incorporated 
as "The Niantic Public Library Association" by the state of Connecticut. 
The library moved a few times until a permanent structure was built in 
1920 on Main Street. In 1966 a wing was added, and in 1979 another addition 
was added. In 1990 the library moved into the new Community Center/Library 
complex, where it exists today. FM station WNLC is based in East Lyme. 
In 2016, East Lyme was used as a filming location for the Lifetime Thriller, 
Hunter's Cove. According to 2009 statistics[18] 42.2 percent of the town's 
business was focused in the services industry. A service industry is a 
business that focuses on retail, food services, distribution, and transportation.[19] 
The second largest sector is the trade industry with 23.1% of the town's 
business, followed by construction and mining which accounts for 12.5% 
of the town businesses. The largest single employer in town is the state 
of Connecticut's Department of Corrections which runs two prisons in the 
west end of town: York Correctional Facility for women, which houses over 
1,000 inmates and is staffed by over 500 personnel,[20] and the Gates Correctional 
Institute for men, which houses about 900 inmates and is staffed by 288
