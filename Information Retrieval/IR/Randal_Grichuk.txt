Randal Alexander Grichuk (born August 13, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball center fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim drafted him in the first round 
of the 2009 MLB Draft from Lamar Consolidated High School in Rosenberg, 
Texas. He played five seasons in the Angels' minor leagues system, losing 
time to injury but also developing home-run hitting ability throughout. 
The Angels traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals in November 2013, and 
he made his major league debut on April 28, 2014. Acclaim has followed 
Grichuk for his power-hitting ability, speed and defense. He plays all 
three outfield positions, possessing a strong arm and patrolling mainly 
right field in the minor leagues. Originally projected to be a first baseman 
before the draft, he improved his outfield defense and won the Gold Glove 
Award for all minor league right fielders in 2013. In 2003 and 2004, Grichuk 
participated in the Little League World Series for Lamar National of Richmond, 
Texas.[1] He was featured in Sports Illustrated's "Faces in the Crowd" 
section in July 2005.[2] Grichuk attended Lamar Consolidated High School 
in Rosenberg, Texas. In 2008, as a Lamar Consolidated Baseball player, 
he was a First Team All-State OF and the All-Houston Area Most Valuable 
Player (MVP). That season, Grichuk batted .435 with 18 HR and 45 RBI, leading 
the mustangs to a school record 29 wins and a Regional Final appearance. 
In 2009 he was the 24-4A District MVP, Fort Bend Area MVP, 2009 1st Team 
All State OF, and 2009 1st Team All-American (EA Sports and Baseball America). 
In 28 games he hit .613 with 21 HR, 46 hits, 46 RBI and 47 runs before 
Lamar was defeated in the third round of the playoffs. Grichuk committed 
to attend the University of Arizona.[3] The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 
drafted Grichuk in the first round, with the 24th overall selection, in 
the 2009 MLB Draft, one selection ahead of Mike Trout.[4] Grichuk signed 
with the Angels, rather than attend college. A series of three unusual 
injuries delayed the outfield prospect's development. First, he tore a 
ligament after just 12 games in 2010. Second, he batted a foul ball that 
fractured his knee cap. Finally, while diving for a ball, he broke his 
wrist. In 2012, his first full season, Grichuk played 135 games and batted 
.298 with 18 home runs and 71 runs batted in with the Class-A Inland Empire 
66ers. After a promotion to the Double-A Arkansas Travelers in 2013, he 
made 128 appearances, batting .256 with 22 HR and 64 RBI.[5] In October, 
2013, Rawlings and MiLB announced Grichuk was the recipient of the Minor 
League Gold Glove Award for right field.[6] MLB.com ranked Grichuk as the 
Angels' No. 4 prospect after the 2013 season, and the club added him to 
their 40-man roster on November 20, 2013.[7] Two days later, they traded 
him along with Peter Bourjos to the St. Louis Cardinals for David Freese 
and Fernando Salas.[8] Grichuk began the 2014 season with the Memphis Redbirds 
of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.[9] The Cardinals promoted him to 
the majors for the first time on April 28, 2014, after he had batted .310 
with a .359 OBP, .529 SLG, six walks and 17 strikeouts.[10] He debuted 
as a defensive replacement in the outfield that day. Grichuk made his first 
major league start in center field the next day, collecting a single in 
five at-bats for his first major league hit.[11] The Cardinals optioned 
him back to Memphis shortly thereafter. On May 21, he showed the authorities 
what he could do with a big game-winning home run versus the Colorado Springs 
Sky Sox, giving an anonymous fan an autograph after the game. Shortly afterwards, 
the Cardinals recalled him to the big leagues on May 30. He improved his 
AAA numbers, batting .315 with a .363 OBP, .589 SLG and ten HR.[12] Grichuk 
received the Cardinals' minor league system Player of the Month Award for 
May, 2014.[13] On June 7, he hit his first major league home run off Toronto 
Blue Jays' starter Mark Buehrle in a 5–0 victory.[14] Grichuk produced 
a .944 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) in 44 spring training at 
bats in 2015 and made the major league club as a fifth outfielder.[15] 
While lifting weights, he strained his lower back, halting his play on 
April 16 and prompting the Cardinals to place him on the 15-day DL.[16] 
On May 16, the Cardinals activated him from the disabled list.[17] After 
striking out five times on May 18, he followed up with two doubles and 
a triple the next night against the New York Mets, as the Cardinals prevailed 
10–2.[18] When Matt Holliday went on the DL in early June, that opened 
Grichuk's first legitimate opportunity for regular playing time in the 
major leagues, including all three outfield positions.[15] From June 19–20 
against the Philadelphia Phillies, he forged consecutive three-hit games, 
including hitting a home run in the first game, then two in the second.[19] 
On June 30, he was a double short of hitting for the cycle in a 2–1 loss 
to the Chicago White Sox. His home run off Chris Sale traveled 448 feet 
(137 m), however, and landed in the Big Mac Land section of Busch Stadium. 
Through that point in the season, it was the longest home run of the year 
there by a Cardinals player.[20] Setting a new career high with six runs 
batted in on July 18, Grichuk also homered twice in a 12–2 win over the 
Mets.[21] On August 5 against the Cincinnati Reds, he doubled in the sixth 
inning and hit the game-winning home run in the top of the 13th at Great 
American Ball Park in a 4–3 game.[22] After straining his right elbow, 
the Cardinals placed Grichuk on the disabled list on August 17.[23] The 
Cardinals reactivated him less than one month later. On September 10, he 
played center field against the Chicago Cubs, but was not permitted to 
throw as his elbow had still not fully recovered.[24] After the season, 
he underwent surgery to repair a sports hernia.[25] Out of spring training 
in 2016, Grichuk won the role as starting center fielder.[26] He hit his 
first career walk-off home run on May 23 in a 4–3 win against the Cubs.[27] 
With his overall offensive output in decline from the previous year, the 
Cardinals optioned him to, and recalled him from, Memphis on multiple occasions 
in 2016.[28] On August 13, 2016 − his 25th birthday − Grichuk hit his first 
career grand slam, providing the margin in an 8−4 win over the Cubs, and 
ending their 11-game win streak.[29] He produced the game-winning RBI double 
on August 19 against Philadelphia Phillies in the 11th inning of a 4−3 
win.[30] Grichuk ended 2016 with a .240 batting average along with 24 home 
runs and 48 RBI's.[31] In 2014, Randal Grichuk was projected with potential 
as a power hitter in the major leagues possessing the athleticism and preparedness 
to handle center field well. At the plate, his most evident ability is 
to hit the ball with power and loft to all fields, easily give him potential 
for 20 or more home runs a season. With a smooth and compact stroke, his 
bat speed through the zone is at least average and frequently faster. His 
pitch recognition allows him the ability to work counts and he becomes 
more aggressive in hitter's counts. This approach yields lower-than-average 
walk rates but with a strikeout rate of less than 20 percent. One obvious 
weakness is that he misses easy pitches – such as high fastballs in the 
middle of the plate – that major league hitters rarely miss.[34] According 
to Baseball America's Kary Booher, Grichuk possesses an athletic frame 
with average arm and enough range to profile into an outfield corner slot. 
Through 2013, he has shown a low walk rate but has enough balance and bat 
control to bat .260 or higher in the major leagues.[35] Grichuk drew widespread 
attention for his raw power and bat speed in 2015. As of August 11, 2015, 
the average exit velocity of all his batted balls on the season was seventh 
in the major leagues at 93.17 miles per hour (149.94 km/h). The average 
for all fly balls and line drives only was fourth at 97.79 miles per hour 
(157.38 km/h).[36] Originally projected to be a first baseman, Grichuk 
expanded his versatility to the outfield thanks in part to extra preparation 
and a sleek and proportioned athletic frame. For what he lacks in the classic 
speed of center fielders, he mitigates with robust jumps and precise route 
running and positioning to easily anticipate the trajectory of – and catch 
– balls hit to the outfield. His arm strength and range allow him the ability 
to cut off runners at times from extra bases on the occasional plays for
