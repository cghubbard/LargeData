As Player As Manager Wallace Kaname "Wally" Yonamine (与那嶺要, Yonamine Kaname?, 
June 24, 1925 – February 28, 2011), also known as Wally Yonamine, was a 
multi-sport American athlete who played in the All-America Football Conference 
(AAFC) and Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. Yonamine, a Nisei Japanese 
American, was born in Hawaii to parents Matsusai (September 1, 1890 – July 
31, 1988) and Kikue (February 14, 1901 – February 26, 1999). A two-sport 
star, he played running back on the San Francisco 49ers in their second 
season (1947), becoming the first football player of Japanese American 
ancestry to play professional football (Walter Achiu was the first Asian-American).[1] 
In his one season with the team, he had 19 carries for 74 yards and caught 
3 passes for 40 yards. His football career ended during the off-season, 
when he broke his wrist playing in an amateur baseball league in Hawaii.[1] 
In baseball, Yonamine was the first American to play professional baseball 
in Japan after World War II. A multi-skilled outfielder, Yonamine was also 
noted for his flexible batting style and aggressive baserunning during 
his career with the Yomiuri Giants and Chunichi Dragons. In Japan, Yonamine 
was a member of four Japan Series Championship teams, the Central League 
MVP in 1957, a consecutive seven-time Best Nine Award winner (1952–58), 
an eleven-time All-Star, a three-time batting champion, and the first foreigner 
to be a manager (Dragons, 1972–77).[citation needed] Wally Kaname Yonamine 
was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994 for his achievements 
during his 12-year career with the Giants and Dragons.[1] He is the only 
American yet admitted into the Hall as a player. He operated a highly successful 
pearl store—Wally Yonamine Pearls[2]—in Roppongi, Tokyo, Japan, with his 
wife Jane. They also had a branch of their store in California run by their 
children. In 2008, Wally Kaname Yonamine joined Master League team Nagoya 
80 D'sers as a coach/part-time player.[3] After an extended battle with 
prostate cancer, Yonamine died on February 28, 2011, aged 85, in Honolulu.[4]
