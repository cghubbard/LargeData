Gregory Brian Minton (born July 29, 1951), nicknamed "Moon Man", is a former 
Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher who played for the California 
Angels and San Francisco Giants. Minton enjoyed a 16-year major league 
career, from 1975 to 1990, and was a member of the 1982 National League 
All-Star Team. A crippling injury in 1979 caused Minton to alter his delivery. 
Instead of using his high leg kick, Minton shortened his stride to take 
pressure off his knee. The new delivery gave Minton a 92-mph sinker that 
batters were unable to drive.[1] Minton went three full seasons (269 1⁄3 
innings) without allowing a home run until John Stearns homered against 
him on May 2, 1982. This is the longest such streak in the post-1920 live-ball 
era. On August 14, 1986, Minton gave up the last of Pete Rose's MLB record 
4,256 career hits. In 1989, Minton made 62 appearances in relief. He earned 
eight saves and a 2.20 earned run average (ERA). Over portions of 1988 
and 1989, he pitched another 105 2⁄3 consecutive innings without giving 
up a home run, which was the longest stretch of this type by any pitcher 
in Angels history. He signed a one-year extension for 1990 worth $850,000.[2] 
He spent much of the 1990 season on the disabled list with elbow problems, 
and he pitched only 15 1⁄3 innings before announcing his retirement that 
October.[3] Consecutive innings pitched without allowing a home run (modern 
era) 269.1 – Greg Minton, San Francisco Giants – June 1, 1979 through May 
1, 1982 After his career as a player, Minton was a pitching coach in the 
California Angels organization and managed the independent Lubbock Crickets 
for two years. Minton's nickname, "Moon Man," stemmed from various escapades 
such as the hijacking of the team bus and the flooding of a minor league 
ballpark so he could leave Amarillo one day early at the end of the season.
