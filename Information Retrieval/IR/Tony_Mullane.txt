Anthony John "Tony" Mullane (January 20, 1859 – April 25, 1944), nicknamed 
"Count" and "The Apollo of the Box", was an Irish Major League Baseball 
player who pitched for seven teams during his 13-season career. He is best 
known as a pitcher that could throw left-handed and right-handed, and for 
having one of the highest career win totals of pitchers not in the Baseball 
Hall of Fame. Born in County Cork, Ireland, Mullane emigrated to the United 
States in 1864. He made his Major League debut with the Detroit Wolverines 
on August 27, 1881, picking up his first career win 9–1 over the Chicago 
White Stockings. Mullane suffered an injury to his right arm and managed 
to teach himself to throw left-handed. Mullane resumed throwing right-handed 
once the injury healed, and he would even alternate throwing right-handed 
and left-handed in the same game, which was easy for him since he did not 
wear a glove. Mullane would face the batter with both hands on the ball, 
and then use either one to throw a pitch. It was not for over a hundred 
years before another ambidextrous pitcher, Greg A. Harris, using a specially 
made ambidextrous glove, did get to switch-pitch in one game shortly before 
he retired with the Montreal Expos, becoming the only such pitcher in the 
20th Century. Harris had spent most of his career prohibited by the Red 
Sox from pitching left-handed. On June 5, 2015 Pat Venditte began his major 
league career by switch pitching two scoreless innings for the Oakland 
Athletics. In 1882, Mullane moved on to the American Association and joined 
the Louisville Eclipse, where he started 55 of the team's 80 games and 
compiled a record of 30–24 with a 1.88 ERA, the first of five consecutive 
30-win seasons. On September 11, he pitched a no-hitter against the Cincinnati 
Red Stockings. He recorded 35 victories with the 1883 St. Louis Browns. 
In 1884, Mullane attempted to sign with the St. Louis Maroons of the Union 
Association, a new independent league, even though under the reserve clause 
the Browns still had rights to his services. Threatened with banishment 
for defying his contract, Mullane relented. The Browns then sold Mullane 
to the expansion Toledo Blue Stockings, with whom Mullane won a career-high 
36 games. The Browns attempted to reclaim Mullane after the 1884 season 
when both the Union Association and the Blue Stockings folded, but before 
the Browns could re-sign him under the rules, Mullane managed to sign with 
Cincinnati. For this action, the American Association suspended Mullane 
for the entire 1885 season. Coming in the midst of his string of consecutive 
30-win seasons, this likely cost Mullane a 300-win career. Following the 
suspension, Mullane joined the Cincinnati Red Stockings for the 1886 season 
and remained there for the next seven and a half years, over which he won 
163 games. At the plate, in 1889 he recorded career-highs with 24 stolen 
bases, a .296 batting average and a slugging percentage of .418 in 196 
at-bats. The 1893 season brought several rules changes, most notably the 
moving of the pitcher's mound an additional five feet from home plate. 
Mullane began the season a mediocre 6–6, and was traded to the Baltimore 
Orioles on June 16. He staggered to an 18–25 record with the Orioles in 
a little more than one full season over 1893 and 1894. Mullane set a dubious 
record on June 18, 1894, by allowing 16 runs in the first inning of a game 
with the Boston Beaneaters. A month later he was traded once again, this 
time to the Cleveland Spiders, for whom he played only four games. Mullane 
retired after the 1894 season with a record of 284–220 and a 3.05 ERA over 
a 13-year career. He also worked five games as an umpire. His 284 wins 
tie him with Ferguson Jenkins for 27th on the all-time list; he is fourth 
among eligible pitchers not in the Hall of Fame, behind only Roger Clemens 
(354), Bobby Mathews (297) and Tommy John (288). Mullane still holds the 
record for the most wild pitches in Major League history, with 343.[1] 
After his baseball career, Mullane went on to join the Chicago Police Department, 
from which he retired in 1924. Tony Mullane died at the age of 85 years 
in Chicago, and is interred in an unmarked grave ( grave 2, lot 48, block 
5, section 58) at Holy Sepulchre Catholic Cemetery located in Worth, Illinois.[2] 
He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds' Hall of Fame on July 17, 2010.
