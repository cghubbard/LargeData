The International League of Independent Professional Base Ball Clubs, also 
referred to as the International League,[1] was a baseball league composed 
of a mix of white, Cuban and Negro league baseball teams in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, as well as New Jersey and Wilmington, Delaware, during the 
summer of 1906. The league was planned to continue the following year,[2] 
but never materialized for 1907. The league was not a traditional "Negro 
league," since fewer than half the teams had all-black rosters. It was 
initially composed of five teams (one white American, two Cuban, and two 
African American),[1] with three later replacement teams. The Havana Stars 
dissolved in June and were replaced by Rivertonâ€“Palmyra;[3] the Cuban Stars 
and Quaker Giants stopped playing their league schedule in July and both 
were replaced.[4] Winners of the season were awarded the Freihofer Cup, 
named after league president William Freihofer.[1] Only 40 games were scheduled; 
eight games per team with each team playing each other twice. The Philadelphia 
Giants were declared the champions even though they joined the league later 
as a replacement team. They inherited a 3-0 record from the Quaker Giants[5] 
and finished their schedule going 4-1, for an official record of 7-1.[2]
