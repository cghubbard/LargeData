Marc Walter Rzepczynski (/zəpˈtʃɪnski/ zəp-CHIN-skee; born August 29, 1985) 
is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has 
played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, St. Louis 
Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, San Diego Padres, Oakland Athletics and Washington 
Nationals. Rzepcynski attended Servite High School in Anaheim, California 
and the University of California, Riverside, where he played college baseball 
for the Highlanders from 2004–2007. In his senior season, the Highlanders 
won the Big West Conference championship and appeared in the NCAA Tournament.[1][2] 
He also played for the Corvallis Knights and the Bellingham Bells (2004) 
in the West Coast League, an independent summer collegiate league. In June 
2007, Rzepczynski was drafted in the fifth round (175th overall) of the 
2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He made his 
professional debut that season for the short-season Jays' Class A affiliate 
Auburn Doubledays of the New York–Penn League. With Auburn, he posted a 
5–0 record and a 2.76 ERA in 11 games (7 starts), with 49 strikeouts and 
17 walks in 45 2⁄3 innings pitched. In 2008, Rzepczynski advanced to the 
Class A Lansing Lugnuts of the Midwest League, where he finished 7–6 with 
a 2.83 ERA in 22 starts, with 124 strikeouts and 42 walks over 121 innings 
pitched. In 2009, Rzepczynski through early July had split his season between 
the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, the Jays' Double-A team in the Eastern League, 
and the Las Vegas 51s, the Jays' Triple-A team in the Pacific Coast League. 
His 2009 statistics between Double-A and Triple-A combined for 16 games 
(all starts), with a 9–5 record, a 2.66 ERA, 104 strikeouts, and 40 walks, 
in 88 innings pitched.[3] A series of injuries to pitchers at the major 
league level had plagued the parent Blue Jays for the first three months 
of the 2009 season, leading to opportunities for several rookies to advance 
to the top level. Scott Richmond, himself a rookie starter who had pitched 
very well for Toronto, became the latest casualty, when he went on the 
disabled list on July 4, retroactive to July 1, due to biceps tendinitis. 
Richmond, before play on July 6, ranked 16th of 40 eligible American League 
pitchers in Earned Run Average (ERA). Brett Cecil, another rookie who is 
already in the Jays' starting rotation, started on July 5 on short notice 
in Richmond's stead, against the New York Yankees, but this still left 
Toronto with only four healthy starters, leading to Rzepczynski's promotion 
and opportunity.[4] Rzepczynski pitched six innings in his debut, during 
which he gave up 2 hits and 1 earned run, walked 4, and struck out 7 in 
a no-decision; the Jays lost, 3–1, in 11 innings. In his second big-league 
start, Rzepczynski again pitched well, but took the loss against the Baltimore 
Orioles on July 12, lasting 6 innings and allowing 3 earned runs; Toronto 
lost the game, 4–2. Rzepczynski won his first major-league game on July 
18, defeating the American League leading Boston Red Sox; he pitched 6 
innings, allowing 1 earned run on 4 hits, walking 4 and striking out 4; 
Toronto won, 6–2. Jays manager Cito Gaston stated before the game that 
Rzepczynski would remain in the rotation for at least the next couple of 
weeks, pending Richmond's return from the disabled list. He was traded 
on July 27, 2011, to the St. Louis Cardinals along with Octavio Dotel, 
Edwin Jackson and Corey Patterson for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever 
Miller and Brian Tallet.[5][6] In 2012, Rzepczynski became a lefty specialist, 
pitching 46.2 innings despite appearing in 70 games for the Cardinals. 
On April 29, 2013, Rzepczynski was optioned to the Memphis Redbirds.[7] 
On July 25, 2013, Rzepczynski was recalled by the St. Louis Cardinals [8] 
On July 30, 2013, Rzepczynski was traded to the Cleveland Indians for minor 
league second baseman Juan Herrera.[9] On July 31, 2015, Rzepczynski was 
traded to the San Diego Padres for Abraham Almonte.[10] On December 2, 
2015, the Padres traded Rzepczynski and Yonder Alonso to the Oakland Athletics 
for Drew Pomeranz, José Torres, and a player to be named later or cash 
considerations.[11] On August 25, 2016, the Athletics traded Rzepczynski 
to the Washington Nationals for Max Schrock.[12] On October 13, 2016, in 
the decisive game in the National League Division Series against the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, Rzepczynski was brought in to relieve Nationals pitcher 
Max Scherzer with the score tied 1-1. Rzepczynski walked the first batter 
he faced on four pitches, and became the losing pitcher in the 4-3 loss 
that eliminated the Nationals from the 2016 playoffs.[13] Rzepczynski is 
of Polish descent.[14] Rzepczynski's nickname is "Scrabble". Marc is currently 
engaged to Lindzey Lawler of Cleveland, Ohio. Their wedding is scheduled
