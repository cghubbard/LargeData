                    The St. Louis Blues are a professional ice hockey team 
in St. Louis, Missouri. They are members of the Central Division of the 
Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team is named 
after the famous W. C. Handy song "Saint Louis Blues," and plays in the 
19,150-seat Scottrade Center in downtown St. Louis. The franchise was founded 
in 1967 as an expansion team during the league's original expansion from 
six to 12 teams. The Blues are the oldest NHL team never to have won the 
Stanley Cup. The Blues were one of the six teams added to the NHL in the 
1967 expansion, along with the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, 
Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and California Seals. St. Louis 
was the last of the six expansion teams to gain entry into the League, 
chosen over Baltimore at the insistence of the Chicago Black Hawks. The 
Black Hawks were owned by the influential Wirtz family of Chicago, which 
also owned the decrepit St. Louis Arena. The Wirtzes sought to unload the 
arena, which had not been well-maintained since the 1940s, and thus pressed 
the NHL to give the franchise to St. Louis, which had not submitted a formal 
expansion bid. NHL President Clarence Campbell said during the 1967 expansion 
meetings that, "We want a team in St. Louis because of the city's geographical 
location and the fact that it has an adequate building."[1] The team's 
first owners were insurance tycoon Sid Salomon Jr., his son, Sid Salomon 
III, and Robert L. Wolfson, who were granted the franchise in 1966. Sid 
Salomon III convinced his initially wary father to make a bid for the team. 
Former St. Louis Cardinals great Stan Musial and Musial's business partner 
Julius "Biggie" Garagnani were also members of the 16-man investment group 
that made the initial formal application for the franchise.[1] Garagnani 
would never see the Blues franchise take the ice, as he died from a heart 
attack on June 19, 1967, less than three months before the Blues played 
their first preseason game.[2] Upon acquiring the franchise in 1966, Salomon 
then spent several million dollars on extensive renovations for the 38-year-old 
arena, which increased the number of seats from 12,000 to 15,000. The Blues 
were originally coached by Lynn Patrick, who resigned in late November 
after recording a 4–13–2 record. He was replaced by Assistant Coach Scotty 
Bowman, who thereafter led the team to a winning record for the rest of 
the season. Although the League's rules effectively kept star players with 
the original six teams, the Blues managed to stand out in the inferior 
Western Division. Capitalizing on a playoff format that required an expansion 
team to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Blues reached the Stanley 
Cup Finals in each of their first three seasons, though they were swept 
first by the Montreal Canadiens in 1968 and 1969, then by the Boston Bruins 
in 1970. While the first Blues teams included aging and fading veterans 
like Doug Harvey, Don McKenney and Dickie Moore, the goaltending tandem 
of veterans Glenn Hall and Jacques Plante proved more durable, winning 
a Vezina Trophy in 1969 behind a sterling defense that featured players 
like skilled defensive forward Jim Roberts, team captain Al Arbour and 
hardrock brothers Bob and Barclay Plager. Phil Goyette won the Lady Byng 
Trophy for the Blues in 1970 and New York Rangers castoff Red Berenson 
became the expansion team's first major star at center. The arena quickly 
became one of the loudest buildings in the NHL, a reputation it maintained 
throughout its tenure as the Blues' home. During that time, Salomon gained 
a reputation throughout the NHL as the top players' owner. He gave his 
players cars, signed them to deferred contracts and treated them to vacations 
in Florida. The players, used to being treated like mere commodities, felt 
the only way they could pay him back was to give their best on the ice 
every night.[3] The Blues' successes in the late 1960s, however, did not 
continue into the 1970s, as the Stanley Cup playoff format changed and 
the Chicago Black Hawks were moved into the Western Division. The Blues 
lost Bowman, who joined the Montreal Canadiens following a power-sharing 
dispute with Sid Salomon III (who was taking an increasing role in team 
affairs),[3] as well as Hall, Plante, Goyette and ultimately Berenson, 
who were all lost to retirement or trade. The Berenson trade, however, 
did bring then-Detroit Red Wings star center Garry Unger, who ultimately 
scored 30 goals in eight consecutive seasons while breaking the NHL's consecutive 
games played record. Defensively, however, the Blues were less than stellar 
and saw Chicago and the Philadelphia Flyers overtake the Division. After 
missing the playoffs for the first time in 1973–74, the Blues ended up 
in the Smythe Division after a League realignment. This division was particularly 
weak, and in 1976–77, the Blues won it while finishing five games below 
.500, though this would be their last playoff appearance in the decade. 
In the meantime, the franchise was on the brink of financial collapse. 
This was partly due to the pressures of the World Hockey Association (WHA), 
but mostly the result of financial decisions made when the Salomons first 
acquired the franchise. Deferred contracts came due just as the Blues' 
performance began to slip. At one point, the Salomons cut the team's staff 
down to three employees. One of them was Emile Francis, who served as team 
president, general manager and head coach. The Salomons finally found a 
buyer in St. Louis-based pet food giant Ralston Purina in 1977, who renamed 
the arena the "Checkerdome." Francis and minority owner Wolfson helped 
put together the deal with Ralston Purina, which ensured that the Blues 
would stay in the city of St. Louis. Only a year after finishing with only 
18 wins (still the worst season in franchise history), the Blues made the 
playoffs in 1980, the first of 25 consecutive post-season appearances. 
The team's improvement continued into 1981, when the Berenson-coached team, 
led by Wayne Babych (54 goals), future Hall of Famer Bernie Federko (104 
points), Brian Sutter (35 goals) and goaltender Mike Liut (second to Wayne 
Gretzky for the Hart Memorial Trophy), finished with 45 wins and 107 points, 
the second-best record in the League. Their regular-season success, however, 
did not transfer into the playoffs, as they were eliminated by the New 
York Rangers in the second round. The Blues followed their generally successful 
1980–81 campaign with two consecutive sub-.500 seasons, though they still 
managed to make the playoffs each year. Purina lost an estimated $1.8 million 
a year during its six-year ownership of the Blues, but took the losses 
philosophically, having taken over out of a sense of civic responsibility. 
In 1983, Purina's longtime chairman, R. Hal Dean, retired. His successor, 
William Stiritz, wanted to refocus on the core pet food business, and had 
no interest in hockey. He saw the Blues as just another money-bleeding 
division, and put the team on the market. The Blues did not pick anyone 
in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft because Purina did not send a representative; 
the company essentially abandoned the team. It finally found a buyer in 
a group of investors led by WHA and Edmonton Oilers founder Bill Hunter, 
who then made plans to move the team to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. However, 
the NHL was unwilling to lose a market as large as St. Louis and vetoed 
the deal. Purina then padlocked the Checkerdome and turned the team over 
to the League. The team appeared destined for contraction when, on July 
27, 1983, Harry Ornest, a Los Angeles-based businessman, came in at the 
11th hour to save the franchise. Ornest immediately reverted the name of 
the team's home to the St. Louis Arena. Ornest ran the Blues on a shoestring 
budget, though the players did not mind. According to Sutter, they wanted 
to stay in St. Louis because it reminded them of the rural Canadian towns 
where many of them grew up. For instance, Ornest asked many players to 
defer their salaries to help meet operating costs, but the players always 
got paid in the end. During most of his tenure, the Blues had only 26 players 
under contract – 23 in St. Louis, plus three on their farm team in Montana. 
Most NHL teams during the mid-1980s had over 60 players under contract.[4] 
Despite being run on the cheap, the Blues remained competitive even though 
they never finished more than six games over .500 in Ornest's three years 
as owner. During this time, Doug Gilmour, drafted by St. Louis in 1982, 
emerged as a star. While the Blues remained competitive, they were unable 
to keep many of their young players. More often than not, several of the 
Blues' emerging stars ended up as Calgary Flames, and the sight of Flames 
executive Al MacNeil was always greeted with dread. In fact, several of 
the Blues' young stars, such as Rob Ramage, Joe Mullen and Gilmour, were 
main cogs in the Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup win. Sutter and Federko were 
the only untouchables on the Blues.[4] By 1986, the team reached the Campbell 
Conference Finals against the Flames. Doug Wickenheiser's overtime goal 
in Game 6 to cap a furious comeback remains one of the greatest moments 
in team history (known locally as the "Monday Night Miracle"), but the 
Blues lost Game 7, 2–1. After that season, Ornest sold the team to a group 
led by St. Louis businessman Michael Shanahan. St. Louis kept chugging 
along through the late 1980s and early 1990s. General Manager Ron Caron 
made astute moves, landing forwards Brett Hull, Adam Oates and Brendan 
Shanahan, defenseman Al MacInnis and goaltender Curtis Joseph, among others. 
While the Blues contended during this time period, they never passed the 
second round of the playoffs. Nonetheless, their on-ice success was enough 
for a consortium of 19 companies to buy the team. They also provided the 
capital to build the Kiel Center (now the Scottrade Center), which opened 
in 1994. Hull, nicknamed the "Golden Brett" (a reference to his father, 
NHL legend Bobby Hull, who was nicknamed the "Golden Jet"), became one 
of the League's top stars and a scoring sensation, netting 86 goals in 
1990–91 en route to earning the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most 
valuable player. Hull's 86 goals set the record for most goals in a single 
season by a right-winger (and the third-most overall at the time). Only 
Wayne Gretzky found the net more than Hull during any given three-year 
period. Despite posting the second-best regular-season record in the entire 
league in 1990–91, the Blues were upset in the second round of the playoffs 
to the Minnesota North Stars, a defeat that was symbolic of St. Louis' 
playoff struggles. Mike Keenan was hired as both general manager and coach 
prior to the abbreviated 1995 season, with the hope that he could cure 
the post-season turmoil Blues fans had endured for years. Keenan instituted 
major changes, including trades that sent away fan favorites Brendan Shanahan 
and Curtis Joseph, as well as the acquisition of the legendary-but-aging 
Wayne Gretzky and goaltender Grant Fuhr, both from the declining Los Angeles 
Kings (due to public criticism from Keenan, Gretzky left for the New York 
Rangers as an unrestricted free agent following the season, in spite of 
a more lucrative contract offer from the Blues). In spite of all he was 
prophesied to accomplish, Keenan's playoff resume with St. Louis included 
a first-round exit in 1995 and a second-round exit in 1996, and he was 
subsequently fired on December 19, 1996. Caron was reinstated as interim 
general manager for the rest of season, and GM Larry Pleau was hired on 
June 9, 1997. However, this did not stop Hull, who had a lengthy feud with 
Keenan, from leaving for the Dallas Stars in 1998. He went on to win the 
Stanley Cup with the Stars the next year, scoring a controversial goal 
on the Buffalo Sabres' Dominik Hasek to clinch the Cup for Dallas. By the 
time the decade ended, the Blues were the only NHL team to make the playoffs 
in all ten years of the 90s. Defenseman Chris Pronger (acquired from the 
Hartford Whalers in 1995 for Brendan Shanahan), Keith Tkachuk, Pavol Demitra, 
Pierre Turgeon, Al MacInnis and goaltender Roman Turek kept the Blues a 
contender in the NHL. In 1999–2000, the team notched a franchise-record 
114 points during the regular season, earning the Presidents' Trophy for 
the League's best record. However, they were stunned by the San Jose Sharks 
in the first round of the 2000 playoffs in seven games. In 2001, the Blues 
advanced to the Western Conference Finals before bowing out in five games 
to the eventual champions, the Colorado Avalanche. Nonetheless, the team 
remained competitive for the next three years, despite never reaching past 
the second round in the playoffs. Despite years of mediocrity and the stigma 
of never being able to "take the next step," the Blues were a playoff presence 
every year from 1980 to 2004 — the third longest streak in North American 
professional sports history (all three of which being held by NHL teams), 
but they never won Stanley Cup Championships, nor made a finals appearances. 
In fact they made it to the conference finals only two times in their streak 
(1986 and 2001). Amid several questionable personnel moves and an unstable 
ownership situation, the Blues finished the 2005–06 season with their worst 
record in 27 years. They missed the playoffs for only the fourth time in 
franchise history. Moreover, for the first time in club history, the normally 
excellent support seen by St. Louisans began to fade away, with crowds 
normally numbering around 12,000, a far cry from the team's normal high 
(about 18,000 in a 19,500 seat arena). Wal-Mart heir Nancy Walton Laurie 
and her husband Bill purchased the Blues in 1999. On June 17, 2005, the 
Lauries announced that they would sell the team. Bill Laurie, a former 
point guard at Memphis State University, had long desired to buy and move 
a National Basketball Association (NBA) team to St. Louis (coming close 
to achieving this in 1999, with an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the 
then-Vancouver Grizzlies), and it was thought that this desire caused him 
to neglect the Blues. On September 29, 2005, it was announced that the 
Lauries had signed an agreement to sell the Blues to SCP Worldwide, a consulting 
and investment group headed by former Madison Square Garden President Dave 
Checketts. On November 14, 2005, the Blues announced that SCP Worldwide 
had officially withdrawn from negotiations to buy the team. On December 
27, 2005, it was announced that the Blues had signed a letter of intent 
to exclusively negotiate with General Sports and Entertainment, LLC. However, 
after the period of exclusivity, SCP entered the picture again. On March 
24, 2006, the Lauries completed the sale of the Blues and the lease to 
the Savvis Center to SCP and TowerBrook Capital Partners, L.P., a private 
equity firm. The Blues are currently the only team in the four major North 
American sports (ice hockey, basketball, baseball, and American football) 
to be owned by a private equity firm. Following the disappointing 2005–06 
season, which saw the Blues with the worst record in the NHL, the new management 
focused on rebuilding the franchise. Under new management, the Blues promptly 
installed John Davidson as president of hockey operations, moving Pleau 
to a mostly advisory role. The former New York Rangers goaltender promptly 
made multiple blockbuster deals, picking up Jay McKee, Bill Guerin and 
Manny Legace from free agency, and bringing Doug Weight back to St. Louis 
after a brief (and productive) stopover in Carolina. Weight was again traded 
in December 2007 to the Anaheim Ducks, along with a minor league player, 
in exchange for Andy McDonald. At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, 
the Blues looked to be competitive in the Central Division. However, injuries 
plagued the team all season, and the lack of a bona fide scorer hampered 
them as well. Fan support was sluggish during the first half of the campaign, 
and the end of the calendar year was capped by an 11-game losing streak. 
On December 11, 2006, the Blues fired Head Coach Mike Kitchen and replaced 
him with former Los Angeles Kings Head Coach Andy Murray.[5] Davidson also 
installed a strong development program under Head Scout Jarmo Kekalainen, 
using the team's raft of high draft picks in 2006 and 2007 to select highly 
touted prospects such as T. J. Oshie, Erik Johnson and David Perron. On 
January 4, 2007, the Blues had a record of 6–1–3 in their previous ten 
games, which was the best in the NHL during that stretch. Despite a healthy 
24-point jump from the previous season, the strain of playing in a conference 
where seven teams finished with more than 100 points kept them out of the 
playoffs for the second year in a row. Immediately prior to the 2007 NHL 
trade deadline, the Blues traded several key players, including as Bill 
Guerin, Keith Tkachuk and Dennis Wideman, in exchange for draft picks, 
though they later re-signed Tkachuk during the subsequent off-season. Brad 
Boyes, picked up from the Boston Bruins in exchange for Wideman, became 
the fastest Blues player to reach 40 goals since Brett Hull, doing so during 
the 2007–08 season. During the 2007 off-season, the Blues signed free agent 
Paul Kariya to a three-year contract worth $18 million, re-signed defenseman 
Barret Jackman to a one-year contract, lost their captain Dallas Drake 
to the Detroit Red Wings, and traded prospect Carl Soderberg to the Bruins 
in exchange for yet more depth in the goal crease, Hannu Toivonen. On October 
2, 2007, the Blues finalized the season-starting roster, which included 
rookies David Perron, Steven Wagner and Erik Johnson. On October 10, 2007, 
the Blues introduced a new mascot, Louie. Two months later, they traded 
Doug Weight, a 38-year-old four-time All-Star center, to the Anaheim Ducks 
as part of a package to acquire 30-year-old center Andy McDonald. On February 
8, 2008, it was announced that, after going much of the season without 
a captain, defenseman Eric Brewer was chosen as the team's 19th captain.[6] 
The team later traded veteran defenseman Bryce Salvador to the New Jersey 
Devils for enforcer, and St. Louis native, Cam Janssen. He made his debut 
two days later, wearing number 55 against the Phoenix Coyotes. After spending 
the first half of the 2008–09 season at or near the bottom of the Western 
Conference standings, the Blues began to turn things around behind the 
solid goaltending of Chris Mason. After a strong second half run, the Blues 
made the 2009 playoffs on April 10, 2009, after defeating the Columbus 
Blue Jackets 3–1. On April 12, the Blues clinched the sixth seed in the 
West with a 1–0 win against the Colorado Avalanche. For the first time 
in five years (that is, since the lockout), the Blues were in the playoffs. 
They faced the third-seeded Vancouver Canucks in the first round, but despite 
the team's tremendous run to end the season, the Blues would ultimately 
lose the series in a quick four-game sweep. The Blues fired Head Coach 
Andy Murray on January 2, 2010, after a disappointing record (17–17–6, 
40 points), sitting in 12th place in the Conference. Especially galling 
were the frequent blown leads after two periods, and with the worst home 
record (6–13–3) posted in the entire NHL. After his duties as interim coach 
for the rest of the 2009–10 season, Davis Payne was named the 23rd head 
coach in the Blues' history on April 14. Payne was previously the head 
coach of the Blues top minor league affiliate, the Peoria Rivermen of the 
American Hockey League (AHL).[7] On March 17, 2011, it was announced that 
the St. Louis Blues were for sale.[8] During the 2011 NHL off-season, the 
team signed many key free agents, including Brian Elliott, Scott Nichol, 
Kent Huskins, Jason Arnott and Jamie Langenbrunner. They fired their head 
coach, Davis Payne, and named Ken Hitchcock as his replacement on November 
6, 2011. David Backes was also announced as the new team captain. On March 
17, 2012, the Blues became the first team to reach 100 points and clinch 
a playoff berth in the 2011–12 season under Hitchcock, qualifying for their 
first playoffs since 2008–09. They would finish second in the Western Conference, 
behind the Vancouver Canucks. During the 2012 playoffs, they won their 
first playoff series since 2002, eliminating the San Jose Sharks in five 
games. The Blues were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the 
Los Angeles Kings, in the following round. In 2012–13, the Blues completed 
the lockout-shortened season in fourth place in the Western Conference. 
They were again eliminated by Los Angeles, however, this time in six games 
in the first round of the playoffs, despite taking an initial 2–0 series 
lead. The following season, 2013–14, the team hit the 100-point mark for 
the sixth time in franchise history, and gained a franchise record of 52 
wins. Their chance on winning the Central Division title, the top seed 
in the West, and the Presidents' Trophy would all evaporate, after they 
lost their final six games and wound up in second place in the Division, 
this time to the Colorado Avalanche. The slump haunted them, as they blew 
a 2–0 series lead to the defending champion Chicago Blackhawks, losing 
the first round series in six games. This marked the second-straight year 
the Blues lost in the first round of the playoffs to the reigning champions 
in six games after leading the series 2–0. In 2014–15, the Blues won their 
second Central Division championship in four years and faced the Minnesota 
Wild in round one of the 2015 playoffs. However, for the third-straight 
year, they lost in the first round and in six games. In 2015–16, the Blues 
finished in second place in the Central Division to the Dallas Stars. The 
Blues took on the defending champion, once again Chicago Blackhawks in 
the first round series. The Blues had a 3–1 series lead over Chicago, but 
struggled in games 5 and 6. However, St. Louis ended their first round 
losing streak by beating Chicago 3–2 in game 7 of the series. The Blues 
defeated the Dallas Stars in the second round. In the Western Conference 
final, they were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in 6 games. The Blues 
play in the 19,150 (not counting standing room) capacity Scottrade Center, 
where they have played since 1994. The arena was previously known as the 
Savvis Center and before that as the Kiel Center. The team played in the 
St. Louis Arena (known as The Checkerdome from 1977 until 1983), where 
the old St. Louis Eagles played, and which the original owners had to buy 
as a condition of the 1967 NHL expansion. The St. Louis Blues are one of 
the more successful NHL teams in terms of attendance. After the 2004–05 
lockout, the Blues attendance suffered, but has since improved every year 
since its all-time low in 2006–07. In 2009–10, despite not having a playoff 
year, the Blues had an average attendance of 18,883 (98.6% total capacity), 
selling out 34 of its 40 home games, which placed them seventh in the NHL 
in attendance.[9] In 2010–11, the team sold out every home game. Like all 
NHL teams, the Blues updated their jerseys for the 2007–08 season with 
new Rbk Edge jerseys. The Blues simplified their design, with only the 
blue note logo on the front; there were no third jerseys for the season. 
The Blues announced plans for a navy third jersey featuring a new logo, 
with the Gateway Arch with the Blue Note superimposed over it inside a 
circle with the words "St. Louis" above and "Blues" below. This third jersey 
was unveiled on September 21, 2008, and debuted during a Blues' home game 
against the Anaheim Ducks on November 21, 2008.[10] For the 2014–15 season, 
the Blues made a few tweaks to their jerseys. While they kept the Reebok 
Edge-era template, they brought back the 1998–2007 look. The navy blue 
third jersey was kept without any alterations.[11] Louie is the mascot 
of the St. Louis Blues. He was introduced on October 10, 2007. On November 
3, 2007, the fans voted on his name on the Blues' web site.[12] Louie is 
a blue polar bear and wears a Blues jersey with his name on the back, and 
the numbers "00". Piggy Smalls in an unofficial mascot of the St. Louis 
Blues. Piggy Smalls is a pig introduced by captain David Backes after a 
typo on the Blues Twitter page that said #RoarBacon. The hashtag started 
trending on Twitter and the mascot Piggy Smalls was born.[13] Originally, 
the Blues aired their games on KPLR-TV and KMOX radio, with team patron 
Gus Kyle calling games alongside St Louis broadcasting legend Jack Buck. 
Buck elected to leave the booth after one season, though, and was replaced 
by another famed announcer in Dan Kelly. This setup—Kelly as commentator, 
with either Kyle, Bob Plager or Noel Picard (whose heavy French-Canadian 
accent became famous, such as pronouncing owner Sid Salomon III "Sid the 
Turd" instead of "Third") joining as an analyst, simulcast on KMOX and 
KPLR—continued through the 1975–76 season, then simulcast on KMOX and KDNL-TV 
for the next three seasons. KMOX is a 50,000-watt clear-channel station 
that reaches almost all of North America at night, allowing Kelly to become 
a celebrity in both the United States and Canada. Indeed, many of the Blues' 
players liked the fact that their families could hear the games on KMOX. 
From 1979 to 1981, the radio and television broadcasts were separated for 
the first time since the inaugural season, with Kelly doing the radio broadcasts 
and Eli Gold hired to do the television. Following the 1980–81 season, 
the television broadcasts moved from KDNL to NBC affiliate KSD-TV for the 
1981–82 season, produced by Sports Network Incorporated (SNI), owned and 
operated by Greg Maracek who did the broadcasts with Channel 5 sportscaster 
Ron Jacober. The broadcasts failed to produce a profit and then returned 
to KPLR for the 1982 NHL playoffs and the 1982–83 season before returning 
to KDNL (currently St. Louis' ABC affiliate) for the 1983–84 season, the 
first under the ownership of Harry Ornest. The Blues skated back to KPLR 
three years later. In 1985, Ornest, wanting more broadcast revenue, put 
the radio rights up for bid. A new company who had purchased KXOK won the 
bid for a three-year contract and Kelly moved over from KMOX to do the 
games on KXOK. However, the station was never financially competitive in 
the market. Additionally, fans complained they couldn't hear the station 
at night (it had to readjust its coverage due to a glut of clear-channels 
on adjacent frequencies). KXOK backed out of the contract after just two 
years, and the Blues immediately went back to KMOX, who held the rights 
until 2000. Dan Kelly continued to broadcast the games on radio but was 
diagnosed in the summer of 1988 with lung cancer and died on February 10, 
1989. After his death, Ron Jacober (who had left Channel 5 to be KXOK's 
sports director in 1985 then left for KMOX in 1987) finished the season 
as the radio play-by-play announcer and was succeeded in that position 
by John Kelly. Ken Wilson continued the television broadcasts after Kelly's 
death with former Blues' players Joe Micheletti and Bruce Affleck. During 
this time, from 1989 to 2000, more games began to be aired on Prime Sports 
Midwest, the forerunner to today's Fox Sports Midwest (branded FSBLUES 
in games). The long-term partnership between KMOX and the Blues had its 
problems, however, namely during spring when the ever-popular St. Louis 
Cardinals began their season. Blues games, many of which were crucial to 
playoff berths, would often be pre-empted for spring training coverage. 
Angry at having to play "second fiddle", the Blues elected to leave for 
KTRS in 2000. However, in an ironic twist the Cards purchased a controlling 
interest in KTRS in 2005, and once again preferred to air pre-season baseball 
over regular-season hockey. In response, the Blues moved back to KMOX starting 
in the 2006–07 season. The season of 2008–09 saw the Blues play their last 
game on KPLR, which had the rights since the 1986–87 season (except for 
the 1996–97 season on CBS affiliate KMOV), electing to move all their games 
to FS Midwest, starting with the 2009–10 season. The Cardinals moved back 
to KMOX in the 2011 season, restoring the spring conflicts anew, though 
lessened with the rise of Internet radio, of which KMOX is contractually 
obligated to only serve the Cardinals broadcasts via MLB's for-pay radio 
structure, freeing up Blues broadcasts to be carried in some form over 
the station's web stream, which is allowed by the NHL. Currently, Chris 
Kerber and Kelly Chase are the radio broadcast team. John Kelly (son of 
Dan) and Darren Pang handle television coverage, along with Bernie Federko 
(on-ice analyst) and Tony Twist and Pat Parris (pre-game and post-game 
shows). The Blues have a tradition of live organ music. Jeremy Boyer, the 
Blues organist, plays a Glenn Miller arrangement of W. C. Handy's "St. 
Louis Blues" in its entirety before games and a short version at the end 
of every period, followed by "When the Saints Go Marching In." Boyer also 
plays the latter song on the organ after Blues goals, with fans replacing 
the word "Saints" with "Blues." At the end of the national anthem before 
every home game, the words "the home of the brave" is drowned out by fans 
with, "The home of the Blues." The Blues were one of the last teams to 
add a goal horn, doing so during the 1992–93 season at the St. Louis Arena.[citation 
needed] All of these traditions carried over to the Kiel Center (now known 
as Scottrade Center) in 1994. After each goal, a bell is rung and each 
of the goals are counted by the crowd. Since 1990, Ron Baechle, also known 
as the "Towel Man" or "Towel Guy," has celebrated each goal by counting 
with the bell and throwing a towel into the crowd from section 314.[14] 
The team also has a long tradition of fan-produced programs, sold outside 
the arena and providing an often biting, sarcastic, humor-filled alternative 
to team- and League-produced periodicals. The longest-running fan publication, 
Game Night Revue, was created by a group of fans in the mold of the Chicago 
Blackhawks' Blue Line Magazine. It operated for over 10 years, from 1994 
to 2005, when its owner decided not to resume the magazine after the 2004–05 
NHL lockout. (One final oversized "goodbye" issue was distributed the first 
two home games of the 2005–06 season.) After hockey resumed in 2005, a 
few months after GNR’s final issue, a new publication, St. Louis Game Time, 
was formed by several former GNR staffers. This is a partial list of the 
last five seasons completed by the Blues. For the full season-by-season
