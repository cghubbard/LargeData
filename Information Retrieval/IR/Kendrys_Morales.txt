Kendrys Morales Rodriguez (born June 20, 1983) is a Cuban professional 
baseball designated hitter who is a player for the Toronto Blue Jays. He 
has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels of 
Anaheim, Seattle Mariners, Minnesota Twins, and Kansas City Royals. He 
is a switch hitter who throws right-handed. Morales suffered an ankle injury 
on May 29, 2010, during a celebration of his walk-off grand slam, which 
kept him out of Major League Baseball for nearly two years. On April 6, 
2012, Morales returned to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim's line-up for 
the season opener against the Kansas City Royals. Morales has also played 
first base and right field during his MLB career. Morales played in Cuba's 
equivalent of the United States' Triple-A level. With 16- to 17-year-olds 
in the category, he was the first starter of the pitching staff, and fourth 
in the batting order, and had the ability to hit home runs from both sides 
of the plate. Morales joined the Cuban national baseball team in 2002 and 
immediately became a star player—despite being the first teenager to make 
the team in nearly twenty years. He was the cleanup hitter on the team 
during its dramatic 2003 World Cup championship. His grand slam in the 
final round against Taiwan secured a 6–3 Cuban victory, one game after 
hitting a home run that provided the winning runs against Brazil. In his 
first—of two and a half—full season with Havana's Industriales, in 2002, 
Morales had a batting average of .324 with 21 home runs and 82 RBI, and 
pitched in a game during the regular season, setting seven rookie records 
in the process (including HR and RBI); and obviously becoming Rookie of 
the Year, being considered the best rookie in the history of Cuban baseball. 
In his second season he suffered an injury and did not hit as many home 
runs as in his rookie season, but he finished with a .391 batting average. 
Morales' stardom in Cuba was short-lived, however. He was sent back to 
Cuba from Panama during the Olympic qualifying round in November 2003 for 
making contact with an agent. It was the last time he would suit up as 
a Cuban. By early 2004, Cuba's national team and the Industriales banned 
Morales from their teams for disciplinary reasons due to their belief that 
he had met with people in an attempt to flee the nation. Morales denies 
this accusation, telling a reporter "That's not true. I never talked to 
any agent. But from that moment on, I just wanted to leave. I tried to 
do it several times without success, occasionally ending up in jail." He 
escaped on a raft in June 2004 to the shores of southern Florida, his eighth 
attempt at escape.[1] But, as is the usual practice of defectors, he chose 
to leave the country to establish foreign residency so as to avoid the 
MLB draft. He left once again, this time to the Dominican Republic, where 
he was privately scouted by several Major League teams. Preston Gómez, 
in his role as consultant to Angels general manager Bill Stoneman, ended 
up signing him to a six-year deal with three-million dollars up front in 
December 2004. Morales played winter ball for the Estrellas Orientales 
Dominican team to keep himself in game shape.[2] By the spring of 2005, 
the Angels hoped to have Morales practice in the Cactus League to get ready 
for a quick ascension through their farm system or possibly even make the 
team as the designated hitter. Because he was not yet a citizen, the Dominican 
government held up granting Morales the necessary passport to fly back 
to the U.S. for several months. He was not able to get all his paperwork 
in order until late May and he finally made his minor league debut on May 
21 for the Single-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. To help his new club scout 
his ability against U.S. pitching, Morales began his minor league career 
with nearby Rancho Cucamonga. After three weeks of easy hitting (his batting 
average was .344, with 5 home runs), he was moved up to Double-A Arkansas, 
where he was second on the team in home runs despite playing there for 
only half the season. When that season ended, he was chosen by the Angels 
to play fall ball for the Surprise Scorpions. Morales had a strong spring 
training in 2006 for the Angels, but failed to make the 25-man roster. 
He ultimately made his Major League debut on May 23, 2006, playing first 
base and going 3-for-5, including a home run in his second at bat, versus 
the Texas Rangers. Thereafter he performed well enough to be the Angels 
regular first baseman until his eventual demotion back to Triple-A on July 
23, 2006. Morales enjoyed a breakout year in his first full-season. He 
hit 34 home runs and slugged .569, ranking second in the AL, behind eventual 
AL MVP Joe Mauer. Morales was promoted to starting first basemen after 
Mark Teixeira (Angels first baseman for the 2008 season) left the Angels 
as a free agent in the winter of 2008. Morales said of the timing of his 
promotion, "The guys that played ahead of me were seasoned players, and 
I didn't deserve to play in the big leagues yet. The one thing I thought 
about -- not how long I had to wait -- was just to concentrate on playing 
well once that opportunity came."[3] He hit well in the first half, and 
hit extremely well in the second half of 2009, and was named AL Player 
of the Month in August when he drove in 33 runs in 28 games with 10 homers, 
batting .385 and slugging .734. His performance led to talk of him being 
a possible American League MVP,[4] eventually placing 5th in MVP voting 
behind Mauer, Teixeira, Derek Jeter, and Miguel Cabrera.[5] Morales hit 
a walk-off grand slam off Brandon League to end a 10-inning 5–1 victory 
over the Seattle Mariners at Angel Stadium of Anaheim on May 29, 2010. 
Approaching his celebrating teammates, he jumped up with the intention 
of stomping on home plate instead of simply stepping on it. His awkward 
landing resulted in a fracture in his lower left leg, placing him immediately 
on the disabled list. The injury required surgery, and he missed the rest 
of the 2010 season.[6] In 51 games in the 2010 season, Morales hit .290 
with 11 home runs and 39 RBIs. On May 11, 2011, it was announced that Morales, 
still sidelined by his injured ankle from 2010, would miss the whole 2011 
season due to complications in his rehabilitation from surgery on the ankle.[7] 
On March 22, 2012, nearly two years after his ankle injury, Morales returned 
to the lineup in a spring training game against the Kansas City Royals.[8] 
He went 2-3 in his Spring Training return. On April 16, he hit his first 
home run since his 2010 injury. On July 30, 2012, Morales hit two home 
runs in the same inning (once left handed and the other right handed). 
He became only the third player in MLB history to homer both left and right 
in the same inning.[9] He finished the 2012 season with a .273 batting 
average, 22 home runs, and 73 RBI. On December 19, 2012, Morales was traded 
by the Angels to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Jason Vargas.[10] On 
June 23, 2013, Morales hit a first-pitch three run home run in the 10th 
inning against the Oakland Athletics after subbing for Brendan Ryan, leading 
to a 6-3 Mariners win at Safeco Field. After rounding the bases, he gently 
stepped on home plate.[11] On July 2, 2013, he hit two home runs and had 
6 RBIs in a 9-2 win over the division-leading Texas Rangers.[12] On August 
26, 2013, Kendrys Morales was claimed off waivers by an as yet unknown 
team; however, he was not traded within 48 hours of the waiver claim, meaning 
the Mariners pulled him back from waivers.[13] On September 4, Morales 
hit a walk-off two-run homer off the Kansas City Royals to win the game 
6-4 in the ninth inning. It was the only game the Mariners won during the 
four-game series.[14] The Mariners made Morales a qualifying offer after 
the 2013 season, which he rejected.[15] He remained unsigned as of Opening 
Day. On June 8, 2014, Morales agreed to terms with the Minnesota Twins 
on a one-year contract and a prorated portion of $12 million, worth approximately 
$7.4 million.[16] On July 24, 2014, Morales was traded to the Seattle Mariners 
in exchange for pitching prospect Stephen Pryor.[17][18] In December 2014, 
Morales signed a two-year, $17 million contract with the Kansas City Royals.[19] 
In a game at Tropicana Field against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 28, 2015, 
Rays' center fielder Kevin Kiermaier was involved in a failed but humorous 
attempt to rob Morales of a home run. He hit a fly ball which appeared 
to be clearing the center field fence for a home run. Kiermaier leapt and 
momentarily perched himself upright on the top of the fence to catch the 
ball before it landed. However, it dropped approximately 30 feet (9.1 m) 
in front of the fence, and Kiermaier watched it bounce as he clung to the 
fence. The ball had hit one of the catwalks suspended from the roof, and, 
according to park rules, the umpires awarded a home run to Morales.[20] 
Morales finished the 2015 season with 106 RBIs, his highest since his 2009 
season with the Angels.[21] On September 20, 2015, Morales hit three home 
runs (which tied a Royals record), and had 15 total bases (which set a 
Royals record) in a 10-3 Royals win over the Detroit Tigers. Interestingly, 
Morales only had 3 RBI and had nobody on base all 5 times he came up to 
bat. He went 4-4 with 3 homers, a triple, and a walk. On October 14, in 
the winner-take-all game 5 of the American League Divisional Series against 
the Houston Astros, Morales hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning 
to secure a 7-2 Royals win.[22] Hitting .295 with 22 home runs, 106 RBIs, 
and 39 doubles, Morales was named the recipient of the 2015 Edgar Martínez 
Award, an honor presented annually to the most outstanding designated hitter 
in the American League.[23] After coming of his great 2015 campaign, Morales 
struggled at the start of 2016. Before June, he boasted a .193 average. 
After getting a 4-game break to regather himself mentally, Morales finished 
June with a .262 average and the Royals homerun leader on the season. On 
November 4, Morales declined his option with the Royals and became a free 
agent.[24] On November 11, 2016, it was announced Morales signed a three-year, 
$33 million deal with the Toronto Blue Jays.[25] Morales has a wife, Yarley, 
and three children: Hanely, Kendrys Jr. and the oldest, Andrea.[26] Until 
March 2011, MLB mistakenly spelled Morales' first name "Kendry."[27][28]
