[10] [11] [12] On Mickey Mantle Day, June 8, 1969, in addition to the retirement 
of his uniform number 7, Mantle was given a plaque that would hang on the 
center field wall at Yankee Stadium, near the monuments to Babe Ruth, Lou 
Gehrig and Miller Huggins. The plaque was given to him by Joe DiMaggio, 
and Mantle then gave DiMaggio a similar plaque, telling the crowd, "His 
should be just a little bit higher than mine." Infielders Other batters
