Mike Shildt is an American baseball coach and manager and, as of 2012, 
the manager of the Springfield Cardinals minor league baseball team, the

head field coordinator of the Cardinals Minor League system compared Shildt 
to former Cardinals executive and King of Baseball recipient George Kissell.[1] 
Shildt played college baseball for University of North Carolina (UNC) Asheville 
Bulldogs.[2] After his playing career ended as he "couldn't hit a curve 
ball", Scildt became a coach at West Charlotte High School,[3] his high-school 
alma mater.[2] After leaving the high school, Shildt was hired by the UNC 
Charlotte to become an assistant coach for the UNC Charlotte 49ers baseball 
team.[2][3] He held the position for five years.[2] During the off-season 
he owned a baseball training facility in North Carolina, becoming a full-time 
baseball instructor to area youths.[2] Shildt started his Major League 
Baseball career as an associate scout with the league for three seasons.[2] 
He moved on to the Cardinals organization, working as the area scout for 
North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.[2] On a recommendation from 
future Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak, Shildt began his minor 
league coaching career as a part-time coach. Shildt was sent to the Cardinals' 
Single-A affiliate in the New York–Penn League. He was a part-time coach 
during 2004 and 2005, while continuing his scouting duties.[2] He was promoted 
to a full-time coaching position in 2006, and kept coaching with the single 
A affiliate until the 2007 season.[2] In 2008, Shildt coordinated the Cardinals' 
minor league spring training workout camp.[4] Afterwards he became the 
hitting coach for the Johnson City Cardinals for the 2008 season.[4] Shildt 
was promoted to manage Johnson City in 2009, where he finished with a 37–30 
record.[5] In his second season, Johnson City posted a 42–24 win-loss record, 
and after defeating its two playoff opponents, won the Appalachian League 
championship.[1] For his effort, Shildt was named St. Louis Cardinals Minor 
League Manager of the Year by Scout.com.[1] He was also named the starting 
manager in the Appalachian League All-Star game.[1] Among the players he 
helped improve during the season include Appalachian League's Pitcher of 
the Year Ryan Copeland, and batting average champion Phil Cerreto.[1] After 
Johnson City's season ended, Shildt was invited to spend some time on the 
St. Louis Cardinals roster in order to gain experience.[1] After the season, 
Shildt was awarded the Appalachian League Manager of the Year award, and 
the George Kissell Award for his "excellence in player development" by 
the St. Louis Cardinals organization.[6] Johnson City repeated as league 
champions in 2011 under Shildt.[7] It was the first time that Johnson City
