Jerry Reuss (born June 19, 1949)—pronounced "royce"—is a former left-handed 
pitcher in Major League Baseball, best known for his years with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers, who had a 22-year career from 1969 to 1990. Reuss played 
for eight teams in his major league career; along with the Dodgers (1979–87), 
he played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1969–71), Houston Astros (1972–73), 
and Pittsburgh Pirates (1974–78). At the end of his career (1987–90), he 
played for the Cincinnati Reds, California Angels, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee 
Brewers, and the Pirates again (Reuss is one of only two Pirates to have 
played for Danny Murtaugh, Chuck Tanner, and Jim Leyland, the other being 
John Candelaria). In 1988 he became the second pitcher in history, joining 
Milt Pappas, to win 200 career games without ever winning 20 in a single 
season.[1] He was one of only 29 players in major league history to play 
in four different decades.[2] Reuss was drafted in the second round of 
the 1967 Major League Baseball draft by the Cardinals after graduating 
from Ritenour High School in Overland, Missouri. He won his first major 
league game in 1969, and became part of the starting rotation in 1970.[3] 
In the spring of 1972, Reuss wanted a raise from $17,000 to $25,000 Cardinals 
owner Gussie Busch was unwilling to give more than $20,000, and when Reuss 
refused to bend, Busch traded him to the Astros for pitcher Scipio Spinks. 
The trade looked like a fairly even swap at the time. While Spinks had 
shuttled between Houston and their top minor league affiliate, the Oklahoma 
City 89ers, over the last three years, he had been almost unhittable during 
his minor league stints. However, Spinks never recovered from a freak knee 
injury suffered that July, and was out of baseball by 1976. Reuss played 
two seasons before being traded to the Pirates after the 1973 season for 
Milt May after a season in which he led the National League in walks with 
117.[4] Reuss was a two time All-Star – first in 1975 with the Pirates, 
having 18 wins and 11 losses that season and an earned run average of 2.54, 
and then again in 1980 with the Dodgers, striking out all three batters 
he faced in that year's game, and earning the win.[4][5] In 1980 Reuss 
had one of the best seasons of his career with eighteen wins and only six 
losses, and leading the majors in shutouts with six; he also threw a no-hitter 
against the San Francisco Giants on June 27, striking out only 2 batters, 
narrowly missing a perfect game due to a throwing error in the first inning 
by shortstop Bill Russell.[6] Reuss finished second behind Steve Carlton 
in the running for the Cy Young Award, and won Sporting News Comeback Player 
of the Year Award.[7][8] In 1981 Reuss went 10-4 with a career-low 2.30 
ERA in a strike-shortened season, and won two postseason games including 
one against the New York Yankees in the 1981 World Series, helping the 
Dodgers win the title.[4] On June 11, 1982, Jerry Reuss recorded 27 consecutive 
outs in a game, with only the opponent's leadoff batter reaching base (double 
by Reds' Eddie Milner, who reached third on a sacrifice bunt and scored 
on a fielder's choice).[9] Reuss had two more winning seasons with the 
Dodgers before injuries took their toll from 1984 to 1986, and was released 
at the beginning of the 1987 season. He then played for the Reds, going 
0-5 before getting released again, and then for the Angels before becoming 
a free agent. Reuss then signed with the Chicago White Sox, having a 13-9 
season and earning his 200th career win in 1988, and played a few more 
seasons before retiring in 1990.[4] Reuss became a baseball broadcaster, 
working nationally for ESPN from 1991 to 1993, and was also a color commentator 
for the California/Anaheim Angels from 1996-98. He served as a pitching 
coach with the minor league Iowa Cubs before returning to broadcasting 
with the Dodgers in 2006, serving as a color commentator alongside Rick 
Monday. In 2014, Reuss's autobiography, Bring In the Right Hander!, was
