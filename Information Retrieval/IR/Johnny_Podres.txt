John Joseph "Johnny" Podres (September 30, 1932 – January 13, 2008) was 
an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who spent most 
of his career with the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers. He is perhaps best 
remembered for being named the Most Valuable Player of the 1955 World Series, 
pitching a shutout in Game 7 against the New York Yankees to help bring 
the Dodgers their only World Series title in Brooklyn before their move 
to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. He later led the National League 
in earned run average and shutouts in 1957, and in winning percentage in 
1961. He was of Lithuanian-Polish descent.[1][2] Podres helped the Dodgers 
win World Series championships in 1955, 1959, 1963 and 1965, although he 
did not pitch in the 1965 World Series itself.[3][4] In the 1955 series, 
after the Dodgers lost the first two games to the New York Yankees, Podres 
pitched a complete game, seven-hit victory on his 23rd birthday in Game 
3. In the climactic Game 7, Podres pitched a 2–0 shutout to bring Brooklyn 
its only World Series championship. Podres was given the first-ever World 
Series MVP Award by Sport magazine and presented with a red two-seater 
Corvette. Later he was honored as the Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated 
magazine. In his 15-season career, Podres compiled a 148–116 record with 
1435 strikeouts, a 3.68 ERA, and 24 shutouts in 440 games. He was at his 
best in the World Series, losing his first Series game (in 1953), then 
winning four straight decisions over the next decade. In six Series games, 
he allowed only 29 hits in 38⅓ innings, with a 2.11 ERA. When his playing 
career ended after stints with the Detroit Tigers and San Diego Padres, 
Podres served as the pitching coach for the Padres, Boston Red Sox, Minnesota 
Twins and Philadelphia Phillies for 23 seasons between 1973 and 1996. Among 
the pitchers he worked with were Frank Viola and Curt Schilling.[5] In 
2002, Johnny Podres was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports 
Hall of Fame.[6] He later settled in Queensbury, New York and died at age 
75 in Glens Falls, New York, after being hospitalized for heart and kidney 
ailments and a leg infection.[5] Podres was survived by his wife of 41 
years, the former Joni Taylor of Ice Follies fame, and his two sons, Joe 
and John Jr. He is interred at Saints Peter and Paul Cemetery in Moriah,
