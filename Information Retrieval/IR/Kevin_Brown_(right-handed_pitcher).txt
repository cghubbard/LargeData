James Kevin Brown (born March 14, 1965) is a former Major League Baseball 
right-handed pitcher. He played from 1986 to 2005, leading the American 
League in wins once and leading the National League in earned run average 
twice. He was also a six-time All-Star. Brown attended Wilkinson County 
High School in Irwinton, Georgia and was a student and a letterman in football, 
baseball, and tennis. Brown played three years of collegiate baseball at 
Georgia Tech for their baseball team. In 1986, Brown was drafted by the 
Texas Rangers in the first round (fourth pick overall). Starting in 1989, 
Brown was second in the Rangers' rotation behind ace Nolan Ryan and posted 
a 12–9 record with a 3.35 ERA and 104 strikeouts in 1989 and a 12–10 record 
with a 3.60 ERA and 88 strikeouts in 1990. By 1992, Brown had improved 
his record with the Rangers to a 21–11 with 173 strikeouts and a 3.32 ERA, 
was tied for the league lead in victories and was the first since Ferguson 
Jenkins in 1974 to win 20 games in a Ranger uniform.[1] Brown became a 
free agent following the strike settlement in 1994 and signed with the 
Baltimore Orioles for a season, posting a 10–9 record with 117 strikeouts 
and a 3.60 ERA. Following the 1995 season, Brown again became a free agent, 
signing with the Florida Marlins. In his first season with the Marlins, 
Brown posted a 17–11 record with 159 strikeouts and an MLB best 1.89 ERA, 
finishing second in the Cy Young Award voting. In 1997, Brown threw a one-hitter 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers in his first appearance and a no-hitter 
against the San Francisco Giants on June 10, 1997. The only baserunner 
in the game for the Giants came via a HBP with two outs and two strikes 
in the eighth inning. In the 1997 National League Championship Series, 
Brown, riddled with the flu, proceeded to pitch a complete game in Game 
Six, defeating the Atlanta Braves and helping the Marlins reach the World 
Series, which they eventually won over the Cleveland Indians. Following 
the disassembly of the Marlins' championship team, Brown was traded to 
the San Diego Padres for Derrek Lee and prospects, where he pitched one 
season. He posted an 18–7 record with a career-high 257 strikeouts and 
a 2.38 ERA, finishing third in the Cy Young Award voting. Masterful during 
the National League Division Series against the Houston Astros,[2] San 
Diego won both of Brown's starts by a 2–1 score.[3] As the Game 1 starter 
opposing Randy Johnson, he allowed no runs in eight innings and struck 
out 16 Astros, a career-high, and second to that point in MLB playoff history 
only to Bob Gibson's 17-strikeout performance in the 1968 World Series.[4] 
He helped to lead the Padres to the World Series, but not before blowing 
a save in Game 5 of the NLCS during a rare relief appearance. The Padres 
would then lose to the New York Yankees in the 1998 World Series in a four-game 
sweep. Kevin Brown's tenure with the Padres during the 1998 season was 
somewhat marred when the San Diego fans chose to cheer slugger Sammy Sosa 
during his home run chase along with Mark McGwire. Frustrated by the fact 
that the Padres were trying to win games during a pennant race, Kevin Brown 
insulted San Diego fans to the media. Following the 1998 season, Brown 
again became a free agent. He signed a lucrative contract with the Los 
Angeles Dodgers for 7 years/$105 million USD, becoming the first $100 million 
man in baseball. Many fans, both in San Diego and nationally, were taken 
aback by the immensity of the contract given to a player in his mid 30's 
(almost $40 million more than the Padres offer, the next highest offer 
he received), and also the choice of team, given Brown expressed a desire 
to play in a city closer to his Georgia home than San Diego during the 
season. Enrique Rojas of ESPN Deportes called the contract "one of the 
worst deals ever from a team's point of view" because Brown averaged only 
nine wins per season and was frequently injured during the seven years 
of the deal. That contract is currently listed as the 82nd largest in the 
history of sports tied with NBA Star Juwan Howard.[5] His first season 
in Los Angeles, he posted an 18–9 record with 221 strikeouts and a 3.00 
ERA. After leading the NL in ERA during an injury-plagued 2000 season, 
his performance began to dwindle as Brown was hampered by injuries and 
poor run support. In 2003, Brown rebounded, producing a respectable 14–9 
record with 185 strikeouts and a 2.39 ERA, although LA Times sportswriter 
Bill Plaschke noted following the release of the Mitchell Report "(his 
numbers that year are) no longer believe(able)."[6] On December 11, 2003, 
Brown was traded to the New York Yankees as part of a deal that sent Jeff 
Weaver, Yhency Brazobán, Brandon Weeden, and $2.6 million in cash to Los 
Angeles. He went on a 10–6 record with a 4.09 ERA, but experienced health 
problems during the season. Toward the end of the season, he punched a 
wall in frustration,[7] injuring his hand. He did pitch well in the Division 
Series, but it was his performance in Game 7 of the 2004 American League 
Championship Series that he is remembered for, lasting less than two innings 
while giving up five earned runs, including a two-run homer to David Ortiz. 
Brown would attempt to come back in 2005, but missed several games during 
the season due to injury. He would go 4–7 with a 6.50 ERA. On February 
20, 2006, Brown announced his retirement.[8] The Mitchell Report named 
Brown as one of a group of Los Angeles Dodgers implicated in steroid use. 
The report documents allegations by Kirk Radomski that he sold Brown human 
growth hormone and Deca-Durabolin over a period of two or three years beginning 
in either 2000 or 2001. Radomski claims he was introduced to Brown by Paul 
Lo Duca. Radomski's claims were supported by an Express Mail receipt dated 
June 7, 2004, addressed to Brown. The report also contains notes from a 
meeting of Dodgers executives in 2003 during which they question the medication 
Brown takes and include a note stating "Steroids speculated by GM". Brown 
declined to meet with the Mitchell investigators.[9] Plaschke states that 
by 2003 "it was obvious to me...(and) Dodger management that...(he was) 
probably on steroids. We would even talk about it while watching their 
bulging, straining bodies from the dugout during batting practice. But 
the players would admit nothing, so there was nothing I could write.".[10] 
Brown's temper tantrums, he notes, may have in fact been "'roid rage." 
Brown was a pitcher who had the rare talent of relying both on movement 
and velocity. His main pitch was a sinking fastball that averaged 91–96 mph, 
with tremendous tailing, downward movement. He could spot it to either 
side of the plate. Batters facing him generally pounded this pitch into 
the ground or missed it entirely. He complemented this pitch with a sharp 
slider in the high 80s, and a solid split fingered fastball he used against 
left-handed hitters or for another look.[11] Over his career, Brown won 
211 games and finished his career with a 127 ERA+ (27% better than the 
league-wide earned run average). Only seven pitchers have won between 200 
and 220 wins with an ERA+ between 120 and 135.[12] Of those seven, Stan 
Coveleski (215 wins, 128 ERA+), John Smoltz (213/125), Don Drysdale (209/121), 
and Hal Newhouser (207/130) are in the Baseball Hall of Fame, and Curt 
Schilling is a probable future inductee. Only Eddie Cicotte (209/123) of 
Black Sox infamy has been excluded. In 2006, a neighbor accused Brown of 
pulling a gun on him after Brown accused the neighbor of putting yard debris 
on his side of the yard.[13] He is currently an assistant baseball coach 
at Tattnall Square academy.[14] In 16 major league seasons, Brown made 
over $130 million.[15] He currently resides in Macon, Georgia with his
