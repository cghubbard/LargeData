The 1941 New York Yankees season was the 39th season for the team in New 
York, and its 41st season overall. The team finished with a record of 101â€“54, 
winning their 12th pennant, finishing 17 games ahead of the Boston Red 
Sox. New York was managed by Joe McCarthy. The Yankees played their home 
games at Yankee Stadium. In the World Series, they beat the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 5 games. Books and songs have been written about the 1941 season, the 
last before the United States became drawn into World War II. Yankees' 
center fielder Joe DiMaggio captured the nation's fancy with his lengthy 
hitting streak that extended through 56 games before finally being stopped. 
A big-band style song called Joltin' Joe DiMaggio was a hit for the Les 
Brown orchestra. During the hitting streak, DiMaggio had a batting average 
of .408, hit 15 home runs, and accumulated 55 runs batted in. After the 
streak ended, DiMaggio began a 16-game hitting streak. DiMaggio would hit 
safely in 72 of 73 games, another record.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
