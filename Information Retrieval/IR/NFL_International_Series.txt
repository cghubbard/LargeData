Since the 2007 season, the National Football League (NFL) has hosted regular 
season American football games outside of the United States every year 
in a series known as the NFL International Series. To date, all of the 
games in the International Series have been held in London, England. Wembley 
Stadium was the exclusive home stadium for International Series games from 
2007 to 2015 and will continue to host NFL games through at least 2020; 
beginning in 2016, the series will begin expanding to more stadia, first 
to Twickenham Stadium, London (2016–18) and to Estadio Azteca, Mexico City, 
Mexico (2016–) and eventually to the still under construction new stadium 
at Northumberland Park also in London (2018–27).[1][2] Prior to 2005, the 
NFL's primary method of promoting its game abroad was through the American 
Bowl, a series of preseason games played around the world, and NFL Europe, 
a developmental league based in Europe. The American Bowls ended in 2005 
(though a similar China Bowl was planned for 2007 before being cancelled), 
while NFL Europa (as it was known for its final season) folded in 2007. 
On October 2, 2005, the Arizona Cardinals defeated the San Francisco 49ers 
by a score of 31–14 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico under the 
name NFL Fútbol Americano. It was the first regular season NFL game held 
outside of the United States.[3] The game drew the NFL's highest game attendance 
at the time with 103,467 spectators.[3][4] Roger Goodell, the commissioner 
of the National Football League, has considered expanding the league's 
appeal overseas ever since the end of NFL Europa. Goodell has openly discussed 
the idea of holding a future Super Bowl game in London.[3] The NFL also 
investigated the possibility of adding a 17th regular season game to all 
teams, taking the place of the fourth pre-season game.[5] Waller notes 
that there will not be 16 different venues for the 17th games. More likely 
would be a "mini-season ticket" of perhaps four games in one city or country.[5] 
There was discussion that this "17th game" could take effect as early as 
the 2009 NFL season; however, 2010 would be the earliest this could be 
implemented because of concerns about playing on Labor Day or over the 
2010 Winter Olympics, the league's rigid scheduling formula, and the league's 
collective bargaining agreement (CBA).[5] League officials were pondering 
moving a second existing game abroad for the 2010 season, but eventually 
abandoned it due to the ongoing CBA negotiations.[6] The league eventually 
abandoned their desire to expand the NFL season in the CBA negotiations, 
and the new CBA enacted in 2011 keeps the NFL schedule at 16 games. Games 
in the United Kingdom are broadcast by the BBC and Sky Sports either live 
on BBC2 or online via the BBC Sports website and interactive TV and on 
Sky Sports 3. On radio, the games are broadcast by BBC Radio 5 Live Sports 
Extra, with Arlo White commentating. Typically, one of the games in the 
UK is played on the last weekend of October and/or the same weekend as 
Major League Baseball's World Series (although in 2009, this was not the 
case because the World Series played one week later than usual). Games 
are normally played at 1:00 p.m. or 9:30 a.m ET to account for time zone 
differences; also, on the last Sunday in October, daylight saving time 
ends in Europe, one week earlier than it ends in the United States. Because 
of this, a game in London with a 1:00 pm EDT kickoff would begin at 5:00 pm 
local time instead of 6:00 pm. Games played in Canada or Mexico would not 
be subject to these restrictions because they are in the same time zones 
as the United States. Through 2013, all but one of the games (the 2011 
contest being the exception) featured a team from each conference. The 
games have been popular, with tickets for the two games per season selling 
out in two days, nine months in advance. According to the NFL, only 3% 
of those attending the London games are Americans or American expatriates, 
while 22% are from London and 60% from elsewhere in Britain. Ticket prices 
are from £35 for end zone seats to £100 for lower sideline seats.[7] A 
team that plays a home game in London sells a cheaper season ticket package 
for its own stadium with seven regular season games rather than the usual 
eight. Each designated home team receives US$1 million for giving up the 
home game.[8] On October 11, 2011, the NFL owners approved playing NFL 
games in Great Britain through the year 2016. This stated that a home team 
could visit every year for up to five years but visitors could only visit 
once every five years.[9] This would mean that under the current agreement, 
San Francisco, New England, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Miami and Detroit would 
not be able to return as visitors but may return as the home team. However, 
in 2015 the Detroit Lions will return to London as visitors in an apparent 
disregard for this rule. The Buffalo Bills received a unanimous vote of 
approval to play a series of regular and preseason games at Rogers Centre 
in Toronto from 2008 to 2017,[10][11] This was separate from the regular 
International Series as arrangements are made by the team as opposed to 
the league as with the International Series. The Bills' International Series 
was mutually terminated after the 2013 contest. The Miami Dolphins hosted 
the New York Giants at Wembley Stadium in London, England on October 28, 
2007. The Giants defeated the Dolphins 13–10 in the first regular season 
NFL game held outside of North America. The first 40,000 tickets sold out 
for the game in the first 90 minutes of sales.[3][12] Being that the Giants 
were the designated away team, the game aired on Fox, but it was not available 
nationwide in the United States. Portions of the midwestern and Rocky Mountain 
areas of the United States did not get to see the game on television, as 
they were shown a regional game.[13] Thom Brennaman, Daryl Johnston, and 
Tony Siragusa were assigned to call the game.[14] The New Orleans Saints 
hosted the San Diego Chargers at Wembley Stadium on October 26, 2008. The 
game ended with New Orleans winning, 37–32.[15] Like the 2007 game, this 
matchup was not seen nationally, having only regional coverage on CBS. 
However, Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, the network's top announcing team, were 
assigned to the game, and opening ceremonies were carried live before cutting 
away to local games. The New England Patriots defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
35–7 at Wembley Stadium on October 25, 2009. The game was televised regionally 
in the United States by CBS and on Sky Sports and BBC One in the United 
Kingdom. CBS broadcasters Jim Nantz and Phil Simms were again assigned 
to the game. Simms noted during the opening of the game that "the fans 
in London came up to him and said they were more excited about this game 
than the previous two." It is most notably because the New England Patriots 
have a massive fan base in the United Kingdom and the fact that quarterback 
Tom Brady was the center of attention by the British media from the moment 
the Patriots arrived in London, more than the designated "home" team the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whose owner, Malcolm Glazer, also owns Manchester 
United.[16] On October 31, 2010, the game was again played at London's 
Wembley Stadium. The San Francisco 49ers won 24–16 over the Denver Broncos.[17] 
The weather, like the first 2007 NFL International Series game between 
the Dolphins and the Giants, was rainy throughout the day (but went on 
to clear up as the game itself approached). The game itself was a slow 
burner until the final period when it exploded into life. With Denver looking 
to steal the 'away' win, the 49ers, led by Troy Smith went on to take a 
24–10 lead late in the game and went on to take the win 24–16. As an AFC 
team (Denver) was the visiting team, the game was once again carried on 
CBS, but with their number two announcing team of Greg Gumbel and Dan Dierdorf. 
The 2011 International Series game featured the Chicago Bears facing the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Wembley Stadium on October 23, with the Buccaneers 
serving as the home team. Had the NFL lockout not been resolved by August 
1, it would have reverted to Tampa Bay's Raymond James Stadium; the lockout 
was lifted on July 25, allowing the game to go forward.[18] The game was 
the first in the International Series to feature two teams from the same 
conference (the NFC); a similar break from tradition was planned for the 
ultimately canceled Hall of Fame Game that year, which would have also 
featured the Bears.[19] No reason was given for the change in either game. 
As this was an NFC away game, the game was televised on Fox, with their 
number two announcing team of Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston, and Tony Siragusa. 
The Bears dominated the first half thanks to Matt Forté's early touchdown 
in the game. Tampa Bay struck back by forcing a safety on Forté, as well 
as an attempted second half comeback, but Tampa Bay's hopes of winning 
were dashed when Bucs quarterback Josh Freeman threw a game-ending interception 
to Bears cornerback DJ Moore, sealing a Bears 24–18 victory.[20] On January 
20, 2012, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that from 2012 to 2014, 
the St. Louis Rams would play one of its eight home games each year at 
Wembley Stadium.[21] The first of those games was on Sunday, October 28, 
2012, against one of their interconference opponents, the New England Patriots. 
However, on August 13, 2012, the team announced that they would not play 
the proposed games in London in 2013 and 2014.[22] Goodell had previously 
proposed the use of certain regular teams in the International Series in 
an effort to build a fan base for those teams, raising the prospect of 
a permanent NFL team on the British Isles. CBS aired the game, assigning 
their top announcing team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. The Patriots eventually 
won the game 45–7 in front of 84,004 fans.[23][24][25] An NFL bid to become 
anchor tenants of London's Olympic Stadium failed.[26] The Jacksonville 
Jaguars agreed to play a home game in London for four seasons from 2013 
through 2016. Jacksonville will replace the St. Louis Rams, who backed 
out of a deal to play there in 2013 and 2014. With this announcement also 
came news that the NFL were working to schedule another UK game from 2013 
onwards.[27] (The Jaguars later extended their agreement with Wembley Stadium 
through 2020 in an agreement announced in October 2015.)[2] On October 
11, 2012, it was announced that the Jaguars were to face the San Francisco 
49ers on October 27, 2013.[28] This was the 49ers second game in London 
(after the 2010 London game against the Denver Broncos) and third internationally 
(after the 2005 Fútbol Americano game against the Arizona Cardinals in 
Mexico City). The San Francisco–Jacksonville game was aired on Fox, but 
with one of their lower-tier announcing teams: Chris Myers and Tim Ryan. 
The 49ers ended up defeating the Jaguars 42–10. On October 14, 2012, ESPN 
leaked a rumor the Minnesota Vikings would also play a home game in London 
during the 2013 season, which will be the first time two games were played 
internationally in a season.[29] The Vikings later confirmed this and confirmed 
that the official announcement and details were due to be made at the NFL 
owners' meeting in Chicago on October 16.[30] At this meeting, it was revealed 
that the Vikings would play the Pittsburgh Steelers in London on September 
29, 2013.[31] CBS once again assigned their top announcing team of Jim 
Nantz and Phil Simms to call the game. The Vikings defeated the Steelers 
34–27.[32] The NFL announced two additional games for the 2014 season, 
with the Oakland Raiders hosting the Miami Dolphins on September 28 and 
the Atlanta Falcons hosting the Detroit Lions on October 26 in addition 
to the Jacksonville Jaguars' home game which was to be played against the 
Dallas Cowboys on November 9. This was the second of four scheduled Jacksonville 
Jaguars matches between 2013 and 2016.[33][34][35][36] On December 4, 2013, 
the NFL announced that the Detroit–Atlanta game would start at 9:30 am. 
ET (1:30 p.m. local time), the first time in league history that a game 
has started that early in the morning in the U.S.[37] This would thus provide 
a quadruple-header on an NFL Sunday rather than the normal three windows 
(the 1:00 p.m. early slot, the 4:05 or 4:25 p.m. late afternoon slot, and 
Sunday Night Football). It was announced on November 6, 2014 via British 
TV channel Sky Sports News HQ that three games would be played at Wembley 
Stadium again in 2015. On October 4, the Miami Dolphins hosted the New 
York Jets. On October 25, the Jacksonville Jaguars hosted the Buffalo Bills 
and on November 1, the Kansas City Chiefs hosted the Detroit Lions on the 
Lions' second consecutive visit to London. The Jets-Dolphins game marked 
the first time a divisional game has taken place at Wembley as both teams 
play in the AFC East. 2015 was also the first year in which games have 
taken place in back-to-back weeks.[38] On January 11, 2015 it was confirmed 
that kick off for both the Jets-Dolphins and Bills-Jaguars games was to 
be 9:30 am. EDT, once again creating a four-game NFL Sunday. The Jets-Dolphins 
game kicked off at 2:30 BST and Bills-Jaguars kicked off at 1:30 p.m GMT 
(Daylight savings time ends a week earlier in Europe than it does in North 
America). Both AFC games were aired by CBS in the U.S., with Jets-Dolphins 
a national game, and Bills-Jaguars being designated regional.[39] On March 
23, 2015, the league announced from its annual owners' meetings that the 
Bills-Jaguars game would be the first NFL game broadcast on a worldwide 
digital platform, as the game would be simulcast on the Yahoo! website 
in addition to television markets designated to carry the game on CBS.[40][41] 
On January 23, Detroit-Kansas City was also announced as a 9:30 am. EST 
kick off meaning this game will kick off at 2:30 pm. GMT. Between 2018 
and 2027, at least two games each year will be played at Tottenham Hotspur's 
new stadium in Northumberland Park as part of an agreement between the 
NFL and Tottenham Hotspur. On October 7, 2015, the league announced that 
a resolution had been passed to schedule international games at additional 
locations to London until 2025.[42] On October 22, 2015 it was confirmed 
that at least two games per year will remain at Wembley until at least 
2020 and that the Jacksonville Jaguars will continue to play a home game 
there annually throughout the agreement.[43] Subsequent to this, on November 
3, 2015, the NFL announced that it had reached an agreement with England's 
Rugby Football Union to host regular season games at Twickenham Stadium 
from 2016 onwards, with a minimum of three, and as many as five games to 
be held over the initial agreement period of three years.[44] This means 
that by 2018 a minimum of five games will be held in London at at least 
three venues, (Wembley Stadium, Twickenham Stadium, and Spurs' new stadium 
in Northumberland Park). Matchups for London in 2016 were announced on 
November 25, 2015, via Sky Sports News HQ. On October 2, the Jacksonville 
Jaguars hosted the Indianapolis Colts at Wembley Stadium. On October 23, 
the Los Angeles Rams hosted the New York Giants at Twickenham Stadium, 
and finally, on October 30, the Cincinnati Bengals hosted the Washington 
Redskins at Wembley Stadium. As was the case in 2015, all three games were 
played at 9:30 a.m. ET (1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. local time). This marks 
the first time a west-coast team will play an early-morning game, as kickoff 
will be at 6:30 a.m. in the Rams' home market. It was the first time that 
an International Series game was aired on NFL Network, although due to 
broadcasting mandates on the teams' home markets, WCBS-TV and KCBS-TV aired 
the game at the Giants' and Rams' home markets, respectively. On February 
5, 2016, it was also announced that the Oakland Raiders will host the Houston 
Texans on Monday, November 21, 2016 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, Mexico. 
This will be the first time Monday Night Football has been held outside 
the US, and the second time ESPN broadcasts a game abroad after the 2005 
Fútbol Americano game (also in Mexico City at the defunct ESPN Sunday Night 
Football slot) and the first NFL International Series game in Mexico.[45][46] 
Previously, the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers had expressed interest 
in playing a game at Estadio Azteca (or possibly Estadio Olímpico Universitario) 
in Mexico City although Houston was not prepared to give up a home fixture.[47][48] 
The game between the Redskins and the Bengals was the first International 
Series game to go into overtime, the first to end as a tie and had the 
highest attendance of all International Series games to date. It was announced 
on October 30, 2016 that the Miami Dolphins would host the New Orleans 
Saints in London in 2017. No stadium or date has yet been announced. As 
of the 2017 season, 8 of the 32 teams have not played in the International 
Series: Arizona Cardinals, Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, Cleveland 
Browns, Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles, Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee 
Titans. The Jacksonville Jaguars have played four international games, 
the most of any team, and are scheduled to play at least one international 
game every season through 2020. The Miami Dolphins will play their fourth 
game in the 2017 season. Before the Chargers and Saints were announced 
to be the two teams headed to London in 2008, the Kansas City Chiefs, Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks were identified as teams interested 
in playing a future game in Europe.[60] In particular, Seattle, which had 
been slated to play the China Bowl before that game was cancelled, had 
shown a continued interest in playing a game abroad. Tampa Bay eventually 
got the 2009 and 2011 games, while Kansas City got one of the games in 
2015. Both the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins have similarly expressed 
interest in returning to the UK in a rematch of 2007's international series.[citation 
needed] There have also been negotiations between the Pittsburgh Steelers 
(whose owner, Dan Rooney, was the United States Ambassador to Ireland) 
and Croke Park in Dublin, Republic of Ireland for a potential International 
Series game there.[61] The Rams and the Buccaneers are both under co-ownership 
with teams in the Premier League, the top association football league in 
England; the Rams are under co-ownership with Arsenal Football Club of 
London, while the Buccaneers are co-owned with Manchester United. From 
2006 until 2012, the Cleveland Browns were also under co-ownership with 
Aston Villa before Randy Lerner sold the Browns to Jimmy Haslam, and since 
2013, Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan also owns Fulham F.C., which 
were at the time in the Premier League, but have since been relegated to 
the Football League Championship.[62] As part of their application to relocate 
to Los Angeles for the 2016 season, the Rams have volunteered to play in 
the International Series at least once a year while occupying the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum for three seasons until their new stadium in Inglewood, 
California, opens in 2019.[63] In 2016, Steelers president Art Rooney II 
stated that the team may have to give up a home game to play in Mexico 
City in the future, with the team stating that they would require permission 
from the Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County 
to do so, as their lease at Heinz Field explicitly requires the team to 
play ten home games (8 in the regular season, 2 preseason) at that stadium 
per season. [64][65] Within the United Kingdom, aside from London, potential 
candidates for hosting NFL games include Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, 
Wales;[66] and Murrayfield in Edinburgh, Scotland.[67] Other prime locations 
to get games would be Croke Park in the Republic of Ireland (Ireland has 
already hosted the NCAA Emerald Isle Classic, a college football game similar 
to the International Series, and Steelers owner Dan Rooney was once an 
ambassador to the country); Germany; Mexico; and Canada (Canada hosted 
the Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013). Mark Waller, NFL senior vice 
president, international, doubts Asia or Australia would be targeted because 
of the travel concerns, but he does not dismiss anything.[5] Until 2015 
the Jacksonville Jaguars' agreement stipulated that all future International 
Series games in the current agreement would take place at Wembley, ruling 
out other locations.[68] The success of the International Series has led 
the NFL to focus its global expansion aims on the possibility of having 
a full franchise located in London. While no set timetable has been set, 
the league is working on a goal of establishing a franchise by around 2021, 
assuming they have all the necessary arrangements in place. It is believed 
this would be most likely achieved through relocation of an existing franchise, 
with the Jaguars most often linked due to their association with the International 
Series, even though their owners are said to be content with the current 
arrangement and other franchises have more reason to move (the most often 
cited being poor on-field performance, lack of fans and uncertainty over 
stadium leases). The NFL has used some of the specific arrangements for 
the International Series games as a test bed for predicting how a London 
franchise could be made effective from a logistical and competitiveness
