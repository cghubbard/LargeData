Orange County is a county located in the U.S. state of New York. As of 
the 2010 census, the population was 372,813.[1] The county seat is Goshen.[2] 
This county was first created in 1683 and reorganized with its present 
boundaries in 1798.[3] Orange County is included in the New York-Newark-Jersey 
City, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is in the state's Mid-Hudson 
Region of the Hudson Valley. The County Executive is Steve Neuhaus. As 
of the 2010 census the centre of population of New York state was located 
in Orange County, approximately three miles west of the hamlet of Westbrooksville.[4] 
Orange County was officially established on November 1, 1683, when the 
Province of New York was divided into twelve counties. Each of these was 
named to honor a member of the British royal family, and Orange County 
took its name from the Prince of Orange, who subsequently became King William 
III of England. As originally defined, Orange County included only the 
southern part of its present-day territory, plus all of present-day Rockland 
County further south. The northern part of the present-day county, beyond 
Moodna Creek, was then a part of neighbouring Ulster County. At that date, 
the only European inhabitants of the area were a handful of Dutch colonists 
in present-day Rockland County, and the area of modern Orange County was 
entirely occupied by the native Munsee people. Due to its relatively small 
population, the original Orange County was not fully independent and was 
administered by New York County. The first European settlers in the area 
of the present-day county arrived in 1685. They were a party of around 
twenty-five families from Scotland, led by David Toshach, the Laird of 
Monzievaird, and his brother-in-law Major Patrick McGregor, a former officer 
of the French Army. They settled in the Hudson Highlands at the place where 
the Moodna Creek enters the Hudson River, now known as New Windsor. In 
1709, a group of German Palatine refugees settled at Newburgh. They were 
Protestants from a part of Germany along the Rhine that had suffered during 
the religious wars. Queen Anne's government arranged for passage from England 
of nearly 3,000 Palatines in ten ships. Many were settled along the Hudson 
River in work camps on property belonging to Robert Livingston. A group 
of Dutch and English settlers arrived at Goshen in 1712. Additional immigrants 
came from Ireland; they were of Scots and English descent who had been 
settled as planters there. In 1798, after the American Revolutionary War, 
the boundaries of Orange County changed. Its southern corner was used to 
create the new Rockland County, and in exchange, an area to the north of 
the Moodna Creek was added, which had previously been in Ulster County. 
This caused a reorganization of the local administration, as the original 
county seat had been fixed at Orangetown in 1703, but this was now in Rockland 
County. Duties were subsequently shared between Goshen, which had been 
the center of government for the northern part of Orange County, and Newburgh, 
which played a similar role in the area transferred from Ulster County. 
The county court was established in 1801. It was not until 1970 that Goshen 
was named as the sole county seat. Due to a boundary dispute between New 
York and New Jersey, the boundaries of many of the southern towns of the 
county were not definitively established until the 19th century.[5] According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 839 square miles 
(2,170 km2), of which 812 square miles (2,100 km2) is land and 27 square 
miles (70 km2) (3.2%) is water.[6] Orange County is in southeastern New 
York State, directly north of the New Jersey-New York border, west of the 
Hudson River, east of the Delaware River and northwest of New York City. 
It borders the New York counties of Dutchess, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, 
Ulster, and Westchester, as well as Passaic and Sussex counties in New 
Jersey and Pike County in Pennsylvania. Orange County is the only county 
in New York State which borders both the Hudson and Delaware Rivers. Orange 
County is where the Great Valley of the Appalachians finally opens up and 
ends. The western corner is set off by the Shawangunk Ridge. The area along 
the Rockland County border (within Harriman and Bear Mountain state parks) 
and south of Newburgh is part of the Hudson Highlands. The land in between 
is the valley of the Wallkill River. In the southern portion of the county 
the Wallkill valley expands into a wide glacial lake bed known as the Black 
Dirt Region for its fertility. The highest point is Schunemunk Mountain, 
at 1,664 feet (507 m) above sea level. The lowest is sea level along the 
Hudson. As of the census of 2000, there were 341,367 people, 114,788 households, 
and 84,483 families residing in the county. The population density was 
418 people per square mile (161/km²). There were 122,754 housing units 
at an average density of 150 per square mile (58/km²). The racial makeup 
of the county was 83.70% White, 8.09% Black or African American, 0.35% 
Native American, 1.51% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 4.09% from other 
races, and 2.23% from two or more races. 18.64% of the population were 
Hispanic or Latino of any race. 18.3% were of Italian, 17.4% Irish, 10.2% 
German and 5.0% Polish ancestry according to the 2000 census. 9.23% reported 
speaking Spanish at home, 3.29% Yiddish, and 1.20% Italian.[12] By 2005, 
census estimates placed Orange County's non-Hispanic white population at 
72.4%. African Americans were 10.2% of the population. Native Americans 
were at 0.4%, a change that was less than can be measured by the precision 
of the 2005 estimates being used for these figures. Asians were up to 2.2% 
of the population. Latinos had made the largest gain as an increase in 
their percentage of the population, and constituted 19.9% of the county's 
population.[13] There were 114,788 households out of which 39.60% had children 
under the age of 18 living with them, 57.90% were married couples living 
together, 11.40% had a female householder with no husband present, and 
26.40% were non-families. 21.50% of all households were made up of individuals 
and 8.50% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The 
average household size was 2.85 and the average family size was 3.35. In 
the county the population was spread out with 29.00% under the age of 18, 
8.70% from 18 to 24, 30.00% from 25 to 44, 21.90% from 45 to 64, and 10.30% 
who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 
100 females there were 100.30 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, 
there were 97.50 males. The median income for a household in the county 
was $52,058, and the median income for a family was $60,355. Males had 
a median income of $42,363 versus $30,821 for females. The per capita income 
for the county was $21,597. About 7.60% of families and 10.50% of the population 
were below the poverty line, including 14.80% of those under age 18 and 
8.00% of those age 65 or over. Despite its rural roots, Orange County has 
been among the fastest-growing regions within the New York City Metropolitan 
Area. Originally, like most New York counties, Orange County was governed 
by a Board of Supervisors. Its board consisted of the 20 town supervisors, 
9 city supervisors elected from the 9 wards of the City of Newburgh, and 
four each elected from the wards of the cities of Middletown and Port Jervis. 
In 1968, the board adopted a county charter and a reapportionment plan 
that created the county legislature and executive. The first county executive 
and legislature were elected in November, 1969 and took office on January 
1, 1970. Today, Orange County is still governed by the same charter; residents 
elect the county executive and a 21-member county legislature elected from 
21 single-member districts. There are also several state constitutional 
positions that are elected, including a Sheriff, County Clerk and District 
Attorney. Prior to 1 January 2008 four coroners were also elected; however, 
on that date, the county switched to a medical examiner system. The current 
County Officers are: The County Legislature and its previous board of supervisors 
were long dominated by the Republican Party. However, since the late 20th 
century, the Democrats have closed the gap. During 2008 and 2009 the legislature 
was evenly split between 10 Republicans, 10 Democrats and 1 Independence 
Party member. In 2009, the legislature had its first Democratic chairman 
elected when one member of the Republican caucus voted alongside the 10 
Democratic members to elect Roxanne Donnery (D)-Highlands/Woodbury to the 
post. At the November 2009 election, several Democratic incumbents were 
defeated. As of the convening of the legislature on January 1, 2012, there 
are 12 Republicans, 8 Democrats and 1 Independence member. In 1970, the 
county switched from government by a Board of Supervisors, consisting of 
the elected heads of town governments, to having a 21-member elected county 
legislature and executive. The sheriff, district attorney and county clerk 
have always been elected. All serve four-year terms, with elections in 
the year following presidential election years, save the sheriff, whose 
election is the following year. The current county executive is Steven 
Neuhaus, former town supervisor for Chester. Frank Phillips, Donna Benson 
and Carl DuBois are the incumbent district attorney, clerk and sheriff 
respectively. All are Republicans, and as of 2012 the legislature has a 
13–8 Republican majority. Only one Democrat, Mary McPhillips, has served 
as county executive. She failed to win re-election after a single term 
in the early 1990s. For several years in the late 2000s, one Republican 
legislator's decision to become an independent and caucus with the Democrats 
led to a 10-10-1 effective Democratic majority, with Roxanne Donnery as 
chair. The Republicans regained their majority in the 2009 elections. The 
county is served by Stewart International Airport, located two miles west 
of Newburgh, New York. The airport serves Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, 
American Airlines, and Allegiant Air. AirTran Airways stopped providing 
service to the airport in late 2008. Ground transportation within Orange 
County is provided primarily by Leprechaun Lines, Monsey Trails, NJ Transit, 
Short Line Bus, and Metro-North Railroad's Port Jervis Line, as well as 
amenities such as senior citizen busing and car services, which usually 
restrict themselves to their respective town or city.[14][15] George W. 
Bush won 54% of the Orange County vote in 2004 reflecting a solid Republican 
edge in county politics. However, Barack Obama carried the county by a 
51% margin four years later. It was the first time a Democrat had carried 
Orange County when first elected to the presidency. That year the number 
of registered Democrats in the county exceeded Republicans for the first 
time. The two presidential election results give the county a Cook PVI 
of R+2, consistent with county voters' willingness to sometimes elect Democrats, 
such as U.S. Rep. John Hall. From 2007 on, when Hall represented the 19th 
district, which covers most of the county, Orange's representation in Congress 
was exclusively Democratic, as Maurice Hinchey has represented the towns 
of Crawford, Montgomery and Newburgh and the city of Newburgh, all of which 
are in the 22nd district, since 1988. In the 2010 midterms, Hall was defeated 
by Nan Hayworth. In [2012, Hayworth was defeated by Democrat Sean Patrick 
Maloney, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton.[16] Maloney won a 
rematch against Hayworth in 2014. At the state level, Republicans have 
continued to hold onto Senate seats while Democrats have made inroads in 
recent years on the Assembly side. Two State Senate districts—the 39th, 
held by Bill Larkin and 42nd, held by John Bonacic—cover the county. Democrats 
have made significant gains in the county's State Assembly seats. The 98th 
district, which includes the far western part of the county as well as 
the Town of Warwick, is represented by Annie Rabbitt, and the 101st district, 
which includes the Towns of Crawford and Montgomery, is held by Claudia 
Tenney, both Republicans. The remainder of the county's Assembly districts 
are represented by Democrats: James Skoufis in the 99th district, Aileen 
Gunther in the 100th district, and Frank Skartados in the 104th district. 
Skoufis is the youngest New York State legislator currently serving. Delano-Hitch 
Stadium in Newburgh has played host to various professional and amateur 
baseball teams from various leagues since opening in 1926. The stadium 
is currently home to the Newburgh Newts. High schools in Orange County 
compete in Section 9 of the New York State Public High School Athletic 
Association along with schools from Dutchess, Ulster, and Sullivan counties. 
The Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy in West Point 
field NCAA Division I teams in 24 different sports. The Orange County Community 
College Colts compete in the National Junior College Athletic Association. 
Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh fields 15 teams in the Eastern College 
Athletic Conference and the Skyline Conference of NCAA Division III. The 
Orange County Youth Football League (O.C.Y.F.L.) is a non-profit organization 
that allows youth age 6 through 14 to play competitive American football. 
The League encompasses 15 towns with over 100 teams in Orange County and 
surrounding areas including Chester, Cornwall, Goshen, Highland Falls, 
Marlboro, Middletown, Minisink Valley, Monticello, Newburgh, New Windsor, 
Pine Bush, Port Jervis, Valley Central, Wallkill, Warwick and Washingtonville.[17] 
It is composed of 4 Divisions, divided by weight restrictions, and a "Mighty 
Mite" Flag Football division for 6 & 7 year olds. In each division, there 
is additionally a complete cheerleading program for each team. There is 
a comprehensive annual schedule of play within each division for all teams, 
culminating in a divisional Championship game, often played in Michie Stadium 
or Shea Stadium at the historic United States Military Academy at West 
Point, New York. Points of interest in Orange County include the United 
States Military Academy at West Point; Brotherhood Winery, America's oldest 
winery, in Washingtonville; the birthplace of William H. Seward in Florida; 
the home and birthplace of Velveeta and Liederkranz Cheese in Monroe; the 
Harness Racing Museum & Hall of Fame in Goshen; the Times Herald-Record 
newspaper, the first cold press offset daily in the country, in Middletown; 
the Galleria at Crystal Run, in Wallkill; the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets 
in Monroe; and the Orange County Fair in Wallkill. The only state parks 
include Goosepond Mountain State Park, Harriman State Park and Sterling 
Forest State Park. It is also the location of Orange County Choppers, the 
custom motorcycle shop featured on The Discovery Channel television series 
American Chopper. Coordinates: 41°24′N 74°19′W﻿ / ﻿41.40°N 74.31°W﻿ / 41.40;
