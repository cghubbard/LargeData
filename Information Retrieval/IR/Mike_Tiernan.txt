Michael Joseph Tiernan (January 21, 1867 â€“ November 7, 1918), nicknamed 
"Silent Mike", was an American right fielder in Major League Baseball who 
played exclusively for the New York Giants from 1887 to 1899. Born in Trenton, 
New Jersey, his debut game was on April 30, 1887. His final game was played 
on July 31, 1899. Tiernan led the National League in home runs in 1890 
and 1891, and compiled a .311 lifetime batting average. He is the Giants' 
all-time franchise leader in triples and stolen bases. One of the great 
home run hitters of the 19th century, he hit 106 of them, which ties him 
with Hall of Famer Dan Brouthers for fourth most among 19th century ball
