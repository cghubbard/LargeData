Warren M. Goldsmith (October 1848 â€“ September 16, 1915) was an American 
professional baseball player in the 1860s and 1870s. He played third base, 
shortstop, second base, and catcher in the National Association, three 
times a regular player on one of the weakest teams in that first professional 
league. Born in Baltimore, Goldsmith moved from the local Enterprise club 
to the Maryland late in the 1868 season, probably just short of his 20th 
birthday. Maryland was the strongest team in the city but it lost badly 
to Enterprise on September 1 (15-36) before winning twice, 17-15 and 33-18, 
in the middle of the month. Goldsmith evidently won a "job" in those three 
matches.[1] Goldsmith was a marginal player in the National Association, 
able to play at that level only with teams that would not survive. He played 
all 19 games for Kekionga in 1871, all nine for Olympic in 1872, and all 
13 for Western in 1875. In 1873 he played one game for his old Maryland 
club, which dropped out after playing six games against Baltimore and Washington
