to a reliever after the promotion.[4] Boxberger began the 2011 season with 
the Mudcats, but was promoted to the Louisville Bats of the Class AAA International 
League. He finished the 2011 season with a 2.03 ERA and 11 saves in 55

against among all qualified Southern League relievers.[5] Boxberger was 
the top Double-A closer in the minor leagues in 2011.[6] Boxberger pitched

Padres for Mat Latos on December 17, 2011.[7] Boxberger began the 2012 
season with the Tucson Padres of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League. He 
was promoted to the Major Leagues on June 10, and made his debut the same 
day, pitching a hitless eighth inning against the Milwaukee Brewers in 
Miller Park.[8] Boxberger was returned to Tucson on June 26 after five 
relief appearances. He was called up to the majors again on July 30 when 
Joe Thatcher was placed on the disabled list[9] and was optioned back to 
Triple-A on August 22 after eight appearances to make room on the roster 
for starter Andrew Werner.[10] Boxberger joined the Padres again September 
4 and remained with the club through the end of the season. In his time 
with Tucson, Boxberger posted a 2.70 ERA and 12.9 strike-outs per 9 innings 
over 37 games in relief.[11] His totals for the 2012 season in 24 games 
with the Major League club were a 2.60 ERA and 33 strike-outs versus 18 
walks in 27 2⁄3 innings. Boxberger started the 2013 season with Tucson.[12] 
He was recalled by the Padres on May 2, and optioned back to Tucson on 
May 11. The Padres recalled him again on June 2.[13] On January 22, 2014, 
the Padres traded Boxberger, Logan Forsythe, Matt Lollis, Matt Andriese, 
and Maxx Tissenbaum to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Alex Torres and 
Jesse Hahn.[14] During spring training, the Rays optioned Boxberger to 
the Durham Bulls of the International League.[15] On May 8, 2014, Boxberger 
made an appearance in the top of the 6th inning vs the Baltimore Orioles 
with the bases loaded. He proceeded to strike out 3 batters on 9 pitches 
thus becoming the 2nd Rays pitcher ever to pitch an immaculate inning and 
the first pitcher ever on record to do so with the bases loaded.[16] With 
Jake McGee on the disabled list at the start of the 2015 season, Boxberger 
served as the Rays' closer.[17] He successfully converted his first ten 
save opportunities, and remained the closer after McGee's return.[18] Boxberger 
was selected for the 2015 MLB All-Star Game.[19] Boxberger finished the 
season with a 3.71 ERA in 69 appearances, converting 41 of 47 save opportunities

He began the season on the disabled list, returning to the Rays on May 
30.[22] In his first appearance of the 2016 season, Boxberger strained 
his left oblique muscle, and went back on the disabled list. Boxberger 
is considered a good fit for the late innings of games, either as a setup 
pitcher or closer.[4] He has a four-seam fastball that ranges from 92 to 
96 miles per hour (148 to 154 km/h), a changeup, a slider he throws at

81 miles per hour (126–130 km/h).[23] Boxberger is tough on right-handers, 
posting a .225/.356/.354 line in 2012, but lefties hit .262/.380/.500 against 
him in the same span. Boxberger's father, Rod, also attended USC and played
