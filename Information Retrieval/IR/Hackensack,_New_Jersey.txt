Hackensack is a city in Bergen County, New Jersey, United States, and serves 
as its county seat.[21][22] It was officially named New Barbadoes Township 
until 1921, but it was informally known as Hackensack. As of the 2010 United 
States Census, the city's population was 43,010,[10][11][12] reflecting 
an increase of 333 (+0.8%) from the 42,677 counted in the 2000 Census, 
which had, in turn, increased by 5,628 (+15.2%) from the 37,049 counted 
in the 1990 Census.[23] An inner suburb of New York City, Hackensack is 
located approximately 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Midtown Manhattan and 
about 7 miles (11 km) from the George Washington Bridge.[24] From a number 
of locations, the New York City skyline can be seen.[24] The Metropolitan 
Campus of Fairleigh Dickinson University borders the Hackensack River in 
both Hackensack and Teaneck. Hackensack is also the home of the New Jersey 
Naval Museum and the World War II submarine USS Ling. Astronaut Wally Schirra 
is perhaps Hackensack's most famous native son. The city is known for a 
great diversity of neighborhoods and land uses very close to one another. 
Within its borders are the prominent Hackensack University Medical Center, 
a trendy high-rise district about a mile long, classic suburban neighborhoods 
of single-family houses, stately older homes on acre-plus lots, older two-family 
neighborhoods, large garden apartment complexes, industrial areas, the 
Bergen County Jail, a tidal river, Hackensack River County Park, Borg's 
Woods Nature Preserve, various city parks, large office buildings, a major 
college campus, the Bergen County Court House, a vibrant small-city downtown 
district, and various small neighborhood business districts.[25] According 
to a 2016 study, the city ranked as the 5th-best place in New Jersey for 
entrepreneurs.[26] The first inhabitants of the area were the Lenni Lenape, 
an Algonquian people (later known as the Delaware Indians) who lived along 
the valley of what they called the Achinigeu-hach, or "Ackingsah-sack", 
meaning stony ground (today the Hackensack River).[27] A representation 
of Chief Oratam of the Achkinhenhcky appears on the Hackensack municipal 
seal. The most common explanation is that the city was named for the Native 
American tribe,[28][29] though other sources attribute it to a Native American 
word variously translated as meaning "hook mouth", "stream that unites 
with another on low ground", "on low ground" or "land of the big snake",[30][31] 
while another version described as "more colorful than probable" attributes 
the name to an inn called the "Hock and Sack".[32] Settlement by the Dutch 
West India Company in New Netherland on west banks of the North River (Hudson 
River) across from New Amsterdam (present-day lower Manhattan) began in 
the 1630s at Pavonia, eventually leading to the establishment of Bergen 
(at today's Bergen Square in Jersey City) in 1660.[33] Oratam, sachem of 
the Lenni Lenape, deeded the land along mid-Hackensack River to the Dutch 
in 1665. The area was soon taken by the English in 1667, but kept its Dutch 
name. Philip Cartaret, governor of what became the proprietary colony of 
East Jersey granted land to Captain John Berry in the area of Achter Kol[34] 
and soon after took up residence and called it "New Barbadoes," after having 
resided on the island of Barbadoes. In 1669, a deed was confirmed for the 
2,260 acres (9.1 km2) tract that had been given earlier by Oratem to Sarah 
Kiersted in gratitude for her work as emissary and interpreter.[35][36] 
Other grants were given at the English Neighborhood.[37][38][39] In 1675, 
the East Jersey Legislature established the administrative districts: (Bergen, 
Essex, Middlesex, and Monmouth). In 1683, Bergen (along with the three 
other counties) was officially recognized as an independent county by the 
Provincial Assembly.[40] The seal of Bergen County bearing this date includes 
an image of an agreement between the settlers and the natives. New Barbadoes 
Township, together with Acquackanonk Township, were formed by Royal charter 
on October 31, 1693.[41][42] In 1700, the village of Hackensack was little 
more than the area around Main Street from the Courthouse to around Anderson 
Street. New Barbadoes Township included what is now Maywood, Rochelle Park, 
Paramus and River Edge, along with those portions of Oradell that are west 
of the Hackensack River. These areas were all very sparsely populated and 
consisted of farm fields, woods and swamplands. The few roads that existed 
then included the streets now known as Kinderkamack Road, Paramus Road/Passaic 
Street and Essex Street. The southernmost portions of what is now Hackensack 
were not part of New Barbadoes Township at that time.[citation needed] 
The neighborhood that came to be known as the village of Hackensack (today 
the area encompassing Bergen County's municipal buildings in Hackensack) 
was a part of Essex County until 1710, when Bergen County, by royal decree 
of Queen Anne of Great Britain, was enlarged and the Township of New Barbadoes 
was removed from Essex County and added to Bergen County.[43] In 1710, 
the village of Hackensack in the newly formed Township of New Barbadoes 
was designated as being more centrally located and more easily reached 
by the majority of the Bergen County's inhabitants, and hence was chosen 
as the county seat of Bergen County, as it remains today. The earliest 
records of the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders date back to 1715, 
at which time agreement was made to build a courthouse and jail complex, 
which was completed in 1716.[44] During the American Revolutionary War, 
George Washington headquartered in the village of Hackensack in November 
1776 during the retreat from Fort Lee via New Bridge Landing and camped 
on 'The Green' across from the First Dutch Reformed Church on November 
20, 1776. A raid by British forces against Hackensack on March 23, 1780, 
resulted in the destruction by fire of the original courthouse structure.[45] 
The Hackensack Improvement Commission was incorporated by an Act of the 
state legislature approved on April 1, 1868, within New Barbadoes township 
and including the village of Hackensack, with authority to develop sewers 
and other improvements in Hackensack.[46] The New Jersey Legislature passed 
the Township School Act in 1894, under which each village, borough, town, 
or city in New Jersey was delegated responsibility for its own public schools 
through the office of the county superintendent. Hackensack established 
a local board of education in 1894, as required by the new law, which took 
over operation of schools located in the township and established Hackensack 
High School.[47] The 1894 act allowed local residents, by petition, to 
change municipal boundaries at will, setting off fearsome political battles 
statewide. Portions of the township had been taken to form Harrington Township 
(June 22, 1775), Lodi Township (March 1, 1826), Midland Township (March 
7, 1871) and Little Ferry (September 20, 1894).[41] After these departures, 
secessions, and de-annexations, all that was left of New Barbadoes Township 
was the village of Hackensack and its surrounding neighborhoods of Fairmount, 
Red Hill and Cherry Hill. In 1896, New Barbadoes acquired a portion of 
Lodi Township covering an area south of Essex Street from the bend of Essex 
Street to the Maywood border. That same year the Hackensack Improvement 
commission was abolished and the City of Hackensack and New Barbadoes Township 
became coterminous.[48][49] The final parcel lost by New Barbadoes Township 
was the northeastern corner of what is now Little Ferry, which was incorporated 
in September 1894.[50] An act of the State Legislature incorporated the 
Fairmount section of New Barbadoes with the Hackensack Improvement Commission, 
and eliminated New Barbadoes Township as a political entity. On November 
21, 1921, based on the results of a referendum held on November 8, 1921, 
New Barbadoes Township received its charter to incorporate as a city and 
officially took on its name "Hackensack," a name derived from its original 
inhabitants, the Lenni Lenape, who named it "Ackingsah-sack".[41] In 1933, 
Hackensack adopted the Manager form of government under the terms of the 
1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five Council persons all elected at-large 
and a mayor selected by the council from among its members.[51] According 
to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 4.346 square 
miles (11.256 km2), including 4.180 square miles (10.826 km2) of land and 
0.166 square miles (0.430 km2) of water (3.82%).[2][3] The city is bordered 
by Paramus, River Edge, Teaneck, Bogota, Ridgefield Park, Little Ferry, 
South Hackensack, Hasbrouck Heights, Lodi, and Maywood.[52] There are many 
houses of historic value, and some of these were identified in the 1990 
Master Plan. The city does not have any registered historic districts, 
or any restrictions on preserving the historic facade in any portions of 
the city. Areas considered suburban single-family residential neighborhoods 
account for about one third of the city's area, mostly along its western 
side. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially 
or completely within the city include Fairmount and North Hackensack.[53] 
As the initial destination for many immigrants to Bergen County from around 
the globe, Hackensack's ethnic composition has become exceptionally diverse. 
As of 2013, approximately 38.9% of the population was foreign-born. In 
addition, 2.5% were born in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico or abroad 
to American parents. 51.7% of the population over the age of five speak 
only English in their household, while 32.5% of the population speaks Spanish 
at home.[67] The South Asian and East Asian populations have increased 
most rapidly in Hackensack since 2000, with nearly 2,000 Indian Americans, 
over 1,000 Filipino Americans, and over 600 Korean Americans represented 
in the 2010 United States Census.[68] Hackensack's Hispanic population 
has also risen rapidly, to over 15,000 in 2010;[68] Ecuadoreans, Dominicans, 
and Colombians have become the top Hispanic groups in northern Hackensack.[69] 
The Black population dropped as a percentage although minimally in absolute 
numbers between 2000 and 2010.[68] The city lost approximately 10% of its 
Caucasian population between 2000 and 2010, which has stabilized and resumed 
growth since 2010 and has remained substantial, at over 20,000 in 2010.[68] 
The city has also witnessed greatly increasing diversity in its non-Hispanic 
white segment, with large numbers of Eastern Europeans, Eurasians, Central 
Asians, and Arabic immigrants offsetting the loss in Hackensack's earlier 
established Italian American, Irish American, and German American populations. 
At the 2010 United States Census, there were 43,010 people, 18,142 households, 
and 9,706 families residing in the city. The population density was 10,290.0 
per square mile (3,973.0/km2). There were 19,375 housing units at an average 
density of 4,635.4 per square mile (1,789.7/km2). The racial makeup of 
the city was 46.67% (20,072) White, 24.44% (10,511) Black or African American, 
0.56% (241) Native American, 10.30% (4,432) Asian, 0.02% (10) Pacific Islander, 
13.59% (5,844) from other races, and 4.42% (1,900) from two or more races. 
Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 35.31% (15,186) of the population.[10] 
There were 18,142 households, of which 23.2% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them, 34.1% were married couples living together, 13.9% 
had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.5% were non-families. 
39.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.4% had someone 
living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size 
was 2.30 and the average family size was 3.11.[10] In the city, 18.7% of

25 to 44, 26.1% from 45 to 64, and 12.4% who were 65 years of age or older. 
The median age was 37.5 years. For every 100 females there were 98.0 males. 
For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 96.4 males.[10] The Census 
Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted 
dollars) median household income was $57,676 (with a margin of error of 
+/- $3,577) and the median family income was $66,911 (+/- $5,433). Males 
had a median income of $45,880 (+/- $4,012) versus $42,059 (+/- $1,681) 
for females. The per capita income for the city was $32,036 (+/- $1,809). 
About 8.9% of families and 10.7% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 11.7% of those age 65 or 
over.[70] Same-sex couples headed 145 households in 2010, an increase from 
the 112 counted in 2000.[71] As of the 2000 United States Census[18] there 
were 42,677 people, 18,113 households, and 9,545 families residing in the 
city. The population density was 10,358.3 people per square mile (3,999.4/km2). 
There were 18,945 housing units at an average density of 4,598.2 per square

with 18.2% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 38.4% from 25 to 44, 
22.3% from 45 to 64, and 12.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median

of families and 9.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 
9.1% of those under age 18 and 10.3% of those age 65 or over.[65][66] Hackensack 
operates under the 1923 Municipal Manager Law form of New Jersey municipal 
government. The City Council consists of five members who are elected to 
four-year terms on a concurrent basis in a non-partisan election held every 
four years in May.[8] This form of government separates policy making (the 
work of the mayor and city council) from the execution of policy (the work 
of the city manager). This maintains professional management and a City-wide 
perspective through: nonpartisan election, at-large representation, concentration 
of executive responsibility in the hands of a professional manager accountable 
to the Mayor and Council, concentration of policy making power in one body: 
a five-person Mayor and Council. In the several decades in which the City 
has used the Municipal Manager form of government, Hackensack has had only 
nine City Managers. As of 2016[update], the mayor of the City of Hackensack 
is John P. Labrosse Jr., whose term of office as mayor ends June 30, 2017, 
along with those of all other councilmembers.[4][72] Other members of the 
Hackensack City Council are Deputy Mayor Kathleen Canestrino, Leonardo 
'Leo' Battaglia, Deborah Keeling-Geddis (elected to serve an unexpired 
term) and David Sims.[72][73][74][75] John Labrosse, who had served as 
councilman since 2009, and the entire council were elected in May 2013 
under the "Citizens for Change" party, which replaced the mayor and three 
council members who had been supported by the Zisa family. The mayor and 
deputy mayor will serve four-year terms, unlike in the previous council, 
where the mayors and deputy mayors served one-year rotating terms by mutual 
agreement.[72] In April 2015, the city council selected Jason Some on an 
interim basis to fill the vacant seat of Rose Greenman, who had resigned 
the previous month citing claims that her council colleagues had discriminated 
against her.[76] In the November 2015 general election, Deborah Keeling-Geddis 
was elected to serve the balance of the term of office, edging interim 
councilmember Jason Some by 24 votes in the final count, with four candidates 
running for the seat.[77][78] In a move to eliminate past Zisa family political 
influence, the 2013 city council did not reappoint Joseph Zisa, the city 
attorney; Richard Salkin, the municipal prosecutor; and Scirocco Insurance 
Group, the city's insurance broker where former city mayor Jack Zisa is 
an insurance agent.[72] City Council candidate Joseph DeFalco, principal 
of Hackensack High School, died of a heart attack the day of the municipal 
election in 2005, but was elected despite his death.[79] His running mates 
agreed to create a rotation under which each of the four surviving members 
of the New Visions for Hackensack slate would serve for a year as Mayor, 
creating a series of firsts for the City. Townes took office in 2005 as 
the city's first black mayor, and Sasso became the first female mayor in 
2006. Meneses became Hackensack's first Hispanic mayor when he was sworn 
in on July 1, 2007, and Melfi took the reins as mayor in 2008.[80] Four 
of the same five officials were re-elected in 2009 (Townes, Melfi, Sasso, 
Meneses), along with one opposition candidate, LaBrosse. The city council 
continued to rotate the mayor's seat, with the exception of Labrosse, and 
Melfi became mayor again in 2012. Frank Zisa served as mayor from 1977 
to 1981,[81] Fred Cerbo from 1981 to 1989,[82] and John F. "Jack" Zisa 
(son of Frank Zisa) from 1989 to 2005.[83] Former Assemblyman Charles "Ken" 
Zisa served as chief of the Hackensack Police Department from his 1995 
appointment to replace John Aletta until May 2010 when he was suspended 
without pay on charges of official misconduct and insurance fraud. Tomas 
Padilla was appointed the acting police chief while the police department 
was being monitored by the Bergen County Prosecutors office. In May 2012, 
a judge ordered Zisa out of his position as police chief, a decision that 
cost him his police retirement benefits.[84][85][86] In January 2013, Mike 
Mordaga was appointed the new civilian police director, which replaced 
the previous position of police chief.[87] Hackensack is located in the 
5th Congressional District[88] and is part of New Jersey's 37th state legislative 
district.[11][89][90] Prior to the 2010 Census, Hackensack had been part 
of the 9th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting 
Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the 
November 2012 general elections.[91] New Jersey's Fifth Congressional District 
is represented by Scott Garrett (R, Wantage Township).[92] New Jersey is 
represented in the United States Senate by Cory Booker (D, Newark, term 
ends 2021)[93] and Bob Menendez (D, Paramus, 2019).[94][95] For the 2016–2017 
session (Senate, General Assembly), the 37th Legislative District of the 
New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Loretta Weinberg 
(D, Teaneck) and in the General Assembly by Valerie Huttle (D, Englewood) 
and Gordon M. Johnson (D, Englewood).[96] The Governor of New Jersey is 
Chris Christie (R, Mendham Township).[97] The Lieutenant Governor of New 
Jersey is Kim Guadagno (R, Monmouth Beach).[98] Bergen County is governed 
by a directly elected County Executive, with legislative functions performed 
by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders.[99] As of 2015[update], 
the County Executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus; term ends December 
31, 2018).[100] The seven freeholders are elected at-large in partisan 
elections on a staggered basis, with two or three seats coming up for election 
each year, with a Chairman, Vice Chairman and Chairman Pro Tempore selected 
from among its members at a reorganization meeting held each January.[101] 
Bergen County's Freeholders are Freeholder Chairwoman Joan Voss (D, 2017; 
Fort Lee),[102] Vice Chairman Steve Tanelli (D, 2015; North Arlington)[103] 
Chairman Pro Tempore John A. Felice (R, 2016; River Edge),[104] David L. 
Ganz (D, 2017; Fair Lawn),[105] Maura R. DeNicola (R, 2016; Franklin Lakes)[106] 
Thomas J. Sullivan Jr., (D, Montvale, 2015; serving the unexpired term 
of office that had been occupied by James Tedesco before he was sworn in 
as County Executive)[107][108] and Tracy Silna Zur (D, 2015; Franklin Lakes).[109][110] 
Countywide constitutional officials are County Clerk John S. Hogan (D, 
Northvale),[111] Sheriff Michael Saudino (R)[112] and Surrogate Michael 
R. Dressler (D, Cresskill).[113][114][99] As of March 23, 2011, there were 
a total of 19,123 registered voters in Hackensack, of which 8,630 (45.1% 
vs. 31.7% countywide) were registered as Democrats, 1,993 (10.4% vs. 21.1%) 
were registered as Republicans and 8,492 (44.4% vs. 47.1%) were registered 
as Unaffiliated. There were 8 voters registered to other parties.[115] 
Among the city's 2010 Census population, 44.5% (vs. 57.1% in Bergen County) 
were registered to vote, including 54.7% of those ages 18 and over (vs. 
73.7% countywide).[115][116] In the 2012 presidential election, Democrat 
Barack Obama received 11,335 votes (78.6% vs. 54.8% countywide), ahead 
of Republican Mitt Romney with 2,835 votes (19.6% vs. 43.5%) and other 
candidates with 113 votes (0.8% vs. 0.9%), among the 14,428 ballots cast

serve students in Kindergarten through twelfth grade. As of the 2011–12 
school year, the district's six schools had an enrollment of 5,166 students 
and 391.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio 
of 13.21:1.[125] Schools in the district (with 2011–12 enrollment data 
from the National Center for Education Statistics[126]) are four K–4 elementary 
schools — Fairmount Elementary School[127] (633 students), Fanny Meyer 
Hillers School[128] (549), Jackson Avenue School[129] (451), and Nellie 
K. Parker School[130] (501) — while Hackensack Middle School[131] serves 
grades 5–8 (1,292) and Hackensack High School[132] serves students in grades 
9–12 (1,740).[133][134] Hackensack High School serves high school students 
living in neighboring communities as part of sending/receiving relationships 
with the respective districts, including about 250 from Maywood, 120 from 
Rochelle Park and 250 from South Hackensack as of 2012.[135] In addition, 
Teterboro residents had been able to choose between Hackensack High School 
and Hasbrouck Heights School District's Hasbrouck Heights High School.[citation 
needed] Bergen Arts and Science Charter School serves public school students 
from Hackensack, as well as those from Garfield and Lodi.[136] Public school 
students from the borough, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend 
the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical 
Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack and the 
Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs 
on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective 
application process and tuition covered by the student's home school district.[137][138] 
The First Baptist Church runs Bergen County Christian Academy, a K-12 school 
that was established in 1973 and is located at Union Street and Conklin 
Place.[139] The YCS George Washington School is a nonprofit private school
