As player As coach Charles Richard Lau (April 12, 1933, in Romulus, Michigan 
– March 18, 1984) was an American catcher and highly influential hitting 
coach in Major League Baseball. Lau was signed by the Detroit Tigers as 
an amateur free agent. After spending three seasons with the organization 
(1956, 1958–59) he was traded (with Don Lee) to the Milwaukee Braves for 
Casey Wise, Don Kaiser, and Mike Roarke. After the Baltimore Orioles purchased 
him from the Braves in 1962, he adopted a contact hitter's batting stance 
(feet wide apart, bat held almost parallel to the ground). That season 
he had a .294 batting average with six home runs and thirty-seven runs 
batted in. After hitting .194 in 23 games, he was sold by the Orioles to 
the Kansas City Athletics on July 1, 1963, hitting .294 in Kansas City 
and having a batting average of .272 in 92 games. On June 15, 1964, he 
was traded back to the Orioles for Wes Stock. On May 31, 1967, he was purchased 
by the Braves, now located in Atlanta, and on November 27, 1967, he was 
released by the Braves. On April 28, 1961, Lau caught the second of Warren 
Spahn's two career no-hitters.[2] After his playing career ended, Lau became 
a hitting coach for the Orioles, Oakland Athletics, Kansas City Royals, 
New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox. Contrary to popular belief, Lau 
did not emphasize releasing the top hand after making contact with the 
pitch and following through with only the lower hand on the bat. He did, 
however, suggest this measure to hitters who—for whatever reason—could 
not fully extend their arms during their swings. Lau developed a list of 
"Absolutes" about hitting, which included: Lau served as batting coach 
for the Royals from 1971 to 1978, with the exception of the early part 
of the 1975 season when he was the team's minor league hitting coach after 
his temporary ouster from the Royals' staff by then-skipper Jack McKeon. 
He worked with Hal McRae, Amos Otis, Willie Wilson and George Brett. After 
becoming the Chicago White Sox' hitting instructor in 1982, his pupils 
included Greg Luzinski, Carlton Fisk, Steve Kemp, Harold Baines and Ron 
Kittle. While serving as the White Sox hitting coach, he died in 1984 in 
Key Colony Beach, Florida at the age of 50 after a long bout with cancer. 
Since his death, no White Sox player or coach (except Lau disciple Walt 
Hriniak, the Chisox' hitting coach from 1989 to 1995[3]) has worn his number 
6 jersey,[4] although it has not been officially retired.[5] The baseball 
field at Romulus Senior High School in his hometown is named the Charley 
Lau Baseball Field. Lau also appeared in the film Max Dugan Returns as 
himself. The title character (played by Jason Robards, Jr.) pays Lau to
