Joseph "Joe" Angel is a radio play-by-play broadcasting announcer for the 
Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball. A native of Bogotá, Colombia, 
Angel is famous for his proper pronunciation of Latino players' names. 
As a teenager, Angel first emigrated with his family to Chicago, before 
eventually settling in the San Francisco Bay Area. In high school he played 
baseball and football (teaming with O. J. Simpson on the latter), and after 
graduating from City College of San Francisco began a career in broadcasting.[citation 
needed] In the 1970s Angel broadcast for the San Francisco Giants (1977–78), 
as well as Stanford University football and University of San Francisco 
basketball. Stints with the Minnesota Twins (1984–86), Baltimore Orioles 
(1988–90, 1992) and New York Yankees (1991) followed. In 1993 he left the 
Orioles to become the Florida Marlins' first radio voice, and was behind 
the microphone for the Marlins' first world championship in 1997, which 
was the same year he took over the television broadcast as well, a position 
he would hold until 2000. After two years with ESPN (2000–01), Angel returned 
to the Giants in 2002 (teaming with former Orioles partner Jon Miller); 
and in 2004 he began a second tenure with the Orioles. In his career, he 
was also engaged in World Series two times as a broadcaster.[1] He usually 
does 5 innings of play-by-play on Orioles radio currently as he does the 
1st and 2nd innings, the 5th inning, and the 8th and 9th innings and his 
broadcast partner Fred Manfra, but when occasionally paired with former 
Oriole pitcher Ben McDonald, he works all nine innings. Angel lives in 
El Dorado Hills with his wife Antoinette. He has three grown children: 
Tony, Natalie and Jonathan.[2] Angel's son, Jonathan, was one of the stars
