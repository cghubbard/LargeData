Craig Alan Biggio (/ˈbɪdʒioʊ/; born December 14, 1965) is an American former 
second baseman and catcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire 
career from 1988 through 2007 for the Houston Astros. A seven-time National 
League (NL) All-Star often regarded as the greatest all-around player in 
Astros history, he is the only player ever to be named an All-Star at both 
catcher and second base. With longtime teammates Jeff Bagwell and Lance 
Berkman, he formed the core of the "Killer B's" who led Houston to six 
playoff appearances from 1997 to 2005, culminating in the franchise's only 
World Series appearance in 2005. At the end of his career he ranked sixth 
in NL history in games played (2,850), fifth in at bats (10,876), eighth 
in hits (3,060) and seventh in runs scored (1,844). His 668 career doubles 
ranked fifth in major league history, and are the most ever by a right-handed 
hitter; his 56 doubles in 1999 were the most in the major leagues in 63 
years. Biggio, who batted .300 four times and scored 100 runs eight times, 
holds Astros franchise records for most career games, at bats, hits, runs 
scored, doubles, total bases (4,711) and extra base hits (1,014), and ranks 
second in runs batted in (1,175), walks (1,160) and stolen bases (414). 
He also holds the NL record for most times leading off a game with a home 
run (53), and is one of only five players with 250 home runs and 400 steals. 
A four-time Gold Glove Award winner who led NL second basemen in assists 
six times and putouts five times, he retired ranking fourth in NL history 
in games at second base (1,989), sixth in assists (5,448) and fielding 
percentage (.984), seventh in putouts (3,992) and double plays (1,153), 
and eighth in total chances (9,596). He was the ninth player in the 3,000 
hit club to collect all his hits with one team. Biggio also led the NL 
in times hit by pitch five times, with his career total of 285 trailing 
only Hughie Jennings' 287 in major league history. One of the most admired 
players of his generation, Biggio received the 2005 Hutch Award for perseverance 
through adversity and the 2007 Roberto Clemente Award for sportsmanship 
and community service. The Astros retired the number 7 in his honor the 
year following his retirement. Since 2008, Biggio has served as special 
assistant to the general manager of the Astros. He was elected to the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015,[1] and is the first member of the Hall to 
be depicted in an Astros uniform on his plaque. Craig Biggio graduated 
from Kings Park High School in Kings Park, New York, where he excelled 
as a multi-sport varsity athlete. Most notably, after the 1983 season Biggio 
was awarded the Hansen Award, which recognized him as being the best football 
player in Suffolk County.[2] However, Biggio's passion lay with baseball, 
such that he turned down football scholarships for the opportunity to play 
baseball for Seton Hall University. Although Biggio was an infielder, Seton 
Hall coach Mike Sheppard switched him to catcher because the team was in 
need of one. Biggio was an All-American baseball player at Seton Hall, 
where he played with other future Major League Baseball stars Mo Vaughn 
and John Valentin. Biggio, Vaughn and Valentin, along with Marteese Robinson, 
were featured in the book The Hit Men and the Kid Who Batted Ninth by David 
Siroty, which chronicled their rise from college teammates to the major 
leagues. Biggio was selected by the Houston Astros in the first round (22nd 
overall) of the 1987 draft. Biggio remains Seton Hall's leader in triples, 
second in runs scored, and is in the top ten in eighteen other single-season 
and career categories. In 1996, Biggio was inducted into the Seton Hall 
Hall of Fame and had his number 44 retired in 2012.[3] Biggio was called 
up as a catcher midway through the 1988 season, having batted .344 in his 
minor league career. In 1989, his first full season, Biggio became the 
Astros' starting catcher. He won the Silver Slugger Award in 1989. He was 
a very speedy runner, and an adept base stealer. Astros' management, in 
an attempt to keep the rigors of catching from sapping Biggio's speed, 
tried him in the outfield part-time in 1990, as he had played 18 games 
there in the minors. Yogi Berra mentioned Biggio's height in his book You 
Can Observe A Lot By Watching, saying, "I always identified with short 
catchers – they don't have to stand up as far".[4] The Astros acquired 
first baseman Jeff Bagwell prior to the start of the 1991 season, who, 
like Biggio, spent his entire major league career in a Houston uniform. 
A power hitter with higher-than-normal on-base skills, Bagwell played 15 
seasons, thus completely overlapping his career with Biggio's and wound 
up Houston's career leader in home runs. The pair came to be known as the 
"Killer B's", synonymous with the Astros throughout the 1990s and into 
the 2000s. A prodigious offensive and defensive unit, during their 10 peak 
seasons from 1994–2003, they appeared in nine All-Star Games, won five 
Gold Gloves, ranked in the top five of the Most Valuable Player Award voting 
five times and averaged 226 runs scored. They totaled 689 home runs, 2,485 
RBI and 3,083 runs scored while the Astros advanced to the postseason six 
times.[5] Other players that the Astros later acquired whose names started 
with the letter B also were included in this distinction, including Derek 
Bell, Sean Berry, Lance Berkman,[6] and Carlos Beltrán.[7] The Astros finally 
convinced Biggio to convert to second base in spring training 1992, even 
though Biggio had made the National League All-Star team as a catcher the 
year before. Biggio made the All-Star team for the second time in 1992, 
becoming the first player in the history of baseball to be an All-Star 
at both catcher and second base. It is remarkably rare for a major league 
catcher to make a successful transition to middle infielder. If a catcher 
changes positions, it is usually to first base, or occasionally to outfield 
or third base. Biggio became known as a reliable, hustling, consistent 
leadoff hitter, with unusual power for a second baseman. He holds the National 
League record for most home runs to lead off a game, with fifty. His statistics 
reflect this, having consistently good marks in hitting, on-base percentage, 
hit-by-pitch, runs, stolen bases, and doubles throughout his career. Biggio 
was also known for intentionally keeping his batting helmet dirty. Biggio 
played 1,800 games without a trip to the disabled list until August 1, 
2000, when he suffered a season-ending knee injury. In the play in which 
Biggio was injured, the Florida Marlins' Preston Wilson (who would later 
become Biggio's teammate) slid into second base, trying to stop a double 
play, and hit Biggio's planted left leg, tearing the ACL and MCL in Biggio's 
knee. Biggio rebounded with a good season in 2001, but had a lackluster 
performance in 2002, with only a .253 average, his lowest since entering 
the league; a highlight occurred on April 8, when he hit for the cycle 
for the only time in his career. However, he improved slightly for the 
2003 season, averaging .264 with 166 hits despite being asked by management 
to move to center field after the signing of free agent All-Star second 
baseman Jeff Kent. In 2004, he put up numbers more typical for his career, 
batting .281 with 178 hits, including a career high 24 homers. Biggio moved 
to yet another new position, left field, midway through the 2004 season 
to accommodate Beltrán, who was acquired in a trade to help bolster the 
Astros' struggling offense. In February, 2005, Biggio and Bagwell were 
jointly inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame.[8] Biggio resumed 
playing at second base after Kent left for the Dodgers and set a new career 
high with 26 home runs. He also reached 1,000 RBI, becoming the second 
Astro to do so, following Bagwell. After having played 4,714 games and 
their entire major league careers together in Houston, Biggio and Bagwell 
appeared in their first World Series in 2005[9] against the Chicago White 
Sox. The White Sox swept the Astros to secure the championship[10] with 
the lowest run-scoring differential in World Series history.[11] Both Biggio 
and Bagwell received Baseball America's Lifetime Achievement Award after 
the 2005 season.[12] On May 23, 2006, Biggio became the 23rd player in 
MLB history to reach 10,000 at-bats. On June 28, 2007, Biggio became the 
27th player in the history of Major League Baseball to join the 3,000 hit 
club, with a single against Colorado Rockies pitcher Aaron Cook. Through 
Biggio was tagged out on the play attempting to stretch it into a double, 
drawing the throw allowed a run to score. The game action paused while 
Biggio shared the moment with his wife and children. Longtime friend and 
former teammate Jeff Bagwell emerged from the Astros clubhouse to congratulate 
him. Biggio became the first player in Astros history to accumulate 3,000 
hits. It was Biggio's third hit of the game, and he went on to accumulate 
two more later in the game, one in the ninth inning and one in the eleventh 
inning. Interestingly enough, Biggio's 3,000 hit came on the same day that 
Frank Thomas hit his milestone 500th career home run, both marks which 
are considered to guarantee one's induction into the Hall of Fame. In anticipation 
of Biggio's reaching 3,000 hits, the Astros installed a digital counter 
just left of center field displaying his current hit total. With 668 doubles, 
he ended his career in fifth place on the all-time list. Biggio also holds 
the record for the most doubles by a right-handed hitter. He is the only 
player in the history of baseball with 3000 hits, 600 doubles, 400 stolen 
bases, and 250 home runs. He ranks 20th on the all-time hits list, though 
of those 20 players he ranks 19th in career batting average. Biggio fell 
nine home runs short of joining the career 300–300 club (300 homers and 
300 stolen bases). He would have become only the seventh player to achieve 
the feat. Incidentally, this also caused him to fall short of the 3,000 
hits, 300 homers and 300 stolen bases mark; he would have been only the 
second player in history to reach that club, the other being Willie Mays. 
On July 24, 2007, Biggio announced his retirement, effective at the end 
of the season (his 20th season with the club, a franchise record). Hours 
later, with the Astros locked in a 3–3 tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, 
Biggio hit a grand slam in the 6th inning. The Astros went on to win the 
game 7–4. In the penultimate game of his career, Biggio started as a catcher 
and caught 2 innings for the Astros. He also hit a double in his first 
at-bat of the game.[13] A sellout, record-breaking crowd packed Minute 
Maid Park on September 30, 2007, to witness Biggio's final game. He recorded 
his final career hit, a double in the first inning, and scored his final 
career run that same inning. In his final career at-bat, he grounded the 
ball to third baseman Chipper Jones, who threw out the hustling Biggio 
by half a step. He left the field to a standing ovation from the fans, 
and when he was replaced defensively in the top of the 8th inning he shook 
hands with umpires and teammates and left to another standing ovation as 
he waved to the fans. The Astros won the game 3–0. Biggio finished his 
career with 3,060 career hits, 668 doubles, 291 home runs, 1175 RBI, 414 
stolen bases, and a .281 batting average. Craig Biggio has been a special 
assistant to the general manager since 2008. In his current role, Craig 
works in several areas, including with the baseball operations staff in 
its Major and minor league player development programs with special emphasis 
on instruction, the amateur draft and scouting, and Major and minor league 
talent evaluation. Craig was involved in the selection of new Astros Manager 
Bo Porter in 2012. Additionally, Craig participates in the club's community 
development program. Houston Astros Executives Webpage Over his career, 
Biggio gained a reputation for being hit by pitches; some observers criticized 
him due to the fact that many of the pitches hit him on his sizable elbow 
pad. Some have even gone so far as to proclaim him the "king of hit batsmen."[14] 
On June 29, 2005, Biggio broke the modern-era career hit-by-pitch record, 
previously held by Don Baylor with 267. He is second to only Hughie Jennings 
on the all-time list with 287. Despite being hit by a record number of 
pitches, Biggio never charged the mound,[15] and had no serious injuries 
as a result of being hit by a pitch. In his final season, however, Biggio 
was only hit three times. He was hit fewer times total between 2006 and 
2007 (9 times in 2006, total of 12) than he was in 10 of his previous 11 
individual seasons. In August 2007, the satirical online newspaper The 
Onion referenced this in the article "Craig Biggio Blames Media Pressure 
For Stalling at 285 Hit-By-Pitches".[16] Biggio sent an arm guard to the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in recognition of his high hit-by-pitch 
total. On May 23, 2008, during a pre-game ceremony, Biggio received an 
award for MLB.com's This Year in Baseball 2007 Moment of the Year award 
for his 3,000th hit. On June 28, the Astros announced that they would retire 
Craig Biggio's jersey.[17] The Houston Astros retired his No. 7 jersey 
on August 17, 2008, prior to the start of a game versus the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Biggio was the ninth player in Astros history to have his number retired. 
Biggio first appeared on the writers' ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame 
in 2013, the earliest possible year of consideration. He led all Hall of 
Fame vote-getters by being named on 68.2% of ballots cast, however this 
was still 39 votes shy of reaching the 75% threshold that is required by 
the BBWAA for induction. The following year he once again failed to garner 
enough votes to be inducted, finishing two votes shy with a voting percentage 
of 74.8%. This ties him with Nellie Fox (1985) and Pie Traynor (1947) for 
smallest margin not to get into the Hall.[18] On January 6, 2015, Biggio 
was rewarded for his career by being elected to the Hall of Fame. He received 
82.7% of the votes and was inducted into the hall on July 26, 2015.[1] 
Biggio has received awards from various organizations, including the Hutch 
Award (2005) and being named one of Sporting News' Good Guys (2004). The 
Hutch Award is given to a player that shows competitiveness and never gives 
up. Part of the reason Biggio was given the award was for his multiple 
position changes, but also because of his work in the community and inspiring 
other teammates to participate as well. He also received the Roberto Clemente 
Award in 2007. The Roberto Clemente Award "recognizes the player who best 
exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement 
and the individual's contribution to his team."[19] Biggio has been a supporter 
and lead spokesperson for the Sunshine Kids Foundation for over a decade 
and almost the entirety of his playing career. The organization supports 
children fighting cancer with exciting activities for themselves and their 
families. Biggio helps the organization by raising awareness of the organization 
by wearing a small yellow sun on his cap for interviews, batting practice, 
and spring training games and by holding a celebrity golf tournament in 
Houston each spring. Biggio hosts an annual party at Minute Maid Park for 
about 100 Sunshine Kids to play baseball with Biggio and some of his teammates. 
With the 2006 annual golf tournament, Biggio has raised over $2 million 
for the organization. During 2007 spring training, MLB informed Biggio 
that he would no longer be allowed to wear the small yellow sun on his 
cap during interviews, photo shoots, or spring training. Biggio had worn 
the Sunshine Kids pin for over a decade. This edict was big news in Houston, 
and Houstonians, long known for their charitable nature and unconditional 
love of Biggio, reacted very negatively to MLB. After the public uproar, 
MLB relented and Biggio was allowed to wear the Sunshine Kids pin as he 
had done since becoming a spokesperson.[20] Biggio and his wife, the former 
Patty Egan, have three children: son Conor Joseph (born January 7, 1993); 
son Cavan Thomas (born April 11, 1995); and daughter Quinn Patricia (born 
September 27, 1999). They currently live in Houston. For a while Biggio 
was the head varsity baseball coach at St. Thomas High School.[21] Biggio 
coached St. Thomas to back-to-back Texas Association of Private and Parochial 
Schools (TAPPS) Class 5A state baseball titles in 2010 and 2011. Both of 
Biggio's sons played for the St. Thomas baseball team. Cavan hit a home 
run in the team's 2011 championship game, while older brother Conor provided 
the winning offense in St. Thomas' semi-final victory.[22] In Summer 2012, 
Conor played left field for the North Adams SteepleCats of the New England 
Collegiate Baseball League; in Summer 2013, he played outfield and second 
base for the North Shore Navigators of the Futures Collegiate Baseball 
League. When asked by the Houston Chronicle about the success, the elder 
Biggio replied I don't get too caught up in that...it's not about me it's 
about these kids, and win or lose we're trying to turn these kids into 
men. That's the thing that's most important to me. Biggio and his family 
had a home in Spring Lake, New Jersey that they named "Home Plate".[23] 
Biggio's father-in-law is Assemblyman Joseph V. Egan, a member of the New 
Jersey legislature.[24] Biggio, a fan of the musical group U2, often had 
their song "Mysterious Ways" and "Pride" played as he stepped up to the 
batter's box. Many baseball players, such as Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Carlton, 
and Barry Bonds, bat and throw left-handed while writing right-handed. 
Biggio is a rare example of a baseball player who bats and throws right-handed 
but writes left-handed. Notes: Per Baseball-Reference.com. †– led Major
