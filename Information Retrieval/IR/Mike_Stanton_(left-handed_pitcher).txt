William Michael Stanton (born June 2, 1967) is a former left-handed specialist 
relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who enjoyed success over his career, 
most notably with the Atlanta Braves and New York Yankees. He has the record 
for the most holds in MLB history. Stanton graduated from Midland High 
School (Midland, Texas), where he played baseball, basketball and football. 
He did not however, pitch at all in high school. His first pitching appearance 
came at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas. Stanton also attended 
Alvin Community College. Stanton relied throughout his career on a fastball, 
slider, and curveball.[1] He also developed a two-seam fastball and changeup.[2] 
Stanton was drafted by the Atlanta Braves and he made his major league 
debut in 1989 with the Braves, where he spent the first six years of his 
career. He pitched in 20 games his first year, racking up 27 strikeouts 
and seven saves. Stanton struggled mightily in his sophomore season, going 
0–3 with an ERA of 18.00 in just seven innings (giving up 14 runs).[3] 
1991 was his first year as a full-time player, and he put up a 5–5 record 
in 74 games, earning a spot on the postseason roster. He pitched well, 
allowing just one run in eight total games, including a victory in the 
1991 World Series. In 1992, he went 5–4, (his first season with a record 
over .500).[3] The Braves once again lost the World Series, this time to 
the Toronto Blue Jays, as Stanton allowed three hits and two walks during 
the series. The next year, he fashioned a 4–6 record with a in 63 games, 
but earned a career-high 27 saves.[3] He pitched one inning of one-hit, 
one-walk baseball in the 1993 National League Championship Series. In 1994, 
Stanton fashioned a 3–1 record before the strike ended the season early. 
He was granted free agency following the season, but re-signed on April 
12, 1995. When play resumed in 1995, Stanton pitched in 26 games, garnering 
a 1–1 record and 5.59 ERA before being traded on July 31 to the Boston 
Red Sox. Stanton pitched in 22 games with a 1–0 record and 3.00 ERA in 
1995. He allowed one hit and struck out four in his only postseason appearance. 
In 1996, he fashioned a 4–3 record with a 3.83 ERA before being traded 
to the Texas Rangers. Stanton pitched in 23 games while surrendering eight 
runs. In the 1996 American League Division Series, he pitched in three 
games, earning one loss and surrendering his only postseason home run.[3] 
On October 27, 1996, he was granted free agency, and he signed with the 
Yankees on December 11. Stanton pitched for the New York Yankees for seven 
seasons. During that span, Stanton was a large part of the Yankees World 
Series teams, proving himself in big roles out of the bullpen. He garnered 
a 6–1 record in 1997, and appeared in 64 games.[3] In the 1997 American 
League Division Series, he allowed one hit in one inning while striking 
out three.[3] In 1998, Stanton went 4–1 and collected six saves during 
the Yankees' 114-win season. After not pitching in the Division Series, 
he returned during the Championship Series and allowed two hits and one 
walk while striking out four over three games.[3] In the 1998 World Series, 
Stanton allowed three hits and two earned runs.[3] Despite his lackluster 
performance, he earned a World Series ring as the Yankees swept the Padres 
four games to none. In 1999, he was 2–2 in 73 games, and did not pitch 
in the Division Series. In the Championship Series, he allowed one hit 
in 1/3 of an inning. However, he rebounded in the 1999 World Series, striking 
out the only batter he faced.[3] On November 5, he was granted free agency, 
but re-signed with the Yankees on November 29.[3] In 2000, he was 2–3 with 
a 4.10 ERA over 69 games. He pitched in four innings of one-hit ball in 
the Division Series and did not pitch in the Championship Series.[3] In 
the 2000 World Series, he earned two wins in four games. In 2001, he was 
9–4 with a 2.58 ERA and was selected to the 2001 All-Star team. He pitched 
in all three games of the 2001 American League Division Series and in two 
games of the 2001 American League Championship Series. He pitched in five 
games of the 2001 World Series. His contributions in the postseason during 
this three-year period helped him post the lowest ERA in World Series history 
among relief pitchers. In 2002 he was 7–1 with a 3.00 ERA, and pitched 
in three games in the 2002 American League Division Series allowing three 
runs.[3] He was released on October 30. Stanton was a career-worst 2–7 
with a 4.57 ERA with the Mets in 2003. He posted a 2–6 record in 2004 despite 
rebounding back with a 3.16 ERA.[3] He was traded on December 4 for Félix 
Heredia. August 3, 2004, Stanton struck out four batters in one inning. 
He struck out Gary Bennett, Scott Podsednik (who reached base on an uncaught 
third strike), Trent Durrington and Wes Helms. Stanton pitched in 28 games 
with the Yankees in 2005 with a 7.07 ERA. He was released on July 1. Stanton 
was 2–1 with the Washington Nationals, finishing six games. On September 
29, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox, where he pitched one inning of 
one-hit ball. He was released by the Red Sox on October 12.[3] He re-signed 
with Washington on December 24 and was 3–5 with a 4.47 ERA in 56 games. 
On July 28, 2006 he was traded to the San Francisco Giants. He was 4–2 
with the Giants over 26 games and was released on October 30. On November 
20, 2006 he signed with the Cincinnati Reds. With the Reds, he was 1–3 
with a 5.93 ERA in 69 games. Despite his high salary due in 2008, the Reds 
cut Stanton from the team, going instead with veteran lefty Kent Mercker. 
The Reds would eat $3.5 million in salary to make the cut, including the 
2008 salary and the 2009 option.[4] After being cut by the Reds, Stanton 
signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with 
the Chicago Cubs on January 20, 2009. He did not make the team and was 
released on March 30.[5] In his major league career, Stanton would post 
a 68–63 record with a 3.92 ERA and 84 saves in 1178 games pitched which 
ranks him second all-time in appearances behind Jesse Orosco (1252). Despite 
being a set-up man, Stanton chose to come out of the bullpen to an entrance 
song like many Major League closers do. Stanton usually entered to Aldo 
Nova's "Fantasy". With the New York Mets however, he came in to Metallica's 
"Enter Sandman" during save situations as a tribute to Mariano Rivera, 
whom he set up for in his Yankees years.[6] Mike Stanton is the all time 
holds leader, with 266. The hold is similar to the save, although it is 
not considered an official statistic. Arthur Rhodes is second on the list, 
with more than 40 fewer holds. Stanton was mentioned in the Mitchell Report 
for purchasing human growth hormone, implicated by Kirk Radomski.[7] Stanton 
has flatly denied any wrongdoing or any connection to any type of performance-enhancing 
drugs in his baseball career. Stanton's alleged HGH use was also mentioned
