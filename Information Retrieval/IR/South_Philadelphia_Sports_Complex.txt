The South Philadelphia Sports Complex is the current home of Philadelphia's 
professional sports teams. It is the site of the Wells Fargo Center, Lincoln 
Financial Field, Citizens Bank Park, and the retail/entertainment center 
Xfinity Live!. The South Philadelphia Sports Complex was also once home 
to John F. Kennedy Stadium, Veterans Stadium and the Spectrum. Prior to 
its development, it was a shanty town known as "The Neck" of the undeveloped 
League Island area, formerly Passyunk Township. Oregon Avenue was the southern 
border end of the city up to the 1920s. In 1926 the City selected the area 
south of Oregon Avenue for the 1926 Sesquicentennial International Exposition 
and developed the large river delta land south of Oregon Avenue. South 
Broad Street was a grand European-styled boulevard surrounded by massive 
exhibit buildings and structures that were to be a testament to American 
science, culture, and progress for the future. Following the close of the 
celebration of this 150 years of American Independence on the Avenue of 
the Colonies of South Broad Street came quick total demolition except of 
the stadium. Prior to building Veterans Stadium across Packer Avenue north 
of JFK Stadium was family entertainment of a bowling alley, and a drive-in 
theater that was a venue created by Camden, New Jersey, chemical company 
magnate Richard M. Hollingshead, Jr., whose family owned and operated the 
R.M. Hollingshead Corporation chemical plant in Camden and that peaked 
in popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. AT&T Station on SEPTA's Broad Street 
Line is within walking distance of the three venues in the area. It was 
once known as Pattison Station until it was renamed AT&T Station under 
a naming rights agreement in 2010. Citizens Bank Park (2004–present) Lincoln
