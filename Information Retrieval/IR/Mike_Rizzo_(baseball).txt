Michael Anthony Rizzo (born December 14, 1960) is an American baseball 
front office executive who is the general manager and president of baseball 
operations of the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
After a brief playing career in minor league baseball, Rizzo transitioned 
into coaching and scouting. He became the director of scouting for the 
Arizona Diamondbacks in 2000. Rizzo joined the Nationals in 2007 as an 
assistant general manager. He succeeded Jim Bowden as the Nationals' general 
manager in 2009, and was promoted to team president in 2013. Rizzo grew 
up in Chicago as one of four children. His father, Phil, was a former minor 
league baseball player who drove a truck for the city and scouted for the 
California Angels on a part-time basis. The Angels made him a full-time 
scout, as many of the players he identified reached the majors.[1] Rizzo 
attended Holy Cross High School in River Grove, Illinois and Saint Xavier 
University, where he played college baseball for the Saint Xavier Cougars.[2] 
The Angels drafted Rizzo in the 22nd round, with the 554th overall selection, 
in the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft.[1] He played for the Salem Angels 
(Class A Short Season), Peoria Suns (Class A) and Redwood Pioneers (Class 
A Advanced) from 1982 to 1984. After the 1984 season, the Angels released 
Rizzo. His father suggested that he was not skilled enough to reach the 
major leagues, and advised he attend college.[1] Rizzo became an assistant 
coach at the University of Illinois.[1] Larry Himes, the scout who drafted 
Rizzo, became the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, and he hired 
Rizzo as a scout for the Upper Midwest region.[1] He also scouted for the 
Boston Red Sox. Rizzo joined the Arizona Diamondbacks when the franchise 
was created in 1998, and served as the Director of Scouting for the Diamondbacks 
from 2000 to 2006.[1][3] Seeking to replace Joe Garagiola, Jr. as the Diamondbacks' 
general manager, the team chose Josh Byrnes over Rizzo.[1] As a result, 
Rizzo joined the Washington Nationals organization, when he was appointed 
Assistant General Manager/Vice President of Baseball Operations by Jim 
Bowden on July 24, 2006.[4] This move coincided with the franchise's ownership 
transfer from Major League Baseball to a Washington, D.C.-based investment 
group headed by Ted Lerner.[5] Three days after Bowden's sudden resignation 
on March 1, 2009,[6] Rizzo was promoted on an interim basis by team president 
Stan Kasten.[7] He was named the full-time Senior Vice President/General 
Manager on August 20, 2009.[8] On October 19, 2010 Rizzo got a five-year 
extension and was promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations 
and General Manager.[9] The last two years of this contract were club options.[10] 
Rizzo decided to shut down ace pitcher Stephen Strasburg late in the 2012 
season as he recovered from Tommy John surgery from the year before.[11] 
The Nationals promoted Rizzo to President of Baseball Operations during 
the 2013 season.[12] In 2016 the team picked up its option to extend Rizzo's
