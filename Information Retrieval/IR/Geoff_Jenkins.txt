Geoff Jenkins (born July 21, 1974) is a former outfielder in Major League 
Baseball. He played for the Milwaukee Brewers from 1998 to 2007 and the 
Philadelphia Phillies in 2008. Jenkins is fourth on the Brewers all-time 
career home run list trailing only Hall-of-Famer Robin Yount, former MVP 
Ryan Braun, and former first baseman Prince Fielder.[1] He is currently 
on the coaching staff of the Peoria Explorers in the Freedom Pro Baseball 
League.[citation needed] Jenkins attended Cordova High School in Rancho 
Cordova, California, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. 
He was selected for the all-state baseball team as a junior and senior 
before graduating in 1992.[2] At USC, Jenkins had a standout career from 
1993 through 1995. In his final season, he batted .399 with 78 RBI and 
a .748 slugging percentage in 70 games, also scoring 75 runs to tie the 
school record held by Rich Dauer and Mark McGwire; his 23 home runs and 
193 total bases ranked second in school history behind McGwire's 1984 totals 
of 32 and 216. He led the Trojans to the College World Series, where they 
reached the championship game; Jenkins was named to the all-CWS team, and 
also earned team co-MVP honors and was named a consensus All-American. 
In 1996, the year of the CWS' 50th tournament, Jenkins was named to the 
all-decade team for the 1990s. He finished his USC career with a .369 batting 
average, 45 home runs (second only to McGwire's 54), a .652 slugging percentage, 
180 runs, and school records for runs batted in (175) and total bases (444). 
Jenkins was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round (9th overall) 
in the 1995 amateur draft. He spent the 1995–98 seasons within the Milwaukee 
farm system, and made his Major League debut with the Brewers as an early 
season call-up in 1998.[3] On April 24, 1998, he singled off Orel Hershiser, 
in his first career plate appearance against the San Francisco Giants and 
hit a fifth-inning home run off Hersheiser in his third career plate appearance.[4] 
On September 23 that same year, in the midst of a tense Wild Card race, 
Jenkins hit the routine fly ball that Brant Brown of the Chicago Cubs dropped 
allowing three runs to score and the Brewers to win. Jenkins would go on 
to bat over .300 in his 2nd and 3rd seasons, driving in 90 or more runs 
three times for one of the perennially weaker teams in the league. In 2000, 
he was the Brewers' team MVP. He led the Brewers in batting average (.303) 
and home runs (34). His 2002 season was cut short when on June 17 in a 
game against the Houston Astros he suffered a horrific-looking dislocated 
ankle when sliding into third base feet first during a game. He was safe 
on the play. He was selected to the National League's All-Star team in 
2003 via the MLB's All-Star Final Vote contest where a player is selected 
from both leagues by fans to join their respective team after the initial 
roster is announced. On June 8, 2004, he became the 8th player in Major 
League history to strike out six times in a single game. After playing 
in left field for virtually his entire career, he moved to right field 
for the 2005 and 2006 seasons when Milwaukee acquired Carlos Lee. In 2006, 
Jenkins experienced a prolonged offensive slump, struggling in particular 
against left-handed pitching. In August 2006, the Brewers benched Jenkins, 
one of their highest-paid players at the time, in favor of the younger 
Corey Hart. In 2007, Jenkins returned to left field to platoon with Kevin 
Mench. On October 30, 2007, the Brewers officially declined their $9 million 
option on Jenkins' contract, making him a free agent for the 2008 season.[5] 
On December 20, 2007, he signed a two-year, $13 million deal with a vesting 
option for 2010 with the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] Jenkins returned to 
Miller Park in a Phillies uniform on April 23, 2008, to a crowd of just 
over 30,000. He was welcomed back with a tribute video, highlighting his 
ten-year career with the Brewers, and the standing ovation that followed. 
He received a second ovation while leading off the second inning. Philadelphia 
would go on to lose the game, 5–4. He went 0 for 3, with a walk and a stolen 
base. In the postseason, his only hit came on a leadoff double in the bottom 
of the 6th in Game 5 of the World Series. His hit set the tone for the 
finale of the World Series as the Phillies won the World Series and earned 
Jenkins his first World Series ring of his ten-year career. Jenkins was 
released by the Phillies at the end of spring training on March 31, 2009.[7] 
On July 9, 2010, Jenkins retired from baseball as a Milwaukee Brewer.[8][9]
