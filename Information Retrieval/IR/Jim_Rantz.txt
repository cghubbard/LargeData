James John Rantz (born February 24, 1938, at Saint Paul, Minnesota) is 
an American former professional baseball player and executive. He was the 
Minnesota Twins' farm system director from 1986–2012, holding the title 
of "Director of Minor Leagues." When he retired after his 27th consecutive 
season in the post, Rantz was one of the longest-tenured farm system directors 
in Major League Baseball; it was his 53rd consecutive season with the Twins' 
organization. From 1971 through 1985, Rantz was assistant minor league 
director under George Brophy.[1] As such, during his career, he sent multiple 
generations of home-grown players to the Twins, and contributed materially 
to the team's 1987 and 1991 world titles and its run of playoff teams during 
the first decade of the 21st century. A 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 175 lb (79 kg) 
right-handed relief pitcher, Rantz attended Washington High School in St. 
Paul (now Washington Technical Magnet School) and then walked on at the 
University of Minnesota where he pitched (for Dick Siebert) and played 
hockey (for John Mariucci).[2] Despite never having started a game in his 
collegiate (or later professional) career, Rantz pitched a complete game 
in the Gophers 2-1, 10 inning victory which gave Minnesota the 1960 College 
World Series title[3] over the University of Southern California.[2] He 
signed with the original Washington Senators in 1960 — a year before the 
franchise shifted to Minnesota. Rantz compiled a 22–16 won–loss mark with 
a 3.64 earned run average in five minor-league seasons.[4] After serving 
as manager for the St. Cloud Rox, the Twins' affiliate in the Class A Northern 
League, for one season (1965), he moved into the club's front office in 
1965. Originally hired by Brophy (then serving as the assistant director 
of farm clubs for the Twins) as an intern in the Twins' Media Relations 
department during the 1965 World Series, Rantz moved over four years later 
to work under Brophy. Other than a one-year stint in 1977 as manager of 
the Wisconsin Rapids Twins of the Class A Midwest League, Rantz worked 
for Brophy for the next 16 years. Following Brophy's retirement from the 
Twins in 1985 due to health problems, Rantz was promoted to succeed him 
as Director of Minor League Operations. In recognition of his accomplishments 
as the team's player development boss for 22 years, Rantz was inducted 
into the Minnesota Twins Hall of Fame in 2007.[5] On October 15, 2012, 
the Twins announced that Rantz would retire from his post at the end of
