Richard William "Dickie" Thon (born June 20, 1958) is an American former 
professional baseball shortstop, who played for the California Angels, 
Houston Astros, San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers, 
and Milwaukee Brewers during his 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career. 
Thon was raised in Puerto Rico after spending only the first two weeks 
of his life in Indiana where his father had just completed a bachelor's 
degree at the University of Notre Dame. He was signed by the California 
Angels as an amateur free agent on November 23, 1975 while in high school 
in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. During his 15-year career, Thon spent two 
seasons with the Angels (1979–1980), seven seasons with the Houston Astros 
(1981–1987), one season with the San Diego Padres (1988), three seasons 
with the Philadelphia Phillies (1989–1991), one season with the Texas Rangers 
(1992), and finished his career with the Milwaukee Brewers (1993). Touted 
by some as a future Hall of Famer,[1] his career was permanently altered 
on April 8, 1984, when he was hit in the face by Mike Torrez's fastball.[2] 
The pitch broke the orbital bone around his left eye and ended his 1984 
season. He returned in 1985, but suffered from problems with depth perception 
that permanently hampered his potential.[3] In 1991, Thon received the 
Tony Conigliaro Award in recognition of his recovery from this severe injury. 
Thon is a third-generation baseball player. He is the grandson of Freddie 
Thon Sr., a native Puerto Rican who played and managed in the Puerto Rican 
Baseball League during World War II. His father Freddie Thon Jr., who signed 
a major-league contract but injured his arm before reporting to training, 
played semi-pro baseball while finishing college at Notre Dame, and coached 
all of his sons throughout their Little League and teenage years. Dickie's 
brother Frankie Thon is also affiliated with major league baseball in both 
the U.S. and Puerto Rico having been a player, a manager and a current 
major-league scout, as well as the general manager of the Criollos de Caguas 
in the Puerto Rican League. Thon's son, Dickie Joe Thon, was selected by 
the Toronto Blue Jays in the 5th round, 156th overall in the June 2010 
baseball draft and played the 2016 season for the Dunedin Blue Jays.[4] 
Thon was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame
