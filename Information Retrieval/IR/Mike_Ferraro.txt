As Player As Coach As Manager Michael Dennis Ferraro (born August 18, 1944 
in Kingston, New York) is an American former Major League Baseball third 
baseman. He played for the New York Yankees (1966; 1968), Seattle Pilots 
(1969), and the Milwaukee Brewers (1972). Ferraro threw and batted right-handed, 
stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). Ferraro 
was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the Yankees, where he 
would have two stints in the Majors with New York. He was left unprotected 
in the 1968 expansion draft, and he was selected by the Seattle Pilots, 
but after only five games and four at-bats, he was traded to the Baltimore 
Orioles, where he spent two years in the minors. However, in 1971, he was 
traded back to the Brewers (the Pilots moved to Milwaukee after only one 
season in Seattle), where he would play his only season as a regular player. 
In 1973, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins, but was promptly released. 
He tried one last comeback with the Yankees in 1974, but he never made 
it back to the Majors. He turned to managing in the Yankee farm system 
in 1974, and he was highly successful in his five-year career (through 
1978), winning pennants at Class A, Double-A and Triple-A levels. He was 
the Yankees' Major League third-base coach in 1979–80, but his tenure in 
that post included some controversy. After Game 2 of the 1980 American 
League Championship Series, owner George Steinbrenner publicly criticized 
him for waving home runner Willie Randolph, who was thrown out at home 
plate for the final out of the eighth inning with Kansas City leading New 
York, 3–2. Steinbrenner wanted Ferraro fired summarily, but he remained 
at his post through the end of the LCS, which New York lost. Then, his 
manager, Dick Howser, resigned over the Ferraro brouhaha. Ironically, Ferraro 
ultimately returned to New York as a coach in 1981–82, and again in 1987–88 
and 1990–91. Ferraro got his first managerial job with the Cleveland Indians 
to replace Dave Garcia after the 1982 season, but after a 40–60 start in 
1983, he was fired. Ferraro coached with the Kansas City Royals from 1984 
to 1986, working again with Howser, and when Howser stepped down to undergo 
treatment for a brain tumor in July 1986, Ferraro (himself a survivor of 
kidney cancer) finished the season. His Major League managerial record 
was 76–98 over parts of two seasons. He also worked as the third base coach
