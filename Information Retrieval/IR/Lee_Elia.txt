Pennsylvania, to Constantine D. and Florence C. (Soulas) Elia. His father, 
Connie Elia, was born in Albania and emigrated to the United States in 
1920. He worked as a supervisor for a food service for 30 years. Elia also 
grew up with a younger sister, Diane. Elia graduated from Olney High School 
in Philadelphia and the University of Delaware. Elia played most of his 
career through the minor league system. He was signed as an undrafted free 
agent to his hometown team the Philadelphia Phillies in 1958 as a shortstop. 
He played eleven seasons in the minor leagues and nine of those seasons 
being in AAA. He played in the Phillies minor league system for six years, 
totaling 72 home runs, about 300 runs batted in (RBI) and a .260 combined 
batting average. He was then signed by the Chicago White Sox organization 
in 1965. He played out the entire 1965 season in AAA, and began the 1966 
season in AAA as well, before being called up to the Major Leagues. He 
was on the roster with the 1966 Chicago White Sox season for 80 games in 
the 1966 season, and played in 77 of those. He played shortstop in 75 of 
those games. That season he hit .205 with three home runs and 22 RBI. That 
1966 White Sox team finished fourth in the American League with a record 
of 83–79. The following season he was dealt to the National League's Chicago 
Cubs. He played the 1967 season in the minors and finished with 14 home 
runs, 59 RBI and a batting average of .267. The following season he was 
called up to the Cubs major league roster, only appearing in fifteen games 
racking up only three RBI and a .176 batting average. After the season 
he played in twenty AAA games, three with the Cubs and seventeen with the 
Yankees. Shortly after he stopped playing baseball before coming back at 
the age of 35 in 1973 and playing AAA ball with the Phillies. However, 
he only appeared in 16 games and retired after. He was efficient in the 
field with a career fielding percentage of about .940. Elia was hired as 
a bench coach for the 1980 and 1981 Philadelphia Phillies major league 
team. They finished the season NL East Champions with a 91–71 record, one 
game ahead of the Montreal Expos. That season he helped lead the Phillies 
under manager Dallas Green to the peak of all the sport, a 1980 World Series 
Championship. The following year in 1981 the Phillies finished with a 59–48 
record. The won the NL East first half with a 34–21 record, however finished 
third in the second half with a 25–27 record. They still qualified for 
the playoffs however and were matched up with the NL East second half winners, 
the Montreal Expos. The series went to all five games and the Expos knocked 
out the defending Champions 3–2 in the NLDS. Some notable players he coached 
in these two years with the Phillies include Larry Bowa, Pete Rose, Mike 
Schmidt, and Ryne Sandberg. Elia was hired once again as a Phillies bench 
coach in 1985 and 1986. In 1985 his Phillies finished 75-87, which was 
fifth in the NL East. Then in 1986 they finished 86–75, good for second 
place in the NL East however they finished a remarkable 21.5 games back 
of the New York Mets who were 108–54. Elia was still a bench coach through 
the first 61 games of the 1987 season, but the Phillies were 29–32 at that 
point and manager John Felske had been fired mid-season. Elia was hired 
as the replacement manager. Since ending his managing career he has worked 
as many different smaller positions within organizations. He was special 
assistant to the manager, scout, and hitting coach with the Seattle Mariners. 
After that he was a special assistant to the general manager, and scout 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was also a bench coach and scout in the 
Baltimore Orioles organization. In 1975, at the age of 37, Elia had begun 
his managing career in the Western Carolinas League with the Spartanburg 
Phillies (Single-A). After his first season of managing he led his team 
to a league best 81–59 record. The following season the team took a bit 
of a nosedive and finished with a 59–80 record. In the 1977 season Elia 
was promoted as the manager of the AA Reading Phillies in the Eastern League. 
He managed his team to a 63–75 finish, which was good for third place in 
the Can-Am Division. Notable players he managed on this team were 1980 
World Series Champions Kevin Saucier and Keith Moreland. During the 1978 
season Elia remained head man in Reading and turned it around significantly. 
They finished the 1978 season with a 79–57 record, which was good for second 
in the league and only 1.5 games back of the first place Yankees. In 1979 
he was named manager of the Phillies AAA affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers. 
The 89ers finished with a 72–63 record and won the west division. They 
went on to play the Evansville Triplets (Detroit Tigers affiliate) in the 
American Association Championship Series. They lost the series in six games 
as the Jim Leyland led Evansville team won the league. A notable player 
on this roster was Lonnie Smith who was a 1982 All Star and a three-time 
World Series champion left fielder. In 1982 at the age of 44 Elia was hired 
as the manager of the Chicago Cubs. He was hired by Dallas Green, who had 
been his manager the previous two years in Philadelphia. That season they 
brought players such as Ryne Sandberg, Keith Moreland, and Dickie Noles 
over from the Phillies roster. They finished the season with a 73–89 record 
and finished fifth out of six in the NL East. Elia is often remembered 
for a profanity-laced tirade directed at the fans at Wrigley Field on April 
29, 1983. After the Cubs suffered a one-run home loss to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Elia made post-game remarks to four reporters—the Chicago Tribune's 
Robert Marcus, the Chicago Sun-Times' Joel Behrig, the Daily Herald's Don 
Friske and WLS-AM's Les Grobstein (who recorded it with the only microphone 
that was in the room)—in which he blasted Cubs fans in the stands for booing 
and heckling the team: After being fired by the Cubs, he was hired as manager 
for the AAA Portland Beavers (Phillies Organization) in the Pacific Coast 
League. Elia's tenure in Portland is perhaps best remembered for his role 
in an unusual incident during a May 30, 1984 game against the Vancouver 
Canadians - Elia was ejected for arguing a called third strike and subsequently 
threw a chair onto the field before leaving the dugout. This in turn led 
to the ejection of the team's batboy Sam Morris after, acting on instructions 
from Beavers players still in the dugout, the batboy refused an umpire's 
demand that he retrieve the chair Elia had thrown on the field. Elia led 
the Beavers to a 62–78 record. He was hired as a bench coach for the Phillies 
the next season. In 1987, 61 games into the season, Elia was hired as manager 
for the 29–32 Phillies. He proceeded to lead the team to an 80-82 record 
to finish fourth in the NL East. The team was 51–50 that season once he 
took over as manager. He remained the head man in 1988, but a very disappointing 
season led to his firing once again as manager. They finished with a 65–96 
record and that was good for last place in the NL East. He was named manager 
of the Clearwater Phillies for the 1990 and 1991. In his first season he 
led the team to a 50–87 record. In the following season, he made a dramatic 
turnaround with the team as they finished with an 81–49 record. In 1992, 
at age 54, he was hired as the manager of the Phillies AAA affiliate Scranton/Wilkes-Barre 
Red Barons of the International League. He led the team to an 84–58 record 
before retiring from being a manager. He was inducted into the Pennsylvania 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2000. Elia resides in Odessa, Florida, with his
