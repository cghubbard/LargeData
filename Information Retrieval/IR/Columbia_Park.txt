Columbia Park or Columbia Avenue Grounds was a baseball park in Philadelphia. 
It was built in 1901 as the first home of the Philadelphia Athletics, who 
played there for eight seasons, including two games of the 1905 World Series. 
Columbia Park fell into disuse after the Athletics' move in 1909 to the 
larger Shibe Park, and was demolished in the 1910s. Columbia Park was built 
in 1901 by the Philadelphia Athletics when the team was established, in 
the creation of the American League. The site was a vacant lot on which 
manager and part-owner Connie Mack obtained a ten-year lease.[2] It occupied 
the block bordered by 29th Street, Oxford Street, 30th Street, and Columbia 
Avenue (since renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue, in honor of the civil rights 
leader). The cost of construction was $35,000. The stadium was very small, 
and originally had a seating capacity of only 9,500. This was eventually 
increased to 13,600 by the addition of bleacher seating in the outfield. 
During some sold out games, unofficial additional seating could be found 
on top of the adjoining homes. There was only one dressing room, for the 
home team; visiting teams had to change at their hotels. Although the ballpark 
was in Philadelphia's Brewerytown section, beer sales were prohibited. 
The opening game in Columbia Park was held on April 26, 1901, after the 
first two games were rained out. The Athletics played the Washington Senators 
in front of an overflow crowd of 10,524, with some fans standing on the 
outfield walls and the roofs of nearby houses. The Athletics lost 5-1, 
despite three hits by second baseman Nap Lajoie.[3] During their tenure 
at Columbia Park, the Athletics won the American League pennant twice. 
The first time was in 1902, before the institution of the modern World 
Series. Three years later the Athletics won again and faced the New York 
Giants in the 1905 World Series. The Giants won the series 4 games to 1. 
Games 1 and 3 were held at Columbia Park. Both were shutout victories for 
Giants future hall of famer Christy Mathewson.[4] The Athletics leased 
the ballpark to the independent Negro League club, the Philadelphia Giants. 
The Giants played at the ballpark while the Athletics were on the road. 
The Giants were the first club to play night baseball in Philadelphia when 
they played under portable lights on June 4, 1902. The Philadelphia Phillies 
temporarily called Columbia Park home in 1903 while Baker Bowl was repaired 
after a balcony collapse on August 8, 1903.[5] The Phillies played sixteen 
games at Columbia Park in August and September 1903.[6] The stadium also 
briefly served as the home of the Philadelphia Athletics football club, 
before the team folded in 1902. The final game played at the park took 
place on October 3, 1908; the visiting Boston Americans defeated the Athletics 
5-0 in the second game of a doubleheader. The lack of seating at Columbia 
Park was the main reason the Athletics left for Shibe Park. The sod from 
Columbia Park was transplanted to Shibe Park after the 1908 season.[7] 
After the Athletics left, the park was almost entirely abandoned. Columbia 
Park was eventually demolished in the 1910s to make way for new homes.
