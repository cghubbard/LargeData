Glenn Erick Braggs (born October 17, 1962)[1] is a former Major League 
Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball outfielder and designated hitter. 
Braggs was a member of the Cincinnati Reds team that defeated the Oakland 
Athletics in the 1990 World Series. He is an alumnus of the University 
of Hawaii at Manoa. Drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2nd round of 
the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft, Braggs made his major league debut 
with the Brewers on July 18, 1986. Starting in left field and batting fifth, 
Braggs went 1-4 in a 6-1 road loss to the Oakland Athletics. His first 
career hit was a sixth-inning single off Joaquin Andujar.[2] He hit the 
first of his 70 career home runs on August 2, 1986 with a two-run shot 
off Charlie Hough.[3] He had his best season in 1989, hitting 15 home runs 
with 66 runs batted in (RBI) and 17 stolen bases with a .247 batting average.[4] 
On June 9, 1990, during his fourth season with the Brewers, he was traded 
to the Cincinnati Reds. He played a key role as the Reds advanced to the 
National League playoffs. In 231 plate appearances, he hit six home runs 
with 28 RBI and a .299 average. In the National League Championship Series 
against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he went 1-for-5 but had a huge impact on 
the series. In the ninth inning of game six with one on and one out and 
the Reds leading 2-1, Braggs robbed Carmelo Martinez of a possible home 
run, reaching up and snaring a long fly as his back hit the wall, for the 
2nd out of the inning. The Reds advanced to the World Series.[5] In the 
World Series, he went 0-for-4 but had two RBI and one base on balls as 
the Reds won the World Series over the heavily favored Oakland Athletics.[4] 
He played two more seasons for the Reds, last appearing in a game on September 
10, 1992. Braggs was known for his upper body strength, and in fact once 
snapped a bat on a check swing. When he stopped his swing, he put so much 
force on the bat to stop it that it sheared off just above the grip, without 
ever touching the ball. In the second inning of Game 4 of the 1990 World 
Series, he swung so hard at a pitch from the A's Dave Stewart that the 
bat broke on his back on the follow-through.[6] He appeared in his final 
game on September 10, 1992. Glenn Braggs is married to Cindy Herron, also 
known as Cindy Herron-Braggs, an original member of the female R&B group 
En Vogue. They have four children. He is now a real estate agent in the
