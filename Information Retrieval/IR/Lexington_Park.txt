-93.14886 Lexington Park was the name of a former minor league baseball 
park in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was the home of the St. Paul Saints from 
1897 through 1956, when it was replaced by the first version of Midway 
Stadium. Lexington Park was commissioned by baseball owner Charlie Comiskey 
to serve as home for his St. Paul Saints Western League baseball franchise. 
In late 1899 the league changed its name to the American League in an ultimately 
successful bid to gain major league status. While the Saints were initially 
a member of that league, Comiskey moved his team to Chicago prior to Opening 
Day 1900 (where they still exist today as the Chicago White Sox). As such, 
the ballpark holds at least the technical distinction of being the original 
home to a current American League franchise—even if, admittedly, the league 
wasn't major at the time, and not a single major league game was ever played 
there. Comiskey continued to own the ballpark for another decade or so 
(leasing it out to a replacement American Association club), until finally 
selling it to local interests in 1909. It was on the block bounded by Lexington 
Parkway, University Avenue, Fuller and Dunlap. Home plate was originally 
in the southwest corner of the block. Following a fire in 1915, a steel 
and concrete grandstand was built with the plate repositioned to the northwest 
corner. Lights were installed in 1937. The 6-decades-old ballpark did not 
quite go out in a wave of euphoria the way its Twin Cities cousin Nicollet 
Park did, but the Saints did manage to defeat the arch-rival Minneapolis 
Millers in the final game. Although demolished in the 1950s, elements of 
the park remain in existence to this day. A significant segment of the 
southwestern foundation can still be seen by the knowledgeable observer, 
and as late as the 1990s a grocery store on the site (since demolished) 
preserved the location of Lexington's home plate with a distinctively-shaped 
commemorative floor tile. The area is currently being redeveloped. An Aldi 
grocery store is one of the most recent additions to the site. According 
to Stew Thornley's 2006 book, a plaque that had once been affixed to the
