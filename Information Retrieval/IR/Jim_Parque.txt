James Vo Parque (born February 8, 1976) is a former Major League Baseball 
pitcher for the Chicago White Sox and Tampa Bay Devil Rays from 1998 to 
2003. Jim Parque grew up poor in Southern California. His father made less 
than US$20,000 per year and his mother, a Vietnamese immigrant, worked 
at a textiles factory in Chinatown, Los Angeles.[1][2] On this income, 
Parque's parents struggled to provide for Parque and his brother. Parque 
himself had to work in a sweatshop in Los Angeles as a young boy.[2] Parque 
attended Crescenta Valley High School where he was mentored by former All-Star 
pitcher Jerry Reuss.[3] As a senior, Parque compiled a 12–3 record and 
was voted the Pacific League Player of the Year and MVP.[4] He also broke 
the school's strikeout record. Parque began his high school baseball career 
at 5'1" tall and roughly 110 pounds; the school was unable to find a jersey 
small enough to fit him.[5] By the time he graduated, he still stood at 
only 5'5" and weighed 132 pounds.[1] Although he was recruited by such 
college baseball teams as the USC Trojans, UCLA Bruins and Miami Hurricanes, 
professional scouts showed little interest in him because of his size.[5] 
Parque was not selected until the 50th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball 
draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. From 1994 to 1997, Parque attended UCLA 
and led the Bruins to the College World Series in 1997.[6] Parque earned 
second-team Smith Super Team honors in his sophomore season in 1996.[6] 
In his junior year, Parque was voted first-team All-American by Baseball 
America, first-team All-Pac-10 Conference, second-team by the Sporting 
News, second-team by the American Baseball Coaches Association, and third-team 
by Collegiate Baseball.[6] Parque is one of the most decorated pitchers 
in UCLA Baseball history.[6] He currently ranks second in career games 
started with 50, second in career total innings pitched with 334 2⁄3 innings, 
second in career strikeouts with 319, third in career pitching wins with 
25, and seventh in career complete games with 10.[6] In terms of single 
season pitching records for the Bruins, Parque ranks third in wins with 
13 in 1997, ninth for games started with 19 in 1997, ninth for innings 
pitched with 125 2⁄3 in 1996, fourth in strikeouts with 119 in 1997, and 
fifth in strikeouts with 116 in 1996.[6] In the 1997 supplemental draft 
he was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 1st round.[6][7] Parque 
made his major league debut the following year, pitching in 21 starts for 
the White Sox. He had an ERA of 5.10 with a 7-5 record in 113 innings. 
In 1999, Parque finished the season with a 9-15 record in 30 starts. He 
enjoyed his best season in 2000, going 13–6 with a 4.28 ERA in 33 games 
(32 starts). The 2001 season saw Parque pitch in 5 starts only after suffering 
a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the rest of the season. Parque 
began the 2002 season in the minors building up arm strength after his 
2001 shoulder surgery.[8] Parque was not the same after shoulder surgery, 
his 2002 season saw him pitch to an ERA of 9.95 in 8 games (4 starts) while 
walking 16 batters in just 25 innings. Parque was let go after the 2002 
season. After numerous shoulder injuries between 2001 and 2002, Parque 
signed a minor league with the Devil Rays in 2003.[9] He was released after 
posting a whopping 11.94 ERA in 5 starts.[10] In January, 2004, Parque 
signed a minor league deal with the Diamondbacks.[11] On June 24, 2004, 
he announced his retirement after playing seven seasons of professional 
baseball due to his recurring arm injury from 2000. After being out of 
baseball for three years, Parque announced his willingness to return to 
the game of baseball. He started his return by instructing lessons for 
the Cook County Cheetas in Oak Lawn. The Chicago Tribune reported that 
he threw his fastball in the range of 90 mph. On February 2, 2007, he signed 
a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He was released by Seattle 
on May 31, 2007. He has since been linked to steroids in December 2007, 
though he denied the account in the Seattle Times.[12] In a July 23, 2009 
article in the Chicago Sun-Times, Parque admitted using human growth hormone 
while rehabbing from a shoulder injury in 2003. At the time, HGH had not
