William Dale Goodman (March 22, 1926 â€“ October 1, 1984) was an American 
Major League Baseball (MLB) infielder who played sixteen seasons for the 
Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, and Houston Colt 
.45s, from 1947 through 1962. Goodman was inducted into the Boston Red 
Sox Hall of Fame in November 2004.[1] Goodman was an outstanding hitter 
and fielder, he was one of the most versatile players of his era. He played 
every position in the major leagues except catcher and pitcher and was 
an All-Star for two seasons. In 1950, he won the American League (AL) batting 
title hitting .354 with 68 runs batted in (RBI) and was the AL Most Valuable 
Player runner-up to New York Yankees shortstop Phil Rizzuto (hit .324 with 
66 RBI). Goodman batted over .290 in eleven seasons including over .300 
in five seasons. In 1959, he hit .304, helping the White Sox win the AL 
Pennant championship. His career .376 on-base percentage made him an ideal 
lead-off hitter. He was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of 
Fame in 1969.[2] Goodman was born in Concord, North Carolina, and played 
Textile League baseball in Concord before signing with the Atlanta Crackers 
of the Southern Association in 1944 at just eighteen years old.[3] Goodman 
hit .336 his first season in Atlanta. He left baseball temporarily, serving 
in the United States Navy during World War II in 1945. While assigned to 
the Pacific Theater on Ulithi with Major Leaguer Mickey Vernon and future 
Baseball Hall of Famer, Larry Doby, both Goodman and Vernon encouraged 
Doby to become a Major League baseball player. Goodman returned to the 
Atlanta Crackers in 1946 to bat .389 and lead his team to the Southern 
Association's playoff series championship. On February 8, 1947, he was 
sold to the Boston Red Sox.[4] Goodman entered his first Spring training 
battling Sam Mele for the open right field job.[5] With Mele winning the 
job, Goodman batted .182 in limited play through May of the 1947 season 
before being reassigned to the American Association's Louisville Colonels, 
where he batted .340 over the remainder of the season. Goodman spent the 
Spring with the Red Sox in 1947 playing in 12 games, 2 in the outfield, 
and 10 filling in at second base for an injured Bobby Doerr,[6] He made 
his first start as a Major League third baseman on May 20, 1948 1948.[7][8] 
From there, Goodman moved across the diamond to first base for the remainder 
of the season in the Majors. He batted .310 with 66 runs batted in as a 
rookie. His first Major League home run, and only home run of the season, 
was a grand slam off the Detroit Tigers' Virgil Trucks.[9] He was named 
to the first of two American League All-Star rosters in 1949, and appeared 
during the bottom of the 8th inning of the All-Star Game as a defensive 
replacement for Washington Senators first baseman Eddie Robinson.[10] Early 
in the 1950 season, Goodman suffered a chip fracture in his left ankle 
that cost him a month of play.[11] Power hitting rookie first baseman Walt 
Dropo earned himself a place in the everyday starting line-up in Goodman's 
absence, batting .348 with ten home runs and 33 RBIs. Goodman found himself 
without a starting position upon his return, however, injuries to Bobby 
Doerr and third baseman Johnny Pesky kept Goodman in the line-up semi-regularly. 
After Ted Williams injured himself in the All-Star game,[12] Goodman took 
over in left field for the Bosox, and batted .338 with 23 RBIs filling 
in for the Boston legend. Playing five different positions over the course 
of the season, Goodman logged enough at-bats to win the American League 
batting title with a .354 batting average (Stan Musial, National League, 
.346) with 68 RBI and was the runner-up in AL Most Valuable Player Award 
balloting to New York Yankees shortstop, Phil Rizzuto who hit .324 with 
66 RBI; Yankee catcher Yogi Berra finished 3rd in the voting hitting .322 
with 124 RBI. Goodman resumed his utility player role in 1951. He began 
the season playing first base when Dropo fractured his right wrist.[13] 
He shifted over to right field upon Dropo's return, but was back at first 
when Dropo was optioned to the Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres 
at the end of June for "more work."[14] He spent most of the month of August 
at second base when Bobby Doerr's bad back kept him out of the line-up. 
In all, Goodman played five different positions, and batted .297 with fifty 
RBIs and 92 runs scored. His 638 plate appearances were third highest on 
the team behind Dom DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Doerr retired at the end 
of the season,[15] opening a regular position for Goodman at second base 
in 1952. He batted over .300 each of the next three seasons, and was moved 
into the lead-off spot in manager Lou Boudreau's batting order in 1953, 
where he would remain for the rest of his career in Boston. He was elected 
to start the All-Star Game as a second baseman that season despite being 
sidelined for a month by one of the more bizarre baseball injuries. While 
arguing with first base umpire Jim Duffy, Goodman was restrained by teammate 
Jim Piersall. Piersall pulled Goodman toward the dugout, and in doing so, 
strained Goodman's rib cartilage.[16] In 1954, Goodman returned to his 
"jack of all trades" role with the Bosox. After starting the season at 
second, he moved over to third when the Sox traded George Kell to the Chicago 
White Sox.[17] He moved to left field when Ted Williams was sidelined by 
a virus infection in his right lung.[18] Upon Williams' return, he began 
platooning at first with Harry Agganis (despite the fact that both were 
left-handed batters) until he was shifted back to second base in the beginning 
of August. He had a starting job at second base again in 1955, and led 
the team with 100 runs scored while logging a team high 719 plate appearances. 
Both were career highs, as were his 176 hits and 99 walks. He began losing 
playing time to Ted Lepcio at second base toward the end of the 1956 season. 
He was relegated to pinch hitting duties early in the 1957 season before 
a mid-season trade sent him to the Baltimore Orioles for pitcher Mike Fornieles.[19] 
Goodman was immediately inserted into the starting line-up in Baltimore, 
and hit a home run in his first game as an Oriole.[20] He mostly played 
third base, filling in for an injured George Kell,[21] but also played 
first, second, short, left field and right field. He batted .308 with three 
home runs and 33 RBIs in 73 games for the Orioles. At the end of the season, 
he, Tito Francona and Ray Moore were dealt to the Chicago White Sox for 
Larry Doby, Jack Harshman and Jim Marshall.[22] Chicago later sent pitcher 
Russ Heman to Baltimore as part of this deal when it was discovered by 
the Orioles that Harshman was suffering from a slipped disc.[23] In 1958, 
with Nellie Fox at second base, Goodman shifted to third with the White 
Sox. He was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the month of May. Upon 
his return, he quickly shot up among the American League leaders in batting, 
with his average peaking at .336 in late July.[24] At 33 years old at the 
start of the 1959 season, Goodman was used in a lefty-righty platoon with 
Bubba Phillips at third base. The 1959 White Sox reached the World Series 
for the first time since the infamous 1919 World Series. It was also the 
first and only World Series of Goodman's career. Goodman appeared in five 
of the six games of the 1959 World Series, driving in and scoring one run 
in the White Sox's 11-0 game one victory.[25] He also went two-for-three 
in game three, and was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning to load the 
bases with the White Sox down by two runs (they ended up scoring one).[26] 
Overall, he batted .231 (3-for-13) in Chicago's six game loss to the Los 
Angeles Dodgers. Goodman was used sparingly by manager Al Lopez in 1960. 
After the season, the White Sox made him available for the 1960 Major League 
Baseball expansion draft,[27] but he went unselected. Instead, he remained 
with the franchise for two more seasons, in which he batted a combined 
.242 with one home run and sixteen RBIs in 71 games. After holding out 
over a salary dispute at the start of Spring training 1962,[28] he was 
released by the White Sox just as the season was set to start.[29] Goodman 
joined the Houston Colt .45s in 1962, playing in 49 games into their inaugural 
season, and went two-for-five with two runs scored in his first game as 
a Colt 45.[30] Overall, he batted .255 in 82 games for the Colt .45s, while 
playing first, second, and third base. In 1963, he became a player-manager 
for the Colts' Carolina League affiliate, the Durham Bulls, and batted 
.354 with six home runs, the most home runs he had ever hit in any season 
at any level.[31] The following season, he appeared on the mound for two 
games (7 innings) with Durham, leaving catcher as the only position he 
never played professionally. He managed the Cocoa Astros of the Florida 
State League in 1965. In three seasons, he had a combined 184-228 record 
for a .447 winning percentage. He became a scout for the Red Sox in 1966, 
then an instructor in the Kansas City Athletics organization in 1967 before 
moving over to the Atlanta Braves' organization in 1968, serving as first-base 
coach on the Braves Major League staff through 1970. He retired from the 
game in 1976, and became an antiques dealer Sarasota, Florida, the Spring 
home of the Red Sox during his decade with them. He died on October 1, 
1984 after a year-long battle with cancer.[32] Goodman had five, 5-hit 
games in his career. His best baseball playing position according to fielding 
percentage was .991 at first base; in 1958, he led the AL with a .994 fielding
