As player As manager William Harold Southworth (March 9, 1893 – November 
15, 1969) was an American right fielder, center fielder and manager in 
Major League Baseball (MLB). Playing in 1913 and 1915 and from 1918 to 
1929, he batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Southworth managed 
in 1929 and from 1940 through 1951. He managed three pennant-winning St. 
Louis Cardinals teams, winning two World Series, and another pennant with 
the Boston Braves, the last National League title in Boston baseball history. 
As manager of the Cardinals, his .642 winning percentage is the second-highest 
in franchise history and the highest since 1900. Late in life, Southworth 
served as a scout for the Braves. He endured a great deal of tragedy in 
his baseball career, first experiencing the stillbirth of his twin babies 
and the deaths of his wife and his adult son. He died in 1969. He was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008. Six years later, the Cardinals 
inducted him into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He also 
belongs to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame. Southworth had a son, Billy 
Southworth, Jr., and a cousin, Bill Southworth, who both played professional 
baseball. Southworth was born in Harvard, Nebraska, to Orlando and Marriah 
Southworth. He was raised in Columbus, Ohio. He had four older brothers 
who played baseball. Before he was old enough to play with them, Southworth 
would give his old socks to his brothers so they could create makeshift 
balls.[1] Southworth decided to play baseball against his father's wishes.[2] 
Orlando Southworth had wanted his son to attend college.[3] At the age 
of 19, he signed a contract with the Portsmouth team in the Ohio State 
League. He joined the Cleveland Indians in 1913, but only appeared in one 
game, entering as a replacement on defense.[4] In 1914, Southworth married 
Lida Brooks. She was a minister's daughter and they had met while Southworth 
was playing for Portsmouth. The couple's son, William Brooks Southworth, 
was born during Southworth's early playing career.[5] Billy Southworth, 
Jr. later became a professional baseball player for several seasons.[6] 
The elder Southworth returned to the Cleveland Indians in 1915 and appeared 
in 60 games.[4] He played for the Birmingham Barons in 1917 and part of 
1918,[7] when he made the Pittsburgh Pirates and played in 64 major league 
games.[4] Southworth played more regularly in 1919, appearing in 121 games 
and leading the league with 14 triples. With the exception of two seasons, 
Southworth played in at least that many games through 1926. In 1926, Southworth's 
offensive production increased and he finished the season with a .320 batting 
average, 16 home runs and 99 RBI.[4] He ran into difficulty with New York 
manager John McGraw that year, as Southworth's independent style became 
incompatible with McGraw's strict leadership. He was traded from the New 
York Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals in the middle of the season.[8] 
Southworth suffered a 1927 rib injury that limited his playing time. The 
Cardinals' leadership began to look for a role for Southworth beyond his 
playing career. Southworth's managerial career began in 1928 with the Rochester 
Red Wings of the AA International League (IL), the top club in the Cardinals' 
farm system. In May, Southworth and his wife experienced the stillbirths 
of twins. Southworth returned home after losing the twins, but he quickly 
came back to Rochester. Late in the season, Southworth received word that 
Billy Jr. had been accidentally shot by a neighbor in Columbus.[9] His 
son recovered, but the experience shook the manager. The team won the IL 
championship that season.[10] Southworth was promoted to St. Louis as player-manager 
for 1929, replacing Bill McKechnie, who won a National League pennant in 
1928 and lost the World Series in four straight games to the New York Yankees. 
Southworth's Major League playing career reached the end of the road, as 
he appeared in only 19 games, five in the outfield, and batted only .188 
with six hits. He finished with a .297 batting average in 1,131 MLB games 
played, 52 home runs, 91 triples, 173 doubles, 661 runs scored, and 561 
RBI. He stole 138 bases in his career and had double-digit steal totals 
in eight seasons. As a big leaguer, Southworth had 1,296 hits in 4,359 
at bats.[4] His 1929 MLB managerial debut was not much more successful 
than his playing stint. Only one year removed from being a teammate of 
his charges, he attempted to impose discipline on the Cardinals, banning 
them from driving their own automobiles. The team did not respond to his 
hard line and won only 43 of their first 88 games. Southworth was sent 
back to Rochester on July 21, McKechnie was rehired, and the Cardinals 
finished in fourth place. Although Southworth immediately resumed his successful 
minor league managerial career, the firing and personal tragedy — the death 
of his wife Lida at age 42[11] — began a downward spiral. Beset by struggles 
with alcoholism, he quit a coaching job with the 1933 Giants during spring 
training and left baseball for two seasons. After a recovery, he rejoined 
the Cardinals' minor league system in 1935 and by 1939 he was again enjoying 
success as Rochester's manager. He remarried in 1935, wedding the former 
Mabel Stemen, and had a daughter.[3] In June 1940, he received a second 
chance with the struggling Cardinals when owner Sam Breadon fired manager 
Ray Blades and promoted Southworth from Rochester. This time, the Cards 
flourished under him. With talented players such as Enos Slaughter, Marty 
Marion, Stan Musial, Walker Cooper, Mort Cooper, Whitey Kurowski and Johnny 
Beazley being harvested each spring from the club's farm system, the Cardinals 
entered a Golden Age in their history. Upon Southworth's appointment, they 
won 69 of 109 games and jumped from seventh to third place in 1940. The 
following season they won 97 games and finished second. From 1942 to 1944, 
the Cardinals won 106, 105 and 105 games, three pennants and two World 
Series titles. His 1942 Cardinals, who breezed to the World Series championship 
in five games, were the only team (out of eight) to ever defeat Joe McCarthy's 
New York Yankees in a Fall Classic. In 1943, both teams met again in the 
World Series; but this time, the Yankees turned the tables on the Redbirds, 
winning in five games. The Cards' third successive National League pennant, 
in 1944, produced another world championship, a six-game triumph over the 
American League (AL) St. Louis Browns. With it, Southworth had presided 
over one of the most dominant three-year stretches in National League (NL) 
history. However, another personal family tragedy struck when on February 
15, 1945, his son, Billy Jr., by then a United States Army Air Forces major, 
died when his Boeing B-29 Superfortress crashed into Flushing Bay, New 
York after taking off from Mitchel Field, New York, on a training flight 
to Florida. Still, Southworth began managing at the beginning of the 1945 
season, which saw his Cardinals win 95 games but finished second, three 
games behind the Chicago Cubs. Southworth moved to the Boston Braves in 
1946, signing a then-lucrative managing contract for a reported $50,000 
per season,[2] and immediately led the Braves into the first division. 
Talented pitchers Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn had both returned from service 
in World War II that year. In 1948, the Braves won their second NL pennant 
of the 20th century—and Boston's last National League title—but were defeated 
in six games by the Cleveland Indians in the 1948 World Series.[12] In 
that World Series, all of the games were close except for one, when the 
Braves beat pitcher Bob Feller by a score of 11-5.[13] Author John Rossi 
writes that Sain lost some respect for Southworth after the manager said 
the managing and not talent had won the 1948 pennant.[14] Sain had already 
become irritated with Southworth after the 1948 signing of unproven "bonus 
baby" pitcher Johnny Antonelli. Sain and Southworth rarely spoke after 
1948.[15] During the following, 1949 season, Boston struggled on the field 
and was in chaos off the diamond. Southworth was rumored to be drinking 
heavily[16] and near nervous collapse.[17] Some players complained about 
his rules and regulations, and some, including starting shortstop Alvin 
Dark and second baseman Eddie Stanky, were critical of his drinking.[18] 
Meanwhile, others, like Sain, resented the amount of credit Southworth 
had received for the 1948 pennant. With Boston at 55–54 in August, Southworth 
turned the Braves over to coach Johnny Cooney for the remainder of 1949. 
A newspaper account at the time characterized the change as a leave of 
absence for health reasons.[19] After some of the rebellious players (including 
Dark and Stanky) had been traded, Southworth returned to his post in 1950 
and led the Braves back into the first division, but an aging team and 
declining attendance bode poorly for both Southworth's career and the Braves' 
future in New England. In 1951, Southworth's club was only 28–31 on June 
19. He called the team's general manager, John Quinn, and asked to be allowed 
to resign,[10] and he was replaced by his former standout right fielder, 
Tommy Holmes. Southworth's major league managerial win-loss record was 
1,044–704.[20] His .597 winning percentage is second all-time among managers 
to McCarthy's .615.[21] Southworth was the first to win the World Series 
as a player and again as a manager. Southworth remained with the Braves 
as a scout in the 1950s. He was acquitted of drunken driving charges after 
a 1955 arrest, and retired from scouting at the end of his contract following 
the 1956 season.[10] During his scouting days, he signed future all-time 
home run leader Hank Aaron,[3] who was playing for the Indianapolis Clowns 
of the Negro Leagues. For the last couple of decades of his life, Southworth 
lived outside of Sunbury, Ohio.[11] By the summer of 1969, his health had 
begun to fail and he was confined to his home. He gave a final interview 
to a reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he commented on how difficult 
it would be for the 1969 Cardinals to win a third straight championship, 
as the 1944 team had done.[22] Though he had quit smoking many years earlier,[10] 
Southworth died of emphysema that year in Columbus, Ohio, and was buried 
in Green Lawn Cemetery.[11] Southworth's cousin, Bill Southworth, appeared 
in the major leagues in 1964. Southworth was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 2008. He had been eligible for election as a player in the 1940s, 
but he received few votes. After Southworth had been left off of the ballot 
as a manager in 2003, author Raymond Mileur had begun a campaign of letter 
writing, phone calls to the Hall of Fame, radio show comments and advocacy 
through his website known as "The Birdhouse". Southworth was elected after 
receiving 13 votes from the 16-member Veterans Committee.[23] On the occasion 
of Southworth's election to the Hall of Fame, one of his former players 
on the 1948 Braves, Clint Conatser, paid tribute to his old manager. "He 
just had a gut feeling about the right thing to do in a situation", Conatser 
recalled. "The moves he would make would work for him — all the time, not 
occasionally. Leo Durocher was the same way. It's like some guys can pick 
horses out of nowhere. Southworth was a genius like that on the diamond."[24] 
In January 2014, the Cardinals announced that Southworth was among 22 former 
players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall 
of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.[25] He is also a member
