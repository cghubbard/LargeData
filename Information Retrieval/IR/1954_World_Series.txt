The 1954 World Series matched the National League champion New York Giants 
against the American League champion Cleveland Indians. The Giants swept 
the Series in four games to win their first championship since 1933, defeating 
the heavily favored Indians, who had won an AL-record 111 games in the 
regular season; it has since been broken by the 1998 New York Yankees (114) 
and again by the 2001 Seattle Mariners (116, tying the 1906 Chicago Cubs 
for the most wins ever). The Series is perhaps best-remembered for "The 
Catch", a sensational running catch made by Giants center fielder Willie 
Mays in Game 1, snaring a long drive by Vic Wertz near the outfield wall 
with his back to the infield. It is also remembered for utility player 
Dusty Rhodes' clutch hitting in three of the four games, including his 
walk-off hit for Monte Irvin that won Game 1, probably the best-known hit 
to be described as a "Chinese home run", since it barely cleared the 258-foot 
(79 m) right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Giants manager Leo Durocher, 
who had managed teams to three National League championships, won his first 
and only World Series title in his managerial career. After moving West, 
the San Francisco Giants would not win a World Series until the 2010 season. 
This was the first time the Cleveland Indians had been swept in a World 
Series and the first time the New York Giants had swept an opponent without 
qualification. They had won four games without a loss in the 1922 World 
Series, but there was also one tie. Game 2 was the last World Series and 
playoff game at the Polo Grounds, because the Giants did not win another 
pennant until after their move to San Francisco and because the Mets did 
not reach the postseason until after they moved to Shea Stadium. Game 4 
was the last World Series and playoff game at Cleveland Stadium; the Indians 
did not return to the World Series or playoffs until 1995, a year after 
Jacobs Field opened. As a result, this World Series held the distinction 
of being the most recent World Series to host the final World Series game 
of its two venues, a distinction it lost to the 1959 World Series after 
the original Comiskey Park closed down at the end of the 1990 Major League 
Baseball season and Dodger Stadium opened in 1962. The Indians, by winning 
the American League pennant, kept the Yankees from having a chance to win 
their sixth straight series. The last time the Yankees had not won the 
series or pennant beforehand was 1948, when, again, the Indians kept them 
out (although that year, they won the Series). It was also the only World 
Series from 1949 to 1958 which did not feature the Yankees. The Indians 
easily won the 1954 pennant on the strength of the American League's top 
pitching staff, leading the AL in team ERA at 2.72 and complete games with 
77. Pitchers Early Wynn (23–11, 2.73 ERA) and Bob Lemon (23–7, 2.72 ERA) 
were in top form, with solid contributions from Mike Garcia (19–8, 2.64) 
and Art Houtterman (15–7, 3.35). Bob Feller, at age 35, could only make 
19 starts, and finished at 13–3. Cleveland also had potent hitting, leading 
the AL in home runs (156) and finishing second in runs scored (746), although 
the team managed just 30 stolen bases in 63 attempts. Bobby Ávila led the 
offense with 112 runs and a .341 average, while Larry Doby (.272 avg, 32 
HRs, 126 RBIs) and Al Rosen (.300 avg, 24 HRs, 102 RBIs) provided the power. 
Defensively catcher Jim Hegan made only four errors in 134 games and threw 
out 44% of would-be base stealers.[1] The New York Giants entered the World 
Series with a top flight pitching staff as well, with Johnny Antonelli 
(21–7, 2.30 ERA), Rubén Gómez (17–9, 2.88), and 37-year-old Sal "The Barber" 
Maglie (14–6, 3.26). The Giants relied more heavily on relief pitching 
with Hoyt Wilhelm (12–7, 2.10, 7 saves) and Marv Grissom (10–7, 2.35, 19 
saves) rounding out a staff that led the NL in team ERA at 3.09 and shutouts 
with 17. Manager Leo Durocher used a solid, consistent lineup with all 
his starters, except for the catching position, playing in at least 135 
games. Willie Mays (.345, 41 HRs 110 RBIs) led an offense that also featured 
Don Meuller (.342 avg), Al Dark (.293, 98 runs), Hank Thompson (26 HRs, 
86 RBIs) and pinch-hitter extraordinaire Dusty Rhodes (.341 avg).[2] NL 
New York Giants (4) vs. AL Cleveland Indians (0) Cleveland got on the board 
first and fast. Leadoff man Al Smith was hit by a pitch, Bobby Ávila singled 
and Vic Wertz brought home both with a triple to right. Bob Lemon gave 
two back in the third on singles by Whitey Lockman and Alvin Dark, a walk 
to Willie Mays and a Hank Thompson single. And that was that until the 
10th inning. Mays saved the day in the eighth after leadoff singles by 
Larry Doby and Al Rosen led to starting pitcher Sal Maglie being lifted 
for Don Liddle. Wertz's drive to deep center field would have scored both 
if not for Mays's memorable catch. Lemon went all the way for Cleveland, 
losing it in the 10th when Dusty Rhodes, pinch-hitting for Monte Irvin 
with two Giants on base, hit a walk-off home run. Once again, the visitors 
started quickly, then couldn't hold onto their lead. Smith's leadoff homer 
off Johnny Antonelli put Cleveland up 1-0 before a lot of Polo Grounds 
fans had settled into their seats. Early Wynn preserved that lead until 
the fifth inning, but after Mays and Thompson singles, once again Rhodes 
pinch-hit for Irvin and came through, this time an RBI single. Antonelli 
himself got the go-ahead run home against his counterpart, scoring Thompson 
on a groundout. Antonelli was a little wild on the mound, walking six, 
but also struck out nine. New York got just four hits all day, but Rhodes 
delivered the game-winner again, a solo home run leading off the seventh. 
A huge crowd, 71,555, hoped to see Cleveland get its first win, but things 
did not go well for the home team. It trailed 1-0 quickly when Whitey Lockman 
singled, took second on a groundout and scored on a hit by Mays. The clutch 
hitter of the series, Rhodes, had a two-run single pinch-hitting in the 
third, and an error by the pitcher, Mike Garcia, gave the Giants another 
run to make it 4-0. Gomez gave up just four hits, with knuckleballer Hoyt 
Wilhelm mopping up for the save. New York was now a win away from the championship. 
Cleveland's slim chances at a comeback took a beating as the Indians fell 
hopelessly behind 7-0. Almost everything went wrong from the start, a pair 
of errors resulting in two New York runs in the second. A single by Mays 
in the next inning scored another run. Then the game broke wide open in 
the fifth. Lemon loaded the bases and was pulled. Hal Newhouser replaced 
him but got nobody out, giving up a walk to Thompson and single to Irvin. 
A brief glimmer of hope for the home team came in the bottom of the fifth 
with a couple of Giant errors and a Hank Majeski three-run pinch homer. 
But except for a meaningless RBI single by Rudy Regalado in the seventh 
off Don Liddle, the Indians got nothing more as Wilhelm and Game 2 starter 
Antonelli came on in relief and the Giants completed a four-game sweep.
