Darren Christopher O'Day (born October 22, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played college baseball for the University of Florida, and previously 
played in MLB for the Los Angeles Angels, New York Mets, and Texas Rangers. 
O'Day is one of the few Major League pitchers to throw submarine pitches. 
O'Day was born in Jacksonville, Florida. He attended Bishop Kenny High 
School in Jacksonville, and played high school baseball for the Bishop 
Kenny Crusaders.[1] O'Day accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the 
University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach 
Pat McMahon's Florida Gators baseball team from 2003 to 2006.[2] He earned 
Southeastern Conference (SEC) Academic Honor Roll recognition for four 
consecutive years, and was an Academic All-American as a senior.[2] During 
the Gators' run in the 2005 College World Series, O'Day made four relief 
appearances and earned a save.[2] O'Day graduated from the University of 
Florida with a bachelor's degree in agricultural and life sciences in 2006. 
Undrafted out of college, O'Day signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim in 2006. He made his major league debut with the Angels 
in 2008.[citation needed] The New York Mets selected O'Day in the Rule 
5 Draft on December 11, 2008.[citation needed] He made the Mets' roster 
out of spring training. He was widely quoted in the media on the death 
of his former teammate Nick Adenhart. He was designated for assignment 
by the Mets two weeks into the season in order to make room on the roster 
for Nelson Figueroa.[citation needed] The Texas Rangers claimed him on 
April 22, 2009 and he made his debut the same day in extra innings against 
the Toronto Blue Jays, just minutes after getting to the bullpen from the 
airport. His arrival was so quick that he had to wear the jersey of Kason 
Gabbard in his first appearance.[3] During this period, when he arrived 
at the mound, Texas Rangers' fans began a traditional chant of his last 
name.[4][dead link] Limited to sixteen appearances due to a pair of injuries, 
O'Day was 0–1 with a 5.40 earned run average (ERA) in 2011. He was first 
sidelined from April 27 to July 1 because of a partial acetabular labrum 
tear in his left hip. Right shoulder inflammation sent him back to the 
disabled list for the second time from August 25 to September 12. He also 
pitched in eighteen minor league games with the Frisco RoughRiders and 
Round Rock Express, going a combined 1–0 with a 2.53 ERA. He was not activated 
to the Rangers' roster for any round of that year's postseason.[5] The 
Baltimore Orioles claimed O'Day off waivers on November 2, 2011.[5] He 
was scheduled to make $1,350,000 in the 2012 season. Following the struggles 
of Pedro Strop, O'Day settled into the role of the 8th inning setup pitcher 
later in the 2012 season, often leaving the game in a manageable state 
for closer Jim Johnson. O'Day posted a 7-1 record with a 2.28 ERA by the 
end of the 2012 season.[citation needed] In 2013, O'Day continued his success 
as an Oriole, going 5-3 as their 8th inning setup man, while posting a 
2.18 ERA in 68 games. He collected two saves and pitched 62.0 innings, 
while striking out 59 batters and holding opponents to a .210 batting average. 
O'Day had a career year in 2014, as he pitched 68.2 innings in 68 games 
and collected a 5-2 record with four saves. He posted a 1.70 ERA along 
with a 0.89 WHIP. He also struck out 73 batters and held opponents to a 
career-best .174 batting average. He set career-bests in innings pitched, 
saves, ERA, WHIP, strikeouts, and opponent batting average. Despite his 
most successful season, O'Day struggled greatly in the postseason, as he 
posted an 0-2 record and a 13.50 ERA in four games. Particularly in the 
2014 American League Championship Series, O'Day went 0-2 in three games 
and posted a 16.20 ERA.[citation needed] In 2015, O'Day was selected to 
appear in the All-Star Game. He finished the year with a 1.52 ERA in 68 
appearances, which totaled to 65.1 innings. He compiled a 6-2 record and 
set a career-high with six saves. He also set a career-high with 82 strikeouts. 
On December 14, 2015, the Orioles re-signed O'Day to a 4-year, $31 million 
contract.[6] O'Day is married to Elizabeth Prann, a University of Florida
