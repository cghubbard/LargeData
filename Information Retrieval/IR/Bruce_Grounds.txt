Bruce Grounds or Bruce Park is a former baseball ground located in Indianapolis, 
Indiana. The ground was home to the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American 
Association in 1884. It was also used for Sunday games by the Indianapolis 
Hoosiers of the National League in 1887. The ballfield was located at Bruce 
(now 23rd) Street; and College Avenue. The National League club's primary 
home was Tinker Park. They staged Sunday games at the old AA park, outside 
the city limits, due to blue laws. The club did not draw well at the site, 
as it was too far from the city center. Sunday games during 1888-1889 were 
held at Indianapolis Park. The ballpark site is now occupied by residential 
and commercial buildings. Coordinates: 39°47′51″N 86°08′36″W﻿ / ﻿39.797512°N
