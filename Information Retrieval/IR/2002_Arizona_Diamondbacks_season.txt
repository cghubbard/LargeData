The 2002 Arizona Diamondbacks looked to repeat as World Series champions. 
They looked to contend in what was once again a strong National League 
West Division. They finished the season with a record of 98-64, good enough 
for the division title. Randy Johnson would finish the season as the NL 
Cy Young Award winner and become the second pitcher to win five Cy Young 
Awards.[1] During the 2002 season, Luis Gonzalez received publicity as 
a piece of gum chewed by Gonzalez during a spring training game was sold 
for $10,000 on April 15, 2002.[5] The buyer was Curt Mueller, owner of 
Mueller Sports Medicine Inc., manufacturer of the gum, Quench.[6] Infielders
