Middletown is a city in Orange County, New York, United States. It lies 
in New York's Hudson Valley region, near the Wallkill River and the foothills 
of the Shawangunk Mountains. Middletown is situated between Port Jervis 
and Newburgh, New York. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city's 
population was 28,086, reflecting an increase of 2,698 from the 25,388 
counted in the 2000 Census. The zip code is 10940. Middletown falls within 
the New York metropolitan area.[1][2] Middletown was incorporated as a 
city in 1888. It grew in the 19th and early 20th centuries as a stop on 
several lower New York State railroads, attracting several small manufacturing 
businesses. The surrounding area is partly devoted to small dairy farms. 
Mediacom Communications Corp, the Galleria at Crystal Run, SUNY Orange, 
Walmart, Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, and the Times Herald-Record 
are major employers in Middletown. John Green purchased land from the DeLancey 
patent and probably settled the area around 1744. Due to its location between 
other settlements, residents adopted the name of Middletown, changing it 
later to South Middletown to avoid confusion with a nearby location. Eventually 
they dropped the word "south," using the current name when the community 
became a village in 1848. The village was incorporated as a city in 1888. 
The First Congregational Church of Middletown, established in 1785, has 
the highest spire downtown. Construction of its first building was a sign 
of Middletown becoming established as a village. [3] Its current church 
building was constructed in 1872. Middletown grew through the 19th century, 
stimulated by construction of the Erie Railroad and the New York, Ontario 
and Western Railway[4] (among others). The city was industrialized, developing 
factories for a number of industries, such as shoe, lawnmower blade, and 
furniture. These did well through the World War II era. Due to industrial 
restructuring most of these businesses had closed by the 1960s. In 1968, 
Middletown annexed the adjacent Village of Amchir.[5] In the 1970s the 
economy of Middletown and surrounding communities suffered additional blows 
due to the closing of a large Ford Motor Company plant in Mahwah, New Jersey, 
and the downsizing of IBM operations in the area. Responding to higher 
housing costs in New York City, from the 1970s, New York City police officers, 
firefighters and other workers began to move to the area, as local housing 
offered better value. These long-distance commuters helped to bolster the 
economy of the area. After 1986, however, New York City required its municipal 
employees to reside in the city,[6] and Middletown lost this source of 
residential development. The only railroad left in town is the Middletown 
and New Jersey Railway, a freight line. The population has continued to 
grow into the 21st century, while the economy has shifted largely to service 
and retail, with a regional medical center a major employer in the area. 
The downtown business district of Middletown suffered from suburbanization, 
with the development of the "Miracle Mile" shopping strip and Lloyd's Supermarket 
in the late 1960s and two later shopping malls, all located at the eastern 
edge of town along Route 211, near Route 17 and Interstate 84. The Orange 
Plaza mall drew several of the downtown shops into it by the mid-1970s, 
weakening downtown. To the East across Route 17, the Galleria at Crystal 
Run opened in the early 1990s. A Super-WalMart replaced the Orange Plaza 
mall in 2001. Some of the buildings downtown are abandoned or underused. 
There has long been an active downtown bar and restaurant scene. The downtown 
area has a number of historic churches. The Middletown City Hall and City 
Court are located on James Street.[7] Prosperous neighborhoods include 
Presidential Heights, and Highland Avenue is lined with large Victorian 
houses, some of the largest of which are now used as nursing homes. Other 
neighborhoods show the effects of loss of jobs and decline in the economy. 
The surrounding countryside was devoted partly to small dairy farms, but 
family farming has waned since the 1980s. Middletown is the main business 
address for the newspaper Times Herald-Record and its owner, Local Media 
Group.[8] Mediacom Communications Corp, a cable and other pay TV company 
is headquartered outside the city in the Town of Wallkill. It is also a 
manufacturing location for Bell Flavors & Fragrances.[9] Shopping in the 
area includes the Galleria at Crystal Run, a mall just east of Middletown, 
and a long retail strip along Route 211 on the east side of town. The downtown 
area, particularly North Street and East/West Main Street, has a variety 
of ethnic eateries and various small shops. A children's science museum, 
called The Interactive Museum,[10] and a number of churches are located 
in the neighborhood. The city also has movie theaters, the historic Paramount 
Theatre, a local arts council, bowling alleys, WALL and WOSR radio stations 
and Thrall Library downtown. There are active Boy Scouts of America and 
Girl Scouts of the USA chapters, as well as Lions Club, Elks Club, Kiwanis, 
Rotary Club and other service clubs. The Rotary Club runs an annual Horse 
Show at Fancher Davidge Park each fall. Middletown is also the site of 
the Orange County Fair each summer and the Orange County Fair Speedway. 
SUNY Orange, previously known as Orange County Community College, is located 
in Middletown. Its campus includes the historic Webb Horton House (pictured), 
more commonly known as Morrison Hall. It also has a campus in Newburgh, 
and three satellite campuses, but the majority of buildings and students 
are in Middletown. A total of more than 6100 students attend SUNY Orange. 
In addition to credit classes, there are a wide variety of classes for 
lifelong learning. Health care services are provided at Orange Regional 
Medical Center, a new hospital located in the Town of Walkill. It was completed 
in 2011, merging the faculties of the former Horton Medical Center and 
Arden Hill Hospital. It is a major employer in the region.[11][12] Middletown 
has works by two prominent architects: Hillside Cemetery, designed by British 
architect and landscape designer Calvert Vaux, who designed New York City's 
Central Park with Frederick Law Olmsted; and J. W. Chorley Elementary School, 
designed by American architect Paul Rudolph, while serving as Dean of the 
Yale School of Architecture. The Highland Lakes State Park is the nearest 
State Park. Good choices for hiking, biking, and country drives are nearby.

and any other officers required are appointed annually by the mayor and

public school system has shifted from maintaining numerous small neighborhood 
schools and combined more students into fewer magnet schools. Three elementary 
schools cover grade levels from kindergarten through fifth grade. Both 
Truman Moon Elementary School and John W. Chorley Elementary School have 
made way for Presidential Park Elementary School, the district's newest 
school, built in 2014. William A. Carter Elementary and Maple Hill Elementary 
are the district's two other elementary schools. In 2005, the Middletown 
School District implemented a full day kindergarten program at the request

Motel and International Golf Discount in "What's Wrong With This World"
