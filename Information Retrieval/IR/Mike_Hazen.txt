Michael Norman Hazen (born January 7, 1976) is an American professional 
baseball executive and current executive vice president and general manager 
of the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB).[1] A Princeton 
University graduate and former minor league outfielder, he previously served 
as the GM and senior Vice President of the Boston Red Sox and worked under 
Ben Cherington.[2] Hazen was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts, and grew 
up in nearby Abington.[3] He played four years of varsity baseball for 
the Princeton Tigers and was selected in the 31st round by the San Diego 
Padres in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. After batting .307 with 
62 hits in the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 1998, he was promoted to 
the Class A Fort Wayne Wizards of the Midwest League. He batted only .203 
in 72 games played in 1999 and a chronic shoulder injury ended his active 
career.[4] As a player, he threw left-handed, batted right-handed and was 
listed at 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm) tall and 195 pounds (88 kg). Hazen joined 
the Cleveland Indians as an intern[4] then became one of the clubs' advance 
scouts in 2001–02. Promoted to assistant director of professional scouting 
in 2003, he then spent two full seasons (2004–05) as Cleveland's assistant 
director of player development, working directly under John Farrell, now 
the incumbent field manager of the Red Sox.[3] Hazen initially came to 
the Boston Red Sox as director of player development in February 2006 (Farrell 
would follow as the team's pitching coach eight months later), and then 
was vice president, player development and amateur scouting, in 2011. He 
was promoted to vice president and assistant general manager (under Cherington) 
in 2012, then named a senior vice president and assistant GM in early 2015.[3] 
On September 23, 2015, Hazen was named general manager by the Red Sox's 
president of baseball operations, Dave Dombrowski. Although Dombrowski 
assumed final authority for baseball decisions, Hazen served as a top aide 
and had input in the club's decision-making.[5] During his one full season 
in the post, Boston won the 2016 American League East Division championship, 
but fell in the ALDS to the eventual league champions, the Indians. On 
October 16, 2016, Hazen agreed to become the executive vice president and
