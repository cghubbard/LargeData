Pirate City is the site of minor league and spring training activities 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League. The complex is located 
in Bradenton, Florida, and serves as the site of the Pirates spring training 
workouts, while nearby McKechnie Field is the site of the team's home spring 
training games. While the Pirates have been training in Bradenton since 
1969, the Pirate City complex received a major renovation in 2008, the 
result of a $20 million financial agreement between the team and city that 
fixed up both the Pirate City and McKechnie Field.[1] Pirate City also 
hosts corporate events, retreats, parties, receptions and all types of 
baseball camps and events. It has served as a training facility for the 
Netherlands national baseball team during the 2009 World Baseball Classic 
and hosted the LG Twins of the Korean Baseball Organization. The Pirates' 
rookie-level minor league affiliate, the Gulf Coast Pirates of the Gulf 
Coast League, play their home games at Pirate City. The complex includes 
player dorms, coaches' suites and offices for staff and front-office personnel. 
For the majority of the year, the dorms are occupied by the organization's 
Minor League players, players doing rehabilitation work in Bradenton and 
those who come to Pirate City for the fall instructional league. Per team 
policy, all players participating in Minor League camp are required to 
live in one of the 75 player dorm rooms, each of which holds two people.[2] 
There are four full-sized practice fields at the complex, each one named 
for a Pirates Hall of Famer: Roberto Clemente (field 1), Pie Traynor (field 
2), Honus Wagner (field 3) and Willie Stargell (field 4).[3] One of the 
chapters in Ron Luciano's book The Umpire Strikes Back is titled "Where 
The #$@& Is Pirate City?", as various players (and umpires) had difficulty
