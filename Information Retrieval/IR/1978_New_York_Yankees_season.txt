WPIX The 1978 New York Yankees season was the 76th season for the Yankees. 
The team finished with a record of 100-63, finishing one game ahead of 
the Boston Red Sox to win their third American League East title. The two 
teams were tied after 162 games, leading to a one-game playoff, which the 
Yankees won. In the ALCS, they defeated the Kansas City Royals in 4 games. 
In the World Series, they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in 6 games in 
a rematch of the 1977 World Series. New York was managed by Billy Martin, 
Dick Howser and Bob Lemon. The Yankees played at Yankee Stadium. The season 
was tumultuous for the Yankees, as Jackson was suspended in a midseason 
showdown with Billy Martin, which later resulted in Martin resigning mid-season. 
During the season, Ron Guidry became the last pitcher to win at least 25 
games in one season for the Yankees in the 20th century.[5] Guidry won 
the Cy Young Award by unanimous vote. In 273 2/3 innings, he compiled a 
record of 25-3, with 248 strikeouts, 1.74 ERA, and 9 shutouts. Relief pitcher 
Goose Gossage won Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award, leading the American 
League with 27 saves. In July, the team was 14 1⁄2 games behind the Boston

first place. The Yankees were victorious over the Red Sox in the one-game 
playoff for the AL East title. This game featured Bucky Dent's famous 3-run 
go-ahead home run in the 7th inning. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
