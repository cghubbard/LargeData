Stephen Edward Piscotty (born January 14, 1991) is an American professional 
baseball right fielder for the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He played college baseball for the Stanford Cardinals of Stanford 
University and was the St. Louis Cardinals' first round selection in the 
2012 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on July 
21, 2015, and was the Cardinals' organization Player of the Year that season. 
Stephen Piscotty is the son of Michael and Gretchen Piscotty. He has two 
younger brothers, named Austin and Nicholas.[1] Born in Pleasanton, California, 
he began attending college baseball games of the Stanford Cardinal of Stanford 
University with his uncle for his birthday when he was young.[2] Piscotty 
attended Amador Valley High School in Pleasanton, where he played for the 
school's baseball team as a pitcher and a shortstop.[3][4] In 2009, his 
senior year, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the East Bay Athletic 
League.[5] The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Piscotty in the 45th round 
of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft but he opted not to sign. He enrolled 
at Stanford to play college baseball for the Cardinal as a third baseman, 
pitcher, and an outfielder.[6] In 2011, Piscotty was named to the All-Pacific-10 
Conference first team.[7] Piscotty also played collegiate summer baseball 
for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox in 2011 and was the Cape Cod League batting 
champion with a .349 batting average.[4] Piscotty was named a preseason 
All-American prior to the 2012 season.[8][9] That year, he batted .329, 
led the Cardinal with 30 walks and 56 runs batted in (RBIs), and was named 
All-Pac-12 in 2012.[10] As a pitcher, Piscotty posted a 5–2 won–lost record 
with a 2.57 earned run average in 2012.[4] During his Stanford career, 
he batted .340 with 124 runs, 132 RBIs, 43 doubles, 12 home runs and 62 
walks in 172 games.[2] The St. Louis Cardinals selected Piscotty in the 
first round, with the 36th overall selection, of the 2012 Major League 
Baseball draft and signed him on June 16 with a $1.4 million bonus.[10][11] 
After playing in the infield for the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Class 
A Midwest League in 2012, the Cardinals moved him to the outfield before 
the 2013 season.[12] His first season showed mixed results as he batted 
.295 with a .376 on-base percentage, .448 slugging percentage, four home 
runs, 18 doubles and 27 RBIs, but committed 22 errors in just 36 games 
at third base.[13] The Cardinals assigned Piscotty to the Palm Beach Cardinals 
of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL) in 2013, where he was 
selected as an All-Star.[14] After batting .295 with 15 home runs in 112 
games for Palm Beach and the Springfield Cardinals of the Class AA Texas 
League in 2013, the Cardinals assigned Piscotty to the Arizona Fall League 
(AFL) to play for the Salt River Rafters.[15][16] Piscotty spent the 2014 
season with the Memphis Redbirds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, 
and opened the 2015 season with Memphis. There, he batted .272 with an 
.841 OPS in 87 games for the Redbirds.[17] The St. Louis Cardinals promoted 
Piscotty to their major league roster on July 21, 2015.[18] He made his 
major league debut that night as the starting left fielder against the 
Chicago White Sox in an 8–5 win, and singled off Carlos Rodon in his second 
at bat for his first hit.[19] His sacrifice fly scored Peter Kozma on July 
25 and was the only run of the game and game-winner in a 1–0 win over the 
Atlanta Braves for his first RBI.[20] His first home run came at Busch 
Stadium on August 16 in a 6–4 loss to the Miami Marlins,[21] and he hit 
his first triple the next day in a 2–1 win over the San Francisco Giants.[22] 
Piscotty set a career-high five RBI on August 23 against the San Diego 
Padres at Petco Park, including his first career multi-home run game, while 
adding a triple.[23] The first four-hit game of Piscotty's professional, 
and major league, career was in 6–0 win over the Giants at AT&T Park on 
August 29.[24] While playing the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 28, Piscotty 
was injured on a fly ball into left field when he collided with Peter Bourjos' 
knee, which hit him in the head. He suffered a bruise, but tests results 
were negative for injury, including concussion.[25][26] His regular season 
totals in the major leagues included a .305 batting average, .359 on-base 
percentage, .494 slugging percentage, seven home runs and 39 RBI.[17] Ready 
for game action in time for the playoffs, Piscotty's first playoff appearance 
was in the National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Chicago Cubs. 
There, he hit both his first career postseason home run and double in a 
4–0 win.[27] The Cardinals lost the NLDS in four games, but Piscotty batted 
.375 with 1.000 SLG, three home runs and six RBI in four games.[28] He 
tied for sixth in the National League Rookie of the Year Award voting,[29] 
and was the franchise Player of the Year for 2015.[17] After spring training 
of 2016, Piscotty won the role of starting right fielder for the Cardinals.[30] 
While facing Max Scherzer of the Washington Nationals on May 27, Piscotty 
hit his first career grand slam in a 6–2 win.[31][32] Piscotty finished 
his first full season in the majors batting .273 with 22 home runs and 
85 RBI's. Piscotty also finished the season batting .363 with runners in 
scoring position.[33] With a short, compact swing, Piscotty consistently 
hits to the gaps. In the FSL, which is considered a pitcher-friendly league, 
he hit .292 with a .477 slugging percentage in 63 games. As of September 
2013, he is thought to have a hit tool and approach that should help him 
get to the Major Leagues, but scouts are unsure if he will develop the 
type of power that is associated with corner outfield positions.[34] He 
is rated to have a smooth swing and a strong arm. As a pitcher, he has 
been clocked up to 93 miles per hour (150 km/h).[35] At Stanford, Piscotty 
majored in atmospheric and energy engineering.[2] He completed his bachelor's
