Pablo Emilio Juan Pedro Sandoval, Jr. (born August 11, 1986) is a Venezuelan 
professional baseball third baseman for the Boston Red Sox of Major League 
Baseball (MLB). He previously played seven seasons for the San Francisco 
Giants. Nicknamed "Kung Fu Panda" (or simply "The Panda"), Sandoval is 
a two-time All-Star and has won three World Series championships with the 
Giants. Sandoval hit three home runs in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series, 
becoming the fourth person to hit three home runs in a World Series game, 
and was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP). During the offseason, 
he plays for the Navegantes del Magallanes of the Venezuelan Professional 
Baseball League. Sandoval was born in Venezuela. He grew up an avid baseball 
fan, playing the game with his older brother and following the careers 
of Omar Vizquel and Andrés Galarraga. In 2002, Sandoval was signed by the 
San Francisco Giants. He worked his way through the minor leagues and debuted 
with the Giants in 2008, batting .345 in 41 games. Capable of playing first 
base, third base, and catcher, Sandoval became the Giants' starting third 
baseman in 2009, ceasing to catch that year and playing first base only 
occasionally. In 2009, Sandoval finished second in All-Star Final Vote 
balloting, batting .330 with 25 home runs and 90 runs batted in (RBI) in 
his first full season in the majors. However, Sandoval struggled in 2010 
and was benched during the playoffs for the 2010 World Series, which the 
Giants won. He lost weight before 2011 and hit .315 with 23 home runs in 
117 games. Injuries limited him to 108 games in 2012, but he was selected 
to his second-straight All-Star Game. Then, in Game 1 of the 2012 World 
Series, he joined Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert Pujols as the only 
players to hit three home runs in a World Series Game. For his contributions, 
Sandoval was named the World Series Most Valuable Player as the Giants 
swept the Detroit Tigers. In 2013, he appeared in 141 games, batting .278 
with 14 home runs and 79 RBI. Sandoval was born to Pablo, Sr., and Amelia 
Sandoval on August 11, 1986, in Puerto Cabello, Carabobo, Venezuela. He 
practiced baseball in an empty two-car garage with his older brother, Michael. 
His favorite players were Omar Vizquel (later his teammate on the Giants) 
and Andrés Galarraga. He was born left-handed but wanted to be able to 
play shortstop like Vizquel. Thus, at nine, he taught himself to throw 
right-handed as well. He can still throw with both hands, but throws right-handed 
during games.[1] Sandoval received notice from scouts in 2002, when he 
went to the Dominican Republic for a scouting tournament. A scout for the 
Texas Rangers told Sandoval he would come to Venezuela to sign him, but 
he did not show up. After two weeks, Ciro Villalobos, a scout for the San 
Francisco Giants, offered Sandoval a contract, and he signed.[1] Sandoval 
began his professional career as a catcher in 2004 with the rookie AZL 
Giants, hitting .266 with no home runs and 26 runs batted in (RBI) in 177 
at bats.[2] In 2005, he was used almost entirely as a third baseman while 
playing for the Single-A short season Salem-Keizer Volcanoes.[2] He hit 
.330 (second in the Northwest League to Mike Mooney's .342) with three 
home runs and 50 RBIs (one behind Luis Valbuena's total).[3] His batting 
average slumped in 2006 to .265. He had one home run and 49 RBIs with the 
Single-A Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League that year, splitting 
time between first and third base. In 2007, he played for the Single-A 
advanced San Jose Giants, hitting .287 with 11 homers and 52 RBIs. That 
season, he was used as a catcher and first baseman, and he helped San Jose 
win the California League championship.[2][4] In 2008, he spent time with 
two minor league teams, San Jose and the Double-A Connecticut Defenders 
of the Eastern League, before being called up to the majors. In 273 at 
bats for San Jose, he hit .359 with 12 home runs and 59 RBIs. In 175 at 
bats with Connecticut, he hit .337 with 8 homers and 37 RBIs. In total, 
he hit .350 with 20 home runs and 96 RBIs in 2008.[2] Sandoval was called 
up to the Majors on August 13, 2008.[5] He debuted the next day, going 
0-for-3 in a 7–4 loss to the Houston Astros. In his first Major League 
Baseball (MLB) plate appearance, he hit an RBI sacrifice fly.[6] He got 
his first hit against Mike Hampton in the second inning of his next game, 
August 16, on his way to going 3-for-5 in an 11–5 loss to the Atlanta Braves.[7] 
In 41 games in 2008, he hit .345 with 3 home runs and 24 RBI, striking 
out 14 times and grounding into six double plays in 154 at-bats.[4] He 
hit his first MLB home run on August 27 off Liván Hernández in a 4–1 triumph 
over the Colorado Rockies.[8] On defense, Sandoval was used at first base, 
at third base, and at catcher.[9] Teammate Barry Zito gave Sandoval the 
nickname "Kung Fu Panda"[10] (after the then-recent movie); in a Zito win 
on September 19, the rotund Sandoval scored a run against the Los Angeles 
Dodgers by acrobatically jumping over the tag of catcher Danny Ardoin.[11] 
Sandoval made the Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring training in 
2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup catcher.[9][12] He 
served as a personal catcher for Zito at the beginning of the year.[13] 
On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel 
to beat the Washington Nationals 9–7.[14] Following an elbow injury to 
Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup 
catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has not been used at all as a catcher.[4][15] 
After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote 
that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm 
system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.[16] 
Sandoval's first days in the majors were marked by a tendency to free swing. 
Giants hitting coach Carney Lansford noted that Sandoval contributed to 
the team's drawing the fewest walks in the National League at a time when 
the overall number of walks throughout baseball had increased. "As much 
as I try to get him to be disciplined, it's like caging a lion. He leaves 
the dugout ready to swing the bat. I literally tell him before every at-bat, 
'Swing at a strike.'"[17] Sandoval himself characterized his approach as 
"See ball, swing."[18] In July 2009, he was named a Sprint Final Vote candidate 
for the 80th annual All-Star Game for the final roster spot on the National 
League team.[18] He was edged by Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies 
on the last day of voting.[19] On July 6, Sandoval hit his first career 
grand slam at home at AT&T Park against Sean West of the visiting Florida 
Marlins in a 5–4 victory.[20] He hit his first home run into McCovey Cove 
on July 30, the 50th anniversary of the MLB Debut of Willie McCovey, who 
was in attendance.[21] Sandoval said after the game, "It's special right 
now. I hit McCovey Cove and McCovey's here. He talks to me every time he's 
in the clubhouse."[22] Sandoval set a record for most hits by a Giants 
switch-hitter in a single season with 189 in 2009.[4] Sandoval finished 
the 2009 season with 25 home runs and 90 RBI in 153 games. He had the second-highest 
batting average among NL hitters, at .330 (behind Hanley Ramírez's .342), 
and finished seventh in NL MVP voting.[23] Due to his service time in 2008, 
he was ineligible for the NL Rookie of the Year Award, which went to Chris 
Coghlan.[24] During the offseason, the Giants had Sandoval work on losing 
weight.[25] Sandoval, however, saw a sophomore slump in 2010. He struggled 
all season to come close to his 2009 totals and saw himself dropped to 
eighth in the batting order in a game on June 5.[4] One bright spot in 
the season came on August 12, when Pat Burrell and Sandoval hit back-to-back 
home runs against Randy Wells of the Cubs in an 8–7 victory, but Sandoval's 
home run snapped a 46-game home run drought.[26] Sandoval finished the 
season with a .268 batting average, 13 home runs, and 63 RBI. He saw his 
batting average, as a right-handed hitter, plummet over 150 points from 
his 2009 batting average; he dropped from .379 to .227. His batting average 
with runners in scoring position also dropped during this period, from 
.301 in 2009 to .208 in 2010.[4] Overweight and unproductive, he was benched 
during the 2010 National League Championship Series for Juan Uribe and 
limited to three at-bats in the 2010 World Series. However, Sandoval earned 
his first World Series ring as the Giants won their first World Series 
since 1954, securing the championship in five games over the Texas Rangers.[27][28][29] 
Entering 2011, the Giants made a publicized campaign called "Operation 
Panda", which was aimed at getting Sandoval into better shape during the 
offseason. By the end of 2010, he had weighed 278 pounds. Sandoval hired 
Triple Threat Performance of Tempe, Arizona, to help him lose weight and 
help improve his performance. "Operation Panda" worked masterfully, with 
the third baseman losing 30-plus pounds,[30] and more importantly, it led 
to results on the field for Sandoval. After a subpar 2010 season, Sandoval 
returned to his 2009 form. He got off to a good start in 2011, but suffered 
a broken right hamate bone in late April and missed 41 games.[31] He was 
activated off the DL on June 14 and had a 22-game hitting streak from June 
19 through July 14.[4][32] On July 10, 2011, Sandoval was selected to the 
National League All-Star team, becoming the first All-Star position player 
for the Giants since Barry Bonds in 2007. In his first All-Star at bat, 
Sandoval hit an RBI ground-rule double against Brandon League, helping 
the NL win the 2011 MLB All-Star Game.[33] On September 15, 2011, Sandoval 
hit for the cycle at Colorado against pitcher Jhoulys Chacín. He had (in 
order) a two-run HR in the 1st, single in the 2nd, double in the 5th and 
a triple in the 6th.[34] On September 19, 2011, Sandoval earned his first 
career "NL Player of the Week" Award.[35] In 2011, Sandoval hit .315 with 
23 home runs and 70 RBIs, a significant improvement from 2010. He only 
had 426 at bats for the season, down significantly from his totals from 
2009 and 2010 due to the injury he suffered.[4] On April 26, 2012, Sandoval 
hit a single in the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds 
at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. This was the 19th consecutive 
game since Opening Day in which Sandoval had a hit, setting a Giants franchise 
record for longest consecutive hitting streak to begin a season. The previous 
record – of 18 games – was set by Johnny Rucker in 1945.[36] Sandoval ran 
it up to 20 before it was snapped.[4] However, in May, Sandoval fractured 
his left hamate bone, an injury which kept him out until early June. Giants' 
head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said the day before Sandoval had 
surgery, "I guess the good news is both [hamate bones] will be gone tomorrow 
and he can't do it again."[37][38] On July 1, 2012, it was announced that 
Sandoval had beaten out David Wright for his second All-Star team, as the 
starting third baseman for the National League. The choice was considered 
somewhat controversial by fans and executives (particularly Sandy Alderson), 
as David Wright had a significantly higher batting average than Sandoval 
at the time. Wright made the team as a reserve, and as a reporter pointed 
out, Sandoval in 2009 "outperformed Wright, who was the fans' choice to 
start."[39] On July 10, at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, Sandoval highlighted 
the NL's five-run opening inning with the first bases-loaded triple in 
the history of the Midsummer Classic, off of reigning American League (AL) 
Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander.[40] Sandoval injured his left hamstring 
at the end of July and was on the DL for the second time in 2012, from 
July 28 through August 13.[41][42] On September 20, he homered from both 
sides of the plate in a 9–2 victory over Colorado, becoming the sixth San 
Francisco Giant to accomplish the feat.[43] In 108 games (396 at bats), 
Sandoval batted .283 with 112 hits, 12 home runs, and 63 RBI.[4] On October 
24, 2012, in Game 1 of the 2012 World Series, Sandoval hit three home runs 
— two of them off Verlander. He joined Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and Albert 
Pujols as the only players in MLB history to hit three home runs in a World 
Series game, and is the first in history to hit those home runs in his 
first three plate appearances (in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th innings).[44][45] 
On October 28, Sandoval was named the World Series MVP.[27][28] He also 
won the Babe Ruth Award for his overall postseason performance.[46] Sandoval 
set a new Giants franchise record for most hits in a postseason with 24, 
which included six home runs.[47] With the Giants trailing 1–0 in the ninth 
inning on April 30, 2013, Sandoval hit a two-run home run against J. J. 
Putz to give them a 2–1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[48] At the 
end of April, he had 35 hits, tied for the NL lead with Starling Marte 
and, since 1900, the largest April total by a Giant.[4] On May 22, at AT&T 
Park and fighting the flu, he hit a 10th-inning, two-run home run against 
Yunesky Maya to give the Giants a 4–2 victory over Washington.[49] From 
June 9 through June 23, he was on the DL with a left foot injury.[50][51] 
On August 16, he had four hits and reached safely in all six plate appearances 
during a 14–10 victory over the Miami Marlins.[52] He hit three home runs 
on September 4 in a 13–5 victory over the Padres.[53] With that performance, 
Sandoval joined Ruth, Jackson, Pujols, George Brett, and Adrián Beltré 
as the only players to have three-homer games in both the regular season 
and the playoffs. In 141 games, Sandoval batted .278 with 146 hits, 14 
home runs, and 79 RBI.[4] "Operation Panda" did not last, and by the end 
of 2013, Sandoval again needed to lose weight. Encouraged by several of 
his teammates and Giants' general manager Brian Sabean, he showed up at 
spring training several pounds lighter.[54] The weight loss did not lead 
to immediate results for Sandoval, who batted .167 with just six RBI in 
his first 31 games through May 6. However, over his next 42 games through 
June 21, he batted .351 with seven home runs and 27 RBI.[55] In the 2014 
NLDS, with a game-tying, RBI double in the top of the 9th inning against 
the Washington Nationals, Sandoval extended his National League postseason 
hitting record to 13 consecutive games. In game 3 of the 2014 World Series, 
his post-season on-base streak ended at 25. In game 4, while ailing with 
the flu, his 13th multi-hit post-season game brought him to second in that 
category in franchise history, behind Frankie Frisch. In Kansas City, in 
Game 7 of the World Series, Sandoval recorded his 26th hit of the postseason, 
setting a new record and caught Royals batter Salvador Pérez's pop-up foul 
ball for the final out to clinch the World Series championship for the 
San Francisco Giants. It was the Giants' third World Championship in a 
span of five seasons.[56] Sandoval became a free agent after the season 
ended. On November 24, 2014, Sandoval came to an agreement with the Boston 
Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option 
of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out.[57][58] The deal was officially 
announced on November 25.[59] Sandoval said, "It was a tough decision for 
me. It took me a long time to be sure that I was going to make the right 
decision... But I want a new challenge. I made that choice to be here in 
Boston because I need a new challenge."[60] In 126 games of 2015, Sandoval 
batted .245 with 10 home runs and 47 RBI, all career lows since his first 
full season in 2009. Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports reported in January 2016 
that Sandoval had switched agents and was now represented by Rick Thurman 
and Rafa Nieves of Beverly Hills Sports Council.[61] Looking to improve 
upon his first season in Boston, Sandoval struggled in spring training, 
and was replaced by Travis Shaw as the starting third baseman.[62] On April 
13, 2016, Sandoval was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder 
strain.[63] On May 3, 2016, Sandoval underwent surgery on his left shoulder, 
sidelining him for the remainder of the season. On September 24, manager 
John Farrell told reporters that Sandoval was progressing ahead of schedule 
in his rehab, and could be an option for the Red Sox in the postseason 
should a need arise, as the team did acquire Aaron Hill during the season 
to help with third base depth.[64] Sandoval also made an effort at improving 
his fitness, losing 15 pounds by August while working at the Red Sox facility 
in Fort Myers.[65] Due to the injury Sandoval ended his 2016 season with 
6 at bats.[66] Like many Venezuelan MLB players, Sandoval plays in the 
Venezuelan Winter League during the offseason. He plays for the Navegantes 
del Magallanes. In 2013, Sandoval led his team to its first series title 
since the 2002 winter ball season. He was named the MVP of the Venezuelan 
postseason, three months after being named the 2012 World Series MVP. Sandoval 
said, "There's nothing like being champion here in Venezuela with the Navegantes. 
Although it can't be compared with winning the World Series, because they're 
different things. But it's very special to be champion here."[67] Sandoval's 
parents run a mechanical-engineering firm in Valencia, Venezuela.[1] His 
older brother, Michael, played in the Minnesota Twins' organization from 
1999 through 2004 and, after a year of independent ball in 2009, played 
for San Jose in 2010.[1][68] Sandoval is a devout Roman Catholic, and makes 
the sign of the cross after each base hit. He attributes his success to 
his faith, saying it is important to be "seizing the opportunities offered 
in life by God and the need to fight tirelessly, not to survive but to 
excel."[69] Sandoval has a daughter, Yoleadny (b. 2009), from his marriage
