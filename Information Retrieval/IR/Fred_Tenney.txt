As player As manager Frederick Tenney (November 26, 1871 – July 3, 1952) 
was an American professional baseball player whose career spanned 20 seasons, 
17 of which were spent with the Major League Baseball (MLB) Boston Beaneaters/Doves/Rustlers 
(1894–1907, 1911) and the New York Giants (1908–1909). Described as "one 
of the best defensive first basemen of all time", Tenney is credited with 
originating the 3-6-3 double play and originating the style of playing 
off the first base foul line and deep, as modern first basemen do.[1][2] 
Over his career, Tenney compiled a batting average of .294, 1,278 runs 
scored, 2,231 hits, 22 home runs, and 688 runs batted in (RBI) in 1,994 
games played. Born in Georgetown, Massachusetts, Tenney was one of the 
first players to enter the league after graduating college, where he served 
as a left-handed catcher for Brown University. Signing with the Beaneaters, 
Tenney spent the next 14 seasons with the team, including a three-year 
managerial stint from 1905–1907. In December 1907 Tenney was traded to 
the Giants as a part of an eight-man deal; after two years playing for 
New York, he re-signed with the Boston club, where he played for and managed 
the team in 1911. After retiring from baseball, Tenney worked for the Equitable 
Life Insurance Society before his death in Boston on July 3, 1952. Tenney 
was born in Georgetown, Massachusetts, the third of five children to Charles 
William and Sarah Lambert (née DeBacon) Tenney.[3] Charles Tenney attended 
Dummer Academy from 1850 to 1853, and served for the 50th Massachusetts 
Regiment in the Civil War, where he nearly died due to "intense suffering".[3] 
Growing up, Fred led his class in drawing and sketching.[4] He reportedly 
started playing baseball around 1880.[5] In 1892, Tenney played his first 
professional game for the Binghamton Bingos of the Eastern League, going 
1 for 4 with a single.[6] He played as Brown University's catcher for the 
1893 and 1894 seasons. In 1894, the team had a 23–8 record and were selected 
as national champions by Harper's Weekly.[7] The night of his senior dinner, 
Tenney received a telephone message from Frank Selee, the manager of the 
Beaneaters, asking him to play a game for the team at catcher, due to the 
injuries of other players.[7][8] In his MLB debut on June 16, 1894, Tenney 
had to be removed from the game in the fifth inning due to a fractured 
finger on his throwing hand from a foul tip. After Tenney had his finger 
addressed, James Billings, an owner of the Beaneaters, offered him a contract 
worth US$300 a month from that day.[9] Tenney, later writing about the 
day, stated: I thought they were trying to have a little joke with me, 
and I concluded that I could do a little kidding myself. So I thought I 
would call their bluff by asking for some advance money. I screwed up my 
courage and asked Mr. Billings whether, if I signed the contract at once, 
I could get some advance money. He asked how much I wanted, and I thought 
I would mention a big sum in order to call their bluff good and strong. 
So I said $150. He consulted with Mr. Conant, another Director, and said 
that I could have the money all right, and asked me how I would like to 
have it– cash or check. [...] I replied that I would take half cash and 
then half in check, and immediately he wrote out a check for $75, counted 
out $75 in cash, shoved the contract over to me to sign, laying the cash 
and check beside it. He returned to the team a month later, and finished 
the year batting .395 in 27 games.[8] The following season, Tenney moved 
to the outfield due to an erratic throwing arm behind the plate, according 
to manager Selee.[8] For the season, he hit .272 in 49 games, while also 
playing minor league baseball for the New Bedford Whalers. In 1896, Tenney 
again caught and played outfield; offensively, however, Tenney hit .336 
in nearly double the games from the previous year (88) despite playing 
in the minors for the Springfield Ponies.[10] In 1897, Tenney moved to 
first base to replace the aging Tom Tucker. According to Alfred Henry Spink, 
within two weeks of the move it was evident that Tenney had become "one 
of the finest first sackers that the game [had] ever seen."[11] On June 
14, 1897, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Tenney turned the first 
3-6-3 double play in MLB history.[12] Offensively, Tenney led MLB in plate 
appearances (646) and tied Duff Cooley, Gene DeMontreville, and George 
Van Haltren for the lead in at bats (566) as the Boston club became National 
League (NL) champions with a 93–39 record.[13][14] Boston again won the 
NL in 1898 while Tenney hit .328 with 62 RBIs. In 1899 he collected 209 
hits, fifth most in MLB, and recorded 17 triples, good for fourth best 
in MLB.[15] In 1900 Tenney, at age 28, batted .279 over 112 games played.[16] 
He began a streak of seven consecutive seasons where he led the NL in assists 
in 1901; he holds the record for most seasons leading a league in assists, 
with eight, including one in 1899.[1] He was suspended for ten games for 
fighting Pittsburg Pirates manager Fred Clarke in May 1902,[8][17] and 
finished the 1902 season with the second most sacrifice hits (29) in the 
majors, to go along with a .315 average.[10][18] Throughout the 1901–1902 
seasons, Tenney received contract offers worth up to $7,000 ($193,172.00 
in 2012) from St. Louis, Cleveland, and Detroit;[8] Tenney, however, decided 
to remain in Boston, and was named captain of the club in 1903.[1] For 
the season, he hit .313, with 41 RBIs and three home runs, as he led his 
team in walks (70) and had the best on-base percentage mark (.415) on the 
squad.[19] In 1904, Tenney again led his team in walks and on-base percentage, 
as he tied for the team lead in runs with Ed Abbaticchio.[20] He was named 
manager of the team in 1905, but did not receive additional pay; he was, 
however, offered a bonus if the team didn't lose money.[8] In 1905, Tenney 
tried to sign William Clarence Matthews, an African-American middle infielder 
from Harvard University, to a contract. Tenney later retracted his offer 
due to pressure from MLB players.[21] Defensively, he led the majors in 
errors committed by a first baseman and finished second in most putouts 
for any position.[22] Tenney led the 1906 Beaneaters to a 49–102 record. 
For the second straight year, the Boston team lost more than 100 games.[23] 
After a 158–295 record as manager, on December 3, 1907, Tenney was traded 
to the Giants, along with Al Bridwell and Tom Needham, for Frank Bowerman, 
George Browne, Bill Dahlen, Cecil Ferguson and Dan McGann;[10] the trade 
was called "one of the biggest deals in the history of National League 
baseball".[24] In his first season with the Giants, Tenney led MLB with 
684 plate appearances and finished third in runs scored, with 101.[25] 
In a game against the Chicago Cubs on September 23, Tenney could not play 
due to an attack of lumbago; it was the only game he did not play in during 
the season.[26] Rookie Fred Merkle took his spot at first base. The game 
was at a 1–1 tie in the bottom of the ninth. Merkle, after hitting a single, 
was at first, and Moose McCormick was at third, with two outs. Al Bridwell 
singled to center field, but Hank O'Day called Merkle out because Merkle 
had not touched second base.[26] O'Day ruled the game a 1–1 tie due to 
darkness.[26] With both teams finishing the season at a 98–55 record, a 
replay game had to be played to determine who would win the National League 
pennant. The game was held on October 8, with the Cubs winning, 4–2.[26] 
After batting a career low .235 in 1909, Tenney was released by the Giants.[8][27] 
He spent the 1910 season as a player–manager for the minor league Lowell 
Tigers, leading the team to a 65–57 record, good for fourth (out of eight 
teams) in the New England League.[28] On December 19, 1910, Tenney signed 
a two-year contract with the Boston Rustlers. For the 1911 season, Tenney 
hit .263 over 102 games.[10] He was released by the Braves on March 20, 
1912, after 44–107 record in one season; Tenney was paid not to manage 
for the second year on his contract.[8] In 1916, he bought the Newark Indians 
of the International League with James R. Price for $25,000 ($527,450 in 
2012).[29][30] Mayor Thomas Lynch Raymond declared April 27 a "half-holiday" 
for the city of Newark for the Indians' Opening Day.[31] Tenney played 
in 16 games for the Indians, hitting .318 with seven hits over 22 at-bats, 
and managed the team to a 52–87 record.[32][33] Tenney married Bessie Farnham 
Berry on October 21, 1895. The couple had two children together; Barbra, 
born July 4, 1899, and Ruth, born December 8, 1901.[3] Early in his career, 
he refused to play baseball on Sundays due to his religion,[3] although 
he later changed his mind.[34] Tenney was known as the "Soiled Collegian" 
at the major league level because it was unpopular for college players 
to become professional.[35] Tenney served as a journalist for The Boston 
Post, Baseball Magazine, and The New York Times.[8] He painted and sketched 
during the winter.[4] After retiring from baseball, Tenney worked for the 
Equitable Life Insurance Society and continued writing for The New York 
Times. In 1912, he was vice-president of the Usher–Stoughton shoe manufacturing 
company in Lynn, Massachusetts; later, he formed the Tenney–Spinney Shoe 
Company in partnership with Henry Spinney.[36][37] He was balloted for 
the National Baseball Hall of Fame from 1936–1942 and again in 1946, but 
never received more than eight votes, receiving eight (3.1% of total ballots 
cast) during the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting in 1938.[10] Tenney died 
on July 3, 1952 at Massachusetts General Hospital after a long illness.[8][35]
