Justin Louis "Joba" Chamberlain (/ˈdʒɒbə/ JOB-ə September 23, 1985) is 
an American professional baseball relief pitcher who is a free agent. He 
previously played for the New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City 
Royals, and Cleveland Indians. Chamberlain played college baseball for 
the Nebraska Cornhuskers before the Yankees selected him in the first round 
of the 2006 MLB draft. He ascended through the minor leagues and made his 
MLB debut in 2007 as a relief pitcher during the Yankees' pursuit of a 
berth in the MLB postseason. The Yankees adhered to what became known as 
the "Joba Rules", where they carefully monitored and limited his appearances. 
During the 2008 season, the Yankees transitioned Chamberlain to the starting 
rotation, and he suffered a shoulder injury later in the season. Chamberlain 
struggled as a starter in 2009, and was shifted back to a relief role. 
He signed as a free agent with the Tigers before the 2014 season, and re-signed 
with the Tigers for 2015, but was released during the season. He returned 
to MLB later in 2015 with Kansas City. Joba was born Justin Louis Heath 
on September 23, 1985.[1][2] He grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska.[3] Chamberlain's 
parents, Harlan Chamberlain and Jackie Standley, were never married and 
split up when Joba was 18 months old. Some sources say that Harlan Chamberlain 
obtained full custody of Joba when he was 3 years old,[4] but Standley 
claims that Joba lived with her most of the time until he was 10 when she 
had his surname legally changed from Heath, her maiden name, to Chamberlain. 
Standley began abusing drugs when Joba was 4 or 5 and says that she and 
Joba currently speak to each other only rarely.[2] Chamberlain's father 
was born on the Winnebago Indian Reservation, but had to leave to be treated 
for polio.[5] Chamberlain still has family living on Native American reservations.[6] 
As of 2014, he was one of only three active non-Hispanic Native American 
players in Major League Baseball, with the others being Kyle Lohse of the 
Milwaukee Brewers and Jacoby Ellsbury of the New York Yankees.[7] When 
Joba (then Justin) was a little boy, his two-year-old cousin was unable 
to pronounce her brother (Joba's other cousin) Joshua's name correctly, 
pronouncing it as Joba instead. Harlan Chamberlain heard this and liked 
the nickname, so he began referring to Justin (instead of cousin Joshua) 
as Joba. Harlan said the name was "dynamic." Joba agreed, and eventually 
had his name legally changed.[8] Joba served as a ball boy and bat boy 
for Lincoln Northeast High School's state championship baseball team, and 
eventually graduated from Northeast. He did not jump straight to college; 
to help pay the bills, Joba briefly worked for the city of Lincoln's maintenance 
department.[5][9] Chamberlain played American Legion Baseball over the 
summer of 2004 for Coach Steve Eckman, going 4–4 with a 1.36 earned run 
average (ERA), as he struck out 137 hitters and walked only 21 en route 
to all-state honors. He recorded 21 strikeouts over 12 shutout innings 
in a matchup against future fellow Nebraska star Johnny Dorn's team, a 
15-inning game won by Grand Island, 1–0. He also hit .505 with 11 homers, 
11 doubles and 37 RBIs as a two-way performer. At Lincoln Northeast High 
School for coaches Bill Fagler and Doug Kaltenberger he garnered second-team 
Super State honors from the Lincoln Journal Star, going 3–2 with a 3.35 
ERA, as he struck out 29 in 31.1 innings as a senior.[10] Chamberlain started 
his college career playing for the University of Nebraska at Kearney Lopers 
under coach Damon Day, leading the team in ERA (5.23), opponents' batting 
average (.250), strikeouts (49), and complete games (4) in just 8 starts 
as a freshman, before transferring to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
He helped the Cornhuskers reach the 2005 College World Series, and helped 
lead Nebraska to its first College World Series win. He had a 10–2 won/loss 
record with a 2.81 ERA for the year, and his 2005 stats included 5 double-digit 
strikeout games. Triceps tendinitis limited his 2006 season but he still 
pitched in 14 games, posting a 6–5 record with a 3.93 ERA and 102 strikeouts 
in 89.1 innings.[10] During the 2004–2005 college off-season Chamberlain 
pitched for the Nebraska Bruins of the National Baseball Congress. He started 
six games in 2005, recording a 5–0 record and a 1.59 ERA.[11] Chamberlain 
was drafted 41st overall by the New York Yankees in the 2006 Major League 
Baseball draft; the Yankees received that draft pick as free agent compensation 
for Tom Gordon, who signed with the Philadelphia Phillies. Chamberlain 
did not pitch in the organized minors during the 2006 season, but pitched 
in the winter league in Hawaii, posting a 2.63 ERA for the West Oahu CaneFires.[12] 
Before the 2007 season, Baseball America ranked Chamberlain as the 4th-best 
prospect in the pitching-rich Yankee organization, and the 75th-best prospect 
in Major League Baseball, and ranked his fastball as the best in the Yankee 
farm system. He spent the first part of his 2007 season on the Single-A 
Advanced Tampa Yankees in the Florida State League. He went 4–0 with a 
2.03 ERA in 7 games, and had 51 strikeouts and 11 walks. He was then promoted 
to the Double-A Trenton Thunder in the Eastern League, where he was 4–2 
in 7 games with a 3.43 ERA and 64 strikeouts. He was named to the U.S. 
Team in the 2007 All-Star Futures Game July 8 at AT&T Park. Chamberlain 
pitched the third inning, striking out one, walking one, and allowing a 
hit and an earned run.[13] On July 24, 2007, Chamberlain was promoted to 
Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and made his first start the next day, 
striking out 10 in 5 innings and earning his first Triple-A victory. While 
the Yankees still saw him as a starter in the future, the team announced 
on July 29, 2007, that Chamberlain would be moved to the Scranton-Wilkes 
Barre bullpen, and he made his first appearance the next day, striking 
out the side in 1 inning pitched and hitting 100 on the radar gun three 
times. On August 1, Joba went back to Trenton to make a relief appearance, 
striking out 2 batters in a 1–2–3 8th inning. He then came back to Scranton, 
pitching 2 innings and striking out 5 batters.[14][15] On August 7, 2007, 
the Yankees purchased Chamberlain's contract, elevating him to the major 
leagues for the first time in his career.[16][17] In his debut, a Yankees 
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, Chamberlain struck out the first batter 
he faced and went on to pitch two scoreless innings, striking out two.[citation 
needed] Chamberlain's usage in games was initially restricted by what were 
referred to as the "Joba Rules", which prevented him from pitching on consecutive 
days and gave him an additional day of rest for each inning pitched in 
an outing.[18] On August 30, 2007, during a game against the Boston Red 
Sox, Chamberlain threw two pitches over the head of Kevin Youkilis. Chamberlain 
was subsequently ejected for the first time in his Major League career. 
The next day, Chamberlain was sentenced to a two-game suspension and a 
$1,000 fine.[19] In Game 2 of the 2007 ALDS against the Cleveland Indians, 
Chamberlain was pitching in the bottom of the eighth with the Yankees leading 
1–0. Suddenly, a host of small insects swarmed the field.[20] He was repeatedly 
sprayed down with insect repellent, which had no apparent deterrent effect 
on the midges. Chamberlain threw 2 wild pitches, yielding the tying run. 
The Indians went on to win the game 2–1. The Yankees would then lose the 
Division Series against the Indians in 4 games in the best-of-five series.[21] 
On March 20, 2008, the Yankees announced that Chamberlain would start the 
season in the bullpen. Manager Joe Girardi stated that Chamberlain would 
be used 'without restrictions' but that the team's use of Chamberlain would 
be guided by common sense.[22] Chamberlain was granted a leave of absence 
on April 13, 2008, when he received news that his father, Harlan, was in 
the hospital after collapsing at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska.[23] At 
the time of his leave, Joba had a record of 1–0, with a 0.00 ERA, six strikeouts, 
and 3 holds in 4 games and 5 1⁄3 innings pitched. Chamberlain returned 
from the bereavement in time for the 2nd game against the Baltimore Orioles 
on April 19, 2008. On April 20, Hank Steinbrenner announced that he wanted 
Chamberlain to be moved into the rotation.[24] In May, Girardi announced 
Chamberlain was being transitioned into the starting rotation. On June 
3, Chamberlain made his first MLB start against Roy Halladay and the Toronto 
Blue Jays lasting only 2 1⁄3 innings while allowing 2 runs, a hit and 4 
walks. On June 25, Chamberlain earned his first career win as a starter, 
throwing 6 2⁄3 scoreless innings against the Pittsburgh Pirates, en route 
to a 10–0 Yankees victory.[25] On July 25, Chamberlain threw 7 shutout 
innings against the Red Sox, outdueling Red Sox ace Josh Beckett, allowing 
only 3 hits and striking out 9. The Yankees won the game 1–0.[26] On August 
4, Chamberlain injured his shoulder in a game against the Texas Rangers 
and was placed on the 15-day disabled list with rotator cuff tendinitis.[27] 
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman later acknowledged that this injury 
had a lasting effect.[28] Chamberlain ended the season with a 3–1 record 
and eight no-decisions.[29] Chamberlain learned about his role in the Yankees 
rotation in November, and stated that knowing about the team's plans to 
use him as a starter rather than as a reliever who would move into a starting 
role at some point in the middle of the season (as was the case in 2008) 
changes his mental approach to preparing for the season, and makes things 
easier on him.[30] During the All-Star break, Chamberlain went back home 
to Lincoln, Nebraska to get his mind off things by playing with his son 
so he could "be himself" and get more confidence on the mound.[31] Chamberlain 
continued to struggle in the second half of the season. The Yankees considered 
demoting him to the minor leagues and leaving him off of the postseason 
roster,[32] but the Yankees kept Chamberlain on the roster in a set-up 
role as the Yankees went with a three-man starting rotation en route to 
winning the 2009 World Series. Heading into the new season, before spring 
training Yankees manager Joe Girardi declared that there would be competition 
for the fifth spot in the Yankees starting rotation. The favorites were 
most notably Chamberlain and Phil Hughes. Towards the end of spring training, 
Hughes was declared the winner, which sent Chamberlain back to the bullpen.[33] 
From the start of the season through July Chamberlain struggled, with an 
ERA over 5. His performance improved in August and September; in Chamberlain's 
last 28 appearances of the 2010 regular season, his ERA was 2.38.[34] The 
Yankees ruled out using Chamberlain as a starting pitcher in 2011[35] arguing 
that his pitches have greater velocity when he pitches in relief.[36] At 
the beginning of the season, he was moved to the seventh-inning role to 
accommodate Rafael Soriano. He would later become the set-up man to Mariano 
Rivera briefly after Soriano went on the disabled list. Chamberlain was 
placed on the 15 day-disabled list on June 8 due to an elbow injury. He 
had Tommy John surgery performed on June 16 to repair a torn ligament in 
his right elbow and was knocked out for the rest of the season.[37] In 
January 2012, the Yankees and Chamberlain agreed on a one-year, non-guaranteed 
contract worth approximately $1.675 million.[citation needed] On March 
22, 2012, Chamberlain injured his right leg while bouncing on a trampoline 
in a Tampa jump center;[38] he suffered an open dislocation of his ankle. 
Initial reports indicated that he had lost so much blood that onlookers 
at the scene feared that he might bleed to death.[39][40] Chamberlain, 
however, later discredited these accusations during a press conference 
stating that he never suffered any life-threatening injury nor did he lose 
much blood.[citation needed] Chamberlain began the 2012 season on the 60-day 
disabled list due to the ankle injury, and he was recovering from the Tommy 
John surgery he had previously. He returned on August 1, 2012, against 
the Baltimore Orioles. In the top of the 12th inning of Game 4 of the 2012 
American League Division Series, Chamberlain was struck on the elbow by 
a broken bat by Matt Wieters of the Orioles and left the game. Despite 
his injury, the Yankees won the series over Baltimore in five games, but 
were swept in the 2012 American League Championship Series by the Detroit 
Tigers. On May 2, 2013, Chamberlain was placed on the 15-day disabled list 
with a right oblique strain.[41] He was activated from the DL on May 28, 
2013. On September 5, 2013, Chamberlain was ejected for the second time 
in his major league career in a 9–8 Yankees loss against the Red Sox. With 
Jacoby Ellsbury on second after a stolen base and Shane Victorino at the 
plate with one out in the 10th inning, Victorino attempted to check his 
swing on a 1-2 pitch and first base umpire Joe West said Victorino did 
not swing, Victorino then singled in the go-ahead run on the very next 
pitch, Chamberlain was then ejected by West for arguing the check swing 
call after being removed from the game.[42] On December 13, 2013, the Tigers 
signed Chamberlain to a one-year contract, worth $2.5 million plus incentives.[43] 
Chamberlain began the year as the Tigers' set-up man. Chamberlain earned 
a save on April 22, 2014, in a 8–6 win over the Chicago White Sox, which 
was only the 6th of his career. Chamberlain was given the save opportunity 
after Phil Coke was handed an 8–3 lead and surrendered three runs, while 
closer Joe Nathan was given rest due to recent struggles. Chamberlain finished 
the 2014 season with a 2–5 record and a 3.57 ERA, allowing 57 hits in 63 
innings with 24 walks and 59 strikeouts. On February 24, 2015, the Tigers 
re-signed Chamberlain to one-year, $1 million contract plus incentives.[44][45] 
He had a 1.26 ERA through May, but his ERA increased to 4.09 in his next 
ten appearances. He allowed nine runs, eight earned, on 14 hits over 7 
2⁄3 innings since June 1. He was designated for assignment by the Tigers 
on July 3.[46][47] On July 10, 2015, Chamberlain was given his unconditional 
release.[48] On July 21, 2015, Chamberlain signed a minor league contract 
with the Toronto Blue Jays.[49] He was assigned to the Buffalo Bisons of 
the International League.[50] Chamberlain exercised an opt-out in his contract 
on August 14, and became a free agent.[51] On August 16, 2015, Chamberlain 
signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals.[52] After pitching 
in eight games for the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Class AAA Pacific Coast 
League, the Royals promoted Chamberlain to the major leagues on September 
7.[53] In 6 appearances for the Royals, Chamberlain has a 7.94 ERA. Overall, 
Chamberlain's ERA was 4.88 in 36 total games combined with both the Tigers 
and Royals in 2015. He was designated for assignment on October 27, 2015, 
the same day the Royals played the first game of the 2015 World Series.[54] 
The Royals would eventually beat the New York Mets in 5 games of the postseason 
finals, giving them their first championship in 30 years. Chamberlain would 
still be eligible to receive his second championship ring for playing at 
least a few games for the Royals in the regular season. On December 1, 
2015, Chamberlain signed a minor league deal with the Cleveland Indians.[55] 
The Indians purchased his contract on April 4, 2016 and added him to the 
opening day roster.[56] He was designated for assignment on July 4, and 
released July 10, 2016, after declining an outright assignment.[57] Joba 
throws a four-seam fastball that early in his career was regularly in the 
mid-to-upper 90s, topping out at 101 mph. Since his arm surgery, his fastball 
is in the 93-94 mph range, topping out around 97-98. He also throws a slider 
anywhere from 82 to 88 mph, a curveball at 78–81 mph, and an occasional 
changeup at 83–85 mph.[58] Chamberlain has one son, Karter.[5] Chamberlain 
made an appearance in the season 2 episode 15 episode of Man v. Food which 
airs on the Travel Channel. The episode was filmed in Brooklyn and featured 
Chamberlain coaching host Adam Richman through an eating challenge. On 
October 18, 2008, at 1:00 a.m. Chamberlain was arrested near Lincoln for 
suspicion of driving under the influence, speeding, and having an open 
container of alcohol in his vehicle. A Nebraska State Patrol spokesperson 
said Chamberlain was stopped for speeding on U.S. Route 77 near Lincoln.[59][60] 
His arrest was captured on police video, which later aired on the "Drivers 
13" episode of truTV Presents: World's Dumbest....[61] His arraignment 
was postponed four times: in December 2008, January 2009, and twice in 
March 2009, all by Chamberlain's request.[62][63][64] He pleaded guilty
