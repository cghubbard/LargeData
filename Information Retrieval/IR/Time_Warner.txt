Time Warner Inc. (TWI, at one former interval named AOL Time Warner, stylized 
as TimeWarner since 2003) is an American multinational media and entertainment 
conglomerate headquartered in the Time Warner Center in New York City.[5] 
It is currently the world's third largest television networks and filmed 
TV and entertainment company in terms of revenue (after Comcast and The 
Walt Disney Company), and at one time was the world's largest media conglomerate.[6][7][8][9] 
Time Warner was formed in 1990 through the merger of Time Inc. and Warner 
Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the 
former Warner Communications, as well as HBO (a Time Inc. subsidiary prior 
to the Warner merger) and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (acquired in 
1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, 
with a limited amount of publishing operations. Among its assets are Home 
Box Office, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW Television Network, Warner 
Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, it owns 10% of Hulu.[10] 
In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, 
Time Warner Cable, Warner Books, and Warner Music Group. All of these operations 
were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies 
between 2004 and 2014. On October 22, 2016, AT&T announced its intent to 
acquire Time Warner for $85 billion.[11][12] Time Warner consists of three 
divisions; Home Box Office Inc. (HBO), Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., 
and Warner Bros.[13] Home Box Office Inc. operates the namesake HBO premium 
television service as well as sister service Cinemax. HBO- and Cinemax-branded 
channels are currently available in over 70 countries around the world, 
and HBO programming is licensed to other television networks in over 150 
countries.[14] In 2012 HBO was the #1 premium pay television service in 
primetime television and total day ratings.[14] In 2013 the network received 
five Golden Globes and 23 primetime Emmy Awards.[15] HBO’s programming 
includes the airing of feature films, HBO Documentary Films, HBO original 
films, and HBO original programming, HBO Sports (live HBO Boxing events). 
The network has developed content distribution platforms, like HBO GO[16] 
and Max GO to help support and deliver programming to users via online 
and mobile devices. HBO's notable original programming includes Sex and 
the City, The Sopranos, Entourage, Deadwood, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire, 
Game of Thrones, Girls, Westworld, and Veep, as well as motion pictures, 
mini-series, boxing matches and sports programs, comedy specials, family 
programming and documentaries. In 2011, Cinemax launched its first original 
primetime series, Strike Back, and has subsequently launched the original 
primetime series, Hunted and Banshee.[17] Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. 
(Turner) operates international news, entertainment, animation, young adult 
and kids media networks as well as related businesses. Turner brands include 
CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Turner Classic Movies, truTV, Turner 
Sports, and more. Turner's brands and sub brands reach broad domestic and 
international audiences.[18] In addition to television network programming, 
Turner manages digital sports entities, including bleacherreport.com NBA.com, 
PGA.com and NCAA.com. Turner’s TBS channel reaches large audiences in the 
18- to 34-year-old bracket[19] and its news network, CNN, provides a 24-hour 
news network that delivers news and analysis to domestic and international 
audiences across multiple platforms. Turner Sports produces sports programming 
and content for the Turner Networks and related digital properties. Turner 
Sports’ television line-up includes NBA and MLB games, the NCAA Tournament 
Games, and the PGA Championship. Turner operates PGA.com and related digital 
properties of the PGA under agreements with the PGA. Turner and the NBA 
jointly manage a portfolio of the NBA’s digital businesses, including NBA 
TV, NBA.com, NBA League Pass, NBA Mobile and the NBA GameTime app and also 
MLB jointly manage a portfolio of the MLB's digital businesses including 
MLB Network, MLB.com, MLB Extra Innings and the MLB Network App.[20] Warner 
Bros. businesses range from feature film and TV to home entertainment production 
and worldwide distribution to home video, digital distribution, animation, 
comic books, licensing and international cinemas and broadcasting. In 2012 
the Warner Bros. Pictures Group grossed 4.3 billion dollars at the worldwide 
box office.[21] Home Video is the industry leader with a 21% market share 
in total DVD and Blu-ray sales.[22] The Warner Bros. Home Entertainment 
Group works across platforms and outlets in the digital realm with video-on-demand, 
branded channels, original content, anti-piracy technology and broadband 
& wireless destinations. Each year Warner Bros. Pictures produces between 
18 and 22 films. Warner Bros. has produced more than 50 television series 
in the 2012–2013 television season. Warner Bros. has also incorporated 
DC Comics content into Warner Bros. Entertainment via the creation of the 
DC Entertainment division, which was founded in 2009. DC Entertainment, 
which is wholly owned by the Company, is responsible for bringing the stories 
and characters from the DC Comics, Vertigo and MAD Magazine publishing 
portfolios into other Warner Bros. content and distribution businesses, 
including feature films, television programming, videogames, direct-to-consumer 
platforms and consumer products. The DC Comics imprint, home to such iconic 
characters as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash and Green Lantern, 
has launched digital versions of its top comic book and graphic novel titles, 
making them available for download on digital platforms.[23] Time magazine 
made its debut in 1923 as the first weekly news magazine in the United 
States.[24] Four years later, in 1927, Warner Bros. released the world’s 
first feature-length talking picture, The Jazz Singer.[25] In 1963, recommendations 
from Time Inc. based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction 
of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office.[citation needed] In 1972, 
Kinney National Company spun off its non-entertainment assets due to a 
financial scandal over its parking operations and renamed itself Warner 
Communications Inc.[26] It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures 
and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics 
and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an 
investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements 
under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts 
led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State 
board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later 
completed in 1980. In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network 
to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and 
Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match.[27] In 1975, Warner expanded 
under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American 
Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels 
including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie 
Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold 
the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks.[citation 
needed] In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the "superstation" concept, 
transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the 
basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979. In 1976, Nolan 
Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 
million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, 
which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved 
its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At 
its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was 
the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the 
time.[28] In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. 
The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 
to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, 
Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The 
Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API.[29][30] In 1980, Turner 
launched CNN, the first 24-hour all-news network, redefining the way the 
world received breaking news.[31] In January 1983, Warner expanded their 
interests to baseball. Under the direction of Caesar P. Kimmel, executive 
vice president, bought 48 percent of the Pittsburgh Pirates for $10 million.[32] 
The company then put up its share for sale in November 1984 following losses 
of $6 million due to its failed attempt to launch a cable sports package. 
The team's majority owner, John W. Galbreath, soon followed suit after 
learning of Warner's actions.[33] Both Galbreath and Warner sold the Pirates 
to local investors in March 1986. In 1984, due to major losses spurred 
by subsidiary Atari Inc.'s losses, Warner sold Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division 
assets to Jack Tramiel. It kept the rest of the company and named it Atari 
Games, eventually reducing it to just the Coin Division. They sold Atari 
Games to Namco in 1985, and repurchased it in 1992, renaming it Time-Warner 
Interactive, until it was sold to Midway Games in 1996. In a long-expected 
deal, Warner Communications announced on May 11, 1988, they were acquiring 
Lorimar-Telepictures; the acquisition was finalized on January 12, 1989.[34] 
The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 
4, 1989.[35] During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications 
(formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire 
Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and 
Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to 
$14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit 
in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice 
in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and 
the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which 
was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming 
defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave 
gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being 
called "Time Warner". US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form 
what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications 
(also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the 
ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West 
also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling 
that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment 
Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company 
MediaOne, then to AT&T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, 
then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&T Broadband 
division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the 
name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable. Time Warner subsequently 
acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only 
did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television 
industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. 
also regained the rights to their pre-1950[36][37] film library, which 
by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held 
by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution),[38] while 
Turner gained access to WB's post-1950 library, as well as other WB-owned 
properties. Time Warner purchased the Six Flags Theme Parks chain in 1993. 
The company later sold all Six Flags parks and properties to Oklahoma-based 
Premier Parks on April 1, 1998.[39] Dick Parsons, already a director on 
the board since 1991, was hired as Time Warner president in 1995, although 
the division operational heads continued to report directly to Chairman 
and CEO Gerald Levin.[40] In 1991, HBO and Cinemax became the first premium 
pay services to offer multiplexing to cable customers, with companion channels 
supplementing the main networks.[41] In 1993 HBO became the world's first 
digitally transmitted television service.[42] In 1995 CNN introduced CNN.com 
which later became a leading destination for global digital news, both 
online and mobile.[43] In 1996, Warner Bros. spearheaded the introduction 
of the DVD, which rapidly replaced VHS tapes as the standard for home video.[44] 
In 1999, HBO became the first national cable TV network to broadcast a 
high–definition version of its channel.[45] In 2000, AOL purchased Time 
Warner for US$164 billion.[46] The deal, announced on January 10, 2000[47] 
and officially filed on February 11, 2000,[48] employed a merger structure 
in which each original company merged into a newly created entity. The 
Federal Trade Commission cleared the deal on December 14, 2000,[49] and 
gave final approval on January 11, 2001; the company completed the merger 
later that day.[50] The deal was approved on the same day by the Federal 
Communications Commission,[48] and had already been cleared by the European 
Commission on October 11, 2000.[51] Due to the larger market capitalization 
of AOL, their shareholders would own 55% of the new company while Time 
Warner shareholders owned only 45%,[47] so in actual practice AOL had acquired 
Time Warner, even though Time Warner had far more assets and revenues.[citation 
needed] The 2001 AOL merger was 'the biggest mistake in corporate history', 
believes Time Warner chief Jeff Bewkes.[52] AOL Time Warner, Inc., as the 
company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top 
executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as CEO of Time 
Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman 
of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) 
and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating 
Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial 
Officer.[53] According to AOL President and COO Bob Pittman, the slow-moving 
Time Warner would now take off at Internet speed, accelerated by AOL: "All 
you need to do is put a catalyst to [Time Warner], and in a short period, 
you can alter the growth rate. The growth rate will be like an Internet 
company." When the AOL Time Warner deal was announced, the vision for its 
future seemed clear and straightforward; by tapping into AOL, Time Warner 
would reach deep into the homes of tens of millions of new customers. AOL 
would use Time Warner's high-speed cable lines to deliver to its subscribers 
Time Warner's branded magazines, books, music, and movies. This would have 
created 130 million subscription relationships. Unfortunately, the growth 
and profitability of the AOL division stalled due to advertising and subscriber 
slowdowns in part caused by the burst of the dot-com bubble and the economic 
recession after September 2001. The value of the America Online division 
dropped significantly, not unlike the market valuation of similar independent 
internet companies that drastically fell, and forced a goodwill write-off, 
causing AOL Time Warner to report a loss of $99 billion in 2002 — at the 
time, the largest loss ever reported by a company. The total value of AOL 
stock subsequently went from $226 billion to about $20 billion.[54] An 
outburst by Vice Chairman Ted Turner at a board meeting prompted Steve 
Case to contact each of the directors and push for CEO Gerald Levin's ouster. 
Although Case's coup attempt was rebuffed by Parsons and several other 
directors, Levin became frustrated with being unable to "regain the rhythm" 
at the combined company and announced his resignation in the fall of 2001, 
effective in May 2002.[55] Although Co-COO Bob Pittman was the strongest 
supporter of Levin and largely seen as the heir-apparent, Dick Parsons 
was instead chosen as CEO. Time Warner CFO J. Michael Kelly was demoted 
to COO of the AOL division, and replaced as CFO by Wayne Pace. AOL Chairman 
and CEO Barry Schuler was removed from his position and placed in charge 
of a new "content creation division", being replaced on an interim basis 
by Pittman, who was already serving as the sole COO after Parsons' promotion. 
Many expected synergies between AOL and other Time Warner divisions never 
materialized, as most Time Warner divisions were considered independent 
fiefs that rarely cooperated prior to the merger. A new incentive program 
that granted options based on the performance of AOL Time Warner, replacing 
the cash bonuses for the results of their own division, caused resentment 
among Time Warner division heads who blamed the AOL division for failing 
to meet expectations and dragging down the combined company. AOL Time Warner 
COO Pittman, who expected to have the divisions working closely towards 
convergence instead found heavy resistance from many division executives, 
who also criticized Pittman for adhering to optimistic growth targets for 
AOL Time Warner that were never met. Some of the attacks on Pittman were 
reported to come from the print media in the Time, Inc. division under 
Don Logan.[56] Furthermore, CEO Parsons' democratic style prevented Pittman 
from exercising authority over the "old-guard" division heads who resisted 
Pittman's synergy initiatives.[53][57] Pittman announced his resignation 
as AOL Time Warner COO after July 4, 2002, being reportedly burned out 
by the AOL special assignment and almost hospitalized, unhappy about the 
criticism from Time Warner executives, and seeing nowhere to move up in 
firm as Parsons was firmly entrenched as CEO.[57] Pittman's departure was 
seen as a great victory to Time Warner executives who wanted to undo the 
merger. In a sign of AOL's diminishing importance to the media conglomerate, 
Pittman's responsibilities were divided between two Time Warner veterans; 
Jeffrey Bewkes who was CEO of Home Box Office, and Don Logan who had been 
CEO of Time. Logan became chairman of the newly created media and communications 
group, overseeing America Online, Time, Time Warner Cable, the AOL Time 
Warner Book Group and the Interactive Video unit, relegating AOL to being 
just another division in the conglomerate. Bewkes became chairman of the 
entertainment and networks group, comprising HBO, New Line Cinema, The 
WB, Turner Networks, Warner Bros. and Warner Music. Both Logan and Bewkes, 
who had initially opposed the merger, were chosen because they were considered 
the most successful operational executives in the conglomerate and they 
would report to AOL Time Warner CEO Richard Parsons.[56][58] Logan, generally 
admired at Time Warner and reviled by AOL for being a corporate timeserver 
who stressed incremental steady growth and not much of a risk taker, moved 
to purge AOL of several "Pittman panzers".[55] AOL Time Warner Chairman 
Steve Case took on added prominence as the co-head of a new strategy committee 
of the board, making speeches to divisions on synergism and the promise 
of the Internet. However, under pressure from institutional investor vice 
president Gordon Crawford who lined up dissenters, Case announced in January 
2003 that he would not stand for re-election as executive chairman in the 
upcoming annual meeting, making CEO Richard Parsons the chairman-elect. 
That year, the company dropped the "AOL" from its name, and spun off Time-Life's 
ownership under the legal name Direct Holdings Americas, Inc. Case resigned 
from the Time Warner board on October 31, 2005.[55][59] In 2005, Time Warner 
was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second 
inauguration of President George W. Bush.[60][61][62] On December 27, 2007, 
newly installed Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes discussed possible plans 
to spin off Time Warner Cable and sell off AOL and Time Inc. This would 
leave a smaller company made up of Turner Broadcasting, Warner Bros. and 
HBO.[63] On February 28, 2008, co-chairmen and co-CEOs of New Line Cinema 
Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne announced their resignations from the 40-year-old 
movie studio in response to Jeffrey Bewkes's demand for cost-cutting measures 
at the studio, which he intended to dissolve into Warner Bros. On May 28, 
2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL as a separate independent 
company, with the change occurring on December 9, 2009. In 2010, Turner 
Sports, Inc. and the National Collegiate Athletic Association jointly announced 
the formation of NCAA Digital, a 14-year agreement in which Turner will 
manage and operate the NCAA’s digital portfolio and strengthen coverage 
of all 88 NCAA championships. NCAA Digital encompasses NCAA.com and additional 
NCAA digital platforms, including mobile web and applications, as well 
as other connected devices.[64] On August 25, 2010, Time Warner's Latin 
American division bought Chilean nationwide terrestrial television station 
Chilevisión from Chile's elected president Sebastián Piñera. Time Warner 
already operates in the country with CNN Chile.[65] In January 2012, Home 
Box Office and DISH Network LLC reached an agreement that will give DISH 
customers expanded access to HBO’s acclaimed programming. In October 2012, 
Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Paramount Home Media Distribution reached 
an agreement that will give Warner Bros. rights to Blu-ray and DVD distribution 
of several titles from Paramount in the US and Canada.[66] In June 2014, 
21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and 
cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned 
down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust 
issues of the purchase.[67] On August 5, 2014, 21st Century Fox withdrew 
its offer to purchase Time Warner. In January 2014, Time Warner, Related 
Companies, and Oxford Properties Group announced that Time Warner intends 
to relocate the Company’s corporate headquarters and its New York City-based 
employees to 30 Hudson Yards in the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Chelsea, 
Manhattan, and has accordingly made an initial financial commitment.[68] 
Time Warner sold its stake in the Columbus Circle building for $1.3 billion 
to Related and two wealth funds. The move will be completed in 2018.[69] 
On December 15, 2006, Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. announced an investment 
in SCi Entertainment Group plc[70] the parent company of publishing label 
Eidos Interactive Ltd, representing 10.3 percent of the company's enlarged 
share capital. Additionally, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group and 
SCi have entered into an agreement for licensing and distribution of games 
based on select Warner Bros. Entertainment properties. The investment, 
licensing and distribution agreements are all pending SCi shareholder approval. 
On October 5, 2007, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. completed the acquisition 
of Claxson Interactive Pay Television Networks in Latin America.[71][unreliable 
source?] On November 8, 2007, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced 
it has entered into an agreement to acquire TT Games, which encompasses 
game developers Traveller's Tales and TT Games Publishing.[72][73] On February 
4, 2009, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced their acquisition 
of Snowblind Studios,[74] a game development studio. On May 21, 2008, Time 
Warner and Time Warner Cable Inc. agree to separation. It is the second 
largest cable company in the U.S. behind only Comcast,[4][5] [75] On February 
19, 2009, Time Warner and Time Warner Cable completed the separation of 
the two companies through a spin-off.[76][77] On March 17, 2009, Time Warner 
Inc. announced the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable 
Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that had become 
effective on March 12, 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, Home Box Office 
purchased additional interests in HBO LAG for $217 million, which resulted 
in Home Box Office owning 80% of the equity interests of HBO LAG.In 2010, 
Home Box Office purchased the remainder of its partners’ interests in HBO 
Europe[78] (formerly HBO Central Europe) for $136 million, net of cash 
acquired. On April 20, 2010, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced 
the acquisition of Turbine, Inc.,[79] a gaming studio in North America. 
In August 2010, Time Warner agreed to acquire Shed Media, a TV production 
company, for £100m. On October 14, 2010, Warner Bros. Television Group 
announced that it completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Shed 
Media, an independent production and distribution company. Shed Media will 
remain an independent production company, but its distribution operation, 
Outright Distribution, will be folded into Warner Bros. International Television 
Production.[80] On August 26, 2010 Time Warner took full control of Chilevisión, 
a TV channel owned by Chile's President Sebastián Piñera.[81] Central European 
Media Enterprises Ltd. (“CME”) is a publicly traded broadcasting company 
operating leading networks in six Central and Eastern European countries. 
On May 18, 2009, the company[clarification needed] completed an equity 
investment in CME for $246 million.[82] In May 2011, Warner Bros. Home 
Entertainment Group announced an agreement to acquire Flixster,[83] a movie 
discovery application company. The acquisition also includes Rotten Tomatoes, 
a movie review aggregator. On September 8, 2011 Turner Broadcasting System 
Europe acquired LazyTown Entertainment.[84] In June 2012, Time Warner acquired 
Alloy Entertainment, a publisher and television studio whose works are 
aimed at teen girls and young women.[85] On August 6, 2012, Time Warner 
acquired Bleacher Report, a sports news website. The property was placed 
under the control of the Turner Sports division.[86] On March 6, 2013, 
Time Warner announced that it would spin off its publishing division Time 
Inc. as a separate, publicly traded company. The transaction was completed 
on June 6, 2014.[87][88] On October 20, 2016, it was reported that AT&T 
was in talks to acquire Time Warner. The proposed deal would give AT&T 
significant holdings in the media industry; AT&T's competitor Comcast had 
previously acquired NBC Universal in a similar bid to increase its media 
holdings, in concert with its ownership of television and internet providers.[89][90][11] 
On October 22, 2016, AT&T reached a deal to buy Time Warner for over $80 
billion. If approved by federal regulators, the merger would bring Time 
Warner's properties under the same umbrella as AT&T's telecommunication 
holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV.[91][92] On January 24, 
2006, CBS Corporation and Time Warner announced that they were to create 
a new broadcast network, The CW. The network officially debuted on September 
18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2-hour 
premiere of America's Next Top Model. The network is the result of a merger 
of The WB (a Time Warner holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). 
CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting 
(previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation contributed 
its stations as new network affiliates, although Time Warner's sole owned 
TV station (via Turner) Atlanta's WTBS (now WPCH and operated by Meredith 
Corporation though a local marketing agreement) remains an independent 
station, competing against CBS-owned CW O&O WUPA. On October 23, 2002, 
AOL Time Warner Inc., posted a third quarter profit, but said it would 
restate two years of results - cutting $190 million in revenues - due to 
accounting problems at its embattled America Online division.[93] On July 
23, 2003, the company would have to restate an additional $400 million 
in advertising revenue as a result of an SEC inquiry.[94] On November 3, 
2004, Time Warner Inc. would restate earnings from 2000 and 2001 to include 
losses from AOL Europe and set aside $500 million to cover costs related 
to federal investigations into accounting at its America Online unit.[95] 
On February 2, 2011, Time Warner reported a 2010 revenue of $26.9 billion, 
highest growth rate since 2004 and a 6% rise since 2009.[96] On February 
8, 2012 Time Warner reported revenue of $29.0 billion, highest growth rate 
since 2003.[97] On February 6, 2013, Time Warner reported revenue for 2012 
of $28.7B and an adjusted operating income of $6.1B.[98] Time Warner owns 
several large properties in New York City; certain buildings in the Rockefeller 
Center complex and adjacent office towers house its main offices; one of 
which houses a CNN news studio. In late 2003, Time Warner finished construction 
of a new twin-tower complex, designed to serve as additional office space, 
facing Columbus Circle on the southwestern edge of Central Park. Originally 
called the AOL Time Warner Center, the 755-foot (230 m), 55-floor mixed-use 
property was renamed Time Warner Center when the company itself was renamed.[99]

Pensions and Benefits Time Warner faces industry competition from traditional 
media companies such as Sony, CBS Corporation, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, 
The Walt Disney Company, and Comcast. Time Warner's and many of their competitions' 
business may be severely impacted by the increasing viewership of feature 
films, television programming and other content online with low ad-income, 
which decreases company revenues. Box office receipts have been rising 
while the growth rate of DVD sales have recently been declining, which 
affects Warner Bros.' growth prospects and revenues.[109] In March 2002, 
the company restated its financial statements to reflect the merger of 
MapQuest and other companies.[110] ^Note 1 Owned by the NBA, operated by
