Home Away Spartakos Glyfadas is a baseball team based in Glyfada, Greece. 
Spartakos is the most successful Greek baseball team having won 6 Greek 
Baseball league championships and 3 Greek Baseball Cups. The team plays 
in the Greek Baseball league where they are the current champions. Spartakos 
participated in the first Greek Baseball league championship in 2000 and 
they finished in second place behind Marousi 2004. The same year they won 
the inaugural Greek Baseball Cup after beating A.O. Pelopas Patron in the 
final 23-13.Next year Spartakos, which had a frustrating year, struggled 
in the Greek league managing to finish in the fourth place in a year that 
saw them failing also to defend the Greek cup after being eliminated to 
the semifinals.In 2002 they were improved in the Greek league but they 
still could not beat Marousi 2004 for the title finishing in second place, 
although they manage to beat their archrivals in the Greek Baseball Cup 
final 13-3 winning their second cup. After a 2003 year that saw Spartakos 
finish again in second place behind Marousi, Manager Tom Mazarakis shook 
things up by landing in some new players from the other Greek teams and 
with the experience that the team had earned from the first 4 seasons they 
managed to win their first double (and becoming the only Greek baseball 
club to win a double) after winning the Greek Championship series 3-1 against 
Ainos Kefallinias (with the last game of the series being a 9-8 thriller 
win) and after reclaiming the Greek cup demolishing Aris Thessaloniki in 
the final 23-3. The 2005 and 2006 seasons saw Spartakos successfully defending 
the Greek Championship by beating Aris Baseball and Mylon Neas Smyrnis 
in the finals respectively.The 2007 Greek Baseball league was played with 
a different format that had 2 different stages, a regular season and the 
final four group stage.The latter was a group that consisted the top four 
teams in the league based on their regular season standings, with single 
games played between the teams.Spartakos easily made it through the final 
four after finishing first in regular season.In the opening day of the 
final four group stage Spartakos easily defeated Eyriali Glyfadas 19-0.The 
second game was against Ainos Kefallinias and Spartakos manage to win after 
a very close contest by 7-5.The last game was against Aris Baseball which 
Spartakos won 4-0 winning the championship for a fourth time.The 2008 Greek 
Baseball league never started because of some financial problems of the 
Hellenic Amateur Baseball Federation. Neverless Spartakos participated 
in the 2008 European Cups qualifier that season.Next year's Greek Championship 
was contested in a regular season only format which meant that the champion 
would be the first team on the league table after the end of the regular 
season. Panthers Patras, a newly created team, and Spartakos were tied 
for first place after the conclusion of the season but Spartakos won the 
championship after having won the games between the two teams in the season. 
What Panthers Patras failed to do at the 2009 season they did at 2010 when 
they upseted the (5 times in a row) defending champions Spartakos to win 
the 2010 Greek title.The two contenders met at Patras on 5/2/2011 with 
4 games remaining and with the two teams being tied at the top of the table. 
Panthers won the game 3-2 although they were trailing 0-2 till late in 
the game.After that heartbreaking loss Spartakos easily won the next game 
against Marousi 2004 15-4, whereas Panthers won their two next games extending 
their table lead by two wins making the next game for Spartakos a must 
win situation.The game was against third placed Eyriali who also had mathematical 
chances to win the title.It was a close encounter and after twelve innings 
Spartakos managed to score the last run and win the match 9-8.The last 
game of the season was against league table leaders Panthers and Spartakos 
needed to win by two runs or a greater margin to finish first and win the 
title.Spartakos took the lead early on in the game 5-2 and looked the favorite 
to win the game and the title.That was until the top of the seventh inning 
which saw Panthers score 6 runs and taking the lead 5-8 which remained 
till the end of the game giving Panthers their first title. Next season 
which had the old format of semifinals and finals (all contested in series 
) return, found Spartakos struggling to fourth place with two games remaining 
after losses to Aris Baseball, Marousi 2004 and Eyriali which hurt the 
chances of Spartakos for first place in the regular season.At the final 
day against third placed Eyriali, Spartakos managed to win 17-12 and took 
the third place at the conclusion of the regular season.Spartakos then 
procceded to the finals against Marousi 2004 after beating Aris 3-0 in 
the semi-finals.The finals began with Marousi 2004 winning the first game 
of the series, then Spartakos won games two and three.Although Spartakos 
looked ready to win the series and reclaim the title they lost both of 
the remaining games and finished as runner-ups to the 2011 championship. 
During the 2012 pre-season Manager Tom Mazarakis brought into Spartakos 
some of the best players of the Greek league making Spartakos the favorite 
to win the championship.The first game of the season wasn't that easy for 
Spartakos though as underdogs Mylon Neas Smyrnis took an early lead of 
1-6 until the fifth inning which saw Spartakos bounce back and 17-6 with 
a mercy rule.The second game of the season ended in a similar fashion as 
Spartakos defeated Olympiada Peristeriou 18-3.Next game for Spartakos was 
against their arch-rivals Marousi 2004.The game was a close encounter with 
Spartakos winning 12-8 after tenth inning.Spartakos suffered their only 
loss of the regular season 17-5 against Marousi and finished first at the 
conclusion of the regular season with 11-1 record.Spartakos then won the 
semi finals' series 3-0 against Eyriali to move to the finals.There they 
played against the defending champions Marousi 2004.The first game of the 
series finished with the mercy rule being applied as Marousi 2004 dominated 
the game winning 16-4.At the second game of the series although Spartakos 
took an early 2-0 lead after the completion of the first inning, Marousi 
made some good offence and was ahead 9-4 after the seventh inning.At the 
top of the eighth inning Spartakos managed to score six runs to regain 
the lead and after the ninth inning the teams were tied at 10-10.At the 
top of the tenth inning Spartakos scored one more run but Marousi scored 
two at the bottom of the tenth to win the game 12-11 and take the 2-0 lead 
to this best of five series.After this heartbreaking loss Spartakos had 
to win all the remaining games of the series to avoid a third consecutive 
championship failure.However the momentum that Marousi had continued early 
in the third game as they took an early lead 3-0.With the danger of losing 
the title for another year Spartakos played one of their best games of 
the season winning by mercy rule 15-5 at 6,5 innings.At the fourth game 
Spartakos was even more impressive beating Marousi 2004 11-0 again by mercy 
rule at seven innings.The last game of the series saw Spartakos taking 
a very confindent 8-0 lead at the bottom of the fourth inning.While tension 
started running high on the Marousi 2004 team they tried to make a late 
comeback in the top of the ninth inning in which they scored three runs.But 
in the end Spartakos held their lead and won 10-8, making this the biggest 
comeback in Greek baseball series history.Actually Spartakos is one of 
the only two teams in all of Greek sports which have a finals play-off 
format (the other being AEK Athens BC ) which managed to win the Greek 
Championship finals after being down 2-0 in a best-of-five series.The 2013 
season started with Spartakos participating to the Greek Cup tournament 
and after three easy wins against Dias Patron , Aris Baseball and Olympiada 
Peristeriou was eliminated to the semi - finals of the double elimination 
bracket after two consecutive close losses to Leaders Vouliagmenis thus 
failing to defend the Greek Cup trophy successfully. The season opener 
found Spartakos facing Evriali Glyfadas and won fairly easily 13-2 . On 
May 19th Spartakos demolished Aris Baseball with 32-0 after a 5-inning 
mercy rule was applied.This 32 runs difference is a new Greek league record.
