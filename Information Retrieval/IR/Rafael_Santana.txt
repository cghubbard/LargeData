Rafael Francisco Santana de la Cruz (born January 31, 1958) is a former 
Major League Baseball shortstop who won a World Series ring with the 1986 
New York Mets. He currently serves as the Dominican Republic scouting and 
player development supervisor for the Chicago White Sox. Originally signed 
by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1976, Santana spent 
several years in their farm system before being traded to the St. Louis 
Cardinals on February 16, 1981 for a player to be named later. The Cardinals 
sent pitcher George Frazier to the Yankees in June to complete the deal. 
Santana made the Cardinals out of spring training in 1983, making his major 
league debut on April 5 at third base in the season opener against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.[1] In 30 games, Santana had only three hits in fourteen 
at-bats for a .214 batting average to go along with two runs batted in. 
Santana was released by the Cardinals on January 17, 1984, and signed that 
same day with the New York Mets. During the 1984 season, he played 51 games 
for the Mets, hitting a career-best .271 with a home run and 12 RBIs as 
the primary back-up for starting shortstop Jose Oquendo. Oquendo was traded 
with Mark J. Davis to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ángel Salazar and John 
Young during the offseason, making Santana the regular Mets shortstop for 
1985. He responded with a .257 batting average and a .965 fielding percentage 
for the squad that finished with 98 wins, and three games behind the Cards 
in the National League East. During the 1986 regular season, he batted 
just .218 with a home run and 28 RBIs, however, batting eighth in the order, 
he also led the squad with twelve intentional walks (Mets pitchers batted 
only .123 for the season). Santana started all 13 games for the Mets during 
the 1986 post-season, and established an NLCS record for most putouts (13), 
assists (18) and chances accepted (31) by a shortstop in a six-game series 
against the Houston Astros. After the 1987 campaign where he set career-highs 
in home runs (5) and RBIs (44) with the Mets, Santana was traded to the 
cross-town Yankees with Victor Garcia for Steve Frey, Phil Lombardi and 
Darren Reed. He hit .240 with four home runs and 38 RBIs for managers Billy 
Martin and Lou Piniella in 1988. After missing the entire 1989 season with 
an elbow injury, Santana was released on November 7 of that year. In January 
1990, Santana signed with the Cleveland Indians, where he played 7 games 
and was reunited with 1986 Mets teammates Keith Hernandez, Jesse Orosco, 
and Stan Jefferson. After being released on April 25 of that year, he retired 
from the big leagues at the age of 32. After his playing career, Santana 
made a seamless foray into coaching. He started by managing Azucareros 
del Este of the Dominican Winter League from 1992 through 1993. His first 
coaching job in the United States was also in 1992, with the Kansas City 
Royals' Florida State League affiliate, the Baseball City Royals (located 
in Davenport, Florida). He spent four seasons in the Royals' organization, 
also coaching with the Carolina League's Wilmington Blue Rocks, the Northwest 
League's Eugene Emeralds and the Midwest League's Springfield Sultans. 
After this, Santana worked three seasons in the Boston Red Sox organization, 
overseeing the Red Sox Dominican program in 1996 and as a roving infield 
instructor and hitting coach with the Class A New York–Penn League Lowell 
Spinners in 1997 and 1998 before moving on to the White Sox. He spent four 
seasons as the ChiSox's minor league infield instructor before being promoted 
to the major league club in the same capacity while also serving as their 
first base coach for 2003 and 2004.[2] Santana returned to his previous 
position as roving infield instructor in 2005. On January 1, 2006, Rafael 
Santana was named manager of the Winston-Salem Warthogs, his first managerial 
job in the United States.[3] The following season, Santana took over the 
Birmingham Barons from Chris Cron. He currently serves as the Dominican 
Republic scouting and player development supervisor for the White Sox. 
He is a member of the Mets Alumni Association and along with past Mets 
players, still makes personal appearances on behalf of the team. On August 
19, 2006, Santana attended a 20th Anniversary Reunion of the 1986 Mets 
World Series Championship Team at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York, which 
took place prior to that night's game between the Mets and the Colorado 
Rockies.[4] Santana and his wife, Gloria, live in Cape Coral, Florida, 
and have three children: Audry, Alexander, and Dhayan. Alexander is a third 
baseman who attended Mariner High School in the Cape[5] and was drafted
