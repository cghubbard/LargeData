Anaheim (pronounced /ˈænəhaɪm/) is a city in Orange County, California, 
part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. As of the 2010 United States 
Census, the city had a population of 336,265, making it the most populous 
city in Orange County and the 10th most populous city in California.[14] 
Anaheim is the second largest city in Orange County in terms of land area 
(after Irvine) and is known for its theme parks, sports teams, and convention 
center. Anaheim was founded by fifty German families in 1857 and incorporated 
as the second city in Los Angeles County on March 18, 1876.[2] The city 
developed into an industrial center, producing electronics, aircraft parts 
and canned fruit. It is the site of the Disneyland Resort, a world-famous 
grouping of theme parks and hotels which opened in 1955, Angel Stadium 
of Anaheim, Honda Center and the Anaheim Convention Center. Anaheim's city 
limits extend from Cypress in the west to the Riverside County line in 
the east and encompass a diverse collection of neighborhoods and communities. 
Anaheim Hills is a master-planned community located in the city's eastern 
stretches that is home to many of the city's affluent.[citation needed] 
Downtown Anaheim has three mixed-use historic districts, the largest of 
which is the Anaheim Colony. The Anaheim Resort, a commercial district, 
includes Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, and numerous hotels and 
retail complexes. The Platinum Triangle, a neo-urban redevelopment district 
surrounding Angel Stadium, is planned to be populated with mixed-use streets 
and high-rises. Finally, Anaheim Canyon is an industrial district north 
of SR 91 and east of SR 57. Anaheim's name is a blend of "Ana", after the 
nearby Santa Ana River, and heim, a common Germanic place name compound 
originally meaning "home".[15] The city of Anaheim was founded in 1857 
by 50 German-Americans who were residents of San Francisco[16] and whose 
families had originated in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Franconia in Bavaria.[citation 
needed] After traveling through the state looking for a suitable area to 
grow grapes, the group decided to purchase a 1,165 acres (4.71 km2) parcel 
from Juan Pacifico Ontiveros' large Rancho San Juan Cajon de Santa Ana 
in present-day Orange County for $2 per acre.[16] For $750 a share, the 
group formed the Anaheim Vineyard Company.[16] Their new community was 
named Annaheim, meaning "home by the Santa Anna River" in German.[16] The 
name later was altered to Anaheim. To the Spanish-speaking neighbors, the 
settlement was known as Campo Alemán (English: German Field). Although 
grape and wine-making was their primary objective, the majority of the 
50 settlers were mechanics, carpenters and craftsmen with no experience 
in wine-making.[16] The community set aside 40 acres (16 ha) for a town 
center and a school was the first building erected there.[16] The first 
home was built in 1857, the Anaheim Gazette newspaper was established in 
1870 and a hotel in 1871. For 25 years, the area was the largest wine producer 
in California.[16] However, in 1884, a disease infected the grape vines 
and by the following year the entire industry was destroyed. Other crops – 
walnuts, lemons and oranges – soon filled the void. Fruits and vegetables 
had become viable cash crops when the Los Angeles – Orange County region 
was connected to the continental railroad network in 1887. The famous Polish 
actress Helena Modjeska settled in Anaheim with her husband and various 
friends, among them Henryk Sienkiewicz, Julian Sypniewski and Łucjan Paprocki. 
While living in Anaheim, Helena Modjeska became good friends with Clementine 
Langenberger, the second wife of August Langenberger.[17] Helena Street[18] 
and Clementine Street[18] are named after these two ladies, and the streets 
are located adjacent to each other as a symbol of the strong friendship 
which Helena Modjeska and Clementine Lagenberger shared. Modjeska Park[19] 
in West Anaheim, is also named after Helena Modjeska. During the first 
half of the 20th century, before Disneyland opened its doors to the public, 
Anaheim was a massive rural community inhabited by orange groves and the 
landowners who farmed them. One of the landowners was Bennett Payne Baxter, 
who owned much land in northeast Anaheim that today is the location of 
Angel Stadium.[20] He came up with many new ideas for irrigating orange 
groves and shared his ideas with other landowners. He was not only successful, 
he helped other landowners and businesspeople succeed as well. Ben Baxter 
and other landowners helped to make Anaheim a thriving rural community 
before Disneyland changed the city forever. Today, a street runs along 
Edison Park[20] which is named Baxter Street. Also during this time, Rudolph 
Boysen served as Anaheim's first Park Superintendent from 1921 to 1950. 
Boysen created a hybrid berry which Walter Knott later named the boysenberry, 
after Rudy Boysen. Boysen Park[21] in East Anaheim was also named after 
him. In 1924, Ku Klux Klan members were elected to the Anaheim City Council 
on a platform of political reform. Up until that point, the city had been 
controlled by a long-standing business and civic elite that was mostly 
German American. Given their tradition of moderate social drinking, the 
German Americans did not strongly support prohibition laws of the day. 
The mayor himself was a former saloon keeper. Led by the minister of the 
First Christian Church, the Klan represented a rising group of politically 
oriented non-ethnic Germans who denounced the elite as corrupt, undemocratic, 
and self-serving. The Klansmen aimed to create what they saw as a model, 
orderly community, one in which prohibition against alcohol would be strictly 
enforced. At the time, the KKK had about 1200 members in Orange County. 
The economic and occupational profile of the pro and anti-Klan groups shows 
the two were similar and about equally prosperous. Klan members were Protestants, 
as were the majority of their opponents, however the opposition to the 
Klan also included many Catholic Germans. Individuals who joined the Klan 
had earlier demonstrated a much higher rate of voting and civic activism 
than did their opponents, and many of the individuals in Orange County 
who joined the Klan did so out of a sense of civic activism. Upon easily 
winning the local Anaheim election in April 1924, the Klan representatives 
promptly fired city employees who were known to be Catholic and replaced 
them with Klan appointees. The new city council tried to enforce prohibition. 
After its victory, the Klan chapter held large rallies and initiation ceremonies 
over the summer.[22] The opposition to KKK's hold on Anaheim politics organized, 
bribed a Klansman for their secret membership list, and exposed the Klansmen 
running in the state primaries; they defeated most of the candidates. Klan 
opponents in 1925 took back local government, and succeeded in a special 
election in recalling the Klansmen who had been elected in April 1924. 
The Klan in Anaheim quickly collapsed, its newspaper closed after losing 
a libel suit, and the minister who led the local Klavern moved to Kansas.[22] 
Construction of the Disneyland theme park began on July 16, 1954, and it 
opened to the public on July 17, 1955. It has become one of the world's 
most visited tourist attractions, with over 650 million visitors since 
its opening. The location was formerly 160 acres (0.65 km2) of orange and 
walnut trees, some of which remain on the property. Hotels and motels began 
to spread and residential districts soon followed, with increasing property 
values. In 2001, Disney's California Adventure (renamed Disney California 
Adventure Park in 2010) the most expansive project in the theme park's 
history, opened to the public.[citation needed] In 1970, the Census Bureau 
reported Anaheim's population as 9.3% Hispanic and 89.2% non-Hispanic white.[23] 
In the late 20th century, Anaheim grew rapidly in population. Today, Anaheim 
has a diverse ethnic and racial composition.[23] During the large expansion 
of the Disneyland resort in the 1990s, the city of Anaheim recognized the 
Anaheim Resort area as a tourist destination. It includes the Disneyland 
Resort, the Anaheim Convention Center, the Honda Center, and Angel Stadium. 
In 2007, the city celebrated its sesquicentennial. In July 2012, political 
protests by Hispanic residents occurred following the fatal shooting of 
two men, the first of whom was unarmed. Protesting occurred in the area 
between State College and East Street, and was motivated by concerns over 
police brutality, gang activity, domination of the city by commercial interests, 
and a perceived lack of political representation of Hispanic residents 
in the city government.[24][25][26] The protests were accompanied by looting 
of businesses and homes.[27][28] Anaheim is located at 33°50′10″N 117°53′23″W﻿ 
/ ﻿33.836165°N 117.889769°W﻿ / 33.836165; -117.889769.[29] and is approximately 
25 miles (40 km) south east of Downtown Los Angeles. The city roughly follows 
the east-to-west route of the 91 Freeway from the Orange-Riverside county 
border to Buena Park. To the north, Anaheim is bounded by (from east to 
west) Yorba Linda, Placentia, Fullerton, and Buena Park. The city shares 
its western border with Buena Park and Cypress. Anaheim is bordered on 
the south by (from west to east) Stanton, Garden Grove, and Orange. Various 
unincorporated areas of Orange County also abut the city, including Anaheim 
Island.[30] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has 
a total area of 50.8 square miles (132 km2). 49.8 square miles (129 km2) 
of it is land and 1.0 square mile (2.6 km2) of it (1.92%) is water. The 
city recognizes several districts, including the Anaheim Resort (the area 
surrounding Disneyland), Anaheim Canyon (an industrial area north of the 
Riverside Freeway and east of the Orange Freeway), and the Platinum Triangle 
(the area surrounding Angel Stadium). Anaheim Hills also maintains a distinct 
identity. Downtown Anaheim is located in the heart of the Colony Historic 
District. Downtown is the administrative heart of the city where you find 
City Hall, Anaheim West Tower, Anaheim Police Headquarters, the Anaheim 
Chamber of Commerce and the Main Library. Anaheim Ice (formerly Disney 
Ice), the Downtown Anaheim Farmer's Market, a food hall in a historic 1919 
Sunkist packing house, and the Center Street Promenade are also located 
in Downtown Anaheim. In late 2007, The Muzeo,[31] the newest major museum 
in Orange County, opened its doors for the first time and is located next 
to Anaheim West Tower. Pearson Park[32] is also located in Downtown Anaheim, 
and is named after Charles Pearson,[18] who was Mayor of Anaheim during 
the time Walt Disney opened Disneyland in Anaheim. One of the major attractions 
located in Pearson Park is the Pearson Park Amphitheater.[33] In the Colony 
Historic District just west of Downtown Anaheim is the Mother Colony House,[34] 
which was built by George Hanson and was the first house built in Anaheim,[35] 
the founder of Anaheim. Today, it is Anaheim's and Orange County's oldest 
museum still open to the public. The Woelke-Stoeffel House[36] is a Victorian 
mansion located next door to the Mother Colony House. Originally the Victorian 
Home was occupied by the Stoeffel family,[37] early pioneer residents of 
Anaheim. The home served as headquarters for the local Red Cross until 
the early 1990s. In 2010–2011, the Woelke-Stoeffel house became refurnished 
and is now part of the Founder's Park complex. Founder's Park includes 
the Mother Colony house and a carriage house, which serves as a museum 
of Anaheim's agricultural history. These three buildings are open every 
first Saturday from 9 to 12 pm. Like many other South Coast cities, Anaheim 
maintains a Mediterranean climate, enjoying warm winters and hot summers.[38] 
The 2010 United States Census[44] reported that Anaheim had a population

In addition to The Walt Disney Company being the city's largest employer, 
the Disneyland Resort itself contributes about $4.7 billion annually to 
Southern California's economy. It also produces $255 million in taxes every 
year.[48] Another source of tourism is the Anaheim Convention Center, which 
is home to many important national conferences. Many hotels, especially 
in the city's Resort district, serve theme park tourists and conventiongoers. 
The Anaheim Canyon business park makes up 63% of Anaheim's industrial space 
and is the largest industrial district in Orange County. Anaheim Canyon 
is also home to the second largest business park in Orange County.[49][50] 
Anaheim Canyon houses 2,600 businesses, which employ over 55,000 workers.[citation 
needed] Several notable companies have corporate offices and/or headquarters 
within Anaheim. According to the City's 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial 
Report,[59] the top employers in the city are: Larger retail centers include 
the Downtown Disney shopping area at the Disneyland Resort, the power centers 
Anaheim Plaza in western Anaheim (347,000 ft2),[60] and Anaheim Town Square 
in East Anaheim (374,000 ft2),[61] as well as the Anaheim GardenWalk lifestyle 
center (440,000 ft2 of retail, dining and entertainment located in the 
Anaheim Resort). On January 3, 2005, Angels Baseball LP, the ownership 
group for the Anaheim Angels, announced that it would change the name of 
the club to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Arturo Moreno believed Team 
spokesmen pointed out that from its inception, the Angels had been granted 
territorial rights by Major League Baseball to the counties of Los Angeles, 
Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino in addition to Orange County. The 
new owner knew the name would help him market the team to the entire Southern 
California region rather than just Orange County. The "of Anaheim" was 
included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's 
lease at Angel Stadium which requires that "Anaheim" be included in the 
team's name. Mayor Curt Pringle and other city officials countered that 
the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it were 
in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining 
chip in negotiations between the city and Disney Baseball Enterprises, 
Inc., then the ownership group for the Angels. They further argued that 
the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, 
because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's 
renovation but provided very little revenue for the city. Anaheim sued 
Angels Baseball LP in Orange County Superior Court, and a jury trial was 
completed in early February 2006, resulting in a victory for the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim franchise. Anaheim appealed the court decision with the 
California Court of Appeal in May 2006. The case was tied up in the Appeals 
Court for over two years. In December 2008, the Appeals Court upheld the 
February 2006 Decision and ruled in favor of The Angels Organization. In 
January 2009, the Anaheim City Council voted not to appeal the court case 
any further, bringing an end to the four-year legal dispute between the 
City of Anaheim and the Angels Organization. Under its city charter, Anaheim 
operates under a council-manager government. Legislative authority is vested 
in a city council of five nonpartisan members, who hire a professional 
city manager to oversee day-to-day operations. The mayor serves as the 
presiding officer of the city council in a first among equals role. Under 
the city's term limits, an individual may serve a maximum of two terms 
as a city council member and two terms as the mayor. Up until 2014, all 
council seats were elected at large. Voters elected the mayor and four 
other members of the city council to serve four-year staggered terms. Elections 
for two council seats were held in years divisible by four while elections 
for the mayor and the two other council seats were elected during the intervening 
even-numbered years. In response to protests and a California Voting Rights 
Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union and several residents, 
the city placed two measures on the November 2014 ballot. Measure L proposed 
that council members be elected by district instead of at large. Measure 
M proposed to increase the number of council seats from five to seven. 
Both measures passed.[64] The current city council:[65] In the United States 
House of Representatives, Anaheim is split among three Congressional districts:[7] 
In the California State Senate, Anaheim is split among three districts:[8] 
In the California State Assembly, Anaheim is split among three districts:[9] 
On the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Anaheim is divided between two 
districts, with Anaheim Hills lying in the 3rd District and the remainder 
of Anaheim lying in the 4th District: Fire protection is provided by the 
Anaheim Fire Department, Disneyland Resort has its own Fire Department, 
though it does rely on the Anaheim Fire Department for support, and for 
Paramedic Services. Law enforcement is provided by the Anaheim Police Department. 
Ambulance service is provided by Care Ambulance Service. Anaheim Public 
Utilities is the only municipal owned water and electric utility in Orange 
County, providing residential and business customers with water and electric 
services. The utility is regulated and governed locally by the City Council. 
A Public Utilities Board, made up of Anaheim residents, advises the City 
Council on major utility issues.[66] Anaheim has decided to bury power 
lines along major transportation corridors, converting its electricity 
system for aesthetic and reliability reasons.[67] To minimize the impact 
on customer bills, undergrounding is taking place slowly over a period 
of 50 years, funded by a 4% surcharge on electric bills.[68] In 2003, Anaheim 
reported nine murders; given its population, this rate was one-third of 
the national average. Reported rapes the city are relatively uncommon as 
well, but have been increasing, along with the national average. Robbery 
(410 reported incidents) and aggravated assault (824 incidents) rank among 
the most frequent violent crimes in the city, though robbery rates are 
half of the national average, and aggravated assaults are 68% of the average. 
1,971 burglaries were reported, as well as 6,708 thefts, 1,767 car thefts, 
and 654 car accidents. All three types of crime were below average. There 
were 43 cases of arson reported in 2003, 43% of the national average.[69] 
Anaheim is served by seven public school districts:[70] Anaheim is home 
to 84 public schools,[62] of which 46 serve elementary students, nine are 
junior high schools, fourteen are high schools and six offer alternative 
education. Private schools in the city include Acaciawood Preparatory Academy, 
Cornelia Connelly High School, Fairmont Preparatory Academy and Servite 
High School. Anaheim has three private universities: Anaheim University 
and Southern California Institute of Technology (SCIT), and Bristol University 
(BU) with its sport teams Bristol Bears. North Orange County Community 
College District serves the community. Anaheim has eight public library 
branches. In the western portion of the city (not including Anaheim Hills), 
the major surface streets run east to west, starting with the northernmost, 
Orangethorpe Avenue, La Palma Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, Ball Road and Katella 
Avenue. The major surface streets running north-south, starting with the 
westernmost, are Knott Avenue, Beach Boulevard (SR 39), Magnolia Avenue, 
Brookhurst Street, Euclid Street, Harbor Boulevard, Anaheim Boulevard and 
State College Boulevard. The Santa Ana Freeway (I-5), the Orange Freeway 
(SR 57) and the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) all pass through Anaheim. The 
Costa Mesa Freeway (SR 55), and the Eastern Transportation Corridor (SR 
241) also have short stretches within the city limits. Anaheim is served 
by two major railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway. 
In addition, the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center (ARTIC), 
a major regional transit station near Honda Center and Angel Stadium, serves 
Amtrak, Metrolink, and several bus operators, and the Anaheim Canyon Metrolink 
station serves Metrolink's IEOC Line. ARTIC is a proposed stop on the proposed 
California High-Speed Rail network and the proposed Anaheim Rapid Connection.[71][72] 
The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) provides bus service 
for Anaheim with local and county-wide routes, and both OCTA and Los Angeles 
County Metro operate bus routes connecting Anaheim to Los Angeles County. 
Also, Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) provides local shuttle service in and 
around the Anaheim Resort area, serving local hotels, tourist attractions, 
and the Disneyland Resort. Disney GOALS operates daily free bus service 
for low-income youth in the central Anaheim area.[citation needed] Anaheim 
is equidistant from both John Wayne Airport and Long Beach Airport (15 
miles), but is also accessible from nearby Los Angeles International (30
