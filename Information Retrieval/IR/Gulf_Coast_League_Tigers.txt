The Gulf Coast League Tigers or GCL Tigers are a minor league baseball 
club located in Lakeland, Florida, at Joker Marchant Stadium. A member 
of the rookie-level Gulf Coast League, the Tigers an affiliate of the Detroit 
Tigers. The team is composed mainly of players who are in their first year 
of professional baseball either as draftees or non-drafted free agents 
from the United States, Canada, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and various 
other countries. For the 2016 season, the Tigers fielded two teams in the 
Gulf Coast League, designated "East" and "West." The second team was created 
due to the cancellation of the Venezuelan Summer League, which left the 
Tigers with a roster full of players with no team. Most of these players 
were assigned to one of the two GCL teams, although some were assigned 
to the Tigers affiliate in the Dominican Summer League. Pitchers Catchers
