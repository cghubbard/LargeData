The Incorporated Village of Farmingdale is an incorporated village on Long 
Island within the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, New York in the 
United States. The population was 8,189 at the 2010 Census. As of 2012[update] 
the mayor is Ralph Ekstrand.[1] Farmingdale is also associated with several 
unincorporated areas outside the village limits, including South Farmingdale 
(also in the Town of Oyster Bay within Nassau County), and East Farmingdale 
(in the Town of Babylon within Suffolk County). Many nearby places not 
within the village limits have Farmingdale as their postal address and 
the same 11735 ZIP code. Residents of East Farmingdale must use Farmingdale 
as their mailing address, and residents of South Farmingdale can use either 
Farmingdale or South Farmingdale. Bethpage State Park, which is mostly 
in Old Bethpage, also has a Farmingdale mailing address. Farmingdale Union 
Free School District (UFSD 22) includes parts of both Nassau County and 
Suffolk County. A road sign on Main Street in the south-east section of 
South Farmingdale (and over a mile from the Village of Farmingdale) welcomes 
travelers to Farmingdale. Farmingdale is also the name of the local Farmingdale 
Water District and Farmingdale Fire District, both of which also include 
areas outside the boundaries of the Village of Farmingdale. Farmingdale 
State College and Republic Airport are in East Farmingdale, both with Farmingdale 
mailing addresses. The first European settler in the area was Thomas Powell, 
who arrived in 1687. On October 18, 1695, he purchased a 15-square-mile 
(39 km2) tract of land from three Native American tribes. This is known 
as the Bethpage Purchase and includes what is now Farmingdale, as well 
as Bethpage, Melville, North Massapequa, Old Bethpage, Plainedge, and Plainview. 
One of two houses he built in the area (circa 1738) still stands on Merritts 
Road in Farmingdale. In the 1830s, anticipating construction of the Long 
Island Rail Road (LIRR), land developer Ambrose George purchased a large 
tract of land between a community then known as Bethpage and an area in 
Suffolk County called Hardscrabble.[2][3] He built a general store in the 
western part of this property which he named Farmingdale. When the LIRR 
started service to the area in October 1841,[4][5] it used the name Farmingdale 
for its latest stop, here, on the line it was building to Greenport. Stagecoaches 
took people from the Farmingdale station to Islip, Babylon, Patchogue, 
Oyster Bay South, and West Neck (Huntington area).[6] [7] In 1886 a fire 
department was organized. The Village of Farmingdale was incorporated in 
1904. In 1912, the State Agricultural and Technical school was established. 
The Lenox Hills Country Club, an 18-hole private golf course designed by 
Devereaux Emmet, was developed north of the community in 1923. This golf 
course was purchased by the State of New York, expanded and opened as Bethpage 
State Park in 1932. The original 1920s era Lenox Hills subdivision and 
later adjacent subdivisions, located between the Bethpage State Park golf 
course and the Long Island Railroad trackage, encompassing rolling hills 
and a wide boulevard, are known as the more upscale part of Farmingdale 
Village. Later, Farmingdale became a locus for the aircraft industry, notably 
Republic Aviation Company. In 1899, Mile-a-Minute Murphy rode a bicycle 
along the Long Island Rail Road's Central Branch through the Farmingdale 
area at a mile a minute. For many years, the town celebrated its birth 
with the annual Hardscrabble Fair, with music, food and games. It was normally 
held in May. Farmingdale is located at 40°44′0″N 73°26′42″W﻿ / ﻿40.73333°N

to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.1 
square miles (2.8 km2), all of it land. Between the 1990 Census and the 
2000 census, the village gained territory.[9] Farmingdale is served by 
Republic Airport, a major general aviation reliever to the east of New 
York City; NICE routes n70, n71 and n72; and the Long Island Rail Road's 
Farmingdale station. Major roads are New York State routes 24 (Conklin
