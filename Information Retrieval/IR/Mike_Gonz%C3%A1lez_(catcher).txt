As player As manager Miguel Angel González Cordero (September 24, 1890 
– February 19, 1977) was a Cuban catcher, coach and interim manager in 
American Major League Baseball during the first half of the 20th century. 
Along with Adolfo Luque, González was one of the first Cubans or Latin 
Americans to have a long off-field career in the U.S. Major Leagues. Born 
in Havana, González played winter baseball in the Cuban League from 1910 
to 1936 and was a long-time manager. He was elected to the Cuban Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1955.[1] González, a right-handed-hitting catcher, made 
his National League debut with the 1912 Boston Braves, playing only one 
game. During that time he played "Negro baseball" with integrated teams 
from Cuba, the Cuban Stars in 1911, 1912 and 1914; the Long Branch Cubans 
in 1913. During his organized baseball career he appeared with the New 
York Lincoln Giants in 1916 (Riley, 326). González returned to the Major 
Leagues with the Cincinnati Reds sometime in 1914 and went on to play 16 
more seasons (1914–21; 1924–29; 1931–32) with the St. Louis Cardinals (in 
three separate stints), New York Giants and Chicago Cubs, batting .253 
in 1,042 games. He appeared in one World Series – 1929 with the Cubs – 
and was hitless in his only at-bat. In 1933, he became a coach for the 
Cardinals' American Association farm club, the Columbus Red Birds, and 
joined the St. Louis coaching staff in 1934 under manager Frankie Frisch. 
It was the year of the "Gashouse Gang", the hard-playing Cardinal team 
that stormed to the NL pennant and a seven-game Fall Classic triumph over 
the Detroit Tigers. González coached under Frisch until September 14, 1938, 
when Frisch was fired. González then took the helm for the final 16 games 
of the season, leading the Cardinals to an 8–8 record. He resumed his coaching 
role under Ray Blades the following season, but again became the Cards' 
acting pilot on June 7, 1940, handling the team until June 10, when Blades' 
permanent successor, Billy Southworth, arrived from Rochester. Overall, 
González' big-league managing record was nine wins and 13 defeats (.409). 
González continued on the Cardinals' coaching lines through 1946. In the 
bottom of the eighth inning of his final game, the seventh and deciding 
contest of the 1946 World Series, Gonzalez was coaching at third base when 
Enos Slaughter raced home from first base on a double by Harry Walker. 
"Slaughter's Mad Dash" scored the winning run and earned the Cardinals 
the world championship. Although films taken of the play appear to show 
González waving Slaughter in, other accounts report that Slaughter ignored 
the coach's stop sign and took home on his own initiative. González is 
credited with contributing a lasting piece of baseball terminology. Asked 
by the Cardinals to scout a winter league player, González judged that 
the player was outstanding defensively but a liability as a batter. He 
wired back a four-word scouting report: "Good field, no hit." That phrase 
is still in use today. González debuted in 1910 as a shortstop for the 
Fé club. He was a part-time infielder his first three seasons before switching 
to catcher and gaining a full-time roster spot with Habana in the winter 
of 1913. He hit .313 in 1918–1919, .296 in 1927–28, and led the league 
in 1932–33 with an average of .432.[2] In 1914–15 he became Habana's playing 
manager and led the team to a championship. It was the first of 13 championships 
he won at the helm of the team (the others were in 1918–19, 1920–21, 1921–22, 
1926–27, 1927–28, 1928–29, 1940–41, 1943–44, 1947–48, 1950–51, 1951–52, 
and 1952–53). Cuban baseball historian Jorge Figueredo calls his 1927–28 
Habana team, which included Jud Wilson, Martín Dihigo, Chino Smith, Alejandro 
Oms, Ramón Herrera, and Manuel Cueto, "probably the best they ever had 
in their illustrious history."[3] During the 1946 season, the Mexican League, 
then an insurgent circuit outside the control of "organized baseball", 
raided Major League teams — notably the Cardinals, Giants and Brooklyn 
Dodgers — for playing talent, signing Max Lanier, Lou Klein and Fred Martin 
away from the Cardinals alone. Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler 
responded by banning the "jumping" players for five years, and ruling that 
any player who competed with or against the jumpers, and any team that 
employed those banned players, would also lose their professional baseball 
eligibility.[4] However, the 1946–47 Cuban Winter League, including González' 
Habana club, hired some of the banned players in defiance of Chandler's 
edict. González resigned from the champion Cardinals' coaching staff in 
protest, and he was ruled ineligible from working in U.S. professional 
baseball as a result.[4] Chandler's ruling was sharply criticized by the 
Cuban media — while Martin was a star pitcher for Habana in 1946–47. Although 
Cuban winter league and U.S. baseball officials eventually reached a compromise, 
and the jumping players were reinstated in 1949, González never returned 
to the Cardinals or the U.S. Major or minor leagues. González retired as 
Habana's League manager after the 1952–53 season and in retirement remained 
in his native country. After the Cuban Revolution brought Fidel Castro 
to power in 1959, and the ensuing chill in relations between Cuba and the 
U.S., González was cut off from his old friends and associates in American
