Andrew Freedman (September 1, 1860 â€“ December 4, 1915) was an American 
businessman. Freedman was the owner of the New York Giants of the National 
League from 1895 through 1902. Freedman was also director of the Interborough 
Rapid Transit Company and the Wright Company. He died in New York City, 
the place of his birth. Freedman took over the Manhattan Athletic Club, 
which fell into receivership in 1893, as its receiver.[1][2] In 1895, Freedman 
became the principal owner of the New York Giants of the National League 
(NL), purchasing a controlling interest in the club from Cornelius C. Van 
Cott for approximately $53,000 ($1,510,076 in current dollar terms).[3] 
During his ownership of the team, Freedman drew the ire of many of his 
players for various fines and abuses. In one incident, star pitcher Amos 
Rusie sat out the entire 1896 season during a feud with Freedman.[4][5] 
NL presidential candidate Al Spalding called Freedman an "impossibility 
in baseball",[6] demanding that Freedman retire from the game.[7][8] Freedman 
refused.[9] With the financial backing of John T. Brush, principal owner 
of the Cincinnati Reds, Freedman purchased controlling interest in the 
Baltimore Orioles of the rival American League (AL) on July 17, 1902.[10] 
The Orioles were in significant debt, reportedly owing $12,000 ($328,754 
in current dollar terms).[10][11] As a result, part-owner and team president 
John Mahon purchased shares in the team from players John McGraw, Joe Kelley, 
and Wilbert Robinson, becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles.[10] 
Mahon, with the controlling interest in the Orioles, comprising 201 of 
the team's 400 total shares,[12] sold his shares to Freedman.[10] In the 
day Freedman owned the franchise, he released the Orioles' best players 
from their contracts so that they could be signed by their NL teams: Kelley 
and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while Joe McGinnity, John McGraw, 
Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants.[13][14] 
AL president Ban Johnson, along with minority owners of the Orioles, took 
control of the Orioles franchise, which had to forfeit their game that 
day as they did not have enough players.[10][15] Following the 1902 season, 
Freedman sold the Giants to Brush.[16] Freedman owned an ice yacht, named 
"Haze", which won a pennant race in North Shrewsbury, New Jersey.[17] Freedman 
was director of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT).[18] He first 
became involved in IRT when John B. McDonald sought to include Freedman.[19] 
Freedman reported that he invested $1.7 million ($46,573,462 in current 
dollar terms) in the company in 1901 and 1902.[19] Freedman served on the 
board of directors of the Wright Company, established in 1909 to market 
the Wright brothers' airplanes in the United States.[20] When Freedman 
died, his estate was worth over $4 million ($93,723,684 in current dollar 
terms). Samuel Untermyer served as executor of his estate.[18][21] In his 
will, Freedman bequeathed money to build the Andrew Freedman Home at 1125 
Grand Concourse in The Bronx. The home was intended to serve as a retirement 
home.[21] Plans were filed in 1922 to build the home as a four-story brick 
building, with the cost of construction estimated at $500,000 ($7,080,517 
in current dollar terms).[22] The building cost approximately $1 million 
($13,831,068 in current dollar terms) and opened in 1924.[23] The Andrew 
Freedman Home was named a New York City Designated Landmark in 1992.[24]
