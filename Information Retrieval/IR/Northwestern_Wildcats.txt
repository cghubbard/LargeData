The Northwestern Wildcats are the athletic teams that represent Northwestern 
University, a founding member of the Big Ten Conference and the only private 
university in the conference. Northwestern has eight men's and eleven women's 
Division I sports teams. The mascot is Willie the Wildcat. The athletic 
director is former Northern Illinois University Athletic Director Jim Phillips, 
who took office in April 2008. Northwestern's athletic teams are nicknamed 
the Wildcats. Before 1924, they were known as "The Purple" and unofficially 
as "The Fighting Methodists." The name Wildcats was bestowed upon the university 
in 1924 by Wallace Abbey, a writer for the Chicago Daily Tribune who wrote 
that even in a loss to the University of Chicago, "Football players had 
not come down from Evanston; wildcats would be a name better suited to 
Coach Glenn Thistletwaite's boys." The team was also referred to in the 
article as "a Purple wall of wildcats."[2] The name was so popular that 
university board members made "Wildcats" the official nickname just months 
later. In 1972, the student body voted to change the official nickname 
from "Wildcats" to "Purple Haze" but the new name never stuck.[3] Northwestern 
is a charter member of the Big Ten Conference. It is the only remaining 
private institution in the conference, as the University of Chicago also 
belonged to the conference before dropping out in 1946. At only 8,200 undergraduates, 
it is by far the smallest. The second-smallest school, Iowa, is almost 
three times as large as Northwestern, at 21,000 undergraduates. Currently, 
Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men's and 11 women's) 
in addition to numerous club sports.[4] Current successful athletic programs 
include football, men's soccer, wrestling, men's swimming, men's golf, 
women's tennis, softball, fencing and women's lacrosse. The women's lacrosse 
team is the six-time NCAA national champion, and went undefeated in 2005.[5][6] 
The 1930–31 Wildcats were retroactively named national champions by both 
the Helms Athletic Foundation (in 1942) and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[7][8] 
The Northwestern Athletics' mascot is Willie the Wildcat. However, the 
team's first mascot was not Willie, but a live, caged bear cub from the 
Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw. In fall 1923, Furpaw was driven to the playing 
field to greet the fans before each game. After a losing season, the team 
decided that Furpaw was the harbinger of bad luck and banished him from 
campus. Willie made his debut ten years later in 1933 as a logo, but did 
not actually come to life until 1947, when members of the Alpha Delta fraternity 
dressed up as him during the Homecoming parade. The Northwestern University 
Marching Band (NUMB) performs at all home football and lead cheers in the 
student section and the alma mater at the end of the game. In 1998, two 
former Northwestern basketball players were charged and convicted for sports 
bribery as a result of being paid to shave points in games against three 
other Big Ten schools during the 1995 season.[9][10][11] The football team 
became embroiled in a different betting scandal later that year when federal 
prosecutors indicted four former players for perjury related to betting 
on their own games.[12] In August 2001, Rashidi Wheeler, a senior safety, 
collapsed and died during practice from an asthma attack.[13][14] An autopsy 
revealed that he had ephedrine, a stimulant banned by the NCAA, in his 
system which prompted Northwestern to investigate the prevalence of stimulants 
and other banned substances across all of its athletic programs.[15][16] 
In 2006, the Northwestern women's soccer team was suspended and coach Jenny 
Haigh resigned following the release of images of alleged hazing.[17][18] 
During football games, students jingle their car keys before every kickoff 
and punt. When Northwestern is on defense, students extend their arms, 
make a claw with their hands, and growl. The "official" cheer at Northwestern 
sporting events is the chant "Go U! NU!" Students also commonly taunt opposing 
sports teams with "State-school, state-school", referencing that all institutions 
of the Big Ten conference, except for Northwestern, are public universities. 
The Northwestern student section is led in their cheers by the Northwestern 
University WildPride Spirit Squad, who performs on the sidelines during 
all home games and accompanies the football team to all away games. The 
NUMB performs on the field and in the stands at all home games and follows 
the football team to one Big Ten away game per season. For many years, 
students would throw marshmallows at the kick-off of football games. Northwestern 
archivist Patrick Quinn says that students were likely "trying to get them 
into the tubas, and then started throwing them at each other", leading 
to the tradition of throwing marshmallows at the field. While Gary Barnett 
was football coach, he banned marshmallows because they supposedly detracted 
from the serious level of football that he wanted for the school. Northwestern's 
fight song is "Go U Northwestern" A secondary fight song is "Rise Northwestern 
(Push on Song)", the final 4-measure tag (ending with a shouted "Go, 'Cats!") 
of which is often played after first downs. Northwestern University has 
won 8 NCAA national championships:[19] See also: National team titles that 
were not bestowed by the NCAA (4 are unofficial NCAA championships): See 
also: The Northwestern University football team has evidence of organization 
in 1876. Northwestern achieved an all-time high rank of No. 1 during the 
1936 and 1962 seasons, which has thus far not been duplicated. The football 
team plays at Ryan Field (formerly known as Dyche Stadium). The football 
team has a history of mediocrity: Its all-time record is 468–614–44 (.435) 
and until July 2012, the program held the official record for Division 
I-A losses.[24][25] Other dubious distinctions include being on the losing 
end of the greatest comeback in Division I-A history[26] and holding the 
record for the longest losing streak in Division I-A – 34 consecutive games 
between 1979 and 1982.[27][28] Until 2013, the Wildcats had been to nine 
bowl games since 1995 – 1996 Rose Bowl, 1997 Citrus Bowl, 2000 Alamo Bowl, 
2003 Motor City Bowl, 2005 Sun Bowl, 2008 Alamo Bowl, the 2010 Outback 
Bowl, the 2011 TicketCity Bowl and 2011 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas—but 
had not won a postseason contest since the 1949 Rose Bowl until the 2013 
Gator Bowl.[29] Following the sudden death of football coach Randy Walker 
in 2006,[30] 31-year-old and former All-American Northwestern linebacker 
Pat Fitzgerald assumed the position becoming the youngest Division I FBS 
coach at the time.[31][32] The men's basketball team has never earned a 
bid to the NCAA tournament. Its last conference championship came in 1933, 
when it tied with Ohio State. The 1931 team was retro-picked as national 
champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and, later, by the Premo-Porretta 
Power Poll.[7] The Wildcats have played in the National Invitation Tournament 
seven times, most recently in 2012. The team plays its home games in Welsh-Ryan 
Arena, where it is cheered on by the Wildside student section. The head 
coach is former Duke Associate Head Coach Chris Collins; he succeeds Bill 
Carmody. Under Carmody, a former head coach at Princeton, the team ran 
the Princeton offense. Northwestern is the only school from a Power Five 
conference, and one of the few long-standing members of Division I, to 
have never played in the NCAA Tournament. Northwestern has won the national 
championship in women's lacrosse five straight times, from 2005 to 2009, 
and then again in 2011 and 2012, giving them 7 championships in 8 years. 
In 2007, the team joined Maryland as the only other school to three-peat. 
The run started in 2005, when the team enjoyed a perfect season and defeated 
many long-established east-coast schools after only five years as a varsity 
sport to capture the school's first national championship since 1941. In 
doing so, it became the westernmost institution to ever win the title. 
Soon after, the team made national news when members appeared in a White 
House photo with President Bush wearing thong sandals, or flip-flops, dubbed 
as the "White House flip-flop flap."[33] The 2009 season also was an undefeated 
run. In their five championship seasons, the Wildcats have a 106–3 record.[34] 
In 2006 and 2007, Kristen Kjellman received the Tewaaraton Trophy, which 
honors the best collegiate lacrosse player in the country. She was the 
first player from a non-East coast school to win the distinction, and the 
first player to be a two-time winner.[35] Midfielder Hannah Nielsen received 
the award in 2008 and 2009, the second player to be a two-time winner.[36][37] 
Northwestern's Shannon Smith won the award in 2011.[38] The Northwestern 
University Wildcats men's wrestling team competes in the NCAA Division 
I Championships in the Welsh-Ryan Arena. The wrestling facilities are named 
in honor of Ken Kraft, for his 48 years of involvement with the Northwestern 
wrestling program. Kraft was a four-year member of the Wildcat wrestling 
squad and NU's head coach for 22 years. In 2004, Kraft retired after spending 
51 years at NU as an athlete, coach and administrator.[39] Drew Pariano 
is the current head coach for the Wildcats succeeding his college coach, 
Tim Cysewski, in 2010. Pariano has coached 11 NCAA All-Americans while 
at Northwestern and 3 NCAA Champions: Dustin Fox at Heavyweight in 2008, 
Jake Herbert at 184 lbs. in 2007 & 2009 and Jason Tsirtsis at 149 lbs. 
in 2014. Jake Herbert was also a three-time Big Ten Conference champion, 
and four-time NCAA All-American. He went 149–4 while at Northwestern University 
and won both the 2009 Dan Hodge Trophy, awarded to the best college wrestler 
in the nation, and the 2009 Big Ten Athlete of the Year award.[40] The 
men's golf team has won eight Big Ten Conference championships: 1925, 1937, 
1939, 1948, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006. They have twice placed second in the 
NCAA Championships: 1939, 1945. Luke Donald won the NCAA Individual Championship 
in 1999. He was ranked number 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking for 
56 weeks in 2011 and 2012. The four best career stroke averages in school 
history are held by Luke Donald, Tom Johnson, Jess Daley, and David Lipsky.[41] 
The Northwestern Wildcats men's and women's soccer teams both use the 20,000-capacity 
Toyota Park for their home games for the 2015 season due to construction 
of the Lanny and Sharon Martin Stadium on the Lakeside Complex. The field 
is a part of a $250 million athletics upgrade on the lakefront. The Northwestern 
Softball program began in 1976 and has amassed 5 Big Ten championships, 
10 NCAA Tournament appearances, and 5 appearances in the Women's college 
World series- including 2007 and their national runner-up performance 2006. 
In the NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships held from 1924 through 
1936, no team points were officially awarded.[42] Northwestern won four 
unofficial national team championships during these years, which were proclaimed 
in the newspapers of the time, second only to Michigan's seven.[43] Matt 
Grevers, a Northwestern alum, won two gold medals (100-meter backstroke, 
400-meter medley relay) and a silver medal (400-meter freestyle relay) 
at the 2012 London Olympic Games. Their chief Big Ten rival is the Illinois 
Fighting Illini. In football, the teams annually compete for the Land of 
Lincoln Trophy. This trophy replaced the Sweet Sioux Tomahawk Trophy in 
2009 after the use of the Tomahawk was acknowledged as offensive to the 
culture of Native Americans. Northwestern fans have also cultivated strong 
rivalries with many Big Ten Conference foes, including Iowa and, particularly, 
Wisconsin. The rivalry with Wisconsin, the Big Ten conference school geographically 
closest to the Evanston campus, has grown stronger in recent years, though 
there is currently no official trophy for the football game. Although the 
schools rarely play each other, there has been discussion of starting a 
rivalry game with Northern Illinois University to help boost attendance 
and interest during the non-conference schedule. The 2005–2006 academic 
year was one of the best athletic seasons in Northwestern University's 
history. The football team capped a 7–5 season and third-place finish in 
the Big Ten with a bid to the Sun Bowl. Following the women's lacrosse 
team's second National Championship, the Women's doubles tennis team of 
Christelle Grier and Alexis Prousis won the National Championship as well. 
In addition, Men's tennis player Peter Rispoli captured the Flight B Singles 
Championship. The Women's Softball team made an incredible run to the finals 
of the Women's College World Series, finishing in second place. In May 
2006 the website BadJocks.com republished photos a reader had found on 
Webshots of the women's soccer team hazing its freshmen. The whole team 
was suspended for a time as a result and in the wake of the incident Head 
Coach Jenny Haigh resigned. Since, Athletic Director Mark Murphy named 
Stephanie Erickson, the school's all-time leader in goals and points, as
