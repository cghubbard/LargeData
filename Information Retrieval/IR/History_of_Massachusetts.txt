Massachusetts was first colonized by principally English Europeans in the 
early 17th century, and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 
18th century. Prior to English colonization of the area, it was inhabited 
by a variety of mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes. The first 
permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding 
of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower. It set 
precedents but never grew large. A large-scale Puritan migration began 
in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and spawned 
the settlement of other New England colonies. Friction with the natives 
erupted in the high-casualty King Philip's War in the 1670s. Puritanism 
was the established religion and was strictly enforced; dissenters were 
exiled. The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its 
religious intolerance and the status of its charter. Most people were farmers. 
Businessmen established wide-ranging trade links, sending ships to the 
West Indies and Europe, and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the 
Navigation Acts. These political and trade issues led to the revocation 
of the Massachusetts charter in 1684. The king in 1686 established the 
Dominion of New England to govern all of New England to centralize royal 
control and weaken local government. The intensely unpopular rule by Sir 
Edmund Andros came to a sudden end in 1689 with an uprising sparked by 
the Glorious Revolution in England. The new king William III established 
the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, to govern a territory roughly 
equivalent to that of the modern state and Maine. Its governors were appointed 
by the crown, in contrast to the predecessor colonies, which had elected 
their own governors. This created friction between the colonists and the 
crown, which reached its height in the early days of the American Revolution 
in the 1760s and 1770s over issues of who could levy taxes. Massachusetts 
was where the American Revolutionary War began in 1775 when London tried 
to shut down local self-government. The commonwealth formally adopted the 
state constitution in 1780, electing John Hancock its first governor. The 
state was the first to abolish slavery in 1783. In the 19th century Massachusetts 
became America's center of manufacturing, with the development of precision 
manufacturing and weaponry in Springfield, and large-scale textile mill 
complexes in Worcester, Haverhill, Lowell, and other communities using 
their rivers for power. It was a major intellectual center and center of 
abolitionism. The Springfield Armory made most of the weaponry for the 
Union in the American Civil War. After the war, immigrants from Europe 
flooded into the state, continuing to expand its industrial base until 
the 1950s, when textiles and other industries started to fade away, leaving 
a "rust belt" of empty mills and factories. Labor unions were important 
after the 1860s, as were big city political machines. The state's strength 
as a center of education contributed to the development of an economy based 
on information technology and biotechnology in the later years of the 20th 
century, leading to the "Massachusetts Miracle" of the late 1980s. Massachusetts 
was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family such 
as the Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett.[1][2] 
The Algonquian tribes inhabited the area prior to European settlement. 
In the Massachusetts Bay area resided the Massachusett people. Near the 
present Vermont and New Hampshire borders and the Merrimack River valley 
was the traditional home of the Pennacook tribe. Cape Cod, Nantucket, Martha's 
Vineyard, and southeast Massachusetts were the home of the Wampanoag, whom 
the Pilgrims met. The extreme end of the Cape was inhabited by the closely 
related Nauset tribe. Much of the central portion and the Connecticut River 
valley was home to the loosely organized Nipmuc peoples. The Berkshires 
were the home of both the Pocomtuc and the Mahican tribes. Spillovers of 
Narragansett and Mohegan from Rhode Island and Connecticut, respectively, 
were also present. Although cultivation of crops like squash and corn supplemented 
their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering 
and fishing for most of their food supply.[1] Villages consisted of lodges 
called wigwams as well as long houses,[2] and tribes were led by male or 
female elders known as sachems.[3] Europeans began exploring the coast 
of North America in the 16th century, but few attempts were made at permanent 
settlement anywhere. Early European explorers of the New England coast 
included the Englishman Bartholomew Gosnold (who named Cape Cod in 1602), 
Frenchman Samuel de Champlain (who charted the northern coast as far as 
Cape Cod in 1605 and 1606), and the Englishmen John Smith and Henry Hudson. 
Fishing ships from Europe also worked in the fish-rich waters off the coast, 
and may have engaged in trade with some of the natives. The sailors and 
fishermen brought European diseases which led to the rapid decline of the 
Indian population before the first large-scale arrival of settlers in the 
1630s. Large numbers of natives were decimated by virgin soil epidemics 
such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and perhaps leptospirosis,[4] against 
which they had no immunity. In 1617–1619, smallpox killed 90% of the Native 
Americans in the region.[5] The first English settlers in Massachusetts, 
the Pilgrims, established their settlement at Plymouth in 1620, and developed 
friendly relations with the native Wampanoag.[6] This was the second successful 
permanent English colony in North America, after the Jamestown Colony. 
Before heading to the New World, they migrated to Holland to escape the 
harsh treatment from King James for rejecting England's official church. 
Although they were allowed some religious liberties in Holland, the liberalism 
and openness of the Dutch to all styles of life horrified them. They approached 
the Virginia Company and asked to settle "as a distinct body of themselves" 
in America. In the fall of 1619, they sailed to North America on the Mayflower, 
first landing near the tip of Cape Cod (modern-day Provincetown, Massachusetts). 
Blown north off its course, the Mayflower landed at a site that had been 
named Plymouth. Since the area was not land that lay within their charter, 
they created the Mayflower Compact, one of America's first documents of 
self-governance, prior to landing. The first year was extremely difficult, 
with inadequate supplies. They also suffered grievously from smallpox and 
malaria. They were assisted, however, in their time of trouble by the Wampanoag 
under-chief Massasoit. In 1621 (following the one held at Berkeley Plantation 
in Virginia, 1619), they celebrated their first Thanksgiving Day together 
to thank God for blessings of good harvest and survival. This Thanksgiving 
came to represent the peace that existed at that time between the Native 
Americans and the Pilgrims. Although only about half of the Mayflower company 
survived the first year, the colony grew slowly over the next ten years, 
and was estimated to have 300 inhabitants by 1630.[7] The Plymouth colonists 
were joined by a colony of adventurers that settled nearby at present-day 
Weymouth in 1622. This colony was short-lived, and abandoned in 1623, only 
to be replaced by another small colony led by Robert Gorges. This settlement 
also failed, and individuals from these colonies either returned to England, 
joined the Plymouth colonists, or established individual outposts elsewhere 
on the shores of Massachusetts Bay. In 1624 the Dorchester Company established 
a settlement on Cape Ann. This colony only survived until 1626, but again, 
a few settlers remained behind. The Pilgrims were followed by Puritans 
who established the Massachusetts Bay Colony at present-day Salem (1629) 
and Boston (1630).[8] The Puritans, who believed the Church of England 
was too hierarchical (among other disagreements) came to Massachusetts 
for religious freedom,[9] although, like the Plymouth colony, the bay colony 
was founded under a royal charter. The Puritans were mainly from East Anglia 
and southwestern regions of England. With an estimated 20,000 migrants 
between 1628 and 1642, the Massachusetts Bay colony eclipsed Plymouth in 
population and economy, the chief factors being more suitable harbor facilities 
for trade and the growth of a prosperous merchant class. Both religious 
dissension and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded 
shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay. Dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson 
and Roger Williams were banished due to religious disagreements with Massachusetts 
Bay authorities; (Hutchinson held meetings in her home discussing flaws 
in the Puritan beliefs, while Williams believed that the Puritan beliefs 
were wrong, and the Indians must be respected.) In 1636, Williams founded 
the colony of Rhode Island and Hutchinson joined him there two years later.[10] 
Others, such as John Wheelwright, objecting to the religious rule in Massachusetts 
Bay moved north, joining existing small settlements or establishing new 
ones in present-day Maine and New Hampshire. On settling beside the Connecticut 
River for the first time in 1633 – and for centuries following – Englishmen 
referred to it simply as "The Great River," because its length and breadth 
made English rivers like the Mersey, Thames, and Avon all seem like small 
streams by comparison. (The Connecticut River is approximately twice as 
long as England's Thames.)[11] In 1636, a group of settlers led by the 
Massachusetts Bay Colony's assistant treasurer, William Pynchon founded 
Springfield, Massachusetts, after first scouting the region's most advantageous 
location for trading and farming. To Pynchon's surprise, it had not yet 
been settled.[12][13] "Agawam," as Springfield was originally called, is 
located just north of the Connecticut River's first falls that are unnavigable 
by seagoing vessels. It also sits amidst the fertile valley that contains 
New England's best agricultural land and lies equidistant to the ports 
of Boston and Albany. Unlike the three settlements south of Springfield 
at the time – Windsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield, Connecticut – the Natives 
surrounding Springfield were friendly.[13][14] In 1640, Pynchon annexed 
Springfield to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut 
Colony, because he believed that Connecticut's harsh policies toward the 
Natives were bad for both business and survival.[15] Thus in 1640, with 
the annexation of Springfield, the Massachusetts Bay Colony's southern 
and western borders were established.[16] In 1636 all of the New England 
colonies went to war with the Pequot of southeastern Connecticut, practically 
wiping them out. In 1646 the Long Parliament gave the missionary John Eliot 
a commission and funds to preach to the Wampanoags. He succeeded in converting 
a large number. The colonial government placed the converted Indians (known 
as Praying Indians) in a ring of villages around Boston as a defensive 
strategy. The oldest such village, Natick, was built in 1651. The Puritans 
came to Massachusetts to establish a society according to their religious 
principles. They were not tolerant of religious views significantly different 
from their own. Quakers, Baptists, and other religious Nonconformists were 
banned, and in 1660 four Quakers were hanged on Boston Common. In addition 
to the banished Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker left 
Massachusetts because of the Puritans' lack of religious tolerance, founding 
the Connecticut Colony. Racial tensions led to King Philip's War (1675–76), 
the bloodiest Indian war of the early colonial period. There were major 
campaigns in the Pioneer Valley and Plymouth. Starting in the 1670s, Massachusetts 
followed the general colonial practice of adopting slave codes, which removed 
the limitation on the term of slavery for non-whites only. It became fashionable 
for respectable families to own one or more household slaves as cooks or 
butlers. King Philip's War was the single greatest calamity ever to occur 
in seventeenth-century Puritan New England. In little over a year, nearly 
half of the region's towns were attacked – the major settlements at Providence, 
Rhode Island and Springfield, Massachusetts were both burned to the ground. 
(See: the Attack on Springfield.) New England's economy was all but ruined, 
and much of its population was killed.[17][18] Proportionately, it was 
one of the bloodiest and costliest wars in the history of North America.[19] 
Due to persistent shortages of hard currency, the Massachusetts Bay government 
established a mint, producing a colonial paper currency, the Massachusetts 
pound, beginning in 1652. In 1645 the General Court ordered rural towns 
to increase sheep production. Sheep provided meat and especially wool for 
the local cloth industry, and reduced the expense of imports of British 
cloth. The program was a success as many towns increased grazing lands, 
protected sheep, and saw larger and larger flocks.[20] Following the restoration 
of Charles II to the throne in 1660, government practices in the colonies 
came under more scrutiny. Parliament passed the Navigation Acts to regulate 
trade for the benefit of the mother country. Massachusetts, with a thriving 
merchant fleet, often ran afoul of the trade regulations. Its government 
was reluctant to enforce them. Combined with intolerant religious practices, 
and the refusal to allow the Church of England to operate in the colony, 
led Charles II to formally vacate the Massachusetts charter in 1684. In 
1660, King Charles II was restored to the throne. Colonial matters brought 
to his attention led him to propose the amalgamation of all of the New 
England colonies into a single administrative unit. In 1685 he was succeeded 
by James II, an outspoken Catholic who implemented the proposal. In June 
1684, the charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was annulled, but its 
government continued to rule until James appointed Joseph Dudley to the 
new post of President of New England in 1686. Dudley established his authority 
later in New Hampshire and the King's Province (part of current Rhode Island), 
maintaining this position until Sir Edmund Andros arrived to become the 
Royal Governor of the Dominion of New England. The rule of Andros was unpopular. 
He ruled without a representative assembly, vacated land titles, restricted 
town meetings, enforced the Navigation Acts, and promoted the Church of 
England, angering virtually every segment of Massachusetts colonial society. 
Andros dealt a major blow to the colonists by challenging their title to 
the land; unlike England the great majority of New Englanders were land-owners. 
Taylor says that because they "regarded secure real estate as fundamental 
to their liberty, status, and prosperity, the colonists felt horrified 
by the sweeping and expensive challenge to their land titles."[21] After 
James II was overthrown by King William and Queen Mary in late 1688, Boston 
colonists overthrew Andros and his officials in 1689. Both Massachusetts 
and Plymouth returned to their previous governments until 1692. During 
King William's War (1689–1697), the colony launched an unsuccessful expedition 
against Quebec under Sir William Phips in 1690, which had been financed 
by issuing paper bonds set against the gains expected from taking the city.[22] 
The colony continued to be on the front lines of the war, and experienced 
widespread French and Indian raids on its northern and western frontiers. 
In 1691, William and Mary chartered the Province of Massachusetts Bay, 
combining the territories of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Maine, Nova Scotia 
(which then included New Brunswick), and the islands south of Cape Cod. 
For its first governor they chose Sir William Phips. Phips came to Boston 
in 1692 to begin his rule, and was immediately thrust into the witchcraft 
hysteria in Salem. He established the court that heard the notorious Salem 
witch trials, and oversaw the war effort until he was recalled in 1694. 
The province was the largest and most economically important in New England, 
and one where many American institutions and traditions were formed. Unlike 
southern colonies, it was built around small towns rather than scattered 
farms. The westernmost portion of Massachusetts, the Berkshires, were settled 
during the three decades following the end of the French and Indian War, 
largely by Scots. Sir Francis Bernard, the Royal Governor, named this new 
area..."Berkshire", in honor of his home county in England. The largest 
settlement in Berkshire County was Pittsfield, Massachusetts, founded in 
1761.[23] The educational system, headed by Harvard College, was the best 
in the 13 colonies. Newspapers became a major communications system in 
the 18th century, with Boston taking a leading role in the British colonies.[24] 
Teenaged Benjamin Franklin (born on January 17, 1706 in Milk Street) worked 
on one of the earliest newspapers, The New-England Courant (owned by his 
brother) until he ran away to Philadelphia in 1723. Five Boston newspapers 
presented a full range of opinions during the coming of the American revolution. 
In Worcester, printer Isaiah Thomas made the Massachusetts Spy the influential 
voice of the western settlers.[25] Farming was the largest economic activity. 
Most farming towns were largely self-sufficient, with families trading 
with each other for items they did not produce themselves; the surplus 
was sold to cities.[26] and Fishing was important in coastal towns like 
Marblehead. Great quantities of cod were exported to the slave colonies 
in the West Indies.[27] Merchant trade was based in Salem and Boston, with 
numerous wealthy merchants engaged in worldwide trade; they typically stationed 
sons and nephews as their agents based in ports around the empire.[28] 
Their business grew dramatically after 1783 when they no longer were confined 
to the British Empire.[29] Shipbuilding was a fast-growing industry. Most 
other manufactured products were imported from Britain (or smuggled in 
from the Netherlands). In 1690, the Massachusetts Bay Colony became the 
first to issue paper money in what would become the United States, but 
soon others began printing their own money as well. The demand for currency 
in the colonies was due to the scarcity of coins, which had been the primary 
means of trade.[30] Colonies' paper currencies were used to pay for their 
expenses, as well as a means to lend money to the colonies' citizens. Paper 
money quickly became the primary means of exchange within each colony, 
and it even began to be used in financial transactions with other colonies.[31] 
However, some of the currencies were not redeemable in gold or silver, 
which caused them to depreciate.[30] The Currency Act of 1751 set limits 
on the issuance of Bills of Credit by the New England states and set requirements 
for the redemption of any bills issued. This Act was in response to the 
overissuance of bills by Rhode Island, eventually reducing their value 
to 1/27 of the issuing value.[32] The Currency Act of 1764 completely banned 
the issuance of Bills of Credit (paper money) in the colonies and the making 
of such bills legal tender because their depreciation allowed the discharge 
of debts with depreciated paper at a rate less than contracted for, to 
the great discouragement and prejudice of the trade and commerce of his 
Majesty's subjects. The ban proved extremely harmful to the economy of 
the colonies and inhibited trade, both within the colonies and abroad.[33] 
The colony was always short of gold and silver and printed a great deal 
of paper money, which caused inflation that favored farmers but angered 
business interests. By 1750, however, the colony recalled its paper currency 
and transitioned to a specie currency based on the British reimbursement 
(in gold and silver) for its spending in the French and Indian wars. The 
large-scale merchants and Royal officials welcomed the transition but many 
farmers and smaller businessmen were opposed.[34] The colony fought alongside 
British regulars in a series of French and Indian Wars that were characterized 
by brutal border raids and attacks by Indians organized and supplied by 
New France. Particularly in King William's War (1689–97) and Queen Anne's 
War (1702–13), the colony's rural communities were directly exposed to 
French and Indian attacks, with Deerfield raided in 1704 and Haverhill 
raided in 1708. Boston responded, launching naval expeditions against Acadia 
and Quebec in both wars. During Queen Anne's War, Massachusetts men were 
involved in the Conquest of Acadia (1710), which became the Province of 
Nova Scotia. The province was also involved in Dummer's War, in which Indian 
tribes were driven from northern New England. In 1745, during King George's 
War, Massachusetts provincial forces successfully besieged Fortress Louisbourg. 
The fortress was returned to France at the end of the war, angering many 
colonists who viewed it as a threat to their security. During the French 
and Indian War, Governor William Shirley was instrumental in the Expulsion 
of the Acadians from Nova Scotia and trying to settle them in New England. 
After the expulsion, Shirley also was involved in transporting New England 
Planters to settle Nova Scotia on the former Acadian farms.[35] Many troops 
from Massachusetts participated in the successful Siege of Havana in 1762. 
Britain's victory in the war led to its acquisition of New France, removing 
the immediate northern threat to Massachusetts that the French had posed. 
Boston was hit by a major smallpox epidemic in 1721. Some colonial leaders 
called for use of the new technique of inoculation, whereby a patient would 
get a weak form of the disease and become permanently immune. Puritan minister 
Cotton Mather and physician Zabdiel Boylston led the drive for inoculation, 
while physician William Douglass and newspaper editor James Franklin led 
the opposition.[36] In 1755, about 4:15 am on Tuesday, November 18, was 
the most destructive earthquake yet known in New England. The first pulsations 
of the ground were followed for about a minute of tremulous motion. Next 
came a quick vibration and several jerks much worse than the first. Houses 
rocked and cracked; furniture fell over. Dr. Edward A. Holyoke, of Salem, 
wrote in his diary that he "thought of nothing less than being buried instantly 
in the ruins of the house." The shaking continued for two to three minutes 
more, and seemed to move from northwest to southeast. The ocean along the 
coast was affected; ships shook so much that sleeping sailors awoke, thinking 
they had run aground. In Boston, the earthquake threw dishes on the floor, 
stopped clocks, and bent vane-rods on churches and Faneuil Hall. Stone 
walls collapsed. New springs appeared, and old springs dried up. Subterranean 
streams changed their courses, emptying many wells. The worst damage was 
to chimneys. In Boston alone, about a hundred were leveled; about fifteen 
hundred were damaged, the streets in some places almost covered with fallen 
bricks. Falling chimneys broke some roofs. Many wooden buildings in Boston 
were thrown down, and some brick buildings suffered; the gable ends of 
twelve or fifteen were knocked down to the eaves. Despite the danger and 
many narrow escapes, no one was killed or seriously injured. Aftershocks 
continued for four days.[37][38] The relationship between the provincial 
government and the crown-appointed governor was often difficult and contentious. 
The governors sought to assert the royal prerogatives granted in the provincial 
charter, and the provincial government sought to strip or minimize the 
governor's power. For example, each governor was ordered to enact legislation 
for providing permanent salaries for crown officials, but the legislature 
refused to do so, using its ability to grant stipends annually as a means 
of control over the governor. The province's periodic issuance of paper 
currency was also a persistent source of friction between factions in the 
province, due to its inflationary effects. Notable royal governors during 
this period were Joseph Dudley, Thomas Hutchinson, Jonathan Belcher, Francis 
Bernard, and General Thomas Gage. Gage was the last British governor of 
Massachusetts, and his effective rule extended to little more than Boston. 
Massachusetts was a center of the movement for independence from Great 
Britain, earning it the nickname, the "Cradle of Liberty". Colonists here 
had long had uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open 
rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s.[39] The Boston 
Tea Party is an example of the protest spirit in the early 1770s, while 
the Boston Massacre escalated the conflict.[40] Anti-British activity by 
men like Sam Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British 
government, were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies 
and the outbreak of the American Revolution.[41] The Battles of Lexington 
and Concord initiated the American Revolutionary War and were fought in 
the Massachusetts towns of Lexington and Concord.[42] Future President 
George Washington took over what would become the Continental Army after 
the battle. His first victory was the Siege of Boston in the winter of 
1775–6, after which the British were forced to evacuate the city.[43] The 
event is still celebrated in Suffolk County as Evacuation Day.[44] In 1777, 
George Washington and Henry Knox founded the Arsenal at Springfield, which 
catalyzed many innovations in Massachusetts' Connecticut River Valley. 
Boston was the center of revolutionary activity in the decade before 1775, 
with Massachusetts natives Samuel Adams, John Adams, and John Hancock as 
leaders who would become important in the revolution. Boston had been under 
military occupation since 1768. When customs officials were attacked by 
mobs, two regiments of British regulars arrived. They had been housed in 
the city with increasing public outrage. In Boston on March 5, 1770, what 
began as a rock-throwing incident against a few British soldiers ended 
in the shooting of five men by British soldiers in what became known as 
the Boston Massacre. The incident caused further anger against British 
authority in the commonwealth over taxes and the presence of the British 
soldiers. One of the many taxes protested by the colonists was a tax on 
tea, imposed when Parliament passed the Townshend Acts, and retained when 
most of the provisions of those acts were repealed. With the passage of 
the Tea Act in 1773, tea sold by the British East India Company would become 
less expensive than smuggled tea, and there would be reduced profitmaking 
opportunities for Massachusetts merchants engaged in the tea trade. This 
led to protests against the delivery of the company's tea to Boston. On 
December 16, 1773, when a tea ship of the East India Company was planning 
to land taxed tea in Boston, a group of local men known as the Sons of 
Liberty sneaked onto the boat the night before it was to be unloaded and 
dumped all the tea into the harbor, an act known as the Boston Tea Party. 
The Boston Tea Party prompted the British government to pass the Intolerable 
Acts in 1774 that brought stiff punishment on Massachusetts. They closed 
the port of Boston, the economic lifeblood of the Commonwealth, and reduced 
self-government. Local self-government was ended and the colony put under 
military rule. The Patriots formed the Massachusetts Provincial Congress 
after the provincial legislature was disbanded by Governor Gage. The suffering 
of Boston and the tyranny of its rule caused great sympathy and stirred 
resentment throughout the Thirteen Colonies. On February 9, 1775, the British 
Parliament declared Massachusetts to be in rebellion, and sent additional 
troops to restore order to the colony. With the local population largely 
opposing British authority, troops moved from Boston on April 18, 1775, 
to destroy the military supplies of local resisters in Concord. Paul Revere 
made his famous ride to warn the locals in response to this march. On the 
19th, in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, where the famous "shot heard 
'round the world" was fired, British troops, after running over the Lexington 
militia, were forced back into the city by local resistors. The city was 
quickly brought under siege. Fighting broke out again in June when the 
British took the Charlestown Peninsula in the Battle of Bunker Hill after 
the colonial militia fortified Breed's Hill. The British won the battle, 
but at a very large cost, and were unable to break the siege. The British 
made a desperate attempt by using biological weapons against the Americans 
by sending infected civilians with smallpox behind American lines but this 
was soon contained by Continental General George Washington who launched 
a vaccination program to ensure his troops and civilians were in good health 
after the damage biological warfare caused. Soon after the Battle of Bunker 
Hill, General George Washington took charge of the rebel army, and when 
he acquired heavy cannon in March 1776, the British were forced to leave, 
marking the first great colonial victory of the war. Ever since "Evacuation 
Day" has been celebrated as a state holiday. Massachusetts was not invaded 
again but in 1779 the disastrous Penobscot Expedition took place in the 
District of Maine, then part of the Commonwealth. Trapped by the British 
fleet, the American sailors sank the ships of the Massachusetts state navy 
before it could be captured by the British. In May 1778, the section of 
Freetown that later became Fall River was raided by the British, and in 
September 1778, the communities of Martha's Vineyard and New Bedford were 
also subjected to a British raid. John Adams was a leader in the independence 
movement and he helped secure a unanimous vote for independence and on 
July 4, 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence was adopted 
in Philadelphia. It was signed first by Massachusetts resident John Hancock, 
president of the Continental Congress. Soon afterward the Declaration of 
Independence was read to the people of Boston from the balcony of the State 
House. Massachusetts was no longer a colony; it was a state and part of 
a new nation, the United States of America. A Constitutional Convention 
drew up a state constitution, which was drafted primarily by John Adams, 
and ratified by the people on June 15, 1780. Adams, along with Samuel Adams 
and James Bowdoin, wrote in the Preamble to the Constitution of the Commonwealth: 
We, therefore, the people of Massachusetts, acknowledging, with grateful 
hearts, the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording 
us, in the course of His Providence, an opportunity, deliberately and peaceably, 
without fraud, violence or surprise, on entering into an Original, explicit, 
and Solemn Compact with each other; and of forming a new Constitution of 
Civil Government, for Ourselves and Posterity, and devoutly imploring His 
direction in so interesting a design, Do agree upon, ordain and establish, 
the following Declaration of Rights, and Frame of Government, as the Constitution 
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Bostonian John Adams, known as the 
"Atlas of Independence", was an important figure in both the struggle for 
independence as well as the formation of the new United States.[45] Adams 
was highly involved in the push for separation from Britain and the writing 
of the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780 (which, in the Elizabeth Freeman 
and Quock Walker cases, effectively made Massachusetts the first state 
to have a constitution that declared universal rights and, as interpreted 
by Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice William Cushing, abolished slavery).[45][46] 
Adams became minister to Britain in the 1780s, Vice President in 1789 and 
succeeded Washington as President in 1797. His son, John Quincy Adams, 
would go on to become the sixth US President. Massachusetts was the first 
state to abolish slavery. The new constitution also dropped any religious 
tests for political office, though local tax money had to be paid to support 
local churches. People who belonged to non-Congregational churches paid 
their tax money to their own church, and the churchless paid to the Congregationalists. 
Baptist leader Isaac Backus vigorously fought these provisions, arguing 
people should have freedom of choice regarding financial support of religion. 
Adams drafted most of the document and despite numerous amendments it still 
follows his line of thought. He distrusted utopians and pure democracy, 
and put his faith in a system of checks and balances; he admired the principles 
of the unwritten British Constitution. He insisted on a bicameral legislature 
which would represent both the gentlemen and the common citizen. Above 
all he insisted on a government by laws, not men.[47] The constitution 
also changed the name of the Massachusetts Bay State to the Commonwealth 
of Massachusetts. Still in force, it is the oldest constitution in current 
use in the world. The economy of rural Massachusetts suffered an economic 
depression after the war ended. Merchants, pressured for hard currency 
by overseas partners, made similar demands on local debtors, and the state 
raised taxes in order to pay off its own war debts. Efforts to collect 
both public and private debts from cash-poor farmers led to protests that 
flared into direct action in August 1786. Rebels calling themselves Regulators 
(after the North Carolina Regulator movement of the 1760s) succeeded in 
shutting down courts meeting to hear debt and tax collection cases. By 
the end of 1786 a farmer in western Massachusetts named Daniel Shays emerged 
as one of the ringleaders, and government attempts to squelch the protests 
only served to radicalize the protestors. In January 1787 Shays and Luke 
Day organized an attempt to take the federal Springfield Armory; state 
militia holding the armory beat back the attempt with cannon fire. A private 
militia raised by wealthy Boston merchants and led by General Benjamin 
Lincoln broke the back of the rebellion in early February at Petersham, 
but small-scale resistance continued in the western parts of the state 
for a while.[48] The state put down the rebellion—but if it had been too 
weak to do so it would be no help to call on the ineffective federal government. 
The event led nationalists like George Washington to redouble efforts to 
strengthen the weak national government as necessary for survival in a 
dangerous world. Massachusetts, divided along class lines polarized by 
the rebellion, only narrowly ratified the United States Constitution in 
1788.[49] John Chapman often called Johnny "Appleseed" (born on September 
26, 1774, in Leominster, Massachusetts) was an American folk hero and pioneer 
nurseryman who introduced apple trees and established orchards to many 
areas in the Midwestern region of the country including Pennsylvania, Ohio, 
and Indiana. Today, Appleseed is the official folk hero of Massachusetts 
and his stature has served a focus in many children's books, movies, and 
folk tales since the end of the Civil War. [50] In 1836, Mary Lyon opened 
Mount Holyoke College, the first women's college in America. Lyon, a very 
active Congregationalist, promoted the college as an exemplification of 
the ideas of revivalist Jonathan Edwards regarding self-restraint, self-denial, 
and disinterested benevolence.[51] One of the first students was reclusive 
poet Emily Dickinson. During the 19th century, Massachusetts became a national 
leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around Boston 
producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing 
precision manufacturing tools and paper.[52] The economy transformed from 
one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one, initially making 
use of waterpower and later the steam engine to power factories, and canals 
and later railroads for transporting goods and materials.[53] At first, 
the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, 
and later relied upon Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Canada.[54] 
Massachusetts became a leader in industrial innovation and development 
during the 19th century. Since colonial times, there had been a successful 
iron making industry in New England. The first successful ironworks in 
America was established at Saugus in 1646,[55] utilizing bog iron from 
swamps to produce plows, nails, firearms, hoops for barrels and other items 
necessary for the development of the Colony. Other industries would be 
established during this period, such as shipbuilding, lumber, paper and 
furniture making. These small-scale shops and factories often utilized 
the State's many rivers and streams to power their machinery. While Samuel 
Slater had established the first successful textile mill at Pawtucket, 
Rhode Island in 1793, there remained no way to efficiently mass-produce 
cloth from the spun yarn produced by the early mills. The yarn was still 
outsourced to small weaving shops where it was woven into cloth on hand 
looms. The first woolen mill, and the second textile mill in the Blackstone 
Valley, was a "wool carding mill", established in 1810 by Daniel Day, near 
the West River and Blackstone River at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Then, in 
1813, a group of wealthy Boston merchants led by Francis Cabot Lowell, 
known as the Boston Associates, established the first successful integrated 
textile mill in North America at Waltham.[56] Lowell had visited England 
in 1810 and studied the Lancashire textile industry. Because the British 
government prohibited the export of this new technology, Lowell memorized 
plans for the power looms on his return trip to Boston. With the skill 
of master mechanic Paul Moody, the first successful power looms were produced, 
harnessing the power of the Charles River. For the first time, all phases 
of textile production could now be performed under one roof, greatly increasing 
production, and profits. This was the real beginning of the Industrial 
Revolution in America. With the early success of the Boston Manufacturing 
Company at Waltham, the Boston Associates would also later establish several 
other textile towns, including Lowell in 1823, Lawrence in 1845, Chicopee 
in 1848 and Holyoke in 1850. Lowell grew quickly to a city of 33,000 people 
by 1850. Its mills were highly integrated and centrally controlled. An 
ingenious canal system provided the water power that drove the machinery. 
Steam power would be introduced beginning in the 1850s. The mill owners 
initially employed local farm women, often recruited from poor, remote 
parts of New England, and attempted to create a Utopian industrial society 
by providing housing, churches, schools and parks for their workers, unlike 
their English counterparts. Eventually, as the mills grew larger and larger, 
the owners turned to newly arrived Irish immigrants to fill their factories. 
Industrial cities, especially Worcester and Springfield, became important 
centers in textile machinery (in Worcester's case) and precision tool production 
and innovation (in Springfield's case.) While Boston did not have many 
large factories, it became increasingly important as the business and transportation 
hub of all of New England, as well as a national leader in finance, law, 
medicine, education, arts and publishing. In 1826, the Granite Railway 
became the first commercial railroad in the nation. In 1830 the legislature 
chartered three new railroads—the Boston and Lowell, the Boston and Providence, 
and most important of all, the Boston and Worcester. In 1833 it chartered 
the Western Railroad to connect Worcester with Albany and the Erie Canal. 
The system flourished and western grain began flowing to the port of Boston 
for export to Europe, thereby breaking New York City's virtual monopoly 
on trade from the Erie Canal system. Much of the construction work was 
done by Irish Catholic work gangs. They lived in temporary camps but many 
settled in the new industrial cities along the line, where the gang bosses 
became leaders in the Democratic Party.[57] Some of their work is still 
in use. For example, the stone Canton Viaduct at Canton, Massachusetts, 
built in 1835, is still in use by Amtrak's high-speed Acela Express along 
the Boston–Washington, Northeast Corridor. The viaduct required only minor 
changes to bring it up to late-20th-century standards.[58] Beginning in 
the late colonial period, Massachusetts leveraged its strong seafaring 
tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, and access to the oceans to 
make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s.[59] 
Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket 
had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending 
for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific 
waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, 
but at the same time many whalers refitted out as privateers against the 
British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. 
Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their 
hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. 
Investment decisions and financing arrangements were set up so that managers 
of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but 
retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a 
result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their 
own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled 
diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860 
kerosene replaced whale oil—concurrent with the devastation of the whaling 
fleet by Confederate commerce raiders—and the entrepreneurs shifted to 
manufacturing.[60] On March 15, 1820, Maine was separated from Massachusetts 
and entered the Union as the 23rd State as a result of the enactment of 
the Missouri Compromise. Horace Mann made the state system of schools the 
national model. The Commonwealth made its mark in Washington with such 
political leaders as Daniel Webster and Charles Sumner. Building on the 
many activist Congregational churches, abolitionism flourished. William 
Lloyd Garrison was the outstanding spokesperson, though many "cotton Whig" 
mill owners complained that the agitation was bad for their strong business 
ties to southern cotton planters. The Congregationalists remained dominant 
in rural areas, but, in the cities, a new religious sensibility had replaced 
their strait-laced Calvinism. By 1826, reported Harriet Beecher Stowe: 
All the literary men of Massachusetts were Unitarians. All the trustees 
and professors of Harvard College were Unitarians. All the élite of wealth 
and fashion crowded Unitarian churches. The judges on the bench were Unitarian, 
giving decisions by which the peculiar features of church organization, 
so carefully ordained by the Pilgrim fathers, had been nullified. Some 
of the most important writers and thinkers of this time came from Massachusetts. 
Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson are well known today for their 
contributions to American thought. Part of an intellectual movement known 
as Transcendentalism, they emphasized the importance of the natural world 
to humanity and were also part of the abolitionist call. The Know Nothing 
movement formed a new party in 1854 and captured almost all the seats in 
the legislature, the state government, and many cities. Historian John 
Mulkern finds the new party was populist and highly democratic, hostile 
to wealth, elites, and to expertise, and deeply suspicious of outsiders 
especially Catholics. The new party's voters were concentrated in the rapidly 
growing industrial towns, where Yankee workers faced direct competition 
with new Irish immigrants. Whereas the Whig party was strongest in high 
income districts, the Know Nothing electorate was strongest in the poor 
districts. They voted out the traditional upper-class closed political 
leadership class, especially the lawyers and merchants. In their stead 
they elected working class men, farmers, and a large number of teachers 
and ministers. Replacing the moneyed elite were men who seldom owned $10,000 
in property.[61] In national perspective, the most aggressive and innovative 
legislation came out of Massachusetts, Both in terms of nativism and in 
terms of reforms. Historian Stephen Taylor says that in addition to nativist 
legislation: It passed legislation to regulate railroads, insurance companies, 
and public utilities. It funded free textbooks for the public schools, 
and raised the appropriations for local libraries and for the school for 
the blind. Purification of Massachusetts against divisive social evils 
was a high priority. The legislature set up the state's first reform school 
for juvenile delinquents, while trying to block the importation of supposedly 
subversive government documents and academic books from Europe. It upgraded 
the legal status of wives, giving them more property rights and more rights 
in divorce courts. It passed harsh penalties on speakeasies, gambling houses 
and bordellos, It passed prohibition legislation with penalties that were 
so stiff—such as six months in prison for serving one glass of beer—that 
juries refused to convict. Many of the reforms were quite expensive; State 
spending rose 45% on top of a 50% hike in annual taxes on cities and towns. 
The extravagance angered the taxpayers; few Know Nothings were reelected 
so the brief two-year experiment ended.[63] The highest priority included 
attacks on the civil rights of Irish Catholic immigrants. State courts 
lost the power to process applications for citizenship; the public schools 
had to require compulsory daily reading of the Protestant Bible (which 
the nativists were sure would transform the Catholic children). The governor 
disbanded the Irish militias, and replaced Catholics holding state jobs 
with Protestants. It failed to reach the two-thirds vote needed to pass 
a state constitutional amendment to restrict voting and office holding 
to men who had resided in Massachusetts for at least 21 years. The legislature 
then called on Congress to raise the requirement for naturalization from 
five years to 21 years, but Congress never acted.[64] The most dramatic 
move by the Know Nothing legislature was to appoint an investigating committee 
designed to prove widespread sexual immorality under way in Catholic convents. 
The press had a field day following the story, especially when it was discovered 
that the key reformer was using committee funds to pay for a prostitute. 
The legislature shut down its committee, ejected the reformer, and saw 
its investigation became a laughing stock.[65][66][67] In the years leading 
up to the Civil War, Massachusetts was a center of social progressivism, 
Transcendentalism, and abolitionist activity. Horace Mann made the state 
system of schools the national model.[68][69] Two prominent abolitionists 
from the Commonwealth were William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. 
Garrison founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832, and helped 
change perceptions on slavery. The movement increased antagonism over the 
issues of slavery, resulting in anti-abolitionist riots in Massachusetts 
between 1835 and 1837.[70] The works of abolitionists contributed to the 
eventual actions of the Commonwealth during the Civil War. Henry David 
Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson made major contributions to American thought.[71] 
Members of the Transcendentalism movement, they emphasized the importance 
of the natural world and emotion to humanity.[71] Although significant 
opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts, resulting 
in anti-abolitionist riots between 1835 and 1837,[72] opposition to slavery 
gradually increased in the next few decades.[73][74] Famed abolitionist 
John Brown moved to the ideologically progressive town of Springfield in 
1846. It was there that Brown first became a militant anti-slavery proponent. 
In Springfield and in Boston, Brown met the connections that would both 
influence him, (Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth in Springfield,) 
and later fund his efforts, (Simon Sanborn and Amos Adams Lawrence in Boston,) 
in Bleeding Kansas and John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. In 1850, Brown 
founded his first militant, anti-slavery organization – The League of the 
Gileadites – in Springfield, to protect escaped slaves from 1850's Fugitive 
Slave Act. Massachusetts was a hotbed of abolitionism – particularly the 
progressive cities of Boston and Springfield – and contributed to subsequent 
actions of the state during the Civil War. Massachusetts was among the 
first states to respond to President Lincoln's call for troops. Massachusetts 
was the first state to recruit, train and arm a black regiment with white 
officers, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Massachusetts was 
the first state to recruit, train, and arm a Black regiment with White 
officers, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.[75] The Robert Gould 
Shaw Memorial in Boston Common contains a relief depicting the 54th regiment.[76] 
Much of the Union's weaponry for the Civil War was produced in Springfield, 
at the Springfield Armory. Following the Civil War, thousands of immigrants 
from Canada and Europe continued to settle in the major cities of Massachusetts, 
attracted by employment in the state's ever-expanding factories.[77] The 
state also became a leader in education and innovation through this period, 
particularly in the Boston area. In 1891 and 1895, the sports of basketball 
and volleyball—both now Olympic sports, popular worldwide—were invented 
in the Western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke, respectively. 
Today, Springfield is home to the international Basketball Hall of Fame. 
Holyoke is home to the international Volleyball Hall of Fame.[78] In the 
1890s—largely due to the presence of the Springfield Armory, which employed 
many skilled, mechanical workers—Greater Springfield became the United 
States' first major center of automobile and motorcycle innovation. The 
United States' first gasoline-powered automobile company, the Duryea Motor 
Wagon Company, was founded in Chicopee in 1893. The first American motorcycle 
company, the Indian Motorcycle Company, was founded in Springfield in 1901. 
Knox Automobile produced the world's first motorized fire engines in Springfield 
in 1906.[79] Although the basic rail system was in place by 1860, the railways 
continued to make major improvements in tracks, signals, bridging, and 
facilities. With steel came heavier trains and more powerful locomotives. 
In the 1880s the Boston & Albany Railroad invested heavily in its physical 
facilities, including the construction of over 30 new passenger stations. 
Famed Boston architect H. H. Richardson did much of the design work.[80] 
Passenger transportation was revolutionized by the electric trolley. Thomas 
Davenport demonstrated the feasibility of the electric railway in Springfield 
in the late 1870s. In 1889 the city's first line was constructed and by 
1905 Springfield had more track than New York City. The lines provided 
rapid, cheap transportation for farm produce and workers, created land 
booms in suburbia, and permitted Sunday outings in the country. They were 
highly profitable and the base of numerous fortunes.[81] Massachusetts 
entered the 20th century with a strong industrial economy. Despite a lack 
of agricultural progress, the economy prospered between 1900 and 1919. 
Factories throughout the Commonwealth produced goods varying from paper 
to metals. Boston, in the year 1900, was still the second most important 
port in the United States, as well as the most valuable U.S. port in terms 
of its fish market. By 1908, however, the value of the port dropped considerably 
due to competition. Population growth during this period, which was aided 
by immigration from abroad, helped in urbanization and forced a change 
in the ethnic make-up of the Commonwealth. The largely industrial economy 
of Massachusetts began to falter, however, due to the dependence of factory 
communities upon the production of one or two goods. External low-wage 
competition, coupled with other factors of the Great Depression in later 
years, led to the collapse of the state's two main industries: shoes and 
textiles. Between 1921 and 1949 the failure of those industries resulted 
in rampant unemployment and the urban decay of once-prosperous industrial 
centers which would persist for several decades. The industrial economy 
began a decline in the early 20th century with the exodus of many manufacturing 
companies. By the 1920s competition from the South and Midwest, followed 
by the Great Depression, led to the collapse of the three main industries 
in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and mechanized transportation.[82] 
This decline would continue into the latter half of the century; between 
1950 and 1979, the number of Bay Staters involved in textile manufacturing 
declined from 264,000 to 63,000.[83] The Springfield Armory, the United 
States' Military's munitions producer since 1777, was controversially shutdown 
by the Pentagon in 1968. This spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from 
Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during 
the last 40 years of the 20th century.[84] In Eastern Massachusetts, following 
World War II, the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry 
into a service and high-tech based economy.[85] Government contracts, private 
investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial 
climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. Suburbanization 
flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high-technology 
companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions 
of higher education.[86] On Thursday, October 1, 1903, the city of Boston 
made history by hosting the inaugural World Series at the Huntington Avenue 
Grounds. The Boston Red Sox won the best-of-nine series and launched into 
a baseball dynasty in the following years by capturing five championships 
in fifteen years behind Hall of Famer Babe Ruth. Even before the Great 
Depression struck the United States, Massachusetts was experiencing economic 
problems. The crash of the Commonwealth's major industries led to declining 
population in factory towns. The Boston metropolitan area became one of 
the slowest-growing areas in the United States between 1920 and 1950. Internal 
migration within the Commonwealth, however, was altered by the Great Depression. 
In the wake of economic woes, people moved to the metropolitan area of 
Boston looking for jobs, only to find high unemployment and dismal conditions. 
In the depressed situation that predominated in Boston during this era, 
racial tension manifested itself in gang warfare at times, notably with 
clashes between the Irish and Italians. Massachusetts also endured class 
conflict during this period. In the 1912 general strike in Lawrence, almost 
all of the town's mills were forced to shut down as a result of strife 
over wages that sustained only poverty. The Commonwealth was confronted 
with issues of worker conditions and wages. For example, when the legislature 
decreed that women and children could work only 50 hours per week, employers 
cut wages proportionally. Eventually, the demands of the Lawrence strikers 
were heeded, and a pay increase was made. The economic and social turmoil 
in Massachusetts marked the beginning of a change in the Commonwealth's 
way of functioning. Politics helped to encourage stability among social 
groups by elevating members of various ranks in society, as well as ethnic 
groups, to influential posts. The two major industries of Massachusetts, 
shoes and textiles, had declined in a way that even the post-World War 
II economic boom could not reverse. Thus, the Commonwealth's economy was 
ripe for change as the post-war years dawned. World War II precipitated 
great changes in the economy of Massachusetts, which in turn led to changes 
in society. The aftermath of WWII created a global economy that was focused 
upon the interests of the United States, both militarily and in relation 
to business. The domestic economy in the United States was altered by government 
procurement policies focused on defense. In the years following WWII, Massachusetts 
was transformed from a factory-based economy to one based on services and 
technology. During WWII, the U.S. government had built facilities that 
they leased, and in the post-war years sold, to defense contractors. Such 
facilities contributed to an economy focused on creating specialized defense 
goods. That form of economy prospered as a result of the Cold War, the 
Vietnam War, and the Korean War. In the ensuing years, government contracts, 
private investment, and research facilities helped to create a modern industry, 
which reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. All of these 
economic changes encouraged suburbanization and the formation of a new 
generation of well-assimilated and educated middle-class workers. At the 
same time, suburbanization and urban decay highlighted differences between 
various social groups, leading to a renewal of racial tension. Boston, 
a paragon of the problems in Massachusetts cities, experienced numerous 
challenges that led to racial problems. The problems facing urban centers 
included declining population, middle-class flight, departure of industry, 
high unemployment, rising taxes, low property values, and competition among 
ethnic groups. The Kennedy family was prominent in Massachusetts politics 
in the 20th century. Children of businessman and ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy 
Sr. included John F. Kennedy, who was a senator and US president before 
his assassination in 1963, Robert F. Kennedy, who was a senator, US attorney 
general and presidential candidate before his assassination in 1968, Ted 
Kennedy, a senator from 1962 until his death in 2009,[87] and Eunice Kennedy 
Shriver, a co-founder of the Special Olympics.[88] The famous Kennedy Compound 
is located at Hyannisport on Cape Cod.[89] Over the past 20–30 years, Massachusetts 
has cemented its place in the country as a center of education (especially 
higher education) and high-tech industry, including the biotechnology and 
information technology sectors. With better-than-average schools overall 
and many elite universities, the area was well placed to take advantage 
of the technology-based economy of the 1990s. The rebound from the decay 
of manufacturing into the high-technology sector is often referred to as 
the Massachusetts Miracle. The Commonwealth had several notable citizens 
in federal government in the 1980s, including almost presidential hopeful 
and Senator Ted Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill. This legislative 
influence allowed the Commonwealth to receive federal highway funding for 
the $14.6 billion Boston Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Known colloquially 
as "the Big Dig", it was, at the time, the most expensive federal highway 
project ever approved. Designed to relieve some of the traffic problems 
of the poorly planned city, it was approved in 1987, and effectively completed 
in 2005. The project was controversial due to massive budget overruns, 
repeated construction delays, water leaks in the new tunnels in 2004, and 
a ceiling collapse in 2006 that killed a Bostonian. Several Massachusetts 
politicians have run for the office of President of the United States in 
this period, won the primary elections, and gone on to contest the national 
elections. These include Michael Dukakis, who was defeated by George H. 
W. Bush in 1988; John Kerry, who was defeated by George W. Bush in 2004; 
and Mitt Romney, who was defeated by Barack Obama in 2012. In 2002 the 
Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal involving local priests became 
public. The Archdiocese of Boston was found to have knowingly moved priests 
who sexually molested children from parish to parish and to have covered 
up abuse. The revelations caused the resignation of the archbishop, Cardinal 
Bernard Law, and resulted in a $85 million settlement with the victims. 
With the large Irish and Italian Catholic populations in Boston, this was 
a big concern. The diocese, under financial pressure, closed many of its 
churches. In some churches, parishioners camped out in the churches to 
protest and block closure. On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme 
Judicial Court (SJC) decided that the Commonwealth could not deny marriage 
rights to gay couples under the state constitution. On February 4, 2004, 
the SJC followed that ruling with a statement saying that allegedly separate 
but equal civil unions, implemented as of late in Vermont, would not pass 
constitutional muster and that only full gay marriage rights met constitutional 
guarantees. On May 17, 2004, the ruling took effect and thousands of gay 
and lesbian couples across the Commonwealth entered into marriage. Opponents 
of gay marriage subsequently pushed for an amendment to the state constitution 
that would allow the state to deny marriage rights to gay couples. It was 
necessary for the amendment to be approved by at least 1/4 of the members 
present in two consecutive legislative sessions of the Massachusetts legislature, 
and to receive majority support in a popular referendum. It passed the 
first legislative session, but was defeated in the second session, receiving 
less than 1/4 of the votes of the legislators present. As public opinion 
polls currently[when?] indicate majority support for gay marriage among 
the people of the Commonwealth, it is likely that the issue is settled 
in Massachusetts.[citation needed] Increased white-collar jobs have driven 
suburban sprawl, but the consequent effects of sprawl have been lessened 
by regulations on land use and zoning, as well as an emphasis on "smart 
growth". In recent years, the Commonwealth has lost population as high 
housing costs have driven many away from Massachusetts. The Boston area 
is the third most expensive housing market in the country. Over the last 
several years there has been a net outflow of about 19,000 people from 
the Commonwealth.[citation needed][needs update] In 2006, the Massachusetts 
legislature enacted the first plan in the United States to provide all 
Commonwealth citizens with universal health insurance coverage, using a 
variety of private insurance providers. Insurance coverage for low-income 
individuals is paid for with tax revenues, and higher income people who 
don't have health insurance are required to purchase it. (The health insurance 
market is publicly regulated, so, at least in Massachusetts, no one can 
be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or be forced to pay 
exorbitant rates.) The implementation of Commonwealth Care, the new universal 
coverage law, is proceeding, as of 2007. Two pressure cooker bombs exploded 
near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 at around 
2:49 pm EDT. The explosions killed three civilians and injured an estimated 
264 others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) later identified 
the suspects as brothers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The ensuing 
manhunt ended on April 19 when thousands of law enforcement officers searched 
a 20-block area of nearby Watertown. Dzhokhar later said that he was motivated 
by extremist Islamic beliefs and learned to build explosive devices from 
an online magazine of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. On November 8, 2016, 
Massachusetts voted in favor of The Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization 
Initiative, also known as Question 4. [90] It was included on the United 
States presidential election, 2016 ballot in Massachusetts as an indirect 
initiated state statute. [91] In 1987, the state received federal funding 
for the Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Known as "the Big Dig", it was at 
the time the biggest federal highway project ever approved.[92] The project 
included making the Central Artery a tunnel under downtown Boston, in addition 
to the re-routing of several other major highways.[93] Often controversial, 
with numerous claims of graft and mismanagement, and with its initial price 
tag of $2.5 billion increasing to a final tally of over $15 billion, the 
Big Dig has nonetheless changed the face of Downtown Boston.[92] It has 
connected areas that were once divided by elevated highway, (much of the 
raised old Central Artery was replaced with the Rose Kennedy Greenway) 
and improved traffic conditions along a number of routes.[92][93] The history 
of the boundaries of Massachusetts is somewhat complex and covers several 
centuries. Land grants made to various groups of early colonists, mergers 
and secessions, and settlements of various boundary disputes all had a 
major influence on the modern definition of the Commonwealth. Disputes 
arose due to both overlapping grants, inaccurate surveys (creating a difference 
between where the border "should" be and where markers are placed on the 
ground). Having loyal settlers actually on the ground also partially determined 
which portions of their vast claims early groups held on to. In 1607, the 
Plymouth Company was granted a coastal charter for all coastal territory 
up to a certain distance from the eastern shoreline of North America, from 
38°N to 45°N. The northern boundary was thus slightly farther north than 
the current Maine-New Brunswick border, and the southern border intentionally 
overlapped with the Virginia Company of London ("London Company") from 
the 38th parallel (near the current Maryland-Virginia border) to the 41st 
(near the current Connecticut-New York border in Long Island Sound). Neither 
colony was allowed to settle within 100 miles of the other. The Plymouth 
Company's patent fell into disuse after the failure of the Popham Colony 
in what is now Maine. In the meantime, the Plymouth Colony had settled 
outside the territory of the London company due to navigational difficulties. 
The Plymouth Company was reorganized as the Plymouth Council for New England, 
and given a new royal sea-to-sea charter for all North American territory 
from 40° North (just east between present-day Philadelphia and Trenton, 
New Jersey) and 48° N (thus including all of modern-day New Brunswick, 
Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island). The Plymouth Colony was granted 
land patents between 1621 and 1630 from the Council to legitimize its settlement, 
though it maintained political independence under the Mayflower Compact. 
The Plymouth Council for New England made sub grants to various entities 
before it was surrendered to the crown in 1635 and ceased to operate as 
a corporate entity. The Sheffield Patent granted the use of Cape Ann to 
members of the Plymouth Colony and the Dorchester Company. The fishing 
colony there failed, but led to the foundation of Salem, Massachusetts. 
The bankrupt Dorchester Company's lands were reissued as part of a larger 
grant to the Massachusetts Bay Company. Massachusetts Bay obtained in 1628/29 
a sea-to-sea patent for all lands and islands from three miles north of 
the Merrimack River (roughly the current Massachusetts-New Hampshire border), 
to three miles south of the extents of the Charles River and Massachusetts 
Bay. The Charles River starts near Boston (in the middle of the territory) 
but flows in a circuitous path southeast to near present-day Bellingham, 
Massachusetts, which is on the modern Rhode Island border. Land belonging 
to any other colonies as of November 3, 1629, was excluded from the grant. 
The boundary between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony was 
settled in 1639, and today forms most of the border between Norfolk County, 
Plymouth County, and Bristol County. In 1622, Sir Ferdinando Gorges obtained 
a patent for the Province of Maine, lands north of Massachusetts Bay border 
near the Merrimack River, up to the Kennebec River. This was soon split 
at the Piscataqua River, with the southern portion eventually becoming 
the Province of New Hampshire. The northern portion came under Massachusetts 
Bay control in the 1640s. In 1664, James, Duke of York obtained a charter 
for land from the Kennebec to the St. Croix River, joining it to his Province 
of New York. New Hampshire was joined with Massachusetts Bay from 1641–1679 
and during the dominion period (1686–1692). The 1629 charter of Massachusetts 
Bay was canceled by a judgment of the high court of chancery of England, 
June 18, 1684.[94] The Province of Massachusetts Bay was formed in 1691–92 
by the British monarchs William and Mary. It included the Massachusetts 
Bay Colony, the Plymouth Colony, the Province of Maine (including the eastern 
territories that had been part of Province of New York), and Nova Scotia 
(which included present-day New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island). Dukes 
County, Massachusetts (Martha's Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands) and 
Nantucket were also transferred from the Province of New York. In 1696, 
Nova Scotia was restored to France (who called it Acadia), but the northern 
and eastern boundaries of Maine would not be fixed until the 1840s. The 
Province of New Hampshire received a separate royal charter in 1679, but 
the language defining the southern border with Massachusetts Bay referenced 
the Merrimack River in an ambiguous way: The result was disagreement over 
the northern boundary of Massachusetts that was often ignored by its governors 
because in those years they governed both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. 
Massachusetts claimed land west of the Merrimack as calculated from the 
headwaters of the river (which early colonial officials claimed to be the 
outlet of Lake Winnipesaukee in modern-day Franklin, New Hampshire), but 
New Hampshire claimed that its southern boundary was the line of latitude 
three miles north of the river's mouth. The parties appealed to King George 
II of England, who ordered the dispute be settled by agreement between 
the parties. Commissioners from both colonies met at Hampton, New Hampshire 
in 1737, but were unable to reach agreement. In 1740, the King settled 
the dispute in a surprising manner, by declaring "that the northern boundary 
of Massachusetts be a similar curve line pursuing the course of the Merrimack 
River at three miles distance on the north side thereof, beginning at the 
Atlantic Ocean and ending at a point due north of a place called Pautucket 
Falls [now Lowell, Massachusetts], and by a straight line drawn from thence 
west till it meets his Majesty's other governments." This ruling favored 
New Hampshire and actually gave it a strip of land 50 miles beyond its 
claim. Massachusetts declined to do a physical survey, so New Hampshire 
laid markers on its own.[94] In 1641, the Plymouth Colony (at the time 
separate from the Massachusetts Bay Colony) purchased from the Indians 
a large tract of land which today includes the northern half of East Providence 
(from Watchemoket to Rumford), Rehoboth, Massachusetts, Seekonk, Massachusetts, 
and part of Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1645, John Brown of Plymouth bought 
a considerably smaller piece of land from the Indians, which today comprises 
the southern part of East Providence (Riverside), Barrington, Rhode Island, 
and a small part of Swansea, Massachusetts. Finally, in 1661, Plymouth 
completed the "North Purchase", from which Cumberland, Rhode Island, Attleboro, 
Massachusetts and North Attleborough, Massachusetts were later to be formed. 
The whole territory, which also included parts of modern Somerset, Massachusetts, 
and Warren, Bristol, and Woonsocket in Rhode Island, was at the time called 
"Rehoboth". The center of "Old Rehoboth" was within the borders of modern 
East Providence, Rhode Island. By the 1650s, Massachusetts Bay, the Colony 
of Rhode Island (not yet unified with Providence) the Connecticut Colony, 
and two different land companies all claimed what is now Washington County, 
Rhode Island, what was referred to as Narragansett Country. Massachusetts 
Bay had conquered Block Island in 1636 in retaliation for the murder of 
a trader at the start of the Pequot War, and Massachusetts families settled 
there in 1661. The Plymouth Colony's land grant specified its western boundary 
as the Narragansett River;[95] it is unclear whether this referred to the 
Pawcatuck River (on the current Connecticut-Rhode Island Border) or Narragansett 
Bay (much farther east, near the modern-day Rhode Island-Massachusetts 
border). In 1663, Rhode Island obtained a patent extending its territory 
in certain places three miles east of Narragansett Bay. In 1664, a royal 
commission appointed by King Charles II of England denied the claims of 
Massachusetts and Plymouth to land west of Narragansett Bay, granting jurisdiction 
to the newly unified Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations 
(pending resolution of the claims of Connecticut). However, the claims 
of Plymouth to all lands east of Narragansett Bay were upheld, and so the 
border was set in practice.[95] The 1691 charter unified Massachusetts 
Bay with Plymouth Colony (including Rehoboth) and said that the combined 
territory would extend as far south as "Our Collonyes of Rhode Island Connecticut 
and the Marragansett Countrey"[94] (Narragansett Country). In 1693 the 
monarchs William and Mary issued a patent extending Rhode Island's territory 
to three miles "east and northeast" of Narragansett Bay, conflicting with 
the claims of Plymouth Colony.[96] This enlarged the area of conflict between 
Rhode Island and the Province of Massachusetts. The issue was not addressed 
until 1740, when Rhode Island appealed to King George II of England. Royal 
commissioners from both colonies were appointed in 1741, and decided in 
favor of Rhode Island. The King affirmed the settlement in 1746 after appeals 
from both colonies. The royally approved three-mile boundary moved several 
towns on the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay (east of the mouth of the 
Blackstone River) from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. This included what 
is now Bristol County, Rhode Island (the towns of Barrington, Bristol, 
and Warren), along with Tiverton, Little Compton, and Cumberland, Rhode 
Island (which was carved out of Attleborough, Massachusetts). East Freetown, 
which was left on the Massachusetts side of the border, was officially 
purchased by Freetown, Massachusetts, from Tiverton in 1747. Commissioners 
from Rhode Island had the new boundary surveyed in 1746 (without consulting 
Massachusetts), based on six reference points, from each of which a distance 
was measured 3 miles inland. Massachusetts accepted this border until 1791, 
when its own surveyors found that the Rhode Island surveyors had "encroached" 
on Massachusetts territory by a few hundred feet in certain places. (Rhode 
Island disagreed.) Of particular concern was the boundary near Fall River, 
Massachusetts, which would later fall in the middle of a thickly settled 
area of high taxable value.[95] In 1812, after a court case involving the 
Massachusetts border, the western half of Old Rehoboth was set off as a 
separate township called Seekonk, Massachusetts, leaving the eastern part 
as Rehoboth, Massachusetts. Old Rehoboth's town center now became the heart 
of Old Seekonk. In 1832, Rhode Island filed a case with the U.S. Supreme 
Court, but after six years of deliberations, it was dismissed. The court 
decided it did not have the jurisdiction to rule on the matter.[97] In 
1844 and 1845, commissioners were once again authorized to survey and mark 
the boundary from Wrentham to the Atlantic Ocean, to address the inaccuracies 
of the 1746 survey. A report was issued in 1848, but the Massachusetts 
legislature refused to agree to the proposed solution, after being petitioned 
by residents of Fall River.[95][98] Both states filed bills of equity with 
the Supreme Court in 1852, and after more surveying and negotiation, a 
decree was issued on December 16, 1861. On March 1, 1862, when the Supreme 
Court ruling became effective,[94] the western part of Old Seekonk (all 
of which was on the eastern shore of the Blackstone River) was ceded by 
Massachusetts and incorporated as East Providence, Rhode Island. Part of 
North Providence, Rhode Island was also combined with the former Pawtucket, 
Massachusetts and a sliver of Seekonk to form the modern Pawtucket, Rhode 
Island. A small amount of land was also added to Westport, Massachusetts.[98] 
The southern boundary of Fall River, Massachusetts was moved from Columbia 
Street to State Avenue, expanding its territory. The Supreme Court made 
these adjustments not in conformance with King George's instructions, but 
to unify the thickly settled areas of Pawtucket and Fall River under the 
jurisdiction of a single state.[95] The 1861-2 boundary was slightly redefined 
in 1897, using stone markers instead of high-water levels. The physical 
survey was performed in 1898, and ratified by both states. In 1710–11, 
commissioners from the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations 
and the Province of Massachusetts Bay agreed that the stake planted in 
1642 by Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey at Burnt Swamp Corner on 
the plains of Wrentham, Massachusetts, said to be at 41°55′N and thought 
to be three miles south of the southernmost part of the Charles River, 
would represent the starting point for the border. The line extending west 
from the stake was surveyed in 1719, but inaccurately.[94] In 1748, Rhode 
Island appointed a commission to survey the line from the stake to the 
Connecticut border, but Massachusetts failed to send a delegation. The 
surveyors could not find the 1642 stake, and so marked a line from three 
miles south, by their reckoning, of "Poppatolish Pond" (presumably Populatic 
Pond, near Norfolk Airpark in Norfolk, Massachusetts). It was discovered 
that the Woodward and Saffrey stake was considerably farther south than 
three miles from the Charles River.[94] Rhode Island claimed that its commissioners 
had made a mistake in basing the border on the 1642 stake, and in 1832 
filed a case with the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1846, the 
Court ruled in favor of Massachusetts. The same surveyors that marked the 
eastern boundary the previous year then marked the northern boundary, filing 
their report in 1848. Rhode Island accepted the markings as the legal boundary 
on the condition that Massachusetts do the same, but the Commonwealth failed 
to do so until 1865. But by that time, Rhode Island claimed that the 1861 
Supreme Court case had changed matters so much as to render the "line of 
1848" unacceptable. The town of Springfield was settled in 1636 by William 
Pynchon (as Agawam Plantation), encompassing the modern towns of Westfield, 
Southwick, West Springfield, Agawam, Chicopee, Holyoke, Wilbraham, Ludlow 
and Longmeadow in Massachusetts, and Enfield, Suffield, Somers, and East 
Windsor in Connecticut. It was connected to the Atlantic and major avenues 
of trade by the Connecticut River, which ran past Hartford and through 
the territory of the Connecticut Colony. Initially, Springfield's founders 
attended the Connecticut Colony meetings held in Hartford; however, relations 
quickly soured between the strong-minded leaders of each settlement, the 
iconoclastic William Pynchon of Springfield and Puritan Reverend Thomas 
Hooker of Hartford. Pynchon proved to be a very savvy businessperson, and 
his settlement quickly eclipsed the Connecticut towns in trade with the 
Natives. In 1640, during a grain shortage, Hooker and other Connecticut 
leaders gave Pynchon permission to buy grain for them; however, because 
the Natives were refusing to sell at reasonable prices, Pynchon refused 
the Natives' offers. Pynchon's perceived greediness infuriated Hartford; 
however, Pynchon explained that he was merely trying to keep market prices 
steady so that colonists need not pay exorbitant amounts in the future. 
Infuriated, Hartford sent famed Indian-killer Captain John Mason up to 
Pynchon's settlement "with money in one hand and a sword in the other." 
Mason threatened the Natives by Springfield with war if they did not sell 
grain at the prices he demanded. Pynchon was disgusted by this behavior, 
as he had enjoyed a congenial relationship with the Natives – and Mason's 
threats made him look bad. Mason believed that Natives were untrustworthy, 
and thus exchanged some "hard words" with Pynchon before leaving Springfield. 
After Mason left, settlers of Agawam Plantation rallied in support of Pynchon. 
In 1640, they voted to annex their settlement – with arguably the best 
position on the Connecticut River, near Enfield Falls, surrounded by fertile 
farmland and friendly Natives – to the faraway government in Boston, rather 
than the nearby government in Hartford.[99] (Springfield had been settled 
by permission of the Massachusetts General Court, so Massachusetts assumed 
it had jurisdiction over Pynchon's settlement anyway; however, they renamed 
it Springfield in Pynchon's honor). In 1641, Connecticut founded a trading 
post at Woronoke, which was in what was strongly considered to be Massachusetts 
territory (now Westfield).[100] Massachusetts complained, and Connecticut 
demanded that Springfield pay taxes to support the upkeep of the fort at 
the mouth of the river, in the Saybrook Colony. Springfield's magistrate, 
William Pynchon, would have been amenable to the tax if Springfield could 
have representation at the fort at Saybrook; however, Connecticut refused 
Springfield's request for representation. Pynchon appealed to Boston, which 
responded to Connecticut by threatening to charge Connecticut traders for 
the use of the port of Boston, on which they were almost completely dependent.[99] 
To assert its sovereignty on the northern Connecticut River, the Massachusetts 
Bay Colony sent Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey to survey and mark 
the boundary. They accidentally marked the boundary with Rhode Island significantly 
farther than the royally decreed three miles south of the southernmost 
part of the Charles River. Instead of traversing the territory of Massachusetts 
by land, they sailed around and up the Connecticut River, calculating the 
same latitude at which they had misplaced the stake on the Rhode Island 
border. This compounded the error even further, resulting in a four to 
seven mile discrepancy between where the border should have been and where 
it was marked, and awarding more territory to Massachusetts Bay than it 
had been granted by its charter. Though it was suspicious of this survey, 
Connecticut would not even receive a charter until 1662, and so the dispute 
would lie dormant for several decades.[100] The towns of Woodstock, Suffield, 
Enfield, and Somers were incorporated by Massachusetts, and mainly settled 
by migrants from the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth Colonies. In 1686, 
Suffield and Enfield (incorporated in Massachusetts) were in a dispute 
over town territory with Windsor and Simsbury (incorporated in Connecticut, 
and which then included Granby). Massachusetts did not agree to a re-survey, 
so Connecticut hired John Butler and William Whitney to do the job. They 
found the southernmost part of the Charles River, and then traveled by 
land westward. Their 1695 report found that the 1642 line had been drawn 
too far south. Consternation ensued. Abortive pleas to England were made 
in 1702. In 1713 a joint commission awarded control of Springfield-area 
towns to Massachusetts (without consulting the residents of those towns), 
compensating Connecticut with an equal amount of land further north. But 
the inhabitants of the Connecticut River border towns petitioned to be 
part of Connecticut in 1724, perhaps due to high taxes in Massachusetts 
or the greater civil liberties granted in the Connecticut charter.[101] 
In 1747, Woodstock petitioned the General Assembly of Connecticut to be 
admitted to the colony, on the grounds that the transfer of lands from 
Massachusetts in 1713 had not been authorized by The Crown. Suffield and 
Enfield soon followed, and the legislature accepted them in May 1749, and 
declared the 1713 compromise null and void. Massachusetts continued to 
assert sovereignty in practice.[94][101] In 1770, Southwick, Massachusetts 
was granted independence from Westfield, Massachusetts. In May 1774, residents 
in southern Southwick also petitioned Connecticut for entry and secession 
from northern Southwick, on the grounds they were south of the royally 
approved border of the Massachusetts Bay Colony (three miles south of the 
Charles River). The part west of Congamond Lake joined Simsbury, and the 
part east of the lake joined Suffield.[101] In 1791 and 1793, commissioners 
were sent from both states to survey the boundary line yet again, but were 
unable to agree until a compromise was reached in 1803–04. Massachusetts 
accepted the nullification of the 1713 compromise and the loss of the border 
towns, but regained the portion of southern Southwick west of the lake. 
This resulted in the modern boundary with Connecticut, which is a relatively 
straight east-west line, except for the "Southwick jog", a small, mostly 
rectangular piece of Massachusetts surrounded by Connecticut on three sides.[101] 
Massachusetts claimed all territory to the Pacific Ocean, based on its 
1629 charter, but the Province of New York claimed the west bank of the 
Connecticut River (passing through Springfield, Massachusetts) as its eastern 
boundary, based on 1664 and 1674 grants to the Duke of York. In 1773, the 
western boundary of Massachusetts was settled with the New York in its 
present location, and surveyed in 1787, following the line of magnetic 
north at the time. The starting point was a 1731 marker at the Connecticut–New 
York border, 20 miles inland from the Hudson River.[94] Massachusetts relinquished 
sovereignty over its western lands (east of the Great Lakes) to New York 
in the Treaty of Hartford in 1786, but retained the economic right to buy 
the Boston Ten Townships from Native Americans before any other party. 
These purchase rights were sold to private individuals in 1788. The Commonwealth 
also ceded its claim to far western lands (Michigan and all other land 
to the Pacific Ocean) to Congress in 1785. In 1853, a small triangle of 
land in the southwest corner of the Commonwealth, known as Boston Corners, 
was ceded from Mount Washington, Massachusetts to Ancram, New York. The 
mountainous terrain made it difficult for Massachusetts authorities to 
enforce the law there, making the neighborhood a haven for outlaws and 
prize-fighters. Local residents petitioned for the transfer to allow New 
York authorities to clean up the hamlet. From 1658 to 1820 Maine was an 
integral part of Massachusetts. In 1820, Maine was separated from Massachusetts 
(with its consent) and admitted into the Union as an independent state, 
as part of the Missouri Compromise. (See the History of Maine for information 
about its boundaries, including disputes with New Hampshire and Canadian
