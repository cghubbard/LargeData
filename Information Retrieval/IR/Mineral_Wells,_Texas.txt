Palo Pinto County and in Mineral Wells. It can house up to 2,100 prisoners.

March 4, 2013 the Texas Senate Senate Finance Committee voted 11-4 to close 
the correctional facility. Mike Allen, the mayor of Mineral Wells, criticized 
the closure, saying "We'll lose right at over 300 jobs, and 300 jobs in 
a community of 17,000 ... is devastating. This means a lot to this community."[5] 
John Whitmire, the head of the Texas Senate Criminal Justice Committee, 
said "We're sitting on about 12,000 empty [prison] beds, so it just makes 
good business sense ... that we not operate it, and we take those savings 
and plow them back into additional public safety programs."[5] The United 
States Postal Service operates the Mineral Wells Post Office. Zip codes
