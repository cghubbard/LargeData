Ernest Sargent Barnard (July 17, 1874 – March 27, 1931) was the second 
President of the American League, serving from 1927 until his death in 
1931. Born in West Columbia, West Virginia, he later resided in Delaware, 
Ohio. He graduated from Otterbein College in 1895, and became football 
and baseball coach there until 1898. Moving to Columbus, Ohio, he became 
secretary of the local Builders Exchange, and coached football at Ohio

in 1917. Realizing he'd made a mistake, Dunn brought Barnard back to the 
team in 1918. Barnard stayed on as president after Dunn's death in 1922,

term on December 9, 1930, but died suddenly three months later just prior 
to an examination at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Coincidentally,
