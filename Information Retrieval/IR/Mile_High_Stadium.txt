Mile High Stadium (originally Bears Stadium) was an outdoor multi-purpose 
stadium in the western United States, located in Denver, Colorado. It was 
built 68 years ago in 1948 for the Denver Bears baseball team,[5] which 
was a member of the Western League during its construction. Originally 
designed as a baseball venue,[5] the stadium was expanded in later years 
to accommodate the addition of a professional football team to the city, 
the Denver Broncos, as well as to improve Denver's hopes of landing a Major 
League Baseball team. Although the stadium was originally built as a baseball-specific 
venue, it became more popular as a pro-football stadium despite hosting 
both sports for a majority of its life. The Broncos called Mile High Stadium 
home from their beginning in the AFL in 1960 until 2000. The Bears, who 
changed their name to the Zephyrs in 1985, continued to play in the stadium 
until 1992 when the franchise was moved to New Orleans. The move was precipitated 
by the awarding of a Major League Baseball franchise to the city of Denver, 
and in 1993 the Colorado Rockies season opened in Mile High. The team played 
the 1993 and strike-shortened 1994 seasons in Mile High setting MLB attendance 
records while Coors Field was being constructed in downtown Denver. In 
addition to the Broncos, Bears/Zephyrs, and Rockies, Mile High Stadium 
was home to several other professional teams during the course of its history. 
The Denver Gold of the United States Football League called Mile High home 
from 1983 to 1985, and the stadium played host to the inaugural USFL championship 
game on July 17, 1983. Two professional soccer teams also played at Mile 
High. The first was the Denver Dynamos of the North American Soccer League, 
who were founded in 1974 and played their first two seasons in Denver before 
moving to Bloomington, Minnesota and becoming the Minnesota Kicks. Denver 
was home to one of Major League Soccer's 10 charter franchises as the Colorado 
Rapids were formed and played in Mile High from 1996 until 2001, making 
them the last franchise to play in Mile High Stadium prior to its closure. 
After the Rapids' 2001 season, Mile High Stadium was closed and in 2002 
the stadium was demolished. Mile High Stadium was originally built as Bears 
Stadium for minor league baseball by Bob Howsam in 1948 at the site of 
a former landfill. The stadium initially consisted of a single 18,000-seat 
grandstand stretching along the north side from the left field foul pole 
to the right field foul pole on the west side.[5] Luther "Bud" Phillips 
hit the first official home run out of Bears Stadium.[6] In its first full 
season in 1949, the Bears averaged over 6,600 per game to lead the minor 
leagues in attendance.[5] In the late 1950s, there was an attempt to form 
a third major league, the Continental League, helmed by former Dodger general 
manager Branch Rickey. Howsam, who had worked with Rickey years before 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, joined ranks with Rickey, pleading for a 
major league team in Denver. Advised that to get a major league franchise 
Denver would need a much larger ballpark, Bears Stadium would begin the 
first of its many expansions. Over 8,000 seats were added to the south 
stands, bringing stadium capacity to 23,100. Major League Baseball's (MLB) 
answer to the Continental League was to expand its two Leagues, which would 
eventually lead to the folding of the Continental League. Although Denver 
was not awarded a franchise, MLB promised teams in the future for Denver 
and other cities. Howsam was now trapped with a massive debt load and a 
stadium far too big for a minor-league team. Frantically searching for 
a solution, he concluded the only way out was to extend the stadium's season 
with football. A large bleacher section was added along the south side 
and temporary east stands were built in 1960, raising the capacity to 34,000.[6] 
Howsam's ownership in the AFL was short-lived, as overwhelming debt forced 
Howsam to sell all his sports interests in 1961. His dream of major league 
baseball in Denver would be placed on hold for another 30 years. Denver 
had to settle for the minor league Bears and the AFL Broncos, who resembled 
football's version of the early New York Mets. The players looked comical 
in their yellow and brown vertical striped socks and mustard yellow and 
brown uniforms, and the team was sometimes derided by local fans in the 
stadium when the Broncos would take the field. It took a few years to gain 
a following. In 1961, they drew fewer fans in a year than the Broncos now 
draw in a single game. In the middle of the 1960s, the team changed its 
colors to orange and blue, became slightly more competitive, attendance 
turned around and more locals caught what came to be known as "Bronco Fever".[citation 
needed] One condition of including Denver in the AFL-NFL merger announced 
in 1966 was expanding Bears Stadium to at least 50,000 seats. This required 
adding second and third decks along the west sideline (first base line). 
This expansion was completed in 1968, when the stadium was sold to the 
city of Denver, which renamed it Mile High Stadium and built the upper 
deck along the west side, thus raising capacity to 50,657.[7] The Broncos 
sold out every game in their inaugural NFL season. Every Broncos game—preseason, 
regular season (not including games with replacement players) and playoffs—has 
been sold out since, a streak that continued after the Broncos left Mile 
High. As ticket sales increased, the stadium expanded to 51,706 seats. 
With a $25 million bond issue in 1974 another stadium renovation added 
more seats. By 1976, seating was up to 63,532 as the upper decks construction 
was completed along the north end zone (third base line). An ingenious 
expansion that took place from 1975–1977 raised the capacity to 75,103 
by extending the upper deck that was along the north side and building 
a movable, triple-decked stands along the east side. When fully retracted 
toward the field, the stands would form a horseshoe for football, appropriate 
considering the team was the Denver Broncos. Yet when fully extended by 
145 feet (44 m), the stadium could still fit a normal-sized baseball field 
with outfield distances of 335 feet down the left-field line, 375 feet 
to left-center and 423 to center field.[8] The movable structure was 450 
feet (137 m) long, 200 feet (61 m) wide, and weighed nearly 9 million pounds 
(4,500 short tons, 4,000 metric tons). When a game or event required moving 
the stands the 145 feet in or out, engineers pumped water into 163 water 
bearings spaced out beneath the stands, lifting the structure off its foundation. 
A sheet of water ⅓-inch thick formed under the structure. Hydraulic rams 
then pushed the stands forward at the rate of two feet per minute, taking 
stadium engineers about six hours from start to finish to move the stands.[8] 
In 1975, Denver approached actor Roy Rogers to commission a statue of his 
horse, Trigger, for display at the stadium. A 24-foot, 1,300-pound fiberglass 
replica of the horse had previously been produced for the Roy Rogers Museum 
in Victorville, California. Rogers agreed, with the stipulation that the 
new statue not be named "Trigger". Denver fans were polled by The Denver 
Post to decide on a different name, and "Bucky" was chosen. Painted white 
to match the Broncos logo, the statue was mounted atop the scoreboard at 
Mile High, where it remained for 25 years before the being relocated to 
the new stadium. Mounted, the statue measures 27-feet and 1,600 pounds.[9] 
Mile High Stadium, in the 1970s and 1980s, was the only professional-caliber 
baseball facility to have an all grass infield, with sliding pits around 
bases. This unique feature was similar to several newer Major League Baseball 
stadiums that also used sliding pits, except those other stadiums all had 
artificial turf infields.[citation needed] In 1986, 77 luxury suites were 
added atop the west stands, increasing the official seating capacity to 
76,123. The Jacksons performed two concerts at Mile High Stadium on September 
7 and 8, 1984 during their Victory Tour.[10] The stadium was the penultimate 
stop on Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band's Born in the U.S.A. Tour, 
where they performed two shows on September 23 and 24, 1985. Billy Graham 
held his "Rocky Mountain Crusade" at the stadium in 1987. The stadium hosted 
the final show of The 1988 Monsters of Rock Festival Tour, featuring Van 
Halen, Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come, on July 30, 1988. 
Metallica and Guns N' Roses brought the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium 
Tour to the stadium on September 19, 1992, with Body Count as their opening 
act. Lynyrd Skynyrd played at the Stadium June 27, 1976, as part of their 
One More From The Road tour. On 21 October 1992, U2 performed at Mile High 
as part of the third leg of their Zoo TV Tour.[11] U2 would return again 
to perform in concert 1 May 1997 on the first leg of their PopMart Tour.[12] 
In August 1993, Denver hosted World Youth Day. On August 12 and 13, Mile 
High Stadium hosted two events with Pope John Paul II, the Papal Welcoming 
Ceremony and the Way of the Cross.[13] The stadium played host to Ozzfest 
on June 24, 1997. June 27, 28, and 29, 1969, concert promoter Barry Fey 
held The Denver Pop Festival at Mile High Stadium with many well known 
acts performing every evening. The city of Denver supported the festival 
and made available areas for camping and other services. The Denver Police 
however allowed non-ticket holders to enter the parking area whereupon 
they attempted to climb over chain link fencing to see the show while claiming 
that music should be "free". Police responded by lobbing tear gas canisters 
toward the fences knowing full well that the gas would affect everyone 
in attendance at the outdoor venue. Sunday night's final act was The Jimi 
Hendrix Experience which proved to be the Experience' final performance 
as a trio as well. Bassist Noel Redding quit and simply flew back to England 
that night. Jimi did not perform again for 6 weeks until mid August when 
he closed The Woodstock Music and Art Fair with his new band. Jimi Hendrix 
died 13 months later in September 1970. The stadium's large capacity combined 
with enthusiasm for the new team and the lowest MLB ticket prices allowed 
the expansion Rockies to set Major League Baseball attendance records before 
moving to Coors Field for the 1995 season. The stadium was known for its 
loudness with the sound of fans stomping in the bleachers echoing within 
the horseshoe. The large center and right fields, foul territory areas 
(although left field was shorter than average), and center field's 30-foot 
(10 m) high fence, was not as problematic for pitchers as Coors Field would 
be. The club's 1993 season attendance was 4,483,350 in 79 home dates (81 
games – 2 doubleheaders), an average of 56,751 per home date. The Rockies 
were on pace to exceed the record during the strike-shortened 1994 season. 
They had drawn 3,281,511 in 57 home dates (also 57 games), an average of 
57,570 per home date. (Season attendance figures from The Sporting News 
Baseball Record Book, 2007, p. 234; Game counts are from game logs on Retrosheet.)[14][15] 
The final football game at Mile High Stadium was December 23, 2000, in 
which the Broncos routed the 49ers, 38–9. The Broncos had defeated every 
visiting franchise from the stadium's opening to close, enjoying perfect 
records against the Arizona Cardinals (3-0), Baltimore Ravens (1-0), Carolina 
Panthers (1-0), Green Bay Packers (5-0), and Indianapolis Colts (5-0).[16] 
The stadium again hosted Ozzfest, for the second and last time, on June 
21, 2001 and hosted The Area:One Festival on July 28, 2001. The stadium 
was featured in Michael Moore's 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine 
as the backdrop for Moore's interview with controversial rock musician 
Marilyn Manson during the 2001 Ozzfest tour.[17] The Colorado Rapids were 
the final professional team to play in Mile High Stadium, their home since 
1996. Team Captain John Spencer that year became the first Rapids player 
ever to record a hat trick when he scored three times against Chicago in 
a 3-1 win in the Rapids' annual Independence Day blowout celebration at 
Mile High Stadium on July 4 in front of 60,500 fans.The Rapids played the 
last ever professional sporting event ever held at Mile High on September 
8 of this year, a 2-0 loss to the LA Galaxy. The Rapids were scheduled 
to play the first ever professional sports event ever held in Invesco Field 
at Mile High soon after, but the match was cancelled following the terrorist 
attacks on September 11. Mile High Stadium was closed in 2001, after the 
Colorado Rapids and Denver Broncos moved to neighboring Sports Authority 
Field at Mile High (then known as Invesco Field at Mile High), upon completion 
of the new stadium. The demolition of Mile High Stadium began in January 
2002, an event covered extensively by local newspapers and broadcast live 
on television. The demolition was performed by Spirtas Wrecking Company 
of St. Louis, Mo., the same group that led the demolition of arenas and 
stadiums in St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Seattle. The stadium demolition was 
completed by April. The former stadium is now a parking lot for Sports 
Authority Field at Mile High. The historical site of many games and events 
for 40 years is marked by the hills forming the west and north stands, 
the corner between them descended by a staircase, much as the stands were.
