William Pinkney DeLancey (November 28, 1911 – November 28, 1946) was an 
American professional baseball player during the 1930s. As a 22-year-old 
rookie catcher in 1934, he helped to lead the St. Louis Cardinals' fabled 
Gashouse Gang team to the world championship; but, after only one more 
full big-league season, he was stricken with tuberculosis, effectively 
ending his playing career. The 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 185 lb (84 kg) DeLancey 
was born in Greensboro, North Carolina. He signed with the Cardinals' farm 
system in 1930. He spent his first year in the minors playing for the Shawnee 
(Oklahoma) Robins in the Class C Western Association, making an impressive 
showing with a .297 batting average on 192 at-bats. In 1931, he was reassigned 
to the Danville (Illinois) Veterans of the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa 
League, where he continued to show improvement, ending the year by playing 
11 games with the Columbus (Ohio) Red Birds of the American Association. 
The following year, DeLancey was transferred to the Class C Springfield 
(Missouri) Cardinals, batting .329 with 118 RBIs, and received his Major 
League baptism by appearing in eight games for the major league Cardinals 
in September 1932. In 1933, he returned to the Columbus Red Birds, hitting 
21 home runs and batting .285 in 123 games. In 1934, he made the Cardinals' 
roster and, as a left-handed hitter, platooned with the right-handed Spud 
Davis to share the Cardinals' regular catching job. He became a favorite 
of player-manager Frankie Frisch,[1] and performed admirably on the field, 
hitting .316 with 80 hits, 18 doubles, 13 home runs, 41 bases on balls 
and an OPS of .979 in 295 plate appearances. The catching platoon—Davis 
started 89 games, and DeLancey 65—was highly effective, as the veteran 
Davis, 29, hit an even .300 with 65 runs batted in and an .830 OPS. The 
Cardinals outlasted the New York Giants in a September pennant race to 
take the National League championship on September 29. DeLancey was behind 
the plate during the clincher, catching fellow rookie Paul Dean's complete 
game.[2] The Cardinals' opponents in the 1934 World Series, the American 
League champion Detroit Tigers, featured an all-right-handed starting rotation, 
and manager Frisch responded by starting DeLancey as his catcher in every 
contest. DeLancey caught every inning (Davis was a perfect two-for-two 
as a pinch hitter), as St. Louis prevailed in seven games. DeLancey collected 
only five hits in 29 at bats, but four of them were for extra bases, including 
three doubles and a home run, hit off Tommy Bridges in Game 5 at Sportsman's 
Park. DeLancey also drove in four runs. The DeLancey-Davis catching platoon 
returned in 1935, but DeLancey got off to a sluggish start at the plate. 
He recovered in midyear and lifted his batting average to .321 on July 
21,[3] before fading to .279 during the heat of August and September. He 
also began to experience loss of energy and appetite.[4] Still, he started 
half of the Cardinals' 154 regular-season games. During an off-season sandlot 
game, however, he collapsed and was diagnosed with tuberculosis.[4] Realizing 
the seriousness of his condition while recuperating in Arizona, he voluntarily 
retired from the Cardinals on February 12, 1936. In 1937, the Cardinals 
established a Class D farm team in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and hired the 
weakened DeLancey as its manager. He was able to lead the Albuquerque Cardinals 
for three years, 1937–1939, and win two Arizona–Texas League championships. 
He also regained enough strength to return to the field for brief periods 
as a player, for nine games in 1938 and for 19 games in 1939. In 1940, 
his health had improved to the point that he was able to return to the 
Cardinals, and he spent the year as the Redbirds' third-string catcher. 
He appeared in 15 games, 12 in the field (with two starts), and collected 
four hits in 18 at-bats. His final major league appearance was against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 8, 1940. Over his short but illustrious 
career, Bill DeLancey played in 219 MLB games, amassing 173 hits, with 
32 doubles, ten triples, 19 home runs and 85 runs batted in. DeLancey resumed 
his managerial career in the Cardinals' farm system in 1941 with the Class 
C Pioneer League—concluding his active career with 49 games played—and 
1942 in the Class B Piedmont League. When World War II intervened, many 
minor leagues suspended operations or folded entirely, and DeLancey's managerial 
career ended in 1942. Baseball Hall of Fame executive Branch Rickey, who 
was the general manager of the Gashouse Gang Cardinals, named DeLancey 
as the catcher on his all-time team, despite DeLancey's illness-shortened 
career.[4] In 1963, the elderly Rickey also likened the Cardinals' young 
catcher, Tim McCarver—a skilled, left-handed hitter and take-charge presence 
behind the plate—to DeLancey.[5] While playing for the Danville Veterans 
during the 1931 season, Bill met Frances Yasaitis, a nursing student from 
nearby Westville, Illinois.[6] Although he was on the road for away games 
that year and was transferred to the Springfield Cardinals the following 
year, they grew increasingly close. Following the end of the 1932 season, 
the couple were married in Danville. About a month before the start of 
the 1934 World Series, Frances gave birth to a daughter, Doris. After Bill 
contracted tuberculosis and retired from play, doctors advised the couple 
to move to the dry desert climate of the southwest U.S., so the DeLanceys 
took up residence in Phoenix. Frances' nursing experience helped Bill's 
condition improve somewhat over the next several years, however, his tuberculosis 
gradually developed into pleurisy, a painful lung disease. Nevertheless, 
the DeLanceys were able to have another child, Mary Jane, in 1945. His 
health then began to decline again, and he died on his 35th birthday, November 
28, 1946, in Phoenix. He is interred at St. Francis Catholic Cemetery there.
