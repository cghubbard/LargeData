Arnold Malcolm "Mickey" Owen (April 4, 1916 – July 13, 2005) was a catcher 
for several Major League Baseball teams. Between 1937 and 1954, Owen played 
for the St. Louis Cardinals (1937–40), Brooklyn Dodgers (1941–45), Chicago 
Cubs (1949–51) and Boston Red Sox (1954). He batted and threw right-handed. 
In a 13-season career, Owen posted a .255 batting average with 14 home 
runs and 378 RBI in 1209 games. A native of Nixa, Missouri, Owen was signed 
by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1935. He made his major league debut in 1937, 
appearing in 80 games, and spent the next three full seasons in St. Louis 
before being traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers for catcher Gus Mancuso, a 
minor league player and $60,000. From 1941 to 1944, Owen averaged 46 RBI 
a season for the Dodgers and played for the Brooklyn team that faced the 
New York Yankees in the 1941 World Series. During that championship season, 
he set a then-record for most consecutive errorless fielding chances by 
a catcher (508) and finished with a .995 fielding average. Yet ironically, 
Owen is most remembered in baseball lore for a costly mistake that he committed 
during that year's World Series. The Yankees held a 2-games-to-1 lead entering 
Game 4 on October 5 at the Dodgers' home field, Ebbets Field. With the 
Dodgers leading 4–3 and 2 outs for the Yankees in the top of the ninth 
inning and the count 3–2 on Tommy Henrich, Henrich swung and missed at 
strike 3, which would have been the final out of the game, but the ball 
eluded Owen and went to the backstop, allowing Henrich to make it safely 
to first base.[1] The Yankees then rallied and scored four runs in the 
remainder of the inning and won the game 7–4. Instead of the series being 
tied, the victory gave the Yankees a 3–1 lead. The next day, they beat 
the Dodgers 3–1 in Game 5 and won the World Championship. The Dodgers didn’t 
return to the World Series until 1947 and didn’t win the series until 1955. 
A four-consecutive All-Star from 1941 to 1944, in 1942 Owen became the 
first player to pinch-hit a home run in an All-Star game, and during the 
1944 regular season, he became the third National League catcher to ever 
record an unassisted double play. Owen played for Brooklyn until the end 
of the 1945 season. He then served in the Navy at the end of World War 
II. After his discharge from the military in 1946, Owen expected to return 
to Brooklyn, but he failed to reach an agreement with the Dodgers and signed 
a contract to be a player-manager in the Mexican League. There were several 
other big leaguers who fled to Mexico, including Alex Carrasquel, Danny 
Gardella, Max Lanier, Sal Maglie, Luis Olmo and Vern Stephens, attracted 
by good salaries. In retaliation for the defections, Commissioner Happy 
Chandler sought a lifetime suspension for them, but his penalty was later 
reduced to three years. Owen returned to the majors in 1949 with the Chicago 
Cubs and played for them until the 1951 season. He finished his major league 
playing career with the Boston Red Sox in 1954. Following his retirement 
as a player, Owen spent two seasons (1955–56) as a Red Sox coach, then 
worked for the Cubs as a scout. He returned to the Ozarks and founded the 
Mickey Owen Baseball School on Route 66 near Miller, Missouri, in 1959. 
Owen sold the school in 1963, but remained an instructor until the 1980s. 
Notable alumni include Michael Jordan, Joe Girardi and Charlie Sheen.[2] 
In 1964, Owen ran for Greene County sheriff and won. He also won three 
more elections, serving in the office until 1981. Owen ran for Lt. Governor 
of Missouri in 1980 and finished third with 13% and 79038 votes. Owen was 
still playing in old timers' games in the 1980s. Owen lived the last years 
of his life in the Missouri Veterans Home in Mount Vernon. He died in Springfield, 
Missouri at age 89. In his 1942 book Many Happy Returns: An Unofficial
