Gerald Lee Laird III (born November 13, 1979) is an American professional 
baseball catcher for the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican Baseball League. 
He graduated La Quinta High School in 1998, and played college baseball 
at Cypress College. He was born in Westminster, California and made his 
MLB debut in 2003 with the Texas Rangers. He also played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) with the Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves 
and Arizona Diamondbacks. Laird first attended Rancho Alamitos High School, 
and then later graduated from La Quinta High School in Westminster, California. 
He was chosen by the Oakland Athletics in the second round of the 1998 
draft, but held out for more money.[citation needed] When the A's declined, 
Laird enrolled in Cypress College and led its baseball team to the finals.[citation 
needed] In June 1999, Oakland and Laird negotiated a new contract. In his 
first minor league season, 1999, he played 60 games with the Low-A Southern 
Oregon Timberjacks and hit .285. He divided the 2000 season between the 
rookie-level Arizona League Athletics and High-A Visalia Oaks, but a broken 
wrist limited his playing time. Going into the 2001 season he was considered 
a top prospect until he tailed off to .255 with the Modesto A's.[1] Shortly 
before the 2002 season Oakland traded Laird to the Texas Rangers along 
with outfielder Ryan Ludwick, Jason Hart and Mario Ramos, for slugging 
first baseman Carlos Peña and southpaw relief pitcher Mike Venafro.[2] 
Texas assigned Laird to its Double-A Tulsa Drillers, where his strong defensive 
play and improved batting average (.276) drew plaudits.[3] He joined the 
Rangers for 2003 spring training, but was soon farmed out to the Triple-A 
Oklahoma RedHawks. The parent club recalled him on April 30 when catcher 
Todd Greene went on the disabled list, and he made his major league debut 
the same day. But when Greene returned from the disabled list after 15 
days, Laird was optioned back to Oklahoma. The Rangers recalled him again 
in September when the rosters expanded, and he remained with the big league 
club for the rest of the season. In his two stints with Texas, he got into 
only 19 games and hit .273 but at the end of the year was chosen for the 
USA Baseball squad.[4] Laird won the Rangers' starting catching job in 
2004 spring training after the Einar Diaz trade, but after dislocating 
his thumb in a home plate collision in May ended up on the disabled list 
and lost his starting job to Rod Barajas.[5] After spending most of the 
2005 season in Triple-A, he was called up again as backup catcher for the 
Rangers in 2006. He went into that season well-regarded around the majors 
for his defensive skills despite a career MLB batting average of only .234.[citation 
needed]. Commented San Diego Padres general manager Kevin Towers: "The 
Rangers knew they had a commodity. The only way they were going to part 
with him was if some team grossly overpaid [in a trade]."[6] In 78 games 
in 2006, he hit an improved .296 with seven home runs, earning the starting 
catcher's job for 2007. New Ranger manager Ron Washington took a special 
interest in him during spring training: "I just want him to concentrate 
on making this pitching staff better and helping them to believe in him."[7] 
But that year he had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league 
catchers (.984) and the lowest range factor among full-time AL catchers 
(6.83).[citation needed] Compensating for the low fielding percentage, 
he threw out 40% of attempted base stealers, ranking him second behind 
the Seattle Mariners' Kenji Johjima in 2007.[citation needed] He was also 
in the second most double plays among all MLB catchers despite being among 
the lowest in fielding chances.[8][9][10] On December 8, 2008, he was traded 
to the Detroit Tigers for two minor league pitchers, Carlos Melo and Guillermo 
Moscoso.[11] The Tigers named him starting catcher ahead of Dane Sardinha 
and Matt Treanor, and Laird rewarded them with the highest caught-stealing 
throwing average in the American League.[citation needed] In May 2010, 
while struggling offensively, Laird changed his jersey number from 8 to 
12.[12] The St. Louis Cardinals signed Laird to a one-year contract for 
the 2011 season, where he won his first World Series ring as backup catcher 
to All-Star Yadier Molina.[13] On November 18, 2011, the Detroit Tigers 
welcomed Laird back with a one-year contract for the 2012 season as backup 
catcher to Alex Avila while slugger Victor Martinez, often used as a DH 
rather than as a catcher in any event, was on the disabled list for the 
entire season. He rewarded them by hitting .282, often hitting DH, in the 
regular season and helping them come back from well behind the Chicago 
White Sox to win their second consecutive AL Central Division title, edge 
the powerful young upstart Oakland Athletics 3–2 in the ALDS thanks to 
defending MVP Justin Verlander's stellar pitching in Games 1 & 5, and then 
sweep the suddenly discombobulated New York Yankees 4–0 in the ALCS. Laird 
had the key hit that put the Tiger's ahead in Kansas City the night they 
beat the Royals to clinch the AL Central for 2012. He was in his second 
World Series in a row, which the Tigers lost to the San Francisco Giants 
4–0, and became a free agent on October 29.[14] After former Braves backup 
David Ross signed with Boston for a two-year contract early in the off-season, 
the Braves scavenged the open market for a backup catcher. They found Laird, 
signing him to a two-year, $3 million contract with up to $750,000 in performance 
bonuses based on games played.[15] With Brian McCann leaving in free agency, 
Laird handled the primary backup role to Evan Gattis in 2014. Laird ended 
his tenure with the Braves posting a .204 batting average.[16] On February 
2, 2015, he signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[17] 
A back injury sustained during the first month of the season ended Laird's 
season.[18][19] He was designated for assignment on August 20, 2015 and 
released on August 24.[20][21] On June 16, 2016, Laird signed with the 
Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican Baseball League. Laird is represented by 
sports agent Scott Boras. His younger brother, Brandon has also played
