"As Player" "As Manager" Leo Alexander Fohl (November 28, 1876 â€“ October 
30, 1965) was an American manager in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland 
Indians, St. Louis Browns, and Boston Red Sox. Born in Lowell, Ohio, Fohl's 
involvement in professional baseball began in the early 1900s, when he 
served as a catcher for minor-league clubs in Ohio.[1] His subsequent major-league 
playing career consisted of just five games as a catcher and 17 at-bats 
over two seasons. In 1915, he took over as manager of the Indians, with 
his best finish coming in 1918 when the Tribe finished in second place 
behind the Red Sox. He never made an important move, however, without consulting 
Tris Speaker, who arrived via a trade with Boston in the same year Fohl 
took over.[citation needed] In 1919, Fohl resigned as the Indians' manager 
after 78 games, and Speaker stepped in as manager for the remainder of 
the season.[2] Fohl resurfaced in 1921 with the Browns, where in 1922 the 
team was only eliminated from the pennant race on the penultimate game 
of the season, finishing just one game behind the New York Yankees. When 
the 1923 Browns fell back closer (but still above) .500, he was fired in 
midseason. In 1924, he joined the Red Sox, where he finished his managerial 
career on a dismal note; his Red Sox teams never finished higher than seventh 
place. (In fact, he was the only man to manage in the American League between 
1924 and 1926 and not be enshrined in the Hall of Fame.) He finished with 
a 713-792 (.474 winning percentage) as manager. He managed the Toronto 
Maple Leafs of the International League in 1927, but was fired mid-way
