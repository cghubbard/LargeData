The 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 82nd in-season exhibition 
game between the All-Stars of the National League (NL) and the American 
League (AL); the leagues composing Major League Baseball. The event was 
held on Tuesday, July 12, 2011 at Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona, home 
of the National League Arizona Diamondbacks. The game ended in a 5–1 win 
for the National League, their second straight All-Star victory. It was 
the first MLB All-Star Game to be held in Arizona and the first in a National 
League Park to have a designated hitter. With a combination of injuries 
and rule enforcements, a record 84 players were named to the All-Star rosters. 
This broke the record of 82 players that were on rosters for the 2010 game.[2] 
As with each All-Star Game since 1970, the nine starting position players 
of each league were elected by fan balloting. The remaining players were 
selected by a players' vote, each league's team manager, and a second fan 
balloting to add one more player to each roster. In all, 32 players were 
selected to each league's team, not including players who decline to play 
due to injuries or personal reasons. Diamondbacks manager Bob Melvin confirmed 
on April 10, 2009 that Arizona would host the 2011 All-Star Game and it 
was officially announced by Commissioner Bud Selig the next day.[3][4] 
Phoenix had never hosted the All-Star Game before, the last first-time 
host city was Denver, Colorado in 1998.[4] The game was the ninth straight 
All-Star Game to decide home-field advantage in the World Series.[5] Prior 
All-Star games had only used the designated hitter (DH) rule when in American 
League parks.[6] However, the 2011 game was the first to feature a DH in 
a NL park following a rules change in 2010.[6] The NL came into the game 
having won the previous year's match, their first victory since 1996.[7] 
Some, such as New York Congressman José Serrano and sportswriter Mike Lupica, 
had suggested that Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig should 
move the game because of the controversial SB1070 anti-illegal immigration 
bill passed by the Arizona legislature and signed into law by Governor 
Jan Brewer.[8][9][10] Others considered asking club owners, sponsors and 
even players to boycott the All-Star Game if the law was implemented and 
the game remained in Phoenix.[11] However, Selig announced on May 13, 2010 
that the game would remain at Chase Field in Phoenix as planned.[12] Balloting 
for the 2011 All-Star Game starters began online April 26 and continued 
through June 30.[13] Fan voting also took place in each MLB stadium, beginning 
May 10 (at the latest) and ending on June 24.[13] The top vote-getters 
at each position and the top three among outfielders, were named the starters 
for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 3.[14] 
A record 32.5 million votes were cast, beating out the previous record 
from 2009 by roughly 9 million.[15] José Bautista was the leading vote-getter 
with 7,454,753 votes, easily breaking the previous single-player vote record 
of 6,069,688 held by Ken Griffey, Jr.[15][16] Three other American League 
players also topped Griffey's record. Ryan Braun was the National League's 
leading vote getter, receiving a NL record 5,928,004 votes.[15] After the 
rosters were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created 
for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each 
roster, with online balloting conducted from Sunday afternoon, July 3, 
through Thursday afternoon, July 7. The winners of the final vote were 
Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox (AL) and Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia 
Phillies. Victorino became the first ever two-time Final Vote winner, having 
also won in 2009.[17] UMPIRES: Home Plate – Dale Scott; First Base – Jerry
