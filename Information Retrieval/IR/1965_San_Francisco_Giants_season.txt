The 1965 San Francisco Giants season was the Giants' 83rd year in Major 
League Baseball, their eighth year in San Francisco since their move from 
New York following the 1957 season, and their sixth at Candlestick Park. 
The team finished in second place in the National League with an 95â€“67 
record, 2 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. Infielders Coaches On August 
22, 1965, Giants pitcher Juan Marichal was involved in a notorious incident 
that occurred in a game played against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Batting 
against Sandy Koufax, Marichal felt that Dodger catcher Johnny Roseboro's 
return throws had flown too close to his head.[6] Words were exchanged, 
and Roseboro, throwing off his catcher's helmet and mask, rose to continue 
the argument. Marichal responded by hitting Roseboro's unprotected head 
with his bat. The benches cleared into a 14-minute brawl, while Giant captain 
Willie Mays escorted the bleeding Roseboro (who would require 14 stitches) 
back to the clubhouse. Marichal was ejected, suspended for nine days and 
fined US$1,750. Roseboro filed a lawsuit, but eventually settled out of 
court, supposedly for $7,000. Marichal and Roseboro would eventually go 
on to become close friends, reconciling any personal animosity and even 
autographing photographs of the brawl. The image of Marichal raising his 
bat over his head to deliver a blow to Roseboro was carried in practically 
every newspaper in the nation and re-printed in Life magazine.[6] Many 
people protested the apparently light punishment meted out, but as it was 
it hurt the Giants considerably. They were in a neck-and-neck pennant race 
with the Dodgers and the race was decided with only two games to play. 
Marichal's nine-day suspension cost him two pitching turns, and the Giants 
lost the pennant by two games. Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played;
