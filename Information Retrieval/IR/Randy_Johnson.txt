Randall David "Randy" Johnson (born September 10, 1963), nicknamed "The 
Big Unit", is an American left-handed former pitcher who played from 1988 
to 2009 for six teams in Major League Baseball, primarily the Seattle Mariners 
and Arizona Diamondbacks. His 303 career victories rank as the fifth-most 
by a lefthander in major league history, while his 4,875 strikeouts place 
him second all-time behind Nolan Ryan and are the most by a lefthander. 
He holds five of the seven highest single-season strikeout totals by a 
lefthander in modern history. Johnson won the Cy Young Award five times, 
second only to Roger Clemens' seven; he is one of two pitchers to win the 
award four consecutive times (1999–2002), and in 1999 joined Pedro Martínez 
and Gaylord Perry in the rare feat of winning the award in both the American 
and National Leagues. He is also one of five pitchers to pitch no-hitters 
in both leagues; with the second no-hitter, in 2004, he became the oldest 
pitcher in major league history to throw a perfect game. He is one of the 
few pitchers in history to record a win against all 30 MLB franchises. 
One of the tallest players in major league history at 6 feet 10 inches 
(2.08 m) and a ten-time All-Star, Johnson was celebrated for having one 
of the most dominant fastballs in the game; he regularly approached – and 
occasionally exceeded – 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) during his prime. 
He also threw a hard, biting slider. After struggling early in his career, 
gaining only 64 wins by his 30th birthday, he went on to lead his league 
in strikeouts nine times, and in earned run average, winning percentage 
and complete games four times each. Johnson was named co-MVP of the 2001 
World Series, leading the Diamondbacks to a championship in only their 
fourth year of play. His .646 career winning percentage ranks sixth among 
lefthanders with at least 200 decisions, and among southpaws he ranks eighth 
in games started (603) and ninth in innings pitched (4,135 1/3). He also 
finished his career first in strikeouts per nine innings pitched (10.67), 
third in hit batsmen (188), and tenth in fewest hits allowed per nine innings 
pitched (7.24). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015, his 
first year of eligibility, and is the first member of the Hall to be depicted 
in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque. Johnson was born in Walnut Creek, 
California, to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles "Bud" Johnson.[1] By the 
time he entered Livermore High School, he was a star in baseball and basketball. 
In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw 
a perfect game in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich 
team that assembled top players from throughout California. After high 
school he was drafted in 1982 by the Atlanta Braves in the 4th round and 
offered $50,000 to sign. Instead, Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship 
to the University of Southern California, also playing 2 years of basketball. 
He continued to start at USC (where he was a teammate of Mark McGwire) 
under coach Rod Dedeaux, but often exhibited control problems. Johnson 
was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the second round of the 1985 Major 
League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on September 15, 
1988 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, earning a 9–4 victory with a five-inning 
outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim 
was Orestes Destrade in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3–0 
with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw 
him slip to an 0–4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7, and 
on May 25 he was traded to the Seattle Mariners in a trade involving five 
pitchers that brought Mark Langston to Montreal. After joining the Mariners 
during the 1989 season, Johnson led the AL in walks for three consecutive 
seasons (1990–92), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing 
the Milwaukee Brewers, the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks 
to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a 
no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 
4-inning start in 1992. But his untapped talent was volcanic: In 1990, 
Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out Wade Boggs three times 
in one game, and a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers attested to his 
potential. Johnson credits a session with Nolan Ryan late in the 1992 season 
with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that 
he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long 
to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight 
change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel 
of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline 
from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and 
almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently.[2] 
In a September 27, 1992 game against the Texas Rangers, with Ryan the opposing 
starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while 
throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB 
game since.[3] Johnson broke out in 1993 with a 19–8 record, 3.24 ERA and 
his first of six 300-plus strikeout seasons (308). In May 1993, Johnson 
again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was 
the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against 
the Minnesota Twins' Chuck Knoblauch. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson 
was nearly dealt to the Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and Mike Timlin. 
Toronto general manager Pat Gillick had two separate transactions on the 
table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager Woody 
Woodward and one for Rickey Henderson with Oakland general manager Sandy 
Alderson. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize 
the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call he said he 
would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to 
Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized.[4] At the 1993 All-Star 
Game in Baltimore, Maryland, in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball 
over the head of Philadelphia Phillies first baseman John Kruk.[5] A similar 
incident would occur with Larry Walker in the 1997 All-Star Game.[6] After 
pitching well in the strike-shortened 1994 season, Johnson won the American 
League Cy Young Award in 1995 with an 18–2 record, 2.48 ERA and 294 strikeouts. 
His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind 
Johnny Allen, who had gone 15–1 for the Cleveland Indians in 1937. Johnson, 
who also finished second in the 1993 and 1997 Cy Young voting, and third 
in 1994, was the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the award, and the 
only one until Félix Hernández took home the honor in 2010. Johnson capped 
the Mariners' late season comeback by pitching a 3-hitter in the AL West's 
one-game playoff, crushing the California Angels' hopes with 12 strikeouts. 
Thus unable to start in the 5-game ALDS series against the Yankees until 
the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2–0 series lead. Johnson 
beat the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in 7 innings. When the series 
went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from an 0–2 deficit 
to win both games at the Kingdome, Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance 
in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest. Entering a 4–4 game 
in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the 9th, 10th, and 11th innings. He 
allowed 1 run, struck out 6, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle's 
dramatic comeback. Johnson posted an 0–6 playoff record in his next four 
playoff series, each of which his teams lost. Johnson was sidelined throughout 
much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in 1997 with 
a 20–4 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between 
May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53–9, including a 16–0 streak 
that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts 
in 1997, on June 24 and August 8. When the 1998 season began, Johnson was 
upset the Mariners would not offer him a contract extension, given his 
contract was expiring after the season.[7] Though the Mariners initially 
wanted to keep Johnson, turning down a trade offer from the Los Angeles 
Dodgers,[8] they fell out of contention, going 8-20 in June.[9] Minutes 
before the non-waiver trade deadline, on July 31, the Mariners traded Johnson 
to the Houston Astros for three minor leaguers, Freddy García, Carlos Guillén, 
and John Halama.[9] In 11 regular-season starts with the Astros, Johnson 
had a 10–1 record, a 1.28 ERA, and 116 strikeouts in 84⅓ innings, and pitched 
4 shutouts. Johnson finished 7th in the National League Cy Young voting 
despite pitching only 2 months in the league, and helped Houston win their 
second straight National League Central division title. During the playoffs, 
however, the Astros lost the 1998 NLDS to the San Diego Padres, 3–1. Johnson 
started Games 1 and 4, both losses. He only gave up three earned runs combined 
in the two games, but received only one run in support (in Game 4). Johnson 
agreed to a four-year contract, with an option for a fifth year, for $52.4 
million, with the Arizona Diamondbacks, a second-year franchise.[10] Johnson 
led the team to the playoffs that year on the strength of a 17–9 record 
and 2.48 ERA with 364 strikeouts, leading the majors in innings, complete 
games and strikeouts. Johnson won the 1999 NL Cy Young Award and Warren 
Spahn Award as the best left-handed pitcher in MLB.[11] Johnson joined 
Gaylord Perry and Pedro Martínez as the only pitchers to have won the Cy 
Young Award in both the American and National Leagues. (Roger Clemens and 
Roy Halladay have since done so.) Johnson finished 2000 with 19 wins, 347 
strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA, and won his second consecutive NL Cy Young Award[12] 
and Warren Spahn Award.[13] The Diamondbacks acquired Curt Schilling from 
the Philadelphia Phillies in July 2000, and the two aces anchored the Diamondbacks 
rotation.[14] In the fourth year of the franchise's existence, Johnson 
and Schilling carried the Arizona Diamondbacks to their first World Series 
appearance and victory in 2001 against the New York Yankees. Johnson and 
Schilling shared the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the Babe 
Ruth Award,[15] and were named Sports Illustrated magazine's 2001 "Sportsmen 
of the Year." For the first of two consecutive seasons, Johnson and Schilling 
finished 1–2 in the Cy Young balloting.[16] Johnson also won his third 
consecutive Warren Spahn Award.[17] Johnson's performance was particularly 
dominating, striking out 11 in a 3-hit shutout in game 2, pitching seven 
innings for the victory in Game 6 and then coming on in relief the following 
day to pick up the win in Game 7. Of Arizona's eleven post-season wins 
in 2001, Johnson had five. Johnson's Game 7 relief appearance was his second 
of the 2001 season; on July 19, a game against the Padres was delayed by 
two electrical explosions in Qualcomm Stadium. When the game resumed the 
following day, Johnson stepped in as the new pitcher and racked up 16 strikeouts 
in 7 innings, technically setting the record for the most strikeouts in 
a relief stint. In a freak accident on March 24, 2001, during the 7th inning 
of a spring training game against the San Francisco Giants, Johnson threw 
a fastball to Calvin Murray that struck and killed a dove. The bird swooped 
across the infield just as Johnson was releasing the ball. After being 
struck, the bird fell amid a "sea of feathers." The official call was "no 
pitch."[18] Johnson struck out 20 batters in a game on May 8, 2001 against 
the Cincinnati Reds. Johnson recorded all 20 strikeouts in the first nine 
innings, but because the game went into extra innings, it was not categorized 
by MLB as an "official" 20-strikeout game. On August 23, 2001, Johnson 
struck out three batters on nine pitches in the 6th inning of a 5–1 loss 
to the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the 30th pitcher in major league history 
to pitch an immaculate inning. In 2002, Johnson won the pitching Triple 
Crown, leading the NL in wins, ERA and strikeouts, and was voted his fourth 
consecutive Cy Young and Warren Spahn Awards.[19] It was Johnson's fourth 
consecutive 300-strikeout season with the Diamondbacks, and fifth consecutive 
overall, extending his own MLB record from the previous season in which 
he set the record for the most consecutive seasons with 300 or more strikeouts 
in a season by a pitcher.[20] He also became the first pitcher in baseball 
history to post a 24–5 record.[21] Johnson spent the majority of the 2003 
season on the disabled list and was ineffective in the few injury-hampered 
starts he did make. One thing he did accomplish that year was hitting his 
first career home run in a September 19, 2003 game against the Milwaukee 
Brewers. It was the only home run to date for Johnson, a career .125 hitter. 
On May 18, 2004, Johnson pitched the 17th perfect game in baseball history. 
At 40 years of age, he was the oldest pitcher to accomplish this feat. 
Johnson had 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2–0 defeat of the Atlanta Braves. 
The perfect game made him the fifth pitcher in Major League history (after 
Cy Young, Jim Bunning, Nolan Ryan, and Hideo Nomo) to pitch a no-hitter 
in both leagues. Johnson struck out Jeff Cirillo of the San Diego Padres 
on June 29, 2004 to become only the fourth MLB player to reach 4,000 strikeouts 
in a career.[22] He finished the 2004 season with a 16–14 record, though 
his poor record was partially due to a lack of run support as his ERA that 
year was 2.60. Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290). 
In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13–2. 
As his team only won 51 games that year, his ratio of winning 31.3% of 
his team's games was the highest for any starting pitcher since Steve Carlton 
in 1972 (who won 27 of the Phillies' 59 wins for an all-time record ratio 
of 45.8%). The Diamondbacks traded Johnson to the New York Yankees for 
Javier Vázquez, Brad Halsey, Dioner Navarro, and cash in January 2005.[23] 
Johnson pitched Opening Day for the Yankees on April 3, 2005 against the 
Boston Red Sox. Johnson was inconsistent through 2005, allowing 32 home 
runs; however, he regained his dominance in late 2005. He was 5–0 against 
the Yankees' division rival Red Sox and finished the season 17–8 with a 
3.79 ERA, and was second in the AL with 211 strikeouts. In 2005, The Sporting 
News published an update of their 1999 book Baseball's 100 Greatest Players. 
Johnson did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with 
his career totals considerably higher and his 2001 World Championship season 
taken into account, he was ranked at Number 60.[citation needed] Johnson 
was a disappointment in Game 3 of the 2005 Division Series against the 
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs in 3 innings. 
In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance after 
Mike Mussina gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5–2 lead, but 
the Yankees were unable to come back in the series. After an inconclusive 
year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his 
dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but 
then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, 
he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson 
was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with 
a 17–11 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It had been revealed 
at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had 
been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the 
season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure had caused him 
to miss his last start of 2006. After being given epidural anesthesia and 
a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS, however 
he gave up 5 runs in 5 2⁄3 innings. In January 2007, the Yankees traded 
Johnson back to the Diamondbacks, almost two years to the day that Arizona 
had traded him to New York, for a package of Luis Vizcaíno, Alberto González, 
Steven Jackson, and Ross Ohlendorf.[12] The Yankees' decision to trade 
Johnson was primarily based on his pre-season request to be traded after 
the death of his brother. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman was very 
sympathetic to Johnson's grief and agreed to trade him back to the Diamondbacks 
so that Johnson could be closer to his family in Phoenix.[citation needed] 
Johnson missed most of April, rehabilitating his injured back before returning 
on April 24, 2007. Johnson allowed six runs in 5 innings and took the loss, 
but struck out seven. He returned to form, and by his tenth start of the 
season was among the NL's top ten strikeout pitchers. But on July 3, his 
surgically repaired disc from the previous season was reinjured. Johnson 
had season-ending surgery on the same disc, this time removing it completely. 
Reporting that the procedure went "a little better than expected", Arizona 
hoped that Johnson would be ready for the 2008 season.[24] Johnson made 
his season debut on April 14, 2008 against the San Francisco Giants at 
AT&T Park eight months following his back surgery. On June 3, 2008, Johnson 
struck out Mike Cameron of the Milwaukee Brewers for career strikeout number 
4,673. With this strikeout Johnson surpassed Roger Clemens for the number 
two spot on the all-time strikeout leaders list.[25] Johnson struck out 
8 in the game but could not get the win as the Diamondbacks lost 7–1. Johnson 
got his 4,700th career strikeout on July 6, 2008.[26] He finished the season 
with an 11–10 record and an ERA of 3.91, recording his 100th career complete 
game in a 2–1 victory over the Colorado Rockies.[27] On December 26, 2008, 
Johnson signed a one-year deal with the San Francisco Giants for a reported 
$8 million, with a possible $2.5 million in performance bonuses and another 
$2.5 million in award bonuses.[28][29] Johnson became the twenty-fourth 
pitcher to reach 300 wins, beating the Washington Nationals (the team that 
he first played for when they were known as the Montreal Expos) on June 
4 at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.[30] He became the seventh left-handed 
pitcher to achieve the 300 win milestone and the fifth pitcher in the last 
50 years to get his 299th and 300th win in consecutive starts, joining 
Warren Spahn, Steve Carlton, Gaylord Perry, and Tom Seaver. Johnson was 
placed on the 60-day disabled list with a torn rotator cuff in his throwing 
shoulder on July 28, 2009.[31] Johnson was activated by the Giants on September 
16, 2009, and assigned to the Giants bullpen.[32] On September 19, 2009, 
Johnson made his first relief appearance in 4 years, facing the Los Angeles 
Dodgers for 3 batters.[33] At age 46, he was at the time the second oldest 
player in Major League Baseball, trailing only Jamie Moyer.[34] On January 
5, 2010, he announced his retirement from professional baseball.[35] The 
Mariners invited Johnson to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 
Seattle Mariners home opener at Safeco Field on April 12, 2010[36] and 
inducted Johnson into the Mariners Hall of Fame on January 17, 2012.[37] 
The Diamondbacks also invited Johnson and former teammate Curt Schilling 
to both throw out the ceremonial first pitches for the Arizona Diamondbacks' 
10th Anniversary of the 2001 World Series team that defeated the New York 
Yankees.[citation needed] Johnson was selected to the Baseball Hall of 
Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2015.[38] The Diamondbacks retired 
his number on August 8, 2015.[39] In the prime of his career, Johnson's 
fastball was sometimes clocked over 100 mph (160 km/h), even as high as 
102 mph (164 km/h) with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm).[40] 
His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed 
hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the 
pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late 
break; hitters often believe they were thrown a fastball until the ball 
breaks just before it crosses home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung 
through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot.[41] Johnson 
dubbed his slider "Mr. Snappy".[42] In later years, his fastball declined 
to the 96 mph (154 km/h) range and his slider clocked at around 87 mph 
(140 km/h). Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like 
a change-up and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs.[43] In a June 27, 
2012, appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) 
was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. "Honestly, Randy Johnson when 
he was good. It's hopeless. It's like a hopeless feeling. The first time 
you face him you feel like he's going to hit you right in the back of the 
neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going to hit you in the back 
of the neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike and you just have 
to trust it's going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn't lose one 
out there and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek." Johnson has four children 
with his wife Lisa: Sammy (born 1994), Tanner (born 1996), Willow (born 
1998), and Alexandria (born 1999). He also has a daughter from a previous 
relationship, Heather Renee Roszell (born 1989).[44] He is a resident of 
Paradise Valley, Arizona.[45] Since retiring from baseball, Johnson has 
pursued a second career as a photographer.[46] Johnson is a Christian. 
Johnson has spoken about his faith saying, "... there's only one way to 
be on this earth, and that's to be a Christian! ... The Lord's given me 
the ability to go out and do the things that I do."[47] In January 2015, 
Johnson became the Assistant to General Manager of the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
During batting practice in 1988, the 6'10" Johnson, then with the Montreal 
Expos, collided head-first with outfielder Tim Raines, prompting his teammate 
to exclaim, "You're a big unit!"[48] The nickname stuck. Throughout much 
of his career, Johnson held the title of tallest player in MLB history. 
Former pitcher Eric Hillman and current pitchers Andrew Sisco, Andrew Brackman, 
and Chris Young have also been measured at 6'10". The title of tallest 
player, as of 2012[update], is held by Johnson's former Diamondback teammate 
Jon Rauch, a relief pitcher who is 6'11". Johnson guest starred in The 
Simpsons episode "Bart Has Two Mommies", which aired on March 19, 2006. 
Johnson appeared in the movie Little Big League, playing himself. Johnson 
also made an appearance in the hit baseball film, "Major League 2". Johnson 
appeared in a "Just For Men" commercial where he had a grey beard and his 
neighbors told him "Your beard is weird." Johnson also appeared in a Right 
Guard commercial where he fired dodgeballs at Kyle Brandt, who represented 
odor. Johnson also appeared in several commercials for Nike in 1998. The 
spots comedically portrayed him taking batting practice (swinging ineptly 
at balls from a pitching machine) in his hope that he would break Roger 
Maris' then-single-season record for home runs. He made a cameo appearance 
in a commercial for MLB 2K9 with teammate Tim Lincecum. Johnson made an 
appearance in a GEICO insurance commercial.[49] Johnson has been featured 
as a playable character in various Backyard Baseball games. Johnson appeared 
in the episode "Control" on Franklin & Bash as himself. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
