Cedar Rapids /ˈsiːdər ˈræpᵻdz/ is the second largest city in Iowa and is 
the county seat of Linn County. The city lies on both banks of the Cedar 
River, 20 miles (32 km) north of Iowa City and 100 miles (160 km) northeast 
of Des Moines, the state's capital and largest city. It is a part of the 
Cedar Rapids/Iowa City Corridor of Linn, Benton, Cedar, Jones, Johnson, 
and Washington counties.[5] Until massive flooding in 2008, the city's 
government was headquartered in the Veterans Memorial Building, near the 
Linn County Courthouse and jail on Mays Island in the Cedar River; Cedar 
Rapids was one of a few cities in the world, along with Paris, France, 
with governmental offices on a municipal island.[6] A flourishing center 
for arts and culture in Eastern Iowa, the city is home to the Cedar Rapids 
Museum of Art, the National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library, the Paramount 
Theatre, Orchestra Iowa, Theatre Cedar Rapids, the African-American Historical 
Museum and Cultural Center of Iowa, and the Iowa Cultural Corridor Alliance. 
Cedar Rapids is an economic hub of the state, located in the core of the 
Interstate 380. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city population 
was 126,326.[7][8] The estimated population of the three-county Metropolitan 
Statistical Area, which includes the nearby cities of Marion and Hiawatha, 
was 255,452 in 2008.[9] Cedar Rapids has been residence to famous figures 
for the United States, including American Gothic painter Grant Wood, journalist 
and historian William L. Shirer, writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten, 
and aerodynamics pioneer Dr. Alexander Lippisch. In the 1990s and 2000s, 
Hollywood would feature several Cedar Rapidians including actors Bobby 
Driscoll, Ashton Kutcher, Elijah Wood, and Ron Livingston. The area has 
also produced a number of professional athletes such as Landon Cassill, 
Ryan Sweeney, Trent Green, Zach Johnson, and Kurt Warner, as well as Mark 
Walter, co-owner and chairman of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. The city 
is also the setting for the musical The Pajama Game and the comedy film 
Cedar Rapids. Cedar Rapids is nicknamed the "City of Five Seasons", for 
the "fifth season", which is time to enjoy the other four.[1] The symbol 
of the five seasons is the Tree of Five Seasons sculpture in downtown along 
the north river bank. The name "Five Seasons" and representations of the 
sculpture appear throughout the city in many forms.[1] The location of 
present-day Cedar Rapids was in the territory of the Fox and Sac tribes. 
The first permanent settler, Osgood Shepherd, arrived in 1838. When Cedar 
Rapids was first established in 1838, William Stone named the town Columbus. 
In 1841 it was resurveyed and renamed by N.B. Brown and his associates. 
They named the town Cedar Rapids for the rapids in the Cedar River at the 
site, and the river itself was named for the large number of red cedar 
trees that grew along its banks.[10] Cedar Rapids was incorporated on January 
15, 1849.[11] Cedar Rapids annexed the community of Kingston in 1870. The 
economic growth of Cedar Rapids increased in 1871 upon the founding of 
the Sinclair meatpacking company. In 2010, the Census Bureau reported Cedar 
Rapids' population as 87.98% white, and 5.58% black.[12] During the Iowa 
flood of 2008, the Cedar River reached a record high of 31.12 feet (9.49 m) 
on June 13, 2008, the previous record was 20 feet (6.1 m) surpassing the 
500-year flood plain. 1,126 city blocks were flooded, or more than 10 square 
miles (26 km2), 561 city blocks were severely damaged, on both banks of 
the Cedar River. This is 14% of the city's total area. There were a total 
of 7,749 flooded properties that had to be evacuated, 5,900 were homes, 
and 310 were city facilities including the City Hall, Central Fire Station, 
Main Public Library, Ground Transportation Center, Public Works building, 
and Animal Control building. It is estimated 1300 or more properties are 
to be demolished in the Cedar Rapids area because of the flood, which caused 
several billions of dollars in damages. More than 4000 members of the Iowa 
National Guard were called up to assist the city. The temporary levies 
became saturated not only with the flood waters but also with additional 
rainfall causing the levies to fail.[13][14] During the flood of 2016, 
remnants of Hurricane Paine from the eastern Pacific Ocean via the Gulf 
of California caused the second highest recorded crest of the Cedar River 
in Cedar Rapids reaching 22 feet (6.7 m) on Tuesday, September 27, 2016.[15][16][17] 
The inundation of southern Minnesota, central and western Wisconsin, and 
northeastern Iowa by Hurricane Paine's remnants began on September 21 and 
22 and continued until the end of September 2016.[18][19][20][21] This 
cresting in Cedar Rapids was below the initial estimate of 25 feet (7.6 m) 
and the revised estimate of 23 feet (7.0 m), but more than 10 feet (3.0 m) 
above the flood stage of 12 feet (3.7 m).[22][23][24] This flood was above 
levels considered to have about a 1 percent chance of occurring in a given 
year.[25][a] More than 5,000 homes were affected including the flooded 
areas around Time Check Park, the Czech Village, and the New Bohemia district 
causing over 5,000 persons to be evacuated.[25][14][26][27] The Cedar Rapids 
Schools did not have school for a week.[28] In 2015, the city of Cedar 
Rapids approved a $625 million flood protection plan over 20 years for 
levee improvements.[25] Although the improvement to the levee system in 
Cedar Rapids had not been completed due to over $80 million in funding 
not appropriated by the United States Congresses of 2014 and 2016 and the 
voting down by local residents of a temporary increase in the local sales 
tax to pay for the levee improvements,[b] these students along with the 
hundreds of thousands of volunteers and 412 Iowa National Guard troops 
filled more than a quarter of a million sand bags in a successful effort 
that prevented any major flooding of the city outside of the evacuation 
zone.[25][29] A 9.8-mile (15.8 km) system of Hesco barriers, earthen berms, 
and over 400,000 sand bags were used to plug the gaps in the levee system.[25][30][31] 
The city of Cedar Rapids purchased additional Hesco barriers from Iowa 
City for $1.4 million.[32] Numerous upstream cities which had been earlier 
affected by the September flooding and mandatory evacuations including 
Charles City, Greene, Manchester, Clarksville, Shell Rock, Vinton, Janesville, 
Cedar Falls and Waterloo sent hundreds of thousands of unused sand bags 
to support efforts in Cedar Rapids and nearby communities.[19][27] The 
remnants of Hurricane Paine did not produce any rain to saturate the temporary 
earth berms and sand bags, which would have greatly increased the likelihood 
of breech in the temporary levee structures and thus causing a much greater 
flooded area; the river crested during very sunny weather in Cedar Rapids. 
Additionally beginning on the evening of Sunday, September 25, 300 to 400 
National Guard troops along with the Iowa State Patrol, other law enforcement 
agencies, and 60 duly sworn law enforcement officials enforced an 8pm to 
7am curfew, nightly.[27][28][29] The city is divided into four quadrants, 
used in addressing. 1st Avenue (U.S. Route 151 Business) divides the north 
and south sides of the city, and the Cedar River divides east and west. 
Mays Island, in the middle of the river, is the only area of the city where 
addresses have no quadrant. Areas outside of the city limit that use the 
"Cedar Rapids" city name on their mailing address also do not use the quadrants. 
Except in the downtown area, 1st Avenue and the Cedar River tend to run 
diagonally instead of along the cardinal directions. Due to the curving 
of 1st Avenue, there are some areas in western Cedar Rapids where NW addresses 
are actually south of SW addresses. Cedar Rapids is divided into fourteen 
ZIP Codes. Mays Island and the downtown area are covered by 52401. The 
northeast quadrant is covered by 52402 and 52411. The southeast quadrant 
is covered by 52403. The southwest quadrant is covered by 52404. The northwest 
quadrant is covered by 52405. Post office boxes are covered by ZIP codes 
52406, 52407, 52408, 52409, and 52410. Several other ZIP codes are for 
specific business (Aegon USA, Rockwell Collins, etc.). According to the 
United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 72.07 square 
miles (186.66 km2), of which, 70.8 square miles (183.37 km2) is land and 
1.27 square miles (3.29 km2) is water.[2] Czech Village is located along 
16th Avenue SW, which is south of the Cedar River. It is home to such Czech-related 
businesses as The Czech Cottage, Sykora Bakery, Al's Red Frog, and Deda 
and Babi's Antiques. The National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library is one 
of the major tourist attractions in Cedar Rapids, and the nearby Bohemian 
National Cemetery may also be of interest to visitors. The National Czech 
& Slovak Museum's main building was located directly on the river and was 
badly damaged by the 2008 floods. 1400 The museum moved a few blocks after 
the flood to Inspiration Pl SW, Cedar Rapids, IA 52404. The Cedar Rapids 
Czech Heritage Foundation is one of many local organizations working to 
promote and preserve Czech heritage in Cedar Rapids. They support and sponsor 
many programs and events throughout the year. One of these programs is 
the Miss Czech-Slovak Iowa pageant. Two Miss Czech-Slovak US queens can 
claim this community as home: Lisa Volesky and Stasia Krivanek. Olga Drahozal 
was the famed band leader of the Czech Plus Polka Band, a performing group 
that frequents the Kosek Band Stand in Czech Village. She, along with Bessie 
Duggena and Leona Poduška, taught Czech School (Česká škola) at Wilson 
Middle School. In 2003, the African-American Historical Museum and Cultural 
Center of Iowa opened its doors. Cedar Rapids is also home to the historic 
26 acre (105,000 m²) Brucemore Estate, on which sits a 21-room mansion, 
and the Masonic Library and Museum. There are twelve active neighborhood 
associations in Cedar Rapids. The neighborhoods nearest downtown include 
Wellington Heights and Oakhill Jackson in the southeast quadrant and Moundview 
in the northeast quadrant. Also farther north in the northeast quadrant 
is the Kenwood Park, which was independent until it was incorporated into 
the Cedar Rapids city limits, and Noelridge Park neighborhood. The boundaries 
of Kenwood are 32nd Street to Oakland Road to Old Marion Road to C Avenue 
to 40th Street then 1st Avenue between 40th street and 32nd Street.[33] 
In addition to the neighborhood associations in Cedar Rapids, there are 
many informal, unofficial neighborhoods, such as Bowman Woods, Vernon Heights, 
Stoney Point, New Bohemia (NewBo) and Wilderness Estates. In 2009, Cedar 
Rapids was rated one of the "Top 10 cities to Grow Up In" in the United 
States, partly due to a low crime rate and a good public school system.[34] 
Cedar Rapids has a humid continental climate with long, cold, sometimes 
brutal winters with plenty of snow, while summers are hot and humid, with 
frequent severe thunderstorms. The record low temperature in Cedar Rapids

U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 4.9% of the Cedar Rapids population identified 
as African Americans, up from 3.7% in the 2000 census.[40][41] Cedar Rapids 
has played an important role in Muslim culture in the United States. The 
National Muslim Cemetery, on 12 acres (49,000 m2) of land donated by Haj. 
Yahya William Aossey in 1948, is said to be the first exclusively Muslim 
cemetery in North America.[citation needed] Graves in the cemetery face 
Mecca.[42] The Mother Mosque of America, dedicated on June 16, 1934, is 
the longest standing mosque in North America.[43][44] In 1972, another 
mosque was built and the original mosque was sold and fell into disrepair 
before being purchased in 1990 by the Islamic Council of Iowa and renovated.[45][46] 
It is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Iowa flood of 2008 
extensively damaged the basement, destroying many historic documents. Muslim 
presence in the area dates to 1895 when the first immigrants arrived from 
the Beqaa Valley in today's Lebanon and Syria.[47] Islamic Services of 
America (I.S.A.) was established in Cedar Rapids in 1975 and provides Halal 
Certification and supervision throughout the world.[48] Cedar Rapids is

since 1868. It has many facilities including Camp Wapsie.[57] From April 
6, 1908, to December 31, 2005, Cedar Rapids used the city commission form 
of government. It was one of the few larger American cities remaining to 
operate under this model. Under this form of government, the council was 
made up of a public safety commissioner, a streets commissioner, a finance 
commissioner, a parks commissioner, and a mayor. The council members worked 
on a full-time basis, served two-year terms, and were considered department 
heads. Don Canney, the longest serving mayor in city history, served for 
twenty-two years under this system.[59] The last mayor of Cedar Rapids 
under this form of government was Paul Pate. In 2005 the Cedar Rapids Area 
Chamber of Commerce spearheaded a movement to change from the commission 
form of government. A panel was appointed by Mayor Pate and the City Council 
to study the issue, and recommended that voters be presented with three 
options: On June 14, 2005, voters went to the polls to decide whether to 
adopt a new form of government or continue with the commission form. 28,818 
of the 83,514 registered voters (29.72%) cast ballots on the issue. 68.80% 
of the voters decided to adopt a new form of government.[60] Elections 
were held on November 8, 2005 and 30 candidates ran. Kay Halloran, a retired 
attorney and state legislator, became the first mayor elected under the 
new system. Several members of the city council were elected outright; 
however, the remaining races were close enough to require a runoff election, 
which took place in December. Cedar Rapids now has an Iowa "Home Rule" 
charter which establishes a weak mayor system with a part-time City Council 
and Mayor both on four-year terms.[61] Cedar Rapids is home to two four-year 
colleges: Coe College and Mount Mercy University. The University of Iowa

naive insurance agent, played by Ed Helms, who is sent to represent his 
company at a regional conference in big town Cedar Rapids.[78] Although 
the film is set in Cedar Rapids, it was actually mostly shot in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, although exterior shots were done in Cedar Rapids.[79] Released 
on February 26, 2010,The Crazies is a 2010 film which fictionally takes 
place near Cedar Rapids at Odgen Marsh, Iowa. In the film, residents both 
in and near Ogden Marsh become infected with a "Rhabdoviridae prototype" 
biological weapon called Trixie. At the end of the movie, David and Judy, 
who are unaffected victims within the affected area, arrive at a truck 
stop to search for a vehicle but discover that the National Guard have 
also executed those who were evacuated. Fending off three Trixie infected 
persons, they escape in a semi-truck. In order to stop the infection from 
spreading, the National Guard destoys Ogden Marsh in a massive explosion. 
As the couple flees, their truck flips in the passing shockwave. They then 
exit their wrecked semi and begin walking towards Cedar Rapids. A view 
from a military satellite highlights first the couple, then the city of 
Cedar Rapids. The words "Initiate containment protocol" appear, signifying 
a new containment attempt by the National Guard. Later, during the credits, 
Bruce Aune, a real newscaster from KCRG-TV 9 in Cedar Rapids reports that 
an explosion originating from the Dakon Pendrill chemical plant started 
a massive fire in Ogden Marsh which is merely a cover story for the National 
Guard's actual destruction of the town. Bruce Aune then reports that a 
perimeter has been set and civilians are not being allowed into the area. 
A Trixie-infected individual appears on camera just before the signal is 
lost.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87] Cedar Rapids is served by The Eastern
