Juan Alberto González Vázquez (born October 20, 1969), nicknamed "Igor", 
is a former Major League Baseball right fielder. During his 16 years in 
the league, González played for five teams, but is more remembered for 
his two stints with the Texas Rangers (1989–1999, 2002–2003). One of the 
premier run producers and most feared hitters of the 1990s, González averaged 
37 HR and 117 runs batted in per season from 1991 to 1999. He won the AL 
MVP award twice in that time span, 1996 and 1998.[1] Gonzalez was known 
as a screaming line drive hitter, not a majestic fly-ball hitter as were 
many power hitters of the 1990s.[2] He was a full-time player at the age 
of 21 and a two-time MVP before his 30th birthday. González explained his 
propensity for bringing runners home by saying, "I concentrate more when 
I see men on base." González grew up in a rough area of Puerto Rico, where 
he learned to hit bottlecaps and corks with a broomstick handle in the 
Alto de Cuba barrio.[citation needed] In the Puerto Rico youth league, 
González batted cleanup behind future Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams, 
where both competed against González's future teammate Iván Rodríguez.[3] 
When the Yankees scouted Williams, eventually signing him, they declined 
to pursue González, who they perceived as not serious about baseball.[4] 
The Texas Rangers signed González as an amateur free agent on May 30, 1986, 
at the age of 16. Juan has always wanted to serve as a role model for the 
kids of Puerto Rico, as they are faced with the downfalls of drugs and 
prostitution frequently. Gonzalez avoided such temptations growing up. 
His father, a math teacher, and mother, a housewife, made sure Gonzalez 
and his two sisters behaved properly and stayed away from negative influences. 
Gonzalez moved his family out of the barrio early in his MLB career. He 
paid utility bills for down-on-their-luck friends and plans on working 
to construct recreation facilities and a baseball diamond in his home town. 
One of Juan's managers, Johnny Oates, believed that until you've walked 
where Juan Gonzalez has walked, you just won't understand. Speaking from 
experience, as Oates has walked the streets of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, 
during visits multiple times, he had this to say: "I don't think you can 
appreciate how far he's come until you've been there", Oates said. "We 
might be making choices between going to the movies or going to the skating 
rink. But look at the choices the kids there were faced with growing up 
– do you want to do drugs or get beaten up? I think it says so much about 
him that he was able to rise above the peer pressure in Vega Baja. He had 
enough intelligence to say, 'I don't want to do that.'"[5] In Puerto Rico 
he is known as "Igor", the nickname he has carried since he was a nine-year-old 
fascinated by the professional wrestler "Igor the Magnificent." "I watched 
wrestling all the time and I still like it", Gonzalez said. "One day when 
I was nine, I told another guy, 'I'm Igor.' And he said,'Okay, your name 
is Igor from now on.' And I've been Igor since then."[6] González debuted 
with the 1986 GCL Rangers and finished with .240 batting average, .303 
on-base percentage, and a .266 slugging percentage in 60 games. He only 
had five extra-base hits (none of them home runs) in 233 AB and struck 
out 57 times. He tied Harvey Pulliam by grounding into a Gulf Coast League-leading 
9 double plays. In 1987, González showed some improvement with the Gastonia 
Rangers, though Mark Whiten and Junior Felix were deemed better outfield 
prospects in the South Atlantic League. In ratings by Baseball America, 
Gonzalez tied Ryan Bowen for 10th place on the prospect listing. He finished 
with .265 AVG, .306 OBP, and .401 slugging percentage with 14 home runs 
and 74 RBI. Gonzalez spent 1988 with the Charlotte Rangers and batted .256/~.327/.415 
with 8 home runs in 277 AB. One of his outfield teammates that year was 
Sammy Sosa. The next year, he showed more improvement with the Tulsa Drillers 
hitting .293/~.322/.506 with 21 home runs and led the Texas League with 
254 total bases. He outhomered Sosa by 14 and was third in the League in 
home runs, behind teammate Dean Palmer (25) and Chris Cron (22). Gonzalez 
was rated the league's No. 4 prospect by Baseball America, behind Ray Lankford, 
Andy Benes and José Offerman. Lankford and Warren Newson joined him in 
the TL All-Star outfield. He was called up by the Texas Rangers in September 
of that year, but only hit .150/.227/.250. During his time with the Rangers 
that year, Gonzalez only hit 1 HR. That HR was the first HR ever hit by 
a teenager (19 yrs old) for the Rangers. In 1990, González – playing with 
the Oklahoma City 89ers – led the American Association in home runs (29), 
RBI (101) and total bases (252). He made the AA All-Star outfield alongside 
Lankford and Bernard Gilkey and was named the league MVP. Baseball America 
named him the top prospect in the league in a poll of managers. He finished 
with .258/~.343/.508 for the 89ers. In the AAA All-Star Game, González 
hit 4th for the AL prospects and played as a designated hitter. He went 
2 for 5 with a double, one of the game's two homers, two runs and two RBI 
in the AL's 8–5 loss. González was again called up by the Rangers and did 
far better this time, batting .289/.316/.522. In 1991, Texas gave González 
a chance to be an everyday player. He batted .264 while hitting 27 home 
runs and recording 102 runs batted in (RBIs). González came up as a center 
fielder, as did teammate Sammy Sosa; but the Rangers opted to keep González 
and trade Sosa. Gonzalez split his time in the OF between CF (93 games) 
and LF (92 games). González thrilled the club in his first full season 
at the young age of 21, as his 27 HR's led the Rangers. His 102 RBI was 
good enough for 2nd on the club, and 7th in the AL. Two of those HR's were 
Walk-Off's for the young González. The first coming off Steve Searcy and 
the Tigers on May 15, the second off Rick Honeycutt and the Athletics on 
October 6. In 1992, González finished with a .260 batting average, 43 home 
runs, and 109 RBIs. Juan spent most of his time in CF in '92, playing 123 
games there, 31 in LF and making just one appearance in RF, while DH-ing 
4 games. Juan was the American League home run champion (one more than 
Mark McGwire) while also ranking 3rd in TB (309), 4th in Extra Base Hits 
(69), 5th in SLG (.529%), 7th in RBIs (109) while winning his first Silver 
Slugger Award. Winning the HR Crown at the age of 22 made him the youngest 
player to lead the majors since Johnny Bench in 1970. In 1993, González 
broke through to true stardom. He led the AL for the second consecutive 
year with 46 bombs, while raising his batting average an impressive 50 
points to .310, all this to go along with a league-leading slugging percentage 
of .632%. That production garnered González an invite to his first All-Star 
team. During the 1993 All-Star Weekend, he participated in the only Home 
Run Derby of his career. Juan and Ken Griffey, Jr. put on an amazing display 
of raw-power, as they each golfed 7 homers a piece. Gonzalez, however, 
wowed the national audience even more, becoming the first player to hit 
a homer into the facade of the upper deck in left field (estimated 473 
feet) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and the green wall behind the center-field 
fence (estimated 455 feet).[2] Gonzalez then defeated Griffey in a winner-take-all 
playoff for the individual Home Run Derby title, 5–4. When asked about 
the title, Gonzalez responded: "It was very exciting to surprise everybody. 
I never thought in my mind that I'd win the Home Run Derby. I even surprised 
myself."[6] Juan also finished fourth in voting for the 1993 AL MVP and 
earned his second consecutive Silver Slugger Award. In 1994, the Rangers 
moved from Arlington Stadium to The Ballpark in Arlington. González batted 
19 home runs in 1994 due to injuries, but belted 27 home runs in 1995, 
in just 90 games. From 1995–98, González was an RBI machine, averaging 
more than an RBI per game (514 RBI, 511 G). This made him the first player 
since World War II to drive in a run per game for any four-year period. 
He won two MVP awards in this stretch (1996 and 1998). The New Bill James 
Historical Baseball Abstract listed him as the player who had the highest 
ratio of slugging percentage to on-base percentage in baseball history 
at that time, ahead of Dave Kingman and Tony Armas and 4th in RBI per game 
by an outfielder (behind Sam Thompson, Joe DiMaggio and Babe Ruth). James 
also ranked González as the 52nd-best right fielder in baseball history 
as of mid-2000. In 1996, González had one of his best seasons hitting .314 
with a .643 slugging percentage. He edged Alex Rodríguez by one first-place 
vote (11–10) and 3 award points (290–287) in a very close vote to win the 
American League MVP.[7] He won his third Silver Slugger as an outfielder 
and was second in the AL in slugging (87 points behind McGwire). Was selected 
to the Associated Press Major League All-Star Team and The Sporting News 
A.L. All-Star squad at season's end. González was also named the Puerto 
Rico Pro Athlete of the Year by Associated Press and the DFW Metroplex 
Pro Athlete of the Year by the Dallas All Sports Association. He received 
the honorable selection of American League Player of the Month in July, 
leading the majors in batting (.407), homers (15), rbi (38), slugging (.917) 
and total bases (99). González was also the A.L. Player of the Week for 
July 29 – August 4. González had a pair of 21-game hitting streaks, June 
25 – July 19 and August 8–31, matching the 3rd longest hitting streaks 
in team history with Mickey Rivers (1980) being the only other Ranger with 
2 20-game hitting streaks in the same season. On July 30, González went 
5–5 vs. New York, a career best and tied the club record for hits in a 
game. González was also chosen as a member of the Major League Baseball 
All-Star Team that traveled to Japan for 8-game exhibition series in November, 
batting .500 (10–20) with one homer and 3 rbi in 7 games.[8] That year, 
the Texas Rangers made the playoffs, and in the 1996 American League Division 
Series, González homered five times in four games and batted .438/.526/1.375 
with 9 RBI. Texas ended up losing in four games to the New York Yankees. 
González tied Jeffrey Leonard's 1987 NLCS record by homering in four straight 
post-season games and joined Reggie Jackson and Ken Griffey, Jr. as the 
only players to hit five home runs in a single post-season series.[3] Gonzalez, 
however, accomplished this feet in less games (4) than Leonard, Jackson 
and Griffey Jr; all of whom needed at least 5 games to accomplish said 
feat. Combining the regular season and postseason, González hit .315 with 
52 home runs, 153 RBIs, and .664 slugging percentage in 1996. In 1997, 
González batted .296/.335/.589 as a DH-RF for the Rangers, winning his 
fourth Silver Slugger. In 133 games he was 4th in slugging, 6th in total 
bases (314), third in homers (42) and RBI (131), 10th in extra-base hits 
(69) and tied for 6th with 10 sacrifice flies. González missed the first 
month of the season and was not activated from the DL until May 2 due to 
a torn ligament in his left thumb. Despite the injury he still managed 
to earn American League Player of the Month honors in September (.337, 
10 hr, 26 rbi) and was the Rangers Player of the Month in both August and 
September. González was selected to Baseball America's American League 
All-Star Team. In 1998, he reached the 100 RBI mark before the All-Star 
break (101), being the first player (and still most recent) to do so since 
Hank Greenberg 63 years earlier.[3] He hit cleanup for the AL in the 1998 
All-Star Game and decisively won the AL MVP award. González was 10th in 
the 1998 AL in batting average, second in slugging, fourth in OPS, 6th 
in hits (193), 4th in total bases (382), first in doubles (50), tied for 
fourth in home runs (45), first in RBI (157) in 154 games, tied for 8th 
in OPS+ (149), second in extra-base hits (97), tied for third in sac flies 
(11), tied for sixth in intentional walks (9) and tied for third in double 
plays ground into (20). In April, he drove in 35 runs, a major league record 
for the month that still stands today. González produced the 5th season 
ever of at least 50 doubles and 40 home runs. González started 115 games 
in Right and 36 as the DH. Became the 1st 5-time winner of the Rangers 
Player of the Year Award and was also named as the A.L.'s Most Valuable 
Player by USA Today and USA Today Baseball Weekly. González was selected 
to major league all-star teams selected by the Associated Press (OF) and 
Baseball America (DH) and to the Sporting News A.L. all-star squad (OF). 
He was named as an outfielder on the A.L. Silver Slugger Award team for 
the 5th time in his career, his 3rd consecutive year. González shared Rangers 
Player of the Month honors with Iván Rodríguez in April and won the award 
outright in May. González also received the American League Player of the 
Week, for August 31 – September 6. He received 21 of 28 1st place mvp votes 
and 7 2nd place votes for 357 total points to defeat Boston's Nomar Garciaparra, 
who had 5 1st place votes and 232 points. Juan also became the 1st native 
of Latin America to ever win multiple MVP's since the award was instituted 
in 1931. This award also made him the 16th player to capture 2 MVP's in 
a 3-year span. The Rangers reached the playoffs, only to be swept by the 
Yankees. The Rangers offense was miserable in the Division Series, scoring 
just one run on a Pudge Rodriguez single that knocked in Juan (who had 
doubled to lead off the inning). In 1999, he was 9th in the AL in average, 
4th in slugging, 6th in OPS, 10th in runs (114), 6th in total bases (338), 
6th in home runs (39), 5th in RBI (128), 7th in extra-base hits (76) and 
2nd in sacrifice flies (12). However, he and the Rangers wound up being 
swept for the second consecutive year by the Yankees in the Division Series. 
Juan wasn't able to do much in the 3-game series, hitting .182/.250/.455 
with 1 HR, but, Juan's solo bomb was the only run the Rangers scored in 
the series. González announced just before the 1999 All-Star Game that 
if the fans did not elect him to the starting lineup, he would refuse an 
invitation to be added to the roster (as a result he was not invited). 
Gonzalez believed that the system was flawed, he thought managers and players 
should vote for the starters, not the fans. A few weeks later Gonzalez 
didn't dress for the Hall of Fame exhibition game because (according to 
the media) the uniform pants the Rangers brought for him were too large. 
Gonzalez later had this to say about the incident "I couldn't play because 
my right wrist was sore. The pants they gave me were size 40. I wear 34. 
They were clown pants."[9] Following the 1999 season, with one year left 
on his contract, the slugger was traded by the Texas Rangers along with 
Danny Patterson and Gregg Zaun in a blockbuster nine-player deal with the 
Detroit Tigers for Frank Catalanotto, Francisco Cordero, Bill Haselman, 
Gabe Kapler, Justin Thompson, and Alan Webb. He became the first two-time 
MVP to be traded since Dale Murphy was sent from Atlanta to Philadelphia 
in 1990. Detroit Tiger general manager Randy Smith was paying a high price 
for Gonzalez by trading six young players, but he couldn't pass up on acquiring 
Gonzalez, who he referred to as "a two-time MVP and future Hall of Famer", 
even though Gonzalez would more than likely be a one-year rental (and was). 
Gambling that they would be able to extend his contract past the 2000 season, 
the Tigers reportedly offered Gonzalez an eight-year, $140 million contract 
soon after the deal was struck. Gonzalez refused, which turned out to be 
the bigger gamble. He began the season badly, hobbled by foot pain and 
unable to adjust to the spacious dimensions of Detroit's new Comerica Park, 
where the left-center field fence stood nearly 400 feet from home plate. 
By mid-season he had announced that the Tigers would have to bring the 
fences in if they wanted to re-sign him as a free agent. Detroit shopped 
Gonzalez before the trading deadline, but a deal that would have sent him 
to the Yankees for outfielder Ricky Ledée and two minor leaguers was scuttled 
when the outfielder made it clear that he didn't want to play in New York. 
The Puerto Rico native stumbled through the rest of the season and saw 
his production dip to an all-time low (22 HR, 67 RBI in 115 games). After 
missing the last weeks of the 2000 season, he was granted free agency on 
November 1. On January 9, 2001, he signed a one-year $10 million contract 
with the Cleveland Indians. Gonzalez opened the season with a great start, 
batting .388 (40–103) with 9 homers and 32 RBIs in season's first 25 games 
through May 2. Gonzalez completed the first half on a torrid pace. He was 
voted in as an All-Star starter and batted 5th in the 2001 All-Star Game. 
Gonzalez hit .347 with 23 HR 83 RBI in 79 games (.640 SLG% / 1.031 OPS%) 
in the first half. He appeared to be on his way to easily capturing the 
RBI title, but an RBI drought at the end of the season (0 RBI in last 10 
games) allowed Bret Boone to pass him by one. Gonzalez hit over .300 in 
each of season's 1st 5 months before dropping to .299 for the month of 
September. His top months were .387 (36–93) in April and .356 (26–73) in 
July. Gonzalez was hitting as high as .360 on June 5, then went 17–64 (.266) 
in next 17 contests, dropping to .338 through June 26. Had a .351 (73–208) 
mark in next 56 games and was at .344 overall, 2nd in the A.L., through 
September 9. After this he hit just .130 (6–46) in final 13 games, going 
3–34 (.088) in last 10 contests. Gonzalez was hitless in his final 15 trips 
after his single on September 24. Despite his cold streak over the last 
week and a half of the season, he still finished with a .325 BA /.370 OBP/.590 
SLG% and an 147 OPS+ close to his MVP seasons. He also won his sixth Silver 
Slugger and finished fifth in MVP voting. His .325 average was one point 
shy of his career high (1999) and marked his 5th .300 season, 3rd in the 
last 4 years. He was sixth in the 2001 AL in batting average, 5th in slugging, 
6th in OPS, 9th in home runs (35), second in RBI (140, (in 140 games) one 
behind leader Bret Boone),8th in OPS+, tied for third in double plays grounded 
into (18) and led the league with 16 sacrifice flies. Gonzalez was also 
a 2nd team selection on Baseball America's Major League all-star squad 
and was named as the Indians player of the year by Baseball America. This 
proved to be the last season in which Gonzalez averaged an RBI a game. 
Although Gonzalez finished the regular season rather slowly, he showed 
up in a big way in the playoffs where he hit .348 BA/.348 OBP /.739 SLG 
for Cleveland in the Division Series with 3 doubles, 2 homers and 5 RBI 
in 5 games. Despite this Cleveland still fell in defeat. Gonzalez had a 
season best 15-game hitting streak from August 29 – September 19 at .345 
(20–58) and hit safely in 10 straight games from April 17–27. Gonzalez 
also had a 4 hit game April 11 at the Chicago White Sox. Gonzalez batted 
.368 (43–117) vs. left-handers, 3rd best in the A.L. and had a .335 (53–158) 
mark with runners in scoring position, the 8th highest. As the DH, he hit 
.392 (31–79), this was the highest average in A.L. among players with 35 
or more DH at bats, with 8 homers and 33 rbi in 21 games. Through 11 full 
major league seasons ('91-2001), González had 392 homers and 1263 RBI, 
an average of 36 homers and 115 RBI per year. Juan's 1263 RBI total was 
the most in MLB in during that time frame by 40, despite having 1,000 less 
Plate Appearances than #2 man, Jeff Bagwell On January 8, 2002, González 
made his return to Arlington by signing a two-year $24 million contract 
with the Texas Rangers. He hit .282/.324/.451 (94 OPS+) the first year 
in 70 games. On June 18, he participated in the first MLB game ever with 
four players with 400+ home runs to that point. Rafael Palmeiro and Fred 
McGriff joined Sosa and Gonzalez in a game which Texas lost to the Chicago 
Cubs, 4–3. His first season back in Arlington he had a .358 (29–81) average 
versus Lefties and hit .328 (21–64) with runners in scoring position while 
posting a .307 mark(42–137) in Arlington. He hit just .171 (6–35) with 
2 homers and 4 RBI as the DH. He had Texas' only hit, a leadoff double 
in the 8th, off Cory Lidle on July 19 at Oakland. In 2003, Gonzalez started 
the first few weeks rather slowly. He had a .230 average with 4 homers 
and 8 RBI in his 1st 18 games through April 20. He quickly picked it up 
though and went on a .349 (29–83) tear with 9 homers and 24 RBI in his 
next 21 games, improving to .293 by May 5. As of May 7, Gonzalez was tied 
for the Major League Lead in HR with 12. He followed that up by going just 
8-for-39 (.205) in his next 9 games, falling to .276 through May 25. He 
started a hot streak yet again though by hitting .321 (42–131) with 10 
homers and 36 RBI in the next 34 games. But his season was cut short by 
a tear in his calf muscle on July 19. At the time, Gonzalez was hitting 
.294 and ranked 3rd in HR (24) 4th in SLG% (.572) and 7th in RBI (70) in 
the AL. Gonzalez was on pace to recapture his 2001 Indians form, but the 
tear lingered and the injury proved to be the end of his season. Gonzalez 
hit 2 homers in a game 4 times: April 5 vs. Seattle; April 29 and May 1 
at Toronto and July 10 against Minnesota. Juan's 47 career multi-homer 
games are 12th most all-time. He also hammered 5 homers in 3 games, April 
29 – May 1 at Toronto, the 4th time in Rangers history that feat had been 
accomplished. He had a season best 5 RBI on April 29 at Toronto and drove 
in 4 runs in a game on 3 occasions. Gonzalez had 18 RBI in a 9-game span, 
April 22 – May 1, including 10 in 3-game series at Toronto, April 29 – 
May 1. He was selected as A.L. co-player of the week for April 28 – May 
4. He also had a season high 9-game hitting streak, June 3–17. He started 
57 games in right field and 24 games as the designated hitter. He did not 
make an error in 108 total chances in the outfield and was tied for 6th 
in the league in outfield assists (10), despite his short season. He ranked 
5th on the club in home runs (24), and completed his 11th season with 20 
or more home runs. The Rangers, however, were preparing for a youth movement 
and on October 26, 2003, he was granted free agency. On January 6, 2004, 
González was signed by the Kansas City Royals. However, his back worsened 
in the middle of May and his season came to an end. He ended up hitting 
.276/.326/.441 in 33 games. His $4.5 million deal was one of the largest 
on the club so on October 28 of the same year, the Royals granted free 
agency.[10] He was signed by the Cleveland Indians for the 2005 season, 
and was activated in May. Despite a thorough workout regimen, Gonzalez 
suffered a major hamstring injury (he tore his right medial hamstring totally 
off the bone at the knee joint) in his first plate appearance of the season 
while running out a grounder. This put him out for the season after just 
one at-bat. González signed on with the independent Atlantic League in 
2006, playing for the Long Island Ducks. He hit .323/.377/.515 in 36 games, 
with 6 HR and 23 RBI. His time was again limited by injuries. The St. Louis 
Cardinals invited Gonzalez to spring training prior to the 2008 season.[11] 
He was one of 26 non-roster invitees, participating in full roster workouts 
that began on February 19, 2008.[12] He hit .308 with a .462 SLG% in spring 
training with 1 home run, 1 double and 5 RBI in 9 games. However, he was 
put on the inactive list with an abdominal strain and he returned to Puerto 
Rico with an invitation to rejoin the Cardinals once he was healthy. Gonzalez 
decided to stay in Puerto Rico, and did not rejoin the Cardinals.[13] In 
June 2013, Juan was invited to become a member of the Texas Rangers Hall 
of Fame. However, he declined the invitation.[14] On July 11, 2015 Juan 
was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. González is the Rangers' 
all-time leader with 372 home runs, 1,180 RBIs and a .565 slugging percentage. 
His 157 RBIs in 1998 and .643 slugging percentage in 1996 are also club 
records. González ranks in the top 5 in club history in most every other 
major offensive category.[15] In the 1989–1990 Puerto Rican Professional 
Baseball League, González hit .269/~.345/.500 for the Criollos de Caguas 
and hit 9 home runs, one less than former league leader Greg Vaughn. During 
the 1992–1993 season, he batted .333 for the Santurce Crabbers and won 
the league MVP award despite not playing until after the All-Star break. 
He hit 7 home runs and led the league despite playing in only 66 games. 
González did not accompany Santurce to the 1993 Caribbean Series. The next 
season, he ended up hitting .268 with 7 homers, 3 behind Phil Hiatt. In 
1995, González joined the San Juan Senators for the 1995 Caribbean Series 
and hit .375 with 6 RBI as the Puerto Rican "Dream Team" won the title. 
González hit 5th, between Carlos Delgado and Rubén Sierra on a team that 
also boasted Roberto Alomar, Bernie Williams, Carlos Baerga and Edgar Martínez. 
San Juan outscored their opponents 49–15. During the 2006–2007 Puerto Rican 
League, in 33 games playing for the champion Carolina Giants, González 
hit .281 with 18 RBIs and 4 homers. In 12 playoff games, he batted .369 
with 3 home runs and 5 RBIs. González claims he is healthy and no longer 
feels pain in his legs. He was 10 for 26 (.385) in the 2007 Caribbean Series 
and made the All-Star team at DH. Right now, he is the owner of the baseball 
team in his hometown, Vega Baja, in the Confederative Baseball League in 
Puerto Rico, where he also plays as a DH. Aside from baseball, Juan focuses 
on helping the community in Puerto Rico, with one condition: he doesn't 
want any attention from the media when he becomes involved in a cause.

That is not giving. I help, but I ask them to please not say anything." 
– Gonzalez.[16] For the 2015-2016 season, González served as coach of the 
Double A Vega Baja team, the Caimanes del Melao Melao. However, after a 
3-11 record, he was fired.[17] González was one of several baseball players 
to whom Jose Canseco claims to have given steroid injections, according 
to Canseco's book Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How 
Baseball Got Big.[18] González was also one of many players who were named 
in the Mitchell Report, in regard to a 2001 incident in which a piece of 
team luggage belonging either to González or his personal trainer was found 
to contain then legal (but now illegal) drugs. It is still disputed whether 
or not the bag actually contained steroids. A story ran in the New York 
Daily News that stated the bag contained steroids. According to Gonzalez's 
then trainer, Angel Presinal, the bag contained Soladek (a painkiller), 
Dolo-neurobion (a vitamin B complex used in fighting the flu),and Clenbuterol 
(a stimulant similar to ephedrine, which is believed by some to promote 
muscle tone and weight loss). Gonzalez said the bag was Presinal's, while 
Presinal said the bag was Gonzalez's and that the bag did not contain steroids. 
Gonzalez immediately cut ties with Presinal following the incident.[19] 
Gonzalez has stated that he has never taken steroids, and is in fact a 
vegetarian.[20] "I have nothing to hide", said Gonzalez. "Nothing. And 
I offered to be tested, whenever they wanted. If you have nothing to hide, 
there is nothing to worry [about]", Gonzalez said.[21] González has been 
married four times. He was married to Puerto Rican volleyball player Elaine 
López, sister of fellow major leaguer Javy López, during the early 1990s. 
This marriage broke down when a local newspaper released a cover photo 
of singer Olga Tañón kissing González during a concert in San Juan. A scandal 
followed, with González divorcing Elaine López and marrying Tañón, who 
said she had no idea González was married to Lopez when she kissed him. 
González and Tañon had a daughter together, Gabriela González Tañón, in 
1998. González and Tañon divorced less than two years later. His daughter 
later became one of only fifty people in the world (and the first Puerto 
Rican) ever to have been diagnosed with Sebastian syndrome, a mild blood 
clotting disorder. González has a friendship with George W. Bush which 
began when González debuted with the Texas Rangers who at the time were 
owned by Bush.[22][23] [24] Gonzalez stated that "a friendship that goes 
beyond baseball was created between them" and during his time in office 
Bush invited González to the White House twice.[25] The first of reunions 
took place on April 16, 2001 and the second on December 3, 2007; in this 
reunion he was accompanied by historian Luis Rodriguez Mayoral.[26] The 
discussion lasted thirty-five minutes and involved Gonzalez's future in 
the Major Leagues and other baseball related topics, as well as the happenings 
of their respective careers.[25] During this visit to Washington, D.C. 
Gonzalez was also involved in a meeting with Rudy Giuliani and a visit 
to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in order to visit Puerto Rican soldiers 
that were injured in the Iraq War.[27] After a history of personal setbacks, 
Gonzalez stated in a 2007 interview that his personal life was now in order. 
"I'd rather have health and my family, my relationship with God than money", 
he said. "How many people who can buy whatever they want have committed
