The Baltimore Elite Giants were a professional baseball team that played 
in the Negro leagues from 1920 to 1950. The team was established by Thomas 
T. Wilson, in Nashville, Tennessee as the semi-pro Nashville Standard Giants 
on March 26, 1920. The team was renamed the Elite Giants in 1921, and moved 
to Baltimore, Maryland in 1938, where the team remained for the duration 
of their existence. The team and its fans pronounced the word "Elite" as 
"ee-light".[1] The Nashville Standard Giants were formed as a semi-professional 
all-Negro team in Nashville, Tennessee, on March 26, 1920.[2] The club 
was chartered by Thomas T. Wilson, T. Clay Moore, J. B. Boyd, Marshall 
Garrett, Walter Phillips, W. H. Pettis, J. L. Overton, and R. H. Tabor.[2] 
The team's origins lie in that of two of Nashville's local negro amateur 
baseball teams: the Nashville Maroons (formed in 1909) and the Elites (formed 
in 1913).[2] Their home games were played at Sulphur Dell and Greenwood 
Park, the African American community's local park.[2] The Standard Giants 
welcomed any and all competition, including white-only teams, but played 
independently of any organized leagues until the mid-1920s.[2] The team 
was renamed the Nashville Elite Giants (pronounced EE-light) in 1921.[3] 
That same year, they swept the Montgomery Grey Sox (of the minor league 
Negro Southern League) in a four-game championship series to win the right 
to declare themselves the Southern Colored Champions.[4]They continued 
to play independently until joining the Negro Southern League in 1926.[2] 
Nashville completed its first season in the league with a 15–15 (.500) 
record.[5] In 1929, Nashville was granted an associate membership in the 
Negro National League.[6] The team finished in eighth (last) place with 
a 10–20 (.333) record.[6] That same year, Wilson built a new ballpark for 
his team, Tom Wilson Park, which also served as a spring training site 
for other Negro league teams, as well as white-only minor league teams, 
such as the Southern Association's Nashville Vols.[7] Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, 
and Roy Campanella are known to have played at the park.[7] The 8,000 (or 
4,000)[2] seat facility featured a single-decked, covered grandstand.[7] 
The ballpark was centrally located in Nashville's largest black community, 
known as Trimble Bottom, near the convergence of Second and Forth Avenues, 
just north of the fairgrounds.[2] In 1930, the team gained admission into 
their first organized league, the Negro National League. The Elite Giants 
finished in seventh place with a 39-47 record. The following season, 1931, 
Wilson moved the team to Cleveland, Ohio and renamed the team the Cleveland 
Cubs, remaining in the same league. The team finished in seventh place 
with a 25-28 record. The Negro National League collapsed after the 1931 
season, and the team moved back to Nashville, reverted to being called 
the Elite Giants, and joined the Negro Southern League, where they played 
in 1932. A second incarnation of the Negro National League was formed in 
1933, where the Elite Giants played for the following two seasons. Nashville 
finished the 1933 season in fifth place with a 29-22 record and tied as 
winners of the second half of the season with the Pittsburgh Crawfords. 
Nashville lost a three-game playoff with Pittsburgh for a spot in the league 
championship game. In 1934, the Elite Giants finished in fourth place with 
a 20-28 record. In 1935, the team moved to Columbus, Ohio and became the 
Columbus Elite Giants. They played only one season in Columbus, 1935, finishing 
in fourth place with a 16-17 record. In 1936 the team moved to Washington, 
D.C. and became the Washington Elite Giants. In their first season, they 
finished in fifth place with a 21-24 record. In 1937, the Elites finished 
in third place with a 27-17 record. The team moved again in 1938 to Baltimore, 
Maryland and became the Baltimore Elite Giants. In 1939, the Elites won 
the Negro National Title, defeating the Homestead Grays. In 1948, they 
won the first half, but lost the championship to second half winners, the 
Homestead Grays. In 1949, the Negro National League ceased operations, 
and the Elite Giants joined the Negro American League. In their first season 
with the new league, Baltimore captured the Eastern and Western Division 
titles, earning them a second Negro National Title. In thirteen seasons 
in Baltimore, of the eleven which have available standings, the Elite Giants 
finished in the top three during nine of those seasons. In dire financial 
straits, the club played one final season in 1950 before dissolving. A 
number of future major leaguers wore the uniform of the Elite Giants, including 
Hall of Famers Roy Campanella and Leon Day. Junior Gilliam (1953 National 
League Rookie of the Year), and Joe Black (1952 National League Rookie 
of the Year) were both former 'Elites' and won consecutive Rookie of the
