The 1993 Chicago White Sox season was the White Sox' 94th season. They 
finished with a record of 94-68, good enough for first place in the American 
League West, eight games ahead of the second-place Texas Rangers. However, 
they lost the American League Championship Series in six games to the eventual 
world champion Toronto Blue Jays. It would be the last year the Sox would 
compete in the American League West, as they would join the newly formed 
American League Central in 1994. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]
