Aubrey Lewis Huff III (born December 20, 1976) is an American former professional 
baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays, Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, and 
San Francisco Giants. Huff is 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) tall and weighs 
225 pounds (102 kg). He batted left-handed but threw right-handed. Huff 
attended Vernon College and the University of Miami, where he finished 
his career second in school batting average. He was drafted by the Devil 
Rays in the sixth round in 1998. After a couple years in the minor leagues, 
he debuted with the Devil Rays in 2000. His first full season in the majors 
came in 2001. In 2002, he finished tenth in the American League (AL) in 
batting average. He set a career high in 2003 with 34 home runs and batted 
.311 with 107 runs batted in (RBI). Next season, he batted .297 with 24 
home runs and 104 RBI. In 2005, he was placed on the disabled list for 
the first time in his career, but he batted .261 with 22 home runs and 
92 RBI. During the 2006 season, he was traded to the Astros. In 2007, Huff 
signed a three-year contract with the Orioles. He hit 15 home runs his 
first season with the Orioles, his lowest total since 2001. In 2008, he 
won the Silver Slugger Award for the designated hitter position after batting 
.304 with 32 home runs and a career-high 108 RBI. During the 2009 season, 
he was traded to the Tigers. He became a free agent after the season and 
signed a one-year deal with the Giants. He batted .290 with 26 home runs 
in 2010, reached the playoffs for the first time, and won his first World 
Series. He signed a two-year deal with the Giants in 2011 and hit 12 home 
runs, his lowest total since 2001. In 2012, he was used mostly as a pinch 
hitter and appeared in a career-low 52 games but won his second World Series 
with the Giants. On January 4, 2014, Huff officially announced his retirement 
from baseball and took a position as a baseball color commentator,[1][2] 
but in 2015, he announced coming out of retirement at age 38.[3] Although 
he was born in Marion, Ohio, Huff grew up in Mineral Wells, Texas.[4] When 
he was six years old, his father, Aubrey II, was killed as an innocent 
bystander in a domestic dispute while working as an electrician. That left 
Huff's mother Fonda in charge of raising him and his sister Angela.[5] 
Growing up, Huff regularly practiced baseball in his yard, which had a 
batting cage with lights and a pitching machine. He said, "[My mother bought] 
it more to keep me out of trouble."[6] He grew up rooting for the Texas 
Rangers and frequently attended their games. One of his favorite players 
was Nolan Ryan.[4] Huff initially attended Mineral Wells High School but 
then transferred to Brewer High School when his family moved to Fort Worth.[7] 
Although he was selected to the All-District baseball team in high school, 
he was better known as a basketball player. He graduated in 1995.[8] Huff 
attended Vernon College for two years and was named the Most Valuable Player 
(MVP) of its baseball team in 1996. Huff transferred to the University 
of Miami for his final two years of college baseball. As a junior, he tied 
team single-game records for runs in a game (five against Harvard University 
on March 28) and most doubles in a game (four on May 16 against Georgia 
Tech).[9] As a senior, Huff hit for a .412 batting average, the fourth 
highest single-season average in school history.[a] His .768 slugging percentage 
is the second highest in school history. He also hit 21 home runs (fifth 
in school history) and a school record of 95 runs batted in (RBI). Baseball 
America, The Sporting News and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers 
Association named him a first-team All-American.[9] Huff finished his college 
career with a .400 batting average (second in school history) and a .719 
slugging percentage (third in school history). In 2009, he was inducted 
into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.[9] Huff was the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays' fifth-round selection in the 1998 Major League Baseball 
(MLB) draft.[10] He spent 1998 with the Charleston RiverDogs of the single-A 
South Atlantic League, where he batted .321 with 85 hits, 19 doubles, 13 
home runs, and 54 RBI in 69 games.[11] In 1999, Huff played for the Orlando 
Rays of the double-A Southern League and was named a Southern League postseason 
All-Star.[8] In 133 games with the Rays (tied with three players for fourth 
in the league behind Brady Clark's 138, Brent Abernathy's 136, and Kurt 
Airoso's 134), Huff batted .301 (eighth) with 148 hits (fourth, behind 
Abernathy's 168, Clark's 165, and Tim Giles's 157), 40 doubles (third, 
behind Scott Vieira's 44 and Abernathy's 42), 22 home runs (tied with John 
Curl for second behind Javier Cardona's 26), and 78 RBI (tied with Bry 
Nelson for ninth in the league).[12] Huff began 2000 with the Durham Bulls 
of the triple-A International League. In 108 games, he batted .316 (fifth) 
with 129 hits, 36 doubles (fourth, behind Clark's 41, Ryan Jackson's 38, 
and José Fernández's 37), 20 home runs, and 76 RBI.[13] He was named the 
International League Rookie of the Year and was named to the postseason 
All-Star team.[8] Huff was called up by the Devil Rays at the beginning 
of August to be the starting third baseman after Vinny Castilla suffered 
an injury.[14][15] He had an RBI in his debut on August 2, a 5–3 loss to 
the Cleveland Indians.[16] Two days later, he got his first career hit 
against José Mercedes in a 10–9 loss to the Baltimore Orioles.[17] On August 
10, he had a season-high three RBI by hitting his first career home run, 
a game-winning three-run hit against Jason Ryan in a 10–4 victory over 
the Minnesota Twins.[18] In 39 games, Huff hit .287 with 35 hits, seven 
doubles, four home runs, and 14 RBI.[8] Huff began the 2001 season with 
Durham but was called up on April 13 when Ariel Prieto was sent to the 
minors.[19] He became the starting third baseman on May 11 when Castilla 
was released.[20][21] On June 29, he had three RBI in a 7–5 loss to the 
New York Yankees.[22] Huff was moved from third base to first base on August 
6 following an injury to Steve Cox.[20][23] After batting .243 with 6 home 
runs and 33 RBI in his first 92 games, he was optioned to Durham on August 
23 when Cox came off the disabled list (DL).[20][24] In September, he was 
called up to replace Greg Vaughn as the Devil Rays' designated hitter (DH).[20][25] 
On September 19, he had three hits and five RBI, including a game-winning 
single against David Cone, in a 12–2 victory over the Boston Red Sox.[26] 
He finished the season batting .248 with 102 hits, 25 doubles, eight home 
runs, and 45 RBI in 111 games. In 17 games at Durham, he batted .288 with 
19 hits, six doubles, three home runs, and 10 RBI.[8] Huff missed the first 
month of 2002 with a broken cheekbone and began the season in the minor 
leagues before getting called up on May 28 to replace the struggling Jason 
Tyner on the roster.[27] He started for the rest of the season as a first 
baseman, a third baseman, or a DH.[8] On June 9, he hit a three-run home 
run against Bobby Jones in a 9–6 loss to the San Diego Padres.[28] He hit 
a game-winning two-run home run against Félix Heredia on June 26 in a 4–2 
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.[29] On July 19, he had four hits, including 
a home run against Esteban Loaiza, and three RBI in an 11–8 loss to the 
Blue Jays.[30] On August 5, his three-run home run against Jon Garland 
accounted for all of the Devil Rays' scoring in a 4–3 loss to the Chicago 
White Sox.[31] On August 18, he had three hits and three RBI, including 
a home run against Jeff Suppan, as the Devil Rays defeated the Kansas City 
Royals 8–6.[32] He had a 17-game hitting streak from August 23 to September 
10, the second-longest streak in franchise history at the time (behind 
Quinton McCracken's 18-game streak in 1998) and as of 2012 the third-longest 
(behind Jason Bartlett's 19-game streak in 2009).[33][34] In 113 games, 
Huff finished tenth in the American League (AL) with a .313 batting average 
and had 142 hits, 25 doubles, 23 home runs, and 59 RBI. He led the Devil 
Rays in home runs, marking the first time a player led his team in home 
runs after starting the season in the minors since 1996, when Tony Clark 
led the Detroit Tigers. In 32 games with Durham, he batted .325 with 41 
hits, nine doubles, three home runs, and 20 RBI.[8] On April 26, 2003, 
Huff had four hits in a 10–7 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.[35] After 
playing mostly first and third base in April, he took over from George 
Lombard as the Devil Rays' right fielder for the remainder of the season 
on April 29.[36][37] On May 3, he had the first multihomer game of his 
career by hitting two two-run home runs against Adam Bernero in an 8–6 
victory over the Tigers.[38] He had four hits on June 4 in a 5–2 victory 
over the Chicago Cubs.[39] In the first game of a doubleheader on June

Hideki Matsui's 163), he batted .311 (ninth) with 47 doubles (third behind 
Garret Anderson's and Vernon Wells's 49), 34 home runs (ninth), and 107 
RBI (tied for eighth with Jason Giambi).[45] Huff's single-season totals 
in hits, doubles, home runs, and RBI have been matched by eleven players 
in major league history as of 2012.[8] He was tied for 24th in AL Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) voting along with Esteban Loaiza and Jason Varitek.[46] 
Defensively, he tied with Tim Salmon for the lead in errors by AL right 
fielders with six.[8] In 2004, Huff spent most of the season playing third 
base.[47] On May 12, he had five RBI, including a three-run home run against 
Chan Ho Park, in a 9–8 victory over the Texas Rangers.[48] On May 28, he 
had four hits, three runs scored, and two RBI including a home run against

victory over the Florida Marlins.[53] He saw a streak of 398 consecutive 
games played snapped on August 22 when he was forced to miss a game with 
a minor back injury. He told reporters afterwards, "You guys care more 
about the streak than I do."[54] On August 27, he had four hits in an 8–7 
loss to the Athletics.[55] Four days later, he had three hits, two home 
runs, and four RBI in a 12-inning, 10–6 loss to the Orioles.[56] He had

the season batting .297 with 178 hits, 27 doubles, 29 home runs, and 104 
RBI in 157 games. His average, home runs, and RBI were the highest totals 
among Devil Rays' players.[8] In 2005, Huff spent most of the year in right 
field.[58] On April 18, Huff had four RBI and hit the 100th home run of 
his career, a three-run shot against Jaret Wright in a 19–8 loss to the 
Yankees.[59] He had three hits and four RBI, including a game-winning three-run 
home run against Aaron Sele, on June 3 in a 6–1 victory over the Mariners.[60]

a 7–6 loss to the Orioles.[67] In 148 games, Huff batted .261 with 150 
hits, 26 doubles, 22 home runs, and 92 RBI.[8] For 2006, Huff was moved 
back to third base.[68] He was placed on the disabled list for the first 
time in his career on April 12 with a sprained left knee suffered in a 
collision with Nick Green the day before.[69] On May 4, he was activated 
from the DL.[70] On May 19, he hit his first career walk-off home run against 
Yusmeiro Petit in a 10-inning, 5–4 win over the Marlins.[71] He had three

against Édgar González in a 4–1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.[72] 
On July 9, he hit a three-run home run against Kris Wilson in a 6–5 victory 
over the Yankees.[73] Through July 9, Huff batted .283 with 65 hits, 15 
doubles, 8 home runs, and 28 RBI in 63 games.[8] On July 12, 2006, the 
Houston Astros acquired Huff from Tampa Bay for minor leaguers Mitch Talbot 
and Ben Zobrist.[74] Huff was used at third base for the Astros until August 
1, when he was moved to right field following regular third baseman Morgan 
Ensberg's return from the DL.[68][75][76] In his debut with the Astros 
on July 13, the first game after the All-Star break, Huff had two hits, 
including a three-run home run against Randy Messenger in a 5–1 victory 
over the Marlins.[77] On August 9, he had three hits, two home runs, and 
six RBI in a 14–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.[78] He hit a game-winning 
home run against José Capellán on September 8 in a 4–3 victory over the 
Milwaukee Brewers.[79] In 68 games with Houston, Huff batted .250 with 
56 hits, 10 doubles, 13 home runs, and 38 RBI. He combined to bat .267 
with 121 hits, 25 doubles, 21 home runs, and 66 RBI in 131 games in 2006.[8] 
On October 31, he filed for free agency.[80] On January 3, 2007, Huff officially 
signed a 3-year $20 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[81] He 
began the year getting most of the starts at first base, but in mid-May 
he became the Orioles regular DH as Kevin Millar was moved to first base.[82][83] 
On May 9, he hit a walk-off home run against Brian Stokes to account for 
the game's only scoring in a 10-inning, 1–0 win over Tampa Bay.[84] In 
a 9–7 loss to the Angels on June 29, he hit for the cycle and got his 1000th 
hit and 200th double (both against Kelvim Escobar). He is one of four Orioles 
to hit for the cycle (along with Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken, Jr., and 
Félix Pie) and the first player to do so at Oriole Park at Camden Yards.[85][86][87] 
On August 3, his three-run home run against James Shields accounted for 
all the Orioles' runs in a 3–1 victory over Tampa Bay.[88] On August 14, 
Huff had two hits and five RBI, including a grand slam against Jeff Karstens 
in a 12–0 victory over the Yankees.[89] He had four hits on September 15 
in an 8–3 loss to the Blue Jays.[90] In 151 games, Huff batted .280 with 
154 hits, 34 doubles, 15 home runs, and 72 RBI.[8] Before the 2008 season, 
Huff switched his uniform number from 19 to 17 in honor of his former teammate 
Joe Kennedy, who died during the offseason.[91] He angered fans in the 
offseason when he called Baltimore a "horse----" town when compared to 
Tampa, but he regained fan support by the end of the year by posting one 
of his best seasons.[92][93] He was the Orioles' designated hitter for 
most of the season, although he was moved to third base at the end of August 
following an injury to Melvin Mora.[94][95] On April 2, he hit a two-run 
home run against Matt Garza and a game-winning two-run double against Al 
Reyes in a 9–6 victory over Tampa Bay.[96] On April 8, he had four hits 
and four RBI in an 8–1 victory over the Rangers.[97] On July 3, he had 
three hits, three RBI, and two home runs against Kyle Davies in a 10–7

to July 6 after hitting .345 with three home runs and nine RBIs.[99] On 
August 27, he had three hits and three RBI, including a two-run home run 
against Lance Broadway in an 11–3 victory over the White Sox.[100] Two 
days later, he had two hits, including a three-run home run against Andy 
Sonnanstine in a 10–9 loss to Tampa Bay.[101] He was named the Player of 
the Week again from August 25–31 after batting .478 with two home runs 
and seven RBI.[102] He hit a grand slam against Juan Rincón on September 
8 in a 14–3 victory over Cleveland.[103] In 154 games, Huff batted .304 
with 182 hits (tied with Nick Markakis for 10th in the league), 48 doubles 
(tied with Markakis for third in the league behind Dustin Pedroia's 54 
and Brian Roberts's 51), 33 home runs (tied for eighth with Jason Giambi 
and Josh Hamilton), and 108 RBI (sixth).[104] He finished 16th in AL MVP 
voting and was named "Most Valuable Oriole" by Baltimore sportswriters.[93][105] 
He won the Silver Slugger Award for DH and the Edgar Martínez Award, becoming 
the first Oriole to win the award since Tommy Davis in 1974.[106][107] 
Huff moved to first base in 2009 following the departure of Millar.[108] 
On April 13, he had four hits and three RBI in a 10–9 victory over Texas.[109] 
On April 21, he hit two home runs and had four RBI in a 10–3 victory over 
the White Sox.[110] He hit a game-winning three-run home run against Phil 
Hughes on May 9 in a 12–5 victory over the Yankees.[111] The next day, 
he hit a three-run home run against Joba Chamberlain in a 5–3 loss to the 
Yankees.[112] On June 17, he had three RBI, including a game-winning two-run

Through August 17, Huff batted .253 with 109 hits, 24 doubles, 13 home 
runs, and 72 RBI in 110 games.[8] On August 17, 2009, Huff cleared waivers 
and was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for pitching prospect 
Brett Jacobson.[114] He began his time with the Tigers as the team's DH, 
but in September he only played against right-handed pitchers as Marcus 
Thames began playing against left-handed pitchers.[108][115] He hit his 
first career pinch-hit home run against Jason Frasor on September 14, a 
game-tying three-run hit in a 10-inning, 6–5 victory over Toronto.[116] 
In 40 games with the Tigers, Huff batted .189 with 20 hits, six doubles, 
two home runs, and 13 RBI. His season totals were a .241 batting average, 
129 hits, 30 doubles, 15 home runs, and 85 RBI in 150 games. Following 
the season, Huff filed for free agency.[117] On January 13, 2010, Huff 
signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the San Francisco Giants.[118] 
He spent most of the season playing first base for the Giants, although 
he played left field and right field when Buster Posey played first base 
from May 29 – June 30 and Travis Ishikawa made most of the starts at first 
base from July 3 – August 14.[119][120][121] On April 14, Huff hit his 
first career inside-the-park home run (his first home run with the Giants), 
a game-winning hit against Charlie Morton in a 6–0 victory over the Pirates.[122] 
On June 4, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Zach Duke in 
a 6–4 victory over Pittsburgh.[123] He hit two two-run home runs on June 
13, including a game-winning home run against Vin Mazzaro in a 6–2 victory 
over Oakland.[124] On July 8, he had four RBI and a two-run home run against 
Manny Parra in a 9–3 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.[125] He hit a 
game-winning two-run home run against Blake Hawksworth on August 20 in 
a 6–3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[126] On August 28, he got his 
1,500th career hit against Alex Sanabia in a 10-inning, 10–9 victory over 
the Marlins.[127] In 157 games, Huff batted .290 with 165 hits, 35 doubles, 
26 home runs, and 86 RBI while scoring 100 runs (tied for seventh in the 
league with Brandon Phillips, Martín Prado, and Dan Uggla) for the first 
time in his career.[8][128] Huff finished seventh in the voting for the 
NL MVP award.[129] Huff, in the 11th year of his career, reached the playoffs 
for the first time as the Giants won the NL West. In Game 4 of the NL Division 
Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves, he had a ninth-inning, two-out, 
game-tying RBI single against Mike Dunn in a 3–2 Giants' victory.[130] 
He batted .267 with four hits and one RBI in the series as the Giants defeated 
the Braves in four games.[131] In Game 4 of the NL Championship Series 
(NLCS) against the Philadelphia Phillies, on October 20, he had three hits, 
two runs scored, and an RBI in a 6–5 Giants' victory.[132] He batted .250 
with six hits and three RBI in the series as the Giants defeated the Phillies 
in six games.[131] In Game 1 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers, 
on October 27, he had three hits and an RBI in an 11–7 Giants' victory.[133] 
In Game 4 of the series on October 31, he hit a game-winning two-run home 
run against Tommy Hunter in a 4–0 Giants' victory.[4] He batted .294 with 
five hits, a home run, and four RBI in the series, winning his first World 
Series as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first 
World Series in 56 years.[131] Huff filed for free agency after the 2010 
season, but on November 23, 2010, he re-signed a $22 million contract with 
the Giants for two years with a club option for 2013.[134] Coming off the 
team's 2010 World Series success and his new contract, Huff arrived at 
2011 spring training out of shape.[135][136] He began 2011 in right field 
due to an injury to Cody Ross, but he returned to first base when Ross 
was activated from the disabled list on April 20.[137][138] He drew a pinch-hit, 
game-winning, bases loaded walk on April 30 against John Lannan in a 2–1 
victory over the Washington Nationals.[139] Three days later, he hit a 
game-winning home run against Taylor Buchholz in a 10-inning, 7–6 victory 
over the New York Mets.[140] He had a walk-off RBI single against Brian 
Fuentes on May 20 in a 10-inning, 2–1 victory over Oakland.[141] On June 
2, his wife's birthday, Huff hit three home runs and drove in a career-high 
six runs in the Giants' 12–7 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. He said 
after the game, "[My wife] wanted me to hit her a homer. I hit three. Brownie 
points."[142] Those home runs accounted for a quarter of his season total, 
as his overall production dropped from the previous season.[129] Compared 
to 2010, his batting average dropped 44 points, his homers fell from 26 
to 12, and his walks went from 83 to 47 as he grew impatient.[135] His 
On-base plus slugging (OPS) dropped 215 points to .676, last among Major 
League first baseman in 2011.[129][135][143] Giants' manager Bruce Bochy 
said, "[Huff's] struggles helped cause our struggles"; the Giants failed 
to return to the playoffs in 2011.[135][136] In 2012 spring training, Huff 
competed with Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants' first base job.[144] 
Belt won the job, and Huff opened the season as the Giants' left fielder.[145] 
He had two hits and three RBI on April 13, including a two-run home run 
against Joel Hanrahan in a 5–0 victory over Pittsburgh.[146] On April 21, 
because the Giants did not have any infielders available, Huff was positioned 
at second base for the first time in his career in the ninth inning of 
a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential 
double play situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the 
doubleheader 5–4.[147] After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on 
the 15-day disabled list with anxiety issues.[148] He returned from the 
DL on May 7 but was used mainly as a pinch hitter for the rest of the season.[145][149] 
On June 15, he was placed on the DL with a sprained right knee that he 
suffered jumping over a dugout railing to celebrate Matt Cain's perfect 
game.[150] He returned from the DL on July 28 but was placed on it four 
days later with right knee tendinitis, which kept him out until August 
31.[151][152][153] In 52 games, Huff batted .192 with 15 hits, four doubles, 
one home run, and seven RBI.[8] In the playoffs, Huff was used exclusively 
as a pinch hitter. In 10 games, he had one hit in nine at-bats but won 
his second career World Series as the Giants swept the Tigers in four games.[131][154] 
On November 1, Huff's $10 million club option was declined, making him 
a free agent. He instead earned a $2 million buyout.[155] Huff ranks among 
the top ten in several career and single-season records in the history 
of the Tampa Bay Rays (Devil Rays from 1998–2007) as of 2012. Through 2012, 
he ranks third behind Carl Crawford and B. J. Upton in games played (799), 
at bats (3,028), plate appearances (3,322), hits (870), and doubles (172). 
His .287 batting average ranks fourth (behind Crawford's .296, Fred McGriff's 
.291, and Jason Bartlett's .288), his 128 home runs rank second (behind 
Carlos Peña's 161), his 449 RBI rank third (behind Crawford's 592 and Peña's 
458), and his 400 runs scored rank fifth. He and Delmon Young are the only 
Devil Rays to appear in 162 games in a season. He holds Devil Rays' record 
for hits in a season and doubles in a season, both set in 2003. His batting 
averages in 2002 and 2003 rank sixth and seventh, respectively; his home 
run totals in 2003 and 2004 are tied for third (with Jose Canseco's 1999 
total behind two of Peña's totals) and ninth, respectively; and his RBI 
totals in 2003 and 2004 are fourth and tied for sixth (with Evan Longoria's 
2010 total and McGriff's 1999 total), respectively.[156] Through the 2012 
season, Huff had hit 242 career home runs, tying him for 217th all-time 
with Dusty Baker, Sal Bando, Wally Berger, Roy Campanella, and J. D. Drew.[157] 
In addition to being used as a designated hitter, he has played at five 
different positions in his career: first base, third base, left field, 
right field, and second base.[8] On January 27, 2007, Huff married Barbara 
"Baubi" Heaton. The couple has two sons: Jayce (born September 4, 2008)[158] 
and Jagger (born September 15, 2010).[159] During Huff's playing days, 
they resided in Tampa, Florida, in the off-season.[160] Baubi Huff filed 
for divorce on January 31, 2012.[148] Huff's mother lives in Largo, Florida, 
where she teaches math. His sister, Angela, is a store manager there.[5] 
As of 2015, Huff and his family reside in Carmel Valley, San Diego.[161] 
Huff has several tattoos. A noted Transformers fan, he has the logos of 
the Autobots and Decepticons tattooed on his shoulder blades.[162] On his 
left shoulder, he also has a tattoo of a guitar with his father's name 
under it in memory of his father.[5] During the Giants' 2010 playoff race 
and postseason, Huff became known for wearing a red "rally thong", which 
he joked would help the team win.[163] When he was slumping in 2011, fans 
sent him thongs throughout the season in hopes of improving his performance.[129] 
On January 4, 2014, Huff officially announced his retirement from baseball 
and took a position as a baseball color commentator for the Pac-12 Network.[1][2] 
On March 31, 2014, Huff started co-hosting a morning radio show on Bay 
Area sports radio station 95.7 The Game with Chris Townsend and Ric Bucher 
titled Bucher, Towny and Huff.[164] Huff left the show in August 2014.[165] 
Currently, Huff is working on a comeback to baseball and hopes to join 
a club for MLB Spring training.[3][166] Huff is an assistant baseball coach
