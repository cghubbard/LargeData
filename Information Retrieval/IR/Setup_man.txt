In baseball, a setup man (or set-up man, also sometimes referred to as 
a setup pitcher or setup reliever) is a relief pitcher who regularly pitches 
before the closer. They commonly pitch the eighth inning, with the closer 
pitching the ninth.[1][2] As closers were reduced to one-inning specialists, 
setup men became more prominent.[3] Setup pitchers often come into the 
game with the team losing or the game tied.[4] They are usually the second 
best relief pitcher on a team, behind the closer. After closers became 
one-inning pitchers, primarily in the ninth inning, setup pitchers became 
more highly valued.[5] A pitcher who succeeds in this role is often promoted 
to a closer.[6] Setup men are paid less than closers and mostly make less 
than the average Major League salary.[7] The most common statistic used 
to evaluate relievers, the save, is unkind to setup men. Due to the definition 
of the statistic, setup men are rarely in position to record a save even 
if they pitch well, but they can be charged with a blown save if they pitch 
poorly. The hold statistic was developed to help acknowledge a setup man's 
effectiveness,[8] but it is not an official Major League Baseball statistic. 
Setup men are rarely selected to Major League Baseball All-Star Games, 
with the nod usually going to closers with large save totals.[9] Some setup 
men who have been selected include Brendan Donnelly, Hideki Okajima, Carlos 
Mármol, Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Arthur Rhodes, David Robertson, Tyler 
Clippard, Hong-Chih Kuo, Brett Cecil, Jesse Crain, and Steve Delabar. A 
setup man has never won the Cy Young Award or the Major League Baseball 
Most Valuable Player Award. Francisco Rodriguez, who was a setup pitcher 
for the Anaheim Angels in 2002,[10] tied starting pitcher Randy Johnson's 
Major League Baseball record for wins in a single postseason after recording 
his fifth victory in the 2002 World Series.[11] Tim McCarver wrote that 
the New York Yankees in 1996 "revolutionized baseball" with Mariano Rivera, 
"a middle reliever who should have been on the All-Star team and who was 
a legitimate MVP candidate."[12] He finished third in the voting for the 
American League (AL) Cy Young Award,[13] the highest a setup man has finished. 
That season, Rivera primarily served as a setup pitcher for closer John 
Wetteland, typically pitching in the seventh and eighth inning of games 
before Wetteland pitched in the ninth. Their effectiveness gave the Yankees 
a 70–3 win–loss record that season when leading after six innings.[14] 
McCarver said the Yankees played "six-inning games" that year, with Rivera 
dominating for two innings and Wetteland closing out the victory.[12] Illustrating 
the general trend, both Rivera and Rodriguez were moved to closer soon
