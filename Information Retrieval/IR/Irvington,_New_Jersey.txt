Irvington is a township in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. As 
of the 2010 United States Census, the township had a total population of 
53,926,[10][11][12] having declined by 6,769 (−11.2%) from the 60,695 counted 
in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 323 (−0.5%) from the 
61,018 counted in the 1990 Census.[21] Clinton Township, which included 
what is now Irvington, Maplewood and parts of Newark and South Orange, 
was created on April 14, 1834.[22] The area was known as Camptown until 
the mid-1800s. In 1850, after Stephen Foster published his ballad, Camptown 
Races, residents were concerned that the activities described in the song 
would be associated with their community. The town was renamed, Irvingtown, 
in honor of Washington Irving.[23][24][25] Irvington was incorporated as 
an independent village on March 27, 1874, from portions of Clinton Township.[23] 
What remained of Clinton Township was absorbed into Newark on March 5, 
1902.[22] On March 2, 1898, Irvington was incorporated as a Town, replacing 
Irvington Village.[22] In 1982, the town was one of four Essex County municipalities 
to pass a referendum to become a township, joining 11 municipalities that 
had already made the change, of what would ultimately be more than a dozen 
Essex County municipalities to reclassify themselves as townships in order 
take advantage of federal revenue sharing policies that allocated townships 
a greater share of government aid to municipalities on a per capita basis.[26][27][28][29] 
The 1967 Newark riots hastened an exodus of families from that city, many 
of them moving a few short blocks into neighboring Irvington. Until 1965, 
Irvington was almost exclusively white. By 1980, the town was nearly 40% 
black; by 1990 it was 70%. On July 1, 1980, Fred Bost, the first black 
to serve on the Town Council, was sworn in as East Ward Councilman.[30] 
Michael G. Steele, the town's first black mayor, was elected in 1990, followed 
by Sarah Brockington Bost in 1994. The current Mayor is Tony Vauss.[23] 
According to the United States Census Bureau, Irvington had a total area 
of 2.930 square miles (7.589 km2), including 2.928 square miles (7.584 km2) 
of land and 0.002 square miles (0.005 km2) of water (0.07%).[1][2] Unincorporated 
communities, localities and place names located partially or completely 
within the township include Irving Place.[31] The township is bordered 
by Maplewood to the west, Newark to the east, Hillside to the south, South 
Orange to the northwest, all in Essex County; and by Union to the southwest 
in Union County, New Jersey.[32] At the 2010 United States Census, there

or more residents identifying their ancestry.[41] There were 22,032 households

1980s and has struggled with its aftermath. The township's violent crime 
rate was six times higher than New Jersey overall and the murder rate eight 
times higher than statewide statistics. In 2007, the New Jersey State Police 
reported that Irvington had a violent crime rate of 22.4 incidents per 
1,000 population, the highest of all 15 major urban areas in the state.[42] 
According to the New Jersey State Police Uniform Crime Report for 2013, 
year-to-year between 2012 and 2013, Irvington experienced an overall reduction 
in crime of 9% (from 49.6 to 45.2 incidents per 1,000), with reductions 
coming from overall non-violent crime (18%) and aggravated assault (22%), 
but an increase in the violent crime rate of 16% from 13.1 incidents per 
1,000 to 15.3.[43] Portions of Irvington are part of an Urban Enterprise 
Zone that was one of seven established by legislation in 1996. In addition 
to other benefits to encourage employment within the Zone, shoppers can 
take advantage of a reduced 3½% sales tax rate (versus the 7% rate charged 
statewide) at eligible merchants.[44] In July 2015, the central business 
district surrounding the Springfield Avenue bus stop was designated as 
one of 30 transit villages statewide, qualifying it for incentives for 
revitalization.[45] Irvington is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally 
known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council form 
of municipal government. The mayor and the seven-member council are elected 
in non-partisan elections held every other year on the second Tuesday in 
May to four-year terms of office. The mayor and the three at-large seats 
are elected together and two years later the four ward seats are elected. 
The council selects a president, first vice president and second vice president 
from among its members at a reorganization meeting held after each election.[8] 
The council is the legislative body of the township and needs a ⅔ majority 
to make changes to the budget submitted by the mayor. The mayor is the 
township's chief executive and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day 
operations and submitting a budget, but is not eligible to vote on the 
council and is not required to attend its meetings. As of 2016[update], 
the mayor of Irvington is Tony Vauss, whose term of office ends June 30, 
2018.[3] Members of the Township Council are Council President Charnette

(At-large; 2018), Second Vice President Sandra R. Jones (South Ward; 2016),
