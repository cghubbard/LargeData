Howard Michael Johnson (born November 29, 1960), nicknamed HoJo, is a former 
Major League Baseball switch hitting third baseman. He is best known for 
his career in Major League Baseball, where he played for the Detroit Tigers, 
New York Mets, Colorado Rockies and Chicago Cubs from 1982 to 1995. He 
is third on the Mets' all-time lists for home runs, runs batted in, doubles, 
and stolen bases. He also played for the Rockland Boulders of the Canadian-American 
Association of Professional Baseball. On July 13, 2007, he was promoted 
from his position as the Mets' first base coach to their hitting coach 
which he held until the end of the 2010 season. From 2014 to June 2015, 
he was the hitting coach of the Seattle Mariners after starting 2013 as 
the batting instructor for the Tacoma Rainiers, the Mariners' Triple-A 
affiliate.[1] Johnson was born in Clearwater, Florida, and attended Clearwater 
High School playing baseball as a pitcher. He attended St. Petersburg Junior 
College and, at age 17, was drafted in the 23rd round of the 1978 Major 
League Baseball Draft by the New York Yankees. Johnson did not sign with 
the Yankees and, the following January, he was drafted in the 1st round 
— 12th overall — by the Tigers. In the minor leagues, the Tigers soon converted 
Johnson from a pitcher to an infielder[2] and, in 1981, he hit 22 home 
runs for the AA Birmingham Barons. He was promoted all the way to Detroit 
to start 1982 but was hitting only .188 in early May when he was sent back 
to AAA.[3] He was back in the majors in mid-August and posted fantastic 
numbers for the rest of the season, including a .405 average in September 
which raised his final average to .316. He started 1983 with the big club 
but was sent down again in late May with a .212 average. In 1984, Johnson 
was back with the Tigers and was made the left side of a platoon with Tom 
Brookens. Johnson started fairly well but had a poor second half.[4] The 
Tigers led the division for the entire season but Johnson sat the bench 
for the entire 1984 ALCS while Brookens, Marty Castillo and Darrell Evans 
split time at third.[5] Johnson wound up pinch-hitting only once in the 
1984 World Series, reaching on an error by second baseman Alan Wiggins 
as the Tigers eased through the postseason en route to the world championship.[6] 
After the season, Detroit traded Johnson to the New York Mets for pitcher 
Walt Terrell. The move put three players at third base for the Mets but, 
three days later, they sent Hubie Brooks to the Montreal Expos as part 
of a trade for catcher Gary Carter.[7] Johnson's inability to hit well 
from the right side resulted in him being platooned by the Mets in 1985, 
this time with Ray Knight. Both started terribly and neither reached .200 
until early July. Johnson hit below average all season while Knight was 
even worse. The Mets, as they had in 1984, narrowly missed the postseason 
in 1985. 1986 was the year of the Mets and both Johnson and Knight started 
very well. The Mets' problems shifted from third base to shortstop as Rafael 
Santana struggled to keep his average above .150 most of the season. Johnson 
was a capable shortstop defensively and picked up extra playing time moving 
between short and third but his hitting started declining in May. Between 
his mediocre hitting, continued lack of power, and an injury that wiped 
out three weeks in June, Johnson played in only 88 games in the regular 
season. When he returned from the June injury, Johnson went on a home run 
tear including two in his first game back and, within six weeks, his slugging 
average jumped from .376 to .510. One of Johnson's home runs occurred in 
a legendary game on July 22, 1986 against the Cincinnati Reds. When a tenth-inning 
bench-clearing fight ended, three Mets players were out of the game and 
they were forced to spend the rest of the game with a pitcher in the outfield 
and two pitchers in the batting lineup. When one of the pitchers, Jesse 
Orosco, drew a walk in the fourteenth inning, Johnson followed with a three-run 
home run which led to a Mets win. Johnson faded down the stretch and was 
virtually shut out of the postseason, going 0-for-7 in four games combined. 
His only start was Game 2 of the 1986 World Series when he went 0-for-4 
in a crucial Mets loss that put them in an 0–2 hole. His only other at 
bat in the series was in Game 6 when he struck out in the ninth inning. 
Nevertheless, at age 25, Johnson already had his second World Series ring. 
Ray Knight was allowed to become a free agent after the 1986 World Series. 
Johnson, given sole ownership of the third base position, began a three-month 
power surge in mid-May. In ten games, he hit five home runs, including 
a pair of three-run shots, with thirteen RBI. In an eleven-game span a 
month later, he hit another six home runs with ten more RBI. In seven games 
around the All-Star break, he hit another six home runs and seven RBIs 
raising his slugging average over .520. With his 22nd home run in mid-July, 
the previously light-hitting Johnson took over the team home run lead from 
Darryl Strawberry, all the while hitting from the seventh spot in the batting 
order. He ended July with six RBIs in seven games along with a four-hit 
game and then started August with a grand slam. In a thirteen-game span 
in late July and early August, he had at least one RBI in all but one game 
and amassed an amazing seventeen RBIs overall. Three games in mid-August 
brought another three home runs and seven RBIs but the power tear was about 
over for his breakout season. Johnson's power surge was complemented by 
a surge in speed. While he had 31 stolen bases in five previous seasons, 
on September 11, 1987, Johnson stole his 30th base to join the 30–30 club 
for the first time. He and Strawberry became the only teammates to achieve 
30–30 status in the same season. Another grand slam in September brought 
Johnson's home run total to 36, just four shy of his entire career before 
1987. Unfortunately for the Mets, as Johnson's power faded, so did their 
run at the postseason and the defending World Champions missed the playoffs. 
The entire league took notice of Johnson's unexpected rise in 1987 and 
he received 42 points in the voting for National League MVP. His home run 
and RBI totals were second only to Strawberry on the team and his home 
runs were seventh-best in the entire majors. His right-handed hitting was 
substantially better than his left-handed hitting with numbers better in 
almost every category including a batting average 36 points higher and 
slugging 74 points higher. His 36 home runs overall were the most in National 
League history by a switch-hitter, breaking Ripper Collins' 53-year-old 
record. In 1988, Johnson did not nearly live up to his stellar 1987 season, 
but still showed decent home run power. He reverted to hitting much better 
from the left side with a .183 average and .338 slugging from the right 
side. A mid-season injury to his right shoulder contributed to his poor 
offense. One bright spot was September 8, 1988 when he had the only five-hit 
game of his career, going 5-for-5 with a three-run home run and four RBIs 
in a Wrigley Field victory. While Johnson was struggling to stay above 
.230, the Mets tried out 21-year-old third base prospect, Gregg Jefferies, 
who blazed through September. After thirteen games, Jefferies, who was 
also a switch hitter, had a batting average of .462 and a fantastic slugging 
percentage of .962 with five home runs, a four-hit game and four three-hit 
games. Despite Johnson's mediocre season, the Mets easily coasted to a 
division win but Johnson went 1-for-18 with six strikeouts in the 1988 
NLCS. With the heavily favored Mets down 3–2 in the series, he was benched 
for Games 6 and 7 in favor of Jefferies. Johnson pinch-hit in Game 7 and 
struck out for the final out of the Mets disappointing season. With Johnson 
and Jefferies competing for the third base job, the 1988–89 off-season 
was filled with trade rumors. The logjam was cleared when second baseman 
Wally Backman was traded to the Minnesota Twins making Jefferies the Mets' 
regular second baseman in 1989. Johnson was moved from sixth or seventh 
in the lineup to third, in front of star slugger Darryl Strawberry, who 
had led the N.L. in home runs and slugging in 1988. The Mets were rewarded 
for not trading Johnson when he surpassed most of his numbers from 1987. 
Johnson had a torrid June when he hit eleven home runs, 24 RBIs and logged 
a slugging percentage of .770 earning him his first National League Player 
of the Month award. In the All-Star voting, third baseman Mike Schmidt 
was elected to start for the N.L. but that posed a problem: Schmidt had 
already retired six weeks before the game. As a result, Johnson was chosen 
to start for his first All-Star Game. In his first All-Star at bat, he 
drove in the second run of the game in which the N.L. lost 5–3. Johnson 
played well in the second half but an overall team slowdown knocked the 
Mets out of the playoffs. With his 30th home run on August 20, 1989, Johnson 
joined Bobby Bonds and Willie Mays as the only multi-year members of the 
30–30 club. The only other infielders in major league history who had had 
multiple 30–30 seasons as of 2011 were Ian Kinsler, Alfonso Soriano, and 
Jeff Bagwell.[8] He ended 1989 with 36 home runs, tying his career-high 
and his own N.L. record for switch hitters. He also broke the 100-RBI mark 
for the first time, finishing with 101. Only Kevin Mitchell's career year 
stopped Johnson from winning both the home run and slugging titles in the 
N.L. like his teammate, Strawberry, had done in 1987. Johnson also stole 
41 bases which were the most for his career and scored 104 runs which tied 
for first in the N.L. He received 153 points in voting for N.L. MVP, finishing 
fifth. Both his on-base percentage and slugging from 1989 were career highs. 
After his stellar 1989, Howard Johnson's salary doubled from less than 
$800,000 to over $1.6 million but, similar to 1988, Johnson followed a 
great year with a decent one in 1990. Johnson put up consistently average 
numbers for the entire season. He stole 34 bases and, for the third time, 
he played in over 150 games. Despite finishing with only a .244 average 
and .434 slugging percentage, Johnson still racked up 90 RBIs and 37 doubles. 
He spent the last two months of the season as Kevin Elster's replacement 
at shortstop. The Mets started the season so poorly that manager Davey 
Johnson was fired in May but, under new manager Bud Harrelson, they recovered 
to win 91 games. They even took over first place in early September but 
missed the playoffs in the end. Johnson's best game was his first ever 
five-RBIs game, including a grand slam, at Wrigley Field on June 13, 1990. 
The quality of his season again mirrored the quality of his right-handed 
hitting as he batted only .208 from his weaker side. Johnson's fall-off 
in 1990 led to more trade rumors. Instead, the Mets' troubled all-time 
home run and RBIs leader, Darryl Strawberry, left New York when he was 
signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in December 1990. Johnson became the 
leader of the offense for the Mets and, in response, became arguably the 
best offensive player in the National League in 1991, winning two-thirds 
of the coveted Triple Crown. Johnson started slowly in April and caught 
fire in early May. The RBIs came in waves all season as he hit a right-handed 
grand slam on June 18, 1991 and had 26 RBIs in 22 games before the All-Star 
break. With 63 RBI, Johnson was selected as a reserve to his second and 
last All-Star Game. He finished out July well and had a slow August before 
a fantastic September in which he hit ten home runs with 28 RBIs while 
slugging nearly .700 earning him his second National League Player of the 
Month award. Johnson was the last Met to win the award until David Wright 
in June 2006. At season's end, Johnson had won both the National League 
home run title and RBI title. The 38 home runs broke his own record for 
N.L. switch hitters and 117 RBIs set the Met record for most runs batted 
in in a season until 1999. Both were also career bests for Johnson. On 
October 1, 1991, he stole his 30th base becoming only the second player, 
after Bobby Bonds, to join the 30–30 club in three different seasons. In 
June 1991, he passed Dave Kingman into second place on the Mets' all-time 
home run list. Johnson received 112 votes for National League MVP, finishing 
fifth. He likely would have received more MVP consideration except that 
the Mets had fallen all the way to a 77–84 record, second-to-last in the 
division. Despite his heroics, the Mets scored the fifth fewest runs per 
game in the majors. Johnson's had become a one-man show — his 38 home runs 
were more than the next two highest totals on the team combined and his 
RBI total was tops on the team by more than 40. His biggest liability was 
defense as he accumulated a career-worst 31 errors. In September, with 
Hubie Brooks out of the lineup and Johnson struggling defensively, the 
Mets moved him into the outfield where he played for most of the rest of 
the year. Going into the 1992 season, Johnson was surrounded by high-priced 
veterans like Eddie Murray, Bobby Bonilla, Vince Coleman and Bret Saberhagen 
but he responded by virtually disappearing. While he was a spotty right-handed 
hitter his whole career, in 1992, he stopped hitting from either side of 
the plate. He hit three home runs in April and followed up with an even 
worse May. After three months, he had only seven home runs and was batting 
.223 with a slugging percentage well under .400. A home run in late June 
turned out to be his last of the season. He went homerless for another 
month before fracturing his wrist in late July. He played a few more games 
in agony before the fracture was diagnosed and his season ended in early 
August. Johnson made over $2 million while his slugging percentage dropped 
nearly 200 points from 1991. The Mets had the third-highest payroll in 
the majors and finished 72–90, two games out of last place in the division. 
He did hit his 183rd National League home run that year, breaking Ted Simmons' 
league career record for home runs by a switch hitter. The 1993 Mets made 
their fans forget 1992 as the team went from bad to the worst team in the 
majors. His batting average did not reach .200 until almost May and his 
slugging only raised above .400 for barely a week before diving back down. 
He missed three weeks in June and his season again ended prematurely in 
late July. After the end of the 103-loss campaign, Johnson's time with 
the Mets came to an end as he was granted free agency. In 1994, Johnson 
signed with the Colorado Rockies. Despite the hitter-friendly atmosphere 
of Mile High Stadium, he wound up hitting more home runs on the road finishing 
with only ten overall. In the crowded left field position, he split time 
with Mike Kingery and Eric Young but was mostly pinch hitting by August 
when the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season. His .211 
average was the worst of his career to that point and he was not re-signed. 
Johnson signed on with the Chicago Cubs, shortly after the strike ended 
in April 1995. He saw limited playing time and his average was at .115 
in mid-August, lower than many of the team's pitchers. All of his production 
was at Wrigley Field as his average on the road was under .100 with only 
two extra base hits. A spurt in September raised his overall average to 
.195 but was not enough to garner a new contract from the Cubs. When he 
found no team interested,[citation needed] Johnson retired at age 35. After 
retiring, Johnson expressed an interest in coaching. In mid-1996, the Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays named Johnson to the coaching staff of their rookie-level 
minor league team, the Butte Copper Kings.[9] In February 1997, Johnson 
attempted a comeback with the Mets but abandoned the attempt after a month 
when his batting average was .129.[citation needed] Later in the year, 
he signed on as a scout with the Mets. Johnson was named the batting coach 
of the Mets' Brooklyn Cyclones minor league team for 2001. He was made 
the manager for 2002 after Brooklyn was named co-champion of the New York–Penn 
League (the championship was cancelled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks). 
In 2003, Johnson was the hitting coach under manager, Ken Oberkfell, when 
the St. Lucie Mets won the Florida State League championship. Johnson and 
Oberkfell were promoted to the AA Binghamton Mets for 2004 and guided them 
into the Eastern League playoffs. Both were promoted again to the AAA Norfolk 
Tides for 2005 and the Tides posted their highest batting average in six 
seasons.[10] He served as the Tides' hitting coach again in 2006 under 
Oberkfell. In 2007, he took over first base coaching duties for the Mets,[11] 
and later that year was named hitting coach.[12] In 2011, He was replaced 
by Dave Hudgens.[13] In 2011, at age 50, Howard Johnson returned to professional 
baseball for a brief comeback to play two minor league games with his son 
Glen Johnson for the Rockland Boulders.[14] In the first game, Howard went 
hitless in four at-bats, but made contact in each plate appearance. In 
the second game, he walked in his first at-bat but then left the game to 
be the team's first base coach. Johnson was named hitting coach for AAA 
Tacoma Rainiers of the Seattle Mariners organization for the 2013 baseball 
season.[15] Johnson joined the Mariners as a Hitting Coach for the 2014 
Season part of the new coaching staff. He was replaced by Edgar Martínez 
on June 20, 2015. 1985 co-winner of the pro athlete rib eating contest. 
Sharing honor with Dickie Thon. Elected to not defend in 1986 Within two 
years of his retirement, Johnson's two major National League switch-hitting 
home run records were broken. In 1996, his single-season record was broken 
by former teammate, Todd Hundley, who finished with 41. In 1997, his career 
record was broken by another former teammate, Bobby Bonilla, who hit his 
210th National League home run in the midst of a championship season with 
the Florida Marlins. Bonilla finished his career in 2001 with 249 NL home 
runs, but Chipper Jones of the Braves currently holds the NL single-season 
switch hit HR record (45), achieved in 1999, and the career mark as well 
(452). Mike Piazza passed Johnson into second-place on both the all-time 
Mets home run list in 2004 and the all-time Mets RBI list in 2005. In 2001, 
Johnson was on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot but received no votes. 
Howard is married to his wife, Kim. Together they have three children (daughters: 
Shannon and Kayla; and son, Glen). Shannon is a figure skating coach in 
Florida. Glen started his amateur baseball career as a switch-hitting shortstop 
when he attended Jacksonville University on a baseball scholarship. In 
the 2007 draft, Johnson's son Glen was selected by the Mets in the 36th 
round but did not sign with the team.[16] Glen continued to play professional 
baseball and most recently has been an infielder for the Newark Bears.
