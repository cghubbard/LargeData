Ernest Thorwald Johnson (June 16, 1924 – August 12, 2011) was a Major League 
Baseball pitcher and longtime play-by-play and color commentator on Atlanta 
Braves games on WTBS. The 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m), 195 lb (88 kg) right-hander 
was signed by the Boston Braves as an amateur free agent before the 1942 
season. He played for the Boston Braves (1950, 1952), Milwaukee Braves 
(1953–1958), and Baltimore Orioles (1959). After serving three years in 
the U.S. Marine Corps, Johnson made his major league debut in relief on 
April 28, 1950, against the Philadelphia Phillies at Shibe Park. His first 
big league win was also in relief, coming against the New York Giants on 
June 30, 1950, at the Polo Grounds. Johnson led Western League pitchers 
with a .750 winning percentage while playing for the Denver Bears in 1949. 
He spent part of 1950 in the Eastern League and all of 1951 in the American 
Association before returning to the major leagues for good in 1952. He 
started 10 games for Boston in 1952 and then appeared almost exclusively 
in relief thereafter. He led American Association pitchers with a .789 
winning percentage and an ERA of 2.62 while playing for the Milwaukee Brewers 
in 1951. From 1953 to 1957, the first five years that the Braves were in 
Milwaukee, Johnson led the pitching staff with 175 relief appearances, 
an average of 35 per season. He was followed closely behind by Dave Jolly, 
who relieved in 158 games during that five-year span. During those seasons 
the closer's job was held at different times by Lew Burdette, Johnson, 
Jolly, and Don McMahon. Johnson had an important role on the 1957 World 
Series Champion Braves with a 7–3 record and four saves in 30 games. In 
three World Series appearances against the New York Yankees that October 
he gave up only one run in seven innings, but it happened to be a game-winning 
home run by Hank Bauer in the seventh inning of Game 6. In nine seasons, 
Johnson had a losing record only once (1955) and had an overall winning 
percentage of .635. Career totals include a record of 40–23 in 273 games, 
19 games started, three complete games, one shutout, 119 games finished, 
19 saves, and an ERA of 3.77. Following his playing days Johnson was a 
longtime color commentator and play-by-play broadcaster on Braves radio 
and television, working from 1962 to 1999. He became an icon in Atlanta 
after the team moved there in 1966, and in the 1980s gained national exposure 
through his work with Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren on "Superstation" 
TBS. He was elected to the Braves' Hall of Fame on August 24, 2001. His 
son, Ernie Johnson, Jr., worked with him on SportSouth telecasts from 1993 
to 1996. The broadcast booth at Atlanta's Turner Field bears his name. 
In 2014, Johnson was inducted into the Vermont Sports Hall of Fame. Johnson
