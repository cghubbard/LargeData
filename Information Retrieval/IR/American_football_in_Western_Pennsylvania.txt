American football in Western Pennsylvania, featuring the city of Pittsburgh 
and surrounding areas, has had a long and storied history, dating back 
to the early days of the sport. All levels of football, including high 
school football and college football, are followed passionately, and the 
area's National Football League (NFL) team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, is 
consistently one of the sport's most popular teams.[1][2][3][4] Many of 
the NFL's top stars have come from the region as well, especially those 
that play quarterback, earning Western Pennsylvania the nickname "Cradle 
of Quarterbacks".[5][6] In the early 20th century, football began to catch 
on in the general population of the United States and was the subject of 
intense competition and rivalry, albeit of a localized nature. Although 
payments to players were considered unsporting and dishonorable at the 
time, a Pittsburgh area club, the Allegheny Athletic Association, of the 
unofficial western Pennsylvania football circuit, surreptitiously hired 
former Yale All-American guard William "Pudge" Heffelfinger. On November 
12, 1892, Heffelfinger became the first known professional football player. 
He was paid $500 to play in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club. 
Heffelfinger picked up a Pittsburgh fumble and ran 35 yards for a touchdown, 
winning the game 4–0 for Allegheny. Although observers held suspicions, 
the payment remained a secret for years.[7][8][9][10] A year later, Ben 
"Sport" Donnelly became the first professional football coach, when he 
headed up the Allegheny Athletic Association team.[11] Meanwhile, a player 
assumed to be Grant Dibert of the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, signed the 
first known pro football contract, which covered all of the clubs games 
for the 1893 season.[12] On September 3, 1895 the first wholly professional 
game was played, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, between the Latrobe Athletic 
Association and the Jeannette Athletic Club. Latrobe won the contest 12–0.[7][8] 
During this game, Latrobe's quarterback, John Brallier became the first 
player to openly admit to being paid to play football. He was paid $10 
plus expenses to play.[13] In 1897, the Latrobe Athletic Association paid 
all of its players for the whole season, becoming the first fully professional 
football team. From 1890 until 1900, nearby Greensburg, Pennsylvania was 
the home of the Greensburg Athletic Association. The team began as an amateur 
football club in 1890 and was composed primarily of locals before several 
paid players were added for 1895. In 1894 it was discovered that the team 
had secretly paid formerly Indiana Normal (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) 
player, Lawson Fiscus, to play football and retained his services on salary. 
The team was the chief rival of another early professional football team, 
the Latrobe Athletic Association. Aside from Fiscus, the Greensburg Athletic 
Association included several of the era's top players, such as: Charlie 
Atherton, George Barclay, Ross Fiscus, Jack Gass, Arthur McFarland, Charles 
Rinehart, Isaac Seneca and Adam Martin Wyant. Several of these players 
revolutionized the game during their playing careers. Charlie Atherton 
is credited with inventing the place kick, and George Barclay invented 
the first-ever football helmet. Meanwhile, Isaac Seneca became the first 
Native-American to earn All-American honors and Adam Wyant was the first 
professional football player to become a United States Congressman.[14] 
In 1898, William Chase Temple took over the team payments for the Duquesne 
Country and Athletic Club, a professional football team based in Pittsburgh 
from 1895 until 1900, becoming the first known individual football club 
owner.[15] A year later in 1899, the Morgan Athletic Club, on the South 
Side of Chicago, was founded. This team later became the Chicago Cardinals, 
and now is known as the Arizona Cardinals, making them the oldest continuously 
operating professional football team.[8] The Cardinals would later merge 
with the Steelers for one season in 1944 due to player shortages as a result 
of World War II, with the two teams meeting in Super Bowl XLIII over six 
decades later. The Duquesne Country and Athletic Club would become the 
top pro team in the state in 1898 and 1899. In 1898 Latrobe and two players 
from the Greensburg Athletic Association, formed the very first professional 
football all-star team for a game against the Duquesne Country and Athletic 
Club, to be played at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park. Duquesne went on to 
win the game 16-0.[16] On November 18, 1905, Latrobe defeated the Canton 
Bulldogs, which later became a founding member, and two-time champion, 
of the National Football League, 6-0.[17] Later the Homestead Library & 
Athletic Club, fielded the top pro team in the state in 1900–1901. In 1902 
the top players in the area, mainly from the Duquesne Country and Athletic 
Club line-up, formed the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football 
League. The Stars were suspected of being financed by Barney Dreyfuss and 
William Chase Temple, the owners of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates, who 
were at the time the dominant team in the National League. The Stars featured 
baseball players in the line-up including Christy Mathewson, a future Hall 
of Fame pitcher with the New York Giants and Fred Crolius, and outfielder 
with Pirates. The team won the league's only championship in 1902. In 1903, 
Franklin, Pennsylvania was the home of the Franklin Athletic Club. That 
season, the team was unofficially recognized as the "US Football Champions"[18] 
and later won the 1903 World Series of Football, held that December at 
Madison Square Garden.[19] The team included several of the era's top players, 
such as: Herman Kerchoff, Arthur McFarland, Clark Schrontz, Paul Steinberg, 
Pop Sweet, Eddie Wood, and coach Blondy Wallace.[20] Other early professional 
football teams from western Pennsylvania include; the McKeesport Olympics, 
Oil City Athletic Club, Pitcairn Quakers and Glassport Odds. In 1933, as 
the oldest of nine children Art Rooney, who had been raised on the North 
Side of Pittsburgh, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers.[21] Originally nicknamed 
the Pirates,[22] the team later changed their name to the Steelers, to 
represent the city's heritage of producing steel. The Steelers' first season 
with a winning record came in 1942. However, they lost their first playoff 
game in 1947.[23] Western Pennsylvania football at the collegiate level 
began in the fall of 1889 at the University of Pittsburgh, then known as 
the Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP). The first official collegiate 
game in Western Pennsylvania was played on October 11, 1890, when the Allegheny 
Athletic Association's defeated WUP 38-0.[24] WUP's second game was also 
the first game for Washington & Jefferson, a rivalry that would dominate 
the area through the early 20th century.[25] The region's early thirst 
for football was made evident when a 12,000 strong overflow crowd packed 
Exposition Park to watch W&J defeat Duquesne Country and Athletic Club 
4-0 in one of the largest crowds in Western Pennsylvania history to that 
point.[26] By 1904, the region had its first undefeated football team when 
WUP went 10-0 while surrendering only one touchdown on the way to collectively 
outscoring opponents 406-5,[27] and by 1908, WUP had adopted its present 
name, the University of Pittsburgh, and quickly came to be commonly referred 
to as Pitt. In 1910, led by coach Joseph H. Thompson and star fullback 
Tex Richards, Pitt went undefeated for the second time in school history, 
outscoring its nine opponents 282-0, causing some to proclaim it as that 
season's national champion.[28][29] This success paved the way for Pitt 
rise to national prominence under legendary coach Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner 
who would lead Pitt to national championships in 1915, 1916, and 1918;[28][29] 
along with an additional undefeated season in 1917, while its players garnered 
16 first-team All-American selections.[30] During this era, Washington 
& Jefferson was also competitive with some of the top teams in the nation. 
In 1913, the Presidents, led by Bob Folwell, team posted a 10–0–1 record 
and were the highest scoring team in the nation.[31] That season featured 
a scoreless tie of Yale, a 100–0 defeat of Grove City College, and a 17–0 
victory over Penn State that broke the Nittany Lions' 19-game winning streak, 
earning the entire school a day off to celebrate.[31] Sportswriter Walter 
S. Trumbull of the The New York Sun suggested that the Michigan Aggies, 
Washington & Jefferson, Chicago University, and Notre Dame were the new 
"Big 4 of College Football" instead of the traditional grouping of Princeton, 
Yale, Harvard, and Penn.[31] The next year, Folwell's team lost at Harvard 
University in front of 15,000 fans by a score of 10-9.[31] If not for an 
errant kick that hit the crossbar, W&J would have won the game and at least 
a share of the mythical national championship.[31] That squad saved face 
by becoming only the seventh team to ever defeat Yale University, with 
a decisive 13-7 victory.[31] The game received national press coverage, 
and the team received a personal note of congratulations by Theodore Roosevelt.[31] 
In 1918, perhaps the biggest football game yet played in the region occurred 
at Forbes Field when undefeated Pitt hosted unscored upon and defending 
national champion Georgia Tech which was then coached by the legendary 
John Heisman,[32] who had previously coach for one season at W&J.[33] The 
game, which served as a War Charities fundraising event, was highly publicized 
and was played in front of many of the nation's top sports writers, including 
Walter Camp.[34] Pitt dismantled Georgia Tech 32-0 and would go on to be 
championed as that season's best team.[28][29] Another game of import occurred 
in 1926 when a 6–2 Carnegie Tech football team shutout Knute Rockne's undefeated 
Notre Dame Fighting Irish 19–0 at Forbes Field. It would be the only loss 
for the Irish all season[35] and would come to be ranked as the fourth-greatest 
upset in college football history by ESPN.[36] Washington & Jefferson's 
1921 team went 10-0 under coach Greasy Neale, earning them an invitation 
to the 1922 Rose Bowl to play the heavily favored California Golden Bears. 
Cal had won their season 312-33, but the W&J defense held the Golden Bears' 
potent offense, led by Brick Muller, to no points and 2 first downs, no 
completed passes, and only 49 yards rushing.[37] The game, which would 
be the last time a "small school" would play in the Rose Bowl, featured 
the first African-American quarterback to play in the Rose Bowl (W&J's 
Charlie West) and the first freshman to play in a Rose Bowl (W&J's Herb 
Kopf).[38] In 1924, former Pitt All-American Dr. John Bain "Jock" Sutherland 
took over for Warner as coach of the Pitt Panthers, an event that was soon 
followed by the opening of university's Pitt Stadium. Sutherland was described 
as "a national hero" in a Saturday Evening Post article,[39] and was perhaps 
the most highly admired and influential coach in the history of the university. 
During his 15-year tenure at the university, the longest of any football 
coach at Pitt, he compiled a record of 111-20-12 which included 79 shutouts. 
Sutherland players received 24 first-team All-American selections and his 
teams were named Eastern football champions seven times: 1925, 1927, 1929, 
1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937.[40] During this time, Pitt appeared in four 
Rose Bowl games (1928, 1930, 1933, and 1937) and turned down a bid for 
the 1938 Rose Bowl.[41] Sutherland's teams were named "National Champions" 
by various selectors for nine different seasons including 1925, 1927, 1929, 
1931, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, and 1938.[42][43] Of these, the University 
of Pittsburgh officially recognizes five of those years as national championship 
seasons: 1929, 1931, 1934, 1936, and 1937.[44] However, Pitt and Washington 
& Jefferson weren't the only teams finding their way to major bowls. The 
Duquesne Dukes would win the 1937 Orange Bowl 13-12 over Mississippi State 
and Carnegie Tech would finish sixth in the final Associated Press Poll 
and go to the 1939 Sugar Bowl. Area colleges were responsible for many 
innovations in the game. In 1908, Washington & Jefferson became the first 
team in college history to be documented with uniform numbers.[45] Other 
sources give that distinction to University of Pittsburgh.[46][47][48] 
The first live radio broadcast of a college football game in the United 
States when Harold W. Arlin announced the 21-13 Pitt victory in the Backyard 
Brawl over West Virginia at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh on KDKA on October 
8, 1921.[49] Duquesne head coach Elmer Layden is credited with devising 
the system of hand signals that officials use today. The signal system 
was put to use for the first time on November 11, 1928, when Duquesne hosted 
Thiel College at Pitt Stadium. Layden was also the first coach to use two 
sets of uniform jerseys for home and away contests. In addition, the first 
nationwide television broadcast of a live sporting event, a Pitt football 
game against Duke at Pitt Stadium, was televised coast-to-coast by NBC 
on September 29, 1951.[50] Despite all their success, area institutions 
followed the trend of many colleges across the nation and deemphasized 
football in the wake of World War II. Carnegie Tech and W&J both deemphasized 
football in various sequences following the war which has resulted in both 
of their programs today playing in Division III. Also following the war, 
Duquesne dropped football as a varsity sport until it was resurrected in 
1979 before moving to the Division I Football Championship Subdivision 
in 1993. Although Pitt also instituted policies in the late 1930s designed 
to de-emphasize its athletic programs,[51] they were subsequently repealed 
by the mid-1940s. Therefore, Pitt is the only Western Pennsylvania collegiate 
program that continues to play college football at the highest level, today 
known as the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Following World War 
II, the Steelers struggled through to the late 1960s. Pitt had a resurgence 
in the 1950s with stars like Mike Ditka that helped it to attain off-and-on 
national rankings and make appearances in the Sugar (which Pitt's Bobby 
Grier desegregated[52]) and Gator bowls. Pitt peaked with a number three 
national ranking in the final poll of 1963, but then stagnated in the later 
1960s. However, both the Panthers and the Steelers—as well as baseball's 
Pirates—started having successful years in the 1970s as the rest of the 
city fell into a deep recession as a result of deindustrialization. In 
1969, the Steelers hired head coach Chuck Noll who strategically drafted 
players in order to improve the team.[53] Three years later, in the first 
playoff game at Three Rivers Stadium Pittsburgh's rookie running back Franco 
Harris returned an errant pass that bounced off an opposing player for 
a game winning touchdown in a play that later became labeled the Immaculate 
Reception. In 1974, the Steelers won their first Super Bowl in franchise 
history—a feat which they would repeat in 1975, 1978, and 1979 to become 
the first NFL franchise to win four Super Bowls. In 1992, Noll was succeeded 
by Bill Cowher, who led the franchise to its fifth Super Bowl victory in 
2005. Mike Tomlin succeeded Cower and led the Steelers to an NFL record 
sixth Super Bowl victory in 2008.[23] As of 2009, the Steelers have 18 members 
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[54] In October 1964, Ernie Stautner, 
who played on the Steelers from 1950 to 1963, became the only Steelers' 
player to have his number—70—retired.[55] At Pitt, University Chancellor 
Wesley Posvar took action to revive the football program and hired Johnny 
Majors from Iowa State to resurrect the program in 1973. Majors immediately 
upgraded the recruiting, most notably bringing in future Heisman Trophy 
winner Tony Dorsett. Majors' impact was immediate: in Pitt's first game 
with Majors as coach, the Panthers travelled to the University of Georgia 
where they tied Vince Dooley's Bulldogs 7-7. The excitement in the city 
was palpable as the Panthers improved from one win in 1972 to a 6-5-1 record 
in 1973. Their success earned the Panthers their first bowl bid since 1956 
when they were invited to play Arizona State in the 1973 Fiesta Bowl, where 
they lost 28-7. The next season saw further improvement with wins at Florida 
State and Georgia Tech to finish 7-4. In 1975, a Sun Bowl victory over 
Kansas capped an 8-4 record highlighted by wins at Georgia and Notre Dame. 
The stage was thus set for the 1976 edition of the Panthers to make a run 
for the National Championship. The 1976 season began with the Panthers 
ranked ninth in the AP preseason poll. The first game was at Notre Dame, 
where the Irish grew the grass long on the playing field in a failed attempt 
to slow down Dorsett, who had burned them for 303 rushing yards the year 
before.[56] Their efforts were in vain as Dorsett ran for a 61-yard touchdown 
on Pitt's first play from scrimmage on the way to a 31-10 win. The season 
continued with a 42-14 win at Georgia Tech and a 36-19 win over Miami. 
On October 23, the Panthers travelled to Annapolis to face Navy during 
which Dorsett broke the NCAA career rushing record on a 32-yard touchdown 
run in Pitt's 45-0 victory. Dorsett's achievement prompted a mid-game celebration 
in which even Navy saluted the feat with a cannon blast.[57] Pitt next 
defeated eastern rival Syracuse 23-13, and on November 6, number two ranked 
Pitt easily handled Army while number one ranked Michigan lost to Purdue. 
For the first time since 1939, the Pitt Panthers were the number one ranked 
team in the country. The following week, they successfully defended their 
top rating in a close Backyard Brawl against rival West Virginia. With 
a record of 10-0, the Panthers headed into their regular season finale 
with only heated instate rival Penn State standing in the way of Pitt's 
national title aspirations. At a packed Three Rivers Stadium on the day 
after Thanksgiving, the Nittany Lions held Dorsett to 51 yards in the first 
half and had the game tied 7-7. Majors adjusted for the second half by 
shifting Dorsett from tailback to fullback, enabling him to explode for 
an additional 173 yards as Pitt rolled to a 24-7 victory that capped an 
undefeated regular season.[58] In December, Dorsett became the first Pitt 
Panther to win the Heisman Trophy as the nation's best college football 
player. Dorsett also won the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Player of the 
Year Award, and was named UPI Player of the Year. The 11-0 Panthers accepted 
an invitation to the 1977 Sugar Bowl to face second ranked Georgia. Pitt 
defeated the Bulldogs 27-3 and was voted number one in both the final Associated 
Press and Coaches polls, claiming their ninth national championship.[59] 
This was Pitt's first undefeated national championship since 1937. The 
American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) named Majors the 1976 Coach 
of the Year. Following this historic season, Majors returned to his alma 
mater, the University of Tennessee, to take the head coaching job.[60] 
Jackie Sherrill, an assistant under Majors at Pitt and the head coach at 
Washington State, succeeded Majors as head coach at Pitt. Under Sherrill, 
the winning continued with a 9-2-1 record and Gator Bowl win in 1977. An 
8-4 record and Tangerine Bowl appearance followed in 1978. Sherrill stockpiled 
future NFL talent including Pittsburgh's own quarterback Dan Marino, Hall 
of Fame inductee Russ Grimm, and Outland Trophy winner Mark May. Sherrill 
also molded a devastating defense that was anchored at the defensive end 
position manned by Hall of Fame inductee Rickey Jackson and Heisman Trophy 
runner-up Hugh Green, who had the highest finish in the Heisman voting 
by a defensive player until 1997, when Michigan's cornerback Charles Woodson, 
who also played receiver, won the trophy. 1979 began a string of three 
straight seasons with 11-1 records. However, an early loss at North Carolina 
in 1979, a midseason loss during a driving rainstorm at Florida State in 
1980, and a devastating season-ending defeat at the hands of rival Penn 
State in 1981 prevented those teams from clinching an AP or Coaches poll 
national championship. The 1981 loss to Penn State at Pitt Stadium was 
especially devastating, as the number one ranked Panthers had opened up 
a 14-0 first-quarter lead only to see an apparent Dan Marino touchdown 
pass intercepted in the endzone and returned for a touchdown. The Nittany 
Lions scored 48 unanswered points to end the Panthers' dream of a second 
national championship in five years.[61] In each of these three seasons, 
Pitt rebounded to win a bowl game: the Fiesta, Gator, and Sugar Bowls respectively. 
The 1981 Sugar Bowl was highlighted by one of the most dramatic plays in 
Pitt history as Dan Marino hit a streaking John Brown on fourth down in 
the last seconds of the game for the go-ahead score against a Georgia team 
that featured Herschel Walker.[62] Sherrill's teams at Pitt are considered 
by some to be among the most talented in Pitt and college football history. 
The 1980 Pitt team alone featured seven first round draft picks, 23 players 
who went on to start in the NFL, seven others who played in the NFL, and 
one player each who played in the CFL and the USFL.[63] Bobby Bowden, legendary 
coach of Florida State, is quoted as saying, "I've said it many times, 
in all my years of coaching, that Pitt team was the best college football 
team I have ever seen."[64] Sherrill left Pitt in early 1982 for Texas 
A&M, signing a then record contract worth over $1.7 million.[65] In five 
seasons, Sherrill's Panthers won fifty games, lost nine, and tied one (50-9-1), 
which places his 0.842 winning percentage at the top of the list for all 
Pitt coaches, just ahead of Jock Sutherland. The Steelers are one of the 
NFL's most popular teams, with a fan base known as Steeler Nation. Despite 
the difference in high school and college football tastes, the team unites 
many, and is often one of the NFL's biggest ratings draws. Since the Dan 
Marino days at Pitt, the team hasn't competed for a national championship, 
but has appeared in major bowls and often appears in national polls. The 
Panthers maintain a rivalry with the West Virginia Mountaineers, and will 
soon resume a four-game series with another traditional regional rival, 
the Penn State Nittany Lions. Pitt, Penn State, Notre Dame, and West Virginia 
all maintain strong local followings within the Pittsburgh region. Outside 
of the NFL and college football, the city was represented by the Pittsburgh 
Americans of the second American Football League in 1936 and 1937. It was 
also be briefly represented by the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States 
Football League, in 1984, and the Pittsburgh Gladiators (now the Tampa 
Bay Storm), of the first Arena Football League from 1987 until 1990. A 
new Arena Football League team, the Pittsburgh Power, started play in the 
Consol Energy Center in April 2011.[66] In addition, Pittsburgh is home 
to three women's full-contact football teams: the Pittsburgh Passion, the 
Pittsburgh Force and the Steel City Renegades. Founded in 2002, as members 
of the National Women's Football Association and having played in the Independent 
Women's Football League, the Passion are currently members of the Women's 
Football Alliance.[67] The team went 12–0 and won a national title in 2007 
as members of the NWFA.[68] A newer team, the Pittsburgh Force, were founded 
in 2008 and are members of the WFA. The Renegades, founded in 2009, are 
members of the Women's Spring Football League. The "most established area 
minor-league football team" the Pittsburgh Colts are members of the North 
American Football League's Regional American Football League.[69][70] High 
school football remains popular in the area, with high school games routinely 
drawing over 10,000 fans per game and receiving regular press coverage 
in the area. Schools such as Aliquippa, Allderdice, Beaver Falls, Brashear, 
Central Catholic, Clairton, Hopewell, Perry, Pine-Richland, North Allegheny, 
and Woodland Hills have all been consistent contenders for WPIAL and City 
League championships and even PIAA championships. Many have sent former 
star players onto the NFL. Aliquippa alone has sent Mike Ditka, Sean Gilbert, 
Ty Law, and Darrelle Revis onto successful NFL careers, with Ditka now 
being a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The PIAA's Western Pennsylvania 
region, officially known as District 7 but more commonly known by its older 
name as the WPIAL, has its annual high school football championships at 
Heinz Field. The Pittsburgh region also has developed many notable athletes 
that have gone on to outstanding careers in professional sports. The region 
has produced a multitude of NFL quarterbacks, giving Western Pennsylvania 
the nickname "Cradle of Quarterbacks."[5][6] Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Joe
