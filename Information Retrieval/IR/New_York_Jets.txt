The New York Jets are a professional American football team located in 
the New York metropolitan area. The Jets compete in the National Football 
League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference 
(AFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey. 
In a unique arrangement for the league, the Jets share MetLife Stadium 
in East Rutherford, New Jersey with the New York Giants. The franchise 
is legally and corporately registered as New York Jets, LLC.[3] The team 
was founded in 1959 as the Titans of New York, an original member of the 
American Football League (AFL); later, the franchise joined the NFL in 
the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. The team began to play in 1960 at the Polo 
Grounds. Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and 
the franchise moved to Shea Stadium in 1964 and then to the Meadowlands 
Sports Complex in 1984. The Jets advanced to the playoffs for the first 
time in 1968 and went on to compete in Super Bowl III where they defeated 
the Baltimore Colts, becoming the first AFL team to defeat an NFL club 
in an AFL-NFL World Championship Game.[4] Since 1968, the Jets have appeared 
in the playoffs 13 times, and in the AFC Championship Game four times, 
most recently losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010.[5] However, the 
Jets have never returned to the Super Bowl, making them one of three NFL 
teams to win their lone Super Bowl appearance, along with the New Orleans 
Saints and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The team's training facility, Atlantic 
Health Jets Training Center,[6] which opened in 2008, is located in Florham 
Park.[7] The team currently holds their annual training camp sessions on 
the campus of the State University of New York at Cortland in Cortland, 
New York while holding occasional sessions at the Florham Park complex.[8] 
The first organizational meeting of the American Football League took place 
on August 14, 1959.[9] Harry Wismer, representing the city of New York 
at the meeting, proclaimed the state was ready for another professional 
football team and that he was more than capable of running the daily operations.[9] 
Wismer was granted the charter franchise later dubbed the Titans of New 
York as Wismer explained, "Titans are bigger and stronger than Giants."[10] 
He secured the Titans' home field at the decrepit Polo Grounds, where the 
team struggled financially and on the field during its first three years.[11] 
By 1962, the debt continued to mount for Wismer, forcing the AFL to assume 
the costs of the team until season's end.[12] A five-man syndicate, headed 
by Sonny Werblin, saved the team from certain bankruptcy, purchasing the 
lowly Titans for $1 million.[13] Werblin renamed the team the New York 
Jets since the team would play in Shea Stadium near LaGuardia Airport.[14] 
The new name was intended to reflect the modern approach of his team. The 
Jets' owners hired Weeb Ewbank as the general manager and head coach.[13] 
Ewbank and quarterback Joe Namath led the Jets to prominence in 1969, when 
New York defeated the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III[4] 
and solidified the AFL's position in the world of professional football.[15] 
When the AFL and NFL merged, the team fell into a state of mediocrity along 
with their star quarterback, Namath, who only had three successful post-merger 
seasons after injuries hampered much of his career. The Jets continued 
to spiral downward before enjoying a string of successes in the 1980s, 
which included an appearance in the 1982 AFC Championship Game, and the 
emergence of the popular New York Sack Exchange. The early 1990s saw New 
York struggling.[16] After firing coach Bruce Coslet, owner Leon Hess hired 
Pete Carroll who struggled to a 6–10 record and was promptly fired at the 
end of the season.[16] Thereafter, Rich Kotite was selected to lead the 
team to victory; instead he led the Jets to a 4–28 record over the next 
two years.[16] Kotite stepped down at the end of his second season forcing 
the Jets to search for a new head coach.[16] Hess lured then-disgruntled 
New England Patriots head coach Bill Parcells to New York in 1997.[17] 
Parcells led the team back to relevance and coached them to the AFC Championship 
Game in 1998.[18][19] Hess died in 1999 while the team, plagued by injuries, 
produced an eight win record, falling short of a playoff berth.[19] At 
the end of the season, Parcells stepped down as head coach deferring control 
to his assistant, Bill Belichick; Belichick resigned the very next day 
(leaving a napkin at the stage for his introduction, on which he had written 
"I resign as HC of the NYJ") and went on to accept the head coaching position 
with the Patriots.[20] The franchise obtained a new owner in Woody Johnson 
in 2000.[21] Additionally, through the 2000s the Jets visited the playoffs 
five times, a franchise record, under the direction of three different 
coaches.[22] Rex Ryan was hired in January 2009.[23] Ryan led the team 
to back-to-back AFC Championship appearances during his first two years[24] 
but the team never made the playoffs again during his tenure. Harry Wismer, 
a businessman, had been interested in sports for much of his life when 
he was granted a charter franchise in the American Football League.[25] 
A three-sport letterman, football, particularly, stuck with Wismer who 
went on to play for the University of Florida and Michigan State before 
a knee injury ended his playing career.[25] Undeterred, Wismer began his 
career as a broadcaster originally with Michigan State and became a pioneer 
of the industry. Later, as the Titans owner, Wismer formulated a league-wide 
policy which allowed broadcasting rights to be shared equally among the 
teams.[25] Wismer, who had previously had a 25% stake in the Washington 
Redskins, was interested in the American Football League and was given 
a franchise to develop in New York. Wismer, whose philosophy was who you 
knew mattered most, tried to make the team and the league a success.[25] 
His efforts began to accrue debt as the Titans' first two seasons were 
mediocre with attendance dropping in the team's second year.[25] The franchise 
was sold for $1 million to a five-man syndicate headed by Sonny Werblin 
of the Gotham Football Club, Inc. in February 1963.[25] Sonny Werblin graduated 
from Rutgers University and was employed by the Music Corporation of America, 
eventually becoming president of the company's television division.[26] 
With a vast knowledge of media, Werblin was determined to put the spotlight 
on the team.[26] His first order of business, after changing the team's 
name and jerseys, was to sign Joe Namath to an unprecedented contract.[26] 
Werblin's gamble would later pay off as Namath, who became a public star, 
led the Jets on to victory in Super Bowl III, though by then Werblin had 
sold his stake in the team.[26] Werblin's partners, Townsend B. Martin, 
Leon Hess, Donald C. Lillis, and Philip H. Iselin, had a falling out with 
Werblin over the way the team was run—though the franchise had begun to 
make a profit, Werblin was making all the policies and decisions himself 
with little or no input from his partners, much to their dismay.[27] Though 
Werblin initially resisted their ultimatum to dissolve the partnership,[27] 
Werblin agreed to be bought out in 1968.[26] Werblin remained involved 
in the sports community and became the first chairman and CEO of the New 
Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority where he helped to create the Meadowlands 
Sports Complex, including Giants Stadium.[26] Leon Hess became well known 
for his Hess Corporation gas stations; however, he also played an instrumental 
part in the development of the Jets during his tenure as co-owner and eventual 
sole owner. Hess had often fought for improvements while the team was a 
tenant at Shea Stadium but generally stayed away from football operations, 
allowing his coaches and general manager to make football-related decisions.[28] 
Becoming the team's majority stockholder in 1973, Hess bought Philip H. 
Iselin's share upon his death in 1976 after which only two of Hess' partners 
remained, Townsend Martin and Helen Dillon, who had inherited the stake 
from her father Donald Lillis, upon his death.[29] Hess began to buy out 
the remaining partners in 1981 when he bought Martin's 25% stake for $5 
million.[30] Hess bought Dillon's stake three years later for another $5 
million, acquiring sole control of the team.[30] Hess had a passion for 
his team and took losses hard.[28] In 1995, following a mediocre 6–10 season 
under Pete Carroll, despite generally shying away from football operations, 
Hess announced "I'm 80 years old, I want results now" during a conference 
in which Rich Kotite was introduced as the team's new coach.[28] After 
two unsuccessful years with Kotite, Hess heavily involved himself in hiring 
Bill Parcells in hopes to see his team again reach the Super Bowl.[28] 
He did not live to see his dream realized as he died on May 7, 1999.[28] 
With the team for sale, two potential buyers were found in Cablevision 
and philanthropist Woody Johnson whose grandfather, Robert Wood Johnson 
II, expanded Johnson & Johnson.[31] Johnson was unknown among the other 
NFL owners at the time of his $635 million purchase of the franchise.[31] 
However, Johnson had a passion for sports according to former Knicks general 
manager Ernie Grunfeld and desired to own his own team.[31] Johnson has 
been considered to be an enabler who wants the best from his employees.[31] 
Much like Hess, Johnson left many of the football related decisions up 
to his management team and tended to avoid the spotlight. However, upon 
hiring head coach Rex Ryan, Johnson had an increased presence as he molded 
the Jets into his team.[31][32][33] Owner Harry Wismer sought out a place 
for the team to play their home games but was only able to secure the dilapidated 
Polo Grounds, which had not had a major tenant since the baseball New York 
Giants vacated the stadium in 1957. The Titans played their first four 
seasons at the stadium—in the final season they were renamed the Jets. 
The Titans shared the stadium with baseball's new expansion team, the New 
York Mets, for two years before both teams moved to the Shea Stadium in 
Queens in 1964. The Jets hold the distinction of being the final team to 
host a game at the Polo Grounds, a 19–10 loss to the Buffalo Bills on December 
14, 1963.[34] Wismer hoped the Titans could play in what would become known 
as Shea Stadium beginning in 1961.[35] However, funding difficulties and 
legal problems delayed construction of the stadium.[35] Wismer signed a 
memorandum of understanding in late 1961 to secure the Titans' new home.[35] 
That memorandum recognized that the Mets would have exclusive use of the 
stadium until they had completed their season. As the team moved to Shea 
under new ownership, they were, in most years, required to open the season 
with several road games, a problem made worse in 1969 and 1973 when the 
Mets had long playoff runs.[35][36] Feeling that this arrangement put the 
Jets at a disadvantage, the team announced in 1977 that they would play 
two home games a year during the month of September at the Giants' new 
home in New Jersey, Giants Stadium. Litigation began between New York City 
and the Jets over the issue, and in the lawsuit's settlement, the city 
agreed to allow the Jets to play two September home games a season at Shea 
beginning in 1978 for the remaining six years in the Jets' lease. In 1977, 
the Jets were to play one September game at Giants Stadium and an October 
2 game at Shea.[37] In spite of these issues, majority owner Leon Hess 
was interested in renewing the team's lease at Shea, which was due to expire 
in 1983. Hess negotiated with New York mayor Ed Koch.[38] Hess wanted the 
city to redevelop the stadium to expand its capacity. He also hoped to 
renegotiate other aspects of the lease—the Jets received no money from 
ticketholders parking at Shea. Hess's proposals met resistance from Koch.[38] 
When negotiations reached an impasse, the Jets announced their intention 
to depart for New Jersey.[38] On December 10, 1983 the Jets played their 
final game at Shea and lost to the Steelers 34–7.[36] As fans pillaged 
the stadium for mementos, the scoreboard read "N.J. Jets" in reference 
to the Jets' departure to the Meadowlands.[36] When the Jets joined the 
Giants at the stadium, many Jets fans hoped the name, Giants Stadium, would 
be changed. However, the Giants, who had the authority to approve the change, 
refused.[39] In an effort to conceal the fact that they played in a stadium 
built and decorated for another team, the stadium grounds crew was assigned 
to make the stadium more Jet-friendly during Jets games by putting up green 
banners and placing the Jets' logo over the Giants'. No change could be 
made to the blue and red seating bowl.[39] The Jets were featured in the 
first NFL playoff game in the stadium's history, falling to the Patriots 
on December 28, 1985.[39] As the Jets sought to become a stronger franchise 
and remove themselves from their counterparts' shadow, the team entered 
into negotiations with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in an 
attempt to build a stadium on the west side of Manhattan, entering a bidding 
war with TransGas Energy Systems and Cablevision for the rights to the 
West Side Yard property—Hess, prior to his death, had been approached by 
former mayor Rudy Giuliani about bringing the team to the West Side when 
their lease at Giants Stadium expired in 2008.[40][41] Cablevision was 
fixated against the Jets owning the land as Madison Square Garden, located 
only a few blocks away, would be forced to compete with the stadium.[40] 
Team owners had voted, 31–1, with the Buffalo Bills the only objectors, 
to award the 2010 Super Bowl to New York contingent on the Jets winning 
the bid and completing construction of the stadium prior to 2010.[40] The 
MTA unanimously voted to sell the land to the Jets for approximately $210 
million as the committee agreed that having the stadium would be beneficial 
in the long run.[42] An angry Cablevision, community groups and transportation 
advocates were determined to derail the Jets' attempts at building the 
stadium and two lawsuits challenging the construction of the stadium on 
environmental grounds were filed.[43] Though confident they could secure 
the stadium, their hopes were dashed when Sheldon Silver and Joseph L. 
Bruno, both of whom held veto power over the stadium construction, refused 
to support the project, alleging it would hurt rather than help the development 
of the West Side.[43][44] Defeated, the Jets agreed to enter a 50–50 partnership 
with their rival, the Giants, to build a new stadium effectively agreeing 
to a 99-year lease, which the Giants had signed earlier in the year, to 
remain in New Jersey.[45] The stadium, known as MetLife Stadium, became 
the first in the history of the NFL to be jointly built by two franchises.[46] 
The stadium, which is illuminated in different colors depending on which 
team is hosting a game, opened in April 2010 and saw the Jets and Giants 
open the stadium together in a preseason exhibition game.[47][48] The Jets' 
first regular season home game at the new stadium was held on September 
13, 2010 and was shown nationwide on Monday Night Football. New York lost 
to the Ravens 10–9.[49] Team owners voted to have the stadium host Super 
Bowl XLVIII, held in 2014.[47] Since the inception of the American Football 
League, the Jets have maintained what is considered to be a marquee rivalry 
with the New England Patriots.[50] The rivalry was relatively docile in 
its early years until 1966 when the Jets removed the Patriots, who had 
hopes of appearing in Super Bowl I, from playoff contention with a 38–28 
defeat at Shea Stadium.[51] The Patriots returned the favor in 1985 when 
the Jets lost to New England 26–14 in the wild card round; the Patriots 
went on to Super Bowl XX where they were defeated by the Bears.[51] The 
rivalry began to escalate and receive increased media attention in 1997 
when a disgruntled Bill Parcells vacated his head coaching position with 
New England to accept the same position with New York.[50] The following 
year, the Jets signed Pro Bowl running back Curtis Martin from the Patriots.[50] 
After the Jets declined during Parcells' third year, Parcells decided to 
resign as head coach. His assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the next 
day in order to become the head coach of the Patriots instead.[52][53] 
A critical turning point of the rivalry took place on September 23, 2001 
when Jets linebacker Mo Lewis tackled Drew Bledsoe, leaving the veteran 
with internal bleeding. This provided an opportunity for Tom Brady to take 
over as the starting quarterback and during his tenure, Brady successfully 
guided New England to four Super Bowl titles.[54] In 2006, Eric Mangini, 
an assistant under Belichick, left New England to join the Jets as their 
head coach. Under Mangini, the famous Spygate incident took place, further 
escalating tensions between both clubs.[55] When Rex Ryan was hired as 
the team's head coach, the rivalry further escalated due to an increased 
war of words between both teams. In January 2011, the two met in a Divisional 
Round playoff game. The visiting Jets pulled a 28–21 upset to advance to 
the AFC Championship Game, which they ultimately lost one week later to 
the Pittsburgh Steelers.[51][56] New York has maintained a rivalry with 
the Miami Dolphins since the Dolphins' inception in 1966. One of the most 
famous games in Jets history took place in 1994 when the Dolphins ran the 
Fake Spike play, giving them an improbable victory and halting the Jets' 
momentum that season, serving as a precursor to the Jets' next two unsuccessful 
years under Rich Kotite.[57] The Jets went on to complete an improbable 
victory of their own on October 23, 2000 in what is known as The Monday 
Night Miracle.[58] The Jets, trailing the Dolphins 30–7 at the end of the 
third quarter, rallied in the fourth quarter scoring 23 unanswered points, 
eventually winning in overtime with a 40-yard John Hall kick.[58] When 
Rex Ryan became New York's head coach, there was an increased war of words 
between the clubs culminating with Ryan flashing an obscene gesture to 
heckling Dolphins fans in January 2010.[59] The rivalry continued between 
both teams when Sal Alosi, then the strength and conditioning coach of 
the Jets, tripped Dolphins cornerback Nolan Carroll.[60] Carroll was not 
seriously injured and Alosi resigned nearly two months later.[60] The New 
York Jets previously maintained a high tension rivalry against their in-town 
counterparts, the New York Giants, that has since diminished due to the 
infrequency with which the teams meet in the regular season.[61] The pinnacle 
of the rivalry came on August 17, 1969 when both the Jets and Giants met 
for the first time, in a preseason game which was viewed as a "turf war" 
by both opponents.[61] The Giants, considered a mediocre team at the time, 
were regarded as underdogs and were under much scrutiny by the media and 
their fans.[61] Ultimately, the Jets bested their rival 37–14; this would 
result in the firing of Giants coach Allie Sherman.[61] The Jets met the 
Giants in 1988 during the final game of the regular season.[62] The Jets, 
with a 7–7–1 record, had little to lose as their hopes for playoff contention 
had vanished.[62] The Giants, however, were contending for a playoff spot 
and a victory would have secured their spot and their division title.[62] 
Although the six point favorites,[62] the Giants were unable to overcome 
the Jets defense which saw the Jets sack quarterback Phil Simms eight times.[63] 
With the Jets' victory and victories by the Rams and Eagles, the Giants 
were eliminated from playoff contention and the Jets gained respect in 
the eyes of many.[63][64] In spite of the big sibling rivalry that has 
resulted in trash talk between the players, both teams have formed an unexpected 
and consequently strong partnership sharing Giants Stadium for 26 years 
and MetLife Stadium, a venture in which both teams own a 50% share of the 
stadium.[45][61][65] The rivalry regained much of its tension in the 2011 
NFL season when the Jets and Giants met in Week 16. Both teams needed a 
victory to keep their playoffs hope alive and there was significant trash 
talk between Rex Ryan and his players and many of the Giants in the weeks 
leading up to the game. Ryan and Giants running back Brandon Jacobs reportedly 
came close to blows after the game, a 29–14 win by the Giants.[66] The 
two teams met again on December 6, 2015, with the Jets winning 23–20 in 
overtime. The Jets' colors are hunter green and white. The team's current 
uniform and primary logo, in use since 1998, are modernized versions of 
the design used from 1965-77. The helmet is white with two parallel green 
stripes down the center, and a green facemask. The primary logo, which 
appears on each side of the helmet and on the jersey front by the player's 
left shoulder, is a green oval with the word "JETS" in thick white sans-serif 
italics over "NY" in outline serif lettering, and a white miniature football 
graphic at bottom center. The jerseys have standard one-color block numerals 
and serif lettering, alternating stripes on the shoulders, and opposite-colored 
sleeves and TV numerals. The team uses both white pants with two parallel 
green stripes from hip to knee on each side, and green pants with white 
stripes. The team's original uniforms, as the Titans of New York in 1960, 
were navy blue with old gold numerals, gold pants with two parallel blue 
stripes on each side, and navy blue helmets with a single gold stripe down 
the center and no logo decals. The white jerseys had navy blue numerals. 
In 1961 the Titans added UCLA-style shoulder stripes (gold and white on 
the blue jerseys, gold and navy blue on the white jerseys), changed the 
pants striping to a blue stripe flanked by white stripes, and employed 
a somewhat brighter shade of gold. When the Titans became the Jets in 1963, 
navy and gold were abandoned in favor of kelly green and white. The jerseys 
had thick opposite-colored stripes on the shoulders, sleeves and cuffs, 
with the TV numerals set within the broader sleeve stripe. The pants were 
white with two parallel green stripes on each side. The new helmets were 
white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo on each side 
was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the word "JETS" in thick 
white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. In 1964, the single green 
stripe became two parallel stripes, and the jet-plane decal was replaced 
with a white football shape outlined in green, with the word "JETS" in 
thick green sans-serif italics in front of "NY" in green outline serif 
lettering, and a miniature football at bottom center. The decals were difficult 
to see from a distance (or on television), so the colors were reversed 
in 1965. This design remained largely unchanged through 1977, apart from 
some variations to the numeral and lettering typefaces, the angle of the 
helmet decals, and adjustments to the shoulder and sleeve striping due 
to changes in NFL jersey tailoring and materials. The Jets' first major 
design change was made for the 1978 season. The kelly green and white color 
scheme was retained; the new helmets were solid green with white facemasks, 
and a stylized "JETS" wordmark in white on each side. The mark featured 
angular lettering and a silhouette of a modern jet airplane extending horizontally 
to the right from the top of the "J" above the "ETS". The jerseys featured 
large TV numerals on the shoulders and two thick parallel stripes on the 
sleeves, while the pants had a single green stripe from hip to knee on 
each side. In 1990, the Jets modified this design by adding thin black 
outlines to the numerals, lettering, stripes and helmet decals, changing 
the facemasks from white to black, and adding a set of green pants to be 
worn with the white jerseys. The Jets adopted their current uniform and 
logo design in 1998. Green pants were added in 2002, and have been worn 
with both the white and green jerseys. The Jets were the first NFL team 
to wear a "throwback" uniform, in 1993 for a home game against the Cincinnati 
Bengals celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1968 championship team. 
The jersey and pants mimicked the 1963-77 design, although the team wore 
its regular green helmets with a white-outlined version of the 1965-77 
logo decal. In 1994, as part of the NFL's 75th Anniversary celebration, 
the Jets wore both home and road versions of this uniform in select games, 
again using their regular green helmets with the 1965-77 logo but with 
two parallel white stripes down the center. In 2007, the team introduced 
a new "throwback" uniform, evoking the original Titans of New York and 
combining elements of the 1960 and 1961-62 uniforms, with navy blue helmets 
and jerseys, old gold numerals and helmet stripes, gold and white shoulder 
stripes, and gold pants with blue and white stripes on each side. These 
uniforms appeared again in 2008, 2009 and 2011, with a white jersey variation 
also appearing in 2009 as part of the NFL's celebration of the American 
Football League's 50th anniversary. The team originally named the Jets 
Flag Crew was established in 2006.[67] In 2007, the group underwent an 
expansion and was appropriately renamed the Jets Flight Crew.[68] The squad 
regularly performs choreographed routines during the team's home contests. 
Auditions have been held annually since their inception to attract new 
members. The Jets Junior Flight Crew was established in 2010 offering children 
the opportunity to train with the Flight Crew while improving their "talent 
and abilities in a non-competitive environment."[69] The Jets' current 
flagship radio station is WEPN 98.7 ESPN with Bob Wischusen, as the play-by-play 
announcer and former Jet Marty Lyons of the Sack Exchange, as the color 
analyst.[70][71] Any preseason games not nationally televised are shown 
on WCBS-TV.[72] SportsNet New York, which serves as the official home of 
the Jets, airs over 250 hours of "exclusive, in depth" material on the 
team in high definition.[73] Any Monday Night Football games that have 
the Jets playing on ESPN are also aired on WPIX-TV or WABC-TV as per the 
local carriage rules (WABC-TV, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company, 
also owns 80% of ESPN although ABC Owned Television Stations have the right 
of first refusal for ESPN's simulcasts of those games within a team's home 
market). If the Jets play on Thursday Night Football on the NFL Network, 
the game will be simulcast on WCBS-TV or WPIX-TV (WCBS-TV is also given 
a right of first refusal to have a local simulcast of the game on the NFL 
Network). This is a partial list of the Jets' last five completed seasons.

Martin, Maynard, and Namath are recognized based upon their achievements 
with the Jets. Ewbank is also recognized based upon his achievements with 
the Baltimore Colts, coaching them to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959. 
Riggins is recognized primarily for his seasons with the Washington Redskins 
(1976–79, 81–85), as is Monk (1980–93), who won three Super Bowl championships 
with Washington. Lott is in the Hall of Fame primarily for his exploits 
as a member of the San Francisco 49ers.[74] Baugh and Turner are recognized 
based upon their achievements as players with other teams, rather than 
their head coaching stints with the Jets.[75][76] While Parcells reversed 
the fortunes of the Jets, he had major impact for the New York Giants, 
coaching them to two Super Bowl victories.[77] Wolf only had a brief stint 
with the Jets between 1990 and 1991, while most of his major contributions 
occurred as an executive and player personnel director with the Oakland 
Raiders (1963–1974, 1979–1989), and later as General Manager of the Green 
Bay Packers (1991–2001).[78] Favre only played one season as a member of 
the Jets in 2008, between most of his career with the Packers (1992–2007) 
and his last two NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings (2009–2010). The 
Jets established a Ring of Honor on July 20, 2010, to commemorate former 
alumni.[79] Each season, players will be nominated by an internal committee 
and then inducted into the Ring. There is no specific amount of honorees 
to be selected each year.[79] The following Titans/Jets were selected to 
the American Football League All-Time Team on January 14, 1970. The first 
and second teams were determined by a panel of members of the AFL's Hall 
of Fame Board of Selectors:[80][81][82][83] New York announced their official 
All-Time Four Decade team in 2003 which, was determined by the fans of 
the team.[84] Perhaps the most famous of the Jets' first round picks came 
in 1965 when they selected Alabama quarterback Joe Namath who boosted the 
Jets into the national spotlight with his boisterous personality and lifestyle.[85] 
His physical talents on the field helped improve the Jets' fortunes, leading 
them to victory over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.[85] Though 
injuries hampered the latter part of Namath's career, he is best remembered, 
according to former teammate John Dockery, as "a guy that came along and 
broke a lot of the conventions."[85] Namath was inducted into the Hall 
of Fame in 1985.[85] Perhaps one of the most disappointing players in Jets 
history was running back Blair Thomas. Thomas, who averaged 5.4 yards per 
carry at Penn State, was an intriguing prospect the Jets were interested 
in utilizing to help their cumbersome offense.[86] Confident in their decision, 
the Jets drafted Thomas with the second overall pick in 1990, expecting 
him to be a solid player for years to come.[86] Thomas ran for only 620 yards 
in 1990, and failed to meet the high expectations.[86] By the time Thomas 
left the team as an unrestricted free agent in 1993, he had rushed for 
2,009 yards and only five touchdowns.[86] The 2008 first round pick, defensive 
lineman Vernon Gholston, followed a similar path, failing to record a sack 
during his three-year tenure with the team.[87] In the 2013–14 seasons, 
one of the Jets' strongest units has been their defensive line, manned 
by 1st Round selections Muhammad Wilkerson (2011) and Sheldon Richardson 
(2013). In 2013, Wilkerson ended the season with 10.5 sacks, matching the 
last Jets player to have more than 10 sacks in a single season, John Abraham 
in 2005. Also that year, Richardson was honored with an award from the 
AP for Defensive Rookie of the Year.[88] The Jets' run defense was stout 
with all three in the line up, finishing fifth as a team in rushing yards 
allowed in 2014.[89] → Coaching Staff → Staff Directory → More NFL staffs
