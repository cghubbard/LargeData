four games) did not advance out of Single-A until 2001, compiling an ERA 
of 4.64 in a full season at Double-A Greenville. After that season, he 
was traded to the San Diego Padres for Rudy Seánez, and then the following 
spring to the Chicago Cubs for Syketo Anderson, and after 11 appearances,

finished the 2002 season at Double-A Wichita with a solid 3.32 ERA. At 
the end of the season, he was signed by the New York Yankees. He did not 
play in 2003 due to injury, and was released in January of 2004. He was

an ERA of 5.68 in Triple-A. In 2004, he was released again, played a bit 
in the Mexican league, and was signed by the Baltimore Orioles in December

had his first good Triple-A season, appearing in 46 games with an ERA of 
2.48, and, at age 29 finally was called up to the big leagues. Unfortunately 
for him, in his seven appearances, he pitched 8 innings, but allowed 10 
hits, 6 walks, and 9 runs, for an ERA of 10.13 In 2007, the Washington 
Nationals signed him to a minor league contract, and he started the spring 
at Triple-A Columbus in an outstanding fashion, pitching 18 innings and 
allowing only one run. On May 8, he was called up, and in his first 11 
appearances, had allowed runs in only two games, amassing an ERA of 2.31. 
But then over his next 8 appearances, he allowed runs in seven games, and 
his ERA ballooned to 6.38; on June 20, he was designated for assignment.
