Ten Cent Beer Night was a promotion held by Major League Baseball's Cleveland 
Indians during a game against the Texas Rangers at Cleveland Stadium on 
Tuesday, June 4, 1974.[1][2] The idea behind the promotion was to attract 
more fans to the game by offering 12 US fluid ounces (350 ml) cups of 3.2% 
beer for just 10 cents each (equivalent to $0.48 in 2015), a substantial 
discount on the regular price of 65 cents (equivalent to $3.12 in 2015), 
with a limit of six beers per purchase,[3] but with no limit on the number 
of purchases made during the game. During the game, fans became heavily 
intoxicated, culminating in a riot in the ninth inning which caused the 
game to be forfeited due to the crowd's uncontrollable rowdiness and because 
the game could not be resumed in a timely manner.[1] The Indians had previously 
held such promotions without incident, beginning with Nickel Beer Day in 
1971.[4] However, a bench-clearing brawl in the teams' last meeting one 
week earlier at Arlington Stadium in Texas left some Indians fans harboring 
a grudge against the Rangers. In Texas, the trouble had started in the 
bottom of the fourth inning with a walk to the Rangers' Tom Grieve, followed 
by a Lenny Randle single. The next batter hit a double play ball to Indians 
third baseman John Lowenstein; he stepped on the third base bag to retire 
Grieve and threw the ball to second base, but Randle disrupted the play 
with a hard slide into second baseman Jack Brohamer.[5] The Indians retaliated 
in the bottom of the eighth when pitcher Milt Wilcox threw behind Randle's 
legs. Randle eventually laid down a bunt. When Wilcox attempted to field 
it and tag Randle out (which he did successfully), Randle hit him with 
his forearm. Indians first baseman John Ellis responded by punching Randle, 
and both benches emptied for a brawl. After the brawl was broken up, as 
Indians players and coaches returned to the dugout, they were struck by 
food and beer hurled by Rangers fans; catcher Dave Duncan had to be restrained 
from going into the stands to brawl with fans.[5] The game was not suspended 
or forfeited, no players from either team were ejected, and the Rangers 
won 3–0.[6] After the game, a Cleveland reporter asked Rangers manager 
Billy Martin "Are you going to take your armor to Cleveland?" to which 
Martin replied, "Naw, they won't have enough fans there to worry about."[7] 
During the week leading up to the teams' next meeting in Cleveland, sports 
radio talk show host Pete Franklin and Indians radio announcer Joe Tait 
made comments that fueled the fans' animosity toward the Rangers. In addition, 
The Plain Dealer printed a cartoon the day of the game showing Chief Wahoo 
holding a pair of boxing gloves with the caption, "Be ready for anything."[8] 
Six days after the brawl in Texas, Cleveland's Ten Cent Beer Night promotion 
drew 25,134 fans to Cleveland Stadium for the Indians-Rangers game, twice 
the number expected.[9] The Rangers quickly took a 5–1 lead. Meanwhile, 
throughout the game, the inebriated crowd grew more and more unruly. Early 
in the game, Cleveland's Leron Lee hit a line drive into the stomach of 
Rangers pitcher Ferguson Jenkins, after which Jenkins dropped to the ground. 
Fans in the upper deck of the stadium cheered, then chanted "Hit 'em again! 
Hit 'em again! Harder! Harder!" A woman ran out to the Indians' on-deck 
circle and flashed her breasts, and a naked man sprinted to second base 
as Grieve hit his second home run of the game. One inning later, a father-and-son 
pair ran onto the outfield and mooned the fans in the bleachers. As the 
game progressed, more fans ran onto the field and caused problems. Ranger 
Mike Hargrove, who would later manage the Indians and lead them to the 
World Series twice in 1995 and 1997, was pelted with hot dogs and spit, 
and at one point was nearly struck by an empty gallon jug of Thunderbird. 
The Rangers later argued a call in which Lee was called safe in a close 
play at third base, spiking Jenkins with his cleats in the process and 
forcing him to leave the game. The Rangers' angry response to this call 
enraged Cleveland fans, who again began throwing objects onto the field. 
Someone tossed lit firecrackers into the Rangers' bullpen.[10] In the bottom 
of the ninth, the Indians managed to rally, tying the game 5–5, and had 
Rusty Torres on second base representing the potential winning run. However, 
with a crowd that had been drinking heavily for nine innings, the situation 
finally came to a head. After the Indians had managed to tie the game, 
a 19-year-old fan named Terry Yerkic[11] ran onto the field and attempted 
to steal Texas outfielder Jeff Burroughs' cap.[12] Confronting the fan, 
Burroughs tripped. Thinking that Burroughs had been attacked, Texas manager 
Billy Martin charged onto the field with his players right behind, some 
wielding bats. A large number of intoxicated fans – some armed with knives, 
chains, and portions of stadium seats that they had torn apart – surged 
onto the field, and others hurled bottles from the stands. Hundreds of 
fans surrounded the outnumbered Rangers.[10] Realizing that the Rangers' 
lives might be in danger, Cleveland manager Ken Aspromonte ordered his 
players to grab bats and help the Rangers, attacking the team's own fans 
in the process. Rioters began throwing steel folding chairs, and Cleveland 
relief pitcher Tom Hilgendorf was hit in the head by one of them. Hargrove, 
after subduing one rioter in a fistfight, had to fight another on his way 
back to the Texas dugout. The two teams retreated off the field through 
the dugouts in groups, with players protecting each other.[10] The bases 
were pulled up and stolen and many rioters threw a vast array of objects 
including cups, rocks, bottles, batteries from radios, hot dogs, popcorn 
containers, and folding chairs. As a result, umpire crew chief Nestor Chylak, 
realizing that order would not be restored in a timely fashion, forfeited 
the game to Texas. He too was a victim of the rioters, as one struck and 
cut his head with part of a stadium seat[13] and his hand was cut by a 
thrown rock. He later called the fans "uncontrollable beasts" and stated 
that he'd never seen anything like what had happened, "except in a zoo".[14] 
As Joe Tait and Herb Score called the riot live on radio, Score mentioned 
the security guards' inability to handle the crowd. He said, "Aw, this 
is absolute tragedy." The Cleveland Police Department finally arrived to 
restore order.[10] Later, Cleveland general manager Phil Seghi blamed the 
umpires for losing control of the game. The Sporting News wrote that "Seghi's 
perspective might have been different had he been in Chylak's shoes, in 
the midst of knife-wielding, bottle-throwing, chair-tossing, fist-swinging 
drunks."[15] The next Beer Night promotion on July 18 attracted 41,848 
fans with beer again selling for 10 cents per cup but with a limit of two 
cups per purchase.[16] American League president Lee MacPhail commented, 
"There was no question that beer played a part in the riot."[13] Among 
the Indians players fleeing was outfielder Rusty Torres. In his career, 
Torres wound up seeing three big-league baseball riots close up (all of 
which resulted in forfeits): in addition to this game, he had been with 
the New York Yankees at the Senators' final game in Washington in 1971, 
and he would be with the Chicago White Sox during the infamous Disco Demolition 
Night in 1979. NBC newscaster Tim Russert, then a student at the Cleveland–Marshall 
College of Law, attended the game. "I went with $2 in my pocket," recalled 
the Meet the Press host. "You do the math."[17] Coordinates: 41°30′22″N
