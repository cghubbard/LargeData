Progressive Field is a baseball park located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, 
United States.[16] It is the home field of the Cleveland Indians of Major 
League Baseball and together with Quicken Loans Arena, is part of the Gateway 
Sports and Entertainment Complex.[17] It was ranked as Major League Baseball's 
best ballpark in a 2008 Sports Illustrated fan opinion poll.[18] The Ballpark 
was used for the 2016 World Series when the Cleveland Indians and Chicago 
Cubs played the world series. The ballpark was named Jacobs Field after 
team owners Richard and David Jacobs, from its inaugural season in 1994 
until 2008, when its name was changed to Progressive Field after its naming 
rights were purchased by locally based Progressive Insurance Company. The 
ballpark is often referred to as "The Jake", based on its original name.[19] 
The Cleveland Indians previously played home games at Cleveland Stadium, 
which they shared with the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League. 
The Indians first played at the stadium, which seated nearly 80,000 people 
for baseball, for the 1932 and 1933 seasons, but returned to smaller League 
Park for most games in 1934. From 1936 to 1946, they played weekend and 
holiday games at Cleveland Stadium, and eventually night games and other 
dates where larger crowds were expected, moving to the stadium full-time 
in 1947. Cleveland Stadium was the largest stadium in the American League 
during its tenure as a baseball facility and was the largest stadium in 
Major League Baseball for all but a few seasons.[20] Plans for a new stadium 
first began in 1984 when Cuyahoga County voters defeated a property tax 
for building a 100% publicly funded domed stadium, which would have been 
shared by the Indians and Browns. Later that year, committee leaders met 
to re-evaluate these plans, and a location was later agreed upon. The eventual 
site of the stadium, the location of the Central Market, was acquired in 
December 1985. In April 1986, designs for the new stadium were agreed upon 
and about a year later, demolition at the site started.[11] Cuyahoga County 
voters approved a 15-year sin tax on alcohol and cigarette sales in May 
1990 to finance the new Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, which 
included the ballpark, an adjacent arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers of 
the National Basketball Association (NBA), and two parking garages.[21] 
Construction started in January 1992, and by May of that year, the concrete 
construction had been poured. In June 1992, Mel Harder, who pitched the 
opening game at Cleveland Stadium in 1932,[22] and contemporary stars Charles 
Nagy and Sandy Alomar, Jr., executed the ceremonial first pitch at the 
site of the new ballpark before construction began. The installation of 
seating was completed in October 1993. The ballpark, which was referred 
to as "Cleveland Indians Baseball Park" and "Indians Park" on blueprints, 
cost approximately $175 million to build, of which $91 million was provided 
by Indians owner Richard Jacobs. The remaining $84 million was raised by 
the sin tax.[14] An open house was held April 1, 1994, and the following 
day, an exhibition game was held against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[23] The 
first official game was held April 4. U.S. President Bill Clinton threw 
out the ceremonial first pitch, and the Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners 
4–3 in 11 innings in front of a crowd of 41,459 people.[24] The ballpark 
was the first new major sporting facility to open in Cleveland since Cleveland 
Arena opened in 1937. During that inaugural and strike-shortened 1994 season, 
the Indians finished 35–16 at home, which included an 18-game home winning 
streak.[25][11] The ballpark hosted playoff games for the first time in 
1995 as the Indians ended a 41-year playoff drought. The first playoff 
game was on October 3, a 5–4 win in 11 innings over the Boston Red Sox 
in Game 1 of the American League Division Series. Jacobs Field also played 
host to Games 3, 4, and 5 of the American League Championship Series against 
the Seattle Mariners and Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1995 World Series against 
the Atlanta Braves. Two years later, Jacobs Field hosted its first All-Star 
Game and the first All Star Game in Cleveland since 1981. Later that year, 
the Indians hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1997 World Series against the 
Florida Marlins. It was the tenth time in Major League history the All-Star 
Game and games of the World Series were played in the same facility in 
the same season, and the first time since 1977. The longest home run in 
ballpark history was hit by Jim Thome on July 3, 1999, measured at 511 
feet (156 m) to center field.[26][11] During the eighth inning of Game 
2 of the 2007 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees 
on October 5, a swarm of insects believed to be midges from Lake Erie, 
enveloped the playing field, severely distracting Yankees relief pitcher 
Joba Chamberlain, which caused him to walk outfielder Grady Sizemore, who 
later scored the tying run on a wild pitch. The incident became known as 
the "Bug Game"; however, this was not the first time the insects plagued 
Jacobs Field.[27] An event called "Snow Days" debuted at Progressive Field 
in November 2010. The first day, called "Snopening Day", was held on November 
26 and the event continued until January 2, 2011. An ice skating track 
called the "Frozen Mile" was installed around the warning track, the "Batterhorn" 
was a snow tubing hill on the bleachers and other events were staged around 
the field and home run porch.[28] "Snow Days" returned in November 2011, 
and closed on January 16. The Batterhorn was moved to the Toyota Home Run 
porch and the Frozen Mile was rerouted. The park also added the "Frozen 
Diamond", an ice rink covering the infield. On January 15, 2012, the park 
hosted its first ice hockey game, a match between the Ohio State Buckeyes 
and the Michigan Wolverines, the first outdoor college hockey game in Ohio.[29] 
On June 1, 2012, it was announced that "Snow Days" would not run in 2012 
due to low attendance in 2011. In part, this was caused by the warmest 
winter on record, with temperatures of 60 °F (16 °C) on "Snopening Day."[30] 
Progressive Field set a new MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 
4, 2001 in selling out 455 straight games.[31] Demand for tickets was so 
great that all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate 
seasons.[11] The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout 
record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park 
recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008.[32] The record for 
the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 
ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game.[11] On Saturday, April 2, 2011, 
the Indians' lowest attendance record was broken with a very small crowd 
of 9,853,[19] and again the following day with an even smaller attendance 
figure of 8,726.[33] Naming rights were acquired in 1994 by team owner 
Richard Jacobs, who paid for rights until the end of 2006. The Jacobs Field 
name gave rise to the nickname "The Jake" for the ballpark.[34] The Indians 
announced on January 11, 2008, that naming rights to the park had been 
purchased by Progressive Corporation, a major insurance company headquartered 
in the nearby suburb of Mayfield, Ohio.[34] Removal of the iconic Jacobs 
Field sign on the front of the building began the morning of January 18,[35] 
and the replacement sign was installed on March 25.[36] Progressive agreed 
to pay $57.6 million for the naming rights for 16 years.[37][38] There 
were discussions about instead naming the ballpark "Progressive Park"; 
however, it was later realized that this name belonged to a picnic facility 
in Council Bluffs, Iowa, so the name "Progressive Field" was decided upon 
instead.[38] The Indians extended their lease agreement with Gateway Economic 
Development Corp. for the stadium in August 2008 from 2013 to 2023. The 
agreement gives the team four five-year renewal options after 2023.[39] 
The ballpark was designed by HOK Sport, now known as Populous, a division 
of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum. HOK designed it as the second retro-modern 
ballpark,[40] with asymmetrical fences of varying heights, a smaller upper 
deck, and stepped tiers. It is similar to HOK's Oriole Park at Camden Yards 
in Baltimore, which was the first retro-modern ballpark. The ballpark was 
sited to give a favorable view of Cleveland's downtown skyline. The structural 
engineering was done by a Cleveland company, Osborn Engineering, which 
helped design League Park, Cleveland Municipal Stadium, "Old" Yankee Stadium 
and Fenway Park.[41] It was designed to blend in with the city of Cleveland 
with its exposed steel design and the vertical light towers which very 
much resemble enormous toothbrushes.[42] The ballpark has numerous unique 
structural features. The field is situated on 12-acre (4.9 ha) of Kentucky 
Bluegrass.[11] It is illuminated by 19 white vertical light towers; three 
behind the scoreboard, six behind first base, six behind third base and 
four in right field, which stand 200 feet (61 m) above street level and 
218 feet (66 m) above the playing field and are said to resemble oversized 
toothbrushes. The distinctive light towers were incorporated into a version 
of the original Jacobs Field logo and the 1997 MLB All-Star Game logo.[43] 
The park features distinctive dimensions; left and right field are both 
325 feet (99 m) from homeplate, but left field has a 19-foot (6 m) high 
wall, known as the "Little Green Monster".[44][45] The center and right 
field walls are 9 feet (3 m) high. The park features traditional hunter 
green seats angled at 8-12° on three tiers around the park except for center 
field which has no seats and left field which uses bleachers.[12][46] The 
bullpens, reconfigured between the 2014 and 2015 seasons, are raised above 
the playing field, which allows fans to see pitchers warming up. Both bullpens 
are located adjacent to section 103 behind right-center field, with the 
Indians' bullpen closer to the field.[11][47] Like the majority of ballparks, 
the Indians' dugout is along the third base line and the visitors' dugout 
is located along the first base line.[12] When the ballpark was built it 
contained 121 luxury boxes. A remodel and renovation between the 2014 and 
2015 seasons removed six of them for a new total of 115, the second most 
in Major League Baseball.[48] Prior to the start of the 1997 season, two 
sections with 480 seats were added onto the ends of the bleacher section.[49] 
In 2004, South Dakota-based company Daktronics installed the then-largest 
video display at a sports venue in the world, measuring 36 feet (11 m) 
high by 149 feet (45 m) wide. The out-of-town scoreboard along the left 
field wall was also replaced.[50] A new scoreboard system was installed 
for the 2016 season. The main scoreboard above the bleachers measures 59 
feet (18 m) high by 221 feet (67 m) wide with 13,000 square feet (1,200 m2) 
of screen space.[51] In 2007, the Indians became the first American League 
team to install solar panels on their stadium.[52] They also spent $1.1 
million to convert a picnic area behind the center field fence into "Heritage 
Park", which features 27 plaques honoring the Cleveland Indians Hall of 
Fame and 38 bricks, representing the team's most memorable moments. There 
is also a memorial plaque commemorating Ray Chapman which was originally 
installed at League Park. This area is shielded by plantings so it does 
not interfere with the batter's eye.[53] Prior to Opening Day 2012, the 
Indians installed a corkscrew-shaped wind turbine atop Progressive Field, 
the first major league team to do so. The corkscrew–shaped wind turbine, 
however, was subsequently removed prior to Opening Day 2013.[52] In 2014, 
it was announced that Progressive Field would go under construction to 
update its look. Gate C was altered, giving it a "dramatic entrance" and 
"dramatic views of Cleveland's skyline." A two-story bar was added, providing 
better views of the field as the Batter's Eye Bar was often overcrowded 
on summer days. New bullpens were also added, allowing fans much better 
views of players warming up. Statues of Jim Thome, Bob Feller, and Larry 
Doby were consolidated to the Gate area. Along with this, Gate C was opened 
up giving it more natural light, as it used to be a dark corridor. This 
area now has food and drink venues from neighborhoods of Cleveland. The 
Kid's Clubhouse was made 2 stories, and adults are now able to view the 
game from the clubhouse. The Upper-Reserved area in right field no longer 
has traditional seating, and now has terraced decks for group outings. 
Most notably, the old scoreboard was taken off and a new, 59 foot high, 
221 foot wide scoreboard was installed for the 2016 season. The ballpark 
features several eateries from which spectators can watch the game. A glass-enclosed 
multilevel restaurant named the "Terrace Club" is located along the left 
field foul line on the suite level. Spectators need a valid game ticket 
and a pass to enter into the Terrace Club. On non-game days it is used 
for private and corporate events, such as business meetings, parties and 
weddings.[54][55] The "Budweiser Patio" is a buffet eatery used mostly 
for corporate or private parties, located just behind the right field foul 
pole between the visitors' bullpen and section 117.[56] A new children's 
play area named "Kids Clubhouse", located on the mezzanine level, opened 
in May 2012. It includes arts and crafts areas, a climbing wall, a mini 
field where children can practice sliding and fielding, a batting cage, 
as well as large windows where adults can watch the game from the Kids 
Clubhouse.[57] All firsts are by the Cleveland Indians unless otherwise
