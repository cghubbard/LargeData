Félix Mantilla Lamela (born July 29, 1934 in Isabela, Puerto Rico) is a 
former Major League Baseball player. In his 11-year career, Mantilla played 
for the Milwaukee Braves (1956–61), New York Mets (1962), Boston Red Sox 
(1963–65) and Houston Astros (1966). An infielder/outfielder, he played 
second base the majority of his career (326 games). He also played shortstop 
(180 games), third base (143), the outfield (156) and, in the latter part 
of his career, first base (16). He batted and threw right-handed. Mantilla 
and two other black players joined the Jacksonville Braves of the Class-A 
South Atlantic League in 1953. This was one of the first two integrated 
baseball teams in the Southern United States. During this time Mantilla 
was the roommate of Hank Aaron. Mantilla and Aaron were both called up 
to the major leagues, playing for the Milwaukee Braves. Both were on the 
team when they won the World Series title in 1957. He was selected by the 
New York Mets in the expansion draft and became their most regular third 
baseman in 1962, establishing career highs in batting average, home runs 
and RBI (.275, 11 and 59 respectively). At the end of the season he was 
traded to the Red Sox for three players, two of whom were Pumpsie Green 
and Tracy Stallard. Mantilla's numbers improved dramatically in the hitter-friendly 
Fenway Park: he hit .315 in 66 games in 1963, hit .289 with 30 home runs 
in 1964 (five fewer than he had hit in his career prior to that season), 
and set a career high with 92 RBIs in 1965. During this latter year, he 
was also named to the American League All-Star team for the only time in 
his career. Prior to the start of the 1966 season, the Red Sox traded Mantilla 
to the Houston Astros for Eddie Kasko.[1] He spent that year as a utility 
player before being released on November 28. The Chicago Cubs signed Mantilla 
as a free agent before the start of the 1967 season; however, during spring 
training he suffered an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery.[2] 
He never played a game for them and was released on July 6. He went to 
spring training with the Cubs in 1968 as a non-roster player; at the end 
of camp the Cubs signed him to a minor league contract,[3] but he never 
appeared in another professional game. A lifetime .261 hitter, Mantilla 
compiled 89 home runs with 330 runs batted in. On May 26, 1959, in the 
13th inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Milwaukee County 
Stadium, Mantilla ruined Harvey Haddix's bid for a perfect game. Leading 
off the inning, he hit a ground ball to third baseman Don Hoak, whose throw 
to first pulled Rocky Nelson off the bag for an error.[4] (Mantilla had 
not even been in the starting lineup; he entered the game in the 11th after 
Del Rice had pinch-hit for Johnny O'Brien.) Mantilla was sacrificed to 
second by Eddie Mathews, followed by an intentional walk to Hank Aaron. 
The following batter, Joe Adcock, hit one over the right-center field wall, 
just beyond Bill Virdon's outstretched glove, for an apparent 3–0 victory. 
Mantilla scored the winning run, but Aaron, thinking the ball was still 
in play and that the game ended when Mantilla scored the winning run, rounded 
second and then headed for the dugout. Adcock, running out his home run, 
passed Aaron on the bases; as a result, the ruling from National League 
president Warren Giles was that Adcock's hit was a double (not a home run),
