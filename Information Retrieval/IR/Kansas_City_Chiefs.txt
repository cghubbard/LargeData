American Football League (1960–1969) National Football League (1970–present) 
Red, Gold, White[2][3] League championships (2)† Division championships 
(8) In Dallas In Kansas City, Missouri The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional 
American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Chiefs compete 
in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's 
American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The team was founded 
in 1960 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter 
member of the American Football League (AFL). In 1963, the team relocated 
to Kansas City and assumed their current name.[4] The Chiefs joined the 
NFL as a result of the merger in 1970. The team is valued at just under 
$1 billion.[5] The Chiefs have won three AFL championships, in 1962, 1966, 
and 1969[6] and became the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to 
defeat an NFL team in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game, when they defeated 
the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV. The team's victory on January 11, 
1970, remains the club's last championship game victory and appearance 
to date, and occurred in the final such competition prior to the leagues' 
merger coming into full effect. The Chiefs were also the second team, after 
the Green Bay Packers, to appear in more than one Super Bowl (and the first 
AFL team to do so) and the first to appear in the championship game in 
two different decades. In the 2015 AFC Wild-Card playoff game, held at 
NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on January 9, 2016, the Chiefs defeated the 
Houston Texans 30–0 to earn their first NFL playoff win in 23 seasons, 
dating back to the 1993–94 NFL playoffs. The Chiefs' Wild-Card playoff 
victory ended what was at the time the third-longest drought in the NFL, 
and it also ended an NFL record eight-game playoff losing streak.[7] In 
1959, Lamar Hunt began discussions with other businessmen to establish 
a professional football league that would rival the National Football League.[6][8] 
Hunt's desire to secure a football team was heightened after watching the 
1958 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts.[8][9] 
After unsuccessful attempts to purchase and relocate the NFL's Chicago 
Cardinals to his hometown of Dallas, Texas,[6][10] Hunt went to the NFL 
and asked to create an expansion franchise in Dallas. The NFL turned him 
down, so Hunt then established the American Football League and started 
his own team, the Dallas Texans, to begin play in 1960. Hunt hired a little-known 
assistant coach from the University of Miami football team, Hank Stram, 
to be the team's head coach[8] after the job offer was declined by Bud 
Wilkinson and Tom Landry.[8] Also hired was Don Klosterman as head scout, 
credited by many for bringing a wealth of talent to the Texans after luring 
it away from the NFL, often hiding players and using creative means to 
land them. The Texans shared the Cotton Bowl with the NFL's cross-town 
competition Dallas Cowboys for three seasons. The Texans were to have exclusive 
access to the stadium until the NFL put an expansion team, The Dallas Cowboys, 
there.[8] While the team averaged a league-best 24,500 at the Cotton Bowl, 
the Texans gained less attention due to the AFL's relatively lower profile 
compared to the NFL.[8] In the franchise's first two seasons, the team 
managed only a 14–14 record.[11] In their third season, the Texans strolled 
to an 11–3 record and a berth in the team's first American Football League 
Championship Game, against the Houston Oilers.[10][11] The game was broadcast 
nationally on ABC and the Texans defeated the Oilers 20–17 in double overtime.[10] 
The game lasted 77 minutes and 54 seconds, which still stands as the longest 
championship game in professional football history.[10] It turned out to 
be the last game the team would play as the Dallas Texans. Despite competing 
against a Cowboys team that managed only a 9–28–3 record in their first 
three seasons, Hunt decided that the Dallas–Fort Worth media market could 
not sustain two professional football franchises.[10][12] He considered 
moving the Texans to either Atlanta or Miami for the 1963 season.[10] However, 
he was ultimately swayed by an offer from Kansas City Mayor Harold Roe 
Bartle.[10][12][13] Bartle promised to triple the franchise's season ticket 
sales and expand the seating capacity of Municipal Stadium to accommodate 
the team.[10][12][13] Hunt agreed to relocate the franchise to Kansas City 
on May 22, 1963, and on May 26 the team was renamed the Kansas City Chiefs.[10][12][13] 
Hunt and head coach Hank Stram initially planned to retain the Texans name, 
but a fan contest determined the new "Chiefs" name in honor of Mayor Bartle's 
nickname that he acquired in his professional role as Scout Executive of 
the St. Joseph and Kansas City Boy Scout Councils and founder of the Scouting 
Society, the Tribe of Mic-O-Say.[10][13] A total of 4,866 entries were 
received with 1,020 different names being suggested, including a total 
of 42 entrants who selected "Chiefs."[citation needed] The two names that 
received the most popular votes were "Mules" and "Royals" (which, 6 years 
later, would be the name of the city's Major League Baseball expansion 
franchise in 1969, after the Athletics left Kansas City for Oakland following 
the 1967 season).[citation needed] The franchise became one of the strongest 
teams in the now thriving American Football League,[6] with the most playoff 
appearances for an AFL team (tied with the Oakland Raiders), and the most 
AFL Championships (3).[10] The team's dominance helped Lamar Hunt become 
a central figure in negotiations with NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to 
agree on an AFL–NFL merger.[10][14] In the meetings between the two leagues, 
a merged league championship game was agreed to be played in January 1967 
following the conclusion of the leagues' respective 1966 seasons. Hunt 
insisted on calling the game the "Super Bowl" after seeing his children 
playing with a popular toy at the time, a Super Ball.[10][14][15] While 
the first few games were designated the "AFL–NFL World Championship Game", 
the Super Bowl name became its officially licensed title in years to come. 
The Chiefs cruised to an 11–2–1 record in 1966, and defeated the defending 
AFL Champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship Game.[16] The Chiefs 
were invited to play the NFL's league champion Green Bay Packers in the 
first AFL–NFL World Championship Game. Kansas City and Green Bay played 
a close game for the first half, but Green Bay took control in the final 
two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35–10.[10] The Chiefs lost 
the game but gained the respect of several Packers opponents following 
the game.[17] The Chiefs' interleague match-up with the Packers was not 
the last time that they would face an NFL opponent, especially on the championship 
stage.[10] The following August, Kansas City hosted the NFL's Chicago Bears 
in the 1967 preseason and won the game 66–24.[10] Despite losing to the 
division rival Oakland Raiders twice in the regular season in 1969, the 
two teams met for a third time in the AFL Championship Game where Kansas 
City won 17–7.[11] Backup quarterback Mike Livingston led the team in a 
six-game winning streak after Len Dawson suffered a leg injury which kept 
him out of most of the season's games.[10] While getting plenty of help 
from the club's defense, Dawson returned from the injury and led the Chiefs 
to Super Bowl IV.[10] Against the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings,[6] who 
were favored by 12½, the Chiefs dominated the game 23–7 to claim the team's 
first Super Bowl championship.[10] Dawson was named the game's Most Valuable 
Player after completing 12-of-17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown, 
with 1 interception.[18] The following season, the Chiefs and the rest 
of the American Football League merged with the National Football League 
after the AFL–NFL merger became official.[10] The Chiefs were placed in 
the American Football Conference's West Division.[11] From 1960 to 1969, 
the Chiefs/Texans won 87 games, which is the most in the 10-year history 
of the AFL.[19] In 1970, the Chiefs won only seven games in their first 
season in the NFL and missed the playoffs.[11] The following season, the 
Chiefs tallied a 10–3–1 record and won the AFC West Division.[20] Head 
coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they 
failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969.[20] Most of the 
pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still 
in place for the 1971 season.[20] The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins 
for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff 
game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime.[20] The Dolphins outlasted 
the Chiefs with a 37-yard field goal.[20] The game surpassed the 1962 AFL 
Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes and 40 seconds.[20] 
The game was also the final football game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium.[20] 
In 1972, the Chiefs moved into the newly constructed Arrowhead Stadium 
at the Truman Sports Complex outside of Downtown Kansas City.[20] The team's 
first game at Arrowhead was against the St. Louis Cardinals, a preseason 
game which the Chiefs won 24–14.[20] Linebacker Willie Lanier and quarterback 
Len Dawson won the NFL Man of the Year Award in 1972 and 1973, respectively. 
The Chiefs would not return to the post-season for the remainder of the 
1970s, and the 1973 season was the team's last winning effort for seven 
years.[20] Hank Stram was fired following a 5–9 season in 1974, and many 
of the Chiefs' future Hall of Fame players would depart by the middle of 
the decade.[20] From 1975 to 1988, the Chiefs had become a laughing stock 
of the NFL and provided Chiefs fans with nothing but futility.[21][22] 
Five head coaches struggled to achieve the same success as Stram, compiling 
an 81–121–1 record.[21] In 1980, Coach Marv Levy cut future Hall of Fame 
Kicker Jan Stenerud for little known Nick Lowery, who would become the 
most accurate kicker in NFL History over the next 14 years. In 1981, running 
back Joe Delaney rushed for 1,121 yards and was named the AFC Rookie of 
the Year.[23] The Chiefs finished the season with a 9–7 record and entered 
the 1982 season with optimism.[23] However, the NFL Players Association 
strike curbed the Chiefs' chances of returning to the postseason for the 
first time in over a decade.[23] The Chiefs tallied a 3–6 record[11] and 
in the off-season, Joe Delaney died while trying to save several children 
from drowning in a pond near his home in Louisiana.[24] The Chiefs made 
a mistake in drafting quarterback Todd Blackledge over future greats such 
as Jim Kelly and Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL Draft.[25][26] Blackledge never 
started a full season for Kansas City while Kelly and Marino played Hall 
of Fame careers.[26] While the Chiefs struggled on offense in the 1980s, 
the Chiefs had a strong defensive unit consisting of Pro Bowlers such as 
Bill Maas, Albert Lewis, Art Still and Deron Cherry.[23] John Mackovic 
took over head coaching duties for the 1983 season after Marv Levy was 
fired.[23] Over the next four seasons, Mackovic coached the Chiefs to a 
30–34 record, but took the team to its first post-season appearance in 
15 years in the 1986 NFL playoffs.[11] Following the team's loss to the 
New York Jets in the playoffs, Mackovic was fired.[23] Frank Gansz served 
as head coach for the next two seasons, but won only eight of 31 games.[23] 
On December 19, 1988, owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team's 
new president, general manager, and chief executive officer. Peterson fired 
head coach Frank Gansz two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer 
as the club's seventh head coach.[23] In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, 
the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick 
Thomas, respectively.[23][27] The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored 
in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached 
the postseason in six straight years.[28] In Schottenheimer's tenure as 
head coach, (1989–1998), the Chiefs became a perennial playoff contender, 
featuring offensive players including Steve DeBerg, Christian Okoye, Stephone 
Paige and Barry Word, a strong defense, anchored by Thomas, Smith, Albert 
Lewis and Deron Cherry, and on special teams, Nick Lowery, most accurate 
kicker in NFL History.[6] The team recorded a 101–58–1 record, and clinched 
seven playoff berths.[29] The Chiefs' 1993 season was the franchise's most 
successful in 22 years.[27] With newly acquired quarterback Joe Montana 
and running back Marcus Allen—two former Super Bowl champions and MVPs—the 
Chiefs further strengthened their position in the NFL.[27] The 11–5 Chiefs 
defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers on their way to the 
franchise's first and to date only AFC Championship Game appearance against 
the Buffalo Bills.[27] The Chiefs were overwhelmed by the Bills and lost 
the game by a score of 30–13.[27] The Chiefs' victory on January 14, 1994, 
against the Oilers remained the franchise's last post-season victory for 
21 years until their 30–0 victory over the Houston Texans on January 9, 
2016. In the 1995 NFL playoffs, the 13–3 Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis 
Colts in a cold, damp night game at Arrowhead Stadium.[11][27] Kansas City 
lost the game 10–7 against the underdog Colts, after kicker Lin Elliot 
missed three field goal attempts and quarterback Steve Bono threw three 
interceptions.[27] The Chiefs selected tight end Tony Gonzalez with the 
13th overall selection in the 1997 NFL Draft, a move which some considered 
to be a gamble being that Gonzalez was primarily a basketball player at 
California. During a 1997 season full of injuries to starting quarterback 
Elvis Grbac, backup quarterback Rich Gannon took the reins of the Chiefs' 
offense as the team headed to another 13–3 season.[11][27] Head coach Marty 
Schottenheimer chose Grbac to start the playoff game against the Denver 
Broncos despite Gannon's successes in previous weeks.[27] Grbac's production 
in the game was lacking, and the Chiefs lost to the Broncos 14–10.[27] 
Denver went on to capture their fifth AFC Championship by defeating Pittsburgh, 
and then defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. Coach Schottenheimer 
announced his resignation from the Chiefs following the 1998 season, and 
defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham took over coaching duties for 
the next two seasons, compiling a 16–16 record.[27] By the end of the Chiefs' 
decade of regular-season dominance, Gannon had signed with the Oakland 
Raiders, Neil Smith signed with the Denver Broncos, and Derrick Thomas 
was paralyzed from a car accident on January 23, 2000.[27] Thomas died 
from complications of his injury weeks later.[27] After allegedly reading 
online that he would be relieved of duties, head coach Gunther Cunningham 
was fired.[30][31] Looking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied 
on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted 
Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season.[30] 
Vermeil previously led the St. Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV.[31] 
Vermeil was hired on January 12. The Chiefs then traded a first round draft 
pick in the 2001 NFL Draft to St. Louis for quarterback Trent Green and 
signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones 
on offense.[31] In 2003, Kansas City began the season with nine consecutive 
victories, a franchise record.[31] They finished the season with a 13–3 
record and the team's offense led the NFL in several categories under the 
direction of USA Today's Offensive Coach of the Year honoree, Al Saunders.[31] 
Running back Priest Holmes surpassed Marshall Faulk's single-season touchdown 
record by scoring his 27th rushing touchdown against the Chicago Bears 
in the team's regular season finale.[31][32] The team clinched the second 
seed in the 2004 NFL playoffs and hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the 
AFC Divisional Playoffs.[31] In a game where neither team punted, the Chiefs 
lost the shoot-out 38–31.[31] It was the third time in nine seasons that 
the Chiefs went 8–0 at home in the regular season, and earned home field 
advantage throughout the playoffs, only to lose their post-season opener 
at Arrowhead. After a disappointing 7–9 record in 2004, the 2005 Chiefs 
finished with a 10–6 record but no playoff berth.[31] They were the fourth 
team since 1990 to miss the playoffs with a 10–6 record.[31] Running back 
Larry Johnson started in place of the injured Priest Holmes and rushed 
for 1,750 yards in only nine starts.[31] Prior to the Chiefs' final game 
of the season, head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement.[31] The 
Chiefs won the game 37–3 over the playoff-bound Cincinnati Bengals.[31] 
Within two weeks of Vermeil's resignation, the Chiefs returned to their 
defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach.[31] The team 
introduced Herman Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the 
New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round 
selection in the 2006 NFL Draft to the Jets.[31] Quarterback Trent Green 
suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati 
Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks.[31] Backup quarterback 
Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record.[31] 
Kansas City was awarded a Thanksgiving Day game against the Denver Broncos 
in response to owner Lamar Hunt's lobbying for a third Thanksgiving Day 
game.[31] The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 19–10 in the first Thanksgiving 
Day game in Kansas City since 1969.[31] Hunt was hospitalized at the time 
of the game and died weeks later on December 13 due to complications with 
prostate cancer.[14][31] The Chiefs honored their owner for the remainder 
of the season, as did the rest of the league.[31] Trent Green returned 
by the end of the season, but struggled in the final stretch,[31] and running 
back Larry Johnson set an NFL record with 416 carries in a season.[31] 
Kansas City managed to clinch their first playoff berth in three seasons 
with a 9–7 record and a bizarre sequence of six losses from other AFC teams 
on New Year's Eve, culminating with a Broncos loss to the 49ers.[31] The 
Indianapolis Colts hosted the Chiefs in the Wild Card playoffs and defeated 
Kansas City 23–8. In 2007, Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins[33] 
leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become 
the new starting quarterback.[31] After starting the season with a 4–3 
record, the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry 
Johnson suffered a season-ending foot injury and the quarterback position 
lacked stability with Huard and Croyle.[31] Despite the team's 4–12 record, 
tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe's NFL record for touchdowns 
at the position (63) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback 
sacks with 15.5.[11] The Chiefs began their 2008 season with the youngest 
team in the NFL.[34] The starting lineup had an average of 25.5 years of 
age.[34] By releasing several veteran players such as cornerback Ty Law 
and wide receiver Eddie Kennison and trading defensive end Jared Allen,[35] 
the Chiefs began a youth movement.[34][36] The Chiefs had a league-high 
thirteen selections in the 2008 NFL Draft and chose defensive tackle Glenn 
Dorsey and offensive lineman Branden Albert in the first round. Analysts 
quickly called Kansas City's selections as the best of the entire draft.[35][37][38][39] 
Entering the season, the Chiefs were unsure if injury-prone quarterback 
Brodie Croyle, who was the incumbent starter, could be their quarterback 
in the long-term.[39] Croyle was injured in the team's first game of the 
season and Damon Huard started in Croyle's absence.[40] Tyler Thigpen become 
the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games for a start against 
the Atlanta Falcons.[41][42] After a poor performance by Thigpen, in which 
he threw three interceptions against the Falcons defense,[42] Huard was 
retained as the starting quarterback.[43] The Chiefs struggled off the 
field as much as on as tight end Tony Gonzalez demanded a trade and running 
back Larry Johnson was involved in legal trouble.[44][45][46][47] Croyle 
returned for the Chiefs' game against the Tennessee Titans, but both he 
and Damon Huard suffered season-ending injuries in the game.[48] The Chiefs 
reorganized their offense to a new spread offense game plan focused around 
Tyler Thigpen.[36][49][50][51] The Chiefs' new offense was implemented 
to help Thigpen play to the best of his abilities and also following the 
absence of Larry Johnson, who was suspended for his off-field conduct.[45][50][51][52] 
The Chiefs made a huge gamble by using the spread offense, as most in the 
NFL believe that it cannot work in professional football, and also head 
coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented 
game plans.[51] The 2008 season ended with a franchise worst 2–14 record, 
where the team suffered historic blowout defeats nearly week-in and week-out.[11][42][53] 
a 34–0 shut-out to the Carolina Panthers,[54] and allowed a franchise-high 
54 points against the Buffalo Bills.[55] The team's general manager, chief 
executive officer, and team president Carl Peterson resigned at the end 
of the season,[56] and former New England Patriots vice president of player 
personnel Scott Pioli was hired as his replacement for 2009.[57] Upon his 
arrival, Pioli made an effort to bring in coaches and administrators from 
his successful past with the New England Patriots, where he won three Super 
Bowl titles. On January 23, 2009, Herman Edwards was fired as head coach,[58][59] 
and two weeks later Todd Haley signed a four-year contract to become Edwards' 
successor.[60][61] Haley had a background with Pioli, which made him an 
attractive hire for Pioli's first coach in Kansas City. In April 2009 Tony 
Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons after failed trade attempts 
over the previous two seasons.[62] Notably, head coach Todd Haley fired 
offensive coordinator Chan Gailey just weeks before the start of the 2009 
season and chose to take on the coordinator duties himself. Throughout 
2009 the Chiefs acquired veterans to supplement the Chiefs' young talent 
including Matt Cassel, Mike Vrabel, Bobby Engram, Mike Brown, Chris Chambers, 
and Andy Alleman.[63][64][65] The team finished with a 4–12 record, just 
a two-game improvement upon their record from the 2008 season. For the 
2010 season, the Chiefs made significant hires for their coaching staff, 
bringing on former Patriots assistant coaches Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel 
to coach the offense and defense, respectively. The coaching additions 
proved to be very successful, as the Chiefs would go on to secure their 
first AFC West title since 2003. Their ten victories in the 2010 season 
combined for as many as the team had won in their previous three seasons 
combined. On January 9, 2011, the Chiefs lost their home Wild Card playoff 
game to the Baltimore Ravens 30–7. Six players were chosen for the Pro 
Bowl: Dwayne Bowe, Jamaal Charles, Brian Waters, Tamba Hali, Matt Cassel 
and rookie safety Eric Berry. Jamaal Charles won the FEDEX ground player 
of the year award and Dwayne Bowe led the NFL in Touchdown Receptions. 
For their first pick in the 2011 NFL draft, and 26th overall, the team 
selected Jonathan Baldwin, Wide Receiver from Pitt. After a poor start, 
Haley was relieved of duties as Head Coach on December 12. Clark Hunt made 
note of "bright spots at different points this season", but felt that overall 
the Chiefs were not progressing.[66] The highest point of the 2011 season 
was an upset win against the Packers, who at that time, were undefeated 
with a 13–0 record. The Chiefs became the first team since the 1929 Buffalo 
Bisons to not lead in regulation through any of their first nine games. 
The Chiefs tied their franchise worst record of 2–14 and clinched the No. 
1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft. It is the first time in since the 
merger they have held the first overall pick.[67] Following the 2012 season, 
the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. 
Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head 
coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey, a former Green Bay 
Packers head scout. The Chiefs acquired quarterback Alex Smith from the 
San Francisco 49ers for the Chiefs' second-round pick, 34th overall, in 
the 2013 draft and a conditional pick in 2014 draft.[68] Matt Cassel was 
released shortly after. The Chiefs selected Eric Fisher with the first 
overall pick of the 2013 NFL Draft. The Chiefs started 9–0 for the second 
time in team history. They would lead their wildcard game against the Indianapolis 
Colts 38–10 shortly after halftime, but they would collapse late and lose, 
45–44. After a promising win for the Chiefs against Houston in Week 1, 
Kansas City went on a five-game losing streak culminating in a 16–10 loss 
to Minnesota and the loss of Jamaal Charles to a torn ACL. However, they 
managed one of the most improbable season comebacks in the NFL and won 
ten straight to improve their record from 1–5 to 11–5. The team clinched 
a playoff berth after a 17–13 win over Cleveland in Week 16 to become only 
the second NFL team to do so after the merger.[clarification needed] The 
streak achieved by the Chiefs broke a franchise record for 9 straight (2003, 
2013) and second 9 plus game win streak under Reid. After a Week 17 win 
over Oakland 23–17, the Chiefs achieved their longest winning streak in 
franchise history at ten games. They qualified for the playoffs, and started 
out by beating the Houston Texans in the AFC Wild Card Game, 30–0. It was 
their first playoff win since 1994, and incidentally, in the same city 
as their last playoff win. Riddled with injuries, they were defeated by 
the New England Patriots 27–20 in the AFC Divisional Round After facing 
a 24-3 deficit with 6 minutes left in the 3rd quarter, the Chiefs engineered 
a 33-27 win ending with a 2-yard touchdown run by Alex Smith in OT to give 
the Chiefs their largest regular season comeback to start the season at 
1-0. Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season 
results and exclude any postseason play. When the Texans began playing 
in 1960, the team's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with 
a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas. Originally, Hunt 
chose Columbia blue and orange for the Texans' uniforms, but Bud Adams 
chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his Houston Oilers franchise.[2] Hunt 
reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the 
team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this 
day.[2] The state of Texas on the team's helmet was replaced by an arrowhead 
design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin.[2] Hunt's inspiration 
for the interlocking "KC" design was the "SF" inside of an oval on the 
San Francisco 49ers helmets.[2] Unlike the 49ers' logo, Kansas City's overlapping 
initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded 
by a thin black outline.[2] From 1960 to 1973, the Chiefs had grey facemask 
bars on their helmets, but changed to white bars in 1974, making them one 
of the first teams in the NFL to use a non-gray facemask.[2] The Chiefs' 
uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club's 
history.[2] It consists of a red helmet, and either red or white jerseys 
with the opposite color numbers and names.[2] White pants were used with 
both jerseys from 1960 to 1967 and 1989 to 1999.[2] Beginning in 2009, 
during the Pioli/Haley era, the team has alternated between white and red 
pants for road games during the season. Prior to September 15, 2013, the 
Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs have 
never worn an alternate jersey in a game, although custom jerseys are sold 
for retail. The Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home 
for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind 
the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would be forced to 
wear their black uniforms on a day that forecasted for steamy temperatures.[69] 
The only other time the Chiefs wore white at home was throughout the 1980 
season under Marv Levy. In 2007, the Kansas City Chiefs honored Lamar Hunt 
and the AFL with a special patch.[70] It features the AFL's logo from the 
1960s with Hunt's "LH" initials inside the football.[70] In 2008, the patch 
became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City's home 
and away jerseys.[70] In select games for the 2009 season, the Chiefs, 
as well as the other founding teams of the American Football League, wore 
"throwback" uniforms to celebrate the AFL's 50th anniversary.[71] For the 
first time in team history, the Chiefs wore their red jersey with red pants 
forming an all red combo in their home opener against the Dallas Cowboys 
on September 15, 2013. Arrowhead Stadium has been the Chiefs' home field 
since 1972 and has a capacity of 76,416,[72] which makes it the sixth-largest 
stadium in the NFL. The stadium underwent a $375 million renovation, completed 
in mid-2010, which included new luxury boxes, wider concourses and enhanced 
amenities.[5][57] The stadium renovation was paid for by $250 million in 
taxpayer money and $125 million from the Hunt Family.[61] The stadium cost 
$53 million to build in 1972, and an average ticket in 2009 costs $81.[5] 
Centerplate serves as the stadium's concession provider and Sprint Nextel, 
Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola are major corporate sponsors.[5] Dating back 
to the Chiefs' home opener in 1991 to mid-2009, the Chiefs had 155 consecutive 
sellout games.[5] The streak ended with the final home game of the 2009 
season against the Cleveland Browns, resulting in the first local TV blackout 
in over 19 years. [73] Arrowhead has been called one of the world's finest 
stadiums[6] and has long held a reputation for being one of the toughest 
and loudest outdoor stadiums for opposing players to play in.[57][74][75][76] 
All noise is directly attributed to its fans[77] and was once measured 
at 116 decibels by the Acoustical Design Group of Mission, Kansas.[78] 
By way of comparison, take-off of aircraft may lead to a sound level of 
106 decibels at the ground.[78] Sports Illustrated named Arrowhead Stadium 
the "toughest place to play" for opposing teams in 2005.[79] The tailgate 
party environment outside the stadium on gameday has been compared to a 
"college football" atmosphere.[80] Arrowhead Stadium features frequent 
fly-overs from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber from nearby Whiteman Air Force 
Base. Since the 1994 NFL season, the stadium has had a natural grass playing 
surface.[81] From 1972 to 1993, the stadium had an artificial AstroTurf 
surface.[81] During the game against the Oakland Raiders on October 13, 
2013, Arrowhead Stadium once again became the loudest stadium in the world 
when the fans set the Guinness Book of World Records record for loudest 
crowd in an outdoor stadium (137.5 dB), breaking the record set by the 
Seattle Seahawks just four weeks prior. A few weeks after, Seattle re-gained 
the record by reaching a noise level of 137.6 decibels.[82][83] Chiefs 
fans have reclaimed the record once again; on September 29, 2014, on Monday 
Night Football against the New England Patriots, the fans recorded a sound 
reading of 142.2 decibels.[84] As of the end of the 2014 season, the Chiefs 
are unbeaten at Arrowhead against the Arizona Cardinals (4–0) and Washington 
Redskins (3–0), but winless there against the Baltimore Ravens (0–3). When 
the franchise was based in Dallas, the team conducted their inaugural training 
camp at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico.[10] They 
moved camp to Southern Methodist University, owner Lamar Hunt's alma mater, 
for 1961 and continued to practice there until 1965.[10] From 1966 to 1971, 
the Chiefs practiced in Swope Park in Kansas City,[85] and from 1972 to 
1991 held camp at William Jewell College in Clay County, Missouri–where 
Lamar Hunt had extensive business dealings including Worlds of Fun, Oceans 
of Fun and SubTropolis.[27] From 1992 to 2009 the Chiefs conducted summer 
training camp at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls in River Falls, 
Wisconsin.[86] The Chiefs' 2007 training camp was documented in the HBO/NFL 
Films documentary reality television series, Hard Knocks.[87] Following 
the passage of a $25 million state tax credit proposal, the Chiefs moved 
their training camp to Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, 
Missouri, in 2010.[88] The bulk of the tax credits went for improvements 
to Arrowhead Stadium with $10 million applied to the move to Missouri Western.[89] 
A climate-controlled, 120-yard NFL regulation grass indoor field, and office 
space for the Chiefs was constructed at Missouri Western adjacent to the 
school's Spratt Stadium before the 2010 season.[90] Outside of training 
camp and during the regular season, the Chiefs conduct practices at their 
own training facility nearby Arrowhead Stadium. The facility is located 
near the Raytown Road entrance to the Truman Sports Complex just east of 
Interstate 435 and features three outdoor fields (two grass and one artificial 
turf) as well as an indoor facility with its own full-size field. The Chiefs' 
first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several different breeds 
of pinto horse. Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988.[9][91][92] 
The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by 
rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress.[9][91] Warpaint 
circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed 
victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown.[9][91] On September 20, 2009, 
a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs' home opener against the 
Oakland Raiders.[93] Warpaint is now ridden by a cheerleader, Susie.[94] 
In the mid-1980s, the Chiefs featured a short-lived unnamed "Indian man" 
mascot which was later scrapped in 1988.[91] Since 1989 the cartoon-like 
K. C. Wolf, portrayed by Dan Meers in a wolf costume, has served as the 
team's mascot.[9][95] The mascot was named after the Chiefs' "Wolfpack", 
a group of rabid fans from the team's days at Municipal Stadium.[91] K. 
C. Wolf is one of the most popular NFL mascots and was the league's first 
mascot inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.[96] The Chiefs have 
employed a cheerleading squad since the team's inception in 1960.[97] In 
the team's early days, the all-female squad was referred to as the Chiefettes.[98] 
In addition to the Cheerleaders, in the early 1970s, there was also a dance/drill 
team that performed for pre-game and halftime. From 1986 to 1992, the cheerleader 
squad featured a mix of men and women.[97] Since 1993, the all-female squad 
has been known as the Chiefs Cheerleaders.[91][97][98] Running backs Wide

coaches and contributors with a team Hall of Fame or Ring of Honor.[99] 
Established in 1970, the Chiefs Hall of Fame has inducted a new member 
in an annual ceremony with the exception of the 1983 season.[99][100] Several 
of the names were featured at Arrowhead Stadium in the stadium's architecture 
prior to renovations in 2009. The requirements for induction are that a 
player, coach, or contributor must have been with the Chiefs for four seasons 
and been out of the NFL for four seasons at the time of induction.[99] 
There are some exceptions, such as Joe Delaney and Derrick Thomas, Delaney 
was with the team for only two seasons before his death, Thomas was inducted 
1 year after his death in January 2000 (2 years after his final season). 
The Chiefs have the second-most enshrinees of any NFL team in their team 
hall of fame behind the Green Bay Packers, who have enshrined over 100 
players and team contributors over the years in the Green Bay Packers Hall 
of Fame.[99] Thirteen head coaches have served the Texans/Chiefs franchise 
since their first season in 1960. Hank Stram, the team's first head coach, 
led the Chiefs to three AFL championship victories and two appearances 
in the Super Bowl. Stram was the team's longest-tenured head coach, holding 
the position from 1960 to 1974.[20] Marty Schottenheimer was hired in 1989 
and led Kansas City to seven playoff appearances in his 10 seasons as head 
coach.[23][27] Schottenheimer had the best winning percentage (.634) of 
all Chiefs coaches.[29] Gunther Cunningham was on the Chiefs' coaching 
staff in various positions from 1995 to 2008, serving as the team's head 
coach in between stints as the team's defensive coordinator.[30][31] Dick 
Vermeil coached the team to a franchise-best 9–0 start in the 2003 season.[101] 
Of the ten Chiefs coaches, Hank Stram and Marv Levy have been elected into 
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[102] Herman Edwards served as the team's 
head coach from 2006 to 2008, compiling a 15–33 record and a franchise 
worst 6–26 record over a two-year span.[58][59][103][104] Todd Haley compiled 
a 19–26 record with the team from 2009–2011, including an AFC West division 
title in 2010.[60] Haley was fired with three games left in the 2011 season. 
Romeo Crennel was named interim coach, and was promoted to full-time coach 
in January 2012. Crennel was fired on Monday, December 31, 2012, after 
finishing the 2012 season with a 2–14 record. On January 5, 2013, the Chiefs 
hired Andy Reid to be their next head coach. In Reid's first season with 
the Chiefs, they started the season with a 9–0 record while having the 
No. 1 defense in the league. The franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar 
Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate 
them to Texas.[105] Hunt purchased the franchise for US$25,000 in 1960 
and[5] remained the team's owner until his death in 2006.[105] The Hunt 
family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, 
Lamar's son, represents the family's interests.[5][61][106][107] While 
Hunt's official title is Chairman of the Board, he serves as the franchise's 
de facto owner.[106][107] In 2010, Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his 
role as Chairman of the Board.[108] According to Forbes, the team is valued 
at just under $1 billion and ranks 20th among NFL teams in 2010.[5] Owner 
Lamar Hunt served as the team's president from 1960 to 1976. Because of 
Lamar Hunt's contributions to the NFL, the AFC Championship trophy is named 
after him.[109] He promoted general manager Jack Steadman to become the 
team's president in 1977.[109] Steadman held the job until Carl Peterson 
was hired by Hunt in 1988 to replace him.[109] Peterson resigned the title 
as team president in 2008.[110] Denny Thum became the team's interim president 
following Peterson's departure and was officially given the full position 
in May 2009.[110][111] Thum resigned from his position on September 14, 
2010.[108] Don Rossi served as the team's general manager for half of the 
1960 season, resigning in November 1960.[10] Jack Steadman assumed duties 
from Rossi and served in the position until 1976.[10][20][109] Steadman 
was promoted to team president in 1976 and despite being relieved of those 
duties in 1988,[109] he remained with the franchise until 2006 in various 
positions.[20][23] Jim Schaaf took over for Steadman as general manager 
until being fired in December 1988.[23] Carl Peterson was hired in 1988 
to serve as the team's general manager, chief executive officer and team 
president.[23][109] Peterson remained in the position for 19 years until 
he announced his resignation from the team in 2008.[110][112] Denny Thum 
served as interim general manager[110] until January 13, 2009, when the 
Chiefs named New England Patriots executive Scott Pioli the team's new 
general manager.[57][113] Pioli was released in early January after the 
hiring of Andy Reid, and was replaced by John Dorsey. Pioli's record as 
the Chief's general manager was 23–41. → Coaching Staff → Management → 
More NFL staffs Since 1989, KCFX, a.k.a. "101 The Fox", has broadcast all 
Chiefs games on FM radio under the moniker of The Chiefs Fox Football Radio 
Network. Since 1994, Mitch Holthus has served as play-by-play announcer 
and former Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson serves as color commentator.[114] 
Former Chiefs longsnapper Kendall Gammon serves as the field reporter.[114] 
Former Chiefs broadcaster Bob Gretz also contributes to the broadcasts.[114][115] 
KCFX holds broadcast rights to Chiefs games through the 2009 season.[114][115] 
Starting in the 2016 season, Dawson will only serve as color commentator 
during home games, and Gammon will be color commentator during road games, 
with Dani Welniak assuming Gammon's sideline reporting role for away games.[116] 
The Chiefs and KCFX hold the distinction of being the longest FM radio 
broadcast partnering tenure in the NFL.[114][115] The Chiefs Radio Network 
extends throughout the six-state region of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, and Arkansas, with 61 affiliate stations.[114][115] KCTV Channel 
5 (CBS) broadcasts most Chiefs regular season games, with exceptions as 
following. KCTV also broadcasts all Chiefs pre-season games. WDAF Channel 
4 (Fox) broadcasts games in which the Chiefs host an NFC opponent. KSHB 
Channel 41 (NBC) broadcasts all games in which the Chiefs play on NBC Sunday 
Night Football or NBC's NFL playoffs coverage. KMBC Channel 9 (ABC) has 
aired Monday Night Football games locally since 1970. Prior to the 1994 
season, WDAF was the primary station for the Chiefs as an NBC affiliate 
(they aired on KMBC when ABC had the AFL package through 1964), since NBC 
had the AFC package. The inter-conference home games aired on KCTV starting 
in 1973 (when the NFL allowed local telecasts of home games). After week 
one of the 1994 season, WDAF switched to Fox (which got the NFC package), 
and has aired the Chiefs' inter-conference home games since. The bulk of 
the team's games moved to KSHB through the end of the 1997 season. Since 
that time, they have aired on KCTV, save for the 2015 Week 17 game vs. 
the Oakland Raiders, which aired on WDAF when the NFL cross-flexed the 
game from CBS to FOX. As of the 2015 preseason, the Chiefs preseason broadcasters 
were Paul Burmeister who serves as the play-by-play announcer, former Chiefs 
quarterback Trent Green serves as the color commentator, and KCChiefs.com 
insider B.J. Kissel is the sideline reporter. Chiefs games are broadcast 
in Missouri and Kansas as well as parts of Iowa, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas, 
and South Dakota.[117] Stations in major cities are listed below. The Chiefs 
boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL.[73][118] Kansas City 
is the sixth-smallest media market with an NFL team, but they have had 
the second-highest attendance average over the last decade.[77] Studies 
by Bizjournals in 2006 gave the Chiefs high marks for consistently drawing 
capacity crowds in both good seasons and bad.[119] The Chiefs averaged 
77,300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006, second in the NFL behind the Washington 
Redskins.[119] The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Kingdom 
which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment.[120][121] 
At the end of "The Star-Spangled Banner" before home games, many Chiefs 
fans intentionally yell out "CHIEFS!" rather than singing "brave" as the 
final word.[122] In 1996, general manager Carl Peterson said "We all look 
forward, not only at Arrowhead, but on the road, too, to when we get to 
that stanza of the National Anthem... Our players love it."[122] After 
the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in 
honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do 
so for the remainder of the 2001 season.[123] At the Chiefs' September 
23, 2001, home game against the New York Giants, fans gave the opposing 
Giants a standing ovation.[76] After every Chiefs touchdown at home games, 
fans chant while pointing in the direction of the visiting team and fans, 
"We're gonna beat the hell outta you...you...you, you, you, you!" over 
the song "Rock and Roll Part 2."[124] The chant starts after the third 
"hey!" in the song.[124] The original version of the song by Gary Glitter 
was previously used until the NFL banned his music from its facilities 
in 2006 following the British rocker's conviction on sexual abuse charges 
in Vietnam.[124] A cover version of the song played by Tube Tops 2000 has 
been played since 2006 at every home game.[124] Chiefs fans also occasionally 
carry on a tradition that began at Florida State University in the mid 
1980s by using the Seminole WarChant as a rallying cry during key moments 
in their football games.[125][126] The Chiefs' fan base has expanded across 
the world like many other NFL teams. However, there is a Twitter account 
dedicated to Chiefs fans in the UK and has been recognized by the Kansas 
City Chiefs and is their official UK fan page. They have many dedicated 
fans writing articles and interviewing players of the team such as Tamba 
Hali.[127] Arrowhead Stadium is also recognized by Guinness World Records 
as having the loudest outdoor stadium in the world. This was achieved on 
September 29, 2014 in a Monday Night Football game against the New England 
Patriots when the crowd achieved a roar of 142.2 decibels[128] which is 
comparable to standing 100 feet from a jet engine, which even with short 
term exposure, can cause permanent damage.[129] From various periods between 
1963 and the 2008 season, trumpeter Tony DiPardo and The T.D. Pack Band 
played live music at every Chiefs home game.[130][131] The band was known 
as The Zing Band when the team was located at Municipal Stadium. DiPardo 
was honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for 
the team's victory in Super Bowl IV.[130] When his health was declining, 
DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988.[131] DiPardo's 
daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned 
to the band by popular demand.[131][132] For the 2009 season, due to renovations 
at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium. 
DiPardo died on January 27, 2011, at age 98. He had been hospitalized since
