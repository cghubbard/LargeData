Enfield is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The population 
was 44,654 at the 2010 census.[1] It is bordered by Longmeadow, Massachusetts 
and East Longmeadow, Massachusetts to the north, Somers to the east, East 
Windsor and Ellington to the south, and the Connecticut River (towns of 
Suffield and Windsor Locks) to the west. Enfield was originally inhabited 
by the Pocomtuc tribe, and contained their two villages of Scitico and 
Nameroke. Enfield was settled in 1679 by settlers from Salem, Massachusetts. 
Enfield was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1683 as the Freshwater Plantation. 
The namesake is the Freshwater Brook that triverses the town. Shortly around 
1700, the town changed its name to Enfield after Enfield Town in Middlesex. 
In 1734, the western part of town separated into the town of Somers. In 
1749, following the settlement of a lawsuit in which it was determined 
that a surveyor's error placed a section of present-day Hartford County 
(including Enfield) within the boundaries of Massachusetts, the town seceded 
and became part of Connecticut.[2] Jonathan Edwards preached his famous 
sermon, "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God", in Enfield. It was part 
of the Great Awakening revival that struck New England in the mid-18th 
century and spread throughout Western North American civilization. The 
modern town of Enfield was formed through the merging of Enfield, Thompsonville, 
and Hazardville, named for Colonel Augustus George Hazard (1802–1868), 
whose company manufactured gunpowder in the Powder Hollow area of the town 
from the 1830s to the 1910s. In the 1989 film Glory, boxes of gunpowder 
can be seen with the words Enfield, CT printed on the sides. In an episode 
in the 1970s police drama Hawaii Five-O, Jack Lord's character Steve McGarrett 
traces explosives back to "The Hazard Gunpowder Company- Enfield, CT". 
The capacity of the mill at the time of the Civil War was 1,200 pounds 
(540 kg) per day.[3] Over 60 people died in explosions in Powder Hollow 
during the years when gunpowder was manufactured there. The mill blew up 
several times, but was set up so that if one building blew up, the rest 
would not follow in a chain reaction. The ruins of these buildings and 
the dams are open to the public. Powder Hollow is now home to baseball 
fields and hiking trails. King's Island in the Connecticut River, previously 
known as Terry Island (or Terry's Island, or Great Island),[4] was the 
location of pivotal meetings of Adventist Christians in 1872 and 1873.[5][5] 
There are five sections of the town of Enfield. Enfield Village, Thompsonville, 
Hazardville, Scitico, and Sherwood Village. In 1793, a historic Shaker 
village, Enfield Shaker village, one of nineteen scattered from Maine to 
Kentucky, was established in the town. The Utopian religious sect practiced 
celibate, communal living, and is today renowned for its simple architecture 
and furniture. Membership eventually dwindled, however, and the village 
disbanded. The property has since been redeveloped by the Enfield Correctional 
Institution, still located on Shaker Road. According to the United States
