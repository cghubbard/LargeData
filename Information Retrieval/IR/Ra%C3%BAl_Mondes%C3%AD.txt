Award. In 1999, he again joined the 30–30 club with 33 homers and 36 steals, 
though his average had dipped to .253. On November 8, 1999, he was traded 
by the Dodgers (along with Pedro Borbón, Jr.) to the Toronto Blue Jays 
for Shawn Green and minor league player Jorge Nunez. He only played in 
96 games during his first season in Toronto after he tore ligaments in 
his right elbow during a game on July 21, which required season-ending 
surgery. He played two and a half seasons with the Blue Jays, playing in 
320 games and hitting 66 home runs. He won the American League Player of

the Dominican Republic. He left the team on May 11, 2004 and his contract 
was terminated a week later The Anaheim Angels signed him on May 30, 2004.

on the disabled list. He was released by the Angels in July for not showing 
up for his rehab therapy. The Atlanta Braves signed Mondesí in 2005; he
