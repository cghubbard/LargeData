The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football 
league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football 
Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is 
one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and 
the highest professional level of American football in the world.[3] The 
NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the 
week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye 
week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each 
conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the 
playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, 
played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. The NFL was formed in 
1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming 
itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. The NFL agreed 
to merge with the American Football League (AFL) in 1966, and the first 
Super Bowl was held at the end of that season; the merger was completed 
in 1970. Today, the NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of 
any professional sports league in the world[4] and is the most popular 
sports league in the United States.[5] The Super Bowl is among the biggest 
club sporting events in the world[6] and individual Super Bowl games account 
for many of the most watched television programs in American history, all 
occupying the Nielsen's Top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television 
broadcasts by 2015.[7] The NFL's executive officer is the commissioner, 
who has broad authority in governing the league. The team with the most 
NFL championships is the Green Bay Packers with thirteen (nine NFL titles 
before the Super Bowl era, and four Super Bowl championships afterwards); 
the team with the most Super Bowl championships is the Pittsburgh Steelers 
with six. The current NFL champions are the Denver Broncos, who defeated 
the Carolina Panthers 24–10 in Super Bowl 50. On August 20, 1920, a meeting 
was held by representatives of the Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland 
Indians, Rock Island Independents and Dayton Triangles at the Jordan and 
Hupmobile auto showroom in Canton, Ohio.[8] This meeting resulted in the 
formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group 
who, according to the Canton Evening Repository, intended to "raise the 
standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding 
for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation 
of schedules".[9] Another meeting held on September 17, 1920 resulted in 
the renaming of the league to the American Professional Football Association 
(APFA).[9] The league hired Jim Thorpe as its first president, and consisted 
of 14 teams. Only two of these teams, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago 
Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain.[10] 
Although the league did not maintain official standings for its 1920 inaugural 
season and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the 
APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their 8–0–3 (8 
wins, 0 losses, and 3 ties) record.[11] The first event occurred on September 
26, 1920 when the Rock Island Independents defeated the non-league St. 
Paul Ideals 48-0 at Douglas Park.[8][12] On October 3, 1920, the first 
full week of league play occurred.[13][14] The following season resulted 
in the Chicago Staleys controversially winning the title over the Buffalo 
All-Americans.[15] In 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football 
League (NFL).[16] In 1932, the season ended with the Chicago Bears (6-1-6) 
and the Portsmouth Spartans (6-1-4) tied for first in the league standings.[17] 
At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the 
highest winning percentage (not including ties, which were not counted 
towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; 
the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie, if two teams played 
twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the 
source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's 
creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams 
were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a playoff game 
between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. 
The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially 
a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings, 
at Wrigley Field in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme 
cold forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium, which did 
not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to 
accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9-0 and thus 
won the championship. Fan interest in the de facto championship game led 
the NFL, beginning in 1933, to split into two divisions with a championship 
game to be played between the division champions.[18] The 1934 season also 
marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were absent from 
the league. The de facto ban was rescinded in 1946, following public pressure 
and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban in Major League Baseball.[19] 
The NFL was always the foremost professional football league in the United 
States; it nevertheless faced a large number of rival professional leagues 
through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate 
American Football Leagues and the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), 
on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams 
trace their histories to these rival leagues, including the Los Angeles 
Rams (who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League), 
the Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers (the last two of which came 
from the AAFC). By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional 
football in the United States; its only competition in North America was 
the professional Canadian football circuit, which formally became the Canadian 
Football League (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being a different 
football code than the American game, the CFL established a niche market 
in Canada and still survives as an independent league. A new professional 
league, the fourth American Football League (AFL), began play in 1960. 
The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining 
lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL 
for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a merger on 
June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues 
would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the Super Bowl, 
was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning Super Bowl 
I and Super Bowl II, and the AFL winning Super Bowl III and Super Bowl 
IV.[20] After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: 
the National Football Conference (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger 
NFL teams, and the American Football Conference (AFC), consisting of all 
of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams.[21] Today, the 
NFL is considered the most popular sports league in North America; much 
of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who led 
the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from 
three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the 
end of his tenure, and 400 million viewers watched 1989's Super Bowl XXIII. 
The NFL established NFL Properties in 1963. The league's licensing wing, 
NFL Properties earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's 
tenure also marked the creation of NFL Charities and a national partnership 
with United Way.[22] Paul Tagliabue was elected as commissioner to succeed 
Rozelle; his seventeen-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by 
large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion 
teams,[23] as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase 
the number of minorities in league and team management roles.[24] The league's 
current Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has focused on reducing the number 
of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending 
players who break rules.[25] These actions are among many the NFL is taking 
to reduce concussions and improve player safety.[26] From 1920 to 1934, 
the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting 
a minimum. The league mandated a 12-game regular season for each team beginning 
in 1935, later shortening this to 11 games in 1937 and 10 games in 1943, 
mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned 
to 11 games in 1946 and to 12 in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule 
in 1961, which it retained until switching to the current 16-game schedule 
in 1978.[27] Proposals to increase the regular season to 18 games have 
been made, but have been rejected in labor negotiations with the National 
Football League Players Association (NFLPA).[28] The NFL operated in a 
two-conference system from 1933 to 1966, where the champions of each conference 
would meet in the NFL Championship Game. If two teams tied for the conference 
lead, they would meet in a one-game playoff to determine the conference 
champion. In 1967, the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead 
of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion New Orleans 
Saints to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences 
and split each into two four-team divisions. The four conference champions 
would meet in the NFL playoffs, a two-round playoff.[29] The NFL also operated 
the Playoff Bowl (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from 1960 to 1969. 
Effectively a third-place game, pitting the two conference runners-up against 
each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been exhibitions 
rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 
1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.[30] Following the addition 
of the former AFL teams into the NFL in 1970, the NFL split into two conferences 
with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,[21] 
would also feature an expanded eight-team eight playoff, the participants 
being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 
'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage) from each conference. 
In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, 
bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild 
card teams were added in 1990 to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL 
expanded to 32 teams in 2002, the league realigned, changing the division 
structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in 
each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number 
of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.[31] 
At the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a 
trade association made up of and financed by its 32 member teams.[32] Up 
until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit 501(c)(6) association.[33] 
Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption from 
federal income taxation for "Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate 
boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not 
administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit 
and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private 
shareholder or individual.".[34] In contrast, each individual team (except 
the non-profit Green Bay Packers[35]) is subject to tax because they make 
a profit.[36] The NFL gave up the tax exempt status in 2015 following public 
criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner Roger Goodell labeled 
it a "distraction", saying "the effects of the tax exempt status of the 
league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years... 
Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing 
agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 
32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the 
league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, 
and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our 
business". As a result, the league office might owe around US$10 million 
in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries 
of its executive officers.[37] The league has three defined officers: the 
commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one officer, 
the president. The commissioner is elected by affirmative vote of two-thirds 
or 18 (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president 
of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or 
ten of the conference members.[38] The commissioner appoints the secretary 
and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, 
coaches, and employees. He is the "principal executive officer"[39] of 
the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating 
television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of 
an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have 
violated league bylaws or committed "conduct detrimental to the welfare 
of the League or professional football".[39] The commissioner can, in the 
event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, 
hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, 
and award or strip teams of draft picks.[39] In extreme cases, the commissioner 
can offer recommendations to the NFL's Executive Committee up to and including 
the "cancellation or forfeiture"[39] of a club's franchise or any other 
action he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up 
to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected 
to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies 
or plans to bet on or fix games.[39] The current Commissioner of the National 
Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after Paul Tagliabue, 
the previous commissioner, retired.[40] The NFL consists of 32 clubs divided 
into two conferences of 16 teams in each. Each conference is divided into 
four divisions of four clubs in each. During the regular season, each team 
is allowed a maximum of 53 players on its roster;[41] only 46 of these 
may be active (eligible to play) on game days.[42] Each team can also have 
a 10-player practice squad separate from its main roster, but the practice 
squad may only be composed of players who were not active for at least 
nine games in any of their seasons in the league. A player can only be 
on a practice squad for a maximum of three seasons.[43] Each NFL club is 
granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate 
in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles 
surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another 
league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing 
Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, 
as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration 
of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional 
football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, 
promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are several 
exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity 
to each other: the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders only have exclusive 
rights in their cities and share rights outside of it; and teams that operate 
in the same city (e.g. New York Giants and New York Jets) or the same state 
(e.g. California, Florida, and Texas) share the rights to the city's Home 
Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively.[44] Every 
NFL team is based in the contiguous United States. Although no team is 
based in a foreign country, the Jacksonville Jaguars will play one home 
game a year from 2013 to 2016 at Wembley Stadium in London, England, as 
part of the NFL International Series.[45] The Buffalo Bills played one 
home game every season at Rogers Centre in Toronto, Canada as part of the 
Bills Toronto Series from 2008 to 2013. Mexico also hosted an NFL regular-season 
game, a 2005 game between the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals 
known as "Fútbol Americano",[46] and 39 international preseason games were 
played from 1986 to 2005 as part of the American Bowl series.[47] The Raiders 
and Houston Texans will play a game in Mexico City at Estadio Azteca on 
November 21, 2016.[48] According to Forbes, the Dallas Cowboys, at approximately 
US $4 billion, are the most valuable NFL franchise and the most valuable 
sports team in the world.[49] Also, all 32 NFL teams rank among the Top 
50 most valuable sports teams in the world;[50] and 14 of the NFL's owners 
are listed on the Forbes 400, the most of any sports league or organization.[51] 
The NFL season format consists of a four-week preseason, a seventeen-week 
regular season (each team plays 16 games), and a twelve-team single-elimination 
playoff culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game. 
The NFL preseason begins with the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, played 
at Fawcett Stadium in Canton.[62] Each NFL team is required to schedule 
four preseason games, two of which must be at its home stadium, but the 
teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any teams playing in 
an American Bowl game, play five preseason games.[63] Preseason games are 
exhibition matches and do not count towards regular-season totals.[64] 
Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams generally 
do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate 
their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current 
team and to other teams if they get cut.[28] The quality of preseason games 
has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price 
for exhibition games,[65] as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike 
the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason 
is a necessary part of the NFL season.[28][65] Currently, the thirteen 
opponents each team faces over the 16-game regular season schedule are 
set using a pre-determined formula:[66] The National Football League runs 
a seventeen-week, 256-game regular season. Since 2001, the season has begun 
the week after Labor Day and concluded the week after Christmas.[67] The 
opening game of the season is normally a primetime home game for the league's 
defending champion.[68] Most NFL games are played on Sundays, with a Monday 
night game typically held at least once a week and Thursday night games 
occurring on most weeks as well.[68] NFL games are not normally played 
on Fridays or Saturdays until late in the regular season, as federal law 
prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or 
high school football. Because high school and college teams typically play 
games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on 
those days until the third Friday in December.[69] NFL games are rarely 
scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used 
twice since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday 
due to a blizzard, and in 2012, when the Kickoff game was moved from Thursday 
to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the Democratic National Convention.[70][71] 
NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. 
Within a division, all four teams play fourteen out of their sixteen games 
against common opponents – two games (home and away) are played against 
the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all 
the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined 
by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and 
four years in the conference they are not in). The other two games are 
intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year 
– for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two 
other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last 
would play two other last-place teams in the conference.[72] In total, 
each team plays sixteen games and has one bye week, where they do not play 
any games.[73] Although the teams any given club will play are known by 
the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates, times, 
and home/away status for NFL games are not determined until much later 
because the league has to account for, among other things, the Major League 
Baseball postseason and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict 
with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules 
were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered "playable schedules" 
and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what 
they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential 
schedules were developed to try and ensure that the chosen schedule would 
be the best possible one.[74] Following the conclusion of the regular season, 
a twelve-team single elimination tournament, the NFL Playoffs, is held. 
Six teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the 
four divisions as well as two wild card teams (the two remaining teams 
with the best overall record). These teams are seeded according to overall 
record, with the division champions always ranking higher than either of 
the wild card teams.[75] The top two teams (seeded one and two) from each 
conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining four teams (seeded 
3-6) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the 
Wild Card round, with the third seed competing against the sixth seed and 
the fourth seed competing against the fifth seed. The winners of the Wild 
Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded 
team against the first seed and the higher seeded team against the second 
seed. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, 
with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC 
and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league 
champion. The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the Pro 
Bowl, the league's all-star game. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held 
the week before the Super Bowl; in previous years, the game was held the 
week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game 
was moved to the week before.[76] Because of this, players from the teams 
participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game. 
The Pro Bowl is not considered as competitive as a regular-season game 
because the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the players.[77] 
The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor 
its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the Brunswick-Balke 
Collender Cup, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the Brunswick-Balke 
Collender Corporation. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known 
by its description as a "silver loving cup", was intended to be a traveling 
trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three 
titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 
1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts 
are unknown.[78] A second trophy, the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, was issued 
by the NFL from 1934 to 1969. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee 
in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death 
in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the 
main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, 
the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would 
maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp 
Memorial Trophy, like that of its predecessor, is unknown. The predominant 
theory is that the Minnesota Vikings, the last team to be awarded the trophy, 
somehow misplaced it after the 1969 season.[79] The current trophy of the 
NFL is the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Super Bowl trophy was officially 
renamed in 1970 after Vince Lombardi, who as head coach led the Green Bay 
Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. Unlike the previous 
trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, 
who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by Tiffany 
& Co. out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from US$25,000 to US$300,000.[80] 
Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel 
are awarded Super Bowl rings to commemorate their victory. The winning 
team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, 
with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree 
of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be 
on at least one side of the ring.[81] The losing team are also awarded 
rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, 
but those are almost never worn.[82] The conference champions receive trophies 
for their achievement. The champions of the NFC receive the George Halas 
Trophy,[83] named after Chicago Bears founder George Halas, who is also 
considered as one of the co-founders of the NFL. The AFC champions receive 
the Lamar Hunt Trophy,[84] named after Lamar Hunt, the founder of the Kansas 
City Chiefs and the principal founder of the American Football League. 
Players on the winning team also receive a conference championship ring.[85][86] 
The NFL recognizes a number of awards for its players and coaches at its 
annual NFL Honors presentation. The most prestigious award is the AP Most 
Valuable Player (MVP) award.[87] Other major awards include the AP Offensive 
Player of the Year, AP Defensive Player of the Year, AP Comeback Player 
of the Year, and the AP Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year awards.[88] 
Another prestigious award is the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, which 
recognizes a player's off-field work in addition to his on-field performance.[89] 
The NFL Coach of the Year award is the highest coaching award.[90] The 
NFL also gives out weekly awards such as the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players 
of the Week[91] and the Pepsi MAX NFL Rookie of the Week awards.[92] In 
the United States, the National Football League has television contracts 
with four networks: CBS, ESPN, Fox, and NBC. Collectively, these contracts 
cover every regular season and postseason game. In general, CBS televises 
afternoon games in which the away team is an AFC team, and Fox carries 
afternoon games in which the away team belongs to the NFC. These afternoon 
games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played 
at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according 
to a complicated set of rules.[93] Since 2011, the league has reserved 
the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally 
air on one network to the other network (known as "flexible scheduling").[94] 
The only way to legally watch a regionally televised game not being carried 
on the local network affiliates is to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket, the league's 
out-of-market sports package, which is only available to subscribers to 
the DirecTV satellite service. The league also provides RedZone, an omnibus 
telecast that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they 
happen. In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages 
of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide. CBS also 
carries a package of five games on Thursday nights. NBC broadcasts the 
primetime Sunday Night Football package and seven Thursday night games, 
which includes the NFL Kickoff game that starts the regular season and 
a primetime Thanksgiving Day game. ESPN carries all Monday Night Football 
games.[93] The NFL's own network, NFL Network, carries all Thursday Night 
Football games, including those on CBS and NBC (except the Thanksgiving 
and kickoff games, which remain exclusive to NBC).[95] The Super Bowl television 
rights are rotated on a three-year basis between CBS, Fox, and NBC.[93] 
In 2011, all four stations signed new nine-year contracts with the NFL, 
each running until 2022; CBS, Fox, and NBC are estimated by Forbes to pay 
a combined total of US$3 billion a year, while ESPN will pay US$1.9 billion 
a year.[96] The league also has deals with Spanish-language broadcasters 
NBC Universo, Fox Deportes and ESPN Deportes, which air Spanish language 
dubs of their respective English-language sister networks' games.[97][98] 
The league's contracts do not cover preseason games, which individual teams 
are free to sell to local stations directly; a minority of preseason games 
are distributed among the league's national television partners. Through 
the 2014 season, the NFL had a blackout policy in which games were 'blacked 
out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was 
not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but 
they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams 
could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The 
vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were 
blacked out during the 2011 season,[99] and only two games were blacked 
out in 2013 and none in 2014.[100] The NFL announced in March 2015 that 
it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the 2015 season.[100] 
According to Nielsen, the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by 
at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television 
households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the 
United States. NFL regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 
32 most-watched programs in the fall season and an NFL game ranked as the 
most-watched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season. At 
the local level, NFL games were the highest-ranked shows in NFL markets 
92% of the time.[101] Super Bowls account for the 22 most-watched programs 
(based on total audience) in US history, including a record 167 million 
people that watched Super Bowl XLVIII, the conclusion to the 2013 season.[102] 
In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are 
broadcast nationally by Westwood One (known as Dial Global for the 2012 
season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL 
markets access to each primetime game. The NFL's deal with Westwood One 
was extended in 2012 and will run through 2017.[103] Some broadcasting 
innovations have either been introduced or popularized during NFL telecasts. 
Among them, the Skycam camera system was used for the first time in a live 
telecast, at a 1984 preseason NFL game in San Diego between the Chargers 
and 49ers, and televised by CBS.[104] Commentator John Madden famously 
used a telestrator during games between the early 1980s to the mid-2000s, 
boosting the device's popularity.[105] The NFL, as a one-time experiment, 
distributed the October 25, 2015 International Series game from Wembley 
Stadium in London between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars. The 
game was live streamed on the Internet exclusively via Yahoo!, except for 
over-the-air broadcasts on the local CBS-TV affiliates in the Buffalo and 
Jacksonville markets.[106][107][108] In 2015, the NFL began sponsoring 
a series of public service announcements to bring attention to domestic 
abuse and sexual assault in response to what was seen as poor handling 
of incidents of violence by players.[109] Each April (excluding 2014 when 
it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players. The draft 
consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in 
each round.[110] The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by 
regular-season record; among playoff teams, teams are first ranked by the 
furthest round of the playoffs they reached, and then are ranked by regular-season 
record. For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be 
given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, 
but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional 
round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the runner-up always 
drafts next-to-last.[111] All potential draftees must be at least three 
years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft.[112] 
Underclassmen that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft 
must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining 
college eligibility.[113] Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks, 
but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts.[114] 
Aside from the 32 picks each club gets, compensatory draft picks are given 
to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained. 
These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7, and a total of 32 are given.[115] 
Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time, 
the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in. If they fail 
to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players 
in order, but they do not lose the pick outright. This happened in the 
2003 draft, when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on 
time. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Panthers were able to make 
their picks before the Vikings were able to use theirs.[116] Selected players 
are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them, 
but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next year's 
draft.[117] Under the current collective bargaining contract, all contracts 
to drafted players must be four-year deals with a club option for a fifth. 
Contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money, depending 
on the exact draft pick the player was selected with.[118] Players who 
were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any 
club.[110] The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL 
draft. The league holds a supplemental draft annually. Clubs submit emails 
to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they 
will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. 
The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a 
successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights 
to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft.[119] Players 
are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition 
for special eligibility.[120] The league holds expansion drafts, the most 
recent happening in 2002 when the Houston Texans began play as an expansion 
team.[121] Other drafts held by the league include an allocation draft 
in 1950 to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved 
All-America Football Conference[122] and a supplemental draft in 1984 to 
give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main 
draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the 
United States Football League or Canadian Football League.[123] Like the 
other major sports leagues in the United States, the NFL maintains protocol 
for a disaster draft. In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players 
killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could 
draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of 
a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a 
club's season being cancelled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither 
of these protocols has ever had to be implemented.[124] Free agents in 
the National Football League are divided into restricted free agents, who 
have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and 
unrestricted free agents, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose 
contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as "six or more regular-season 
games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically 
unable to perform lists".[125] Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate 
with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the 
right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with 
draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and 
no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.[125] Clubs 
are given one franchise tag to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The 
franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous 
contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at 
his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: 
exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, 
and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other 
clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round 
draft picks if they decline to match it.[126] Clubs also have the option 
to use a transition tag, which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise 
tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the 
offer.[127] Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used,[128] 
even with the removal of the "poison pill" strategy (offering a contract 
with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially 
ended the usage of the tag league-wide.[129] Each club is subject to a 
salary cap, which is set at US$143.28 million for the 2015 season, US$10 
million more than in 2014 and US$20 million more than in 2013.[130] Members 
of clubs' practice squads, despite being paid by and working for their 
respective clubs, are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are 
able to sign to any other club's active roster (provided their new club 
is not their previous club's next opponent within a set number of days) 
without compensation to their previous club; practice squad players cannot 
be signed to other clubs' practice squads, however, unless released by 
their original club first.[131] NFL Win-Loss Week 8, 2016 Explanatory notes
