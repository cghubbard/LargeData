The 1958 Milwaukee Braves season was a season in American baseball. The 
Braves finished first in the National League with a 92–62 record and returned 
to the World Series for the second consecutive year, losing to the New 
York Yankees in seven games. The Braves set a Major League record which 
still stands for the fewest players caught stealing in a season, with 8.[1] 
The core of the Braves team was once again Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Joe 
Adcock, Warren Spahn, and Lew Burdette. Also, outfielder Bill Bruton came 
back from his season-ending injury in 1957 to play in 100 games. Aaron 
led the team with 196 hits, 109 runs scored, and 95 runs batted in, and 
Mathews led the team with 31 home runs. However, in 1958 the Braves' third 
starting pitcher, Bob Buhl, was injured after pitching in just 11 games 
(winning five), which put even more pressure on Spahn, Burdette, and their 
manager Fred Haney to be able to win. Also, because of injuries, Adcock 
played in only 105 games, and Wes Covington played in just 90. Red Schoendienst 
played in just 106 games, including many as just a pinch hitter, and it 
was discovered the next year that he had tuberculosis. In this difficult 
situation, Spahn posted a 22–11 record in 290 innings pitched and 23 complete 
games, and Burdette had a 20–10 record in 275 innings. The Braves repeated 
as the National League champions, this time by a margin of eight games 
over the Pittsburgh Pirates. The New York Yankees again won the American 
League, hence the two teams faced off against each other again in the World 
Series. The Braves roared ahead by winning three of the first four games 
for a 3–1 in the series. However, the Yankees regrouped and won games five, 
six, and seven—the final two in Milwaukee County Stadium, the Braves' home 
stadium—to win the World Championship. Infielders Other batters Coaches
