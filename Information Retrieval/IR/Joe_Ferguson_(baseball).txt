Joseph Vance Ferguson (born September 19, 1946 in San Francisco, California) 
is a retired Major League Baseball player who played for the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, and California Angels from 
1970 through 1983. A catcher/right fielder, he was listed at 6 ft 2 in 
(1.88 m), 200 lbs., batting and throwing right-handed. Ferguson reached 
the majors in 1970 with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming their everyday 
catcher in 1973. He set a major league record for catchers by committing 
only three errors, leading the National League catchers in fielding percentage 
(.996) and double plays (17), while hitting .263 with a .369 on-base percentage. 
He also reached career-highs in games played (136), home runs (25), RBI 
(88), runs (84), doubles (26) and walks (87). When Steve Yeager became 
a regular in the 1973 midseason, Ferguson shared catching duties and played 
right field against left-handed pitchers. He soon became known for having 
one of the strongest throwing arms of any outfielder in the major leagues. 
This came into play during Game One of the 1974 World Series against the 
Oakland Athletics, when Ferguson made a memorable play in right field in 
the top of the eighth inning, running in front of teammate Jimmy Wynn to 
catch a fly ball off the bat of Reggie Jackson, and then firing a 300-foot 
strike to Yeager to gun down Sal Bando, who was trying to score from third 
base. In Game Two, Ferguson hit a two-run homer off Vida Blue to provide 
the only Dodgers' victory in the Series. He enjoyed another fine season 
in 1977 with Houston, catching 122 games and hitting 16 home runs with 
61 RBI and a .379 OBP. Reacquired by the Dodgers in the 1978 midseason, 
he helped his team reach the 1978 World Series. After retiring, he coached 
at the major league level with the Texas Rangers (1986–87), working under 
former Dodger teammate Bobby Valentine, and the Dodgers (1988–94). He also 
managed in the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles and San Diego Padres minor league 
systems. He currently is in his 2nd season as the manager of the Camden 
Riversharks Atlantic League baseball team in New Jersey. No longer with 
the Riversharks, 2010. In a 14-season career, Ferguson was a .240 hitter
