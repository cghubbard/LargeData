Billy Ray Butler (born William Raymond Butler, Jr.; April 18, 1986), nicknamed 
"Country Breakfast", is an American professional baseball designated hitter 
and first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball 
(MLB) for the Kansas City Royals from 2007 to 2014, the Oakland Athletics 
from 2015 to 2016 and the New York Yankees in 2016. Butler was an MLB All-Star 
in 2012, and won the Silver Slugger Award and Edgar Martínez Award that 
season. Butler attended Wolfson High School in Jacksonville, Florida, where 
he was teammates with fellow first-round draft pick Eric Hurley, a pitcher 
selected by the Texas Rangers. He was selected by the Kansas City Royals 
in the first round (14th overall) of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft 
and signed for a $1.45 million bonus, $250,000 below the recommended slot 
value for that pick. He turned down a scholarship to play for the University 
of Florida, electing to play professional baseball.[1] Butler made his 
professional debut with the Idaho Falls Chukars in the Rookie-level Pioneer 
League, where he batted .373 with 10 home runs and 68 RBIs in 73 games. 
He was the Kansas City Royals Minor League Player of the Year, a Pioneer 
League All-Star and a Rookie League All-Star. The next year, Butler was 
the California League Rookie of the Year, a 2005 High A All-Star, Baseball 
America 1st team Minor League All-Star, Kansas City Royals Minor League 
Player of the Year, California League All-Star and the California/Carolina 
League All-Star Game MVP. In 2006, Butler led the Texas League with a .331 
batting average. Despite taking time out to play for the U.S. national 
baseball team, Butler amassed 96 RBIs while playing right field for the 
Double-A Wichita Wranglers. A third baseman in high school, Butler played 
right field and left field for Wichita in 2006. He was also selected to 
play for the United States squad in the 2006 All-Star Futures Game, where 
he hit the go-ahead home run and was selected game MVP.[2][3] Butler made 
his major league debut on May 1, 2007, singling in his first at bat, but 
was sent to the minors after playing 10 games. He was recalled on June 
19 after the Royals put slugger Mike Sweeney on the Disabled List.[4] Butler 
batted .292 in his rookie year with 8 home runs and 52 RBI. Butler's sophomore 
season was a disappointment. His batting average in 2008 fell to .275, 
his on-base percentage to .324 and his slugging percentage to .400. He 
was demoted mid-season to Triple-A Omaha, but later recalled. In 443 plate 
appearances (118 more than his rookie year), he managed only 11 HR and 
55 RBI. In 2009, Butler batted .301, while surpassing 500 at bats for the 
first time in his career. He solidified himself as the Royals' number three 
hitter with his emerging gap power and improved discipline at the plate. 
Butler led the Royals with career highs in RBI (92) and doubles (51), nearly 
eclipsing Hal McRae's team record of 54. He also had a career high in home 
runs, with 21. He was named Player of the Week twice. He also has played 
almost all of the 2009 season at first base, whereas before he was almost 
exclusively the designated hitter - citing the importance of a first baseman 
known for above-average hitting to also be focused in the other aspects 
of their play. Only five players had hit at least 20 home runs and 50 doubles 
in a season by his age. Butler was named the American League Player of 
the Week two times (August 2–8 and September 7–13). He was the American 
League Player of the Month for September. He was named the 2009 Royals 
Player of the Year. The 2010 season saw a slight drop in Butler's power 
numbers, dropping from 21 home runs and 92 RBI to 15 home runs and 78 runs 
batted in, respectively. However, he also posted an impressive .318 batting 
average, the highest of his career to that point. His .388 on-base percentage 
was also a career best. He also hit 45 doubles. Butler spent the 2010 season 
playing primarily first base. On January 23, 2011, Butler agreed to a $30 
million, four-year contract with the Royals.[5] In 2011 season, the promotion 
of first baseman Kila Ka'aihue from Triple-A Omaha meant that Butler would 
spend time alternating between first base and designated hitter to open 
the 2011 campaign. However, with Ka'aihue's demotion in May, the athletic 
Eric Hosmer was called up from Triple-A Omaha and became the team's everyday 
first baseman, with Butler becoming the full-time DH. On July 26, 2011, 
Billy Butler was a triple short of a cycle in a loss to the Boston Red 
Sox. Butler followed that performance with four home runs in the next three 
games. Butler won the 2011 Hutch Award. [6] He was the American League 
Player of the Week for July 25–31.[7] On July 1, 2012 Butler was selected 
to his first All-Star Game as a reserve on the American League roster. 
No Royals player was selected by fan or player vote but American League 
All-Star Team manager Ron Washington made Butler one of his seven selections.[8] 
At the time of his selection, Butler was hitting .297 with 16 home runs 
and 48 RBIs.[citation needed] He won the American League Player of the 
Week Award for the week ending on July 29.[9] After the season, he was 
named a 2012 American League Silver Slugger DH and received the 2012 Edgar 
Martinez Outstanding Designated Hitter Award.[10] On May 28, 2013 Billy 
Butler got his 1,000th hit in the first inning, bringing in Alex Gordon 
against St. Louis Cardinals' rookie pitcher Tyler Lyons. He played in all 
162 games, hit 15 home runs and drove in 82 runs while drawing a career 
high 79 walks. He had a slash line of .289/.374/.412. Butler had one of 
the worst statistical years of his career in 2014, hitting only nine home 
runs and amassing 66 RBI. His batting average, on base percentage, and 
slugging were all the lowest of his career. Leading into the World Series, 
Butler was batting .217 with 5 RBI in eight postseason contests. Following 
the season, the Royals declined Butler's club option, making him a free 
agent. On November 18, 2014, Butler signed a 3-year, $30 million contract 
with the Oakland Athletics.[11] In 2015, Butler batted a career-low .251 
with a .390 slugging percentage.[12] Butler was involved in a clubhouse 
fight with Danny Valencia on August 19, 2016. He was placed on the seven-day 
concussion list on August 22 as a result. Both players were fined but neither 
was suspended.[13] On September 11, 2016, the Athletics released Butler 
from his contract. He batted .276 with four home runs and 31 RBIs in 85 
games over the year.[12] Butler signed with the New York Yankees on September 
15 after a season ending injury to Aaron Judge.[14] He is married to Katie 
Hansen Butler and has a daughter, Kenley, who was born December 10, 2008. 
They live most of the year in Scottsdale, Arizona. He has a family in central 
Florida as well. His nickname was coined by former St. Joseph News-Press
