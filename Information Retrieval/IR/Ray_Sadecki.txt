Raymond Michael "Ray" Sadecki (December 26, 1940 – November 17, 2014) was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher. A left-hander, Sadecki pitched for the 
St. Louis Cardinals (1960–66, 1975), San Francisco Giants (1966–69), New 
York Mets (1970–74, 1977), Atlanta Braves (1975), Kansas City Royals (1975–76) 
and Milwaukee Brewers (1976). A “bonus baby,” Sadecki won Cardinal Rookie 
of the Year honors after posting a 9–9 record as a 19-year-old in 1960. 
He became a full-time starter in 1961, posting a 14–10 record. However, 
he exhibited periods of wildness during his first two seasons, walking 
86 batters in his rookie season (in 157 1⁄3 innings pitched) and 102 in 
1961. Sadecki’s best season was 1964; he posted a 20–11 record and, along 
with Bob Gibson and Curt Simmons, helped pitch the Cardinals to the National 
League pennant, their first since 1946, with the Philadelphia Phillies 
and Cincinnati Reds finishing tied for second, one game behind the Redbirds. 
The Phillies had held a 6 1⁄2-game lead over the Reds and Cardinals on 
September 20 with 12 games to play, only to squander the pennant by losing 
ten consecutive games, while the Cardinals and Reds recorded winning streaks 
of eight and nine games respectively. Sadecki won his 20th game on September 
29 against the Phillies for Philadelphia’s ninth consecutive loss and St. 
Louis’ seventh consecutive win. The win also pulled the Cardinals even 
with the Reds who, after taking over first place on September 27, had their 
nine-game winning streak snapped by the Pittsburgh Pirates on Bob Friend’s 
2–0 shutout earlier in the day. The next day, the Cardinals took over first 
place by defeating the Phillies while the Reds were again shut out by the 
Pirates. The Cardinals, ahead by a half-game over the Reds entering the 
final weekend, now appeared to have the pennant put away: their final three 
games were at home against the lowly New York Mets, while the Phillies 
and Reds were to play a two-game series at Crosley Field. However, the 
Cardinals lost the first two games of the series, first with Al Jackson 
outduelling Gibson 1–0 (that same day, the Phillies spotted the Reds a 
3–0 lead, then scored four runs in the eighth inning to win 4–3 and finally 
snap their 10-game losing streak), then Sadecki getting battered in one 
inning, giving up five runs in a 15–5 loss. The Cardinals won the pennant 
on the final day, defeating the Mets 11–5 while the Phillies hammered the 
Reds 10–0. After unexpectedly winning the pennant, the Cardinals defeated 
the New York Yankees in the World Series. Sadecki started Game One and 
gave up three runs in the second inning, but settled down after that and 
defeated the Yankees 9–5, in what would be Whitey Ford’s final World Series 
game. Starting Game Four, Sadecki was again battered early, this time being 
pulled after giving up three runs in one-third of an inning. The Cardinals, 
however, came back to win 4–3, the runs coming on Ken Boyer’s sixth-inning 
grand slam. The Cardinals went on to win the Series, with Gibson winning 
Games Five and Seven. In 1965 Sadecki’s record plummeted to 6–15, and his 
earned run average skyrocketed to 5.21. On May 8, 1966 he was traded to 
the San Francisco Giants for Orlando Cepeda. In 1967 he went 12–6 with 
a career-best 2.78 ERA; in 1968 he posted a 2.91 ERA but with a 12–18 record, 
the 18 losses tying him with Claude Osteen for the Major League lead. After 
a 5–8 record as a spot starter in 1969 Sadecki was again traded, this time 
to the New York Mets. In 1973 Sadecki pitched for the Mets’ National League 
champions who, like the 1964 Cardinals before them, unexpectedly won the 
pennant, trailing by as many as nine games behind the Chicago Cubs and 
winning the National League East title on the final weekend. (Coincidentally, 
four years earlier the Mets, prior to unexpectedly winning the World Series, 
had also won the division title by jumping past the Cubs.) Sadecki pitched 
as a “swingman”—relief pitcher and spot starter in a rotation with Tom 
Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Jon Matlack—in helping the Mets win the division. 
He pitched four of the seven games of the World Series, which the Mets 
lost to the Oakland Athletics, gaining the save in Game Four. In his 18-year 
career, Sadecki won 135 games against 131 losses, with a 3.78 ERA and 1614 
strikeouts in 2500⅔ innings pitched. When Catholic Charities of Kansas 
City and the Baseball Tomorrow Fund renovated a baseball field in 2002, 
it was dedicated and renamed Ray Sadecki Field in honor of the neighborhood 
native. It stands at 9th and Homer Streets in Kansas City, Kansas. On June 
14, 2007 Sadecki was inducted into The National Polish-American Sports 
Hall of Fame.[1] Sadecki died from complications of blood cancer on November
