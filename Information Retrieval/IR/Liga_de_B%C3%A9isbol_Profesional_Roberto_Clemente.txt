The Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente or LBPRC formerly known 
as Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico Baseball 
League, is the main professional baseball league in Puerto Rico. In 2007, 
the LBPRC suspended operations for the first time since its creation. In 
2008, the organization resumed operations, after restructuring. These included 
renaming the league to Puerto Rico Baseball League and establishing a website.[2][3] 
In May 2012, the league debuted its current name, choosing to honor hall 
of famer Roberto Clemente by naming it after him and adopting his philosophy 
of athletic development.[4] Currently consisting of five teams, the league's 
champion participates in the Caribbean Series. Puerto Rican Baseball began 
at the end of the 19th century. The first two clubs were founded in 1897: 
the Almendares Baseball Club owned by Francisco Alamo Armas, and the Borinquen 
Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.[5] According to El Pais newspaper, 
the first game was played on January 11, 1898 at the old velodrome in Santurce, 
San Juan. The Borinquen beat the Almendares 3 to 0. The first game to complete 
nine innings was played on January 30, 1898, when the Borinquen beat the 
Almendares again, 9 to 3.[5] Enrique Huyke, a professor from Mayagüez, 
originally suggested the establishment of an organized baseball league 
in Puerto Rico. The idea was adopted by Teofilo Maldonado, president of 
the Commission on Recreation and Sports. A third party, Gabriel Castro, 
helped Huyke with the scouting of organizations which had to pay a thousand 
dollars prior to being admitted, while independent entities like the Guayama 
Rotary Club collaborated in raising funds for the teams.[6] The Liga de 
Béisbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico (LBSPR) was founded in 1938, as 
a semi-professional league.[7] Six team formed the new organization, these 
were the Senadores de San Juan, Leones de Ponce, Criollos de Caguas, Brujos 
de Guayama and Grises Orientales de Humacao.[8] The first Puerto Rican 
players to play in Major League Baseball, Hiram Bithorn and Luis Olmo, 
were active in the rosters of San Juan and Caguas. Bithorn became the younger 
manager in the league's history, receiving the office when he was 22 years 
old.[9] Huyke served as manager for Mayagüez for less than a month, because 
the team's owner threatened to remove its entry if he did not take the 
office.[6] Maldonado was named the league's commissioner. Changes in the 
rosters were allowed only during the first half of the season, meeting 
a deadline before the beginning of the second half. While the number of 
games has historically varied from 40 to 80 games per season.[10] The All-Star 
game was scheduled to coincide with the traditional Three Kings Day, an 
idea suggested by Angel Colon so that the proceeds could be used to buy 
toys.[10] This date was used for decades, until the emergence of television 
forced the league to comply to the dates requested by the networks.[11] 
One of the main figures of the league in its early stage was veteran Negro 
leagues' veteran, Emilio Navarro.[12] The Cangrejeros de Santurce and Tiburones 
de Aguadilla joined the original teams in the 1939–40 season. On January 
8, 1939, Humacao and San Juan played an 18-inning game that lasted four 
hours, establishing a record.[13] Between 1938 and 1941, the LBSPR was 
part of the National Semi-Professional Baseball Congress, with titleholder 
Guayama facing the champions of the Congress' United States branch in best-of-seven 
series in 1939, where they defeated the Duncan Cementers, and again in 
1940, with a roster that included the league's Most Valuable Player, Satchel 
Paige.[6] In 1939–40, Perucho Cepeda, the defending batting champion, won 
the league's batting title over Josh Gibson, who managed to win it the 
following season.[14] The Criollos de Caguas won their firs championship 
in 1940–41, defeating the Cangrejeros in the final series. Santurce's Luis 
Cabrera was the last player to win the LBSPR' Most Valuable Player award.[15] 
On September 14, 1941, Rafael Delgado Márquez proposed that the league 
was renamed to Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (LBPPR), effectively 
moving the league towards professionalism.[6] A format of vueltas (halves) 
was adopted[16] since the league's creation, where the winners of each 
vuelta facing each other for the championship. However, Ponce managed to 
win three consecutive championships (1941–1945) without having to participate 
in a final by winning both vueltas.[6] Consequently, the fans of teams 
that were mathematically eliminated by this format lost interest in the 
tournament. Some players also concluded their participation in the season 
after the teams were eliminated. To deal with this issue, the league established 
a new playoff format, where the top four teams where included.[6] Francisco 
Coimbre was a key member of Ponce's success with his offensive, winning 
two batting championships, establishing a league record for most consecutive 
games with hits and not recording a single strikeout in three consecutive 
seasons (1939–42).[10] The consistency of his performances earned him a 
Most Valuable Player award. Other players that participated for Ponce included 
Juan Guilbe and Griffin Tirado.[17] World War II affected the league directly, 
reducing the 1942–43 season's length with only four active teams. This 
amount of teams continued until 1946, while the rule that allowed the participation 
of three imported players per team, was suspended from 1942 to 1944.[6] 
In the 1944–45 season, Canena Marquez debuted in the league establishing 
a record of highest batting average for a rookie with .361, fulfilling 
the minimum required at-bats.[18] The Senadores de San Juan won their first 
championship on 1945–46, defeating the Indios in the finals.[19] During 
this season, Joe Buzas became the first foreign MLB player to manage in 
the LBPPR.[20] Tomas “Planchardon” Quiñones won two back-to-back Most Valuable 
Player awards from 1943 to 1945.[21] In 1947, the league's team participated 
in a series of five games against the New York Yankees, which featured 
Ponce defeating the visiting team.[10] Jose “Pantalones“ Santiago debuted 
in this season, earning the Rookie of the Year recognition while Canena 
Marquez broke Josh Gibson's home run record of 13.[21] Vic Power made his 
debut for the Criollos on the 1947–48 season, in which the team won the 
league's title with a roster that included Rafaelito Ortiz, who was the 
only pitcher to win 10 or more games for 3 different LBPPR teams.[22] Mayaguez 
won the 1948–49 championship with a roster that included Canena Marquez 
and Luke Easter.[23] That same year, the LBPPR joined the Caribbean Series, 
beginning a rivalry with the Cuban League's champion that lasted throughout 
the next decade, until Cuba ceased to participate in the event.[24] A decade 
after its foundation, the league was employing an 80-game schedule. Several 
new ballparks have been built by the 1949–50 season, this was due to an 
attendance average of 750,000.[10] Each of the stadiums built surpassed 
6,000 seats, with Ponce's Paquito Mountaner reaching 9,718 seats by then.[10] 
The installation of lights that allowed the organizations of games at night 
increased attendance. Estadio Sixto Escobar had a maximum capacity of over 
15,000, with 13,135 seats.[25] Percucho Cepeda was one of the league's 
dominant figures during the 1940s, winning two batting championships and 
a Most Valuable Player award. Natalio Irizarry won the league's Rookie 
of the Year recognition in 1949–50.[26] From 1949–1955, the league featured 
the participation of new MLB players, including Johnny Logan, Harvey Haddix 
and Hank Aaron among several others.[27] The players began choosing the 
league to play due to its competitive level and warm climate during the 
winter, a custom that has continued until the current decade. Players of 
the Negro leagues preferred it due to lack of racism towards the players, 
as opposed to the United States.[28] In 1952, Roberto Clemente made his 
debut with the Cangrejeros hitting .234. He was signed by Pedrin Zorilla, 
debuting in the league as a teenager.[29] The team won that year's title 
and Cot Deal was named MVP.[30] Clemente improved this average to .288 
the following season, but Santurce finished last in the league.[31] The 
league's champions were the Criollos, who also won the Caribbean Series.[32] 
With a roster that also included Luis Olmo, Willy Mays and Ruben Gomez, 
the Cangrejeros won the 1954–55 championship defeating Caguas in the finals, 
4–1.[32] During this season, Clemente became the first Puerto Rican player 
to hit two home runs in the league's All-Star game.[32] The team also went 
on to win the Caribbean Series, which were held in Venezuela.[33] Jim Rivera 
hand an average of .450 and was named MVP.[34] Puerto Rican fans received 
the team with a parade upon landing and Luis Muñoz Marín welcomed them 
in La Fortaleza.[33] In 1955–56, the Criollos won the league's championship, 
in a season that marked Orlando Cepeda's debut in the league.[32] Clemente 
won the season's batting championship with an average of .396.[29] In 1956–57, 
the league's championship was won by the Indios. During this season, Clemente 
went on to break the league's record for most games with hits, previously 
established by Francisco Coimbre in 1943–44.[35] The following season, 
the Criollos defeated the Cangrejeros to win the championship. Clemente 
who now played for Caguas, hit .529 during the final series.[36] Juan "Terin" 
Pizarro won the Most Valuable Player Award, leading the league in wins, 
ERA, best win-to-loss margin and pitched the LBPPR's seventh no-hitter.[37] 
In the Caribbean Series, he defeated Carta Vieja of Panama (8:0), recording 
17 strikeouts.[37] Both teams traded the final two championships of the 
decade. The 1959–60 season marked the first instance that LBPPR games were 
transmitted in two languages through radio.[38] The Criollos won the championship, 
while Mayaguez's Ramon Luis Conde won the Most Valuable Player Award.[39] 
During the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy experienced significant growth, 
which propitiated baseball-related gambling.[40] This tendency experienced 
a notable increase in the early 1960s. Other changes were experienced in 
the game's style with the introduction of more player-managers, such as 
Luis Olmo's, who became the first to consistently employ pitching coaches 
and closers in the league.[41] Vic Power used other unusual managing techniques, 
such as using Frank Howard as a relief pitcher as well as becoming the 
first player-manager to sit himself in favor of a pinch hitter, replacing 
his turn in the lineup with Herminio Cortes.[42] After the Cuban Revolution, 
hotels and casinos in San Juan benefited from Havana's economic decay.[43] 
During this timeframe, Puerto Rico expanded its presence in the Caribbean, 
and a native team frequently played against a representation of St. Thomas 
and Saint Croix in February.[44] Julio Navarro was drafted from one of 
these exhibitions, eventually becoming one of the league's dominant pitchers.[44] 
The Dominican Winter League was still not a member of the Caribbean Confederation 
back then, which allowed uncommon interleague trades between it and the 
LBPPR, which would have more trouble negotiating such deals with member 
leagues.[23] During this decade, some of the league's teams would provide 
import players with houses and taxis for transportation. The Senadores 
de San Juan, led by Clemente, who had just won the MLB World Series with 
Pittsburgh, won the league's 1960–61 season, as well as Jose Santiago, 
who recorded a record of 10–2 with an ERA of 2.44 for the team.[45] Luis 
"Tite" Arroyo won the season's Most Valuable Player award, registering 
a record of 10–2 with an ERA of 1.64.[46] Due to political tension, the 
Caribbean Series that were planned to take place in Habana were cancelled. 
The event was replaced by the Interamerican Series, which San Juan attended 
with a roster that included pitcher Florentino Rivera.[45] The Interamerican 
Series were held three more times, with each team winning the one held 
in their home field. Mayaguez did so in 1963, in a series where Terin Pizarro 
recorded the only no-hitter in the history of the event, in a win over 
Valencia at the opening night.[47] In 1961–62, the Lobos de Arecibo joined 
the league as an expansion team.[48] On January 14, 1962, Julio Navarro 
pitched the first regular season no-hitter.[13] For the 1962–63 season, 
Estadio Sixto Escobar was replaced by the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, with a 
capacity of 20,000 seats by then.[25] In 1963–64, Clemente finished second 
with a batting average of .345, leading the Senadores to the title.[49] 
San Juan once again played in the Interamerican Series, held in Nicaragua.[49] 
In 1964–65, Orlando Cepeda joined the Cangrejeros, replacing Jim Beauchamp 
helping the team win the league's championship. During this season, Clemente 
was named San Juan' player-manager, leading them to the playoffs.[50] The 
All-Star game featured a format where Latin American players faced North 
American players.[51] The following season featured the debut of Jerry 
Morales who won the league's Rookie of the Year recognition after participating 
for Puerto Rico's national baseball team in the 1966 Central American and 
Caribbean Games.[52] Carlos Bernier retired in 1966, having won five stolen 
base titles for a total of 285.[26] On November 20, 1966, San Juan's Luis 
de Leon pitched the first perfect game in the league's history.[53] Caguas 
won the league's championship in 1967–68.[43] Nino Escalera, who finished 
his career third on the league's hit list, replaced Vic Power as the team's 
manager during this season.[54] On December 20, 1969, Santurce and Arecibo 
participated in the only LBPPR game played outside of Puerto Rico, held 
in the United States Virgin Islands to honor Elrod Hendricks.[55] Ponce 
won the second of back-to-back championships in 1969–70 as well as the 
Caribbean Series' title being led in both by Conde's offensive.[56] Wayne 
Simpson was selected MVP.[57] The Cangrejeros won the 1970–71 championship, 
defeating the Criollos in the finals.[58] Ponce's Santos Alomar Sr. won 
the league's batting championship and was named MVP, while Willie Montañez 
of Caguas led the league in home runs after recording 30 in Major League 
Baseball.[59] Clemente returned to serve as San Juan's manager for the 
season, naming Nino Escalera as his coach.[60] He only accepted the work 
for a year, expecting Escalera to replace him during the following season. 
The team advanced to the playoffs, losing their series against Santurce.[58] 
Clemente also managed Puerto Rico to a win in the All-Star game, which 
featured a format of natives versus foreign players.[61] He was succeeded 
as Santurce's manager by Frank Robinson on the 1971–72 season. Ruben Gomez 
also performed in the office temporarily, while Robinson attended a tour 
in Japan with Baltimore.[62] The Cangrejeros won the 1972–73 title. That 
season's All-Star game was dedicated in Clemente's honor, who died a week 
before while transporting supplies to victims of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake.[63] 
Both native and foreign players won a black band on their arms to symbolize 
grief. The Criollos won the 1973–74 championship, possessing the league's 
strongest native lineup. Jerry Morales led the team, hitting 14 home runs 
as Caguas' lead-off hitter.[64] Eduardo Figueroa led the league in wins 
on back-to-back seasons, recording 10-3 twice from 1973–75.[65] This was 
the first year that the league employed the designated hitter rule, including 
the position in the batting lineups.[39] Gomez who had continued pitching 
for Santurce, retired in the 1975–76 season. By this time, he has played 
for nine champion teams and worked under nine managers.[62] The Crillos 
won the 1976–77 championship, being led by the league's MVP, Jose Cruz.[65] 
The Indios won the title the following season with a lineup that included 
MVP Kurt Bevaqua and went on to win the Caribbean Series held in Mazatlan, 
Mexico, Jose Manuel Morales leading all batters with an .421 average.[66][67] 
Caguas won its ninth championship in the 1978–79 season. Jose Cruz, along 
his two brothers Cirilo and Hector, represented the team in the Caribbean 
Series.[65] Bayamón won the last championship of this decade, with a roster 
that included the batting champion, Dave Bergman.[68] Coming back from 
a fourth-place regular season finish, the Criollos won their tenth championship 
in the 1980–81 season, but the Caribbean Series were not held that year.[69] 
On January 2, 1981, Rickey Henderson established a new stolen bases record 
with 42. Orlando Gomez made his debut as a manager for Mayaguez and won 
the Manager of the Year award.[70] Dickie Thon won the first of two back-to-back 
batting titles this season.[71] This also marked Alomar Sr.'s last active 
season, retiring forth on the fourth place of league's all-time hit leaders.[72] 
In 1981–82, the Lobos de Arecibo recessed and their native star players, 
Edwin Nuñez, Candy Maldonado and Ramón Avilés were drafted by the remaining 
teams.[48] The team returned the following season, winning the franchise's 
first championship.[48] The team won the 1983 Caribbean Series, receiving 
a large welcoming ceremony at Muñoz Marin Airport that included a parade 
from San Juan to Arecibo. Maldonado, who became the third native player 
to hit two home runs in an All-Star game, along Clemente and Ismael Oquendo, 
was included in the Series' All Star team after recording a .348 average.[73] 
In the 1974–75 season, the Senadores de San Juan were moved to Bayamón, 
being renamed Vaqueros de Bayamón.[74] From 1974 to 1983, the team hosted 
their games in Estadio Juan Ramon Loubriel, which has 16,000 seats. Bayamon's 
Carmelo Martinez was selected MVP.[75] Mayaguez won the 1983–84 season, 
with Santurce's Jerry Willard being selected MVP.[76] Besides this, the 
players were rewarded with a cruise trip and met the Governor of Puerto 
Rico.[33] Eduardo Figueroa led the league in ERA, winning the recognition 
of Comeback Player of the Year.[71] For the 1984–85 season, the Vaqueros 
were moved back to San Juan and re-adopted their original name, Senadores 
de San Juan.[74] However, one year later they were rechristen as the Metros 
de San Juan, a name that they conserved until 1994.[74] The team won the 
LBPPR title that season. The team also won the Caribbean Series being led 
by Francisco Javier Oliveras, who won a game in the series and had previously 
recorded eight regular season wins and one in the semifinals.[73] Henry 
Cotto of Caguas was selected the league's MVP.[73] Rúben Sierra debuted 
for Santurce and won the league's Rookie of the Year award.[77] One of 
Puerto Rico's most successful managers, Mako Oliveras, made his managing 
debut in December 1984, subsequently becoming responsible for giving playing 
time to unknown prospects such as Benito Santiago, Edgar Martinez and Carlos 
Baerga, all of which would go on to become stars.[70] Mayaguez won the 
1985–86 championship. This marked Roberto Alomar's debut in the LBPPR, 
debuting for the Criollos after being drafted by Arecibo while in high 
school. Caguas won the 1986–87 championship, the team went on to win the 
Caribbean Series, featuring an native lineup that included Alomar, Carmelo 
Martinez, Edgar Diaz, German Rivera, Henry Cotto, Orlando Mercado and Heidi 
Vargas.[78] This was Jose Cruz's final year in the league, having amassed 
119 home runs, 40 for the Leones and 70 with Caguas, finishing second in 
the all-time list.[79] The Indios de Mayagüez won the 1985–86 season, being 
led by Luis Quiñones' three home runs in the finals over San Juan.[75] 
Caguas won the 1986–87 championship and their third Caribbean Series‘ title, 
being led by a lineup that included Cotto and Oliveras.[73] Mayagüez won 
the first of back to back titles in 1987–88. This year the All-Star Game 
commemorated the league's 50th anniversary, being dedicated to Angel Colon.[80] 
The Metro region defeated the Island region, 1:0. Mayaguez won the 1988–89 
title, once again being led by Quiñones‘ clutch hitting.[75] Javier Lopez 
debuted in 1988, winning the league's Rookie of the Year recognition.[81] 
San Juan won the championship in the 1989–90 season.[78] The season featured 
the debut of Juan González, who under the initiative of that season's Manager 
of the Year, Ramón Aviles, played every game with Caguas, finishing second 
in home runs with 9 and RBIs with 34.[82] He was traded for Alomar during 
the off-season.[83] Gonzalez also reinforced San Juan, recording two home 
runs in the Caribbean Series.[83] Carlos Baerga and Edgar Martinez were 
named co-MVPs. Martinez became the first player in 41 seasons to win the 
batting crown with an average above.400, registering .424.[84] Santurce 
won the title the following year, which featured the debut of Wil Cordero, 
who was named Rookie of the Year.[84] In the 1991–1992 season, the Criollos 
de Caguas franchise was moved to Bayamón, but experienced low attendance 
in that municipality.[85] Due to this, their star players, Juan González 
and Iván Rodríguez, were drafted by Santurce and Mayagüez respectively. 
The Indios won that season's championship and the Caribbean Series held 
in Mexico, with Chad Kreuter winning the series' MVP award.[86] Roberto 
Hernandez won a tie-breaker with Venezuela to secure the series.[87] Cordero 
was recognized as the league's MVP. The 1992–93 season featured the return 
of Dickie Thon to the league, who led Santurce to a championship over San 
Juan in the finals as well as the debut of Jose Cruz as a manager.[71] 
The finals series featured both Thon and Juan González, which attracted 
90,369 fans throughout six games, including a record of 23,701 in the last 
game.[71] González had won consecutive batting titles in Major League Baseball 
and was selected the MVP after recording an average of .333 with seven 
home runs and 14 RBIs.[83] Other MLB players, including Iván Rodríguez, 
Sandy Alomar, Jr. and Omar Olivares returned to the league during that 
season.[71] The Cangrejeros went on to win their fourth Caribbean Series' 
title. Cordero won the league's batting championship.[84] Until 1993, all 
of the ballparks featured natural grass, with Ponce being the first to 
install artificial turf during that year. The Senadores de San Juan defeated 
the Cuban national baseball team on December 1, 1993, with a walk-off home 
run by Javier Lopez.[81] The 1993–94 championship was won by San Juan, 
which was led by Carmelo Martinez's second MVP season.[75] The Criollos 
rejoined the league for the 1994–95 season and Gonzalez returned to the 
team. The Cangrejeros won that year's championship, repeating Puerto Rico's 
title in the Caribbean Series.[86] That year, the Senadores de San Juan 
managed by Luis "Torito" Meléndez won the title, subsequently assembling 
one of the strongest teams in the history of the Caribbean Series.[88] 
The group, which was dubbed "Dream Team", featured Major League Baseball 
players in most positions, counting with a lineup that included Roberto 
Alomar, Carlos Baerga, Bernie Williams, Juan González, Edgar Martínez, 
Carlos Delgado, Rubén Sierra, Rey Sánchez and Carmelo Martínez.[88] Puerto 
Rico's offensive dominated the tournament, eventually winning the Caribbean 
Series' championship with an undefeated record of 6–0.[88] The team was 
responsible for the only two losses of the Dominican Republic, the country 
that finished second, scoring victories against Pedro Martínez and José 
Rijo in the third and sixth games respectively.[88] Alomar, who had been 
traded to the team from Ponce for Javier Lopez during the off-season, was 
named the series' Most Valuable Player after batting 560 with two home 
runs.[78] In August 2007, it was announced that the 2007–2008 season was 
cancelled due to shrinking attendance and profits over the last 10 years, 
and the league would instead work on a marketing plan and reorganization. 
In May 2008, it was announced that the league would come back for the 2008–09 
season, and that the Manati Athenians would be moved once again to Santurce, 
and become the Santurce Crabbers. As part of the restructuring, Major League 
Baseball offered to work to increase publicity. On July 15, 2008, personnel 
from the league and Major League Baseball participated in a meeting where 
details about the league's merchandising were discussed.[89] Ponce was 
the first team to classify to the post season, leading the league. Arecibo 
and Santurce also classified directly. The last space for the playoffs 
was decided with a "sudden death" game, with Mayagüez defeating Caguas 
in with scores of 6–0. On January 8, the players from eliminated teams 
participated in a special draft, with players including Iván Rodríguez, 
Saúl Rivera and Luis Matos going to new teams.[90] The Indios and Cangrejeros 
were eliminated in the semifinals, with Ponce and Arecibo advancing. In 
the finals, the Leones won the first game, only losing the second before 
dominating three straight to win the league's championship. On October 
2, 2009, García resigned his position as president of the league, citing 
"personal reasons".[91] Subsequently, Sadi Antonmattei was elected by the 
board of directors to serve as president.[92] On October 19, 2009, the 
league revealed a contract with WIPR-TV to broadcast its games.[93] The 
2009–10 season was inaugurated on November 20, 2009, with games between 
Ponce versus Carolina and Arecibo versus Mayagüez-Aguadilla.[94] This year 
marked the first time that the league only had five active participants 
since 1993–94, due to the Cangrejeros' recess. During this season, the 
inter-league games with the Dominican Winter Baseball League continued 
being included in the official record books of both organizations. Indios 
de Mayagüez won the 2009–10 season, their 16th championship (most in the 
league) when they defeated the Criollos de Caguas 4 games to 1. Three games
