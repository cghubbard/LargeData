The 1992 Toronto Blue Jays played their sixteenth season in Major League 
Baseball. Toronto finished first in the American League East for the fourth 
time with a record of 96 wins and 66 losses, closing the season with an 
attendance record of 4,028,318.[1] Toronto was not swept in a single series 
all year, becoming the first team in 49 years to accomplish the feat.[2] 
In the American League Championship Series, the Blue Jays defeated the 
Oakland Athletics in six games for their first American League pennant 
in four tries. In the World Series, Toronto faced the Atlanta Braves, who 
had won their second straight National League pennant, but lost the previous 
year's World Series. The Blue Jays prevailed in six games, becoming the 
first non-U.S.-based team to win a World Series. The Toronto Blue Jays 
spent their 16th spring training at Dunedin, Florida, while playing their 
home exhibition games at Dunedin Stadium at Grant Field for the 3rd spring 
training season. Despite their post-season success, the Blue Jays had many 
ups and downs during the regular season. The Jays started off winning the 
first six games of the regular season and Roberto Alomar was named the 
AL Player of the Month for the month of April. On August 25, they had lost 
six of their last seven games and were only two games ahead of the Baltimore 
Orioles in the standings.[7] At this point, general manager Pat Gillick 
decided to acquire a fiery right-hander from the New York Mets named David 
Cone. The trade resulted in the Jays sending minor league prospect Ryan 
Thompson and utility infielder Jeff Kent to the Mets.[8] The deal sent 
the message that the Blue Jays were committed to winning. Cone would have 
4 wins, 3 losses and a 2.55 ERA.[9] The regular season also marked the 
end of the road for Dave Stieb, who made his last start for the Blue Jays 
on August 8 and only lasted three innings.[10] On September 23, Stieb announced 
that he was finished for the season. 1992 was Stieb's final season for 
the Jays before briefly coming out of retirement years later. Four days 
later, on September 27, Jack Morris would make club history by becoming 
the first pitcher in franchise history to win 20 games in a season. Morris 
would have to wait through a two-hour rain delay at Yankee Stadium to get 
the win.[10] Heading into the last weekend of the season, only the Milwaukee 
Brewers were still in contention. Led by manager Phil Garner, the Brewers 
had won 22 of 29 games since August 29.[1] The Brewers trailed the Blue 
Jays by 2 games, and the Jays were heading into a weekend series vs. the 
Detroit Tigers. On October 3, Juan Guzmán had a one-hitter through eight 
innings and Duane Ward picked up the save as the Jays won the game 3-1 
and clinched the American League East Division title.[1] [1] [2] [3] [4]
