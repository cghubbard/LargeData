Rex Ralston Cecil (October 8, 1916 – October 30, 1966) was an American 
professional baseball player. The right-handed pitcher, a native of Lindsay, 
Oklahoma, had a 14-year pro career, including 18 games pitched, 16 as a 
starter, in Major League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox (1944–1945). Cecil 
batted left-handed, stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighed 195 
pounds (88 kg). Cecil's early pro career (1937–1939; 1941–1944) was based 
on the West Coast, especially in the Western International and Pacific 
Coast leagues. In 1944, during the peak of the World War II manpower shortage, 
Cecil won 19 of 30 decisions, with a stellar 2.16 earned run average, for 
the PCL San Diego Padres and was acquired by the Red Sox. Making his Major 
League debut on August 13, 1944, in relief against the eventual American 
League champion St. Louis Browns at Fenway Park, Cecil threw four scoreless 
innings and earned the victory when Baseball Hall of Fame second baseman 
Bobby Doerr hit a walk-off home run in the 13th inning.[1] He then threw 
successive complete games as a starting pitcher, against the Detroit Tigers 
and Cleveland Indians, and split two decisions. During his rookie campaign 
for Boston, Cecil won four games, lost five and compiled a 5.11 earned 
run average. In 1945, Cecil began the year with the BoSox and was Boston's 
Opening Day starting pitcher on April 17 against the New York Yankees at 
Yankee Stadium. Cecil lasted 6 1⁄3 innings and allowed eight runs — although 
only two were earned, as he was victimized by three errors by first baseman 
Catfish Metkovich and made one miscue himself. New York won the game, 8–4.[2] 
He started six more games during April and May, but in his seven 1945 starts 
he lost five, won two, and again compiled a high earned run average, at 
5.20. He then was demoted to Boston's top farm team, the Louisville Colonels 
of the American Association, and spent the rest of his pro career in the 
minors. In a two-season Major League career, Cecil posted a 6–10 record 
with 63 strikeouts and a 5.18 ERA in 106 innings pitched, allowing 118 
hits and 60 bases on balls. During his long minor league career, he won 
161 games, including 21 games in his final pro season, 1953, in the Class 
C Arizona–Texas League. Rex Cecil died in Long Beach, California, at the
