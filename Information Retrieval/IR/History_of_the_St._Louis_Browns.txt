The Major League Baseball team now known as the Baltimore Orioles originated 
in Milwaukee as the Milwaukee Brewers, and then moved to St. Louis, Missouri, 
where they played for more than 50 years as the St. Louis Browns. This 
article covers the franchise's history in St. Louis, which began when the 
team moved from Milwaukee after the 1901 season and ended with the team's 
move to Baltimore after the 1953 season. As of August 30, 2016, there are 
only 17 living former St. Louis Browns players. In the late 19th century, 
the team existed as the Milwaukee Brewers in the Western League.[1] For 
the 1900 season, the Western League was renamed to "American League", and 
in 1901, it was converted to a major league under the leadership of Ban 
Johnson. Johnson had originally intended to move the Milwaukee Brewers 
to St. Louis. When he couldn't find a suitable owner, he was forced to 
operate the team in Milwaukee for a lame-duck season in 1901. In 1902, 
however, he found a suitable St. Louis-based owner in carriage maker Robert 
Lee Hedges, who moved the team to St. Louis and changed their name to the 
"Browns", in reference to the original name of the 1880s club that by 1900 
was known as the Cardinals. Hedges built a new park on the site of the 
old Browns' former home, Sportsman's Park. In their first St. Louis season, 
the Browns finished second. Although the Browns had only four winning seasons 
from 1902 to 1922, they were very popular at the gate during their first 
two decades in St. Louis, and trounced the Cardinals in attendance. In 
1909, the Browns rebuilt Sportsman's Park as the third concrete-and-steel 
park in the majors. During this time, the Browns were best known for their 
role in the race for the 1910 American League batting title. Ty Cobb took 
the last game of the season off, believing that his slight lead over Nap 
Lajoie, of the Cleveland Naps, would hold up unless Lajoie had a near-perfect 
day at the plate. Browns' manager Jack O'Connor had ordered rookie third 
baseman Red Corriden to play on the outfield grass. This all but conceded 
a hit for any ball Lajoie bunted. Lajoie bunted five straight times down 
the third base line and made it to first easily. On his last at-bat, Lajoie 
reached base on an error – officially giving him a hitless at-bat. O'Connor 
and coach Harry Howell tried to bribe the official scorer, a woman, to 
change the call to a hit – even offering to buy her a new wardrobe. Cobb 
won the batting title by just a few thousandths of a point over Lajoie 
(though it later emerged that one game may have been counted twice in the 
statistics). After news broke of the scandal, a writer for the St. Louis 
Post claimed: "All St. Louis is up in arms over the deplorable spectacle, 
conceived in stupidity and executed in jealousy." The resulting outcry 
triggered an investigation by American League president Ban Johnson. At 
his insistence, Hedges[2] fired O'Connor and Howell; both men were informally 
banned from baseball for life. In 1916, Hedges sold the Browns to Philip 
DeCatesby Ball, who owned the St. Louis Terriers in the by-then-defunct 
Federal League. Ball's early tenure saw the club's first real sustained 
period of success on the field; they were a contender for most of the early 
1920s. This was fueled by Ball's free spending to put a winner of the field; 
he reinvested all profits into the team. However, Ball made a series of 
blunders that would ultimately doom the franchise. Shortly after buying 
the team, he fired general manager Branch Rickey, who was promptly hired 
by the Cardinals. Four years later, Ball allowed the Cardinals to move 
out of dilapidated Robison Field and share Sportsman's Park with the Browns. 
Rickey and Cardinals owner Sam Breadon used the proceeds from the Robison 
Field sale to build baseball's first modern farm system. This effort eventually 
produced several star players that brought the Cardinals more drawing power 
than the Browns. The 1922 Browns excited their owner by almost beating 
the Yankees to a pennant. The club was boasting the best players in franchise 
history, including future Hall of Famer George Sisler and an outfield trio 
of Ken Williams, Baby Doll Jacobson, and Jack Tobin that batted .300 or 
better from 1919–23 and in 1925. In 1922, Williams became the first player 
in Major League history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season, 
something that would not be done again in the Majors until 1956. Ball confidently 
predicted that there would be a World Series in Sportsman's Park by 1926. 
In anticipation, he increased the capacity of his ballpark from 18,000 
to 30,000. There was a World Series in Sportsman's Park in 1926 – but it 
was the Cardinals who took part, upsetting the Yankees. St. Louis had been 
considered a "Browns town" until then; after their 1926 series victory, 
however, the Cardinals dominated St. Louis baseball while still technically 
tenants of the Browns. Meanwhile, the Browns rapidly fell into the cellar. 
They only had two winning records from 1927 to 1943, including a 43-111 
mark in 1939 that is still the worst in franchise history. Ball died in 
1933. His estate ran the team for three years until Rickey helped broker 
a sale to investment banker Donald Lee Barnes, whose son-in-law, Bill DeWitt, 
was the team's general manager. To help finance the purchase, Barnes sold 
20,000 shares of stock to the public at $5 a share, an unusual practice 
for a sports franchise. By 1941, Barnes was convinced he could never make 
any money in St. Louis. After interests in Los Angeles approached him about 
buying a stake in the team, he asked AL owners for permission to move there 
for the 1942 season. Los Angeles was already the third-largest city in 
the United States, and was larger than any major-league city except New 
York and Chicago. They got tentative approval from the league, which went 
as far as to draw up a schedule accounting for transcontinental train trips, 
though the Browns suggested that teams could travel by plane, a new concept 
at the time. The deal was slated to receive final approval at a league 
meeting on December 8. In a case of disastrous timing, the attack on Pearl 
Harbor took place on December 7. After league officials expressed concerns 
that travel restrictions would be too stringent for a prospective Los Angeles-based 
team to be viable, the Browns' proposal was unanimously rejected.[3][4] 
During World War II, the Browns won their only American League pennant 
in St. Louis, in 1944. Some critics called it a fluke, as most major league 
stars voluntarily joined or were drafted into the military; however, many 
of the Browns' best players were classified 4-F: unfit for military service. 
They faced their local rivals, the incredibly successful Cardinals, in 
the 1944 World Series, the last World Series to date played entirely in 
one stadium. However, the Browns lost the series in six games. After the 
Series, Barnes sold the Browns to businessman Richard Muckerman. In 1945, 
the Browns posted an 81–75 record and fell to third place, six games out, 
again with less than top-ranked talent. The 1945 season may be best remembered 
for the Browns' signing of utility outfielder Pete Gray, the only one-armed 
major league position player in history. The 1945 season proved to be the 
Browns' last hurrah; they would never have another winning season in St. 
Louis. In fact, 1944 and 1945 were two of only eight winning seasons they 
enjoyed in the 31 years after nearly winning the pennant in 1922. Part 
of the problem was that Muckerman cared more about improving Sportsman's 
Park than improving the on-field product. He sold the team to DeWitt in 
1949, but DeWitt was unable to reverse the slide. At one point, DeWitt 
was forced to sell any good prospects to the Red Sox or Tigers in order 
to pay the bills. In 1951, Bill Veeck, the colorful former owner of the 
Cleveland Indians, purchased the Browns from DeWitt. In St. Louis, he extended 
the promotions and wild antics that had made him famous and loved by many 
and loathed by many others. His most notorious stunt in St. Louis came 
on August 19, 1951, when he ordered Browns manager, Zack Taylor to send 
Eddie Gaedel, a 3-foot 7-inch, 65-pound midget, to bat as a pinch hitter. 
When Gaedel stepped to the plate he was wearing a Browns uniform with the 
number 1⁄8. With no strike zone to speak of, Gaedel walked on four straight 
pitches, as he was ordered not to swing at any pitch. The stunt infuriated 
American League President Will Harridge, who voided Gaedel's contract the 
next day. Veeck also promoted another publicity stunt in which the Browns 
handed out placards – reading take, swing, bunt, etc. – to fans and allowed 
them to make managerial decisions for a day. Manager Zack Taylor dutifully 
surveyed the fans' advice and relayed the sign accordingly.[5] The Browns 
won the game. After the 1951 season, Veeck made Ned Garver the highest-paid 
member of the Browns. Garver went on to win 20 games, while the team lost 
100 games. He was the second pitcher in history to accomplish the feat. 
Veeck also brought Satchel Paige back to major league baseball to pitch 
for the Browns. Veeck had previously signed the former Negro League great 
to a contract in Cleveland in 1948 at age 42, amid much criticism. At 45, 
Paige's re-appearance in a Browns uniform did nothing to win Veeck friends 
among baseball's owners. Nonetheless, Paige ended the season with a respectable 
3–4 record and a 4.79 ERA. Veeck believed that St. Louis was too small 
for two franchises and planned to drive the Cardinals out of town. He signed 
many of the Cardinals' most popular ex-players and, as a result, attracted 
many Cards fans to see the Browns. Notably, Veeck inked former Cardinals 
great Dizzy Dean to a broadcasting contract and tapped Rogers Hornsby as 
manager. He also re-acquired former Browns fan favorite Vern Stephens and 
signed former Cardinals pitcher Harry Brecheen, both of whom had starred 
in the all-St. Louis World Series in 1944. Veeck also stripped Sportsman's 
Park of all Cardinals material and dressed it exclusively in Browns memorabilia, 
even moving his family to an apartment under the stands. The Browns never 
came close to fielding a winning team during this time; in Veeck's three 
years as owner, they never finished any closer than 31 games out of first, 
and even lost 100 games twice. Nonetheless, Veeck's showmanship and colorful 
promotions made attendance at Browns games more fun and unpredictable than 
the conservative Cardinals were willing to offer. Veeck's all-out assault 
on the Cardinals came during a downturn in the Cardinals' fortunes after 
Rickey left them for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942. Veeck appeared to have 
won the battle when Cardinals' owner Fred Saigh was convicted of massive 
tax evasion late in 1952 and forced to sell his team. For a time, it looked 
almost certain that the Cardinals were leaving town, as most of the credible 
bids came from non-St. Louis interests. However, just when it looked like 
the Cardinals were about to move to Houston, Texas, Saigh accepted a much 
lower bid from St. Louis-based brewery Anheuser-Busch. Brewery president 
Gussie Busch jumped into the bidding specifically to keep the Cardinals 
in St. Louis. Veeck quickly realized that he was finished in St. Louis. 
He knew that with Anheuser-Busch's wealth behind them, the Cardinals now 
had more resources than he could ever hope to match. Unlike his fellow 
owners, he had no income apart from the Browns. Reluctantly, he ceded St. 
Louis to the Cardinals and decided to move the Browns. As a first step, 
he sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals. He probably would have had to 
sell the park in any event. The 44-year-old park had fallen into disrepair, 
and Veeck could not afford to bring it up to code even with the rent from 
the Cardinals. Veeck attempted to move the Browns back to Milwaukee (where 
he had owned the Brewers of the American Association in the 1940s), but 
the move was blocked by the other American League owners, seemingly for 
reasons that were more personal than business-related. Undaunted, Veeck 
got in touch with Baltimore Mayor Tommy D'Alesandro and attorney Clarence 
Miles, who were leading an effort to bring the major leagues back to Baltimore 
after a half-century hiatus. However, he was rebuffed by the owners, still 
seething by the publicity stunts he pulled at the Browns home games. Although 
there was never any official word that the 1953 season would be the Browns' 
last in St. Louis, there were enough unofficial signs that attendance flatlined 
to only 3,860 fans per game. Under the circumstances, the Browns made a 
wretched showing, finishing 54-100, 46 games out of first. This was partly 
because late in the season, the Browns were running so low on baseballs 
that they were forced to ration them during batting practice. When what 
would be the Browns' last game in St. Louis—a 2-1 loss to the White Sox—went 
into extra innings, the Browns had so few baseballs on hand that the umpires 
were forced to recycle the least damaged ones that had previously been 
used. Reportedly, the last ball used was gashed from seam to seam.[6] After 
the season, Veeck cut a deal with Miles which would see the Browns move 
to Baltimore. Under the plan, Veeck would have remained as principal owner, 
but he would have sold half of his 80% stake to a group of Baltimore investors 
headed by Miles. Despite being assured by American League president Will 
Harridge that there would be no problem getting approval, only four owners 
voted aye – two short of passage. Reportedly, this was due to Yankees co-owner 
Del Webb drumming up support to move the Browns to Los Angeles. Veeck, 
Miles and D'Alesandro realized that the owners were simply looking for 
a way to push Veeck out. Over the next 48 hours, Miles lined up enough 
support from his group of investors to buy out Veeck's entire stake for 
$2.5 million. Veeck had little choice but to agree. He was facing threats 
of having his franchise canceled, and he'd given up his only leverage by 
selling Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals. The other owners duly approved 
the sale. While Baltimore brewer Jerold Hoffberger became the largest shareholder, 
it was Miles who was named president and chairman of the board. His first 
act was to request permission to move the team to Baltimore, which was 
swiftly approved. Unlike other clubs that relocated in the 1950s, retaining 
their nickname and a sense of continuity with their past (such as the Brooklyn/Los 
Angeles Dodgers, New York/San Francisco Giants, Boston/Milwaukee/Atlanta 
Braves, and Philadelphia/Kansas City/Oakland Athletics), the St. Louis 
Browns were renamed the Baltimore Orioles upon their transfer, implicitly 
distancing themselves at least somewhat from their history. It was also 
unique in that, unlike the other teams, the Browns/Orioles moved eastward 
instead of westward geographically. In December 1954, the Orioles further 
distanced themselves from their Browns past when General Manager, Paul 
Richards made a 17-player trade with the New York Yankees that included 
most former Browns of note still on the Baltimore roster.[7] It remains 
the biggest trade in baseball history.[7] Though the deal did little to 
improve the short-term competitiveness of the club, it helped establish 
a fresh identity for the Orioles franchise. To this day, the Orioles make 
almost no mention of their past as the Browns. The Orioles finally cut 
the last ties to the Browns era in August 1979, when new owner Edward Bennett 
Williams bought back the shares Barnes had sold to the public in 1936, 
making the franchise privately held once again. Although the buyout price 
is not known, it is assumed that given the Orioles' prosperity over their 
then 25 years in Baltimore, the owners made a handsome return on their 
investment. Since leaving St. Louis, the Orioles have returned to St. Louis 
once: for an interleague series with the Cardinals in 2003. The Cardinals 
took two games out of three from Baltimore. The Browns, along with the 
Washington Senators, were mostly associated with losing, as both franchises 
seemed to be the American League's perennial doormats. The Senators became 
the butt of a well-known vaudeville joke, "First in war, first in peace, 
and last in the American League" (a twist on the famous "Light Horse Harry" 
Lee eulogy for George Washington: "First in war, first in peace and first 
in the hearts of his countrymen"). A spin-off joke was coined for the Browns: 
"First in shoes, first in booze, and last in the American League." (On 
October 2, 1944, cartoonist Amadee drew the St. Louis Weatherbird in a 
Browns uniform, standing on its head, with the legend "And first in the 
American League!") [8] In the movie "Going My Way", Bing Crosby wears a 
sweat shirt with St. Louis Browns across it and takes the 'boys' to see 
them play. Many older fans in St. Louis remember the Browns fondly, and 
some have formed societies to keep the memory of the team alive; it is 
not uncommon to see sporting goods stores in the St. Louis area stock Browns 
shirts and hats.[citation needed] The former in-town rival Cardinals honor 
George Sisler with a statue outside Busch Stadium, and generally take up 
the responsibility for honoring the Browns. Believed to be the oldest former 
major leaguer at the time, and the last living pitcher to have faced Babe 
Ruth, the Browns' Rollie Stiles, 100, died July 22, 2007, in St. Louis 
County.[9] Ironically and coincidentally, another team named the Browns 
would relocate to Baltimore and abandon its previous identity four decades 
later: in 1996, professional football's Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore,
