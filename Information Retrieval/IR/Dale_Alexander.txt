David Dale Alexander (April 26, 1903 – March 2, 1979), nicknamed "Moose",[1] 
was an American baseball player and manager. A native of Greeneville, Tennessee, 
Alexander played professional baseball, principally as a first baseman, 
for 20 years from 1923 to 1942, including five years in Major League Baseball 
with the Detroit Tigers (1929–1932) and Boston Red Sox (1932–1933). At 
six feet, three inches and 210 pounds, he was one of the American League's 
best hitters from 1929 to 1932. He led the American League with 215 hits 
as a rookie in 1929, totaled 272 RBIs in his first two major league seasons, 
and won the major league batting title in 1932 with a .367 batting average. 
In five major league seasons, he compiled a .331 batting average with 811 
hits and 459 RBIs. In May 1933, Alexander sustained third degree burns 
on his leg and later developed gangrene after being given diathermy treatment 
for a twisted knee. The burns and infection limited his mobility and effectively 
ended his major league career. He continued to play in the minor leagues 
until 1942, compiling a .334 batting average with 2,145 hits and 1,171 
RBIs in minor league play. He also served as a minor league manager for 
the Sanford Lookouts (1939), Thomasville Tourists (1940), Selma Cloverleafs 
(1941), Greeneville Burley Cubs (1942), Knoxville Smokies (1946–1948), 
and Jacksonville Tars (1950). He also served as a scout for the New York 
Giants and Milwaukee Braves in the 1950s and 1960s. Alexander was born 
in Greeneville, Tennessee, in 1903.[1] He was raised on a family farm that 
had been in his family since the 18th century.[2] He attended Milligan 
College where he was an outstanding end and punter on the school's football 
team.[3] He also played basketball and baseball at Milligan and later played 
baseball for Tusculum College.[2] Alexander began playing professional 
baseball for his hometown team, the Greeneville Burley Cubs of the Appalachian 
League, in 1923 and 1924. In 1924, he compiled a .332 batting average with 
28 doubles and 10 triples in 114 games.[4] He moved on to the Charlotte 
Hornets of the South Atlantic League, batting .331 in 1925 and .323 in 
1926.[4] Alexander next played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International 
League. In 1927, he compiled a .338 batting average with 26 doubles, 11 
triples and 12 home runs and 97 RBIs.[4] The next year, he won the International 
League triple crown with a .380 batting average, 31 home runs, and 144 
runs batted in.[5] After his 1929 season, expectations for Alexander were 
high, with some writers comparing him to Babe Ruth.[6] On December 5, 1928, 
the Detroit Tigers purchased Alexander and pitcher Augie Prudhomme from 
Toronto for $100,000 cash and three players to be named later.[7] In 1929, 
Alexander won the first base job with the Tigers, starting 155 games at 
the position. He compiled a .343 batting average, scored 110 runs, and 
led the American League with 215 hits. He also ranked among the American 
League leaders with 83 extra base hits (second), 363 total bases (second), 
137 RBIs (third), 25 home runs (fifth), a .580 slugging percentage (fifth), 
43 doubles (fifth), and 15 triples (fourth).[1] After a tremendous rookie 
season, comparisons to Babe Ruth continued with one writer even dubbing 
him the "Prince of Swat".[3][8][9] In 1930, Alexander started 154 games 
at first base for the Tigers and compiled a .326 batting average with 20 
home runs and 135 RBIs. In his first two major league seasons, Alexander 
had 272 RBIs.[1] The only player with more RBIs in his first two major 
league seasons was Joe DiMaggio in 1936 and 1937.[10] Alexander also had 
the longest hitting streak of the 1930 season, a 29-game streak in which 
he had 41 hits in 121 at bats.[11] In 1931, Alexander appeared in 135 games, 
including 125 games as the Tigers' starting first baseman and four as a 
starter in left field. He compiled a stunning .490 batting average in the 
first two weeks of the season.[12] He then had "a long layoff" in May and 
June after a spike injury became infected.[13][14] His batting average 
dipped to .325 by the end of the season. Though his numbers were less impressive 
than in his first two seasons with the club, he compiled a .325 batting 
average, a .401 on-base percentage, and 87 RBIs.[1] In 1932, Alexander 
lost his job as the Tigers' starting first baseman as Stinky Davis took 
over the post. During the first two months of the 1932 season, Alexander 
was used principally as a pinch-hitter and compiled a .250 average in 22 
plate appearances in 23 games.[1][15] On June 13, 1932, the Tigers traded 
Alexander with Roy Johnson to the Boston Red Sox, in exchange for Earl 
Webb, who had set a major league record with 67 doubles in 1931.[16] Webb 
hit only 19 doubles for the Tigers in 1932 and retired one year later.[17] 
Alexander won the American League batting crown with a .367 batting average 
in 1932.[1] He beat Jimmie Foxx by a mere three points, depriving Foxx 
of the triple crown.[18] Alexander is the only major league batting champion 
to be traded to another team in the same league during the season in which 
he won the title (in 1990, Willie McGee won the National League batting 
title despite being traded to the American League in late August).[citation 
needed] On August 6, 1932, Alexander broke up a no-hitter by Cleveland 
pitcher Wes Ferrell, who ended up with a one-hitter.[19] On May 30, 1933, 
Alexander twisted a knee in a game at Philadelphia. He was given diathermy 
treatment ("electrically induced heat" used for muscle relaxation) in the 
clubhouse by Red Sox trainer Doc Woods. Alexander's leg suffered third 
degree burns during the treatment, and gangrene eventually set in.[20][21] 
"It was a new method of treatment and not too much was known about it", 
Alexander said, years later. "I noticed my leg felt awfully hot. I ended 
up with third-degree burns and a gangrene infection and almost lost my 
leg. I was finished in the Majors... I couldn't run and I couldn't field 
and when I got hurt, that was the end."[20][22] Alexander attempted a comeback 
but injured his leg again in July 1933 and saw limited action for the rest 
of the season, mostly as a pinch hitter. Alexander wound up hitting .281 
in 1933 and played his last major league game on September 23, 1933, against 
the New York Yankees.[1] After 1933, Alexander's mobility and fielding 
suffered, but he was able to hit well enough to continue playing in the 
minor leagues, primarily as a first baseman, until 1942. Alexander's return 
to the minor leagues began in February 1934 when the Red Sox assigned him 
to the Jersey City Skeeters.[23] The following month, he signed a contract 
to play for the Newark Bears in the International League.[24] During the 
1934 season, he appeared in 134 games for Newark, principally as a first 
baseman, and hit .336 with 123 RBIs, 14 home runs, 35 doubles, and seven 
stolen bases.[4] On November 3, 1934, the Newark club sold Alexander to 
the Kansas City Blues of the American Association for a price that was 
reported to be "one of the highest ever paid by an American Association 
club."[25] He became the Blues' starting first baseman, appearing in 120 
games in 1935. He compiled a .358 batting average in 1935 and set a new 
American Association record by hitting four home runs in a game against 
Minneapolis on June 14, 1935.[4][26] In 1936, he appeared in 154 games 
for the Blues, including 153 at first base, and compiled a .315 batting 
average with 100 RBIs.[4] In December 1936, the Kansas City club sold Alexander 
to the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association.[27] During the 
1937 season, he appeared in 153 games for Nashville, 153 at first base, 
and compiled a .319 batting average with 109 RBIs.[4] On February 19, 1938, 
Alexander signed with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association.[28] 
He appeared in 140 games for Chattanooga, 137 at first base, and compiled 
a .309 batting average with 85 RBIs.[4] In February 1939, Alexander, at 
age 36, was hired as player-manager for the Sanford Lookouts in the Florida 
State League.[29] Alexander appeared in 98 games as a player, 96 as a first 
baseman, and compiled a .345 batting average with 80 RBIs and 14 stolen 
bases.[4] He had the highest batting average on the Sanford team and led 
the team to a 98–35 record and a Florida State League championship.[22] 
He then spent the 1940 season as a player-manager for the Thomasville Tourists 
in the Georgia-Florida League. He compiled a .388 batting average in 91 
games and 330 at bats for Thomasville.[4] In 1941, Alexander was hired 
as a player-manager for the Selma Cloverleafs of the Southeastern League.[30] 
He compiled a career-high .438 batting average in 56 games, principally 
as a pinch-hitter, for the Cloverleafs.[4] In 1942, he returned to the 
Greeneville Burley Cubs, the hometown team with which he began his career 
in 1923. He served as a player-manager for Greeneville during the 1942 
season. In his final season as a player, Alexander compiled a .158 batting 
average in 19 at bats.[4] During his minor league playing career, Alexander 
never hit under .300 until 1942, his final year as a professional baseball 
player. His minor league batting average was .334 with 2,145 hits and 1,171 
RBIs.[4] While serving as manager of the Greeneville club, he also ran 
an unsuccessful campaign to be elected as the sheriff of Greene County, 
Tennessee.[31][32][33] Alexander was not associated with professional baseball 
from 1943 to 1945, instead operating a tobacco farm in his hometown of 
Greeneville, Tennessee.[34] He returned to coaching with the Knoxville 
Smokies from 1946 to 1948.[4] He resigned his position with the Knoxville 
club on June 5, 1948.[35] After resigning from Knoxville and continuing 
through the 1949 season, Alexander served as a scout for the New York Giants 
covering the states of Kentucky and Tennessee.[35][36] He was assigned 
by the Giants in July 1948 to manage the Bristol Twins.[37] In June 1950, 
Alexander was hired to take over mid-season as the manager of the last-place 
Jacksonville Tars in the South Atlantic League.[4][38] After retiring as 
a manager in 1950, Alexander returned to his job as a scout for the New 
York Giants. He continued as a scout for the Giants for 13 years from 1951 
to 1962.[citation needed] He has been credited with signing infielder Ernie 
Bowman, a native of Johnson City, Tennessee, pitcher Jim Constable, a native 
of Jonesborough, Tennessee, first baseman Gail Harris, a native of Abingdon, 
Virginia, and pitcher Joe Shipley, a native of Morristown, Tennessee. He 
has also been credited with spotting Willie McCovey who grew up in Mobile, 
Alabama, and began playing in the Georgia State League.[2] In November 
1962, he was hired as a scout for the Milwaukee Braves with responsibility 
for Tennessee, northern Alabama, and southwestern Virginia.[39] In the 
winter between the 1931 and 1932 seasons, Alexander married Verna Hutton 
from his hometown of Greeneville, Tennessee.[40] He had two sons, Don and 
Steve, both of whom played baseball.[2] He was diagnosed with prostate 
cancer in 1970,[2] and died in 1979 at Greeneville, Tennessee, at age 75.[1]
