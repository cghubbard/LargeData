As player As coach As manager Ronald Jon Roenicke (/ˈrɛnᵻki/ REN-i-kee; 
born August 19, 1956) is an American former professional baseball player 
and manager. He is the current third base coach of the Los Angeles Angels. 
He was previously the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers and a coach for 
the Los Angeles Dodgers. He is also the younger brother of former Montreal 
Expos and Baltimore Orioles outfielder Gary Roenicke. He played in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Dodgers, Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, 
San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds. Roenicke 
attended Edgewood High School in West Covina, California and Mt. San Antonio 
College in Walnut, California. He was drafted four times (by the Oakland 
Athletics in 1974, the San Francisco Giants in 1975, the Detroit Tigers 
in 1976 and the Atlanta Braves in 1976) but declined to sign each time. 
He played college baseball at UCLA in 1977 where he hit .284 with 9 home 
runs and 40 RBIs.[1] In 1977 he was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers 
in the 1st round (17th overall), and decided to join the Dodgers organization. 
He spent time in the Dodgers' farm system until making his major league 
debut with the club on September 2, 1981, where he remained until released 
by the club in 1983. He signed with the Seattle Mariners in 1983 and played 
for the 1984 National League Champion San Diego Padres. He played in two 
games of the 1984 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, serving as an 
outfielder[2] and pinch runner.[3] Roenicke continued to bounce around 
the major leagues, playing as an outfielder for the San Francisco Giants 
(1985), Philadelphia Phillies (1986–87) and Cincinnati Reds (1988). In 
his playing career, he compiled a .238 batting average, 17 home runs and 
113 RBIs.[4] From 1992 to 1993, Roenicke served on the coaching staff of 
the Dodgers' major league team. He began his managerial career in 1994 
with the rookie-level Great Falls Dodgers, and was named California League 
Manager of the year as he led the single-A San Bernardino Spirit to a league 
title in 1995. He served as the hitting instructor for triple-A Albuquerque 
in 1996 before being named Manager of the Year for guiding the double-A 
San Antonio Missions to the Texas League Championship in 1997. He managed 
San Antonio until 1998 when Glenn Hoffman's elevation as the Dodgers' interim 
manager led to his return to Albuquerque, this time as manager. In 1999, 
Roenicke left the Dodgers organization after seven seasons to manage the 
triple-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, the Fresno Grizzlies. He 
led them to a 73–69 record, only one game behind the eventual league champion, 
Los Angeles Angels affiliate Salt Lake. Roenicke switched allegiances once 
again in 2000, joining the Angels organization as the third base coach 
for the major league club. After six seasons in that role, he was promoted 
to bench coach in 2006 after long-time bench coach Joe Maddon departed 
to manage the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. After a brawl between the Angels and 
the Texas Rangers on August 16, 2006 led to a four-game suspension for 
Angels skipper Mike Scioscia, Roenicke served as the club's acting manager. 
He compiled a 4–0 record during his tenure, leading the team to its first 
four-game sweep of the Seattle Mariners since 1986. He served his one-game 
suspension immediately afterwards. Roenicke was interviewed by the Milwaukee 
Brewers for their managerial opening in October 2010. He was a finalist 
along with Bob Melvin, Bobby Valentine, and Joey Cora. He was hired as 
Brewers manager on November 2, 2010.[5] Roenicke's first season as the 
Brewers manager was a resounding success as the Brewers finished the season 
96–66, the most wins in franchise history, and also won the National League 
Central Division title, the first divisional title for the team in 29 years. 
The Brewers went on to win the NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks but 
lost the NLCS to the St. Louis Cardinals. Roenicke is only the 4th manager 
in Brewers history to have a winning season in his first full season as 
manager, joining George Bamberger, Tom Trebelhorn, and Phil Garner. Roenicke 
is also only the 4th Brewers manager to make the playoffs and the only 
manager to make the playoffs while managing the team for a full season: 
Harvey Kuenn and Dale Sveum each took over for a fired manager during their 
playoff seasons, and Buck Rodgers managed the team during a season shortened 
by a players' strike. The Brewers' success in 2011 resulted in Roenicke 
finishing in second in NL Manager of the Year voting. Roenicke and the 
Brewers looked to try to capitalize on their success in 2012, but inconsistent 
play from several players caused the Brewers to scuffle for most of the 
season. However, the team was able to rebound and finish the season 83–79, 
the first time since 2008 that the Brewers had finished with back-to-back 
winning seasons. In 2014, the Brewers led the NL Central for much of the 
season, but collapsed in late August and September, resulting in an 82-80 
record and failure to make the postseason. On May 3, 2015, Roenicke was 
fired after a poor 7-18 start to the season.[6][7] On August 17, 2015, 
he was hired by the Dodgers to be their new third base coach.[8] After 
the season, he left the Dodgers for the Angels in a deal to be their third 
base coach on November 18. Roenicke's nephew, Josh Roenicke (son of Gary 
Roenicke), has also played in the major leagues while his son, Lance, has 
played and coached in the minor leagues. Roenicke's wife, Karen was a P.E.
