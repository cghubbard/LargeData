Caguas (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkaɣwas]), founded in 1775, is a city and 
municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Central Mountain Range of Puerto 
Rico, south of San Juan and Trujillo Alto, west of Gurabo and San Lorenzo, 
east of Aguas Buenas, Cidra, and Cayey. Caguas is located 20 miles (32 km) 
(twenty minutes to an hour by car) from San Juan and 40 miles (64 km) (an 
hour and a half by car; it may take longer because of mountainous area 
in between the two cities) from Ponce. It is known as El Valle del Turabo 
(Turabo Valley) or La Ciudad Criolla (The Creole City) and its name originates 
from the Taíno cacique Caguax. Caguas is both a principal city of the San 
Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area and the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo 
Combined Statistical Area.[2] Caguas was founded on January 1, 1775 as 
San Sebastián del Piñal de Caguax, later shortened and modernized to its 
current form. Caguax was a local Taíno chief and early convert to Christianity. 
Caguas' construction was finished in 1779, in 1820 it was declared a valley 
and in 1894 it became a city.[3] In 2002, Caguas was the site of the 2002 
USAF Hercules air disaster.[4] Caguas is located in the largest valley 
in Puerto Rico, the "Valle de Caguas" which it shares with Gurabo and part 
of Aguas Buenas. It is located approximately 30 minutes from the coastline 
both on the east (Humacao) and the north (San Juan), and is divided from 
the Gurabo portion of the valley by the river of the same name. It is east 
of Aguas Buenas and Cidra, north of Cayey, south of San Juan, and west 
of Gurabo and Trujillo Alto. It also shares borders with Guayama and Patillas 
via a five-point border, with Cayey and San Lorenzo. At this point there 
are two tall antennas which provide signal to Puerto Rico's principal TV 
stations such as WKAQ-TV and WAPA-TV. No road passes exactly at this point, 
and it can be approached nearby through Puerto Rico Highway 184. Being 
a valley, Caguas has the distinction of being relatively flat except near 
the borders with all the mentioned municipalities except Gurabo. The climate 
is classified as a Tropical monsoon climate, meaning the daily mean temperature 
from month to month is never less than 64.4 °F (18 °C), and there is a 
distinct wet and dry season. Rainfall is common in relative abundance throughout 
most of the year, although there is less rain than in the eastern coastal 
valleys. The land, however, is fertile and deep. The Criollos de Caguas 
baseball team is considered one of the greatest of all-time in all of Latin 
America, having won 16 national Puerto Rico titles and 3 Caribbean World 
Series titles The team is a member of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de 
Puerto Rico (LBPPR). Three of the first five Puerto Ricans that played 
Major League Baseball in the U.S., at one point in their careers played 
for the Criollos de Caguas (Luis Rodríguez Olmo, Victor Pellot Power, Roberto 
Clemente). The Criollos de Caguas basketball team, founded in 1968 by Dr. 
Héctor "Tato" Dávila and Lcdo. Libertario Pérez Rodríguez, hasn't enjoyed 
as much success as their baseball counterparts. However in the early 2000s, 
they showed a lot of progress by reaching the national playoffs various 
times. The team is a member of the BSN. In 2006, the team won its first 
BSN national basketball championship, defeating Flor Melendez and his Santurce 
Crabbers in five games. Caguas is home to the Bairoa Gym, one of the most 
important boxing gyms in all Puerto Rico and a place where many visiting 
champions have trained at; such as boxing Welterweight Champion Miguel 
Cotto, his brother Jose Miguel, Alberto Mercado, Juan Carazo, Alfredo Escalera 
and others. The Criollas de Caguas women's volleyball team has won 9 national 
Puerto Rico titles and has made it to the finals more than 15 times. The 
team is a member of the Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino (LVSF). In September 
2005 City Mayor William Miranda Marin levied the first Municipal tax in 
Puerto Rico via city ordinance. Area Merchants now charge a one cent tax 
for every dollar spent on all retail businesses. The tax has become known 
around the island as the "Willie Tax." It resulted in an estimated $500,000 
monthly income for the city. However, the municipal tax was increased to 
1.5% after the establishment of the 5.5% state tax for a total of 7%.[citation 
needed] During 2006, Miranda Marin began calling Caguas "El Nuevo Pais 
de Caguas" ("The New Country of Caguas"). Its community has enjoyed one 
of the more robust economies amongst Puerto Rican cities since the 1980s. 
During the early part of the 20th century, Caguas hosted one of Puerto 
Rico's most important sugar manufacturers, which gave employment to thousands 
of Cagüeños. Numerous businesses and important buildings have opened in 
Caguas since the 1980s, including the imposing 23 story apartment building 
Caguas Tower, its adjacent competitors Bonneville Apartments, and the 10 
floor Menonita Hospital. There are also several shopping malls: Caguas 
is one of the largest municipalities with a population of 142,893 (increase 
of 1.7 percent).* Male Population in Caguas Barrio-pueblo, Puerto Rico:

in Puerto Rico are administered by a mayor, elected every four years. The 
mayor of the city of Caguas were 1953 to 1969 - Angel Rivera PPD 1969 to

city belongs to the Puerto Rico Senatorial district VII, which is represented 
by two Senators. In 2012, Jorge Suárez and José Luis Dalmau were elected 
as District Senators.[9] The colors blue and gold were chosen for the shield, 
distinctive of the city of Caguas. The figures symbolize both the indigenous 
and Christian origins of this city. The coat of arms consists of a shield 
with a blue field. Upon the field are two sets of three golden arrows, 
forming a cross of St. Andrew. Above the cross is a crown which represents 
Caguax, cacique of the Turabo Valley at the time of the arrival of the 
Spanish conquerors. Arrows were used as a remembrance of the first Christian 
place of worship established in the region which was dedicated under the 
patronage of St. Sebastian. There are pineapples interspersed to reflect 
the native agriculture. A castellated wall surmounts the shield to show 
the city's having been granted status as a municipality by the Spanish 
Crown. On the flag, the shield sits atop another blue field on which the 
cross of arrows is repeated. Public transportation in Caguas, as in most 
of Puerto Rico, is limited to small "guaguas públicas" (Mini Bus). There 
is service to and from San Juan and Rio Piedras, inexpensive but slow. 
Within Caguas, several buses and taxis serve the town. A "light interurban 
rail" system connecting Caguas to San Juan is in the planning stages, and 
will act as a feeder for the Tren Urbano. Caguas is served by one freeway, 
one tolled expressway and one main divided highway. Puerto Rico Highway 
30 connects Caguas to the east. There is no freeway/expressway to the west, 
due mainly to the fact that there is no sufficient population west of Caguas 
to develop a new freeway or expressway; good access to the municipalities 
of Cidra(southwest) and Aguas Buenas(northwest) are possible via PR-172 
and PR-156, respectively. Puerto Rico Highway 52 connects Caguas to the 
north (San Juan) and south (Cayey, Ponce). Puerto Rico Highway 1 is an 
alternate route to San Juan and Guaynabo with two lanes per direction; 
in south Caguas it becomes rural near Borinquen, therefore the only good 
access to Cayey is the expressway (PR-52) and a $1.00 toll has to be paid 
(only in the south direction). The only municipality bordering Caguas with 
a poor-access road is San Lorenzo, via PR-183; but good access to San Lorenzo 
is possible by entering Gurabo via PR-30, and then taking PR-203 south. 
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport is about 35 minutes away by car.
