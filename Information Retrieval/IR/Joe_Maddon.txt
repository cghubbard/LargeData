As player As manager As coach Joseph John "Joe" Maddon (born February 8, 
1954) is an American professional baseball manager who currently manages 
the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). Maddon began his coaching 
career in MLB with the California Angels in 1993 and served under managers 
Buck Rodgers, Marcel Lachemann, John McNamara, Terry Collins, and Mike 
Scioscia. He served two stints as interim manager during this time. He 
managed the Tampa Bay Rays from 2006 through 2014, winning the 2008 American 
League pennant. After opting out of his contract following the 2014 season, 
he joined the Cubs, led them to the 2015 National League Championship Series 
and was named the 2015 National League Manager of the Year. In 2016, Maddon 
managed the Cubs to their first World Series title since 1908, which they 
won against the Cleveland Indians. The son of an Italian father, Joe Sr. 
(who shortened the family name from Maddonini), and a Polish mother, Albina 
(Beanie), Maddon grew up in an apartment over his father's plumbing shop. 
His father died in 2002. His mother is still a waitress at the Third Base 
Luncheonette restaurant in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.[1] Maddon attended Lafayette 
College, where he played baseball and football. He graduated in 1976. He 
is a member of Zeta Psi fraternity. He received an Honorary Doctorate of 
Letters from Lafayette College on September 2, 2010.[2] Maddon played in 
Minor League Baseball as a catcher, having signed with the California Angels 
as a free agent in 1975,[3] but never advanced higher than Class A, which 
he played for four seasons. In his four seasons, he never had more than 
180 at bats in a season, and the most home runs he ever hit was three for 
the Salinas Angels in 1977.[4] He worked in the Angels organization for 
31 years, including time as a minor league manager, scout, roving minor 
league hitting instructor, and coach for the major league team.[citation 
needed] In 1979, after spending four seasons trying to make it as a catcher 
in the Angels organization, Maddon decided to give up his playing career 
and become a coach.[5] He started as a scout and would continue on to such 
positions as manager in the Angels farm system and Minor League roving 
hitting instructor.[6] As a minor league manager, he had a 279–339 record 
in six seasons.[3] He managed in the minors from 1981 to 1986, each team 
having a losing record. His stops included Idaho Falls, Idaho; Salem, Oregon; 
Peoria, Illinois and Midland, Texas. After serving as Minor League roving 
instructor from 1987 to 1993, Maddon was promoted to the big league club 
as a coach.[7] Maddon served as a Major League coach for the Angels from 
1994 to 2005. He held such positions as first base coach, bench coach, 
and interim manager on three occasions following the departures of John 
McNamara in 1996, the suspension of Terry Collins in 1998, and Collins' 
eventual departure in 1999. He finished with a combined record of 27 wins 
and 24 losses as interim manager.[8] He also served under Marcel Lachemann 
from 1993 to 1994. While he served as bench coach under McNamara and Collins, 
he rotated positions often. He finally found stability when the Angels 
hired Mike Scioscia in 1999. He served as Scioscia's bench coach from 2000 
to 2005, winning a 2002 World Series ring in 2002. By the time Maddon left 
Anaheim, he had spent 31 years overall with the Angels organization.[9] 
Maddon was considered a candidate for the Boston Red Sox manager job in 
2004, which went to Terry Francona.[10] On November 15, 2005, Maddon was 
hired to manage the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. His signature thick-rimmed glasses 
led to giveaways featuring mock pairs, and tributes from Angels players 
wearing the glasses when playing against the Rays. The Rays went 121-197 
in Maddon's first two seasons.[11] The Rays were in yet another re-building 
phase, this time under the management of General Manager Andrew Friedman. 
Tampa held the lowest payroll in baseball at $44 million. They had yet 
to have a winning season but were hopeful due to the development of young 
homegrown stars David Price, Evan Longoria, James Shields and BJ Upton. 
Unlike his predecessor, Lou Piniella, Maddon preached patience in developing 
a young core of players. Maddon was able to preach patience and tolerance 
while enduring back to back 90+ game losing seasons.[12] In 2008, Maddon 
guided the Rays to their first American League Eastern Division Title. 
He led a team of young players that won a division title over the heavily 
favored New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox.[citation needed] Maddon's 
team recorded the franchise's first playoff series victory in the 2008 
American League Division Series (ALDS) vs. the Chicago White Sox by 3–1 
and a 4-games-to-3 triumph over the rival Boston Red Sox in the 2008 American 
League Championship Series (ALCS). This was the first World Series appearance 
for the Rays, in which Tampa Bay held home-field advantage against the 
Philadelphia Phillies. The Phillies won the World Series in five games. 
Maddon won the American League Manager of the Year Award.[13] He also received 
the Chuck Tanner Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award.[14] On 
May 25, 2009, the Tampa Bay Rays and Maddon agreed to a contract extension 
that would keep him manager of the Rays through 2012. He had been in the 
final year of his initial contract when he first became manager of the 
team. The Rays stated that there was "never a question" on whether to keep 
Maddon after the conclusion of the 2009 season.[15] On July 14, 2009, Maddon 
managed the American League All Star team to a 4–3 victory. Controversy 
accompanied his failure to pick second baseman Ian Kinsler as a reserve, 
despite Kinsler having narrowly come in second in the fan voting, the player 
voting, and the "Sprint Final Vote" competition. To replace fellow second 
baseman Dustin Pedroia, Maddon instead chose Tampa Bay's first baseman 
Carlos Peña.[16][17][18][19][20][21] Similarly, to replace Longoria, Maddon 
chose Figgins of the Angels.[21] When MLB ordered in April 2010 that managers 
and coaches wear the official team jacket or approved Majestic pullover 
over their jersey, and not "hoodies", Maddon complained that "it's almost 
like a security blanket for me. Managing without a hoodie on a cool night 
could be very disconcerting. Furthermore, I think it's wrong."[22] MLB 
reversed their decision a few days later.[23] On September 28, 2010, the 
Rays clinched their second playoff berth in team history. This was their 
second playoff appearance in three years. They finished the year at 96-66.[24] 
The Rays won their second AL East championship, but lost to the Texas Rangers 
3-2 in the 2010 ALDS.[25] In 2011, the Rays made a second consecutive playoff 
appearance, clinching the American League Wild Card on the final day of 
the season, despite an 0–6 start to the season and a nine-game deficit 
in the wild card race in September. The Rays lost in the 2011 ALDS to the 
Rangers 3 games to 1. After the end of the season it was announced that 
Maddon had been named the AL Manager of the Year for the second time in 
his career.[26] On February 13, 2012 the Rays signed Maddon to a three-year 
extension.[27] On April 16, 2012, in a game against the Red Sox, Maddon 
won his 500th career game as manager.[28] The Rays finished the season 
at 90-72, good for third place in the AL East and third in the AL Wild 
Card.[citation needed] Maddon earned his 600th win on May 8, 2013, with 
a victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.[29] Maddon earned his 700th win on 
May 25, 2014 with a victory over the Boston Red Sox.[30] The Rays finished 
the season with a 92-71 record, clinching the American League Wild Card. 
They lost the 2013 ALDS to the Boston Red Sox, 3 games to 1.[31] The Rays 
finished with their worst record in seven years, at 77-85.[8] They lost 
Matt Moore to Tommy John surgery and dealt with constant trade rumors regarding 
such stars as David Price and Ben Zobrist. Price would end up being traded 
to the Detroit Tigers, while Zobrist finished the season in Tampa. The 
Rays dealt with a flurry of injuries, and never recovered. They were officially 
eliminated from postseason contention on September 19.[32] On October 14, 
2014, Rays' General Manager Andrew Friedman left Tampa Bay to assume the 
role of President of Baseball Operations for the Los Angeles Dodgers.[33] 
When Friedman departed, an opt-out clause in Maddon's contract was activated, 
stating that if Friedman left at any point in the duration of Maddon's 
contract, Maddon could opt out as well, as long as he did so within a period 
of two weeks. The Rays tried "aggresively" to re-sign Maddon, during that 
period, but Maddon opted out of his contract.[34] Maddon finished his tenure 
with a record of 754 wins and 705 losses.[8] Almost immediately after news 
broke of Maddon's departure in Tampa, rumors started linking him to the 
Chicago Cubs' managerial position; which, at the time was held by Rick 
Renteria. Cubs management had promised Renteria he would indeed be returning 
to manage the club in 2015 following the completion of the 2014 season.[35] 
On November 2, 2014, the Cubs announced that they had fired Renteria and 
hired Maddon.[36] While many around baseball thought the situation was 
controversial, Cubs President Theo Epstein asserted that the move was in 
the best interests of the organization. Renteria was offered a variety 
of other positions with the Cubs, which he declined.[37] After being fired 
by the Cubs, Renteria signed on as the Chicago White Sox bench coach for 
the 2016 season, and will manage that team in the 2017 season.[38] Almost 
immediately following Maddon's decision to sign with the Cubs, the Rays 
filed tampering charges with MLB. They claimed that the only reason Maddon 
opted out in Tampa was due to his becoming aware that the Cubs would offer 
him a deal that would make him the highest paid manager in the game. Cubs 
President Theo Epstein claimed that he had sent an e-mail to MLB to be 
certain that Maddon was indeed a free agent before contacting him about 
their managerial position.[39] On April 29, 2015, MLB cleared the Cubs 
of any tampering charges.[40] On May 14, Maddon logged his 800th managerial 
win in a 6–5 home victory over the New York Mets, placing him eighth among 
active managers.[41] In June, on a road trip to play the Mets, Maddon brought 
in a magician to perform in the Cubs clubhouse. The Cubs had lost five 
straight games and it was something Maddon had done before with the Rays.[42] 
At the conclusion of the first half of the season, the Cubs held a record 
of 47-40, good for third place in the highly contested National League 
Central division. The Cubs had finished in last place for three consecutive 
seasons.[43] After coming out sluggishly after the All Star Break, Cole 
Hamels of the Philadelphia Phillies no-hit the Cubs at Wrigley Field on 
July 25.[44] Following a sweep by the Phillies, the team with the worst 
record in baseball, the Cubs went on a nine-game winning streak, and at 
the time held the best road record in the Majors.[45] The Cubs continued 
their hot streak throughout the second half of the season, which included 
a no-hitter by Jake Arrieta on August 30 in Los Angeles.[46] On September 
26, following a San Francisco Giants loss to the Oakland Athletics, the 
Cubs clinched their first postseason berth since 2008.[47] They finished 
the season with 97 wins, a improvement of 24 over 2014 and their first 
97-win season since 2008.[48] In the National League Wild Card Game, the 
Cubs defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates by a score of 4–0 at PNC Park on a 
complete game shutout from Arrieta, advancing to the National League Division 
Series (NLDS) to face the St. Louis Cardinals. The win marked the Cubs' 
first postseason victory since the 2003 National League Championship Series 
(NLCS).[49] After losing game 1 in St. Louis, the Cubs went on to win three 
straight, winning the NLDS at Wrigley Field. This was the Cubs' first ever 
postseason clinch at Wrigley Field.[50] The Cubs played the Mets in the 
NLCS, but lost in four games.[51] After the season, Maddon won the National 
League Manager of the Year Award.[52] Maddon's young Cubs team entered 
the 2016 season as the odds-on favorite to win the World Series.[53] They 
started the season on a tear, taking over first place in the NL Central 
on April 11, a lead they never relinquished. By May 10 the Cubs had a record 
of 25-6 (0.806 win percentage) with a commanding 8.5 game lead in their 
division. The team would go on to post a 103-58 regular season record, 
their first 100-win season in over 80 years, and led their division by 
as many as 19 games. They entered the postseason as heavy favorites, and 
dispatched the Giants in 4 games with an amazing 4-run 9th inning comeback 
in the clincher at AT&T Park. On October 22, 2016, the Cubs beat the Los 
Angeles Dodgers in Game 6 of the NLCS, earning their first pennant since 
1945, also allowing Maddon to join the small list of managers who won pennants 
in both leagues. Their streak of not winning a pennant was the longest 
in MLB history, lasting 71 years. They beat the Cleveland Indians in a 
thrilling back-and-forth Game 7 of the World Series, for their first World 
Series title in 108 years. Maddon has two children, Sarah[54] and Joe from 
his first marriage to Betty Maddon. He and his second wife Jaye Sousoures[55] 
married in 2008. Maddon wears the unusual uniform #70. He has said that 
his preferred number used to be #20, but that he lost that number when 
future Hall-of-Famer Don Sutton came to the Angels. He was then randomly 
assigned #70 and declared that he would never change it so that his number
