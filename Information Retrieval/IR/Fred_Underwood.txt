Frederick Theodore Underwood (October 14, 1868 – January 26, 1906) was 
a Major League Baseball pitcher during part of the 1894 season. He was 
a native of St. Louis County, Missouri. Underwood appeared in seven games 
for the Brooklyn Grooms of the National League, starting six of them and 
completing five. He gave up 110 baserunners (80 hits and 30 walks) in just 
47 innings. He also gave up 62 runs, but only 41 of them were earned runs. 
Despite his struggles he did win two games for Brooklyn...July 21 against 
the Philadelphia Phillies (8-7) and July 28 against the Washington Senators 
(9-5). He was more successful with the bat, as he went 7-for-18 for a batting 
average of .389. In his short MLB career he was 2–4 with 10 strikeouts 
and an ERA of 7.85. Underwood died at the age of 37 in Kansas City, Missouri.
