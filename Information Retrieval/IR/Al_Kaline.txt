Albert William "Al" Kaline (/ˈkeɪlaɪn/; born December 19, 1934), nicknamed 
"Mr. Tiger", is an American former Major League Baseball right fielder. 
He is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.[1][2] Kaline played his entire 
22-year baseball career with the Detroit Tigers.[1] For most of his career, 
Kaline played in the outfield, mainly as a right fielder where he won ten 
Gold Gloves and was known for his strong throwing arm.[3] He was selected 
to 18 All-Star Games and was selected as an All-Star each year between 
1955 and 1967. Near the end of his career, Kaline also played as first 
baseman and, in his last season, was the Tigers' designated hitter. He 
retired not long after reaching the 3,000 hit milestone. Immediately after 
retiring from playing, he became the Tigers' TV color commentator, a position 
he held until 2002. Kaline still works for the Tigers as a front office 
official.[4] Kaline was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. His family 
was poor. Several relatives played semi-pro baseball, but no one in his 
family had graduated from high school. When he was eight years old, Kaline 
developed osteomyelitis and had a segment of bone removed from his left 
foot. The surgery left him with scarring and permanent deformity, but he 
was an outstanding pitcher in youth baseball.[5] Kaline had learned to 
throw a fastball, changeup and curveball by the age of nine.[6] He attended 
Baltimore's Southern High School, where he starred in basketball and also 
played football until he sustained a cheek injury. When he tried out for 
the baseball team, there was no room on the pitching staff so Kaline moved 
to the outfield.[6] He earned all-state honors in baseball all four years.[5] 
Kaline said that he was a poor student but that he was well liked by his 
teachers. He said that his teachers passed him and that they believed he 
would become a baseball player.[7] Kaline bypassed the minor league system 
and joined the Tigers directly from high school as an 18-year-old "bonus 
baby" signee, receiving $35,000 (equivalent to $310,081 in 2015),[8] to 
sign with the team.[9][10] He made his major league debut on June 25, 1953 
in Philadelphia as a late-inning replacement for outfielder Jim Delsing. 
Kaline wore number 25 during his rookie campaign, but asked teammate Pat 
Mullin for his No. 6 after the 1953 season ended. Kaline wore the number 
for the rest of his major league playing career.[11] He was known simply 
as "Six" in the Tiger clubhouse. In 1955, at age 20, Kaline ended the season 
with a .340 batting average, becoming the youngest player ever to win the 
American League batting title. No 20-year-old major league player had won 
a batting title since Ty Cobb in 1907. During the 1955 season, Kaline became 
the 13th man in major league history to hit two home runs in the same inning, 
became the youngest to hit three home runs in one game, and finished the 
year with 200 hits, 27 home runs and 102 RBIs.[1][12] He also finished 
second to Yogi Berra in the American League's 1955 Most Valuable Player 
Award voting.[13] He was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Star 
Game, the first in a string of consecutive All-Star selections that lasted 
through 1967.[1] Kaline followed in 1956 with a .314 batting average with 
27 home runs and 128 RBIs.[1] He led the league in outfield assists with 
18 in 1956[14] and again in 1958 with 23.[15] Kaline was out for several 
games in 1958 after he was hit by a pitch. He missed several games in 1959 
after he was hit by a thrown ball and sustained a fracture in his cheekbone. 
Kaline had been knocked out from the blow and initial speculation was that 
he could miss six weeks of the season.[16] In 1961, Kaline hit .324 to 
finish second in the AL batting race (behind teammate Norm Cash). The Tigers 
won 101 games, to date the third-highest win total in team history, but 
still finished eight games behind a New York Yankees team that was led 
by the home run heroics of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Kaline began 
the 1962 season hitting .345 with 13 HR and 38 RBI in 35 games. On May 
28 of that season, he sustained a broken collarbone while making a game-ending 
catch on a ball hit by New York's Elston Howard. He missed 57 games due 
to the injury and Detroit was unable to seriously compete for a pennant 
due to his absence.[17] By late March 1963, Kaline said that he felt good 
and he was hitting .373 in 53 spring training at-bats.[17] In the 1963 
regular season, Kaline hit .312 with 27 home runs and 101 RBI, finishing 
second to Howard in the American League's Most Valuable Player Award voting.[1][18] 
Kaline experienced pain in his left foot, the one that had been affected 
by osteomyelitis as a child, throughout the 1964 season. His batting average 
dropped to .293 that season. Kaline tried to ignore the pain, but he saw 
physicians who thought he was suffering from gout and administered injections.[19] 
Still in pain the following season, Kaline saw an orthopedic surgeon who 
prescribed corrective shoes. "I feel so much better than I did before, 
that it's ridiculous", Kaline said by June 1965.[19] Sportswriter Milton 
Gross described Kaline's deformed foot, saying, "The pinky and middle finger 
don't touch the ground. The fourth toe is stretched. The second and third 
are shortened. The first and third toes overlap the second and the fourth 
is beginning to overlap the big toe, which has begun to bend to the left. 
It is hard to believe, but for all of his career with the Tigers while 
he has been called the perfect player, Kaline has bordered on being a cripple."[19] 
In the summer of 1967, the normally calm Kaline broke a bone in his hand 
when he struck a baseball bat against a bat rack.[20] Kaline missed a month 
of play. When he returned, the Tigers were in a four-team pennant race, 
but the team finished a game out of first place.[21] Kaline missed two 
months of the 1968 season with a broken arm, but he returned to the lineup 
when Tiger manager Mayo Smith benched shortstop Ray Oyler and sent center 
fielder Mickey Stanley to play shortstop to make room for Kaline in the 
outfield.[22] ESPN later called Smith's move one of the ten greatest coaching 
decisions of the century.[23] In the 1968 World Series, the St. Louis Cardinals 
won three of the first four games of the series and were leading Game 5 
by a score of 3–2 in the seventh inning, when Kaline hit a bases loaded 
single to drive in two runs.[24] The Tigers won the next two games for 
their first world championship since 1945. In his only World Series appearance, 
Kaline hit .379 with two home runs and eight RBI in seven games.[25] For 
their victory, Kaline and his teammates each received bonus checks of $10,000 
(at a time when Kaline's salary was "about 70,000").[26] In 1970 Kaline 
was nearly a victim of a freak accident on the baseball field. On May 30, 
1970, in a game at Milwaukee's County Stadium, Kaline collided with center 
fielder Jim Northrup as they both pursued a flyball. Kaline fell to the 
warning track injured. Alertly, left fielder Willie Horton rushed over 
and quickly recognized that Kaline was turning blue. Horton reached in 
and cleared Kaline's airway, saving his life.[27] After hitting .294 in 
1971, Kaline became the first Tiger to sign a $100,000 contract. He had 
turned down a pay raise from $95,000 to $100,000 the previous year, saying 
he did not feel like he deserved it after hitting .278 with 21 home runs 
in 1970.[28] Detroit contended all season for the 1972 pennant, trailing 
the Red Sox by a half-game before a series against them to end the regular 
season.[29] Kaline batted eight times in two games, registering five hits 
and three runs scored.[30] Detroit won those first two games and clinched 
the AL East pennant.[31][32] They lost the ALCS to the Oakland Athletics 
that year after Reggie Jackson stole home in the final game of the series.[33] 
In March 1973, Kaline won the Roberto Clemente Award in recognition of 
the honor he brought to baseball on and off the field.[34] On September 
24, 1974, Kaline became the 12th player in MLB history to reach the 3000 
hit plateau, when he hit a double off the Orioles' Dave McNally.[35][36][37] 
After reaching the milestone, he announced that he would retire.[21] "I'm 
glad it's over. I really am. I don't think I'll miss it. I may miss spring 
training", Kaline said after his last game on October 3.[38] He finished 
his career with 3,007 hits (25th on the all-time list), 399 home runs (a 
Tigers record and 43rd on the all-time list) and 1583 RBIs.[1] He batted 
over .300 nine times in his career to finish with a lifetime batting average 
of .297, and while never considered a true power hitter, he hit 25 or more 
home runs seven times in his career.[1] Kaline was elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in 1980, becoming the tenth player in history to be inducted 
in his first year of eligibility.[2][39] Kaline was named on 340 of the 
385 ballots (88.3%) cast by sportswriters. Kaline and Duke Snider were 
the only candidates elected by the sportswriters in 1980. Kaline later 
said, "I really never thought I would choose an individual thing that happened 
just to me over a team thing like the World Series. But I would have to 
say this is the biggest thing that has ever happened to me.[40] Kaline 
was honored by the Tigers as the first of their players to have his uniform 
number (6) retired.[41] Versatile and well-rounded, he won ten Gold Glove 
Awards (1957–59 and 1961–67) for excellence in the field and appeared in 
the All-Star game for fifteen seasons (1955–67, 1971, 1974).[1][42] In 
1998, he ranked Number 76 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest 
Baseball Players,[43] and was nominated as a finalist for the Major League 
Baseball All-Century Team.[44][45] Cherry Street, which ran behind the 
left-field stands at Tiger Stadium, was renamed Kaline Drive in his honor.[22] 
Later that year, on September 27, 1999, when the team played its last game 
at Tiger Stadium against the Kansas City Royals, Kaline was invited to 
appear in uniform and present the last lineup card to the umpires. He did 
so along with George Brett, considered one of the greatest players ever 
for the Tigers' opponents that day. Kaline was regarded as a well-rounded 
player by his contemporaries. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson 
said of him, "There have been a lot of great defensive players. The fella 
who could do everything is Al Kaline. He was just the epitome of what a 
great outfielder is all about – great speed, catches the ball and throws 
the ball well."[2] Manager Billy Martin once said, "I have always referred 
to Al Kaline as 'Mister Perfection'. He does it all – hitting, fielding, 
running, throwing – and he does it with that extra touch of brilliancy 
that marks him as a super ballplayer... Al fits in anywhere, at any position 
in the lineup and any spot in the batting order."[46] After his playing 
career, Kaline lived in the Detroit area, and he has remained active within 
the Tigers organization, serving first as a color commentator on the team's 
television broadcasts (1975–2002) mostly with play by play announcer and 
former Tiger and fellow Hall of Famer George Kell, and then later as a 
consultant to the team.[22] Since 2003, Kaline has served as a special 
assistant to Tigers President/CEO/General Manager Dave Dombrowski,[22] 
and his duties include coaching/mentoring outfielders during spring training.[47] 
Former Tigers teammate Willie Horton also holds this position, and the 
two threw out the first pitch of the 2006 World Series at Comerica Park.[22] 
The 2016 campaign will mark Kaline's 64th season with the Tigers as a player, 
broadcaster and front-office official, one of the longest tenures with 
one MLB club of anyone in history. Because of his lengthy career and longtime 
association with the Tigers organization, Kaline's nickname is "Mr. Tiger."[48] 
Kaline's grandson Colin was selected by the Tigers in the 25th round of 
the 2007 MLB draft. He did not sign, choosing to play baseball at Florida 
Southern College.[49] The team drafted him again in the 2011 MLB draft, 
this time in the 26th round. He played in the low minor leagues with the 
Detroit organization in 2011-12.[50] Hawkins, Jim (2010). Al Kaline: The
