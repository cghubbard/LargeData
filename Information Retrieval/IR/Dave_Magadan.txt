As player As coach David Joseph Magadan (born September 30, 1962) is a 
Major League Baseball hitting coach. He retired as a MLB player after a 
16-year career as a solid-hitting first and third baseman. He is the cousin 
and godson of former manager, Lou Piniella. Magadan is 6'4" tall, weighs 
245Â lbs, batted from the left side, and threw from the right. While a student 
at Jesuit High School of Tampa, Magadan was drafted by the Boston Red Sox 
in the twelfth round of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft, but elected 
not to sign and remain in school. His status as a prospect improved after 
he led West Tampa Memorial Post No. 248 to a win against a team from Richmond, 
Virginia in the American Legion World Series and was named series Most 
Valuable Player. He also received the George W. Rulon American Legion Baseball 
Player of the Year award.[1] After high school, Magadan attended the University 
of Alabama, where, in 1983, his .525 batting average led the entire National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), while setting an SEC Southeastern 
Conference record, and is still the fifth best in NCAA history. After defeating 
Michigan and Arizona State University twice, Alabama lost to the University 
of Texas at Austin in the 1983 College World Series. Magadan was named 
the All-Tournament Team's first baseman. He also was selected as an AP 
All-American, was named the starting designated hitter on The Sporting 
News's college All-America team, received College Player of the Year honors 
from Baseball America and won USA Baseball's Golden Spikes Award as the 
best amateur baseball player. His .439 career batting average is the SEC 
record and tenth best in NCAA history. Following his breakthrough season 
at Alabama, Magadan was selected by the New York Mets with the 32nd overall 
pick of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, early in the second round. 
He was assigned to the South Atlantic League's Columbia Mets, with whom 
he batted .336 with three home runs. Magadan did not hit any home runs 
his next two seasons, and really didn't display much power as a prospect, 
but he consistently hit for a high batting average and displayed excellent 
plate discipline, with a low strikeout rate and twice as many walks as 
strikeouts. He advanced steadily through the system, and was a September 
call-up for the 1986 championship squad. He made his major league debut 
on September 7, 1986 pinch hitting for Kevin Elster, and hitting a double 
in his first major league at-bat.[2] He won the hearts of Mets fans in 
his first major league start on September 17, by hitting three singles, 
and reaching on an error in his four at-bats, and collecting two RBIs in 
the Mets' National League Eastern division clincher.[3] For the season, 
Magadan went eight for eighteen for a .444 batting average. Blocked at 
third base by Howard Johnson and at first by Keith Hernandez, Magadan still 
found his way into the lineup on a semi-regular basis in 1987 and 1988. 
He hit his first major league home run April 20, 1987 He provided a quality 
bat in late-inning situations and a capable spot starter whenever a regular 
needed a day off. Manager Davey Johnson even went so far as to move Johnson 
to shortstop for 30 games a year, just to get Magadan more playing time. 
Magadan became the Mets' regular first baseman in 1989 when injuries limited 
Hernandez to 75 games and a .233 batting average. Contrary to early reports 
of a mediocre glove, Magadan proved himself to be adequate at first, though 
certainly not in Hernandez' class. Hernandez's contract expired after the 
season, and the Mets opted not to offer him a contract for the 1990 season. 
However, instead of giving the starting job to Magadan, the Mets traded 
Juan Samuel to the Los Angeles Dodgers and received Mike Marshall in return, 
with the intent of starting him at first. Marshall batted only .239 for 
the Mets, and had lost his starting job to Magadan by the time he was dealt 
to the Boston Red Sox on July 27. Magadan batted .328, which ranked third 
in the league, and his .417 on-base percentage was good for second place. 
He also ranked eighth in walks and fifth in sacrifice flies, and even drew 
four points in MVP voting. Magadan entered the 1991 season as the starting 
first baseman for the Mets, but his numbers went down significantly. He 
only managed to bat .258 for the season, with 108 hits, and missed most 
of the last two months of the season with shoulder injuries. The Mets once 
again went outside the organization to bring in a first baseman in the 
off season and brought in Eddie Murray, another former Dodger and eventual 
Hall of Famer, to fill the role. This time, Magadan stayed in the lineup 
as he was moved to third base permanently while Howard Johnson was moved 
to the outfield. He was limited again by injuries to 99 games but managed 
a .283 average. Magadan signed with the expansion Florida Marlins on December 
8, 1992, and was in the starting line-up for their inaugural season opener, 
going one for four in the Marlins' 6-3 victory over the Dodgers on April 
5, 1993.[4] Before the midway point of the season, he was traded to the 
Seattle Mariners for Henry Cotto and Jeff Darwin. For the season Magadan's 
average was .273, as he recorded the most hits he'd had since his breakout 
1990 season with 124. He also stayed relatively healthy when compared to 
the previous two seasons, playing in 137 games. He also became part of 
a historic moment on September 22, 1993, as the Mariners played host to 
the Texas Rangers inside the Kingdome. In the first inning, with the Mariners 
leading 5-0, he stepped in against Nolan Ryan. While Magadan was batting, 
Ryan suffered a torn ligament in his pitching elbow and had to be removed 
from the game; as Ryan had already announced he would be retiring following 
the season, Magadan proved to be the last batter Ryan would ever face.[5] 
After the season the Mariners traded Magadan back to Florida in exchange 
for Jeff Darwin, one of the players they traded to acquire him. He played 
in only 74 games for the Marlins in 1994 and became a free agent after 
the season. Taking a pay cut, Magadan agreed to terms with the Houston 
Astros on a one-year deal for 1995. Magadan found himself once again with 
a starting job in Houston, batting .313 as their regular third baseman. 
Still, the Astros chose not to re-sign Magadan at the end of the 1995 season, 
choosing instead to acquire Sean Berry from the Montreal Expos to play 
third. Magadan signed with the Chicago Cubs in 1996. Injuries and a gold 
glove first baseman (Mark Grace) limited him to pinch hitting duties, and 
he batted only .254 used sparingly by manager Jim Riggleman. After 1996, 
he signed a one-year deal with the Oakland Athletics at the end of the 
season, and made 328 plate appearances in 1997, splitting his time fairly 
evenly between first, third and designated hitter. He batted .303 with 
four home runs, and re-signed with the A's at the end of the season. While 
Magadan received far less playing time in 1998, he still emerged with a 
.321 batting average. Magadan signed with the San Diego Padres in 1999 
to back up first and third base. He made his first career appearance as 
a shortstop for the Padres in 2000, and in 2001, he made his only appearance 
at second base. Magadan had a career .994 fielding percentage at first 
base and .951 at third. After his retirement as a player, Magadan was hired 
by the Padres as their minor league hitting instructor in 2002, and served 
as their major league batting coach from 2003 to 2006. On June 15, 2006, 
with the Padres batting .252 as a team (last in the National League), Magadan 
was fired by Padres GM Kevin Towers and replaced by former Padres hitting 
coach Merv Rettenmund. Their .322 in on-base percentage and .391 slugging 
percentage was second to last to the Chicago Cubs.[6] On October 20, 2006, 
Magadan was named hitting coach for the Boston Red Sox.[7] In his first 
season on the job, Magadan's Red Sox would go on to see great improvements 
in batting average (.269 to .279), slugging percentage (.435 to .444) and 
on-base percentage (.351 to .362), and led the American League with 689 
walks. In 2007, Boston would finally end their archrival New York Yankees' 
nine-year run as American League Eastern division champions, and went on 
to sweep the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series. The team batted 
.333 in the World Series. The Red Sox were among the league leaders in 
all batting categories again in 2008, leading the major leagues with a 
.358 on-base percentage and 646 walks, and ranking second in the American 
League in batting average (.280), runs (845), doubles (353), RBIs (807) 
and total bases (2,503), and finishing third in slugging percentage (.447). 
Magadan was suspended for one game on June 26, 2009 for arguing balls and 
strikes with home plate umpire Bob Davidson on June 24.[8] While still 
making the post season as a wild card, the Red Sox saw a substantial dip 
in all categories in 2009, and were eliminated in the first round of the 
playoffs against the Los Angeles Angels. On October 19, 2012, Magadan was 
named hitting coach for the Texas Rangers.[9] He left the team after the 
2015 season. On November 25, 2015, Magadan was hired as the hitting coach
