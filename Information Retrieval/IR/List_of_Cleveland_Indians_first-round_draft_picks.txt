The Cleveland Indians are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in Cleveland, Ohio. They play in the American League Central division. 
Since the institution of MLB's Rule 4 Draft, the Indians have selected 
66 players in the first round. Officially known as the "First-Year Player 
Draft",[2] the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning amateur 
baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball 
clubs to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous 
season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving 
the first pick.[2] In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous 
off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks.[3] Of the 
58 players picked in the first round by Cleveland, 25 have been pitchers, 
the most of any position; 16 of them were right-handed, while 9 were left-handed. 
Eleven outfielders, ten shortstops, four third basemen, four first basemen, 
three catchers, and one second basemen were also taken. The team also drafted 
one player, Glenn Tufts (1973), who played as an infielder.[4] Twelve of 
the players came from high schools or universities in the state of California, 
and Texas follows with eight players. The Indians have also drafted two 
players from their home state of Ohio.[4] None of the Indians' first-round 
picks have won a World Series championship with the team, and no pick has 
been elected to the Hall of Fame. None of these picks have won the MLB 
Rookie of the Year award, although Manny Ramirez (1991) placed second in 
the voting in 1994.[5] CC Sabathia (1998) is the only first-round pick 
of the Indians to earn a Cy Young Award with the team, winning in 2007.[6] 
The Indians have never held the first overall pick in the draft, but have 
selected players with the second overall pick five times.[4] The Indians 
have made 11 selections in the supplemental round of the draft and 15 compensatory 
picks since the institution of the First-Year Player Draft in 1965.[4] 
These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable 
free agent in the previous off-season,[3][7][V] or, more recently, if a 
team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.[8] The Indians 
have failed to sign three of their first-round picks: John Curtis (1966), 
Calvin Murray (1989), and Alan Horne (2001). The Indians received no compensation 
for failing to sign Curtis, but received the 39th pick in 1990 and the 
41st pick in 2002 for failing to sign Murray and Horne, respectively.[4]
