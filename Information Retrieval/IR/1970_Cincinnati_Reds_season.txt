The 1970 Cincinnati Reds season consisted of the Reds winning the National 
League West title with a record of 102-60, 14½ games ahead of the runner-up 
Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in three 
straight games in the 1970 National League Championship Series to win their 
first National League pennant since 1961. The team then lost to the Baltimore 
Orioles in the 1970 World Series in five games. The Reds were managed by 
first-year manager George "Sparky" Anderson and played their home games 
at Crosley Field during the first part of the year, before moving into 
the then-new Riverfront Stadium on June 30. Buoyed by a lineup that included 
third baseman Tony Pérez, NL MVP catcher Johnny Bench, right fielder Pete 
Rose, center fielder Bobby Tolan and first baseman Lee May, the Reds got 
off to a 70-30 start. The Reds, who had been near the bottom of the NL 
in pitching in 1969, were aided by a young staff that included 18-game 
winner Gary Nolan (22), rookies Wayne Simpson (21) and Don Gullett (19), 
20-game winner Jim Merritt (26) and record-setting reliever Wayne Granger, 
who appeared in a then-record 90 games in 1969.[8] Simpson, a hard-throwing 
former first-round draft pick, started the season 9-1 and earned an all-star 
berth. He was 14-3 before he suffered a season-ending arm injury with 30 
games left.[citation needed] Riverfront Stadium was opened in 1970, and 
it was the home of the Cincinnati Reds National League baseball team and 
the Cincinnati Bengals National Football League team. Located on the Ohio 
River in downtown Cincinnati, the stadium was best known as the home of 
"The Big Red Machine", as the Reds were often called in the 1970s. Construction 
began on February 1, 1968 and was completed at a cost of less than $50 
million. On June 30, 1970, the Reds hosted the Atlanta Braves in their 
grand opening, with Hank Aaron hitting the first ever home run at Riverfront. 
Two weeks later on July 14, Riverfront hosted the 1970 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game. This game is most remembered for the often-replayed collision 
at home plate between the home-grown Pete Rose and catcher Ray Fosse of 
the Cleveland Indians. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games

win came in Game 4 on a Lee May 3-run home run in the eighth inning. 1970
