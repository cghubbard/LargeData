Ernesto Natali "Ernie" Lombardi (April 6, 1908 – September 26, 1977), was 
an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the Brooklyn Robins, the Cincinnati Reds, 
the Boston Braves, and the New York Giants during a career that spanned 
17 years, from 1931 through 1947. He had several nicknames, including "Schnozz", 
"Lumbago", "Bocci", "The Cyrano of the Iron Mask" and "Lom". He was inducted 
into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. Baseball writer Bill James 
called Lombardi "the slowest man to ever play major league baseball well." 
The fact that he was so slow spoke to what an outstanding hitter he was. 
Lombardi was an All-Star for seven seasons,[a] he hit over .300 for ten 
seasons and finished his major league career with a .306 batting average 
despite infields playing very deep for the sloth-like baserunner. He is 
listed at 6'3" and 230 lbs, but he probably approached 300 lbs towards 
the end of his career. He was also known as a gentle giant and this made 
him hugely popular among Cincinnati fans.[1] Lombardi grew up in Oakland. 
He attended McClymonds High School, the same school from which baseball 
star Frank Robinson and basketball star Bill Russell later graduated.[2] 
Lombardi started his professional baseball career for his hometown Oakland 
Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. He hit well (over .350 with power in 
1929 and 1930) and had a strong arm. His talents were soon noticed by the 
Brooklyn Robins, who purchased his contract for $50,000. Lombardi played 
his rookie season for the Robins in 1931 and played well (batting .297). 
Brooklyn had too many quality catchers at the time and Robins manager Wilbert 
Robinson contemplated using the strong-armed Lombardi as a pitcher. He 
was traded to the Cincinnati Reds shortly before the start of spring training 
for the 1932 season. Lombardi flourished in his first year for Cincinnati, 
batting .303 with 11 home runs and 68 runs batted in. In 1935, he hit .343, 
but was not selected as an All-Star until 1936, when he hit .333 that season. 
In 1937, he hit .334 and made the All-Star team that season. In 1938, he 
was selected as an All-Star again, and hit a league-leading .342 with 19 
home runs, drove in 95 runs, and won the National League (NL) Most Valuable 
Player Award award. Lombardi became one of the Reds' most productive and 
popular players. He was the catcher for left-hander Johnny Vander Meer's 
back-to-back no-hitters, accomplished on June 11 and June 15, 1938. Vander 
Meer's feat has never been matched. Lombardi was an All-Star the next two 
seasons, his hitting skills and leadership helped the Reds to the National 
League pennant in 1939 and 1940, and the World Series title in 1940. While 
Lombardi played for the Reds as the starting catcher, three-year teammate 
and backup catcher Willard Hershberger became the only major league player 
to commit suicide during a season. Hershberger who had been having difficulties 
playing as a replacement for an injured Lombardi for a few games in 1940, 
told manager Bill McKechnie in private that "my father killed himself, 
and I'm going to do it, too!" After failing to appear at the stadium the 
next day, the Reds checked Hershberger's room at the hotel on August 3 
only to find that he had slit his throat and wrist. In 1942, the Boston 
Braves (NL team) purchased Lombardi's contract, and he went on to become 
an All-Star and led the NL and Braves that season with a .330 batting average 
(albeit, in only 309 at-bats); the next batting title to be won by a catcher 
came more than 60 years later when Joe Mauer won the AL batting title in 
2006. As of 2015, Lombardi remains only one of two NL catchers ever to 
win a batting title. His final All-Star selection was during the 1943 season 
(MLB cancelled the 1945 All-Star Game and no All-Stars were named that 
season[3]), before Boston opted to trade him to the New York Giants before 
the 1944 season began. He enjoyed three productive if unspectacular seasons 
with the Giants before seeing his playing time diminish over the next two 
seasons. Lombardi retired from the major leagues after the 1947 season, 
having compiled a .306 career batting average, 190 home runs, 990 RBI, 
601 runs and 430 walks. The six foot, three inch, 230-pound Lombardi was 
legendarily slow-footed, and during the course of his major league career 
he grounded into 261 double plays. Aside from being the yearly leader in 
grounding into double plays on 4 occasions, he holds the MLB record for 
grounding into a double play in every 25.3 plate appearances. An opposing 
manager once jokingly said that Lombardi was so slow, he ran like he was 
carrying a piano — and the man who was tuning it. Defenses would often 
position all four infielders in the outfield when Lombardi came to the 
plate. Despite this, he became an outstanding catcher on the basis of his 
strong, accurate arm and his ability to "call" a game. Lombardi finished 
his professional career in the minor leagues for the Oakland Oaks, a championship 
team in 1948. During the fourth game of the 1939 World Series, in the 10th 
inning, with the score tied and runners on first and third, Joe DiMaggio 
singled. One run scored, then Reds outfielder Ival Goodman fumbled the 
ball. Yankees right fielder Charlie "King Kong" Keller, well known for 
his sturdy physique, beat the throw to catcher Lombardi and inadvertently 
hit the "The Schnozz" in his groin. Unfortunately for the Reds and Lombardi, 
he had failed to wear his protective cup and Lombardi was in pain and dazed. 
DiMaggio raced around the bases and scored while the ball was just a few 
feet away from the dazed Lombardi. The press was hugely critical of the 
sensitive catcher because of this and it came to be known as "Lombardi's 
Big Snooze". Bill James, in his Historical Baseball Abstract, says that 
"Lombardi was now the Bill Buckner of the 1930s, even more innocent than 
Buckner, and Buckner has plenty of people who should be holding up their 
hands to share his disgrace." James called Lombardi's selection as the 
Series goat "absurd." James noted the Yankees were already ahead three 
games to none and that DiMaggio's run merely made the final score 7-4. 
In 1953, Lombardi had been battling depression and agreed to go to a sanitorium. 
While on his way to the facility, Lombardi slit his throat from ear to 
ear with a razor. He received blood transfusions and was initially listed 
in critical condition, but within a couple of days newspaper reports said 
that he would survive.[4] Lombardi worked as an attendant in the Candlestick 
Park press office and later as a gas station attendant in Oakland, California. 
Lombardi was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1958. He 
died in 1977. Lombardi was posthumously inducted into the Bay Area Sports 
Hall of Fame in 1982 and the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1986. In 
1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 
Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. In 2004, The Cincinnati Reds dedicated 
a bronze statue of Lombardi at the entrance of Great American Ball Park. 
He was honored along with three other Crosley Field Era Reds: Joe Nuxhall, 
Ted Kluszewski and Frank Robinson. The Cincinnati Chapter of the BBWAA
