September 13, 2016 Philadelphia The Phillies–Pirates rivalry is a Major 
League Baseball (MLB) rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh 
Pirates. Both clubs are members of MLB's National League (NL); the Phillies 
are members of the NL East division, while the Pirates are members of the 
NL Central division. The rivalry was considered by some to be one of the 
best in the NL.[3][4][5] The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates 
entered NL play in their fifth season of 1887, four years after the Phillies.[1] 
The Phillies and Pirates had remained together after the NL split into 
two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), 
the two NL East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division 
championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 
1970s and again in the early 1990s,[1][6] the Pirates 9, the Phillies 6; 
together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half 
of the 25 NL East championships during that span.[7] After the Pirates 
moved to the NL Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two 
series each year and the rivalry has diminished.[5] However, many fans, 
especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional 
differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.[8] 
The rivalry is mirrored in the National Hockey League (NHL)'s so-called 
"Battle of Pennsylvania".[8][9] Before 1970, the rivalry seemed to be seldom 
low-key, because the two teams were seldom equally good at the same time.[5] 
However, in 1901, the Phillies and the Pirates finished first and second 
in the standings for the first time,[10] with the Pirates finishing 7 1⁄2 
games ahead of the Phillies.[10] However, afterwards, the Phillies would 
not win their first National League pennant until 1915,[11] thanks to the 
pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy 
Cravath, who set the major-league single-season record for home runs with 
24. During that time, the Pirates dominated the National League, winning 
three more pennants, in 1902, 1903, when they lost the inaugural World 
Series, and when they won their first World Series, in 1909,[12][13][14] 
becoming the first team to open a new stadium with a World Series championship, 
having played their first season at Forbes Field that year.[15] The Phillies 
were in the midst of a period of futility from 1918 to 1948 when the Pirates 
won the 1925 World Series and the 1927 National League pennant.[16][17] 
During that time, the Phillies had only one winning season, in 1932.[18] 
From 1933 to 1948, the Phillies posted 16 consecutive losing seasons, a 
major league record that stood until 2009 (ironically broken by the Pirates).[19] 
After World War II, the Pirates had limited success, despite the presence 
of a genuine star in Ralph Kiner, who led the National League in home runs 
for seven consecutive seasons (1946-1952). During that time, the Phillies 
would have their first winning season in 17 years in 1949,[20] and the 
following year, the Whiz Kids of the Phillies would win their second National 
League pennant, though they lost to the New York Yankees in the 1950 World 
Series.[21][22] In 1960, the Phillies were in last place when the Pirates 
won the World Series.[23] It was during the 1970s that the rivalry became 
intense.[24] The Phillies and the Pirates made up 10 of the possible 22 
National League Championship Series appearances from 1970 to 1980. However, 
neither team enjoyed success during LCS appearances. The Phillies went 
1–3 and the Pirates went 2–4 in NLCS appearances. In most cases, the teams 
had to face the "The Big Red Machine" of the Cincinnati Reds in the NLCS. 
In each of the years the two teams won a pennant, they won a World Series 
(Pirates in 1971 and 1979 and Phillies in 1980).[25][26][27][28] From 1970 
to 1980, the two teams reigned exclusively as National League East champions, 
except in 1973, when the New York Mets won the National League pennant.[5][6] 
The Phillies success under manager Danny Ozark was attributed to a well-rounded 
lineup with Greg Luzinski and Mike Schmidt leading the team in homers, 
Steve Carlton and Tug McGraw leading the pitching, and Larry Bowa and Garry 
Maddox being the secretaries of Philadelphia's defense. The Pirates, under 
managers Danny Murtaugh and Chuck Tanner, also had tremendous offense led 
by Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, and Rennie Stennett, 
catcher Manny Sanguillén, infielders Bill Madlock and Phil Garner being 
the defensive specialists, and Dock Ellis, John Candelaria, Steve Blass 
and Bob Moose leading the pitching. Both teams opened news stadiums in 
successive years. The Pirates opened Three Rivers Stadium in 1970,[29][30] 
while the Phillies opened Veterans Stadium in the South Philadelphia Sports 
Complex the following year.[31] During this period, the Pirates won three 
straight division champions, from 1970 to 1972.[6] However, the Phillies 
didn't enjoy any success, finishing next-to-last in 1970 and in last place 
in 1971 and 1972.[32][33][34] On June 25, 1971, Willie Stargell of the 
Pirates hit the longest home run in history of Veterans Stadium in a 14-4 
Pirates win.[35] The spot where the ball landed was marked with a yellow 
star with a black "S" inside a white circle until Stargell's 2001 death, 
when the white circle was painted black.[36][37] The star remained until 
the stadium's 2004 demolition. The rivalry was heated as both the Phillies 
and Pirates reigned exclusively as National League East Division champions.[1] 
They also played each other 126 times and split the games, 63–63.[5] For 
four straight years, the team that didn't win the division finished second 
in the standings.[1] The Pirates won the division in 1974, 1975, and 1979, 
while the Phillies won three consecutive division titles from 1976 to 1978 
and again in 1980.[6] During the 1974 season. Phillies' second baseman 
Dave Cash coined the phrase "Yes We Can" for the team.[38] Indeed, for 
a while, it looked as if they could. They led the division for 51 days.[39] 
However, in August and September, the Phillies suffered a minor collapse, 
going 25–32 and it was "No They Couldn't,"[39] giving the Pirates the division 
title. The Pirates lost in the 1974 National League Championship Series 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1975, the Pirates won the division championship 
at home against the Phillies and finished 6 1⁄2 games ahead of the Phillies.[40][41][42] 
In the 1975 National League Championship Series, they were swept by the 
eventual champion Reds.[42] In 1976, the two teams opened their season 
against each other in Philadelphia.[4] Johnny Oates of the Phillies had 
been designated to platoon alongside catcher Bob Boone in the season. However, 
in the season opener, Oates cracked his collar bone in a collision at home 
plate with Dave Parker and missed almost half the season.[4][43] The Phillies 
won their first National League East title, eclipsing the century mark 
for wins in a season for the first time in franchise history with 101 wins, 
nine games over the Pirates.[44] However, like the Pirates the year before, 
the Phillies were swept in the National League Championship Series by the 
eventual champion Reds.[44] In 1977, the Phillies eclipsed the century 
mark for wins in a season for the second year in a row with 101 wins, five 
games over the Pirates.[45] However, they lost in the 1977 National League 
Championship Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[45][46] In 1978, the Pirates 
came from fourth place and 11 1⁄2 games behind in mid-August to challenge 
the Phillies for the division title and the teams met in the last regular-season 
series of the season to decide the division title.[7] The Phillies arrived 
in Pittsburgh for a four-game series ahead of the Pirates by 3 1⁄2 on September 
29.[47] The Pirates swept a double-header to extend their winning streak 
of home wins to 24 and to trim the gap to 1 1⁄2 games.[48][49] In the third 
game of the series, Willie Stargell hit a grand slam home run and it looked 
like the lead would be cut to half a game. Instead, Phillies pitcher Randy 
Lerch hit two home runs to help the Phillies come from behind to win the 
game, 10–8, to win their third straight division title on the next-to-last 
day of the season.[50][51] This was the first time that visiting teams 
won a division title at Three Rivers Stadium.[52] In the postseason, the 
Phillies lost for the second year in a row to the Dodgers in the 1978 National 
League Championship Series.[46][53] Both teams won World Series in successive 
years in 1979 and 1980. In 1979, the Phillies acquired infielders Manny 
Trillo and Pete Rose, but the Pirates were too dominant as Stargell shared 
MVP honors with Keith Hernandez and won their most recent one that year. 
The following year, the Phillies won their first one. The Phillies winning 
the 1980 World Series was a moment of peace in the rivalry. Moments after 
Tug McGraw struck out Willie Wilson of the Kansas City Royals with the 
bases loaded to preserve the win for Steve Carlton and the Phillies,[54] 
leaping from the mound to embrace catcher Bob Boone on the field at Veterans 
Stadium in Philadelphia,[55] Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh, himself 
from Pittsburgh, signed a proclamation declaring the next day "World Championship 
Philadelphia Phillies Day" in the state.[56][57] During the team's post-parade 
celebration that day at John F. Kennedy Stadium, the governor said that 
the rivalry was at peace because "nobody competes with the Phillies today. 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, today is the baseball capital of the world. 
All Pennsylvania is proud of you."[58][59] In the 1980s, the rivalry saw 
a moment of peace twice. The game between the two teams during the Phillies 
home opener on April 13, 1981 was a moment of peace in the rivalry. When 
the Phillies received their World Series rings, the team in the visitors' 
dugout was the Pirates. The Phillies won the game 5–1, giving Phillies 
starter Steve Carlton his 250th career victory.[60][61] In 1982, when Willie 
Stargell played his final season, both the Phillies and Pirates declared 
"Willie Stargell Day" in honor of Stargell's last games.[62] The Pirates 
honored him on September 6 before they won a game against the New York 
Mets,[62][63][64] while the Phillies honored him during a game against 
the Pirates on September 19, Stargell's final game in Philadelphia.[62] 
Both teams finished first and second in the standings with the Phillies 
finishing six games ahead of the Pirates in their pennant season of 1983.[65][66] 
In the mid to late 1980s, the rivalry was often low-key, as both teams 
sank in the standings. The only time during that period either team was 
able to post a winning record was during the playoff years of the New York 
Mets, and on both occasions, not only finished second in the standings 
but also the only team in the National League East other than the Mets 
to post a winning record (Phillies in 1986 and Pirates in 1988).[67][68] 
However, the rivalry had some memorable moments during that time. During 
a Phillies 8–6 win in Pittsburgh, on April 18, 1987, Mike Schmidt of the 
Phillies hit his 500th career home run in the ninth inning, a three-run 
home run.[69][70] Perhaps the most memorable moment in the rivalry during 
the 1980s came on June 8, 1989. The Pirates scored 10 runs in the top of 
the first inning of a game at Veterans Stadium, including three on a Barry 
Bonds home run.[71][72] As the Phillies came to bat in the bottom of the 
first, Pirates broadcaster (and former pitcher) Jim Rooker said on the 
air, "If we lose this game, I'll walk home."[73] Instead, both Von Hayes 
and Steve Jeltz hit two home runs (the latter would hit only five during 
his Major League career) to trigger a Phillies comeback.[74] The Phillies, 
trailing now only 11–10 in the eighth inning, scored the tying run on a 
wild pitch, then took the lead on Darren Daulton's two-run single and went 
on to win 15–11.[74] The Pirates became the first team to lose a game after 
scoring 10 runs in the first inning.[73][75] Rooker had to wait until after 
the season to make good on his "walk home" promise, conducting a 300-plus-mile 
charity walk from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.[73] In 1990, the Phillies 
and Pirates began another exclusive reign of National League East championships,[7] 
although both franchises did not field contenders until deep into the season 
during that reign. The Pirates, with sluggers Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla 
and pitcher Doug Drabek, and managed by Jim Leyland, won three straight, 
from 1990 to 1992 (Bonilla wasn't with the Pirates in 1992),[6] while the 
Phillies, led by stars such as Darren Daulton, John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, 
and Curt Schilling, won the 1993 NL pennant.[76][77] All NL East division 
titles during this period, except for 1990, were won at Three Rivers Stadium.[7] 
In 1990, the Pirates returned to the postseason for the first time since 
winning the 1979 World Series, but lost to the Cincinnati Reds in the 1990 
National League Championship Series.[78][79] The 1991 Pirates won the division 
for the second straight year, aided by their 12–6 record against the Phillies,[80][81] 
and won the division championship in the final meeting between the two 
teams.[80] When the Phillies saw the Pirates celebrate the championship, 
several Phillies, including outfielder Wes Chamberlain and shortstop Dickie 
Thon said that they had seen it before, but Phillies manager Jim Fregosi 
"didn't watch it" after seeing Pittsburgh Police and Pirates security ring 
the field.[82] The Pirates became the first NL East team to win consecutive 
division titles since the Phillies in 1978,[83] but lost to the Atlanta 
Braves in the 1991 National League Championship Series.[84] In 1992, Phillies 
second baseman Mickey Morandini performed an unassisted triple play against 
the Pirates and, in doing so, became the first second baseman in National 
League history and the first overall player in the regular season to do 
so.[85] The Pirates went on to three-peat for the second time, and were 
the first National League East team to do so since the Phillies in 1976–1978.[86] 
Once again, they lost to the Braves in the National League Championship 
Series.[87][88] In 1993, the Phillies, who finished in last place in 1992,[89][90] 
steadily led the NL East and were in first place every day but one day, 
April 9.[91][92][93] The Pirates were in first place on the very day that 
the Phillies weren't in first place.[91] On August 29, the Phillies had 
a 10 1⁄2-game lead, but a September slip caused some columnists in the 
city to compare the club to the 1964 team, which surrendered a 6 1⁄2 game 
lead during the last weeks of the season, losing 10 games in a row with 
12 games remaining and losing the pennant by one game to the eventual champion 
St. Louis Cardinals.[94] They dropped five of seven at home, reducing their 
lead to four with 13 games remaining.[92] On September 27, the Phillies 
came into Pittsburgh for a four-game series against the Pirates. The Phillies 
were ahead by 6 games with seven games left: four against the Pirates and 
the last three against the Cardinals.[92] The Phillies won the opener, 
6–4, and with the Florida Marlins winning at home against the second place 
Montréal Expos, 3–1, clinched at least a tie for first place in the division.[95] 
The next day, the Phillies were trailing 4–3 after giving up three runs 
in the sixth, but with a six-run seventh inning, capped by Mariano Duncan's 
grand slam home run, they won their first division title since winning 
the 1983 National League pennant.[96][97][98] Outfielder Wes Chamberlain 
ended all the references to 1964, screaming, "It's 1993, baby! It ain't 
1964. Where are all those ghosts now?"[96][97] Many Phillies fans had made 
the cross-state trip to Pittsburgh to see their team clinch and after the 
game, manager Jim Fregosi threw his cap to them as he walked off the field.[99] 
Although Fregosi won the American League West title as manager of the California 
Angels in 1979, he said that 1993 was "the most gratifying year I have 
ever spent in baseball. It's just great. There's nothing like that. I'm 
just so proud of these guys. They've been great all year long."[96] Pirates 
manager Jim Leyland, this time, had to see the Phillies celebration from 
the home team dugout. He watched the celebration, unlike Fregosi two years 
before, and said: "To me, the real grind is the 162-game schedule...On 
behalf of the entire Pirates organization, I congratulate the Phillies. 
They did a tremendous job. It's well deserved. They earned everything they 
got. They should be real proud of doing it—and real proud of the way they 
did it."[100] It was only the third time that a visiting team had won a 
division title at Three Rivers Stadium, following the Phillies themselves 
in 1978 and the Chicago Cubs in 1984.[52] Like the Pirates in 1991 and 
1992, the Phillies faced the Braves in the 1993 National League Championship 
Series.[101] However, they beat the Braves,[102][103][104] but lost to 
the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series on the famous walk-off home run 
by Joe Carter.[105][106] The two teams met 18 times during a season for 
the last time in 1992.[5] The following year, the number of meetings was 
reduced to 13, as the National League expanded to include the Florida Marlins.[5][76] 
The rivalry came to an end when MLB realigned for 1994 in the form of three 
divisions in each league, and the addition of an expanded playoff format.[107] 
When agreeing on the realignment, the Pirates switched to the newly created 
Central Division and gave up their spot in the NL East to the Atlanta Braves.[108][109][110] 
Pirates President Mark Sauer said that "there are a lot of reasons for 
the Pirates to be in...the Central...Our key marketing people...all think 
this is the way to go."[111] He also cited that the "Cleveland (Indians), 
the closest franchise to Pittsburgh, also chose the Central when faced 
with the same East vs. Central decision."[110] However, manager Jim Leyland 
felt that the "move should have little on-field impact."[110] Pittsburgh's 
general manager, Cam Bonifay, said that "based on our rivalries and our 
fan base, we feel comfortable being in the Central Division."[109] He also 
based it that the Pittsburgh Steelers in the National Football League were 
in the same division as two of the same cities the Steelers have in their 
division, Cincinnati and Houston, saying that "we don't feel that there's 
any major difference between the Eastern and Central Divisions. With the 
Steelers' being in the Central Division, from our fans' viewpoint, it would 
not limit our rivalries. Our fan base understands where we are geographically. 
The size of the markets of Houston, St. Louis and Cincinnati are more in 
line."[109] Additionally, even though the Marlins did offer to go to the 
Central, the Pirates didn't want to play in the same division as the Braves 
since the team wasn't sure how long the Braves were going to be good, and 
felt it would be more competitive in the Central.[109] On the Phillies 
side, President Bill Giles said that the realignment made him "disappointed 
at losing the cross-state rivalry,"[110] and "strongly feel Pittsburgh 
should be in the East, because we've had a rivalry with them for 104 years. 
I just think there's a more legitimate argument for keeping the two Pennsylvania 
teams together."[112] However, he was fortunate that the realignment solidified 
their rivalry with the New York Mets.[112] After their loss to the Atlanta 
Braves in the 1992 NLCS, the Pirates lost Bonds and Doug Drabek to free 
agency,[113] and had a long and protracted recovery following that: they 
had 20 straight losing seasons between 1993 and 2012, and did not reach 
the playoffs again until 2013.[114] (The team's predictions on the Braves 
did turn out to be correct, however: the Braves would win every NL East 
title through the 2005 season, excluding the 1994 season, which was cut 
short due to the player's strike.) The Phillies, after winning the 1993 
pennant, also struggled through the 1990s, but won five straight division 
championships from 2007 to 2011,[115] had the best record in baseball back-to-back 
in 2010 and 2011, in 2011 set a franchise record for wins in a season with 
102, breaking the previous record of 101 in 1976 and 1977,[116][117] and 
broke the Curse of Billy Penn to win the 2008 World Series.[118] Although 
the rivalry may not reignite soon,[3] since 2005, those associated with 
the Phillies and the Pirates would like to see the rivalry reignited, so 
that they can see both teams play each other quite often. In 2000, there 
was talk of subdividing the National League into four divisions. The proposed 
realignment had the Pirates return to a four-team NL East with the Phillies, 
Mets, and Montreal Expos. The alignment would've gone into effect for the 
2001 MLB season, coinciding with the Pirates opening PNC Park. The proposal 
eventually was abandoned before reaching a vote.[119] In 2005, Phillies 
pitcher Jon Lieber, a former Pirate, called it "a shame" that the two teams 
"don't play more often", and "we'd get back to playing more National League 
teams."[5] Pirates broadcaster Bob Walk said that "this is a rivalry that 
I grew up with...For some of us older Pirates and Phillies fans and faithful 
and players, the rivalry is kind of still there...I know the history of 
it...Because I was on the other side of it, too."[5] Phillies General Manager 
Ed Wade said that he could "certainly feel it, having been on both ends", 
having started his career with the Pirates in their public relations department 
in the late 1970s.[4] During the series between the two teams at Citizens 
Bank Park in Philadelphia in 2006, Pirates outfielder Jason Bay said that 
"you only face these guys one (series) here and once at our place. Six 
games is tough to really fire that rivalry in there...If we ever get into 
playoffs, it would definitely be magnified."[65] However, Phillies outfielder 
Bobby Abreu said that the realignment meant games between the Phillies 
and the Pirates "are just two teams playing against each other, just trying 
to get a win."[65] Pirates President Frank Coonelly, himself born and raised 
in Philadelphia, said that he wanted to see more of both the Phillies and 
the New York Mets at PNC Park.[120] He said that "it is a shame our fans 
only get one opportunity a year to see two clubs with whom we have had 
such great rivalries,"[120] and that "our challenge...is that the combination 
of interleague play and the unbalanced schedule means that we only see...the 
Phillies and the Mets one time a year in Pittsburgh. We need to have these 
rivals in Pittsburgh more often. That can be accomplished through realignment 
or a more balanced schedule."[121] Manager John Russell and first baseman 
Adam LaRoche agreed, saying that the Phillies, Pirates, and Mets should 
be in the same division, as all three "were interchangeable for a while, 
with the great matchups...But now, we're the ones separated."[120] After 
becoming manager of the Mets for the 2011 season, Terry Collins raised 
the issue further when he chose to wear 10 to honor Jim Leyland, having 
served on his coaching staff when with the Pirates in 1992 and 1993.[122] 
In 2011, when MLB was considering moving an existing National League team 
to the American League and requiring year-round interleague play, Coonelly 
suggested moving the Pirates back to the NL East if MLB decided against 
having a team switch leagues, with him adding, "If one National League 
division has to have six teams, nothing says it has to be the Central."[123] 
MLB eventually decided to move the Houston Astros to the American League 
for the 2013 MLB season, leaving the Pirates in a reduced NL Central. Some 
sports fans in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh also want the rivalry to be 
reignited.[8] The rivalry has also been attributed to the proximity between 
the two largest cities in the state of Pennsylvania, which are approximately 
six hours apart by car.[124] The Phillies' fanbase comes from the Delaware 
Valley (the Philadelphia metropolitan area), which includes Southeastern 
Pennsylvania, central New Jersey south of Princeton, southern New Jersey, 
northern Delaware and extreme northeast parts of Maryland.[125] Conversely, 
the Pirates' fanbase generally draws from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, 
which includes Western Pennsylvania, most of the state of West Virginia, 
and parts of both Southeastern Ohio and the Maryland Panhandle. The Philadelphia–Pittsburgh 
rivalry is evident in other sports, as seen between the Philadelphia Flyers
