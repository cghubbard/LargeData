Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 1966 followed the system introduced 
for even-number years in 1956. The Baseball Writers' Association of America 
(BBWAA) voted by mail to select from recent major league players with provision 
for a second, "runoff" election in case of no winner. Ted Williams tallied 
more than 90% on the first ballot. Meanwhile, the Veterans Committee was 
meeting annually to consider executives, managers, umpires, and earlier 
major league players. It selected Casey Stengel. The BBWAA was authorized 
to elect players active in 1946 or later, but not after 1960. All 10-year 
members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote. Voters were instructed to cast 
votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 
75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. A total 
of 48 players received votes; 302 ballots were cast, with 227 votes required 
for election. A total of 2,208 individual votes were cast, an average of 
7.31 per ballot. Candidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated

and was the last player to hit .400 in a season (.406 in 1941). He famously
