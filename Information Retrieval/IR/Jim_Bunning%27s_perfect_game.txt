On June 21, 1964, Jim Bunning of the Philadelphia Phillies pitched the 
seventh perfect game in Major League Baseball history, defeating the New 
York Mets 6-0 in the first game of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium. A father 
of seven children at the time, Bunning pitched his perfect game on Father's 
Day. One of Bunning's daughters, Barbara, was in attendance, as was his 
wife, Mary.[1] Needing only 90 pitches to complete his masterpiece, Bunning 
struck out 10 batters, including six of the last nine he faced; the last 
two strikeouts were of the last two batters he faced: George Altman and 
John Stephenson. The perfect game was the first regular season perfect 
game since Charlie Robertson's perfect game in 1922 (Don Larsen had pitched 
a perfect game in between, in the 1956 World Series), as well as the first 
in modern-day National League history (two perfect games had been pitched 
in 1880). It was also the first no-hitter by a Phillies pitcher since Johnny 
Lush no-hit the Brooklyn Superbas on May 1, 1906. Bunning, who no-hit the 
Boston Red Sox while with the Detroit Tigers in 1958, joined Cy Young as 
the only pitchers to throw no-hitters in both the National and American 
Leagues; he has since been joined by Nolan Ryan, Hideo Nomo and Randy Johnson. 
The perfect game also made Bunning the third pitcher, after Young and Addie 
Joss, to throw a perfect game and an additional no-hitter; Sandy Koufax, 
Johnson, Mark Buehrle and Roy Halladay have since joined him (the latter 
of these pitchers pitched his additional no-hitter in the 2010 National 
League Division Series after pitching his perfect game earlier in the season). 
As the perfect game developed, Bunning defied the baseball superstition 
that no one should talk about a no-hitter in progress, speaking to his 
teammates about the perfect game to keep himself relaxed and loosen up 
his teammates. Bunning had abided by the tradition during a near-no hitter 
a few weeks before, determining afterwards that keeping quiet didn’t help.[2] 
Gus Triandos, Bunning's catcher, had also caught Hoyt Wilhelm's no-hitter 
on September 20, 1958 while with the Baltimore Orioles, becoming the first 
catcher to catch no-hitters in both leagues. Italics denotes post-season perfect game
