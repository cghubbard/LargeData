The 1992 Major League Baseball draft took place on June 1, 1992, through 
a conference call involving all 28 MLB teams of the time. Phil Nevin of 
Cal State Fullerton was the first overall selection, chosen by the Houston 
Astros.[1] Derek Jeter, widely considered a future member of the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame, was selected by the New York Yankees with the sixth 
selection. In addition to Nevin, Paul Shuey, B. J. Wallace, Jeffrey Hammonds, 
and Chad Mottola were selected ahead of Jeter.[1] The 1993 expansion Colorado 
Rockies and Florida Marlins participated in the MLB Draft for the first 
time in 1992.[2] With the first overall selections of the previous two 
drafts, Chipper Jones and Brien Taylor, receiving signing bonuses of $1.2 million 
($2,177,178 in current dollar terms) and $1.55 million ($2,697,447 in current 
dollar terms) respectively, salary demands of new players became a factor 
in the 1992 draft.[1] Prior to the draft, Jeffrey Hammonds of the Stanford 
Cardinal baseball team sought a signing bonus of $1.8 million ($3,040,408 
in current dollar terms).[3] Derek Jeter, a high school player who had 
a commitment to play college baseball at the University of Michigan, was 
believed to be seeking a bonus of at least $1 million ($1,689,115 in current 
dollar terms) to forego college.[1] The Astros, holding the first overall 
selection, were keenly aware of the bonus demands of Hammonds and Jeter, 
as they were unable to sign their first-round pick in the 1991 MLB draft, 
John Burke, who held out for a bonus of $500,000 ($870,144 in current dollar 
terms) as the sixth overall selection.[4] They selected Phil Nevin, the 
1992 College World Series Most Outstanding Player, with the first overall 
selection. In addition to perceiving Nevin as close to MLB-ready, needing 
little development in minor league baseball, Nevin also did not seek a 
large signing bonus. He agreed to sign with the Astros for $700,000 ($1,182,381 
in current dollar terms).[4][5] Astros' scout Hal Newhouser quit in protest, 
as he had insisted to Astros' management that they should choose Jeter.[6] 
The teams with the first four selections, the Astros, Cleveland Indians, 
Montreal Expos, and Baltimore Orioles, had the four lowest payrolls in 
MLB.[2] The Cleveland Indians selected Paul Shuey out of the University 
of North Carolina with the second selection, who they projected could develop 
into a closer comparable to Rob Dibble. The Expos, who preferred Hammonds, 
drafted B. J. Wallace instead, as they were unable to afford Hammonds' 
salary demands.[2] The Orioles selected Hammonds with the fourth overall 
selection; he signed with the Orioles for $975,000 ($1,646,888 in current 
dollar terms), the largest signing bonus given out in the 1992 Draft.[1] 
With the fifth pick, the Reds chose Chad Mottola from the University of 
Central Florida (UCF), making Mottola the first UCF athlete to be chosen 
in the first round of a professional sports draft.[7] He signed with the 
Reds the day of the draft for $400,000 ($675,646 in current dollar terms).[1] 
Yankees scout Dick Groch, assigned to scout in the Midwest, watched Jeter 
participate in an all-star camp held at Western Michigan University, and 
came away sold by Jeter's talent.[8] Though the Yankees were also concerned 
that Jeter might attend college, Grouch convinced the team to select Jeter. 
Regarding the possibility Jeter would attend Michigan, Groch said "the 
only place Derek Jeter's going is to Cooperstown", referring to the home 
city of the Baseball Hall of Fame.[9] Jeter signed with the Yankees for 
$800,000 ($1,351,292 in current dollar terms).[10] Scott Boras advised 
Charles Johnson and Michael Tucker. Those players fell in the first round
