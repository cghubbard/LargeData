72nd Street is one of the major bi-directional crosstown streets in the 
New York City borough of Manhattan. Where the west end of 72nd Street curves 
into the south end of Riverside Drive, the memorial to Eleanor Roosevelt 
stands in Riverside Park. At this end of the street is the landmarked Beaux-Arts 
Chatsworth Apartments (344 West 72nd Street, John E. Scharsmith, architect, 
1902–04, Annex, 1905–06).[1] The street was designated by the Commissioners' 
Plan of 1811 that established the Manhattan street grid as one of 15 east-west 
streets that would be 100 feet (30 m) in width (while other streets were 
designated as 60 feet (18 m) in width).[2] At 72nd Street, Broadway crosses 
Amsterdam Avenue, creating a small triangular space, Verdi Square; across 
the street to the south lies Sherman Square. 72nd Street is one of the 
few streets to go through Central Park, connecting the Upper West Side 
via Women's Gate, Terrace Drive and Inventors Gate, with the Upper East 
Side. However, Terrace Drive is often closed to vehicular traffic and therefore 
the crosstown M72 bus crosses the park at 65th Street. The Dakota apartment 
building is located on the corner of West 72nd Street and Central Park 
West. Before automotive traffic, broad cross-streets offered desirable 
sites for prominent residences; the mansion at the southeast corner of 
Fifth Avenue was the first of the Gilded Age mansions to be replaced by 
an apartment block, 907 Fifth Avenue, and McKim, Mead, and White’s Charles 
L. Tiffany mansion (1882) at the northeast corner of Madison Avenue was 
replaced by an apartment block (19 East 72nd Street, Rosario Candela, architect[3]), 
but the Rhinelander Mansion, occupied now by Ralph Lauren, is still located 
on the southeast corner. At Third Avenue, the Tower East apartment block 
(1960) set a new model for high-rise residences, a slab tower set back 
from the street front and isolated on a low base.[4] On October 11, 2006, 
the Belaire Apartments, a 50-story apartment complex located at 524 E. 
72nd Street between York Avenue and the FDR Drive, was the site of a plane 
crash involving Cory Lidle's aircraft. Tunneling for the new Second Avenue 
Subway began in 2010; in the future, the Q train will stop at 72nd Street 
station. Meanwhile, the closest subway stops for 72nd Street on the Upper 
East Side are the 68th and 77th Street stations (6 <6> trains during the 
day and 4 6 trains during the night) of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. 
72nd Street is a major stop on several lines of the New York City Subway 
system. The M72 provides crosstown bus service to Upper East Side – York 
Avenue (eastbound) or West Side – Freedom Place (westbound) via 72nd Street.
