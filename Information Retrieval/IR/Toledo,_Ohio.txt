Toledo (/təˈliːdoʊ/) is a city in and the county seat of Lucas County, 
Ohio, United States.[7] Toledo is in northwest Ohio, at the western end 
of Lake Erie bordering the state of Michigan. The city was founded by United 
States citizens in 1833 on the west bank of the Maumee River, and originally 
incorporated as part of Monroe County, Michigan Territory. It was re-founded 
in 1837, after conclusion of the Toledo War, when it was incorporated in 
Ohio. After construction of the Miami and Erie Canal, Toledo grew quickly; 
it also benefited from its position on the railway line between New York 
City and Chicago. It has since become a city with an art community, auto 
assembly businesses, education, healthcare, and local sports teams. The 
city's glass industry has earned it the nickname, "The Glass City". The 
population of Toledo as of the 2010 Census[update] was 287,208, making 
it the 71st-largest city in the United States. It is the fourth most populous 
city in the U.S. state of Ohio after Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. 
The Toledo metropolitan area had a 2010 population of 651,429, and was 
the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the state of Ohio, behind Cleveland, 
Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Akron.[8] Varying cultures of indigenous 
peoples lived along the rivers and lakefront of what is now northwestern 
Ohio for thousands of years. When the city of Toledo was preparing to pave 
its streets, it surveyed "two prehistoric semicircular earthworks, presumably 
for stockades." One was at the intersection of Clayton and Oliver streets 
on the south bank of Swan Creek; the other was at the intersection of Fassett 
and Fort streets on the right bank of the Maumee River.[9] Such earthworks 
were typical of mound-building peoples. This region was part of a larger 
area controlled by the historic tribes of the Wyandot and the people of 
the Council of Three Fires (Ojibwe, Potawatomie and Odawa). The first European 
to visit the area was Étienne Brûlé, a French-Canadian guide and explorer, 
in 1615.[10] The French established trading posts in the area by 1680 to 
take advantage of the lucrative fur trade. The Odawa moved from Manitoulin 
Island and the Bruce Peninsula at the invitation of the French, who established 
a trading post at Fort Detroit, about 60 miles to the north. They settled 
an area extending into northwest Ohio. By the early 18th century, the Odawa 
occupied areas along most of the Maumee River to its mouth. They served 
as middlemen between the French and tribes further to the west and north. 
The Wyandot occupied central Ohio, and the Shawnee and Lenape occupied 
the southern areas.[11][12] The area was not settled by European-Americans 
until 1795 and after. After the conclusion of the American Revolutionary 
War, the regional tribes allied in the Western Confederacy, fighting a 
series of battles in what became known as the Northwest Indian War in an 
effort to repulse American settlers from the country west of the Appalachians 
and north of the Ohio River. They were finally defeated in 1794 at the 
Battle of Fallen Timbers. This loose affiliation of tribes included the 
Wyandot and Council of Three Fires. By a treaty in 1795, they ceded large 
areas of territory in Ohio to the United States, opening lands for European-American 
settlement. According to Charles E. Slocum, the American military built 
Fort Industry at the mouth of the Maumee about 1805, but as a temporary 
stockade. No official reports support the 19th-century tradition of its 
earlier history there.[9] The United States continued to work to extinguish 
land claims of Native Americans. In the Treaty of Detroit (1807), the above 
four tribes ceded a large land area to the United States of what became 
southeastern Michigan and northwestern Ohio, to the mouth of the Maumee 
River (where Toledo later developed). Reserves for the Odawa were set aside 
in northwestern Ohio for a limited period of time. The Native Americans 
signed the treaty at Detroit, Michigan on November 17, 1807, with William 
Hull, governor of the Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs, 
as the sole representative of the U.S.[13] More European-American settlers 
entered the area over the next few years, but many fled during the War 
of 1812, when British forces raided the area with their Indian allies. 
Resettlement began around 1818 after a Cincinnati syndicate purchased a 
974-acre (3.9 km2) tract at the mouth of Swan Creek and named it Port Lawrence, 
developing it as the modern downtown area of Toledo. Immediately to the 
north of that, another syndicate founded the town of Vistula, the historic 
north end.[10] These two towns physically bordered each other with Cherry 
Street dividing them. This is why present-day streets on the northeast 
side of Cherry Street run at a slightly different angle from those to the 
southwest of it. In 1824 the Ohio state legislature authorized the construction 
of the Miami and Erie Canal and later its Wabash and Erie Canal extension 
in 1833. The canal's purpose was to connect the city of Cincinnati to Lake 
Erie for water transportation to eastern markets, including to New York 
City via the Erie Canal and Hudson River. At that time no highways had 
been built in the state, and it was very difficult for goods produced locally 
to reach the larger markets east of the Appalachian Mountains. During the 
canal's planning phase, many small towns along the northern shores of Maumee 
River heavily competed to be the ending terminus of the canal, knowing 
it would give them a profitable status.[14] The towns of Port Lawrence 
and Vistula merged in 1833 to better compete against the upriver towns 
of Waterville, Maumee, and Manhattan. The inhabitants of this joined settlement 
chose the name Toledo, "but the reason for this choice is buried in a welter 
of legends. One recounts that Washington Irving, who was traveling in Spain 
at the time, suggested the name to his brother, a local resident; this 
explanation ignores the fact that Irving returned to the United States 
in 1832. Others award the honor to Two Stickney, son of the major who quaintly 
numbered his sons and named his daughters after States. The most popular 
version attributes the naming to Willard J. Daniels, a merchant, who reportedly 
suggested Toledo because it 'is easy to pronounce, is pleasant in sound, 
and there is no other city of that name on the American continent.'"[10] 
Despite Toledo's efforts, the canal built the final terminus in Manhattan, 
one-half mile (800 m) to the north of Toledo, because it was closer to 
Lake Erie. As a compromise, the state placed two sidecuts before the terminus, 
one in Toledo at Swan Creek and another in Maumee, about 10 miles to the 
southwest. Among the numerous treaties made between the Ottawa and the 
United States were two signed in this area: at Miami (Maumee) Bay in 1831 
and Maumee, Ohio, upriver of Toledo, in 1833.[15] These actions were among 
US purchases or exchanges of land in order to accomplish Indian Removal 
of the Ottawa from areas wanted for European-American settlement. The last 
of the Odawa did not leave this area until 1839, when Ottokee, grandson 
of Pontiac, led his band from their village at the mouth of the Maumee 
River to Indian Territory in Kansas.[16][17] An almost bloodless conflict 
between Ohio and the Michigan Territory, called the Toledo War (1835–1836), 
was "fought" over a narrow strip of land from the Indiana border to Lake 
Erie, now containing the city and the suburbs of Sylvania and Oregon, Ohio. 
The strip—which varied between five and eight miles (13 km) in width—was 
claimed by both the state of Ohio and the Michigan Territory due to conflicting 
legislation concerning the location of the Ohio-Michigan state line. Militias 
from both states were sent to the border but never engaged. The only casualty 
of the conflict was a Michigan deputy sheriff—stabbed in the leg with a 
pen knife by Two Stickney during the arrest of his elder brother, One Stickney—and 
the loss of two horses, two pigs and a few chickens stolen from an Ohio 
farm by lost members of the Michigan militia. In the end, the state of 
Ohio was awarded the land after the state of Michigan was given a larger 
portion of the Upper Peninsula in exchange. Stickney Avenue in Toledo is 
named for brothers One and Two Stickney.[18] Toledo was very slow to expand 
during its first two decades of settlement. The first lot was sold in the 
Port Lawrence section of the city in 1833. It held 1,205 persons in 1835, 
and five years later it had gained just seven more persons. Settlers came 
and went quickly through Toledo and between 1833 and 1836, ownership of 
land had changed so many times that none of the original parties remained 
in the town. The canal and its Toledo sidecut entrance were completed in 
1843. Soon after the canal was functional, the new canal boats had become 
too large to use the shallow waters at the terminus in Manhattan. More 
boats began using the Swan Creek sidecut than its official terminus, quickly 
putting the Manhattan warehouses out of business and triggering a rush 
to move business to Toledo. Most of Manhattan's residents moved out by 
1844. The 1850 census recorded Toledo as having 3,829 residents and Manhattan 
541. The 1860 census shows Toledo with a population of 13,768 and Manhattan 
with 788. While the towns were only a mile apart, Toledo grew by 359% in 
ten years. Manhattan's growth was on a small base and never competed, given 
the drawbacks of its lesser canal outlet. By the 1880s, Toledo expanded 
over the vacant streets of Manhattan and Tremainsville, a small town to 
the west.[14][19] In the last half of the 19th century, railroads slowly 
began to replace canals as the major form of transportation. They were 
faster and had greater capacity. Toledo soon became a hub for several railroad 
companies and a hotspot for industries such as furniture producers, carriage 
makers, breweries, glass manufacturers, and others. Large immigrant populations 
came to the area, attracted by the many factory jobs available and the 
city's easy accessibility. By 1880, Toledo was one of the largest cities 
in Ohio and it added significant infrastructure from its thriving economy. 
Toledo continued to expand in population and industry into the early 20th 
century. Because of its dependence on manufacturing, the city was hit hard 
by the Great Depression. Many large-scale WPA projects were constructed 
to reemploy citizens in the 1930s. Some of these include the amphitheater 
and aquarium at the Toledo Zoo and a major expansion to the Toledo Museum 
of Art. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Toledo's population as 94.8% 
white and 5.2% black.[20] The city rebounded, but the slump of American 
manufacturing in the second half of the 20th century during industrial 
restructuring cost many jobs. In addition, suburbanization and highway 
development drew more established, middle-class people out of center cities 
for newer housing. By the time of the 1980s, Toledo had a depressed economy. 
The destruction of many buildings downtown, along with several failed business 
ventures in housing in the core, led to a reverse city-suburb wealth problem 
common in small cities with land to spare. In recent years, Downtown Toledo 
has supported significant redevelopment to draw residents back to the city. 
Fifth Third Field opened in 2002, and is ranked as one of the top minor-league 
baseball stadiums and a popular family destination. The multi-purpose Huntington 
Center opened in 2009. It hosts the Toledo Walleye ECHL ice hockey team,[21] 
and the Toledo Crush of the Legends Football League.[22] It also is the 
site of live performances of musicians and bands, and World Wrestling Entertainment. 
Toledo is located at 41°39′56″N 83°34′31″W﻿ / ﻿41.66556°N 83.57528°W﻿ / 
41.66556; -83.57528 (41.665682, −83.575337).[23] The city has a total area 
of 84.12 square miles (217.87 km2), of which 80.69 square miles (208.99 km2) 
is land and 3.43 square miles (8.88 km2) is water.[2] The city straddles 
the Maumee River at its mouth at the southern end of Maumee Bay, the westernmost 
inlet of Lake Erie. The city is located north of what had been the Great 
Black Swamp, giving rise to another nickname, Frog Town. Toledo sits within 
the borders of a sandy oak savanna called the Oak Openings Region, an important 
ecological site that once comprised more than 300 square miles (780 km2).[24] 
Toledo is located within approximately four hours' driving time of many 
large cities, including Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, 
Pittsburgh, Indianapolis and Chicago. The Old West End is a historic neighborhood 
of Victorian, Arts & Crafts, and other Edwardian-style houses. The historic 
district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According 
to the US Census Bureau, the Toledo Metropolitan Area covers four Ohio 
counties and combines with other micropolitan areas and counties for a 
combined statistical area. Some of what are now considered its suburbs 
in Ohio include: Bowling Green, Holland, Lake Township, Maumee, Millbury, 
Monclova Township, Northwood, Oregon, Ottawa Hills, Perrysburg, Rossford, 
Springfield Township, Sylvania, Walbridge, Waterville, Whitehouse, and 
Washington Township. Toledo, as with much of the Great Lakes region, has 
a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), characterized by four distinct 
seasons. Both temperature and precipitation vary widely seasonally. Lake 
Erie moderates the climate somewhat, especially in late spring and fall, 
when air and water temperature differences are maximal. However, this effect 
is lessened in the winter by the fact that Lake Erie freezes over in most 
winters (unlike the other Great Lakes), coupled with prevailing winds that 
are often westerly. During the summer, southerly and westerly prevailing 
winds, combined with warm surface waters of Lake Erie, negate the lake's 
cooling effect. In addition, the lake increases local humidity, adding 
to discomfort on hot days. Summers are very warm and humid, with July averaging 
73.5 °F (23.1 °C) and temperatures of 90 °F (32 °C) or more seen on 16.5 
days.[25] Winters are cold and somewhat snowy, with a January mean temperature 
of 25.5 °F (−3.6 °C), and lows at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) on 6.2 nights.[25] 
The spring and summer months tend to be wetter than autumn and winter. 
About 37 inches (94 cm) of snow falls per year, much less than the Snow 
Belt cities, because of the prevailing wind direction. Temperature extremes 
have ranged from −20 °F (−29 °C) on January 21, 1984 to 105 °F (41 °C) 
on July 14, 1936. As of the 2010 census, the city proper had a population 
of 287,128. It is the principal city in the Toledo Metropolitan Statistical 
Area which had a population of 651,429, while the larger Toledo-Fremont 
Combined Statistical Area had a population of 712,373. According to the 
Toledo Metropolitan Council of Governments, the Toledo/Northwest Ohio region 
of 10 counties has over 1 million residents. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated 
Toledo's population as 297,806 in 2006 and 295,029 in 2007. In response 
to an appeal by the City of Toledo, the Census Bureau's July 2007 estimate 
was revised to 316,851, slightly more than in 2000,[33] which would have 
been the city's first population gain in 40 years. However, the 2010 census 
figures released in March 2011 showed the population as of April 1, 2010, 
at 287,208, indicating a 25% loss of population since its zenith in 1970. 
As of the census[3] of 2010, there were 287,208 people, 119,730 households, 
and 68,364 families residing in the city. The population density was 3,559.4 
inhabitants per square mile (1,374.3/km2). There were 138,039 housing units 
at an average density of 1,710.7 per square mile (660.5/km2). The racial 
makeup of the city was 64.8% White, 27.2% African American, 0.4% Native 
American, 1.1% Asian, 2.6% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more 
races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.4% of the population (The 
majority are Mexican American at 5.1%.) Non-Hispanic Whites were 61.4% 
of the population in 2010,[34] down from 84% in 1970.[20] There were 119,730 
households of which 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with 
them, 31.6% were married couples living together, 19.9% had a female householder 
with no husband present, 5.7% had a male householder with no wife present, 
and 42.9% were non-families. 34.8% of all households were made up of individuals

of the population were below the poverty line, including 25.9% of those 
under age 18 and 10.4% of those age 65 or over. In 2013, the city was ranked 
89 of the Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in America.[36] In the second decade 
of the 21st century, the city had a gradual peak in violent crime. In 2010, 
there was a combined total of 3,272 burglaries, 511 robberies, 753 aggravated 
assaults, 25 homicides, as well as 574 motor vehicle thefts out of what 
was then a decreasing population of 287,208.[37] In 2011, there were 1,562 
aggravated assaults, 30 murders, 1,152 robberies, 8,366 burglaries, and 
1,465 cases of motor vehicle theft. In 2012, there were a combined total 
of 39 murders, 2,015 aggravated assaults, 6,739 burglaries, and 1,334 cases 
of motor vehicle theft. In 2013 it had a drop in the crime rate.[38] According 
to a state government task force, Toledo has been identified as the fourth-largest 
recruitment site for human trafficking in the US.[39] Before the industrial 
revolution, Toledo was important as a port city on the Great Lakes. With 
the advent of the automobile, the city became best known for industrial 
manufacturing. Both General Motors and Chrysler had factories in metropolitan 
Toledo, and automobile manufacturing has been important at least since 
Kirk,[40] which began operations early in the 20th century. The largest 
employer in Toledo was Jeep for much of the 20th century. Since the late 
20th century, industrial restructuring reduced the number of these well-paying 
jobs. The University of Toledo is influential in the city, contributing 
to the prominence of healthcare as the city's biggest employer. The metro 
area contains four Fortune 500 companies: Dana Holding Corporation, Owens 
Corning, The Andersons, and Owens Illinois. HCR Manor Care is a Fortune 
1000 company headquartered in Toledo. One SeaGate is the location of Fifth-Third 
Bank's Northwest Ohio headquarters. Toledo is known as the Glass City because 
of its long history of glass manufacturing, including windows, bottles, 
windshields, construction materials, and glass art, of which the Toledo 
Museum of Art has a large collection. Several large glass companies have 
their origins here. Owens-Illinois, Owens Corning, Libbey Glass, Pilkington 
North America (formerly Libbey Owens Ford), and Therma-Tru have long been 
a staple of Toledo's economy. Other offshoots and spinoffs of these companies 
also continue to play important roles in Toledo's economy. Fiberglass giant 
Johns Manville's two plants in the metro area were originally built by 
a subsidiary of Libbey Owens Ford. Several large, Fortune 500 automotive-related 
companies had their headquarters in Toledo, including Electric AutoLite, 
Sheller-Globe Corporation, Champion Spark Plug, Questor, and Dana Holding 
Corporation. Faurecia Exhaust Systems, which is a $2 billion subsidiary 
to France's Faurecia SA, is located in Toledo. Only Dana Holding Corporation 
still operates as an independent entity. Toledo is the Jeep headquarters 
and has two production facilities, Toledo Complex, one in the city and 
one in suburban Perrysburg. During World War II the city's economy boomed 
as its industries produced important products for the war effort, particularly 
the Willys Jeep.[41] Willys-Overland was a major automaker headquartered 
in Toledo until 1953. The many changes in industrial restructuring and 
loss of jobs caused the city to adopt new strategies related to retaining 
its industrial companies. It offered tax incentives to DaimlerChrysler 
for the expansion of its Jeep plant. In 2001, a taxpayer lawsuit was filed 
against Toledo that challenged the constitutionality of that action. In 
2006 the city won the case by a unanimous ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court 
in DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno. Although Toledo has a "rust belt" reputation 
because of its manufacturing history, in the 2000s, the city received significant 
interest and growth in "green jobs" due to economic development related 
to solar energy.[citation needed] The University of Toledo and Bowling 
Green State University received Ohio grants for solar energy research.[42] 
Xunlight and First Solar opened plants in Toledo and the surrounding area.[43] 
The Stranahan Theater is a concert hall located on the city's south side. 
The Toledo Opera has been presenting grand opera in the city since 1959. 
Its home is the historic Valentine Theatre Downtown. The Toledo Repertoire 
Theatre was created in 1933 and performs both Broadway hits and lesser-known 
original works. The Collingwood Arts Center is housed in a 1905 building 
designed by architect E. O. Fallis in the "Flemish Gothic" style. The parlor 
is used to showcase art exhibitions while the second and third floor rooms 
are rented to local artists. The Toledo Museum of Art is located in a Greek 
Revival building. The Peristyle is the concert hall in Greek Revival style 
in its East Wing; it is the home of the Toledo Symphony Orchestra, and 
hosts many international orchestras as well. The Museum's Center for Visual 
Arts addition was designed by Frank Gehry and opened in the 21st century. 
In addition, the museum's new Glass Pavilion across Monroe Street opened 
in August 2006. Toledo was the first city in Ohio to adopt a One Percent 
for Art program and, as such, boasts many examples of public, outdoor art.[44] 
A number of walking tours have been set up to explore these works, which 
include large sculptures, environmental structures, and murals by more 
than 40 artists, such as Alice Adams, Pierre Clerk, Dale Eldred, Penelope 
Jencks, Hans Van De Bovenkamp, Jerry Peart, and Athena Tacha.[45] The Ballet 
Theatre of Toledo provides an opportunity for area students to study ballet 
and perform their art.[46] John Denver recorded "Saturday Night In Toledo, 
Ohio," composed by Randy Sparks. He wrote it in 1967 after arriving in 
Toledo with his group and finding no nightlife at 10 p.m.[47] After Denver 
performed the song on The Tonight Show, Toledo residents objected. In response, 
the City Fathers recorded a song entitled "We're Strong For Toledo". Ultimately 
the controversy was such that John Denver cancelled a concert in Toledo 
shortly thereafter. But when he returned for a 1980 concert, he set a one-show 
attendance record at the venue, Centennial Hall, and sang the song to the 
approval of the crowd.[48] Toledo is the hometown of Corporal Maxwell Klinger 
in the long-running 1970s television series M*A*S*H. Actor Jamie Farr was 
from there, and writers gave his character the same home town, with frequent 
lines about the city during various episodes. Toledo is also featured as 
the hometown of the main protagonist, Captain Benjamin L. Willard, played 
by Martin Sheen in the Vietnam War film Apocalypse Now. In one scene with 
Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando, he discusses his home 
town. Jane Wyman's character, Helen St. John, is noted as being from Toledo 
in the Oscar-winning Best Picture of 1945,The Lost Weekend. In the film, 
her parents come from Toledo to New York to visit Helen and meet her boyfriend 
Don Birnam (Ray Milland), who spends the weekend drinking. The Kenny Rogers 
1977 hit song "Lucille" was written by Hal Bynum and inspired by his trip 
to Toledo in 1975.[49] Toledo is mentioned in the song "Our Song" by Yes 
from their 1983 album 90125. According to Yes drummer Alan White, Toledo 
was especially memorable for a sweltering-hot 1977 show the group did at 
Toledo Sports Arena.[50] The season 1 episode of the Warner Bros television 
series Supernatural "Bloody Mary" was set in Toledo.[51] Toledo is the 
setting for the 2010 television comedy Melissa & Joey, with the first-named 
character being a city councilwoman.[52] These higher education institutions 
operate campuses in Toledo: Toledo Public Schools operates public schools 
within much of the city limits, along with the Washington Local School 
District in northern Toledo. Toledo is also home to several public charter 
schools including two Imagine Schools. Additionally, several private and 
parochial primary and secondary schools are present within the Toledo area. 
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo operates Roman Catholic primary and 
secondary schools. Private high schools in Toledo include Maumee Valley 
Country Day School, Central Catholic High School, St. Francis de Sales 
High School, St. John's Jesuit High School and Academy, Notre Dame Academy, 
St. Ursula Academy (Ottawa Hills), Cardinal Stritch Catholic High School 
(Oregon), the Toledo Islamic Academy, Freedom Christian Academy, Toledo 
Christian Schools, Emmanuel Christian, the David S. Stone Hebrew Academy 
(Sylvania), Monclova Christian Academy, and Apostolic Christian Academy. 
The eleven-county Northwest Ohio/Toledo/Fremont media market includes over 
1 million residents.[citation needed] The Blade, a daily newspaper founded 
in 1835, is the primary newspaper in Toledo. The front page claims that 
it is "One of America's Great Newspapers." The city's arts and entertainment 
weekly is the Toledo City Paper. In March 2005, the weekly newspaper Toledo 
Free Press began publication, and it has a focus on news and sports. Other 
weeklies include the West Toledo Herald, El Tiempo, La Prensa, Sojourner's 
Truth, and Toledo Journal. Toledo Tales provides satire and parody of life 
in the Glass City. The Toledo Journal is an African-American owned newspaper. 
It is published weekly, and normally focuses on African-American issues.

interstate highways run through Toledo. Interstate 75 (I-75) travels north-south 
and provides a direct route to Detroit and Cincinnati. The Ohio Turnpike 
carries east-west traffic on I-80/90. The Turnpike serves Toledo via exits 
52, 59, 64, 71, and 81. The Turnpike connects Toledo to Chicago in the 
west and Cleveland in the east. In addition, there are two auxiliary interstate 
highways in the area. Interstate 475 is a 20-mile bypass that begins in 
Perrysburg and ends in west Toledo, meeting I-75 at both ends. It is cosigned 
with US 23 for its first 13 miles. Interstate 280 is a spur that connects 
the Ohio Turnpike to I-75 through east and central Toledo. The Veterans' 
Glass City Skyway is part of this route, which was the most expensive ODOT 
project ever at its completion. This 400-foot (120 m) tall bridge includes 
a glass covered pylon, which lights up at night, adding a distinctive feature 
to Toledo's skyline.[61] The Anthony Wayne Bridge, a 3,215-foot (980 m) 
suspension bridge crossing the Maumee River, has been a staple of Toledo's 
skyline for more than 70 years. It is locally known as the "High-Level 
Bridge." Local bus service is provided by the Toledo Area Regional Transit 
Authority; commonly shortened to TARTA. Toledo area Paratransit Services; 
TARPS are used for the disabled. Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound 
Lines whose station is located at Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza which it 
shares with Amtrak. Megabus also provides daily trips to Ann Arbor, Chicago, 
Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. Toledo has various cab companies within 
its city limits and other ones that surround the metro. Toledo Express 
Airport, located in the suburbs of Monclova and Swanton Townships, is the 
primary airport that serves the city. Additionally, Detroit Metropolitan 
Wayne County Airport is 45 miles north. Toledo Executive Airport (formerly 
Metcalf Field) is a general aviation airport southeast of Toledo near the 
I-280 and Ohio SR 795 interchange. Toledo Suburban Airport is another general 
aviation airport located in Lambertville, MI just north of the state border. 
Toledo had a streetcar system and interurban railways[62] linking it to 
other nearby towns but these are no longer in existence. Amtrak, the national 
passenger rail system, provides service to Toledo and other major cities 
under the Capitol Limited and the Lake Shore Limited. Both lines stop at 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza, which was built as Central Union Terminal 
by the New York Central Railroad—along its Water Level Route—in 1950. Of 
the seven Ohio stations served by Amtrak, Toledo was the busiest in fiscal 
year 2011, boarding or detraining 66,413 passengers.[63] Freight rail service 
in Toledo is operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway, CSX Transportation, 
Canadian National Railway, Ann Arbor Railroad, and Wheeling and Lake Erie 
Railway. All except the Wheeling have local terminals; the Wheeling operates 
into Toledo from the east through trackage rights on Norfolk Southern to 
connect with the Ann Arbor and CN railroads. The Division of Water Treatment 
filters an average of 80 million gallons of water per day for 500,000 people 
in the greater Toledo Metropolitan area.[64] The Division of Water Distribution 
serves 136,000 metered accounts and 10,000 fire hydrants and maintains 
more than 1,100 miles (1,800 km) of water mains.[65] In August 2014, two 
samples from a water treatment plant toxin test showed signs of microcystis. 
Roughly 400,000, including residents of Toledo and several surrounding 
communities in Ohio and Michigan were affected by the water contamination. 
Residents were told not to use, drink, cook with, or boil any tap water 
on the evening of August 1, 2014.[66] The Ohio National Guard delivered 
water and food to residents living in contaminated areas. As of 3 August 
2014[update], nobody had reported being sick and the governor had declared 
a state of emergency in three counties.[67][68] The ban was lifted on August 
4.[69] Toledo linked with Toledo, Spain as sister cities in 1931, creating 
the first Sister Cities relationship in North America. In total Toledo 
has twelve sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International
