José Miguel Cabrera Torres (born April 18, 1983), commonly known as Miguel 
Cabrera and nicknamed "Miggy", is a Venezuelan professional baseball first 
baseman who plays for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
Since his debut in 2003 he is a two-time American League (AL) Most Valuable 
Player (MVP) award winner, a four-time AL batting champion, and an eleven-time 
MLB All-Star. He has played at first and third base for most of his major 
league career, but primarily played left and right field before 2006. He 
claimed the 17th Major League Baseball Triple Crown in 2012,[1] the first 
to do so in 45 seasons. Cabrera was signed in 1999 as an amateur free agent 
by the Florida Marlins, and progressed through their minor league system. 
He made his Major League debut in mid-2003 at the age of 20, and contributed 
to the Marlins' World Series success later that year. Cabrera was a regular 
player for the Marlins over the next four seasons before being traded to 
the Detroit Tigers in late 2007. In 2012, Cabrera became the first player 
since 1967 to win the batting Triple Crown, leading the AL with a .330 
batting average, 44 home runs, and 139 RBI, earning him the AL MVP award 
that year. In 2013 Cabrera improved on the previous year's batting performance, 
including a career-high .348 batting average, and received another AL MVP 
award. Cabrera is widely regarded to be one of the best pure hitters in 
baseball, and one of the greatest players of his era, combining great power 
with a high batting average and good walk rate, along with a low strikeout 
percentage. He has hit 30 or more home runs during ten separate seasons, 
driven in over 100 runs in eleven consecutive seasons (2004–2014), and 
has a career .321 batting average – currently the highest among active 
players with at least five years of major league service. Cabrera has been 
praised for hitting many line drives and fly balls whilst maintaining a 
low pop-up rate, hitting the ball to all fields, and for his notable ability 
to drive inside pitches for home runs. Cabrera was born on April 18, 1983, 
in Maracay, Aragua State, Venezuela, to parents Miguel and Gregoria (née 
Torres) Cabrera. Miguel was signed by the Marlins in 1999 as an amateur 
free agent[2] and came up through their farm system, teaming with future 
major leaguers Adrian Gonzalez and Dontrelle Willis. He began his professional 
career in 2000 as a shortstop in the Gulf Coast League (GCL). After batting 
.260 with 10 doubles, two triples and two home runs through 57 games for 
the GCL Marlins, Cabrera was promoted to Class-A ball where he finished 
the final eight games batting .250 with 6 RBIs for the New York–Penn League 
(NYPL) Blue Sox in Utica, New York.[3] Heading into 2001, the Marlins bumped 
Cabrera up to the Low Class-A Kane County Cougars where he teamed up with 
current Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. He earned his 
way into the Futures Game during All-Star Weekend in Seattle, along with 
Gonzalez. He ended the year batting .268 with 30 extra-base hits, 66 RBIs, 
and distinguished himself as having the strongest arm in the Midwest League.[2] 
Entering the following season, Cabrera was once again promoted, this time 
to the Jupiter Hammerheads of the High Class-A Florida State League. At 
the request of then Marlins coach, Ozzie Guillén, Cabrera made the transition 
from shortstop to third base. By July, his average was locked in at .277, 
and he led his team with 45 RBI earning himself a second trip to the Future's 
game, where he collected two singles. He finished the season batting .278 
with 43 doubles and 75 RBIs. Up to this point, he hit just nine homers 
in his 489 at-bats.[2] To begin the 2003 season, Cabrera earned another 
promotion to the Double-A Carolina Mudcats. There he teamed up with Dontrelle 
Willis, the left-handed fireballer with whom he would later join in the 
majors. In his fourth professional season, Miguel was shredding the competition. 
In April, he hit .402, and by June his average stood at .365 with 10 homers 
and 59 RBIs before being called up to the majors.[2] Cabrera made his major 
league debut on June 20, 2003, at 20 years old; Édgar Rentería, at 19 years 
old, was the only Marlins player to make his debut at a younger age. Cabrera 
hit a walk-off home run in his first major league game, following Billy 
Parker in 1972 and Josh Bard in 2002 as the third player since 1900 to 
hit a game-winning home run in his big-league debut. Cabrera became the 
Marlins cleanup batter. Cabrera's postseason play helped propel Florida 
to a World Series championship over the New York Yankees and also landed 
him on the cover of ESPN The Magazine during the offseason. In the NLDS 
against the Giants, Cabrera hit .286 with three RBIs. After changing positions 
in the heat of the NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, he hit .333 with three 
homers and six RBIs. In game 4 of the 2003 World Series against the Yankees, 
Cabrera faced Roger Clemens for the first time in his career. In the first 
inning, Clemens threw a 92-mph fastball in the vicinity of Cabrera's chin 
causing Cabrera to turn and stare at Clemens. Later in the at bat, Cabrera 
hit a pitch to deep right field for a two-run home run.[4] The home run 
would give the Marlins an early 2–0 lead en route to a 4–3 Marlins victory 
that evened the series at two games apiece.[5] Cabrera and the Marlins 
would go on to win the 2003 World Series in 6 games.[6] In his first season 
Cabrera batted .268 (84-for-314), with 12 home runs, 62 RBIs, 39 runs, 
21 doubles, and three triples in 87 games played and received NL Rookie 
of the Month honors for both July and September. In 2004, he batted .294 
with 33 home runs, 112 RBIs, 101 runs, 177 hits, a .366 on-base percentage, 
a .512 slugging percentage from the third and fourth spots in the order, 
while playing in 160 games and earning his first All-Star appearance. Cabrera 
spent the entire 2004 season playing in the outfield and had 13 outfield 
assists. In 284 total fielding chances, he committed nine errors (tied 
for the most among NL outfielders)[7] and made 262 putouts. In 2005 he 
was second in the National League in hits with 198, and batted .323 with 
33 home runs, 43 doubles, two triples, and 116 RBIs. He was voted to his 
second consecutive All-Star Game along with teammates Paul Lo Duca and 
Dontrelle Willis, and won his first Silver Slugger Award. His 33 home runs 
made him the youngest player in Major League Baseball history with back-to-back 
30 homer seasons, at 22 years, 143 days. Albert Pujols did it at 22 years, 
223 days. Cabrera also became the first Marlin in history to hit at least 
30 home runs and drive in at least 100 runs in back-to-back seasons.[citation 
needed] Prior to the 2006 season, Cabrera represented Venezuela in the 
inaugural World Baseball Classic. the Venezuelan team finished seventh 
in the tournament. With help from teammates Josh Willingham and Dan Uggla 
hitting behind and ahead of him respectively, Cabrera finished the year 
with a .339 batting average, 26 home runs and 114 RBIs. He was selected 
to his third consecutive All-Star Game and won his second Silver Slugger 
Award. On June 22, 2006, pitcher Todd Williams let the first pitch of an 
attempted intentional walk get too close to the plate and Cabrera reached 
out and singled it to right center field. The hit occurred during 10th 
inning, scoring the winning run to give the Marlins a 6–5 lead over the 
Baltimore Orioles.[8] During a July 9, 7–6 road loss to the New York Mets, 
Cabrera became involved in an altercation with teammate Scott Olsen. With 
the Marlins trailing 2–0, Mets catcher Paul Lo Duca hit a hard grounder 
that glanced off Cabrera's glove and rolled into left field, allowing a 
run to score as Lo Duca raced to second with a double. As they came off 
the field, Olsen could be seen shouting something at Cabrera. A moment 
later, television cameras showed Cabrera in the crowded dugout reaching 
past teammates to poke his finger at Olsen as the pitcher walked past him. 
Olsen tried to jab back at Cabrera, who charged Olsen and tried to kick 
the pitcher before both players were quickly separated by teammates.[9] 
Cabrera was voted to represent the National League All-Stars for the 3rd 
time in his career and made his first appearance in the Home Run Derby. 
Cabrera finished in third place with 15 home runs in the event. Cabrera 
battled the Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Freddy Sanchez for the National 
League batting crown until the last day of the regular season. Marlins 
manager Joe Girardi decided to bat Cabrera leadoff for the final game of 
the season to give him more chances to get a hit for the crown. He ended 
up finishing second to Sanchez. Cabrera also finished the 2006 campaign 
with a .568 slugging percentage and a .430 on-base percentage. On February 
17, 2007, Cabrera became the first player of the 2007 offseason to win 
his arbitration hearing, obtaining a one-year contract worth $7.4 million.[10] 
Cabrera made his fourth consecutive All-Star game. He was initially scheduled 
to participate in the Home Run Derby during the All-Star weekend, but an 
injured left shoulder, suffered a few days before the All-Star break, forced 
him out of the derby and limited him in the All-Star game to a pinch hit 
at-bat against Dan Haren in which he struck out. On September 4, 2007, 
Cabrera recorded his 500th RBI as a major leaguer, making him the third-youngest 
player to accumulate 500 RBIs. Hall of Famers Mel Ott and Ted Williams 
were the only players to precede him in this feat.[11] On September 15, 
2007, in a game against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Cabrera drove 
in at least 100 runs for the fourth consecutive year. His 100th RBI came 
in the first inning against Ubaldo Jiménez. Five innings later, Cabrera 
added four more RBIs when he hit a ball 438 feet (134 m) into the center 
field trees for his first career grand slam.[12] He joined David Ortiz, 
Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, Mark Teixeira, Bobby Abreu and Vladimir 
Guerrero as the only players to reach the 100-RBI plateau in each of the 
four previous seasons.[13] In 2007, Cabrera won the NL Player of the Week 
twice (April 1–8 and June 4–10). He also passed former Marlins Gary Sheffield 
and Derrek Lee for second on the franchise home run list. He moved into 
third in all-time franchise RBIs and first in batting average. Cabrera 
ended the season with career highs in both home runs and runs batted in. 
On December 5, 2007, the Marlins traded Cabrera and starting pitcher Dontrelle 
Willis to the Detroit Tigers for pitchers Andrew Miller, Dallas Trahern, 
Eulogio De La Cruz and Burke Badenhop, outfielder Cameron Maybin, and catcher 
Mike Rabelo.[14] On March 22, 2008, Cabrera reached an agreement with the 
Tigers on an eight-year, $152.3 million contract extension. At the time, 
the deal was the fourth-largest in baseball history, behind those signed 
by Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, and Manny Ramirez.[15] The deal was also 
the largest in Tigers history at the time, surpassing the five-year, $75 million 
contract signed by Magglio Ordóñez in 2005 (it was later surpassed in 2012 
when Prince Fielder signed a 9-year, $214 million deal) Cabrera earned 
$11.3 million in 2008, and will receive an average of $20 million per year 
through 2015. Cabrera made his Tigers debut on March 31, 2008, playing 
third base in a home game against the Kansas City Royals. In his third 
at-bat, he hit a solo home run off Royals pitcher Gil Meche. He finished 
the game 1-for-5 with two strikeouts, and the Tigers lost 5–4 in 11 innings.[16] 
On April 22, manager Jim Leyland announced that Cabrera would be moving 
to first base, with Carlos Guillén becoming the starting third baseman. 
Cabrera had already made seven appearances at first, the first appearances 
at the position of his career.[17] Cabrera was named the AL Player of the 
Month for July after batting .330 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs.[18] 
On September 7, Cabrera reached the 1,000-hit plateau on a home run off 
Twins pitcher Glen Perkins.[19] Cabrera finished the 2008 season with a 
career-high 37 home runs, which led the American League.[20] He became 
the youngest AL home run champion since Troy Glaus in 2000.[21] He also 
established a new career high in RBIs (127).[2] He became one of only six 
players who have driven in at least 100 runs in each of the past five seasons, 
joining Alex Rodriguez, Albert Pujols, David Ortiz, Bobby Abreu and Mark 
Teixeira. Cabrera was selected to play for Venezuela at the 2009 World 
Baseball Classic, along with Tigers teammates Magglio Ordóñez, Carlos Guillén, 
and Armando Galarraga. On Opening Day, Cabrera hit a grand slam in left-center 
that traveled more than 420 feet (130 m) at Comerica Park to give the Detroit 
Tigers a 15–2 victory over the Texas Rangers. Cabrera finished the game 
4-for-6 with six RBIs. On August 23, 2009, Cabrera hit his 200th career 
home run in his 1,000th career game against the Oakland A's. He became 
only the fourth Venezuelan player to ever reach that plateau. Cabrera posted 
a .324 batting average, which was fourth in the AL. He also tied his career-high 
in hits with 198, which was also fourth among the AL. He also had yet another 
100-plus RBI season making it the sixth straight year for him to reach 
the 100 RBI mark. On May 28 in a game against the Oakland Athletics in 
Detroit, Cabrera hit three home runs in a 5–4 Tigers loss. Two of the home 
runs were against starter Ben Sheets, and one against closer Andrew Bailey. 
It was the first three home run game in Cabrera's career, and came in his 
first game returning to the team after his daughter's birth. Cabrera was 
named an AL All-Star for the first time since joining the American League, 
and the fifth time in his eight-year career. He was chosen to be the starter 
in place of Minnesota Twins star Justin Morneau who was suffering a concussion. 
Cabrera also participated in the Home Run Derby, finishing fourth in the 
event with 12 home runs. On September 26 in a game against the Cleveland 
Indians Cabrera suffered a high ankle sprain while getting back to first 
base on a pick-off attempt. He initially tried to play, but the Tigers 
decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season. He ended his 
2010 season with a .328 batting average, a career-high 38 home runs and 
126 RBIs. The lack of a strong #5 hitter to follow Cabrera in the Tigers 
lineup also resulted in him drawing a career-high 89 walks, which included 
an AL-leading 32 intentional passes. On defense, he led all AL first basemen 
in errors, with 13.[22] Cabrera was named to his second AL All-Star team 
as a reserve, his sixth All-Star Game appearance overall. On July 15, 2011, 
the first game after the All-Star break, Cabrera collected his 1500th career 
hit, in a game against the Chicago White Sox.[23] Cabrera hit for a .344 
average, winning the AL batting title, while also leading the AL in on-base 
percentage (.448) and doubles (48). He had his eighth straight 100-RBI 
season (105) and fifth straight 30-HR season (30). He also reached a career-high 
in walks with 108. On defense, Cabrera led all AL first basemen in errors, 
with 13.[22] Cabrera hit .429 with six home runs and 21 RBIs in September 
2011, propelling the Tigers into the playoffs and eventually the American 
League Championship Series. In the first five games of the ALCS, Cabrera 
had a .565 OBP, as well as a home run and four doubles, one of them off 
the third base bag. Through 2011, he had the sixth-best career batting 
average of all active players (.317), and seventh-best slugging percentage 
(.555) and OPS (.950).[24] In 2012, after the signing of first baseman 
Prince Fielder, the Tigers announced Cabrera would move back to third base.[25] 
In a pre-season game with the Philadelphia Phillies and Hunter Pence batting, 
Cabrera was struck by a ground ball below the right eye, which broke a 
bone. Despite this, after seeing the team's orbital surgeon, Dr. Srinivas 
Iyengar, Cabrera believed he would be ready for opening day on April 5.[26] 
He was, and was in the starting lineup on Opening Day. On April 7, he and 
new teammate Prince Fielder each hit two home runs against the Red Sox, 
including back-to-back ones in the fifth inning.[27] That week, from April 
4–8, Cabrera was named AL Player of the Week, his ninth time achieving 
that honor, five of them being with Detroit. Cabrera hit 5–11 in three 
games over that span with three home runs and eight RBI.[28] On April 27, 
Cabrera collected his 1,000th RBI in a game against the Yankees. He is 
one of the few players in league history to reach this plateau before their 
30th birthday, joining Hank Aaron, Albert Pujols and Lou Gehrig.[citation 
needed] Cabrera was named to the American League All-Star team as a reserve, 
as Rangers third baseman Adrián Beltré was voted as a starter. This marked 
Cabrera's third consecutive All-Star appearance as a member of the Tigers, 
and seventh appearance overall.[29] On July 22, he hit his 300th career 
home run off White Sox starter Philip Humber. This made Miguel just the 
second Venezuelan-born player to reach this milestone, joining Andrés Galarraga 
who hit 399.[30] On August 15, Cabrera became the first player in Detroit 
Tigers history to hit 30 home runs in five consecutive seasons, passing 
Hank Greenberg (1937–40) and Cecil Fielder (1990–93), who each had four 
consecutive 30 home run seasons.[31] This also marked the eighth time in 
the last nine seasons overall that Cabrera has reached the 30 home run 
mark. Cabrera was voted the American League Player of the Month for August 
after batting .357 with six doubles, eight home runs, 24 RBI, 19 runs scored 
and 12 walks in 26 games. This was the second time that Cabrera was named 
player of the month for the Tigers as he joined Alan Trammell as the only 
Tigers to win the award more than once.[32] Cabrera won the Triple Crown, 
finishing the season with an AL-leading .330 batting average, plus 44 home 
runs and 139 RBIs which led all of Major League Baseball. He became the 
first batter to win a Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.[33] 
Cabrera became the first player to win it without a tie in any of the three 
categories since Frank Robinson in 1966. He is the first Latin American 
player and the first third baseman to win a Triple Crown. Cabrera also 
had his first career 200-hit season, having hit safely 205 times.[34] He 
was named The Sporting News Player of the Year.[35] On October 27, 2012 
he was awarded the AL Hank Aaron Award.[36] Cabrera also led the AL in 
slugging (.606), OPS (.999), total bases (377), and hitting into double 
plays (28). In Game 4 of the 2012 World Series, Cabrera hit his first World 
Series home run since his rookie year with the Marlins in 2003, putting 
Detroit on the board for the first time in 2 games. During the bottom of 
the 10th inning, Cabrera was the final out of the World Series as he struck 
out looking, completing the San Francisco Giants' sweep of the Tigers. 
On November 15, Cabrera was named the AL's Most Valuable Player over Mike 
Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, receiving 22 out of 28 first place votes 
and 362 points from a panel of Baseball Writers' Association of America.[37] 
Baseball Hall of Famer Al Kaline was quoted in 2013 as saying that Cabrera's 
performance was "unbelievable", and that Cabrera was already qualified 
for Cooperstown himself."[38] Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports called 
Cabrera "the greatest player in the game of baseball." Barry Bonds agreed 
with Nightengale's analysis, adding ""He's the best. By far. Without a 
doubt. The absolute best.'"[39] Cabrera continued a torrid pace into the 
2013 season, being named American League Player of the Month for May. Cabrera 
batted .379 (44-for-116) with nine doubles, 12 home runs, 33 RBIs, 23 runs 
scored and 15 walks in 28 games to claim his third career Player of the 
Month Award. Cabrera previously won top player honors in July 2008 and 
August 2012.[40] The week of August 5–11, Cabrera was named the American 
League Co-Player of the Week, with fellow Tigers teammate Austin Jackson. 
Cabrera batted .429 (12-for-28) with two doubles, four home runs, 11 RBIs 
and seven runs scored over seven games, to win his 10th career player of 
the week award.[41] As of the 2013 All-Star break, Miguel was hitting .365 
with 30 home runs and a league-leading 95 RBIs, considerably better than 
his 2012 Triple Crown season at the same point.[42] Cabrera became the 
first player in MLB history to have at least 30 home runs and 90 RBIs before 
the All-Star break. Cabrera was voted in as the starter at third base for 
the first time in the fan balloting for the 2013 Major League All-Star 
Game.[43] Cabrera won the ESPY Award in 2013 for Best MLB Player.[44] On 
July 9, 2013, he hit his 350th career home run, against the Chicago White 
Sox. On August 18, Cabrera hit his 40th home run of the season in a game 
against the Kansas City Royals, joining Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx as the 
only MLB players in history to have at least 40 home runs, 120 RBIs and 
a batting average of .350 or higher through 116 games. Cabrera also became 
the third Tigers player in history to hit 40 or more home runs in consecutive 
seasons, joining Hank Greenberg (1937–38) and Cecil Fielder (1990–91).[45] 
Cabrera was named the American League Player of the Month for August. Cabrera 
batted .356 (36-for-101) with five doubles, 11 home runs, 31 RBIs, 17 runs 
scored and 13 walks in 27 games to claim his fourth career Player of the 
Month Award and his second of the 2013 season, after claiming the award 
in the month of June.[46] Following the All-Star Break, Cabrera suffered 
injuries including a groin strain that limited his playing time later in 
the season. Cabrera finished the regular season with a .348 batting average, 
and won his third straight AL batting title. Cabrera became the first Tiger 
to win three consecutive batting titles since Ty Cobb (1917–1919), and 
the first American Leaguer to win at least three straight since Wade Boggs 
(1985–88).[47] He also led the AL in on-base percentage (.442) and slugging 
percentage (.636), was second in the league in home runs (44), RBIs (137) 
and runs scored (103), and was third in walks (90).[48] On October 24, 
Cabrera was honored with his second consecutive Sporting News MLB Player 
of the Year Award. He is only the fourth player in history to win this 
award in back-to-back seasons, joining Ted Williams (1941–42), Joe Morgan 
(1975–76) and Albert Pujols (2008–09).[49] On November 14, Cabrera won 
his second consecutive American League MVP Award, receiving 23 out of 30 
first place votes and 385 points. Cabrera became the first American League 
player to win back-to-back MVP awards since Frank Thomas of the Chicago 
White Sox (1993–1994).[50] He is only the third Tiger player to win the 
MVP award more than once, joining Hank Greenberg (1935, 1940) and Hal Newhouser 
(1944–45).[51] With the departure of Prince Fielder via trade, the Tigers 
announced that Cabrera would return to first base for the 2014 season.[52] 
On March 28, 2014, the Tigers announced that Cabrera had signed an 8-year 
contract extension worth $248 million. Combined with the $44 million the 
Tigers owed on the remaining two years of Miguel's current contract, the 
total 10-year commitment is worth $292 million. This deal broke the previous 
record commitment of $275 million the New York Yankees tendered to Alex 
Rodriguez in 2007. Cabrera's contract has since been surpassed by Giancarlo 
Stanton's 13-year, $325 million contract in 2014, the largest contract 
in sports.[53][54] Many analysts criticized the contract as excessive and 
short-sighted, with The Washington Post calling it "the worst." [55][56] 
On April 4, in a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Cabrera hit a two-run 
home run to notch his 2,000th career hit, becoming the ninth player to 
reach 2,000 hits before his 31st birthday and the seventh-youngest to reach 
the mark.[57] On July 6, it was announced that Cabrera had won the fan 
voting to start at first base for the American League at the 2014 All-Star 
Game. This was his ninth All-Star selection overall, and second straight 
as a starter.[58] In the first inning of the All-Star game, Cabrera hit 
a 2-run home run off National League starting pitcher Adam Wainwright. 
It was his first career All-Star game home run.[59] Cabrera won the ESPY 
Award for Best MLB Player for a second year in a row in 2014.[60] On September 
7, Cabrera recorded his 100th RBI of the season, reaching the milestone 
for the 11th consecutive season. Cabrera is only the fifth player in major 
league history to accomplish this feat, joining Lou Gehrig (13 seasons), 
Jimmie Foxx (13 seasons), Alex Rodriguez (13 seasons) and Al Simmons (11 
seasons).[61] Cabrera was named the AL co-player of the week for the week 
of September 1–7. Cabrera batted .500 (15-for-30) with two doubles, five 
home runs, nine RBI and eight runs scored in seven games to win his 11th 
career player of the week award. He led the major league in hits, home 
runs, total bases (32), and slugging percentage (1.067), tied for first 
overall in runs scored, and tied for second in RBI.[62] Cabrera was named 
the American League Player of the Month for September. Cabrera batted .379 
(39-for-103) with 10 doubles, eight home runs, 18 RBI, 39 hits, and 19 
runs scored in 26 games to claim his fifth career Player of the Month Award. 
Cabrera led the league with a .737 slugging percentage and a 1.118 OPS.[63][64] 
Cabrera finished the regular season with a .313 batting average, 25 home 
runs, 109 RBI and a league-leading 52 doubles; he led both leagues with 
11 sacrifice flies.[65] Along with Matt Holliday in 2014, Cabrera attained 
at least 20 HR, 30 doubles, 75 RBI and 80 runs scored each for the ninth 
consecutive season, becoming just the fourth player in MLB history to do 
so. The others previously to have accomplished this were Stan Musial, Manny 
Ramirez, and Pujols, all with ten consecutive seasons.[66] On October 23, 
Cabrera was announced as a finalist for the American League Gold Glove 
Award for first base. This marks the first time he was nominated for the 
accolade. The other two nominees for the award included Albert Pujols and 
the defending Gold Glove winner Eric Hosmer,[67] with Hosmer eventually 
winning the award for 2014 as well. On October 24, Cabrera underwent surgery 
to remove a bone spur in his right ankle that had been bothering him for 
several months. He also had a procedure to repair a stress fracture in 
the navicular bone near the top of his right foot.[68] Doctors knew about 
the bone spurs, but said the discovery of the broken bone was a surprise. 
Cabrera himself said he wasn't surprised, stating, "I was feeling a lot 
of pain. I knew something was wrong." He said he had to alter his swing 
mechanics the last half of the 2014 season, being unable to put weight 
on his back foot without pain.[69] Cabrera was named the AL player of the 
week for the week of April 5–12. Cabrera batted .520 (13-for-25) with two 
doubles, two home runs, eight RBIs and four runs scored over six Tigers 
victories to win his 13th career player of the week award. He led the league 
in total bases (21), hits (13) and on-base percentage (.586), was tied

October 3, 2009, police were called to the Cabreras' home and took Cabrera 
in for questioning. Cabrera had come home at 6:00am, after a night of drinking 
at the nearby Townsend Hotel, and got in an argument with his wife. He

any alcohol since he was taken into custody in October 2009, and that he 
would continue his treatment into spring training and the regular season.[100]
