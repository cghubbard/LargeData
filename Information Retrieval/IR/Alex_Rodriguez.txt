Alexander Emmanuel "Alex" Rodriguez (born July 27, 1975), nicknamed "A-Rod", 
is an American professional baseball shortstop, third baseman and designated 
hitter who is currently a free agent. He has played 22 seasons in Major 
League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers and New York 
Yankees. Rodriguez was one of the sport's most highly touted prospects 
and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time.[1][2][3] 
During his 22-year career, Rodriguez has amassed a .297 batting average, 
696 home runs, over 2,000 runs batted in (RBI), over 2,000 runs scored, 
and over 3,000 hits. He is a 14-time All-Star and has won three American 
League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten Silver Slugger Awards, 
and two Gold Glove Awards. Rodríguez is the career record holder for grand 
slams with 25. However, he has led a highly controversial career due to 
signing two of the most lucrative sports contracts in history while incurring 
criticism from the media for his behavior, and use of illegal performance-enhancing 
drugs.[4][5] The Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 
MLB draft, and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the 
age of 18. In 1996, he became the Mariners' starting shortstop and finished 
second in voting for the AL MVP Award. Rodriguez's combination of power, 
speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left 
the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 
10-year, $252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history. 
He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by 
his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs 
during his tenure. Prior to the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the 
Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman due to incumbent shortstop 
Derek Jeter. In his first four seasons with New York, he was twice more 
named AL MVP. After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season, 
Rodriguez signed a new 10-year, $275 million deal with the Yankees, extending 
his record for the sport's most lucrative contract.[6] He became the youngest 
player ever to hit 500 home runs, reaching the milestone in 2007. He won 
his first championship in 2009, and the following year, he became the career 
leader in home runs by a player of Hispanic descent.[7] In recent years, 
Rodriguez has been hampered by hip and knee injuries, which have caused 
him to exclusively become a designated hitter.[8] He played his final game 
as a Yankee on August 12, 2016, but has not officially retired. In February 
2009, after previously denying use of performance-enhancing drugs, including 
during a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes, Rodriguez admitted 
to using steroids, saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for 
Rangers due to "an enormous amount of pressure" to perform.[4][5] While 
recovering from a hip injury in 2013, Rodriguez made headlines by feuding 
with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained 
performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal. 
In August 2013, MLB suspended him 211 games for his involvement in the 
scandal, but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment.[9] 
Had the original suspension been upheld, it would have been the longest 
non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history.[10] After an 
arbitration hearing, the suspension was reduced to 162 games, keeping him 
off the field for the entire 2014 season.[11] Rodriguez was born in the 
Washington Heights section of New York City, to a Dominican family. When 
he was four, Rodriguez and his parents moved to the Dominican Republic, 
then to Miami, Florida. Rodriguez's favorite baseball players growing up 
were Keith Hernandez, Dale Murphy, and Cal Ripken Jr., and his favorite 
team was the New York Mets.[12] At the end of Alex's freshman year at Christopher 
Columbus High School, he transferred to Westminster Christian School, where 
he was a star shortstop on the baseball team and played quarterback on 
the football team.[12] In 100 games he batted .419 with 90 steals. Westminster 
went on to win the high school national championship in his junior year. 
He was first team prep All-American as a senior, hitting .505 with nine 
home runs, 36 runs batted in (RBIs), and 35 stolen bases in 35 attempts 
in 33 games. He was selected as the USA Baseball Junior Player of the Year 
and as Gatorade's national baseball student athlete of the year. In 1993, 
Rodriguez became the first high school player to ever try out for the United 
States national baseball team. He was regarded as the top prospect in the 
country.[citation needed] Rodriguez signed a letter of intent to play baseball 
for the University of Miami and was also recruited by the university to 
play quarterback for its football team. Rodriguez turned down Miami's baseball 
scholarship and never played college baseball, opting instead to sign with 
the Seattle Mariners after being selected in the first round of the 1993 
amateur draft at the age of 17.[13] The Seattle Mariners selected Rodriguez 
with the first overall selection of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.[13] 
The Mariners signed Rodriguez to a three-year contract worth $1.3 million, 
and a $1 million signing bonus.[14] Rodriguez made his professional debut 
in 1994 in Minor League Baseball with the Appleton Foxes of the Class A 
Midwest League.[15] He was promoted to the Jacksonville Suns of the Class 
AA Southern League. He played in 17 games for Jacksonville, and was promoted 
to the major leagues.[16] Rodriguez made his major league debut as the 
starting shortstop on July 8, 1994, at 18 years, 11 months, and 11 days 
of age.[17] He was just the third 18-year-old Major League shortstop since 
1900.[18] He was also the first 18-year-old Major League player in 10 years, 
and the youngest position player in Seattle history.[citation needed] His 
first Major League hit was a single off of Sergio Valdez on July 9 at Fenway 
Park.[19] Rodriguez played in 17 games for the Mariners, compiling a .204 
batting average, two RBIs, and three stolen bases. The Mariners optioned 
Rodriguez to the Calgary Cannons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League 
(PCL) in August.[20][21] In 32 games for Calgary, he had 37 hits in 119 
at-bats for a .311 batting average. He also compiled six home runs and 
21 RBIs.[22] Rodriguez split most of 1995 between the Mariners and the 
Tacoma Rainiers of the PCL.[23] He connected for his first Major League 
home run off Kansas City's Tom Gordon on June 12. Rodriguez joined the 
Major League roster permanently in August, and got his first taste of postseason 
play, albeit in just two at-bats. Again, he was the youngest player in 
Major League Baseball.[citation needed] During the 1995 season, Rodriguez 
played in 48 games batting .232 with 5 home runs, 19 RBI, and 4 stolen 
bases. The following year, Rodriguez took over as the Mariners' regular 
shortstop and led the American League (AL) with a .358 batting average. 
He also had 36 home runs with 123 RBIs.[24] the highest for an AL right-handed 
batter since Joe DiMaggio hit .381 in 1939 and the 3rd highest ever for 
a shortstop. At 21 years and one month, he was the 3rd youngest AL batting 
leader ever behind Al Kaline (20) in 1955 and Ty Cobb (20) in 1907, and 
the 3rd youngest player in history with 35+ homers. He was also the first 
major league shortstop to win a batting title since 1960, and the first 
in the AL since 1944. At 20 years, 11 months, he was the youngest shortstop 
in All-Star Game history. He also led the AL in runs (141), total bases 
(379), and doubles (54) and ranked among the league leaders in base hits 
(2nd, 215), extra base hits (2nd, 91), multi-hit games (3rd, 65), slugging 
(4th, .631), RBI (8th, 123), and on-base percentage (8th, .414). Rodriguez 
posted the highest totals ever for a shortstop in runs, hits, doubles, 
extra base hits, and slugging, and tied most total bases, and established 
Seattle club records for average, runs, hits, doubles, and total bases, 
in a season that statistical analysts consider the best ever by a shortstop.[25] 
The Sporting News and Associated Press selected Rodriguez as their Major 
League Player of the Year. He finished second to Juan González in balloting 
for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He finished three points behind 
González (290–287), matching the second closest AL MVP voting in history.[26] 
In 1997, Rodriguez had a .300 batting average with 23 home runs with 84 
RBIs. He hit for the cycle on June 5,[27] becoming the second Mariner, 
and at 21 years, 10 months, the fifth youngest player in history, to accomplish 
the feat. He was the fan's choice to start the All-Star Game at shortstop 
for the AL team, becoming the first player other than Ripken to start at 
shortstop in 13 years. It was the first All-Star start of his career and 
his second All-Star Game in two years.[28] Rodriguez rebounded in 1998, 
setting the AL record for homers by a shortstop and becoming just the third 
member of the 40–40 club, (with 42 home runs and 46 stolen bases) and one 
of just 3 shortstops in history to hit 40 home runs in a season. His 43.9 
Power-speed number was, through at least 2008, the highest single season 
Power/Speed Number ever.[29] He was selected as Players Choice AL Player 
of the Year,[30] won his second Silver Slugger Award,[31] and finished 
ninth in the MVP voting.[32] In 1999, Rodriguez had a .310 average, 42 
home runs, and 111 RBIs,[17] despite missing over 30 games with an injury 
and playing the second half of the season at Safeco Field,[33] a considerably 
less hitter-friendly ballpark than the Kingdome.[34] At the time, he was 
the youngest-ever player to achieve 100 home runs and 100 stolen bases, 
at 23 years and 309 days of age.[35] In April 2015, Mike Trout reached 
the same milestone at 23 years and 253 days old.[35] Rodriguez entered 
2000 as the cornerstone player of the Mariners franchise,[citation needed] 
which had recently traded superstars Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr.[36] 
Rodriguez put up great numbers as the team's remaining superstar, hitting 
41 HR with 132 RBIs and a .316 batting average.[17] He set a career high 
for walks (100) and became the only shortstop to have 100 runs, RBI, and 
walks in the same season.[37] He hit well in the playoffs as well (.409 
batting average and .773 slugging percentage),[17] but Seattle lost to 
the New York Yankees in the 2000 American League Championship Series.[38] 
He was selected as the Major League Player of the Year by Baseball America 
and finished third in the AL MVP voting.[39] Rodriguez became a free agent 
after the 2000 season. He eventually signed with the Texas Rangers, who 
had fallen to last in their division in 2000. The contract he signed was 
at the time the most lucrative contract in sports history: a 10-year deal 
worth $252 million. The deal was worth $63 million more than the second-richest 
baseball deal.[40] It was highly criticized at the time for tying up valuable 
payroll space that could have been spent in improving other areas, such 
as pitching.[41][42] In an article written eight years later in the New 
York Daily News, Rodriguez said how he regretted signing with the Texas 
Rangers and wished he had signed with the New York Mets rather than Texas. 
Rodriguez stated that he had listened to his agent Scott Boras about taking 
more money instead and did not want to make the same mistake of not being 
on a team he liked playing for by leaving the Yankees. (see Opt out controversy).[43] 
Rodriguez's power hitting numbers improved with his move to Texas. In his 
first season with the Rangers, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive 
seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 HR, 133 
runs scored, and 393 total bases.[17] He became the first player since 
1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop 
to ever lead his league in homers, and was just the second AL player in 
the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, 
and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league 
shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers 
and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks' 
record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than 
a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidt's mark of 48 in 1980.[44] 
It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. 
He also tied for the league lead in extra base hits (87) and ranked third 
in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in 
hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). 
He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and 
hit by pitches, had the 2nd most extra base hits, and the fourth-highest 
RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, 
and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), 
and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and 
total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the DH, 
the only major league player to start all of his team's games in 2001. 
Rodriguez followed the previous year with a major league-best 57 HR, 142 
RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002,[17] becoming the first player to lead 
the majors in all three categories since 1984. His nine home runs in April 
matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Iván Rodríguez 
(2000), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). He had the 6th-most 
home runs in AL history, the most since Roger Maris' league record 61 in 
1961, and the most ever for a shortstop for the 2nd straight year. He won 
the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers that season.[45] 
He also won his first Gold Glove Award, awarded for outstanding defense. 
His 109 home runs in 2001–02 are the most ever by an American League right-handed 
batter in consecutive seasons. However, the Rangers finished last in the 
AL Western division in both years, a showing that likely cost Rodriguez 
the MVP award in 2002 when he finished second to fellow shortstop Miguel 
Tejada, whose 103-win Oakland A's won the same division. In 2003, his last 
season with Texas, Rodriguez led the American League in home runs, runs 
scored, and slugging percentage, and won his second consecutive Gold Glove 
Award. He also led the league in fewest at bats per home run (12.9) and 
became the youngest player to hit 300 homers. He was tied with Jim Thome 
for the MLB lead in homers, and he won his second Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[46][47] 
Following five top-10 finishes in the AL MVP voting between 1996 and 2002, 
Rodriguez won his first MVP trophy. Rodriguez, a two-time runner up in 
the balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, joined outfielder 
Andre Dawson from the 1987 Chicago Cubs as the only players to play on 
last-place teams and win the award.[citation needed] Following the 2003 
season, Texas set out to move Rodriguez and his expensive contract. The 
Rangers initially agreed to a trade with the Boston Red Sox, but the Major 
League Baseball Players Association vetoed the deal because it called for 
a voluntary reduction in salary by Rodriguez. Despite the failed deal with 
the Red Sox, the Rangers named him team captain during that off-season.[citation 
needed] Yankees third baseman Aaron Boone suffered a knee injury while 
playing a game of pickup basketball that sidelined him for the entire 2004 
season, creating a hole at third base.[48] On February 15, 2004, the Rangers 
traded Rodriguez to the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano 
and a player to be named later (Joaquín Árias was sent to the Rangers on 
March 24). The Rangers also agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million 
left on Rodriguez's contract. Rodriguez agreed to switch positions from 
shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade, because the popular 
Derek Jeter was already entrenched at shortstop. Rodriguez also had to 
switch uniform numbers, from 3 to 13; he had worn 3 his entire career, 
but that number is retired by the Yankees in honor of Babe Ruth. During 
his first season with the Yankees, Rodriguez hit .286 with 36 home runs, 
106 RBIs, 112 runs scored and 28 stolen bases.[17] He became one of only 
three players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 
100 runs and 100 RBIs in seven consecutive seasons, joining Hall of Famers 
Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx. The 112 runs marked the ninth straight season 
in which he scored at least 100 runs, the longest such streak in the Major 
Leagues since Hank Aaron did it in 13 straight seasons from 1955 to 1967, 
and the longest in the American League since Mickey Mantle did it also 
in nine straight seasons from 1953 to 1961. During the 2004 season, he 
also became the youngest player ever to reach the 350 HR mark and the third 
youngest to reach the 1,000 RBI plateau. He was elected to the 2004 American 
League All-Star Team, the eighth All-Star selection of his career and the 
first as a third baseman. On July 24, 2004, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch 
from Bronson Arroyo, which led to a scuffle with Boston Red Sox catcher 
Jason Varitek and a bench-clearing brawl between both teams. On defense, 
he had the lowest range factor among non-platoon AL third basemen (2.39) 
in his first year at the position.[49] He finished 14th in balloting for 
the AL MVP Award.[citation needed] In the 2004 ALDS, Rodriguez was a dominant 
hitter against the Minnesota Twins, batting .421 and slugging .737 while 
delivering two key extra-inning hits. Following the series win, Rodriguez's 
first season with the Yankees culminated in a dramatic playoff series against 
the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees' bitter rival, 
the Boston Red Sox. In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season 
record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston. One of the most controversial 
plays of Rodriguez's career occurred late in Game 6 of the 2004 American 
League Championship Series. With one out and Derek Jeter on first base 
in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between 
the pitcher's mound and the first base line. Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo 
fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached 
towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As 
the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez 
took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. 
However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out 
for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, and his run was nullified.[50] 
The Yankees would then lose the ALCS to the eventual World Series champion 
Red Sox after leading the series 3 games to none. In 2005, Rodriguez hit 
.321, leading the American League with 124 runs and 48 HR while driving 
in 130 runs.[17] He became the first Yankee to win the American League 
home run title since Reggie Jackson (41) in 1980. He also became one of 
only two players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 
100 runs and 100 RBIs in eight consecutive seasons (Jimmie Foxx accomplished 
the feat in nine straight seasons from 1932 to 1940). Rodriguez established 
the franchise record for most home runs in a single season by a right-handed 
batter (broke Joe DiMaggio's mark of 46 in 1937). His 47 HR from the third 
base position are a single-season American League record. Rodriguez hit 
26 home runs at Yankee Stadium in 2005, establishing the single-season 
club record for right-handed batters (previously held by DiMaggio in 1937 
and Gary Sheffield in 2004). On June 8, at 29 years, 316 days old, he became 
the youngest player in MLB history to reach the 400 HR mark. 2005 also 
marked the tenth straight season that Rodriguez scored at least 100 runs. 
On defense, however, he had the lowest range factor in the league at third 
for the second straight season (2.62).[51] On April 26, Rodriguez hit three 
home runs off Angels' pitcher Bartolo Colón and drove in 10 runs. The 10 
RBIs were the most by a Yankee since Tony Lazzeri established the franchise 
and American League record with 11 on May 24, 1936. Rodriguez became the 
11th major leaguer to accomplish the feat.[52] Rodriguez won his second 
AL MVP Award in three seasons. Of both the MVP and its precursor, the "League 
Award", Rodriguez became the fifth player to win with two different teams, 
joining Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Frank Robinson and Barry Bonds. Rodriguez 
was also named the shortstop on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends 
Team in 2005. Prior to the season Rodriguez opted to play for Team USA 
in the World Baseball Classic.[53] Rodriguez was again an All-Star in 2006. 
His 2,000th hit, on July 21, 2006 − six days prior to his 31st birthday 
− was also his 450th home run. Rodriguez became the youngest player in 
baseball history to reach 450 home runs (surpassing Ken Griffey, Jr., by 
267 days), and the eighth player to reach 2,000 hits before turning 31. 
Ty Cobb reached the mark while still 29, while Rogers Hornsby, Mel Ott, 
Hank Aaron, Joe Medwick, Jimmie Foxx, and Robin Yount all achieved their 
2,000th hit at age 30. All seven are members of baseball's Hall of Fame. 
For the season, Rodriguez finished fourth in the league in RBI (121), fifth 
in runs scored (113), eighth in home runs (35) and walks (90), and ninth 
in OBP (.392). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 24, and 
had the lowest fielding percentage (.937) and – for the third straight 
season – range factor (2.50) among them.[17]Rodriguez also became the second 
player in Major League history to record at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, 
and 100 RBIs in nine consecutive seasons, joining Foxx. It was Rodriguez's 
11th consecutive season with more than 100 runs scored, the longest such 
streak in American League history since Lou Gehrig did so in 13 straight 
seasons (1926–38). Despite this success, it was perceived as one of his 
lesser-accomplished seasons and was harshly criticized throughout the 2006 
season. He has commented that 2006 was his most difficult season as a professional.[54] 
In 2007, Rodriguez reported to camp having reduced his body fat from 16% 
the year before to 9%. He made light of this fact during a Late Show with 
David Letterman sketch filmed during Spring training, which featured him 
shirtless being rubbed down with suntan lotion. He revealed to the press 
that he and Jeter were no longer close friends.[55] Rodriguez also reduced 
his high leg kick at the plate, increasing his bat speed, making him less-apt 
to strike out and a more dangerous hitter.[56] In the Yankees' fourth game 
of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs against the Baltimore Orioles 
at Yankee Stadium, including his 14th-career grand slam to end the game. 
The walk-off grand slam was the third of his career, tying the major league 
mark for game-ending grand slams shared by Vern Stephens and Cy Williams.[57][58] 
Rodriguez also began the season by becoming the ninth major leaguer—and 
first Yankee—to hit six home runs in the first seven games of the season. 
Rodriguez also became the first Yankee to hit seven home runs in the first 
ten games of the season.[59] On April 23, Rodriguez became the first player 
in major league history to hit 14 home runs in a span of 18 games, and 
also tied the MLB record for most home runs in April. His total of 34 RBIs 
in April was one short of Juan González' AL and MLB record.[citation needed] 
In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 30, Rodriguez sparked controversy 
when he shouted during a routine play and an infielder let a pop fly drop, 
costing the Blue Jays three runs. The Yankees went on to win the game, 
10–5.[60] On July 12, Rodriguez hit his 150th career home run in a Yankees 
uniform. This made him the first, and so far only, player in major league 
history to ever hit 150 home runs for three different teams.[61] He became 
the third player to hit at least 100 home runs for three teams, following 
Reggie Jackson and Darrell Evans.[62] Rodriguez hit his 500th career home 
run against pitcher Kyle Davies of the Kansas City Royals on August 4. 
Rodriguez became the youngest player ever to reach 500 homers (32 years, 
8 days). He is only the second Yankee to hit number 500 at home; Mickey 
Mantle on May 14, 1967 against Stu Miller was the other.[citation needed] 
On September 25, Rodriguez became the fifth player ever in major league 
history to record a 50-home run, 150-RBI season when he hit a grand slam. 
Derek Jeter was one of the first of his teammates to congratulate him.[63] 
In 2007, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to have 
at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in 10 consecutive seasons, 
surpassing Jimmie Foxx (9 consecutive seasons). He led the AL in home runs 
(54), RBIs (156), slugging percentage (.645), OPS (1.067), total bases 
(376), and times on base (299), and was 2nd in hit by pitch (21), extra 
base hits (85), and at bats per home run (10.8), 4th in on-base percentage 
(.422) and sacrifice flies (9), 7th in walks (95) and plate appearances 
(708), 8th in intentional walks (11), and 9th in games (158).[17] He led 
MLB in home runs and won his third Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[64] After 
the season, Rodriguez was named the AL MVP for the third time in his career, 
receiving 26 first-place votes out of a possible 28.[65] He also won the 
Silver Slugger Award for his position,[66] the Players Choice Award for 
Outstanding AL Player, and the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year.[citation 
needed] The 2007 season marked the last year of Rodriguez's 10-year, $252 million 
contract before he opted out, effectively making him a free agent again. 
Rodriguez had repeatedly stated during the 2007 season that he would like 
to remain a Yankee for the rest of his career.[67] On October 28, 2007, 
Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, announced that he would not renew his contract 
with the Yankees citing that he "was unsure of the future composition" 
of the team. He received a slew of criticism from fans and writers alike 
not only for opting out, but also for not meeting with Yankee management 
before he did. He was further criticized for the timing of his announcement, 
during the eighth inning of Game Four of the World Series, as the Boston 
Red Sox were wrapping up their victory over the Colorado Rockies; even 
MLB's chief operating officer, Bob DuPuy, called it an attempt by Boras 
to "try to put his selfish interests and that of one individual player 
above the overall good of the game."[68] Teammate Mariano Rivera convinced 
Rodriguez to contact the New York Yankees ownership.[69] He contacted them 
directly, bypassing Boras (Boras also apologized for the timing of the 
announcement). Subsequently, Rodriguez issued a statement on his website, 
saying that he wished to stay with the Yankees.[70] On November 15, 2007, 
the New York Yankees and Rodriguez agreed on the "basic framework" of a 
10-year, $275 million contract that would have him playing until he is 
42.[71] The contract, finalized December 13, includes various multimillion-dollar 
incentives for breaking career home run milestones.[72] In a September 
3, 2008, game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Rodriguez hit his 549th home 
run. The opposing manager objected that the ball was foul, and for the 
first time in MLB history, instant replay (a process officially introduced 
a few days earlier) was used to review the play and uphold the umpires' 
ruling.[73] He was one of only four batters in the AL to have at least 
18 home runs and 18 stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with Torii 
Hunter, Ian Kinsler, and Grady Sizemore. Rodriguez hit a home run every 
14.6 at-bats in 2008, the second best ratio on the team behind Jason Giambi.[74] 
Rodriguez played 138 games during the 2008 season with a .302 average, 
35 home runs, 103 RBI, and an AL best .573 slugging percentage. On February 
7, 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez tested positive for 
testosterone and the anabolic steroid Primobolan in 2003.[75] Rodriguez's 
name appears on a government-sealed list of 104 major-league players (out 
of 1200 tested[76]) who came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs. 
The report was compiled as part of Major League Baseball's 2003 survey 
to see whether mandatory random drug testing program might be necessary. 
At the time, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive steroid 
test. Rodriguez did not immediately confirm the allegations, deferring 
at first to the players' union.[75][77] Two days after the allegations, 
Rodriguez admitted to steroid use from 2001 until 2003, claiming that he 
ceased using such substances after spring training that year.[4][5] Rodriguez 
was to represent the Dominican Republic prior to the 2009 season in the 
2009 World Baseball Classic, but was forced to withdraw when an MRI revealed 
a cyst in his right hip. When he went to have the cyst drained, it was 
discovered that he was also suffering from a torn labrum in the same hip. 
Rodriguez opted to undergo an arthroscopic procedure with a recovery period 
of six to nine weeks, instead of the usual three to four months.[78] Although 
the procedure should allow him to make it through the season without any 
complications, he will require a second, more extensive surgery in the 
off-season.[78] After missing spring training and the first month of the 
season, Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on May 8 against the Baltimore 
Orioles and hit a three-run home run on the first pitch of his first at 
bat. Having stumbled to a 13–15 record in Rodriguez' absence, his return 
fortified the lineup and provided much needed protection for three-hole 
hitter Mark Teixeira, who was a notoriously slow starter. Rodriguez also 
supplied some late-game heroics. On May 16, his two-run walk-off home run 
in the bottom of the eleventh inning gave the Yankees a 6–4 win over the 
Minnesota Twins. One week later, he hit a game-tying solo home run in the 
bottom of the ninth off Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge in a game 
the Yankees would go on to win, 5–4. By early June, the Yankees surged 
to first place in the AL East. Fortunes changed later in the month, as 
Rodriguez fell into a slump that saw his batting average plummet and the 
Yankees fell to second place. On June 23, Rodriguez became the eighth active 
player to reach 8,000 career at-bats in the seventh inning of the Yankees 
and Braves game.[79] On June 25, Rodriguez belted homer 563 of his career, 
off Atlanta Braves starter Derek Lowe, and tying Reggie Jackson for 11th 
on the all-time home run list.[80] On June 26, Rodriguez surpassed Jackson 
for 11th on the all-time home run list, against the New York Mets in the 
Subway Series,[81] and against the Angels on July 11, Rodriguez passed 
Rafael Palmeiro for 10th place;[82] it was his 65th home run against Anaheim, 
the most by any active player against an opponent. On October 4, 2009, 
during the final game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs in the 
sixth inning that drove in seven runs, setting an American League record 
for most RBI by a batter in a single inning, and giving him his 12th consecutive 
season, 13 overall, of reaching 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie 
with Manny Ramirez, Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx for the most in MLB history.[83] 
Dating back to Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series, Rodriguez had 
batted with 38 runners on base over a span of 61 postseason at-bats. He 
stranded every one of them, going 0-for-29 with runners on base.[84] However, 
in the first game of the 2009 ALDS against Minnesota, he hit two RBI singles 
− both coming with two outs. In Game 2, he hit an RBI single in the sixth, 
and hit a game-tying homer off closer Joe Nathan in the bottom of the ninth 
inning. In Game 3, he again hit a game-tying home run. In the ALCS, Rodriguez 
hit his third game-tying HR of the postseason in Game 2 in the bottom of 
the 11th against Angels closer Brian Fuentes.[85] For the series, he batted 
9–21 (.429) with three home runs and six runs batted in. The Yankees faced 
the Phillies in the World Series. In Game 3, Rodriguez hit what appeared 
to be a double off a camera perched atop the outfield wall, but after protest 
by Yankee manager Joe Girardi, the play was reviewed and ruled a home run. 
In Game 4, Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run with two outs in the 9th 
inning off of closer Brad Lidge. The Yankees would go on to win the game 
7–4 to take a 3-games-to-1 lead in the series. Despite a 2–4 performance 
with three RBI in Game 5, the Yankees lost 8–6 to force the Series to return 
to the Bronx for Game 6. Rodriguez was 1–2 with 2 walks and two runs scored 
in Game 6, as the Yankees went on to defeat the Phillies 7–3 for their 
27th World Series Championship, the first of Rodriguez's career. Having 
reversed his postseason misfortunes, he was the Babe Ruth Award winner 
as the 2009 postseason MVP,[86] in which he batted .365 with six home runs 
and 18 RBI.[87] On August 4, 2010, on the 3-year anniversary of his 500th 
home run, Rodriguez became the seventh player in major league history to 
hit 600 home runs, hitting number 600 off of Shaun Marcum of the Toronto 
Blue Jays, becoming the youngest player to do so at 35 years and 8 days 
old. On August 14, A-Rod hit three home runs in a game against the Kansas 
City Royals. In the top of the 6th, he hit his first, a solo dinger to 
left center. In the top of the 7th, he hit his second, a two-run shot to 
dead center. In the top of the 9th, he hit his third, a towering two-run 
blast into the waterfall in Kauffman Stadium.[88] On September 6, he recorded 
his 100th RBI; it was the 14th year he had reached the mark, the most times 
of any player in baseball history. On Sep 29, he hit his 30th home run 
of the season, recording his major league record 13th straight year of 
at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Jimmie Foxx, who 
had 12 seasons. In 2011, Rodriguez batted .295 with 13 home runs and 52 
RBIs prior to the All-Star break. Despite good production, Rodriguez suffered 
his longest single season home run drought of his career by not hitting 
one in 85 at-bats. Although elected to start the game, Rodriguez opted 
for arthroscopic surgery on his knee to repair a torn meniscus that impacted 
his power, and was placed on the disabled list.[89] On top of recovery, 
Rodriguez was facing serious allegations that he participated in illegal, 
underground poker games. One of those games reportedly turned violent and 
cocaine was openly used. However, Rodriguez denied through a representative 
that he ever participated in illegal poker games. An MLB Executive has 
said that if Rodriguez was indeed proven guilty, he may face a suspension, 
MLB had warned Rodriguez in 2005 not to participate in such games.[90] 
Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on August 21, playing third base against 
the Minnesota Twins, going 0-for-4. He sustained another injury with a 
jammed thumb while trying to make a play in that game. He returned to the 
Yankees on August 25, going 2-for-4 with 2 singles in a win for the Yankees 
over the Oakland Athletics. On August 26, A-Rod hit his first home run 
since coming off the disabled list, a solo shot off Baltimore Orioles pitcher 
Tommy Hunter. He concluded the season with 16 home runs and 62 RBIs in 
99 games, ending his major league-record streak of 13 straight seasons 
of 30 homers and 100 RBIs.[91] Rodriguez hit his 23rd career grand slam 
off Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Jonny Venters on June 12, 2012, tying 
Lou Gehrig for the most in MLB history.[92] In a road loss versus the Seattle 
Mariners on July 24, 2012, Rodriguez took a hit to the hand during an eighth 
inning at bat versus Seattle starting pitcher Félix Hernández. The injury 
was later described as a non-displaced fracture.[93] Rodriguez was placed 
on the disabled list. Earlier in the same game, Hernandez struck out Rodriguez 
in the sixth inning, making Rodriguez the fifth player to record 2,000 
career strikeouts in MLB history.[93] During the 2012 postseason, Rodriguez 
was pinch hit for and did not start multiple times. He batted 3-for-25 
overall, and went 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts against right-handed pitchers.[94] 
He batted .111 in the 2012 ALCS.[95] The Yankees lost to the Tigers in 
the 2012 ALCS. On January 16, 2013, Rodriguez underwent arthroscopic surgery 
in his hip to repair a torn labrum. It was the second time in four years 
that he had the surgery, although this operation was more serious than 
before. Rodriguez began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list.[96] 
While rehabilitating his hip, Rodriguez was embroiled in a series of negative 
headlines: he became a central figure of the Biogenesis baseball scandal 
and MLB's investigation into his possible connection to performance-enhancing 
drugs;[97] additionally, after Rodriguez announced on Twitter that his 
doctor had medically cleared him to play in games, Yankees general manager 
Brian Cashman responded that Rodriguez's doctor did not have such authority 
and that Rodriguez should "shut the fuck up".[98] Rodriguez played his 
first rehab assignment game on July 2, 2013 with the Yankees Class-A Low 
affiliate, the Charleston RiverDogs.[99] He continued his rehabilitation 
and played for the Yankees Triple-A team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders 
on July 18.[100] Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major 
league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed 
a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue 
rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a second 
opinion on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there 
did not appear to be an injury; the Yankees were incensed by his decision, 
saying that he violated league rules for seeking a second opinion without 
the team's permission.[101] He completed his rehabilitation program with 
the Yankees' Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder.[102] Rodriguez made his 
2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 on the same day MLB announced 
he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, for his 
role in the Biogenesis scandal.[103] On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first 
home run of the season off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander.[104] 
With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career 
RBIs.[105] Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following 
his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher 
S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's 
legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued 
to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine 
told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never 
played again.[106] In response to the accusations, Cashman said, "I'm not 
comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious 
environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it." He added, "It's not just 
Yankees' management. He's putting it at the level of our trainers, our 
medical staff. The organization. The team."[107] During a game against 
the Red Sox on August 18, 2013, Rodriguez was involved with key moments 
against Ryan Dempster. The first time he faced Dempster, Rodriguez was 
hit by a pitch on a 3-0 count, leading to home plate umpire Brian O'Nora 
warning both benches and ejecting Girardi while Dempster was allowed to 
stay in the game. Later in the top of the 6th inning, Rodriguez hit a 442-foot 
home run to straightway center off of Dempster. The Yankees won 9-6 and 
Dempster, who hit Rodriguez before, was suspended 5 games by the MLB with 
an undisclosed fine. On September 20 at Yankee Stadium, Rodriguez hit his 
24th career grand slam, an opposite field 654th career home run, off of 
George Kontos of the San Francisco Giants, breaking the all-time grand 
slam record, formerly held by Lou Gehrig.[108] For the 2013 season, Rodriguez 
played in only 44 games batting .244 with 7 home runs and 19 RBI. Rodriguez's 
suspension that was announced the previous season but delayed pending an 
appeal, was upheld for the entirety of the 2014 regular season and postseason. 
He was found to have violated the league's Performance Enhancing Drugs 
policy, specifically through the "use and possession of numerous forms 
of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone 
and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years" and "attempting 
to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct 
intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner's investigation."[109] 
At the end of the 2014 season, Yankees GM Brian Cashman announced Rodriguez 
would no longer be an everyday third baseman after the team's signing of 
free agent Chase Headley, and would instead become a designated hitter.[8] 
In the off-season, during the week of January 19, 2015, it was reported 
that Rodriguez met with new Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred, resulting 
in a "positive discussion, lasting 10 minutes in which Rodriguez apologized, 
while promising to behave in the future".[110] On February 17, 2015, Rodriguez 
issued a hand-written letter of apology to "Major League Baseball, the 
Yankees, the Steinbrenner family,[who?] the Players Association and you, 
the fans".[111] Rodriguez reported to New York Yankees' 2015 spring training 
camp three days early.[112][113][114] Girardi planned to play Rodriguez 
at first base during spring training to assess whether he could be played 
there, a first for his career.[115][116] Rodriguez played his first game 
after his suspension on opening day against the Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. 
He served as the designated hitter, going 1 for 2 with a walk as the Yankees 
lost to the Blue Jays 1–6.[117] On April 17, his first multi-HR game – 
and third and fourth home runs – of the season included a blast off Nate 
Karns of Tampa Bay that traveled 471 feet (144 m), providing four total 
RBIs in a 5–4 win.[118] In a pinch-hit appearance against the Red Sox on 
May 1, Rodriguez hit his 660th career home run off of reliever Junichi 
Tazawa, tying Willie Mays for fourth place on the all-time home run list.[119] 
On May 7, Rodriguez hit his 661st career home run off of Orioles pitcher 
Chris Tillman for sole possession of fourth place on the all-time home 
run list.[120] On May 27, Rodriguez set an AL record for the most career 
RBI, passing Lou Gehrig, also moving him into third on the all-time list.[121] 
With his 666th career home run against Bud Norris of the Orioles on June 
13, Rodriguez drove in his 2,000th and 2,001st career runs. However, opinions 
varied on whether he was the second (Elias Sports Bureau, trailing Aaron), 
third (MLB, trailing Aaron and Ruth),[122] or fourth player (Baseball-Reference.com, 
trailing Aaron, Ruth, and Cap Anson) in MLB history to attain 2,000 RBIs.[123] 
Rodriguez' next home run was also his 3,000th career hit, making him the 
29th player to reach the milestone. He hit it against the Tigers' Justin 
Verlander in a 7–2 win, joining Wade Boggs and Jeter – both former Yankees 
– as the only players to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit.[124] With 
his next hit on June 20, Rodriguez surpassed Roberto Clemente on the all-time 
MLB hit list.[125] On July 25, against the Twins in Minnesota, and two 
days before his 40th birthday, Rodríguez became the fifth-oldest player 
to hit three home runs in one game.[126] In his first 95 games of the season, 
Rodriguez hit 24 homers and produced an OPS of .930.[127] After being mired 
in a 72-at-bat slump without a home run until August 18 against the Twins, 
he hit his 25th home run which was also his 25th career grand slam, extending 
his major league record. The home run also drove in the go-ahead runs for 
an 8–4 Yankees win.[128] From August 1 until the end of the season, Rodriguez 
appeared in 56 games, batting .191, .678 OPS, nine home runs, and struck 
out 59 times in 183 at-bats.[127] The first base experiment yielded two 
total appearances in 2015.[129] He finished with 33 home runs, 86 RBI, 
131 hits, and a .252 batting average. He led the Yankees in home runs, 
on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, and bases-on-balls. 
Rodriguez reached 30+ home runs for the 15th time in his career, tying 
Aaron for the most 30-home-run seasons in history.[130] On April 17, 2016, 
Rodriguez became the 19th player to make 12,000 career plate appearances. 
On May 4, the Yankees placed him on the 15-day disabled list due to a right 
hamstring strain.[131] On May 24, the Yankees sent him on a rehab assignment 
to the Double-A Trenton Thunder,[132] and activated him on May 26.[133] 
The next day, he hit his 30th career home run at Tropicana Field, which 
traveled an estimated 440 feet (130 m), as the Yankees defeated Tampa Bay, 
4–1.[134] However, for much of the season, Rodriguez notably struggled 
to adequately produce, enduring prolonged slumps as his role dwindled from 
everyday designated hitter to pinch hitter. In July, he had two extra base 
hits, including his 696th career home run.[135] At a press conference held 
on Sunday, August 7, Rodriguez announced that he would play in his final 
game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays 
at Yankee Stadium. In the offseason, he will then join the Yankees' front 
office as a special advisor for 2017.[136] The club commemorated Rodriguez' 
final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his 
efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation 
of a framed number 13 jersey and a base autographed by teammates.[137][138] 
At the plate, he batted third and started as the DH, going 1-for-4 with 
an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third 
base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 
2016[139] − and departed the field to a "raucous ovation" from the fans.[137] 
The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release.[140] On 
August 15, 2016 many rumors traveled around the majors. The Miami Marlins 
were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron 
Berkowitz emailed the media and said on behalf of Alex “I want to put all 
this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season,’’ Ron Berkowitz 
emailed the media. “It’s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is 
happy and he is going to take some time to relax and hang with his family 
and friends.”[141] Due to the unsuccessful nature of the Yankees postseasons 
from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez's sub-.200 batting average in the 
postseasons of 2005 and 2006,[17] Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York 
area, both from writers, such as the New York Post's Joel Sherman, and 
players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi.[142][143] Prior to 2009, 
Rodriguez had received the nickname "The Cooler" among some players because 
of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and 
hot when he leaves.[144][145][146][147] According to Yankee manager Joe 
Torre's 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname "A-Fraud" 
from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said 
to resent his demands.[148] "It was [said] in front of him", Torre later 
said of the nickname. "A lot of that stuff that went on in the clubhouse 
was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff", he explained.[149] Much of the 
criticism regarding Rodriguez focuses on his alleged inability to produce 
hits in clutch situations.[150][151] In 2008, Rodriguez hit only .264 with 
runners in scoring position and two outs. In 95 plate appearances, he walked 
20 times and was hit by three pitches, and he had only 19 hits. Of the 
41 times A-Rod struck out with two outs, 20 came with runners in scoring 
position.[74] Because of the Yankees' successful history, he was compared 
unfavorably to other Yankees greats who have performed exceptionally well 
in the postseason, such as Reggie Jackson.[152][153][154][155][156][157] 
However, after his performance in the 2009 postseason, A-Rod started receiving 
many positive comparisons to Reggie Jackson, even being selected as "Mr. 
October" by Jackson and USA Today.[158] Rodriguez answered many of the 
criticisms of his postseason performance by performing exceptionally well 
in the 2009 postseason, where he posted a .365 BA and hit six home-runs 
in 52 at-bats during the Yankees' 15 post-season games.[159] In July 2007, 
former outfielder and steroid-user Jose Canseco said that he was planning 
to publish another book about Major League Baseball, to follow his 2005 
bestseller Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball 
Got Big. Canseco said his new book would have "other stuff" on Rodriguez, 
and called him a hypocrite.[160] At the time, Rodriguez denied accusations 
of steroid use.[161] In a 2007 interview with Katie Couric, Rodriguez flatly 
denied ever having used performance-enhancing drugs.[162] In February 2009, 
Selena Roberts and David Epstein of Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez 
had tested positive for two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, 
during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in 
which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, 
broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year),[163] and earned one 
of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information had been part of a government-sealed 
report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested)[76] 
who tested positive for performance enhancers during a 2003 drug survey. 
Approved by the players themselves with the promise of anonymity,[76] the 
survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory 
drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, as the result of 
a collectively bargained union agreement,[76] there was no penalty or punishment 
for a positive test.[75][164] Because more than 5% of the samples taken 
from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league 
baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations.[77] The 
2003 test results were supposed to remain anonymous and the samples destroyed. 
However, a coded master list of 104 players was seized during the BALCO 
investigation, turning up in a 2004 federal raid on Comprehensive Drug 
Testing's facility in Long Beach, California. A month later, the physical 
samples were seized by federal agents raiding Quest Diagnostics in Las 
Vegas, Nevada.[77] The list of the 104 positive-testing players was released 
to the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in 2004.[4] The 
players' union later said that the 104 positive samples were in the process 
of being destroyed when they were subpoenaed by federal authorities in 
November 2003, making continued destruction "improper."[165] Although testosterone 
is available by prescription for some uses, Primobolan has no approved 
prescription use.[75] Also known as methenolone or metenolone enanthate, 
it is the same steroid that Barry Bonds is alleged to have tested positive 
for in 2000 and 2001.[77] A fairly weak steroid on its own, it is generally 
used in conjunction with other steroids.[166] The drug is generally preferred 
in injected rather than oral form due to its cost.[166] An official statement 
by Major League Baseball made shortly after Rodriguez's test results became 
public expressed "grave concern" without naming Rodriguez, noting that 
"because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be 
non-disciplinary and anonymous, we can not make any comment on the accuracy 
of this report as it pertains to the player named."[167] In an interview 
with ESPN after the report came out, citing "an enormous amount of pressure 
to perform", Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances from 2001 to 
2003.[4] "All my years in New York have been clean", he added, saying he 
has not used banned substances since last taking them following a spring 
training injury in 2003 while playing for the Rangers.[4][5] "Back then, 
[baseball] was a different culture", Rodriguez said. "It was very loose. 
I was young, I was stupid, I was naïve. And I wanted to prove to everyone 
that I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time. I did take 
a banned substance. And for that, I am very sorry and deeply regretful."[4][5] 
Rodriguez said he could not be sure of the name(s) of the substance(s) 
he had used.[4][5] Rodriguez said he was never told that he was among the 
104 players who tested positive, only that a tip came in August 2004 from 
Gene Orza of the MLBPA that he "may or may not have" failed his 2003 test.[4] 
Orza is accused by three (unnamed) MLB players of tipping Rodriguez to 
an upcoming drug test in September 2004. Orza and the MLBPA have denied 
the allegations.[168] Rodriguez absolved the players' union of any blame 
for leaking his positive test results, saying he alone was responsible 
for his mistakes.[4] Friend and former teammate Doug Glanville, while noting 
the outrage over Rodriguez's years of steroid use, berated Rodriguez's 
critics for their "lack of outrage about how a confidential and anonymous 
test could be made public."[76] No Major League player, Glanville wrote, 
would have participated in the 2003 survey if he had thought the results 
had even a chance of becoming public. "It has everything to do with privacy. 
Being A-Rod should not change that fact."[76] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig 
briefly considered whether or not to punish Rodriguez for his admitted 
steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. 
However, at the time of the testing there were no punishments for this 
sort of activity.[169] Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid 
use could be damaging to his image and legacy.[5] Later in the month, Rodriguez 
called a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and in the presence of many 
supportive Yankee teammates, answered reporters' questions about his 2001–2003 
steroid use.[162][170] Rodriguez said he and a cousin (whom he refused 
to name) bought an unidentified drug over-the-counter in the Dominican 
Republic, where it is "known on the streets as boli or bollee."[162][171] 
At Rodriguez's instruction, the cousin transported the drug into the United 
States.[172] For six months of the year, Rodriguez injected himself twice 
monthly with "boli" (a drug name unfamiliar to experts and perhaps a slang 
term for Primobolan or Dianabol, although the latter steroid is taken orally).[162] 
Rodriguez said he did not know whether he was using the drug properly or 
whether it was safe.[162] Although he "certainly felt more energy", Rodriguez 
said it would be "hard to say" whether it gave him a competitive edge.[170] 
Rodriguez said he would become a spokesperson for the Taylor Hooton foundation, 
which educates young people about the dangers of steroid use.[162][170] 
He has since spoken at schools about the dangers of steroids.[173] On February 
28, 2010, the New York Times reported that Rodriguez received treatment 
from Canadian sports doctor Anthony Galea in March 2009.[174] In 2011 Galea 
reached a plea agreement for bringing unapproved and mislabled drugs into 
the United States, including human growth hormone (HGH) and Actovegin. 
Galea confirmed to the Associated Press that he treated Rodriguez but said 
he only prescribed anti-inflammatories.[175] Rodriguez reportedly received 
HGH from Biogenesis of America, an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida 
run by Bosch.[176] For much of the summer, it had been expected that Rodriguez 
would be suspended for his role in the scandal. The first definitive confirmation 
came on August 3, when MLB rebuffed the players' union's last-minute offer 
to negotiate. Instead, it gave Rodriguez until the afternoon of August 
4 to reach an agreement regarding a suspension or greater punishment for 
his role in the Biogenesis affair.[177] Ultimately, on August 5, 2013, 
MLB suspended Rodriguez from August 8 through the end of the 2014 season 
for violating the league's PED policy, a total of 211 regular-season games 
plus any postseason games. He was one of 13 players suspended for their 
roles in the scandal.[178] In its official statement, MLB said the punishment 
was based on Rodriguez's "use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited 
performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth 
Hormone, over the course of multiple years" and "for attempting to cover-up 
his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended 
to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner's investigation."[179] 
Although the standard punishment for a first offense under MLB's drug policy 
is 50 games, MLB had the option of suspending Rodriguez for longer than 
that under the collective bargaining agreement if it determined his actions 
constituted conduct detrimental to baseball.[180] Almost immediately after 
the suspension was announced, Rodriguez announced he would appeal. He was 
the only player to do so; the others accepted season-ending 50-game suspensions 
without appeal.[181] Although Selig had the option of using his best-interests-of-baseball 
powers to remove Rodriguez from the field immediately, he chose to suspend 
Rodriguez under the drug agreement and not the CBA, allowing Rodriguez 
to continue playing while the appeal was underway. The proposed suspension 
would effectively ban him from playing in Nippon Professional Baseball 
and the Korea Baseball Championship, as the leagues in those nations honor 
any suspensions imposed by MLB.[109] Rodriguez hired New York criminal 
defense lawyer Joe Tacopina.[182] On January 11, 2014, following a lengthy 
arbitration process, the suspension was upheld. However, since Rodriguez 
was allowed to play during the appeal process, this effectively reduced 
the suspension to 162 games – the entirety of the 2014 regular-season schedule. 
Because Rodriguez was on the restricted list on midnight of August 31, 
the suspension would have included the postseason if the Yankees qualified. 
He subsequently issued a statement saying he would be challenging the decision 
in federal court.[11] On February 7, 2014 Rodriguez announced that he was 
dropping his lawsuit and accepting his suspension for the 2014 season.[183] 
In March 2014, multiple sources reported that Rodriguez was refusing to 
pay the balance of his legal fees for his defense, which amounted to over 
$3 million.[184][185] In July 2014 Rodriguez was in fact sued by his lawyers 
for $380,000 in unpaid legal fees.[186][187] In November 2014, it was revealed 
that Rodriguez had admitted to the Drug Enforcement Administration in January 
that he had used performance-enhancing drugs.[188] This was contrary to 
his sentiments 18 days earlier, vehemently denying any allegations and 
HGH use. Rodriguez grew up with two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, who were 
born in the Dominican Republic and are children from his mother's first 
marriage.[189] Rodriguez also has a half-brother, Victor M. Rodriguez, 
who was born to Alex's father Victor Sr. and his then-wife Pouppe Martinez 
in 1960.[189] The couple divorced a year later, and Victor Jr. was raised 
by his mother.[189] Victor Jr., who is an officer in the United States 
Air Force, fell out of touch with Alex for a period of 23 years, until 
they met at a Texas Rangers game in 2003.[189] In 2002,[190] he married 
Cynthia Scurtis,[190] a psychology graduate[191] he had met at a gym in 
Miami, Florida.[192] The couple's first child, Natasha Alexander, was born 
on November 18, 2004. On April 21, 2008, Cynthia gave birth to their second 
child, Ella Alexander,[193] in Miami, Florida. On May 27, 2007, the New 
York Post reported that Rodriguez spent an evening in Toronto with a blonde 
woman, later identified as Joslyn Noel Morse, a longtime exotic dancer.[194] 
The New York Post ran a picture on May 30, 2007. Rodriguez and the woman 
identified as Morse had dinner together at a steakhouse and then went to 
a strip club before returning to Rodriguez's hotel. They were last seen 
alone together that night boarding the hotel elevator. Morse refused to 
say whether they had sex.[195] On July 2, 2008, the New York Daily News 
reported that Rodriguez and his wife had separated, after having "problems" 
for the past three months, since the birth of their second daughter.[196] 
This came together with rumors published in Us Weekly magazine, about a 
possible affair between Rodriguez and pop singer Madonna,[197] claims Madonna 
denied by saying they were "just friends."[198] Cynthia Rodriguez filed 
for divorce on July 7, 2008, citing "emotional abandonment" of her and 
their children, as well as "extra marital [sic] affairs and other marital 
misconduct" by her husband.[199][200] She sought alimony, distribution 
of assets, child support including private school tuition, life and health 
insurance, her car, reimbursement of legal fees, and retention of the couple's 
$12-million marital home in Coral Gables, Florida.[199][201][202] Alex 
Rodriguez countered that his wife was only entitled to what they had agreed 
to in their prenuptial agreement from 2002. Additionally, while conceding 
their marriage was "irretrievably broken", Rodriguez requested that all 
allegations of his "extramarital affairs" be stricken from court records. 
The couple settled their divorce in September 2008.[203] More evidence 
of Rodriguez's infidelity continued to appear in the media after his wife 
filed for divorce. On July 9, 2008, the New York Daily News reported that 
Candice Houlihan, a Boston-area hairdresser who previously worked as a 
stripper, told the paper that she and Rodriguez had sex on two occasions 
in 2004 when Rodriguez was in town playing against the Boston Red Sox.[204] 
On March 22, 2009, the Daily News reported that, during 2006 and 2007, 
Rodriguez had patronized prostitutes of madam Kristin M. Davis and dated 
Davis as well, according to employees of Davis' call-girl agency. Davis 
would not confirm or deny any sexual relationship with Rodriguez, saying, 
"Throughout the years, there were a number of clients that I befriended 
and it was not uncommon for them to want the women they can't have whether 
it be the phone bookers or the madam. In regard to Alex, all I can say 
is our paths have definitely crossed personally and professionally." Employees 
of the call-girl agency provided the Daily News intimate emails between 
Rodriguez and Davis, including one in which Rodriguez confesses to Davis 
his preference for her over one of her call-girls. When confronted with 
the emails, Davis told the newspaper, "Other people have had access to 
my client records as well as my personal information and I can't control 
what has been released", and, "With the exception of [former Gov.] Eliot 
Spitzer, I have not named names...I do not wish to ruin any lives."[195] 
Following his divorce, Rodriguez has dated Kate Hudson,[citation needed] 
Cameron Diaz,[citation needed] Torrie Wilson,[205] and Anne Wojcicki.[206] 
Rodriguez owns a Mercedes-Benz dealership in League City, Texas,[207] and 
in his free time, Rodriguez buys and collects art.[208] He is an investor 
for eSports team NRG eSports.[209] As previously mentioned, Rodriguez and 
Jeter's friendship had cooled in recent years. However as of 2011[update], 
they have grown close again.[210] As of 2011[update], Rodriguez is represented 
by sports agent Dan Lozano.[211] In 2003, Rodriguez gave $3.9 million to 
the University of Miami to renovate its baseball stadium.[212] The new 
facility was renamed "Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field".[212] Rodriguez 
remains an ardent University of Miami fan.[213] Despite not having attended 
the school, he received the University of Miami's Edward T. Foote II Alumnus 
of Distinction Award in 2007 as an honorary alumnus.[214] Rodriguez had 
previously been named an "honorary alumnus" of the university in 2004. 
He is a member of the University of Miami's Board of Trustees.[215] Rodriguez 
was featured in a Pepsi Cola commercial as a truck driver in a fleet of 
delivery trucks simulating players in a baseball game. At the end of the 
commercial when he drives his vehicle to make a catch, he is told by his 
approving partner in the truck that he has a future in the beverage delivery 
business.[216] Rodriguez is featured in a commercial for Guitar Hero World 
Tour, where he plays the guitar along with athletes Tony Hawk on drums, 
Kobe Bryant on vocals, and Michael Phelps on guitar. The commercial is 
a spoof of the scene from Risky Business where Tom Cruise is dancing to 
"Old Time Rock and Roll".[217] Notes: Through 2015 season. Per Baseball-Reference.com.
