Luther Haden "Dummy" Taylor (February 21, 1875 – August 22, 1958) was a 
deaf-mute American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball from 1900 
to 1908. He played for the New York Giants[1] and Cleveland Bronchos and 
was one of the key pitchers on the Giants' National League championship 
teams of 1904 and 1905. In 1901, his first full season in the major leagues, 
Taylor led the National League by pitching in 45 games and ranked second 
in the league with 37 complete games. In 1904, he won 21 games for the 
Giants, and in 1906 his 2.20 ERA was the lowest on a pitching staff that 
included Baseball Hall of Famers Christy Mathewson (2.97 ERA), and "Iron 
Man" Joe McGinnity (2.25 ERA). Taylor was the only successful deaf pitcher 
in Major League Baseball and was regarded, along with Dummy Hoy, as a role 
model and hero in the American deaf community in the early 20th century.[2] 
In the 1900s, Taylor was reported to be the highest paid deaf person in 
the United States. He was also known as the comedian of the Giants teams, 
waving a lit lantern when an umpire refused to call a game due to darkness 
and coaching at third base in rubber boots when an umpire refused to call 
a game due to rain. In 2000, author Darryl Brock wrote the historical novel 
Havana Heat about Taylor's experience in professional baseball. The book 
won the Dave Moore Award in 2000 as the "most important baseball book" 
published that year.[3] Taylor was born in Oskaloosa, Kansas in 1875. He 
was the son of Arnold B. Taylor, a farmer, and his wife, Emaline (Chatman) 
Taylor. At the time of the 1880 United States Census, Taylor was living 
in rural Jefferson County, Kansas with his parents, two older brothers, 
and two older sisters.[4] Some accounts indicate Taylor was born deaf.[5] 
However, at age four, Taylor was not listed as being "deaf and dumb" or 
otherwise handicapped in the family's U.S. Census record.[4] By age 10, 
Taylor was living at the Kansas School For the Deaf in Olathe, Kansas. 
He was listed in the 1885 Kansas State Census as a pupil at the Deaf and 
Dumb Institute.[6] Taylor continued to live at the Kansas School for the 
Deaf through his high school years. He was a pitcher for the school baseball 
team and also participated in boxing. Interviewed in 1942, Taylor recalled 
he had dreams as a boy of becoming a great boxer, but his parents objected.[7] 
At the time of the 1895 Kansas State Census, Taylor was living in Olathe.[8] 
After leaving the Kansas School for the Deaf, Taylor began playing semi-pro 
baseball with a team in Nevada, Missouri. He then played at Lincoln, Illinois, 
and with minor league teams in Wabash, Crawfordsville, Danville and Terre 
Haute, Indiana. In 1897, he played for a minor league team in Mattoon, 
Illinois. He played for the Shreveport Tigers of the Southern League in 
1898 and 1899.[7] In 1900, Taylor began the season playing for Albany, 
New York. At the time of the U.S. Census in June 1900, Taylor was residing 
at a boarding house in Albany; his occupation was listed as a printer.[9] 
In August 1900, Taylor was called up to the major leagues to play for the 
New York Giants. He made his major league debut on August 27, 1900. In 
his first game for the Giants, five Boston players tried to take advantage 
of Taylor's deafness by trying to steal third base. Interviewed in 1942, 
Taylor recalled with pride, "I nailed each one. I walked over to (Herman) 
Long, the last man caught, and let him know by signs I could hear him stealing."[7] 
Appearing in 11 games for the 1900 Giants, Taylor compiled a 4–3 record 
with a 2.45 earned run average (ERA).[10] In his second season in the major 
leagues, Taylor was a workhorse for the 1901 Giants. He led the National 
League with 43 games started and by appearing in a total of 45 games. He 
also ranked second in the league with 37 complete games, 353⅓ innings pitched, 
and 1,518 batters faced.[10] Despite maintaining a respectable 3.18 ERA, 
Taylor played for a weak-hitting Giants team that finished 7th out of 8 
teams in hits and runs produced.[11] With the absence of run support, Taylor 
finished the season with a win-loss record of 18–27. His 27 losses in 1901 
is tied for the second most given up by any pitcher in Major League Baseball 
during the 20th century (trailing Vic Willis's 29 losses in 1905).[12] 
In March 1902, Taylor signed for more money with the Cleveland Bronchos 
of the American League.[5] He recalled that American League teams were 
"waving big money at us" in the winter before the 1902 season.[7] Taylor 
appeared in four games for the Bronchos, all as a starter. Despite a 1.59 
ERA, Taylor again suffered from a lack of run support and compiled a record 
of 1–3 in Cleveland.[10] In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman 
to persuade Taylor to return to the Giants.[5][13][14] Bowerman sat in 
the stands while Taylor was pitching and negotiated the terms of Taylor's 
return to the Giants by signing. Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand 
and every time I walked out to the pitching mound he kept talking to me 
with his fingers. I kept shaking my head "No", and Frank kept boosting 
the money. Soon, I nodded my head "Yes", and that night I was on my way 
back to New York with Frank.[7] Taylor appeared in 26 games for the 1902 
Giants and had 22 complete games. Taylor's 7–15 record for the 1902 Giants 
was again the result of playing for a remarkably weak-hitting team, as 
the 1902 Giants finished in last place in runs, hits and batting average.[15] 
Even Christy Mathewson, who was Taylor's teammate on the 1902 Giants, registered 
a losing record in 1902 with an ERA (2.12) only marginally better than 
Taylor.[15] In 1903, John McGraw took over as the manager of the Giants. 
McGraw quickly turned the Giants into one of the best teams in the National 
League, with Taylor, Mathewson, and Iron Man Joe McGinnity as his pitching 
stars. Taylor had his most successful season in 1904. With strong support 
from a Giants team that finished first in the National League in runs and 
hits, Taylor compiled a 21–15 record in 1904. He was among the National 
League leaders that year with 21 wins (4th), five shutouts (3rd), 1.033 
WHIP (5th), 136 strikeouts (6th), and a .991 fielding percentage (2nd).[10] 
In 1905, Taylor helped lead the Giants to their second consecutive National 
League pennant. Taylor appeared in 32 games and compiled a record of 16–9 
with a 2.66 ERA.[10] Taylor was scheduled to pitch in the third game of 
the 1905 World Series, but the game was cancelled because of rain, and 
Christy Mathewson pitched with an extra day of rest when the Series resumed.[16] 
(Mathewson pitched three complete-game shutouts in the 1905 World Series.) 
Although the Giants fell short of a third consecutive pennant in 1906, 
Taylor had another strong year, compiling a 17–9 record and a 2.20 ERA. 
His 1906 ERA was the lowest on a pitching staff that included Hall of Famers 
Christy Mathewson (2.97 ERA) and Joe McGinnity (2.25 ERA).[17] Taylor also 
ranked 6th in the National League with a .654 winning percentage in 1906.[10] 
In 1907, Taylor went 11–7 with a 2.42 ERA and a 1.117 WHIP. He pitched 
his final major league season in 1908, compiling an 8–5 record with a 2.33 
ERA.[10] In February 1909, Taylor was sold to the Buffalo Bisons in the 
Eastern League.[18] He won 32 games for Buffalo in 1909 and 1910 and played 
in the minor leagues from 1909 to 1915. In his final season of organized 
baseball, he compiled an 18–11 record for the Utica Utes in the New York 
State League.[19] In nine seasons in the major leagues, Taylor compiled 
an overall win-loss record of 116–106 and 767 strikeouts. He threw 237 
complete games and 21 shutouts. He had a career ERA of 2.75 and a career 
WHIP of 1.267.[10] Taylor was profoundly deaf and communicated on-field 
with his teammates in sign language. He is credited with helping to expand 
and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball 
infield, including but not limited to the use of pitching signs. According 
to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, "The Giants didn't just add 
Taylor to their roster; they embraced him as a member of the family. Player-manager 
George Davis learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the 
same. John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 
1902."[20] In Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Taylor's teammate, 
Fred Snodgrass, recalled: We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb 
sign language, because Dummy Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't 
learn to converse with him. He wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged 
member of the team. If we went to the vaudeville show, he wanted to know 
what the joke was, and somebody had to tell him. So we all learned. We 
practiced all the time.[21] During his eight seasons in Major League Baseball, 
Taylor's success won acclaim in the deaf press, including The Silent Worker, 
and he became a role model and hero for the deaf community.[22] An article 
in The Saturday Evening Post noted that "wherever Taylor goes he will always 
be visited by scores of the silent fraternity among whom he is regarded 
as a prodigy."[23] On May 16, 1902, Taylor pitched against Dummy Hoy in 
Cincinnati, Ohio. The occasion was reported to be "the first and only time 
two deaf professional athletes competed against one another."[5] When Hoy 
came to bat for the first time, he signed to Taylor, "I'm glad to see you."[22] 
Hoy collected two hits off Taylor, but Taylor got the win as the Giants 
beat the Reds 5–3.[5][24] Taylor's nickname, "Dummy", was commonly applied 
to "deaf and dumb" baseball players in the late 19th and early 20th century. 
Dummy Dundon and Dummy Hoy were the first professional baseball players 
to receive the appellation. Others include Dummy Deegan, Dummy Leitner, 
Dummy Lynch, Dummy Murphy and Dummy Stephenson. Although he accepted the 
nickname in his playing days, Taylor noted in a 1945 interview that he 
and Dummy Hoy did not care for the nickname: "In the old days Hoy and I 
were called Dummy. It didn't hurt us. It made us fight harder."[23] Taylor's 
popularity led to an outcry in the deaf press against the use of the nickname. 
Alexander Pach wrote an editorial in The Silent Worker in which he protested: 
"The highest salaried deaf man in the United States is the much heralded 
Dummy Taylor—I say Dummy only to serve to show how contemptible the epithet 
looks."[23][25] Taylor was inducted into the American Athletic Association 
of the Deaf Hall of Fame in 1953. He was also inducted into the Kansas 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.[16] Taylor also developed a reputation as 
the clown on the Giants' team of the 1900s. In April 1905, The New York 
Times wrote about Taylor's efforts to maintain a light atmosphere in the 
Giants' locker room. The Times described Taylor's post-shower wrestling 
matches with Frank Bowerman and his displays of the Japanese martial art, 
jiu-jitsu, adding: The "Dummy" is always smiling. No matter whether in 
the dressing room or on the practice field he is the clown of the crowd. 
If a joke is told he makes Bowerman repeat it to him with his fingers. 
Then he emits a cacophonous cackle that passes for a laugh. "It is a good 
thing Taylor can't tell stories", remarked McGraw one morning, "or I never 
should be able to get any work out of you fellows."[26] On one occasion, 
Taylor disagreed with the decision by umpire Bill Klem not to call the 
game as darkness fell. Taylor returned to the clubhouse and came back onto 
the field wearing a fireman's oilskin and holding a lit lantern above his 
head. Klem yelled at Taylor to get off the field, but Taylor could not 
hear and continued with his antics until Klem finally called the game.[27][28] 
Honus Wagner later wrote about a game in which the Giants were complaining 
about the umpire's refusal to suspend a game due to rain. Wagner wrote, 
"So Dummy Taylor, one of the Giant pitchers, went out to the third base 
coaching lines in his hip boots and a raincoat. Then the umpire did get 
mad. He chased Taylor out of the park, and it was funny to see Dummy trying 
to explain to him that he shouldn't be ejected."[29] Taylor later recalled 
that the umpire, Johnston, "not only chased me, but declared the game forfeited 
to the other club."[7] Giants' manager McGraw kept Taylor in the dugout 
when he wasn't pitching to distract the opposing pitcher. Taylor was able 
to emit a "rattling shriek" just as the opposing pitcher was about to release 
a pitch.[30] Teammate Mike Donlin compared the noise to the "crazed shrieking 
of a jackass."[20] Taylor biographer Sean Lahman wrote: "Umpire Charlie 
Zimmer once got so irritated with the shrill sound that he ejected Taylor, 
perhaps the only instance of a deaf player being tossed for being too noisy."[20] 
Taylor was also ejected from a baseball game by an umpire "for cursing 
him out in sign language."[31] According to some accounts, the umpire was 
Hank O'Day, who knew sign language.[5] After Taylor's tirade, O'Day reportedly 
stepped in front of the plate and signed the following comments back at 
Taylor: "Listen, smart guy ... I've spent all my spare time this past week 
learning your language. You can't call me a blind bat any more. Now, go 
take a shower ... you're out of the game."[32] Aside from sign language, 
Taylor would let it be known that he disagreed with an umpire's call by 
holding his nose and spinning the second finger of his other hand near 
his temple, demonstrating his belief that the ump was screwy.[7] In June 
1905, umpire Hank O'Day ejected Taylor for hand gestures that he interpreted 
to be an accusation that "I had wheels in my head."[33] A press account 
described the scene: He strode angrily toward O'Day, and the grandstand 
observed a lightning movement of the hands. Mystic symbol followed mystic 
symbol, and the crowd kept guessing, what it meant. Suddenly O'Day, too, 
strode forward and majestically waved Mr. Taylor from the field. Still 
frantically making rotary movements around his temples, "Dummy" dawdled 
away."[33] John McGraw recalled an occasion when he, too, was cursed out 
by Taylor: "In sign language, Dummy consigned me to the hottest place he 
could think of—and he didn't mean St. Louis."[23] Taylor was also an accomplished 
juggler and would often put on "a grand juggling act" in front of the Giants' 
dugout to amuse the fans.[34] After his retirement from baseball, Taylor 
returned to Olathe and the Kansas State School For the Deaf, where he worked 
as a teacher and coach. He also served as an umpire from 1915 to 1920, 
working games for the House of David and Union Giants.[7] As of January 
1914, he was the physical director at the Kansas School for the Deaf.[35] 
At the time of the 1915 Kansas State Census, he was living in Olathe with 
his wife, Della M. (Ramsey) Taylor.[36] At the time of the 1920 United 
States Census, Taylor was living at the Kansas School for the Deaf where 
he was employed as the physical instructor.[37] Taylor subsequently moved 
to Iowa where he worked as a coach at the Iowa School for the Deaf. At 
the time of the 1925 Iowa State Census, he was living at the Iowa School 
for the Deaf in Lewis Township, Pottawattamie County, Iowa.[38] In 1927, 
several newspapers reported Taylor had died.[39][40] Taylor issued a statement 
from his home in Iowa, emphatically denying he was dead. Taylor's statement 
resulted in headlines in papers across North America such as, "'Dummy' 
Taylor Denies being Dead."[41][42] It turned out Taylor had been confused 
with another deaf baseball pitcher, Lyman "Dummy" Taylor.[43] At the time 
of the 1930 United States Census, Taylor was still living at the Iowa School 
for the Deaf. His occupation was listed as a coach, and he was listed as 
living with his wife, Della M. Taylor, a teacher at the school.[44] Taylor 
later was employed at the Illinois School for the Deaf in Jacksonville, 
Illinois. When he was interviewed in 1942 for a feature story in The Sporting 
News, Taylor was employed as a coach and "house father" at the Illinois 
School for the Deaf.[7] One of Taylor's pupils, Dick Sipek, went on to 
play baseball for the Cincinnati Reds.[20] Having outlived his first wife, 
Della, who died in 1931, and second wife Lenora Borjquest,[45] Taylor married 
for the third time to Lina Belle Davis from Little Rock, Arkansas in August 
1941.[7] Taylor also continued to be involved with professional baseball 
into the 1950s, umpiring local baseball games and doing scouting work for 
the Giants.[32][46][47][48] In August 1958, Taylor died at Our Savior's 
Hospital in Jacksonville, Illinois.[46][49] He was buried with his first 
wife, Della, at Prairie City Cemetery in Baldwin City, Kansas.[45] Taylor 
is used as the narrator and hero of Darryl Brock's fictional account of
