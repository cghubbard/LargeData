As Player As coach As manager Virgil Lawrence "Spud" Davis (December 20, 
1904 â€“ August 14, 1984) was an American professional baseball player, coach, 
scout and manager.[1] He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for 
the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds, and Pittsburgh 
Pirates.[1] Davis' .308 career batting average ranks fourth all-time among 
major league catchers.[2] Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Davis began his 
professional baseball career in 1926 at the age of 21, playing for the 
Gulfport Tarpons of the Cotton States League.[3] After posting a .356 batting 
average in 27 games for Gulfport, he was sent to play for the Reading Keystones 
of the International League where he hit for a .308 average in 137 games 
during the 1927 season.[3] Davis made his major league debut with the St. 
Louis Cardinals on April 30, 1928 however, after only two games, he was 
traded to the Philadelphia Phillies.[1][4] He began as a second-string 
catcher with the Phillies behind Walt Lerian but, by the end of the 1929 
season, he had taken over as the starting catcher with a .342 batting average 
along with 7 home runs and 48 runs batted in.[1][5] That season would mark 
the first of seven consecutive seasons with batting averages above the 
.300 mark.[1] In 1933, he finished second to team-mate Chuck Klein in the 
National League Batting Championship with a .349 average. His .395 on-base 
percentage was also the second highest in the league.[6] Davis ended the 
season ranked 25th in the National League Most Valuable Player Award voting, 
despite the fact that the Phillies finished in seventh place.[7] In November 
1933, Davis was traded back to the St. Louis Cardinals for catcher Jimmie 
Wilson.[4] He platooned alongside left-handed hitting catcher Bill DeLancey, 
posting a .300 batting average in 107 games on a Cardinals team that became 
known as the Gashouse Gang for their colorful, extroverted personalities.[1][8] 
The Cardinals won the 1934 National League pennant and, went on to defeat 
the Detroit Tigers in the 1934 World Series.[9] In his only post-season 
appearance Davis played in two games in the seven-game series, with two 
hits in two at bats.[10] Davis had another good season in 1935 with a .317 
batting average, 60 runs batted in and led National League catchers in 
fielding percentage however, the Cardinals slipped to second place in the 
standings.[1] In 1936, his batting average dipped to .273 and in December 
of that year, he would be traded to the Cincinnati Reds.[1][4] Davis served 
as a reserve catcher in 1937, working behind future Hall of Fame member 
Ernie Lombardi. In June 1938, he was traded back to the Philadelphia Phillies.[4] 
Davis rebounded in 1939, posting a .307 batting average in 87 games.[1] 
He was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates in October 1939 and continued 
to hit well in 1940 with a .326 batting average in 99 games.[1][4] By 1941, 
Al Lopez, another future Hall of Fame member, had taken over the Pirates 
starting catcher's role and, in 1942, Davis took a role as a coach for 
the Pirates. Due to player shortages during the Second World War, Davis 
returned to the playing field in 1944, appearing in 54 games for the Pirates 
and posting a .301 batting average at the age of 39.[1] He appeared in 
23 games in 1945 before retiring as a major league player at the age of 
40.[1] He continued as a coach and a scout for the Pirates and, briefly 
managed the team when manager Frankie Frisch resigned in September of 1946.[11] 
After playing with the minor league Alexander City Millers in 1947 and 
1948, he returned to work as a coach with the Chicago Cubs from 1950 to 
1953 before retiring from baseball.[3][12][13] In a sixteen-year major 
league career, Davis played in 1,458 games, accumulating 1,312 hits in 
4,255 at bats for a .308 career batting average along with 77 home runs, 
647 runs batted in and a .369 on-base percentage.[1] He ended his career 
with a .984 fielding percentage.[1] Davis hit over .300 ten times in sixteen 
years.[14][15] At the time of his retirement, Davis' .308 career batting 
average was second only to Mickey Cochrane all-time among major league 
catchers.[16] As of 2010, he ranks fourth all-time among career batting 
averages for catchers behind Joe Mauer, Mickey Cochrane and Bill Dickey.[2] 
Davis led National League catchers twice in fielding percentage, once in 
assists and once in baserunners caught stealing.[1] During his playing 
days, he was twice traded for the same player, fellow catcher Jimmie Wilson. 
These trades happened between the Phillies and Cardinals five years apart 
in 1928 and 1933. In 1977, Davis was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall 
of Fame.[17] Davis died in Birmingham, Alabama, at age 79, and is buried
