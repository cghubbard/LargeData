Urban James Shocker (August 22, 1890 – September 9, 1928), born Urbain 
Jacques Shockcor in Cleveland, Ohio, was a Major League Baseball pitcher 
for the New York Yankees and St. Louis Browns from 1916 to 1928. As a prelude 
to his major league career, Shocker spent most of the 1916 season demoted 
by the Yankees to Toronto of the International League for seasoning and 
to prove himself. Shocker posted a marvelous 15–3 and strung together 54 
consecutive scoreless innings. His scoreless inning streak and 1.31 ERA 
for the campaign both still stand as International League records. He was 
called up by the Yankees and played with them through the 1917 season. 
That winter, Miller Huggins engineered a trade to the Browns that he came 
to regret. Shocker rejoined Huggins and the Yankees in 1925. The right-handed 
hurler had four consecutive 20-win seasons with the Browns in the early 
1920s, during which he was one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball. 
Urban was the last Yankee pitcher to legally throw a spitball, as he and 
a handful of other pitchers were grandfathered into the practice after 
it was banned by baseball in 1920. Shocker lived with a heart condition 
so severe that some books say that he had to sleep either sitting or standing 
up. By the early fall of 1927, he was too ill to maintain his place in 
the starting lineup. After his release from the Yankees in 1928, Shocker 
entered an exhibition tournament in Denver. He pitched in one game on August 
6, 1928 against a team from Cheyenne, Wyoming and fared poorly in that 
outing. Around this time, he contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized 
shortly thereafter. He died in Denver as the result of heart failure exacerbated
