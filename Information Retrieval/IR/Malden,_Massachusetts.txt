Malden is a city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. At 
the time of the 2010 United States Census, the population was at 59,450 
people. In 2009, Malden was named the "Best Place to Raise Your Kids" in 
Massachusetts by Bloomberg Businessweek.[1][2] Malden, a hilly woodland 
area north of the Mystic River, was settled by Puritans in 1640 on land 
purchased in 1629 from the Pennacook tribe. The area was originally called 
the "Mistick Side"[3] and was a part of Charlestown. It was incorporated 
as a separate town in 1649.[4] The name Malden was selected by Joseph Hills, 
an early settler and landholder, and was named after Maldon, England.[5] 
The city originally included what are now the adjacent cities of Melrose 
(until 1850) and Everett (until 1870). At the time of the American Revolution, 
the population was at about 1,000 people, and the citizens were involved 
early in resisting the oppression of Britain: they boycotted the consumption 
of tea in 1770 to protest the Revenue Act of 1766, and it was also the 
first town to petition the colonial government to withdraw from the British 
Empire.[4] Malden High School has the second-oldest continuous high school 
football rivalry in the United States with Medford High School. The first 
"Thanksgiving Day Game" dates back to 1889.[6] In 1984, Malden came to 
national renown as the location of the controversial Fells Acres Day Care 
Center preschool trial. In 2004, a same-sex Malden couple was the first 
to marry in Massachusetts at precisely 9:15 AM on May 17, 2004 at Cambridge 
City Hall. Massachusetts was the first state in the United States to issue 
same-sex marriage licenses.[7] Malden is bordered by Melrose on the north, 
Stoneham on the northwest, Medford on the west, Everett on the south, Revere 
on the east, and Saugus on the northeast. Boojum Rock located in the north 
west corner of Malden inside the Middlesex Fells Reservation is the second 
highest point in Malden with an elevation of approximately 275 feet. Waits 
Mount is the highest point. According to the United States Census Bureau, 
the city has a total area of 5.1 square miles (13 km2), of which 5.1 square 
miles (13 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) (0.78%) is water. 
Bordered on the northwest by the cliffs of Middlesex Fells, Malden is drained 
by the Malden River. As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 59,450 
people, 25,161 households, and 13,575 families residing in the city. The 
population density was 11,788.6 people per square mile (4,290.5/km²). There

0.9% Colombian, 0.7% Dominican, 0.5% Mexican, 0.4% Peruvian, 0.4% Guatemalan). 
There were 23,009 households out of which 25.4% had children under the 
age of 18 living with them, 42.8% were married couples living together,

were born outside of the United States. This is twice the number in 1990,[20] 
and an increase from the 26% of foreign-born residents in 2000. Malden's 
percentage of foreign-born residents was the second-highest in Massachusetts, 
after Chelsea.[21] As of 2009 and 2010 immigrants originate from Brazil,[21] 
China, Haiti, India, Morocco, and Pakistan. The Moroccan American Civic 
and Cultural Association is located in Malden.[20] Previous immigrants 
included Italians and Irish in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Malden also 
received Jews who arrived escaping Europe before and after World War II.[20] 
In 1990 Malden had 2,805 Asian residents, making the city 5.2% Asian. In 
2000 this increased to 7,882 Asians, or 14.5% of the city's population, 
in 2000, making it one of ten Massachusetts cities with the largest Asian 
populations in the state. There were 4,504 ethnic Chinese people (57% of 
Malden's Asians), 876 ethnic Vietnamese, and 696 ethnic Indians. From 1990 
to 2000 the Vietnamese population increased by 187% and the Indian population 
increased by 262%.[22] From 2000 to 2010 the Chinese population of Malden 
increased by about 50%.[23] Institutions serving the Asian community in 
Malden include the Immigrant Learning Center, which offers English as a 
second language classes; the Malden Asian Pacific American Coalition; a 
satellite office of the Vietnamese American Civic Association; the nonprofit 
multiservice organization Great Wall Center; and the antipoverty agency 
Tri-City Community Action Program Inc.[22] Malden Public Schools is the 
school district. Malden has five public elementary and middle schools; 
one charter elementary, middle, and high school;[24] one public high school; 
one Catholic high school, one Catholic Pre-K through 8 school; and one 
public preschool. The elementary schools in Malden were replaced in the 
late 1990s with five new facilities: Beebe, Ferryway, Forestdale, Linden, 
and Salemwood. The city's three high schools are Malden High School, Malden 
Catholic High School and Mystic Valley Regional Charter High School. According 
to a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics in 
2013, Malden High School was found to be the most diverse public high school 
in Massachusetts.[25] Like many communities in New England, many towns 
and neighborhoods are organized around squares, which are located at the 
crossroads and town commons dating back from the colonial times and the 
early 19th century. Many of the neighborhoods take their name and identity 
from the main square in their area. Malden's squares include Malden Square 
(at Main and Pleasant streets), Converse Square (at Main, Salem, and Ferry 
streets) Oak Grove Square (at Oak Grove T Station), Bellrock Square (at 
the intersections of Cross, Main and Medford Sts.), Judson Square (near 
Ferryway School), former Suffolk Square (at Cross and Bryant Streets), 
and the location of a thriving Jewish community, Maplewood Square (at Lebanon, 
Maplewood and Salem Streets) and Linden Square. Some of the neighborhoods 
in Malden include Faulkner (location of the former Suffolk Square) West 
End, Edgeworth, Linden, Ferryway, Forestdale, Maplewood, Bellrock, and 
Belmont Hill (located between Bellrock and Ferryway). Bellrock is the south 
central section of the city, bordered by Main Street on the east, Charles 
Street on the north, the Malden River on the west, and the Everett line 
on the south. It contains Bell Rock Memorial Park (listed on the National 
Register of Historic Places) and Bell Rock Cemetery (also listed), which 
contains marked graves dating back to 1670. Bell Rock Cemetery was called 
Sandy Bank until the establishment of the Salem Street Cemetery in 1832; 
it was then known as the Old Burial Ground for half a century until it 
was renamed in 1882. Also located in this area are the headquarters for 
New England Coffee. The Edgeworth neighborhood is the southwest section 
of the city. It contains Devir Park, Pearl St. Park, and Callahan Park. 
The city's football stadium, MacDonald Stadium is in Edgeworth. A school 
in Edgeworth is the former Emerson grammar school. The Converse Rubber 
Factory and offices once operated in Edgeworth at the bottom of Pearl Street. 
This is the original home of the Converse "All-Star" Basketball Sneakers. 
Malden Catholic High School was originally located in Edgeworth on Highland 
Ave. The school's football team played their home games at Brother Gilbert 
Stadium, located at Commercial & Medford Streets in Edgeworth. Immaculate 
Conception Grammar School was located in Edgeworth on the corner of Charles 
St. and Highland Ave. Edgeworth touches Everett and Medford. Edgeworth 
is also home to St. Rocco's Feast, SunSetter Awnings and Pisa Pizza. In 
1847, Joshua Webster, president of the Saugus Branch Railroad, purchased 
200 acres in Malden along its projected route. Here, he planned a residential 
development with wide streets and ornamental trees. Due to the hundreds 
of maple trees Webster planted, the neighborhood became known as Maplewood.[26][27] 
The headquarters of the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary 
Education are in Malden.[28] Route 28, Route 60, Route 99, and U.S. 1 run 
through Malden. Route 16 and Interstate 93 are a short distance outside 
the city's borders. The city is served by the Orange Line subway that connects 
it to downtown Boston. The city's subway stops are Malden Center and Oak 
Grove. The MBTA's commuter rail also has one stop in the city (Malden Center) 
and can stop at Oak Grove if necessary. During the first few years of the 
2000s, the MBTA updated signal systems and Orange Line service was replaced 
by shuttle buses at night. Since September 2007, such service interruptions 
have been limited to occasional weekends, while signal system repairs necessitated 
closing off the northern portion of the Orange Line and rerouting passengers 
via replacement bus service from either the Haymarket subway stop or Wellington 
Station. There is a sizable section of the old Boston and Maine Saugus 
Branch Railroad line running across the middle of Malden. This line is 
currently owned by the MBTA, but has been out of use since 1993 and has 
not seen passenger service since 1958. A plan exists to create a bike trail 
(Bike to the Sea) along the side of these tracks on right-of-way land. 
Progress was hampered by lack of funds and land encroachment, but is now 
slated for ribbon cutting in June 3, 2012.[29] The path will be known as 
the Northern Strand Community Trail. Bus service to all adjacent communities 
is also available via the service of the MBTA. Approximately 30 park sites 
throughout the city provide a variety of recreational facilities including 
tennis courts, basketball courts, playgrounds and ballfields. Other sites 
include a 400-meter synthetic running track at MacDonald Stadium; 56 acres 
(23 ha) of the Middlesex Fells Reservation; the 25-acre (10 ha) Fellsmere 
Pond; a DCR-owned-and-operated swimming pool; a 30,000 square feet (2,800 
m²) field house built under the new school rebuilding plan; the state-of-the-art 
Malden YMCA finished construction in early 2007; and Pine Banks Park, operated 
by a Board of Trustees with equal representation by the cities of Malden 
and Melrose. Waitt's Mountain is also in Malden. Other points of interest 
include the Converse Memorial Library and the Congregation Beth Israel. 
One of Malden's finest and most notable landmarks is the public library
