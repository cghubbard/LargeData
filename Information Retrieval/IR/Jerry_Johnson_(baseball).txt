Jerry Michael Johnson (born December 3, 1943 in Miami, Florida) is a former 
Major League Baseball pitcher from 1968 through 1977. He batted and threw 
right-handed. Johnson was signed by the New York Mets as an amateur free 
agent third baseman in 1962. He batted .248 for their Western Carolina 
League affiliate, the Salisbury Braves in 1962, and committed seven errors 
in only 29 games for a .868 fielding percentage. He batted .238 with an 
.872 fielding percentage in 1963, and the Mets began experimenting with 
him on the mound. He made eleven pitching appearances for the California 
League's Salinas Mets that season, and had a 6.75 earned run average without 
a decision. With an .870 fielding percentage in 1964, the notion of Johnson 
as a third baseman was abandoned, and he was converted to a pitcher for 
good by the New York–Penn League's Auburn Mets. He pitched in the Mets' 
minor league system through 1967. Following the season, he was obtained 
by the Philadelphia Phillies from the Mets in the 1967 minor league draft. 
Johnson made his major league debut on July 17, 1968 in the first game 
of a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park. He gave up two 
earned runs in one inning of the Phillies' 8-4 loss.[1] Johnson spent two 
years with Philadelphia, before moving to the St. Louis Cardinals in a 
controversial transaction. On October 7, 1969, he was sent by Philadelphia 
along with Dick Allen and Cookie Rojas to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 
same trade that brought Tim McCarver, Byron Browne, Joe Horner and Curt 
Flood to the Phillies. After Flood refused to report to his new team, St. 
Louis sent Willie Montañez and a minor leaguer to Philadelphia to complete 
the trade. Flood believed that Major League Baseball's reserve clause was 
unfair and appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although his legal 
challenge was unsuccessful, it brought solidarity among ballplayers as 
they fought against reserve clause and sought free agency. He was 2-0 with 
a 3.18 ERA for the Cards when they dealt him mid-season to the San Francisco 
Giants for Frank Linzy. With the Giants, Johnson emerged as one of the 
top relievers in the National League, finishing sixth in Cy Young Award 
balloting during an era when such an honor was rare for relief pitchers. 
In 1971, Johnson went 12-9 with a 2.97 ERA and eighteen saves for the division 
winning Giants. In his only post-season, he pitched 1.1 innings and gave 
up two runs to the Pittsburgh Pirates in game four of the 1971 National 
League Championship Series.[2] During Spring training 1973, Johnson was 
selected off waivers by the Cleveland Indians. After one season in the 
American League, he was traded to the Houston Astros for Cecil Upshaw. 
He was released by the Astros at the end of the 1974 season, and signed 
with the San Diego Padres in 1975. After two seasons in San Diego, he was 
traded to the newly created Toronto Blue Jays for Dave Roberts, who had 
just been purchased by the Jays from the Padres. Johnson was the winning 
pitcher (as a reliever) in the Blue Jays first ever regular season game 
on April 7, 1977. Johnson went 2-4 with a 4.60 ERA in the Blue Jays' inaugural 
season, at the end of which, he retired. Following his majors career, Johnson 
played for the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association.
