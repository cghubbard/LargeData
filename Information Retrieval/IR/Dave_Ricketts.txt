Ricketts was a reserve catcher on the 1967 World Series champion Cardinals

of the Cardinals (1974–1975, 1978–1991), including their 1982 World Series 
champions and 1985 and 1987 pennant winners, after having been the bullpen 
coach for the Pirates from 1971 to 1973, including the 1971 World Series 
champions. Over his career he batted .249 with 1 home run and 20 runs batted 
in in 130 games played. Ricketts was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania; his 
older brother Dick was the first pick in the 1955 NBA Draft, and played

for the 1959 Cardinals. Dave Ricketts played basketball with his brother 
at Duquesne University,[1] graduating in 1957 with a degree in education. 
He married Barbarann Boswell on August 17, 1957,[2] and they had one daughter, 
Candace. He served in the military in 1958–1959. During his minor league
