Lynn is the largest city in Essex County, Massachusetts. Situated on the 
Atlantic Ocean, approximately 10 miles (16Â km) north of downtown Boston, 
Lynn is part of Greater Boston's urban inner core.[1] A former industrial 
center, Lynn was long colloquially referred to as the "City of Sin," owing 
to its historic reputation for crime and vice. Today, however, the city 
is known for its large international population, historic architecture, 
downtown cultural district, loft-style apartments, and public parks and 
open spaces,[2] which include the oceanfront Lynn Shore Reservation; the 
2,200-acre, Frederick Law Olmsted-designed Lynn Woods Reservation; and 
the High Rock Tower Reservation. The city also is home to the southernmost 
portion of the Essex Coastal Scenic Byway,[3] Lynn Heritage State Park, 
and the National Register-listed Diamond Historic District. Prior to European 
colonization, the area today known as Lynn was inhabited by the Agawam 
tribe of Native Americans.[4] European settlement of the area was begun 
in 1629 by Edmund Ingalls (d. 1648), followed by John Tarbox of Lancashire 
in 1631, whose descendants still reside in New England.[5] The city was 
originally incorporated in 1631 as Saugus, the Nipmuck name for the area.[6] 
The name Lynn was given to the area after King's Lynn, Norfolk, England, 
in honor of Samuel Whiting.[7] A noteworthy colonist, Thomas Halsey left 
Lynn to settle the eastern end of Long Island and founded the town of Southampton, 
New York. The Halsey House is today the oldest frame house in the state 
of New York (1648), and along with the homestead it is open to the public 
and managed by the Southampton Colonial Society. After Lynn's subsequent 
resettlement, many of its areas gradually separated into independent towns. 
Reading was created in 1644, Lynnfield in 1782, Saugus in 1815, Swampscott 
in 1852, and Nahant in 1853. Lynn was incorporated as a city in 1850. Colonial 
Lynn was a major part of the regional tannery and shoe-making industries 
that began in 1635. The boots worn by Continental Army soldiers during 
the Revolutionary War were made in Lynn. The shoe-making industry drove 
urban growth in Lynn into the early nineteenth century.[7] This historic 
theme is reflected in the city seal, which features a colonial boot.[8] 
In 1816, a mail stage coach was operating through Lynn. By 1836, 23 stage 
coaches left the Lynn Hotel for Boston each day. The Eastern Railroad Line 
between Salem and East Boston opened on August 28, 1838. This was later 
merged with the Boston and Maine Railroad and called the Eastern Division. 
In 1847 telegraph wires passed through Lynn, but no telegraph service station 
was built until 1858.[9] During the middle of the nineteenth century, estates 
and beach cottages were constructed along Lynn's shoreline, and the city's 
Atlantic coastline became a fashionable summer resort.[10] Many of the 
structures built during this period are today situated within the National 
Register-listed Diamond Historic District. Further inland, industrial activity 
contemporaneously expanded in Lynn. Shoe manufacturers, led by Charles 
A. Coffin and Silas Abbott Barton, invested in the early electric industry, 
specifically in 1883 with Elihu Thomson and his Thomson-Houston Electric 
Company. That company merged with Edison Electric Company of Schenectady, 
New York, forming General Electric in 1892, with the two original GE plants 
being in Lynn and Schenectady. Coffin served as the first president of 
General Electric.[11] Initially the General Electric plant specialized 
in arc lights, electric motors, and meters. Later it specialized in aircraft 
electrical systems and components, and aircraft engines were built in Lynn 
during WWII. That engine plant evolved into the current jet engine plant 
during WWII because of research contacts at MIT in Cambridge.[12] Gerhard 
Neumann was a key player in jet engine group at GE in Lynn. The continuous 
interaction of material science research at MIT and the resulting improvements 
in jet engine efficiency and power have kept the jet engine plant in Lynn 
ever since. One of the largest strikes of the early labor movement began 
in the shoe factories of Lynn on February 22, 1860, when Lynn shoemakers 
marched through the streets to their workplaces and handed in their tools, 
protesting reduced wages.[13] Known as the New England Shoemakers Strike 
of 1860, it was one of the earliest strikes of its kind in the United States. 
On February 1, 1866, Mary Baker Eddy experienced the "fall in Lynn", often 
referred to by Christian Scientists as significant in the birth of their 
religion.[14] Lynn experienced a wave of immigration during the late 1800s 
and early 1900s. During the 30 years between 1885 and 1915, Lynn's immigrant 
population increased from 9,800 to 29,500, representing nearly one-third 
of the city's total population.[15] Polish and Russian born Jews were the 
largest single group, numbering more than 6,000.[15] The first Jewish settlers 
in Lynn, a group of twenty Hasidic European families, mostly Russian, formed 
the Congregation Anshai Sfard, a Hasidic, conservative Jewish synagogue 
in 1888.[16] Catholic churches catering to the needs of specific language 
and ethnic groups also testify to the waves of immigrants. St. Jean Baptiste 
parish, eventually including a grammar school and high school, was founded 
in 1886, primarily for French-Canadians. Holy Family Church conducted services 
in Italian beginning in 1922, and St. Michael's church also provided church 
services and a grammar school for the Polish-speaking community, beginning 
in 1906.[17] St. Patrick's church and school was a focus of the Irish-American 
community in Lynn.[18] St. George's Greek Orthodox Church was founded in 
Lynn in 1905.[19] Later in the 20th century, the city became an important 
center of greater Boston's Latino community.[20] Additionally, several 
thousand Cambodians settled in Lynn between 1975 and 1979 and in the early 
1980s.[21] At the beginning of the 20th century, Lynn was the world-leader 
in the production of shoes. 234 factories produced more than a million 
pairs of shoes each day, thanks in part to mechanization of the process 
by an African-American immigrant named Jan Matzeliger. From 1924 until 
1974, the Lynn Independent Industrial Shoemaking School operated in the 
city.[22][23] However, production declined throughout the 20th century, 
and the last shoe factory closed in 1981.[24] In the early 1900s, the Metropolitan 
District Commission acquired several coastal properties in Lynn and Nahant, 
in order to create the adjoining Lynn Shore and Nahant Beach Reservations, 
and to construct Lynn Shore Drive.[25] When it opened to the public in 
1910, Lynn Shore Drive catalyzed new development along Lynn's coastline, 
yielding many of the early 20th century structures that constitute a majority 
of the contributing resources found in the National Register-listed Diamond 
Historic District.[26] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Lynn suffered 
several large fires. On November 28, 1981, a devastating inferno engulfed 
several former shoe factories, located at Broad and Washington Streets. 
Seventeen downtown buildings were destroyed, with property losses totaling 
in the tens of millions of dollars. (The affected area has since been largely 
redeveloped into a satellite campus of North Shore Community College, with 
many adjacent warehouses converted to loft apartments.) A reputation for 
crime and vice gave rise to a taunting rhyme about Lynn[27][28] which became 
popular throughout Eastern Massachusetts: "Lynn, Lynn, the city of sin, 
you'll never come out the way you went in, what looks like gold is really 
tin, the girls say 'no' but they'll give in, Lynn, Lynn, the city of sin." 
Another variation was "Lynn, Lynn the city of sin: if you ain't bad, you 
can't get in!" In order to counter its reputation as "the city of sin," 
Lynn launched a "City Of Firsts" advertising campaign in the early 1990s, 
which promoted Lynn as having: Some of these claims were subsequently found 
to be inaccurate or unprovable.[citation needed] In a further effort to 
rebrand the municipality, city solicitor Michael Barry proposed renaming 
the city Ocean Park in 1997, but the initiative was unsuccessful.[29] Despite 
losing much of its industrial base during the 20th century, Lynn remained 
home to a division of General Electric Aviation; the West Lynn Creamery 
(now part of Dean Foods's Garelick Farms unit); C. L. Hauthaway & Sons, 
a polymer producer; Old Neighborhood Foods, a meat packer; Lynn Manufacturing, 
a maker of combustion chambers for the oil and gas heating industry; Sterling 
Machine Co.; and Durkee-Mower, makers of "Marshmallow Fluff". In the early 
2000s, the renovation and adaptive re-use of downtown historic structures, 
together with new construction, launched a revitalization of Lynn, which 
remains ongoing.[30] Arts, culture, and entertainment have been at the 
forefront of this revitalization, with new arts organizations, cultural 
venues, and restaurants emerging in the downtown area.[31] In 2012, the 
Massachusetts Cultural Council named downtown Lynn one of the first state-recognized 
arts and culture districts in Massachusetts.[32] In 2015, Massachusetts 
Governor Charlie Baker established a task force, composed of representatives 
of multiple state and municipal public agencies, to encourage Lynn's continued 
revitalization.[33] Formerly vacant industrial buildings continue to be 
converted into loft spaces,[34] and historic homes, particularly Lynn's 
Diamond Historic District, are being restored.[35] In 2016, several large 
land parcels were acquired by major developers, who have announced plans 
to construct new, large-scale luxury housing along and near Lynn's waterfront.[36] 
Between April 2015 and April 2016, the number of monthly home sales in 
Lynn increased 104%.[37] In recent years, Lynn has attracted a substantial 
and growing LGBT population.[38] General View in 1909 Market Street in

/ 42.47389; -70.95556 (42.473996, â70.955583).[39] According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 13.5 square miles (35Â km2), 
of which 10.8 square miles (28Â km2) is land and 2.7 square miles (7.0Â km2) 
(19.87%) is water. Lynn is located beside Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic 
Ocean. Lynn's shoreline is divided in half by the town of Nahant, which 
divides Lynn Harbor to the south from Nahant Bay to the north. The city 
lies north of the Saugus River, and is also home to several brooks, as 
well as several ponds, the largest being Breed's Pond and Walden Pond (which 
has no relation to a similarly named pond in Concord). More than one-quarter 
of the town's land is covered by the Lynn Woods Reservation, which takes 
up much of the land in the northwestern part of the city. The city is also 
home to two beaches, Lynn Beach and King's Beach, both of which lie along 
Nahant Bay, as well as a boat ramp in Lynn Harbor. Lynn is located in the 
southern part of Essex County and is 10 miles (16Â km) northeast of Boston 
and 22 miles (35Â km) west-southwest of Cape Ann. The city is bordered by 
Nahant to the south, Swampscott to the east, Salem to the northeast, Peabody 
to the north, Lynnfield to the northwest, Saugus to the west and Revere 
(in Suffolk County) to the southeast. Lynn's water rights extend into Nahant 
Bay and share Lynn Harbor with Nahant. There is no land connection to Revere; 
the only connection is the General Edwards Bridge across the Saugus River. 
Besides its downtown district, Lynn is also divided into East Lynn and 
West Lynn, which are further divided into even smaller areas. Lynn is loosely 
segmented into the following neighborhoods: Central: West Lynn: East Lynn: 
Lynn has no Interstate or controlled-access highways, the nearest being 
U.S. Route 1 in Saugus and the combined Interstate 95 and Route 128 in 
Lynnfield. Route 1A, Route 107, Route 129 and Route 129A all pass through 
the city. Route 107 passes from southwest to northeast along a relatively 
straight right-of-way through the city. It shares a 0.5 miles (0.80Â km) 
concurrency with Route 129A, which follows Route 129's old route through 
the city between its parent route and Route 1A. Route 129 passes from the 
north of the city before turning south and passing through the downtown 
area and becoming concurrent with Route 1A for 1 mile (1.6Â km). Route 1A 
passes from Revere along the western portion of the Lynnway, a divided 
highway within the city, before passing further inland into Swampscott. 
The Lynnway itself runs along the coastline, leading to a rotary which 
links the road to Nahant Road and Lynn Shore Drive, which follows the coast 
into Swampscott. Lynn has a stop on the Newburyport/Rockport Line of the 
MBTA Commuter Rail, as well as the River Works stop, which is for GE Aviation 
employees only. A number of other stations were open until the mid 20th 
century. Numerous MBTA bus routes also connect Lynn with Boston and the 
neighboring communities. An extension of the Blue Line to downtown Lynn 
has been proposed, but not funded. The nearest airport is Boston's Logan 
International Airport, about 5 miles (8.0Â km) south. In 2014, seasonal 
commuter ferry service between Lynn and Boston's Financial District was 
established.[40] However, after two seasons of operationâand after the 
federal government allocated $4.5Â million for the purchase of a new ferry 
boat for the line[41]âservice was suspended in 2016, when the state declined 
to continue providing the necessary operating funds.[42] Lynn gets cold, 
snowy winters and warm, humid summers. The other two seasons are mild, 
in general. As of the census of 2010, there were 90,329 people, 33,310 
households, and 20,988 families residing in the city.[55] The racial makeup 
of the city was: Hispanic or Latino of any race were 32.1% of the population 
(10.5% Dominican, 6.3% Guatemalan, 5.4% Puerto Rican, 2.8% Salvadoran, 
1.7% Mexican, 0.6% Honduran, 0.4% Colombian, 0.4% Spanish, 0.2% Peruvian, 
0.2% Cuban).[55] Cambodians form the largest Asian origin group in Lynn, 
with 3.9% of Lynn's total population of Cambodian ancestry. Other large 
Asian groups are those of Vietnamese (1.0%), Indian (0.4%), Chinese (0.3%), 
and Laotian (0.2%) ancestry. In the city the population was spread out 
with 24.9% under the age of 18 and 75.1% over 18. Males accounted for 49% 
and females 51%.[55] Between 2009 and 2013, the median household income 
in Lynn was $44,849. The per capita income was $22,982. About 21.0% of 
the population was considered below the poverty line.[56] In 1990 Lynn 
had 2,993 persons of Asian origin. In 2000 Lynn had 5,730 Asians, an increase 
of over 91%, making it one of ten Massachusetts cities with the largest 
Asian populations. In 2000 the city had 3,050 persons of Cambodian origin, 
making them the largest Asian subgroup in Lynn. That year the city had 
1,112 persons of Vietnamese origin and 353 persons of Indian origin. From 
1990 to 2000 the Vietnamese and Indian populations increased by 192% and 
264%, respectively.[57] By 2004 the Cambodian community in Lynn was establishing 
the Khmer Association of the North Shore.[57] Data is from the 2009â2013 
American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.[58][59][60] The North Shore 
Adult Day Health Center in Lynn, which opened in January 2009, caters to 
persons of Hispanic and Latino origin in Lynn and surrounding cities.[63] 
Lynn has three public high schools (Lynn English, Lynn Classical, and Lynn 
Vocational Technical High School), four junior high schools, two alternative 
schools, and, as of Autumn 2015, 18 elementary schools.[64] They are served 
by the Lynn Public Schools district. There is also an independent Catholic 
high school located in the city, St. Mary's High School. Also, there are 
three religious Kâ8 elementary schools, and one interdenominational Christian 
school, North Shore Christian School.[65] KIPP: the Knowledge Is Power 
Program operates the KIPP Academy Lynn, a 5â8 charter middle school, in 
Lynn and has also opened KIPP Academy Lynn Collegiate to serve high school 
students in the city. North Shore Community College has a campus in downtown 
Lynn (with its other campuses located in Danvers and Beverly). Broad Sound
