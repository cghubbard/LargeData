John Thomas "Tommy" Matchick (born September 7, 1943) is a former professional 
baseball player. Matchick played professional baseball for 15 years from 
1962 to 1976 as a shortstop, third baseman, second baseman and utility 
infielder. He was named the top all-star in the International League on 
four occasions.[1] He played parts of six seasons in Major League Baseball 
for the Detroit Tigers (1967â€“1969), Boston Red Sox (1970), Kansas City 
Royals (1970), Milwaukee Brewers (1971), and Baltimore Orioles (1972). 
In his six major league seasons, Matchick compiled a .215 batting average 
with four home runs and 64 runs batted in in 292 games.[2] Matchick appeared 
in 80 games for the 1968 Detroit Tigers team that won the World Series. 
The UPI wrote in July 1968 that his two-run walk-off home run against the 
Baltimore Orioles "looms as the biggest blow so far in the 1968 pennant 
races" and called him the Tigers' most unlikely hero since Floyd Giebell 
in 1940.[3] Matchick was born in 1943 in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. His father, 
John Wesley Matchick was a crane operator for Bethlehem Steel Corporation.[1] 
He attended Hazleton-Freeland High School where he starred in both baseball 
and football.[2][4] Matchick did not play baseball in high school but was 
discovered playing Junior American Legion baseball.[4] In 1962, Matchick 
was signed by scout Ollie Vanek to a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals 
and received a $17,000 signing bonus.[1] He began his professional career 
with the Brunswick Cardinals in Brunswick, Georgia. He appeared in 71 games 
for Brunswick and compiled a .311 batting average and a .372 on-base percentage. 
He finished the 1962 season with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the Northern 
League.[5] In November 1962, Matchick was drafted by the Detroit Tigers 
from the Cardinals in the 1962 first-year draft.[2] He spent five years 
in the Tigers' farm system before making his debut with the Tigers. In 
the spring of 1963, his first with the Tigers organization, Matchick was 
assigned to the Lakeland Tigers where he was described as a "flashy fielder" 
who had good range and a powerful throwing arm.[4] Matchick next played 
for the Knoxville Smokies in 1963 and 1964. By the end of the 1964 season, 
Matchick had been promoted to the Syracuse Chiefs, the Tigers' Triple-A 
team in the International League. He spent the 1965 and 1966 seasons in 
Syracuse, appearing in 277 games and accumulating 41 doubles, 10 triples, 
19 home runs and 115 RBIs.[5] Prior to the 1967 season, the Tigers swapped 
Triple-A farm teams with the New York Yankees, resulting in Matchick's 
moving to the Toledo Mud Hens. During the 1967 season, Mathick appeared 
in 120 games for the Mud Hens, compiling a .289 batting average and a .329 
on-base percentage with 38 extra base hits, 11 home runs, and 55 RBIs.[5] 
Matchick was a Triple A all-star and won a Rawlings Silver Glove Award 
(the minor league equivalent to the Rawlings Gold Glove Award) for his 
fielding during the 1967 season.[1][6] Matchick was called up by the Tigers 
late in the 1967 season. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the 
Tigers on September 2, 1967. He appeared in eight games at the end of the 
1967 season, tallying one hit and one run in six at bats.[2] In 1968, Matchick 
appeared in 80 games for the 1968 Detroit Tigers team that won the 1968 
World Series. He compiled a .203 batting average with three home runs and 
14 RBIs in 227 at bats for the 1968 Tigers.[2] On July 19, 1968, Matchick 
hit a walk-off home run against the Baltimore Orioles to give the Tigers 
a 5-4 victory. The home run came with two outs in the bottom of the ninth 
inning, a full count, Bill Freehan on first base, Moe Drabowsky pitching, 
and the Tigers trailing, 4-3. Matchick was greeted at home plate by the 
entire Tigers team as a capacity crowd of 53,208 "roared its approval."[3] 
At the time, the UPI called Matchick the Tigers' most unlikely hero since 
Floyd Giebell in 1940 and wrote that his walk-off home run "looms as the 
biggest blow so far in the 1968 pennant races and could be the blow the 
Tigers look back on as the one that put them 'home free'."[3][7] Matchick 
also participated in a triple play for the Tigers on September 1, 1968. 
Detroit pitcher Denny McLain caught a line drive off the bat of Baltimore 
slugger Boog Powell, threw to Matchick who forced out Curt Blefary at second, 
and Matchick completed the play by throwing to Norm Cash who forced out 
Frank Robinson at first base. McLain recorded his 27th win of the season 
in the game.[8] The play was the Tigers' first triple play since 1965.[9] 
During the 1969 season, Matchick played at all four infield positions for 
the Tigers, appeared in 94 games, and compiled a .242 batting average with 
32 RBIs. In 16 pinch hit appearances in 1969, he had eight hits for a .500 
batting average as a pinch hitter.[10] In December 1969, the Tigers traded 
Matchick to the Boston Red Sox for infielder Dalton Jones.[11][12] Matchick 
appeared in only 10 games for the Red Sox during the first month of the 
1969 season. He had one hit and two bases on balls and scored two runs 
in 16 plate appearances.[2] In May 1970, the Red Sox traded Matchick to 
the Kansas City Royals in exchange for first baseman Mike Fiore.[13][14] 
Matchick appeared in 55 games for the Royals, including 37 as the team's 
starting shortstop and five as the starting second baseman. He compiled 
a .196 batting average in 158 at bats with the 1970 Royals.[2] In May 1971, 
Matchick was traded by the Royals to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange 
for outfielder Ted Savage. He was assigned by the Brewers to their Evansville 
farm club where he played at third base, shortstop, and second base, and 
compiled a .332 batting average in 85 games. He was called up by the Brewers 
in late July 1971.[15][16] He appeared in 42 games for the Brewers, including 
32 games as the team's starting third baseman. He compiled a .219 batting 
average and a .254 on-base percentage in 122 plate appearances with the 
Brewers.[2] On October 22, 1971, the Brewers traded Matchick and Bruce 
Look to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for Mike Ferraro and a prospect.[2] 
Matchick spent most of the 1972 season with the Orioles' Rochester Red 
Wings farm club in the International League. He appeared in 126 games with 
the Red Wings, primarily at third base, committed only four errors, and 
compiled a .251 batting average with 11 home runs and 60 RBIs.[17] He received 
an award as the top third baseman in the minor leagues in 1972.[18] In 
September 1972, the Orioles called up Matchick from their Rochester farm 
club.[19] He appeared in only three games for the Orioles, totalling two 
hits in nine at bats. His final Major League game was on October 3, 1972, 
as a member of the Orioles.[2] In March 1973, the Orioles traded Matchick 
to the New York Yankees in exchange for infielder Frank Baker.[18][20] 
Matchick was assigned by the Yankees to the Syracuse Chiefs in the International 
League where he appeared in 87 games, compiling a .271 batting average 
and .341 on-base percentage.[5] Matchick remained active in the minor leagues 
through the 1976 season.[5] Matchick married Linda Lang, a native of Toledo, 
Ohio. They had a son, Brian Thomas Matchick, on February 5, 1969.[21] They 
had a daughter, Heather, the following year.[6] Matchick and his wife settled

They also adopted a daughter, Amanda. Matchick worked over the years as
