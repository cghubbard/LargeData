Brendan Wood Ryan (born March 26, 1982) is an American professional baseball 
infielder who is currently a free agent. He has played for the St. Louis 
Cardinals, Seattle Mariners and New York Yankees. Ryan won the Fielding 
Bible Award in 2012. While he has typically fielded at shortstop in his 
professional career, Ryan has been known to play at second and third base 
and on a rare occasion as a first baseman. Ryan has earned a reputation 
as one of the finest defensive players in the league.[1] Ryan was born 
in Los Angeles on March 26, 1982, to Katie and Jim Ryan. He is the youngest 
of their four children. Ryan attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman 
Oaks, California. His father was an infielder for Loyola Marymount University 
and holds the school's single season record for most hits with a wooden 
bat. His uncle, Willie Ryan, was a National Champion First Team All-American 
first baseman for the USC Trojans baseball team; his other uncle, Dr. Patrick 
Ryan, was a college sprinter at UCLA and Michigan State.[citation needed] 
In the fall of 2000, Ryan enrolled at Lewis–Clark State College to play 
college baseball in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. 
In his first season, he batted .375 with 5 triples, the third most ever 
by a Warrior. As a sophomore shortstop, he hit .359 with 34 RBIs and hit 
.378 with runners on. During the 2002 season, he hit safely in 18 straight 
games. Beyond his solid offensive numbers, Ryan gained a reputation as 
a good defensive infielder. In the 2002 summer season, Brendan played collegiate 
summer baseball for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks in the Alaska Baseball 
League.[citation needed] In 2003, Ryan entered the MLB amateur draft and 
was selected in the seventh round (215th overall) by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Ryan hit .311 for the Cardinals' rookie league affiliate, the New Jersey 
Cardinals, in 2003. In 2004, he was promoted to the Cardinals' Class A 
affiliate, the Peoria Chiefs. With a .322 batting average and 30 steals 
in the 2004 season, another promotion came for Ryan, this time to the High 
A Class team, the Palm Beach Cardinals, where Ryan was selected as a Florida 
State League All-Star. He was promoted again during the middle of 2005 
season to the Class AA Springfield Cardinals. In 2006, Ryan suffered a 
wrist injury in spring training limiting him to 28 games spread among four 
stops in the minors. That same year, Ryan appeared in 28 games for the 
Peoria Saguaros in the Arizona Fall League and batted .310 (39-for-126) 
with two home runs, 19 runs and 20 RBI. His 39 hits were tied for tops 
for the 2006 AFL season. He collected two four-hit games and hit safely 
in his first eight AFL games (.425 BA) and 10 of his first 11 (.396). Ryan 
was originally called up on and made his major league debut for the Cardinals 
on June 2, 2007, against the Houston Astros. He was later sent down on 
July 27, 2007, but was recalled on August 12, 2007, and remained with the 
Cardinals for the rest of the season. In his rookie year, he hit for a 
.289 batting average with 4 home runs and 11 runs batted in. Ryan also 
scored 29 runs and recorded 7 stolen bases without being caught stealing. 
He batted significantly better against left-handed pitching in his first 
season with a batting average of .354, as opposed to his .232 average against 
right-handers. His first major league home run was a game-winner in the 
top of the 11th inning off of Scott Schoeneweis of the New York Mets on 
June 26, 2007. His second home run also came rather dramatically, as he 
contributed to a four run comeback on July 4, 2007 when the Cardinals were 
at one point behind 4–1. The Cardinals won the game 5–4 against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. Ryan opened the 2008 season on the 15-day disabled list with 
a right oblique strain suffered in spring training. He rehabbed injury 
in the minor leagues in the first month of the season until called up on 
April 23.[2] He was the Cardinals' primary utility infielder for the most 
of the season, although he played three games in the outfield. He was optioned 
to Memphis on August 6 and recalled again on September 2. Ryan started 
the 2009 season in St. Louis. He went on the 15-day disabled from April 
30 through May 15 with a left hamstring strain, making a rehab stint in 
Memphis. By June, he moved up to be the everyday shortstop, batting over 
.300 and playing spectacular defense. On August 20, 2009, in the second 
inning of the Cardinals and Padres Game, Ryan hit his first career grand 
slam off of San Diego pitcher Tim Stauffer. On September 19, 2009, Ryan 
hit a walk off single off Chicago Cubs closer Carlos Mármol. Ryan also 
had a home run in the 2–1 win. His game-winning single was the first walk-off 
hit of his career. By the end of the 2009 regular season, Ryan's defense 
at shortstop had been recognized as a major factor in the Cardinals' divisional 
title. However, in February 2010, he underwent a procedure to debride dead 
tissue from his right wrist performed by Dr. Steven Shin in Los Angeles.[3] 
The start to his 2010 spring training debut was delayed due to the surgery. 
He made his 2010 Grapefruit League debut on March 20, but he showed no 
lingering effects.[4] On December 12, 2010, Ryan was traded to the Seattle 
Mariners for Maikel Cleto. [5] On July 26, 2011, Ryan broke up CC Sabathia's 
bid for a perfect game with a base hit with one out in the seventh inning. 
On August 2, 2011 during a game against the Oakland Athletics, alert play 
by Ryan led to the unusual result of him reaching third on an infield hit. 
Ryan hit a ground ball fielded by Oakland shortstop Eric Sogard, but Sogard 
was left off-balance and his throw to first was late. Behind the back of 
Oakland first baseman Conor Jackson, Ryan ran for second which was left 
uncovered by Sogard, and then immediately for third as that base was also 
uncovered. While referred to in the media as an "infield triple", the play 
was officially scored as a single and fielder's choice.[6] In 2011, Ryan 
finished second for the second straight year in the voting for the Fielding 
Bible Award.[citation needed] During a game against the Chicago White Sox 
on April 21, 2012, Ryan was the final batter who was called out on a disputed 
go-around check swing, which eventually allowed Philip Humber's perfect 
game. On June 8, he entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth inning 
of the Mariner's combined no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers and 
made one of the game's closest putouts by throwing Dee Gordon out at first 
base. On August 15 of that same year, he scored the game's only run in 
the third inning of teammate Félix Hernández's perfect game, the Mariners 
defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. In 2012, he won a Fielding Bible Award as 
the best fielding shortstop in MLB.[7] In 2013, Ryan was replaced as the 
starting shortstop by Brad Miller mid-season, as Ryan had been hitting 
around the Mendoza Line.[8] On September 10, 2013, Ryan was traded to the 
New York Yankees for a player to be named later.[9] On November 18, 2013, 
he agreed to a new contract with the New York Yankees, and on November 
27, 2013, he finalized a deal worth $5 million over two years. His deal 
also includes a club option for $2 million, and a player option for $1 million, 
for the 2016 season. Ryan opened the 2014 season on the 15-day disabled 
list with back issues. As of May 2, 2014, he was on the 15-day disabled 
list with cervical spine nerve damage and was playing rehab games at AA 
Trenton. Ryan played only 49 games in 2014 batting .167 with 8 RBI. Ryan 
began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list due to a right calf strain. 
On August 25, 2015, Ryan made his MLB pitching debut in the eighth inning 
against the Houston Astros, throwing two scoreless innings.[10] Ryan exercised 
his $1 million player option for the 2016 season.[11] On December 17, 2015, 
the Yankees officially announced that Ryan had been the player to be named 
later in their trade with the Chicago Cubs for shortstop Starlin Castro.[12] 
He was released by the Cubs on December 23, 2015.[13] On February 2, 2016, 
the Washington Nationals signed Ryan to a minor league contract with an 
invitation to spring training.[14][15] He did not make the team, but accepted 
an assignment to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League.[16] 
Following an injury to Andrelton Simmons, Ryan was traded to the Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim in exchange for cash considerations and a player to be 
named later on May 10, 2016.[17] He was designated for assignment on May 
28, but was called back up on June 1. Ryan is married and has one child.[18]
