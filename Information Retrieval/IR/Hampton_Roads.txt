Roads is the name of both a body of water in Virginia and the surrounding 
metropolitan region in Southeastern Virginia and Northeastern North Carolina, 
United States. Comprising the Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC 
metropolitan area and an extended Combined Statistical Area that includes 
the Elizabeth City, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area and Kill Devil Hills, 
NC Micropolitan Statistical Area, Hampton Roads is known for its large 
military presence, ice-free harbor, shipyards, coal piers, and miles of 
waterfront property and beaches, all of which contribute to the diversity 
and stability of the region's economy. The body of water known as Hampton 
Roads is one of the world's largest natural harbors (more accurately a 
roadstead or "roads"). It incorporates the mouths of the Elizabeth River, 
Nansemond River, and James River with several smaller rivers and empties 
into the Chesapeake Bay near its mouth leading to the Atlantic Ocean.[3][discuss][4] 
The land area (also known as "Tidewater"[1]) includes a collection of cities, 
counties and towns on the Virginia Peninsula and in South Hampton Roads. 
Some of the outlying areas further from the harbor may or may not be included 
as part of "Hampton Roads", depending upon the organization or usage. For 
example, as defined for federal economic purposes, the Hampton Roads metropolitan 
statistical area (MSA) includes two counties in northeastern North Carolina 
and two counties in Virginia's Middle Peninsula. The Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport 
News, VA–NC MSA has a population of over 1.7 million, making it the 37th-largest 
metropolitan area in the United States.[5][6] The Combined Statistical 
Area includes four additional counties in North Carolina, pushing the regional 
population to over 1.8 million residents, the 32nd largest CSA in the country. 
The area is steeped in 400 years of American history, with hundreds of 
historical sites and attractions that draw visitors from around the world 
each year. The harbor was the key to Hampton Roads' growth, both on land 
and in water-related activities and events. While the harbor and its tributaries 
were (and still are) important transportation conduits, at the same time 
they presented obstacles to land-based commerce and travel. Creating and 
maintaining adequate infrastructure has long been a major challenge. The 
Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel (HRBT) and the Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel 
(MMMBT) are major harbor crossings of the Hampton Roads Beltway interstate, 
which links the large population centers of Hampton Roads. In 2007, the 
Hampton Roads Transportation Authority (HRTA) was formed under a controversial 
state law to levy various additional taxes, fees, and tolls to generate 
funding for major regional transportation projects, including a long-sought 
but costly third crossing of the harbor of Hampton Roads. The term "Hampton 
Roads" is a centuries-old designation that originated when the region was 
a struggling English outpost nearly four hundred years ago. The origin 
of the two words is noteworthy. The word Hampton honors one of the founders 
of the Virginia Company of London and a great supporter of the colonization 
of Virginia, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. The early administrative 
center of the new colony was known as Elizabeth Cittie, named for Princess 
Elizabeth, the daughter of King James I, and formally designated by the 
Virginia Company in 1619. The town at the center of Elizabeth Cittie became 
known as Hampton, and a nearby waterway was designated Hampton Creek (also 
known as Hampton River). Other references to the Earl include the area 
to the north across the bay (in what is now the Eastern Shore) which became 
known as Northampton, and an area south of the James River which became 
Southampton. As with Hampton, both of these names remain in use today. 
The term Roads (short for roadstead) indicates the safety of a port; as 
applied to a body of water, it is "a partly sheltered area of water near 
a shore in which vessels may ride at anchor".[7] Examples of other roadsteads 
are Castle Roads, in another of the Virginia Company's settlements, Bermuda, 
and Lahaina Roads, in Hawaii. In 1755, the Virginia General Assembly recorded 
the name "Hampton Roads" as the channel linking the James, Elizabeth, and 
Nansemond rivers with the Chesapeake Bay.[1] Though it may be a misnomer, 
Hampton Roads has become known as the world's largest natural harbor, in 
part because it is the northernmost major East Coast port of the United 
States which is ice-free year round. (This status is claimed with the notable 
exception of the extraordinarily cold winter of 1917, which was the entire 
U.S.'s coldest year on record.) Over time, the entire region has come to 
be known as "Hampton Roads", a label more specific than its other moniker, 
"Tidewater Virginia", which could, by implication, include other areas 
of tidal land in eastern Virginia. The U.S. Postal Service changed the 
area's postmark from "Tidewater Virginia" to "Hampton Roads, Virginia" 
beginning in 1983.[1] The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport 
News, VA–NC MSA as 16 county-level jurisdictions—five counties and nine 
independent cities in Virginia, and two counties in North Carolina. While 
the borders of what locals call "Hampton Roads" may not perfectly align 
with the definition of the MSA, Hampton Roads is most often the name used 
for the metropolitan area. Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC MSA 
is a U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). According to the 2010 Census, 
its population is 1,676,822[8] and the 2014 estimated population is 1,716,624. 
Since a state constitutional change in 1871, all cities in Virginia are 
independent cities and they are not legally located in a county. The OMB 
considers these independent cities to be county-equivalents for the purpose 
of defining MSAs in Virginia. Each MSA is listed by its counties, then 
cities, in alphabetical order and not by size. The MSA consists of these 
locations in Virginia:[9] The MSA also includes the following locations 
in North Carolina: The Hampton Roads metropolitan area was first defined 
in 1950 as the Norfolk–Portsmouth Metropolitan Statistical Area. It comprised 
the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth and South Norfolk and the 
counties of Norfolk and Princess Anne. In 1952, Virginia Beach separated 
from Princess Anne County. In 1963, Virginia Beach and Princess Anne County 
merged, retaining the name Virginia Beach. The city was added to the MSA 
that year, while South Norfolk lost its metropolitan status. Also in 1963, 
Norfolk County and the City of South Norfolk merged to create the city 
of Chesapeake. In 1973, Chesapeake and Currituck County were added to the 
MSA, while Virginia Beach became a primary city. In 1983, the Newport News–Hampton 
Metropolitan Statistical Area, comprising the cities of Newport News, Hampton, 
Poquoson, Suffolk and Williamsburg, and the counties of Gloucester, James 
City and York, was combined with the Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Portsmouth 
MSA and renamed the Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Newport News MSA. In 1993, Isle 
of Wight, Mathews and Surry counties were added. Although Virginia Beach 
had passed Norfolk as the state's largest city by 1990, it was not made 
the first primary city of the MSA until 2010. As a result of the 2010 Census, 
Gates County, North Carolina was added to the MSA, while Surry County, 
Virginia was removed.[10] The Virginia Beach–Norfolk, VA–NC Combined Statistical 
Area additionally includes the Elizabeth City, North Carolina Micropolitan 
Statistical Area, comprising: and the Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina 
Micropolitan Statistical Area, comprising: As of the 2010 census, the total 
population of this Combined Statistical Area was 1,779,243, with a 2013 
estimate of 1,810,266, a growth of 1.74%. It is currently the 32nd largest 
in the country and the 2nd largest in Virginia, after the Northern Virginia 
portion of the Washington, D.C.–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA. 
The first colonists arrived in 1607 when English Captain Christopher Newport 
landed at Cape Henry, today's City of Virginia Beach, an event now called 
the "First Landing." However, his party moved on, in search of a more defensible 
area upriver, mindful of competitors such as the Spanish, who had built 
a failed settlement on the Virginia Peninsula known as the Ajacán Mission. 
After exploring the James River, they established the first successful 
English colony in the New World on Jamestown Island on May 14, 1607.[11] 
But the low, marshy site proved unhealthy and most of the colonists died, 
before a new Governor, Lord De La Warr (Delaware) arrived with John Rolfe, 
who would establish the Virginia tobacco industry.[11] The harbor and rivers 
of Hampton Roads were immediately recognised as prime locations for commerce, 
shipbuilding and military installations, with the fortifications at Old 
Point Comfort established as early as 1610, and Gosport Navy Yard (later 
Norfolk Naval Shipyard) in 1767. The decisive battle of the Revolution 
was won at Yorktown in 1781, and the first naval action of the War of 1812 
took place in Hampton Roads, when a Royal Naval vessel was seized by the 
American privateer Dash. Later the entrance from Chesapeake Bay was equipped 
with new fortifications (Fort Monroe and Fort Wool), much of the building 
work being supervised by a young military engineer Robert E. Lee. During 
the American Civil War (1861–1865), the historic Battle of Hampton Roads 
between the first American ironclad warships, the USS Monitor and the CSS 
Virginia, took place off Sewell's Point in 1862. The battle was inconclusive, 
but Union forces later took control of Hampton Roads, Norfolk, and the 
lower James River, though they were thwarted from venturing further upstream 
by a strong Confederate battery at Drewry's Bluff. Also in 1862, Fort Monroe 
was the launching place for Union General George McClellan's massive advance 
up the Virginia Peninsula, which almost reached the Confederate capital 
Richmond, before the Seven Days Battles forced him back. In 1865, as the 
Confederacy was near collapse, President Abraham Lincoln met with three 
senior Confederates at Hampton Roads in an unsuccessful bid for a negotiated 
peace.[12] Some former slaves had been camped near Fort Monroe, where they 
were declared to be Contraband of war, instead of being returned to their 
former owners. The camp thus became the first self-contained African American 
community in the United States. Booker T. Washington was among the freedmen 
who attended the local school, which evolved into the present-day Hampton 
University. The Jamestown Exposition for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 
founding of Jamestown was held at Sewell's Point in a rural section of 
Norfolk County in 1907. President Theodore Roosevelt arrived by water in 
the harbor of Hampton Roads, as did other notable persons such as Mark 
Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers, who both arrived aboard the latter's 
steam yacht Kanawha. A major naval display was featured, and the U.S. Great 
White Fleet made an appearance. The leaders of the U.S. Navy apparently 
did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions, as was later proved. 
Beginning in 1917, as the United States became involved in World War I 
under President Woodrow Wilson, formerly rural Sewell's Point became the 
site of what grew to become the largest Naval Base in the world which was 
established by the United States Navy and is now known as the Naval Station 
Norfolk. Twice in the 20th century, families of mostly African American 
heritage were displaced in entire communities when land along the northern 
side of the Peninsula primarily in York County west of Yorktown was taken 
in large tracts for military use during World War I and World War II, creating 
the present-day U.S. Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, which includes Cheatham 
Annex, and a former Seabee base which became Camp Peary. Communities including 
"the Reservation", Halstead's Point, Penniman, Bigler's Mill, and Magruder 
were all lost and absorbed into the large military bases. Although some 
left the area entirely, many of the displaced families chose to relocate 
nearby to Grove, an unincorporated town in southeastern James City County 
where many generations of some of those families now reside. From a population 
estimated at only 37 in 1895, Grove had grown to an estimated 1,100 families 
by the end of the 20th century. (To its north, Grove actually borders the 
Naval Weapons Station property and on its extreme east, a portion of the 
U.S. Army's land at Fort Eustis extends across Skiffe's Creek, although 
there is no direct access to either base). A dream of one Episcopalian 
priest to save his 18th-century church building was to expand to create 
the world's largest living museum. Replacing Jamestown at the end of the 
17th century, Williamsburg had been capital of the Colony and the new State 
of Virginia from 1699 to 1780. After the capital moved to Richmond in 1780, 
Williamsburg became a quieter and sometimes described as "sleepy" small 
town. It saw some action during the Battle of Williamsburg of the 1862 
Peninsula Campaign during the Civil War. However, it was not located along 
any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881. Perhaps 
due to the secure inland location originally known as Middle Plantation, 
for Williamsburg, growth and great expansion of commerce in the 19th century 
did not occur as rapidly as in many other Virginia cities. The main activities 
were The College of William & Mary and Eastern State Hospital, each historic 
institutions in their own right. In addition to the city's historic past, 
quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant, 
although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century. The Reverend 
Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin of Bruton Parish Church initially had wanted merely 
to save his historic church building. This he accomplished by 1907. He 
later served in Rochester, New York for many years. Upon returning to Williamsburg 
in 1923, he began to realize that many of the other colonial-era buildings 
also remained, but were in deteriorating condition, and their continued 
longevity was at risk. Goodwin dreamed of a much larger restoration along 
the lines of what he had accomplished with his historic church. A cleric 
of modest means, he sought support and financing from a number of sources 
before successfully drawing the interests and major financial support of 
Standard Oil heir and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his wife 
Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. The result of their combined efforts was the 
creation of Colonial Williamsburg, which included a restoration of the 
Wren Building at The College of William & Mary and a change of much of 
the downtown Williamsburg area into a 301-acre (1.2 km2) Historic Area 
of restored and replica buildings and surrounds to celebrate the patriots 
and the early history of America. By the 1930s, Colonial Williamsburg had 
become the centerpiece of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia. These 
were, of course, Jamestown, where the colony started, Williamsburg, and 
Yorktown, where independence from Great Britain was won. The three points 
were joined by the U.S. National Park Service's Colonial Parkway, a remarkable 
accomplishment built over a period of 27 years. The Historic Triangle area 
of the Hampton Roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions 
in the entire world. In Dr. Goodwin's words: "Williamsburg is Jamestown 
continued, and Yorktown is Williamsburg vindicated." America's first free 
public schools, the Syms and Eaton free schools (later combined as Syms-Eaton 
Academy), were established in Hampton in 1634 and 1659 respectively. The 
Syms-Eaton Academy was later renamed Hampton Academy and in 1852 became 
part of the public school system, thus Hampton High School lays claim to 
being the oldest public school in the United States.[13] The trust fund 
created from the Syms and Eaton donations has remained intact since the 
17th century and was incorporated into support for the Hampton public school 
system.[14] In 1957, the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel was the first bridge–tunnel 
complex in the world, to be followed by the area's much longer Chesapeake 
Bay Bridge–Tunnel in 1963. This was followed by the Monitor–Merrimac Memorial 
Bridge–Tunnel in 1992. The prevalence of bridge–tunnels in the area is 
due to the number of shipbuilding and naval bases in the area. Access to 
the open ocean from Norfolk Naval Shipyard (in Portsmouth), Naval Station 
Norfolk, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek – Fort Story, and Newport 
News Shipbuilding (where all U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers have been built) 
do not pass under any bridges. Passing under bridges was considered a potential 
threat to the U.S. fleet. In the 1960s, the first astronauts of Project 
Mercury trained at the NASA facility adjacent to Hampton's Langley Air 
Force Base. Local features including Mercury Boulevard and a succession 
of astronaut-name bridges over the Hampton creek commemorate this fact. 
The military has a large presence in the region. Area military facilities 
(alphabetically) include: The area consists of ten independent cities and 
seven counties. Each independent city has the powers and responsibilities 
of a county, including maintaining roads, courts, schools, and public safety. 
Some cities share these responsibilities with an adjoining county. Incorporated 
towns located within counties in Virginia do not operate independently. 
The localities come together to consult on regional issues. Virginia defines 
regional planning districts by law. District members are usually independent 
cities and counties. Localities around the state may belong to more than 
one Planning District, as their constituents may have interests which cross 
over individual planning district boundaries. The Hampton Roads Planning 
District Commission (HRPDC) currently includes 16 cities and counties in 
Virginia, and represents over 1.6 million people. The 16 jurisdictions 
include: There are incorporated towns in three of the counties (Isle of 
Wight, Southampton and Surry) within the district.[15] The differences 
between the service area of the HRPDC and the federally defined metropolitan 
statistical area (MSA) are: The federal government has two major research 
laboratories in the area. NASA-Langley, on the northeast edge of Hampton 
near Poquoson, is the home of a variety of aeronautics research, including 
several one-of-a-kind wind tunnels. The Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson 
National Accelerator Facility (known as 'Jefferson Lab')[16] conducts cutting 
edge physics research in Newport News; the lab hosts the Continuous Electron 
Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF)[17] and a kilowatt-class free-electron 
laser.[18] The water area known as Hampton Roads is a wide channel through 
which the waters of the James River, Nansemond River, and Elizabeth River 
pass (between Old Point Comfort to the north and Sewell's Point to the 
south) into the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Norfolk and Hampton 
Roads are among the worst-hit parts of the United States regarding effects 
of global warming. As of 2016, the region is a few decades ahead in feeling 
the effects of sea-level rise compared to many American coastal areas.[19][20][21][22] 
The geology and topography of the Hampton Roads region is influenced by 
the Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater which is one of three factors contributing 
to the sinking of Hampton Roads at a rate between 15 and 23 centimeters 
(5.9 and 9.1 inches) per century. The region has extensive natural areas, 
including 26 miles (42 km) of Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay beaches, 
the Great Dismal Swamp, picturesque rivers, state parks, wildlife refuges, 
and botanical gardens. Inland from the bay, the region includes Lake Drummond, 
one of only two natural lakes found in Virginia, and miles of waterfront 
property along the various rivers and waterways. The region's native flora 
is consistent with that of the Southeast Coastal Plain and the lower Southeast 
Maritime Forest. The land area which constitutes "Hampton Roads" varies 
depending upon perspective and purpose. Most of the land area of Hampton 
Roads is geographically divided into 2 smaller regions: the eastern portion 
of the Virginia Peninsula (the Peninsula) and South Hampton Roads (locally 
known as "the Southside"), which are separated by the harbor. When speaking 
of communities of Hampton Roads, virtually all sources (including the three 
discussed in the following paragraphs) include the seven major cities, 
two smaller ones, and three counties within those two subregions. In addition, 
the Middle Peninsula counties of Gloucester and Mathews, while not part 
of the geographical Hampton Roads area, are included in the vast metropolitan 
region's population. Also, a small portion of northeastern North Carolina 
(Currituck County) is included in the region's statistics. Due to a peculiarity 
in the drawing of the Virginia-North Carolina border, Knott's Island in 
that county is connected to Virginia by land, but is only accessible to 
other parts of North Carolina across waterways via a ferry system. Each 
of the following current cities, counties and towns is included by at least 
one of the three organizations that define "Hampton Roads" The Hampton 
Roads area consists of nine independent cities (which are not part of any 
county). Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach cover 
the Southside of Hampton Roads while Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, and 
Williamsburg reside on the Peninsula. Franklin borders Suffolk but the 
Census Bureau does not consider it as a part of the metro area.[23] The 
metro area has one county in North Carolina, Currituck. The remaining counties, 
in Virginia, include Isle of Wight and Surry on the Southside, James City 
and York on the Virginia Peninsula, and Gloucester and Mathews on the Middle 
Peninsula. While Southampton is adjacent to Surry, Isle of Wight, and the 
City of Suffolk, the Census Bureau does not consider it part of the metro 
area.[23] Five incorporated towns reside in the metro area including Claremont 
in Surry County, Dendron in Surry County, Smithfield in Isle of Wight County, 
Surry, Surry County's seat, and Windsor in Isle of Wight County. (Two other 
incorporated towns, Boykins and Courtland are located in Southampton County, 
and therefore, like the county within which they are located, are not part 
of the federally defined metropolitan area).[23] Other unincorporated towns 
and communities in the metropolitan area which are not within its cities 
include Gloucester Courthouse and Gloucester Point in Gloucester County, 
Isle of Wight Courthouse, Rushmere, Rescue, Carrollton, Benns Church, and 
Walters in Isle of Wight County, Yorktown, Grafton, Seaford, and Tabb in 
York County, Jamestown, Ford's Colony, Grove, Lightfoot, Toano, and Norge 
in James City County, Moyock, Knotts Island, and Currituck in Currituck 
County, North Carolina.[23] The Hampton Roads MSA, with a population of 
about 1.7 million, is the seventh largest metropolitan area in the Southeastern 
United States after Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WVA-PA MSA, 
Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL MSA, Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, 
GA MSA, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL MSA, Orlando-Kissimmee, FL 
MSA, and Charlotte-Gastonia-Rock Hill, NC-SC MSA. According to the 2010 
Census, the overall racial composition of Hampton Roads was as follows:[24] 
In addition, 5.4% of the population were Hispanic or Latino (of any race). 
57.2% of the population were of non-Hispanic White background. Historically, 
from the earliest times, the harbor was the key to the Hampton Roads area's 
growth, both on land and in water-related activities and events. Ironically, 
the harbor and its tributary waterways were (and still are) both important 
transportation conduits and obstacles to other land-based commerce and 
travel. Yet, the community leaders learned to overcome them. In modern 
times, the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it 
has become largely urbanized, with additional traffic needs. In the 21st 
century, the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based 
travel continue to present the area's leaders with extraordinary transportation 
challenges, both for additional capacity, and as the existing infrastructure, 
much of it originally built with toll revenues, has aged without an adequate 
source of funding to repair or build replacements. The now-closed Kings 
Highway Bridge in Suffolk and the Jordan Bridge closed by neighboring Chesapeake 
in 2008 were each built in the 1920s. These were considered locally prime 
examples of this situation.[25][26] In 2007, the new Hampton Roads Transportation 
Authority (HRTA) was formed under a controversial state law to levy various 
additional taxes to generate funding for major regional transportation 
projects, including a long-sought and costly additional crossing of the 
harbor of Hampton Roads (The Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel, Monitor-Merrimac 
Bridge Tunnel, and the James River Bridge are the existing crossings). 
As of March 2008, although its projects were considered to be needed, the 
agency's future was in some question while its controversial sources of 
funding were being reconsidered in light of a Virginia Supreme Court decision.[27] 
Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, located in Newport News, 
and Norfolk International Airport, in Norfolk, both cater to passengers 
from Hampton Roads. The primary airport for the Virginia Peninsula is the 
Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport. The Airport experienced 
a 4th year of record, double-digit growth through 2011, making it one of 
the fastest growing airports in the country.[28] In 2012 however, the airport 
lost its biggest carrier and has seen massive declines in passenger service, 
culminating in layoffs of police officers and many other staff.[citation 
needed] Norfolk International Airport (IATA: ORF, ICAO: KORF, FAA LID: 
ORF), serves the region. The airport is located near Chesapeake Bay, along 
the city limits of Norfolk and Virginia Beach.[29] Seven airlines provide 
nonstop services to twenty five destinations. ORF had 3,703,664 passengers 
take off or land at its facility and 68,778,934 pounds of cargo were processed 
through its facilities.[30] The Chesapeake Regional Airport provides general 
aviation services and is located on the other side of the Hampton Roads 
Harbor.[31] Amtrak serves the region with Northeast Regional trains to 
its Norfolk, Williamsburg and Newport News stations. The lines run west 
to Richmond then north to Washington, D.C. and major cities north to Boston. 
Connecting buses are available between the Norfolk and Newport News stations 
and from both stations to Virginia Beach. A high-speed rail connection 
at Richmond to both the Northeast Corridor and the Southeast High Speed 
Rail Corridor are also under study.[32][33] Intercity bus service is provided 
by Greyhound Lines (Carolina Trailways) with bus stations in Newport News, 
Hampton, and Norfolk.[34] Transportation within Hampton Roads is served 
by a regional bus service, Hampton Roads Transit.[35] Local routes serving 
Williamsburg, James City County, and upper York County is operated by Williamsburg 
Area Transit Authority.[36] A light rail service known as The Tide was 
constructed in Norfolk. It began service in August 2011.[37] Operated by 
Hampton Roads Transit, it is the first light rail service in the state. 
It is projected to have a daily ridership of between 7,130 and 11,400 passengers 
a day.[38] There has also been a light rail study in the Hampton – Newport 
News areas.[39] The Hampton Roads area has an extensive network of Interstate 
Highways, including the Interstate 64, the major east-west route to and 
from the area, and its spurs and bypasses of I-264, I-464, I-564, and I-664. 
The Hampton Roads Beltway extends 56 miles (90 km) on a long loop through 
the region, crossing the harbor on two toll-free bridge-tunnel facilities. 
These crossings are the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel between Phoebus in 
Hampton and Willoughby Spit in Norfolk and the Monitor-Merrimac Memorial 
Bridge-Tunnel between Newport News and Suffolk. The Beltway connects with 
another Interstate highway and three arterial U.S. Highways at Bower's 
Hill near the northeastern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp. Other major 
east-west routes are U.S. Route 58, U.S. Route 60, and U.S. Route 460. 
The major north-south routes are U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 17. There 
are also two other tunnels in the area, the Midtown Tunnel, and the Downtown 
Tunnel joining Portsmouth and Norfolk, as well as the 17-mile (27 km)-long 
Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, a toll facility which links the region with 
Virginia's Eastern Shore which carries US 13.[40] The original Downtown 
Tunnel in conjunction with the Berkley Bridge were considered a single 
bridge and tunnel complex when completed in 1952, perhaps stimulating the 
innovative bridge-tunnel design using man-made islands when the Hampton 
Roads Bridge-Tunnel was planned, first opening in 1957. The George P. Coleman 
Memorial Bridge is a major toll bridge connecting U.S. Highway 17 on the 
Peninsula at Yorktown with Virginia's Middle Peninsula region. Another 
major crossing of waterways is the James River Bridge, carrying US 17 US 
258, and SR 32 from Newport News to Isle of Wight County.[41] The region 
is notable in that it has 2 types of public transport services via ferries. 
A passenger ferry is operated on the Elizabeth River between downtown areas 
of Norfolk and Portsmouth by HRT.[42] The Jamestown Ferry (also known as 
the Jamestown-Scotland Ferry) is an automobile ferry system on the James 
River connecting Jamestown in James City County with Scotland in Surry 
County. It carries State Route 31. Operated by VDOT, it is the only 24-hour 
state-run ferry operation in Virginia and has over 90 employees. It operates 
four ferryboats, the Pocahontas, the Williamsburg, the Surry, and the Virginia. 
The facility is toll-free.[43] Hampton Roads' individual cities and counties 
administer their own K-12 education for their localities. In addition to 
public education, area residents have many private and religious school 
options. The area also has a number of higher education options for area 
residents. Some offer only associates and technical degrees and certificates, 
while others award advanced degrees, including doctorates. Some are publicly 
funded, but the region also has a number of private and for-profit colleges. 
Additionally, a number of universities have established satellite campuses 
in the region. The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg was founded 
in 1693 and has served as the second oldest institution of higher education 
in the United States.[44] Old Dominion University, founded as the Norfolk 
Division of the College of William and Mary in 1930, became an independent 
institution in 1962 and now offers degrees in 68 undergraduate and 95 (60 
masters/35 doctoral) graduate degree programs. Norfolk's Eastern Virginia 
Medical School, founded as a community medical school by the surrounding 
jurisdictions in 1973, is noted for its research into reproductive medicine[45] 
and is located in the region's major medical complex in the Ghent district. 
Norfolk State University is the largest majority black university in Virginia 
and offers degrees in a wide variety of liberal arts.[46] Christopher Newport 
University serves as a public university and is located in Newport News.[47] 
Regent University, a private university founded by Christian Evangelist 
and Leader Pat Robertson, has historically focused on graduate education 
but is attempting to establish an undergraduate program as well.[48] Atlantic 
University, associated with the Edgar Cayce organization's Association 
for Research and Enlightenment (ARE), offers instruction in New Age subjects 
and an M.A. in Transpersonal Studies.[49] Virginia Wesleyan College is 
a small private liberal arts college on the border of Norfolk and Virginia 
Beach.[50] Hampton University, a private HBCU university, has a long history 
serving Hampton.[51] Several universities based outside Hampton Roads offer 
a limited selection of classes in the area. Virginia Tech and University 
of Virginia have established a joint teaching center in Newport News. George 
Washington University and Averett University also maintain campuses there. 
Troy State University, Florida International University, and Saint Leo 
University offer classes, primarily connected to one or more of the area's 
military bases. The National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) is a consortium 
of member universities: Georgia Tech, Hampton University, North Carolina 
A&T, North Carolina State, Old Dominion University, University of Virginia, 
Virginia Tech, the College of William and Mary, and Christopher Newport 
University. Their unique approach allows students pursuing M.S. and Ph.D. 
degrees the opportunity to take classes from any member university taught 
at the Institute. Area residents also have options for training for technical 
professions. The Apprentice School was founded in 1919 and offers four/five-year 
programs in mechanical and technical fields associated with the shipbuilding 
industry. Graduates from the Apprentice School go on to work at the Newport 
News Shipbuilding.[52] Technology-focused ECPI University has campuses 
in Virginia Beach and Newport News[53] while ITT Technical Institute has 
a campus in Norfolk. Bryant & Stratton College has campuses in Virginia 
Beach Town Center and Peninsula Town Center.[54] The Culinary Institute 
of Virginia[55] is located in Norfolk. The Art Institute of Virginia Beach 
offers programs in the media arts, design and culinary arts fields. Three 
institutions in the Virginia Community College System offer affordable 
higher education options for area residents. Tidewater Community College 
in Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth, Paul D. Camp Community 
College in Suffolk, Franklin, and Smithfield, and Thomas Nelson Community 
College in Hampton and Williamsburg offer two-year degrees and specialized 
training programs.[56][57] Bible training schools include Hampton University 
and Regent University, but also Canaan Theological College & Seminary, 
Bethel College and Victory Baptist Bible College and Seminary in Hampton, 
Tabernacle Baptist Bible College & Theological Seminary, Central Baptist 
Theological Seminary in Virginia Beach, Providence Bible College & Theological 
Seminary in Norfolk and the Hampton Roads campus of the John Leland Center 
for Theological Studies. Hampton Roads is home to four Fortune 500 companies. 
Representing the food industry, transportation, retail and shipbuilding, 
these four companies are located in Smithfield, Norfolk, Chesapeake and 
Newport News. Hampton Roads has become known as the "world's greatest natural 
harbor". The port is located only 18 miles (29 km) from open ocean on one 
of the world's deepest, natural ice-free harbors. Since 1989, Hampton Roads 
has been the mid-Atlantic leader in U.S. waterborne foreign commerce and 
is ranked second nationally behind the Port of South Louisiana based on 
export tonnage. When import and export tonnage are combined, the Port of 
Hampton Roads ranks as the third largest port in the country (following 
the ports of New Orleans/South Louisiana and Houston). In 1996, Hampton 
Roads was ranked ninth among major U.S. ports in vessel port calls with 
approximately 2,700. In addition, this port is the U.S. leader in coal 
exports. The coal loading facilities in the Port of Hampton Roads are able 
to load in excess of 65 million tons annually, giving the port the largest, 
most efficient and modern coal loading facilities in the world. It is little 
surprise therefore that the Hampton Roads region's economic base is largely 
port-related, including shipbuilding, ship repair, naval installations, 
cargo transfer and storage, and manufacturing related to the processing 
of imports and exports. Associated with the ports' military role are almost 
50,000 federal civilian employees. The harbor of Hampton Roads is an important 
highway of commerce, especially for the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, 
and Newport News. Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Newport News 
Shipbuilding and Drydock Company), was created in 2008 as a spinoff of 
Northrop Grumman Newport News and is the world's largest shipyard. It is 
located a short distance up the James River. In Portsmouth, a few miles 
up the Elizabeth River, the historic Norfolk Naval Shipyard is located. 
BAE Systems, formerly known as NORSHIPCO, operates from sites in the City 
of Norfolk. There are also several smaller shipyards, numerous docks and 
terminals. Massive coal piers and loading facilities were established in 
the late 19th and early 20th century by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway 
(C&O), Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W), and Virginian Railway (VGN). 
The latter two were predecessors of the Norfolk Southern Railway, a Class 
I railroad which has its headquarters in Norfolk, and continues to export 
coal from a large facility at Lambert's Point on the Elizabeth River. CSX 
Transportation now serves the former C&O facility at Newport News. (The 
VGN's former coal facility at Sewell's Point has been gone since the 1960s, 
and the property is now part of the expansive Norfolk Navy Base). Almost 
80% of the region's economy is derived from federal sources. This includes 
the large military presence, but also NASA and facilities of the Departments 
of Energy, Transportation, Commerce and Veterans Affairs. The region also 
receives a substantial impact in government student loans and grants, university 
research grants, and federal aid to cities. The Hampton Roads area has 
the largest concentration of military bases and facilities of any metropolitan 
area in the world. Nearly one-fourth of the nation's active-duty military 
personnel are stationed in Hampton Roads, and 45% of the region's $81B 
gross regional output is Defense-related.[59][60] All five military services' 
operating forces are there, as well as several major command headquarters: 
Hampton Roads is a chief rendezvous of the United States Navy, and the 
area is home to the Allied Command Transformation, which is the only major 
military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on U.S. 
soil. Langley Air Force Base is home to Air Combat Command (ACC). The Norfolk 
Navy Base is located at Sewell's Point near the mouth, on the site used 
for the tercentennial Jamestown Exposition in 1907. For a width of 500 
feet (150 m) the Federal government during 1902 through 1905 increased 
its minimum depth at low water from 25.5 to 30 feet (8 to 9 m), and the 
channel has now been dredged to a depth of 55 feet (17 m) in some places. 
NASA's Langley Research Center, located on the Peninsula adjacent to Langley 
Air Force Base in Hampton, is home to scientific and aerospace technology 
research. The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (commonly 
known as Jefferson Labs) is located nearby in Newport News. The area's 
experiences with commercial and retail centers began early in 1918. Afton 
Square, located in the Cradock naval community of Portsmouth, was the first 
planned shopping center in the USA and has served as template for future 
developments throughout the nation.[61] Hampton Roads experienced tremendous 
growth during and after World War II. In the 1950s, a trend in retail was 
the shopping center, a group of stores along a common sidewalk adjacent 
to off-street parking, usually in a suburban location. In 1959, one of 
the largest on the east coast of the USA was opened at the northeast corner 
of Military Highway and Virginia Beach Boulevard on property which had 
formally been used as an airfield. The new JANAF Shopping Center, located 
in Norfolk, featured acres of free parking and dozens of stores. Backed 
by retired military personnel, the name JANAF was an acronym for Joint 
Army Navy Air Force.[62] During the 1950s and early 1960s, other shopping 
centers in Hampton Roads were developed, such as Wards Corner Shopping 
Center, Downtown Plaza Shopping Center and Southern Shopping Center in 
Norfolk; Mid-City Shopping Center in Portsmouth; Hilltop Shopping Center 
(now known as The Shops at Hilltop) in Virginia Beach; Riverdale Shopping 
Center in Hampton and the Warwick-Denbigh Shopping Center in Newport News. 
In the late-1960s, a new type of shopping center came to Hampton Roads: 
the Indoor Shopping Mall. In 1965, South Hampton Roads broke ground on 
its first shopping mall in Virginia Beach, known as Pembroke Mall. The 
mall opened in 1966, and became Hampton Road's newest indoor shopping destination. 
The Virginia Peninsula had its first indoor shopping mall in 1973, with 
Coliseum Mall. Coliseum Mall drew so much traffic from Interstate 64, that 
a towering flyover was built at the Mercury Boulevard and Coliseum Drive 
intersection, to accommodate eastbound mall traffic, from the Mercury Boulevard 
interchange. Coliseum Mall was demolished to make way for the open air 
mixed-use development Peninsula Town Center. Also in the 1970s, Tower Mall 
was built in Portsmouth, but was torn down and turned into the Victory 
Crossing shopping development. In Norfolk, Military Circle Mall on Military 
Highway was built across Virginia Beach Boulevard from the large JANAF 
Shopping Center with its own high-rise hotel right in the center. In 1981, 
Greenbrier Mall gave Chesapeake a shopping mall of its own as well, and 
Virginia Beach got the massive Lynnhaven Mall the same year. MacArthur 
Center opened in March 1999, which made downtown Norfolk a prime shoppers 
destination, with the region's first Nordstrom department store anchor. 
MacArthur Center is compared to other downtown malls, such as Baltimore's 
Harborplace, Indianapolis' Circle Centre Mall, Atlanta's Lenox Square Mall 
and most comparably to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City near Washington, 
D.C., in Arlington, Virginia. Currently, Virginia Beach's Lynnhaven Mall 
is the region's largest shopping center with nearly 180 stores, and is 
one of the region's biggest tourist draws, with the Virginia Beach Oceanfront, 
Colonial Williamsburg, Busch Gardens Williamsburg: The Old Country and 
MacArthur Center. For a long time, the indoor shopping malls were seen 
as largely competitive with small shopping centers and traditional downtown 
type areas. However, in the 1990s and since, the "big-box stores" on the 
Peninsula and Southside, such as Wal-mart, Home Depot, and Target have 
been creating a new competitive atmosphere for the shopping malls of Hampton 
Roads. Several older malls such as Pembroke and Military Circle have since 
their grand openings been renovated, and others have been closed and torn 
down. Newmarket North Mall is now NetCenter, a business center (the Sears 
store remains). Coliseum Mall, in Hampton, has been redeveloped as Peninsula 
Town Center in a new style, in step with the latest commercial real estate 
trend: the nationwide establishment of "lifestyle centers". Additional 
malls which have closed include Mercury Mall in Hampton (converted to Mercury 
Plaza Shopping Center in the mid-1980s, then completely torn down in 2001), 
and Tower Mall in Portsmouth (Built in the early 1970s, then torn down 
in 2001). In late 2006, the Hampton Roads Partnership, a non-profit organization 
representing 17 localities (ten cities, six counties, and one town), all 
local universities and major military commands as well as leading businesses 
in southeastern Virginia, commenced a campaign aimed at branding the land 
area of Hampton Roads as "America's First Region". The new title is based 
on events in 1607 when English Captain Christopher Newport's three ships 
– the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery landed at Cape Henry along 
the Atlantic Coast in what is today Virginia Beach. After 18 days of exploring 
the area, the ships and their crews arrived at Jamestown Island where they 
established the first English speaking settlement to survive in the New 
World on May 14, 1607. Because the region's east-west boundaries (now the 
City of Virginia Beach and James City County) have not changed since 1607, 
the Partnership felt justified in labeling Hampton Roads "America's First 
Region". It unveiled the new brand before 800 people at the annual meeting 
of the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce on December 13, 2006. A video 
shown that afternoon included endorsements from mayors and county board 
of supervisors chairs representing Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg 
and James City County as well as the Governor of Virginia, Timothy Kaine.[63][citation 
needed] The mission of Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance (HREDA) 
is a non-profit organization dedicated to business attraction—marketing 
the Hampton Roads region as the preferred location for business investment 
and expansion. HREDA represents the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport 
News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg 
and Franklin, as well as the counties of Gloucester, James City, Isle of 
Wight, York, and Southampton.[64] In 1998, a flag representing the Hampton 
Roads region was adopted. The design of the flag was created by a contest. 
The winner, sixteen-year-old Andrew J. Wall of Frank W. Cox High School 
in Virginia Beach, raised the new regional flag for the first time on the 
mast of a ship moored in the harbor. As conceived by student Andrew Wall 
and embellished by the selection committee, his flag is highly symbolic: 
The area is most often associated with the larger American South. People 
who have grown up in the Hampton Roads area have a unique Tidewater accent 
which sounds different from a stereotypical Southern accent. Vowels have 
a longer pronunciation than in a regular southern accent.[66] There's also 
a wealth of other points of history to explore in the Hampton Roads area. 
Led by the Historic Triangle area, Hampton Roads consistently rates among 
the top tourism destinations in the world. Cultural attractions include 
museums, historical sites, and venues from tiny to massively large for 
such things as art and musical shows. The region hosts two week-long visits 
by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus each year with multiple 
performances at Norfolk Scope and the Hampton Coliseum, and even attracts 
a group of Circus Train Enthusiasts, railfans who watch, photograph and 
report on the blue or red unit trains as they make their move between the 
two sites, requiring a long inland trip through Petersburg and Richmond 
in order to avoid crossing the 10-mile (16 km) geographical distance across 
the harbor (a trip impassable directly by modern trains; the two bridge-tunnel 
facilities operated by VDOT accommodate only highway traffic). The Historic 
Triangle is located on the Virginia Peninsula and includes the colonial 
communities of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, with many restored 
attractions linked by the Colonial Parkway. The National Park Service's 
Colonial Parkway joins the three popular attractions of Colonial Virginia 
with a scenic and bucolic roadway carefully shielded from views of commercial 
development. This helps visitors mentally return to the past, and there 
are often views of wildlife and waterfowl. This two lane roadway is the 
best (but not quickest) way to move between the three points. Near the 
James River and York River ends of the parkway, there are several pull-offs, 
where some families allow their children to feed bread to the seagulls. 
Commercial vehicles, except for tour buses, are prohibited. For an even 
better experience, approach the area from the south by water from Surry 
County with a ride aboard one of the Jamestown Ferrys, which include the 
Pocahontas and Williamsburg. As passengers cross, they can walk about the 
boat or go up to an enclosed viewing level with restrooms. Weather and 
daylight permitting, passengers usually see Jamestown Island much as the 
first colonists may have approached it. In fact, the replicas of Christopher 
Newport's the three tiny ships, Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery 
are docked near the northern ferry landing at Glass House Point. Both the 
Jamestown Ferry and Colonial Parkway are toll-free. The first permanent 
English settlement in the New World which was established at Jamestown 
in 1607. The 350th anniversary celebration at Jamestown Festival Park in 
1957 was so popular, tourism has been continuously increasing ever since. 
The 400th anniversary was celebrated with an 18-month-long celebration 
called Jamestown 2007. Today, at Jamestown, you can visit recreations of 
an American Indian village and colonial fort, and archaeological sites 
where current work is underway by archaeologistss from the Jamestown Rediscovery 
project, with recently recovered archaeological artifacts in a new display 
building. Replicas of the three ships, Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery 
are docked nearby. The two major attractions, which are complementary to 
each other, are the state-sponsored Jamestown Settlement near the entrance 
to Jamestown Island, and the National Park Service's Historic Jamestowne, 
on Jamestown Island itself. In 1699, the first capital of Virginia was 
moved to Middle Plantation at the suggestion of students from the College 
of William & Mary (established 1693). It was soon renamed to Williamsburg, 
but became a largely forgotten little town after the capital was moved 
to Richmond in 1780. Largely due to the 20th-century preservation efforts 
of the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Bruton Parish Church and 
the generosity of Standard Oil heir John D. Rockefeller Jr., today Colonial 
Williamsburg is a large living museum of early American life. It has dozens 
of restored and recreated buildings and reenactors. It is one of the most 
popular tourist destinations in the world. The Visitor's Center (right 
off the Colonial Parkway) features a short movie and is an excellent place 
to start (and leave automobiles, which are restricted from the restored 
area, where wheelchair-accessible shuttle bus service is provided). Bassett 
Hall, an 18th-century farmhouse, is located in Williamsburg just southeast 
of the Historic Area, was the Williamsburg home for over 25 years of the 
family of John D. Rockefeller Jr and his family from the mid-1930s until 
1960, following over 7 years of restoration and expansions. The Rockefeller 
family bequeathed Bassett Hall to Colonial Williamsburg in 1979.[67] The 
home is now open to the public and appears much as it did in the 1930s 
and 1940s when the Rockefellers made it their home.[68] The third point 
of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia is Yorktown where General 
Cornwallis surrendered to George Washington in 1781, ending the American 
Revolution. There are two large visitor centers, battlefield drives, and 
a waterfront area. Notwithstanding the amazingly successful efforts to 
provide a non-commercial atmosphere at the three Historic Triangle areas 
(and on the Colonial Parkway between them), there are many hotels, motels, 
campgrounds, restaurants, shops and stores, gasoline stations, and amusements 
close by. The Mariners' Museum, founded in 1930 by Archer and Anna Huntington, 
is an institution dedicated to bringing maritime history to the world. 
It is currently home to the USS Monitor Center where 210 tons of artifacts 
recovered from the USS Monitor are held, including the gun turret. The 
museum also consists of a 550-acre park and Lake Maury, through which is 
the five-mile Noland Trail. The permanent collection at the museum totals 
about 32,000 objects, equally divided between works of art and three-dimensional 
objects. The Mariners' Museum Library and Archive, now located in the Trible 
Library at Christopher Newport University, consists of over 78,000 books, 
800,000 photographs, films and negatives, and over one million archival 
pieces, making it the largest maritime library in the Western Hemisphere.[69] 
The Virginia War Museum covers American military history. The museum's 
collection includes, weapons, vehicles, artifacts, uniforms and posters 
from various periods of American history. Highlights of the museum's collection 
include a section of the Berlin Wall and the outer wall from Dachau Concentration 
Camp.[70] The Virginia Living Museum, first established in 1966, combines 
the elements of a native wildlife park, science museum, aquarium, botanical 
preserve, and planetarium. The exhibits are themed on the geographic regions 
of Virginia, from the Appalachian Mountains to the offshore waters of the 
Atlantic Ocean, and includes more than 245 different animal species.[71] 
The Peninsula Fine Arts Center in Newport News contains a rotating gallery 
of art exhibits. The center also contains a Studio Art School of private 
and group instruction for all ages. It maintains a permanent "Hands On 
For Kids" gallery designed for children and families to interact in what 
the center describes as "a fun, educational environment that encourages 
participation with art materials and concepts."[72] The Hampton University 
museum was established in 1868 in the heart of the historic Hampton University 
campus. The museum is the oldest African American museum in the United 
States and one of the oldest museums in the State of Virginia. It contains 
over 9,000 objects, including African American fine arts, traditional African, 
Native American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Island, and Asian art.[73] The 
Charles H. Taylor Arts Center is Hampton's public access arts center. It 
offers a series of changing visual art exhibitions as well as a quarterly 
schedule of classes, workshops and educational programs.[74] The Downing-Gross 
Cultural Arts Center in SE Newport News contains a community-based art 
gallery, as well as arts classrooms and the Ella Fitzgerald Theater.[75] 
The Casemate Museum (where former Confederate President Jefferson Davis 
was imprisoned) is at Fort Monroe in the historic Phoebus area at Old Point 
Comfort in Hampton.[76] NASA Langley Research Center is in Hampton, the 
original training ground for the Mercury Seven, Gemini, and Apollo Astronauts. 
Visitors are able to learn about the region's aviation history at the Virginia 
Air and Space Center in Hampton.[77] Air Power Park is an outdoor on-site 
display of various aircraft and a space capsule. It is located on Mercury 
Boulevard at the intersection of LaSalle Blvd, near the AF Base. The Biblical 
Art Gallery at Ivy Farms Baptist Church is Virginia's largest collection 
of pre-1900s religious art. The Chrysler Museum of Art, located in the 
Ghent district of Norfolk, is the region's foremost art museum and is considered 
by the New York Times to be the finest in the state.[79] Of particular 
note is the extensive glass collection and American neoclassical marble 
sculptures. Nauticus, the National Maritime Center, opened on the downtown 
waterfront in 1994. It features hands-on exhibits, interactive theaters, 
aquaria, digital high-definition films and an extensive variety of educational 
programs. Since 2000, Nauticus has been home to the battleship USS Wisconsin, 
one of the last battleships to be built in the United States. It served 
briefly in World War II and later in the Korean and Gulf Wars.[80] The 
General Douglas MacArthur Memorial, located in the 19th-century Norfolk 
court house and city hall in downtown, contains the tombs of the late General 
and his wife, a museum and a vast research library, personal belongings 
(including his famous corncob pipe) and a short film that chronicles the 
life of the famous General of the Army.[81] Also in downtown Norfolk and 
inside Nauticus is the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, an official U.S. Navy 
museum that focuses on the 220 plus year history of the Navy within the 
region. The Children's Museum of Virginia in Portsmouth has one of the 
largest collection of model electric trains and other toys. The Norfolk 
Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth is one of the oldest shipyards and has the 
first dry dock on display. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge 
(in Suffolk and Chesapeake) is accessed from U.S. Route 17 in Chesapeake. 
The Suffolk-Nansemond Museum is in the restored Seaboard and Virginian 
Railway passenger train station in Suffolk. The Isle of Wight Museum is 
in Smithfield. The Contemporary Art Center of Virginia located in Virginia 
Beach features the significant art of our time. The Hampton Roads region 
has a thriving music scene, with a heavy concentration thereof in the Virginia 
Beach, Chesapeake, and Norfolk areas. Many clubs, venues, and festivals 
exist within the region, all playing host to a wide variety of musical 
styles. There are a few hundred bands that play routinely in the region, 
spanning multiple genres. There are also twenty to thirty musical acts 
based in the region that perform throughout Hampton Roads and its surrounding 
areas on a "full-time" basis. In addition, plenty of well known acts have 
come from the area. Some of the major rock/pop artists include Bruce Hornsby, 
Gary "U.S." Bonds, Juice Newton, Mae, Seven Mary Three, Gene Vincent, Keller 
Williams, and Steve Earle. Ella Fitzgerald is the most recognizable jazz 
musician from the area. Robert Cray and Ruth Brown are both prominent blues 
and R&B artists. Tommy Newsom is another famous jazz musician. Many prominent 
rap and hip hop artists come from the area including Chad Hugo, Clipse, 
Magoo, Missy Elliott, Nicole Wray, Pharrell Williams, Quan, Teddy Riley, 
and Timbaland. The region has a number of venues hosting live music and 
performances. Several of the larger (in order of maximum seating capacity) 
are: Dozens of much smaller commercial establishments offer live music 
and other entertainment such as comedy shows and mystery dinner-theater 
throughout the region. The Norfolk Botanical Garden, opened in 1939, is 
a 155-acre (0.6 km2) botanical garden and arboretum located near the Norfolk 
International Airport. It is open year round.[82] The Virginia Zoological 
Park, opened in 1900, is a 65-acre (260,000 m2) zoo with hundreds of animals 
on display, including the critically endangered Siberian tiger and threatened 
white rhino.[83] First Landing State Park and False Cape State Park are 
both located in coastal areas in Virginia Beach. Both offer camping facilities, 
cabins, and outdoor recreation activities in addition to nature and history 
tours. First Landing is the site of Cape Henry while False Cape is located 
at the southeastern end of Virginia Beach.[84][85] Newport News Park is 
located in the northern part of the city of Newport News. The city's golf 
course also lies within the park along with camping and outdoor activities. 
There are over 30 miles (48 km) of trails in the Newport News Park complex. 
The park has a 5.3-mile (8.5-km) multi-use bike path. The park offers bicycle 
and helmet rental, and requires helmet use by children under 14. Newport 
News Park also offers an archery range, disc golf course, and an "aeromodel 
flying field" for remote-controlled aircraft, complete with a 400 ft (120 m) 
runway.[86] The region also has amusement parks which attract tourists 
and locals alike. The Virginia Beach Oceanfront has Atlantic Fun Park (formerly 
called "Virginia Beach Amusement Park"). Virginia Beach also has Ocean 
Breeze Waterpark, Shipwreck Golf, and Motor World which were formerly combined 
into one as "Ocean Breeze Fun Park". As separate parks, they provide miniature 
golf, go-karts, water slides, pools, climbing wall, paintball area, and 
kiddie rides.[87][88] Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Water Country USA 
are the major theme parks in Williamsburg. normal seating capacity in parentheses 
Hampton Roads has a number of public and private golf courses.[90] Three 
daily newspapers serve Hampton Roads: The Virginian-Pilot in the Southside, 
the The Daily Press on the Peninsula, and the six days a week Suffolk News-Herald 
that serves Suffolk and Franklin.[95] Smaller publications include the 
Williamsburg-James City County area's twice-weekly Virginia Gazette (the 
state's oldest newspaper[96]), the New Journal and Guide, and Inside Business, 
the area's only business newspaper. Newspapers serving the Hampton Roads 
area include: Coastal Virginia Magazine is one of the region's city and 
lifestyle magazine. The publication is published eight times a year and 
covers all of Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore of Virginia.[97] Coastal 
Virginia Magazine was formerly known as Hampton Roads Magazine. Hampton 
Roads Times serves as an online magazine for the region. Suffolk Living 
Magazine is another of the region's city and lifestyle magazines. The publication 
is published four times a year and covers the City of Suffolk. Suffolk 
Publications also produces Virginia-Carolina Boomers, a regional guide 
for Boomers in the area, which comes out twice a year.[98] The Hampton 
Roads designated market area (DMA) is the 42nd largest in the U.S. with

North Carolina, WGBS-LD broadcasting on channel 11 from Hampton, and WTPC 
21, a TBN affiliate out of Virginia Beach. Most Hampton Roads localities 
are served by Cox Cable which provides LNC 5, a local 24-hour cable news 
television network. Suffolk, Franklin, Isle of Wight, and Southampton are 
served by Charter Communications.[100] Verizon FiOS service is currently 
available in parts of the region and continues to expand, offering a non-satellite 
alternative to Cox. DirecTV and Dish Network are also popular as an alternative 
to cable television. Norfolk is served by a variety of radio stations on 
the FM and AM dials, with towers located around the Hampton Roads area. 
These cater to many different interests, including news, talk radio, and 
sports, as well as an eclectic mix of musical interests.[101] Norfolk serves 
as home to two professional franchises, the Norfolk Tides of the International 
League and the Norfolk Admirals of the ECHL.[102] The Tides play at Harbor 
Park, seating 12,067 and opened in 1993. The Admirals play at Norfolk Scope 
Arena, seating 8,725 or 13,800 festival seating, which opened in 1971. 
The Peninsula Pilots play in the Coastal Plain League, a summer baseball 
league. The Pilots play in Hampton at War Memorial Stadium seating 5,125 
and opened in 1948.[103] On the collegiate level, four Division I programs—two 
on the Southside and two on the Peninsula—field teams in many sports, including 
football, basketball, and baseball; three currently play football in the 
second-tier FCS, while ODU recently moved up to the FBS football. The Southside 
boasts the Old Dominion Monarchs and the Norfolk State Spartans, both in 
Norfolk, while the Peninsula features the William & Mary Tribe in Williamsburg 
and Hampton Pirates in Hampton. W&M is a member of the Colonial Athletic 
Association. Norfolk State and Hampton, both historically black institutions,

joined Conference USA, an FBS football conference, as a full FBS member 
in 2015. The area also has two Division III programs, one in each subregion—the 
Virginia Wesleyan Marlins on the border of Virginia Beach and Norfolk,[108] 
and the Christopher Newport University Captains in Newport News. The Captains 
sponsor fourteen sports and currently compete in the USA South Athletic 
Conference,[109] but will move to the Capital Athletic Conference in July 
2013. The Hampton Coliseum, seating 10,761 to 13,800 festival seating,

Virginia Beach serves as home to two soccer teams, the Hampton Roads Piranhas, 
a men's team in the Premier Development League, and a women's team by the 
same name in the W-League. The Piranhas play at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex. 
The Virginia Beach Sportsplex, seating 11,541 and opened in 1999, contains 
the central training site for the U.S. women's national field hockey team.[110] 
The Sportsplex will be expanded to accommodate the Virginia Destroyers, 
an expansion franchise in the United Football League for the 2011 UFL season. 
The North American Sand Soccer Championships, a beach soccer tournament, 
is held annually on the beach in Virginia Beach. Virginia Beach is also 
home to the East Coast Surfing Championships, an annual contest of more 
than 100 of the world's top professional surfers and an estimated 400 amateur 
surfers. This is North America's oldest surfing contest, and features combined 
cash prizes of $40,000.[111] Langley Speedway in Hampton, seating 6,500, 
hosts stock car races every weekend during spring, summer, and early fall.[112] 
The Kingsmill Championship, an event on the LPGA Tour, is contested annually 
on Mother's Day weekend at Kingsmill Resort near Williamsburg. The Norfolk 
Nighthawks were a charter member of the Arena Football League's minor league, 
af2. They ceased operations in 2003 after their fourth season. Also, the 
Virginia Beach Mariners of soccer's USL First Division were active from 
1994 until 2006. Hampton Roads has hosted many professional wrestling events 
throughout the years. The Norfolk Scope has served as the site of these 
events, including Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Destination X, World 
Championship Wrestling's Starrcade and World War 3, and WWF/WWE's The Great 
American Bash and the 2011 Slammy Awards.[113] Norfolk Scope was also the 
site of an infamous episode of WCW Monday Nitro, where several members 
of the World Wrestling Federation stable D-Generation X literally drove 
a tank to the entryway of the Scope, thus "invading" the competition. The 
Hampton Coliseum has also hosted many events, including RAW, in April 1998, 
August 2005, May 2007, January 2008, and July 2011, as well as SmackDown! 
and for ECW on Sci Fi on December 2006. In January 2008, WWE broadcast 
its first television show taped in high definition from Hampton, Virginia. 
The Hampton Roads area is also home to at least one professional wrestling 
promotion, Vanguard Championship Wrestling, which holds events throughout 
the region, and has a weekly television show on the local Fox affiliate. 
In 1997, Norfolk presented a proposal to bring an expansion hockey team 
to Hampton Roads, but that initiative failed. The team was going to be 
called the Hampton Roads Rhinos. In 2002, Norfolk presented a proposal 
to bring the Charlotte Hornets basketball team to southeastern Virginia, 
but New Orleans won the bid for the team, renaming it the New Orleans Hornets. 
In 2004, Norfolk presented a proposal to bring the Montreal Expos baseball 
team to the metro area, but Washington, D.C. won the bid for the team, 
renaming it the Washington Nationals. In 1998, 2001, 2006, and 2010 Hampton 
Roads was hosting the AAU Junior Olympics.[114] In 2012, there were talks 
of the Sacramento Kings of the NBA moving to a proposed new arena in Virginia 
Beach near the Oceanfront.[115] Hampton Roads is 130 miles (210 km) from 
the nearest major sports teams in Washington, D.C. and Raleigh, North Carolina. 
Another significant issue with the area as a sports market is internal 
transportation. The metropolitan area is split into two distinct parts 
by its eponymous harbor; as of 2012, the harbor has only three widely separated 
road crossings (the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, Monitor-Merrimac Memorial 
Bridge-Tunnel, and James River Bridge), each with two lanes of traffic 
in each direction. In addition, the area has two other major tunnels, plus 
several drawbridges on key highway corridors. Hampton Roads previously 
hosted a successful franchise in the American Basketball Association, although 
it was never a full-time home for that team. Its highest-ranking teams 
as of 2015 are the Norfolk Admirals of the ECHL, and the Norfolk Tides 
of the IL. Virginia is also the most populous state without a major team 
playing within its borders, though its northern reaches are served by the 
Washington clubs—two of which, the NHL's Capitals and NFL's Redskins, have 
their operational headquarters and practice facilities in Virginia. Redskins 
owner Daniel Snyder, through a separate company, owns two radio stations, 
WXTG and WXTG-FM, in the Norfolk market. The Hampton Roads television market
