Ferguson Arthur "Fergie" Jenkins, Jr., CM (born December 13, 1942)[1] is 
a Canadian former professional baseball player. He was a Major League Baseball 
(MLB) pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, 
and Boston Red Sox, from 1965 through 1983. He also played basketball in 
the off-season for the Harlem Globetrotters from 1967 to 1969, and pitched 
two seasons in Canada for the minor league London Majors following his 
major league career.[2] In 1991, Jenkins became the first Canadian to be 
inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.[3] Jenkins played the 
majority of his career for the Cubs. He was a National League (NL) and 
Cubs All-Star for three seasons, and in 1971, he was the first Canadian 
and Cubs pitcher to win a Cy Young Award. He was a 20-game winner for seven 
seasons, including six consecutive seasons for the Cubs. He was the NL 
leader in wins, in 1971, and the American League (AL) leader in wins, in 
1974. He was also the NL leader in complete games in 1967, 1970, and 1971, 
and the AL leader in complete games in 1974. He led the NL in strikeouts 
in 1969 and had over 3,000 strikeouts during his career. Jenkins was born 
and raised in Chatham, Ontario, the only child of Delores and Ferguson 
Jenkins, Sr.[2] His father, a chef and chauffeur,[4] immigrated from Barbados, 
while his mother was a descendant of American slaves who escaped through 
the Underground Railroad, before settling in Southwestern Ontario.[2] Both 
of his parents were good athletes; his father was an amateur boxer and 
semi-pro baseball player. A talented athlete, Jenkins competed in track 
and field, ice hockey, and basketball in his school years, lettering five 
times. When he began playing bantam baseball in his teens, he started out 
as a first baseman. He honed his pitching skills by throwing pieces of 
coal from a local coal yard, aiming at either an open ice chute or the 
gaps of passing boxcars.[2] He was also encouraged to continue working 
on his pitching by Gene Dziadura, a former shortstop in the Chicago Cubs 
minor league system, and a Philadelphia Phillies scout. Many training sessions 
between the two followed until Jenkins graduated from high school. In 1962, 
Jenkins was signed by Philadelphia Phillies scout Tony Lucadello.[2] Jenkins 
made his major-league debut as a 22-year-old in 1965, as a relief pitcher. 
He was traded the following year to the Chicago Cubs, along with Adolfo 
Phillips and John Herrnstein, for pitchers Larry Jackson and Bob Buhl. 
Jenkins would become one of the best pitchers in the majors. In his first 
full year as a starter for the Cubs (1967), Jenkins recorded twenty wins 
while posting a 2.80 ERA and 236 strikeouts. He finished tied for second 
in the Cy Young Award voting, following Mike McCormick of the San Francisco 
Giants. He was also selected for the All-Star Game for the first time that 
season. The following year his numbers improved; once again he won twenty 
games, his ERA dropped to 2.63 and his strikeout total increased to 260. 
Jenkins established a reputation for achieving his pitching feats and his 
statistics while spending most of his career pitching in a "hitter's ballpark"—Wrigley 
Field in Chicago.[5] Furthermore, in 1968, Jenkins lost five of his starts 
in 1–0 ballgames. Jenkins had his best season in 1971. On April 6, 1971, 
Jenkins started the Cubs' opening-day game. The Cubs defeated the St. Louis 
Cardinals 2–1 in 10 innings at Wrigley Field. Jenkins pitched a complete 
game for the Cubs, and Billy Williams hit a home run in the final inning 
for the victory.[6] On September 1, 1971, Jenkins threw another complete 
game against the Montreal Expos and had two home runs. The Cubs won the 
game 5–2.[7] He was named NL Player of the Month (for the only time in 
his career) in July, with a 6-1 record, a 2.14 ERA, and 49 strikeouts. 
That season, Jenkins threw a complete game in 30 of 39 starts and received 
a decision in 37 of them, finishing with a 24–13 record (.649). He walked 
only 37 batters versus 263 strikeouts across 325 innings.[8] He played 
in the All-Star Game and finished seventh in MVP voting. Jenkins also posted 
a .478 slugging percentage, hitting six home runs and driving in twenty 
runs in just 115 at-bats. Jenkins won the 1971 NL Cy Young Award. Jenkins 
was the first Cubs pitcher and the first Canadian to win the Cy Young Award 
(Quebec native Éric Gagné is the only other Canadian to match the feat). 
He received 17 of 24 first-place votes. He was outpitched in several statistical 
categories by New York Mets pitcher Tom Seaver, but Jenkins pitched in 
hitter-friendly Wrigley Field and Seaver worked in pitcher-friendly Shea 
Stadium. In 1972, Jenkins completed his sixth consecutive season with 20 
or more wins.[9] By the middle of the following season, Jenkins expressed 
that he did not feel like playing baseball anymore. Jenkins finished the 
season, but registered a 14–16 win-loss record. After that season, Jenkins 
was traded to the Texas Rangers. Texas manager Billy Martin was pleased 
with the trade, describing Jenkins as a workhorse and a winner.[10] In 
1974, Jenkins achieved a personal best 25 wins during the season, setting 
a Rangers franchise record which still stands. He finished second in Cy 
Young Award voting for the second time in his career behind Catfish Hunter 
in a very close vote (90 points to Jenkins's 75); surprisingly, Jenkins 
actually finished ahead of Hunter in MVP voting (118 points to Hunter's 
107), and his fifth-place finish on the MVP leader-board was the highest 
of his career. He was named AL Comeback Player of the Year. Jenkins achieved 
his 250th win against the Oakland Athletics on May 23, 1980. Later that 
year, during a customs search in Toronto, Jenkins was found possessing 
3.0 grams cocaine, 2.2 grams hashish, and 1.75 grams marijuana. In response, 
on September 8, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended him indefinitely. However, 
Jenkins' suspension lasted only two weeks before, in an unprecedented action, 
an independent arbiter, Raymond Goetz, overturned the suspension and reinstated 
him and he returned to the league. Eventually, when he went to trial, the 
judge gave him an absolute discharge for lack of some evidence. [11] Jenkins 
was not further punished by MLB for the incident, as he remained active 
until his retirement following the 1983 season. It has been suggested that 
this incident delayed his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[12] 
Jenkins continued playing professional baseball in Canada after retiring 
from MLB in 1983 and pitched two seasons for the London Majors, a minor 
league team of the Intercounty Major Baseball League, operating in London, 
Ontario. Jenkins ran for the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1985 Ontario 
general election, in the riding of Windsor—Riverside, but placed third 
behind the NDP's Dave Cooke.[13] Jenkins led the league in wins twice, 
(1971, 1974) fewest walks per 9 innings five times, complete games nine 
times, and home runs allowed seven times. He led the league in strikeouts 
once (1969, with 273). His streak of six straight seasons with 20 or more 
wins (1967–1972) is the longest streak in the major leagues since Warren 
Spahn performed the feat between 1956 and 1961. Jenkins, fellow Cub Greg 
Maddux, Curt Schilling, and Pedro Martínez are the only major league pitchers 
to ever record more than 3,000 strikeouts with fewer than 1,000 walks.[14] 
Only Robin Roberts and Jamie Moyer allowed more home runs over a career. 
Jenkins achieved his 3000th strikeout on May 25, 1982 against Garry Templeton. 
He is considered the anchor of the 12 Black Aces, a group of pitchers with 
at least twenty wins in one season. In 1974 Jenkins, then with the Texas 
Rangers, became the first baseball player to win the Lou Marsh Trophy, 
an award given annually to Canada's top athlete. He was also named the 
Canadian Press male athlete of the year four times (1967, 1968, 1971, and 
1974). Jenkins was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 
1987, and in 1991, became the first Canadian ever elected to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.[15] The 1991 Major League Baseball 
All-Star Game, held in Toronto, was dedicated to Jenkins; he threw out 
the ceremonial first pitch to conclude the pregame ceremonies. Jenkins 
was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995,[16] and was 
inducted onto Canada's Walk of Fame in 2001. He was appointed the commissioner 
of the now-defunct Canadian Baseball League in 2003; the league's Jenkins 
Cup went missing when the league folded and has been missing ever since.[17] 
He was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2011, the 
Ontario Sports Hall of Fame created the Ferguson Jenkins Heritage Award 
in his honour to commemorate those one-of-a-kind events or special moments 
in time that so embellish the long history of sports in Ontario.[18] On 
December 17, 1979, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for being 
"Canada's best-known major-league baseball player".[19] Governor General 
Michaëlle Jean officiated at his investiture into the Order, which finally 
occurred on May 4, 2007: over 27 years after he was appointed.[20] On May 
3, 2009, the Cubs retired jersey number 31 in honor of both Jenkins and 
Greg Maddux.[21] On December 13, 2010, Canada Post announced that Jenkins 
would be honoured in Canada with his own postage stamp. The stamp would
