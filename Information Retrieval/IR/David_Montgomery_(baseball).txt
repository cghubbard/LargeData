David Montgomery (born June 26, 1946) is the chairman, minority-owner,[1] 
and former[2] President of the Philadelphia Phillies.[3] As a child, Montgomery 
attended Phillies games at Connie Mack Stadium. Before attending college, 
Montgomery worked as a paper delivery boy and a high school baseball coach.[4] 
Montgomery is a 1964 alumnus of the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia[5] 
and as an undergraduate attended the University of Pennsylvania where he 
was first a liberal arts major,[4] and then a history major.[6] Montgomery 
was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while an undergraduate. Montgomery 
continued to attend Phillies games as a college student with future governor 
Ed Rendell, where he recalled "[trying] to eat all the food that $5 could 
buy... as they shared their thoughts with the players".[6] He also attended 
the Wharton Business School as a graduate student, graduating in 1970.[7] 
During his tenure at Wharton, he also coached the linemen for the varsity 
football team at Germantown Academy.[6] After interviewing for positions 
with the Scott Paper Company and Quaker Oats and being encouraged by Rendell 
to apply for a job with the Philadelphia 76ers, Montgomery reached out 
to former Phillies ace Robin Roberts, whose son he coached at Germantown, 
about a job with the baseball club.[6] Montgomery was hired as a member 
of the Phillies' sales department in 1971,[7] becoming director of sales 
and marketing in the mid-1970s and the head of the business department 
by 1980.[6] During the early 1970s, he was also the team's scoreboard operator.[6] 
Montgomery, along with co-owner Bill Giles, purchased the team in 1981 
for $30,000,000 ($78,000,000 today);[8] Giles, the primary owner, named 
Montgomery the executive vice president of the team.[6] In 1997, when Giles 
left the team presidency to become the chairman and focus on winning a 
new stadium for the team,[9] he recommended Montgomery to replace him as 
team president.[6] In so doing, Montgomery became the first native of Philadelphia 
to run the club in over 60 years.[10] One of his focuses with the team 
has been brand development, evidenced by the team's commitment to signing 
successful players to long-term contracts prior to the opening of Citizens 
Bank Park in 2004.[6][7] In August 2014, Montgomery took a leave of absence 
from the Phillies, while undergoing treatment for jaw bone cancer. When 
he returned to the team in January 2015, he assumed the title of chairman, 
while Giles became chairman emeritus. Pat Gillick, who served as interim 
president during Montgomery's leave, assumed the role permanently.[11] 
Montgomery has been a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, served 
community action groups, and been a member of Major League Baseball Enterprise's
