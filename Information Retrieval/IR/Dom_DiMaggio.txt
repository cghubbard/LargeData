Dominic Paul "Dom" DiMaggio (February 12, 1917 – May 8, 2009), nicknamed 
"The Little Professor", was an American Major League Baseball center fielder. 
He played his entire 11-year baseball career for the Boston Red Sox (1940–1953). 
He was the youngest of three brothers who each became major league center 
fielders, the others being Joe and Vince. An effective leadoff hitter, 
he batted .300 four times and led the American League in runs twice and 
in triples and stolen bases once each. He also led AL center fielders in 
assists three times and in putouts and double plays twice each; he tied 
a league record by recording 400 putouts four times, and his 1948 totals 
of 503 putouts and 526 total chances stood as AL records for nearly thirty 
years. His 1338 games in center field ranked eighth in AL history when 
he retired. His 34-game hitting streak in 1949 remains a Boston club record. 
He was the youngest of three brothers who each became major league center 
fielders: Joe was a star with the rival New York Yankees, and Vince played 
for five National League teams. The youngest of nine children born to Sicilian 
immigrants, Dom's small stature (5'9") and eyeglasses earned him the nickname 
"The Little Professor."[1] After breaking into the minor leagues in 1937 
with the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League, Dom DiMaggio's 
contract was purchased by the Red Sox following a 1939 season in which 
he batted .361; he hit .301 in his 1940 rookie season, becoming part of 
a .300-hitting outfield with Ted Williams and Doc Cramer. In both 1941 
and 1942 he scored over 100 runs to finish third in the AL, and was among 
the league's top ten players in doubles and steals; he was named an All-Star 
both years. After missing three years serving in the Navy in World War 
II, he returned in 1946 with his best season yet, batting .316 to place 
fifth in the league, and coming in ninth in the MVP voting as Boston won 
its first pennant in 28 years. Batting third, he hit only .259 in the 1946 
World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, but was almost a Series hero 
for Boston. With two out in the eighth inning of Game 7, he doubled to 
drive in two runs, tying the score 3-3; but he pulled his hamstring coming 
into second base, and had to be removed for a pinch runner. The result 
was costly, as Harry Walker doubled to center field in the bottom of the 
inning, with Enos Slaughter scoring from first base in his famed "Mad Dash" 
to win the game and Series for St. Louis; had DiMaggio remained in the 
game, Walker's hit might have been catchable, or the outfielder's strong 
arm might have held Slaughter to third base. "If they hadn’t taken DiMaggio 
out of the game", Slaughter later said of his daring sprint, "I wouldn’t 
have tried it." After an offensively disappointing year in 1947, DiMaggio 
rebounded in 1948 to score 127 runs (second in the AL) with career highs 
in doubles (40), runs batted in (87) and walks (101). His 503 putouts broke 
Baby Doll Jacobson's AL record of 484, set with the 1924 St. Louis Browns; 
his 526 total chances surpassed the league mark of 498 shared by Sam Rice 
of the 1920 Washington Senators and Jacobson. At the time, the marks ranked 
behind only Taylor Douthit's totals of 547 and 566 with the 1928 Cardinals 
in major league history; both records stood until 1977, when Chet Lemon 
of the Chicago White Sox recorded 512 putouts and 536 total chances. In 
1949 DiMaggio batted .307 with 126 runs, and had his team-record 34-game 
hitting streak; ironically, the streak was ended on August 9 by an outstanding 
catch made by his brother Joe. That year he made 400 putouts for the fourth 
time, tying the AL record held by Sam West of the Senators and Browns; 
the mark was later tied by two other players before being broken by Lemon 
in 1985. In 1950 DiMaggio led the AL in runs (131), triples (11) and stolen 
bases (15) while hitting a career-high .328. On June 30 he and Joe hit 
home runs while playing against one another, becoming the fourth pair of 
brothers to homer in the same game. Dom's stolen base total of 15 is the 
lowest stolen base total to lead either of the Major Leagues in a single 
season.[2] In August of that year, he had 53 base hits, tying a club record 
with teammate Johnny Pesky. He again led the league in runs (113) in 1951, 
when he had a 27-game hitting streak from May 12 to June 7. He retired 
in May 1953, after appearing in only three games that year as a pinch hitter, 
with a .298 batting average, 1680 hits, 308 doubles, 87 home runs, 1046 
runs and 618 RBI in 1399 games. He was selected an All-Star seven times 
(1941–42, 1946, 1949–52). His career average of 2.98 chances per game remains 
the record for AL outfielders. DiMaggio enjoyed a close friendship with 
teammates Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Johnny Pesky, which was chronicled 
in David Halberstam's book The Teammates. After retiring, he became a plastics 
manufacturer in New England. He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall 
of Fame in 1995. He and his wife Emily, whom he married in 1948, had two 
sons (Paul and Peter), a daughter (Emily), and several grandchildren (Alex, 
Andrew, Charlotte, Margel, Peter, and Anna).[3] In an article in 1976 in 
Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star 
Argument Starter", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Dom DiMaggio 
was the left fielder on Stein's Italian team. In 1978 he was named a member 
of the Board of Trustees at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire.[4] 
He served under Presidents Father Peter and Father Jonathan DeFelice and 
helped lead Saint Anselm College through four decades of expansion; he 
was awarded an honorary degree in 1999. Writer David Halberstam described 
Dom as "probably the most underrated player of his day."[5] DiMaggio died 
on May 8, 2009 at his home in Marion, Massachusetts.[6] He was 92 years
