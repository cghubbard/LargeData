The 1926 St. Louis Cardinals season was the team's 45th season in St. Louis, 
Missouri and their 35th in the National League. The Cardinals went 89–65 
during the season and finished first in the National League, winning their 
first National League pennant. In the World Series, they defeated the New 
York Yankees in 7 games, ending it by throwing out Babe Ruth at second 
base in the ninth-inning of Game 7 to preserve a 3–2 victory. This was 
Rogers Hornsby's only full season as manager for the team. Catcher Bob 
O'Farrell won the MVP Award this year, batting .293, with 7 home runs and 
68 RBIs. Led by RBI champion Jim Bottomley, the offense scored the most 
runs in the NL. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders Other batters
