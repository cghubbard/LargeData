The National Colored Base Ball League or the League of Colored Baseball 
Clubs was the first attempt to have a league consisting of all-black teams, 
predating Rube Foster's Negro National League by over three decades. The 
league president was Walter S. Brown, who was also manager of the Pittsburgh 
club. The Gorhams beat the Keystones 11-8 in the opener on May 6, 1887. 
Philadelphia and New York disbanded on May 18. Cincinnati and Washington 
were admitted on May 6, after the season started, but played no games.
