The Jacksonville Red Caps were a Negro league baseball team based primarily 
in Jacksonville, Florida. They played the Negro American League from 1938 
until 1942. The team was based in Jacksonville, Florida playing at Durkee 
Field in 1938. They moved to Cleveland in 1939 and became the Cleveland 
Bears, playing their home games at Hardware Field. They returned to Jacksonville 
as the Red Caps in 1941 for two seasons, dropping out of the NAL in July 
1942.[1] After the war, the Red Caps apparently continued as an unaffiliated 
Negro league team playing at Durkee Field.[2] The Red Caps only played 
seven league games their first season, finishing 3-4.[3] After transferring 
to Cleveland in 1939, the Bears had the best overall record in the NAL 
but were not awarded the pennant, finishing with a 22-4 record in league 
play. The Kansas City Monarchs finished with more victories, going 25-13, 
and, as per the tradition of the time, were thereby declared league champions.[3] 
The Bears fell hard in 1940, finishing last in the league with a 6-16 record.[3] 
Returning to Jacksonville, the Red Caps finished second from last with 
an 8-10 record in league play.[3] They fared no better in 1942 season, 
going 2-6 before dropping from the league in July.[3] On June 28, 2008, 
in Pittsburgh, the Tampa Bay Rays and Pittsburgh Pirates honored the Negro 
Leagues by wearing uniforms of the Jacksonville Red Caps and the Pittsburgh 
Crawfords, respectively, in an interleague game. The Pirates won the game,
