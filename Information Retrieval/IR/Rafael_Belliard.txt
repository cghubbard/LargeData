As player As coach Rafael Leonidas Belliard Matias (born October 24, 1961 
in Pueblo Nuevo, Dominican Republic) is a retired Major League Baseball 
shortstop who played in the Major Leagues from 1982 to 1998 with the Pittsburgh 
Pirates and Atlanta Braves. He was a member of Atlanta's 1995 World Series 
winning team against the Cleveland Indians. He served as the infield and 
first base coach for the Detroit Tigers from 2006–2013. Belliard signed 
with the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent in 1980 and made his 
Major League debut as a pinch runner against the New York Mets on September 
6, 1982.[1] It was not until 1986 that Belliard became a regular in the 
Pirates' lineup, batting .233 in 117 games. He remained a versatile yet 
seldom used player until 1990, when he left Pittsburgh and signed a free 
agent contract with the Atlanta Braves. Belliard arrived in Atlanta just 
as the team was emerging as a National League powerhouse. The team made 
World Series appearances in 1991 and 1992 before finally winning the championship 
in 1995. Though he had appeared in only 75 games that season, Belliard 
played shortstop in all six of Atlanta's World Series games. Belliard made 
his final Major League appearance on April 9, 1998, in a 4–3 Braves win 
over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He concluded his playing career with the Albany-Colonie 
Diamond Dogs of the independent Northern League in 1999. He was named the 
infield coach for the Detroit Tigers on October 11, 2005. Prior to that, 
he served five seasons in the Atlanta Braves minor league system as a roving 
fielding instructor. Belliard, his wife Leonora, and son Kevin reside in 
Boca Raton, Florida.[2] His cousin, Ronnie Belliard, was also a Major League
