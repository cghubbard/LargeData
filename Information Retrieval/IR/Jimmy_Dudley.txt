James Randolph "Jimmy" Dudley (September 27, 1909 – February 12, 1999) 
was an American sportscaster, best known as the play-by-play voice of Major 
League Baseball's Cleveland Indians for nearly two decades. A native of 
Alexandria, Virginia, Dudley majored in chemistry at the University of 
Virginia. He turned to broadcasting in the late 1930s, starting out at 
a Charlottesville radio station. He moved up to calling Chicago Cubs and 
Chicago White Sox games from 1938–1941 before serving as a pilot in the 
U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Dudley was the Indians' lead 
announcer from 1948 until his firing by the club in January 1968. In 1969, 
Dudley broadcast for the expansion Seattle Pilots; when the club moved 
to Milwaukee and became the Brewers the following year, he did not join 
them. Dudley broadcast for a number of minor league teams in the 1970s 
before retiring. As an announcer, Dudley was known for his friendly, homespun 
style and his signature catchphrases: "Hello, baseball fans everywhere" 
(to start a broadcast), "The string is out" (describing a full count on 
a hitter), "A swing and a miss!-he struck him out", "That ball is going...going...gone!" 
(to describe a home run) and "So long and lots of good luck, you hear?" 
(signing off at the game's end). Dudley called the 1954 World Series and 
All-Star Game for the Mutual network, and 1961's first All-Star Game for 
NBC Radio. In addition to baseball, Dudley also broadcast football at various 
times for the Ohio State University, the University of Washington, and 
the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions and Baltimore Colts. Dudley was 
presented with the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame in
