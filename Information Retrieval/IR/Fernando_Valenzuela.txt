Fernando Valenzuela Anguamea (Spanish pronunciation: [ferˈnando βalenˈswela]; 
born November 1, 1960), is a Mexican former Major League Baseball (MLB) 
pitcher who played seventeen seasons, from 1980 to 1997, for six teams, 
primarily the Los Angeles Dodgers. He batted and threw left-handed. He 
has a career won-loss record of 173–153 and a 3.54 earned run average (ERA). 
Valenzuela was notable for his unorthodox windup and for being one of a 
small number of pitchers who threw a screwball regularly. Never a particularly 
hard thrower, the Dodgers felt he needed another pitch; he was taught the 
screwball in 1979 by teammate Bobby Castillo[1] Valenzuela was signed by 
the Dodgers on July 6, 1979 and debuted late in the 1980 season. In 1981, 
in what came to be called “Fernandomania”, Valenzuela rose from relative 
obscurity to achieve superstardom. He won his first eight starts (five 
of them shutouts). Valenzuela finished with a record of 13-7 and had a 
2.48 ERA; the season was shortened by a player’s strike. He became the 
first, and to date, the only player to win both Cy Young and rookie of 
the year awards in the same season.[2] Fernando Valenzuela’s best statistical 
seasons were 1981 through the 1986 seasons. He was named a National League 
(NL) All-Star in each season and won a major league-leading 21 games in 
1986, losing a second Cy Young Award to Mike Scott of the Houston Astros.[3] 
Valenzuela was also known as one of the better hitting pitchers of his 
era. He had ten career home runs and was occasionally used by Los Angeles 
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda as a pinch-hitter[4] For the remainder of 
his Dodgers career, however, Valenzuela was less effective due largely 
to shoulder problems.[5] He was on the Dodgers’ 1988 World Series championship 
team, but he did not play in the postseason due to his ailing shoulder. 
On June 29, 1990, Valenzuela pitched his only major league no-hitter in 
a 6-0 win against the visiting St. Louis Cardinals. The no-hitter was notable 
for being the second one pitched that day.[6] Earlier, right-hander Dave 
Stewart of the Oakland Athletics no-hit the Toronto Blue Jays in Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada in a 5-0 win. It is the only instance in Major League Baseball 
history of two no-hitters being pitched on the same day. However, after 
the season, Valenzuela was released by the Dodgers. The remainder of his 
career was spent with the former California Angels, the Baltimore Orioles, 
the Philadelphia Phillies, the San Diego Padres, and the St. Louis Cardinals. 
Fernando Valenzuela retired after the 1997 season. In 2003, he returned 
to the Dodgers as a broadcaster. In 2015, he became a naturalized American 
citizen[7] Fernando Valenzuela, the youngest of twelve children, was born 
in Etchohuaquila, a small town within the municipality of Navojoa, in the 
state of Sonora, Mexico.[8] His birth date is officially listed as November 
1, 1960, but during his phenomenal rookie season in 1981 several commentators 
questioned his age, guessing him to be significantly older than twenty.[8] 
In 1977, Valenzuela began his professional baseball career when he signed 
as a professional player with the Mayos de Navojoa, next year he was sent 
to the Guanajuato Tuzos of the Mexican Central League, posting a 5–6 record 
with a 2.23 ERA. The following year, the Mexican Central League was absorbed 
into the expanded Liga Mexicana de Beisbol (Mexican Baseball League), automatically 
elevating then 18-year-old Valenzuela to the Triple-A level. Pitching for 
the Leones de Yucatán (Yucatán Lions) that year, Valenzuela went 10–12 
with a 2.49 ERA and 141 strikeouts.[9] A number of MLB teams scouted Valenzuela 
during this time. Los Angeles Dodgers scout Mike Brito had gone to a game 
in Mexico to evaluate a shortstop named Ali Uscanga. Valenzuela was pitching 
against Uscanga when he threw three balls and then three strikes to retire 
the batter. Brito said that he "forgot all about the shortstop".[10] The 
Dodgers finally gambled on the young lefty, buying out his Liga contract 
on July 6, 1979, for $120,000.[8] After acquiring Valenzuela in the summer 
of 1979, the Dodgers assigned him to the Lodi Dodgers of the High-A level 
California League, where he posted a 1–2 record and a 1.13 earned run average 
(ERA) in limited action.[11] The Dodgers felt that Valenzuela needed to 
learn to throw an off-speed pitch, so they had Dodgers pitcher Bobby Castillo 
teach him to throw the screwball before the 1980 season.[12] In 1980 Valenzuela 
was promoted to the Double-A level San Antonio Dodgers. There Valenzuela 
led the Texas League with 162 strikeouts, and he earned a 13-9 win-loss 
record and a 3.10 ERA.[13] Valenzuela was called up to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers bullpen in September 1980. In the last month of the season, Valenzuela 
helped the Dodgers to a Western Division tie with the Houston Astros, pitching 
17 2⁄3 shutout innings of relief over the course of ten games, during which 
he earned two wins and a save. Dodgers then lost a one-game playoff – and 
thus the division championship – to the Astros. Valenzuela in 1981 was 
named the opening day starter as a rookie after Jerry Reuss was injured 
24 hours before his scheduled start and Burt Hooton was not ready to fill 
in. Valenzuela shut out the Houston Astros 2–0.[14] He started the season 
8–0 with five shutouts and an ERA of 0.50. Punctuating this dominance on 
the mound, Valenzuela had an unusual, flamboyant wind-up (looking skyward 
just at the apex of every pitch), which drew attention of its own.[15] 
It was a habit which he claims to have developed spontaneously, although 
not until joining the Dodgers.[16] An instant media icon, Valenzuela drew 
large crowds from the Los Angeles Latino community every time he pitched 
and triggering high demand across the country for his rookie baseball cards. 
The craze surrounding Valenzuela came to be known as "Fernandomania."[17] 
During his warmup routine at Dodger Stadium, the PA system would play ABBA's 
1976 hit song Fernando. He became the first player to win the Rookie of 
the Year Award and the Cy Young Award in the same season. He was also the 
first rookie to lead the National League in strikeouts. The Dodgers won 
the World Series that season.[14] Valenzuela was less dominant after the 
1981 player strike wiped out the middle third of the season, but the left-hander 
still finished with a 13–7 record and a 2.48 ERA. He led all pitchers in 
complete games (11), shutouts (8), innings pitched (192.1) and strikeouts 
(180). In the post-season, Valenzuela became the youngest pitcher to start 
the first game of a series and pitched a complete Game 3 of the 1981 World 
Series against the New York Yankees.[18] In total, he went 3–1 in the post-season 
as he helped the Dodgers to their first World Championship since 1965. 
In addition to his skills on the mound, Valenzuela also displayed much 
better offensive skills than most pitchers. During his rookie season, Valenzuela 
batted .250 and struck out just nine times in 64 at bats, and was the recipient 
of the National League's Silver Slugger Award for pitchers. Following the 
outstanding debut, Valenzuela, nicknamed "El Toro" (the Bull) by fans, 
settled down into a number of years as a workhorse starter and one of the 
league's best pitchers. He had one of his best seasons in 1986, when he 
finished 21–11 with a 3.14 ERA and led the league in wins, complete games 
and innings pitched. He lost a narrow vote for the Cy Young Award to the 
Astros' Mike Scott.[19] At the 1986 All-Star Game, Valenzuela made history 
by striking out five consecutive American League batters, tying a record 
set by fellow left-handed screwballer Carl Hubbell in the 1934 contest.[20] 
In 1987 his performance declined; he earned a 14–14 win-loss record with 
a 3.98 ERA. In 1988, a year in which the Dodgers won the World Series, 
he won just five games and missed much of the season. He improved slightly 
in 1989 and went 10–13, and went 13–13 in 1990. He had one last great moment 
on June 29, 1990, when he threw a 6–0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals 
just hours after the Oakland Athletics' Dave Stewart had thrown one against 
the Toronto Blue Jays. According to teammate Mike Scioscia, Fernando and 
many Dodger players watched Stewart, who was a former Dodger, throw the 
no-hitter on TV. Afterward, before his game, Fernando said to his teammates, 
"You just saw a no-hitter on TV, now you will see one in person." Early 
in his major league career, Valenzuela had trouble communicating with his 
catchers because he spoke very little English. Mike Scioscia, after being 
called up as a rookie, made the effort to learn Spanish and eventually 
became Valenzuela's "personal catcher" with the Dodgers before becoming 
the full-time catcher. After pitching ineffectively in spring training 
in 1991, Valenzuela was released by the Dodgers. At the time of Valenzuela's 
release, several Dodgers leaders, including Tommy Lasorda, Fred Claire 
and Peter O'Malley, praised Valenzuela for creating exciting memories over 
several seasons and they indicated that it was a difficult decision to 
release him.[21] An abortive attempt at a comeback with the California 
Angels failed later that summer. He signed with the Detroit Tigers in the 
spring of 1992, but he never played for the team, and his contract was 
purchased by Jalisco of the Mexican League that summer. He pitched and 
played some first base when he wasn't on the mound, before making another 
brief comeback in 1993 with the Baltimore Orioles. Jumping between the 
big leagues and Mexico for the next few seasons, he put together one more 
solid big-league season in 1996 for the San Diego Padres, going 13–8 with 
a 3.62 ERA. He retired a year later with a final record of 173–153 and 
a 3.54 ERA as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals. The Los Angeles Dodgers 
invited him to spring training in 1999, but he declined the offer.[22] 
On June 29, 2004, Valenzuela announced he would return to the mound in 
the Liga Mexicana del Pacífico (the Mexican Pacific Coast League) to play 
for Los Aguilas de Mexicali in October at which time he was nearly 44 years 
old. He pitched again that Mexican winter league, during the 2005–06 season. 
On December 20, 2006 in Mexicali, BC, Mexico, Fernando Valenzuela was the 
starting pitcher for Los Aguilas de Mexicali in the last professional game 
of his career. Valenzuela was considered an atypically good hitter for 
a pitcher. His best year at the plate was 1990, his last year with the 
Dodgers, when he hit .304 with five doubles, one home run, and 11 RBI in 
69 at-bats. That gave him a 101 OPS+, meaning Valenzuela ranked just above 
average among all National League hitters that year. In 936 career at-bats 
— roughly two full seasons worth of at-bats for a full-time position player 
— his career batting average was .200, with 10 homers, 26 doubles, and 
84 RBI. Valenzuela was even used on occasion as a pinch-hitter, batting 
.368 (7-for-19) in such situations. Twice while with the Dodgers, Valenzuela 
was called upon to play outfield and first base in marathon extra-inning 
games in which he did not pitch. He won the Silver Slugger award for pitchers 
in 1981 and 1983.[17] In 2003, Valenzuela returned to the Dodgers organization 
as the Spanish-language radio color commentator for National League West 
games, joining Jaime Jarrín and Pepe Ýñiguez in the Spanish-language booth. 
In 2015 he was switched to the color commentator job on the Spanish-language 
feed of SportsNet LA.[23] Valenzuela also served on the coaching staff 
of Team Mexico during the 2006 World Baseball Classic, 2009 World Baseball 
Classic and 2013 World Baseball Classic. Valenzuela was inducted into the 
Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on August 23, 2003, in a 
pregame on the field ceremony at Dodger Stadium.[citation needed] In 2005, 
he was named one of three starting pitchers on MLB's Latino Legends Team.[24] 
In 2013, he was enshrined into the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame.[10] 
Dodgers clubhouse manager Mitch Poole has unofficially kept Valenzuela's 
jersey number 34 out of circulation out of respect for him.[25] On October 
26, 2010, ESPN broadcast a documentary commemorating Valenzuela's arrival 
with the Dodgers titled Fernando Nation as part of their 30 for 30 documentary 
series.[26] In 1981, Valenzuela married Linda Burgos, a schoolteacher from 
Mexico. Early in his career, Valenzuela and his family spent offseasons 
between the Mexican cities of Etchohuaquila and Mérida.[27] The couple 
has four children.[28] One of Valenzuela's sons, Fernando, Jr., played 
in the San Diego Padres and Chicago White Sox organizations as a first 
baseman. Since 2006, he has played minor league baseball in Mexico or in 
independent leagues.[29] Valenzuela became a U.S. Citizen on July 22, 2015 
at a ceremony in Downtown Los Angeles. Participated in two Tournament of 
Roses Parades, in 1983 aboard the float from the Government of Mexico and 
in 2008 aboard the Los Angeles Dodgers' float. In 1981, Valenzuela participated
