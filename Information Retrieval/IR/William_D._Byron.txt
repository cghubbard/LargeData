William Devereux Byron, II (May 15, 1895 â€“ February 27, 1941), a Democrat, 
was a U.S. Congressman who represented the 6th congressional district of 
Maryland from January 3, 1939 to February 27, 1941. After his death in 
an airplane crash in Georgia on February 27, 1941, his widow, Katharine 
Byron, a granddaughter of U.S. Senator Louis E. McComas, was elected in 
a special election to complete his term of office. Born in Danville, Virginia, 
he moved with his parents to Williamsport, Maryland in 1900 where he attended 
the public schools, Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire and 
Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York. The Byron family were communicants 
at Saint John's Church. Following his service in the aviation corps during 
World War I, where he was commissioned a first lieutenant he entered the 
family leather manufacturing business in 1919. He served in the Maryland 
Senate from 1930 to 1934 and as mayor of Williamsport from 1926 to 1930 
as had his grandfather, for whom he was named. In 1940 Byron was challenged 
by baseball legend, Hall of Famer, and Montgomery County Commissioner Walter 
Johnson. Byron would narrowly prevail, by a total of 60,037 (53%) to 52,258 
(47%),[1] thanks in large part to the power of incumbency and FDR's coat 
tails. On February 26, 1941, Congressman Byron boarded Eastern Air Lines 
Flight 21 at Washington. The plane was en route from New York City to Brownsville, 
Texas, with stops at Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia. On its approach 
to Atlanta's Chandler Field, the Douglas DC-3 crashed, killing 9 of the 
16 persons on board, including Byron. Eddie Rickenbacker, flying ace and 
President of Eastern, survived with serious injuries.[2] Byron was interred 
in Riverview Cemetery in Williamsport, Maryland. His son Goodloe Byron 
was also a representative from the Maryland 6th congressional district.
