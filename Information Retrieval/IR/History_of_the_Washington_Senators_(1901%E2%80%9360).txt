The Washington Senators baseball team was one of the American League's 
eight charter franchises. The club was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1901 
as the Washington Senators. In 1905, the team changed its official name 
to the Washington Nationals.[1] The name "Nationals" appeared on the uniforms 
for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the "W" logo for the next 
52 years. However, the names "Senators", "Nationals" and shorter "Nats" 
were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next sixty years; in 
2005, the latter two names were revived for the current National League 
franchise that had previously played in Montreal. For a time, from 1911 
to 1933, the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major 
League Baseball. The team's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members 
Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush and one 
of the greatest players and pitchers of all time, Walter Johnson. But the 
Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility, 
including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s. Joe Judge, Cecil 
Travis, Buddy Myer, Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators 
players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team's lack of 
success.[2][3] When the American League declared itself a major league 
in 1901, the new league moved the previous minor league circuit Western 
League's Kansas City franchise to Washington, a city that had been abandoned 
by the older National League a year earlier. The new Washington club, like 
the old one, was called the "Senators" (the second of three franchises 
to hold the name). The Senators began their history as a consistently losing 
team, at times so inept that San Francisco Chronicle columnist Charley 
Dryden famously joked, "Washington: First in war, first in peace, and last 
in the American League,"[4] a play on the famous line in Henry Lee III's 
eulogy for President George Washington as "First in war, first in peace, 
and first in the hearts of his countrymen". The 1904 Senators lost 113 
games, and the next season the team's owners, trying for a fresh start, 
changed the team's name to the "Nationals" (and occasionally nicknamed 
the "Nats"). However, the "Senators" name remained widely used by fans 
and journalists — in fact, the two names were used interchangeably[5] — 
although "Nats" remained the team's nickname.[6] The Senators name was 
officially restored in 1956.[7] The club continued to lose, despite the 
addition of a talented 19-year-old pitcher named Walter Johnson in 1907. 
Raised in rural Kansas, Johnson was a tall, lanky man with long arms who, 
using a leisurely windup and unusual sidearm delivery, threw the ball faster 
than anyone had ever seen. Johnson's breakout year was 1910, when he struck 
out 313 batters, posted an earned-run average of 1.36 and won 25 games 
for a losing ball club. Over his 21-year Hall of Fame career, Johnson, 
nicknamed the "Big Train", won 417 games and struck out 3,508 batters, 
a major-league record that stood for more than 50 years. In 1911, the Senators' 
wooden ballpark burned to the ground, and they replaced it with a modern 
concrete-and-steel structure on the same location. First called National 
Park, it later was renamed Griffith Stadium, after the man who was named 
Washington manager in 1912 and whose name became almost synonymous with 
the ball club: Clark Griffith. A star pitcher with the National League's 
Chicago Colts in the 1890s, Griffith jumped to the AL in 1901 and became 
a successful manager with the Chicago White Sox and New York Highlanders. 
Walter Johnson blossomed in 1911 with 25 victories, although the Senators 
still finished the season in seventh place.[8] In 1912, the Senators improved 
dramatically, as their pitching staff led the league in team earned run 
average and in strikeouts. Johnson won 33 games while teammate Bob Groom 
added another 24 wins to help the Senators finish the season in second 
place behind the Boston Red Sox.[9] The Senators continued to perform respectably 
in 1913 with Johnson posting a career-high 35 victories, as the team once 
again finished in second place, this time to the Philadelphia Athletics.[10] 
Starting in 1916, the Senators settled back into mediocrity. Griffith, 
frustrated with the owners' penny-pinching, bought a controlling interest 
in the team in 1920 and stepped down as field manager a year later to focus 
on his duties as team president. In 1924, Griffith named 27-year-old second 
baseman Bucky Harris player-manager. Led by the hitting of Goose Goslin 
and Sam Rice, and a solid pitching staff headlined by the 36-year-old Johnson, 
the Senators captured their first American League pennant, two games ahead 
of Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees. The Senators faced John McGraw's 
heavily favored New York Giants in the 1924 World Series.[11] Despite Johnson 
losing both of his starts, the Senators kept pace to tie the Series at 
three games apiece and force Game 7. The Senators trailed the Giants 3-1 
in the eighth inning of Game 7, when Bucky Harris hit a routine ground 
ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman 
Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three.[12] 
In the ninth inning with the game tied, 3–3, Harris brought in an aging 
Johnson to pitch on just one day of rest – he had been the losing pitcher 
in Game 5. Johnson held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. In the 
bottom of the twelfth inning, Muddy Ruel hit a high foul ball near home 
plate.[13] The Giants' catcher, Hank Gowdy, dropped his protective face 
mask to field the ball but, failing to toss the mask aside, stumbled over 
it and dropped the ball, thus giving Ruel another chance to bat.[13] On 
the next pitch, Ruel hit a double and, then proceeded to score the winning 
run when Earl McNeely hit a ground ball that took another bad hop over 
Lindstrom's head.[12][13] It was the only World Series triumph for the 
franchise during their 60-year tenure in Washington. The Senators repeated 
as American League champions in 1925 but lost the World Series to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. After Johnson's retirement in 1927, the Senators endured a few 
losing seasons until returning to contention in 1930, this time with Johnson 
as manager. But after the Senators finished third in 1931 and 1932, behind 
powerful Philadelphia and New York, Griffith fired Johnson, a victim of 
high expectations.[14] For his new manager in 1933, Griffith returned to 
the formula that worked for him in 1924, and 26-year-old shortstop Joe 
Cronin became player-manager. The change worked, as Washington posted a 
99–53 record and swept to the pennant seven games ahead of the Yankees. 
But the Senators lost the World Series to the Giants in five games. The 
Senators sank all the way to seventh in 1934. Attendance plunged as well, 
and after the season Griffith traded Cronin to the Red Sox for journeyman 
shortstop Lyn Lary and $225,000 in cash (even though Cronin was married 
to Griffith's niece, Mildred). Despite the return of Harris as manager 
in 1935–42 and 1950–54, Washington remained mostly a losing ball club for 
the next 25 years, contending for the pennant only in the talent-thin war 
years of 1943 and 1945. In the fall of 1953, the second major baseball 
franchise shift of the mid-20th century took place (after the Boston Braves 
moved to Milwaukee in 1952), with long suffering Baltimore civic and business 
interests purchasing the perennially cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns from 
controversial but enterprising owner Bill Veeck and moving them forty miles 
northeast of Washington to the Chesapeake Bay port city. In the spring 
of 1954, the Browns moved to a newly renovated and modernized Memorial 
Stadium on the site of their former northeastern city collegiate football 
bowl, and replacing the earlier minor league level "Triple A" "Orioles" 
(also sometimes nicknamed the "Birds") of the International League where 
they had been consistent champions since the 1910s. The additional competition 
in the same League for Maryland and Virginia area baseball fans added to 
the complexion around the nation's capital for the rest of the 1950s as 
the new "Baltimore Orioles" swiftly built their team prospects with astute 
trades and farm system output during the rest of the decade, finally becoming 
pennant contenders by 1960. They continued their winning ways as one of 
the most dominant teams in professional baseball for the next two decades 
overpowering even the hapless third Senators franchise in 1961–1971. The 
Senators were also the butt of many nationwide jokes during the 1950s, 
with the debut and running of a Broadway musical play in 1955 in New York 
City called "Damn Yankees" (based on an earlier best-selling novel and 
later movie in 1958), which followed a hapless elderly D.C. fan being given 
a "Faustian" or "devil's bargain," selling his soul to transform the team 
by becoming a young powerful new Senators player (played in the movie version 
by heart-throb leading-man actor Tab Hunter) and lead the lowly team to 
a pennant versus the Yankees. In 1954, Senators scout Ossie Bluege signed 
a 17-year-old Harmon Killebrew. Because of his $30,000 signing bonus, an 
enormous amount for that time, baseball rules required Killebrew to spend 
the rest of 1954 with the Senators as a "bonus baby." Killebrew bounced 
between the Senators and the minor leagues for the next few years. He became 
the Senators' regular third baseman in 1959, leading the League with 42 
home runs and earning a starting spot on the American League All-Star team. 
During the late 1950s, he became the leading player on the Senators, providing 
frequent excitement in old Griffith Stadium's last years. Killebrew went 
on to excite upper Mid-west fans during the 1960s after the team moved. 
Clark Griffith died in 1955, and his nephew and adopted son Calvin took 
over the team presidency. He sold Griffith Stadium to the city of Washington 
and leased it back, leading to speculation that the team was planning to 
move, as the Braves, Browns and Athletics had done in the early 1950s (and 
the Giants and Dodgers did so later in the decade). After an early flirtation 
with San Francisco (with a "Triple A" Pacific Coast League team, the San 
Francisco Seals), by 1957 Griffith was courting Minneapolis–St. Paul in 
the upper Mid-West of Minnesota, a prolonged process that resulted in his 
rejecting the Twin Cities' first offer[15] before agreeing to relocate. 
The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960, in the face 
of the Continental League's proposed Minnesota franchise, a deal was reached: 
The Senators moved and were replaced with an expansion Senators team for 
1961. The old Washington Senators became the new Minnesota Twins. Owner 
Calvin Griffith reportedly told a local Lions Club in Minneapolis-St. Paul 
in 1978 that he'd chosen Minnesota "when we found out that you only had 
15,000 blacks here," as he and his father were well-known racists and segregationists 
then just like long-time Washington Redskins owner George Marshall in the 
National Football League.[16] The longtime competitive struggles of the 
team were fictionalized in the book "The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant", 
which became the legendary Broadway musical and movie "Damn Yankees" (starring 
then "heart-throb" leading-man actor Tab Hunter). The plot centers around 
Joe Boyd, a middle-aged real estate salesman and long-suffering fan of 
the Washington Senators baseball club. In this musical comedy-drama of 
the Faust legend, Boyd sells his soul to the Devil and becomes slugger 
Joe Hardy, the "long ball hitter the Senators need that he'd sell his soul 
for" (as spoken by him in a throwaway line near the beginning of the drama). 
His hitting prowess enables the Senators to win the American League pennant 
over the then-dominant Yankees. One of the songs from the musical, "You 
Gotta Have Heart", is frequently played at baseball games. The Washington 
Senators were mentioned several times in Tom Clancy's book "Without Remorse."
