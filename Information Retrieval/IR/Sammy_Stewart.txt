Samuel Lee "Sammy" Stewart (born October 28, 1954) is a former professional 
baseball player. He pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1978 to 
1987. Stewart had the best earned run average (ERA) in the American League 
(AL) in 1981 and he pitched in the postseason in 1979 and 1983. Stewart 
struggled with drug addiction after he retired from baseball; his addiction 
culminated in a prison term that ran from 2006 to 2013. Stewart was born 
in Asheville, North Carolina. He attended Owen High School in Swannanoa, 
North Carolina, and Montreat College, and signed his first pro contract 
with the Baltimore Orioles in 1975. Stewart established a new record for 
most consecutive strikeouts in an MLB debut with seven in the Orioles' 
9–3 victory over the Chicago White Sox in the second game of a twi-night 
doubleheader at Memorial Stadium on September 1, 1978.[1] His performance 
surpassed the milestone established by Karl Spooner in 1954.[2] Stewart 
appeared in one game of the 1979 World Series. In 2 2⁄3 innings, he gave 
up four hits but did not surrender a run. In 1981, Stewart led the American 
League in ERA (2.32).[3] In the 1983 American League Championship Series 
and the 1983 World Series, he pitched a combined 9 1⁄3 innings over five 
games, did not give up any runs, struck out eight batters. He earned an 
ALCS save on October 7.[3] He had been placed on 18 months probation the 
day before, stemming from a July arrest for driving while intoxicated. 
His attorney announced that Stewart was undergoing treatment for alcohol 
problems.[4] Stewart was traded to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Jackie 
Gutiérrez after the 1985 season. In February 1986, newspapers reported 
that the Orioles wanted to nullify the trade because of the emotional state 
of Gutierrez. Stewart said that he had already settled in Boston and that 
he would fight any attempts to return him to Baltimore.[5] Years after 
his retirement, Stewart blamed Boston's 1986 World Series loss on the team's 
manager, John McNamara. He said that he had not been on good terms with 
McNamara since he narrowly missed a team bus after visiting his son in 
the hospital. A confrontation ensued between Stewart and the team's traveling 
secretary. Stewart said that McNamara held a grudge from the incident which 
led to Stewart not appearing in the World Series.[6] He pitched in 359 
major league games, finishing with a 59–48 record, 45 saves, and a 3.59 
earned run average (ERA).[3] The year after he retired from baseball, Stewart 
became addicted to crack cocaine. He said that the drug helped him not 
to feel the absence of baseball in his life. Several attempts at rehabilitation 
were unsuccessful and Stewart slept under bridges in the Asheville area 
for a while.[6] Between 1989 and 2006, Stewart was arrested 26 times and 
spent several stints in prison.[6] Following a string of domestic disturbances 
with his wife Peggy, he was charged with kidnapping in 1989 after Peggy 
said that he beat her and held her against her will overnight.[7] Stewart 
separated from Peggy in 1994.[8] In October 2006, he was sentenced to 80 
to 105 months in the Buncombe Correctional Center on drug possession charges 
after accepting a plea bargain as a habitual felon.[2] He was released 
in January 2013. After his release from prison, Stewart moved to Hendersonville, 
North Carolina, to live with his girlfriend Cherie. He began teaching pitching 
lessons to local youth baseball players.[8] Stewart had a son and a daughter 
with Peggy; both children were affected by cystic fibrosis. His son died 
in 1991 at age 11, while his daughter received a double lung transplant.[7]
