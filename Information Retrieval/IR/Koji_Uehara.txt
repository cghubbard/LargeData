NPB MLB World Baseball Classic Koji Uehara (上原 浩治, Uehara Kōji?, born April 
3, 1975) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. 
He has played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) with the Yomiuri Giants 
and in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Texas Rangers 
and Boston Red Sox. A right-handed pitcher, Uehara has a solid career strikeout 
rate, with 10.6 K/9 and an excellent walk rate at 1.2 BB/9 (until 2014 
season). Through the 2014 season, his career 8.96 K/BB is the best in MLB 
history for a player with at least 100 innings pitched.[1] Uehara won the 
2013 ALCS MVP Award, and closed the final game of the 2013 World Series. 
With his World Series win, Uehara became one of four players in history 
to have won both a World Series and a World Baseball Classic. Uehara graduated 
from the Osaka University of Health and Sport Sciences, and was drafted 
with the first pick by the Yomiuri Giants in 1998. He had a successful 
rookie year in 1999, with 15 consecutive wins that broke the all-time rookie 
record, claimed the Rookie of the Year, Eiji Sawamura Award, and led in 
wins, ERA, strikeouts and winning percentage. In 2001 he finished with 
a 4.02 ERA, the highest of his career. However, in 2002 he rebounded leading 
the Central League in wins and collected his second Sawamura Award. He 
was injured before the 2007 season which made him a late appearance, and 
in that season, he became a closer instead, recorded an 1.74 ERA with 4 
wins, 3 losses and 32 saves. Though showing a good ability both starting 
and closing, he returned as a starting pitcher in the 2008 season. He left 
the Giants after that season becoming a free agent and allowing him to 
play in Major League Baseball. Uehara is renowned for his performance in 
international competition. He participated in international events since 
he was in University, he also participated in Olympic Games twice, as well 
as the first World Baseball Classic, and participated in Asian Baseball 
Championships. He has 12 wins and 2 saves, without a loss in his 25 appearances 
from the above events. He was a member of the Japanese national baseball 
team which competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. The team eventually 
won the bronze medal. In 2006 he joined Team Japan for the World Baseball 
Classic and earned 2 wins, improving his unbeaten record in international 
competition (including amateur appearances) to 12 wins in 21 appearances. 
In the World Baseball Classic, Japan beat Cuba to win the championship; 
Uehara led the tournament with 16 strikeouts. He was a closer in 2007 Asian 
Baseball Championships, played in two games and earned his first international 
save against Korea. Uehara moved to another team in April 2008. He remained 
in the 39-out-of-77 men candidate list towards the Beijing Olympics in 
late June, and was selected to the final 24-men list in mid-July. He was 
expected to be a setup pitcher before the Olympic Games, but he appeared 
as a closer in his first appearance against Chinese Taipei, pitching a 
shutout inning without yielding a hit, as his team won 6–1. He earned his 
first Olympic save against Canada, holding a 1–0 victory two days later. 
Japan finished fourth in the Games. Uehara chose not to participate in 
the World Baseball Classic in 2009. In 1998, Uehara rejected a contract 
worth $3 million from the then-Anaheim Angels and signed with Yomiuri. 
The Angels had expressed their continued interest in Uehara, as scouting 
director Eddie Bane had stated that acquiring either Uehara or Daisuke 
Matsuzaka was a top priority for the team. However, many other teams, including 
the Yankees, Dodgers, Red Sox, Mets, and Orioles had shown interest in 
bidding for Uehara if and when he were to become available. Uehara asserted 
his preference in public to be transferred to a Major League Baseball team 
through the posting system. His efforts had been rebuffed by the Yomiuri 
Giants front office. He was expected to be eligible for free agency in 
2007 (but that was postponed to 2008 due to injury). He became eligible 
for free agency in April 2008.[2] In 2002, he represented Japan in the 
Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series and on November 11 became the 
first pitcher in over a year to strike out Barry Bonds three consecutive 
times in one game. This achievement raised his profile in American Major 
League Baseball. He is also a friend of Roger Clemens after Clemens visited 
Japan in 2004 as a member of the MLB All-Star team. MLB.com showed a video 
in which Clemens gave Uehara his game-used black glove with autograph.[3] 
On January 13, 2009, Uehara signed a two-year deal with the Baltimore Orioles. 
He started the 2009 season as the number two starter behind Jeremy Guthrie.[4] 
Uehara made his big league debut on April 8 against the New York Yankees. 
Uehara earned the win, going five innings and allowing one run. His second 
outing resulted in a win against the Texas Rangers. On September 10, 2009, 
it was announced that Uehara would be out for the remainder of the season. 
He started the 2010 season as a setup reliever in the bullpen. He finished 
the season 1-2 with a 2.86 ERA, 55 strikeouts in 44 innings, and 13 saves. 
In the first half of the 2011 season, he was 1-1 with a 1.72 ERA with 62 
strikeouts in 47 innings pitched. On July 30, 2011, Uehara was traded to 
the Texas Rangers for Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter. The move re-united 
him with his old high school team-mate Yoshinori Tateyama.[5] In 2011, 
he was 2–3, with a 2.35 ERA, between the two teams.[6] In 2012, Uehara's 
option vested and remained with the Rangers. He would have a successful 
campaign with a 1.75 ERA but was limited to 37 games with 36 innings pitched 
and recorded 43 strikeouts after spending some time on the disabled list 
due to a strained lateral muscle. On December 6, 2012, Uehara agreed to 
a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox.[7] Uehara transitioned his 
role from setup man to closer after season-ending injuries to Andrew Bailey 
and Joel Hanrahan.[8] Uehara's 2013 season was one of the most dominant 
by any relief pitcher in baseball history. His 2013 WHIP of 0.57 in 74.1 
innings set the record for a pitcher with 50 or more innings pitched. Between 
July 9 and September 17, Uehara retired 37 consecutive batters, exceeding 
the previous franchise record of 32, and nearing Bobby Jenks' MLB record 
of 41 for consecutive outs by a reliever.[9][10] Uehara finished the regular 
season with a 1.09 ERA, a 2.08 xFIP, and struck out 38.1% of batters he 
faced. He was ranked by Fangraphs as the number one reliever of 2013 in 
Wins Above Replacement.[11] Uehara pitched in five games of the 2013 ALCS, 
and was named ALCS Most Valuable Player.[12] In the series he pitched 5.1 
innings, allowing 4 hits and no walks; and collected 9 strikeouts. He recorded 
a save in Game 6 to win the Red Sox their 13th AL pennant. In Game 4 of 
the World Series, Uehara picked off St. Louis Cardinals pinch runner Kolten 
Wong for the last out of a 4–2 Red Sox win. In Game 5, he recorded his 
seventh save of the postseason, tying the record for most saves in a single 
postseason. (The next year Greg Holland matched his record for saves in 
the playoffs, tying John Wetteland, Robb Nen, Troy Percival, and Brad Lidge).[13] 
Uehara threw the final pitch of the 2013 World Series, closing out a 6–1 
win in Game 6. On July 9, 2014, Uehara was named to his first career All 
Star Game, replacing injured New York Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka. 
He struggled near the end of the 2014 regular season and was removed from 
the closer role on September 5.[14] He signed a two-year extension with 
the Red Sox on October 30, 2014.[15] Uehara returned to the closer position 
in the 2015 season, but on August 7, he suffered a season-ending injury 
when a batted ball struck his right wrist.[16] He ended his 2016 season
