Neil Martin Andrew Walker (born September 10, 1985) is an American professional 
baseball second baseman for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball 
(MLB). He was drafted by his hometown Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round 
of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft, and made his MLB debut with them 
in 2009. He played with the Pirates through 2015 and played in 2016 with 
the Mets. Walker, the son of former major league pitcher Tom Walker (1972–77),[1] 
was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he grew up outside of Pittsburgh 
in the nearby North Hills suburbs and attended Pine-Richland High School. 
He graduated in 2004. He played catcher on the baseball team and a wide 
receiver for the football team. Walker, who also played on the Rams' basketball 
team until his senior year, was a two-time Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Male 
Athlete of the Year.[2] His baseball jersey, #24, was retired from Pine-Richland 
during a pre-game ceremony before the Pittsburgh Pirates' July 22, 2010 
game.[3] Neil grew up as a fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and attended 
many of the team's games while sitting in the "Peanut Heaven"[clarification 
needed] section of Three Rivers Stadium. In 1994, he attended the All-Star 
Game, where he obtained the signatures of Ken Griffey, Jr. and Frank Thomas. 
To this day, those signed baseballs are among his most prized baseball 
possessions. Prior to being drafted by the Pirates, Walker approached the 
University of Pittsburgh and Penn State about doubling in baseball and 
football; however, he passed on those options out of concern that Penn 
State wanted him to add 60 pounds and become a tight end.[citation needed] 
The Pittsburgh Pirates selected Walker in the first round of the 2004 Major 
League Baseball draft. After three minor league seasons,[4] Neil started 
2007 rated No. 74 on Baseball America's list of Top 100 prospects, and 
No. 3 in the Pirates' organization behind Andrew McCutchen and Brad Lincoln.[5][6] 
Walker was invited to the Pirates' 2007 spring training as a non-roster 
invitee, where he was converted from his drafted position of catcher to 
third base. He was sent back to the Pirates Double-A affiliate Altoona 
Curve where he spent the majority of the season. On May 15, 2007, he became 
the first Curve player to have a four-hit game, going 4-for-4 with a home 
run, double and two RBI against the Portland Sea Dogs.[7] Walker hit a 
pair of two-run home runs on May 27, 2007, helping the Curve end a 10-game 
losing streak against the Bowie Baysox.[8] He hit a grand slam and drove 
in five runs on June 28, 2007 in the second game of a double-header against 
the Trenton Thunder.[9] Walker was promoted to the Triple-A Indianapolis 
Indians for the 2008 season, where he played 133 games, compiling a .242 
average with 16 home runs, 80 RBI and 10 stolen bases.[10] Walker spent 
the majority of the season again with the Pirates Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis 
Indians. In 95 games, he hit .264 with 69 RBI and 5 stolen bases. He received 
his first Major League call-up on September 1, 2009 and served as a pinch-hitter 
for Pirates starter Charlie Morton that night against the Cincinnati Reds. 
His first career hit came five days later against Jason Motte of the St. 
Louis Cardinals, a single to right field. He never became an every day 
regular player and finished the season hitting .194 in 17 games. Walker 
spent most of spring training with the Pirates in Bradenton, Florida before 
being reassigned back to the Indians. He hit .321 with six home runs, 26 
RBI and 10 stolen bases in 43 games with Indianapolis and on May 25, 2010, 
he was called back up to the Pirates when first baseman Steve Pearce was 
placed on the disabled list with a sprained ankle.[11] He made his first 
Major League start of the year that night against the Cincinnati Reds, 
playing at third base. He hit an RBI double in the 8th inning off Reds 
starter Mike Leake. But his role on the team was initially in question, 
as Andy LaRoche had been the Pirates every day third baseman. With high-priced 
trade acquisition Akinori Iwamura struggling, Pirates manager John Russell 
decided to give Walker a try at second base – a position where he had only 
played 23 career games at any level.[12] But the position change stuck 
and Walker quickly established himself as the new second baseman. He hit 
his first Major League home run on June 1, 2010 off Chicago Cubs starter 
Ted Lilly, a two-run shot that propelled the Pirates to a 3–2 victory. 
"This goes back to being 5 or 6 years old at Three Rivers Stadium, sitting 
in peanut heaven", Walker said after the game. "Getting drafted by the 
Pirates, this is just a Cinderella story. It's incredible."[13] Walker 
missed hitting for the cycle by only a triple on June 25, 2010 against 
the Oakland Athletics. He doubled and scored a run in the first inning, 
singled in the third and then hit his 3rd home run off Athletics starter 
Ben Sheets. However, he was forced to leave the game after being nearly 
knocked unconscious by teammate Ryan Church's knee when the two accidentally 
collided going for a fly ball.[14] He then missed the following seven games 
with concussion-like symptoms before returning to action on July 3. Walker 
scored a career-high three times in a 12–6 win over the Houston Astros 
on July 17, 2010. He hit 3rd in the Pirates batting order, going 3-for-5 
with 3 runs and 2 RBI. He set another career high three days later, recording 
five hits in one game against the Milwaukee Brewers, finishing the night 
5-for-5 with a run scored and an RBI. Walker became the first Pirate rookie 
since fellow Pittsburgh native John Wehner in 1991 to have a five-hit game.[15] 
His hitting tear was finally ended on July 23, 2010 against the San Diego 
Padres, after recording six straight multi-hit games. He was batting .593 
in that time (16-for-27) with four runs scored and eight RBIs. Walker kicked 
off August with three hits while driving in a career-high four runs in 
a 7–6 win over the Cincinnati Reds on August 3, 2010.[16] Walker played 
a pivotal role in a series win over the St. Louis Cardinals, driving in 
three runs against Cy Young hopeful Adam Wainwright on August 24 and then 
repeating the feat the very next day against Jake Westbrook.[17] Following 
his performances against St. Louis, Walker then went on an 18-game hitting 
streak, from August 23 through September 12. The streak was the longest 
by any Pirate hitter in 2010 and the longest by any Pirate rookie since 
Rennie Stennett also recorded an 18-game streak in 1971.[18] Walker finished 
the 2010 season batting .296 with 12 home runs and 66 RBIs. His 54 RBIs 
after the All-Star Break tied with Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols for 
the 3rd best mark in the National League. He was named the second baseman 
on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[19] He was also named the second 
baseman on the 2010 Topps Major League Rookie All-Star Team.[20] After 
playing nearly every position on the diamond from catcher to the outfield, 
Walker finally settled in as a Major League second-baseman. New Pirates 
manager Clint Hurdle was also full of praise for Walker, who reported early 
to training camp with the pitchers and catchers, saying "He was really 
thrown into the fire last season, having to learn the position at the major 
league level, which is challenging and very difficult, but, to his credit, 
he pulled it off."[18] Walker hit his first career Major League grand slam 
on opening day, April 1, 2011 in the 5th inning off Chicago Cubs starter 
Ryan Dempster, joining Roberto Clemente as the only Pirates players to 
hit a grand slam on opening day.[21] On May 20, Walker's bobblehead night 
at PNC Park, he drove in a career-high 5 RBIs against the Detroit Tigers 
in a 10–1 Pirate win.[22] After dealing with various back issues in August 
and September, Walker was shut down for the season on September 29 with 
a herniated disc in his back.[23] Walker was activated from the disabled 
list on May 13 after spending some time with the Altoona Curve.[24] Walker 
was placed on the disabled list June 9 after undergoing an emergency Appendectomy 
thus allowing a roster spot for top prospect Gregory Polanco.[25] On September 
14, Walker hit his 20th home run of the season (a new career high) also 
setting a new record for home runs in a season by Pirates second-basemen, 
a record which was previously held by Bill Mazeroski.[26] On May 9, 2015, 
during a 7–5 win over the Cardinals, the Pirates became the first MLB team 
to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The play occurred when the Cardinals' Yadier 
Molina lined out to Walker. Walker threw to Jung-ho Kang at third base 
to double off Jhonny Peralta for the second out. Kang then threw the ball 
back to Walker, who was standing on second base, for the final out after 
Jason Heyward froze between second and third.[27] On December 9, 2015, 
the Pirates traded Walker to the New York Mets for Jon Niese.[28] On January 
29, 2016, Walker signed a one-year, $10.55 million deal avoiding arbitration.[29] 
On April 23, 2016, Walker hit his 100th career home run in a game against 
the Atlanta Braves.[30] On April 27, Walker hit his 9th home run of April, 
tying a Mets franchise monthly record.[31] On September 9, Walker underwent 
a lumbar microdiscectomy at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, ending 
his season. Despite appearing in only 113 games, Walker tied a career high 
with 23 home runs and finished with a .282 batting average.[32] After the 
season, Walker became a free agent for the first time of his career. On 
November 14, 2016, Walker signed a qualifying offer from the Mets for one-year 
worth $17.2 million.[33] Aside from his father, many other baseball players 
are related to Neil. His uncle, Chip Lang is a former Montreal Expos pitcher. 
Walker is also the brother-in-law of Don Kelly, a utility player for the 
Miami Marlins, who is married to his sister Carrie, a former professional 
basketball player. Neil's brother, Matt, played outfield for George Washington 
University and in the minor leagues in the Detroit Tigers and Baltimore 
Orioles systems. His other brother, Sean, pitched for George Mason University.[34] 
Walker attended high school with his future wife, Niki, who was one year 
ahead of him. They did not date, however, until a few years after Walker 
began his professional baseball career.[35] They were married on December 
3, 2011 in Wexford, Pennsylvania.[36] The couple's first child, a daughter 
named Nora, was born on August 23, 2016.[37] Walker was one of only two 
Major League players during the 2010 season to still live with his parents. 
The other was pitcher Tyson Ross. "He's really not thrilled about that. 
We try to give him his space," said his mother Carolyn, although Walker 
himself said he loves life at home.[38] However, Walker announced at Pirate 
Camp prior to the 2011 season that his mom finally kicked him out of their 
North Hills area home.[18] Walker idolized Bill Mazeroski as a youth and 
received instruction from the great Pirates second-baseman during spring 
training, which provided invaluable help when Walker was called upon to 
play the position after Akinori Iwamura's struggle.[39][40] He was also 
a fan of Pirates' outfielder Andy Van Slyke, whom he watched play at Three 
Rivers Stadium.[34] Walker is a Roman Catholic.[41] He led the effort to 
provide weekly Mass to fellow Catholics on the Pirates as well as Catholics 
from the visiting team. Walker states that Mass services are an important 
part of his life because they "combat the negative qualities" found in 
living the lifestyle of a Major League Baseball player.[41] He also was 
a guest on Blessed2Play, a national radio show hosted by Ron Meyer where 
Neil discussed his faith and career.[42] Walker's father, a former teammate 
of Roberto Clemente, reflected about his son's career when discussing Clemente's 
death in 1972. Before taking off on the flight that he would die on, Clemente 
insisted that Walker's father not join him on his humanitarian mission. 
Walker's father said Clemente saved his life and allowed him to have his
