Shane Patrick Victorino (born November 30, 1980), nicknamed "The Flyin' 
Hawaiian", is an American professional baseball outfielder who is a free 
agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, 
Philadelphia Phillies, Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, and Los Angeles 
Angels of Anaheim. He was primarily a switch-hitter until the 2013 season, 
when discomfort from various hamstring, back and knee problems forced him 
to become an exclusively right-handed batter. Victorino played right field 
for the Red Sox, but has more often played center field during his career. 
Victorino made his MLB debut with the Padres in 2003. He played for the 
Phillies from 2005 through 2012. With the Phillies, Victorino won three 
Gold Glove Awards, was named to two MLB All-Star Games, and was a member 
of the 2008 World Series champions. With the Red Sox, Victorino won a Gold 
Glove Award and was a member of the 2013 World Series champions. He also 
won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 2008 and the Branch Rickey Award in 
2011. On July 27, 2015 Victorino was traded from the Red Sox to the Angels.[1] 
Victorino is a former Hawaii state high school track and field champ (Spring, 
1999) for St. Anthony High School in the 100m, 200m, and 400m dashes. His 
100m time (10.80) was a state meet record until it was broken in 2015 by 
Baldwin's Bailey Kaopuiki (10.74). He has been consistently clocked at 
3.7–3.8 sec. from home to first right-handed. He also has a strong arm, 
with 69 career outfield assists through 2013.[2] Victorino was drafted 
by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the sixth round of the 1999 MLB draft out 
of St. Anthony High School in Wailuku, Hawaii.[3][4] He spent the 1999 
through 2002 seasons in the Dodgers minor league system, reaching Double-A 
with the Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League in 2002. Victorino was 
selected in the 2002 Rule 5 draft by the San Diego Padres and made his 
Major League debut for the Padres on April 2, 2003 as a late inning defensive 
replacement against the San Francisco Giants. He recorded his first at-bat 
the following day against the Dodgers, grounding out to third base. He 
did not record his first hit until April 20, when he singled to right field 
off of Shawn Chacón of the Colorado Rockies. He played in 36 games for 
the Padres with a .151 batting average. On May 28 he was returned by the 
Padres to the Dodgers. After playing two more seasons in the Dodgers farm 
system, with Jacksonville and the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple-A Pacific 
Coast League. Victorino was again selected in the Rule 5 draft, on December 
13, 2004, by the Philadelphia Phillies. He again failed to stay with the 
major league club, and was offered back to the Dodgers. The Dodgers declined, 
so the Phillies retained his contract and assigned him to their Triple-A 
minor league club, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the International 
League.[5] He hit .310 in 126 games with the Red Barons, with 18 home runs 
and 70 RBI, earning International League All-Star and Most Valuable Player 
honors. Additionally, he was selected as a Baseball America second team 
Minor League All-Star, a Triple-A All-Star and Phillies Minor League Player 
of the Year. Victorino received a September call-up to the Phillies and 
hit his first home run on September 22 off Tim Hudson of the Atlanta Braves. 
Victorino became a starting player when he replaced Bobby Abreu midway 
through the 2006 season,[6] in right field. Victorino replaced Aaron Rowand, 
who left by free agency, in center field in 2008. He was a right fielder 
in 2007[7] On June 3, 2007 the Phillies celebrated "Shane Victorino Day" 
with Victorino hula figurines, and flew his father in from Maui for the 
game. Victorino ended the day's game with a walk-off home run in the bottom 
of the ninth against the Giants.[3] In the 2008 NLDS Game 2 against the 
Milwaukee Brewers, Victorino hit a grand slam (his first ever in the major 
leagues, and the Phillies first post-season grand slam) off of CC Sabathia 
in the bottom of the 2nd inning. Victorino also became the first player 
in post-season history to have a home run, a double, and two steals in 
a single game.[8] In 2008, Victorino received the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award.[9][10] 
Victorino's success carried over into the 2008 NLCS, as he continued to 
make crucial hits and defensive plays for the Phillies. In Game 2 he was 
2 for 5 with 4 RBIs. After the game, Victorino was informed that his grandmother 
had died. Game 3 saw Victorino in the midst of controversy. After being 
brushed back by Hiroki Kuroda, Victorino began to gesture towards the non-English-speaking 
pitcher that it was alright that he throw inside, just as long as he did 
not do so at his head. After grounding out to second, he continued to gesture 
at Kuroda and benches from both teams cleared. Victorino quickly became 
the villain for Dodger fans and was booed each time he came up to bat. 
After the game, Victorino was fined $2,500 by the league for his part in 
the incident.[11] Victorino was quick to silence the crowd during Game 
4 when he hit a game-tying two run home run. In their first trip to the 
fall classic since 1993, the Phillies went on to win the 2008 World Series 
by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays. On July 9, 2009 Victorino won the All-Star 
Game Final Vote with a record breaking 15.6 million votes, and was named 
the 33rd member of the National League's 2009 All-Star team.[12] He was 
the first Hawaiian-born positional player to be named to an All-Star team. 
On August 12, in a game against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, Victorino 
was hit with a full cup of beer while making a catch. A complaint was filed 
with the Chicago police by Victorino and the Cubs,[13] and the fan was 
charged with two misdemeanor counts.[14] For the 2009 season, Victorino's 
13 triples led the majors,[15] and he won his second consecutive Rawlings 
Gold Glove Award in the outfield. After the season, the Phillies and Victorino 
agreed to a three-year contract extension, avoiding salary arbitration 
and buying out his first year of free agency.[16] In the first inning of 
the clinching Game 3 of the 2010 NL division series against Cincinnati, 
Victorino made a superb running-and-reaching catch of a line drive in the 
alley. Without that catch, the game would have been tied, 1–1, with the 
hitter now on second and a possible big inning for the Reds. Instead, the 
catch preserved a 1–0 lead.[17] However, in the NLCS, Victorino posted 
a mere .208 batting average with just two RBIs and six strikeouts against 
the eventual World Series Champion San Francisco Giants. In 2010, he received 
the Tug McGraw "Good Guy Award" from the Philadelphia chapter of the Baseball 
Writers' Association of America.[18] In September 2011, Victorino was named 
the winner of the Branch Rickey Award by the Rotary Club of Denver.[19] 
In 2012 with the Phillies, Victorino played in 101 games and hit .261 with 
9 homers, 40 RBI and 24 steals. Victorino was traded back to the Dodgers 
on July 31, 2012 for Josh Lindblom, Ethan Martin and a player to be named 
later, who later turned out to be grandson of Dodgers Hall of Fame Spanish 
announcer Stefan Jarrín.[20][21] Victorino played in 53 games with the 
Dodgers, primarily in left field and hit .245 with 2 homers, 15 RBI and 
15 steals. On December 13, 2012, Victorino signed a 3-year, $39 million 
contract with the Boston Red Sox.[22] On May 12, 2013, Victorino collided 
with the right field wall and was injured. However, he stayed in the game 
for 2 more innings. He was placed on the disabled list on May 24 (retroactive 
to May 21) with a hamstring strain, and re-activated on June 8. Victorino 
was named AL Player of the Week for July 28 – August 3. On October 19, 
2013, Victorino hit a go-ahead grand slam in the bottom of the seventh 
inning, over the Green Monster, in game 6 of the ALCS. The grand slam put 
the Red Sox up 5–2 over the Detroit Tigers, and sent the Red Sox to the 
World Series. With this, Shane joined Jim Thome as the only other player 
to have hit two post-season grand slams. Victorino received the American 
League Gold Glove Award for his outstanding play in right field. He compiled 
a 25.0 UZR (Ultimate Zone Rating) and had 264 putouts along with 9 assists. 
On Wednesday, October 30, Victorino won his 2nd World Series ring after 
the Red Sox' victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.[23] On April 30, 2014, 
Victorino and teammate Will Middlebrooks returned from injury to Fenway 
Park, in a game where the Red Sox won 7-4 against Tampa Bay Rays.[24] Victorino 
only played in 30 games in 2014, spending much of the 2014 season on the 
disabled list and had season ending back surgery on August 5. He batted 
exclusively right-handed in those 30 games. On April 25, 2015, Victorino 
was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a hamstring strain.[25] On 
July 27, 2015, Victorino was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, 
along with $3.8 million in cash considerations, for infielder Josh Rutledge.[26] 
His combined record with the Red Sox and Angels in 2015 was 71 games played, 
batting .230, with 7 RBIs and 1 home run. He filed for free agency on November 
2, 2015.[27] Victorino signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs 
in February 2016. He was released on March 29, but re-signed with the team 
on a minor league deal the same day.[28] He was released for a second time 
on May 23.[29] Victorino is the son of a Maui County councilman and is 
an Eagle Scout.[30][31] His father is a Past State Deputy of Hawaii and 
the current Supreme Warden for the Knights of Columbus, and Shane is a 
member.[32] Victorino is married to the former Melissa Smith. Victorino

they live together in Las Vegas.[33] Victorino is of Portuguese, Hawaiian, 
Japanese, Okinawan, and Chinese descent. His last name is of Portuguese 
origin. In an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2011, he explained: 
"My name is really Victorine, which is Portuguese. My great-, great-grandpa, 
when he was in the war, they spelled his name with an O at the end instead 
of an E, and it became Victorino."[18] He is a Sansei or third-generation 
Japanese American on his mother's side.[34] His cousin, Kanekoa Texeira, 
pitched for the Seattle Mariners and Kansas City Royals.[35] Shane is a 
fan of Bob Marley and uses his song "Three Little Birds" as a walk up song 
for his at bats. It had become tradition for Red Sox fans to sing along.[36]
