Special Operations Training Division Despite its relatively small size, 
Bristol, Virginia, boasts one of the more advanced broadband networks in 
the country.[14] Bristol Virginia Utilities (BVU) started planning a fiber 
optic deployment in the city in the late 1990s. By 2001, BVU had been granted 
approval by the city council for a full deployment of a Fiber to the premises 
(FTTP or FTTU, fiber to the user) project. This project was to offer competition 
to local incumbents and provide broadband Internet, cable TV, and telephone 
service to the residents of Bristol. This deployment was one of the first 
of its kind in the United States and was widely watched by the telecommunications 
industry. A system known as Passive optical network (PON) was successfully 
deployed to over 6,000 customers in a matter of two years. In 2003, in 
the relatively isolated city of Bristol, Virginia, Bristol Virginia Utilities 
(BVU), created a nonprofit offshoot called "Optinet", a municipal broadband 
Internet service that covers Bristol as well as the Southwest portion of 
the state of Virginia. Serving around 12,500 customers,[15] BVU is recognized 
as the "first municipal utility in the United States to deploy an all-fiber 
network offering the triple play of video, voice and data services".[15] 
On October 29, 2009, BVU received USD 3.5 million in grant funding from 
the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission.[16] 
With these funds BVU will build "an additional 49 miles of its OptiNet 
fiber-optic backbone from Abingdon up I-81 to Virginia Route 16 from Marion 
into Grayson County".[16] This will also allow for BVU to make a second 
connection with Mid Atlantic Broadband, increasing communication between 
different businesses in Northern Virginia. The Virginia Tobacco Community 
funded this project because it provided their business with more connections 
in crucial areas of the southwest and southern part of Virginia. The U.S. 
Department of Commerce also funded BVU. On July 3, 2010, it was reported 
that they gave USD 22.7 million in stimulus funds to Southwest Virginia 
to create a "388-mile optic backbone through an eight-county region". This 
project will service over 120 institutions, such as schools, hospitals, 
government buildings, and many more besides.[17] This new municipals broadband 
service will also be within a two-mile distance of over 500 different businesses.[17] 
This project also created 295 new jobs.[17] BVU Optinet continues operate 
a strong municipal broadband Internet service for Bristol and many other 
counties in Virginia. Today, Bristol Virginia is still one of only a few 
FTTP deployments in the country with a significant number of customers 
online. Bristol's twin city in Tennessee is deploying an FTTP system similar 
to its neighbor across the state line. According to Bristol's 2011 Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report,[18] the top employers in the city are: In 2007 
and 2008, Bristol was named one of the Best 100 Communities for Music Education[19][20][21]

Music", according to a resolution passed by the US Congress in 1998;[22] 
residents of the city had contributed to early country music recordings 
and influence, and the Birthplace of Country Music Museum is located in 
Bristol. In 1927 record producer Ralph Peer of Victor Records began recording 
local musicians in Bristol to attempt to capture the local sound of traditional 
"folk" music of the region. One of these local sounds was created by the 
Carter Family. The Carter Family got their start on July 31, 1927, when 
A.P. Carter and his family journeyed from Maces Spring, Virginia, to Bristol, 
Tennessee, to audition for Peer who was seeking new talent for the relatively 
embryonic recording industry. They received $50 for each song they recorded. 
Since 1994, the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance has promoted the city 
as a destination to learn about the history of the region and its role 
in the creation of an entire music genre. The Alliance is organizing the 
building of a new Cultural Heritage Center to help educate the public about 
the history of country music in the region.[23] Bristol hosts the Bristol 
Pirates baseball team of the Appalachian League. Former NASCAR driver Kelly 
Denton is from the city. On the Tennessee side, Bristol is home to Bristol 
Motor Speedway, the "world's fastest half mile", which hosts two races 
per year on the NASCAR Sprint Cup circuit, two races per year on the NASCAR 
Xfinity Series circuit, one race per year on the Camping World Truck Series 
circuit, and various other racing events. The complex includes the Bristol 
Dragway, nicknamed "Thunder Valley", referencing the hills that echo the 
engine noise back toward the crowd. Television: Newspaper: Radio: Coordinates:
