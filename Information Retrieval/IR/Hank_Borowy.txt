Henry Ludwig "Hank" Borowy (May 12, 1916 – August 23, 2004) was a starting 
pitcher in Major League Baseball. From 1942 through 1951, Borowy played 
for the New York Yankees (1942–45), Chicago Cubs (1945–48), Philadelphia 
Phillies (1949–50), Pittsburgh Pirates (1950) and Detroit Tigers (1950–51). 
He batted and threw right-handed. Born in Bloomfield, New Jersey, Borowy 
graduated from Bloomfield High School and Fordham University. He pitched 
in six World Series games and posted a 108–82 record with 690 strikeouts 
and a 3.50 earned run average (ERA) in 1,717 innings pitched. Borowy debuted 
on April 18, 1942 with the Yankees, finishing with a 15–4 record, 85 strikeouts 
and a 2.82 ERA. He started Game 4 of the World Series against the St. Louis 
Cardinals and did not receive a decision. In 1943, Borowy went 14–9 with 
107 strikeouts and a 2.82 ERA and won Game 3 of the World Series against 
St. Louis. Named an All-Star in 1944, he pitched three scoreless innings 
in the game, ending the season with a 17–12 record, 107 strikeouts and 
a 2.64 ERA. In 1945 Borowy posted a 10–5 record with the Yankees in the 
first half of the season. The 1945 All Star game was cancelled due to wartime 
travel restrictions, but Borowy was selected a "virtual" All Star in an 
unofficial poll of managers conducted by the Associated Press.[1] At the 
All-Star break he was placed on waivers by the Yankees, and eventually 
sold to the Cubs for $100,000. Borowy went 11–2 for the remainder of the 
season, including three wins over the Cardinals down the stretch, and led 
the National League in winning percentage (.846) and ERA (2.14), as the 
Cubs won the pennant. His combined 1945 Yankees/Cubs record was 21–7 with 
82 strikeouts and a 2.65 ERA. Borowy is one of two pitchers in major league 
history to win at least 10 games for two different teams in the same season 
(the other is Bartolo Colón, with the Cleveland Indians and Montreal Expos, 
in 2002). On October 3, 1945, the Detroit Tigers and Cubs met in the World 
Series for the fourth time. In the opener Borowy pitched a six-hit, 9–0 
shutout. He lost the fifth game, and then came back to win the sixth with 
four scoreless relief innings. Borowy started the final game on one day's 
rest but gave up hits to the first three batters before leaving. He took 
the loss and the Tigers won the Series. Before the 2016 World Series, Borowy 
was the last Chicago Cubs pitcher to win a World Series game. He is also 
the fourth and last pitcher to hit two doubles in the same inning, on May 
5, 1946. The previous three pitchers were Fred Goldsmith, Joe Wood, and 
Ted Lyons.[2] For the remainder of his career, Borowy was plagued by finger 
blisters and a chronic sore shoulder. He pitched his final game on September 
14, 1951. Just prior to his retirement, he performed one of the worst pitching 
performances ever seen in Major League baseball. Playing against the St 
Louis Browns on the 18th of August, Borowy was called up to pitch in the 
bottom of the seventh inning, with the game tied at 7-all.[3] Borowy faced 
nine batters, and was unable to achieve an out, giving up four singles, 
four walks and a three-run home run, before being pulled from the game 
by Tigers manager Red Rolfe.[3] No other pitcher has faced nine batters 
in a game and not managed an out.[3] Borowy grew up in Bloomfield, New 
Jersey and was a longtime resident of Brick Township, New Jersey, where
