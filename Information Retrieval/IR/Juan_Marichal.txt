Juan Antonio Marichal Sánchez (born October 20, 1937[1]) is a Dominican 
former professional baseball player. He played as a right-handed pitcher 
in Major League Baseball most notably for the San Francisco Giants.[1] 
Marichal was known for his high leg kick, pinpoint control and intimidation 
tactics, which included aiming pitches directly at the opposing batters' 
helmets.[2] Marichal also played for the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles 
Dodgers for the final two seasons of his career.[1] Although he won more 
games than any other pitcher during the 1960s, he appeared in only one 
World Series game and he was often overshadowed by his contemporaries Sandy 
Koufax and Bob Gibson in post-season awards.[3][4] Marichal was inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983.[5] Juan Marichal was born on October 
20, 1937 in the small farming village of Laguna Verde, Dominican Republic, 
the youngest of Francisco and Natividad Marichal's four children.[6] He 
has two brothers, Gonzalo and Rafael, and a sister named Maria. His father 
died of an unknown illness when Marichal was three years old.[6] His house 
did not have electricity, but food was plentiful since his family owned 
a farm.[7] As a child, Marichal worked on the farm daily, and was responsible 
for taking care of his family's horses, donkeys, and goats.[7] He lived 
near the Yaque del Norte River, and often spent time swimming and fishing.[8] 
One day, while Marichal was playing by the river, he fell unconscious due 
to poor digestion, and was in a coma for nine days.[9] Doctors did not 
expect him to survive, but he slowly regained consciousness after his family 
gave him steam baths by doctors orders.[9] His older brother Gonzalo instilled 
a love of baseball in young Marichal, and taught him the fundamentals of 
pitching, fielding, and batting.[10] Every weekend, Marichal played the 
sport with his brother and friends. For their games, they found golf balls 
and paid the local shoemaker one peso to sew thick cloth around the ball 
to make it the proper size.[11] They employed branches from a wassama tree 
for bats, and canvas tarps for gloves.[11] Among his childhood playmates 
were the Alou brothers, Felipe, Jesús, and Matty, who all later played 
with Marichal on the San Francisco Giants.[11] From the age of six, Marichal 
aspired to become a professional baseball player, but his mother discouraged 
this, instead urging him to get an education.[12] At the time, there were 
no players from the Dominican Republic in Major League Baseball, and his 
goal was viewed to be unrealistic.[12] At age 11, he briefly held a job 
cutting sugar cane for the J.W. Tatem Shipping conglomerate. In 1954, sixteen-year-old 
Marichal joined a summer league in Monte Cristi, playing for a team called 
Las Flores.[10] Although he began at shortstop, Marichal switched to pitcher 
after taking inspiration from Bombo Ramos of the Dominican national team.[10] 
He left high school after being recruited to play for the United Fruit 
Company team in 1956.[13] Marichal's delivery was renowned for one of the 
fullest windups in modern baseball, with a high kick of his left leg that 
went nearly vertical (even more so than Warren Spahn's delivery).[3] Marichal 
maintained this delivery his entire career, and photographs taken near 
his retirement show the vertical kick only diminished. The windup was the 
key to his delivery in that he was consistently able to conceal the type 
of pitch until it was on its way. Marichal was discovered by Ramfis Trujillo, 
the son of late Dominican dictator Rafael Leónidas Trujillo. Ramfis was 
the primary sponsor of the Dominican Air Force Baseball Team (Aviación 
Dominicana), against which Marichal pitched a 2–1 victory game in his native 
Monte Cristi. From the very moment the game ended, Marichal was a member 
of Aviación Dominicana team, enlisted to the Air Force right on the spot 
by Ramfis' orders.[14] Marichal entered the major leagues on July 19, 1960 
with the San Francisco Giants as the second native pitcher to come from 
the Dominican Republic. He made an immediate impression: in his debut, 
on July 19, 1960 against the Philadelphia Phillies, he took a no hitter 
into the eighth inning only to surrender a two-out single to Clay Dalrymple.[15] 
He ended up with a one-hit shutout, walking one and striking out 12.[16] 
He started 10 more games that season, finishing at 6–2 with a 2.66 ERA.[1] 
He improved his victory totals to 13 and 18 over the following two seasons, 
respectively, before finally cracking the 20-victory plateau in 1963, when 
he went 25–8 with 248 strikeouts and a 2.41 ERA.[1] He appeared in every 
All-Star game of the 1960s beginning in 1962. In May 1966, he was named 
NL Player of the Month with a 6-0 record, a 0.97 ERA, and 42 SO. On July 
14, 1967, he surrendered the 500th Home Run of Eddie Mathews' career. Marichal 
enjoyed similar success through the 1969 season, posting more than 20 victories 
in every season except 1967, and never posting an ERA higher than 2.76.[1] 
He led the league in victories in 1963 and 1968 when he won 26 games.[17][18] 
In 1968, he also finished in the highest rank of his career in MVP voting, 
finishing fifth behind Bob Gibson, Pete Rose, Willie McCovey, and Curt 
Flood. He and Sandy Koufax were the only two Major League pitchers in the 
post-war era (1946–present) to have more than one season of 25 or more 
wins; both pitchers had three such seasons in their careers. Marichal won 
more games during the decade of the 1960s (191) than any other major league 
pitcher,[3] but did not receive any votes for the Cy Young Award until 
1970, when baseball writers started voting for the top three pitchers in 
each league rather than one per league (or, until 1967, only the top pitcher 
in MLB). Marichal finished in the top 10 in ERA seven consecutive years, 
starting in 1963 and culminating in 1969, in which year he led the league.[19] 
During his career, he also finished in the top 10 in strikeouts six times, 
top 10 in innings pitched eight times (leading the league twice), and top 
10 in complete games 10 times, with a career total of 244.[20] He led the 
league twice in shutouts, throwing 10 of them in 1965.[19][21] Marichal 
exhibited exceptional control. He had 2,303 strikeouts with only 709 walks,[1] 
a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.25 to 1. This ranks among the top 20 pitchers 
of all time, ahead of such notables as Bob Gibson, Nolan Ryan, Steve Carlton, 
Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Walter Johnson and Roger Clemens, who each 
have strikeout-to-walk ratios of less than 3:1. Over his career, he led 
the league in the fewest walks per nine innings four times, and finished 
second three times – totaling eleven years in which he finished in the 
top 10, all while also finishing in the top 10 for strikeouts six years. 
One regular-season game in Marichal's career deserves mention, involving 
him and Milwaukee Braves' Hall of Famer Warren Spahn in a night contest 
played July 2, 1963, before almost 16,000 at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. 
The two great pitchers matched scoreless innings until Giants outfielder 
Willie Mays homered off Spahn to win the game 1–0 in the 16th inning.[22][23] 
Both Spahn and Marichal tossed 15-plus inning complete games,[23] something 
that almost certainly will never happen again in the big leagues. Marichal 
allowed eight hits (all singles except for a double hit by Spahn) in the 
16 innings, striking out 10, and saddling eventual career home run king 
Hank Aaron with an 0-for-6 collar.[23] Spahn permitted nine hits in 15 
1⁄3 innings, walking just one (Mays intentionally, in the 14th, after Harvey 
Kuenn's leadoff double) and striking out two.[23] The game, almost the 
innings-duration of two contests, lasted only 4 hours, 10 minutes.[23] 
By coincidence, future Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig attended 
the game as a fan.[24] Marichal is also remembered for a notorious incident 
that occurred with John Roseboro during a game between the Giants and Los 
Angeles Dodgers at Candlestick Park on August 22, 1965.[25][26] The Giant-Dodger 
rivalry was, at the time, the fiercest in baseball - a rivalry which began 
when both teams played in the New York City market. [27] As the 1965 season 
neared its climax, the Giants were involved in a tight pennant race, entering 
the game trailing the Dodgers by a game and a half while the Milwaukee 
Braves were one game behind the Dodgers.[27] [28] Maury Wills led off the 
game with a bunt single off Marichal and scored when Ron Fairly hit a double.[29] 
Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on 
base and took umbrage with Wills.[26][28] When Wills came up to bat in 
the second inning, Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills sending him 
sprawling to the ground.[26] Willie Mays then led off the bottom of the 
second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher Sandy Koufax threw a 
pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation.[26][28] In the top 
of the third inning with two outs, Marichal threw a fastball that came 
close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground.[28] Marichal's 
act angered the Dodgers and home plate umpire Shag Crawford warned both 
teams any further retaliations would not be tolerated.[28] Marichal came 
to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to throw at him. Instead, Marichal 
was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch 
either brushed his ear or came close enough for Marichal to feel the breeze 
off the ball.[27] When Marichal confronted Roseboro, Roseboro came out 
of his crouch with his fists clenched.[27] Marichal later said he thought 
Roseboro was about to attack him. Marichal raised his bat, striking Roseboro 
at least twice on the head, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing 
down the catcher's face. Roseboro later required 14 stitches. [27][30] 
Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt separate them and was joined 
by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.[27] A 14-minute brawl 
ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other 
peacemakers restored order.[26] Marichal was ejected from the game and 
afterwards, National League president Warren Giles suspended him for eight 
games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750[25][31] (equivalent 
to $13,160 in 2015),[32] and also forbade him from traveling to Dodger 
Stadium for the final, crucial two-game series of the season.[27] Roseboro 
filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident 
but, eventually settled out of court for $7,500.[27] Many people protested 
the apparently light punishment meted out, since it would cost Marichal 
only two starts.[27] The Giants were in a tight pennant race with the Dodgers 
(as well as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves) and the race was decided with 
only two games to play. The Giants, who ended up winning the August 22 
game and were down only 1⁄2 game afterward, eventually lost the pennant 
to the Dodgers by 2 games. Ironically, the Giants went on a 14-game win 
streak that started during Marichal's absence and by then it was a two-team 
race as the Pirates, Reds, and Braves fell further behind. But then the 
Dodgers won 15 of their final 16 games (after Marichal had returned) to 
win the pennant. Marichal won in his first game back, 2–1 vs. the Astros 
on September 9 (the same day Koufax pitched his perfect game vs. the Cubs), 
but lost his last three decisions as the Giants slumped in the season's 
final week. Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until spring training 
in April 3, 1966. In his first at bat against Marichal since the incident, 
Roseboro hit a three-run home run.[33] San Francisco General Manager Chub 
Feeney approached Dodgers General Manager Buzzy Bavasi to attempt to arrange 
a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro however, Roseboro declined the 
offer.[33] Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal 
having thrown at Wills.[27] He explained that Koufax would not throw at 
batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches.[27] 
He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, "standard 
operating procedure", as a form of retribution.[27] After years of bitterness, 
Roseboro and Marichal became close friends in the 1980s, getting together 
occasionally at Old-Timers games, golf tournaments and charity events.[27] 
In 1970, Marichal experienced a severe reaction to penicillin which led 
to back pain and chronic arthritis. Marichal's career stumbled in 1970, 
when he only posted 12 wins and his ERA shot up to 4.12, before straightening 
itself out with a stellar 1971 season in which he won 18 games and his 
ERA dropped below 3.00.[1] It was the only season in which Marichal earned 
any consideration for the Cy Young Award, finishing in 8th place. It was 
his final great season (and his final of nine All-Star appearances), however, 
as he posted 6–16 and 11–15 records in 1972 and 1973 respectively.[1] After 
the 1973 season, the Giants sold Marichal to the Boston Red Sox.[34] He 
had a fairly solid 1974, going 5–1 in 11 starts, but was released after 
the season.[1] He then signed with the Dodgers as a free agent.[34] Dodger 
fans had never forgiven Marichal for his attack on Roseboro 10 years earlier, 
and it took a personal appeal from Roseboro to calm them down. However, 
Marichal's 1975 didn't last long; he was lit up for nine runs, 11 hits 
and a 13.50 ERA in only two starts before retiring.[35] He finished his 
career with 243 victories, 142 losses, 244 complete games, 2,303 strikeouts 
and a 2.89 ERA over 3,507 innings pitched.[1] He played in the 1962 World 
Series against the New York Yankees (one start, a no decision) and the 
1971 National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates 
(losing his only start).[36] Between 1962 and 1971, the Giants averaged 
90 wins a season, and Marichal averaged 20 wins a year. Marichal pitched 
a no-hitter on June 15, 1963, and was named to nine All-Star teams.[1][37] 
He was selected the Most Valuable Player of the 1965 game in Minneapolis, 
in which he pitched three shutout innings and faced the minimum nine batters, 
giving up one hit. His overall All-Star Game record was 2–0 with a 0.50 
ERA in eight appearances facing 62 batters in 18 total innings, second-most 
in innings pitched only to Don Drysdale (19.1 innings; 2-1, 1.40 ERA and 
69 batters faced).[20] Marichal was passed over for election to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame during his first two years of eligibility, by all accounts 
because the Baseball Writers' Association of America voters still held 
his attack on Roseboro against him. However, after a personal appeal by 
Roseboro, Marichal was elected in 1983, and thanked Roseboro in his induction 
speech.[30][35] When Roseboro died in 2002, Marichal served as an honorary 
pallbearer at his funeral and told the gathered, "Johnny's forgiving me 
was one of the best things that happened in my life. I wish I could have 
had John Roseboro as my catcher."[38] Marichal's uniform number 27 has 
been retired by the Giants.[39] In 1990, Marichal, who was working as a 
broadcaster for Spanish radio, was on hand to see his son-in-law at the 
time, José Rijo, win the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. In 1999, 
he ranked #71 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, 
and was a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[40][41] 
He was honored before a game between the Giants and Oakland Athletics with 
a statue outside AT&T Park in 2005, and was named one of the three starting 
pitchers on Major League Baseball's Latino Legends Team. In 1976, sportswriter 
Harry Stein published an "All Time All-Star Argument Starter", consisting 
of five ethnic baseball teams. Marichal was the right-handed pitcher on 
Stein's Latin team. The Giants also honored him by wearing jerseys that 
said "Gigantes." Marichal was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball 
Museum Hall of Fame on July 20, 2003 in pregame on field ceremony at Pac 
Bell Park.[42] In 2015 the Estadio Quisqueya in his home country was renamed 
Quisqueya stadium Juan Marichal after him.[43][44] In 2008, Marichal was 
filmed at a cockfight in the Dominican Republic along with New York Mets 
pitcher Pedro Martínez. The incident caused controversy in the United States, 
but Martinez defended their attendance at the cockfight by saying "I understand 
that people are upset, but that is part of our Dominican culture and is 
legal in the Dominican Republic". He added "I was invited by my idol, Juan 
Marichal, to attend the event as a spectator, not as a participant."[45] 
The popular media tended to pronounce his surname "MARE-i-shall". West 
coast broadcasters tended to pronounce his name more like proper Spanish
