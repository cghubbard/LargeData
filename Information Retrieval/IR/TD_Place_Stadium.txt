TD Place Stadium (originally Lansdowne Park and formerly Frank Clair Stadium) 
is a 24,000-seat stadium in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located at Lansdowne 
Park, on the southern edge of The Glebe neighbourhood, where Bank Street 
crosses the Rideau Canal. It is the home of the Ottawa Redblacks of the 
Canadian Football League (CFL) and the Ottawa Fury FC of the United Soccer 
League (USL). It was known as Frank Clair Stadium until it was renamed 
on January 7, 2014.[1] It has existed in rudimentary form since the 1870s, 
and as a complete stadium since 1908. The playing field, part of the Ottawa 
Exposition Grounds, was first cleared in the 1870s. It was used for equestrian 
events, lacrosse and rugby football. The first permanent grandstand was 
built on the north side of the playing field in 1908. It was demolished 
in 1967 to build a new set of stands with an integrated ice hockey arena 
underneath, then known as the Ottawa Civic Centre. A small grandstand was 
built in the 1920s on the south-side of the field, and it was replaced 
in 1960. A second deck for the south-side was added during the 1970s. As 
of 2008, prior to lower south-side demolition, the overall stadium had 
a 30,927 capacity for football. In the late 1990s, the stadium was threatened 
with demolition when then-mayor Jim Watson led a drive by the municipal 
government to allow a private developer to reconfigure Lansdowne Park. 
The proposals submitted all called for residences to be built on the site 
of the football stadium. Massive public opposition and the realization 
that the end of the stadium would mean the end of hopes to return CFL football 
to the capital led the regional government to step in and end the scheme. 
For many years, the stadium was known as Lansdowne Park, after the fairgrounds 
in which it was located. It was renamed in 1993 to honour Frank Clair, 
coach and general manager for the Ottawa Rough Riders during the 1960s 
and 1970s. In September 2007, the lower south side stands were closed because 
of cracks in the concrete structure. After the closure of the stands, then-Ottawa 
mayor Larry O'Brien was quoted at the time that this was an opportunity 
to do a review of the usage and the facilities of Lansdowne Park.[2][2] 
Subsequently a process was started called "Design Lansdowne" to get public 
consultations on the Park and the stadium. After an engineering study of 
the north-side and south-side grandstands, the south-side stands were condemned. 
The lower section of the stands was demolished by controlled implosion 
on July 20, 2008 at 8:03 am. During the summer of 2008, a consortium of 
investors was formed to pursue a new CFL team in Ottawa. They bid successfully 
and received a conditional franchise from the CFL, with the condition that 
the stadium would need to be upgraded before the franchise could be activated. 
Jeff Hunt, one of the principal investors and owner of the Ottawa 67's 
who play in the attached arena, stated that the venue and location are 
ideal, with over a million people in Ottawa. The organization had reportedly 
already pre-sold 5,000 season tickets. In the fall of 2008, the consortium, 
known as Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group (OSEG), approached the City 
with a plan to redevelop Lansdowne Park and rebuild the stadium using the 
proceeds from turning a section of the park into commercial and retail 
space. The plan, entitled Lansdowne Live! was ambitious and included plans 
to redevelop all sections of the park. The City, which had received a competing 
stadium proposal for Kanata, reviewed the plans and agreed to a conditional 
agreement with OSEG. OSEG would concentrate on the stadium and commercial/residential 
precinct, and Ottawa would return the rest of Lansdowne Park to green space. 
Faced with opposition to the plan, the City proceeded slowly with the proposal, 
seeking out legal opinions, traffic studies, and an urban park design competition 
for Lansdowne. In June 2010 it was announced that Ottawa City Council had 
approved a redevelopment plan put forward by OSEG to renovate Frank Clair 
Stadium and build 350,000 sq ft (33,000 m2) of commercial retail space, 
250 housing units and an urban park on the site. The stadium, which was 
the catalyst to bring the CFL back to Ottawa is to be rent-free to developers 
for 30 years. Proceeds from the retail and commercial precinct would be 
shared, and the retail and commercial precinct brought under City control 
after 30 years. Completion of the overall development was scheduled for 
2015. The OSEG proposal for the stadium envisioned tearing down all of 
the south-side stands, replacing the stands with a new structure with private 
boxes and a unique wood-wrapping around the exterior. The north-side stands 
were to be renovated to current standards, and the north-side exterior 
expanded to include a retail component. In September 2010, the Ottawa Fury 
joined the plan to redevelop Lansdowne. On June 20, 2011, Ottawa was awarded 
a professional soccer franchise in the North American Soccer League (NASL) 
to start play in 2014.[3] In November 2011, demolition of the rest of the 
south side stands started. The contract to demolish the stands was awarded 
for $550,000. Unlike the lower stands, the upper stands structure was demolished 
piece-by-piece rather than controlled implosion.[4] The concrete and steel 
from the structure was recycled, and the seats re-used at a new rink at 
Ottawa City Hall. Demolition was completed by January 2012.[5] On January 
7, 2014, Frank Clair Stadium and the Civic Centre Arena were renamed TD 
Place under a new sponsorship deal with the Toronto-Dominion Bank.[1][6] 
The stadium was completed for the first Ottawa Redblacks home game on July 
18, 2014. The Ottawa Fury opened their fall season on the same weekend 
after playing their previous home games that year at Keith Harris Stadium 
at Carleton University. The Ottawa Rough Riders football team and its predecessors 
played at the field from their inception in 1876 until 1996, when the team 
ceased operations. A successor team, the Ottawa Renegades, played at the 
stadium from 2002 until 2005. From the 1870s onward, the field was also 
home to University of Ottawa's Gee-Gees football team. Prior to the disbanding 
of the Ravens football program at Carleton University in 1998, the stadium 
was the site of the Panda Game, when these rivals played each other with 
rowdy fans hurling insults across both sides of the stadium. At the Panda 
Game in 1987, the game (forfeited) was marred by an accident when at least 
25 students were injured when a section of railing collapsed. The final 
Panda Game was in 1997, the year following the departure of the Riders 
from Ottawa. 2014 marks the return of the Panda Game to Lansdowne, when 
the Gee-Gees take on the Ravens for the first time at the newly renovated 
stadium. The stadium has also been home to the Ottawa Junior Riders of 
the Quebec Junior Football League and the Ottawa Bootleggers of the Empire 
Football League. The field was also the home of minor-league baseball. 
The stadium was the home venue of the Ottawa Giants and Ottawa Athletics 
minor-league baseball teams. The stadium has played host to five Grey Cup 
games, the first occasion being in 1925 when Ottawa won its first Grey 
Cup title. It later held Grey Cup games in 1939, 1967, and 1988, before 
playing host to the 92nd Grey Cup in 2004, in which the Toronto Argonauts 
defeated the BC Lions to become the Canadian Football League champions. 
During the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the stadium hosted five soccer 
matches.[7][8] In mid-2007, the stadium was one of six hosts in the 2007 
FIFA U-20 World Cup. Capacity was then listed at 28,826. The last major 
concert at the stadium was in 2005, when The Rolling Stones performed in 
front of a crowd of 43,000. During the winter months, a private company 
rented the field and placed an inflated dome over the field area, renting 
the covered and heated surface for use by amateur sports teams.[citation 
needed] The stadium was one of six chosen to host matches for the 2015 
FIFA Women's World Cup; it hosted a total of six group stage matches, two 
Round of 16 matches, and one quarter-final match. Due to FIFA policy forbidding 
commercial sponsorship of stadium names, the stadium was known as Lansdowne 
Stadium[9] during the tournament. On September 3, 2015, AC/DC performed 
to a crowd of 32,000 on the Ottawa stop of the Rock or Bust World Tour—the 
first major concert event at the renovated TD Place Stadium.[10] On July 
31, 2016, the CFL awarded Ottawa the 105th Grey Cup game, to be played 
at TD Place Stadium in 2017, as part of celebrations to mark 150 years 
of Confederation.[11] North stand South stand Field Coordinates: 45°23′53.44″N
