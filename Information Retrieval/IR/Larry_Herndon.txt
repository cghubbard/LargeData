Larry Darnell Herndon (born November 3, 1953) is a former Major League 
Baseball outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals (1974), San Francisco Giants 
(1976–1981), and Detroit Tigers (1982–1988). Currently, Herndon serves 
as a coach for the Lakeland Flying Tigers. He won the 1981 Willie Mac Award 
for his spirit and leadership.[1] Herndon was originally selected by the 
St. Louis Cardinals in the third round of the 1971 Major League Baseball 
Draft. During his first minor league season on the 1971 Gulf Coast League 
Cardinals, his fellow rookie and roommate was Randy Poffo, who would later 
go on to be known as wrestler Randy Savage.[2] By hitting a home run in 
his final at bat on May 17, 1982 and his first three at bats on May 18, 
1982, Herndon shares the major-league record for home runs hit in consecutive 
at bats (four).[citation needed] Herndon was particularly known for his 
time with the Tigers. He hit a two-out, two-run home run in Game 1 of the 
1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres that proved to be the game 
winner, and also caught the final out of the Series—a fly ball to left 
field off the bat of Padres star Tony Gwynn. Three years later, Herndon 
hit a solo home run on the final day of the season against the Toronto 
Blue Jays. It was the only run in a 1–0 Detroit victory over the Blue Jays 
that clinched the American League East division title by two games. Herndon 
retired with the Tigers and served as the team's major league hitting coach.[citation
