William Hambly Stoneman III (born April 7, 1944) is a former professional 
baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who threw two no-hitters during 
his eight-year major league career. He served as the general manager of 
the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim from 1999 to 2007, and continued with 
the Angels as a consultant after stepping down. He was named the interim 
general manager of the Angels on July 1, 2015, following the resignation 
of Jerry Dipoto. A 1962 graduate of West Covina High School in southern 
California, Stoneman spent a year at Mt. SAC in Walnut, then transferred 
north to the University of Idaho in Moscow to play for Wayne Anderson,[1] 
and helped the Vandals win the inaugural Big Sky title in 1964 as a sophomore.[2] 
As a junior, the Vandals were 17–13 and he was 5–3 with a 1.80 ERA and 
averaged 1.5 strikeouts per inning.[3] As a senior in 1966, Stoneman was 
6–2 with a 0.45 ERA in the regular season, and the Vandals won the Big 
Sky again with a 31–7 (.816) record in the regular season. Invited to the 
NCAA playoffs for the first time, Idaho eliminated Colorado State and Air 
Force on the road in Greeley, Colorado.[4] The Vandals were one step from 
the College World Series in Omaha, but lost to Arizona in Tucson in the 
District 7 finals, today's "Super-Regionals" (Sweet 16).[5][6] Idaho ended 
up their best-ever season at 34–9 (.791).[7] Stoneman received his bachelor's 
degree from the University of Idaho in 1966, and a master's degree from 
the University of Oklahoma.[8] While at Idaho, he was an active member 
of Beta Theta Pi fraternity.[9][10] Stoneman was selected by the Chicago 
Cubs in the 31st round of the 1966 Major League Baseball draft, the 595th 
overall selection. After college and the baseball draft, Stoneman pitched 
in the Rookie League in Caldwell, Single A in Lodi, and Double-A in Dallas 
in 1966. He started out the 1967 season in Double A and moved to Triple-A 
in Tacoma. Stoneman was called up to the major leagues in mid-season, where 
he appeared in 28 games as a reliever for the Chicago Cubs, with a 3.29 
ERA and 52 strikeouts in 63 innings. In the expansion draft of October 
1968, Stoneman was selected by the Montreal Expos, where he spent five 
seasons and became a starter for manager Gene Mauch.[11] He threw his two 
no-hitters as an Expo: the first against the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie 
Mack Stadium on April 17, 1969. It was Stoneman's fifth major league start 
and only the ninth game of the franchise's existence, done with eight strikeouts 
and five walks.[8][11][12][13] The second came at the end of the 1972 season 
on October 2; he beat the New York Mets in Montreal at Jarry Park.[14][15][16] 
It was the first-ever major league no-hitter pitched in Canada; both were 
7–0 scores. The second included nine strikeouts (and seven walks). Stoneman 
also threw a one-hitter at home in 1971 against the San Diego Padres, a 
well-attended 2–0 win on Helmet Night on Wednesday, June 16. In perhaps 
the best outing of his career, Stoneman struck out 14 and allowed just 
one base on balls. The only hit came with one out in the seventh, a clean 
single to right, which was the Padres' only well-struck ball of the night.[17] 
He was named to the National League All-Star Team in 1972 and pitched two 
innings in relief with two strikeouts.[18][19][20] Only 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) 
and 170 lb (77 kg), Stoneman was a workhorse who for four consecutive seasons 
(1969–72) logged more than 200 innings pitched. He struck out 251 in 295 
innings in 1971, with a 17–16 record and a 3.15 ERA for non-contending 
Montreal, 71–90 (.441). Stoneman was third in strikeouts in the National 
League in 1971, behind Tom Seaver (289) and Ferguson Jenkins (263), and 
his 39 starts tied for the league-high with Jenkins. He also had 20 complete 
games in 1971, tied for third with Bob Gibson.[21] His career was shortened 
by an arm injury in 1973: his earned run average ballooned from 2.98 in 
1972 to 6.80 (1973), then 6.10 (1974), and had a record of 5–16 in that 
span. Overall, Stoneman won 54 games and lost 85 (.388), with an ERA of 
4.08 in 245 games. As a batter, Stoneman holds the dubious record for most 
consecutive games played with at least one strikeout. From April 30, 1971 
to April 21, 1972, Stoneman played in 37 consecutive games with at least 
one strikeout in an at bat.[22] Amazingly, he was left in to bat in the 
1972 All-Star Game against Gaylord Perry, and predictably struck out in 
the bottom of the seventh inning.[19] In 338 regular season at bats, Stoneman 
struck out 212 times and compiled a career batting average of .086 with 
25 singles, 4 extra-base hits (all doubles), and 23 walks. Despite the 
strikeout streak, his best season batting average was .129 in 1971. After 
his playing career ended, Stoneman worked in banking in Canada and then 
joined the Montreal front office in November 1983, first in player relations,[23] 
He became the team's vice president of business operations in September 
1984,[24] and later served as the club's general manager. Stoneman became 
general manager of the Angels after the 1999 season. He hired Mike Scioscia 
as the club's manager and presided over its 2002 American League title 
and World Series championship and the team's ownership transition from 
the Walt Disney Company to Arturo Moreno. Stoneman stepped down as GM following 
the 2007 season. On July 1, 2015, Angels general manager Jerry DiPoto resigned 
following a power struggle with manager Mike Scioscia. Stoneman was brought 
in as interim GM, while the team looks for a full-time replacement.[25]
