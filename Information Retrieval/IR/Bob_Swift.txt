Robert Virgil Swift (March 6, 1915 – October 17, 1966) was an American 
professional baseball player, coach, manager and scout. He played in Major 
League Baseball as a catcher, standing 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and 
weighing 180 pounds (82 kg). He threw and batted right-handed. Swift is 
pictured in one of the most famous photographs in American sporting history. 
He was the catcher for the Detroit Tigers on August 19, 1951, when St. 
Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck sent midget Eddie Gaedel to pinch hit during 
an actual MLB game. The stunt was inspired by the James Thurber short story 
You Could Look It Up and Gaedel was allowed to bat when the Browns showed 
the umpires a legitimate baseball contract. Swift knelt on the ground to 
receive pitcher Bob Cain's offerings—it is this kneeling stance that is 
captured in the photo—and Gaedel took a base on balls. He was immediately 
replaced at first base by a pinch runner and he never appeared in a big 
league game again; he had had no baseball experience in the first place. 
While Gaedel was a novice, Swift, a native of Salina, Kansas, played 14 
consecutive seasons (1940–53) in the big leagues. Primarily a second-string 
catcher, he toiled for the Browns (1940–42), Philadelphia Athletics (1942–43) 
and Tigers (1944–53), appearing in 1,001 games and hitting .231. A good 
defensive catcher, he batted and threw right-handed. He became a coach 
and minor league manager immediately upon the end of his playing career, 
coaching for the Tigers (1953–54; 1963–66), Kansas City Athletics (1957–59), 
and Washington Senators (1960). During the 1959 season, Swift filled in 
for Kansas City manager Harry Craft when Craft missed 15 games due to illness, 
and the Athletics won ten straight games and went 13–2. But Swift was bypassed 
at season's end when the A's changed managers.[1] Swift was in his second 
stint as a Detroit coach in 1965 when manager Chuck Dressen was felled 
by a mild heart attack during spring training. As acting manager, Swift 
led Detroit to a 24–18 record until Dressen was able to return on May 31. 
The next season, on May 16, 1966, Dressen suffered his second coronary 
in as many seasons. Again, Swift took the reins, but in mid-July (with 
the Tigers 32–25 under his command) he fell ill and was hospitalized during 
the All-Star game break for what appeared to be food poisoning. Tests revealed, 
however, that Swift was suffering from lung cancer. Coach Frank Skaff took 
over July 14 as the team's second acting manager and finished the campaign. 
Three months after stepping aside, on October 17, Swift died in Detroit 
at the age of 51. (Dressen had predeceased him, on August 10.) His record 
in 1965–66 as an interim manager was 56–43 (.566), giving him a career
