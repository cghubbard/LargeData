Carl Ray Pohlad (August 23, 1915 â€“ January 5, 2009) was an American financier 
and the owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball franchise from 1984 (succeeding 
Calvin Griffith) until his death in 2009. In 2009, Pohlad had an estimated 
net worth of $3.6 billion, placing him No. 102 on the annual Forbes 400 
list of the wealthiest Americans.[1] Carl Pohlad was born on August 23, 
1915 in Des Moines, Iowa, to poor parents of Slovak descent, Mary M. (Sodak) 
and Michael Pohlad.[2][3] He grew up in West Des Moines, Iowa and graduated 
from Valley High School in West Des Moines in 1934. He attended and played 
football for Compton Junior College in Southern California for a short 
time. Bing Crosby saw him play football and recruited him to play for his 
alma mater, Gonzaga University in Washington. Pohlad attended Gonzaga but 
dropped out after the football season of his senior year. Pohlad was drafted 
in WWII and served from 1943 to 1946. During his service, he fought in 
Europe, spending time in France, Germany, and Austria. Pohlad was scheduled 
to participate in the Normandy Invasion (D-Day), but a case of poison oak 
kept him out of the invasion's early stages. He was wounded in battle, 
and was awarded the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star Medal. After the war 
he returned to Iowa, married Mary Eloise O'Rourke Pohlad and later moved 
to Edina, Minnesota.[4] Eloise died in 2003. They had three sons during 
their 56-year marriage: James, Robert, and William, who all serve as Executive 
Board Members of the Minnesota Twins.[5] Pohlad got his start in the banking 
business by foreclosing farms during the Great Depression. After the Depression, 
he began investing in community banks. Over several decades, he built a 
banking empire. He bought deposits from The Midwest Federal Savings & Loan 
after its collapse in 1989. In late 1991 he sold his bank, Marquette Bank, 
which was owned by the Bank Shares, Inc. holding company, to First Bank 
(now US Bank), with the deal finally closing in 1993. In 2006 Forbes ranked 
him tied for the 107th richest person in the United States, with a net 
worth of $2.6 billion.[6] Pohlad became president of the Twin City Rapid 
Transit (the Minneapolis St. Paul bus and streetcar company), saving it 
from Fred A. Ossanna (who was convicted in 1960 of illegally taking personal 
profit from the company). Pohlad was also the Vice President of Pohlad 
Companies, which owns several companies large and small, including Marquette 
Financial Companies, United Properties, River Road Entertainment, Stanton 
Group Holdings,[7] Avtex,[8] Arcadia Solutions, KTWN-FM FM (B-96) Radio 
Station (through Northern Lights Broadcasting, a holding company),[9] and 
JB Hudson's Jewelers[10] in the Twin Cities, as well as a controlling interest 
in PepsiAmericas, the second-largest bottling group in the United States. 
Pohlad purchased the Minnesota Twins baseball franchise in 1984. The Twins 
won their first World Series in 1987, and a second World Series in 1991. 
Pohlad claimed he was close to selling the Twins in 1997 to North Carolina 
businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the Piedmont Triad 
area of the state.[11] The defeat of a referendum for a stadium in that 
area and a lack of interest in a move to Charlotte killed the deal. In 
2001, he offered to sell the team for a reported $150 million to Major 
League Baseball as part of a contraction plan by the league, in effect 
eliminating the Twins.[12] Pohlad also owned a part of the Minnesota Vikings 
from the mid-1980s to 1991.[13] Pohlad died of natural causes on January 
5, 2009, at the age of 93.[14] His funeral was held at the Basilica of 
Saint Mary, Minneapolis. His son Jim took over day-to-day operations of
