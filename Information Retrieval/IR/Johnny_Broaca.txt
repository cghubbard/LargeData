John Joseph Broaca (October 3, 1909 – May 16, 1985) was an American professional 
baseball pitcher from 1934 to 1939. Broaca won at least 12 games for the 
New York Yankees his first three seasons. However, in 1937, Broaca took 
a leave of absence for no apparent reason and only pitched in 7 games. 
He did not pitch at all in 1938, and in 1939 he played briefly with the 
Cleveland Indians. His lifetime record as a pitcher for the New York Yankees 
and Cleveland Indians was 44–29. Broaca was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts 
and was of Lithuanian descent.[1] He attended Lawrence High School, but 
transferred to and graduated from Phillips Academy after two years. He 
continued his education at Yale University. While at Yale, he was a tri-sport 
athlete, competing in baseball, boxing, and track. In his rookie season 
with the New York Yankees in 1934, Broaca went 12–9 as a starter with an 
earned run average of 4.16. In 1935, he had his most successful statistical 
season, where he went 15–7 with an ERA of 3.58. In 1936, the year the Yankees 
won the World Series, Broaca was 12–7 with an ERA of 4.24. In 1937, after 
starting the season with a disappointing 1–4 record, Broaca abruptly left 
the team with his wife eight months pregnant—becoming the first player 
to jump the team in at least a quarter-century. He was only heard from 
again in September, when his wife filed for divorce on grounds of severe 
abuse at his hands.[2] The Yankees were so outraged by what emerged in 
the trial that they voted Broaca's wife a $1,000 World Series share. His 
hiatus from baseball extended into the entire 1938 season. It was rumored 
at the time that Broaca's wife was involved in affairs with a number of 
his Yankees teammates. Broaca had a brief stint as a professional boxer, 
but failed to win a single bout. The Yankees were willing to bring him 
back in 1938, but reneged on his demand to cover his medical expenses.[2] 
In 1939, the Yankees traded his rights to the Cleveland Indians. He was 
used primarily as a reliever, and he appeared in 22 games with a 4-2 record. 
However, by this time it was apparent his arm was giving out; he'd had 
arm trouble since at least his collegiate days.[1] After the season, he 
was traded to the New York Giants.[2] However, by this time it was obvious 
he was finished. The Giants traded him back to the Indians in June, and 
the Indians promptly released him. After working on the home front in World 
War II, Broaca spent most of the rest of his life as a common laborer on 
road construction crews. His coworkers learned early on never to ask him 
about baseball. He died in 1985, having not spoken to his son in almost
