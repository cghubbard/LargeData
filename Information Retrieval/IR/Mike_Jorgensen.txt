As player As manager Michael Jorgensen (born August 16, 1948) is an American 
former professional baseball first baseman and outfielder who currently 
works in the St. Louis Cardinals' front office. The New York Mets drafted 
him in the fourth round of the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft. In a 17-year 
Major League Baseball (MLB) playing career spanning from 1968 to 1985, 
he played primarily with the Mets and Montreal Expos and had brief stints 
with the Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers and Oakland Athletics. 
He also has served as a manager for the Cardinals. Jorgensen made his major 
league debut with the New York Mets as a September call-up in 1968. He 
played the entire 1969 season in the minors. On April 5, 1972, he was traded 
with Tim Foli and Ken Singleton to the Montreal Expos for Rusty Staub. 
It was in Montreal where Jorgensen enjoyed his greatest success. In 1973, 
he earned his only Gold Glove Award as a first baseman, the only time between 
1967 and 1977 that a Los Angeles Dodger first baseman did not win the Gold 
Glove Award: Jorgensen broke Wes Parker's six-year run from 1967-72 (after 
which season Parker retired from Major League Baseball), and preceded Steve 
Garvey, who won the award from 1974-77. In 1974, he broke the Expos' single 
season record for on-base percentage with .444, on the way to setting career 
highs in batting average (.310), slugging percentage (.488) and adjusted 
OPS (156).[1] The next year, he set more career highs with the bat—clubbing 
18 home runs, and driving in 67 runs.[2] Jorgensen became expendable when 
the Expos acquired future Hall of Fame first baseman Tony Pérez and was 
traded to the Oakland Athletics at the start of the 1977 season. Following 
one season with the A's, he signed as a free agent with the Texas Rangers. 
On May 28, 1979, Jorgensen was hit in the head by a pitch from Boston Red 
Sox' Andy Hassler. Dave Roberts entered the game to pinch run for Jorgensen, 
and Pat Putnam took over as the Rangers' regular first baseman for the 
next month. Excluding one pinch-hitting appearance on May 31, he did not 
play again until July 1. After suffering headaches, it was discovered he 
had a small blood clot inside his head, which apparently caused a seizure, 
and could have resulted in death.[3] Following the season, he was traded 
back to the Mets to complete a mid-season deal in which the Mets had sent 
Willie Montañez to the Rangers for two players to be named later (the other 
player the Mets received was pitcher Ed Lynch). During the first-ever fireworks 
night hosted at Shea Stadium on July 4, 1980, Montreal Expos rookie Bill 
Gullickson sailed a pitch over Jorgensen's head in the second game of a 
doubleheader. Jorgensen motioned towards Gullickson in disapproval. Mets 
catcher John Stearns then charged out of the dugout and slammed Gullickson 
to the ground.[4] Jorgensen's second go-around with the Mets lasted until 
June 15, 1983. The Mets sold him to the Atlanta Braves the day they acquired 
first baseman Keith Hernández from the St. Louis Cardinals for pitchers 
Neil Allen and Rick Ownbey. A year to the day later, the Braves traded 
him with Ken Dayley to the Cardinals for Ken Oberkfell. With the Cardinals, 
he reached his first World Series in 1985 in his final season. Coincidentally, 
Hassler was also a member of this team. Following Joe Torre's firing as 
manager of the Cardinals in 1995, Jorgensen finished the season as their 
interim manager. He led St. Louis to a 42-54 win-loss record before Tony
