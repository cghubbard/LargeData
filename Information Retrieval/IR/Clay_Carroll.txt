Clay Palmer Carroll (born May 2, 1941) is a former relief pitcher in Major 
League Baseball with a 15-year career from 1964 to 1978. He pitched for 
the Milwaukee Braves and Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals 
and Pittsburgh Pirates, all of the National League, and the Chicago White 
Sox of the American League. Clay Carroll was one of nine children of a 
cotton mill worker, who died in 1966.[1] Growing up in Clanton, Alabama, 
Carroll went to school and also worked many jobs, including as a curb-service 
boy at a restaurant, at the cotton mill where his father worked, and loading 
watermelons onto trucks.[2] Carroll was signed by the Milwaukee Braves 
as an amateur free agent in 1961,[3] and made his major league debut at 
age 23 on September 2, 1964, hurling two shutout innings against the Cardinals.[4] 
Carroll, nicknamed "Hawk" due to his profile, was selected to the National 
League All-Star team in 1971 and 1972. He led the National League in saves 
in 1972 with 37, and finished tied for fifth in the Cy Young Award voting. 
The 37 saves stood as a National League record until Bruce Sutter broke 
it in 1984 with 45 saves for the St. Louis Cardinals. Carroll's best seasons 
were with the Reds from 1968 to 1975, which earned him a place in the Cincinnati 
Reds Hall of Fame. Carroll pitched in three World Series for the Reds, 
including the 1975 World Series which the Reds won in seven games over 
the Boston Red Sox. Carroll starred in the 1970 World Series as he appeared 
in five of the six games, hurling nine shutout innings with 11 strikeouts 
to pace a staff that otherwise struggled against Baltimore. Carroll was 
the winning pitcher in the Reds' only victory against the Orioles. Overall, 
Carroll had an impressive 1.39 ERA in 22 postseason appearances, allowing 
just five earned runs in 32.3 innings. A September 1972 newspaper article 
noted that Carroll and his wife Judy were the parents of two daughters, 
Connie and Lori, then ages four and three.[1] Two years later their son 
Bret was born. The Carrolls divorced in 1981.[5] In 1983 Carroll married 
Frances Nowitzke, who also had three children.[5] During a November 1985 
shooting in their home in Bradenton, Florida, Carroll was wounded, and 
his wife Frances, 53, and son Bret, 11, were shot and killed by Frances' 
son, Frederick.[6][7][8] Carroll's stepson was convicted of murder. Several 
years later a new trial was ordered, and the stepson given a life sentence 
that continues to be served.[9][10][11][12] Carroll still frequently returns 
to Cincinnati for the team's annual RedsFest event, including in December
