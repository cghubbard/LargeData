In 1998, the San Diego Padres won the National League championship and 
advanced to the World Series for the second time in franchise history. 
San Diego featured five All-Stars: pitchers Andy Ashby, Kevin Brown, and 
Trevor Hoffman, and outfielders Tony Gwynn and Greg Vaughn. Brown and Hoffman 
were two of the premier pitchers in baseball for 1998. Brown led the staff 
in wins, earned run average, and strikeouts, and he also finished in the 
league's top five in each category. Hoffman saved 53 games and was voted 
the NL Rolaids Relief Man Award for best closer in the league. Ashby was 
the team's number two starter with 17 wins. The Padres offense was led 
by Vaughn, who had the greatest season of his career in 1998. He ended 
up winning both the Comeback Player of the Year Award and the Silver Slugger 
Award. And in a season headlined by sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, 
Vaughn was matching them in home runs before finishing with 50 (compared 
to 70 for McGwire and 66 for Sosa). Former MVP Ken Caminiti was second 
on the team in home runs and runs batted in. In the regular season, San 
Diego won the NL Western Division. Their 98-64 record was third-best in 
the league, behind only the Atlanta Braves and Houston Astros, who San 
Diego then went a combined 7-3 again in winning the NL pennant. But unfortunately, 
they had to face the 1998 New York Yankees in the World Series. The Padres 
suffered a 4-0 series sweep. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]

Kevin Brown Tony Gwynn Trevor Hoffman Greg Vaughn San Diego wins the series, 
3-1 (SD-Atl) October 17, 1998 at Yankee Stadium in New York City In Game 
1, Kevin Brown took the hill for the Padres and he was opposed by Yankee 
ace and ALCS MVP David Wells. The Yankees began the scoring in the 2nd 
inning, when rookie Ricky Ledée laced a 2 run double into the right field 
corner with the bases loaded. Wells was battered hard for the only time 
in the postseason beginning with the 3rd when Greg Vaughn homered to rightcenter 
with a man aboard tying the game up at 2 runs apiece. In the 5th, Tony 
Gwynn smashed a 2 run shot off the facing of the upper deck and that was 
followed up immediately by Vaughn's second dinger of the night. Trailing 
5-2, the Yanks made their comeback in the 7th. Jorge Posada singled and 
Ledee walked ending the night for Brown. It turned out to be a bad move 
by Padres manager Bruce Bochy. New York took advantage of the Padres bullpen 
with a 3 run homer by Chuck Knoblauch that tied the game at 5. Later in 
the inning, a 2-2 count call by home plate umpire Rich Garcia would prove 
to be decisive. Mark Langston's pitch was shown on television replays to 
be a strike, which Rich Garcia called a ball. Tino Martinez would take 
advantage of Garcia's call and on the next pitch sent a grand slam into 
the upper deck making it a 9-5 lead. The Padres would only score one more 
run as the Yankees won game one 9-6. October 18, 1998 at Yankee Stadium 
in New York City In Game 2, the Bombers would go up 2-0 thanks to a dreadful 
outing by San Diego starter Andy Ashby. Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada 
would go yard to assist the Yankees on offense. New York started Cuban 
import, Orlando Hernández, who was outstanding. October 20, 1998 at Qualcomm 
Stadium in San Diego, California With the Yankees up 2-0, they sent David 
Cone to the mound to face former Yankee pitcher, Sterling Hitchcock, the 
MVP of the NLCS. Both teams were kept off the scoreboard until the bottom 
of the 6th when Hitchcock himself led off the inning with a single off 
Cone. He and Qulivio Veras both scored two batters later when Tony Gwynn 
shot a double down the line past Tino Martinez at first base. Gwynn would 
also score in the inning to give San Diego a 3-0 lead. However, a half 
inning later the Yanks jumped on Hitchcock for two runs beginning with 
a home run to left-center by Scott Brosius. The second run came in after 
Shane Spencer doubled and scored on an error by Ken Caminiti. In the 8th, 
the call was made to Trevor Hoffman after Randy Myers walked Paul O'Neill 
to open the inning. Hoffman then walked Tino Martinez before Scott Brosius 
tagged a three run blast over the fence in dead center. With a 5-3 lead, 
the Yankees wrapped up the victory when Mariano Rivera picked up the save 
in the 9th to end it. October 21, 1998 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, 
California New York's Andy Pettitte outpitched San Diego's Kevin Brown 
with 7 1⁄3 strong innings for the 3-0 Yankees victory, giving the Bombers 
their 24th title. Though New York's reliever Jeff Nelson allowed the Padres 
to load the bases, Mariano Rivera came in to end the threat by getting 
Jim Leyritz, known for his clutch postseason homers with San Diego, to 
fly out. Rivera added another scoreless inning for the save. LEAGUE CHAMPIONS:
