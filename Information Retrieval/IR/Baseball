ajkdd Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine 
players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team attempts 
to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat 
swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of 
four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when 
a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate. Players on 
the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding 
team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several 
ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later 
attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, 
such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and 
fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting 
for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. 
A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number 
of runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball has no game clock, although 
almost all games end in the ninth inning. Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball 
games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game 
was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. 
By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national 
sport of the United States. Baseball is now popular in North America and 
parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia. In the 
United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams 
are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each 
with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The major league champion 
is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series. The top level 
of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues 
and in Cuba between the West League and East League. Contents 1 History

Pesäpallo Baseball portal v t e The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball 
games is difficult to trace with precision. A French manuscript from 1344 
contains an illustration of clerics playing a game, possibly la soule, 
with similarities to baseball.[1] Other old French games such as thèque, 
la balle au bâton, and la balle empoisonnée also appear to be related.[2] 
Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development 
from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland. Baseball 
Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David 
Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered 
historical evidence supports this position. Block argues that rounders 
and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that 
the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and 
"tut-ball."[3] It has long been believed that cricket also descended from 
such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket 
may have been imported to England from Flanders.[4] The earliest known 
reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty 
Pocket-Book, by John Newbery. It contains a rhymed description of "base-ball" 
and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern 
game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with 
posts instead of ground-level bases.[5] David Block discovered that the 
first recorded game of "Bass-Ball" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured 
the Prince of Wales as a player.[6] William Bray, an English lawyer, recorded 
a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey.[7] This 
early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants. 
Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish 
ancestry. The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 
Pittsfield, Massachusetts, town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game 
near the town's new meeting house.[8] By 1796, a version of the game was 
well-known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar's book on popular 
pastimes. As described by Johann Gutsmuths, "englische Base-ball" involved 
a contest between two teams, in which "the batter has three attempts to 
hit the ball while at the home plate." Only one out was required to retire 
a side.[9] Alexander Cartwright, father of modern baseball By the early 
1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games 
recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America. 
These games were often referred to locally as "town ball", though other 
names such as "round-ball" and "base-ball" were also used.[10] Among the 
earliest examples to receive a detailed description—albeit five decades 
after the fact, in a letter from an attendee to Sporting Life magazine—took 
place in Beachville, Ontario, in 1838. There were many similarities to 
modern baseball, and some crucial differences: five bases (or byes); first 
bye just 18 feet (5.5 m) from the home bye; batter out if a hit ball was 
caught after the first bounce.[11] The once widely accepted story that 
Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839 has 
been conclusively debunked by sports historians.[12] In 1845, Alexander 
Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification 
of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules.[13] The practice, common to bat-and-ball 
games of the day, of "soaking" or "plugging"—effecting a putout by hitting 
a runner with a thrown ball—was barred. The rules thus facilitated the 
use of a smaller, harder ball than had been common. Several other rules 
also brought the Knickerbockers' game close to the modern one, though a 
ball caught on the first bounce was, again, an out and only underhand pitching 
was allowed.[14] While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers 
played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially 
recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in 
Hoboken, New Jersey: the "New York Nine" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, 
in four innings[15] (three earlier games have recently been discovered). 
With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball 
continued to evolve over the next half-century.[16] History of baseball 
in the United States Main articles: Baseball in the United States and History 
of baseball in the United States The game turns professional In the mid-1850s, 
a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area.[17] By 1856, local 
journals were referring to baseball as the "national pastime" or "national 
game."[18] A year later, sixteen area clubs formed the sport's first governing 
body, the National Association of Base Ball Players. In 1858 in Corona, 
Queens New York, at the Fashion Race Course, the first games of baseball 
to charge admission took place. The games, which took place between the 
all stars of Brooklyn, including players from the Brooklyn Atlantics, Excelsior 
of Brooklyn, Putnams and Eckford of Brooklyn, and the All Stars of New 
York (Manhattan), including players from the New York Knickerbockers, Gothams 
(predecessors of the San Francisco Giants), Eagles and Empire, are commonly 
believed to be the first all-star baseball games.[19][20][21] In 1863, 
the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a fair ball on the 
first bounce. Four years later, it barred participation by African Americans.[22] 
The game's commercial potential was developing: in 1869 the first fully 
professional baseball club, the Cincinnati Red Stockings, was formed and 
went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams.[23] The 
first professional league, the National Association of Professional Base 
Ball Players, lasted from 1871 to 1875; scholars dispute its status as 
a major league.[24] The more formally structured National League was founded 
in 1876. As the oldest surviving major league, the National League is sometimes 
referred to as the "senior circuit."[25] Several other major leagues formed 
and failed. In 1884, African American Moses Walker (and, briefly, his brother 
Welday) played in one of these, the American Association.[26] An injury 
ended Walker's major league career, and by the early 1890s, a gentlemen's 
agreement in the form of the baseball color line effectively barred black 
players from the white-owned professional leagues, major and minor.[27] 
Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded. Several independent 
African American teams succeeded as barnstormers.[28] Also in 1884, overhand 
pitching was legalized.[29] In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor 
baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent 
game.[30] Virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893; 
the last major change—counting foul balls as strikes—was instituted in 
1901.[29] The National League's first successful counterpart, the American 
League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established that 
year.[31] The two leagues, each with eight teams, were rivals that fought 
for the best players, often disregarding each other's contracts and engaging 
in bitter legal disputes.[32] The New York Giants baseball team, 1913. 
Fred Merkle, sixth in line, committed a baserunning gaffe in a crucial 
1908 game that became famous as Merkle's Boner. A modicum of peace was 
eventually established, leading to the National Agreement of 1903. The 
pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between 
them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing 
most of the country's minor professional leagues.[33] The World Series, 
pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated 
that fall, albeit without express major league sanction: The Boston Americans 
of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National 
League.[34] The next year, the series was not held, as the National League 
champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize 
the major league status of the American League and its champion.[35] In 
1905, the Giants were National League champions again and team management 
relented, leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major 
leagues' annual championship event.[36] As professional baseball became 
increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners 
over issues of control and equitable income distribution. During the major 
leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted 
strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. 
In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, 
which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, 
tended to keep the players in check.[37] Motivated by dislike for particularly 
stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, 
members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. 
The Black Sox Scandal led to the formation of a new National Commission 
of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together.[38] The first 
major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected 
in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; 
the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part 
of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.[39] Professional 
baseball was played in northeastern cities with a large immigrant-ethnic 
population; they gave strong support to the new sport. The Irish Catholics 
dominated in the late 19th century, comprising a third or more of the players 
and many of the top stars and managers.[40] Historian Jerrold Casway argues 
that: Baseball for Irish kids was a shortcut to the American dream and 
to self-indulgent glory and fortune. By the mid-1880s these young Irish 
men dominated the sport and popularized a style of play that was termed 
heady, daring, and spontaneous.... Ed Delahanty personified the flamboyant, 
exciting spectator-favorite, the Casey-at-the-bat, Irish slugger. The handsome 
masculine athlete who is expected to live as large as he played.[41] Rise 
of Ruth and racial integration Babe Ruth in 1920, the year he joined the 
New York Yankees Compared with the present, professional baseball in the 
early 20th century was lower-scoring and pitchers, the likes of Walter 
Johnson and Christy Mathewson, were more dominant. The "inside game," which 
demanded that players "scratch for runs", was played much more aggressively 
than it is today: the brilliant and often violent Ty Cobb epitomized this 
style.[42] The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several 
changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. Strict 
new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition along 
with a new rule officially banning the spitball, along with other pitches 
that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances 
after the death of Ray Chapman who was hit by a pitch in August 1920, coupled 
with superior materials available after World War I, resulted in a ball 
that traveled farther when hit. The construction of additional seating 
to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of 
bringing the outfield fences closer in, making home runs more common.[43] 
The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter 
of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. The club 
with which Ruth set most of his slugging records, the New York Yankees, 
built a reputation as the majors' premier team.[44] In the late 1920s and 
early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested 
in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern "farm system".[45] 
A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it 
was joined by the Negro American League. The first elections to the Baseball 
Hall of Fame took place in 1936. In 1939 Little League Baseball was founded 
in Pennsylvania. By the late 1940s, it was the organizing body for children's 
baseball leagues across the United States. Jackie Robinson in 1945, with 
the era's Kansas City Royals, a barnstorming squad associated with the 
Negro American League's Kansas City Monarchs With America's entry into 
World War II, many professional players had left to serve in the armed 
forces. A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and 
the major league game seemed under threat as well. Chicago Cubs owner Philip 
K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players 
to help keep the game in the public eye – the All-American Girls Professional 
Baseball League existed from 1943 to 1954.[46] The inaugural College World 
Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded. 
This program soon became another important organizing body for children's 
baseball. The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from 
white-controlled professional ball occurred the previous year: Jackie Robinson 
was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers—where Branch Rickey 
had become general manager—and began playing for their minor league team 
in Montreal.[47] In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier 
when he debuted with the Dodgers. Larry Doby debuted with the American 
League's Cleveland Indians the same year.[48] Latin American players, largely 
overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. 
In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black 
Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars.[49][50] 
Facing competition as varied as television and football, baseball attendance 
at all levels declined. While the majors rebounded by the mid-1950s, the 
minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved.[51][52] 
Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league 
teams had a black player on the roster.[49] That year, the Major League 
Baseball Players Association was founded. It was the first professional 
baseball union to survive more than briefly, but it remained largely ineffective 
for years.[53] No major league team had been located west of St. Louis 
until 1958, when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to 
Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively.[54] The majors' final all-white 
bastion, the Boston Red Sox, added a black player in 1959.[49] With the 
integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players, the 
last Negro league folded the following year.[55] In 1961, the American 
League reached the West Coast with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team, 
and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162. This coincidentally 
helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth's long-standing single-season home run 
record, one of the most celebrated marks in baseball.[56] Along with the 
Angels, three other new franchises were launched during 1961–62. With this, 
the first major league expansion in 60 years, each league now had ten teams. 
Attendance records and the age of steroids The players' union became bolder 
under the leadership of former United Steelworkers chief economist and 
negotiator Marvin Miller, who was elected executive director in 1966.[57] 
On the playing field, major league pitchers were becoming increasingly 
dominant again. After the 1968 season, in an effort to restore balance, 
the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher's mound was lowered 
from 15 to 10 inches. In 1969, both the National and American leagues added 
two more expansion teams, the leagues were reorganized into two divisions 
each, and a post-season playoff system leading to the World Series was 
instituted. Also that same year, Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals 
made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause. The major 
leagues' first general players' strike took place in 1972.[58] In another 
effort to add more offense to the game, the American League adopted the 
designated hitter rule the following year.[59] In 1975, the union's power—and 
players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was 
effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system.[60] In 1977, 
two more expansion teams joined the American League. Significant work stoppages 
occurred again in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of 
the World Series for the first time in 90 years.[61] Attendance had been 
growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, 
the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance.[52][62] 
In May 2010, the Philadelphia Phillies' Roy Halladay pitched the 20th major 
league perfect game. That October, he pitched only the second no-hitter 
in MLB postseason history. The addition of two more expansion teams after 
the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues, 
this time into three divisions each. Offensive production—the number of 
home runs in particular—had surged that year, and again in the abbreviated 
1994 season.[63] After play resumed in 1995, this trend continued and non-division-winning 
wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season. Regular-season 
interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance 
mark for a full season was set.[64] The next year, Mark McGwire and Sammy 
Sosa both surpassed Maris's decades-old single season home run record and 
two more expansion franchises were added. In 2000, the National and American 
leagues were dissolved as legal entities. While their identities were maintained 
for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations 
and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they 
had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major 
League Baseball (MLB).[65] In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current 
record of 73 home runs in a single season. There had long been suspicions 
that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by 
the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent 
due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media 
attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing 
drugs before 2004.[66] In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, 
surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance 
both reached all-time highs.[67][68] Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as 
well as many other players, including storied pitcher Roger Clemens—have 
been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal, their feats and those of 
other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction.[69] In 
contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 
1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking 
in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade.[70] With 
more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use 
a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, 
which became known as the "Year of the Pitcher".[71] Runs per game fell 
to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than 
it had been in half a century.[72] Before the start of the 2012 season, 
MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams admitted 
into the playoffs to two per league.[73] The playoff expansion resulted 
in the addition of annual one-game playoffs between the wild card teams 
in each league.[74] Baseball around the world Main article: History of 
baseball outside the United States See also: Baseball in Cuba, Baseball 
in Japan, and Baseball in the United Kingdom Baseball, widely known as 
America's pastime, is well established in several other countries as well. 
The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that 
of the sport in the United States. As early as 1877, a professional league, 
the International Association, featured teams from both countries.[75] 
While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have 
been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a 
Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League 
as an expansion team. In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the 
American League. The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993, the 
first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so. 
After the 2004 season, Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington, 
D.C., where the team is now known as the Nationals. Sadaharu Oh managing 
the Japan national team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. Playing for 
the Central League's Yomiuri Giants (1959–80), Oh set the professional 
world record for home runs. In 1847, American soldiers played what may 
have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, 
Veracruz. A few days after the Battle of Cerro Gordo, they used the "wooden 
leg captured (by the Fourth Illinois regiment) from General Santa Anna".[76] 
The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada 
was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition 
and whose national team has been one of the world's strongest since international 
play began in the late 1930s (all organized baseball in the country has 
officially been amateur since the Cuban Revolution). The Dominican Republic 
held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912.[77] Professional 
baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between 
the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), 
Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938).[78] The Japanese major 
leagues—the Central League and Pacific League—have long been considered 
the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.[79] 
Japan has a professional minor league system as well, though it is much 
smaller than the American version—each team has only one farm club in contrast 
to MLB teams' four or five.[80] After World War II, professional leagues 
were founded in many Latin American nations, most prominently Venezuela 
(1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955).[81] Since the early 1970s, the 
annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four 
leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball 
League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, 
and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. In Asia, South Korea (1982), 
Taiwan (1990), and China (2003) all have professional leagues.[82] Many 
European countries have professional leagues as well, the most successful, 
other than the Dutch league, being the Italian league founded in 1948.[83] 
Compared to those in Asia and Latin America, the various European leagues 
and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal. 
In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games. The 
Israel Baseball League, launched in 2007, folded after one season.[84] 
The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), 
founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from 
different countries, as well as national squads. Other competitions between 
national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball 
tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation 
(IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International 
Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both 
sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC). By 2009, the 
IBAF had 117 member countries.[85] Women's baseball is played on an organized 
amateur basis in many of the countries where it is a leading men's sport. 
Since 2004, the IBAF and now WBSC have sanctioned the Women's Baseball 
World Cup, featuring national teams. After being admitted to the Olympics 
as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from 
the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee 
meeting. It remained part of the 2008 Games. The elimination of baseball, 
along with softball, from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider 
adding two different sports, but none received the votes required for inclusion.[86] 
While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, 
more important was Major League Baseball's reluctance to have a break during 
the Games to allow its players to participate, as the National Hockey League 
now does during the Winter Olympic Games. Such a break is more difficult 
for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into 
cold weather.[87] Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics, the 
IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation 
of top players, but the effort failed.[88] Major League Baseball initiated 
the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede the major league season, 
partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. The inaugural 
Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national 
teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants.[89][90] The 
Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of 
an expanded World Baseball Classic.[91] Rules and gameplay Main article: 
Baseball rules A game is played between two teams, each composed of nine 
players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and 
defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in 
the field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine 
innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in 
college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats 
in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily 
the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The 
goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The 
players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing 
a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball 
diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise 
to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score 
a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring 
and to record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action 
until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three 
outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If 
the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played 
to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, 
involve different numbers of players and innings.[92] Diagram of a baseball 
field (the term diamond may be used to refer to the square area defined 
by the four bases or to the entire playing field). The dimensions given 
are for professional and professional-style games. Children often play 
on smaller fields. The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, 
the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 
90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; 
the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field 
enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the 
area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield 
is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) 
at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated 
by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur 
games are played on unfenced fields). Fair territory between home plate 
and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant 
events can take place in foul territory, as well.[93] There are three basic 
tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt: The baseball 
is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) 
in circumference. It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered 
in white cowhide, with red stitching.[94] The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally 
made of a single, solid piece of wood. Other materials are now commonly 
used for nonprofessional games. It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches 
(6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower 
handle and culminating in a knob. Bats used by adults are typically around 
34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (106 centimeters).[95] 
The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing 
between the fingers. As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it 
takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.[96] 
Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.[97] At 
the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team 
arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on 
the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one 
foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward 
home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home 
plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically 
arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside 
the imaginary lines between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. 
In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several 
steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second 
base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the 
right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center 
fielder, and right fielder. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher.[98] 
Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the 
number will vary depending on the level of play, amateur or children's 
games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires 
can be used for important Major League Baseball games. David Ortiz, the 
batter, awaiting a pitch, with the catcher, and umpire Play starts with 
a batter standing at home plate, holding a bat.[99] The batter waits for 
the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts 
to hit the ball[100] with the bat.[99] The catcher catches pitches that 
the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or 
failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the 
ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward 
first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until 
the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base 
without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. 
A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance 
to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached 
safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has 
recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited 
with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result 
of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the 
air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, 
if there is one), it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base 
may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable 
result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake 
is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged 
with an error.[99] Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on 
batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before 
or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance 
if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing 
through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the 
base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and 
caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base 
may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were 
at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also 
attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process 
of delivering the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.[101] 
A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike 
or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out. 
A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls 
or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance 
to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside 
the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid 
being hit.)[102] Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's 
judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual 
area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's 
shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.[103] A strike is called 
when one of the following happens: The batter lets a well-pitched ball 
(one within the strike zone) go through to the catcher. The batter swings 
at any ball (even one outside the strike zone) and misses, or foul tips 
it directly into the catcher's hands. The batter hits a foul ball—one that 
either initially lands in foul territory or initially lands within the 
diamond but moves into foul territory before passing first or third base. 
If there are already two strikes on the batter, a foul ball is not counted 
as a third strike; thus, a foul ball cannot result in the immediate strikeout 
of the batter. (There is an exception to this exception: a two-strike foul 
bunt is recorded as a third strike.) A ball is called when the pitcher 
throws a pitch that is outside the strike zone, provided the batter has 
not swung at it.[103][104] A shortstop tries to tag out a runner who is 
sliding headfirst, attempting to reach second base. While the team at bat 
is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record 
outs. Among the various ways a member of the batting team may be put out, 
five are most common: The strikeout: as described above, recorded against 
a batter who makes three strikes before putting the ball into play or being 
awarded a free advance to first base (see also uncaught third strike). 
The flyout: as described above, recorded against a batter who hits a ball 
in the air that is caught by a fielder, whether in fair territory or foul 
territory, before it lands, whether or not the batter has run. The ground 
out: recorded against a batter (in this case, batter-runner) who hits a 
ball that lands in fair territory which, before the batter-runner can reach 
first base, is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding 
the ball or relays it to another fielder who touches first base while holding 
the ball. The force out: recorded against a runner who is required to attempt 
to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball 
lands in fair territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the 
basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the 
next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The 
ground out is technically a special case of the force out. The tag out: 
recorded against a runner who is touched by a fielder with the ball or 
a glove holding the ball, while the runner is not touching a base. It is 
possible to record two outs in the course of the same play—a double play. 
Even three—a triple play—is possible, though this is very rare. Players 
put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout 
or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded 
against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the 
team in its next turn at bat—every half-inning begins with the bases empty 
of runners.[105] An individual player's turn batting or plate appearance 
is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, 
or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded 
against a teammate. On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, 
without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against 
a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting 
to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance 
starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded 
against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle 
the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single 
run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that 
player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's 
team have all taken their turn at bat. The batting order is set before 
the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once 
a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter 
the game. Children's games often have more liberal substitution rules.[106] 
If the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth 
player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run). The DH takes the 
place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, 
but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting 
order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.[107] 
Personnel Player rosters Defensive positions on a baseball field, with 
abbreviations and scorekeeper's position numbers (not uniform numbers). 
Roster, or squad, sizes differ between different leagues and different 
levels of organized play. Major League Baseball teams maintain 25-player 
active rosters. A typical 25-man roster in a league without the DH rule, 
such as MLB's National League, features:[108] eight position players—catcher, 
four infielders, three outfielders—who play on a regular basis five starting 
pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation 
six relief pitchers, including one specialist closer, who constitute the 
team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up) one 
backup, or substitute, catcher two backup infielders two backup outfielders 
one specialist pinch hitter, or a second backup catcher, or a seventh reliever 
In the American League and others with the DH rule, there will usually 
be nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, 
seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher and two or three other reserves; 
the need for late inning pinch-hitters (usually in the pitcher's spot) 
is reduced by the DH. Other personnel Relief pitchers warming up, overseen 
by a bullpen coach. A manager will often have both a right-handed and a 
left-handed reliever warm up to maximize strategic options. The manager, 
or head coach of a team, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, 
such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting 
order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, 
bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or 
more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working 
with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. 
At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field 
when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying 
designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist in the direction 
of baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from 
the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play.[109] In contrast 
to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear 
their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed 
on the playing field during a game.[110] Any baseball game involves one 
or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play. At a minimum, 
one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike 
zone, and call balls and strikes. Additional umpires may be stationed near 
the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted 
force outs and tag outs. In Major League Baseball, four umpires are used 
for each game, one near each base. In the playoffs, six umpires are used: 
one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.[111] Strategy 
and tactics Play media Matthew Dipasupil Summer 2014 Baseball Video Many 
of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around 
a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful 
against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed 
batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers.[112] 
A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup who knows 
the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher may respond by starting 
one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster. During the 
late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought 
in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create 
favorable matchups with their substitutions: the manager of the fielding 
team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups, the manager 
of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups. With a 
team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting 
position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come 
up again—for a more skillful fielder.[113] Pitching and fielding tactics 
A first baseman receives a pickoff throw, as the runner dives back to first 
base. The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball 
game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball 
in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can 
cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches 
the batter.[114] Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be 
thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed 
pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider.[115] Pitchers 
have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, 
before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to 
throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location.[116] 
If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the 
sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on 
base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw 
to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, 
effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that 
severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff 
attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire 
calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, 
if any, advance one base with impunity.[114] If an attempted stolen base 
is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately 
off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw 
quickly to a base.[117] Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to 
one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most 
or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. 
With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer 
to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground 
ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in 
infield.[118] Batting and baserunning tactics A batter squares to bunt, 
moving his hands up the barrel of the bat to increase his control and deaden 
the ball on impact. Several basic offensive tactics come into play with 
a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to 
attempt a steal of second base. The hit and run is sometimes employed with 
a skillful contact hitter: the runner takes off with the pitch drawing 
the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in 
the infield for the batter to poke the ball through.[119] The sacrifice 
bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that 
it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance 
into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out 
at first—a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice. (A batter, 
particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit.) 
A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing 
that runner home, is known as a squeeze play.[120] With a runner on third 
and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a 
fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner 
to tag up and score—a successful batter in this case gets credit for a 
sacrifice fly.[118] The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead 
in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing 
at, the next pitch.[121] Distinctive elements Baseball has certain attributes 
that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where 
it has a following, including American and Canadian football, basketball, 
ice hockey, and soccer. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, 
play is less individual and more collective; and in none of them is the 
variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The 
comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's 
distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports. 
No clock to kill A well-worn baseball In clock-limited sports, games often 
end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing 
aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; 
a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not 
constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most 
advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.[122] In contrast, 
again, the clock comes into play even in the case of multi-day Test and 
first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages a team 
that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any 
faint chance at a win to avoid a loss.[123] Baseball offers no such reward 
for conservative batting. While nine innings has been the standard since 
the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major 
league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 
20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. In the 1920s, 
they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 
in 1960.[124] By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National 
League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making 
for quicker outs than designated hitters).[125] In 2004, Major League Baseball 
declared that its goal was an average game of merely 2:45.[124] By 2014, 
though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete.[126] The 
lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings 
for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and 
a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, 
and batters stepping out of the box more frequently.[124][125] Other leagues 
have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball 
took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's 
average of 3:18.[127] Individual focus Although baseball is a team sport, 
individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. In 1915, 
a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of 
which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, 
one-on-one contest: "the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits".[128] 
Contrasting the game with both football and basketball, scholar Michael 
Mandelbaum argues that "baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent 
to the older individual sports".[129] Pitcher, batter, and fielder all 
act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal 
pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play 
itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the 
outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play 
it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The statistical precision 
of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it. As 
described by Mandelbaum, It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess 
the contribution each [football] team member makes to the outcome of the 
play ... [E]very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates 
all the time. In baseball, by contrast, every player is more or less on 
his own ... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and 
total responsibility. A baseball player lives in a glass house, and in 
a stark moral universe ... Everything that every player does is accounted 
for and everything accounted for is either good or bad, right or wrong.[130] 
Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this 
regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance 
of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it 
is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour 
or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding 
error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of 
play.[131] Uniqueness of each baseball park Main article: Baseball park 
Unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly 
in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically 
regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional 
teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is 
that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum 
distance of 325 feet (99 m) from home plate to the fences in left and right 
field and 400 feet (122 m) to center.[132] Major league teams often skirt 
even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home 
of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 
315 feet (96 m) from home plate.[133] There are no rules at all that address 
the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The 
most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at 
Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 feet 
(94 m) from home plate down the line and 37 feet (11 m) tall.[134] Fenway 
Park, home of the Boston Red Sox. The Green Monster is visible beyond the 
playing field on the left. Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning 
the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely 
out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the 
stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.[135] A 
fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to 
direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is 
farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full 
speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the 
difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run.[136] 
The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the image to the left 
shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually 
all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide 
what areas will be grassed or bare.[137] Some fields—including several 
in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations 
can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded 
as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major 
league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can 
greatly affect how fly balls are played.[138] While football and soccer 
players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, 
the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area 
out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way 
foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely 
insignificant.[139] These physical variations create a distinctive set 
of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude 
and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire 
a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other 
discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional 
park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high 
altitude—5,282 feet (1,610 m) above sea level—is responsible for giving 
it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues.[140] Wrigley 
Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a 
hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, 
it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.[141] The 
absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play 
out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For 
example, hitting a fly ball 330 feet (100 m) into right field might result 
in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. 
A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as 
the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull 
hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who 
spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will 
gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents 
are especially suited to the park.[142] Statistics Main article: Baseball 
statistics Organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree 
than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small 
number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket 
player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was responsible 
for the "development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball 
guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables 
used to describe baseball."[143] The statistical record is so central to 
the game's "historical essence" that Chadwick came to be known as Father 
Baseball.[143] In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and 
more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian 
Alan Schwarz describes as a "tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that 
once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their 
statistics lines."[144] The Official Baseball Rules administered by Major 
League Baseball require the official scorer to categorize each baseball 
play unambiguously. The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. 
The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game 
and the relevant statistical records.[145] General managers, managers, 
and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic 
decisions. Rickey Henderson—the major leagues' all-time leader in runs 
and stolen bases—stealing third base in a 1988 game. Certain traditional 
statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. The basic batting statistics 
include:[146] At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where 
the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where 
the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners 
Hits: times reached base because of a batted, fair ball without fielding 
error or fielder's choice Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home 
safely Runs batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's 
action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter 
grounded into double play or reached on an error Home runs: hits on which 
the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution 
of a fielding error Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional 
measure of batting ability The basic baserunning statistics include:[147] 
Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's 
own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering 
the ball Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a 
base Cy Young—the holder of many major league career marks, including wins 
and innings pitched, as well as losses—in 1908. MLB's annual awards for 
the best pitcher in each league are named for Young. The basic pitching 
statistics include:[148] Wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who 
last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a 
starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win) 
Losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing 
team took a lead that it never relinquished Saves: games where the pitcher 
enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering 
the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three 
runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying 
run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or 
more innings Innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three 
(partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., "5.2" or "7.1", 
the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning) 
Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter Winning percentage: 
wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses) Earned run average (ERA): 
runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine 
innings pitched The basic fielding statistics include:[149] Putouts: times 
the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise 
directly effects an out Assists: times a putout by another fielder was 
recorded following the fielder touching the ball Errors: times the fielder 
fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and 
the batting team benefits as a result Total chances: putouts plus assists 
plus errors Fielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) 
divided by total chances Among the many other statistics that are kept 
are those collectively known as situational statistics. For example, statistics 
can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. 
If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager 
of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the 
pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less 
likely to succeed.[150] Sabermetrics Sabermetrics refers to the field of 
baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical 
tools. The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. 
The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, 
Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research 
(SABR).[151] The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s 
has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians 
argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:[152] 
On-base percentage measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated 
by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus 
walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate 
appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), 
except for sacrifice bunts.[153] Slugging percentage measures a batter's 
ability to hit for power. It is calculated by taking the batter's total 
bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four 
per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.[154] Some of the 
new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use: On-base 
plus slugging (OPS) measures a batter's overall ability. It is calculated 
by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage.[155] 
Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) measures a pitcher's ability 
at preventing hitters from reaching base. It is calculated exactly as its 
name suggests.[156] Popularity and cultural impact Two players on the baseball 
team of Tokyo, Japan's Waseda University in 1921 An Afghan girl playing 
baseball in August 2002. Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen 
described baseball as America's national religion.[157] In the words of 
sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been "a unique paragon 
of American culture"—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse 
scandal.[158] Baseball has an important place in other national cultures 
as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes "how deeply the sport is ingrained 
in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly 
it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan."[159] Since the early 
1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, 
has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent.[160] Hall-of-Famer 
Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto 
Rico's history.[161] While baseball has long been the island's primary 
athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has 
declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began 
to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft.[162] 
In the Western Hemisphere, baseball is also one of the leading sports in 
Canada, Colombia, Mexico, the Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, 
and Venezuela. In Asia, it is among the most popular sports in Japan, South 
Korea and Taiwan. The major league game in the United States was originally 
targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other 
spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents 
in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner 
city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to 
a blue-collar audience.[163] A century later, the situation was very different. 
With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average 
ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had 
become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator 
sports.[164] In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared 
to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions. In 
2008, Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching 
the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades.[165] A new MLB revenue 
record of $6.6 billion was set in 2009.[166] On the other hand, the percentage 
of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport 
was 16%, compared to pro football at 31%. In 1985, the respective figures 
were pro football 24%, baseball 23%.[167] Because there are so many more 
major league baseball games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. 
In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest 
in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year.[67] 
The following year, amid the U.S. recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 
73.4 million.[166] Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball 
umbrella also set a record in 2007, with 42.8 million;[68] this figure 
does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues. 
Opening Day of 1961 Baseball Season. President John F. Kennedy throws out 
first ball. In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator 
team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional 
Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific leagues, 
was estimated at $1 billion in 2007. Total NPB attendance for the year 
was approximately 20 million. While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance 
grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures 
were stagnant. There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring 
star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country.[80] In 
Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport,[168] the 
national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the 
top-level domestic leagues.[169] Revenue figures are not released for the 
country's amateur system. Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, 
the sport's governing authority "has never taken into account attendance ... 
because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes".[170] 
As of 2007, Little League Baseball oversees more than 7,000 children's 
baseball leagues with more than 2.2 million participants–2.1 million in 
the United States and 123,000 in other countries.[171] Babe Ruth League 
teams have over 1 million participants.[172] According to the president 
of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women 
and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the 
introductory game of Tee Ball.[173] A varsity baseball team is an established 
part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges 
in the United States. In 2008, nearly half a million high schoolers and 
over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams.[171] The 
number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 
1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants.[174] By early 
in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. 
Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there.[175] 
The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School 
Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important 
National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast 
around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring 
Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they 
are played.[176] In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system 
of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young 
as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the 
first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.[169] Baseball 
in popular culture The American Tobacco Company's line of baseball cards 
featured shortstop Honus Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1909 to 
1911. In 2007, the card shown here sold for $2.8 million.[177] Baseball 
has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and 
elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; 
in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual 
euphemisms.[178] The first networked radio broadcasts in North America 
were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced 
play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, 
which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, 
Massachusetts.[179] The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item 
not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the 
sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.[180] 
Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment. One of the first 
major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem "Casey at the Bat", appeared in 1888. 
A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be 
called a "clutch situation", the poem became the source of vaudeville and 
other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, 
as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media. There have 
been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride 
of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field 
of Dreams (1989). The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best 
sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham 
(1988) at number 5.[181] Baseball has provided thematic material for hits 
on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J. 
Gaskin's "Slide, Kelly, Slide", Simon and Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson", 
and John Fogerty's "Centerfield".[182] The baseball-founded comedic sketch 
"Who's on First", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became 
famous. Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 
20th century.[183] Baseball is also featured in various video games including 
MLB: The Show, Wii Sports, Kinect Sports: Season 2 and Mario Baseball. 
Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring 
Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for 
the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. 
Henry Waugh, Prop., and W. P. Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field 
of Dreams). Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage 
of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, 
and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell. Among the celebrated 
nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter's The Glory of Their 
Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball. 
The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle 
Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional 
sports.[184] Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms. 
Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards. 
A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side 
and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were 
produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. 
The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, 
with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical 
data. Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the 
source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products 
for different sports and non-sports-related fields.[185] Modern fantasy 
sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by 
New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends. Participants in a Rotisserie 
league draft notional teams from the list of active Major League Baseball 
players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based 
on the players' latest real-world statistics. Rotisserie-style play quickly 
became a phenomenon. Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it 
has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports.[186] 
The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports–related 
websites. By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada 
were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby.[187] The 
burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing 
attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball 
professionals.[188] See also A New York Yankees batter and a Boston Red

in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, caught Stoddart, bowled J. T. Hearne; 
30.' ... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the 
fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody 
else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that 
go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis ...
