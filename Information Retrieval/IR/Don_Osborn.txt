Donald Edwin Osborn (June 23, 1908 – March 23, 1979) was an American pitcher 
and manager in minor league baseball and a scout, farm system official 
and pitching coach at the Major League level. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, 
Osborn threw and batted right-handed, stood 6 feet (1.8 m) tall and weighed 
185 pounds (84 kg). Osborne's professional playing career began in 1929, 
and while he never reached the Major Leagues as a pitcher, he enjoyed great 
success in the Pacific Coast League (1936–38; 1943–47) and the Western

worked under manager Danny Murtaugh, and he was a member of the 1971 World 
Series champion Pirates club. At age 70, Osborn was appointed pitching 
coach of the Bucs for a fourth time after the 1978 season—this time by 
skipper Chuck Tanner — but ill health forced his resignation a few weeks 
after his appointment. He died in Torrance, California, during spring training 
in March 1979. As a minor league pitcher, Osborn won 199 games, losing
