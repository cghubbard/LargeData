James Hoyt Wilhelm (July 26, 1922[nb 1] – August 23, 2002), nicknamed "Old 
Sarge", was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the New York 
Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago 
White Sox, California Angels, Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, and Los Angeles 
Dodgers between 1952 and 1972. Wilhelm was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame in 1985. Wilhelm grew up in North Carolina, fought in World War 
II, and then spent several years in the minor leagues before starting his 
major league career at the age of 29. He was best known for his knuckleball, 
which enabled him to have great longevity. He appeared occasionally as 
a starting pitcher, but pitched mainly as a reliever. Wilhelm won 124 games, 
still the record for relief pitchers. He was the first pitcher to reach 
200 saves, and the first to appear in 1,000 games. Wilhelm was nearly 30 
years old when he entered the major leagues, and pitched until he was nearly 
50. He retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, 
in baseball history. After retiring as a player in 1972 Wilhelm held longtime 
coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in 
Sarasota, Florida for many years, and died there in 2002. Wilhelm was one 
of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (née Stanley) 
Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina.[1][2] He played baseball at Cornelius 
High School in Cornelius, North Carolina.[3] There, he began experimenting 
with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard.[4] He felt 
that, because he could not throw fast, honing a knuckleball offered him 
his best shot at success.[5] He used a tennis ball to practice.[6] Wilhelm 
made his professional debut with the Mooresville Moors of the Class-D North 
Carolina State League in 1942. He served in the United States Army in the 
European Theater during World War II. Wilhelm participated in the Battle 
of the Bulge, where he was wounded, earning the Purple Heart for his actions.[4][7] 
He played his entire career with a piece of shrapnel lodged in his back 
as a result of this injury.[5] He rose to the rank of staff sergeant. Wilhem 
was nicknamed "Old Sarge" because of his service in the military.[6] He 
returned to the Moors in 1946, following his military service. Over the 
1946 and 1947 seasons, Wilhelm earned 41 wins with Mooresville.[2] He later 
recalled being dropped from a Class D minor league team and having the 
manager tell him to forget about the knuckleball, but he persisted with 
it.[8] The Boston Braves purchased Wilhelm from Mooresville in 1947.[3] 
On November 20, 1947, Wilhelm was drafted by the New York Giants from the 
Braves in the 1947 minor league draft.[3] Wilhelm's first assignment in 
the Giants organization was in Class B with the 1948 Knoxville Smokies, 
for whom he registered 13 wins and 9 losses. He spent a few games that 
season with the Class A Jacksonville Tars of the South Atlantic League. 
Wilhelm returned to Jacksonville in 1949, earning a 17–12 win-loss record 
and a 2.66 earned run average (ERA). With the Class AAA Minneapolis Millers 
in 1950, Wilhelm was the starting pitcher in 25 of his 35 games pitched, 
registering a 15–11 record with a 4.95 ERA. His ERA came down to 3.94 in 
1951 with Minneapolis, but his record finished at 11–14. Wilhelm had been 
used in a similar role that season, mostly starting games but also making 
eleven relief appearances.[3] Though Wilhelm was primarily a starting pitcher 
in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong 
starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year 
before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did not think that Wilhelm's knuckleball 
approach would be effective for more than a few innings at a time. He assigned 
Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.[9] Wilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants 
on April 18, 1952 at age 29, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording 
one out.[10] On April 23, 1952, in his second game with the New York Giants, 
Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover 
of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field 
fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times 
in his career, he never hit another home run.[11] Pitching exclusively 
in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 
15 games and lost three. Wilhelm finished in the top ten in Most Valuable 
Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish 
that high.[12] He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. 
Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased 
to 7–8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts.[3] Wilhelm was named 
to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because 
team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers could 
handle his knuckleball.[13] The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 
1954.[14] In 1954, Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led 
the 1954 Giants to a world championship.[15] He pitched 111 innings, finishing 
with a 12–4 record and a 2.10 ERA.[13] During one of Wilhelm's appearances 
that season, catcher Ray Katt committed four passed balls in one inning 
to set the major league record; the record has subsequently been tied twice.[16] 
When Stan Musial set a record by hitting five home runs in a doubleheader 
that year, Wilhelm was pitching in the second game and gave up two of the 
home runs.[17] The 1954 World Series represented Wilhelm's only career 
postseason play.[3] He pitched 2 1⁄3 innings over two games, earning a 
save in the third game.[18] The team won the World Series in a four-game 
sweep.[15] Wilhelm's ERA increased to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings 
pitched in 1955, but he managed a 4–1 record. He finished the 1956 season 
with a 4–9 record and a 3.83 ERA in 89 1⁄3 innings.[3] Sportswriter Bob 
Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the 
decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball 
was "a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right 
direction."[19] On February 26, 1957, Wilhelm was traded by the Giants 
to the St. Louis Cardinals for Whitey Lockman.[3] At the time of the trade, 
St. Louis manager Fred Hutchinson described Wilhelm as the type of pitcher 
who "makes us a definite pennant threat... He'll help us where we need 
help the most."[20] In 40 games with the Cardinals that season, he earned 
11 saves but finished with a 1–4 record and his highest ERA to that point 
in his career (4.25). The Cardinals placed him on waivers in September 
and he was claimed by the Cleveland Indians, who used him in two games 
that year.[3] In 1958, Cleveland manager Bobby Bragan used Wilhelm occasionally 
as a starter. Although he had a 2.49 ERA, none of the Indians' catchers 
could handle Wilhelm's knuckleball. General manager Frank Lane, alarmed 
at the large number of passed balls, allowed the Baltimore Orioles to select 
Wilhelm off waivers on August 23, 1958.[3] In Baltimore, Wilhelm lived 
near the home of third baseman Brooks Robinson and their families became 
close friends.[4] On September 20 of that year, Wilhelm no-hit the eventual 
World Champion New York Yankees 1-0 at Memorial Stadium, in only his ninth 
career start.[4][21] He allowed two baserunners on walks and struck out 
eight.[22] The no-hitter had been threatened at one point in the ninth 
inning when Hank Bauer bunted along the baseline, but Robinson allowed 
the ball to roll and it veered foul.[23] The no-hitter was the first in 
the franchise's Baltimore history; the Orioles had moved from St. Louis 
after the 1953 season. Orioles catchers had difficulty catching the Wilhelm 
knuckleball again in 1959 and they set an MLB record with 49 passed balls.[4] 
During one April game, catcher Gus Triandos had four passed balls while 
catching for Wilhelm and he described the game as "the roughest day I ever 
put in during my life."[24] Author Bill James has written that Wilhelm 
and Triandos "established the principle that a knuckleball pitcher and 
a big, slow catcher make an awful combination."[25] Triandos once said, 
"Heaven is a place where no one throws a knuckleball."[25] Despite the 
passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA title with a 2.19 ERA.[3] 
During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger 
mitt so his catchers could handle the knuckleball.[26][27] Richards was 
well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By the middle of 
the season, he said that eight of his pitchers could serve as starters.[28] 
Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 
record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following 
year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.[3] 
In 1962, Wilhelm had his fourth All-Star season, finishing with a 7–10 
record, a 1.94 ERA and 15 saves. On January 14, 1963, Wilhelm was traded 
by the Orioles with Ron Hansen, Dave Nicholson and Pete Ward to the Chicago 
White Sox for Luis Aparicio and Al Smith.[3] Early in that season, White 
Sox manager Al López said that Wilhelm had improved his pitching staff 
by 40 percent. He said that Wilhelm was "worth more than a 20-game winner, 
and he works with so little effort that he probably can last as long as 
Satchel Paige."[29] He registered 21 saves and a 2.64 ERA.[3] In 1964, 
Wilhelm finished with career highs in both saves (27) and games pitched 
(73). His ERA decreased to 1.99 that season; it remained less than 2.00 
through the 1968 season. In 1965, Wilhelm contributed to another passed 
balls record when Chicago catcher J. C. Martin allowed 33 of them in one 
season. That total set a modern single-season baseball record for the category.[30] 
Wilhelm's career-low ERA (1.31) came in 1967, when he earned an 8–3 record 
for the White Sox with 12 saves.[3] In the 1968 season, Wilhelm was getting 
close to breaking the all-time games pitched record belonging to Cy Young 
(906 games). Chicago manager Eddie Stanky began to think about using Wilhelm 
as a starting pitcher for game number 907. However, the White Sox fired 
Stanky before the record came up. Wilhelm later broke the record as a relief 
pitcher. He also set MLB records for consecutive errorless games by a pitcher, 
career victories in relief, games finished and innings pitched in relief.[31] 
Despite Wilhelm's success, the White Sox, who had won at least 83 games 
per season in the 1960s, performed poorly. They finished 1968 with a 67–95 
record.[32] Wilhelm was noted during this period for his mentoring of relief 
pitcher Wilbur Wood, who came to the 1967 White Sox in a trade. Wood sometimes 
threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged 
him to throw it full-time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and 
earned a 1.87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, 
as the White Sox coaches did not know much about how to throw it. Between 
1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games (241) than any other pitcher 
and more innings ( 400 1⁄3) than any other relief pitcher.[33] After the 
1968 season, MLB expanded and an expansion draft was conducted in which 
the new teams could select certain players from the established teams. 
The White Sox left Wilhelm unprotected, possibly because they did not believe 
that teams would have interest in a much older pitcher.[1] On October 15, 
1968, Wilhelm was chosen in the expansion draft by the Kansas City Royals 
as the 49th pick. That offseason, he was traded by the Royals to the California 
Angels for Ed Kirkpatrick and Dennis Paepke.[3] In 44 games pitched for 
the 1969 California Angels, Wilhelm had a 2.47 ERA, ten saves and a 5–7 
record. On September 8, 1969, Wilhelm was traded by the Angels with Bob 
Priddy to the Atlanta Braves for Clint Compton and Mickey Rivers. He finished 
the 1969 season by pitching eight games for the Braves, earning four saves 
and recording a 0.73 ERA over 12 1⁄3 innings pitched. Wilhelm spent most 
of the 1970 season with the Braves, pitching in 50 games for the team and 
earning ten saves.[3] On September 21, 1970, Wilhelm was selected off waivers 
by the Chicago Cubs, for whom he appeared in three games.[3] He was traded 
back by the Cubs to the Braves for Hal Breeden after the season.[3] As 
the Cubs acquired Wilhelm late in the season to bolster their playoff contention, 
which was a source of controversy, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn investigated 
the transaction.[34] In December, Kuhn ruled that he did not find evidence 
of impropriety associated with the transactions that sent Wilhelm to the 
Cubs and quickly back to the Braves.[35] Wilhelm was released by the Braves 
on June 29, 1971, having pitched in three games for that year's Braves. 
He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 10, 1971. He appeared in 
nine MLB games for the Dodgers, giving up two earned runs in 17 2⁄3 innings.[3] 
He also pitched in eight games that season for the team's Class AAA minor 
league affiliate, the Spokane Indians. He started six of those games and 
registered a 3.89 ERA.[36] He pitched in 16 games for the Dodgers in 1972, 
registering a 4.62 ERA over 25 innings. The Dodgers released him on July 
21, 1972. He never appeared in another game.[3] At the time of his retirement, 
Wilhelm had pitched in a then-MLB record 1,070 games.[4] He is recognized 
as the first pitcher to have saved 200 games in his career, and the first 
pitcher to appear in 1,000 games. He is also one of the oldest players 
to have pitched in the major leagues; his final appearance was 16 days 
short of his 50th birthday. Wilhelm retired with the lowest career earned 
run average of any major league hurler after 1927 (Walter Johnson) who 
pitched more than 2,000 innings. After his retirement as a player, Wilhelm 
managed two minor league teams in the Atlanta Braves system for single 
seasons. He led the 1973 Greenwood Braves of the Western Carolinas League 
to a 61–66 record, then had a 33–33 record with the 1975 Kingsport Braves 
of the Appalachian League.[36] He also worked as a minor league pitching 
coach for the New York Yankees for 22 years.[4] As a coach, Wilhelm said 
that he did not teach pitchers the knuckleball, believing that people had 
to be born with a knack for throwing it.[8] He sometimes worked individually 
with major league players who wanted to improve their knuckleballs, including 
Joe Niekro.[37] The Yankees gave Wilhelm permission to work with Mickey 
Lolich in 1979 even though Lolich pitched for the San Diego Padres.[38] 
Wilhelm was on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame for eight years 
before he was elected.[39] After Wilhelm failed to garner enough votes 
for induction in 1983, sportswriter Jim Murray criticized the voters, saying 
that while Wilhelm never had the look of a baseball player, he was "the 
best player in history at what he does."[30] He fell short by 13 votes 
in 1984.[40] Wilhelm was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. 
At his induction ceremony, he said that he had achieved all three of his 
initial major league goals: appearing in a World Series, being named to 
an All-Star team, and throwing a no-hitter.[8] He and his wife Peggy lived 
in Sarasota, Florida. They raised three children together: Patti, Pam, 
and Jim. Wilhelm died of heart failure in a Sarasota nursing home in 2002.[6] 
"[Hoyt] had the best knuckleball you'd ever want to see. He knew where 
it was going when he threw it, but when he got two strikes on you, he'd 
break out one that even he didn't know where it was going." Wilhelm was 
known as a "relief ace" and his teams used him in a new way that became 
a trend. Rather than bringing in a relief pitcher only when the starting 
pitcher had begun to struggle, teams increasingly called upon their relief 
pitchers toward the end of any close game.[41] Wilhelm was the first relief 
pitcher elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.[4] He is also remembered 
as one of the most successful and "probably the most famous 'old' player 
in history."[1] Although, due largely to his military service, he did not 
debut in the major leagues until he was already 29 years old, Wilhelm nonetheless 
managed to appear in 21 major league seasons. He earned the nickname "Old 
Folks" while he still had more than a decade left in his playing career.[1] 
He was the oldest player in Major League Baseball for each of his final 
seven seasons.[5] Former teammate Moose Skowron commented on Wilhelm's 
key pitch, saying, "Hoyt was a good guy, and he threw the best knuckleball 
I ever saw. You never knew what Hoyt's pitch would do. I don't think he 
did either."[8] Baseball executive Roland Hemond agreed, saying, "Wilhelm's 
knuckleball did more than anyone else's... There was so much action on 
it."[8] Before Wilhelm, the knuckleball was primarily mixed in to older 
pitchers' repertoires at the end of their careers to offset their slowing 
fastballs and reduce stress on their arms, thereby extending their careers. 
Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager 
and on nearly every pitch.[1] The New York Times linked his knuckleball 
with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie 
Hough the knuckleball in 1971 and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching
