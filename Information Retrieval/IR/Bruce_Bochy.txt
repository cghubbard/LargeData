As player As manager Bruce Douglas Bochy (/ˈboʊtʃi/; born April 16, 1955) 
is the manager of the San Francisco Giants. Prior to joining the Giants 
for the 2007 season, Bochy was the manager of the San Diego Padres for 
twelve seasons. He has led the Giants to three World Series Championships, 
and also led the Padres to one World Series appearance during his tenure 
in San Diego. Bochy is the only former Padres player to serve as the team's 
manager. He has participated in all five postseason appearances in Padres 
history, as a backup catcher in 1984 and as their manager in 1996, 1998, 
2005, and 2006. In 1998, he led the Padres to their first National League 
pennant in 14 years; they lost the 1998 World Series to the New York Yankees. 
He reached the World Series for a second time as a manager in 2010 with 
the Giants, this time in a winning effort over the Texas Rangers, and brought 
the first ever World Series Championship home to the city of San Francisco. 
It was the first for the Giants franchise since 1954. Bochy returned to 
the World Series for the third time in 2012, also with the Giants, who 
won over the Detroit Tigers in a 4-game sweep. He reached the World Series 
a fourth time in 2014, and managed his third World Championship in 5 years, 
this time leading the Giants over the Kansas City Royals in seven games. 
Bochy is both the first foreign-born manager to reach the World Series 
(1998) and the first European-born manager to win the World Series (2010). 
On July 23, 2013, he became the 21st manager with 1,500 wins. Bochy is 
one of just eight Major Leaguers to be born in France (in Bussac-Forêt, 
Charente-Maritime), where his father, Sgt. Major Gus Bochy, was stationed 
as a U.S. Army NCO at the time.[1] Growing up, the Bochy family moved to 
the Panama Canal Zone, South Carolina, northern Virginia, and ultimately 
Melbourne, Florida.[2] Bochy graduated from Melbourne High School, where 
he was a baseball teammate of Darrell Hammond of Saturday Night Live fame.[3] 
He attended Brevard Community College (later known as Eastern Florida State 
College) for two years, winning a state championship in 1975,[4] before 
committing to play baseball for Eddie Stanky at South Alabama,[1] but he 
decided to turn pro when he was drafted in the first round (24th overall) 
by the Houston Astros in the 1975 Supplemental Draft.[5] As a catcher, 
Bochy played with the Houston Astros (1978–80), New York Mets (1982) and 
San Diego Padres (1983–87). In 802 career at-bats, he hit .239 with 26 
home runs. With the Astros, he primarily backed up Alan Ashby.[6] Bochy 
was traded to the Mets on February 11, 1981, for two minor leaguers.[7] 
Two years later, he was released by the Mets and signed with the Padres 
as a free agent.[8] With the Padres, he was the backup to Terry Kennedy 
from 1983–86 and rookie catcher Benito Santiago in 1987.[9] In 1988, Bochy 
spent his final season playing in Triple-A Las Vegas where he served as 
a player-coach, batting .231 in 53 games.[10] With the Astros, Bochy was 
behind the plate in Game 4 of the 1980 NLCS versus the Philadelphia Phillies 
when Pete Rose ran over Bochy to score the go-ahead run in the top of the 
tenth inning.[6] Bochy was the backup to Terry Kennedy when the Padres 
won their first NL pennant in 1984, and he played in one game in the 1984 
World Series, which the Padres lost in five games to the Detroit Tigers. 
On July 1, 1985, Bochy hit a tenth-inning walk-off home run off Nolan Ryan 
of the Houston Astros, the only walk-off home run allowed in Ryan's career.[7][11] 
Bochy was behind the plate on September 11, 1985, when Pete Rose, now with 
the Cincinnati Reds, collected his record-breaking 4,192nd major league 
hit off Padres pitcher Eric Show.[12] After retiring as a player, Bochy 
was hired by Padres general manager Jack McKeon to manage in their minor 
league system.[10] He started the 1989 season assisting the Class-A Riverside 
Red Wave before leaving to manage the Short-Season Class-A Spokane Indians, 
leading them to their third consecutive championship.[10] In 1990, Bochy 
took over as manager of the Red Wave, finishing with a 64–78 record.[13] 
In 1991, Bochy followed the team to Adelanto, California, where they became 
the High Desert Mavericks, and led them to a 73–63 record and California 
League title.[13] In 1992, Bochy was promoted to manager of the Double-A 
Wichita Wranglers, leading them to the Texas League title that year.[14] 
After four years of managing for their minor league teams, the San Diego 
Padres picked Bochy to be the team's third-base coach under new manager 
Jim Riggleman in 1993.[15] Following the departure of Riggleman after the 
1994 season, the Padres named Bochy as their new manager for the 1995 season.[16] 
At age 39, Bochy became the youngest manager in the National League and 
helped the Padres improve from 47–70 in 1994 to 70–74 in his rookie year.[17] 
In 1996, his second season, Bochy led the Padres to a 91–71 record and 
their second National League West division title in franchise history,[17] 
earning Bochy NL Manager of the Year honors.[18] In 1998, Bochy led the 
Padres to a franchise-best 98–64 record and the second National League 
pennant in Padres history.[19] The Padres were swept in four games in the 
1998 World Series by the New York Yankees. After the World Series, the 
Padres dramatically cut payroll and suffered five straight losing seasons.[20] 
In 2005 and 2006, Bochy led the Padres to consecutive NL West titles for 
the first time in franchise history, but they lost to the St. Louis Cardinals 
in the Division Series each year.[21] After the 2006 season, new Padres 
CEO Sandy Alderson preferred to have a younger manager, so he allowed Giants 
General Manager Brian Sabean to interview Bochy for his job opening.[22] 
Bochy left the Padres for the Giants after the 2006 season.[23] He finished 
his Padres career with a regular season record of 951–975 and a post–season 
record of 8–16.[24] Bochy has the most games managed in Padres history 
and with that, the most wins and losses. In 12 seasons under Bochy, the 
Padres had five winning seasons and won four NL West titles and one NL 
pennant. While with the Padres, Bochy also managed the 2004 and 2006 MLB 
All-Stars in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series. With the 
San Diego padres, he finished with a record of 951 wins and 975 losses.[24] 
Bochy agreed to a three-year contract to replace Felipe Alou and become 
the Giants' new skipper on October 27, 2006.[19] After two seasons of 90+ 
losses in 2007 and 2008, the Giants rebounded to finish 88–74 in 2009, 
and remained in the playoff race into September behind a pitching staff 
with the second-lowest ERA in the majors.[25] After the season, Bochy received 
a new two-year contract with an option for 2012.[25] In 2010, the Giants 
finished 92–70 and clinched their first NL West title since 2003 on the 
final day of the regular season against the Padres.[26] Underdogs throughout 
the postseason, Bochy's "bunch of castoffs and misfits" defeated the Atlanta 
Braves in the 2010 NLDS and the reigning National League champion Philadelphia 
Phillies in the NLCS.[27][28] The Giants defeated the Texas Rangers in 
five games in the 2010 World Series, bringing the first World Series Championship 
to San Francisco and the Giants' first title since 1954 when the team was 
based in New York City.[29][30] Following the season, the Giants exercised 
Bochy's 2012 contract option.[30] In 2011, the Giants finished 86–76 and 
missed the playoffs.[31] After the season, the Giants extended Bochy's 
contract through 2013, with an option for 2014.[32] In 2012, the Giants 
clinched the NL West for the second time in three years against the Padres, 
finishing with a 94–68 record.[33] In the postseason, the Giants fell behind 
the Cincinnati Reds 0–2 in the 2012 NLDS before winning three straight 
games to stave off elimination.[34] In the NLCS, the Giants fell behind 
the St. Louis Cardinals three games to one, but again won three straight 
elimination games to clinch their second National League pennant in three 
seasons.[35] The Giants swept the 2012 World Series against the Detroit 
Tigers in four games.[36] After the season, Bochy said the tagline for 
2012 was "never say die".[37] Before the 2013 season, the Giants extended 
Bochy's contract through 2016.[38] Bochy became the 21st manager with 1,500 
wins on July 23, 2013.[39] The Giants finished the season 76–86 and missed 
the playoffs in 2013.[40] When Jim Leyland retired after the 2013 season, 
Bochy became MLB's active leader in wins with 1,530.[41] In 2014, Bochy 
became the 19th manager to reach 1,600 wins on August 27,[42] and also 
became the all-time NL Western Division leader in managerial wins, passing 
Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda for that distinction, since the 
installment of division play in 1969.[43] With an 88–74 record, the Giants 
made the 2014 postseason as the second wild-card team. During a low point 
of the regular season, Bochy told his players they had "champion blood", 
referring to the Giants' 2010 and 2012 championships.[44] After defeating 
the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL Wild Card Game, the Giants beat the heavily-favored[45] 
Washington Nationals three games to one in the NLDS and the St. Louis Cardinals 
four games to one in the NLCS for their third NL pennant in five years.[46][47] 
Bochy's "group of warriors" went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals to 
win the 2014 World Series, a series that went the full seven games.[48][49] 
Bochy became the tenth manager in MLB history to win three championships, 
with the previous nine all inducted into the Hall of Fame.[note 1][50][51][52][53][54] 
However, some experts believe Bochy's postseason success is merely coincidental 
considering his lack of consistent regular-season success with a high-payroll 
team.[55] On April 3, 2015, the Giants announced Bochy had signed a contract 
extension through the 2019 season.[56] On June 10, 2015, Bochy recorded 
his 700th win as Giants manager, making him the fourth in history to win 
at least 700 games for two different teams, joining Sparky Anderson, Tony 
La Russa, and Jim Leyland.[57] The milestone came on the same night that 
Chris Heston threw a no-hitter for the Giants, the fifth no-hitter by the 
Giants under Bochy (Jonathan Sánchez in 2009; Matt Cain's perfect game 
in 2012; and Tim Lincecum in 2013 and 2014).[58][59] On September 27, 2015, 
Bochy became the 16th manager to record 1,700 wins. The Giants finished 
with an 84–78 record and missed the playoffs in 2015.[60] On June 26, 2016, 
Bochy recorded his 800th win as Giants manager.[61] On June 30, Bochy became 
the first manager since 1976 to intentionally forfeit the designated hitter, 
allowing Madison Bumgarner to bat for himself against the Oakland Athletics.[62][63] 
With an 87–75 record, the Giants made the 2016 postseason as the second 
wild-card team, clinching on the final day of the regular season.[64] On 
October 6, 2016, the Giants won the 2016 National League Wild Card 3-0 
against the New York Mets. Madison Bumgarner pitched a complete game shutout, 
allowing only 4 hits and 6 strikeouts. Conor Gillaspie hit a go-ahead 3-run 
homer in top of the 9th inning, and Bumgarner closed the game out in the 
bottom of the 9th for the win. Eventually, the Giants would lose the National 
League Division Series in four games to the Chicago Cubs.[65] Bochy is 
the third of four children.[1] His older brother Joe was a onetime catcher 
in the Minnesota Twins system and later worked as a professional scout 
for the Padres and Giants.[66] Bochy met his wife, Kim Seib, while at Brevard 
Community College in 1975 and they married in 1978.[1] They reside in Poway, 
California and have two sons, Greg and Brett.[67] Greg Bochy spent several 
seasons playing minor league baseball in the San Diego Padres system. Bochy’s 
younger son, Brett Bochy, was drafted by the Giants in 2010.[68] Brett 
was called up to the majors on September 2, 2014, making Bruce the seventh 
manager in MLB history to manage his own son. On September 13, 2014, Bruce 
became the first manager to give the ball to his son coming out of the 
bullpen.[69] Bochy is known for having one of the largest cap sizes in 
Major League Baseball.[1] With Houston, his nickname was "Headly," due 
to his unusually large head, with a hat size measurement of 8 1⁄8.[70] 
When he joined the Mets in 1982, they did not have a helmet that would 
fit him, and they had to send for the ones he was using in the minors.[71] 
On February 19, 2015, Bochy underwent angioplasty to have two stents inserted 
in a blood vessel that was 90 percent blocked.[72] In May 2011, Bochy won 
the Ronald L. Jensen Award for Lifetime Achievement, which he accepted 
at Positive Coaching Alliance's National Youth Sports Awards.[73] In 2011, 
the baseball field at Brevard Community College was named Bruce Bochy Field 
in his honor.[74] In 2015, Bochy released A Book of Walks (ISBN 978-0985419035), 
describing his favorite walks around San Francisco and other major league 
cities.[75] Bochy has rated Johnny Bench as the first choice on "His Top 
Five Catchers, All-Time" list, with the following in descending order:
