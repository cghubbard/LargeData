James Alexander Ferguson (February 16, 1897 – April 26, 1976) was a pitcher 
in Major League Baseball who played for five different teams between 1918 
and 1929. Listed at 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 180 lb., Ferguson batted and threw 
right-handed. He was born in Montclair, New Jersey and died in Sepulveda, 
California, at age 79. Ferguson was one of the first forkball specialists 
in major league history. He entered the majors in 1918 with the New York 
Yankees, playing for them two years (1918, 1921) before joining the Boston 
Red Sox (1922–1925), Washington Senators (1925–1926), again the Yankees 
(1925), and with the Philadelphia Phillies (1927–1929) and Brooklyn Robins 
(1925). He enjoyed his highest win season in 1924 with the seventh-place 
Red Sox, when he won 14 games while losing an American League-high 17. 
In 1925 he divided his playing time with Boston, New York and Washington, 
ending with a 5–1 mark and a 3.25 ERA in seven games for the Senators AL 
champion team. During the World Series, he pitched well against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, going 1–1 with a 3.21 ERA in two starts. In a 10-season career, 
Ferguson posted a 61–85 record with 397 strikeouts and a 4.89 ERA in 257 
appearances, including 166 starts, 62 complete games, two shutouts, 10 
saves, and 1241⅔ innings of work. In 1926 Ferguson set a major league record 
for the highest ERA during a regular season by a pitcher who started a 
postseason game the same year. Ferguson collected a combined 6.18 ERA while 
pitching with the Red Sox, Yankees and Senators. The mark was broken in 
2006 by Óliver Pérez of the New York Mets, who posted a 6.55 ERA during 
the regular season before starting Game 4 of the NL Championship Series.
