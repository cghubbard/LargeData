There have been a total of six managers in the history of the Arizona Diamondbacks 
Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise of the National League. The Diamondbacks 
franchise was formed in the 1998 Major League Baseball season as a member 
of the National League.[1] Buck Showalter was hired as the first Diamondbacks 
manager. Showalter served for three (1998-2000) seasons before being replaced 
after the 2000 season. In terms of tenure, Bob Melvin has managed more 
games and seasons than any other coach in the Diamondbacks franchise history. 
He has managed the Diamondbacks to one playoff berth, in 2007, in which 
he led the team to the National League Championship Series (NLCS).[2][3] 
Al Pedrique and A.J. Hinch are the only two managers in the Diamondbacks 
history to not lead a team into the playoffs. In the 2000 baseball season, 
the Diamondbacks decided to release Buck Showalter, soon then to be replaced 
by manager Bob Brenly. The following year, Brenly led the Diamondbacks 
to win the 2001 World Series.[4] However, after a poor 2003 and start of 
the 2004 season, Brenly was also released and was replaced with Al Pedrique[5] 
, the third base coach for the Diamondbacks at the time. At the end of 
that season, the Diamondbacks originally hired Wally Backman as their new 
manager for the team. Though, after allegations of Backman driving under 
the influence, the Diamondbacks decided to instead hire Bob Melvin as their 
new manager instead of hiring Backman.[6] Melvin, the former Mariners manager, 
led the Diamondbacks since the 2005 season of baseball. Prior to the May 
8, 2009 game the Diamondbacks replaced Melvin with A.J. Hinch.[7] Statistics 
are accurate through the 2009 MLB season. Wally Backman was hired as the 
Diamondbacks manager on 11/1/2004, but was fired four days later on 11/5/2004,
