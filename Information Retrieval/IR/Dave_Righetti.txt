As player: As coach: David Allan Righetti (born November 28, 1958) is an 
American professional baseball coach and former player. A left-handed pitcher, 
Righetti played in Major League Baseball from 1979 through 1995 for the 
New York Yankees, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Toronto Blue 
Jays, and Chicago White Sox. He has served as the pitching coach for the 
Giants since 2000. His nickname is "Rags". Righetti began his career as 
a starting pitcher, but the Yankees converted him into a relief pitcher, 
using him as their closer, in 1984. He won the American League (AL) Rookie 
of the Year Award in 1981. As a starter, he threw a no-hitter on July 4, 
1983. As a closer, he was twice named the AL Rolaids Relief Man of the 
Year and pitched in two MLB All-Star Games. He was the first player in 
history to both pitch a no-hitter and also lead the league in saves in 
his career. Dennis Eckersley later duplicated the feat, as did Derek Lowe. 
Righetti was born in San Jose, California. His father, Leo, was a professional 
baseball player. His brother, Steve, is thirteen months older than Dave. 
Leo trained his sons to become baseball players. Dave and Steve starred 
for their Lincoln Glen Little League team, Letterman, with Dave playing 
in the outfield and Steve playing shortstop.[1] Righetti attended Pioneer 
High School. Paddy Cottrell, a scout for the Texas Rangers of Major League 
Baseball, noticed Righetti and suggested he become a pitcher due to his 
throwing motion. As a senior, he was named to the All-League team.[2] Righetti 
enrolled in San Jose City College, where he continued his development as 
a pitcher on the school's baseball team.[1] He was named the junior college 
player of the year, beating out teammate Dave Stieb.[2] At Cottrell's urging, 
the Rangers selected Righetti on January 11, 1977, in the first round (10th 
overall pick) of the amateur draft. The Rangers selected Steve in the sixth 
round, and told Dave that they would only sign Steve if he signed. Both 
Righetti brothers signed with the Rangers.[1] Dave made his professional 
debut that year in minor league baseball with the Asheville Tourists of 
the Class A Western Carolinas League, where he pitched to an 11–3 win–loss 
record.[3] In 1978, Righetti pitched for the Tulsa Drillers of the Class 
AA Texas League. In a July game against the Midland RockHounds, Righetti 
recorded a league-record 21 strikeouts.[4] Jerry Walker, a scout for the 
New York Yankees, was present in the stands. Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, 
while negotiating a trade with Rangers owner Brad Corbett that offseason, 
specifically waited until late in their negotiations to ask that Righetti 
be added to the trade.[1] On November 10, 1978, the Yankees acquired Righetti, 
along with Juan Beníquez, Mike Griffin, Greg Jemison, and Paul Mirabella, 
while the Rangers acquired Sparky Lyle, Domingo Ramos, Mike Heath, Larry 
McCall, Dave Rajsich, and cash. The Yankees introduced Righetti as "the 
next Ron Guidry".[5] Righetti was almost traded to the Minnesota Twins 
in January 1979; the Twins and Yankees were unable to complete a deal in 
which Righetti, Chris Chambliss, Juan Beníquez, and Dámaso García would 
have moved to Minnesota in exchange for Rod Carew.[6] Righetti made his 
major league debut with the Yankees on September 16, 1979, wearing uniform 
number 56. In this game against the Detroit Tigers he pitched five innings, 
striking out three and allowing three hits, six walks, and three earned 
runs. After Righetti made his second start, Yankees' manager Billy Martin 
declared that Righetti "will win 20 games next season".[5] However, Righetti 
struggled with his control, and spent the 1980 season with the Columbus 
Clippers of the Class AAA International League, where he had a 6–10 win-loss 
record and a 4.63 ERA with 101 walks and 139 strikeouts in 142 innings.[7] 
Though Righetti pitched well in spring training in 1981, the Yankees did 
not have room for him on their roster, so he began the season with Columbus. 
After he pitched to a 5–0 record and 1.00 ERA with 50 strikeouts in 45 
innings, the Yankees recalled Righetti from Columbus in May 1981.[7][8] 
He was assigned uniform number 19. The Yankees reserved numbers ending 
in 9 for pitchers they viewed as having promise: Dick Tidrow wore 19 for 
the Yankees, while Catfish Hunter wore 29, Ron Davis wore 39, and Guidry 
wore 49.[9] Righetti pitched strongly as a starter for the Yankees, posting 
an 8–4 win-loss record in 15 games started, with a 2.06 earned run average 
(ERA) and 89 strikeouts in 105 innings pitched during the 1981 season.[5] 
Righetti won the American League's Rookie of the Year award, beating Rich 
Gedman and Bob Ojeda.[8] Righetti defeated the Milwaukee Brewers twice 
during the 1981 American League Division Series.[2] The Yankees reached 
the World Series that year; however, he was knocked out of game three of 
the 1981 World Series early, which was won by the Los Angeles Dodgers.[8] 
In 1982, Righetti pitched to an 8.53 ERA during spring training. Steinbrenner 
sought to demote Righetti to the minor leagues, but stated he "got outvoted 
then". Through June 1982, Righetti had pitched to a 5–5 win-loss record 
with a 4.23 ERA. Though his 77 strikeouts were fourth-best in the American 
League, his 62 walks were considered a problem. The Yankees demoted Righetti 
to the minor leagues, for what Steinbrenner termed a " 2 1⁄2-week intensive 
brushing up".[10] Sammy Ellis, Righetti's pitching coach with Columbus, 
said that Righetti had been rushing his pitching motion, which was likely 
due to anxiety.[11] Working with Ellis, Righetti made four starts for the 
Clippers, recording 33 strikeouts in 26 innings, before he was recalled 
to New York. Righetti finished the 1982 season with 11 wins in 27 starts, 
with a 3.79 ERA and 162 strikeouts and 108 walks. His strikeouts were third-best 
in the AL, while his walks led the league.[5] On July 4, 1983, Righetti 
threw a no-hitter against the Boston Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. It was 
the first Yankee no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 
World Series, and the first by a Yankee left-hander since 1917. It was 
also the first time ever a no-hitter occurred during a Yankees-Red Sox 
rivalry game. Righetti recorded a swinging strikeout against Wade Boggs 
to end the game. Twenty-five years later, Righetti reminisced about the 
game: "My biggest worry, because I had a tendency to fall toward third 
base, was him (Boggs) tapping a ball between me and Mattingly and me trying 
to get to first base...I threw a lot of fastballs during the at bat, but 
the last slider I ended up throwing, he happened to miss it. Thank goodness."[12] 
In 1984 Righetti was moved to the Yankees' bullpen to replace Rich Gossage, 
who signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason, as their closer. 
Despite the move being due to the Yankees having an excess of starters, 
many criticized the decision, arguing that Righetti was more valuable pitching 
as a starter, where he would accrue more innings.[2] Entering his first 
game as a relief pitcher with the bases loaded, Righetti did not allow 
an inherited runner to score, retiring the final seven batters of the game.[13] 
He proved even more effective in relief, averaging 32 saves per season 
over the next seven years with the Yankees, and being named an All-Star 
in 1986 and 1987. On October 4, 1986, he saved both games of a doubleheader 
against the Boston Red Sox, finishing the season with 46 saves, and breaking 
the major league record shared by Dan Quisenberry and Bruce Sutter. The 
record would stand until Bobby Thigpen saved 57 games for the Chicago White 
Sox in 1990.[14] Righetti retained the single-season record for left-handers 
until 1993, when Randy Myers saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs; Righetti 
still owns the AL record for left-handers. Righetti became a free agent 
after the 1987 season. Amid rumors that Righetti would sign a three-year 
contract worth $20 million with the Tokyo Giants of Nippon Professional 
Baseball, Righetti's agent acknowledged that the Giants did make Righetti 
an offer, but stated that the value was considerably less than what was 
reported, and stated that Righetti would continue to pitch in MLB.[15] 
The contract offer was later estimated at $10 million. Righetti chose to 
re-sign with the Yankees, signing a three-year contract worth $4.5 million.[16] 
Righetti struggled with the Yankees early in the 1988 season, blowing four 
consecutive save opportunities, resulting in boos from the Yankee Stadium 
crowds. He then recorded five saves in consecutive opportunities.[17] Righetti 
became concerned with the direction the Yankees were taking, as they had 
traded away Rickey Henderson, Jack Clark, and Dave Winfield. After the 
1990 season, Righetti signed as a free agent with the San Francisco Giants, 
receiving a four-year contract worth $10 million.[18] While with the Giants 
in 1991, he broke Lyle's major league record for left-handers of 238 career 
saves; Righetti's record would stand until 1994, when John Franco surpassed 
his eventual total of 252. Righetti saved only 24 games in 1991, and the 
following two years saw him ineffective in middle relief roles; his career 
as a closer was over. Righetti made a start on June 10, 1992, his first 
start since September 1983.[19] Released by the Giants after the 1993 season, 
he crossed the Bay to sign as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics. 
After beginning 1994 with the Athletics, he was released, and signed as 
a free agent with the Toronto Blue Jays in May 1994,[20] playing for the 
Jays wearing number 24. Righetti had a 0–1 win-loss record and 6.75 ERA 
for the Blue Jays.[21] After that season he was released by the Blue Jays,[21] 
and in spring 1995 he signed as a free agent with the Chicago White Sox, 
wearing number 45 with the team. On November 9, 1995, he was again granted 
free agency; but no team signed him, and Righetti retired to end his 16-year 
career, finishing with 252 saves, a 3.46 ERA, and a record of 82–79 in 
718 games. Since 2000, Righetti has been the pitching coach for the Giants. 
Despite uncertainty if he would return to the Giants for the 2007 season 
due to a managerial change, Righetti announced in early November 2007 that 
he would remain with the Giants in his present role.[22] He was the pitching 
coach for the pitching staff that included Matt Cain, Madison Bumgarner, 
Tim Lincecum, Jonathan Sánchez, and Brian Wilson that won the 2010, 2012, 
and 2014 World Series. An analysis by Fangraphs showed that Righetti has 
an uncanny knack for teaching pitchers to not give up home runs.[23] He 
and his wife had triplets (two daughters and one son), who were born in
