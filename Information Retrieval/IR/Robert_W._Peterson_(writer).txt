Robert W. Peterson (1925 Warren, Pennsylvania –February 11, 2006) was an 
American newspaper writer who later became a freelance author of magazine 
articles and books, especially on the topics of sports and Scouting. His 
1970 chronicle of Negro league baseball entitled Only the Ball Was White 
was hailed by The New York Times as having "recaptured a lost era in baseball 
history and a rich facet of black life in America".[1] The baseball commissioner 
at the time, Bowie Kuhn, later credited Peterson's book with having "focused 
greater attention on the accomplishments of Negro League players", leading 
to their admission to the Baseball Hall of Fame.[1] He was raised in Warren, 
Pennsylvania, Peterson played baseball while attending Upsala College. 
He was a writer and editor with the old New York World-Telegram newspaper, 
which folded in 1966. Peterson died of lung cancer on February 11, 2006, 
in Salisbury, Pennsylvania, survived by his wife Peggy and a son and daughter. 
At the time of his death, he was on a committee selecting Negro league 
players for the Hall of Fame.[1] Peterson's book, The Boy Scouts: An American 
Adventure, was written in 1984 on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the 
Boy Scouts of America (BSA).[2] In it, he discusses the history of Scouting's 
various programs, such as the founding of the Order of the Arrow by E. 
Urner Goodman, and the influence Ernest Thompson Seton's successful use 
of American Indian culture in his Woodcraft Indians program had on Scouting's 
early development, particularly the Order of the Arrow.[3] Peterson also 
wrote numerous articles for Scouting magazine in the 1970s–1990s, such 
as a tribute to William Hillcourt in 1985, acclaiming the influential BSA 
leader as "the foremost influence on development of the Boy Scouting program".[4] 
He subsequently wrote another article for Scouter magazine about Hillcourt 
in 2001.[5] Among the articles Peterson penned for the BSA's Scouting magazine 
was an account of Scouting activities in the Japanese-American internment
