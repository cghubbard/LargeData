The St. Louis Cardinals are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based 
in St. Louis, Missouri. They play in the National League Central division. 
The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening 
Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often 
given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season,[1] 
though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might 
not start on Opening Day.[2] As of 2008, The Cardinals have used 71 different 
Opening Day starting pitchers in their 128 seasons. Since the franchise's 
beginning in 1882, the starters have a combined Opening Day record of 70 
wins, 57 losses (70–57), and 22 no decisions. No decisions are only awarded 
to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher 
has left the game. Although in modern baseball, ties are rare due to extra 
innings. Bob Gibson holds the Cardinals record for most Opening Day starts
