The Dapper Dan Charities were founded by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette editor 
Al Abrams in 1936. It is one of the oldest non-profit and fundraising community 
sports club in the world, and the oldest in Western Pennsylvania. The foundations 
fundraises for its charities primarily through the annual "Dapper Dan Banquet". 
Started in 1936 the first few banquets honored such regional figures as 
Art Rooney, Jock Sutherland and John Harris. In 1939 the banquet began 
an annual tradition of naming the region's "Sportsman of the Year" and 
in 1999 the "Sportswoman of the Year". In recent decades all charitable 
contributions raised by the banquet go to the Boys and Girls club of Western 
Pennsylvania, which directly funds activities and equipment for nearly 
7,000 youths annually. The organization also presently sponsors the annual 
Dapper Dan Wrestling Classic.[1] Previous fundraisers included the occasional 
Dapper Dan Open golf tournament in the 1930s and 1940s, World Heavyweight 
Titles hosted at Forbes Field in the 1950s and 1960s and the Roundball 
Classic hosted at the Civic Arena from 1965 until the 1980s. Through Pittsburgh 
Pirates broadcaster Bob Prince's friendship with Fred Hutchinson the Dapper 
Dan Charity awarded Major League Baseball's annual Hutch Award at the annual 
banquet until at least 1993.[2][3][4][5] Various years the Dapper Dan Banquet 
has been a who's who of Western Pennsylvania sports, and attracted national 
and even international stars and entertainers. In 1993 George Wendt and 
David Lander hosted the event.[2] Howard Baldwin, Craig Patrick, Lanny
