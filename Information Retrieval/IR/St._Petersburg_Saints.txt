The St. Petersburg Saints were a minor league baseball team that operated 
out of St. Petersburg, Florida. The team began as a semi-pro team and as 
early as October 1908, the semi-pro Saints played the Cincinnati Reds in 
a post-season exhibition game.[1] By 1914, the Saints were receiving regular 
coverage in the local press.[2] They played in the Florida State League 
from 1920-1928 and then folded operations. A second team, also called the 
St.Petersburg Saints played in the Florida International League from 1947-1954 
and the Florida State League from 1955-1965. The team won four championships 
and were owned by R. Vernon and Irene C. Eckert from 1951-1954. They were 
affiliated with Cleveland in 1949, the New York Yankees from 1956-1961, 
and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1962-1965. The team name was changed to the 
St. Petersburg Cardinals upon their signing an affiliation deal with the 
St. Louis Cardinals in 1966. They continued as the Cards through 1996, 
winning four more championships. The team was renamed once more in 1997 
as the St. Petersburg Devil Rays (an affiliation deal with the Tampa Bay 
Devil Rays) and remained operation until folding for good after the 2000 
season when the Devil Rays affiliated with the Advanced Single-A Bakersfield 
Blaze for the 2001 season. On June 23, 2007, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays wore 
1955 St. Petersburg Saints uniforms in a turn back the clock game against 
the Dodgers. Rays coach Don Zimmer had played on the 1955 World Series 
champion Brooklyn Dodgers and the Rays honored the 1955 team and Zimmer.[3]
