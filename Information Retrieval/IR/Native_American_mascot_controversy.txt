The propriety of using terms and images referring to Native Americans as 
the name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in 
the United States and in Canada, arising as part of the Native American 
civil rights movement in the 1960s. Since the 1960s, there have been a 
number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and others targeting 
the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises 
such as the Cleveland Indians (in particular their "Chief Wahoo" logo); 
and the Washington Redskins (the term "redskins" being defined in most 
American English dictionaries as 'derogatory slang').[1] The issue is often 
discussed in the media only in terms of 'offensiveness', which tends to 
reduce the problem to one of just feelings and opinions, and prevents a 
fuller understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American 
names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports 
teams should be eliminated.[2] Social science research says that sports 
mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important 
symbols with deeper psychological and social effects.[3] The accumulation 
of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations 
representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts 
adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American 
names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping 
that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other 
problems faced by Native Americans.[4][5] Native mascots are also part 
of the larger issues of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous 
intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives 
use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment or other performances. 
It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation 
of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance 
and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress 
indigenous groups.[6] Defenders of the current usage often state their 
intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such 
as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; 
while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native 
Americans as savages.[1] Supporters also state that the issue is not important, 
being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than "political 
correctness", which critics argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful 
effects of stereotypes and bias.[7] Although there has been a steady decline 
in the number of teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless 
remain fairly common in American sports, and may be found in use at all 
levels, from elementary school teams to professional sports franchises. 
However, no new team have adopted such names for decade until 2016 when 
one of the teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) 
was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo. 
The public outcry[8] resulted in an immediate change to the Lake Erie Eagles.[9] 
European Americans have had a history of "playing Indian" that dates back 
to the colonial period. In the 19th century, fraternal organizations such 
as the Tammany Societies and the Improved Order of Red Men adopted the 
words and material culture of Native Americans in part to establish an 
aboriginal identity, while ignoring the dispossession and conquest of indigenous 
peoples.[10][11] This practice spread to youth groups such as the Boy Scouts 
of America (BSA) (in particular, the Order of the Arrow) and many summer 
camps. University students in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted 
Indian names and symbols for their group identities, not from authentic 
sources but rather as Native American life was imagined by European Americans.[12] 
Professional team nicknames had similar origins. Founded as the Boston 
Red Stockings, the team became the Braves for the first time in 1912. Their 
owner, James Gaffney, was a member of New York City's political machine, 
Tammany Hall, one of the societies originally formed to honor Tamanend, 
a chief of the Delaware. The Cleveland Indians' name originated from a 
request by club owner Charles Somers to baseball writers to choose a new 
name to replace the "Naps" following the departure of their star player 
Nap Lajoie after the 1914 season.[13] The name "Indians" was chosen as 
it was one of the nicknames previously applied to the old Cleveland Spiders 
baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, 
played in Cleveland.[14] The success of the Braves in the 1914 World Series 
may have been another reason for adopting an Indian mascot. The story that 
the team is named to honor Sockalexis, as the first Native American to 
play Major League Baseball, cannot be verified from historical documents.[15] 
The news stories published to announce the selection in 1915 make no mention 
of Sockalexis, but do make many racist and insulting references to Native 
Americans.[16] The Redskins in Washington, D.C. were originally also known 
as the Boston Braves when formed in 1932, since it was the custom at the 
time to have the same team names when baseball and football teams shared 
the same stadium. After moving to the home of the Boston Red Sox, the team 
name was changed to Redskins in 1933, before moving again to Washington, 
D.C. in 1937. Thus, the use of Native American names and imagery by this 
team began before the hiring of William Henry Dietz as coach in 1933.[17] 
The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context 
of history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts 
to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 
19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from 
their families in order to educate them as European Americans.[18] As stated 
in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins 
(Lumbee) both professors of American Indian Studies at the University of 
Minnesota: "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native 
peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions 
and caricatures. Whether portrayed as noble savages, ignoble savages, teary-eyed 
environmentalists or, most recently, simply as casino-rich, native peoples 
find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity 
undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal 
experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about 
the depicters than about the depicted." [19] In the 1940s the National 
Congress of American Indians (NCAI) created a campaign to eliminate negative 
stereotyping of Native American people in the media. Over time, the campaign 
began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports.[20] The NCAI maintains 
that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate 
negative stereotypes of Native American people, and demean their native 
traditions and rituals: "Often citing a long held myth by non-Native people 
that "Indian" mascots "honor Native people," American sports businesses 
such as the NFL’s Washington 'Redskins' and Kansas City 'Chiefs', MLB’s 
Cleveland 'Indians' and Atlanta 'Braves', and the NHL’s Chicago Black Hawks, 
continue to profit from harmful stereotypes originated during a time when 
white superiority and segregation were commonplace."[21] On these stereotypes, 
the NCAI states these mascots, "slander, defame, and vilify Native peoples, 
Native cultures, and tribal nations, and continue a legacy of racist and 
prejudiced attitudes. In particular, the ‘savage’ and ‘clownish’ caricatures 
used by sports teams with "Indian" mascots contribute to the "savage" image 
of Native peoples and the myth that Native peoples are an ethnic group 
‘frozen in history.’ All of which continue to plague this country’s relationships 
with Native peoples and perpetuate racial and political inequity."[22] 
Several of the founders of the American Indian Movement, including Clyde 
Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt,[23] and Russel Means,[24] were also the 
first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and 
Chief Wahoo. Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations 
Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example 
of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First 
Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the 
superiority of the dominant culture.[25] Such practices can be seen as 
a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.[26] Pewewardy has collected 
many statements made by non-natives when attempting to address racial issues, 
and places them in four categories: Not all Native Americans are united 
in total opposition to mascots. Steven Denson, director of diversity for 
Southern Methodist University and member of the Chickasaw nation, while 
not issuing a blanket endorsement, has nevertheless stated that there are 
acceptable ways to use Native American mascots if it is done in a respectful 
and tasteful manner. He states: "I believe it is acceptable if used in 
a way that fosters understanding and increased positive awareness of the 
Native-American culture. And it must also be done with the support of the 
Native-American community. There is a way to achieve a partnership that 
works together to achieve mutually beneficial goals."[28] Five of the college 
teams originally list by the NCAA as possibly "hostile and abusive" (see 
below) established relationships with specific tribes that allowed them 
to retain their names. The harm done by the use of Native American mascots, 
particularly in an academic context, was stated by the Society of Indian 
Psychologists in 1999: Stereotypical and historically inaccurate images 
of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting 
and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views of indigenous peoples 
and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual 
information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and 
prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the 
University.) In the same vein, we believe that continuation of the use 
of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused 
by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.[29] Sports mascots 
have been cited as an example of microaggressions, the everyday insults 
that members of marginalized minority groups are subject to in the comments 
and actions of other groups in society.[30] In 2005, the American Psychological 
Association issued a resolution "Recommending the Immediate Retirement 
of American Indian Mascots, Symbols, Images, and Personalities by Schools, 
Colleges, Universities, Athletic Teams, and Organizations" due to the harm 
done by creating a hostile environment, the negative impact on the self-esteem 
of American Indian children, and discrimination that may violate civil 
rights. It also impacts non-natives by reinforcing mainstream stereotypes, 
preventing learning about Native American culture. The APA states that 
stereotyping is disrespectful of the beliefs, traditions and values of 
Native Americans.[31] Similar resolutions have been adopted by the American 
Sociological Association,[32] the American Counseling Association,[33] 
and the American Anthropological Association.[34] In a 2005 report on the 
status of Native American students, the National Education Association 
included the elimination of Indian mascots and sports team names as one 
of its recommendations.[35] Social science research gives weight to the 
perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies support 
the view that sports mascots and images are not trivial.[36] Stereotyping 
directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute 
to all of the other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, 
unemployment, and poverty.[37] European Americans exposed to mascots are 
more likely to believe not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native 
Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes.[38] Research also 
demonstrates the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two 
studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot 
on the tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group. A 
study was first done at the University of Illinois, and then replicated 
at The College of New Jersey with the same results. Students were given 
a paragraph to read about Chief Illiniwek adapted from the University of 
Illinois' official website; while the control group was given a description 
of an arts center. In both studies the students exposed to the sports mascot 
were more likely to express stereotypical views of Asian Americans. Although 
Chief Illiniwek was described only in terms of positive characteristics 
(as a respectful symbol, not a mascot), the stereotyping of Asian Americans 
included negative characteristics, such as being "socially inept". This 
was indicative of a spreading effect; exposure to any stereotypes increased 
the likelihood of stereotypical thinking.[39][40] Summarizing such studies, 
writer DaShanne Stokes states that mascots perpetuate "institutionalized 
racism. Institutionalized racism contributes to high rates of unemployment, 
poverty, health problems, and inadequate education for many Native Americans. 
In short, Native team names and mascots contribute to the very problems 
we should be focused on solving.[41] The NAACP passed a resolution calling 
for the end of the use of Native American names, images, and mascots in 
1999.[42] In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released an advisory 
opinion calling for an end to the use of Native American images and team 
names by non-Native schools. The opinion made the following points: In 
February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint 
with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's 
complaint asserts that new research clearly establishes that use of American 
Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal 
learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964.[44] In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that 
the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which 
was not established.[45] One of the schools named in the MDCR complaint, 
Saranac Community Schools in Ionia County, MI plans to retain the name 
Redskins but has replaced the logo on its uniforms with a "Dreamcatcher" 
and the band will no longer play the "Tomahawk Song" at games.[46] Civil 
rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience 
of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. Slavery was a more 
personal assault and continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination 
that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans 
wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing 
to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came 
to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and 
rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore 
seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by 
those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference 
is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots 
when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in 
particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim 
that the stereotype of the "noble savage" honors Native Americans.[47] 
In a report issued in 2012, a United Nations expert on Human Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples cited the continued use of Native American references 
by sports team as a part of the stereotyping that "obscures understanding 
of the reality of Native Americans today and instead help to keep alive 
racially discriminatory attitudes."[48] In 1992, the Central Conference 
of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams 
names that promote racism, in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington 
Redskins.[49] In 2004, the United Methodist Church also passed a resolution 
condemning the use of Native American team names and sports mascots, which 
was highlighted in a meeting of the Black caucus of that organization in 
2007.[50][51] A child once asked me why Indians were "mean." Where did 
he get that idea? By schools such as the University of Illinois "honoring" 
my ancestors? -- Rev. Alvin Deer (Kiowa/Creek), United Methodist Church 
[52] A group of sixty-one religious leaders in Washington, D.C. sent a 
letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and team owner Daniel Snyder stating 
their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the 
offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether 
or not that is intended.[53][54] Members of the Indian Affairs Committee 
of the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends approved a formal 
statement condemning the name of the Washington football team, stating 
that "the NFL has violated its core principles for decades by allowing 
the team playing in Washington, D.C., to carry the name 'redskins,' a racist 
epithet that insults millions of Native Americans. Continued use of the 
term encourages and perpetuates persecution, disrespect, and bigotry against 
Native men, women, and children".[55] The Torch Committee, the student 
government organization of the Sandy Spring Friends School in the Maryland 
suburbs of Washington, voted to ban any apparel on the campus which includes 
the Redskins name, although the logo would continue to be allowed.[56] 
In a meeting March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Central Atlantic 
Conference of the United Church of Christ (UCC) unanimously passed a resolution 
proposing that its members boycott Washington Redskins games and shun products 
bearing the team’s logo until the team changes its name and mascot. Team 
spokesman Tony Wyllie offered a response, saying, "We respect those who 
disagree with our team’s name, but we wish the United Church of Christ 
would listen to the voice of the overwhelming majority of Americans, including 
Native Americans, who support our name and understand it honors the heritage 
and tradition of the Native American community."[57] At its annual meeting 
in June 2014, the membership of the UCC also passed a resolution supporting 
the boycott.[58][59] The resolution and boycott was passed by the National 
Synod of the UCC in June, 2015.[60] Opponents also argue there is a double 
standard of Native Americans being the only racial group depicted in sports. 
The only current exception may be the Coachella Valley High School "Arabs"[61] 
which has also been the subject of controversy, resulting in the retirement 
of its more cartoonish representations.[62] The University of Notre Dame 
Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's "Ragin' Cajuns" 
are sometimes cited as counterpoints to this argument.[63] These team names 
are exceptions, in that they represent ethnic groups with an active stake 
in the organization, and the teams employ symbols that European American 
cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The University 
of Notre Dame mascot, the UND leprechaun[64] is a mythical being that represents 
the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a national group.[65][66] The University 
of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper, 
an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine. Opponents also see this 
argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, 
and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one 
group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right 
to be hurt, regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and 
social positions.[67] The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has called for 
an end to the use of Native American mascots, but only by non-native schools.[68] 
In cases where universities were founded to educate Native Americans, such 
mascots may not be examples of cultural appropriation. Examples include 
the Fighting Indians of the Haskell Indian Nations University and the University 
of North Carolina at Pembroke, which continues to have a substantial number 
of native students, and close ties to the Lumbee tribe. Their nickname 
is the Braves, but the mascot is a red-tailed hawk.[69][70] Pembroke Middle 
School, which also has close ties to the Lumbee tribe, is nicknamed the 
Warriors.[71][72] Some individuals who support the use of Native American 
mascots state that they are meant to be respectful, and to pay homage to 
Native American people. Many have made the argument that Native American 
mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything 
derogatory. Karl Swanson, vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional 
football team, declared in the magazine Sports Illustrated that his team's 
name "symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership," and that the "Redskins 
symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people."[73] Anil Adyanthaya, 
an attorney, wrote on June 5, 2005, "The use of Aztec or Seminole as a 
nickname by itself would not appear to be racist, as such names refer to 
a particular civilization rather than an entire race of people. In this 
way, they are no different from other school nicknames such as Trojans 
and Spartans (like Aztecs, ancient peoples) or Fighting Irish and Flying 
Dutchmen (like Seminoles, nationalities). Similarly, Warriors and Braves 
are no different from the fighting men of other cultures, like Vikings, 
Minutemen, or Musketeers (all current NCAA mascots, the first of which 
is also an NFL mascot) so it seems hard to argue that their use is uniquely 
demeaning in some way."[74] However, it is not the names by themselves 
that are seen as uniquely insulting to Native Americans. Dr. Richard Lapchick, 
director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of 
Sport in Society, in an article: "Could you imagine people mocking African 
Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game where there is a team 
with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. 
Is this not the equivalent to black face?"[75] Others claim Native American 
mascots help promote the culture to those who might be unaware of its significance. 
Chief Illiniwek, the former athletic symbol for the University of Illinois, 
became the subject of protest in 1988.[12] However, in 1990 the Board of 
Trustees of the University of Illinois called the mascot a dignified symbol: 
"His ceremonial dance is done with grace and beauty. The Chief keeps the 
memory of the people of a great Native American tribe alive for thousands 
of Illinoisans who otherwise would know little or nothing of them. However, 
the tribal costume was not of the Illinois Confederation, but that of the 
Lakota tribe. The Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma is the closest living 
descendants of the Illiniwek Confederacy; and in 2005, John P. Froman, 
the new Chief when asked his position by the NCAA, indicated that "Chief 
(Illiniwek) was not representative of our tribe and culture, mainly because 
the costume is Sioux."[76] In 2006, in response to a widely published column 
by journalist George Will[77] in support of the symbol's use, Forman wrote 
a letter reiterating the Peoria Tribe's opposition to the symbol and decrying 
that the "University of Illinois has ignored the tribe’s request for nearly 
five years."[78] On March 13, 2007, the University of Illinois board of 
trustees voted to retire Illiniwek's name, image and regalia.[79] In 2001, 
Indian Country Today conducted a poll of an undisclosed number of readers 
reporting that "81 percent of respondents indicated use of American Indian 
names, symbols and mascots are predominantly offensive and deeply disparaging 
to Native Americans." [80] A survey conducted in 2002 by The Harris Poll 
for Sports Illustrated (SI) found that 81 percent of Native Americans who 
live outside traditional Indian reservations and 53 percent of Indians 
on reservations did not find the images discriminatory. The authors of 
the article concluded that "Although most Native American activists and 
tribal leaders consider Indian team names and mascots offensive, neither 
Native Americans in general nor a cross section of U.S. sports fans agree. 
According to the article, There is a near total disconnect between Indian 
activists and the Native American population on this issue." An Indian 
activist commented on the results saying "that Native Americans' self-esteem 
has fallen so low that they don't even know when they're being insulted."[81] 
Soon after the SI article, a group of five social scientists experienced 
in researching the mascot issue published a journal article arguing against 
the validity of this survey and its conclusions. First they state that 
"The confidence with which the magazine asserts that a 'disconnect' between 
Native American activists and Native Americans exists on this issue belies 
the serious errors in logic and accuracy made in the simplistic labeling 
of Native Americans who oppose mascots as 'activists.'" [82][83] More recent 
surveys, rather than addressing the larger issue, have targeted the controversy 
over the name of the Washington Redskins, asking if the word is offensive 
or if it should be changed. By a large majority (71-89 percent), public 
opinion has maintained that the name should not change, but when additional 
questions were asked also have found that the same respondents said "redskin" 
is not an appropriate term for Native Americans.[84] See: Redskins Public 
Opinion Polls. A flaw unique to polls of Native Americans is they rely 
upon self-identification to select the target population. In an editorial 
in the Bloomington Herald Times, Steve Russell (an enrolled Cherokee citizen 
and associate professor of criminal justice at Indiana University), states 
that both SI and Annenberg's samples of "self-identified Native Americans... 
includes plenty of people who have nothing to do with Indians".[85] Individuals 
claiming to be Native American when they are not is well known in academic 
research, and people claiming Indian identity specifically to gain authority 
in the debate over sports mascots has been criticised.[86] At the Center 
for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino 
a survey has conducted of 400 individuals whose identity as Native American 
was verified, finding that 67% agreed with the statement that "Redskins" 
is offensive and racist. The response from non-natives was almost the opposite, 
with 68% responding that the name is not offensive.[87][88] Many supporters 
of Native American mascots feel that the financial cost of changing mascots 
would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots 
and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate millions of 
dollars in sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots 
would render this merchandise useless.[73] The cost of removing images 
from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school 
funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools.[89] Opponents feel that 
despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent 
what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director 
of the American Indian Movement stated: "It's the behavior that accompanies 
all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather 
headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops 
with a tomahawk in one hand and a beer in the other; all of these have 
significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially 
on our youth, is devastating."[73] One attempt to affect the use of mascots 
financially is the case brought against the Washington Redskins to revoke 
their trademarks.(See: Washington Redskins below.) A study done by the 
Emory University Goizueta Business School indicates that the growing unpopularity 
of Native American mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, 
losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.[90] Statewide laws 
or school board decisions have been passed in a small number of states 
with significant Native American populations. However, in response to the 
Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs seeking a ban though the Tennessee 
Human Rights Commission, the Tennessee Senate passed a law allowing only 
elected officials to take any action banning school teams using American 
Indian names and symbols.[91] Several actions have been made specifically 
with regard to schools using the name "Redskins" (See Below). In 2014 State 
lawmakers in Colorado began considering a bill that rather than a complete 
ban, would deny state funding to schools on a case by case basis, depending 
upon the name, logo, and local Native American support.[92] Getting ahead 
of any potential law, Loveland High School in Loveland, Colorado, is "looking 
to a Lakota Sioux tribe for help creating a new mascot and a hands-on lesson 
in history and culture for the school."[93] Although passed by the House 
by one vote, the bill failed in a Colorado Senate committee.[94] Colorado 
Governor John Hickenlooper has created by executive order a commission 
that will hold meetings where local community members, state agencies and 
Native Americans can seek to find common ground on the mascot issue.[95] 
An example of local action is at Cheyenne Mountain High School, Colorado 
Springs, Colorado; which has taken action to eliminate stereotyping, including 
doing the tomahawk chop, or wearing warpaint and headdresses at games.[96] 
On May 17, 2012, the Oregon State Board of Education voted 5-1 to adopt 
a rule prohibiting Oregon public schools from using Native American names, 
symbols, or images as school mascots; giving schools have until July 1, 
2017 to comply. Fifteen schools using the nicknames Indians, Warriors, 
Braves and Chieftains were affected.[97] However, Native American response 
was not unanimous; out of nine tribes, two voiced opposition to the statewide 
ban on the basis of tribal sovereignty. Leaders said that there might have 
been an opportunity for developing an educational program for all students 
to learn about true native culture.[98] In 2014 a state law was passed 
allowing schools to consult with nearby Native American tribes on acceptable 
names and imagery.[99] While some Native Americans support such relationships 
with their local schools, Native American students who compete in athletics 
with these schools state that they are sometimes uncomfortable with the 
imagery used,[100] and some groups maintain that the use of Native mascots 
needs to end everywhere.[101] "These mascots undermine the educational 
experience of all students, particularly those with little or no contact 
with indigenous or native Alaskan peoples," said Se-Ah-Dom Edmo, interim 
president of the Oregon Indian Education Association.[102] In May, 2015 
the Oregon State Board of Education unanimously voted down an amendment 
that would have allowed schools to retain their current names and mascots, 
maintaining the 2017 deadline for change.[103] However, in January 2016 
the board decided to grant exemptions to schools if they work out agreements 
with local tribes.[104] Two schools have decided not to seek the approval 
of any tribe, citing the difficulty of doing so.[105] The Fort Vannoy Elementary 
"Indians" (now the "Nobles") and Fleming Middle School "Rogues" (now the 
"Cavaliers"), both in the Three Rivers School District have changed their 
mascots. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde have entered into agreements 
with schools to allow them to retain the name "Indians" on the conditions 
of removing some imagery and implementing a native history curriculum. 
Three Douglas County, Oregon school districts have decided to take the 
necessary steps to move forward with keeping their Native American mascots. 
Roseburg High School would remain the Indians with the agreement of the 
Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians; the Reedsport Community Charter 
School Braves and the North Douglas High School Warriors in Drain, Oregon 
are also seeking tribal approval.[109] The Confederated Tribes of Siletz 
Indians and the Philomath, Oregon School District are continuing to work 
toward an agreement to keep Warriors as Philomath High School’s mascot.[110] 
Reedsport Community Charter School has until July, 2017 to change its names 
from the "Braves". Three local tribes; the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw, 
the Coquille, and the Siletz do not agree that being a mascot is honorable 
way to represent their tribes. In an effort to retain part of their tradition, 
some in the community are thinking of changing to "Brave" and eliminating 
all Native American imagry.[111] At a meeting of the residents and the 
school's Native American Name and Image Committee, one of the committee 
members asked how many preferred no change, with a overwhelming majority 
of those present agreeing. However, it was stated that was not an option.[112] 
In January, 2016 the South Dakota High School Activities Association passed 
a resolution asking all schools in the state to drop Native American nicknames 
and mascots.[113] A bill was introduced in the South Dakota Legislature 
"to prohibit school districts from using school or athletic team names, 
mascots, or nicknames that are determined to be racially derogatory or 
discriminatory"[114] In December, 2013 the Houston Independent School District 
by unanimous vote passed a preliminary plan to eliminate all ethnically 
sensitive names and mascots, one of which is the Lamar High School Redskins.[115][116] 
The Washington Redskins issued a statement repeating its position that 
such names are not offensive to many Native Americans, but rather are a 
source of pride.[117] In April, 2014 the schools affected by the policy 
announced new names: the Lamar High School Redskins will become the Texans, 
both the Hamilton Middle School Indians and Westbury High School Rebels 
will be the Huskies and the Welch Middle School Warriors will be the Wolf 
Pack. The initial cost of the change was $50,000 for new fall uniforms, 
and there will be additional costs such as changing names and logos on 
facilities.[118] The total cost is estimated to be $250,000.[119] However 
it was noted that team uniforms are periodically replaced anyway, so the 
cost is not due only to the name changes.[120] "The moral cost to our reputation 
as a diverse district -- where we care about the sensitivities of every 
single individual -- would be incalculable if we were not to do this," 
HISD superintendent Terry Grier said.[121] The Seattle-area Issaquah School 
District adopted a policy banning symbols based on racial stereotypes; 
resulting in a change of the Issaquah High School team from the "Indians" 
to the "Eagles" in 2003 over the protest of some students.[122] On September 
26, 2012 the Washington State Board of Education (WSBE) passed a resolution 
calling for the end of Native American mascots in state schools.[123][124] 
The Seattle Human Rights Commission passed a resolution supporting the 
WSBE in November, 2012.[125] In 2010 a law was passed in Wisconsin to eliminate 
race-based nicknames, logos and mascots in schools; but allowing retention 
if they have the permission of local Native American tribes. Many mascots 
were changed either voluntarily or in response to complaints.[126] However, 
in October 2013 the law was changed to make it more difficult by requiring 
the complainant to collect signatures of 10% of the school district's population 
and prove discrimination, while under the 2010 law only one petitioner 
is needed, and the burden of proof is on the school to disprove racism.[127] 
Although now allowed to do so, some schools that have already made a change 
have decided not to restore their prior mascots.[128] Native American groups 
opposed the change in the law.[129][130] Delivering the State of the Tribes 
address to the Wisconsin legislature in March, 2015; Mole Lake Sokaogon 
Chairman Chris McGeshik stated: "We believe the recent decision to override 
the progress made with the state in regard to the school mascots to be 
a mockery of the indigenous people in the state and around America."[131] 
Prompted by the concerns of Native Americans, the Madison Metropolitan 
School District in Wisconsin has implemented a policy banning student clothing 
having "words, pictures, or caricatures based on negative stereotypes of 
a specific gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation 
or disability", which would ban all sports apparel displaying Native American 
mascot names, images or logos.[132] However the ban may not pass the legal 
test that freedom of speech does not allow for a ban on expression unless 
there is a "substantial disruption of the educational mission".[133] Visiting 
athletic teams will also be asked to leave behind Native American mascots 
and logos, otherwise the game could be canceled.[134] Some college teams 
voluntarily changed their names and mascots. Stanford University had "The 
Stanford Indian" as its mascot from 1930 to 1972. Today "Stanford Cardinal" 
honors the university athletic team color. The symbol of the Stanford Band 
is the "Stanford Tree." Another early change was the "Saltine Warrior" 
that represented Syracuse University from 1931 until 1978. After a brief 
attempt to use a Roman warrior, the mascot became Otto the Orange for the 
school color. Miami University began discussion regarding the propriety 
of the Redskins name and images in 1972, and changed its team nickname 
to RedHawks in 1996.[135] Although the team name of Eastern Michigan University 
changed from the Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change remained controversial 
with some students and alumni who sought to restore it. In 2012 the university 
president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a 
of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated 
intent of recognizing the past. However the return of the Hurons logo has 
prompted protests from Native Americans both students at the university 
and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes 
and hostility.[136][137] Marquette University changed their team name from 
the Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994. The school’s president stated:"We 
live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 
1954. The perspective of time has shown us that our actions, intended or 
not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act in a way that others 
will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity 
as fellow human beings."[138] Also in 1994, St. John's University (New 
York) changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red 
Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who 
considered Redmen a slur.[139] In late 2002, The Strategic Planning Committee 
of Stonehill College determined that the then-current mascot, the chieftain, 
was disrespectful to American Indians and decided that it would be changed. 
After discussion, the mascot was changed to the Skyhawk in 2005.[140] Jim 
Seavey, associate director of athletics stated: "Twelve years ago, the 
college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress 
and feathers and stuff. We really did not have anything to represent our 
identity that we were comfortable with. We felt . . . that it wasn't appropriate 
to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot," 
[141] Additionally, teams that are not directly affected by this controversy 
have issued their opinions. The University of Wisconsin–Madison[142] and 
the University of Iowa have both refused to schedule non-conference games 
against schools with Native American mascots. The University of Iowa's 
own nickname, "Hawkeyes", has Native American origins (Iowa is the "Hawkeye 
State"), although the team uses a hawk as its symbol rather than an Indian. 
Although Dartmouth University had not used an Indian mascot for many years, 
Yale University printed a program for the 2016 game commemorating its 100th 
game against Dartmouth showing historical program covers featuring depictions 
of Native Americans that are now viewed as racist.[143] The National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a "self evaluation" to 31 colleges 
in 2005, for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery 
with their mascot choice.[144] Subsequently 19 teams were cited as having 
potentially "hostile or abusive" names, mascots, or images, that would 
be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited 
from hosting tournaments.[145] All of the colleges previously using Native 
American imagery changed except for those granted waivers when they obtained 
official support from individual tribes based upon the principle of Tribal 
Sovereignty.[21] San Diego State University was not cited by the NCAA in 
2005 due to a decision that the Aztecs were not a Native American tribe 
with any living decendents.[146] However, the Aztec Warrior whose performance 
including human sacrifice, has drawn criticism.[147] A SDSU professor of 
American Indian Studies states that among other problems the mascot teaches 
the mistaken idea that Aztecs were a local tribe rather than living in 
Mexico 1,000 miles away.[148] Secondary schools in both the United States 
and Canada have had histories similar to colleges, some making voluntary 
changes while others maintain their current mascots. Relationships with 
tribes have been established at the high school level. Arapahoe High School 
(Centennial, Colorado) now uses a logo provided by the Arapaho Tribe of 
Wyoming, which initially included an agreement that the image would not 
be placed on the gym floor or any article of clothing. The latter provision 
has not always been observed, but the logo does not appear on the team 
uniforms. The agreement also includes tribal participation in school events. 
Justice Murray Sinclair, the head of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission says "sports teams with offensive names, such as Redskins and 
cartoonish aboriginal-looking mascots have no place in a country trying 
to come to grips with racism in its past".[149] The Department of Educational 
Foundations at the University of Saskatchewan passed a resolution calling 
for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict First Nations 
people.[150] Brebeuf College School, a Catholic all-boys school in North 
York, Ontario changed its nickname to "Bulls" in 2004 after being called 
"Redmen" since 1963. David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, 
Ontario had been the "Redmen" since 1959, which was changed to the "Titans" 
in 2005. Controversy over the name and logo of the Bedford Road Collegiate 
"Redmen" in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan began in the 1990s, with a vote by 
students in 1996 choosing to keep things as they are. In 2011 one alumnus 
of the school used social media to advocate for a change.[151] In 2013, 
a group of protestors of the name and logo where blocked from entering 
a high school basketball tournament at Bedford Road, the school and police 
citing safety concerns.[152] In 2014 three schools in Canada dropped the 
"Redmen" name: Bedford Road[153] became the RedHawks, Balfour Collegiate 
became the Bears,[154] and Western Canada High School in Calgary also became 
the Redhawks.[155] In Ontario, there is debate over the Thorold Blackhawks 
junior hockey team and the Denis Morris Catholic High School "Redmen".[156] 
A grade 12 student has started a petition to change the Mohawks mascot 
used by Medicine Hat High School, Medicine Hat, Alberta.[157] While the 
petition to change the name has not yet been submitted to the school board, 
a counter-petition to keep the name with 1,500 signatures has been submitted. 
The board has asked the Canadian Mohawk Nations of Kahnawà:ke and Akwesasne 
for their position on the use of the name.[158] In addition to moving to 
change their own mascots, school boards in Ontario are moving towards a 
ban on students wearing any articles bearing offensive names or logos, 
be they professional or local teams.[159] In January 2014 the Nez Perce 
Tribal Executive Committee sent a letter to two northern Idaho school districts 
with American Indian mascots asking that they be changed. The mascots are 
the Sacajawea Junior High Braves in Lewiston and the Nezperce High School 
Indians. The school officials state that they will have meetings and gather 
public opinions before making a decision.[160] Turners Falls High School 
of Turners Falls, Massachusetts changed its fight song, known as the tomahawk 
chop, but did not change its name, the Indians. Blacksburg High School 
in Blacksburg, Virginia changed their mascot from the Indians to the Bruins, 
and the corresponding middle school mascot of the Braves was changed to 
the Titans. The Dalles High School in The Dalles, Oregon will become the 
Riverhawks for Fall 2014 after being the "Indian Eagles" since 2000 after 
the merger of two schools. Although the Oregon legislature has allowed 
high schools to retain native mascots with the approval of a local tribe, 
the North Wasco County School District Superintendent Candy Armstrong states 
that, with 48 tribes in the area, "We thought [working with one] might 
not cause harmony but create more issues.".[161] John Swett High School 
in Crockett, California dropped its Indians mascot by a unanimous vote 
of the School Board in February, 2015 in response to the group Sacred Sites 
Protection and Rights of Indigenous Tribes which lobbied for the change.[162] 
However, citing the Golden State Warriors as an example, this Bay Area 
school changed from Indians to Warriors in February, 2016. Unlike the NBA 
team the high school has not eliminated Native American references.[163] 
Students of Belmont High School in Belmont, New Hampshire questioned the 
use of Native American imagery in connection to their name, the Red Raiders, 
saying that while it was never intended to be offensive it is time for 
a change. At a meeting on the subject there were equal, but respectful 
comments of both sides.[164] The Shaker Regional School Board voted down 
the student council request to change the logo.[165] The last high school 
in Maine using a Native American name, the Skowhegan Area High School Indians, 
held a forum to discuss the issue in May, 2015. Only residents of the school 
district and elected officials were allowed to speak. Individuals spoke 
both for and against retiring the name.[166] At a previous meeting of a 
school subcommittee, tribal representatives called for a change in the 
name.[167] Subsequently, the school board voted 11-9 to keep the name.[168] 
However local Native Americans, including representatives of Maine's four 
Wabanaki tribes, continue to protest the name.[169] Natick High School 
in Natick, Massachusetts was also the Redmen. An initial vote by the school 
committee to change the name was in 2007, prompting the formation of a 
"Redmen Forever" committee by alumni of the school.[170] In spite of their 
activity, including a nonbinding town referendum in which 65% of the voters 
supported asking the school committee to reconsider the change, the name 
was dropped in 2008.[171] The school team is now the Redhawks,[172] however 
some continue to favor returning to the previous name.[173] A group of 
Native American female basketball players from the Tiospa Zina Tribal School 
hosted a rally during a game with Sisseton High School in Sisseton, South 
Dakota, asking the Sisseton School District to change the name of its team 
and logo from Redmen. The grandparents of four of the students protested 
the name in the 1990s. The school district superintendent said there was 
support for the name.[174][175] There was a report of a fight between the 
brother of one of the protestors and a Sisseton student over the sale of 
"Not Your Mascot" T-shirts.[176] Two high schools in West Hartford, Connecticut 
have replaced their Native American logos, but retain the names: the Conard 
High School Chieftains and Hall High Warriors.[177] Pascack Valley High 
School in New Jersey has also decided to retire its "Indian Head" logo 
while retaining its Indians nickname.[178] Bellevue East High School in 
Nebraska will remain the Chieftains, but headdresses and war-paint have 
been banned at games.[179] In 2015, 92% of the community and 90% of the 
students voted to keep the "Indians" mascot of Belin High School in Wisconsin.[180] 
Onteora High School, located in Boiceville, New York was scheduled to drop 
its "Indian" mascot in 2000, but the decision was overturned by a town 
vote. The current plan to select a new mascot comes from students, the 
Student Government Association holding a contest to come up with new names, 
which will be given to the school board to make the final decision.[181] 
While retaining its team name, the "Arrows", the school district for Watertown 
High School in Watertown, South Dakota has voted to remove Native American 
references from its homecoming pageant, which featured white students dressed 
as Indians.[182] Due to the media coverage of the Washington Redskins, 
high schools with the name Redskins have received particular attention, 
including three which have a majority of Native American students. Advocates 
for the name conclude that because some Native Americans use the name to 
refer to themselves, it is not insulting.[183] However, the principal of 
one of these, Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, said that 
use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because 
it could perpetuate "the legacy of negativity that the term has created."[184] 
As of early 2013, the Capitol News Service affiliated with the Philip Merrill 
College of Journalism of the University of Maryland listed twenty-eight 
high schools in 18 states that had dropped the "Redskins" name during the 
prior 25 years as a result of a combination of state legal action, protests 
from Native American groups, or voluntarily; while 62 were listed as continuing 
to use the "Redskins" name.[185] Since that list was compiled, an additional 
seven high school teams have changed their name: Cooperstown, New York 
High School,[186] Port Townsend High School,[187] Lamar High School in 
Houston, Texas,[117] Capitol Hill High School, Oklahoma City,[188] Lancaster 
High School (Lancaster, New York),[189] Goshen High School (Indiana),[190] 
and North Side High School (Fort Wayne, Indiana).[191] A law signed on 
October 11, 2015 will require the four High Schools in California to change 
their name by January 1, 2017.[192] In addition to schools, there are many 
teams for young players using Native American names that participate in 
Little league baseball and Pop Warner Little Scholars football as well 
as other youth leagues, some of which are sponsored by professional teams.[193] 
Ian Champeau, an Ojibway man in Ottawa, Ontario filed a human rights complaint 
against the Nepean Redskins Football Club on behalf of his five-year-old 
daughter in an effort to get the team to change its name. "How are they 
going to differentiate the playing field from the school yard? What’s going 
to stop them from calling my daughter a redskin in the school yard? That’s 
as offensive as using the n-word." Assembly of First Nations National Chief 
Shawn A-in-chut Atleo said he supports the move because the word Redskin 
is "offensive and hurtful and completely inappropriate.[194] Niigaan Sinclair 
(Anishinaabe), a writer and assistant professor at the University of Manitoba 
applauds the decision and contrasts it to the decision of Daniel Snyder, 
the Washington team owner. Citing the combination of the stereotype of 
the Indian with sports in the early 20th century: "The marriage of the 
Sioux-like warrior name and image to sports was complete, celebrating and 
re-telling American violence against indigenous communities every time 
one appears on sports highlights. It's tough to change abusive relationships." 
[195] The team was changed to the "Nepean Eagles", chosen from 70 suggestions 
submitted.[196] A name of a team in a youth football league in Brooklyn, 
New York was changed from the Redskins to the Bears after some parents 
made complaints.[197] Other youth leagues contacted by the media to comment 
about the use of the Redskins name did not respond officially, however 
one parent of a player on a team in Leesburg, Virginia stated "...the name 
is a part of football history and tradition. I don't believe it is meant 
to be derogatory."[198] None of the National Basketball Association (NBA) 
teams that previously used Native American mascots continue to do so. The 
Atlanta Hawks were originally the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (using an "Indian" 
logo)[199] before moving to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and changing its name 
to Hawks in 1951. The former Buffalo Braves relocated to San Diego in 1978, 
and are now known as the Los Angeles Clippers. The Golden State Warriors, 
originally known as the Philadelphia Warriors before moving to San Francisco 
in 1962, eliminated Native American imagery in 1971.[200] Since that time, 
their logos have emphasized the state of California, with their current 
primary logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco–Oakland 
Bay Bridge. The warrior depicted on logos used from 1997-2010 was a generic 
lightning-wielding figure. The Atlanta Braves remain the home of the tomahawk 
chop (although it began at Florida State University).[201] The logo has 
changed through the years from an Indian in full headdress to an Indian 
with a Mohawk hairstyle and single feather (described as either laughing 
or shouting), then to the Braves name in script over a tomahawk. The mascot 
Chief Noc-A-Homa was replaced in 1986. The current mascot is "Homer the 
Brave".[202] The National Hockey League (NHL)'s Chicago Blackhawks was 
named in honor of the U.S. 86th Infantry Division, which was nicknamed 
the "Blackhawk Division" after Black Hawk, a Native American chief; the 
team's founder, Frederic McLaughlin, having served in that division.[203] 
The team's primary logo is a Native American's profile. In 2008, the staff 
of The Hockey News voted the team's logo to be the best in the NHL.[204] 
An alternate logo is a block "C" with crossed tomahawks.[205] The Blackhawks 
mascot is "Tommy Hawk", an anthropomorphic bird who also wears the four 
feathers worn by the logo figure.[206] Suzan Shown Harjo of the Morning 
Star Institute, a Washington-based advocacy group, has said that the typical 
Native American logo, "relegates native people to a certain time in history 
that's not today, and it's intended to do so. It's not something that reflects 
anything that's current. It kind of keeps us in the backwater of history." 
Harjo says the Blackhawks have escaped the scrutiny given to other teams 
using Native imagery because hockey is not a cultural force on the level 
of football. But she says national American Indian organizations have called 
for an end to all Indian-related mascots and that she found the hockey 
team's name and Indian head symbol to be offensive. "It lacks dignity," 
she said. "There's dignity in a school being named after a person or a 
people. There's dignity in a health clinic or hospital. There's nothing 
dignified in something being so named (that is used for) recreation or 
entertainment or fun." The National Congress of American Indians also opposes 
the Blackhawks' logo, as it does all Native American mascots.[207] In 2010, 
sports columnist Damien Cox called on the franchise to retire the "racially 
insensitive" logo, saying that: "Clearly, no right-thinking person would 
name a team after an aboriginal figure these days any more than they would 
use Muslims or Africans or Chinese or any ethnic group to depict a specific 
sporting notion."[208] The Blackhawks have worked with the American Indian 
Center to help educate their community and fan base by sharing Native American 
culture and history. Scott Sypolt, Executive Counsel for the American Indian 
Center weighed in on the logo and name controversy by stating, "There is 
a consensus among us that there’s a huge distinction between a sports team 
called the Redskins depicting native people as red, screaming, ignorant 
savages and a group like the Blackhawks honoring Black Hawk, a true Illinois 
historical figure."[209] However, this stance is markedly different from 
the one previously taken by the American Indian Center, with the shift 
coming only in the past few years. In 2010, for instance, Joe Podlasek 
stated that, "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks 
logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that 
with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on 
it and dance on it?" [210] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe 
of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position for the American 
Indian Center may be connected to contributions the Blackhawks organization 
has recently begun making to the center: "We all do contributions, but 
we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've 
done that's offensive."[207] Ghislain Picard, the head of the Assembly 
of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador, says he would support the change 
of the logo to one designed by an Ojibwe artist featuring a black hawk.[211] 
The owner of the NHL Winnipeg Jets has decided to ban fake Native headdresses 
at games after meeting with First Nations leaders. The meeting took place 
in response to a complaint by a Jets fan after seeing a Blackhawks fan 
in a headdress last season.[212] In 1997 and 1998, protesters were arrested 
after effigies were burned. Charges were dismissed in the 1997 case, and 
were not filed in the 1998 case. Protesters arrested in the 1998 incident 
subsequently fought and lost a lawsuit alleging that their First Amendment 
rights had been violated.[213][214][215][216] The Chief Wahoo logo was 
replaced with a block letter "C" or script "I" in many situations, such 
as on their caps and batting helmets.[217] At the beginning of 2014, a 
decision was made to make the block "C" the team's primary logo—although 
Chief Wahoo will not disappear entirely—and some see this as a first step 
toward inevitable elimination.[218] A variety of responses to the issue 
has emerged from the Cleveland fanbase. Some fans have removed Chief Wahoo 
logos from purchased apparel, an outcome that is being termed "de-chiefing".[219] 
Blogger Peter Pattakos captured a photograph on April 4, 2014 outside a 
Cleveland Indians game which depicts a discussion between activist Robert 
Roche of the American Indian Movement and a sports fan costumed as the 
team mascot Chief Wahoo.[220][221] One reader's comments on press reports 
of the event led to a comparison with a "But I'm honoring you, dude!" editorial 
cartoon from 2002.[222] An advocate for replacing Chief Wahoo makes the 
connection between the logo and fans wearing redface, beating a tom-tom, 
and other stereotypical "Indian" behavior that would not be acceptable 
toward any other ethnic group.[223] Former MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said 
in 2014 that he had never received a complaint about the Wahoo logo, and 
that individual teams such as the Indians and Braves should make their 
own decisions.[224] Native Americans protested Chief Wahoo on Opening Day 
2015, as they have for many years, making note that this is the 100th anniversary 
of the team becoming the Indians. Owner Paul Dolan, while stating he is 
respectful of critics, says he mainly hears from fans who want to keep 
Chief Wahoo, and has no plans to change.[225] While claiming to honor Native 
Americans, fans confronted by the Native American protesters gave them 
the finger and made disparaging remarks about scalping.[226] The success 
of the team in the 2016 season led to renewed attention, first during the 
playoffs with the Toronto Blue Jays,[227][228][229] then during the World 
Series games in Cleveland.[230] The Edmonton Eskimos had little controversy 
over the years, in part because they do not use any native imagery. The 
name Eskimo originated as a word used by the Cree to refer to the Inuit, 
who are few in the Edmonton area, and are ambivalent or supportive of the 
team name. A notable Inuk who openly supported the team name was former 
Edmonton Inuit player Dave Ward, now better known as Kiviaq.[231][232] 
However Natan Obed, the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada's 
national Inuit organization, has stated that "Eskimo" "is not only outdated, 
it is now largely considered a derogatory term" and is a "relic of colonial 
power".[233] Former Eskimos player Andre Talbot stated: "Sports organizations 
need to be community building organizations. And if we're isolating and 
offending part of that community, then our particular organization or league 
is not doing its job."[234] In 1963 the Kansas City Chiefs adopted a name 
referring to Native Americans, when the Dallas Texans (AFL) relocated. 
While adopting Native American imagery, the team was named in honor of 
Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle who was instrumental in bringing the 
Texans to Kansas City, Missouri. Bartel earned his nickname as founder 
of a Boy Scouts honor camping society Tribe of Mic-O-Say in which he was 
"Chief" Lone Bear. In 1989 the Chiefs switched from Warpaint, a Pinto horse 
ridden by a man in a feathered headdress, to their current mascot K. C. 
Wolf. Warpaint returned in 2009, but is ridden by a cheerleader.[235] Following 
the appearance of photographs of fans attending an October 2013 game wearing 
feathers and warpaint—and doing the tomahawk chop—in the Kansas City Star, 
numerous Native Americans submitted complaints to the publication. One 
caller, who was especially upset that the photographs were published on 
Columbus Day, described the images as a "mockery" and "racist". Writing 
for the Star's "Public Editor" column, Derek Donovan explained that he 
found the complaints "reasonable" and suggested that the newspaper depict 
"other colorful, interesting people in the crowds."[236] The Kansas City 
Star reported in early August 2014 that the team's management is planning 
discussions with some Native American groups to find a non-confrontational 
way to eliminate, or at least reduce, offensive behavior.[237] Amanda Blackhorse, 
the lead plaintiff in the trademark case against the Washington Redskins, 
thinks the real solution is a name change for the Chiefs.[238] Native Americans 
in Phoenix, Arizona picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the Arizona 
Cardinals, and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar "Redface", the 
wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to 
be a mockery of Native American culture.[239] A protest is planned in Minnesota 
when the Chiefs play the Vikings on October 18, 2015. "The Kansas City 
Chiefs have flown under the radar," said Norma Renville, the executive 
director of Women of Nations Community Advocacy Program and Shelter. "They 
are contributing to our cultural genocide." [240] Achieving greater visibility 
by reaching the playoffs in 2016, Native Americans at Haskell Indian Nations 
University in Lawrence, Kansas are asking the Chiefs to stop behavior that 
invokes stereotypes, such as wearing headdresses and doing the "tomahawk 
chop".[241] The Washington Redskins receives the most public attention 
due to the prominence of the team being located in the nation's capital, 
and the name itself being defined in current dictionaries of American English 
as "usually offensive",[242] "disparaging",[243][244] "insulting",[245] 
and "taboo".[246] Those officially censuring and/or demanding the name 
be changed include more than 80 organizations that represent various groups 
of Native Americans.[247] On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal 
Board (TTAB) cancelled the six trademarks held by the team in a two to 
one decision that held that the term "redskins" is disparaging to a "substantial 
composite of Native Americans", and this is demonstrated "by the near complete 
drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning 
in the 1960s." [248][249] On July 8, 2015 a Federal judge issued a summary 
opinion affirming the TTAB decision.[250][251] Native American opposition 
to the name began in the early 1970s with letters to the owner of the team[252] 
and the editors of the Washington Post.[253] National protests began in 
1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, and again when 1992 Super 
Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills was held in Minnesota.[254] 
A symposium in February 2013 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the 
American Indian in Washington, D.C.,[255] followed by a media campaign 
sponsored by the Oneida Indian Nation of New York,[256] led to a broader 
range of persons speaking out in favor of change or open discussion, including 
50 U.S. Senators[257] and President Barack Obama.[258] Statements in support 
of a name change have been made by religious leaders in Washington, D.C.,[53] 
and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.[259] Team owner 
Daniel Snyder sent an open letter to fans that was published in The Washington 
Post on October 9, 2013. In the letter Snyder states that the most important 
meaning of the name Redskins is the association that fans have to memories 
of their personal history with the team. Snyder also states that the name 
was chosen to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four 
players at that time who were Native American.[260] The team continues 
to cite current polls showing general public opinion in opposition to changing 
the name.[261][262] In May 2016, a poll by the Washington Post (WaPo) found 
that 90% of respondents who identified themselves as Native Americans were 
not offended by the name.[263] The Native American Journalists Association 
(NAJA) issued a statement calling the publication of the poll, and the 
reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but 
unethical. "The reporters and editors behind this story must have known 
that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful, 
racist mascots. They were either willfully malicious or dangerously naïve 
in the process and reporting used in this story, and neither is acceptable 
from any journalistic institution."[264] While not addressing the NAJA 
criticism, the WaPo editorial board continues to maintain its prior position 
that the name is a slur and that they will avoid its use as much as possible.[265] 
The United States national rugby league team was marketed as the Tomahawks 
until 2015, when the team was rebranded to simply the "Hawks".[266] In 
addition to the behavior of the teams that have Native American names or 
mascots, their rivals often invoke racist stereotypes. In December 2013 
when the Washington Redskins played the Kansas City Chiefs an employee 
of a Sonic Drive-In in Missouri placed a message outside that used scalping, 
reservations and whiskey to disparage the "Redskins". It was quickly removed 
with the owner's apologies.[267] A rubber severed "Indian" head impaled 
on a knife was used by a sports fan in Philadelphia to taunt rival teams 
with Native American mascots.[268] There have been a number of incidents 
of rival teams displaying banners or signs referencing the Trail of Tears, 
which have been criticized for both insensitivity and ignorance of history: 
Although the Central Michigan Chippewas have the support of the Saginaw 
Chippewa Tribal Nation of Michigan, a student at rival Western Michigan 
University designed a T-shirt showing a Native American behind bars with 
the legend "Caught a Chippewa about a week ago". It was quickly condemned 
by both university presidents, who agreed that anyone wearing the shirt 
at a game would be ejected.[275] To further complicate this controversy, 
many feel that there are varying levels of offensiveness with team names 
and mascots. The nature and degree of stereotyping varies depending upon 
the name of the team, the logo, the mascot, and the behavior of fans. The 
greatest offense is taken when the logo and mascot are caricatures viewed 
as insulting, such as the Cleveland Indians' Chief Wahoo;[276] the name 
of the team is often regarded as a racial slur, such as redskins; or the 
behavior of the mascot or fans is based upon popular images of Indians 
which trivialize authentic native cultures; such as the tomahawk chop.[277] 
The practices of individual schools and teams have changed in response 
to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux 
Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and 
the "Warriors" nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has 
a "circle of courage" logo with eagle feathers and has also "updated" the 
murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the 
chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte 
Gleska University in Mission, stated: "We had no objection to their utilizing 
those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor 
and dignity." However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence 
of any such images.[278] A database from 2013 shows that there are currently 
almost 2,000 high schools with mascots that reference Native American culture.[279] 
This is down from around 3,000.[21] Though changes have been made at the 
high school and college levels, at the professional level there has been 
virtually no change. The topic remains an issue on a national level, with 
a hearing before the US Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 2011,[280] 
and a symposium at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian 
in 2013.[255] In November, 2015 President Obama, speaking at the White 
House Tribal Nations Conference, stated "Names and mascots of sports teams 
like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native 
Americans" and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change 
names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost
