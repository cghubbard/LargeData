Tiffany & Company (known colloquially as Tiffany or Tiffany's) is an American 
luxury jewelry and specialty retailer, headquartered in New York City.[5] 
Tiffany sells jewelry, sterling silver, china, crystal, stationery, fragrances, 
water bottles, watches, personal accessories, as well as some leather goods.[6] 
Many of these goods are sold at Tiffany stores, as well as through direct-mail 
and corporate merchandising. Tiffany is renowned for its luxury goods and 
is particularly known for its diamond jewelry. Tiffany markets itself as 
an arbiter of taste and style,[7] and was once a purveyor to the Russian 
imperial family.[citation needed] Founded by Charles Lewis Tiffany and 
John B. Young[8] in Brooklyn, Connecticut in 1837 as a "stationery and 
fancy goods emporium", the store initially sold a wide variety of stationery 
items, and operated as "Tiffany, Young and Ellis" in Lower Manhattan. The 
name was shortened to Tiffany & Company in 1853 when Charles Tiffany took 
control and established the firm's emphasis on jewelry.[9] Tiffany & Company 
has since opened stores in major cities all over the world. Unlike other 
stores at the time in the 1830s, Tiffany clearly marked the prices on its 
goods to forestall any haggling over prices. In addition, against the social 
norm at the time, Tiffany only accepted cash payments, and did not accept 
payments on credit.[10] Such practices, fixed prices for ready money, were 
first introduced by Palmer's of London Bridge in 1750, who employed the 
young Robert Owen, the later social reformer. [11] The first Tiffany's 
mail order catalog, known as the "Blue Book," was published in 1845 in 
the United States (U.S.);[12] and publishing of the catalog continues in 
the 21st century. In 1862, Tiffany & Company supplied the Union Army with 
swords (Model 1840 Cavalry Saber), flags and surgical implements. In 1867, 
Tiffany & Co. was the first US firm to win an award for the excellence 
in silverware at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1868, Tiffany 
was incorporated.[7] In 1870, the company built a new store building at 
15 Union Square West, Manhattan, designed by John Kellum and costing $500,000. 
It was described by The New York Times as a "palace of jewels".[13] Tiffany 
stayed at this site until 1906.[13] In 1877, an insignia that would become 
the famous New York Yankees "NY" logo was struck on a police medal of honor 
by Tiffany & Company; the Yankees adopted the logo in 1909. In 1878, Tiffany 
won the gold medal for jewelry and a grand prize for silverware at the 
Paris Exposition, which gave the Tiffany brand name added prestige. In 
1887, Tiffany bought the French Crown Jewels, which attracted publicity 
and further solidified the Tiffany brand's association with high-quality 
diamonds.[14] The company revised the Great Seal of the United States in 
1885. In 1902, after the death of Charles Lewis Tiffany, his son, Louis 
Comfort Tiffany, became the company's first official Design Director.[12] 
In 1919, the company made a revision to the Medal of Honor on behalf of 
the United States Department of the Navy.[15] This "Tiffany Cross" version 
was rare because it was awarded only for combat, using the previous design 
for non-combat awards.[16] In 1942 the Navy established the Tiffany version 
for non-combat heroism, but in August 1942 the Navy eliminated the Tiffany 
Cross and the two-medal system.[17] In 1956, legendary designer Jean Schlumberger 
joined Tiffany, and Andy Warhol collaborated with Tiffany to create Tiffany 
Holiday Cards (circa 1956-1962).[12][18] In 1968 Lady Bird Johnson, First 
Lady of the U.S. at the time, commissioned Tiffany to design a White House 
china-service that featured 90 flowers.[19][20] In November 1978, Tiffany 
& Co. was sold to Avon Products Inc. for about US$104 million in stock. 
However, in a 1984 Newsweek article, the Fifth Avenue Tiffany store was 
likened to the Macy's department store during a white sale due to the high 
number of inexpensive items on sale;[10] furthermore, customers complained 
about declining quality and service. In August 1984, Avon sold Tiffany 
to an investor group led by William R. Chaney for US$135.5 million in cash. 
Tiffany went public again in 1987 and raised about US$103.5 million from 
the sale of 4.5 million shares of common stock.[10] Due to the 1990–1991 
recession in the United States, Tiffany commenced an emphasis upon mass 
merchandising. A new campaign was launched that stressed how Tiffany could 
be affordable for all; for example, the company advertised that the price 
of diamond engagement rings started at US$850. “How to Buy a Diamond” brochures 
were sent to 40,000 people who called a toll-free number specifically set 
up to target the broader population.[10] However, to maintain its image 
as a luxury goods company, high-style images remained on display in Tiffany 
stores.[10] In 2000, The Tiffany & Company Foundation was established to 
provide grants to nonprofit organizations working in the areas of the environment 
and the arts.[21] In June 2004, Tiffany sued EBay, claiming that the latter 
was making profits from the sale of counterfeit Tiffany products;[22] however, 
Tiffany lost both at trial and on appeal.[23] On January 28, 2008, a collaboration 
between the Japanese mobile-phone operator SoftBank and Tiffany & Co. was 
announced. The two companies designed a cellphone, limited to ten copies, 
and containing more than 400 diamonds, totaling more than 20 carats (4.0 g). 
Each cellphone cost more than 100,000,000 yen (£781,824).[24] A media report 
in early July 2013 revealed that former Tiffany & Company vice president 
Ingrid Lederhaas-Okun had been arrested and charged with stealing more 
than $US1.3 million of diamond bracelets, drop earrings, and other jewellery. 
According to prosecutors from Manhattan, U.S., the official charges filed 
against Ms. Lederhaas-Okun accused her of "wire fraud and interstate transportation 
of stolen property."[25] Since 1940, Tiffany's flagship store has operated 
at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan, New York City, 
U.S. The polished granite exterior is well known for its window displays, 
and the store has been the location for a number of films, including Breakfast 
at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn, and Sweet Home Alabama, starring 
Reese Witherspoon. The former Tiffany and Company Building on 37th Street 
is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.[26] When it opened 
in 1990, the Tiffany & Co. store at Fairfax Square in Tysons Corner, Virginia, 
U.S. became the largest outside of New York City, with 14,500 sq ft (1,350 m2) 
of retail space.[27] In the United Kingdom (UK), Tiffany stores are located 
in Terminal 5, at London's Heathrow airport (opened at the end of March 
2008), in the Westfield London shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush, and 
in Old Bond Street, opposite the entrance to Burlington Gardens. A flagship 
Irish store was opened in Brown Thomas on Dublin's Grafton Street in October 
2008 and is the largest of the company's European outlets. Also in October 
2008, Tiffany's opened a store in Madrid, Spain, and brought the Tiffany 
Yellow Diamond (pictured at right) to the opening.[citation needed] In 
Australia, Tiffany & Company's flagship store is located on Collins Street 
in Melbourne. Other stores include Chadstone Shopping Centre (Melbourne); 
Sydney (Castlereagh Street, Westfield Bondi Junction and DFS Galleria on 
George Street); Brisbane (Queens Plaza); and Perth (King Street).[citation 
needed] On March 8, 2001, Tiffany's launched its first Latin American store 
in São Paulo, Brazil, located in the Iguatemi São Paulo shopping center.[28] 
The company opened a second store in the city on October 20, 2003,[29] 
near the famous Oscar Freire Street. The last store opened was Curitiba 
in September 2013, now Tiffany has stores in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, 
Brasília e Curitiba. In 2004, Tiffany & Company created "Iridesse", a chain 
of stores dedicated to pearl-only jewelry. The company operated 16 stores 
in Florida, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, 
and Virginia. However, the chain operated at a loss since its founding 
and the company announced in early 2009 that, despite its continued belief 
in the concept, it would discontinue Iridesse due to the economic climate 
of the time.[30] Tiffany & Co. reported in 2006 that its location at South 
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, U.S. was its most profitable location, 
followed by the New York City flagship store, the Boston, Massachusetts 
outlet in Copley Place, and the Ala Moana Shopping Center in Honolulu, 
Hawaii.[citation needed] Tiffany & Co. announced its second store opening 
at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in September 2007 to 
coincide with the shopping mall's opening. The store consists of 1,700 sq ft 
(160 m2) retail space and features the same decor elements as the New York 
City flagship store. Later that year, other stores were opened in the U.S., 
such as the Natick Collection in Natick, Massachusetts, U.S., which opened 
in September 2007, and Mohegan Sun Erika's casino in Connecticut, U.S, 
and the Providence Place mall in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S., both of 
which opened in November 2007.[citation needed] As of January 31, 2007, 
the company operated 64 Tiffany & Company. stores in the U.S., with a total 
physical area of approximately 486,000 gross square feet, as well as 103 
international stores that measure approximately 306,000 gross square feet 
in total. The company's expansion continued in 2011 with the opening of 
a store at the Multiplaza complex in Escazú, Costa Rica[citation needed] 
and a Richmond, Virginia, U.S. location in Stony Point Fashion Park on 
September 9, 2011.[citation needed] In November 2012, the company operated 
in 22 countries and its worldwide net sales reached US$3.6 billion in 2011. 
Over 50% of the company's 2011 sales occurred in the U.S.[31] As of January 
31, 2014, the company operated 121 stores in the Americas, 72 in Asia-Pacific, 
54 in Japan, 37 in Europe and 5 in "emerging markets". The 298[32] stores 
have 1,165,700 gross retail square footage. The company's flagship store 
in New York had 45,500 gross retail square footage and accounted for 8% 
of the company's net sales in the latest fiscal year ended January 31, 
2014.[4] The company plans to continue expanding in 2014 with the opening 
of a flagship store at the Centro Andino complex in Bogota, Colombia The 
company's manufacturing facilities produce approximately 60% of the merchandise 
sold[citation needed]—the balance, including rose-gold and almost all non-jewelry 
items, coming from third parties overseas. Tiffany's oversees a significant 
U.S. manufacturing base, with jewelry and silver goods produced in Mount 
Vernon, New York; majority in Cumberland, Rhode Island; and Lexington, 
Kentucky, while silver hollow-ware is produced in Rhode Island. The company's 
other subsidiaries, located in facilities outside the U.S., process, cut 
and polish the diamonds. The company may increase the percentage of internally 
manufactured jewelry in the future, but it is not expected[by whom?] that 
Tiffany will ever manufacture all of its needs. Some of the key factors 
which management considered[when?] prior to its decision to outsource manufacturing 
included: product quality; gross margin; access to or mastery of various 
jewelry-making skills and technology; support for alternative capacity; 
and the cost of capital investments.[33] After the initial "Blue Book" 
Tiffany catalog was published in 1845, Tiffany continued to use its catalog 
as an advertisement strategy. The Tiffany catalog is one of the first catalogs 
to be printed in full color and was free until 1972. Tiffany's mail-order 
catalogs reached 15 million people in 1994. Tiffany also produces a corporate 
gift catalog each year, and corporate customers purchase Tiffany products 
for business gift-giving, employee service and achievement recognition 
awards, and customer incentives. Tiffany still produces a catalog for subscribers, 
but its advertisement strategy is no longer focused primarily on its catalog.[7] 
In addition to the mail-order catalog, Tiffany displays its advertisements 
in many locations, including bus stops, in magazines and newspapers, and 
online. Tiffany routinely places ads in Vanity Fair, The New York Times 
Magazine, Architectural Digest, Money, Conde Nast Traveler, Black Enterprise, 
and Texas Monthly.[citation needed] With the advent of new technologies, 
Tiffany places banner advertisements in the New York Times' mobile app 
for the iPhone, whereby the user can download the Tiffany app free of charge.[34][35] 
In January 2015 they launched their first ever same-sex couple campaign. 
George Frederick Kunz, a Tiffany’s gemologist, was instrumental in the 
international adoption of the metric carat as a weight standard for gems, 
and the Tiffany standard for sterling and platinum have been adopted as 
U.S. standards.[citation needed] The 128.54 carats (25.708 g) Tiffany Yellow 
Diamond is usually on display in the New York City flagship store.[citation 
needed] Tiffany designs were worn by famous U.S. families such as the Astors, 
Vanderbilts, Posts, Huttons and Morgans. Athletes, Hollywood stars, and 
European royalty were also Tiffany customers. However, like other similar 
diamond retailers, Tiffany's enacts a strict policy against the repurchasing 
of diamonds sold from its stores. In 1978, a female customer in New York 
City was denied after she attempted to sell back a diamond ring she had 
bought from Tiffany two years earlier for US$100,000. Writing for The Atlantic 
publication in 1982, Edward Jay Epstein explained the rationale for such 
a policy: Retail jewelers, especially the prestigious Fifth Avenue stores, 
prefer not to buy back diamonds from customers, because the offer they 
would make would most likely be considered ridiculously low ... Most jewelers 
would prefer not to make a customer an offer that might be deemed insulting 
and also might undercut the widely held notion that diamonds go up in value. 
Moreover, since retailers generally receive their diamonds for engagement 
rings from wholesalers on consignment, and need not pay for them until 
they are sold, they would not readily risk their own cash to buy diamonds 
from customers. Rather than offer customers a fraction of what they paid 
for diamonds, retail jewelers almost invariably recommend to their clients 
firms that specialize in buying diamonds "retail."[36] In November 2012, 
Tiffany & Co. negotiated a three-year contract to purchase diamonds from 
Russia's ALROSA for US$60 million annually. At the time of the ALROSA deal, 
the company held contracts with diamond mines in Australia, Botswana, Canada, 
Namibia, Russia, Sierra Leone, and South Africa.[31][37] Tiffany offers 
jewelry incorporating a wide variety of colored gemstones including gems 
it played a role in popularizing such as tsavorite,[38] Kunzite, and morganite. 
In February 2015, a turquoise and aquamarine bib designed by Francesca 
Amfitheatrof, Tiffany’s design director, worn by Cate Blanchett at the 
2015 Academy Awards, contrasted favorably with the white–diamond encrusted 
jewelry worn by other stars.[32] In the late 1980s, Tiffany & Co. ventured 
into the fragrance business. Tiffany for women was launched in 1987, a 
floral perfume for women by perfumer Francois Demachy. At $220 per ounce, 
"Tiffany" was successfully marketed by major department stores across the 
United States.[39] Two years later, Tiffany for Men was launched in 1989 
and developed by perfumer Jacques Polge. The bottle for both the men's 
and women's fragrance were designed by Pierre Dinand. In 1995, Tiffany 
launched Trueste perfume for women which was later discontinued. Currently, 
Tiffany continues to produce the core fragrance product for men and the 
product for women. Tiffany's is the maker of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, 
made annually to be awarded to the NFL team that wins the Super Bowl that 
year.[40] Tiffany & Co. is the maker of the Larry O' Brien Trophy. The 
trophy that is given to the winner of the NBA Finals. Tiffany & Co. Has 
been manufacturing the trophies since 1977. Tiffany & Co. also made the 
2010 and 2012 World Series rings for the San Francisco Giants.[41] The 
MLS championship trophy was also made by Tiffany & Co.[42] The NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series' Sprint Cup trophy is also made by Tiffany & Co. and is given 
to the champion every year, the most recent being given to 2015 champion 
Kyle Busch and 2014 champion Kevin Harvick and Stewart-Haas Racing. The 
final ten races of the season are known as the "Chase for the Sprint Cup" 
as they try to get as many points in ten races as possible. The Detroit 
Gold Cup trophy made originally by Tiffany & Co. in 1904, is awarded annually 
to the champion of the Detroit Gold Cup H1 Unlimited hydroplane race. A 
£10,000 Rugby League World Cup trophy was made by Tiffanys to celebrate 
the centenary of Rugby league.[43] NFL: AFC, NFC, Vince Lombardi, Pete
