William Nuschler "Will" Clark, Jr. (born March 13, 1964) is a former first 
baseman in Major League Baseball best known for his years with the San 
Francisco Giants from 1986 to 1993. Clark was known by the nickname of 
"Will the Thrill." The nickname has often been truncated to simply, "The 
Thrill."[1] After a sensational career at Jesuit High School in New Orleans, 
Clark attended Mississippi State University, where he continued to flourish. 
Clark was inducted into the Mississippi State University Hall of Fame in 
2003.[2] Clark was inducted into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. 
He was inducted into the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on April 26, 2007[3][4] 
and the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame on August 1, 2008.[5] He currently 
works in the San Francisco Giants front office[6] after spending five seasons 
as an advisor for the Arizona Diamondbacks.[7] Clark played a starring 
role for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team that yielded such future major leaguers 
as Barry Larkin and Mark McGwire. During the five-game Olympic tournament, 
Clark led the team in batting average (.429), hits (9), runs batted in 
(8) and tied for the team lead in home runs (3). Playing for Mississippi 
State University, Clark was noted for his oft-imitated "sweet swing," said 
to be among the best in baseball. In 1985, The Sporting News named Clark 
an All-American and he later won the Golden Spikes Award from USA Baseball 
as the best amateur baseball player in the country. A teammate of Rafael 
Palmeiro, the two were known as "Thunder and Lightning."[8] Clark and Palmeiro 
were known to dislike each other, dating back to their time at Mississippi 
State.[9] Clark was drafted with the second overall pick in the 1985 Major 
League Baseball draft by the San Francisco Giants.[10] In his inaugural 
major league at-bat on April 8, 1986, Clark debuted with a home run—off 
future Hall of Fame member Nolan Ryan.[10] A few days later, Clark also 
homered in his first home game at Candlestick Park (he debuted at age 22, 
wearing the number 22, playing first base). An elbow injury cost Clark 
47 games in his rookie season.[10] Clark finished his rookie year with 
a respectable .287 batting average. Over the next six seasons, Clark would 
establish himself as the premier first baseman in the National League. 
In his first full season in 1987, Clark had a .308 batting average. Clark 
was voted the starting first baseman for the NL All-Star team every season 
from 1988 through 1992. In 1988, Clark was the first Giants' player to 
drive in 90 or more runs in consecutive seasons since Bobby Murcer from 
1975-1976. His finest season was in 1989, when he batted .333 (losing the 
batting title to Tony Gwynn on the final day of the season) with 111 RBI. 
Clark finished second in the NL Most Valuable Player voting to Giants teammate 
Kevin Mitchell. In 1989, Clark and the Giants defeated the Chicago Cubs 
in the National League Championship Series. In Game 1, Clark had already 
hit a solo home run. Prior to a subsequent at-bat, Cubs' catcher Rick Wrona 
went to the mound to discuss with Greg Maddux how to pitch to Clark. From 
the on-deck circle, Clark watched the conversation and read Greg Maddux's 
lips saying "fastball high, inside." The first pitch was a fastball high 
and inside which Clark sent into the street beyond right field for a grand 
slam. Afterwards, pitchers began to cover their mouths with their gloves 
when having conversations on the pitcher's mound.[11] (The Chicago Tribune's 
front page the next day paid tribute to his performance with a headline 
of "Clark's night on Addison.")[12] In Game 5 of the series, Clark faced 
Cubs closer Mitch Williams with the score 1-1 in the bottom of the eighth 
inning. After an epic at-bat, with several two-strike foul balls keeping 
the duel alive for several minutes, Clark singled to center field to drive 
in two runs, breaking the tie, eventually sending the Giants to the World 
Series. Clark's efforts, which included a .650 batting average and two 
home runs, resulted in him being named NLCS MVP. The Giants went on to 
face the Oakland Athletics in the 1989 World Series, but were swept. In 
the only World Series appearance of his career, Clark failed to contribute 
significantly at the plate, finishing with no runs batted in and a .250 
batting average while battling tonsillitis.[13] Clark had become a very 
durable player since his rookie year injury, setting a San Francisco record 
with 320 consecutive games played from September 1987 through August 1989.[10] 
However, a string of injuries reduced his playing time in the early 1990s 
and diminished his production. Clark drove in just 73 runs in 1992, the 
lowest total since his rookie year.[14] Clark's contract with the Giants 
expired after the 1993 season. The Texas Rangers signed Clark to replace 
his former Mississippi State teammate, Rafael Palmeiro, at first base. 
Clark made the American League All-Star team in 1994[14] and finished the 
season with a .329 batting average, the second-highest of his career. He 
maintained a high level of offensive production throughout his tenure with 
Texas, finishing below .300 only in 1996. Injuries limited his playing 
time to 123, 117 and 110 games from 1995 through 1997, but Clark led the 
Rangers to American League West Division titles in 1996 and 1998. Clark 
struggled offensively in both the 1996 and 1998 postseasons, though he 
put together his most productive regular season in seven years in 1998 
(.305, 23 HRs, 41 2Bs, 102 RBIs). Following the 1998 season, the Rangers 
re-signed Rafael Palmeiro, effectively ending Clark's days with the team. 
Clark signed a two-year deal with the Orioles before the 1999 season, again 
replacing Palmeiro, who had left Baltimore to return to Texas. Clark spent 
nearly two years with Baltimore but was plagued by injuries. On June 15, 
Clark got his 2000th hit versus the Kansas City Royals. Clark was traded 
to the St. Louis Cardinals near the end of the 2000 season, acquired in 
part to play in place of the injured Mark McGwire. A rejuvenated Clark 
(.964 OPS) helped the Cardinals defeat the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS. 
In the NLCS, the Cardinals faced the New York Mets, who would go on to 
win the pennant. Clark performed better in these playoffs. After announcing 
that his retirement would come when the Cardinals' playoff run ended, Clark 
went 1 for 3 in his final game on October 16, 2000. Clark was inducted 
into the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. He was inducted into the 
Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame on April 26, 2007[3][4] and the Mississippi 
Sports Hall of Fame on August 1, 2008.[5] Clark has final statistics of 
284 home runs, 1205 RBI, a .303 batting average, and a .881 OPS. In 2006 
Hall of Fame balloting, Clark received 23 votes, 4.4% of the total, which 
withdrew him from consideration from future ballots, as he did not receive
