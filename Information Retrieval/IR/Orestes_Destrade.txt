Orestes Cucuas Destrade (born May 8, 1962), is a former professional baseball 
infielder. He's now a broadcaster for the Tampa Bay Rays. Destrade was 
born in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba,[1] but emigrated to the United States with 
his family at the age of six. During his youth, he played Khoury League 
at Tamiami Park in Miami. He graduated from Coral Park High School in Miami. 
He later attended Florida College. After college, he played many seasons 
in the minor leagues before his career at the major league level. Destrade 
was called up in September 1987 with the New York Yankees. He played in 
1988 with the Pittsburgh Pirates (where he was the victim of pitcher Randy 
Johnson's first major league strikeout), and 1993 and 1994 for the Florida 
Marlins. Destrade was a member of the Florida Marlins' 1993 inaugural season. 
Destrade played five seasons (1989–1992 and 1995) for the Seibu Lions of 
the Japanese Pacific League, where he led the league in home runs for three 
consecutive years. He was also the MVP of the 1990 Japan Series. Despite 
his short career in Japan, Destrade is considered one of NPB's best career 
switch-hitters.[citation needed] Destrade appeared on ESPN's Baseball Tonight. 
He provided color commentary for the 2006 World Baseball Classic and broadcast 
again with the 2009 World Baseball Classic for ESPN. He helped broadcast 
the 2007, 2008 & 2009 Little League World Series. Until April 2007 he was 
co-host of XM Radio's Baseball This Morning show on MLB Home Plate, XM 
channel 175, along with Buck Martinez and Mark Patrick. Destrade also worked 
as an on-field reporter during the Tampa Bay Rays' 2010 postseason celebration 
after clinching a playoff spot. As of May 2011, he is a contributor to 
Rays radio and TV broadcasts as an analyst. He co-hosts the program Rays 
Live which airs as the pre and post-game analysis. Destrade is notable 
for clutching a baseball during his broadcasts — including radio broadcasts.
