The 1985 Chicago Cubs season was the 114th season of the Chicago Cubs franchise, 
the 110th in the National League and the 70th at Wrigley Field. The Cubs 
finished fourth in the National League East with a record of 77â€“84. The 
season had opened with high hopes as the Cubs had won the NL East title 
the year before. However, injuries were a major factor as four of the Cubs' 
starting pitchers were on the disabled list at the same time. In early 
June, the Cubs were still in first place, battling the St. Louis Cardinals 
and the New York Mets for the division. However, Rick Sutcliffe, Steve 
Trout, Scott Sanderson and Dennis Eckersley all were injured, and the Cubs 
went on a 13-game losing streak that effectively eliminated them from contention. 
Shawon Dunston made his Major League debut. He struggled early on, so the 
Cubs sent him back to Iowa in early May. However, once he returned, it 
spelled the end for Larry Bowa, who was released in August and picked up 
by the New York Mets. Infielders Coaches Note: Pos = Position; G = Games
