Kenneth Raymond Oberkfell (born May 4, 1956) is an American former Major 
League Baseball third baseman. He played from 1977 to 1992 for six different 
teams. Oberkfell primarily played third base but he also played over 400 
career games at second base. After retiring as a player, Oberkfell served 
as a baseball coach. He has primarily coached in the minor leagues, but 
he spent the part of the 2008 as the New York Mets first base coach and 
spent the 2011 season as the Mets bench coach. Signed by the St. Louis 
Cardinals as an amateur free agent in 1975, Oberkfell made his Major League 
Baseball debut with the St. Louis Cardinals on August 22, 1977, and appeared 
in his final game on October 4, 1992. Oberkfell was a member of the 1982 
World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals, hitting .292 in that series. 
Oberkfell was part of the "Bearded Braves" triumvirate along with Glenn 
Hubbard and Bruce Sutter. He told Neil Holfeld of the Houston Chronicle 
in a May 17, 1985 story that, "the beards make us stand out from the clean 
cut Dale Murphy types. Consider us a modern era House of David team."[citation

a successful managerial career that saw him named Minor League Manager 
of the Year by Baseball America in 2005. He also served as the manager 
of the New Orleans Zephyrs from January 4, 2007 until June 17, 2008, when 
he was promoted to the Mets as their first base coach, replacing Tom Nieto. 
During 2009 and 2010, Oberkfell managed the Mets' Triple-A farm team, the 
Buffalo Bisons.[1] On January 28, 2010, Oberkfell led the Leones del Escogido 
to their 13th championship in the Dominican Baseball Winter League as their

2010.[2] He was named the New York Mets bench coach for the 2011 season,[3] 
but was not hired back for 2012.[4] Oberkfell served as the manager of 
the Newark Bears of the independent Can-Am League during the 2012 season 
before stepping down in August. Oberfell managed the Leones del Escogido 
of the Dominican Republic to the Caribbean Series championship title in
