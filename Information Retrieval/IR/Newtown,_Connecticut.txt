Newtown is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. It is 
part of the greater Danbury metropolitan area as well as the New York metropolitan 
area. Newtown was founded in 1705 and later incorporated in 1711. As of 
the 2010 census, its population was 27,560.[1] In 1705, English colonists 
purchased the Town site from the Pohtatuck Indians, a branch of the Pasgussett. 
It was originally known as Quanneapague. Settled by migrants from Stratford 
and incorporated in 1711, Newtown residents had many business and trading 
ties with the English. It was a stronghold of Tory sentiment during the 
early Revolutionary War. Late in the war, French General Rochambeau and 
his troops encamped here in 1781 during their celebrated march on their 
way to the siege of Yorktown, Virginia, which ended the Revolution.[citation

of Hawleyville briefly emerged as a railroad center. The town's population 
grew to over 4,000 circa 1881. In the following decades, the population 
dwindled to a low of 2,635 in 1930 before again growing.[citation needed] 
Local industry has included the manufacture of furniture, tea bags, combs, 
fire hoses, folding boxes, buttons, and hats, as well as farming, and mica 
and feldspar mining. The game of "Scrabble" was developed here by James 
Brunot.[3] From the period of highway development and suburbanization following 
World War II, the town has developed as a suburb of Danbury, with many 
people also commuting to Norwalk, Stamford, and Bridgeport. In November 
1986, Helle Crafts was killed by her husband Richard Crafts in the infamous 
"Woodchipper Murder". On December 14, 2012[update], Adam Lanza shot his 
mother at home and then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School where he killed 
26 people (20 children and 6 faculty and staff) before killing himself.[4] 
The northeastern border of the town is a natural border that follows the 
Housatonic River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town 
has a total area of 59.1 square miles (153 km2), of which 57.8 square miles 
(150 km2) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.4 km2), or 2.22%, is water. Newtown 
is located in northern Fairfield County, about 45 miles (72 km) southwest 
of Hartford and about 42 miles (68 km) northeast of New York City.[5] The 
state's fifth largest town in area, it is bordered by Bethel, Bridgewater, 
Brookfield, Easton, Monroe, Oxford, Redding and Southbury. As of the census 
of 2000, there were 25,031 people, 8,325 households, and 6,776 families 
residing in the town. The population density was 433.4 people per square 
mile (167.3/km²). There were 8,601 housing units at an average density 
of 148.9 per square mile (57.5/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 
95.14% White, 1.75% Black or African American, 0.14% Native American, 1.40% 
Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.64% from other races, and 0.89% from two 
or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.36% of the population. 
There were 8,325 households out of which 44.7% had children under the age 
of 18 living with them, 73.3% were married couples living together, 5.8% 
had a female householder with no husband present, and 18.6% were non-families. 
14.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 5.8% had someone

was 2.90 and the average family size was 3.24. In the town the population 
was spread out with 29.3% under the age of 18, 4.4% from 18 to 24, 32.5% 
from 25 to 44, 25.1% from 45 to 64, and 8.7% who were 65 years of age or 
older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 104.9 
males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.5 males. The 
median income for a household in the town was $90,193, and the median income

respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $68,965 
versus $42,217 for females. The per capita income for the town was $37,786. 
About 2.2% of families and 3.1% of the population were below the poverty 
line, including 3.0% of those under age 18 and 3.9% of those age 65 or 
over. The town of Newtown offers many programs for area residents. Numerous 
parks and fields offer playgrounds, swimming, tennis, softball, baseball, 
volleyball, lacrosse, soccer, as well as a nature center and trails. Prominent 
Newtown parks include Treadwell Park, Dickinson Park, and Collis P. Huntington 
State Park. Treadwell Park, named after former selectman Timothy Treadwell, 
contains recreation facilities and the town pool. Dickinson park used to 
contain a swimming pool, which was a large asphalt-lined bowl-shaped depression 
surrounded by a grass "beach". It was a uniquely safe design for children 
because there was no "deep end"; however, it lacked a formal filtration 
system and required attendants to periodically row out and manually add 
chlorine to the water. The asphalt was removed and the pond pool filled 
with earth in 2006. In Connecticut politics, the town of Newtown is required 
to have both a Democratic and a Republican Town Committee.[7][8] The Town 
Committee members vote on which candidates to endorse for public elections. 
Elected to a two-year term, the Board of Selectmen supervise the administration 
of the affairs of the town, except those matters which by the General Statute 
or Town Charter are exclusively committed to the Board of Education or 
other departments. They are led by a First Selectman, who is the Chief 
Executive and Administrative Officer of the town. The Board of Selectmen 
with the assistance of the departments and boards and commission prepares 
the annual budget in February. The Legislative Council of 12 members (elected 
to the same two year terms) acts as the Board of Finance and passes ordinances. 
The Council recommends the annual education and general government budget 
to the towns people. The old fashion town meeting and referendum are used 
to pass the budget. These procedures are set forth in the Town Charter 
adopted and reviewed by the citizens. The Borough of Newtown occupies about 
1,252 acres (5.07 km2) (or roughly two square miles) in the central part 
of town. Incorporated in 1824 by an act of the Connecticut General Assembly, 
it is one of only nine boroughs in the state. The borough adopted zoning 
for the town center long before the rest of the community. The lot sizes 
are smaller than the minimum 1-acre (4,000 m2) lots of the rest of the 
community. The borough also has running public water provided by a small 
town water company.[clarification needed] Much of the borough is sewered, 
whereas most of the rest of the town has wells and septic systems.[9] The 
Newtown Police Department has existed since 1970. It is located on 3 Main 
Street near Rams Pasture, the park used for town celebrations. The police 
chief is James Viadero and the commander of the department is Joe Rios.[10] 
The department has 45 sworn officers in uniform.[11] Newtown has a number 
of local landmarks. The flagpole, first erected in 1876, now stands in 
the center of Main Street. The Newtown Bee, the local weekly newspaper, 
has been serving the area since 1877, and has been owned and operated by 
the Smith family since 1881. Across from the flagpole is Newtown Meeting 
House, which served as the town's Congregational church for many years. 
The rooster weather vane (a town symbol), located atop the meeting house, 
is said to have been used as a target by French soldiers encamped here 
in 1781 during the Revolutionary War. Hawley School is a landmark constructed 
in the 1920s. It has been used as a whole-town school, a high school, and 
an elementary school. It is currently used as an elementary school. Though 
it has served many different school functions, its original section has 
remained much the same. Two additions have been added. Newtown is the site 
of the Fairfield Hills State Hospital, an asylum constructed in the 1930s 
and closed in 1995. The hospital was used as the set of the juvenile facility 
in the film Sleepers in 1995. In the 21st century, Newtown purchased the 
property and, as of 2007, was considering a controversial plan for redevelopment. 
In 2008, the NYA (Newtown Youth Academy) began to operate there; extracurricular 
amenities include a fitness section, basketball courts, and a turf field. 
Constructed in 1930 by a private benefactress for the community, the Town 
Hall is used for public-private purposes. Offices for the town are located 
there. The facility also has available for private rental the Alexandria 
Room for weddings, parties and recitals; and smaller meeting rooms that 
can be reserved by community groups. A gymnasium is used for community 
sports events, as well as private parties, and art or craft shows. The 
Edmond Town hall is notable for its cinema. The theater shows popular films 
shortly after they leave mainstream theaters. It is the only $2 film theater 
in Connecticut. It is a popular spot for middle school and high school 
students. The "Live at the Edmond Town Hall" concert series was created 
by Newtown resident Hayden Bates in 2009. All proceeds are put towards 
aiding the Edmond's theater upgrades. Headliners have included The Low 
Anthem, The Bill Frisell and Sam Amidon Duo, Brown Bird and Phosphorescent. 
The Board of Managers of the Hall is composed of six members serving six-year 
terms. At each regular Town Election, two members are elected, who must 
represent different political parties. According to Town Charter, the Board 
"shall have the exclusive care and maintenance of Edmond Town Hall and 
all grounds and buildings appurtenant thereto, together with all powers 
and duties prescribed for said Board by Special Act No. 98 of the 1931 
session by which it was created, as amended by Special Act No. 517 of the 
1953 session". The architect was Philip Sutherland, who also designed Cyrenius 
H. Booth Library. The Town Hall was constructed for the community by a 
local benefactress Mary Elizabeth Hawley and dedicated in 1930. The building 
was named for Miss Hawley’s maternal great-grandfather Judge William Edmond. 
Newtown's public library was opened December 17, 1932, with a capacity 
for 25,000 volumes. The library is a posthumous gift of Mary Elizabeth 
Hawley. She named it for her maternal grandfather, a doctor in town from 
1820 until his death in 1871. Hawley's gift paid for construction of the 
building, and an endowment, a trust fund of about $250,000. As a result, 
the town did not have to provide any financial support to the library until 
the 1980s.[12] Designed by Philip Sutherland, the building was considered 
one of the most modern libraries of its time, with several innovative features. 
The building was fireproof, had cork floors and acoustic ceiling tiles 
to deaden sound, and had a built-in humidifying unit and a centralized 
vacuum cleaner.[12] In January 1998 an addition to the rear of the building 
was completed and officially opened. The expansion doubled the available 
floor space. It provides areas for meetings and displays of art and local 
historical artifacts from the library's large collection.[12] Of the residents 
of Newtown, many commute to jobs in Manhattan, Hartford, and Stamford.[13] 
One portion of Newtown has many white collar workers who are employed at 
General Electric, IBM, Pepsi, and other companies; and doctors.[14] According 
to the Newtown Connecticut Economic Development Commission, the top employers 
in the Newtown and Sandy Hook area are:[15] The Newtown Public Schools 
district operates four elementary schools (Hawley Elementary School, Head 
O'Meadow Elementary School, Middle Gate Elementary School, and Sandy Hook 
Elementary School) that serve grades K-4, Reed Intermediate School serving 
grades 5–6, Newtown Middle School serving grades 7–8, and Newtown High 
School serving grades 9–12.[16] Newtown also has several private and parochial 
schools, including St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic School, the Fraser-Woods 
Montessori School, and the Housatonic Valley Waldorf School.[17] In 2010, 
six educators made the top salary list in Newtown, Connecticut.[18] Notable 
residents have included James Purdy, who ministered to smallpox victims 
during the American Civil War;[19] Mary Elizabeth Hawley, Newtown's benefactress;[20] 
Joseph F. Engelberger, an engineer and entrepreneur who is often credited 
with being the "Father of Robotics" – the Robotics Industries Association 
annually presents the Joseph F. Engelberger Awards to "persons who have 
contributed outstandingly to the furtherance of the science and practice 
of robotics."; and Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce),[a] 1976 Summer Olympics 
decathlon gold medalist, attended Newtown High School. This list includes 
individuals who were born, died, resided (for all or part of their lives), 
worked, and/or attended school in Newtown, CT or one of its communities.
