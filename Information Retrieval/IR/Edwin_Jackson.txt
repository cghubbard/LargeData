Edwin Jackson (born September 9, 1983) is an American professional baseball 
pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Tampa Bay Devil Rays / Rays, Detroit Tigers, 
Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, St. Louis Cardinals, Washington 
Nationals, Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins and San Diego Padres. 
Jackson was an All-Star in 2009 and threw a no-hitter on June 25, 2010. 
Jackson's father, Edwin Jackson, Sr., a United States Army cook, was stationed 
in West Germany at the time of his birth. Jackson is one of 27 major league 
players who were born in Germany. He spent three of the first eight years 
of his life in Germany until spending the rest of his youth in Columbus, 
Georgia.[1][2] Jackson attended Shaw High School in Columbus, Georgia from 
1997–2001. While attending Shaw High School, Jackson played outfield for 
the Raider baseball team. His senior year, Jackson helped lead the Raiders 
baseball team to the 2001 GHSA AAAA State Championship title over Columbus 
High School in Columbus, Georgia. Jackson was drafted by the Dodgers in 
the sixth round of the 2001 MLB entry draft.[3][4] He was originally drafted 
as an outfielder but the Dodgers converted him into a pitcher.[4] There 
was a time when Jackson was regarded as one of the premiere pitching prospects 
in baseball (after posting sub-4.00 ERAs in AA and the majors at age 19 
in 2003), but poor showings in AAA and MLB after that season ended his 
status as a "can't-miss" prospect.[citation needed] He made his major league 
debut on September 9, 2003, his 20th birthday. In that game, he pitched 
6 innings, giving up just one run and out-pitched Cy Young Award winner 
Randy Johnson to earn his first career major league victory. On January 
14, 2006, Jackson and left-handed pitcher Chuck Tiffany were traded to 
Tampa Bay for pitchers Danys Báez and Lance Carter.[5] In 2006, Jackson 
pitched in 23 games, mostly in middle relief, and posted a 5.45 ERA in 
36⅓ innings. In 2007, Jackson became a full-time starter for the Rays. 
He began the season poorly, going 1–9 with a 7.23 ERA in 17 games over 
74⅔ innings. Jackson managed to rebound somewhat after the All-Star break, 
posting a 4–6 record and a 4.48 ERA over 15 games, all of them starts. 
His season highlight came in a start against the Texas Rangers on August 
11, in which he recorded a shutout, allowing only four hits and one walk 
while striking out eight. Jackson finished the season with a 5–15 record 
and an ERA of 5.76. In 2008, Jackson assumed the number four spot in the 
Rays' starting rotation out of spring training. He finished the season 
with a 4.42 ERA. Jackson tied with James Shields to lead the Rays with 
14 victories, which also tied the record for most wins by a Rays pitcher.[6] 
On December 10, 2008, Jackson was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange 
for outfielder Matt Joyce.[7][8] Jackson made his Tigers debut on April 
7, 2009, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He allowed one run in 7⅓ innings, 
and received a no decision in Detroit's 5–4 loss.[9] He earned his first 
victory with Detroit on April 18 against the Seattle Mariners, pitching 
7⅔ scoreless innings.[10] Jackson was selected to represent Detroit in 
the 2009 All-Star Game along with teammates Curtis Granderson, Justin Verlander, 
and Brandon Inge. He pitched a scoreless fifth inning for the AL, retiring 
Yadier Molina, Ryan Zimmerman, and Hanley Ramírez on four pitches.[11][12] 
At of the end of July, opposing batters were hitting .216 against him, 
which was the lowest batting average in the league; he was followed by 
Matt Garza (.222), Jarrod Washburn (.224), and Scott Feldman (.228). On 
December 9, 2009 Jackson was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks as part 
of a three team trade that brought Austin Jackson, Phil Coke, Max Scherzer, 
and Daniel Schlereth to the Tigers.[13] Jackson hit his second Major League 
home run off Jack Taschner against the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 11, 
2010. On June 25, 2010, Jackson no-hit his former team, the Tampa Bay Rays, 
1–0, at Tropicana Field,[14] becoming the first pitcher to no-hit a former 
team since Philadelphia Phillie Terry Mulholland no-hit the San Francisco 
Giants in 1990. It was only the second no-hitter in Diamondbacks' history, 
the other being Randy Johnson's perfect game on May 18, 2004. He managed 
to get through an astounding 8 walks while still completing the no hitter. 
It was also the fourth of the 2010 season, and the third time the Rays 
had been no-hit in less than 12 months. Jackson had a very rough start 
to the game, walking a total of eight batters as well as hitting B.J. Upton 
with a pitch. Overall, Jackson allowed nine batters on base and got out 
of a bases loaded jam in the 3rd inning. Mark Reynolds, Tony Abreu, and 
Adam LaRoche (whose second-inning home run accounted for the game's only 
run) helped Jackson as they provided impressive defense. He threw 149 pitches 
in the entire game.[15] Jackson became the first German-born pitcher to 
throw a no-hitter, the first African American to do so since Dwight Gooden 
in 1996, and the first African American to do so for a National League 
team since Bob Gibson in 1971.[16] On July 30, 2010, the Diamondbacks traded 
Jackson to the Chicago White Sox for Daniel Hudson and David Holmberg.[17][18] 
When the Diamondbacks traded Jackson to the White Sox he became the first 
pitcher in the Majors to be traded away in the same season that he pitched 
a no-hitter since Cliff Chambers pitched a no-hitter for the Pittsburgh 
Pirates against the Boston Braves in 1951. On July 27, 2011, Jackson was 
traded to the Toronto Blue Jays with Mark Teahen for Jason Frasor and Zach 
Stewart. The Blue Jays then traded Jackson to the St. Louis Cardinals later 
that day, along with Octavio Dotel, Marc Rzepczynski and Corey Patterson 
for Colby Rasmus, P. J. Walters, Trever Miller and Brian Tallet.[19][20][21][22] 
On July 29, 2011, Edwin Jackson pitched his first game as a Cardinal and 
threw 7 strong innings, leading St. Louis to a blowout win over their rivals 
the Chicago Cubs. Over 13 regular-season appearances for St. Louis in 2011, 
Jackson pitched 78 innings in which he struck out 51 batters and walked 
23. He allowed 91 hits and 37 runs (31 earned) to accrue a regular-season 
ERA of 3.58 with the Cardinals. In four postseason starts during St. Louis' 
successful march to the 2011 World Championship, Jackson posted a 5.60 
ERA, issuing 19 hits, nine bases on balls and 11 runs (all earned), including 
four home runs, over 17⅔ innings. Jackson declined a one-year salary arbitration 
offer from the Cardinals for the 2012 season, becoming a free agent in 
December 2011.[23] On February 2, 2012, Jackson agreed to a one-year contract 
with the Nationals. The contract was reported to be worth $11 million and 
to contain incentive bonuses for achievements such as postseason awards.[24][25] 
Jackson went 10–11 with the Nationals with an ERA of 4.03. He became a 
free agent after the Nationals elimination from the playoffs. On January 
2, 2013, Jackson signed a 4-year, $52 million contract with the Chicago 
Cubs.[26] On April 14, he along with Michael Bowden broke the record for 
most wild pitches in an inning, with 5. He finished the year 8–18 with 
a 4.98 ERA. The 2014 season was even more dismal for Jackson. He finished 
the season with a 6–15 record, a 6.33 ERA over 140⅔ IP, and allowed opponents 
a .302 against him. Over the course of his final 9 starts, Jackson posted 
a 1–6 record with a 9.95 ERA. His final start against the Los Angeles Dodgers 
saw him give up 5 earned runs in just ⅔ of an inning, leading to his subsequent 
demotion to the bullpen for the remainder of the year. He finished 2014 
going 6–15 with a 6.33 ERA Jackson entered 2015 competing for a spot in 
the starting rotation with Travis Wood, but lost after giving up 9 earned 
runs in 16.1 innings. He began the season as the long reliever in the Cubs 
bullpen.[27] On July 19, the Cubs designated him for assignment.[28] On 
July 27, the Cubs released Jackson,[29] eating the $13 million remaining 
on his contract.[30] The team also owes him the same amount through the 
2016 season.[31] On August 14, Jackson signed a contract with the Atlanta 
Braves for the remainder of the 2015 season.[32] He made his first appearance 
with the Braves the next day.[33] Jackson recorded his first career save 
in relief of Matt Wisler on October 4, 2015, the final day of the season.[34] 
On January 13, 2016, Jackson signed a one-year contract for $507,500 with 
the Miami Marlins.[35] He was designated for assignment on May 31, 2016, 
when the team activated Mike Dunn from the disabled list. After signing 
a minor-league deal with the Padres in June 2016, Jackson was called up 
and made his first start as a Padre on July 17, 2016.[36] Jackson is one 
of a minority of MLB starting pitchers who relies almost exclusively on 
two pitches, a mid-90s fastball and an effective power slider.[37] His 
four-seam fastball has good velocity, averaging about 95 mph. He also has 
a two-seamer with similar velocity. His primary weapon against right-handed 
hitters is a hard slurve in the upper 80s. Against left-handed hitters, 
he often uses a changeup (85–89) and occasionally a curveball (78–81).[38]
