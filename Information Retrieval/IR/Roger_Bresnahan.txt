As player As manager Roger Philip Bresnahan (June 11, 1879 – December 4, 
1944), nicknamed "The Duke of Tralee", was an American player and manager 
in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a player, Bresnahan competed in MLB 
for the Washington Senators (1897), Chicago Orphans (1900), Baltimore Orioles 
(1901–02), New York Giants (1902–08), St. Louis Cardinals (1909–12) and 
Chicago Cubs (1913–15). Bresnahan also managed the Cardinals (1909–12) 
and Cubs (1915). He was a member of the 1905 World Series champions. Bresnahan 
began his MLB career as a pitcher. He also served as an outfielder, before 
becoming a regular catcher. For his MLB career, Bresnahan had a .279 batting 
average in 4,480 at bats and a 328–432 managerial win-loss record. Bresnahan 
popularized the use of protective equipment in baseball by introducing 
shin guards, to be worn by catchers, in 1907.[1][2] He also developed the 
first batting helmet. After retiring as a player, Bresnahan remained active 
in professional baseball. He owned the minor league Toledo Mud Hens and 
coached for the Giants and Detroit Tigers. He was elected to the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 by the Veterans Committee.[3] Bresnahan was 
born on June 11, 1879 in Toledo, Ohio. He was the seventh child of Michael 
and Mary Bresnahan, who had immigrated to the United States from Tralee, 
Ireland. Bresnahan used to claim that he was also from Tralee, and early 
in his life, he earned the nickname "The Duke of Tralee".[4] Bresnahan 
began playing baseball in grade school, becoming one of the best known 
sandlot baseball players.[5] He continued to play baseball at Toledo's 
Central High School.[6] At 16, Bresnahan signed with a semi-professional 
team from Manistee, Michigan. After he graduated high school, Bresnahan 
signed with Lima of the Ohio State League, where he played primarily as 
a pitcher, but also as a catcher in 1895 and 1896.[5][6] On August 10, 
1897, the Washington Senators of the National League (NL) in Major League 
Baseball (MLB) purchased Bresnahan from Lima. He began his MLB career as 
a pitcher, throwing a six-hit shutout in his MLB debut against the St. Louis 
Browns on August 27, 1897, recording three strikeouts and walking two batters.[5][6] 
He had six hits in 16 at bats (a .375 batting average) and had a 4–0 win–loss 
record for the 1897 Senators. However, the Senators released Bresnahan 
after the season over a salary dispute, when he attempted to hold out for 
more money.[6][7] The Senators offered Bresnahan $2,000 ($56,984 in current 
dollar terms), but Bresnahan wanted $2,400 ($68,381 in current dollar terms).[8] 
Bresnahan played for the Toledo Mud Hens of the Interstate League and the 
Minneapolis Millers of the Western League in 1898, and the Millers and 
Buffalo Bisons of the Western League in 1899. Bresnahan appeared in two 
games at catcher for the Chicago Orphans of the NL in 1900, which served 
as a tryout.[6][7] With the formation of the American League (AL) as a 
competitor to the NL, Bresnahan, among others, jumped to the AL from the 
NL.[9] John McGraw, manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL saw Bresnahan 
pitch for Chicago, and decided to sign him for the Orioles before the 1901 
season. For the Orioles, Bresnahan filled in at catcher behind Wilbert 
Robinson, and also appeared in the outfield. A faster baserunner than the 
average catcher, Bresnahan had two inside-the-park home runs on May 30, 
1902.[8] With the Orioles reportedly in significant debt, part-owner John 
Mahon purchased shares of the team from star players Joe Kelley and John 
McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants 
of the NL, becoming the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, he sold 
his interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the 
Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also 
of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released Bresnahan, Kelley, Joe 
McGinnity, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their contracts. 
Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed 
McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, Gilbert, and McGann, joining McGraw, his 
new player-manager, on the Giants.[10][11] With Frank Bowerman and Jack 
Warner established as the Giants' catchers, McGraw played Bresnahan as 
the center fielder for the Giants.[8] In 1903, Bresnahan batted .350, trailing 
Honus Wagner's .355 average atop the NL.[8] Bresnahan batted .284 in the 
1904 season, playing 96 games in the outfield, ten games at first base, 
four games at shortstop, and one game apiece at second base and third base, 
as the Giants were champions of the NL.[12] Bresnahan shifted to catcher 
full-time in 1905, as Bowerman became less effective and Warner left the 
Giants.[6] Christy Mathewson preferred pitching to Bresnahan.[12] Bresnahan 
caught all five games in the 1905 World Series, including three shutouts 
by Mathewson, and one shutout thrown by Joe McGinnity.[13] Bresnahan led 
the Giants with a .313 batting average in the World Series.[13] Bresnahan 
had a memory almost as good as [Christy] Mathweson or [Joe] McGinnity. 
He never had to be told twice. Once we had discovered a weak spot in the 
opposition and had discussed a plan for attacking it I could depend absolutely 
on Bresnahan to carry it out. He did not forget. His whole mind was concentrated 
on winning that particular game and it was rarely that he overlooked anything. 
On Opening Day in 1907, Bresnahan began to experiment with protective gear. 
Though Negro league catcher Chappie Johnson wore protective gear and Nig 
Clarke wore similar gear in MLB in 1905, most catchers did not wear any 
protective equipment.[15] Bresnahan practiced in shin guards that are worn 
in cricket during spring training, and debuted them on April 11, 1907.[16] 
Fans, used to seeing catchers play without protective equipment, threw 
snowballs on the field, and without police at the game, umpire Bill Klem 
called off the game, with the Giants forfeiting to the Philadelphia Phillies. 
The press also criticized the use of shin guards. However, other catchers 
began to adopt Bresnahan's idea.[17] Though Pittsburgh Pirates manager 
Fred Clarke protested Bresnahan's gear to the league, the protest was denied 
and the equipment was approved. Bresnahan caught a career-high 138 games 
in 1908, batting .283 and leading the NL in walks.[17][18] Bresnahan also 
developed the first batting helmet. He was hit in the head with a pitch 
by Andy Coakley of the Cincinnati Reds on June 18, 1907.[17] Bresnahan 
was unconscious, and a Catholic priest read him his last rites.[17] Bresnahan 
was hospitalized for ten days, during which time he developed schematics 
for a plastic batting helmet, though this piece of equipment did not become 
commonplace until the 1940s.[18] Bresnahan was also the first catcher to 
wear a padded facemask while catching.[17] The Giants obtained younger 
and faster players in 1909; McGraw had Chief Meyers ready to succeed Bresnahan 
at catcher.[18] Stanley Robison of the St. Louis Cardinals became interested 
in hiring Bresnahan to be a player-manager. As McGraw did not want to block 
Bresnahan from the opportunity, the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals 
for Red Murray, Bugs Raymond and Admiral Schlei after the 1908 season.[19] 
Bresnahan led the Cardinals, who won only 49 games in 1908, to 54 wins 
in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910.[18] Attendance increased from 205,000 fans 
in 1908 to 299,000 fans in 1909, and 355,000 fans in 1910.[20] Grateful 
for the improvement at the box office, Robison signed Bresnahan to a five-year 
contract to manage the team for a salary of $10,000 per season ($254,393 
in current dollar terms), plus ten percent of the club's profits.[6] Robison 
died in March 1911, and ownership of the team transferred to Helene Hathaway 
Britton, his niece.[6] On July 11, 1911, with the Cardinals only three 
games out of first place, the team was involved in a train wreck while 
riding the Federal Express from Philadelphia to Boston.[21] Fourteen passengers 
were killed after the train derailed and plunged down an 18-foot (5.5 m) 
embankment outside Bridgeport, Connecticut.[21] None of the Cardinals were 
seriously injured, due to a fortuitous pre-trip change in the location 
of their Pullman car, requested by Bresnahan. The Cardinals helped remove 
bodies and rescue the injured.[21] Bresnahan and Britton feuded publicly 
in 1912, as the Cardinals fell to sixth place in the NL. The Cardinals 
fired Bresnahan after the 1912 season due to various arguments Bresnahan 
had with Britton, including over Bresnahan's desire to sell Miller Huggins 
to another franchise.[22] Britton cited decreased profits as a sign that 
Bresnahan was uninterested in the job.[23] Huggins succeeded Bresnahan 
as Cardinals' manager, as she preferred Huggins' "gentlemanly" manner, 
as opposed to Bresnahan's rougher personality.[24] Brenahan hired an attorney 
to obtain the remainder of his salary.[25] He eventually settled the lawsuit 
against Britton for $20,000 ($491,241 in current dollar terms).[6] Following 
his termination by the Cardinals, the NL declared Bresnahan a free agent. 
He signed a three-year contract with the Cubs, receiving $10,000 ($239,832 
in current dollar terms) per season with a $25,000 signing bonus ($599,579 
in current dollar terms).[6][26] He served as player-manager for the Cubs 
in 1915, but was released when his batting average slipped.[6] As the rival 
Federal League collapsed and the Cubs merged with the Chicago Whales of 
the Federal League, the Cubs decided to replace Bresnahan with Whales manager 
Joe Tinker.[27] The Cubs paid Bresnahan for the remaining two years on 
his contract[28] and aided Bresnahan in purchasing the Toledo Mud Hens, 
then in the American Association, in 1916.[27][29] The club had moved to 
Cleveland to block the Federal League from placing a team there, but returned 
to Toledo under Bresnahan's control.[27] Bresnahan played for the team 
until 1918, when he announced his retirement.[30] He played for a semi-professional 
team in 1919,[30] and appeared in five games for the Mud Hens in 1921.[6] 
Bresnahan worked to add lights to Toledo's stadium, so that they could 
play night games.[31] Bresnahan sold the Mud Hens before the 1924 season.[32] 
McGraw then hired Bresnahan as a coach for the Giants, a position he held 
from 1925 through 1928. He coached for the Detroit Tigers in 1930 and 1931.[6] 
During the offseasons, Bresnahan returned to Toledo. He worked as a hotel 
detective at the Boody House, which he later purchased.[12] Bresnahan lost 
much of his money in the stock market crash of 1929. He worked as a manual 
laborer, as a guard at the Toledo Workhouse, and as a salesman for Toledo's 
Buckeye Brewing Company.[6] Bresnahan ran for sheriff of Lucas County as 
a member of the Democratic Party in 1932.[29] He lost, and endorsed the 
victorious candidate in his reelection bid two years later.[33] Bresnahan 
ran for county commissioner in 1944, winning the Democratic Party nomination, 
but losing in the general election by a few hundred votes out of 140,000 
votes cast.[6][34] Bresnahan died of a heart attack at his home in Toledo 
on December 4, 1944 at the age of 65. He was survived by his wife, Gertrude, 
and his daughter, Marian.[35] He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Toledo.[34] 
In 1,446 games, he had a batting average of .279 in 4,480 at-bats. His 
overall managerial record was 328–432. Miller Huggins named Bresnahan the 
catcher on his all-time team.[36] Bresnahan stood approximately 5 feet 
9 inches (1.75 m).[5] He was described as "highly strung and almost abnormally 
emotional" by a reporter.[7] Bill James wrote that Bresnahan "was one of 
those guys that if you were on his team and played hard he was as nice 
to you as could be, but if you got on his bad side you'd think he was the 
Breath of Hell."[13] Bresnahan was known for baiting umpires. He and McGraw 
were often ejected from games, suspended, and on a few occasions escorted 
from the field by police.[13] A 1911 directive by NL president Thomas Lynch, 
compelling umpires to prevent catchers from antagonizing batters with verbal 
abuse, mentioned only Bresnahan by name.[20] Bresnahan was elected to the 
Hall of Fame the year after his death. He had received 47 votes of the 
226 electors in the 1936 Hall of Fame balloting, and between 43 and 67 
votes each time from 1937 through 1942.[14] In the 1945 balloting, occurring 
one month after Bresnahan's death, he received 133 votes, still falling 
short of enshrinement. However, the Permanent Committee noticed the surge 
in votes and elected him in April 1945.[5] Regarding his Hall of Fame induction, 
James has criticized the election, saying that Bresnahan "wandered in the 
Hall of Fame on a series of miscalculations", and regarding his election, 
that "the Hall of Fame had, for the first time, selected a player who clearly 
had no damn business being there".[34] Bresnahan was mentioned in the poem 
Line-Up for Yesterday by Ogden Nash: Battery mate of Christy Mathewson 
with the New York Giants, he was one of the games most natural players 
and might have starred at any position. The "Duke of Tralee" was one of
