The 1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season was overshadowed by Walter O'Malley's 
threat to move the Dodgers out of Brooklyn if the city did not build him 
a new stadium in that borough. When the best the mayor could promise was 
a stadium in Queens, O'Malley made good on his threats and moved the team 
to Los Angeles after the season ended. The Dodgers final game at Ebbets 
Field was on September 24 as they finished their 68th and last NL season, 
and their 75th overall, in Brooklyn in third place with an 84â€“70 record, 
eleven games behind the NL and World Series Champion Milwaukee Braves. 
During the season, the Dodgers played eight home games at Roosevelt Stadium 
in Jersey City, New Jersey, as part of owner Walter O'Malley's continued 
attempts to pressure Brooklyn to allow him to build a new stadium in his 
preferred location at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues.[2] On July 20, 1957: 
Duke Snider hit the 300th home run of his career. The opposing pitcher 
was Dick Drott.[3] Danny McDevitt was the last pitcher to pitch for the 
Brooklyn Dodgers in a game at Ebbets Field. The game was contested on September 
24, 1957, and McDevitt pitched a complete game. He had nine strikeouts 
while allowing only five hits.[4] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infielders
