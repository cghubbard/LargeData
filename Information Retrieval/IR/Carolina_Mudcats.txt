The Carolina Mudcats are a minor league baseball team based in Zebulon, 
North Carolina. They are members of the Carolina League and are the Class 
A-Advanced affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. They play their home games 
at Five County Stadium. The franchise originated in 1978 as the Kinston 
Eagles of Kinston, North Carolina. In 2012 they relocated to Zebulon amid 
a series of purchases and moves, and took up the name of the previous Carolina 
Mudcats team. The franchise was established in 1978 as the Kinston Eagles 
of the Carolina League. They were known as the Kinston Indians from 1987 
through 2011, and were the Class A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. 
In 2012 they moved to Zebulon, North Carolina as part of a complicated 
series of moves and purchases by Pensacola businessman Quint Studer. Studer 
purchased the existing Carolina Mudcats of the Southern League, relocating 
them to Pensacola as the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. To seal this purchase, 
Quint Studer had to facilitate the move of the Kinston team to Zebulon, 
where they took up the Mudcats name and branding.[1][2] The Mudcats name 
and branding has existed in Zebulon, North Carolina since 1991, but was 
launched in Columbus, Georgia two years prior as the Columbus Mudcats. 
In Zebulon, the AA franchise was first affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates; 
its affiliation eventually passed to the Colorado Rockies, Florida Marlins, 
and Cincinnati Reds with whom the franchise was affiliated when it was 
moved to Pensacola. The single-A Mudcats' initial affiliation with Cleveland 
was inherited from the predecessor Kinston Indians' established relationship 
with the Cleveland club. Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager
