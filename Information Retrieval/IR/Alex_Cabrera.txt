Alexander Alberto Cabrera Suzuki (born December 24, 1971) is a Venezuelan 
first baseman and right-handed batter who played in Major League Baseball 
and Nippon Professional Baseball. He was released by the Fukuoka SoftBank 
Hawks on July 31, 2012 after signing with them prior to the 2011 season.[1] 
He was signed by the Chicago Cubs as an amateur free agent in 1991, and 
moved to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization before the 1998 season. 
He played for CPBL's Koos Group Whales in 1999, and then signed with the 
Arizona Diamondbacks in 2000. After toiling in the minors for nine seasons, 
Cabrera finally got a shot in the majors with the Diamondbacks. A muscular 
slugger (6' 2", 220 lb.), Cabrera hit a home run during his first at-bat. 
He ended the 2000 MLB season with a .262 average, five home runs, 14 RBI, 
10 runs, two doubles, one triple and a .500 slugging percentage in 31 games. 
After the 2000 season, the Seibu Lions of the Japan Pacific League purchased 
his contract from Arizona. In 2001, Cabrera batted .282, with 49 home runs 
and 124 RBI. He was even better in 2002, with a .336, 55, 115 batting line, 
winning the Pacific League's MVP award. His 55 home runs tied Japan's single-season 
record, equaling the mark set by the legendary Sadaharu Oh in 1964 and 
matched by former big leaguer Tuffy Rhodes in 2001. (In 2013, Wladimir 
Balentien, playing for the Yakult Swallows, established a new record with 
60 home runs.) In 2003, Cabrera hit an impressive 50 home runs and produced 
112 RBIs, while batting .324 for Seibu. Injuries limited him to 64 games 
in 2004, with 25 home runs and 62 RBIs. On October 26, 2004, Cabrera hit 
a two-run towering homer as the Seibu Lions defeated the Chunichi Dragons 
7–2 in Game 7 of the Japan Series to win their first championship since 
1992. The ball bounced off the glass-enclosed private boxes above the left 
field seats at the Nagoya Dome. It was Cabrera's third home run of the 
series. He also hit a grand slam and a two-run homer in Game 3. In six 
seasons with the Lions, Cabrera was a .308 hitter with 246 home runs and 
605 RBI in 708 games. In January 2008, Cabrera signed a one-year contract 
with the Orix Buffaloes. It was reported that the contract had a requirement 
that Cabrera pass a drug test when he reported in February.[2] He obtained 
free agency rights following the 2009 season after playing 8 years in Japan, 
thereby removing the designation as a "foreign player," becoming the fourth 
non-Japanese player to obtain such classification in NPB. In three seasons 
with Orix (2008–10), Cabrera slugged a combined 73 home runs and produced 
225 RBIs. After his career in Japan came to a close with just 97 games 
played in 2011-12 with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, Cabrera continued to 
play professional baseball during the winter season for Tiburones de La 
Guaira in his native Venezuela. In 59 games during the 2013-14 season, 
Cabrera batted .391, with a record-setting 21 home runs. He broke the league 
single season home run record set by Baudilio Diaz, who hit 20 in 1979-80. 
On December 13, 2007, Cabrera was linked to steroid use in the Mitchell 
Report, one of many MLB players so identified. The report detailed an incident 
in September 2000 when Cabrera was playing for the Arizona Diamondbacks. 
Team officials found a package that contained a vial of what they suspected 
to be anabolic steroids and several hundred pills. Clubhouse attendants 
claimed the package was intended for Cabrera. The contents of the package 
were tested and it was determined that the vial contained the anabolic 
steroid Winstrol, but the pills were legal, over-the-counter diet pills. 
Before the tests came back, however, Cabrera's contract had been sold to 
the Seibu Lions, so he was never tested for steroid use. Cabrera denied 
knowing why the package had been addressed to him[3] After the report came 
out, Cabrera denied ever using steroids. "I couldn't have used the substances 
that are identified. I never had possession of the alleged box that supposedly 
contained the pharmaceutical drugs."[4][5] While playing in Japan, where 
they conform to Olympic testing standards, he has never tested positive 
for performance-enhancing drugs.[6] Cabrera's son Ramon Salvador is also 
a professional baseball player. The younger Cabrera, a switch-hitting catcher, 
signed his first pro contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization 
in 2008, at the age of 18. Ramon made his major league debut with the Cincinnati
