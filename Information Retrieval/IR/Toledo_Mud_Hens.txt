The Toledo Mud Hens are a Minor League Baseball team located in Toledo, 
Ohio. The Mud Hens play in the International League and are affiliated 
with the Detroit Tigers franchise of Major League Baseball, based about 
50 miles (80 km) north of Toledo. They play their home games at Fifth Third 
Field. Professional baseball had been played off and on in Toledo since 
1883, but the Mud Hens era began in 1896 with the "Swamp Angels", who played 
in the Interstate League. They played in Bay View Park, which was outside 
the Toledo city limits and therefore not covered by the city's blue laws. 
The park was located near marshland inhabited by American coots, also known 
as "mud hens." For this reason, the local press soon dubbed the team the 
"Mud Hens"—a nickname that has stuck to Toledo baseball teams for all but 
a few years since. After only one year, though, the team moved to Armory 
Park.[1]:10; 17 Pitchers Catchers Infielders Outfielders Manager Coaches
