Baseball Digest is a baseball magazine resource, published in Evanston, 
Illinois by Grandstand Publishing, LLC. It is the oldest and longest-running 
baseball magazine in the United States. It was created by Herbert F. Simons, 
a sportswriter for the Chicago Daily Times, in 1942. Simons first published 
the magazine in August 1942,[1] and served as its editor-in-chief until 
1963. In 1981, Joan Whaley was published as its first female contributor.

scouting reports by veteran MLB scouts, and a significant increase in newsstand 
availability. Other features include batting, pitching and fielding statistics, 
a "fans speak out" letters section, a "Baseball Profile" of one player, 
trivia questions in a Quick Quiz, previews, rules review, a crossword puzzle, 
and analysis of upcoming prospects. In addition, Baseball Digest provides
