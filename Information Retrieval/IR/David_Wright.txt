David Allen Wright (born December 20, 1982) is an American professional 
baseball third baseman who serves as captain for the New York Mets of Major 
League Baseball (MLB). He was drafted by the Mets in 2001 and made his 
major league debut in 2004. Wright is a seven-time All-Star, two-time Gold 
Glove Award winner, two-time Silver Slugger Award winner, and a member 
of the 30–30 club. He holds Mets franchise records for most career runs 
batted in (RBIs), doubles, total bases, runs scored, walks, sacrifice flies, 
times on base, extra base hits, strikeouts, and hits. He was named captain 
of the Mets in 2013, the fourth in team history, and was given the nickname 
"Captain America", who is also his favorite super hero, after his performance 
for Team USA, which included a grand slam in the World Baseball Classic.[1] 
Wright was born in Norfolk, Virginia, the oldest of four sons of Rhon, 
a police officer in the Norfolk Police Department, and Elisa Wright.[2] 
He was raised in Virginia Beach, VA before moving to Chesapeake, Virginia 
in ninth grade. Wright attended Hickory High School in Chesapeake and was 
the 2001 Gatorade Virginia High School Player of the Year. Wright also 
earned All-State honors in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and was named Virginia All-State 
Player of the Year in 2001. Over his four-year career at Hickory, Wright 
hit .438 with 13 home runs and 90 RBIs. Wright planned to attend Georgia 
Tech and major in engineering. He is of Scots-Irish descent. Wright was 
chosen by the Mets in the 2001 amateur draft during the supplemental round 
as compensation for the Mets' loss of Mike Hampton to the Colorado Rockies 
in free agency. Wright was selected after future teammate Aaron Heilman 
who had been selected in the first round. Wright progressed steadily in 
his first three years of minor league play, winning the Sterling award 
for best player on the class A St. Lucie Mets in 2003. In 2004, he quickly 
rose from the Double-A Binghamton Mets to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides to 
the major leagues. On July 21, 2004, Wright made his major league debut 
starting at third base against the Montreal Expos. The next day, on July 
22, Wright picked up his first career hit, a double, off of the Montreal 
Expos' pitcher Zach Day. Since then, Wright has been the Mets regular starting 
third baseman. During his first major league season, Wright finished with 
a .293 batting average, 14 home runs and 40 RBIs in 263 at-bats in 69 games, 
and was voted as the This Year in Baseball Awards Rookie of the Year. In 
2005, the 22-year-old Wright played in 160 games and batted .306 with 27 
home runs, 102 RBIs, 99 runs scored, 42 doubles, and 17 stolen bases, leading 
the team in average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, RBI, 
doubles, and finishing second in home runs to Cliff Floyd (34). Wright 
was also in the top 10 in the National League for average, hits, total 
bases, RBI, extra base hits, and runs. Wright's 24 errors tied him with 
Troy Glaus for the most errors by a third baseman in the major leagues.[3] 
Wright made an over-the-shoulder barehanded catch during the seventh inning 
of a game at Petco Park against the San Diego Padres on August 9, 2005. 
With one out in the inning, Brian Giles hit a blooper 20 feet (6.1 m) beyond 
the edge of the outfield grass. Wright, retreating quickly with his back 
to home plate, extended his bare right hand and caught the ball cleanly 
while crashing to the field. Wright would maintain control of the ball 
after landing hard on the outfield grass. The sellout crowd at Petco Park 
acknowledged the splendor of the catch with a standing ovation lasting 
several minutes. This play was voted the "This Year in Baseball Play of 
the Year."[4] In 2006, Wright was named National League Co-Player of the 
Week for June 12–18 along with teammate José Reyes.[5] For the month, Wright 
batted .327 with 10 home runs and 29 RBIs. Wright also provided his share 
of heroics throughout the 2006 season. His first game-winning hit occurred 
on May 5 with a 2-out double just out of the reach of a chasing Andruw 
Jones in the bottom of the 14th inning off Jorge Sosa to defeat the Atlanta 
Braves, 8–7. Two weeks later on May 19, he hit a walk-off single off Yankees 
closer Mariano Rivera that just sailed over the head of center fielder 
Johnny Damon as the Mets rallied to beat the Yankees in the first game 
of the 2006 Subway Series, 7–6. He capped off the month on Memorial Day, 
May 29, with a single to the wall in left-center field off Arizona Diamondbacks 
closer José Valverde scoring José Reyes from first base as the Mets defeated 
Arizona, 8–7. Wright also made a game-saving stop at third base of a would-be 
game-tying single by Mike Lieberthal for the final out of a 4–3 Mets victory 
over Philadelphia on August 5. Wright was voted on to his first MLB All-Star 
Game as the starting third baseman for the NL. During the 2006 season, 
Wright collected 74 RBIs before the All-Star Break, breaking the Mets record 
previously held by Mike Piazza, who had 72 RBIs in 2000. Wright also participated 
in the 2006 Home Run Derby, reaching the final round but finishing second 
to Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies. He hit 22 home runs in the 
contest, including 16 in the first round, the third highest total in any 
one round in the history of the Home Run Derby.[6] The following night, 
he hit a home run in his first All-Star Game at-bat off American League 
starting pitcher Kenny Rogers. Wright ranked among the club's top three 
hitters in all offensive categories for the 2006 Mets, who were the second 
most run-scoring team in the National League. Fans at Shea Stadium have 
routinely greeted Wright's performances with chants of "M-V-P, M-V-P." 
According to then teammate Tom Glavine, "He's probably been our most clutch 
hitter over the first half of the season and he's certainly thrown his 
hat into the MVP talks."[7] On August 6, 2006, Wright signed a 6-year contract 
extension with the Mets worth $55 million, as well as a $1.5 million signing 
bonus. The contract paid him $1 million in 2007, $5 million in 2008, $7.5 
million in 2009, $10 million in 2010, $14 million in 2011, and $15 million 
in 2012. The contract also contained a club option for 2013 worth $16 million. 
Wright has already announced that he will donate $1.5 million to the Mets 
Foundation throughout the course of this contract.[8] The Mets captured 
the NL East title in 2006 and returned to the playoffs for the first time 
since 2000. Wright struggled in his first postseason, going 4–25 (.160) 
in the Mets' NLCS loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, and batting a mere .216 
in 10 postseason games. Wright participated in the 2006 Major League Baseball 
Japan All-Star Series along with teammates José Reyes, Julio Franco, and 
John Maine. As of April 21, 2007, Wright had a hitting streak of 26 regular 
season games; the previous team record was 24, held by Mike Piazza and 
Hubie Brooks. He had a hit in the 12 final regular season games of the 
2006 season, and had a hit in all of the first 14 games of the 2007 season.[9] 
Wright's hit streak of 26 regular season games ended on April 21, 2007 
against the Atlanta Braves at Shea Stadium. Wright went 0 for 4 with 2 
strikeouts. On September 16, 2007, Wright became the 29th player in baseball 
history to join the 30–30 club, after hitting a 7th inning solo home run 
against the Philadelphia Phillies at Shea Stadium. He is only the third 
player to reach this milestone before his 25th birthday, and only the third 
Met to reach this milestone in club history, the other two being Howard 
Johnson and Darryl Strawberry. Wright finished the 2007 season with a .325 
batting average, 30 home runs, 107 RBI, and 34 stolen bases. Wright was 
awarded the 2007 Gold Glove and the Silver Slugger Award at third base. 
He also was fourth in the NL MVP voting receiving 182 votes.[10] Wright 
began the year with two doubles, including a bases-clearing double, in 
finishing 2–4 with three RBIs in the Mets' Opening Day victory over the 
Marlins, 7–2. With the RBIs, Wright already halfway matched his RBI production 
from the preceding April. In the final game of the series, Wright went 
3–5 with a 3-run home run. On April 13, Wright hit his 100th career home 
run, a solo shot off of Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Jeff Suppan. Wright hit 
his first-ever walk-off home run of his baseball career on August 7, 2008. 
On November 5, 2008, Wright was announced as the recipient of the Rawlings' 
Gold Glove Award for third basemen. It was the second consecutive year 
in which Wright won the award. His teammate, Carlos Beltrán, also won the 
award for center fielders. He also won his second Silver Slugger Award. 
On December 22, 2008, Wright was announced as a member of Team USA in the 
2009 World Baseball Classic (WBC) to be held in March 2009. The third base 
position was taken by Alex Rodriguez in the 2006 WBC, but Rodriguez was 
on the Dominican Team in 2009's Classic.[11] Wright finished seventh in 
the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award after finishing the season with a 
.302 batting average with 33 home runs and 124 RBI.[12] Wright hit the 
first Mets home run in Citi Field history on Monday, April 13, 2009, Citi 
Field's Opening Day. The three-run home run was hit off San Diego Padres 
pitcher Walter Silva in the 5th inning.[13] In mid-August when 10 Mets 
players were on the disabled list, Wright would soon be added to the list 
after sustaining an injury on August 15. Wright suffered a concussion when 
he was hit in the head with a 93 mph (150 km/h) fastball by San Francisco 
Giants pitcher Matt Cain. He was admitted to the Hospital for Special Surgery, 
where he underwent a precautionary CT scan, which turned out negative.[14] 
The following day he left the hospital diagnosed with post-concussion symptoms. 
He was then placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career.[15] 
Despite the injury to Wright, Mets General Manager Omar Minaya stated that 
there were no plans to shut him down for the remainder of the season.[16] 
In fact, Wright was activated from the disabled list on September 1 and 
started at third base against the Colorado Rockies that evening. In that 
game, Wright wore a new style of batting helmet (the Rawlings S100). He 
would abandon that helmet after wearing it in that one game. Wright explained 
that he found the helmet uncomfortable. "It's the last thing I need to 
be worrying about in the box is trying to shove it on my head. So I wanted 
to go back to the old one and just wait to see if there's going to be any 
adjustments made." [17] Wright experienced a decline in production after 
a potent campaign in 2008. His home run total dropped to 10, while his 
RBI total fell to 72, after hitting 33 home runs and 124 RBIs the previous 
season. Wright, along with Jose Reyes, arrived at the Mets' Spring training 
camp in Port St. Lucie, Florida two weeks early to get a head start on 
preparing themselves after a disappointing 2009 campaign. Wright came into 
camp heavier than he was in previous seasons, adding more muscle to his 
body.[18] On Opening Day, Wright hit a two-run home run off of the Marlins' 
Josh Johnson in his first at bat of the season. On April 27 in the second 
game of a double header against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Wright reached 
the 1,000 hit mark against pitcher Ramón Troncoso in the bottom of the 
5th inning as he hit a two-out RBI single scoring Ángel Pagán and giving 
the Mets a 4–3 lead. In the following inning, Wright hit a three-run triple 
to the right-center field wall, scoring Pagán, Luis Castillo, and José 
Reyes, and giving the Mets a 10–3 lead at the time. The Mets won the game 
10–5. On May 20, he hit a three-run double after Mets manager Jerry Manuel 
gave Wright a day off. By June 25, Wright had 12 home runs, which led the 
team, and was batting .294 with 57 RBIs to lead the N.L. On July 4, 2010, 
Wright was named the starting third baseman for the National League in 
the 2010 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, making it Wright's fifth 
consecutive All-Star Game appearance. On July 6, Wright was named the June 
2010 National League Player of the Month after he hit .404 with 11 doubles, 
6 home runs, and 29 RBIs. On July 13, 2010, Wright collected 2 hits and 
a stolen base in the 81st All-Star Game in Anaheim. He is now 6-for-13 
in his All-Star Game at bats. He is tied for fifth all-time in All-Star 
Game batting average. As of August 20, he has more than doubled his home 
run total from 2009. Wright finished the 2010 season with a .283 batting 
average, .354 on-base percentage, 29 home runs, 103 RBIs, 69 walks, and 
19 stolen bases. On April 5, 2011, Wright singled against the Phillies' 
Cole Hamels for his 90th career game-winning RBI, surpassing Mike Piazza 
for the most in Mets history. Then on May 16, 2011, after undergoing examination 
by team doctors, it was announced Wright had a stress fracture in his lower 
back. The injury (caused by a diving tag on the Astros' Carlos Lee)[citation 
needed] forced him to spend more than two months on the disabled list. 
Wright was activated from the DL on July 22, 2011. That day, he went 2-for-5 
and had two RBIs and scored two runs against the Florida Marlins. In his 
first series coming back from the DL, Wright hit 6-for-14, with one home 
run, three doubles and six RBIs. Wright enjoyed a career first on August 
7, 2011 against the Atlanta Braves, playing shortstop for the first time 
in his professional career due to injuries to José Reyes (hamstring) and 
Daniel Murphy (MCL).[19] In only 102 games, Wright finished the season 
with a .254 batting average, .345 on-base percantage, 14 home runs, 61 
RBIs, 52 walks, and 13 stolen bases. On April 5, Wright went 2-for-3 with 
a walk on as the Mets' Opening Day third-baseman against the Braves, where 
Wright drove in Andrés Torres with a single for the game-winning run in 
the 6th inning off of Tommy Hanson, giving the Mets the 1-0 win.[20] Less 
than a week later, on April 11, Wright fractured his right pinkie while 
diving into first base on a pick-off attempt.[21] After missing just three 
games, Wright returned to the lineup, going 3-for-5 against the Phillies.[22] 
Then on April 25, Wright hit a two run home run in a 5-1 victory against 
the Miami Marlins, giving him 735 career RBIs, passing Darryl Strawberry 
for the most in Mets franchise history.[23] Wright broke another franchise 
record on June 5, when he hit a solo-shot off of Washington Nationals pitcher 
Jordan Zimmermann, driving himself in and reaching 736 runs. The previous 
record holder was José Reyes at 735 runs. On July 1, it was announced that 
Wright had made his 6th All-Star team, but as a back up to Pablo Sandoval. 
Wright led the All-Star vote for most of the year but was overtaken in 
the last week of voting.[24] For the first half of the season, Wright was 
either atop or close to the top of the league in both batting average and 
on-base percentage, and led NL third basemen in average, OBP, slugging, 
hits and runs scored.[25] After the All-Star break, the Mets had their 
worst stretch to that point in the season, losing six straight, but on 
July 19, Wright hit two home runs and had five RBIs to help the Mets end 
their losing streak.[26] He hit his 200th career home run in a loss on 
August 24 to the Houston Astros.[27] On September 25, 2012, Wright tied 
the all time hit record with the Mets Ed Kranepool with 1,418 hits in a 
game at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[28] Then on September 26, 
2012, Wright surpassed Kranepool as Mets all-time hit record holder with 
an infield single also at home against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Wright finished 
6th in the voting for the 2012 NL MVP Award. On November 30, 2012, Ed Coleman 
and WFAN reported that Wright and the Mets agreed to a 7-year contract 
extension worth $138 million (7 years for $122 million plus a club option 
for $16 million that the club picked up for the 2013 season). The contract 
became official on December 4 after Wright passed a physical.[29] Wright 
was represented in negotiations by Seth Levinson and Sam Levinson of ACES 
Inc.[30][31] Wright's $138 million deal was contrary to the Mets budget-conscious 
policy of not giving huge contracts to players in their 30s; nonetheless 
general manager Sandy Alderson made an exception as he viewed Wright as 
a leader and role model, both on and off the field. At the same time, many 
agents and front-office executives suggested that had Wright waited a year 
and became a free agent, he could have received a deal close to $200 million.[32] 
Although it had been six years since the Mets' last playoff appearance 
and four years since their last winning season, Alderson managed to persuade 
Wright to stay as the Mets' farm system had young talented pitchers.[33][34] 
Wright will have to wait until 2025 to receive all the money from his $138 
million, eight-year contract with the Mets.[35] The Mets have injury insurance 
on Wright's contract which kicks in after he misses 60 days, where the 
team would recoup 75 percent of his salary while he is unable to play.[2] 
After a spring training game on March 21, the Mets announced that Wright 
had been named the fourth team captain in Mets history, joining Keith Hernandez, 
Gary Carter, and John Franco.[36] Wright got his 1,500th career hit on 
June 18 against the Atlanta Braves off of Cory Gearrin. Wright was named 
the National League's Home Run Derby team captain for the 2013 MLB All-Star 
Game.[37] He selected Carlos Gonzalez, Michael Cuddyer, and Bryce Harper 
as the other three participants for the National League. Gonzalez, who 
was injured at the time, was later replaced by Pedro Alvarez. In the Home 
Run Derby, Wright hit 5 home runs. On July 6, Wright was named the starting 
third baseman for the National League team in the 2013 MLB All-Star Game. 
In the 2013 MLB All-Star Game, Wright went 1 for 3. Wright also became 
the fourth Mets player to appear in at least 7 All-Star games. On August 
3, 2013, Wright was placed on the 15-day disabled list a day after he strained 
his right hamstring.[38] Upon his return from the disabled list, Wright 
hit two home runs in his first two games, surpassing Mike Piazza for the 
second most home runs hit by a player in a Mets uniform, behind Darryl 
Strawberry. Wright was chosen as the "Face of MLB" in a contest voted on 
by John online in February 2014. He narrowly beat out A's infielder Eric 
Sogard.[39] Wright finished second in All-Star game voting for third base 
to the Brewers' Aramis Ramírez, making it only the third time in 10 seasons 
he's been left out.[40] Second baseman Daniel Murphy represented the Mets 
at the 2014 All-Star Game. Wright's 2014 performance declined from previous 
years. He hit at a .269 clip, his lowest batting average since his 2011 
season was shortened due to injury. Wright's .269/.324/.374 slash line 
was attributed to a recurring shoulder injury. Early in the season, he 
sustained a left rotator cuff contusion which slowed his offensive production 
and hurt his defense. Wright finished the year with a career-low eight 
home runs and committed 15 errors, tied for most on the team. On April 
14, 2015, Wright suffered a strained right hamstring while stealing second 
base. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list.[41] He was later diagnosed 
with spinal stenosis, and was expected to return towards the end of the 
season.[42] David Wright was placed on the 60-day DL for his spinal stenosis 
on July 24, 2015, to clear up space on the 40-man roster. On August 10, 
the Mets sent Wright on a rehab assignment to the St. Lucie Mets. Following 
Chase Utley's August trade from the Philadelphia Phillies to the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Wright became the longest-tenured active player to have played 
his entire career with one team. His 1,516 games with the Mets had previously 
only trailed Utley's 1,551 games with the Phillies.[43] On August 24, Wright 
hit a home run on his first at-bat back from his injury. His return helped 
propel the Mets to the 2015 World Series against the Kansas City Royals. 
In his first-ever World Series appearance, in Game 1, he committed an error 
in the 14th inning that led to the winning run as the Royals took a 5-4 
victory. In Game 3, he went 2-for-4 with 4 RBIs, including his first World 
Series home run, a two-run home run, off Yordano Ventura as part of the 
Mets' 9-3 victory and their first and only win of that series. As a result 
of his spinal stenosis, Wright has to complete an extensive pre-game workout 
routine consisting of physical therapy, exercise, and some minimal batting 
and fielding drills. His entire process takes about 4-5 hours.[44] On May 
21, 2016, Wright hit a bases-loaded single off of Milwaukee Brewers pitcher 
Michael Blazek to break a 4-4 tie in the bottom of the 9th inning and give 
the Mets the victory.[45] On June 3, Wright was placed on the disabled 
list due to a herniated disc in his neck.[46] On June 16, he underwent 
neck surgery to repair the herniated disc. He would miss the remainder 
of the 2016 season. Wright was selected to play third base for the United 
States in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In the second round, with the 
United States facing elimination against Puerto Rico, Wright delivered 
a 9th inning walk-off hit against Fernando Cabrera to win the game for 
the Americans. The win guaranteed Team USA a spot in the semifinal round. 
He was again selected to play third base in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. 
In the 2013 WBC, Wright hit a grand slam in the United States's game against 
Italy. It was the second time a United States player hit a grand slam in 
WBC play. In the second round opener against Puerto Rico, Wright had 5 
RBIs. Wright ended the tournament with the most total RBIs of any player 
and earned the nickname "Captain America".[47] Wright would sit out during 
the US loss to the Dominican Republic in the following game, citing soreness. 
He would later be diagnosed with sore ribs and sent back to New York for 
further examination, ending his participation for the rest of the 2013 
tournament. The US team went on to lose to Puerto Rico 4-3, resulting in 
an elimination. Wright was selected as the third baseman for the All-WBC 
team, the only American player to earn the honor. Wright has maintained 
homes in Manhattan and Manhattan Beach, California, wherein he owns a Boxer 
named Homer. Clubhouse nicknames include "Visine" and "Hollywood".[49] 
His brother Stephen was enrolled at Virginia Tech in 2007, and attended 
classes in Norris Hall, the scene of the majority of shootings in the Virginia 
Tech Massacre. In May 2007, Vitamin Water was sold to The Coca-Cola Company 
for $4.1 billion. As part of his endorsement deal, Wright was given 0.5% 
of the company, and thus netted approximately $20 million from the deal.[50] 
Wright, who had been dating model Molly Beers for several years, announced 
in January 2013 that they got engaged during the holidays.[51] They were 
married in La Jolla, California, on December 26, 2013.[52] David and Molly 
welcomed a daughter, Olivia Shea, to the world on July 23, 2016. Wright 
has numerous health conscious routines, including sleeping for nine hours 
a night and limiting to one coffee a day. His diet includes hard-boiled 
eggs, avocados, and a daily salad, while avoiding most clubhouse food. 
On road trips, he takes his resistance band and a foam roller for early 
afternoon workouts, five or six hours before game time.[32] In 2005, Wright 
began his own charitable organization, the David Wright Foundation. Its 
mission is to increase awareness about multiple sclerosis and to raise 
money for multiple sclerosis organizations and projects. The Foundation 
hosted its first annual gala at the New York Stock Exchange Members' Club 
on December 16, 2005, donating the proceeds to two multiple sclerosis centers.[53] 
During the 2009 season, Wright and Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter represented 
their foundations in a competition sponsored by Delta Air Lines. Jeter 
had the higher batting average and received $100,000 for his foundation 
from Delta while Wright's foundation received $50,000.[54] Wright is the 
New York City host for Big League Impact, an eight-city fantasy football 
network created and led by longtime St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright. 
In 2015, the organization raised more than $1 million total for various 
charitable organzations.[55] Delta Air Lines named an MD-88 airplane The 
Wright Flight, after Wright.[56] The plane's name, along with Wright's 
signature and jersey number (5), are next to the boarding door. The plane 
shuttles between New York, Boston and Washington.[56] Wright is noted for 
his unaffected politeness and work ethic. He has been known to help participate 
with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. He has developed a reputation for 
arriving very early to the park for games and being uncommonly accommodating 
with fans and reporters.[57] Wright was featured on the cover of MLB 07: 
The Show, as well as a TV commercial advertisement for the game on the 
PlayStation 3 game console. He has also appeared in a television commercial 
for Fathead, promoting the company's wall graphics. In 2006, Wright appeared 
on MTV's Total Request Live with then teammate Cliff Floyd. He also made 
an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 12, 2006. That 
same day he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated along with Mets 
teammates Carlos Beltrán, Paul Lo Duca, Carlos Delgado, and José Reyes. 
On January 3, 2008, Wright appeared on Celebrity Apprentice to purchase 
hot dogs for charity.[58] Wright is a celebrity spokesman for Ford in the
