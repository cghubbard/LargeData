The 1980 Minnesota Twins season was a season in American baseball. The 
Twins finished 77-84, third in the American League West. 769,206 fans attended 
Twins games, the lowest total in the American League. On May 31, outfielder 
Ken Landreaux went 0 for 4, ending his hitting streak at 31 games. This 
set a Minnesota Twins record that has yet to be topped. Landreaux tripled 
three times July 3, in a 10-3 win over the Texas Rangers, to tie an American 
League record. This Twins record remained untouched until Denard Span matched 
it on June 29, 2010. Landreaux, a Los Angeles native, is the only Twins 
player to make the All-Star Game at Dodger Stadium. One of the club's most 
unusual games was played in Toronto on Thursday, August 28, a game in which 
one player was replaced after being injured in a car crash during the game 
and that featured a rare save by a Twins starting pitcher. A game that 
ended with the Blue Jays' mound ace playing left field. The Canadian National 
Exhibition (like a state fair) was set up adjacent to Exhibition Stadium. 
Because of a nightly concert, no inning could start past 5:00 PM; the game 
was begun at 1:00 PM to avoid the curfew. However, the game went into extra 
innings and was suspended in the 15th inning, to be finished the following 
afternoon. During the evening hours Thursday, Bombo Rivera was injured 
in a car crash with Toronto's Otto Velez and neither could resume playing 
Friday. Friday's scheduled starter Dave Stieb played left field for the 
final inning of the Thursday game when the Jays ran out of position players 
(he'd go on to lose the Friday game). Minnesota's John Verhoeven got the 
win, and starter Al Williams, who faced four batters in the fifteenth inning, 
got the save.[5] September 18: At Milwaukee for a double-header, outfielder 
Gary Ward hit a double, single, homer and triple in the first game, becoming 
the sixth Twin to hit for the cycle. It came, however, in a losing effort 
as the 9-8 win by the Brewers was the only time -- of the ten Minnesota 
cycles -- that Minnesota has lost the game in which a Twin cycled. Ward 
became part of history in 2004 when, on May 26, his son Daryle Ward hit 
for the cycle for Pittsburgh, and they became the only father-son duo to 
accomplish the feat. Infielder John Castino led the team in most of the 
major offensive categories, batting .302 with 13 HR and 64 RBI. Shortstop 
Roy Smalley hit 12 HR and collected 63 RBI. Ken Landreaux batted .281 with 
7 HR and 62 RBI. Reliever Doug Corbett replaced Mike Marshall as manager 
Gene Mauch's all-purpose reliever, racking up 8 relief wins along with 
23 saves. His saves total set a major league rookie record. Only veterans 
Jerry Koosman (16-13) and Geoff Zahn (14-18) had double digit wins. [1]
