As player As coach Charles Timothy O'Leary (October 15, 1875 – January 
6, 1941) was a Major League Baseball shortstop who played eleven seasons 
with the Detroit Tigers (1904–1912), St. Louis Cardinals (1913), and St. 
Louis Browns (1934).[1] Born in Chicago, Illinois into a family of 16 children 
(11 boys), O'Leary worked at age 16 for a clothing company and played on 
the company's semi-pro baseball team.[citation needed] His talent as a 
middle infielder and scrappy hitter came to the attention of Charles Comiskey, 
owner of the Chicago White Sox. Though there is no independent verification, 
O'Leary reportedly signed briefly with the White Sox,[2] only to have his 
arm broken from a pitched ball thrown by 'fireballer' and Hall of Famer, 
Rube Waddell.[3] O'Leary major league debut was on April 14, 1904 with 
the Tigers. He was Detroit's starting shortstop from 1904–1907 and became 
a backup shortstop and utility infielder from 1908-1912.[1] In the off-season, 
O'Leary and teammate Germany Schaefer, known as one of baseball's zaniest 
characters, worked as a comic vaudeville act.[4] The O'Leary-Schaefer vaudeville 
act is said to have inspired two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals: the forgotten 
1930 film They Learned About Women, featuring the noted vaudeville act 
Van and Schenck, and Busby Berkeley's last film, Take Me Out to the Ballgame 
(1949), with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.[citation needed] Not known for 
his hitting, O'Leary had a career batting average of .226.[1] After finishing 
his playing career in 1913 with the St. Louis Cardinals, O'Leary was a 
player-manager in the minor and semi-pro leagues for several years, including 
in San Francisco, St. Paul, San Antonio, and Chicago,[2] until he was offered 
a coaching job in 1920 by his close friend, Miller Huggins, manager of 
the New York Yankees.[5] After a 17-0 victory over the Washington Senators 
on July 6, 1920,[6] O'Leary was returning to New York in a car driven by 
Babe Ruth, along with Ruth's wife Helen, rookie outfielder Frank Gleich, 
and second-string catcher Fred Hofmann. Ruth lost control of the car, and 
O'Leary was ejected from the vehicle, although he suffered only minor injuries.[7] 
He coached for the Yankees for 10 years, during which they won six pennants 
and two World Series, including the great 1927 Yankees team.[2] O'Leary 
then coached with the Chicago Cubs under Rogers Hornsby, and with the St. 
Louis Browns. On September 30, 1934, several weeks shy of his 59th birthday, 
O'Leary was called out of retirement by the Browns. In a pinch-hitting 
appearance, he singled and scored, becoming both the oldest Major League 
Baseball player to collect a hit and to score a run. With that appearance, 
he became the last major leaguer who had played in the 1900s to play in 
a game. During his career, O'Leary claimed to have been born in 1882. However, 
in 2010, a researcher for the Society for American Baseball Research found 
him in the 1880 census. His draft record for World War I, which showed 
that he was born in 1875, was subsequently located.[citation needed] This 
made him the second oldest major league baseball player to appear in a
