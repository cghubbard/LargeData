Michael Joseph "Mike" McNally [Minooka Mike] (September 13, 1893 – May 
29, 1965) was a reserve infielder in Major League Baseball who played for 
three different teams between 1915 and 1925. Listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 
150 lb., McNally batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Minooka, 
Pennsylvania to Catherine Summerly and Michael McNally. Both parents were 
born in Ireland. A clever reserve infielder and basically a line drive 
hitter, Mc Nally entered the majors in 1915 with the Boston Red Sox, playing 
for them five years before joining the New York Yankees (1921–24) and Washington 
Senators (1925). His most productive season came with the 1920 Red Sox, 
when he posted career-highs in games (93), runs (42), hits (80), stolen 
bases (13) and on-base percentage (.326), while hitting a .256 average. 
In a 10-season career, McNally was a .238 hitter (257-for-1078) with 169 
runs and 85 RBI in 492 games, including 16 doubles, six triples, one home 
run and 40 stolen bases. As an infielder, he made 415 appearances at second 
base (181), third base (167), shortstop (60) and first base (7), while 
posting a collective .951 fielding percentage. McNally also played on five 
American League pennant winners, appearing in the World Series with Boston 
in 1916 and for New York in 1921 and 1922, though he did not play in the 
1915 and 1923 Series. In nine appearances, he hit .200 (4-for-20) with 
one RBI, two stolen base, four runs, and stole home plate in Game One of 
1921 Series. Following his playing retirement, McNally managed in the minor 
leagues from 1927 to 1938 for the Binghamton Triplets (1927–29), Wilkes-Barre 
Barons (1930–32, 1937–38) and Williamsport Grays (1933–36). He posted an 
872–781 record for a .528 winning percentage, including four first places 
and the 1934 New York–Penn League championship title with the Williamsport 
Grays. After that, he worked during almost two decades for the Cleveland 
Indians as a scout and farm club director. McNally died in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
