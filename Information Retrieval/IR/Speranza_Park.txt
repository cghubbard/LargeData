Speranza Park is a former baseball ground located in Toledo, Ohio, United 
States. The ground was home to the Toledo Maumees of the American Association 
during the 1890 season. The ballpark was located on a block bounded by 
Cherry Street, Frederick Street, and Franklin Avenue. The word "speranza" 
means "hope" in Italian. The park was reportedly named for the club owner's 
yacht. The team's first home game was played on May 1, 1890. The team finished 
a few games above .500, and 20 games back of first place, ending whatever 
major league hopes the club aspired to. The final home game was held on 
October 2, 1890. Coordinates: 41°40′14″N 83°32′34″W﻿ / ﻿41.6705556°N 83.5427778°W﻿
