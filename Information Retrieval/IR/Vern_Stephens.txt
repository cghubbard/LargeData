Vernon Decatur Stephens (October 23, 1920 â€“ November 3, 1968) was an American 
shortstop in professional baseball who played 15 seasons in the American 
League for four different teams. A native of McAlister, New Mexico, Stephens 
batted and threw right-handed. He was also nicknamed "Pop-up Stephens", 
"Junior", and "Buster". One of the strongest-hitting shortstops in major 
league history, Stephens compiled a .286 batting average with 247 home 
runs and 1174 RBI in 1720 games. Breaking with American Major League baseball, 
Stephens signed a five-year contract with the Mexican League in 1946. He 
had been in Mexico only a few days when his father, a minor league umpire, 
and the Browns scout Jack Fournier drove down and brought him back to the 
United States. Vern Stephens died of a heart attack in Long Beach, California 
at 48 years of age. In August 2008, he was named as one of the ten former 
players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans 
Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum
