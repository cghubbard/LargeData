Justin James Wilson (born August 18, 1987) is an American professional 
baseball pitcher for the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB). 
He played in MLB for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 2012 to 2014 and New York 
Yankees in 2015. Prior to his professional career, Wilson played college 
baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs, where he was a member of the 2008 
College World Series champions. Wilson attended Buchanan High School in 
Clovis, California.[1] Out of high school, the Los Angeles Dodgers drafted 
Wilson in the 37th round (1126th overall) of the 2005 Major League Baseball 
Draft, but he did not sign, opting to enroll at Fresno State University, 
where he played college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs baseball 
team.[2] In his junior season, Wilson was named to the College World Series 
All-Tournament Team, as Fresno State won the 2008 College World Series. 
After his junior season at Fresno State, the Pirates drafted Wilson in 
the fifth round (144th overall) of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft,[3] 
and he signed with the Pirates. In 2009, he played for the Lynchburg Hillcats. 
In 2010, he played for the Altoona Curve. In 2011, he played for the Indianapolis 
Indians. The Pirates added him to their 40-man roster after the 2011 season 
to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.[4] On April 29, 2012, pitching for 
the Indianapolis Indians against the Durham Bulls, Wilson pitched the first 
7 1/3 innings of a combined no-hitter, finished off by Jumbo Diaz and Doug 
Slaten. “It was pretty awesome,” Wilson said after the game. “Great for 
Jumbo to come in and not give up a hit. And Doug as well. Great defense 
all around. Outstanding play to end the game, it was an awesome play. And 
then José Morales behind the plate was just outstanding tonight.” On leaving 
the game with a no-hitter, Wilson said: “It was tough, but you’ve got to 
trust your manager.”“He was making the call on what he thought, which was 
totally okay with me. Totally understandable. I respect him, and understand 
what he was doing.” With two outs in the ninth inning, Reid Brignac sent 
a slow rolling check swing to second base, then Anderson Hernández ranged 
in, bare handed the ball, and made the flip to first base to complete the 
no-hitter.[5] On August 9, 2012, pitching for the Indianapolis Indians, 
Wilson pitched his second no-hitter of the 2012 season, an eight inning, 
complete game no-hitter against the Charlotte Knights (rain ended the game 
in the eighth inning).[6][7] Wilson was promoted to the Pittsburgh Pirates 
on August 20, 2012.[8] Wilson made his major league debut the same day, 
pitching one scoreless inning, with three strikeouts. Wilson had a 6–1 
win-loss record with a 2.08 earned run average (ERA) for the Pirates in 
2013. He had a 3–4 record with a 4.20 ERA in 2014.[9] On November 12, 2014, 
the Pirates traded Wilson to the New York Yankees in exchange for Francisco 
Cervelli.[10] During the 2015 season, Yankees' manager Joe Girardi used 
Wilson as his setup pitcher for the seventh inning, with Dellin Betances 
and Andrew Miller pitching the eighth and ninth innings, respectively. 
Wilson had a 3.10 ERA in 61 innings pitched in 2015.[11] On December 9, 
2015, the Yankees traded Wilson to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Chad 
Green and Luis Cessa.[12] On January 13, 2016, the Tigers avoided arbitration 
with Wilson, agreeing on a one-year, $1.525 million contract.[13] For the 
2016 season, Wilson pitched mostly in a setup role, compiling a 4–5 record, 
4.14 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 58 2⁄3 innings pitched. His strikeout rate 
of 10.0 per 9 innings was the highest of his four full major league seasons. 
Wilson throws a hard four-seam fastball that averages 95 MPH (topping out 
at 99 MPH). He also throws two-seam fastballs and cut fastballs in the 
90–94 MPH range. His primary offspeed pitch is a curveball that averages
