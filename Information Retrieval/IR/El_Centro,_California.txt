El Centro is a city in and county seat of Imperial County, the largest 
city in the Imperial Valley, east anchor of the Southern California Border 
Region, and the core urban area and principal city of the El Centro metropolitan 
area which encompasses all of Imperial County. El Centro is also the largest 
American city to lie entirely below sea level (−42 feet or −13 meters). 
The city, located in the far southeastern corner of California, is near 
the major Southern California city of San Diego and the Mexican city of 
Mexicali. Founded in 1906, W. F. Holt and C.A. Barker purchased the land 
on which El Centro was eventually built for about $40 an acre and invested 
$100,000 in improvements. As one historian of valley life[who?] put it, 
"in only five months El Centro went from a barley field to a city...".[citation 
needed] It is home to retail, transportation, wholesale, and agricultural 
industries. There are also two international border crossings nearby for 
commercial and noncommercial vehicles. The city's population was 42,598 
at the 2010 census, up from 37,835 in 2000. Spanish explorer Melchor Díaz 
was one of the first Europeans to visit the area around El Centro and Imperial 
Valley in 1540. The explorer Juan Bautista de Anza also explored the area 
in 1776[5] (an elementary school in El Centro now bears his name). Years 
later, after the Mexican-American War, the northern half of the valley 
was annexed by the U.S., while the southern half remained under Mexican 
rule. Small scale settlement in natural aquifer areas occurred in the early 
19th century (the present-day site of Mexicali), but most permanent settlement 
(Anglo Americans on the U.S. side, Mexicans on the other side) was after 
1900.[6] Originally part of San Diego County, the Imperial Valley was settled 
by farmers once water from the Colorado River was diverted via canals to 
irrigate the desert valley floor.[6][7] In 1906, the land on which El Centro 
was later built was purchased by W. F. Holt and C.A. Barker.[8] By 1907 
Imperial County was incorporated into California and by then much of the 
valley was successfully irrigated.[6] Before the town began, the railroad 
had established a station and named the place Cabarker.[9] The name honored 
C.A. Barker, a friend of the landowner.[9] The first post office in El 
Centro opened in 1905.[9] The City of El Centro was incorporated on April 
16, 1908. By 1910, the population of the city had reached 1,610. By 1920 
it was 5,646. One reason for this rapid growth was El Centro's becoming 
the county seat of Imperial County.[8] Population growth was slow, but 
accelerated in the 1930s, and again in the 1940s, despite the city being 
hard hit by a 7.1 earthquake in May 1940.[10][11] By the mid-1940s, El 
Centro had become the second largest city in the Imperial Valley, with 
a population of about 11,000 people. El Centro had also become the location 
of the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) administrative offices.[8] Agriculture 
has been an important industry within El Centro since the 1940s, because 
of its strategic location near rail lines and Highways 80 and 99 – more 
than 35 growers and shippers still operate in El Centro. However, by the 
early 1980s the two largest employment sectors in El Centro were government 
and wholesale/retail trade, reflecting El Centro's emerging role as a regional 
administrative and commercial center.[8] Imperial Valley Mall opened on 
the southeast side of the city in 2005. The nearby Algodones Dunes, the 
largest dune field in the US, draws thousands of visitors each year, mainly 
for off-road driving. The Salton Sea lies 30 miles (48 km) north of El 
Centro, but water sport enthusiasts head to the Colorado River, 50 miles 
(80 km) to the east near Yuma, Arizona. The El Centro Naval Air Facility 
10 miles (16 km) to the west is home to the annual Blue Angels flight maneuvering 
event. Stark Field is home of a minor league baseball team El Centro Imperials 
of the Arizona Summer League. Mexico (the border city of Mexicali, Baja 
California) is 10 miles (16 km) away, which offers big city amenities like 
museums, a zoo and a sports/convention center. According to the United 
States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.1 square miles (29 km2), 
of which over 99% is land. El Centro is located in the Imperial Valley 
(considered locally as synonymous with Imperial County). The city is 50 
feet (15 m) below sea level and the largest city in the United States below 
sea level. The Imperial Valley is in the Colorado Desert, an extension 
of the larger Sonoran Desert. The agriculture industry's demand for water 
is supplied by canals diverting water from the nearby Colorado River. The 
Salton Sea was created after a 1905 flood from the Colorado River.[12] 
In this region, the geology is dominated by the transition of the tectonic 
plate boundary from rift to fault. The southernmost strands of the San 
Andreas Fault connect the northern-most extensions of the East Pacific 
Rise. Consequently, the region is subject to earthquakes, and the crust 
is being stretched, resulting in a sinking of the terrain over time. El 
Centro has a desert climate and is the southernmost desert city below sea 
level in the continental United States. El Centro has over 350 days of 
sunshine and under 3 inches (76 mm) of rain annually. Winter temperatures 
are in the mid 70s to mid 80s with over-night lows in the low 50s to mid 
40s. During summer days, the dry, desert heat can push temperatures well 
into the 100s, while the nights stay in the low 80s to mid 70s. Snow is 
almost totally unknown in the town, except for a very strong winter storm 
that covered the entire valley with 4 inches snow on December 12th, 1934 
and a very brief fall of sleet mixed with hail during a shower in December 
1967. On average there are about 6 days that dip into the mid to lower 
30's. As of 2009 the employment of El Centro residents is dominated by 
the local government, California state government, and federal government. 
Two nearby prisons and the U.S. Border Patrol provide employment; The Economist 
states that the prisons and border patrol were "relatively untouched" by 
the late-2000s recession. The El Centro area has many farming plots, where 
carrots, lettuce, and other crops are produced, and therefore the El Centro 
economy is subject to seasonal variations like other farming areas. Between 
November and March in winter periods, El Centro-area farmers harvest lettuce 
for $8–10 per hour. During March the harvest moves to the north and is 
no longer in El Centro; in previous eras farmers migrated, while in the 
first decade of the 21st century many collect unemployment benefits during 
the summer.[14] El Centro is surrounded by thousands of acres of farmland 
that has transformed the desert into one of the most productive farming 
regions in California with an annual crop production of over $1 billion. 
Agriculture is the largest industry in Imperial County and accounts for 
48% of all employment.[15] Being the commercial center of Imperial County, 
fifty percent of the jobs in the El Centro come from the service and retail 
sector.[15] A recent growth in the interest of Imperial County as a filming 
location, has spurred growth in servicing this industry.[15] Due to its 
desert environment and proximity to Los Angeles, California, movies are 
sometimes filmed in the sand dunes outside the agricultural portions of 
the Imperial County. These have included Return of the Jedi, Stargate, 
The Scorpion King, and Into the Wild. Additionally, portions of the 2005 
film Jarhead were filmed here because of its similarity to the desert terrain 
of Iraq.[citation needed] According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
as of April 30, 2009 the El Centro area had a 25.0% unemployment rate, 
the highest for a Metropolitan Area in the country.[16] By August of that 
year, El Centro's unemployment rate was 27.5%, three times the overall 
United States unemployment rate of 9.7%. The Economist stated that the 
city is not the "centre of the Great Recession" like the figure would appear 
to indicate. While El Centro has a seasonal farming economy, there is still 
a fixed "baseline" unemployment at 12%. Timothy Kelly, the head of the 
Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation, estimated that between 
40,000 and 60,000 residents of Mexicali work in El Centro. The Economist 
added that there are likely many El Centro residents who work in Mexicali 
and collect unemployment benefits in El Centro; Ruben Duran, the city manager 
of El Centro, said that if the Mexicali jobs were factored into the employment 
rate, El Centro would have a normal employment rate. The manager of a job 
search agency called One Stop, said that about 3,000 people per month come 
into her agency; she says that some make a genuine effort to find jobs, 
while many do not have motivation to actually find a job, but to instead 
show proof that they tried to find a job. Kelly stated that unemployment 
fraud does not account for all of the issues with the El Centro area; he 
said that many residents have a lack of education and a lack of English 
language proficiency, so some of them cannot find jobs. The Economist added 
that the collapse of the housing market eliminated some construction jobs; 
the magazine countered that the scenario is true in many places in the 
United States.[14] In December 2008 listed as No. 5 on Forbes.com's list 
of "The Top 10 Places in America Where Homes are Losing their Value Fastest" 
with 31.4% of homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes 
are worth.[17] A national report on the effects of the "Great recession" 
of 2008/09 has found El Centro and the Imperial Valley in the top 5 poorest 
medium-sized cities in the U.S. in poverty and unemployment rates.[18] 
While the majority of the residents in this community are Hispanic, there 
is a diverse population with a wide array of interests. In the winter residents 
race on nearby sand dunes using four wheel drive buggies. During the summer 
residents spend time indoors instead of outside. Spanish is a dominant 
language among residents and over the radio. Many area residents live in 
both the United States and Mexico and go across the border frequently.[14]

Illegal immigrants tended to go through Imperial County instead of staying 
in Imperial County.[14] Within its boundary, there are three school districts 
– McCabe Union Elementary School District, El Centro School District and 
The Central Union High School District.[23] El Centro has 11 elementary 
schools, four middle/junior high schools and three high schools: The Central 
Union High School District includes two four-year comprehensive high schools 
(Central Union and Southwest) and one alternative education school (Desert 
Oasis). The school district's 3,450 students are supported by more than 
350 certified and classified staff. The District is governed by a five-member 
Board of Trustees.[15] Opportunities to attend college are available through 
Imperial Valley College, a local 2-year college, and an extension of San 
Diego State University located in Calexico, CA. San Diego State University's 
Calexico Campus offers a variety of bachelor's and master's degrees. There 
are three major highways that serve El Centro. Interstate 8 connects San 
Diego to the west and Yuma, Arizona to the east. State Route 86 and State 
Route 111 parallel each other as they go north to Brawley before running 
along the west and east shores of the Salton Sea, respectively, on their 
way to the Coachella Valley area. Going south from El Centro, State Route 
86 terminates at State Route 111, which runs to Calexico and Mexicali, 
Mexico. Imperial Valley Transit is the primary provider of mass transportation 
in the Imperial Valley. Formed in 1989 with just 3 buses and serving just 
3000 people per month, the agency now currently serves more than 45,000 
riders within the area per month. Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus 
service to El Centro. El Centro is operated by a council/manager form of 
government. The members of the City Council also sit as the Community Development 
Commission (Commission) and Redevelopment Agency (Agency) governing boards. 
The City Manager is empowered as the Executive Director of the Commission 
and Agency.[15] In the state legislature, El Centro is in the 40th Senate 
District, represented by Democrat Ben Hueso,[29] and the 56th Assembly
