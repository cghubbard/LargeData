Prior to the spring training, the 1996 Minnesota Twins were projected to 
be a contending team. The team's chances significantly worsened on March 
28, 1996. Kirby Puckett, the team's franchise player, had been tattooing 
the Grapefruit League (spring training) for a .360 average, but that morning 
woke up without vision in his right eye. He was eventually diagnosed with 
glaucoma. Several surgeries over the next few months could not restore 
vision in the eye. Puckett announced his retirement from baseball on July 
12. After beginning the season under the melancholy cloud of the Puckett 
situation, Manager Tom Kelly's team finished the year with a 78-84 record, 
which put it in fourth place in the American League Central Division. Individual 
players on the team did excel. Paul Molitor had a standout year in his 
first year back with his hometown team, playing as the regular designated 
hitter and winning a Silver Slugger Award at that position. He played in 
all but one game and hit .341 with 113 RBI and a league-best 225 hits. 
On September 16 in Kansas City, he collected his 3,000th hit, a triple 
off of Jos√© Rosado. He is the only player to obtain his 3,000th hit via 
a triple. Along with Molitor, Chuck Knoblauch also hit .341. Among the 
hits were 35 doubles. He also stole 45 bases. Marty Cordova had a respectable 
year, driving in 111 runs. The pitching did not match the offense. Brad 
Radke, Frank Rodriguez, and Rich Robertson (the three R's) all spent the 
whole season in the starting rotation and had losing records. The team's 
experiment moving Rick Aguilera from the closer's role to the starting 
rotation was not a successful one, as he started only 19 games. Scott Aldred 
also started seventeen games for the team. Radke had the lowest ERA among 
the starters at 4.46. The rest were over five. Dave Stevens got the most 
saves at 11, but he was not an effective closer. Mike Trombley and Dan 
Naulty had effective seasons out of the bullpen, but nobody else had an 
ERA under five. Epitomizing the pitching woes, Mike Milchin had an ERA 
of 8.31 but the team still let him pitch in 26 games. The only truly regular 
starters in the field were Knoblauch at second base, Pat Meares at shortstop, 
and Cordova in left field. In a less-than-encouraging sign for the team's 
postseason prospects, Scott Stahoviak saw a majority of the time at first 
base. Dave Hollins played 116 games at third, with Jeff Reboulet and Todd 
Walker also seeing time. Greg Myers and Matt Walbeck platooned at catcher. 
Rich Becker had the unenviable task of replacing Puckett in center field 
and played 121 games there. Right field was a mish-mash, with Matt Lawton 
playing 60 games at the position, Roberto Kelly 54, Denny Hocking 33, and 
Ron Coomer 23. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]
