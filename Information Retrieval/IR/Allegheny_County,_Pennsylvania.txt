Allegheny County (/ælᵻˈɡeɪni/) is a county in the southwestern part of 
the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. As of 2014 the population was 1,231,225,[2] 
making it the second-most populous county in Pennsylvania, following Philadelphia 
County. The county seat is Pittsburgh.[3] Allegheny County is included 
in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is in the Pittsburgh 
Designated Market Area. Allegheny County was the first in Pennsylvania 
to be given a Native American name, being named after the Allegheny River. 
The word "Allegheny" is of Lenape origin, with uncertain meaning. It is 
usually said to mean "fine river", but sometimes said to refer to an ancient 
mythical tribe called "Allegewi" that lived along the river long ago before 
being destroyed by the Lenape.[4] Not a great deal is known about the native 
inhabitants of the region prior to European contact. During the colonial 
era various native groups claimed or settled in the area, resulting in 
a multi-ethnic mix that included Iroquois, Lenape, Shawnee, and Mingo. 
European fur traders such as Peter Chartier established trading posts in 
the region in the early eighteenth century. In 1749 Captain Pierre Joseph 
Céloron de Blainville, claimed the Ohio Valley and all of western Pennsylvania 
for Louis XV of France. The captain traveled along the Ohio and Allegheny 
rivers inserting lead plates in the ground to mark the land for France. 
Since most of the towns during that era were developed along waterways, 
both the French and the British desired control over the local rivers. 
Therefore, the British sent Major George Washington to try to compel the 
French to leave their posts, with no success. Having failed in his mission, 
he returned and nearly drowned crossing the ice-filled Allegheny River. 
In 1754, the English tried again to enter the area. This time, they sent 
41 Virginians to build Fort Prince George. The French got news of the plan 
and sent an army to take over the fort, which they then resumed building 
with increased fortification, renaming it Fort Duquesne. The loss of the 
fort cost the English dearly because Fort Duquesne became one of the focal 
points of the French and Indian War. The first attempt to retake the fort, 
the Braddock Expedition, failed miserably.[5] It was not until General 
John Forbes attacked in 1758, four years after they had lost the original 
fort, that they recaptured and destroyed it. They subsequently built a 
new fort on the site, including a moat, and named it Fort Pitt. The site 
is now Pittsburgh's Point State Park. Both Pennsylvania and Virginia claimed 
the region that is now Allegheny County. Pennsylvania administered most 
of the region as part of its Westmoreland County. Virginia considered everything 
south of the Ohio River and east of the Allegheny River to be part of its 
Yohogania County and governed it from Fort Dunmore. In addition, parts 
of the county were located in the proposed British colony of Vandalia and 
the proposed U.S. state of Westsylvania. The overlapping boundaries, multiple 
governments, and confused deed claims soon proved unworkable. In 1780 Pennsylvania 
and Virginia agreed to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, and the region 
became part of Pennsylvania. From 1781 until 1788, much of what had been 
claimed as part of Yohogania County, Virginia, was administered as a part 
of the newly created Washington County, Pennsylvania. Allegheny County 
was officially created on September 24, 1788, from parts of Washington 
and Westmoreland counties. It was formed due to pressure from settlers 
living in the area around Pittsburgh, which became the county seat in 1791. 
The county originally extended all the way north to the shores of Lake 
Erie and became the "mother county" for most of what is now northwestern 
Pennsylvania. By 1800, the county's current borders were set. In the 1790s, 
a whiskey excise tax was imposed by the United States federal government. 
This started the so-called Whiskey Rebellion when the farmers who depended 
on whiskey income refused to pay and drove off tax collector John Neville. 
After a series of demonstrations by farmers, President George Washington 
sent troops to stop the rebellion. The area developed rapidly throughout 
the 19th century to become the center of steel production in the nation. 
Pittsburgh would later be labeled the "Steel Capital of the World". According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 745 square miles 
(1,930 km2), of which 730 square miles (1,900 km2) is land and 14 square 
miles (36 km2) (1.9%) is water.[6] Allegheny County is known for the three 
major rivers that flow through it: the Allegheny River and the Monongahela 
River converge at Downtown Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River. The Youghiogheny 
River flows into the Monongahela River at McKeesport, 10 miles (16 km) 
southeast. Several islands are located within the riverine systems. Water 
from these rivers eventually flows into the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi 
River. Although the county's industrial growth caused the clearcutting 
of forests, a significant woodland remains. For most of the 20th century, 
until 1999, Allegheny County was governed exclusively under the state's 
Second Class County Code. Under this code, the county handled everything: 
elections, prisons, airports, public health and city planning. Unlike the 
rest of the state, where certain public offices are combined and held by 
one person, in Allegheny County all public offices are held by elected 
individuals. Before the implementation of the home-rule charter on January 
1, 2000, there were three county commissioners. These were replaced with 
an elected chief officer (the county executive), a county council with 
15 members (13 elected by district, two elected county-wide), and an appointed 
county manager. The changes were intended to maintain a separation of powers 
between the executive and legislative branches while providing the citizens 
with greater control over the government. The county has 130 municipalities, 
each governing itself; no other county in Pennsylvania has nearly as many, 
with Luzerne County's 76 being second.[7] The county has one Second Class 
City (Pittsburgh) and three Third Class Cities (Clairton, Duquesne, and 
McKeesport). A 2004 study by the University of Pittsburgh stated that Allegheny 
County would be better served by consolidating the southeastern portion 
of the county (which includes many small, poor communities) into one large 
municipality, called "Rivers City", which would have a combined population 
of approximately 250,000.[8] Under the Onorato administration, Allegheny 
County paid $10,000 per month to Robert Ewanco, of Greenlee Partners, to 
lobby the Pennsylvania General Assembly.[9][10] County officials credit 
him with a "20-fold" return in the form of appropriations for a widening 
project on Pennsylvania Route 28, as well as a footbridge and security 
cameras at Duquesne University.[10] As of November 2014, there are 881,622 
registered voters in Allegheny County.[11] The Republican Party had been 
historically dominant in county-level politics; prior to the Great Depression 
Pittsburgh and Allegheny County had been Republican. Since the Great Depression 
on the state and national levels, the Democratic Party has been dominant 
in county-level politics and is the Democratic stronghold of western Pennsylvania. 
In 2000, Democrat Al Gore won 56% of the vote and Republican George W. 
Bush won 41%. In 2004, Democrat John Kerry received 57% of the vote and 
Bush received 42%. In 2006, Democrats Governor Ed Rendell and Senator Bob 
Casey, Jr. won 59% and 65% of the vote in Allegheny County, respectively. 
In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama received 57% of the vote, John McCain received 
41%, and each of the three state row office winners (Rob McCord for Treasurer, 
Jack Wagner for Auditor General, and Tom Corbett for Attorney General) 
also carried Allegheny. As of the census of 2010, there were 1,223,348 
people residing in the county. The population density was 1676 people per 
square mile (647/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 82.87% White, 
14.39% Black or African American, 2.94% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 
0.37% from other races, and 1.40% from two or more races. About 1.31% of 
the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. At the census[18] of 
2000, there were 1,281,666 people, 537,150 households, and 332,495 families 
residing in the county. The population density was 1,755 people per square 
mile (678/km²). There were 583,646 housing units at an average density 
of 799 per square mile (309/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 84.33% 
White, 12.41% Black or African American, 0.12% Native American, 1.69% Asian, 
0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.34% from other races, and 1.07% from two or more 
races. About 0.87% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 
20.0% were of German, 15.0% Italian, 12.7% Irish, 7.5% Polish and 5.1% 
English ancestry according to Census 2000. 93.5% spoke English and 1.3% 
Spanish as their first language. There were 537,150 households out of which 
26.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.10% were married 
couples living together, 12.40% had a female householder with no husband 
present, and 38.10% were non-families. Some 32.70% of all households were 
made up of individuals and 13.20% had someone living alone who was 65 years 
of age or older. The average household size was 2.31 and the average family 
size was 2.96. The age distribution of the population shows 21.90% under 
the age of 18, 8.50% from 18 to 24, 28.30% from 25 to 44, 23.40% from 45 
to 64, and 17.80% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 
40. For every 100 females, there were 90.00 males; for every 100 females 
age 18 and over, there were 86.20 males. In the late 18th century farming 
played a critical role in the growth of the area. There was a surplus of 
grain due to transportation difficulties in linking with the eastern portion 
of the state. As a result, the farmers distilled the grain into whiskey, 
which significantly helped the farmers financially. The area quickly became 
one of the key manufacturing areas in the young nation. Coupled with deposits 
of iron and coal, and the easy access to waterways for barge traffic, the 
city quickly became one of the most important steel producing areas in 
the world. Based on 2007 data from the US Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh 
is the second busiest inland port in the nation. With the decline of the 
steel industry in the US, the area shifted to other industries. Today, 
it is known for its hospitals, universities, and industrial centers. Despite 
the decline of heavy industry, Pittsburgh is home to a number of major 
companies and is ranked in the top ten among US cities hosting headquarters 
of Fortune 500 corporations. These include U.S. Steel Corporation, PNC 
Financial Services Group, PPG Industries, and H. J. Heinz Company. The 
county leads the commonwealth in number of defense contractors supplying 
the U.S. military.[19] Full list of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has 36 Approved Private Schools including 
the Charter Schools for the Blind and Deaf. Students attending these schools 
come from across the commonwealth. The private schools are licensed by 
the State Board of Private Academic Schools. They provide a free appropriate 
special education for students with severe disabilities. The cost of tuition 
for these schools is paid 60% by the state and 40% by the local school 
district where the student is a resident. Pennsylvania currently has four 
PA chartered and 30 non-charter APSs for which the Department approves 
funding. These schools provide a program of special education for over 
4,000 day and residential students. Parents are not charged for the services 
at the school.[20] In 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Education budgeted 
$98 million for tuition of children in approved private schools and $36.8 
million for students attending the charter schools for the deaf and blind.[21] 
The majority of these schools are located in the southeastern region and 
southwestern region of Pennsylvania. These are state designated before 
and after school program providers. They receive state funding through 
grants. CCLCs provide academic, artistic and cultural enhancement activities 
to students and their families when school is not in session.[22] Allegheny 
County's public transportation provider is the Port Authority of Allegheny 
County. The Allegheny County Department of Public Works oversees infrastructure, 
maintenance and engineering services in the county. The Three Rivers Heritage 
Trail provides uninterrupted bicycle and pedestrian connections along the 
three rivers in the city, and the Great Allegheny Passage trail runs from 
downtown Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C. For information about major state 
roads, see list of State Routes in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and Allegheny 
County Belt System. There are two Pennsylvania state parks in Allegheny 
County. Point State Park is at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela 
rivers in Downtown Pittsburgh, and Allegheny Islands State Park is in the 
Allegheny River in Harmar Township and is undeveloped as of August 2010. 
Under Pennsylvania law, there are four types of incorporated municipalities: 
cities, boroughs, townships, and (in one case) a town. The following municipalities 
are in Allegheny County: Census-designated places are geographical areas 
designated by the US Census Bureau for the purposes of compiling demographic 
data. They are not actual jurisdictions under Pennsylvania law. Other unincorporated 
communities, such as villages, may be listed here as well. Many political 
subdivisions of Allegheny County have come and gone through subdivision 
or annexation through the years. These include: The population ranking 
of the following table is based on the 2010 census of Allegheny County.[27]
