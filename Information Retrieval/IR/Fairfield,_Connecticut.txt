06824 06825 06828 (General Electric) 06890 (Southport) Fairfield is a town 
located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. It borders the 
towns of Bridgeport, Trumbull, Easton, Weston, and Westport along the Gold 
Coast of Connecticut. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population 
of 59,404.[1] In July 2006, Money magazine ranked Fairfield the ninth "best 
place to live" in the United States,[2] and the best place to live in the 
Northeast.[3] In 1635, Puritans and Congregationalists in the Massachusetts 
Bay Colony, dissatisfied with the rate of Anglican reforms, sought to establish 
an ecclesiastical society subject to their own rules and regulations. The 
Massachusetts General Court granted them permission to settle the towns 
of Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford in the area now known as Connecticut. 
On January 14, 1639, a set of legal and administrative regulations called 
the Fundamental Orders was adopted, and established Connecticut as a self-ruled 
entity. By 1639 these settlers had started new towns in the surrounding 
areas. Roger Ludlowe, framer of the Fundamental Orders, purchased the land 
presently Fairfield, and established the name. According to historian John 
M. Taylor: "Early in 1639 the General Court granted a commission to Ludlow 
to begin a plantation at Pequannocke. He was on that errand, with a few 
others from Windsor, afterwards joined by immigrants from Watertown and 
Concord. He bought a large tract of land from the Pequannocke sachems, 
- afterwards greatly enlarged by other purchases to the westward,- and 
recalling the attractive region beyond (Uncoa), which he had personally 
seen on the second Pequot expedition, he also “set down” there, having 
purchased the territory embraced in the present town of Fairfield, to which 
he gave its name."[4] Fairfield was one of the two principal settlements 
of the Connecticut Colony in southeastern Connecticut (the other was Stratford). 
The town line with Stratford was set in May 1661 by John Banks, an early 
Fairfield settler, Richard Olmstead, and Lt. Joseph Judson, who were appointed 
as a committee by the Colony of Connecticut.[5] The town line with Norwalk 
was not set until May 1685.[6] Over time, it gave rise to several new towns 
that broke off and incorporated separately. The following is a list of 
towns created from parts of Fairfield. When the American Revolutionary 
War began in the 1770s, Fairfielders were caught in the crisis as much 
as, if not more than, the rest of their neighbors in Connecticut. In a 
predominantly Tory section of the colony, the people of Fairfield were 
early supporters of the cause for independence. Throughout the war, a constant 
battle was being fought across Long Island Sound as men from British-controlled 
Long Island raided the coast in whaleboats and privateers. Gold Selleck 
Silliman, whose home still stands on Jennings Road, was put in charge of 
the coastal defenses. In the spring of 1779, he was kidnapped from his 
home by Tory forces in preparation for a British raid on Fairfield County. 
His wife, Mary Silliman, watched from their home as, on the morning of 
July 7, 1779, approximately 2,000 enemy troops landed on Fairfield Beach 
near Pine Creek Point and proceeded to invade the town. When they left 
the following evening, the entire town lay in ruins, burned to the ground 
as punishment for Fairfield's support of the rebel cause. Ten years later, 
President George Washington noted after traveling through Fairfield that 
"the destructive evidences of British cruelty are yet visible both in Norwalk 
and Fairfield; as there are the chimneys of many burnt houses standing 
in them yet."[7] Fairfield recovered slowly from the burning, but soon 
after the end of the war its houses and public buildings had all been rebuilt. 
World War I brought Fairfield out of its agrarian past by triggering an 
unprecedented economic boom in Bridgeport, the center of a large munitions 
industry. The prosperity created a housing shortage in the city, and many 
of the workers looked to Fairfield to build their homes. The trolley and 
later the automobile made the countryside accessible to these newly rich 
members of the middle class, who brought with them new habits, new attitudes, 
and new modes of dress. The prosperity lasted through the twenties. By 
the time of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the population had increased 
to 17,000 from the 6,000 it had been just before the war. Even during the 
Depression, the town kept growing. The grounding of a barge with two crewmen 
on Penfield Reef in Fairfield during a gale led to the first civilian helicopter 
hoist rescue in history, on November 29, 1945. The helicopter flew from 
the nearby Sikorsky Aircraft plant in Bridgeport. Fairfield became the 
home of the corporate headquarters of General Electric (GE), one of the 
world's largest companies. The opening of the Connecticut Turnpike in the 
1950s brought another wave of development to Fairfield, and by the 1960s 
the town's residential, suburban character was firmly established. The 
town is on the shore of Long Island Sound. According to the United States 
Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 31.3 square miles (81 km2), 
of which 30.0 square miles (78 km2) is land and 3.4 square kilometres (1.3 sq mi), 
or 4.15%, is water. The Mill River, the waters of which feed Lake Mohegan, 
flows through the town. Fairfield consists of many neighborhoods. The best 
known are wealthy Southport, where General Electric Chief Executive Officer 
Jack Welch lived for many years, and Greenfield Hill, with its large areas, 
famous dogwood trees, and picturesque green with its white-spired Congregational 
church. Other well established neighborhoods include Stratfield, Tunxis 
Hill, the University area, Grasmere, Mill Plain, Knapp's Village, Melville 
Village, Holland Hill, and the Fairfield Beach area, which has recently 
undergone a renaissance with the construction of many new homes by residents 
wishing to live in proximity to the beach and downtown.[8] Two shopping 
districts in town include the Post Road (U.S. 1) and Black Rock Turnpike.
