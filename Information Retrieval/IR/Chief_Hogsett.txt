Elon Chester "Chief" Hogsett (November 2, 1903 – July 17, 2001) was a sub-marining 
left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played 11 seasons in the 
American League with the Detroit Tigers (1929–36; 1944), St. Louis Browns 
(1936–37), and Washington Senators (1938). Born on a farm outside Brownell, 
Kansas, Hogsett was raised in the home of an abusive alcoholic who married 
his stepmother; he left home when he was 14 years old. He pitched for the 
high school team in Brownell, where he developed his "submarine" pitching 
technique. He joined a professional team in Cushing, Oklahoma, and it was 
there that Hogsett was given the nickname "Chief." Hogsett had this to 
say about the nickname: "I roomed with a full-blooded Kiowa Indian and 
the nickname just kind of stuck. Am I really Indian? Well, I'm one-thirty-second 
Cherokee on my mother's side." (Richard Bak, "Cobb Would Have Caught It" 
(Wayne State Univ. Press 1991), p. 252.) During his major league career 
in Detroit, "Chief" Hogsett was greeted with "war whoops" by the fans at 
Navin Field when he took the mound. Hogsett pitched primarily in relief, 
twice leading the league in games finished. He appeared in two World Series 
with the Tigers, in 1934 and 1935. In 330 career games, Hogsett threw 1,222 
innings with 114 games started, 160 games finished, and 33 saves. Hogsett 
worked a liquor saleaman after his baseball career ended. He lived in Hays,
