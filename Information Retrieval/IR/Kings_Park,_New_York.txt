to its east across the Nissequogue River, by Fort Salonga to its west,

Center instead of New York City. Kings Park is located at 40°53′19″N 73°14′33″W﻿

County (before becoming part of New York City) in 1885 after Dr. Oliver 
Dewing's successful campaign to develop a hospital for the mentally ill 
on an 870-acre (3.5 km2) plot of land. The hospital was originally called 
Kings County Farm, a care center for the poor and mentally ill operated 
by Brooklyn officials. Kings County Farm is the origin of the name Kings 
Park. In 1954 the Center's patient population peaked at 9,303. The Center 
was a key source of employment for the area during this time period, and 
was perhaps the most important factor in the hamlet's development. Increasing 
costs to run hospital facilities and changing views about integrating the 
mentally ill into the population at large led to a large-scale movement 
of patient population back into society. As patient totals declined, so 
did employment at the center. The decrease in state employment caused a 
demographic shift, as an increasing percentage of the population became 
employed in New York City. There are numerous studies tying this deinstitutionalization 
of mentally ill patients to increased homelessness and crime in New York 
City in the 1970s. In 1996, the KPPC property closed. The remaining patients 
were transferred to Pilgrim Psychiatric Center. The waterfront portion 
of the former hospital was reopened as Nissequogue River State Park in 
2000. Also, the rail spur was converted to a bike path in 2003. The State 
of New York has abandoned a deal to sell the property to Cherokee Northeast/Arker 
Companies for remediation and future redevelopment. The plans have been 
opposed vehemently by many townspeople, most notably the Kings Park Coalition 
Against High Density Housing, and has become an important political issue 
in many local political campaigns. Other development options for the property 
have included a Long Island Rail Road service facility as well as a college 
campus. Sunken Meadow State Park borders Long Island Sound and is accessible 
by the Sunken Meadow State Parkway. It is a part of the New York State 
Parks system. In addition to the water, the park boasts 6 miles (10 km) 
of public trails and 27 holes of golf. The park's facilities make it ideally 
suited for many activities, among them various distance running competitions. 
The infamous "Cardiac Hill" is well known by local runners. The Nissequogue 
River, 6 miles (10 km) in length, empties into Long Island Sound and is 
readily accessible for all manner of water activities. The scenic river 
snakes through the recently christened Nissequogue River State Park. Raleigh's 
Poultry Farm Kings Park is the hometown of Houston Astros catcher/second 
baseman/outfielder Craig Biggio. Biggio has been named one of the five 
greatest second basemen of all time by renowned baseball statistician Bill 
James. He is also the modern-era record-holder for HBPs with 273, and the 
only player in history to be named an All-Star at both the catcher and 
second baseman positions.[citation needed] Biggio was elected into the 
National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. Other notable residents: Kings 
Park was home to the Long Island Kingsmen Drum and Bugle Corps from 1965 
to 1984. The Kingsmen were the American Legion National Champions in 1978 
and 1979 and the VFW National Champions in 1979. The corps placed 21st 
in 1979 and 16th in 1980 at the Drum Corps International (DCI) World Championships.
