Don Schaly (October 10, 1937 – March 9, 2005) was an American baseball 
coach. He was the baseball coach at Marietta College in Ohio for 40 years, 
from 1964 to 2003. Schaly, a native of Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, retired 
following the 2003 season after 40 years at the helm of the Marietta baseball 
program. On March 9, 2005, he died after a short battle with cancer while 
attending the Pioneers' Spring Trip in Venice, Florida. The 1959 graduate 
of Marietta College played baseball and football for the Pioneers. He returned 
to his alma mater in 1964 and never left, guiding his teams to three NCAA 
Division III National Championships and seven National Runner-up finishes. 
He won 18 Mideast Regional Championships and 27 Ohio Athletic Conference 
Championships. The coach won numerous coaching awards during his career. 
He was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall 
of Fame in 1995. Schaly was named the National Coach of the Year four times 
(1975, 1981, 1983 and 1986) and in 2000 Collegiate Baseball named him the 
Division III Coach of the Century. Schaly was also awarded the OAC's Coach 
of the Year 17 times and the Mideast Regional Coach of the year 21 times. 
Schaly's final record at Marietta is 1,442–329, but Schaly’s role in the 
Marietta College Athletics Department extended far beyond the duties of 
head baseball coach. He was an assistant football coach for 17 years and 
served as an assistant athletics director for more than 20 years. Schaly 
also played a primary role in the formation of the Marietta College Athletic 
Hall of Fame, which he was inducted into in 2004. Schaly was honored on 
November 8, 2003, at a banquet to celebrate his accomplishments at Marietta. 
He became the first person in Marietta College history to have his jersey 
retired. The college also renamed the main entrance of Ban Johnson Arena 
the Schaly Lobby in his honor. In 2006, Pioneer Park was renamed Don Schaly
