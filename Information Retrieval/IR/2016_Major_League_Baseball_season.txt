The 2016 Major League Baseball season began on April 3, 2016 with a Sunday 
afternoon matchup between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
the two teams with the best regular season records in 2015, at PNC Park 
in Pittsburgh. The regular season ended on Sunday, October 2, 2016, and 
the postseason on Wednesday, November 2, 2016, with the Chicago Cubs coming 
back from a three games to one deficit to defeat the Cleveland Indians 
in the World Series and win their first championship since 1908. The Major 
League Baseball All-Star Game's 87th edition was played on July 12 at Petco 
Park in San Diego, California, home of the San Diego Padres. The American 
League was awarded home-field advantage in the World Series by winning 
the game 4–2. The Civil Rights Game was not played this year. As was the 
case in 2015, teams were scheduled to play 19 games against each division 
opponent for a total of 76 games, and six or seven games against each team 
from the other two divisions in its league for a total of 66 games. All 
teams were scheduled to play 20 interleague games throughout the season. 
For 2016, the interleague matchups were to be AL East vs. NL West, AL Central 
vs. NL East, and AL West vs. NL Central. On July 3, 2016, the Atlanta Braves 
and Miami Marlins played a special neutral-site game at Fort Bragg Stadium, 
a newly constructed field in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in observance 
of the Independence Day long weekend. It was the first professional, regular-season 
sporting event held on an active military installation.[1] A two-game series 
between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Miami Marlins was also scheduled for 
Hiram Bithorn Stadium in Puerto Rico in May 2016; however, on May 6, 2016, 
Major League Baseball announced that the Puerto Rico games would be postponed 
due to the ongoing Zika virus epidemic, and moved back to Marlins Park.[2] 
In February 2016, Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players 
Association agreed to two rule changes. The Arizona Diamondbacks unveiled 
their new uniform concept for 2016 on December 3, 2015. The San Diego Padres 
introduced new uniforms with a blue and yellow color scheme. The silhouetted 
batter logo will appear on the back belt loop of pants.[101] The New Era 
flag logo began to appear on all authentic game-used caps, starting with 
the 2016 postseason. The Milwaukee Brewers added a new alternate uniform 
with modern colors and a retro design.[102] The Minnesota Twins added a 
red alternate to their uniform lineup. It features the TC logo on the chest. 
Although the Twins announced they would be worn on Fridays, they wore the 
alternate on April 25 and September 5 (Labor Day), both Monday; they wore 
it on other days as well. The Philadelphia Phillies added a red alternate 
that they will wear on mid-week home matinee games. The following teams 
will wear commemorative patches for special occasions: The Pirates will 
wear yellow 1979 throwbacks on home Sunday games, replacing the 1971 throwbacks.[104] 
The Pirates did wear their 1971 throwbacks on September 7, Roberto Clemente 
Day. The Mets will wear 1986 throwbacks on Sunday home games throughout 
the season to mark the 30th anniversary of their 1986 World Series title. 
They also wore them on May 27 and 28.[105] The Braves and Royals wore Negro 
Leagues throwbacks on May 15. The Braves wore the uniforms of the Atlanta 
Black Crackers, and the Royals wore the uniforms of the Kansas City Monarchs.[106] 
The Phillies and Brewers wore 1976 throwbacks from June 3–5. The Phillies'

of the season. Players, coaches, and umpires at all games wore #42 on April

April 11 for breaking the color barrier for umpires. On April 18 (Patriots' 
Day), the Boston Red Sox wore home white jerseys with "BOSTON" written 
on the front to mark the three year anniversary of the Boston Marathon 
bombings. The uniform also sported the 2013 navy-blue circular patch with 
a white border on the left shoulder saying "B Strong" (with the red B in 
the classic font featured on the Red Sox's caps). The Red Sox wore a patch 
on April 21 to mark Earth Day. The patch is of the two hanging socks surrounded

televised games on its flagship telecast, Sunday Night Baseball, as well 
as Monday and Wednesday nights. TBS televised Sunday afternoon games for

Communications announced that all Blue Jays home games on Sportsnet during 
the 2016 season would be broadcast in 4K.[121] In November 2015, after 
negotiations surrounding revenue sharing and infrastructural mandates (including 
a proposed requirement that the games only be available through the league's 
existing apps), Fox Sports Networks reached a three-year deal with Major 
League Baseball to allow in-market, authenticated online streaming for 
eligible pay TV subscribers via Fox Sports Go, of regional telecasts for 
the sixteen teams it holds rights to, beginning in the 2016 season.[122][123][124]
