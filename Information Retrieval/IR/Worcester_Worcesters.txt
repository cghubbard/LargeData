Pink, black           The Worcester Worcesters were a 19th-century Major 
League Baseball team from 1880 to 1882 in the National League.[1] The team 
is referred to, at times, as the Brown Stockings[2] or the Ruby Legs;[1] 
however, no contemporary sources from the time exist that support the use 
of either name.[3] The Ruby Legs played their home games at the Worcester 
Driving Park Grounds in the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds, located 
south of Highland Street between Sever Street and Russell Street in Worcester, 
Massachusetts.[4] In 1879, Worcester played in the minor league National 
Association. The National League was interested in Worcester as a potential 
replacement for the failed Syracuse Stars franchise primarily based on 
the performance of their ace pitcher, Lee Richmond, who pitched several 
exhibition games against National League opponents and went 6–2. He also 
pitched and won one game for the Boston Red Stockings. To admit Worcester 
to the National League, the league's board of directors waived the requirement 
that league cities have a population of at least 75,000 (Worcester's population 
was 58,000). To raise the capital to support their entry into the major 
leagues, the team sold shares for $35 (with the price including a season 
ticket), sponsored a walking race that attracted 3,000 people, arranged 
for discount packages of train fare and baseball tickets for fans from 
outside the city, and held benefit concerts and dramatic performances.[5] 
In December 1879, Worcester became the first professional baseball team 
to visit Cuba. The trip was a financial failure, as they were only able 
to play two games against Cuban teams.[6] On June 12, 1880, pitcher Lee 
Richmond threw the first perfect game in Major League history, against 
the Cleveland Blues.[7] The team made history again on August 20 of the 
same year by becoming the first team to be no-hit at home, when Pud Galvin 
of the Buffalo Bisons defeated them 1-0.[7] According to Lee Allen, Cincinnati 
writer and eventual director of the Baseball Hall of Fame, the Worcester 
club impacted the National League in another way in 1880; it was instrumental 
in having the Cincinnati Reds expelled from the league after the season, 
due to violations of the league rules against selling beer at the ballpark. 
In his 1948 book, The Cincinnati Reds (published by Putnam), Allen took 
some satisfaction in pointing out that the Reds re-formed in 1882, initially 
as a member of the American Association, the same year that Worcester's 
days as a major league franchise, as well as their influence, came to an 
end. The Worcester team was dropped from the league shortly before the 
end of the 1882 season, as Worcester was seen as too small to support major 
league sport; the team was encouraged to finish out its schedule as a lame 
duck team. Their last two games of the season against the Troy Trojans 
(also expelled from the NL for the same reasons) drew only 6 and 25 fans 
respectively; the attendance of six is a record low attendance for all 
league games open to spectators.[8][9] Needing an eighth team to balance 
the schedule, the National League granted an expansion franchise to the 
Philadelphia Phillies (who were also alternatively known as the Quakers 
until 1890). Many sources suggest that the Worcester club was moved to 
Philadelphia; however, only the franchise rights were moved. All available 
evidence suggests there is no direct link between the two teams (most significantly, 
no players from the 1882 Worcester club ended up with the 1883 Phillies).
