The USA Sevens (also sometimes referred to as the Las Vegas Sevens) is 
a rugby sevens tournament held annually during the second weekend of February 
in Las Vegas in the United States. The USA Sevens is the largest annual 
rugby competition in North America, drawing over 60,000 fans, and is broadcast 
live in the United States by NBC and NBC Sports. The USA Sevens was introduced 
in 2004, and has been held at its current home, Sam Boyd Stadium in Las 
Vegas every February since 2010. The USA Sevens tournament features 16 
teams representing countries from every continent, including the host, 
the U.S. national team. The USA Sevens is the fifth of ten tournaments 
on the Sevens World Series. The Sevens World Series is played throughout 
the world at nine other venues: Australia, Dubai, South Africa, New Zealand, 
Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, France, and London. The tournament consists 
of 16 countries participating in 45 matches over a three-day weekend. The 
16 teams are divided into four pools of four teams, with seeding determined 
by finishes in the previous competition in the Sevens World Series. Wins 
are worth three points, draws two, and losses one. The top two teams from 
each group progress to the quarterfinals to compete for the Cup (places 
1-4) and Plate (places 5-8). The bottom two teams from each group participate 
in the Bowl (places 9-12) and Shield (places 13-16) competitions. Through 
the 2011–12 edition, the sixteen participating teams were the 12 "core" 
members of the Sevens World Series circuit, along with 4 additional qualifying 
teams—other teams that qualified multiple times during the 2009–2012 span 
included Japan, Canada, Uruguay and Guyana. Starting with the 2012–13 season, 
the number of core teams increased from 12 to 15, with Canada, Spain and 
Portugal earning the three new slots. The USA Sevens is the largest annual 
rugby competition in North America. The tournament has grown in popularity 
since the tournament began in 2004. In recent years, a number of events 
have accelerated the surge in popularity, including the announcement in 
2009 that rugby would return to the Summer Olympics, the general growth 
of rugby in the United States, the improved performance of the U.S. national 
rugby team including their success in reaching the semi-finals of the 2009 
USA Sevens, and NBC's decision to begin televising the tournament beginning 
in 2011. Tournament attendance has grown rapidly since its inception in 
2004. The tournament drew 15,800 fans in 2004,[8] 25,000 fans in 2007,[9] 
35,773 in 2008,[10] and 37,000 fans in 2009.[11] The tournament switched 
to a three-day format in 2011.[12] The 2012 tournament's second-day attendance 
of 30,112 set a new record for the largest crowd to watch a rugby event 
in the United States.[13] The 2013 tournament broke attendance records 
again, with total attendance of 67,341.[14] The 2014 tournament again saw 
record attendance, with 68,608 fans, despite the fact that the tournament 
had been moved to January to avoid the 2014 Winter Olympics.[15] The profile 
and visibility of the USA Sevens has increased in the United States since 
NBC began broadcasting the tournament in 2011, marking the first time that 
the tournament had live television coverage on network TV in the United 
States. NBC Sports and Universal Sports broadcast eight hours of live coverage 
of the 2011 tournament, including 4 hours of coverage on NBC. NBC increased 
its television coverage for the 2012 tournament, showing 10 hours of live 
coverage, including 4 hours on NBC and 4 hours on NBC Sports.[16] The 2012 
USA Sevens earned strong ratings of 0.7 on NBC, beating other popular sports 
events that weekend such as the Detroit v. Philadelphia NHL game (0.4) 
and the Alabama v. LSU basketball game (0.3).[17] NBC again increased its 
TV coverage in 2013, with 16 hours of coverage across three channels, including 
4 hours on NBC and 6 hours on NBC Sports.[18] The 2014 USA Sevens drew 
ratings of 0.7 on Saturday and 1.0 on Sunday.[19] The 2016 USA Sevens had 
7 hours of TV coverage across NBCSN and NBC, but only 1 hour on NBC. NBC 
Sports has displayed an increased interest in broadcasting rugby since 
the International Olympic Committee's announcement in 2009 that rugby would 
return to the Summer Olympics in 2016.[20] NBC Sports has recognized that 
its partnership with USA Sevens to broadcast the tournament will help grow 
the sport of rugby in the United States.[21] Fueled in part by the publicity 
generated by the NBC broadcasts and rugby's return to the Olympics, the 
USA Sevens has been successful in lining up several blue-chip corporate 
sponsors. For the 2011 tournament, sponsors included Bridgestone, Toyota, 
Subway and ADT.[22] The tournament was similarly successful in landing 
commercial sponsors for 2012, including Adidas, Pepsi, DHL, Subway and 
others.[23] Effective with the 2010–11 series, the London-based global 
financial services company HSBC became the title sponsor of the overall 
IRB Sevens World Series. The USA Sevens tournament has been a part of the 
Sevens World Series every year since its 2004 debut. This makes the USA 
Sevens tournament one of the longer running consecutive hosts on the circuit. 
The USA Sevens debuted at The Home Depot Center in the Los Angeles suburb 
of Carson, California in February 2004. This competition marked the first 
time the United States ever hosted an official IRB event of international 
importance. USA Rugby was awarded the right to host the USA Sevens for 
three years, in part because rugby was recognized as one of the fastest 
growing team sports in the U.S.[24] In 2005, USA Rugby sold a 90% interest 
in USA Sevens, LLC to United World Sports, LLC, with USA Rugby retaining 
the remaining 10% ownership interest.[25] In August 2006, USA Rugby and 
the International Rugby Board renewed the contract for the USA Sevens to 
remain in the IRB Sevens World Series. The USA Sevens tournament was held 
from 2007 to 2009 in San Diego at Petco Park, the home field of the San 
Diego Padres of Major League Baseball. San Diego was an appealing location 
because the average high temperature in San Diego in February is a balmy 
72 °F (22 °C). Las Vegas then won the right to host the annual event beginning 
in 2010, beating out competition from San Francisco, Phoenix, and Orlando.[26] 
In 2015, World Rugby reached an agreement with USA Rugby and with the tournament's 
organizers: World Rugby would continue to place the USA Sevens tournament 
in Las Vegas if the tournament organizers agreed to widen the field at
