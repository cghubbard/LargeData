Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New 
York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at 
the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County further east 
on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs 
of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, 
the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), 
with a census-estimated 2,339,150 residents in 2015, approximately 48% 
of them foreign-born.[1] Queens County also is the second-most populous 
county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of 
Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most 
densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in 
the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent 
city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous city, after 
Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn.[2] Queens is the most ethnically diverse 
urban area in the world.[3][4] Queens was established in 1683 as one of 
the original 12 counties of New York. It was named after the Portuguese 
Princess Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705), Queen of England, Scotland, 
and Ireland.[5][6] It became a borough of New York City in 1898, and from 
1683 until 1899, the County of Queens included what is now Nassau County. 
Queens has the most diversified economy of the five boroughs of New York 
City[7] It is home to JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. 
These airports are among the busiest in the world, causing the airspace 
above Queens to be the most congested in the country. Attractions in Queens 
include Flushing Meadows Park, Citi Field - home to the New York Mets baseball 
team, the US Open tennis tournament, Kaufman Astoria Studios, Silvercup 
Studios, and Aqueduct Racetrack. The borough has diverse housing, ranging 
from high-rise apartment buildings in the urban areas of western and central 
Queens, such as Jackson Heights, Flushing, Astoria, and Long Island City, 
to suburban neighborhoods in the eastern part of the borough such as Little 
Neck, Douglaston, and Bayside.[8][9] European colonization brought Dutch 
and English settlers, as a part of the New Netherland colony. First settlements 
occurred in 1635 followed by early colonizations at Maspeth in 1642,[10] 
and Vlissingen (now Flushing) in 1643.[11] Other early settlements included 
Newtown (now Elmhurst) and Jamaica. However, these towns were mostly inhabited 
by English settlers from New England via eastern Long Island (Suffolk County) 
subject to Dutch law.[12] After the capture of the colony by the English 
and its renaming as New York in 1664, the area (and all of Long Island) 
became known as Yorkshire. The Flushing Remonstrance signed by colonists 
in 1657 is considered a precursor to the United States Constitution's provision 
on freedom of religion in the Bill of Rights. The signers protested the 
Dutch colonial authorities' persecution of Quakers in what is today the 
borough of Queens. Originally, Queens County included the adjacent area 
now comprising Nassau County. It was an original county of New York State, 
one of twelve created on November 1, 1683.[13] The county was named after 
Catherine of Braganza, since she was queen of England at the time (she 
was Portugal's royal princess Catarina daughter of King John IV of Portugal). 
The county was founded alongside Kings County (Brooklyn, which was named 
after her husband, King Charles II), and Richmond County (Staten Island, 
named after his illegitimate son, the 1st Duke of Richmond).[14][15][16] 
On October 7, 1691, all counties in the Colony of New York were redefined. 
Queens gained North Brother Island, South Brother Island, and Huletts Island 
(today known as Rikers Island).[17] On December 3, 1768, Queens gained 
other islands in Long Island Sound that were not already assigned to a 
county but that did not abut on Westchester County (today's Bronx County).[18] 
Queens played a minor role in the American Revolution, as compared to Brooklyn, 
where the Battle of Long Island was largely fought. Queens, like the rest 
of Long Island, remained under British occupation after the Battle of Long 
Island in 1776 and was occupied throughout most of the rest of the Revolutionary 
War. Under the Quartering Act, British soldiers used, as barracks, the 
public inns and uninhabited buildings belonging to Queens residents. Even 
though many local people were against unannounced quartering, sentiment 
throughout the county remained in favor of the British crown. The quartering 
of soldiers in private homes, except in times of war, was banned by the 
Third Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nathan Hale was captured 
by the British on the shore of Flushing Bay in Queens before being executed 
by hanging in Manhattan for gathering intelligence. From 1683 until 1784, 
Queens County consisted of five towns: Flushing, Hempstead, Jamaica, Newtown, 
and Oyster Bay. On April 6, 1784, a sixth town, the Town of North Hempstead, 
was formed through secession by the northern portions of the Town of Hempstead.[19][20] 
The seat of the county government was located first in Jamaica,[21] but 
the courthouse was torn down by the British during the American Revolution 
to use the materials to build barracks.[22] After the war, various buildings 
in Jamaica temporarily served as courthouse and jail until a new building 
was erected about 1787 (and later completed) in an area near Mineola (now 
in Nassau County) known then as Clowesville.[23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] 
The 1850 census was the first in which the population of the three western 
towns exceeded that of the three eastern towns that are now part of Nassau 
County. Concerns were raised about the condition and distance of the old 
courthouse, and several sites were in contention for the construction of 
a new one.[40] In 1870, Long Island City split from the Town of Newtown, 
incorporating itself as a city, consisting of what had been the Village 
of Astoria and some unincorporated areas within the Town of Newtown. Around 
1874, the seat of county government was moved to Long Island City from 
Mineola.[36][41][42][43] On March 1, 1860, the eastern border between Queens 
County (later Nassau County) and Suffolk County was redefined with no discernible 
change.[44] On June 8, 1881, North Brother Island was transferred to New 
York County.[45] On May 8, 1884, Rikers Island was transferred to New York 
County.[46] In 1885, Lloyd Neck, which was part of the Town of Oyster Bay 
and was earlier known as Queens Village, seceded from Queens and became 
part of the Town of Huntington in Suffolk County.[47][48] On April 16, 
1964, South Brother Island was transferred to Bronx County.[49] The New 
York City Borough of Queens was authorized on May 4, 1897, by a vote of 
the New York State Legislature after an 1894 referendum on consolidation.[50] 
The eastern 280 square miles (730 km2) of Queens that became Nassau County 
was partitioned on January 1, 1899.[51] Queens Borough was established 
on January 1, 1898.[52][53][54][55] Long Island City, the towns of Newtown, 
Flushing, and Jamaica, and the Rockaway Peninsula portion of the Town of 
Hempstead were merged to form the new borough, dissolving all former municipal 
governments (Long Island City, the county government, all towns, and all 
villages) within the new borough.[56] The areas of Queens County that were 
not part of the consolidation plan,[42][57][58][59][60][61][62] consisting 
of the towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay, and the major remaining 
portion of the Town of Hempstead, remained part of Queens County until 
they seceded to form the new Nassau County on January 1, 1899. At this 
point, the boundaries of Queens County and the Borough of Queens became 
coterminous. With consolidation, Jamaica once again became the county seat, 
though county offices now extend to nearby Kew Gardens also.[63] The borough's 
administrative and court buildings are presently located in Kew Gardens 
and downtown Jamaica respectively, two neighborhoods that were villages 
of the former Town of Jamaica. From 1905 to 1908 the Long Island Rail Road 
in Queens became electrified. Transportation to and from Manhattan, previously 
by ferry or via bridges in Brooklyn, opened up with the Queensboro Bridge 
finished in 1909, and with railway tunnels under the East River in 1910. 
From 1915 onward, much of Queens was connected to the New York City Subway 
system.[64][65] With the 1915 construction of the Steinway Tunnel carrying 
the IRT Flushing Line between Queens and Manhattan, and the robust expansion 
of the use of the automobile, the population of Queens more than doubled 
in the 1920s, from 469,042 in 1920 to 1,079,129 in 1930.[66] In later years, 
Queens was the site of the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1964 New 
York World's Fair. LaGuardia Airport, in northern Queens, opened in 1939. 
Idlewild Airport, in southern Queens and now called JFK Airport, opened 
in 1948. American Airlines Flight 587 took off from the latter airport 
on November 12, 2001, but ended up crashing in Queens' Belle Harbor area, 
killing 265 people. In late October 2012, much of Queens' Breezy Point 
area was destroyed by a massive six-alarm fire caused by Hurricane Sandy. 
Queens is located on the far western portion of geographic Long Island 
and includes a few smaller islands, most of which are in Jamaica Bay, forming 
part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which in turn is one of the 
National Parks of New York Harbor.[68] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 
Queens County has a total area of 178 square miles (460 km2), of which 
109 square miles (280 km2) is land and 70 square miles (180 km2) (39%) 
is water.[69] Brooklyn, the only other New York City borough on geographic 
Long Island, lies just south and west of Queens, with Newtown Creek, an 
estuary that flows into the East River, forming part of the border. To 
the west and north is the East River, across which is Manhattan to the 
west and The Bronx to the north. Nassau County is east of Queens on Long 
Island. Staten Island is southwest of Brooklyn, and shares only a 3-mile-long 
water border (in the Outer Bay) with Queens. The Rockaway Peninsula, the 
most southernly part of all of Long Island, sits between Jamaica Bay and 
the Atlantic Ocean, featuring the most prominent public beaches in Queens.[70][71] 
Flushing Bay and the Flushing River are in the north, connecting to the 
East River. The East River opens into Long Island Sound. The midsection 
of Queens is crossed by the Long Island straddling terminal moraine created 
by the Wisconsin Glacier. Under the Köppen climate classification, using 
the 32 °F (0 °C) coldest month (January) isotherm, Queens and the rest 
of New York City have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) with partial shielding 
from the Appalachian Mountains and moderating influences from the Atlantic 
Ocean. Queens receives plentiful precipitation all year round with 44.8 in 
(1,140 mm) yearly. Extremes range from 107 °F (41.6 °C) to -3 °F (-19.4 °C). 
Winters are relatively mild compared to other areas of New York State, 
though snow is common and blizzards occur about every 4–6 years. Springs 
are unpredictable and can be chilly to very warm. Summers are hot, humid, 
and wet. Autumn is similar to spring, while snowfall generally begins in 
December. See Geography of New York City for additional climate information 
from the outer boroughs. Four United States Postal Service postal zones 
serve Queens, based roughly on those serving the towns in existence at 
the consolidation of the five boroughs into New York City: Long Island 
City (ZIP codes starting with 111), Jamaica (114), Flushing (113), and 
Far Rockaway (116). In addition, the Floral Park post office (110), based 
in Nassau County, serves a small part of northeastern Queens. Each of these 
main post offices have neighborhood stations with individual ZIP codes, 
and unlike the other boroughs, these station names are often used in addressing 
letters. These ZIP codes do not always reflect traditional neighborhood 
names and boundaries; "East Elmhurst", for example, was largely coined 
by the USPS and is not an official community. Most neighborhoods have no 
solid boundaries. The Forest Hills and Rego Park neighborhoods, for instance, 
overlap. Residents of Queens often closely identify with their neighborhood 
rather than with the borough or city. The borough is a patchwork of dozens 
of unique neighborhoods, each with its own distinct identity: Since 2010, 
the population of Queens was estimated by the United States Census Bureau 
to have increased 4.9% to 2,339,150, as of 2015 – Queens' estimated population 
represented 27.4% of New York City's population of 8,550,405; 29.8% of 
Long Island's population of 7,838,722; and 11.8% of New York State's population 
of 19,795,791.[1][93][94][95][96][97] According to 2012 census estimates, 
27.2% of the population was Non-Hispanic White,[91] 20.9% Black or African 
American, 24.8% Asian, 12.9% from some other race, and 2.7% of two or more 
races. 27.9% of Queens's population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (of 
any race).[98] The New York City Department of City Planning was alarmed 
by the negligible reported increase in population between 2000 and 2010. 
Areas with high proportions of immigrants and undocumented aliens are traditionally 
undercounted for a variety of reasons, often based on a mistrust of government 
officials or an unwillingness to be identified. In many cases, counts of 
vacant apartment units did not match data from local surveys and reports 
from property owners.[99] As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 
2,229,379 people, 782,664 households, and 537,690 families residing in 
the county. The population density was 20,409.0 inhabitants per square 
mile (7,879.6/km²). There were 817,250 housing units at an average density 
of 7,481.6 per square mile (2,888.5/km²). The racial makeup of the county 
was 44.08% White, 20.01% Black or African American, 0.50% Native American, 
17.56% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 11.68% from other races, and 6.11% 
from two or more races. 24.97% of the population were Hispanic or Latino 
of any race. In Queens, approximately 48.5% of the population was foreign-born 
as of 2010. Of that, 49.5% were born in Latin America, 33.5% in Asia, 14.8% 
in Europe, 1.8% in Africa, and 0.4% in North America. Roughly 2.1% of the 
population was born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or abroad to American 
parents. In addition, 51.2% of the population was born in the United States. 
Approximately 44.2% of the population over 5 years of age speak English 
at home; 23.8% speak Spanish at home. Also, 16.8% of the populace speak 
other Indo-European languages at home. Another 13.5% speak an Asian language 
at home.[100] Among the Asian population, people of Chinese ethnicity make 
up the largest ethnic group at 10.2% of Queens' population, with about 
237,484 people;[72] the other East and Southeast Asian groups are: Koreans 
(2.9%), Filipinos (1.7%), Japanese (0.3%), Thais (0.2%), Vietnamese (0.2%), 
and Indonesians and Burmese both make up 0.1% of the population.[98] People 
of South Asian descent make up 7.8% of Queens' population: Indians (5.3%), 
Bangladeshi (1.5%), Pakistanis (0.7%), and Nepali (0.2%).[98] Among the 
Hispanic population, Puerto Ricans make up the largest ethnic group at 
4.6%, next to Mexicans, who make up 4.2% of the population, and Dominicans 
at 3.9%. Central Americans make up 2.4% and are mostly Salvadorans. South 
Americans constitute 9.6% of Queens's population, mainly of Ecuadorian 
(4.4%) and Colombian descent (3.2%).[98] Some main European ancestries 
in Queens as of 2000 include: The Hispanic or Latino population increased 
by 61% to 597,773 between 1990 and 2006 and now accounts for 26.5% of the 
borough's population. Queens is now home to hundreds of thousands of Latinos 
and Hispanics: Queens is home to 49.6% of the city's Asian population. 
Among the five boroughs, Queens has the largest population of Chinese, 
Indian, Korean, Filipino, Bangladeshi and Pakistani Americans. Queens has 
the largest Asian American population by county outside the Western United 
States; according to the 2006 American Community Survey, Queens ranks fifth 
among US counties with 477,772 (21.18%) Asian Americans, behind Los Angeles 
County, California, Honolulu County, Hawaii, Santa Clara County, California, 
and Orange County, California. The borough is also home to one of the highest 
concentrations of Indian Americans in the nation, with an estimated population 
of 144,896 in 2014 (6.24% of the 2014 borough population),[102] as well 
as Pakistani Americans, who number at 15,604.[103] Queens has the second 
largest Sikh population in the nation after California.[104] In 2010, Queens 
held a disproportionate share of several Asian communities within New York 
City, relative to its overall population, as follows:[105] Queens has the 
third largest Bosnian population in the United States behind only St. Louis 
and Chicago, numbering more than 15,000.[106] A 2011 UJA/Federation of 
New York study found that Queens was home to 198,000 Jewish Americans, 
up from 186,000 in 2002.[107][verification needed] There were 782,664 households 
out of which 31.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.9% 
were married couples living together, 16.0% had a female householder with 
no husband present, and 31.3% were non-families. 25.6% of all households 
were made up of individuals and 9.7% had someone living alone who was 65 
years of age or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average 
family size was 3.39. In the county the population was spread out with 
22.8% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 33.1% from 25 to 44, 21.7% 
from 45 to 64, and 12.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median 
age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 92.9 males. For every 
100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.6 males. The median income for 
a household in the county was $37,439, and the median income for a family 
was $42,608. Males had a median income of $30,576 versus $26,628 for females. 
The per capita income for the county was $19,222. About 16.9% of families 
and 24.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.8% 
of those under age 18 and 13.0% of those age 65 or over. In Queens, the 
black population earns more than whites on average.[108] Many of these 
African Americans live in quiet, middle class suburban neighborhoods near 
the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have 
large black populations whose family income is higher than average. Those 
areas are known for their well kept homes, suburban feel, and low crime 
rate. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been 
long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral 
Park, and Flushing, etc. (most of the outgoing population has been replaced 
with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, 
North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, Little Neck, and Douglaston 
have not had a substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an 
increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has recently 
experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods very desirable 
for people who want to reside near Manhattan in a less urban setting. According 
to a 2001 Claritas study, Queens is the most diverse county in the United 
States among counties of 100,000+ population.[109] While Queens has not 
been the center of any major artistic movements, it has been the home of 
such notable artists as Tony Bennett, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Simon, 
and Robert Mapplethorpe. The current poet laureate of Queens is Paolo Javier.[110] 
Queens has notably fostered African-American culture, with establishments 
such as The Afrikan Poetry Theatre[111] and the Black Spectrum Theater 
Company[112] catering specifically to African Americans in Queens. In the 
1940s, Queens was an important center of jazz; such jazz luminaries as 
Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Ella Fitzgerald took up residence 
in Queens, seeking refuge from the segregation they found elsewhere in 
New York.[113] Additionally, many notable hip-hop acts hail from Queens, 
including Nas, Run-D.M.C., Kool G Rap, A Tribe Called Quest, LL Cool J, 
Mobb Deep, 50 Cent, Nicki Minaj, and Heems of Das Racist. Queens hosts 
various museums and cultural institutions that serve its diverse communities. 
They range from the historical (such as the John Bowne House) to the scientific 
(such as the New York Hall of Science), from conventional art galleries 
(such as the Noguchi Museum) to unique graffiti exhibits (such as 5 Pointz). 
Queens's cultural institutions include, but are not limited to: The travel 
magazine Lonely Planet also named Queens the top destination in the country 
for 2015 for its cultural and culinary diversity.[114] Stating that Queens 
is "quickly becoming its hippest" but that "most travelers haven’t clued 
in… yet,"[115] the Lonely Planet stated that "nowhere is the image of New 
York as the global melting pot truer than Queens."[116] There are 138 languages 
spoken in the borough.[117] As of 2010, 43.84% (905,890) of Queens residents 
age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 23.88% 
(493,462) spoke Spanish, 8.06% (166,570) Chinese, 3.44% (71,054) various 
Indic languages, 2.74% (56,701) Korean, 1.67% (34,596) Russian, 1.56% (32,268) 
Italian, 1.54% (31,922) Tagalog, 1.53% (31,651) Greek, 1.32% (27,345) French 
Creole, 1.17% (24,118) Polish, 0.96% (19,868) Hindi, 0.93% (19,262) Urdu, 
0.92% (18,931) other Asian languages, 0.80% (16,435) other Indo-European 
languages, 0.71% (14,685) French, 0.61% (12,505) Arabic, 0.48% (10,008) 
Serbo-Croatian, and Hebrew was spoken as a main language by 0.46% (9,410) 
of the population over the age of five. In total, 56.16% (1,160,483) of 
Queens's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than 
English.[118] The cuisine available in Queens reflects its vast cultural 
diversity.[119] The cuisine of a particular neighborhood often represents 
its demographics; for example, Astoria hosts many Greek restaurants, in 
keeping with its traditionally Greek population.[120] Jackson Heights is 
known for its prominent Indian cuisine and also many Latin American eateries. 
Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, Queens has been governed by 
the New York City Charter that provides for a strong mayor-council system. 
The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, 
correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, 
water supply, and welfare services in Queens. The Queens Library is governed 
by a 19-member Board of Trustees, who are appointed by the Mayor of New 
York City and the Borough President of Queens. Since 1990 the Borough President 
has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the City 
Council, the New York state government, and corporations. Queens' Borough 
President is Melinda Katz, elected in November 2013 as a Democrat with 
80.3% of the vote . Queens Borough Hall is the seat of government and is 
located in Kew Gardens. The Democratic Party holds most public offices. 
Sixty-three percent of registered Queens voters are Democrats. Local party 
platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. 
Controversial political issues in Queens include development, noise, and 
the cost of housing. Each of the city's five counties has its own criminal 
court system and District Attorney, the chief public prosecutor who is 
directly elected by popular vote. Richard A. Brown, who ran on both the 
Republican and Democratic Party tickets, has been the District Attorney 
of Queens County since 1991.[121] Queens has 12 seats on the New York City 
Council, the second largest number among the five boroughs. It is divided 
into 14 community districts, each served by a local Community Board. Community 
Boards are representative bodies that field complaints and serve as advocates 
for local residents. Although Queens is heavily Democratic, it is considered 
a swing county in New York politics. Republican political candidates who 
do well in Queens usually win citywide or statewide elections. Republicans 
such as former Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg won majorities 
in Queens. Republican State Senator Serphin Maltese represented a district 
in central and southern Queens for twenty years until his defeat in 2008 
by Democratic City Councilman Joseph Addabbo. In 2002, Queens voted against 
incumbent Republican Governor of New York George Pataki in favor of his 
Democratic opponent, Carl McCall by a slim margin. However, Queens has 
not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1972, 
when Queens voters chose Richard Nixon over George McGovern. Since the 
1996 presidential election, Democratic presidential candidates have received 
over 70% of the popular vote in Queens. Queens has the second-largest economy 
of New York City's five boroughs, following Manhattan. In 2004, Queens 
had 15.2% (440,310) of all private sector jobs in New York City and 8.8% 
of private sector wages. Queens has the most diversified economy of the 
five boroughs, with occupations spread relatively evenly across the health 
care, retail trade, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and film 
and television production sectors, such that no single sector is overwhelmingly 
dominant.[7] The diversification in Queens' economy is reflected in the 
large amount of employment in the export-oriented portions of its economy—such 
as transportation, manufacturing, and business services—that serve customers 
outside the region. This accounts for more than 27% of all Queens jobs 
and offers an average salary of $43,727, 14% greater than that of jobs 
in the locally oriented sector. The borough's largest employment sector—trade, 
transportation, and utilities—accounted for nearly 30% of all jobs in 2004. 
Queens is home to two of the three major New York City area airports, JFK 
International Airport and LaGuardia Airport. These airports are among the 
busiest in the world, leading the airspace above Queens to be the most 
congested in the country. This airline industry is particularly important 
to the economy of Queens, providing almost one quarter of the sector's 
employment and more than 30% of the sector's wages. Education and health 
services is the next largest sector in Queens and comprised almost 24% 
of the borough's jobs in 2004. The manufacturing and construction industries 
in Queens are the largest of the City and account for nearly 17% of the 
borough's private sector jobs. Comprising almost 17% of the jobs in Queens 
is the information, financial activities, and business and professional 
services sectors. As of 2003[update], Queens had almost 40,000 business 
establishments. Small businesses act as an important part of the borough's 
economic vitality with two thirds of all business employing between one 
and four people. Several large companies have their headquarters in Queens, 
including watchmaker Bulova, based in East Elmhurst; internationally renowned 
piano manufacturer Steinway & Sons in Astoria; Glacéau, the makers of Vitamin 
Water, headquartered in Whitestone; and JetBlue Airways, an airline based 
in Long Island City. Long Island City is a major manufacturing and back 
office center. Flushing is a major commercial hub for Chinese American 
and Korean American businesses, while Jamaica is the major civic and transportation 
hub for the borough. Citi Field is a 41,922-seat stadium opened in April 
2009 in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park that is the home ballpark of the New 
York Mets of Major League Baseball.[122] Shea Stadium, the former home 
of the Mets and the New York Jets of the National Football League, as well 
as the temporary home of the New York Yankees and the New York Giants Football 
Team stood where Citi Field's parking lot is now located, operating from 
1964 to 2008.[123] The US Open tennis tournament has been played since 
1978 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, located just 
south of Citi Field.[124] With a capacity of 23,771, Arthur Ashe Stadium 
is the biggest tennis-specific stadium in the world.[125] The US Open was 
formerly played at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills.[126] in South 
Ozone Park is the home of Aqueduct Racetrack, which is operated by the 
New York Racing Association and offers Thoroughbred horse-racing from late 
October/early November through April.[127] According to the 2010 Census, 
36% of all Queens households did not own a car; the citywide rate is 53%. 
Therefore, mass transit is also used.[128] Queens has crucial importance 
in international and interstate air traffic, with two of the New York metropolitan 
area's three major airports located there. John F. Kennedy International 
Airport, with 27.4 million international passengers in 2014 (of 53.2 million 
passengers, overall), is the busiest airport in the United States by international 
passenger traffic.[129] Owned by the City of New York and managed since 
1947 by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the airport's runways 
and six terminals cover an area of 4,930 acres (2,000 ha) on Jamaica Bay 
in southeastern Queens.[130] LaGuardia Airport is located in Flushing, 
in northern Queens, on Flushing Bay. Originally opened in 1939, the airport's 
two runways and four terminals cover 680 acres (280 ha), serving 28.4 million 
passengers in 2015.[132] In 2014, citing outdated conditions in the airport's 
terminals, Vice President Joe Biden compared LaGuardia to a "third world 
country".[133] In 2015, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began 
a $4 billion project to completely reconstruct LaGuardia Airport's terminals 
and entry ways, with an estimated completion in 2021.[131] Twelve New York 
City Subway routes traverse Queens, serving 81 stations on seven main lines. 
The A, G, J/Z, and M routes connect Queens to Brooklyn without going through 
Manhattan first. The F, M, N, Q, and R trains connect Queens and Brooklyn 
via Manhattan, while the E and 7/<7> trains connect Queens to Manhattan 
only. Trains on the M service go through Queens twice in the same trip; 
both of its full-length termini, in Middle Village and Forest Hills, are 
in Queens. A commuter train system, the Long Island Rail Road, operates 
22 stations in Queens with service to Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. 
Jamaica station is a hub station where all the lines in the system but 
one (the Port Washington Branch) converge. It is the busiest commuter rail 
hub in the United States. Sunnyside Yard is used as a staging area by Amtrak 
and NJ Transit for intercity and commuter trains from Penn Station in Manhattan. 
61st Street – Woodside acts as one of the many LIRR connections to the 
New York City Subway. The elevated AirTrain people mover system connects 
JFK International Airport to the New York City Subway and the Long Island 
Rail Road along the Van Wyck Expressway;[134] a separate AirTrain system 
is planned alongside the Grand Central Parkway to connect LaGuardia Airport 
to these transit systems.[135][136] Plans were announced in July 2015 to 
entirely rebuild LaGuardia Airport itself in a multibillion-dollar project 
to replace its aging facilities, and this project would accommodate the 
new AirTrain connection.[131] About 100 local bus routes operate within 
Queens, and another 15 express routes shuttle commuters between Queens 
and Manhattan, under the MTA New York City Bus and MTA Bus brands. A streetcar 
line connecting Queens with Brooklyn was proposed by the city in February 
2016, with the planned timeline calling for service to begin around 2024. 
Queens is traversed by three trunk east-west highways. The Long Island 
Expressway (Interstate 495) runs from the Queens Midtown Tunnel on the 
west through the borough to Nassau County on the east. The Grand Central 
Parkway, whose western terminus is the Triborough Bridge, extends east 
to the Queens/Nassau border, where its name changes to the Northern State 
Parkway. The Belt Parkway begins at the Gowanus Expressway in Brooklyn, 
and extends east into Queens, past Aqueduct Racetrack and JFK Airport. 
On its eastern end at the Queens/Nassau border, it splits into the Southern 
State Parkway which continues east, and the Cross Island Parkway which 
turns north. There are also several major north-south highways in Queens, 
including the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (Interstate 278), the Van Wyck 
Expressway (Interstate 678), the Clearview Expressway (Interstate 295), 
and the Cross Island Parkway. Queensboro Bridge Throgs Neck Bridge Air 
Train JFK path above the Van Wyck Expressway Queens-Midtown Tunnel The

are laid out in a semi-grid system, with a numerical system of street names 
(similar to Manhattan and the Bronx). Nearly all roadways oriented north-south 
are "Streets", while east-west roadways are "Avenues", beginning with the 
number 1 in the west for Streets and in the north for Avenues. In some 
parts of the borough, several consecutive streets may share numbers (for 
instance, 72nd Street followed by 72nd Place and 72nd Lane, or 52nd Avenue 
followed by 52nd Road, 52nd Drive, and 52nd Court), often causing confusion 
for non-residents. In addition, incongruous alignments of street grids, 
unusual street paths due to geography, or other circumstances often lead 
to the skipping of numbers (for instance, on Ditmars Boulevard, 70th Street 
is followed by Hazen Street which is followed by 49th Street). Numbered 
roads tend to be residential, although numbered commercial streets are 
not rare. A fair number of streets that were country roads in the 18th 
and 19th centuries (especially major thoroughfares such as Northern Boulevard, 
Queens Boulevard, Hillside Avenue, and Jamaica Avenue) carry names rather 
than numbers, typically though not uniformly called "Boulevards" or "Parkways". 
Queens house numbering was designed to provide convenience in locating 
the address itself; the first half of a number in a Queens address refers 
to the nearest cross street, the second half refers to the house or lot 
number from where the street begins from that cross street, followed by 
the name of the street itself. For example, to find an address in Queens, 
14-01 120th Street, one could ascertain from the address structure itself 
that the listed address is at the intersection of 14th Avenue and 120th 
Street, and that the address must be closest to 14th Avenue rather than 
15th Avenue, as it is the first lot on the block. This pattern doesn't 
stop when a street is named, assuming that there is an existing numbered 
cross-street. For example, Queens College is situated at 65–30 Kissena 
Boulevard, and is so named because the cross-street closest to the entrance 
is 65th Avenue. Many of the village street grids of Queens had only worded 
names, some were numbered according to local numbering schemes, and some 
had a mix of words and numbers. In the early 1920s a "Philadelphia Plan" 
was instituted to overlay one numbered system upon the whole borough. The 
Topographical Bureau, Borough of Queens, worked out the details. Subway 
stations were only partly renamed, and some, including those along the 
IRT Flushing Line (7 <7> trains), now share dual names after the original 
street names.[137] In 2012, some numbered streets in the Douglaston Hill 
Historic District were renamed to their original names, with 43rd Avenue 
becoming Pine Street.[138] The Rockaway Peninsula does not follow the same 
system as the rest of the borough and has its own numbering system. Streets 
are numbered in ascending order heading west from near the Nassau County 
border, and are prefixed with the word "Beach." Streets at the easternmost 
end, however, are nearly all named. Streets in Bayswater, which is on Jamaica 
Bay, has its numbered streets prefixed with the word "Bay" rather than 
"Beach". Another deviation from the norm is Broad Channel; it maintains 
the north-south numbering progression but uses only the suffix "Road," 
as well as the prefixes "West" and "East," depending on location relative 
to Cross Bay Boulevard, the neighborhood's major through street. Broad 
Channel's streets were a continuation of the mainland Queens grid in the 
1950s; formerly the highest numbered avenue in Queens was 208th Avenue 
rather today's 165th Avenue in Howard Beach & Hamilton Beach. The other 
exception is the neighborhood of Ridgewood, which for the most part shares 
a grid and house numbering system with the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. 
The grid runs east-west from the LIRR Bay Ridge Branch right-of-way to 
Flushing Avenue; and north-south from Forest Avenue in Ridgewood to Bushwick 
Avenue in Brooklyn before adjusting to meet up with the Bedford-Stuyvesant 
grid at Broadway. All streets on the grid have names. Queens is connected 
to the Bronx by the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge, the 
Triborough (Robert F. Kennedy) Bridge, and the Hell Gate Bridge. Queens 
is connected to Manhattan Island by the Triborough Bridge, the Queensboro 
Bridge, and the Queens Midtown Tunnel, as well as to Roosevelt Island by 
the Roosevelt Island Bridge. While most of the Queens/Brooklyn border is 
on land, the Kosciuszko Bridge crosses the Newtown Creek connecting Maspeth 
to Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The Pulaski Bridge connects McGuinness Boulevard 
in Greenpoint to 11th Street, Jackson Avenue, and Hunters Point Avenue 
in Long Island City. The J. J. Byrne Memorial Bridge (a.k.a. Greenpoint 
Avenue Bridge) connects the sections of Greenpoint Avenue in Greenpoint 
and Long Island City. A lesser bridge connects Grand Avenue in Queens to 
Grand Street in Brooklyn. The Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, built 
in 1939, traverses Jamaica Bay to connect the Rockaway Peninsula to Broad 
Channel an the rest of Queens.[139] Constructed in 1937, the Marine Parkway–Gil 
Hodges Memorial Bridge links Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn's longest thoroughfare, 
with Jacob Riis Park and the western end of the Peninsula.[140] Both crossings 
were built and continue to be operated by what is now known as MTA Bridges 
and Tunnels. The IND Rockaway Line parallels the Cross Bay, has a mid-bay 
station at Broad Channel which is just a short walk from the Jamaica Bay 
Wildlife Refuge, now part of Gateway National Recreation Area and a major 
stop on the Atlantic Flyway. One year-round scheduled ferry service connects 
Queens and Manhattan. New York Water Taxi operates service across the East 
River from Hunters Point in Long Island City to Manhattan at 34th Street 
and south to Pier 11 at Wall Street. In 2007, limited weekday service was 
begun between Breezy Point, the westernmost point in the Rockaways, to 
Pier 11 via the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Summertime weekend service provides 
service from Lower Manhattan and southwest Brooklyn to the peninsula's 
Gateway beaches. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012, 
massive infrastructure damage to the IND Rockaway Line (A train) south 
of the Howard Beach – JFK Airport station severed all direct subway connections 
between the Rockaway Peninsula and Broad Channel, Queens and the Queens 
mainland for many months. Ferry operator SeaStreak began running a city-subsidized 
ferry service between a makeshift ferry slip at Beach 108th Street and 
Beach Channel Drive in Rockaway Park, Queens, and Pier 11/Wall Street, 
then continuing on to the East 34th Street Ferry Landing. In August 2013, 
a stop was added at Brooklyn Army Terminal.[141] Originally intended as 
just a stopgap alternative transportation measure until subway service 
was restored to the Rockaways, the ferry proved to be popular with both 
commuters and tourists and was extended several times, as city officials 
evaluated the ridership numbers to determine whether to establish the service 
on a permanent basis. Between its inception and December 2013, the service 
had carried close to 200,000 riders.[142] When the city government announced 
its budget in late June 2014 for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 
1, the ferry only received a $2 million further appropriation, enough to 
temporarily extend it again through October, but did not receive the approximately 
$8 million appropriation needed to keep the service running for the full 
fiscal year.[143] Despite last-minute efforts by local transportation advocates, 
civic leaders and elected officials, ferry service ended on October 31, 
2014. They promised to continue efforts to have the service restored.[144] 
Elementary and secondary school education in Queens is provided by a vast 
number of public and private institutions. Public schools in the borough 
are managed by the New York City Department of Education, the largest public 
school system in the United States. Most private schools are affiliated 
to or identify themselves with the Roman Catholic or Jewish religious communities. 
Townsend Harris High School is a Queens public magnet high school for the 
humanities consistently ranked as among the top 100 high schools in the 
United States. The Queens Borough Public Library is the public library 
system for the borough and one of three library systems serving New York 
City. Dating back to the foundation of the first Queens library in Flushing 
in 1858, the Queens Borough Public Library is one of the largest public 
library systems in the United States. Separate from the New York Public 
Library, it is composed of 63 branches throughout the borough. In fiscal 
year 2001, the Library achieved a circulation of 16.8 million. First in 
circulation in New York State since 1985, the Library has maintained the 
highest circulation of any city library in the country since 1985 and the 
highest circulation of any library in the nation since 1987. The Library 
maintains collections in many languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Korean, 
Russian, Haitian Creole, Polish, and six Indic languages, as well as smaller 
collections in 19 other languages. Various public figures have grown up 
or lived in Queens.[146] Musicians who have lived in the borough include 
singer Nadia Ali,[147] Tony Bennett,[148] rappers LL Cool J, Nas, Ja Rule, 
50 Cent, Run–D.M.C., Nicki Minaj, Rich The Kid, Simon & Garfunkel[149] 
and Johnny Ramone.[150] Actors such as Adrien Brody,[151] and Lucy Liu[152] 
and Idina Menzel[153] have been born and/or raised in Queens. Porn star 
Ron Jeremy was born in Queens.[154] Actor Mae West has also lived in Queens.[155] 
Physician Joshua Prager was born in Whitestone.[156] Mafia boss John Gotti 
lived in Queens for many years.[157] Donald Trump, a businessman and 45th 
President-elect of the United States, was born in the Queens neighborhood 
of Jamaica and raised in Jamaica Estates.[158][159] Marvel Comics character 
Spider-Man is also from Queens. Queens has also been home to athletes such 
as professional basketball player Rafer Alston[160] Basketball players 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar[161][162] and Metta World Peace[163][164] were both 
born in Queens. Olympic Athlete Bob Beamon.[165] Tennis star John McEnroe[166]
