Armando Antonio Galarraga Barreto (born January 15, 1982) is a Venezuelan 
former professional baseball pitcher. Galarraga made his Major League Baseball 
(MLB) debut with the Texas Rangers on September 15, 2007. He was traded 
to the Detroit Tigers at the end of the 2007 season and also played in 
MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks and Houston Astros. On June 2, 2010, while 
playing for the Tigers, he was deprived of a perfect game by an incorrect 
call made by first-base umpire Jim Joyce in the top of the ninth inning 
with two outs. He originally signed as a free agent with the Montreal Expos 
on October 31, 1998. He was acquired by the Texas Rangers from the Washington 
Nationals as part of the deal that sent Alfonso Soriano to the Nationals 
in 2005.[1] Galarraga made his Major League debut on September 15, 2007 
against the Oakland Athletics. He entered the game in the eighth inning, 
and pitched a scoreless inning. He allowed no hits and one base on balls.[2] 
On February 5, 2008, Galarraga was traded to the Detroit Tigers for Michael 
Hernandez, an outfielder that had spent the last season playing for the 
AA Erie Seawolves.[3] As a minor league call up for the injured Dontrelle 
Willis, Galarraga earned his first career win April 16, 2008 in a 13–2 
victory over the Cleveland Indians. On June 13, 2008, Galarraga pitched 
seven shutout innings in a 5–0 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He 
finished the 2008 campaign with a 13–7 record, a 3.73 earned run average 
(ERA), and 126 strikeouts in 178 2⁄3 innings.[4] When batters did hit the 
ball against him, they only managed a .237 batting average on balls in 
play, the lowest in the Major Leagues.[5] Galarraga threw sliders 38.9% 
of the time in 2008, more than any other starting pitcher in the majors.[6] 
After a superb rookie season, Galarraga finished fourth in the balloting 
for the 2008 American League Rookie of the Year Award. On April 10, 2009, 
Galarraga pitched the home opener at Comerica Park. Tigers manager Jim 
Leyland said Galarraga deserved to pitch Opening Day after having an impressive 
2008 season. The Tigers won the game 15–2, which included a grand slam 
by Miguel Cabrera. On April 29, prior to a game against the New York Yankees, 
Galarraga received his 2008 Tigers Rookie of the Year award from the Detroit 
Sports Broadcasters Association. Statistically, Galarraga did not approach 
the success he achieved in the 2008 season. His 2009 ERA was a below average 
5.64, and opposing batters hit a high .284 against him. In seven innings 
of work in spring training of 2010, Galarraga allowed nine runs, 14 hits 
and seven walks. That, coupled with his attitude ("They've seen my stuff; 
they know what I can do", Galarraga said during his ineffective spring 
training stint), prompted the Tigers to option him to the Tigers Triple-A 
affiliate Toledo on March 18, 2010.[7] Galarraga was called up to the Tigers 
in May 2010 and was put into the starting rotation. He had an ERA of 4.50 
as of June 1. Galarraga was optioned to Toledo on July 6, 2010 but Tigers 
GM Dave Dombrowski has said he would return on July 20 and start against 
Texas.[8] On July 19, the Tigers recalled Galarraga.[9] On June 2, 2010, 
Galarraga pitched 8 2⁄3 perfect innings, but the perfect game disappeared 
on the 27th batter after what was ruled an infield hit. Rookie Jason Donald 
hit a ground ball to first baseman Miguel Cabrera, who tossed to Galarraga—who 
was covering first base—but first base umpire Jim Joyce incorrectly called 
Donald safe, ending the perfect game and no-hitter. Galarraga retired the 
next batter, completing the one-hitter, though many in the Tiger press 
preferred to call it "the 28-out perfect game."[10] Galarraga threw 88 
pitches, 67 of them for strikes. If he had completed the perfect game (83 
pitches), it would have been the lowest number of pitches thrown since 
Addie Joss' 74 in 1908, and the shortest game since Sandy Koufax's perfect 
game in 1965. It would have been the second perfect game in the Major Leagues 
in just four days, Philadelphia's Roy Halladay having thrown his on May 
29, and the third in 24 days (Dallas Braden of Oakland on May 9). Joyce 
later issued a direct apology to Galarraga, saying that the call was incorrect.[11][12][13] 
Galarraga accepted the mistake gracefully, saying later, "Nobody's perfect."[14] 
Observers pointed to the handling of the situation as an example of good 
sportsmanship on both sides.[14] He was presented with a "Medal of Reasonableness" 
for his reasoned response to Joyce's call at the Rally to Restore Sanity 
and/or Fear.[15] During the 2010–11 offseason, Galarraga was designated 
for assignment by the Tigers.[16] On January 24, 2011 he was traded to 
the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for pitchers Kevin Eichhorn and Ryan 
Robowski.[17] On May 17, 2011, Galarraga was designated for assignment 
and spent the rest of the season with the AAA Reno Aces[18] After the 2011 
season, he became a free agent.[19] Galarraga signed as a minor league 
free agent with the Baltimore Orioles on January 18, 2012. The Orioles 
released him on April 6, and he signed a minor league contract as a free 
agent with the Houston Astros on May 21, 2012. He pitched in five games 
for the Astros between July 28 and August 19, losing four of them. Galarraga 
was designated for assignment on August 22[20] and released on August 25, 
2012. Galarraga signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds 
in January 2013.[21] He was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Parker Frazier 
on July 15, 2013.[22] He was assigned to AAA affiliate Sky Sox.[23] In 
January 2014, Galarraga joined the Texas Rangers on a minor league deal.[24] 
He was released on March 24.[25] Galarraga signed a contract with the Chinatrust 
Brother Elephants of Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League in April 
2014. He pitched 10 games and posted an ERA of 4.470. He was released by 
the club on July 5, 2014. In 2015, Galarraga signed a contract with the 
Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican League.[26] In between, Galarraga played 
winter ball with the Leones del Caracas club of the Venezuelan League in 
parts of seven seasons spanning 1999–2014. Galarraga retired from professional
